[0:21] surprise
[0:23] yes
[0:25] [Music]
[0:28] good morning Saints what a pleasure it
[0:31] is to be here again sorry to look around
[0:34] and see brother Colley and I here and
[0:35] the rest of them but Lord you know
[0:37] wherever they are they're with us in our
[0:40] hearts would this pray that him bring
[0:43] them on through those doors
[0:45] we're gonna read Psalms 19 this morning
[0:48] funny thing I happened yesterday brother
[0:51] Mark come in a lot of times we'll be
[0:53] able to sneak in the back room and sit
[0:54] down and just have a word with him and
[0:57] he showed that Lord had brought
[0:59] something to his heart particularly
[1:01] about what brother Dale has been
[1:02] preaching and I think it's a good point
[1:04] for all of us to see that as we open
[1:07] God's Word and read God's Word we always
[1:09] got to be looking what God's trying to
[1:12] tell us in his word and I've always
[1:15] complicated it in my little pea brain up
[1:17] here but we always got to be looking in
[1:19] it and I just asked this morning as we
[1:21] read the Psalms 19 that you'd be looking
[1:24] for justification sanctification and the
[1:30] Holy Ghost showing up and just be
[1:33] looking for it because it's always there
[1:41] before we open the word this morning
[1:43] let's just have a word of Prayer
[1:46] oh is that the ones it's not here today
[1:49] this I hope it burdens your heart for
[1:52] them because faith comes by hearing and
[1:56] by hearing of the word and we certainly
[1:58] have the word here and let's just pray
[2:00] and that's God to strengthen the faith
[2:02] of the ones that couldn't come through
[2:03] the door this morning all right dear
[2:06] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[2:07] place you've given us on this earth
[2:09] father in this time that we've come to
[2:11] the Lord that your word has come to full
[2:14] maturity Lord that we must take this
[2:17] word and all of it not just part of it
[2:19] we have to take all of it Lord and let
[2:20] us get out of the way and father touch
[2:25] and bless these humble bodies father and
[2:28] and feed our hungry souls Lord place
[2:32] your word in us that you have you wait
[2:35] with us and that our footsteps be your
[2:37] footsteps father God on this earth
[2:39] because we're the only thing that this
[2:42] world is going to see you through us
[2:46] Lord sanctifies father God that we can
[2:49] fulfill that and we ask now Lord as we
[2:52] come and open your word and you just
[2:54] come down and touch us Lord and be with
[2:58] each one here today there's come to hear
[3:00] from you father bless brother Dale as
[3:02] he's preparing to bring your word father
[3:04] more two messages he's been bringing
[3:05] father on the simple things as we say
[3:09] simple they're not really simple Lord
[3:10] because I'm glad brother Dale is
[3:13] preaching over and over and over and
[3:16] over again bringing this word and
[3:18] sweeping it through our souls Lord that
[3:20] we can see our journey that he is
[3:21] speaking of our journey and we must see
[3:24] it Lord open our eyes nor understand and
[3:27] bless brother Wade and all the ones in
[3:28] the Sunday School classes here today
[3:30] your word comes forth to his father and
[3:32] again bless those it couldn't be here
[3:35] today for whatever hinders said we asked
[3:38] these things and bless the opening of
[3:39] your word he asked in your name Lord
[3:41] Jesus Christ amen
[3:45] I brought help this morning
[4:09] hmm Psalms 19 the heavens declare the
[4:13] glory of God and the firmament showeth
[4:17] his handiwork there is no speech nor
[4:27] language where their voice is not heard
[4:41] which is as a bridegroom coming out of
[4:46] the chamber and rejoice as a strong man
[4:50] to run a race
[5:03] let the Lord the Lord is perfect
[5:08] converting the soul and testimony of the
[5:13] Lord is sure making wise this simple the
[5:28] affair of the Lord is clean enduring
[5:29] forever the judgments of the Lord are
[5:32] true and righteous altogether moreover
[5:47] by them as a servant warned and in
[5:50] keeping of them there is great reward
[5:59] keep back thy servant from presumptions
[6:02] of sin let them not have dominion over
[6:06] me then shall I be upright and I shall
[6:10] be ignorant from the great transgression

[11:10] gather your out of all countries and
[11:13] we'll bring you into your own land then

[11:24] I cleanse you a new heart also would I
[11:28] give you in a new spirit when I put
[11:31] within you and I will take away that
[11:33] stony heart out of your flesh and I will
[11:36] give you an heart of flesh and I will
[11:39] put my spirit within you and cause you
[11:42] to walk in my statutes and you shall
[11:45] keep my judgments and do them and you
[11:49] shall dwell in the land that I give to
[11:51] your fathers and you shall be my people
[11:54] and I will be your God you may be seated
[11:58] the Lord that is blessing to the reading
[12:01] of the word now I wrote my own self a
[12:08] note because we will be continuing on
[12:10] him so if you would listen our read the
[12:16] message called the stature of a perfect
[12:18] man we will be eventually going into
[12:23] this and getting into you know into that
[12:26] place the Lord willing brother Bob and
[12:29] singing but you must be back there in
[12:32] the back so all right the Lord willing
[12:34] brother Bob will be ministering horses
[12:36] coming Wednesday
[12:38] so little you know and then waiter then
[12:41] would be gone the next one or so let's
[12:45] go just remember all of these
[12:47] announcements all right now what are we
[12:50] talking about what was our life thought
[12:53] we've come up through justification
[12:56] sanctification and the baptism of the
[12:59] holy ghost to be the new birth
[13:02] all right now the Prophet said is we
[13:06] were talking about last night in the
[13:07] Bible study they asked him was it
[13:09] required that we have justification
[13:11] sanctification the baptism with Holy
[13:13] Ghost to have the new work he said yes
[13:15] or absolutely is a correct word then he
[13:19] used we'll see then that's what we've
[13:22] tried to get you to see and get you to
[13:25] look at I'm not trying to get you to
[13:27] doubt what you've got that's between you
[13:30] and God but I've asked you to consider
[13:34] that because if it offends you what we
[13:38] say about justification same case
[13:40] baptism a little ghost then you're not
[13:43] born again
[13:44] now if that offends you for me to say
[13:47] either way all right it's the truth in
[13:52] because the Prophet is one it taught it
[13:55] so we believe it all right now the last
[13:59] part we came to was the baptism of the
[14:01] Holy Ghost and with fire that was our
[14:04] life statements of this past Wednesday
[14:08] talking about coming to that final to
[14:12] the stage of the new birth being made
[14:15] manifest into our hearts and our lives
[14:17] and what it was then that justification
[14:21] shuts off you Pisceans sanctification
[14:24] cleanses you and set you aside and the
[14:28] baptism with the Holy Ghost comes and
[14:30] dwells and brains are put within us the
[14:34] person of Jesus Christ in the form of
[14:37] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and that
[14:41] is the new birth all right now when we
[14:43] studied about money that said the
[14:46] baptism when the Holy Ghost and with
[14:47] fire cause you see there's a lot left in
[14:50] us
[14:51] even though we've been you could be
[14:53] justified even though you can be
[14:55] sanctified you're still a human being
[14:58] you still got that old nature of in you
[15:02] you don't have the snake no no it's gone
[15:06] but it's our natural nature of human
[15:11] beings and who we are
[15:12] they're still there all right you said
[15:16] well it well went out of me when when
[15:18] the snake went out we'll what came in
[15:21] there's not as much to deal with what
[15:23] went out is to deal with what comes in
[15:25] well because if God don't come and live
[15:29] in our heart then we're not born again
[15:31] remember we've emphasized over and over
[15:34] why the Prophet said it when he said it
[15:38] like this he said yes you've accepted
[15:41] Jesus Christ but says has he accepted
[15:46] you the brother Brennan said if he's
[15:50] accepted you he will give you the
[15:54] baptism of the Holy Ghost if he's
[15:58] accepted you well what would be the
[15:59] problem what did we study through that
[16:01] part is that we we can have all of that
[16:05] took out of us yes all of it cleaned out
[16:09] of us but we're still ourselves I'm
[16:11] emphasizing that over and over because
[16:14] even after you're born again you still
[16:18] have to deal with your old nature they
[16:25] didn't take out everything out of us
[16:27] cause we're sanctified it just sets
[16:31] cleanse it enough to work God could use
[16:34] it I see then you've got to come to a
[16:37] place to where that God could come and
[16:40] live in and as he comes and lives in see
[16:43] then he burns out what's left so that's
[16:46] why I said Holy Ghost and with fire
[16:48] that's what your prophet said on the
[16:50] future home he cleanse out everything
[16:54] that's left and comes and live because
[16:57] he's not gonna come in us is there
[16:59] something in there now that ought to be
[17:02] the emphasis to understand
[17:04] all points about the new birth is the
[17:07] fact that you can not have God and the
[17:11] devil in your soul at the same time
[17:14] cause God will not dwell in an unclean
[17:17] vessel
[17:17] all right then that's got to be taken
[17:22] out of it all right see then that was
[17:23] what we were covering how that that Holy
[17:26] Ghost burns out everything that's left
[17:28] of us he burns that out and comes to
[17:32] live in our soul and making that the new
[17:36] birth all right so there is your new
[17:39] birth and what we've been talking about
[17:41] so we're gonna stop right there at at
[17:43] that point in jump today now because
[17:45] we're going over to the end of the
[17:47] message because I've reached a position
[17:50] that I want to go over kind of to the
[17:53] end of the message and then come back
[17:56] and preach on it so I want you to think
[17:58] about that today that of what I'm trying
[18:01] to do I'm jumping a long ways now so
[18:04] then that will we will be covering it
[18:06] you know you know in a way to understand
[18:10] all right so then the Holy Ghost coming
[18:14] in burns out all that's left of you and
[18:19] places his own life this is a quote from
[18:22] brother Branham which is the baptism
[18:25] with the Holy Ghost into you as the new
[18:29] birth all right
[18:33] see that's the dove that comes in that's
[18:38] the dove is we could put up the draw in
[18:40] and put the dove up in the but that's
[18:42] the dove that comes in which is the holy
[18:44] spirit to come and live in us all right
[18:48] now in that then see we can depend on
[18:52] him to lead us through those doors where
[18:56] Paul would say it's not a I that liveth
[19:00] but Christ that liveth in me and said
[19:03] the life that I now live I live by the
[19:06] faith of the Son of God so we don't
[19:08] credit anything in our new birth to be
[19:11] of us it's all God he's come to live in
[19:14] us all right he says now sure you can
[19:17] still be
[19:18] tempted but a true born-again Christian
[19:24] cannot sin we were talking about that
[19:26] last night see because that person is
[19:29] inside of you they do wrong that one
[19:37] that's inside of you can't do wrong the
[19:40] conus eternal life alright so then we
[19:43] start from that point now and I want us
[19:46] to to move up but I want you to watch
[19:48] the point now because we're going to go
[19:50] through a couple of things in the
[19:52] message and watch it alright we covered
[19:55] that depend Costas the message of their
[19:58] day the message of the Pentecostals day
[20:02] and time was three works three stages of
[20:06] grace justification sanctification
[20:09] baptism and Holy Ghost now some of them
[20:12] that were called Pentecostals you know
[20:17] some of it were called Pentecostals were
[20:20] some that like you're what would want
[20:22] you brethren call them the something
[20:25] Methodist there's a group in there that
[20:27] they they believe that sanctification is
[20:30] the baptism of the holy ghost so but
[20:33] they call themselves are recording
[20:35] themselves as being like Pentecostals
[20:38] Pentecostals covers a whole large thing
[20:41] from the oneness to the Tunis to the
[20:43] Faunus to the Church of God to the
[20:45] Church of Christ you know but their
[20:47] message I want you to watch that now
[20:51] because it's very vital to understand
[20:54] where they stand to know where we stand
[21:00] and that's the purpose of the day we're
[21:03] gonna go over here then we're going to
[21:04] drop back and pick up so we'll pick up
[21:07] stature of a perfect man okay now watch
[21:10] then the Pentecostals message was
[21:15] justification sanctification and the
[21:18] baptism of the holy ghost with the
[21:21] Prophet said they cabbage down on that
[21:26] alright and he said they missed it
[21:30] he said because we're Ezekiel says I
[21:34] give you a new heart and a new spirit he
[21:37] said the Pentecostals people took that
[21:39] new spirit as being that tongues and the
[21:43] shoutings and the glory hallelujah and
[21:46] believing that was the new birth he said
[21:48] that wasn't it
[21:50] now what about telling the Pentecostal
[21:53] people I mean the whole ranks of the
[21:56] Pentecostal movement and him telling
[22:00] them that they would didn't have what
[22:04] they thought they had no wonder they got
[22:08] upset with no wonder they turned against
[22:11] him no wonder he went from thousands and
[22:14] meetings to half a dozen why because the
[22:19] word began to open all right now
[22:22] evidently now if he told him that he'd
[22:27] been the Prophet don't you think that
[22:32] that Holy Spirit within that prophet
[22:33] would let him know what those people
[22:35] were doing and how they were doing what
[22:39] with that new spirit you remember how we
[22:43] brought it he said in Ezekiel I'll give
[22:45] you a new heart he takes away the old
[22:47] stony heart yeah and give us a heart of
[22:52] flesh we taught that in the Baptist
[22:53] Church all right see called we could see
[22:56] a little bit but we didn't see the the
[22:59] you know new spirit new heart and with I
[23:02] mean the new spirit and in my spirit no
[23:04] we didn't see none of that but we talked
[23:06] the fact that that unclean spirit going
[23:10] out and all of that things we didn't
[23:13] teach it may be that away but we did
[23:15] believe in a mellow heart the word that
[23:21] we come out with a heart of flesh to be
[23:23] mellow and be you know sincere all right
[23:28] now so then be in that away now look at
[23:33] what I'm Tom bow if they miss their
[23:37] message
[23:43] did he miss their message other day I'm
[23:46] talking about before brother branham
[23:49] come on the scene they had the message
[23:51] of justification sanctification and the
[23:54] baptism of the holy ghost the
[23:56] Pentecostals had that before the Prophet
[23:59] came on the scene he said they cabbage
[24:07] down on it and wouldn't go on with it
[24:09] and didn't believe it within if they'd
[24:11] done that do you think we can't do that
[24:16] we see no no don't no we can't do that
[24:18] well we're this that rather well okay if
[24:22] they miss their message and we don't get
[24:26] it in a straight order of understanding
[24:28] could it be that we miss this massive oh
[24:35] no no well what's the problem with all
[24:42] of this now on the Internet's and all of
[24:44] these things we've got one message how
[24:53] many different doctrines are there from
[24:55] one message how many different ideas or
[25:02] thoughts or ports from one message okay
[25:07] now if you see Ezekiel as I tried to
[25:13] cover Ezekiel is a marvelous scriptures
[25:16] in the point that he described what
[25:20] would be in the Azusa Street Pentecostal
[25:24] movement that it would go from a new
[25:29] heart to a new spirit and I put my
[25:36] spirit in you and Ezekiel covered that
[25:39] looking all the way down to the end time
[25:43] because he would see as I've covered the
[25:45] Scriptures he'd say that I took you from
[25:48] among the people I brought you in I
[25:51] washed you clean I've done all of it and
[25:53] then I made way for you to receive
[25:56] you eternal life back there right
[26:01] that was a CQ speaking of the coming of
[26:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[26:05] all right so down through the ages
[26:07] you've got that baptism of the Holy
[26:09] Ghost if we were trying to cover life
[26:12] not in a lot enough in the Bible study
[26:14] that see each person this is what I
[26:20] believe in this way I've always taught
[26:22] because the Prophet said it is it
[26:26] necessary that we have justification
[26:28] same casing about you long ago he said
[26:30] absolutely all right absolutely sin
[26:35] exactly right all right see then if we
[26:38] argue that point then what age are we in
[26:46] because your prophet come to tie
[26:49] together all of the loose ends right
[26:51] we'll get to that in a minute what about
[26:55] one of those things being the new birth
[27:00] what about one of the things being a
[27:04] statue of a perfect man what about those
[27:07] things that we claim we understand okay
[27:14] so now let's get to the point of what
[27:17] we're talking about
[27:20] then the Prophet brought the message to
[27:27] tie together as will cover the loose
[27:29] ends that was left out he names them
[27:32] loose ends on a lot of it the loose ends
[27:35] would be something that was not totally
[27:38] set down in order so he was telling the
[27:40] Pentecostals you've left loose ends that
[27:44] by you don't know what the new birth is
[27:49] don't you think it was something for him
[27:51] to stand up there and talk to those
[27:53] people about the new birth and him be
[27:56] able to look right down in that person
[27:57] and see they wouldn't ride
[28:04] or did they miss that by taking that new
[28:08] spirit to be the Holy Spirit instead of
[28:12] waiting for the Holy Ghost to come in
[28:15] its complete fullness but I believe only
[28:17] their pinnacle I'm drowning on day of
[28:18] Azusa Street I believe that was the new
[28:20] birth that was the baptism of the Holy
[28:25] Ghost and he came upon a people and
[28:29] that's what's so amazing I've tried to
[28:31] get you to look at it see we think
[28:32] you've always got a visitor kind of it
[28:33] you realize on the day of Azusa Street
[28:36] when the Holy Ghost fell it fell on
[28:40] Trinitarian people they were not oneness
[28:46] until about 1912 leaveners well
[28:48] somewhere in there
[28:50] for the one that's ever come into being
[28:53] they were Pentecostal people but there
[28:56] were Trinitarians see so you see why
[29:03] they missed their message and we were
[29:07] talking about it last night and the
[29:08] brother asked the question about it
[29:10] we're brother Branham said a new Trinity
[29:12] comes out well the old Trinity was what
[29:17] a Trinitarian doctrine that come out and
[29:22] was brought over into even from Azusa
[29:26] Street they were still believing those
[29:29] things of a Trinitarian doctrine all
[29:33] right he said then a new Trinity will
[29:36] come out well could we be in the place
[29:40] of that new Trinity could we be taking
[29:43] our own thoughts and ideas and it would
[29:46] be contrary to what the prophets say it
[29:49] but yet was not we're not gonna change
[29:51] it okay now look so then this life's
[29:56] aged now here's where we want to start
[29:58] from because I believe and I've called
[30:02] it from the day one when I seen one two
[30:04] prophets if I believe Azusa Street was
[30:07] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new
[30:11] birth I believe that's what they had all
[30:16] right
[30:17] and see having the baptism of the holy
[30:19] ghost see then that was the pouring out
[30:21] of the promise that I pour out my spirit
[30:24] upon all flesh literally it was more of
[30:27] a promising back under because when he
[30:30] poured out the Holy Spirit on the day of
[30:32] Pentecost you didn't have the false find
[30:35] involved he said I pour out my spirit
[30:38] upon all things your sons and out my
[30:41] handmaids the owner Zeus's tree that was
[30:43] poured out upon everything Methodist
[30:46] Baptist Presbyterian Pentecost or really
[30:49] they wouldn't call Pentecostals until
[30:51] that time all right
[30:53] and as that was poured out upon them
[30:56] they accepted it and took it and put it
[31:00] down as being tongues as evidence our
[31:04] signs and wonders okay now and I from a
[31:08] firm believer in that
[31:09] and here comes brother Branham alone and
[31:12] what is he saying there's a lot of
[31:16] people in this message don't believe
[31:18] that there's Uther Street had any
[31:21] thought well if they didn't you don't
[31:24] have anything stand on what are you
[31:27] standing them I'm standing here today
[31:31] that's why I've done it and have
[31:33] defended it so hard I stand here today
[31:35] on justification that Martin Luther talk
[31:39] I stand on sanctification that John
[31:45] Wesley talked about I don't deny any of
[31:49] that that was God for the Aged that was
[31:52] the new birth for the aged that was part
[31:55] of the kingdom of God for the aged and
[31:57] if you don't believe they had the new
[31:59] birth then where do you get your idea
[32:02] from see they had a new birth of the
[32:08] time the age in the points we were
[32:11] talking about life not discussing it
[32:12] quite lengthy yeah get to point then
[32:18] with going into the message this last
[32:23] age
[32:27] Azusa Street completed the birth that's
[32:36] where we're gonna start from now so
[32:37] you're gonna have to hold on it
[32:42] completed the birth okay there's where
[32:47] your profits told and that's how much he
[32:49] may I'm Liam pointed to what they had
[32:52] they had the new birth he said I met
[32:58] people that had the baptism of the Holy
[33:02] Ghost fifty years he said before I come
[33:06] along the genuine now listening he's in
[33:12] exactly like on the day of Pentecost did
[33:18] you think people accept that I've told
[33:20] you about it was sitting in a minute two
[33:23] brothers we we were at a place were
[33:25] sitting there discussing it and that
[33:27] topic came up and they both said they
[33:30] couldn't understand I said white why
[33:33] can't you understand I said on the day
[33:38] of Pentecost there was two things took
[33:40] place the Upper Room experience was a
[33:43] hundred and twenty they had been tutored
[33:47] by the Lord Jesus and when the Holy
[33:49] Ghost fell it gave them what we would
[33:52] talk about the stature of a perfect man
[33:54] in the Sun not the heads don't go to
[33:57] that and come yet all right but three
[33:59] thousand outside only heard one message
[34:04] so there's a simple answer to the
[34:06] Prophet saying it he wasn't saying that
[34:11] the hundred twenty in the upper room
[34:12] just had a small amount no he was saying
[34:16] they were genuinely born-again but the
[34:18] ones outside see at the new birth yes
[34:24] but that new birth there was not a one
[34:28] of them out of that three thousand that
[34:33] was used to write the word
[34:38] all that was used to write the word come
[34:41] from the 120 in the upper room well
[34:44] because they didn't have it they were
[34:47] having to depend upon that that's why
[34:50] Peter was teaching the stature of a
[34:52] perfect man who - who - to the 3,000
[35:00] that received the Holy Ghost but that
[35:03] was only the new birth for their age in
[35:06] time we'll get to that in the stature of
[35:09] a perfect man as we go along all right
[35:12] but watch now go ahead were number 1
[35:14] let's read a few up but then if the
[35:20] Pentecostal message was the last message
[35:25] with justification sanctification and
[35:29] baptism of the Holy Ghost the lies three
[35:34] messages the life story Church ages
[35:38] forms the complete birth okay no is he
[35:47] right he's talking about the Pentecostal
[35:53] people that think that completes the
[35:58] birth all right now then in a minute
[36:05] we'll get to it where he said but there
[36:06] was a lot of loose ends left but it
[36:10] completed the birth well if people say
[36:15] but I don't believe in penance and then
[36:17] the looser streets had a new birth well
[36:19] I don't believe you got it if that's
[36:21] what you believe so we got each other
[36:26] fighting with each other about it right
[36:28] cuz why can't you believe they have the
[36:31] new birth
[36:34] well they had all these problems and
[36:36] this that you know what's your problem
[36:42] we're gonna put it on problems what's
[36:44] your problem
[36:49] I'm going to try my best to believe what
[36:51] that prophet said that he met people
[36:53] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[36:58] exactly like the day of Pentecost there
[37:07] are you going to accept that point as to
[37:08] be what he said do you need that
[37:10] wouldn't we we can bring all of these up
[37:14] but look what he says the last three
[37:18] ages completed the birth justification
[37:22] under Luther sanctification under Wesley
[37:25] the baptism of the Holy Ghost under
[37:28] Azusa Street or we call it the
[37:30] Pentecostals completed to birth or in
[37:35] other words brought the birth back to
[37:39] her that it would be like the book of
[37:41] Acts see there's word you'll go with it
[37:47] and and do but won't listen to what
[37:49] somebody that's trying to explain it
[37:50] it's saying about it you go I don't see
[37:54] how them Pentecostals could have had the
[37:55] baptism of the Holy Ghost well look what
[37:58] they're done they had this probably had
[38:01] a well watch your problem see I just put
[38:09] it plain you say well I just don't see
[38:14] how they could have had the new birth
[38:15] when you're saying the Prophet was wrong
[38:19] that's your choice he said they had the
[38:26] new birth he said they had and that it
[38:30] was completed in that of that new birth
[38:37] well I never thought about it like that
[38:39] because I heard brother so-and-so saying
[38:42] all they had was this Gilson signed in
[38:44] wonder what do you think they had in
[38:46] that day if they had gifts they had to
[38:50] hold it goes well I just don't well okay
[38:57] that's you don't believe it but now go
[39:00] tell everybody else you don't believe it
[39:03] trying my best to be honest to you I say
[39:05] what I say for the pulpit
[39:07] but you go yakety-yak to each other
[39:10] about what you believe that where I'm
[39:12] wrong why don't you come and tell me at
[39:16] least we could sit down and talk it out
[39:17] but I'm talking it out here I'm putting
[39:22] it plain as I can be your prophet is the
[39:24] one that said it not me
[39:26] that the life three ages completed the
[39:28] birth or hot didn't they must have had
[39:36] to do birth then he said it completed
[39:43] the birth little Wren said one day liked
[39:45] it he said they was in other words he
[39:49] said the early Azusa Street is basically
[39:52] what he's saying but he said there were
[39:56] closer to the coming of the Lord than we
[39:58] are you need that quote well see how
[40:03] that could become what's he told they
[40:05] were living a Christian life under the
[40:11] word of their age and really crying out
[40:14] to God there were being good Christians
[40:25] and there was didn't you say well what
[40:31] are we what are we here what are we
[40:33] doing all right we're here to understand
[40:40] the Word of God then to walk Darian all
[40:45] right now so are you satisfied with that
[40:48] he said it completes the birth
[40:50] okay well then that was back there well
[40:56] I don't believe it wasn't he said it so
[40:59] you're arguing with him that's that's
[41:01] nothing to me and you and you set in my
[41:03] office and say brother Dale I don't
[41:04] believe it I'm gonna say he said it then
[41:07] you saying you don't believe him cause
[41:12] he's the one who said it
[41:14] well I think he meant well now I don't
[41:17] care about your mince or me either one
[41:21] What did he say that's what he meant
[41:27] right okay now let's go to number two
[41:32] and pick up a thot and get into this for
[41:35] the rest of the message he's talking
[41:40] about in this last age and how that it's
[41:45] gonna come to where we're at all right
[41:50] so listen takes the book seals and
[41:54] breaks them and shows the seventh angel
[41:57] or this alone the mysteries of God is
[42:00] the Ministry of the seventh angel okay
[42:06] that's the Ministry of the seventh angel
[42:09] is to want to tell us about these things
[42:15] what did brother on them come far we
[42:24] just come through the ages and history
[42:25] of proving this the angels message of
[42:28] the seventh church all right
[42:29] revealed all the mysteries that's been
[42:31] in the past all the things in the PI's
[42:34] revelations 10 1 through 7 that's to be
[42:37] and remember in the days of the seventh
[42:40] angel he's sounding for blasting forth
[42:44] the gospel trumpet used to finish all
[42:46] the mysteries of God okay
[42:50] what is the message for this age what
[42:53] was the Prophet to do the Zeus the
[42:55] street completed the birth he didn't
[42:58] come to bring a new birth to Azusa
[43:00] Street they completed it that's what he
[43:07] said now it's like here come forth in
[43:12] the early church age we'll get to it
[43:14] after a while
[43:15] first it was a doctor knife fitted in he
[43:18] said they didn't become a saying first
[43:20] then a doctrine and then there
[43:26] then become a statute then become a
[43:28] church and through the dark ages and out
[43:31] of the dark ages come the first
[43:33] Reformation Luther and he brought with
[43:35] him all kind of mysterious things that
[43:39] happened during that church age all back
[43:44] in Darcy but he never finished it up
[43:47] Luther didn't finish it up Wesley did
[43:52] finish it looser Street didn't finish
[43:54] him it's this message that's the one for
[43:59] the finish not Lutheran Wesley done that
[44:02] they've done the best they could do they
[44:04] had God for their time and they they
[44:07] come forth with the message all right
[44:08] listen then along come Wesley was
[44:11] sanctification some more of it but still
[44:14] never finished it left loose the ends
[44:16] everywhere such as sprinkling them to
[44:19] the baptism and Luther took Father Son
[44:21] and Holy Ghost and still of the Lord
[44:22] Jesus try all these different things but
[44:27] tell us where we take that and say we're
[44:29] Lutheran Wesleyan didn't how nothing now
[44:32] brother rather said they'll come the
[44:34] birth was completed on the zoo Street
[44:39] the message right within West Lutheran
[44:46] Westland him you said well Lutheran
[44:47] wedding them didn't have nothing I'd
[44:49] like for you to show me that because
[44:54] they had two new births for their time
[45:00] if they didn't have the new birth
[45:02] they're not in the body across because
[45:05] it requires the new birth to be in the
[45:07] body of Christ
[45:09] all right so then let's let them be what
[45:13] they are
[45:13] they had loose ends one because they
[45:19] were not profits they were reformers rah
[45:25] ten alone come to Pentecostal age with
[45:27] the baptism of the holy ghost cabbage
[45:29] down on that there cannot be no more
[45:32] ages that end of that now that's all of
[45:37] it that's to fill our the the legacy in
[45:40] but then we found in the studying of the
[45:42] scripture that the messenger to the
[45:45] aides come right at the end of the age
[45:47] every time Paul come at the end of the
[45:50] age we find out Iranians come at the end
[45:52] of the age Martin into the age look at
[45:55] into the Catholic age and what Wesley at
[45:58] the end of the Lutheran age and the
[46:00] Pentecost at the end of the age of
[46:03] sanctification through the baptism of
[46:06] the holy ghost or what come for the
[46:08] Pentecostals and at the end of the
[46:12] Pentecostal age we are supposed to
[46:15] receive according to the word has God
[46:17] helped me to not to show you through
[46:19] here that we are to see receive a
[46:22] messenger that will take all those blue
[46:24] sins out there and reveal the whole
[46:27] secret of God for the rapture of the
[46:29] church now that's brother Brent Spence
[46:33] he's right that's brother Brad Abraha
[46:36] okay that's the one we're talking about
[46:40] that we're kind of believe that's the
[46:42] one that said that the Pentecostals had
[46:48] completed the birth then there's coming
[46:56] for seven mysterious thunders see that's
[46:58] where we get all that Tata I believe
[47:00] through those seven thunders be revealed
[47:02] in the last days in order to get the
[47:04] bride together okay
[47:05] you know we can go to deal with that
[47:07] part we're just going on with what we're
[47:09] talking about what I'm trying to get you
[47:11] to see one time and the Prophet come to
[47:15] bring this message there was a lot of
[47:18] loose ends and he had to pick it up and
[47:23] bring it forth okay let's go go to
[47:28] number three
[47:35] and our messengers promised in Malachi
[47:37] for the fourth chapter he's promised to
[47:40] do it and the message is to bring forth
[47:42] the word bring the people back to the
[47:45] word birth is to be she's to be
[47:48] delivered of a new bird from according
[47:51] to Malachi 4 the bride is to be
[47:54] delivered of a new birth from according
[48:00] to Malachi 4 the words the prophets
[48:05] message is to birth you in me
[48:11] Azusa Street finished completed the
[48:14] birth of the ages but this word has got
[48:19] to be birthed by somebody to prove that
[48:22] it's correct well they don't have to be
[48:25] correct come on get off him ain't gonna
[48:28] argue me but look the message is to
[48:31] bring back the word this prophet was to
[48:36] bring back the word who want the word
[48:39] that the bride could be delivered from a
[48:43] new birth or by new birth now do you
[48:47] understand what I've tried to explain in
[48:49] the days of Martin Luther Martin Luther
[48:53] was a was a oh he called it a monks in a
[48:57] monastery studying and doing those
[48:59] things and God appeared to him and
[49:01] brought him the message or the just
[49:03] shall live by faith and that was the
[49:08] word for the age that was the new birth
[49:12] for that age the just shall live by
[49:14] faith
[49:17] John Wesley come forth with
[49:19] sanctification that was the word for
[49:22] that age that was the new bird for that
[49:24] age Zeus the street came forth with the
[49:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost the
[49:32] restoration of the gifts signs and
[49:34] wonders yes but that was the birth of
[49:37] the age see then here we come and what
[49:41] do we get
[49:45] we are to be delivered that's what he
[49:49] said she's to be delivered of a new bird
[49:53] I'm according to Monica for who is to be
[49:56] delivered the Bride of Christ this
[49:59] message has got to be birthed by
[50:01] somebody a birth means are coming forth
[50:04] into somebody's got to come forth into
[50:09] this message and be the very message
[50:14] right cause if they're not you realize
[50:21] all the rest is waiting on you and
[50:25] everything is waiting on you or not for
[50:29] us to give birth to the message that has
[50:32] been brought well those don't see
[50:38] nothing like this unless that's all
[50:41] right you can take what you want to do
[50:46] what you like what you see when then
[50:49] brother Branham would make statements
[50:51] people just go who you are look at the
[50:52] next one what does he say
[50:58] number four look what he says and then
[51:02] we find out then these mysteries are
[51:05] supposed to be revealed and why didn't
[51:07] these other men Wesley Lutheran these
[51:10] great reformers who brought out
[51:12] justification sanctification Pentecostal
[51:16] age with the baptism of the holy spirit
[51:17] still why didn't he catch these these
[51:21] messages why didn't they get them
[51:25] because they were reformers that's the
[51:30] reason Luther and him could not go any
[51:31] farther than they went they were
[51:33] reformers all right look they take on
[51:41] the other side there was people come in
[51:43] who was Paris Kings is explained with
[51:45] these the reason that all of the stray
[51:47] ends of the mysterious part about
[51:52] justification the mysterious part
[51:58] of sanctification the mysterious part of
[52:03] the baptism with the Holy Ghost now he
[52:08] said they went through their time and
[52:10] their ages and done what they're
[52:11] supposed to do but there was a
[52:13] mysterious part left a mysterious part
[52:17] of justification a mysterious part of
[52:22] sanctification a mysterious part of the
[52:26] baptism when the Holy Ghost now remember
[52:29] that's in the seals where is explaining
[52:33] what is the mysterious part of
[52:36] justification what is the mysterious
[52:41] part of sanctification
[52:43] what's the mysterious part of the
[52:45] baptism when the old ago
[52:47] the two seals is to bring out the two
[52:50] prophet was to bring in not me and you
[52:52] not brother day old or anybody else
[52:54] it was the Prophet to bring the ones
[52:57] that's the reason I read that where he
[52:59] was to come forth and bring together all
[53:02] the loose ends and he did he brought
[53:12] forth the mysterious part of these
[53:15] uh-huh but what did he bring brother
[53:21] Dale well he brought the mysterious part
[53:32] in other words he brought justification
[53:37] from what man thought it was saying to a
[53:46] correct understanding of what really
[53:49] justification is he brought
[53:54] sanctification from a place of what man
[53:57] thought it was see most people think
[54:00] sanctification means you don't cut you
[54:02] higher you don't smoke you don't drink
[54:03] you don't you
[54:09] most everybody think that's what
[54:11] sanctification here well I quit this and
[54:13] I quit that thinking that's what
[54:15] sanctification is you know that brother
[54:18] Branham says your name goes on the book
[54:21] as a believer that's sanctification know
[54:26] my name went on the book for the world
[54:32] the Prophet says it sanctification means
[54:39] a whole lot more than what we think
[54:41] justification means a whole lot more
[54:43] than just chopping off your pipes in
[54:48] that's what I've tried to get you to see
[54:50] that's what wages tried to get you sick
[54:52] remember he preached on this not too
[54:54] long ago the mysterious part of
[54:59] justification well what you mean
[55:01] mysterious part of just going to shuts
[55:03] off by saying there's a mysterious part
[55:09] because the bride is to be delivered
[55:11] from a new birth according to Malachi
[55:16] floor so this message is to bring you
[55:20] and me to an understanding of the new
[55:24] birth that has never been understood by
[55:26] mankind this message is to bring us to a
[55:38] new birth that mankind never understood
[55:49] so what is it
[55:52] [Music]
[55:54] what is this mysterious part it was
[55:58] something that was not revealed but yet
[56:02] it was spoke of all the way back through
[56:04] Ezekiel in his saying a new heart and a
[56:07] new spirit and I put my spirit he was
[56:09] explaining this mystery but do we
[56:16] understand it I'm talking about a
[56:20] mystery I'm talking about something that
[56:23] nobody before this prophet came had it
[56:27] in its total clarity because in the Old
[56:30] Testament they could not bring those
[56:33] things to the right order because they
[56:36] were not born again right see but when
[56:43] the Prophet came on the scene now what's
[56:45] where he lays these things out what is
[56:50] the mysterious part of justification
[56:52] what is the mysterious part of
[56:54] scientific ation what is the mysterious
[56:57] part of the baptism of the holy go what
[57:02] did we find justification to be we found
[57:10] it to be the chopping off of your past
[57:12] sins now that's been understood by
[57:19] everybody we taught in the Baptist that
[57:21] your sin for a ways we might not have
[57:23] told it as bad as justification but we
[57:26] taught it as you come in to the altar
[57:29] repenting of your sins and God takes
[57:31] away those sins from what that he puts
[57:34] it so far I can remember that until now
[57:37] even thinking about when the man coming
[57:39] he said and he took it so far he said
[57:41] not from the north to the south he said
[57:44] because that won't work he said but from
[57:47] the east to the West because there's no
[57:49] stopping and starting point from east to
[57:52] the west north and south got to stop and
[57:53] born the east to the west thing got no
[57:56] stopping born because you just go right
[57:58] back around right
[58:04] there's no stopping in Spartan from
[58:07] these to it so that's why the scripture
[58:09] says that our sins are put in the sea of
[58:12] forgetfulness never to be remembered no
[58:17] more as far as the east is to the west
[58:25] which is no stopping and starting so
[58:29] whatever he done with my sins they still
[58:31] cannot be brought against me because
[58:35] there in his seal forgetfulness the
[58:41] justification is a great thing but what
[58:45] about when your prophet come into it
[58:48] let's run through this in a hurry where
[58:50] you can get it caught see I'm trying to
[58:52] put this here and then we'll drop back
[58:56] you go to a little message where brother
[58:58] Brennan was talking about call the
[59:00] invisible union of the Bride of Christ
[59:04] I'd ask you to do that go to that
[59:08] message and listen to it late I can't
[59:13] listen Oh master get out ain't nobody
[59:15] gonna tell me what do okay you flunked
[59:20] algebra yeah they they had a teacher
[59:24] over banks County that she was real good
[59:28] at algebra and anybody that studied
[59:31] under her were taught knots in algebra
[59:34] the bird she would flunk you in a hurry
[59:39] they called her flunking Duncan because
[59:43] that was her last name was Duncan and
[59:45] bird she would flunk you on that if you
[59:49] didn't do what was right she didn't have
[59:51] no halfway between didn't know good to
[59:53] take an apple to try to get her on your
[59:55] side she was straight but those who
[1:00:00] believed and stayed with her
[1:00:02] come forth is to be in great algebra
[1:00:04] masters right because the way she was
[1:00:07] doing all right but see justification
[1:00:12] what does it do it jumps off our pie
[1:00:13] sins go to the invisible union
[1:00:17] and listen to it it would take the whole
[1:00:21] book for me to express as I'm asking you
[1:00:24] to and if you ain't got enough in you to
[1:00:27] go study that message then you don't
[1:00:29] care what's being said then you don't
[1:00:31] know what brother Brahim said the in
[1:00:35] that message he covers justification is
[1:00:38] chopping off your PI sins in that
[1:00:45] message he goes on to cover
[1:00:47] justification was the fact of what you
[1:00:54] were guilty of doing it you done it but
[1:00:59] it was as though you never done it
[1:01:01] because God took it away study that from
[1:01:04] that message of invisible Union it was
[1:01:07] though you never done it stage 2 stage 3
[1:01:12] of justification is that you are so pure
[1:01:18] and clean that the real you never done
[1:01:21] it note invisible Union study the
[1:01:24] message you claim to believe the prophet
[1:01:27] go study the message what do you think I
[1:01:31] got it have to teach this wrong from the
[1:01:34] invisible Union because an invisible
[1:01:36] Union he covers that your sins are
[1:01:38] chopped off then he covers that it says
[1:01:41] though you never done it because he took
[1:01:45] your place and put your sins in the sea
[1:01:47] I forget them but see the real you which
[1:01:50] is not you as a human being the real you
[1:01:52] is the person of the baptism of the Holy
[1:01:54] Ghost
[1:01:54] living in your soul right the real you
[1:01:59] is the new birth that new birth never
[1:02:03] did sin we done all of them things but
[1:02:08] you can't make him a sinner so
[1:02:11] mysterious part of justification or that
[1:02:19] we taught off your chopping off you PI
[1:02:20] sins sure we tried to bring it up a
[1:02:23] little further and talk about the sea of
[1:02:26] his forgetfulness never to be
[1:02:30] remember no more but you see your
[1:02:33] prophet started right there and took it
[1:02:35] on the showing that the real you the
[1:02:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:42] never did sin that's why the Bible says
[1:02:47] that his seed remaineth in you you
[1:02:49] cannot sin but brother Dale brother Brad
[1:02:52] who said Christians in where do you sin
[1:02:56] as a Christian you better not be sinning
[1:03:01] from the soul cause you're sinning from
[1:03:03] the soul you and Christian you better
[1:03:06] get out there in that spirit room in
[1:03:08] your memories and start to see in from
[1:03:10] that point so then the Bible's right the
[1:03:13] prophets right what it's impossible he
[1:03:16] said for a Christian to sin then he
[1:03:19] turns around and says accreted only one
[1:03:21] who can't sin he's here all know he was
[1:03:25] teaching it correctly repentance chops
[1:03:34] off that high sins does nothing to your
[1:03:37] nature anything so you see it a
[1:03:45] mysterious part now for no draw hide
[1:03:50] that I am could come up years ago and
[1:03:53] bring those things 40 years ago how much
[1:03:59] more did your prophet understand about
[1:04:01] the real meaning of justification what
[1:04:11] do you mean I mean if he's put RCA's
[1:04:15] send him to see if forgetfulness
[1:04:17] they can't be remembered no more that's
[1:04:20] a pretty good state of saint of
[1:04:22] justification don't you think so and the
[1:04:25] Bible says those who he's justified what
[1:04:27] he hath already glory thought if you
[1:04:35] were genuine and repented of your sins
[1:04:39] they were chopped off if you're genuine
[1:04:43] you were to go
[1:04:44] you'll go on and prove that you'll be
[1:04:47] glorified one day you've got a journey
[1:04:49] to travel to but you prove you're right
[1:04:51] if you're genuine Christian
[1:04:57] sanctification see sanctification like
[1:05:04] justification is taught in three stages
[1:05:11] sanctification is a cleansing and
[1:05:14] setting aside right
[1:05:18] you were cleansed and set aside because
[1:05:23] that's what sanctification does what you
[1:05:27] see the Apostle Paul then after getting
[1:05:30] the new birth he taught a sanctification
[1:05:36] more than just a cleansing he taught a
[1:05:40] daily sanctification Paul taught after
[1:05:48] you're born again but I've got born
[1:05:50] again I don't need to be sanctified no
[1:05:51] more hey that's where we put her big
[1:05:56] mouth up and we run it instead of
[1:05:59] listening to what he say it let's listen
[1:06:04] to what he's saying look at number seven
[1:06:12] let's see what this Apostle Paul
[1:06:15] understood about sanctification first
[1:06:25] Corinthians 15 31 I protest by your
[1:06:28] rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus
[1:06:31] our Lord
[1:06:33] daily when he's already born again what
[1:06:40] do you need to die for because what we
[1:06:43] do every day what do we need to repent
[1:06:45] for for what we do every day okay let's
[1:06:51] see what the prophets say go ahead to
[1:06:54] number eight
[1:06:57] days of our life but we are buns slaves
[1:07:01] to Jesus Christ we are slaves of joy I'm
[1:07:06] so glad that I got shackles only that
[1:07:10] shackles me away from the things of the
[1:07:12] world that I could become a slave to
[1:07:15] Jesus Christ to serve Him in love in you
[1:07:20] and my brothers and sisters who are like
[1:07:22] precious faith who's been born of the
[1:07:26] Holy Ghost
[1:07:27] well that's left us open oh come on
[1:07:30] read what he says this had the blood of
[1:07:33] Jesus Christ to sanctify and cleanse you
[1:07:36] from all the filth of the world that
[1:07:38] died daily to your flesh crucified
[1:07:48] putting it away and becoming a slave to
[1:07:53] your own body to serve God we look for a
[1:07:56] city to come sanctification is a
[1:08:04] cleansing and setting aside within after
[1:08:07] you're born again Paul talk about daily
[1:08:10] sanctification Stage one is chopping off
[1:08:13] you is a cleansing and setting aside
[1:08:16] stage two comes up to a daily
[1:08:21] sanctification there you need these
[1:08:24] Loretta Brennan said I die daily and if
[1:08:28] Paul had to die daily how much more am i
[1:08:32] I'm going to have to stay there dead all
[1:08:35] the time if Paul had to die daily to
[1:08:40] stay with God so we'll all have to do
[1:08:43] that just die out to ourselves and
[1:08:47] that's getting God's Way how many of you
[1:08:51] want I mean these you want me to read
[1:08:56] die daily where we got to keep in
[1:09:02] revival constantly revived ever day
[1:09:10] Paul said he had to die daily for Christ
[1:09:15] that Christ could live and we must never
[1:09:19] let that revival die cuz we do that's
[1:09:22] your revival that's what I've tried to
[1:09:24] explain to you I have a revival every
[1:09:26] day but it's through the washing of the
[1:09:28] water or the word the studying of God's
[1:09:33] Word should bring us a revival every day
[1:09:36] in our hearts and lives to realize what
[1:09:40] he does to love us you've got to repent
[1:09:43] and die daily to live in Jesus Christ so
[1:09:46] every day every day you got to die every
[1:09:50] day to live in Jesus brother Branham we
[1:10:01] have problems number thirteen contending
[1:10:05] for the faith we're tempted all of us
[1:10:09] are tempted all of us then there's none
[1:10:14] without sin every day you sin and Paul
[1:10:18] said he had to die daily and if we say
[1:10:23] that we sin and have no sin then the
[1:10:28] Bible says we make God to lie okay we
[1:10:37] didn't teach too much of that and the
[1:10:39] Baptist I don't know about y'all where
[1:10:40] you come from and how much and the
[1:10:43] Pentecostals they talk that are dying
[1:10:45] daily but Paul taught it so the first
[1:10:51] stage of sanctification is one lens and
[1:10:56] set aside for service second stage is to
[1:10:59] keep us clean what's the third stage of
[1:11:04] sanctification run cities in the seals
[1:11:09] so Wade covered it what is
[1:11:11] sanctification under the seal there's
[1:11:15] going to be a cleansing of this whole
[1:11:17] world under the sixth seal
[1:11:24] now there's a sanctification under the
[1:11:26] sixth seal that the Bible covers that we
[1:11:31] didn't know anything about called we
[1:11:32] didn't know anything about the seals but
[1:11:36] the prophet knew about it and covered it
[1:11:38] for us then we can die daily right
[1:11:45] a mysterious part a mysterious part is
[1:11:50] that God can cleanse this world until it
[1:11:54] can be lived on a mysterious part that
[1:12:00] he can so cleanse you and I until he can
[1:12:03] come and live in us and take us in a
[1:12:06] rapture okay gotta get in hurry baptism
[1:12:12] of the Holy Ghost three stages of the
[1:12:18] baptism of the Holy Ghost according to
[1:12:20] Romans 8 you can go ahead and pull it
[1:12:23] Romans 8 you want to know that's that
[1:12:27] would be 14 only Roman eight Romans
[1:12:33] eight covers three things the new birth
[1:12:38] to make us children of God that were so
[1:12:47] much until we've become his offspring
[1:12:51] Romans eight but then there is a point
[1:12:55] of adoption in Romans eight that brings
[1:12:59] us to a place that was never taught by
[1:13:02] mankind to understand with a part of
[1:13:05] adoption to where we see who we are and
[1:13:09] what's taking place we'll get into that
[1:13:12] in Statue of a perfect man but you see
[1:13:14] one day this world even will get such a
[1:13:17] fiery baptism until it will burn off all
[1:13:22] sin and burn all demons all things that
[1:13:26] go would be done by baptism of fire but
[1:13:31] that was what I was talking about the
[1:13:32] other day see that baptism a fire that
[1:13:35] comes into you cleanse
[1:13:36] got all the devil's that's in there they
[1:13:38] know Devils left in your soul if you
[1:13:42] have the new birth and it'll so cleanse
[1:13:47] us until we're going to be delivered of
[1:13:50] a new birth from according to Malachi 4
[1:13:56] Paul goes on to 23rd for the earnest
[1:13:59] expectation of the creature waiteth for
[1:14:01] the manifestation of the sons of God
[1:14:03] that's adoption right what are these the
[1:14:07] children are supposed to understand
[1:14:08] because the creature itself also shall
[1:14:10] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:14:12] corruption into the glorious liberty of
[1:14:14] the children of God where we know that
[1:14:16] the whole creation groaneth and
[1:14:18] travaileth in pain together until now
[1:14:23] because something's got to happen and
[1:14:25] not only they but ourselves also which
[1:14:28] have the firstfruits of the Spirit even
[1:14:30] we ourselves groan within ourselves
[1:14:32] waiting for the adoption to wit to
[1:14:40] understand or to set into motion and get
[1:14:42] it into what what the redemption of the
[1:14:45] body you see justification of
[1:14:49] sanctification the baptism when Holy
[1:14:51] Ghost then it is a mystery under the
[1:14:53] seals your prophet took in that mystery
[1:14:56] us all the way to the change of the body
[1:15:03] right the Prophet took the message in
[1:15:07] the seals all the way to the change of
[1:15:09] the body because that's the last thing
[1:15:12] that were to have is a body change cause
[1:15:18] then we'll go into glory
[1:15:21] you see one down mad the Prophet said a
[1:15:24] mysterious part so there was things it
[1:15:27] was not understood about the
[1:15:28] justification sanctification and the
[1:15:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost but the
[1:15:36] Prophet brought it and showed it to us
[1:15:44] by that can we be delivered of a new
[1:15:47] birth well bro down I didn't know we
[1:15:51] hadn't have a new birth we gotta have a
[1:15:53] birth of the message of the age not
[1:15:57] another birth to go back and be born
[1:16:00] again but a point of being truly
[1:16:09] completely born again I've always taught
[1:16:13] you one thing let's see I mean ever can
[1:16:15] remember it with our body soul and
[1:16:20] spirit it's totally redeemed surely you
[1:16:24] can say I have the new birth
[1:16:28] you remember that that's 4050 years I've
[1:16:31] been preaching that because that's what
[1:16:32] I believe that if we come to the place
[1:16:36] that were so cleansed and set aside so
[1:16:41] filled with that baptism when the Holy
[1:16:43] Ghost hang on just a second come on
[1:16:51] musician let me read this likes to cuz
[1:16:54] you see I love these I didn't give them
[1:16:59] this black bear when the message oneness
[1:17:05] 1962 but God wants to feel every fiber
[1:17:13] of his church he wants to feel you're
[1:17:17] thinking he wants to feel your mind he
[1:17:21] wants to feel every bit of you just make
[1:17:25] you completely totally dead to yourself
[1:17:30] or to your thinking just surrender in
[1:17:34] God till his word just living it right

[1:18:06] powers of the enemy and feel every fiber

[1:18:15] believe it
[1:18:16] so you said well brother Dale the what
[1:18:18] are you looking for I'm looking for such
[1:18:20] a baptism and the Holy Ghost to come
[1:18:22] that it'll fill every fiber of our being

[1:18:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost a revealed
[1:18:31] word come on what is the baptism of the
[1:18:35] Holy go the word made alive so that's
[1:18:40] what I've always told the alive word
[1:18:42] will change these beings that we are the
[1:18:45] prophets brought the message we don't
[1:18:49] have to look for anything in that we
[1:18:51] have the message we are to be delivered
[1:18:53] of a new birth from the message that we
[1:18:57] are in this age of Malecha for the fill
[1:19:03] every fiber of our being in tuck us in
[1:19:04] the rapture yeah I look for something to
[1:19:09] take place yes

[1:20:08] an earthquake terminology every time you
[1:20:11] go up one number you go ten times the
[1:20:17] number seven is ten times more powerful
[1:20:20] than a number six
[1:20:24] come on study your science a little ten
[1:20:28] times and the six will flatten city or
[1:20:33] seven ten times take it apart the only
[1:20:47] part where we had less time
