scriptures turn back where we've been reading in Romans 8 and we'll try to have just speak and try to I want to just comment for a little bit and then have questions and answers so you you get them down and and everything and get ready and we'll try to cover questions and answers thoughts of what it's you know being said and because I want to make sure you understand me and and know what I'm trying to say but just remember each one remember the uh there will be a a Bible study I mean excuse me a ministers meeting I'm writing my old notes uh ministers meeting will this be this coming Saturday up at brother Bill Y and Wade and them's going up and we took up an offering it was something over $700 so I just had the lease of the dist toct increase it on up to $1,000 where we could give it to brother Bill you know we've done giving him one offering and now we give him another one so maybe we're helping him a little bit you know but remember that then the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday at brother lorus if you have any if you want to go along with us let us know we'll be leaving about 10:30 on Saturday morning to let us know and and you know ride with us and have a good time uh I know you've already prayed but remember sister Anna Canard she came to the operation the doctor doctor said it was a a good operation he said I I say it was real good you know he was he was really seemed to be pleased himself about it and only took about 3 hours as far as the actual operational part you know so it must have been everything must have went real good but he said he really thought everything would be all right and she is they've already I think tried to take the tubes out they're doing the different things with her so just keep praying for her she'll have a lot to to do she didn't know she had that and uh you know it was I think she had three blockages 180 and 290 I believe was right I'm not certain but anyhow uh she was walking Time Bomb you wouldn't have thought it by looking at her and and seeing her and doing but yet you know if things had went wrong somewhere she would had a lot of trouble so we thank God he's always on the scene to take care of everything we we believe it right so just remember that I mean any other announcements I generally Miss some but no more all right de Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us thank you for being with sister Anna our Lord and taking care of her because we know even in that case like that and if we don't know what's wrong with us then Satan has the upper hand cuz he can sneak things in on us but we thank you for doctors we thank you for all of these things that to where that we can go and and have these things that are in the old human body fixed cuz we're just kind of like an old car sometimes Parts run out and we need them replaced or or repaired so we thank you that you've given us doctors and things to to help us and Lord we just ask you to guide and be with sister Anna now as she will be in the recovery time and I'm sure it will be a horrible time of of sufferings and things but as Terrence prayed we pray that the pain will be gone and everything will be all right we love you and we thank you we commit it all to you Lord now have your way as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen Romans 8 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also just Justified and whom he justified then he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word I had a had to go for a a little checkup this week and I got a real good report doctor said everything was in good shape come on back in 6 months you know and all like that but I was kidding him because you know I appreciate doctors and things but they're just like we are if you just be friends with them and things and I was talking to him about something and he said well you know I said well I do a little bit of what you tell me and maybe not everything but he said well people do 80% of what the doctor says he said of course my wife she does 5% of what I tell her I said well that's about right you know but you know but then he was checking my spleen out and he's dumping the cross you know I said what are you dumping on there far he said well I can tell where it's firm I said I thought you was doing that just so you could maybe show us you you know kind of make us think you know what you're doing he just ding life and you know cuz he he really likes for me to come in he always says I appreciate you coming cuz I just I'm just the same there as I am here I just say thank you Lord and everything's all right amen all right now let's just come in a little while and then we'll get into the questions and answers but I want to make sure you understand me and then that way you can ask the questions of of the things you know and and we started off about 16 17 Services ago talking about how does God predestinate all right we found that he predestines because predestination now he predestines by for knowledge all right and predestination see has to do with with uh Life Time Etc because it means uh a destiny set so you're not going back way back that's why I appreciate the way the prophet said it he said you know that predestination looks back to for knowledge right and he said then for knowledge looks to Destiny see and that that way you don't have to to worry because predestination is actually dealing with something within a time frame or U you know things like that and that's why I said all along why would we want to get into so much on predestination and try to stop on it why can't we just keep on going back into the mind of God and that's what we've been doing for weeks you know to go back and see that you know that he even uh he predestines not by desire because he desired that everybody be saved but he predestinated by his for knowledge now you understand what I'm saying so so I'm trying to make blunt statements tonight and then go on and I'm going to make this blunt statement people think that I try to bring a topic a lot of times to argue about what's being taught in the message line of the people uh you know now when when I get to that that that's all I'm doing then you don't have to worry about sitting me down I'll just quit but I'm trying to help you and I righten not to try to just argue with somebody about what they're saying cuz you're not going to convince anybody anyway that's right I mean it's the holy spirit's going to going to convince people he's going to have to show it to them and and I don't matter what you say it's not going to convince them and see I'm trying to get you and I to see how perfect a message amen that we have been given that's right to me it is the word of God that has been given to you and I even understand predestination right amen and to understand like I saying that predestination that has to do with something down here something that's predetermined to take place or or an action or event when we went on back into the for knowledge back his brother R said Christ the Myster of God reveal back into the back part of God's mind the word that he had had a plan and he had a purpose right Amen in that he wanted to see it achieved what to to bring forth his attributes right all right and his attributes is Father Son and Holy Ghost all right so then everything that we have to deal with would deal with that within that Father Son and Holy Ghost you know in in our doings in life but predestination see it's not a bad word then once you see that it's dealing with something that's set predetermined all right whereas for knowledge is dealing with knowledge before amen an event transpires all right then we went back into and spent quite lengthly time talking about the mind of God and I told you in the messages there that Judas is car was in the mind of God right amen he was thought of as coming to Earth and and being what he would be and Jacob and Esau was but see I don't want to just be part of what he thought of I've tried for 40 something years to get you to see I want to be part of the Thinker right all right so we got even into the part that we titled messages and and talked about it is called part of God and we found out to be part of God right is not to be a second person or a third person or something but to be the person of God made manifest in the form of the Bride or the form of his children his offspring right and that way then we could look at it and and not have to to deny some of the things the prophet has said or the scriptures that would say and we read there in the scripture where it says that that those who he forew he did predestinate or did for know he did predestinate well then we won't have to deal with nothing we know what it is he predestines by his for knowledge but yet are we going to say that God could not set back before the world as the infinite God that we've read over and over and over are we going to say he couldn't sit back and know what would transpire on Earth amen once we would get here right right amen I mean you're you're belittling God you're making him down to where he's like you and I he can change his mind he can do things I don't believe that I believe before the foundation of the world and in his mind he could look through all time and see everything that would ever transpire am that's right all right and then you remember now one point we brought out that we were chosen in him yes not to say we were chosen by him because being chosen by him would be him picking out people but if we're chosen in him then all we got to do is make sure we're in Christ or make sure Christ is in us right and see then that way we don't have to worry about it we don't have to deny any quote or any thought we can believe it now when I get into the questions please do this much for me we get into questions I haven't covered anything on the seed yet all right seed s e e d so don't if you ask questions about the seed I'm going to try to just say I I don't choose to speak on that you know because I haven't brought out the things I want you to see about it so hold your point away from that it doesn't matter me with me if you say what are you talking about that's no problem you know but just stay away from from some seed form because we'll get to that eventually and then we'll have questions and answers about that all right but see looking back in seeing that we were chosen in him amen right chosen in him so when he was chosen we were chosen we being a part of him then when the prophet would say if you have eternal life you always was eternal well I have no problems with that quote see I had no troubled with believing then that I wasn't back there as a person as some form of identity the prophet even said were we Spirits he said no we were only in his thinking right all right and see then going back into the mind of God we can go back and see that he had thoughts he had attributes and the prophet says we're his attributes on display all right then I have no problem with saying well I don't believe that anything you're looking at here was in any way in God in the beginning right I don't believe that now I do believe that the body we're in is the body we're going to be in amen all right right I do believe in that I believe in it being made Eternal amen but yet not in this condition and then when you start trying to predestinate see then if you don't go on back P's predestination you're saying that God chose wrong because you got to admit there's a lot of people that are not going to have eternal life well did he choose wrong did he choose one and not choose the other or did he look down and see what we would choose all right and we're going to come back to that because you'll see me the Lord willing Sunday will start on our journey back toward time because we haven't for the past few messages we haven't been dealing with time we've been dealing with eternal life and that's why I believe in eternal life I believe that by the new birth you receive eternal life in your soul amen and that eternal life always was eternal that doesn't mean I was because it was given right we believe that Adam was given eternal life don't we right according to Blasphemous names right right then if Adam was given eternal life then it means it was time he didn't have it right you say what but but down in there there was a little seed of eternal life there's where the point is see a little seed of eternal life life and that changes your whole entire thought when you start dealing with the seed all right now think about what I'm saying by for knowledge we can go back past any point of what we would think of predetermining because we can go back into the very Mind Of God Amen and we can see that God had children he had all of his attributes right amen right you remember all those quotes he had all of his attributes before he ever started he didn't gain an attribute coming this way he displayed the attributes coming this way right he always was a Healer he always was a savior well then he always had in his mind that he was going to bring forth his children right he didn't start thinking about it somewhere so you're limiting God he said well brother Dale then if you think that way it it it looks like there was something of us back there the only part that was back there that I know of is eternal life and I had to receive that by a new birth and then I kept emphasizing a lot on that if we believe we come with eternal life then Jesus Christ never he died in vain God didn't have to die to release life to redeem you and I right but you see that's where people just take quotes right and they'll just quote quote quote quote quote and people get tied up into their thinking and and they don't know what the answer is amen right I believe that almighty God was one time self-existing amen all right which meant he existed alone right all right now but I believe the eternal life that he has always existed amen not had or have he is eternal life all right I I I look and I'll try to give it after a while but brother R talking about and you'll say a lot of time eternal life through Jesus Christ but he talking about the person of eternal life so I don't believe eternal life is what I don't believe we understand it I believe we think it's some baptism of the Holy Ghost well that's that's what it is isn't it if you're talking about the soul but you can have the genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day of your life and d and to hell right is that the words of the Prophet all right so then we don't deal with that but if we ever have eternal life that eternal life always was eternal amen that's sensible see then putting it to the basis that if we can byy by The Prophet's message and and and the Bible and things we've been able to to back up into God's mind and see that God he dwelt alone but the prophet said he'll never dwell alone again right that's what I love why because his attributes are being displayed amen right and that's who we are right but brother Dale you don't think we was back there as people no I do not I do not believe in the Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of Souls I believe in pre-existence of eternal life amen amen not pre-existence of people we'll get to it when we get over that the prophet said it was not the person that come predestinated eternally from God but to seed our word so then the persons that we are that's the prophet where we Spirits he said no you would nothing you was in his mind and he said I gave you the quote he said not your being but to form or shape of the infinite God so I have no problems believing that the children of God are his very Offspring amen all right we don't believe in Eternal sunship right amen but we believe in Eternal godship amen amen you remember that I believe in an eternal godhead to Prophet says but not an eternal son all right so then I don't want to just be a son the way our terms of doing and speaking and now come on we've been through the message I know the Bible will talk about sons of God I know the Bible I know the prophet talking about sons of God but is that word son there is it meaning Eternal sunship come on cuz it can't be true but I believe the Eternal God was made manifest in human flesh that's right right the Eternal God was made manifest in human flesh called a son amen and see that person never had a beginning or never had an ending amen you hear Brother Rand on who is this mchz he said mesic had no beginning end he said but Jesus Christ had a beginning he said had a time that he started right amen he was a time when he was born but he said I don't believe in Eternal sunship I believe in Eternal godship amen God is the only one that's Eternal and we must have his own life that's why we don't believe in Hell being Eternal because if hell is eternal God would have to put his life into hell and that won't work even death and hell both will be destroyed in the Lake of Fire all right so we don't we don't wor with that part but now what predestinated in him are chosen in him not chosen of him you get it into predestination backing up P's predestination into four knowledge we can begin to determine then that that eternal life that we have by the new birth was just as Eternal as God is or is the the life of God and that's what makes us the children of God come on I'm I'm hitting these in for later on but the prophet said we did not become seed by the new birth right he said we were seed that's why we could be born again y all right so we got a lot to go on the seed when we get to it right so just hang on you say well I just don't understand what's your point of what you're saying my whole point of one thing that I preached for 17 sermons is one thing I do not believe that any part of you and I Body Spirit and soul came into the world Eternal amen that's right yeah the prophet would talk about a spot of eternal life there's a lot of difference in the spot of eternal life and the person of eternal life amen cuz see you're going to put eternal life in your soul and that's the same doctrine of the two Soul people amen yeah that Doctrine is older as I am nearly it's 40 some years ago and the man taught that if you could be born again you had two Souls one from God one from the devil amen and all you had to do was kill that old soul from the devil because that other Soul didn't need anything it always was eternal but if you was never going to be born again you only had one Soul coming from the devil well I told him then I said you're making the devil a Creator and the devil can't create he can't give you a soul he perverts the nature of your soul yes right that's why he must be Chast cast out all right then looking at it in the straight line of what we see we don't believe that people were back there we believe God existed alone amen I know I've told you this statement over and over I said you believe in predestination I was predestinated well then you just predestinated yourself out of existence because we've already shown by the prophet in the Bible you can go back to forn knowledge which is way back past predestination so if all you can go is predestination you're Ling somewhere because you're going to have to stay somewhere he predestinated you right I don't believe he predestinated us I believe we are him made manifest in another form called a bride called a Sons and Daughters of God called his offspring that's right amen and God knew whether not you'd want to be saved so we had it ready for us when we got here eternal life is a person amen this is not a thought or an idea or a concept A Doctrine eternal life is a person right and that's where most people know nothing about that they don't know anything about the person of God right well brother I I just believe what the prophet said well Keep On Believing it but keep on reading right and I'm not saying this but for one reason it's truth well the problem is is people trying to figure out what brother Brown is saying without following the channel that God sends which is a five-fold Ministry I don't need no five-fold Ministry I'll get it for myself go go right ahead you're going to get it all around just go ahead God sent a five-fold Ministry he predestinated a five-fold Ministry the B the five-fold ministry according to the Bible and the prophet is far the perfecting of the Saints right now I didn't write that but you know I believe it amen but I also believe it I'm not all of it I got a good understanding of that Bless but I believe I'm a part of it amen and I believe one thing I believe any fivefold Ministry person God has a word for you to bring right right well that's what Paul said Paul said the mystery who of I'm called his call was to bring the mystery of Jesus Christ to the people that's right a call is not a rooster crow into a mama call and daddy sent but predestination people trying to figure it out without having the gift to understand it by right you said well I don't have to depend on you no uhuh well because I'm not sent to you if you don't have to depend on me according to the Bible he said he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelist some pastors and some teachers now according to the Bible that's what he said it would happen well he gave some but if you don't want it that's all right you it won't stop me but it could stop you were you trying to scare me scare what yeah you can't scare people it done too far to be try to scare them used to be a day that you could preach against sin and people would weep their way to the altar now you preach against sin and they set turn life at you but listen see then predestination if we just believe in predestination we're stopping the understanding of the truth of of God's word amen because predestination means the time to start right a predetermined fact actor something to start well I'm talking about something that we'll get to it Sunday that they said to brother brandom said are you still preaching on that let's see new fangle religion or something he said no he said I'm preaching the oldest religion that ever was that's right he said I'm preaching about the morning Stars saying together and the sons of God shouted for Joy he said I'm way back before the world ever begun in what I believe so I believe that you and I are a part of God amen amen Jesus was the fullness of the godhead bodily you and I cannot be but the prophet said God is not complete without you amen so if we have eternal life then God is not complete without that eternal life would you show me how that eternal life in any person can reject the word of God right no but you know what people say well I just don't like your attitude I I can't prove you wrong but I just don't like your attitude don't worry about it my attitude has nothing to do with you God will judge my attitude I have to answer to him for my attitude but I don't have to answer to him for the word amen the word stands true amen going back then to see predestinated in his thinking the prophet said we were only only in his thinking I gave that to you the other day only in his thinking well why do you want to go back why not stay where we're at and let eternal life be a part of us here see I don't believe we're understanding the message it can't be contrary to the word there's no way and when Paul would say those who he for know he did predestinate that saws that yeah amen predestination wasn't first for knowledge was first amen but even for knowledge of our existence upon Earth there's still a way on back behind our that we've been covering you see church that's why I believe it and I've told you and I put it out here now in front of you I believe if you have eternal life that you receive that eternal life by the new birth amen yes sir and that eternal life is the life of almighty God amen amen and that eternal life is the children of God that he had in him now listen that he had in him or was a part of him when he was self-existing amen now now now that can't be now well you haven't been listening to what I've preached that eternal life is part of the self-existing that's right where do we get to where the morning star sang together sons of God shouted for Joy the prophet said they shouted and seeing the Plan of Redemption that's what he says we better lay down our thinking and back up in to the prophet's message you know and his thinking and doing and believing it and realized it being an attribute of God means I'm part of God but now that's just too much being God well now you tell me what the Bible said the Bible say you're the sons of God he says you're Gods right hey we have to explain it then don't we we're little Gods because none of us are the fullness right but Jesus was the fullness but you put all of us together and we're join ours with him the Bible say ours of God and join ours with Jesus Jesus Christ whatever he has we have it amen that's why in the body of Christ the prophet of God could cover all the five-fold ministry you agree with that right he could be all of those things to the bride of Christ but none of us can be those things I don't care who the five4 ministry person is if you try to push yourself to the point of trying to make yourself greater than anybody else in the fivefold ministry other than the gift of what you got look what you're doing that's Satan's tactics yeah but but brother Dale don't you think Satan could get in and and and try to make you get to the point do you think that you're something well don't you you think you're something is there any problem don't you think that you are a child of God right amen then you are something right am predestinated in him what would it be then not you're being here with the shape and form at the infinite God we wasn't back there except the eternal life that we now have that eternal life was back there before the world amen amen cuz that's the life of God right I asked you a question or two during the series up to work where we're at I ask you where we chosen of him or in him were we chosen were we chosen by him or or in him which way is it you see then that way we can look at the truth of the word of God and say thank you Lord I now know who I am I'm going child of God a child of God is just like Jesus was a child of God Jesus wasn't a second person third person or even the first person he was the person he was almighty God made manifest in flesh amen what are You and I by the new birth we are almighty God made manifest best in human flesh you understand what I've been driving at for months and months now look at it eternal life and believing that we are his children his children your children are not somebody else's children your children are yours they're part of you that's just a scratch in the surface of a thought for being a child of God that's why those Old Testament Saints I've taught you those Old Testament Saints never had eternal life in their soul as a new birth because Jesus Christ had not died yet to release the life right they were under the blood of bulls and goats and that blood of bulls and goats couldn't bring them eternal life but on the day of Pentecost eternal life came into being amen as the children of God Amen his offspring all right I got one but I'll have to paraphrase it because I left my notepad laying at home on the desk and I've been looking at it today and I was asked a question I'll cover it and then we'll get to the question so get the microphone and and I want you to comment and questions and everything we don't get to we'll just take it up Sunday but I was asked a question about eternal life and said if we have eternal life by the new birth you know and I believe we do said then what about the life of the foolish virgins do they receive eternal life I believe the foolish virgins at the white Throne judgment will receive eternal life am but they have nothing to do with receiving it right it's simply an impartation of eternal life because of what they done or didn't do or whatever you know right and those Old Testament Saints will come up and have to be judged and they'll receive eternal life if they've been true but that'll never make them what the Bride of Jesus Christ is amen even the 144,000 that receive eternal life while here on Earth they will never be part of the Bride right that's the wonderful part you said wases that make us something brother Dale we it it just makes us look now we don't if you think it makes you something to look down on somebody else you don't have eternal life I have no problem with saying that I don't care who you are me or who if you look down on somebody else to think you're greater than they are no it is he that hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people and the Sheep of his Pastor whatever he is I mean yeah whatever he is I am those foolish virgins have to have have to get eternal life one day all right the question went on was asking about the you know would the world become Eternal I believe it will you can argue that point backwards and forth but it's all right I believe this world one day will be made Eternal also because my body came out of it and I know my body be made Eternal and I believe this world will be made Eternal that's why the future home can come down upon on as the prophet calls it in the future home he saw this holy city the New Jerusalem descending like a com like a A or a dove coming out of Heaven settling Upon A redeemed entire Earth amen he came up on Jesus Christ to redeem that body amen took three and 1/2 years but it was finished in the resurrection and the the Ascension and the change all right it was made Eternal because his body was not Eternal while he was here on Earth right then this world will be made Eternal I believe that because of the scriptures in in Isaiah 65:17 says for behold I create new heavens and a new Earth and the former things shall not be remembered not come into mine I create new heavens and new earth all right Revelations 21 and5 says and he that sat upon the throne said behold I make all things new amen coming to eternal life what a beautiful place will it be the Millennium won't be an eternal World it will be a time element creature amen it would be swept off and cleansed Satan will be bound for a thousand years but the Millennium it won't be Eternal in time it'll be in time that's why it is the Millennium and that's why it's in the seventh day because we have a millenum to prove the sin curses gone because the Bible back in the beginning said in the day you eat thereof that day you'll die so there's going to be a thousand years to lived upon Earth by somebody but just remember it won't be me and you because we're already made Eternal all right you see then when it's all finished then this world gets a fiery baptism to be cleanse off everything amen and down comes the future home Amen to a redeemed Earth you said well well what about the Kings coming in and out well that's no problem is it now you can argue a point or think about wondering if the kings of the Earth would be Eternal I have no problems believing they will be maybe you don't that's all right and I believe that they will be at the white Throne given eternal life cuz it says there to White Throne enter you into the joys of the Lord prepared prepared for you before the foundation of the world that's even speaking to the foolish virgins and things it looks so close until it looks so much like it and we used to think that we'd have to stand before the white Throne right but it's not so amen but the Bride is a CH chosen people royal priesthood chosen generation remember Sunday offering spiritual sacrifices or eternal life all will be made new you say well it's just made new you know well that's that's what I said that's that's what you think all right but I think when it's made new it be made eternal cu the prophet said there won't be no Mounds on it for a body that's been buried there won't be no sin there won't be no uh serpent to be afraid of even in the Millennium a child put his hand on the hold of an asp and not be worried about it you know a deadly scorpions and things but Satan will be bound for that thousand years but what about when Satan is annihilated amen you ask me I tell you my opinion that I believe one day all will be made new amen if it's so beautiful in the Millennium until it'll be a great thing what about in the future H what about it then I was asked the question in the Bible study and I answered is as honest as I could said where was God at you know before before the world before everything see I believe he was real I don't believe he was just like the wind blowing just I believe he was real I believe he was a whole lot more real than we're real that's right and why couldn't you say well he was back there in the future home no problem but I'm not saying that's a Doctrine that's an idea he lives somewhere the Bible says Heaven is my throne and Earth is my foot stol that's it see I mean he he he lived somewhere he was real cuz it wasn't a time that he come into existence he's real eternal life then to me is a wonderful thing am to think about living right here see people say well the sun Stood Still and this that and the other know well this is going to be the center of the universe cuz I think it is anyway the Earth is the center of the universe I don't care what science says because this is where God is going to dwell with his people that's right well that would be the center of the universe it wouldn't make no better what no matter what a universe was if it's where God is see God is real I believe he's a person the person that's right whole whole lot more real than you and I amen if a drunk would run into a gun to get away from a pink elephant that he sees in his mind how much more do you think that you and I would see God Jesus said one day he said if you've seen me you've seen the father amen who's got a question there was a couple of thoughts it's questional part be about eternal life who's got a question who'll be number one got a comment little on the question or could it be or a sister Susan I'm asking for so and so you know we'd get into that in the Bible study a lot she'll say so and so wants to know you know well that's fine we get the question any comments any thoughts questions s it says that God knew I wanted to be saved and he had it there for me the it was that the predestinated word no what now you go back go turn God knew that I wanted to be saved and so he had it here for me right and I'm wondering if that's that predestined that Eternal Word sure that's how that's how I had to come to be saved I had to hear word first he knew you'd want to be saved so he had eternal life for you he had eternal life for you and he had a word everybody's got a word I believe in that why I didn't want to get into word and Seed because that's messages but I believe every person I believe you got a word you have got something to make manifest right right Prophet said every age had a word you remember a few weeks ago maybe a month or so ago I mentioned that the Lord had showed me something about the change and Rapture and I said it'll be related we'll get to it eventually and I said you just remember Martin Luther probably preached on justification many many times times but one day it was made real amen right the prophet said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for said she'll be gone so if we realize where the word s not just letters on a page because that wasn't what was in the Bible to start with it's not letters on a page it's people right those people are those letters we are the word amen what arm and devil is not in the Bible no he said but what would take place when arm and devil would be on earth said that puts arm and devil in the Bible that what you talking about I have another one Satan is bound by circumstances um do you think that he will be roaming in the Millennium as he did in the garden but because the people all have the new birth in the Millennium he doesn't he doesn't have any control on okay so we'll have to clarify point so everybody's in the Millennium won't have the new birth all right and everybody said the Millennium W be part of the Bride that's right your uh 144,000 would be the Millennium I believe your Old Testament Jews as we call them the select of God will be in the Millennium right but then there'll be a heathen in the Millennium and there'll be a gospel to the Heathen in the Millennium right and that way I just don't believe everybody in the Millennium will be Eternal but I believe Satan is bound as the prophet said by Chain of circumstances he said he won't have anybody to work through right right you would say well is he wandering around or what is he doing him wondering around right now he can run all over he can run around me a thousand times it won't bother me long as he stays in that Dimension I'm in this one right right that don't bother me so you won't be able to make contact he will be uh taken away from the ability to pervert through the mind of mankind is way to say in the mind the mind of mankind will be totally pure amen even though it will be a person that's not Eternal as we'd say right but there'll be no way Satan can contact you he won't be able to argue with you amen he's bound away from us so what does it matter if he's in another dimension which is a few feet away doing what he wants to but it's not a a chain of circum I mean it's not a log chain it's a chain of circumstance there's nothing for him to work through you realize if you and I come to this to the right thing of sitting in a church listening to somebody preach the gospel you realize if we're locked in on what that person is saying and God is speaking to us through them that Satan has no ability that's right he can try all he wants to but he's cut out I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ will come to a place that like the prophet said he said Satan won't have nothing to do with you now he says that before the change said can we live so close to God to Satan he said yes that's right here right but you know our problem is is we we uh you know we get locked in on everything else and that's the reason I like to sit on the front row you know Butz I I don't like to see everything that's going on from the back row to the front right because it's distractive to my thinking so I'd rather sit on the front row amen yeah because I got a bad enough problem like it is you know I'm human right and I just don't want him to be able to work through me right see I realize some people have to sit with the back because of their children taking care of that's not not throwing off on nobody just telling it as a point I believe the bride of Christ before we go out of here we'll come to the basis that she won't be listening to the devil sir I believe that's taking place now that's right now I didn't say the devil couldn't talk to you I said you won't be listening to him right you remember a time when you wondered about the Trinity where it was right or not what was that the devil and beaten but now that's all settled right there's no way Satan could come in here and bring a sermon and he could bring people in it was dead right and they could be raised from the dead you think it would cause you and I to go back to a trinity no that's done sealed out go to we're sealed in is that what you told me anything else one more okay predestination looks to Destiny that can't really be preached on can I say that Vice over predestination looks toward Destiny but we can't preach on that cuz we don't know we can't go any further than brother brandom did with glad you said it that way I don't believe we'll go any further than brother brandham I don't believe that but you know what I do believe I believe we have been shown the future right we know what will be in the future home we know what will be in the Millennium which is a predestinated time over under away from us a time that will transpire we know what'll take place isn't that wonderful to be the Bride of Jesus Christ this message folks is not a Doctrine to me this message is God revealing himself it's not just a an idea or a concept it's Jesus Christ now speaking to his people things that he could never speak before that's right yes sir amen our mind is becoming unmodded I guess you'd say the word for it it's becoming straightened out enough to where we can at least think sensibly cuz that's the way I do I take something and I look at it and I say Well it can't be this cuz that won't work it can't be that cuz that won't work yeah well after a while I I'm taking the what you call all that where you you're you're canceling out things and I'm finally come to a place of saying well I got it down to two so now all I got to do is wait until the Lord show me which one of them's right CU I done took away what it can't be they can't be an eternal hell right right they can't be an eternal devil right they can't be an eternal sunship Xing them off they could be an eternal godhead and they can be an eternal godship I believe both of them's right I'm not trying to zero out which one of them is right I believe both of them's right do you understand what I'm saying church I wish I could get into words what is in my mind to try to tell people you realize we have the devil's answer I know what the prophet's talking about there where he said the Risen Lord Jesus Christ but that's what I'm talking about the Risen Lord Jesus Christ Living in you and I amen is the devil's answer the thing sister Gil it used to be confusing they're not as confusing anymore is that what you talking anything else all right who'll be next anybody else got a question comment Sister Sister kale I'm glad the Lord ask your own husband so I ask him a lot of this has been a wonderful series um I I mean it has just God has just shown me so much all of it the only thing that I that I'm wondering about I know we don't believe that we were bodies running back like I want but when somebody says the word pre-existence what comes to your mind to most people that say pre-existence it literally comes to my mind about bodies and things because that's where most people want their pre-existence is to be right some kind of a tangibility uh whatever you want to call call it if they wanted to move it into theophanes or whatever some kind of a bodies I believe a lot of people when they're saying pre-existence means pre-existence they believe they were you know what does it mean to you to me it means Eternal God is the only one that could pre-exist the eternal life that you have by the new birth is the only possible way that you could pre-exist but he was the only preexist exactly were we in his thoughts then right so we were all I can see how they people get confused though they want to make it something right that's all I want see you remember the message I said one day I was talking about and I said the ego see the ego of mankind whether it be Body Spirit that things what's it's tormenting people they want to be something I was the first one that said this as he goes what does it matter who says it the prophets already said it and God said it before he said it so we go back to the Eternal God and sister I believe that the eternal life that you have is not to just say we use terms as a part of God but how big is it you you can't do that it's a part of God's own life we go way back exactly we do I agree with you I'm trying to get us to see that that's the way back behind predestination that's what I've tried to get us to see that we go back past predestination predestination is not even in the picture predestination is what we're going to take up in in we'll have to take one or more message or two then we going to start predestination Destiny determined but we're walking our predestination into our destiny exactly exactly right I believe that go ahead go ahead is this thing is this Lord have mercy you know things go through your mind and and uh you know there's quotes quotes quotes and there's things I've read and things I think I've read and things I've heard people say but I you know I can't remember whether they true or not but did Brother B say when a bride realizes who she is she'll speak a world in existence and go live on it you're putting two quotes together okay well what did he say that's what he said but it's two quotes when the bride realizes who she is you know and what she's here for she'll be gone all right then there's another quote that says when the Bride Comes to the point he said if it wasn't for the god withholding from you and I a bar he said we would speak a world into existence and go live on it well see that's putting many many quotes and you know Jesus told him he says I go to prepare a place for you and it also talks about swear not by Heaven nor by Earth because Earth is his foot stol and that's what I walk around in you know and when he says things like that and the the real problem we I think we have today especially with people that don't understand uh or don't have your understanding or whatever is that when you talk about the creator of the universe verse living in your soul exactly then the first thought is well who do you think you are see and what you talking about the egos a while ago you know and to say that that doesn't that doesn't bother me to to say that it's ego wise or whatever like that but uh I don't say a lot of things because because people's going to say that right you know but you know when he said yeah you speak a world into existence when you come to that place that you can speak a world into existence what does that make you makes you the creator of God right but it just don't make you all of them no but still but still in all see he uh we were talking today sharing with Richard a little bit about I had a and I still do have a problem I talk with people and they say God this God that and God this and I said well what God you talking about and so I ask people I say uh if you had to Define almighty God uh what word would you use and you've heard me say this before and the word's Creator you know and and when and when brother bandham says when she realizes who she is is she'll speak a word into existence when she realizes that the baptism of Holy Ghost is the Lord Jesus Christ and it's not you speaking no no when we realize that no but it's coming out exactly but it is you speaking and he's gone he ain't going to speak it without you he's gone to prepare a place for me right he's preparing this thing right here exactly to live eternally exactly this is a powerful thing right but see I got I got people that of course I I just don't hang with message people I hang with with uh Mormons alcoholics drug addicts uh you name it you know I hang with them and when you talk to them you have to talk to them on their level sure that they can understand what you're saying sure and the only way you going to get you going to be able to do that is get out there and do it yeah sure but that we're coming I I I believe we're coming to a place amen I do am and you know if I say things that offend people and what have you but I I see things and I believe it's him showing me and and uh I don't want to get in anybody's way yeah so you know if I say things that doesn't seem right to you or whatever and you can't see what I'm talking about well you just forgive me so I'll let somebody else have some else to say who' be next you know that thing on the foolish virgin you talk about minut ago is the foolish virgins that goes along with whether you whether or not you can speak the world in existence or not see one of them one of them doesn't have they have they you know they've been saved they're they're they're they're virgins they're Christians they just don't have the allil they don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost they don't have him living in their life exactly in their soul and uh you know appreciate Brother Gary uh one of the quotes that you read it referred to brother bandam referred to God as having a form and you know some other quotes as well he said he's a being he lives in a house he's not like the wind could you comment just for a minute on before there was a world molecule Angel he was self-existing Elohim if his form if he would have allowed that form to be seen what do you think that we'd be looking at as far as the form that God existed before anything else was no problem with me sorry I believe that if you could go back so some way and see what was back there I'm questioning that way see that's why I believe is real I believe you would see the person of Jesus Christ standing there see if I didn't believe it that way I'd have troubles with the scriptures the quotes maybe what we call scriptures is what brother randam said is you know sometimes it's not a Verbatim scripture but he said we were in him when he walked the shores of Galilee he said we preached in him he said we went to hell in him he said we was raised in him well if it doesn't stay personal to where he's real how are you going to have it and see then we wasn't little bitty spots sticking in Jesus because that's your flesh you're looking at we were the part of the life that he had all right now brother random said let me go a step further he said and it's on the predestination quotes if you heard me reading them he said we were just his attributes and things he said not her being like that i' say but he then he'd go on in a minute and he'd say like space gets the future on he said my body was in the earth when it was created now let me ask you a question then I love to turn it around on what do you think you would look like because we're not trying to put you back there as a person now we're trying to put you back there as a part of God but then let you come this way and develop into a body what if there had never been a fall don't you believe you would have come with a body where would that body have come from from the earth maybe not the seven 16 elements as the prophet would say not the same what is it brother Dean not the same um chemicals you see come from the original speaking of Let There Be I believe the body you're living in G GES right I believe the very body you're living in if you have the new birth is the body you're going to live in throughout eternity and that body would have been had there been no fall but yet that wouldn't have made him a savior and a Healer and cuz I'm not looking for another body see I'm looking for this body to be made new that's why the people in this message you check it out there's probably 50 % of the people believe you're going to get a new body after all brother random has said about it they still believe it because that's old Doctrine see I believe this body one day sir will be made Eternal now let me go another step and I'll stop then let somebody else the question if the word redeem is correct you're listening the word redeem means to go back where you come from don't you believe in Redemption of the body and who was that that Moses saw in the Cliff of the rock the theophany right which was the son of God which was the logos which was all the things the prophet is brought but who' it look like he said that back part of that man walked the shores of Galilee in Jesus Christ y God has a plan and a purpose but you're getting bordering on pre-existence brother Dale I'm not bordering on pre-existence I'm talking about pre-existence of eternal life not peoples of eternal life there was a time this world didn't exist but now it does who'll be next anything any more Brother Gary who'll be next anybody comments thoughts question brother dick El come up on on the theophany uh when I first studied on it and people preaching on and everything you know the scripture says if this Earthly body be dissolved we have one waiting and my question was that come to me now if we have one waiting when we die does a lost person have one waiting when they die so I come to find out that they do because brother said when when when Jesus and his theophany went to souls in prison to preach to them down there he said they were in their Theo exactly and what you said a minute ago just brought that up you know you know they're not going back to where they began because they're not redeemed can't be if they redeemed when when at the white Throne judgment when they're cast into hell that same body that they walking around here on this Earth they going to get that same body yeah but they're not redeemed sinner has to stand in the same body he lived in right I don't know whe that help anybody or not but that's just that's just what I see so you know you can't you can't cast that that bunch out there they got it they got a trip to make also amen it's all right I believe when Jesus Christ walked into the pits of hell that he looked just like he did with the body that was laying in that grave young man you know because of the fact of taking away age and thing but that was who he look like that's why I believe your soul is your theop because if I seen your soul right now it would look just exactly like you I CU you know what it'd be you I believe that who's next anybody else comments thoughts sister Anna this is a comment um when we on up a little closer uh brother grham said that Harry R asked for the right thing which was salvation of his two of her two boys and it just rang in my mind that the most important thing God is concerned with is for us to get eternal life and you know it said that they got baptized and followed God's provided way so there I didn't see anything to do with coming here with eternal life God I mean they had to come God's provided way right so God is more interested in us having eternal life because if you have the Holy Ghost you'll ask for the right thing like you said um another qu a question now what happens to deathbed conversions what happens what now people who like brother bram's Daddy he he got saved about an hour before he died you know he standing shaking hands death B don't they don't get baptized you know water and go through the whole journey what happens to those people uh I'm with brother random I believe in death bed confessions but I'll quote it with him it's very close and I don't want to depend on it but if it's genuine you know if it was genuine then what would be the difference in it and 40 years serving God right if you you know if if you was dying in in one second God come and give you eternal life you're just as Eternal as anybody that lived all their life so I believe in deathbed confessions I just don't believe in every one of them you know I believe in confessions I believe in all that but I just don't believe everybody has the right you know confessions and things and the possession with the confession and I do believe I believe people can can make it right just in a in a moment but we can't afford to wait that's something that you can't just say well I'll wait now you're in trouble cuz you can't afford to wait wondering about those people do they have eternal life I mean do they have the Holy Ghost if if that person the deathbed confession all right now you're going to get into a thought all right uh first that person could be just Justified all right and die and go on they could come up at the white Throne judgment and receive eternal life they don't have it here all right suppose you had a little time they could come to sanctification see they would have to go to the white Throne to receive it all but if that person right there in that deathbed confession could go through the fact of justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost just as Eternal as you are because it's eternal life but I said now you have to cure it because there's so many things see some people may be justified you know and die brother around said sure you're going to heaven see sure you're saved but he didn't say you in the bride see that's little different see you're going to have to go to the white throne and receive eternal life but sure you're saved why because you're believing on the Lord Jesus Christ yes sir that's where they T so much see you know you try to make a a straight thing on it it's hard to do because you got justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost receive eternal life but you got a person that's just repentant and they become Justified you know repentance and if they die right in that state then they're going to go to heaven but they're not the bride because they didn't continue on they will get eternal life the to watch thr I mean that's the best I can do cuz that's just the way I see it that's why brother random you got so many things in brother rand's message that people are bypassing he said I believe you're born again and baptized into the body that's got a place to be put but honestly admit I don't understand yet all about words put uh I believe I do about justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost adoption Etc fine but everybody says Lord Lord ain't going to enter either so that's a different thing too I'm still learning too I appreciate the God doing it and you know what I'd like to do is listen to you talk you'd be surprised how many sermons I get listen to you talk cuz sometimes you answer my questions you said well I didn't know it well we get old there you don't know it is that that what you're talking about though okay anything else who'll be next say about uh you t a thief on the cross he made a confession there that they were they was getting a just reward for for their life right and admitted that he was the Lord because he called him Lord right he said remember me when I you you your kingdom is brought into effect he says this day th'll be with me in paradise and somewhere will receive eternal life cuz he was when Jesus went down there and and preach to that that group there see he was over here and when they resurrected he res resurrected they resurrected he was with them right now that's a that's a good type to to look to and I don't see how it could be brought any better than what you did just then because you can be justified in in in in a Christian and will receive eternal life somewh Justified and Sanctified in in receiveing but all that's up to God right and see he put he posted that on that cross right there and it showed that man he because he they both of them was reading on him to start with and he seen something he said he said now why are you doing this I mean to the other Thief he said why are you doing this this man's done nothing right see he I mean he's and then he turned to him he said Lord remember me when you come into your kingdom exactly so he he confessed that that was him and then Jesus gave it to him right there and and show he this was a death bed a Confessor right I mean I guarantee cuz he was he was hanging on the cross so you I thought I'd mention that but one other thing that I I just little something that I see because all the talking all the preaching rather that you've done it does something to me see I see that where he said Joshua parallels Ephesian Ephesian par Joshua he said election looks to for knowledge for knowledge looks to D Destiny looks to to uh me predestination looks to Destiny so I see by having the new birth that I have the very Fountain of for knowledge in my in my soul amen right and he and he shows me by a revelation that I am his elected exactly and that election goes by predestination back to the found before the foundation of the world where he put my name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and this caught me down here and but I must see that I am God's elected and I see it for my soul exactly and this is where it's all happening here it's not off up here somewhere it's all happening in me and this is this is a this I'm kind of summing something up but you must see to to be in this change that you are God's elected and and all the way back to before because that that's the greatest mystery that I could even even think of how God before the foundation of the world before there was anything dwelt there and how he in his thoughts he could have two people now I'm just just you he could be the world and how he could know that he was going to create those two people and and and he knew what one of them would do and he would not make that person make one choice for him he wouldn't make him do it right but and he also wouldn't make this other person make a choice but he knew the choice for knowledge exactly he knew the choice and he was able to predestinate and from there by you seeing you you he is elected he can show you your predestination by his for knowledge and show you your destiny exactly amen thank you and I'm I'm I'll get to this Sunday I a going to say no more about it I'm just going to say I think we're pretty well down to the end of predestination right I think the destiny has been achieved amen right now we'll get to that Sunday but I think his Destiny has been achieved is a long travel but somewhere you're going to reach the end of that travel yep come together here who's next when Jesus died on the cross um brother brandham said that when they pierced him in the side that the the bride came out yet the bride went to hell with him so it's talking about the life CU that theophany was the eternal life that went to hell so it's talking about the life not the blood right because see it's like I said the other day when that life went out of Jesus Christ that eternal life that was the bride going out right okay cuz that was his children but yet there's a connection to this flesh so he had to put that spear in there to bring the bride out what out into being not out as a you know bringing it out it's into being you know we're we're here we are his bride on earth right we're not as bright up in heaven we're on Earth so that blood would have to run out here see to show the bride where she's at she's not up there those Saints is just 20 ft right over there and it's getting closer every minute I believe see that's why that when you put the spear in there see then what would be called what what could you say the word rest wouldn't be cor you couldn't say the rest of the Bride come out no the part of us that was not that Eternal section of going up with him and leaving and and going to hell with him and Etc uh it would be connected to this body because that that would connect him to this body he's connected to my body and your body that's how you can redeem them okay that what you anything else it's going to be exciting to see the Saints when they come back right I agree with it anybody else see that's that's why I don't like to say a lot of things cuz people think I'm picking on them but see that's why I believe Those Old Testament Saints there's a lot of lot of dealing right there you got a lot of quotes from brother Brandon some saying that they raised physically and some saying they're not I know one thing for certain they never made it to be the Bride of Jesus Christ I know that what else it is I I just know they never made it to be the bride and I just can't put him ah head of the Bride I got to put him in a position and can't put him ah head and I keep saying they without us cannot be made perfect it's just one of those things but all right let's Stand Together come on brother di you have any more questions let me know and we'll try to cover them Sunday if you don't then we're going to get into the Morning Star sing together and the sons of God shouted for Joy amen we see what the Bible and the prophet has to say about it and try to go from there then we'll start our journey downward into Earth and see these things made manifest see why the prophet would say you were born with this seed in you what is the yeah what is the seed of God God doesn't have physical seeds he creates physical seeds his word is his seed a blot of difference right go ahead what we got brother anybody have a need
