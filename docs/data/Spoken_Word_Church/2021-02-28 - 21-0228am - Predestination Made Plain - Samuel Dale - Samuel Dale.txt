okay remember this afternoon wade will be ministering for us and the lord willing now if i can get so far in the message today i want to try to do it wednesday so i'm just asking you to uh you know i know some can't be here i understand that that's no problem but then make sure you get the message you know and try to get it because it's something that's been on my heart for 40 years of trying to preach about predestination and to get it in the right order to where that we can understand we will not read the whole lot we're just going to try to preach about it to where you can can understand at least what we're saying and then we'll give you what the prophet has said and and you shouldn't know enough of it anyway but you know think on these things on predestination and we'll try to be trying to make it plain as we can all right father we thank you for this day and your grace unto us thank you for loving us thank you for everything just have your way and come among us and open our eyes to that understanding that we may see you and want to walk into your love and grace forgive our sins and lead us in thy grace and love lord remember the sick among us you know the needs that are there and many many sicknesses our wife still having troubles with old sinuses and the things that's still bothering lord and we know that satan is doing everything he can to hinder in every way lord all of these that are sick among us we just ask you to come and take it away because we believe you and we thank you for it and saying that by your stripes we are healed we love you in jesus name amen okay romans 8. we're going to verse 28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did predict for for whom he did for no he also did predestinate what to be conformed to the image of his son now your predestination we we won't get to it but you remember your predestination is your destiny and so then that's why he's saying it that we're we're predestinated to a certain place in this day to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called then he also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified now i love this scripture right here what shall we then say to these things all the things he's just said what can we say if god be for us who can be against us you may be seated the lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now i would ask you i know it's not you sitting here that's doing it but i'm just asking you to something uh you know when the phone rings here i mean i'm we're honest and sincere and try to do but just like while ago you were worshiping and things and then all at once here comes a phone call in well i understand that i understand and try to anyway but uh try not to make those phone calls coming in during the worship service the ministry and let it be before the service we're glad to pray for your needs and things like that you know and all and but try not to be unless it's what you call a dire emergency you know just a real real emergency that would would need something you know call before the service or after the service because everybody in here hears the phone ringing and then everybody in here wonders is it for me see how you interrupt the whole service to get in your little call and i don't mean this wrong now i mean seriously and you call in say i got a tummy ache or my car quit you know and then you're interrupting the whole service for us to pray about your car you know or something we'll do it before the service do it after the service you know don't don't do that like that to her you know what we say well but my my you know i've asked you to cut your phones off i know i know you have not done it because every once in a while we get a little accident and somebody just comes through right and you get to hear them in the service but i've asked you to cut your phones off this is a service time this is a time we are to be worshiping god not to be talking on uh what's that uh thing the name of it yeah what facebook yeah we're this is not the time of facebook this is not the time of of keeping up with whether or not you've gone to the bathroom three times today you know and you know something like that on facebook you know that that that's that means no if it's an emergency call in yeah but not to just say well well i'm i i'm just no see you're interrupting the services now and i'm just going to say it this way because i can't you know you say well well i'm not going to order you to not turn your phones on because i don't have to i'm not going to order you to wear your face mask but you ought to i'm not going to order you to not call in on a phone call but you don't not do it see the reason i'm not going to order it because if i have to order you to do it then that's that becomes a childish situation right if i've got to order you to come to church on sunday morning and sunday night and wednesday nights you know then you don't you're not in involved in this situation that's right you're not you're not a christian because you're not displaying the way of a christian right well brother dale i was just you know i've said it i mean it we try to do everything sure all right emergencies the phone call is about the phone is there for emergencies something comes in all right that's emergencies but not just to do it every day and do it you know and sit there and look over on your thing and i watch some of you and you know you're you know you're doing it you've been doing it you didn't stop doing it and you're not going to stop doing it so i was praying in there before i came out i said lord give me some way to express what i'm saying without people getting all upset and then run the rest of the service because that's what you're doing you get your feelings hurt so you won't listen to what i'm talking you won't listen to what i'm preaching but you'll you'll be sitting in your little pity party world and you won't be doing it right you interrupt the services the prophet said that's your responsibility between you and god you get up and run to the bathroom backwards and forth you can go before the service i see brother ray there brother ray when the singing song comes apart here before hit the service starts for us to you know to come out or anything and he goes to the bathroom and comes back all right that's good that's respectable right now we're trying to talk about christianity this is something now i'm going to say it and then you can take what you want to i mean we had respect in the baptist church we respected the rules and regulations in the baptist church methodist presbyterian whatever you come from and you know what i'm fixing to say is true you go to some of the churches of this message and they're going to personally call you out if you keep going to the bathrooms and back and things they're going to make you they're going to show you they rule the place well i don't try to do that it's only going to hurt feelings when it hurts feelings you're not going to listen to what god's talking about i'm trying my best to get you to see what it is to be a christian and what god's word is we've had the greatest message that has ever been delivered because it was delivered to the small things all the way to the top it was made from the simple things all the way to the deepest things that could be thought of and i i mean we should honor and respect that you know yeah but i'm i'm i know what that's what i said you see you you already caught that and it's it's already hurting your feelings and already doing but just remember try to do the best you can try to do the best you can you know just just uh okay don't forgive me for what i said because i'm not going to ask for forgiveness i'm just going to say to you i thought we were supposed to be christians to act and do and live like christians that's all that i've thought about you know doing well you think i'm not a christian like one brother i said something to him about it and he went and told everybody and quit coming to church here won't come now why because brother dale said that he wasn't a christian i didn't say that i never said that or whatsoever you know what i said i said a christian don't act like that right you say well you said the same thing okay i said the same thing christians don't act like that the prophet talked about little feelings that we have you know and things little hurt feelings and things with us being christians that we shouldn't have them you know okay just just think about all right now we finished up the series part about the um fact of god and his ways and his doings and how that it was back before the world and we come through that to bring out the things and and bringing it down to where that we're living and bringing it to where the message of the hour is showing us the one true and living god that is you know here to do and do all the things and took it all way back from before the foundation world and went all the way forward to the future as to the bride of jesus christ ending it up in the message that the bride of jesus christ will be in the last days according to your prophet now not according to brother dale not according to anybody else according to your prophet that you claim to believe everything he says all right but according to your prophet then the bride is to be the fullness of the godhead bodily now well you said but i just don't see it well you know what go home and look in the mirror and ask yourself a question am i living like a christian or am i acting like a bastard child because bastard children can't be forgiven are we acting like christians or bastard children you know in our doings and things see that's what hinders us from understanding if we say we don't believe now that you know that the bride is to be the fullness of the godhead by then you're making the prophet a liar now you ain't gonna like ass yeah i say you know no you ain't gonna like that at all because you know no i'm not i believe everything he says well then you know let's act like we believe it let's talk about being it and believing it see that's where our trouble is at we don't believe what the bible says about us well it's going to take somebody somewhere in this last days is going to stand on the word of god and believe god and come out to the bases that we can follow the message and walk off of this earth as a born-again christian be wednesday night later in the message but you'll forget it by the end but i'll say it this way i ask you a simple question this morning that's what i've been trying to do you remember how we went through the the godhead being plain and simple trying to bring it down to the level that we can talk on it and discuss it all right i want to talk about predestination in the simplest way that can be thought of the most simple way that can be thought of in predestination that's what we want to talk about all right see then don't get all of this stuff but i was before the world and i was here that uh we'll bring out not today but we'll bring it out you've got it brought out enough the prophet said were we spirits then before the world he said no we wasn't nothing we was in the mind of god when i want to ask you a question simple questions i want to ask you is the center in the mind of god he's what god thought of now i know the difference between being in the mind of god yeah and being the mind of god i don't want to be in the mind of god because just being in the mind of god everybody in the world that's going to be the whole thing of this morning everybody in the world is predestinated everybody the way your prophet brought it see then that does away if you can make that bold statement and say everybody in the world is predestinated the same way then that does away with all of this but i always was eternal i'm predestinate a special way that's not simple enough for me to understand it see because i've got to figure out then what i was and what's this and what's that but if i can take it to believe what the prophet had said and the bible has said about it and just believe it and say thank you lord i i may not be able to explain it but i believe it this is a simple question that will determine wednesday to be 40-something years to trying to minister about predestination to finally reach a point to where i can express at least a little bit about it how does god predestinate how does god predest tonight now predestination is the fact of according to the commentaries predestination is to predestining or determining means deciding beforehand even decreeing all the way from eternity and coming all the way through it means to a point beforehand predestination how much much more simple could you express the word or thought of predestination now remember one thing that i'm asking you to remember and get away from the thoughts and ideas and it'll destroy those doctrinals everybody is predestinated the same way or else you have a respect of persons now i was good enough no that's going to be a thing that we're going to hang on monday i mean wednesday we're going to hang on to it and we're going to nail down hard and strong on some thoughts to predetermine predestinate predetermined you've heard me tell about my dad and he's the old baptist believed in predestination and my mom was trying to explain to him out in the cotton field one day a little bit about predestination and uh daddy he couldn't read he couldn't do it but he had some pretty good understanding he talked to her about serpent seed and that was back before we ever heard of it from the prophet but he said is does god predestinate everything and she said yes he says did he predestinate me to pick that bowl of cotton she said yes he did he just went around it you said well that was silly it made a point but can your thoughts of predestination cover everybody in the world if not you have a predetermining factor that will not fit the word of god because according to the word of god and according to the prophet all things are predestinated that's why he could come up with that word and call it foreknowledge because that's what it is because the bible says those who he foreknew he did predestinate so what comes first predestination or foreknowledge if god determines something to be without giving a choice or or anything of the matter then he is a respecter of persons and he's picking and choosing whether you like the idea or not well i like the idea of thinking that i was something before the world what was you what was he the prophet said you were only in his mind you know what the center was in his mind everybody in the world is in his mind are you going to be a respecter of persons well you don't understand predestination you just you just don't know well okay i don't know why i know one thing for certain and i don't mean this disrespectful but i mean it's sustainable to be the plain truth you come show me where i missed it i'll come back right here to church and show them that i missed it and turn around and tell who told it you know and then i'll resign and sit down that's how serious i am because if i'm wrong i'm wrong but if i'm right you're the one's got the problem and if i can say everything the prophet said without denying it bring me any quote on predestination that's the challenge that i put forth i just finished a series of of one god bring me anything that would show different than what i preached about the one true and living god oh you're just being sarcastic well come on you know that's just the best way i can say it but what do you think about predestination will we say well uh predestination god determined that i was going to be saved and he saved me anyway i want to ask you a simple question what may god turn to abraham and call him and wind up calling me him his friend wind up putting every one of us jew gentiles and whatever into the line and we got to talk about the seed of abraham right we are the children of abraham it don't matter where we're gentile jews or who we are all born again christians are the seed of abraham because that's the only seed that's worth anything so you know that real quick i'm not talking about a physical seed we're not all the seed of abraham by the natural seed but we're the seed of abraham by faith so what is god looking at to predetermine what is he looking at what is he judging it by well he just he loves me jacob have i loved he saw how i hated god doesn't mind using the word hate when it's related to esau but we know that god cannot use the word hate in the basis that he hates anything that way especially when it's a person or something he cannot hate what would he hate with the bible's full of things that are marvelously said but most of the time misunderstood why did god choose abraham it's hard to stay away from wednesday but i'll ask you the same question on david what made god come to david and him an adulteress and a murderer and all things and he said he's a man after my own heart now you tell me what he what brought him to him i'm giving you a whole layout to where you'll think about then we'll drop back the message and just shuffle through what do you think this is all determined about they can't be on the basis of how good you are can't be on the basis of of anything like there has to be a basis though for god to predetermine and it must be so simple that we can understand it as babies or children can understand the point of a predestination so what do you think about it all right predestinate our predestination means that god can predetermine some way and not be a respecter of persons because he wouldn't at all be saved right is that the bible is that the prophet he wouldn't all be saved well he just don't look at how good i am good for what what are you good for how much did the prophet say so many ounces or someone's you know potashes and things are worth this like 80 cents or something then we think we i'm going real slow real thoughtful really to get you to think and just i like to think things out i like to comprehend what is being said and the prophet that's why he would say it you know how he said it he said now predestination is a bad word to use in front of an untrained congregation now we'll read that in a minute you know what if we don't then you know it said why is predestination such a bad word what would make it a bad word it has to be on the basis of how you understand what the word predestination means right it has to be put on the point of of well what does predestination we baptist we believed in predestination brother dick was here he'd go with you with the present material they kind of had the idea that you know like your predestination was and i'm on the edge of the platform here and a step off well that was predestinated to happen so i'm glad i got it done now that would be a good way to approach the bible of predestination that some way god can predetermine something to take place but he can't put you in a pipe and push you through the other end of it and call it predestination he has to give you a choice see everybody has to have that same choice hold the difference in david and saul and see we don't even listen to the terminologies of the prophet and things to try to see we try to figure it out ourselves the one i love for him to talk about is jacob and esau when he said jacob have i loved and he saw how i hated and knowing that there is no part of god anywhere ever being ever will be to contin to deal with the word hate he can't hate he cannot like but he can't hate because that would make him a part of uh the world we're in all right but see you don't even think about listening to this how are you going to put jacob and esau in your predestination plan it's giving you little thoughts did not the fact after all the things that jacob had done to esau stole his birth right took his other things you know from him but after all was said and done [Music] when jacob and ease all met on the return of jacob from bethel esau so loved his brother until he throwed his arms around him jacob said brother he said i'll give you everything i've got natural story he's all looked at him he said i got more than what you've got read your bible i've got more than you got and then you're trying to give me this i don't want that all i want is just me and you to be brothers from now on how can you fit that in predestination another little illustration there was a lady called hagar and after all that happened with sarah and hagar and the whole story sarah says abraham this ain't working we can't keep her here because it cannot fulfill the word with her here and it's right so they put her out but what did god do god found her sitting under a tree giving her child the last drop of water that was there god said i've heard you prayers get up and go on back just be under subjection to sailor and do the best you can but yet all we read is there's nothing there oh man she was she was this he was that the prophet when he brings it out says the seed shall not be air with the shuck i remember first reading that and thinking this guy's messed up because according to our understanding the seed would have been right and this would have been they would have been wrong but according to the bible the seed shall not be aired with a shuck the shuck is the what is going into tribulation foolish virgins etc etc but they're not going to be bribed thank god that they can't we cannot be or we will not be heir with that god chose the right way but he gave everybody a choice and put it to the choice of saying okay how would we like it if god told us how we was to be predetermined i think he's trying to yeah i think he's trying to tell us how we're being predetermined if we'll listen all right see you've got to cover a lot of things to understand predestination but if i'm predestined to be there i'll be there it don't make no difference nothing can't change that you know but if you're predestinated to go to hell you're going to hang on nothing can't change that man i don't like that well i wasn't the one that wrote the book you're going to have to deal with god about his word you have to deal with your prophet when the prophet said god didn't pick and choose he didn't do it that way he didn't choose abraham because he was a good guy but why did he choose abraham all right let's go disappoint and then we'll get some of it and we'll pick up the lord willing wednesday what does predestination mean and how does it work predestination means to determine or predetermine something decide beforehand decree it all the way it has to be connected all the way back to eternity it has to be for ordained or appointed and it has to be beforehand by being predestination all right but which then comes first predestination or for knowledge those who did for no he did predestination so what comes first now making it simple to think about think about your predestination your life you're doing that and you'll come out with a greater understanding you never thought of i believe if we listen because everything is based then upon god's foreknowledge if he predestinated anything or anyone outside of foreknowledge first then he's a respecter of persons and he just messed up his whole book and there ain't no way that you can determine it what it is because for the same reason by the same reason and all it could be abraham david was chosen the same way solomon was chosen the same way all right how is it then that a person can come through this world and finish it all up and god can say to hell you go without a respecter how can you do that something about those individuals you remember i told you a few weeks ago i said i've been studying a lot about just plain naturally this plane naturally happened it just plain naturally happened that adam and eve wound up in the garden at this plane this naturally happened because it was real god never predetermined before the world and set back now i'm going to make a world they're going to fall and i'm going to save them no matter what they do that's the basics of most people's thoughts of predestination but to me every person in the world comes predestinated before knowledge that way i can keep the simple point of all people whether sinner or saint and leave it on a free moral agency of a choice that you choose what you you you're the one that makes you as brother tom falbos used to say you trigger your predestination that was a good point in other words you make it come into view by your predestination but what you know about predestination will determine what you're going to do but we got to understand and that was the reason for for doing it and taking it covering the godhead and all of the things and bringing that godhead to the bases that the eternal god before the world ever begun for knew and would predestinate and all like that because he was god he would be infinite he would he would know everything before it would ever take place if not you got a peanut brain god sorry because that's your peanut brain and god ain't messing it up but think about it predestination the prophet said is only the foreknowledge of god now if you approach predestination anything outside of it being the foreknowledge you are predetermining something for your own benefit your desires is involved god's desires was that everybody in the world be saved but by his for knowledge he knew that would never take place so he could write the book before the world so he could leave your name out of the book because he knows what you're going to do well he don't give me a choice no wait a minute there's where we got to get good and simple with predestination you got up today and you come to church you went through this you went through that some of these had to come over to go to this house go over to that house or do whatever you know you think god didn't know all about that are you do you think you're pulling anything on over on god if god knows every time a gnat bats its eye man and how much tyler i never didn't know it made tyler but how much how many times it bat its eye then we think and we can pull something over on him well he didn't see me do that to predetermine something even beforehand could only be dealt with with an eternal god who had you know all wisdom perfection and everything and there's no way that he could make his choices one way today and another way tomorrow whatever he said has to be done you say yeah but brother dale i had a choice to come to church today i could have went to so-and-so's church yeah but you didn't do it did you pull anything over on god no you came in other words if we determine predestination as to a destiny set out there is made on the basis of a knowledge back there then back there it was all finished he knew everybody that would ever come into the world he knew everybody that would ever be saved who would ever be lost he never made us wrong he gave us a choice we chose the wrong yeah but i i i i hear brother so explain that to me and i just i just feel so good because i think about what i was back there well let's deal with that just a minute you realize then in whatever you was back there you are now right whatever you was before the world you are now are you changed somewhere and there would be some change some reason or something but you just don't preach salvation brother dale i i believe in salvation that god foreknew that i'd be saved i agree with you because i agree with what the prophet said he said thereby he'd have it waiting on you and you got here that's his foreknowledge everything that happens god already knew it was going to happen before it would ever take place then is there any problem with jacob have i loved and he saw how i hated when he knows both ends of the scale but the prophet would say now god could not take and predestination is not god taking push us through this pipe and take us out the other end he said that can't happen that's god predetermining remember his predetermining our destiny determined out there is based on what he knew back there for knowledge for knowledge then it's very simple what is for knowledge the knowledge before is that simple enough knowledge before anything transpires is for knowledge now god is the only one who can do that right we can't do that we can pick and choose we can gamble we can be right half the time we can no he's right every time what i love about him is the way he deals you take cain and abel god says cain if you'd have done like your brother you have been accepted right but he said because you took your choice you made your decision you made a choice that you wasn't going to listen to abel because see i'm like this i'm sorry i i think different maybe from most people i'm just good or bad on that but i don't think the part in the garden with adam and with cain and abel was a five-minute deal i think they discussed life in ways and situations and and things and abel tried his best to explain to cain what took place and how the act was there the animal was there the things were there the things took place all of this had to happen he was trying to explain that to cain and cain like you and i i don't like that idea oh you're making it too er you know i mean we don't want our children to hear these things you're making it too plain to talk about an animal and a woman a bit together you're making that too plain well i thought that's what they're teaching in school now i didn't know they call it sex education i guess that makes it right but listen would cain have been accepted had he done right no god was just playing with him um he wasn't playing with it he's telling the truth and he walked back over there and said abel i don't understand this i'm serious i don't understand what all you told me but said don't stop telling me because i know one thing for sure god's over on your side at that time he had not made the choices and done it but he cain had enough sense to know that god was already on the side of abel because he was trying to why would god tell cain cain if you will do what's right you understand what i'm talking about i like to look at things over a long scale i don't believe even the beast and all this and the other was a five minute of fire i believe it was months weeks years time involved to bring it to a finality of things taking place and then doing every bit of that you see then that he made her choice and god according to what he knew before the world knew that choice that she was going to make what i love about him was he didn't kill eve right there even though she'd made the wrong choice he said i'll still put up with it even though i've got a foreknowledge that has determined within me that i know what you're going to do i'm still going to do the best i can don't you think god foreknew everything if you don't what's wrong what kind of a god do you have what kind of an idea or point what would make you think that god doesn't know everything so then what did he do that was what i was telling you about it a little bit this bible is full of things that took place and those things taking place was not haphazards but it was the fact that something took place there was a garden of eden there was an adam and eve there was a natural cane and abel there was a natural abraham there was a natural david those things are natural it's it's a record this bible is a record of mankind upon the earth it tells the beginning of mankind it tells what he goes through and all of his doing and his choosing and it tells the end of mankind and you see all we got to do is read it you like to read a love story now come on i know you do it but i i know a lot of women especially i like reading love story books well let me give you one to a sign for you to read turn to the songs of solomon and read that this afternoon the greatest love story that's ever been in life until the fact is that mankind still wonders my brother will tell you in a heartbeat that that was solomon's lust that caused that problem well i've got to admit solomon's involved but i told him i said no you can't put it that way because you're making god force something to take place you're putting the desires into mankind well i've heard them in this message say that god put the desires into the women to do what they've done and they've done it well that's getting very close but think about it predestination is the prophet says it on the questions and answers number two if you want to pull it up where they can read it predestination is only the foreknowledge of god [Music] with the foreknowledge all right god being infinite before knowledge he knew everything or he isn't infinite see he knew what would happen so by for knowledge he could predestinate that's the reason that i believe that god's that god just doesn't you know what's he doing predestination go to the next one number three taken from faith of abraham and predestination is a hard word to use among accommodation people you know really foreknowledge is a better word and predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks on to destiny all right now that that's an odd situation did you read what he said he says really foreknowledge is a better word predestination looks back to foreknowledge and foreknowledge looks owned to the destiny well it goes all the way back and before the world god wrote the book of the destiny he didn't have to wait until this would touch fire we know he didn't have to write this is the book that your bible is the book that was written by mankind to cover the world in time destiny god being infinite knew the end from the beginning therefore he knew what people would do so he could foretell what would take place for he knew what would be therefore he before esau or jacob either one was born god could say esau i've hated and jacob i've loved why because he foreknew what they could be he never made he saw the way he was he wasn't willing that esau would be that way but he saw by choice god knew would take that way so that's how he knows us today he knows your heart and if you might be able to fool your neighbor you might be able to fool your pastor but you'll never be able to fool god because he knows your heart therefore he by election he chose abraham for he knew what abraham would do now there's the key to understanding what we're going to be talking about wednesday night keep that key that he knew what abraham would do why because according to his foreign is that simple enough according to god's foreknowledge he saw what abraham would do he saw what you would do is that simple enough all right you remember when he called him out there and said he not keep the thing a secret from him when he was going down to destroy sodom and gomorrah he said for i know that abraham will teach his children i know that god's himself let me turn that around where i can put it to her david coming forth and god knows what david will do god knows david will teach his children i know god's himself how that god or abraham will send this message on down from one to the other the generation put david in there because the same thing that motivated david motivated abraham the same thing motivated god where he would not be making a choice god doesn't choose the way we think you say he chose me that's right the better way of saying it i was chosen in him there's a better way of saying it instead of saying god chose you better way of saying it is god chose you in him because that way then you don't have to leave it look but god for knowing that and knowing that abraham would do it then he told abraham in the beginning that he would save him and save his seed after him and would give him the unconditional covenant that he made with abraham not because abraham was good because god was good if god ever is this a quote from the prophet that would fit anywhere you wanted if god ever gives you a promise you can go to the bank with it don't ever promise you something you don't have to worry about it right you don't have to try to figure it out the thing to do is just go say it this is one i like we'll get to it later abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness so whatever abraham needed it was imputed why because he believed god that's the key to wednesday night abraham or anybody believe in god see that's why some people can't believe god they just can't believe it they just won't do it because they won't listen they won't listen to the simplicity of god in him trying to deal with them all god says to abram which he wouldn't even abraham he said abram come follow me now you think god didn't know that do you think when jesus was walking the shores of galilee that he looked at the disciples and he says come follow me they just laid down their stuff and started walking his way right why didn't everybody else do that that's right everybody else could look around and say well we want to be there when the breads and loaves is passed out you know but the disciples just laid ever i think about that something took place in a situation that you can put it with abraham isaac jacob joseph come on down david solomon you can just keep coming right on down coming into the disciples to come right on down to where you are something triggered that something made that take place but you know what it was going to take place because god saw it i want to end it with that part god saw what abraham would do all right he didn't make him then do or not do he left him with a choice and abraham took the right choice and made it right what if he took the wrong choice like i've always said about the virgin mary she said be it unto me according to thy word well how many other women in that day did god now you can say this going to be presuming brother they'll be okay we'll just presume a little bit but get the point across how many young virgins in that day read the bible and said i could be that girl he said no no no no why not see you're putting it in a pot and pushing it here you're making everything work instead of leaving it to the bases that god could sit back before the world in his foreknowledge and look all the way down through time and everything would be predetermined how many times that gnat batted his eye why would it be predetermined because god saw that's what it would do yeah but you're putting it you're putting our salvation on the basis of something we do or don't do where did you get that idea he said well it's not on what i do or don't do well is it on what you don't do are you saved because you don't do no you're saved by grace through faith what was god looking at with abel the same way he looked at it in abraham does the bible say what i just quoted a moment ago that abraham believed god and it was imputed unto him for righteousness is that the scripture well you know what can't you say why can't you be sent so long and say uh you know god looked down and seen what i would do and he seen that i would choose him that's my savior yeah but that's making it on what we do no that's making it on the choice we make it's making it on to the decisions that we make the decisions that we make is involved in our predestination because if i made that decision i decided to be at church today you know when i made that decision god saw it before the world ever begun god saw you'd be sitting here all right now listen he knew what you'd think right you know when you think it before the world now you can't change that thought so there ain't no need to do anything the best thing to do just repent oh well brother dale i didn't sin that's the worst sin of all is to doubt god that is the only sin the only sin there is is us to doubt god to doubt that god could before the world sat down and looked all the way through time and go all the way through and predestinate every gnat that would ever appear there and come into six thousand years of time and go through a millennium to put another thousand in and all of that how many times i don't know you know and that god knew before the world how many times he'd do it right but what if the nat decided one day he didn't want to bat his eye he said well he can't do that when god knew he was going to do that come on god knew that that decided we were going to decide somewhere in town not as bad as i was right come on i'm trying to get you to see the infinite god and his great wisdom we ain't pulling nothing over on him he knew what we would do he knew where we would be today and what's going on today well i just i just decided to go to church today well i'm going to say it to you and just put it in plain language david never got up and decided to go to church he said let's go up you know it's a very little incline been there and walked up to it's not a great big old ditch great big hills and mountains it's just a little incline comes up and you leave from where david was down here with his temple and to be made you know in his house and live it and you walk up and then you level off and there's where the temple was at david said let's go up to the house of the lord well let's go this way david no that ain't the way they are yeah we made these houses to our god we made these and you solomon would be involved in it not much david but solomon would be so much until he built houses for the prostitutes or the the uh uh common women right he built big old buildings for him temples and things well that wasn't going up to the house of the of the lord now david had a reason let's go up to the house god knew before the world that there was david was going to go right up and he knew even saul would turn the way he'd do it he even now listen even you how you would turn out and which side of this road you're going and what you're deciding see you're deciding right now your decisions has been made in your mind of whether or not the god that brother dale's talking about is god or do we need to search for another one because if you don't agree with what the way has been said then you need to search for one that you can find and agree with that's no problem but remember you got a choice okay he knew who would be saved and who would not be saved predestination looks back to foreknowledge for knowledge in return can look all the way to the end of your destiny you know what from there to there now you're gonna kick on me hard so let's go ahead from the beginning of my journey in life as a human being and coming up i can remember things happening you've heard me tell other you've heard the prophet tell the things that sometimes in your life was a little bit different from everybody else you've heard me tell of the fact of going out and doing wrong and come home and just say well what in the world did i do something like that for and i'd wind up you know really repenting for life you know but you see he knew all he had to do was to cross my path all right we could walk in the baptists we had fellowship i'm talking about me and god we had fellowship but one day a man walked up to me and he says what do you believe about the godhead i said one true and living god jesus is his name that's baptist doctrine he said explain that i said well the best thing i can tell you is god in three persons blessed trinity he said you're a trinitarian you're just as much as anybody else a trinitarian i looked at him i said i don't believe that no more now you think god didn't know before the world what it would take to cross the path see i couldn't come up under uh robert tatum coming and visiting me i loved him his wonderful brother i couldn't come up under you know uh george canada coming there's people you know see i had to meet that one that had the word and many of the others didn't have it i didn't say that now you get your mind straight i'm trying to express it god knew who it would take god knows who's going to take across your path and he knows if you turn that down you're making the wrong choice right because you're changing your destiny from foreknowledge to just plain destiny god chose me and i'm going to make it you know before the world ever begun he chose jesus christ by choosing him all i got to do is make sure that i've got the right choice in choosing them for my savior because that's where it's all involved he chose me in jesus christ you think i'm on fail no so he could predestinate my journey he could look down and say well all i got to do one of these days is walk across his path and drop a little word and he'll just come running how many of you remember when you first heard of the word if you understand what i'm saying i'm just trying to make it plain those disciples when jesus walked down through there they had never seen him they didn't know anything about what's going on he turned around and looked at him and come on follow me what we're going to do peter no no we're going to follow him yeah who's he well they claim he's a messiah so let's go find out you think god didn't know that's what's going to happen you think he don't know what it needs to take and touch you you mean you believe in a personal god that much brother dale i certainly do i believe brother when you walked up there and accepted jesus christ as your savior that before the world that was a choice that you made it took 6 000 years to get here and two seconds to transpire right and you say well well you know was i always a christian you know was always a christian no no you weren't always a christian there's no such thing we don't agree with that right but she was always the seed it was just waiting for a place to land seed landed in a little woman one day and she said be it unto me according to thy word brought jesus christ into the world a seed dropped in a seed we're talking about the word of god we ain't talking about some bean or corn or something god knew before the foundation world all he had to do was just cross your path i had another message to put in what i was bringing on the other series and i decided to drop out you know that brother branham says the only way that jesus could be the father was to be the son of man you know it just throws your mind every which way done but he said the only way he could be a father was to be the son of man you know why because the son of man is the sower of the seed that's right the son of man was the i am that was in the garden the son of man come all the way down just watching us and just directing us and just turning us and you know he said well i supposed to go here you ever you ever went down the road and you get somewhere and you say well why did i turn that away when you turn the radio on and they say there was a big wreck there see he turned you away he dropped the seed you took it and went on with it why can't we believe it as our christian journey think about your christian journey what you've done where you come from and what you're doing and how you first heard the word when you first said i believe that i believe that thank you lord for crossing my path and just dropping a seed that i could come forth [Applause] and be what you want me to be come find out you might have something to do with your salvation if you occur you'll understand correctly not to face point of not the point of dying or paying the price or this out of the other but you know what we missed the point i think of thinking about you had to accept jesus christ is your savior or you will not be saved brother dale you you're kind of putting it like that i've got a little bit to do with it well you put it some other way something to do with yourself no you didn't pay the price you didn't die on the cross you didn't do all of those things no but you accepted what he done he said lord i don't understand it i don't know what's going on i remember when i walked out of the baptist church because i was a baptist deacon for i forgot how long darren i was 25 years old when or 23 i guess when i first ordained a baptist deacon which that was taboo you know because you had to be 40 before you become one that's just stating the fact of coming from the baptist that there was they saw what was there and they put me in the office as a deacon i'd done the best i could do and everything and then one day when i was like brother across my path when he crossed my path when he said that and i said i don't believe that no more you know what i was saying i can't go back i was literally saying the day he said that to me and i said i don't believe that no more i knew one thing for certain my baptism was number one yes that was the priority for right there i had to do and by knowing the baptist doctrine you can be you can go from a methodist to a baptist you can go this out the other you don't have to but if you go to a baptist church you're going to be baptized in that church that is the rule you will not be accepted as a full member unless you go get baptized even though you've done been baptized five times in father's run holy ghost or whatever you want to do you're going to get baptized in the baptist church see because that's rules all right see i knew that day that i was out of that church just by simply saying i believe god's word i knew i was leaving that was i was done there i went home i didn't tell my wife i didn't discuss it with her anything because i wanted her to make up her mind you'd say well this foolish maybe it was i didn't tell her when we went to the church that day and i was teaching i had about five jobs and i had to stand up and resign from all of them because of the things i was sunday school superintendent i was this at the other side being a deacon and i didn't tell her that i was leaving i got up and i said i've got to go because i can't stay here that was the statement i've got to go my brother come out you say well he didn't mean it well he would have probably he said we'll build you a church if that's what you want i said that ain't what it is i said i've got to go where the words at right my choice has been on the word i've got to go with the word because the word is spoken in my heart i don't have a bad name of being a church breakers and all this at the other in the city of lula i'm in city of guildsville or lula i think they would respect us because we've never just been an outlandish least saying you know we've always tried to be a christian the people here have always tried to serve christ and be a christian it would be well thought of what are you what are you saying i'm saying this way has he ever crossed your path and just dropped a little seed into your heart of the word because that was where i was at i walked out of that church that day knowing not where i was going but knowing that there was a god that would speak because you see i had met him before in my christian journey as little things but that day i made up my mind i go with the word i went home got down to no barbecue pit we had in the backyard and started crying and praying because i knew i was done i knew the rules i was the guy that was in the rule book i was the guy that was a baptist that was on the board you know and i knew i couldn't go back i said god have i foolishly messed up everything now i can't even go back there well he just took me one day at a time he's been walking with me one day at a time and that's what i've accepted that's what i'm trying to get you to see a reality of a living god if you think of anything as predestination just remember the god you're thinking about before the world knew what you would do and he would determine that end you can't change now listen to what i'm saying you say well can i change my predestination why would you want to you don't listen to your prophet the prophet said with the spirit that i have now i like that part he said if he wants to throw me into hell i want to go because i want to serve him is that right is that the way maybe a little different wording or whatever but it's what he said see he loved god do you love god enough to know that i may have to give up this that or the others all kind of things to be able to serve god let's stand come on musician think on these things predestination is the fact that god foreknew what you would do not that what he would make you do that's not predestination predestination is the fact of stating something is happening because he knows you're going to do it well if he's been with us all these years you think i worry about something see this this stuff i've tried to tell you this stuff with the viruses and things that's not nothing that's uh oh yeah it's bad it's hate it's a horrible thing but we're not in no tribulation or nothing we're doing mighty good living good and eating good and ain't no tribulation that's just tribulation that working patience see things are going to get rough then it'll be a decision to see whether or not you've got it it'll be there to side then on what do we got brother sing that chorus heavenly father i appreciate you heavenly father [Music] i am [Music] [Music]
