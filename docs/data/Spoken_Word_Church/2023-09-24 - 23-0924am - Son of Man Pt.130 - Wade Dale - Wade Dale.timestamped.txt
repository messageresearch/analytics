[16:27] hanger and a pair of pliers and build
[16:30] the Empire State Building

[16:34] 'd go fishing or hunting you know when I

[17:11] the Bible says in Psalms 116 precious in

[17:17] his Saints precious
[17:19] we're supposed to cry when a baby's born
[17:21] and
[17:21] rejoice when someone passes but
[17:24] we humans have that totally backwards
[17:28] we love the little baby and we laugh
[17:30] well

[17:43] no no no
[17:44] you say well he's in a better place he's
[17:47] in the place he's supposed to be
[17:49] he's in a place that God saw him before
[17:51] the foundation of the world he didn't
[17:53] take him no sooner
[17:54] he finished his race
[17:56] and we sure appreciate the Lord for
[17:58] letting us know him
[18:00] in pretty much all my life amen
[18:03] and pretty much all the life of the of
[18:06] the brothers and sisters here he's been
[18:07] we started with them in
[18:10] 1968 in Gainesville and we've known him
[18:13] ever since so
[18:14] we appreciate the family and and loving
[18:17] with love the Lord Arrangements will be
[18:19] made later
[18:20] so we will
[18:22] let you know now uh for as far as food
[18:25] uh see sister Esther our sister Rachel
[18:29] uh the church is going to provide the
[18:32] the meat uh but you guys can provide all
[18:35] that other good cooking that you do
[18:38] to feed the family
[18:39] after the funeral so we uh we sure
[18:43] appreciate
[18:44] them taking the reins
[18:47] and saying we will do it so we you see
[18:50] them if you need anything uh they'll
[18:54] tell you what to bring all right so let
[18:57] me just give you a little update on dab
[18:59] I know and I want you to understand
[19:01] something as even brother Howe
[19:04] Thomas's family we all love him we all
[19:06] want to be around him but a man old man
[19:09] taught me a long time ago wasn't even a
[19:11] believer
[19:11] he said son he said when you're a baby
[19:14] he said your world is real small
[19:17] people you're it's just you and your
[19:19] family
[19:20] your family takes care of you your
[19:21] family feeds you your family changes
[19:23] your diaper your family protects you
[19:26] right all right
[19:30] couldn't have our brother back here with
[19:31] us today good to see you man God bless
[19:33] you
[19:34] I'll let Luis introduce you
[19:37] um in a minute but then he said as you
[19:40] get old as you get older said you you
[19:42] know you Branch out and you you have
[19:44] your own family and you have your own
[19:45] life he said but once you get older he
[19:48] said everything starts coming back
[19:49] together
[19:50] to where you don't travel as much you
[19:53] don't feel like traveling as much
[19:55] you feel like staying at home home is
[19:57] the best vacation you'll ever have when
[19:59] you get older all right so you Danny's
[20:02] nobody's shaking his head but you see
[20:03] everything's coming back together but
[20:05] what does it come down to it comes down
[20:07] to your family
[20:08] your family is your core
[20:10] and and we respect family decisions
[20:13] we don't make decisions for families
[20:15] except ours right so that's the way we
[20:18] should be we should we should be that we
[20:20] respect the decisions of any family that
[20:23] has any
[20:25] um tragedy or anything that's going on I
[20:28] told them down at the funeral for the
[20:29] little child the other day Little Lily I
[20:32] said look
[20:33] I said tragedy
[20:35] does not destroy a Christian
[20:39] it defines them
[20:41] you think of that I didn't get that from
[20:44] a book
[20:45] I do that from experiencing it from
[20:47] experience it defines who you are you
[20:49] look in the Bible what would we know of
[20:51] job if he hadn't went through a tragedy
[20:54] Samson would have never killed three
[20:56] thousand Philistines if he hadn't went
[20:58] through a tragedy
[20:59] so a tragedy should Define us and make
[21:01] us stronger and not make us weaker
[21:04] amen so as being Christians we take
[21:07] tragedy as something that we build on
[21:10] and that we're building on that
[21:12] day-to-day in our daily life and now we
[21:14] have a church family and we have
[21:15] families branching out but when it comes
[21:18] down to the time of going home the death
[21:20] of of or our sickness it just kind of
[21:23] works back down to just your family all
[21:27] right and we sure appreciate our church
[21:28] family and we appreciate the family that
[21:32] we've that we've grown to love and and
[21:34] know and we appreciate the prayers I was
[21:36] thinking this morning I thought you know
[21:38] anybody know what a Haymaker is
[21:41] some of you do not know what a Haymaker
[21:43] is a Haymaker is that somebody just
[21:46] comes up and just I don't want to say
[21:48] that other word but just yeah
[21:51] cold knocks you
[21:52] yeah
[21:54] well you know the devil thought he had
[21:56] he thought he was you know going after
[21:59] a child of God
[22:01] and uh he got a Haymaker
[22:04] your prayers
[22:06] okay your prayers with the Haymaker that
[22:08] the devil didn't see coming it's one of
[22:10] them punches you don't see coming listen
[22:12] I we need to give them back to him I
[22:15] don't want a Haymaker from him
[22:17] I want to be able to have him to receive
[22:19] one
[22:20] and knock him out and I was thinking
[22:22] this morning all the prayers you know
[22:23] we've always talked about a battle it is
[22:26] a battle it's even a spiritual battle
[22:27] even when you're you're dealing with
[22:29] sickness there's a battle there Satan
[22:31] and his demons want to give more to you
[22:34] God is over here with his angels
[22:39] wanting to give you more faith more
[22:42] strength more stability so it's a battle
[22:46] and that battle is listen we're going to
[22:49] absolutely just flood
[22:52] the airwaves and we have with prayers
[22:54] for even for for Brother house family
[22:57] and also for Dad

[24:36] I'm glad she went that way Beaufort can
[24:39] have her
[24:41] but anyway so there was a we did there
[24:43] was a CT scan done and a CT scan showed
[24:45] that there was not a brain bleed as it
[24:47] bleeding
[24:49] it had it had been knocked or something
[24:51] happened to it several weeks months they
[24:54] don't even know
[24:55] and what had happened was it had put a
[24:57] little bit of pressure on his brain but
[25:00] the actually and this is how great your
[25:02] body is the doctor told us the
[25:04] neurosurgeon finally that came in later
[25:06] on the neurosurgeon said uh your body is
[25:09] wonderful when your blood is wonderful
[25:11] when it stays in veins
[25:13] but when it comes outside the veins the
[25:15] body hates it
[25:17] it's full of iron and proteins and
[25:18] different things as the body does not
[25:20] like so and I could relate to it in the
[25:22] beekeeping world in the beekeeping world
[25:24] if there's something ever gets in that
[25:25] Hive they will actually encapsulate it
[25:28] in propolis and seal it off
[25:31] to keep it pure well that's what the
[25:34] dad's brain had done it had made a
[25:37] membrane around that blood
[25:39] and encapsulated it and kind of just
[25:41] kept it there all right so in in that it
[25:44] sounded so bad it wasn't so bad that it
[25:47] was leaking and bleeding and all this
[25:49] stuff okay so just wanted to let you
[25:51] know that but it didn't make him weak in
[25:52] the different things the neurosurgeon
[25:54] said no surgery
[25:56] not going to do it we're going to move
[25:58] on to something else so
[26:01] um when when you when you give out
[26:03] something and and give pieces of
[26:06] information it sounds really bad and it
[26:08] is it is tough on an older person an
[26:10] older person you know as well as I do
[26:12] it's harder for them to fight things
[26:15] but prayer
[26:16] is the great equalizer
[26:20] I mean it's the great equalizer all
[26:23] right you can say well this over here
[26:24] well faith
[26:26] well there's well prayer all right so
[26:28] we're believing a bunch of people we
[26:30] believe as we keep going on that he'll
[26:33] get better so they had to put a feeding
[26:34] tube in his nose and that wasn't very
[26:36] good
[26:37] um he has swelling in his lymph nodes so
[26:39] we're going to see an oncologist later
[26:41] on maybe Monday or so he's on medication
[26:44] the medication is working Anna was with
[26:46] him presenter
[26:49] Anna was with him last night and he was
[26:51] very responsive yeah she's asleep I'm
[26:53] sorry we've been kind of staying 24 7.
[26:55] so if I got a few bags and T's got a few
[26:57] bags
[26:58] if I fall asleep preaching we're good
[27:02] mom too she's she's been a little
[27:04] frazzled but she came in yesterday and
[27:06] became the Florence Nightingale of of
[27:09] nurses and she poppedo pop up and fed
[27:11] him she was shoving him full of of uh
[27:14] ice and I and popsicles and and uh what
[27:18] was that other stuff pudding she's
[27:19] laying it on him so he was eating and he
[27:22] got stronger so
[27:24] um they're gonna take him and maybe put
[27:26] him in a step down room for some of you
[27:27] nurses are here and knows what a step
[27:29] down room is it's just taking him out of
[27:31] the ICU but the ICU was so full the step
[27:34] down room was so full they're having to
[27:35] it's just like inventory they're having
[27:38] to wait till two leave and bring two in
[27:40] two leave and two in he should have been
[27:42] out of the ICU maybe before that but
[27:43] there was two other people that was
[27:45] ahead of him
[27:46] that was in there that needed to go so
[27:48] he's going to go to a step down room and
[27:50] then we will then we will assess and the
[27:53] doctors will assess forward but he is
[27:56] talking he was talking last night with
[27:58] Anna he would say a few things when we
[28:00] were there but he did eat he had not eat
[28:02] for two or three days so it was
[28:03] extremely weak and but just keep praying
[28:06] for him
[28:07] that's what we're that's what we're up
[28:09] against and we know that we have your
[28:13] support in prayer some of you have come
[28:16] and I don't think you can't I mean it's
[28:18] just you can't have a bunch of people in
[28:19] the room but Joyce and Danny came the
[28:21] other night and we sure appreciate that
[28:23] one but we appreciate your prayers more
[28:24] than anything
[28:25] all right she'll just continue to
[28:27] remember remember dad excuse me remember
[28:30] the family also remember the
[28:33] family of Susan
[28:36] fabush
[28:38] you know Sister Nell passed away when
[28:40] was it Monday
[28:41] Sunday
[28:42] and um
[28:44] and we respect their wishes and and they
[28:46] won't be a service anything we just just
[28:48] love Susan with with love
[28:50] and um and we give them all of our
[28:53] support so if whatever she needs and
[28:55] whatever the families need will be there
[28:57] for them so we sure do appreciate you
[29:00] and that's kind of the update on Dad
[29:02] they've done all kind of MRI they did
[29:05] echocardiogram on his heart they've done
[29:07] uh
[29:09] EEG and really there's
[29:14] they're moving to another step as far as
[29:16] the the
[29:18] diagnosis so so we're gonna just trust
[29:22] in the Lord we believe in doctors
[29:25] we believe in medicine
[29:26] amen
[29:28] and believe that will help them get
[29:29] stronger but your prayers are more like
[29:31] I said before
[29:33] it's a tug of war in that hospital
[29:36] demons and good Angels yes they are
[29:40] there
[29:41] they are our sisters know that when you
[29:44] walk in that place you know you you
[29:45] think man
[29:47] brother Dale's in bad shape and then you
[29:48] look over to this other person that's
[29:50] not going to make it
[29:53] so so we thank God that we're in the
[29:55] position that we're in all things are
[29:56] done to make us better right aren't we
[29:58] supposed to be made stronger from all
[30:00] this right Christians remember tragedy
[30:03] does not destroy a Christian it defines
[30:05] who they are they made it through this
[30:07] because of what their faith
[30:10] amen until let's stand to our feet let

[35:28] through a battle of his own all right so
[35:30] let's go this is Son of Man part 130.
[35:33] if you'll load her up we'll get started
[35:35] in the beginning was the word the word
[35:38] was with God and the Word was God
[35:40] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[35:42] among us and we beheld his glory the
[35:44] only begotten of the father I will make
[35:45] that bigger
[35:47] sorry about that
[35:50] we appreciate our youngins in the back
[35:52] don't we
[35:53] man we appreciate them sure do but we're
[35:56] going to zoom this youngin in right here
[36:00] how's that
[36:02] all right we good
[36:05] all right that was a scripture I was
[36:06] reading in Psalms we we believe that
[36:08] precious in the sign of the Lord is the
[36:09] death of his Saints in the beginning was
[36:12] the word words with God and Word was God
[36:13] and that word was made flesh and dwelt
[36:15] among us and we beheld his glory the
[36:17] glory of the only begotten of the father
[36:19] full of grace and truth John 3 3 says
[36:22] Jesus answered and said merely barely
[36:24] aren't saying to thee except the man be
[36:25] born again
[36:27] he cannot see
[36:29] the kingdom of God there is no way you
[36:32] can understand the kingdom of God
[36:35] because it's always contrary to man like
[36:38] we're supposed to Rejoice they cry we
[36:41] cry they Rejoice so it's just totally
[36:43] we're just you know why
[36:45] we're Kingdom people but not this
[36:48] Kingdom
[36:49] this world is not my home
[36:52] I'm just passing through
[36:54] brother brother uh Howell Thomas just
[36:57] passed through
[36:58] but thank God
[37:00] he influenced a lot of lives before he
[37:03] passed on through and the Lord knew that
[37:04] and that's why he got him here
[37:07] around us I believe God sends people in
[37:09] our midst to tell us
[37:11] that he loves us
[37:13] and he loves us through a group of
[37:15] people that loves each other
[37:17] that has a church family that is
[37:19] stronger than a than a than a natural
[37:21] family
[37:23] Revelations 19 6 and you can be seated
[37:26] and I heard it is the word of the voice
[37:27] of a great multitude and the voice of
[37:28] many Waters and the voice of Mighty
[37:30] thunderings saying hallelujah for the
[37:32] Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be
[37:36] glad and rejoice and give honor to him
[37:37] for the marriage of the Lamb has come
[37:40] and his wife
[37:43] were getting to a wife
[37:45] brother Brown called us bride
[37:48] but we're heading toward a wife because
[37:50] when he was calling them bride they were
[37:52] not mature they were just babbling
[37:54] Pentecostal babies it did not understand
[37:56] what was going on amen but it was for a
[38:00] mature group for that group that wasn't
[38:02] there brother around said it's not for
[38:03] you
[38:04] all right well this is for us
[38:06] this is a mature wife June we've been
[38:09] married 40 something years here coming
[38:10] up in a few weeks we know each other
[38:13] more now than we ever have she's my wife
[38:16] she was my bride at one time now she's
[38:18] my wife but remember we have a life
[38:20] together so we got to do as brother Ryan
[38:22] said our life together with our lover
[38:24] should be read his word read his love
[38:27] letter talk to him all right and to her
[38:31] was granted that she should be arrayed
[38:33] and find linen clean and white for the
[38:35] fine linen is a righteousness
[38:37] of saints and thank God for me and you
[38:39] the promise to us is is we won't get
[38:41] that white robe over there
[38:45] you're wearing it right now if you're
[38:46] born again
[38:47] all right so you don't have to worry
[38:48] about going changing clothes
[38:50] no those white robes
[38:53] she should be a raid in Final End and
[38:55] clean and white for the fine linen is
[38:58] the righteousness of saints you may be
[39:00] seated
[39:01] First Peter 1 verse 22 we'll get to
[39:05] um
[39:06] a little bit of I still want to continue
[39:08] on being born again because being born
[39:10] again is something you it's very
[39:12] important but we have to make sure that
[39:14] we know as as brother um
[39:17] uh we were talking
[39:19] um several well last week brother Andrew
[39:22] Glover about
[39:24] um and and you know he gets around and
[39:26] he preaches to many places and and he
[39:29] was in agreeance with me that that
[39:31] growth and the message is not really
[39:33] preached a lot
[39:35] it's just believe the message have a
[39:37] good time you know let the preacher get
[39:39] loud and let him start running and you
[39:41] start running and you start shouting and
[39:42] he starts shouting and I'm telling you
[39:44] I'm sorry that's just it's just
[39:46] Pentecostal babies I'm not saying
[39:47] they're not born again I'm just saying
[39:49] there's not the growth has to be
[39:51] preached from the pulpit
[39:53] you cannot get growth without eating and
[39:57] you gotta eat the right kind of food all
[40:00] right and the right kind of food is a
[40:02] five-fold Ministry folded up five times
[40:05] and given out to me and you from a
[40:08] Pulpit through the foolishness of
[40:11] preaching
[40:12] and teaching which we have
[40:14] and have been
[40:16] but we still got to grow more
[40:18] we still got our mandate is to continue
[40:20] to grow that little caterpillar he just
[40:22] eats and eats you know why because the
[40:24] caterpillar can't fly
[40:26] we need Eagles that can fly he's an
[40:29] Earthbound creature but there's
[40:30] something inside of him
[40:32] there's something inside of him that
[40:34] wants to fly
[40:36] all right
[40:37] I'll actually say Amen if you don't want
[40:40] to
[40:41] and hallelujah thank you buddy
[40:43] seeing you have purified your souls in
[40:45] obeying the truth look seeing you up
[40:48] here we're going to talk about that
[40:49] today we're going to pull your body
[40:51] apart how yucky is that kids we're going
[40:54] to pull your body apart Body Spirit and
[40:56] soul we're going to see how this statue
[40:58] of perfect man affects us in our life as
[41:02] a Christian because if you're not a
[41:03] Christian you're not going up the statue
[41:05] of perfect man all right if you're not
[41:07] born again you're not going up this
[41:08] night you're a perfect man if you're not
[41:09] born again you are dead
[41:13] but we want to die
[41:16] countable paradox we want to die Paul
[41:19] tells us in a few minutes we'll look at
[41:21] the word mortify
[41:23] mortify comes into the word mortician or
[41:26] to be stiff and to be dead all right
[41:29] seeing you have purified your souls and
[41:31] obeying the truth through the spirit on
[41:33] the unfeigned level of the Brethren all
[41:35] right how does that Channel Through the
[41:36] Brethren through the brotherly kindness
[41:38] as we were talking about see that you
[41:40] love another with a pure heart fervently
[41:42] being born again
[41:44] not of corruptable seed or corruptable
[41:46] word
[41:47] but of Incorruptible that's what
[41:50] happened and we'll talk about this down
[41:51] through the church ages I want you to
[41:53] understand the importance of the full
[41:55] word being back here today
[41:57] I said today current today this day
[42:00] 2023
[42:02] September 24th all right
[42:05] being born again not of corruptable seed
[42:07] but of Incorruptible by the word of God
[42:13] that's doing what he said
[42:15] which liveth in the Bible forever and
[42:17] that word being is begotten again be
[42:19] born again now not to be now listen I
[42:22] want you to understand
[42:24] that's why we're going to pull this
[42:25] thing apart once you're born again in
[42:27] your soul you don't have to be reborn
[42:29] you are a born-again believer
[42:33] but why would Paul say being
[42:36] born again why would he say you got to
[42:38] keep growing you got to keep going all
[42:41] right to produce again
[42:44] listen you are a child of the King today
[42:48] if you're born again
[42:50] you're in the family of God
[42:52] sealed signed and ready to go
[42:56] if something were to happen but God
[42:59] doesn't want you to stay a baby
[43:01] God didn't stay a baby in Jesus Christ
[43:05] he came to full maturity so he wants you
[43:07] to do the same thing you know why we'll
[43:09] look at it this afternoon we got to get
[43:11] to that adoption part to where not only
[43:14] do you get a checkbook you get a
[43:16] checkbook when you're born again with
[43:18] Jesus name signed on it you just sign
[43:20] what you need and hand it brother Brown
[43:22] says hand it to the bank of heaven and
[43:24] they'll fulfill it but there'll come a
[43:26] time
[43:27] this is the time
[43:29] when God will give you a blank check
[43:34] and you sign it
[43:36] for whatever you need
[43:38] if you speak to this mountain
[43:41] don't wait on Jesus to sign it you sign
[43:44] it
[43:46] that ought to excite you
[43:50] but he won't give you that empty check
[43:53] blank check if he knows you're gonna
[43:55] write it for something else
[43:57] that's why maturity that's why you got
[43:58] to come to the maturity of the word of
[44:00] God that you'll know how to use it when
[44:03] you can when you get it you'll know how
[44:04] to use that check book we know we can't
[44:07] outright checks we can't bankrupt heaven
[44:11] all right but you can write a check
[44:14] that may not be what God wants you to
[44:17] write it to
[44:18] but by maturity we know exactly
[44:22] adoption is the mind of God being in you
[44:24] so much to where your mind just goes
[44:26] away
[44:27] and to praise God that's what I want all
[44:30] right I've got too much of my thinking
[44:31] going on Amen I hope you do too I hope
[44:34] you stinking thinking is what we always
[44:35] said get rid of your stinking thinking
[44:39] brother Brown said you must be born
[44:40] again 1961 so no matter how much we
[44:43] think try to think we're right and
[44:45] saying a Creed or joining a church
[44:46] you're still what you were until you're
[44:49] actually born again
[44:50] all right
[44:52] of the spirit of God it doesn't change
[44:54] you what those Creeds your Creeds join
[44:56] in church are just coming to the message
[44:58] or just saying I believe brother Byron
[45:00] was a Prophet come on somebody I've read
[45:02] 12 books and 12 tapes I got stars and I
[45:05] can read and I can do
[45:08] let's get born again first
[45:11] get down to the basic get back into this
[45:13] because listen the message doesn't birth
[45:16] you
[45:18] this birst you
[45:20] brother Branham doesn't birth you Jesus
[45:23] Christ verse you all right that's why I
[45:26] believe too we need to get back to the
[45:27] Bible and get down to the basis of where
[45:29] God is the one that's in control but if
[45:32] you ever get born again I'll promise you
[45:34] in the name of the Lord Jesus you'll
[45:36] come to this message and you'll have an
[45:38] understanding like you never had before
[45:40] but you can until you're born again
[45:43] all right so that's the most important
[45:45] thing if brother Brown said that 60
[45:47] years ago it's still important that you
[45:49] get born again and know that you are
[45:52] know that God's done something in your
[45:54] life and you're walking even though you
[45:55] may be in sanctification but God's done
[45:57] something in your life
[46:00] as your brother Ryan said it's not just
[46:01] we don't believe in Alcoholics Anonymous
[46:05] it's a good program for somebody to go
[46:07] through but you know what they tell you
[46:09] what's an alcoholic what always an
[46:12] alcoholic uh-uh you get born again
[46:16] that won't happen again
[46:18] everybody with me
[46:20] because why because whatever that is is
[46:23] you is in a a you're just suppressing it
[46:26] we don't want to suppress something we
[46:29] want it dead
[46:31] and when it's dead it will never bother
[46:34] you again
[46:38] your Creed joining church or changing
[46:40] your ideas
[46:42] are your good intentions although as
[46:44] good as it might seem it's still not
[46:46] right there's something got to happen
[46:48] the new birth is an experience
[46:51] put something that takes place
[46:54] so it's not that you bring it's not that
[46:57] that brings the new birth now the
[46:58] different churches that say well you
[47:00] accept this or believe that but it isn't
[47:02] same way with the message Believers all
[47:04] you gotta do is believe the message no
[47:06] the devil believes a message he was
[47:07] right there every brother around spoke
[47:08] it
[47:11] acts 1 verse 8 says but you shall
[47:13] receive power after
[47:15] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[47:19] after you get the new birth is when your
[47:21] power or that dunamis is going to take
[47:23] over and yeah you're gonna have problems
[47:26] yeah that that old thing is going to
[47:27] still try to come back but remember the
[47:30] reason I did it is because it was part
[47:32] of me
[47:33] as brother Ryan said the reason the
[47:35] pornography is the smoking the drink
[47:36] whatever I mean your laundry list may
[47:38] not be his or mine all right but you all
[47:41] had a problem and it was seated in your
[47:43] soul
[47:44] your soul
[47:46] it was a very part of you you didn't
[47:49] have a problem doing it
[47:51] before God took a hold of you
[47:54] but when God got a hold of you he just
[47:57] took that whole wall out
[48:01] the Bible says you shall be Witnesses
[48:04] what would be a witness if you meet him
[48:05] in a liquor store every three or four
[48:07] times a week
[48:10] you'd be a witness all right
[48:13] so let's look at this to make the
[48:16] importance of this age and I want you to
[48:19] remember in the back of your mind
[48:21] what brother Brown said he said every
[48:23] age got a blessing and every age got a
[48:26] curse right or a salutation uh you're
[48:30] doing good but
[48:33] but remember the last age
[48:36] read Revelations 3 14.
[48:38] there is no good
[48:40] for that age
[48:43] only that we ought to know where to buy
[48:45] the ice at them where we need to buy all
[48:47] these different things
[48:48] but you and I are in the worst age
[48:52] that ever was
[48:54] and God knew that that's why I put you
[48:56] here
[48:57] why put you here but Revelations 3 14
[49:00] tells us that we have come to a place
[49:04] that we get all this
[49:06] Plus
[49:08] they took a prophet to stand one day and
[49:10] say hey ever blessing the church got
[49:13] from all seven Church ages is in this
[49:16] age
[49:17] and all the cursings that was in the all
[49:19] the Ages come here
[49:22] because we'll read it this afternoon I
[49:24] didn't interject it today maybe just one
[49:25] scripture
[49:26] the Bible says that I that God hates
[49:30] the Deeds of the Nicolaitans
[49:33] then the next scripture says the
[49:35] doctrine of the Nicolaitans in other
[49:37] words you and I today we have a Doctrine
[49:40] when you first come to the message you
[49:43] probably didn't see water baptism you
[49:45] probably didn't see one God
[49:48] now don't tell me you saw it all at once
[49:52] come on
[49:54] but as we kept what washing by the right
[49:58] water
[49:59] amen we come to a realization of these
[50:02] great Mysteries
[50:04] amen
[50:06] right but there's some that won't
[50:08] that's something that'll pass through
[50:09] and never get it I'm sorry
[50:12] but you and I
[50:14] are given all also all the power of
[50:17] those ages
[50:19] remember lionox man and Eagle we're in
[50:21] the eagle age but the prophet of God
[50:23] said you and I
[50:25] would have all four of those which is
[50:27] the Holy Ghost In the End Time amen
[50:30] because just to make it through the day
[50:33] you have to have that ox
[50:38] labor
[50:39] get me through Lord
[50:41] listen if I'm preaching to people that
[50:43] don't need that then wouldn't it all go
[50:44] to the house
[50:46] okay all right so we are
[50:49] we are we are the ones that need the
[50:51] lion we need the boldness
[50:53] amen
[50:55] we need the Ops we need to labor I've
[50:57] got to get up tomorrow's Monday
[51:01] it hits old people too it's us worse we
[51:04] try to recharge on Saturday and Sunday
[51:06] and sometimes we don't plug in fast
[51:08] enough to do what's up
[51:10] right she said right
[51:12] but we're still though we have a life to
[51:15] live and we've got to go to the lion the
[51:17] ox
[51:18] the man would listen you need
[51:19] intelligence too you need God's
[51:21] intelligence
[51:22] God's knowledge to defeat the Devil
[51:25] that's something it's going to defeat
[51:27] the Devil you're not going to listen
[51:29] get me right you're not going to say
[51:31] well I'm just going to pray every minute
[51:32] of every day that's not going to
[51:37] one word of authority
[51:40] one word of authority Authority beats
[51:43] years of praying one word of authority
[51:45] that's why we have to come to Authority
[51:47] in this age
[51:49] because what happened in the other ages
[51:51] look in Revelation 6 4 these horse
[51:54] riders we'll get into that when we get
[51:56] in the seals which will be up there in
[51:57] the Capstone
[51:59] that's why it's so important
[52:01] but God give them a power they didn't
[52:04] have one
[52:05] and then went out another horse it was
[52:07] red and power was given to him
[52:09] a permitted power brother they'll
[52:11] preached on this many many years ago
[52:13] Satan has a permitted power God permits
[52:16] him to do things God permitted him to
[52:18] jump on Joe but he just didn't know he
[52:21] just thought he was going to destroy job
[52:22] but he made job stronger
[52:25] it makes us stronger to go through
[52:27] difficulties it makes us stronger to go
[52:29] through trials like I said before
[52:31] tragedy does not destroy a Christian
[52:35] if you get destroyed by a tragedy go
[52:38] back and get Christ
[52:39] amen
[52:41] get born again it'll give you a whole
[52:44] new perspective on your life
[52:46] now remember Christ in the true church
[52:49] is a continuation of the book of Acts
[52:52] but the Book of Revelation shows how
[52:54] that the Antichrist Spirit would come
[52:56] into the church now come into church
[53:00] a lot more bar rooms more prostitutes
[53:02] more heathens more this the church
[53:05] Titan's not worried about the world
[53:07] today he's worried about this church
[53:09] he doesn't want this church to grow he
[53:11] does he wants his church to fail
[53:16] but if he can't make you fail
[53:19] he'll make you lukewarm
[53:22] formal
[53:25] God bless you
[53:27] and Powerless
[53:30] hmm
[53:32] everybody still believe brother Ryan was
[53:34] a prophet well that was a quote from him
[53:36] right there so take him all right
[53:38] revelation of Jesus Christ
[53:41] this is in the 1960 the books the church
[53:44] age book
[53:45] Jesus Christ is God now talking about
[53:48] Revelation it's Jehovah the Old
[53:49] Testament Jesus and the new no matter
[53:51] how excuse me how hard you try you can't
[53:54] prove the three gods
[53:57] now there was a lot of you come up that
[53:59] you swore by three Gods you swore by
[54:01] trinitarian Doctrine you swore by all
[54:03] these things right
[54:05] which what brother Brown said that come
[54:06] from the pits of hell because anything
[54:08] contrary to God is the devil
[54:10] anything there is no uh there is no
[54:13] third person
[54:15] Hallelujah there's no third person it's
[54:17] either God or the devil all right that's
[54:19] your two powers
[54:21] God has all of it he gives Satan part of
[54:23] it to do what drive us
[54:26] as the prophet said drive us to our
[54:28] homeland as he drove turn loose on six
[54:31] million Jews from the devil to send them
[54:33] back to their Homeland
[54:35] so thank God for the trials
[54:39] make this trial a blessing it'll put you
[54:42] on your knees
[54:43] can you really say that are you gonna go
[54:46] sit in the closet and go oh why is this
[54:47] happening to me
[54:49] weakling
[54:52] weakling
[54:56] it also takes a revelation by the Holy
[54:58] Spirit to make you understand that
[55:00] you know we can by repetition we can say
[55:03] God's one God's one God's one there's
[55:06] only one God
[55:08] well the devil knows that the Bible says
[55:10] and trembles because of it
[55:14] I mean he's literally in front of
[55:17] thought
[55:20] right now
[55:22] accusing us
[55:23] but right now the devil is not going hey
[55:26] I need to talk to Jesus hey father can I
[55:29] he knows that guy's one
[55:31] he knows there's never been but one God
[55:34] but what does he turn around and do and
[55:36] filter through his stinking thinking he
[55:39] filters it to the Earth and fills his
[55:41] horse
[55:42] will the father son Holy Ghost baptism
[55:44] fill this will eternitarian
[55:46] Doctrine
[55:48] all except for just a little group of
[55:49] people
[55:51] tell you how shrewd he is that's how
[55:52] Shruti is
[55:54] he knows
[55:55] when one God
[55:56] but he feeds you a trinity
[55:59] you know why because
[56:00] because permitted
[56:02] that for him to what deceive
[56:05] and see if you would accept that
[56:06] deception or take the truth of God as
[56:09] brother Ryan says listen we're all free
[56:11] moral agents
[56:13] you will be until the day you perish or
[56:15] the day we take a body change you will
[56:18] and are a free moral agent
[56:20] now listen
[56:22] if you're born again today
[56:25] in your soul
[56:26] you're not
[56:33] can I get one amen thank you all right
[56:36] in your soul that's either God or the
[56:38] devil now God is not a compromiser God
[56:41] doesn't lose God doesn't ever have a
[56:44] moment that he goes well I don't know if
[56:45] I want to do that or not you see what
[56:47] you get at the new birth you get the
[56:49] very soul of God a piece of him
[56:52] doesn't just come in and get beside you
[56:56] I thought he burnt that old you out
[56:59] and put him in and then he molds with
[57:03] your character come on somebody he molds
[57:06] with that character you've got
[57:12] to give you
[57:14] the ability to teach
[57:17] the ability to pray
[57:19] I don't pray a lot I'm sorry my dad will
[57:22] even agree with you with that because
[57:24] he's not he's not prayer Warrior
[57:26] we pray as we walk through life just
[57:28] walking through life looking we were
[57:30] praying all the time
[57:32] you don't have to get behind something
[57:33] get in front of something and get on
[57:35] your knees it would be nice because you
[57:37] know what you get a tragedy that's when
[57:39] you do hit your knees when it affects
[57:41] you all right
[57:43] hey man
[57:45] it takes a revelation to see that
[57:47] Jehovah of the Old Testament is Jesus of
[57:49] the new
[57:50] Satan crept into the church and blinded
[57:53] the people to this truth how did he
[57:57] blind to people wheat Pulpit he got in
[58:00] the preachers
[58:03] he got in the preachers and that the
[58:06] preacher then delivered that false
[58:09] Doctrine to the people
[58:11] and they eat it
[58:13] that's why they conquered the
[58:15] Nicolaitans is Conquering the laity Nico
[58:19] as conquer word to conquer from pulpit
[58:22] word all false Doctrine comes from
[58:25] pulpit
[58:28] Satan crept into the church and blinded
[58:31] the people to this truth and when they
[58:33] were blinded to it it wasn't long until
[58:35] the Church of Rome stopped baptizing in
[58:38] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[58:43] you want to make a Baptist mad
[58:47] because they hate Catholics I mean they
[58:49] really do they say the mother
[58:51] they're this they're that I mean they're
[58:52] pretty thank God we got somebody that
[58:55] just you know let's not wishy-washy like
[58:56] a Methodist
[58:58] drove by the other day and um
[59:01] uh there was a preacher there at one of
[59:03] the Methodist churches on my route and
[59:05] it's a it's a color Church the Amy
[59:08] So Randy Jones has been the pastor
[59:09] forever how long I've been there you
[59:11] know his name's on the thing Randy Jones
[59:13] that means he's a man
[59:15] well the other day they voted to be
[59:17] whatever that was with the other
[59:18] Methodist people and and now that name's
[59:21] gone and sister Mercy somebody I can't
[59:24] remember when I saw that word I thought
[59:25] no they did not but they did they
[59:28] elected a woman preacher
[59:30] so anyway
[59:32] but if you want to make a Baptist Matt
[59:35] tell him they're say look that baptism
[59:37] that you got Tom Fox did the same thing
[59:40] I'm glad Tom was so big that people
[59:42] didn't really hurt that man if he'd have
[59:45] been a little pity guy he got whipped
[59:47] but he was so big and strong he'd say
[59:49] your baptism come from the same place
[59:52] from hell yeah he said your baptism came
[59:55] from that Catholic Church that you say
[59:57] you hate
[59:58] you won't make a Baptist man you tell
[1:00:00] him that
[1:00:04] be ready to Bob and weave
[1:00:06] because it'll make them mad it will make
[1:00:09] them literally mad but it's the truth
[1:00:12] that's where it all came from and it's
[1:00:13] of the devil
[1:00:15] all right
[1:00:17] so brother Brown said look the
[1:00:18] resurrection West Palm Beach
[1:00:20] see I don't want to blame you people
[1:00:22] it's the pulpits where it started
[1:00:25] no wonder that's the damnation of the
[1:00:27] country when Satan got into Pulpit it's
[1:00:30] the truth
[1:00:31] all right failing to preach the
[1:00:33] unadulterated word of God
[1:00:36] and the word of God will produce exactly
[1:00:39] what it said it would do
[1:00:41] listen stop for a minute that's why we
[1:00:43] need a prophet that's why we had to have
[1:00:45] somebody to restore the word back but we
[1:00:47] explain it all away
[1:00:50] it's all the way is for some other days
[1:00:52] for some other person I can't live this
[1:00:54] no you can't
[1:00:57] God's got to live it through you
[1:00:59] in the masterpiece 1964.
[1:01:02] the prophet of God said notice this
[1:01:05] masterpiece when Satan got a hold of it
[1:01:06] the deceiver broke through the walls
[1:01:08] marked the Masterpiece listen there
[1:01:11] wasn't a crisis meeting in heaven God
[1:01:12] knew this was going to happen
[1:01:15] because that's the way he did it how'd
[1:01:17] he do it I'll go more into detail of it
[1:01:19] how do you do it the Masterpiece was
[1:01:21] walled by the word of God
[1:01:24] right Adam and Eve he's talking about
[1:01:25] and the Masterpiece itself of the family
[1:01:28] was fortified by this word
[1:01:32] I was thinking the other day
[1:01:34] I'll um
[1:01:36] um address it to you a little bit now
[1:01:38] you think about you take brother Howe
[1:01:40] for example he's passed on all right he
[1:01:41] used to live this life passed on but you
[1:01:43] know that was the time that God was
[1:01:44] standing in eternity he said I'm going
[1:01:45] to have a house Thomas
[1:01:47] he's going to come on this Earth he's
[1:01:49] going to be XYZ he's going to have kids
[1:01:51] he knows all that and I'm going to take
[1:01:53] him home on September the 23rd
[1:01:55] not not a surprise to anybody but maybe
[1:01:59] us all right
[1:02:01] but he's standing there and it's just
[1:02:02] the way I think he's standing there in
[1:02:04] eternity but he steps over and he gets
[1:02:06] into time when and he starts into time
[1:02:08] with Adam and Eve and he's like man
[1:02:10] they're going to do it they're they're
[1:02:12] gonna they're gonna bring the ones I
[1:02:14] want he knew they wasn't
[1:02:15] but he was gracious anyway when he put
[1:02:17] him in flesh he knew they would fall so
[1:02:19] they failed now God didn't say now
[1:02:22] how in the world am I going to get Hal
[1:02:23] Thomas here
[1:02:26] no he said
[1:02:28] don't worry
[1:02:29] whatever it was 1937 or whatever year
[1:02:32] was born
[1:02:34] he put two and two together
[1:02:36] and got him here
[1:02:38] you will not interrupt the plan of God
[1:02:41] Satan did not interrupt the plan of God
[1:02:43] how Thomas was coming to the Earth
[1:02:45] because God thought of him and he knew
[1:02:47] when he brought him here he would want
[1:02:49] the Holy Ghost and God would give him
[1:02:50] the Holy Ghost and then he would get him
[1:02:52] and cross paths with a prophet
[1:02:56] some may hate that
[1:02:58] but I hope he crossed your path one day
[1:03:01] I hope God crossed your path one day and
[1:03:03] then he sent you across the path of a
[1:03:04] prophet
[1:03:05] the message of the hour God's word the
[1:03:08] word of God restored
[1:03:10] not to worry of God made different man
[1:03:12] has made it different right
[1:03:15] the prophet of God came to restore the
[1:03:16] word restore the altar restore worship
[1:03:19] just as Elijah did
[1:03:21] but he brought all the hell here and he
[1:03:23] said okay I got him here
[1:03:28] won't take him home because his journey
[1:03:30] is over
[1:03:31] and I'm going to put him back into
[1:03:33] condition I saw him in before the
[1:03:35] foundation of the world
[1:03:37] take that with you today and don't worry
[1:03:41] about death
[1:03:45] brother Brown said remember when I'm
[1:03:46] across the curtain of time he said don't
[1:03:48] bother me no more why in the world would
[1:03:50] that bother me now
[1:03:52] Amen to not have to go back to that he
[1:03:55] was talking about his body laying on
[1:03:57] deteriorating
[1:04:00] brother Hal had had his body had been
[1:04:03] deteriorating as as all our bodies are
[1:04:07] because of the curse of sin
[1:04:09] on the body part
[1:04:11] but that Soul inside of him is is
[1:04:13] twirling a million miles a second
[1:04:16] see that's the Paradox you look at an
[1:04:18] older person you see ones that are
[1:04:20] they're getting weaker and different
[1:04:21] things but inside of them is a Dynamo
[1:04:24] inside of them is an eternal
[1:04:27] person
[1:04:28] encapsulated that's why sin I was
[1:04:30] thinking about this yesterday
[1:04:32] sin that's how horrible sin is
[1:04:36] it will continue to make your body old
[1:04:39] wore out weak but inside of you if
[1:04:42] you're born again today you're 18 years
[1:04:44] old
[1:04:48] man I was watching a football game
[1:04:50] yesterday and the guy got hit he flipped
[1:04:52] up up in the air landed on his back
[1:04:55] jumped up run back in the Huddle I
[1:04:56] thought
[1:04:58] thank you
[1:05:00] number one I wouldn't be out there
[1:05:03] but if I was I'd still be laying there
[1:05:09] but that's the curse of sin
[1:05:11] we've come to a place but inside of you
[1:05:13] though
[1:05:14] brother Raymond said he said it's that
[1:05:16] soul
[1:05:18] that God's dealing with the soul of you
[1:05:22] that's why then we don't worry about the
[1:05:24] we're all falling apart
[1:05:26] talking about the world falling apart
[1:05:28] talk about your body falling apart
[1:05:30] but we as Christians realize though that
[1:05:33] every time that hurt happens there's
[1:05:34] something inside of you that says we're
[1:05:36] going home
[1:05:39] let me
[1:05:41] know somebody ever say that you know let
[1:05:43] it out oh oh okay
[1:05:45] okay this masterpiece was wall by the
[1:05:48] word in other words God's word and the
[1:05:50] Masterpiece itself of the family was
[1:05:51] fortified by this word what husband and
[1:05:54] wife to bring forth his children but the
[1:05:56] broken part that was broke off of the
[1:05:58] original went out beyond that wall he's
[1:06:01] talking about Eve and it gives Satan a
[1:06:03] chance tomorrow
[1:06:06] now as you know what I believe he's
[1:06:07] talking about serpent seed
[1:06:09] but the great sculptor when he seen the
[1:06:11] fall of his family the Masterpiece he
[1:06:13] wasn't willing just to leave it lay
[1:06:14] there in other words he doesn't going to
[1:06:16] just stay there and go well why was he
[1:06:19] wowzy woo I had all these kids I was
[1:06:21] going to have brother Hal Thomas and all
[1:06:22] you brother and sisters sitting here
[1:06:24] with a new birth
[1:06:25] I ain't got no way to get you out now no
[1:06:29] he had to be a savior
[1:06:31] he had attributes of Redeemer healer
[1:06:35] your father
[1:06:36] become the son
[1:06:38] and leaving you with the Holy Ghost
[1:06:40] couldn't do that in that Eternal
[1:06:42] condition
[1:06:43] but he's bringing it back
[1:06:47] oh it ought to make you happy we ought
[1:06:49] not be sad we are not be sad for nothing
[1:06:54] he wasn't willing that it would perish
[1:06:57] he went back to work to build it up
[1:06:58] again the same way with the church
[1:07:00] listen he had a bride in the first
[1:07:01] church age and he told him immediately
[1:07:03] he said you've left your first love
[1:07:06] I'm gonna have to divorce you because
[1:07:08] you took up these deeds and doctrines of
[1:07:10] the Nicolaitans
[1:07:11] that's why Regis in a few minutes
[1:07:13] brother Ryan said there's been Brides
[1:07:14] brides churches Brides
[1:07:16] am I with me
[1:07:19] he wasn't willing it should perish lay
[1:07:21] there
[1:07:22] all the time he's got he will not be
[1:07:25] defeated
[1:07:30] he said I'll put in
[1:07:32] put in I can see God he's standing there
[1:07:34] you know he's talking to Adam and Eve
[1:07:36] right come on somebody he's standing
[1:07:37] there talking to Adam and Eve in the
[1:07:38] garden
[1:07:39] he's getting ready to run him out of the
[1:07:40] garden
[1:07:42] he said hi
[1:07:44] don't worry
[1:07:46] I'm bringing you back
[1:07:49] and whatever you got I'm going to
[1:07:52] restore back
[1:07:53] cause I'm gonna do it I'm gone I'm gonna
[1:07:57] be human flesh I'm gonna be your savior
[1:08:01] I'm not going to depend on Adam anymore
[1:08:04] you're going to depend on me
[1:08:08] I love that that was a great promise as
[1:08:10] brother Ram said as the Skin's flapped
[1:08:12] on their legs as they walked out of the
[1:08:13] garden he said don't worry
[1:08:16] I'm gonna fix this thing
[1:08:18] he will not be defeated he went to work
[1:08:20] immediately began to build
[1:08:26] his cross now he's building what another
[1:08:28] image his body the bride
[1:08:32] but he doesn't want a bride he wants a
[1:08:34] wife
[1:08:37] or he would have said the Bride made
[1:08:39] herself ready he didn't he said the wife
[1:08:43] all right look perfect man Church age
[1:08:46] how can you tell you test Spirits apart
[1:08:48] just give them the word test
[1:08:51] if they don't speak that word they are
[1:08:53] of the evil one
[1:08:54] excuse me as the evil one deceived the
[1:08:58] first two Brides
[1:09:00] he will try to deceive the Bride of this
[1:09:03] last day
[1:09:04] by trying to get her to what hybridize
[1:09:06] herself through Creeds or just plainly
[1:09:09] turned from the word to any sign that
[1:09:11] suits her
[1:09:12] we say that now
[1:09:14] but God never placed signs ahead of the
[1:09:16] word
[1:09:17] signs follow the word that's when Elijah
[1:09:20] told the woman to bake him a cake first
[1:09:22] according to the word of the Lord when
[1:09:24] she did is the word said the proper sign
[1:09:26] came that's what we're looking at where
[1:09:27] we gotta get the word first
[1:09:30] we ought to get the word right first
[1:09:33] come to the word first and then watch
[1:09:35] the miracle the seed word is energized
[1:09:39] by the spirit today is as the brothers
[1:09:41] have been speaking that we've had come
[1:09:43] they all kind of been one mind one of
[1:09:44] Court we need to be happy about this
[1:09:47] place
[1:09:48] what do you be happy about the place
[1:09:50] we're in if you're not happy about your
[1:09:52] place in you need to be born again
[1:09:57] are we really excited about coming to
[1:09:59] church
[1:10:02] really you better ask yourself that
[1:10:05] question
[1:10:12] can't get some of you don't cross your
[1:10:14] hands
[1:10:16] listen I'm telling you you can have all
[1:10:18] kind of you can be built different but
[1:10:21] don't tell me that the word of God don't
[1:10:22] energize you and make you at least say
[1:10:24] Amen every once in a while you ain't
[1:10:26] born again
[1:10:29] well you get quiet so you because some
[1:10:31] of you do that how can any messenger
[1:10:33] sent from God believe only part of the
[1:10:35] word that's why I'm telling you how can
[1:10:36] we only believe part well we believe
[1:10:38] brother Brown was a problem
[1:10:40] brother Dale was our great teacher he he
[1:10:42] did good by the way he's just trying to
[1:10:45] do the best you can
[1:10:47] um
[1:10:48] he's bringing in these brothers trying
[1:10:49] to help us out a little bit
[1:10:51] and uh brother Aaron he's good but Bob
[1:10:54] he's good brother Louise he good we got
[1:10:57] some good oh Lord Jesus
[1:11:01] oh Lord
[1:11:03] y'all not be that way
[1:11:08] because as brother Andrew and I were
[1:11:10] talking the other day if you take what
[1:11:13] other people preach
[1:11:15] in these other churches
[1:11:17] excuse me
[1:11:20] it ain't all the truth
[1:11:25] and some of us that go out Say Amen
[1:11:30] but I believe we have the truth
[1:11:33] I don't believe we have atres
[1:11:36] and I'm bragging on God I'm not bragging
[1:11:38] on one person you start bragging on
[1:11:40] people and the Lord to say no it's um
[1:11:41] I'm number one
[1:11:44] all right same way with brother Brown
[1:11:46] you put so much on brother Brown that's
[1:11:48] why I believe God had to take him home
[1:11:50] if brother Ryan would have stayed with
[1:11:51] everyone been Jeffersonville would have
[1:11:53] been the only church in the world
[1:11:55] right
[1:11:57] but he didn't have that he had Apostles
[1:11:59] prophets pastors teachers and
[1:12:00] evangelists to preach this message
[1:12:04] preach it right you saw brother we can't
[1:12:06] keep it straight you better get
[1:12:08] somewhere else
[1:12:10] you can't keep it straight if you got
[1:12:12] the Holy Ghost why can't the Holy Ghost
[1:12:13] keep his own word straight
[1:12:15] sure he will
[1:12:18] need somebody in the Pulpit with the
[1:12:21] Holy Ghost brother Ryan said backside of
[1:12:23] the devil the backside of the devil
[1:12:26] you're right back side of the desert
[1:12:27] experience
[1:12:29] kick the devil on the backside
[1:12:34] you got to be happy
[1:12:37] if you're not happy about what you're in
[1:12:40] find something find something makes you
[1:12:42] happy I swear please find something that
[1:12:44] makes you happy this makes me happy
[1:12:50] How can any messenger sent from God
[1:12:52] believe only a part of the word and deny
[1:12:54] some of it
[1:12:55] the true prophet of God in this last day
[1:12:57] will proclaim the whole word
[1:13:00] denominations we'll hate him
[1:13:03] his words may be as harsh as John the
[1:13:05] Baptist who called him vipers and snakes
[1:13:07] we think we're harsh every once in a
[1:13:09] while but the predestinated will hear
[1:13:12] look and be ready for the rapture
[1:13:15] ready for the Rapture all right I'm glad
[1:13:18] you got that Revelation thank you
[1:13:20] God bless you huh oh thank you sister
[1:13:23] Christine bless your heart
[1:13:28] foreign
[1:13:30] the Royal Seed of Abraham that's us to
[1:13:33] the born again with light Faith as
[1:13:35] Abraham will hold to the word listen 40
[1:13:38] years 50 years 20 years 30 years hold on
[1:13:45] for they are predestinated together
[1:13:49] the first seal brother round was talking
[1:13:51] about
[1:13:53] he's talking about the church and he
[1:13:54] brings he keeps saying church he says
[1:13:56] church not to Christ but the church
[1:13:58] keeps saying church but then he stops
[1:14:01] he stops and he goes uh uh uh no that
[1:14:04] makes me tremble what you know what I
[1:14:06] believe he got a revelation
[1:14:07] God said don't call them church anymore
[1:14:10] he said you call my bride
[1:14:13] oh my that just makes me tremble I hope
[1:14:16] that the church truly understands it see
[1:14:18] what I mean
[1:14:19] you people I'm gonna call you bride that
[1:14:22] you'll understand so he has separated
[1:14:24] now the church from the bride as I've
[1:14:27] said many many times when brother
[1:14:28] Branham stood We Believe Irvine was a
[1:14:30] prophet right
[1:14:31] all right he stood one day and he said
[1:14:33] these denominational churches are lodges
[1:14:38] go to one
[1:14:40] you'll see a lodge
[1:14:43] Elks Lodge
[1:14:47] nothing against the Elks Club don't come
[1:14:49] right on your motorcycles up here okay
[1:14:52] nothing against them but it's not a
[1:14:54] church
[1:14:57] my brother Brian tells us across the
[1:14:59] mystery he said
[1:15:01] after all this and we'll get into it a
[1:15:03] little bit more this afternoon
[1:15:05] excuse me then we stand justified in the
[1:15:09] presence of God now what I'm going to
[1:15:12] take you to here in just a second is is
[1:15:14] now we know that the first church was a
[1:15:16] very powerful Church the first church
[1:15:18] didn't have a denomination in it
[1:15:21] First Church Age first two three two
[1:15:23] three ish before nicaea that wasn't it
[1:15:27] wasn't a Baptist in the mass of this in
[1:15:28] the Pentecostal now that was ideas and
[1:15:30] different doctrines running around but
[1:15:32] they had the power of God in the lion
[1:15:34] l-i-o-n the lion part of the Holy Ghost
[1:15:37] which was bold
[1:15:39] Silver and Gold Have I None
[1:15:41] but such as I have it didn't have to
[1:15:43] reach in his pocket
[1:15:44] such as I have given to you rise up and
[1:15:47] walk
[1:15:48] all that got eroded low down through
[1:15:50] time man started going well that was for
[1:15:53] the apostles
[1:15:55] brother Brown many many times he he
[1:15:57] reiterates that he said y'all think it
[1:15:59] was for some other age y'all think it
[1:16:01] was well you tell me when the apostolic
[1:16:03] age
[1:16:04] ceased he said but I can tell you when
[1:16:06] it began
[1:16:08] on the day of Pentecost
[1:16:10] so thank God that he sent us a prophet
[1:16:12] to steer Us in the right direction
[1:16:14] then we stand justified in the presence
[1:16:16] of God so all that
[1:16:18] to come to a full maturity you can't
[1:16:20] come to full maturity with part word
[1:16:23] all right
[1:16:24] as great as Paul was as great as iranus
[1:16:27] and Martin different ones as great as
[1:16:28] they are they couldn't come to full word
[1:16:29] because they had a little bit of
[1:16:30] doctrinal issues
[1:16:33] pieces okay loose ends as brother Brian
[1:16:36] will call him
[1:16:38] but watch what he tells us here he says
[1:16:40] but we stand justified in the presence
[1:16:42] of God
[1:16:45] that's a drop of ink drop it into a tub
[1:16:47] full of bleach
[1:16:48] you'll never find a stain that they
[1:16:50] ain't no more
[1:16:51] it went somewhere
[1:16:54] it was now it's not
[1:16:56] that was me it'll never come back again
[1:16:59] you can't reverse the process
[1:17:01] everybody with me you take in you take
[1:17:03] you take um uh Clorox you drop ink in it
[1:17:06] there's no other time that that ink is
[1:17:09] Gonna Come Back Together and be ink
[1:17:12] again gone
[1:17:14] that's the way your sins are that's the
[1:17:16] way my sins are your sins are if we'll
[1:17:18] believe that that bleach blood of Jesus
[1:17:19] Christ will do it for us and when man is
[1:17:22] truly redeemed now look that doesn't
[1:17:23] mean that they were halfway but when
[1:17:25] truly redeemed that predestinated seed
[1:17:28] that sees it and accepts it his sins are
[1:17:32] demolished
[1:17:34] gone separated dropped in the ink of the
[1:17:37] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:17:40] God will never remember it again God
[1:17:42] forgets it
[1:17:43] and he's you stand as the Son and
[1:17:46] Daughter of God in the presence of God
[1:17:47] Amen and amen now we are the sons of God
[1:17:51] not we will be we are now we are
[1:17:54] redeemed
[1:17:56] we have Satan's answer
[1:18:00] God has Vindicated himself
[1:18:02] God proves himself to his promise in
[1:18:06] this day
[1:18:08] Hallelujah the headship is here what
[1:18:11] he's declaring the son of man Ministry
[1:18:13] is there
[1:18:15] which is what it's declaring that now
[1:18:18] you can become a wife
[1:18:21] he separated the bride part y'all excuse
[1:18:24] me he separated the bride part
[1:18:27] he's got a church that used to be his
[1:18:29] bride he had to divorce them put them
[1:18:32] away now he has a bride but he doesn't
[1:18:34] want that bride to just
[1:18:38] I won't not do it if Kim was here we'd
[1:18:41] we'd come back and stand right here
[1:18:43] and for 44 years we stood right here
[1:18:49] I wouldn't be able to wear my clothes
[1:18:51] and she wouldn't be able to wear her
[1:18:52] wedding gown I promise you
[1:18:54] and she's listening now so she slapped
[1:18:56] the car or something I don't know what
[1:18:58] she's done
[1:18:58] but wouldn't that be awful though I mean
[1:19:00] it was my wife that was my bride
[1:19:03] married and we stayed at the altar
[1:19:06] never had kids never had a house we just
[1:19:09] stayed right here
[1:19:13] think about that
[1:19:16] he didn't want that
[1:19:17] he wanted us to say I do
[1:19:20] walk out the door and start a life
[1:19:23] and grow into a bride
[1:19:26] groom and a bride then grow into husband
[1:19:31] and wife
[1:19:35] see to me that's Satan's answer
[1:19:38] sure we had problems listen you can't
[1:19:40] take all your life and say well I'm
[1:19:41] proud of all this
[1:19:43] sorry
[1:19:45] let's just put in a box somewhere
[1:19:49] life's life
[1:19:51] but we believe life lessons remember
[1:19:53] tragedies are for a purpose makes us
[1:19:56] stronger
[1:19:58] we have Satan's answer God has
[1:20:00] Vindicated himself God proves himself to
[1:20:03] his promise in this day who is that me
[1:20:05] and you Hallelujah the headship is here
[1:20:07] amen Christ the Risen Lord is here the
[1:20:10] same power was resurrection that he ever
[1:20:11] was manifesting himself there's the
[1:20:14] devil's answer you can sit and talk to
[1:20:17] him all you want to
[1:20:20] but if you don't produce it
[1:20:22] if your life don't speak louder than
[1:20:25] your words
[1:20:26] Satan's just going to go
[1:20:30] I'm with you when they're not
[1:20:33] so here's my quote
[1:20:35] never since Jesus Christ was on this
[1:20:37] Earth has Satan has such a formidable
[1:20:39] opponent and let me add this
[1:20:42] that doesn't look very formidable to the
[1:20:45] world
[1:20:46] but he's hiding his power
[1:20:50] and his wife
[1:20:54] God's not a betting man
[1:20:57] but he's put everything he's got on this
[1:21:00] bride
[1:21:02] all the power all the promises
[1:21:05] everything he's got is right here on me
[1:21:07] and you
[1:21:09] you may not look out like a formidable
[1:21:11] opponent
[1:21:13] but you are
[1:21:14] oh I get beat and I get
[1:21:18] so
[1:21:22] you know what that's what Jesus has been
[1:21:24] looking for
[1:21:26] when he was standing on the earth in
[1:21:28] John 17 he said Lord I pray that they
[1:21:30] may be one like me and you are one I've
[1:21:33] read you that a hundred times to me
[1:21:34] that's the bride's prayer because what
[1:21:36] he said he said Lord don't take them out
[1:21:37] of the world but protect them
[1:21:40] all right
[1:21:41] don't take them out of the world we're
[1:21:42] going to live in the world you
[1:21:45] tomorrow call me at lunch tomorrow
[1:21:49] and say this is the best Monday I ever
[1:21:51] had in my life
[1:21:56] about a third of you might
[1:21:58] and that'll be the ones that don't work
[1:22:00] on Monday
[1:22:02] but the rest of us that's going to have
[1:22:05] to work tomorrow
[1:22:07] yeah okay
[1:22:09] but he didn't promise to take us out of
[1:22:11] the world but he promised
[1:22:12] to help us handle it
[1:22:15] every adversity we're supposed to turn
[1:22:17] death into life we're supposed to turn
[1:22:20] death a tragedy into what a party
[1:22:27] Lord of Mercy we parted in the world we
[1:22:29] can't even party when we were born again
[1:22:33] you just gotta learn how to party
[1:22:38] I don't like that well
[1:22:41] sorry
[1:22:43] it's like bro Joe Farney said he said
[1:22:45] buddy he said now he said when I was
[1:22:48] growing up of course now he was growing
[1:22:50] up in the 80s and he was
[1:22:52] carried a gun
[1:22:53] in places he shouldn't carry the gun
[1:22:56] did a lot he's told his testimony but he
[1:22:58] said oh he said he said now that was
[1:23:01] always that that black and white you
[1:23:03] know always that you know
[1:23:05] um black one in the separation he said
[1:23:08] but oh brother he said let me and that
[1:23:10] white guy get drunk
[1:23:12] yeah
[1:23:14] he said we slobber on each other we
[1:23:16] hanging on each other we saying we love
[1:23:18] you we go together go somewhere together
[1:23:20] he said you ever get drunk on the Holy
[1:23:23] Ghost
[1:23:24] he said you'll love your brother doesn't
[1:23:26] matter what color it is if you can love
[1:23:28] him and party out there why can't we
[1:23:30] love him and party in here
[1:23:32] oh wait a minute
[1:23:41] bus loose one of these days
[1:23:44] let me read this and then we'll close
[1:23:46] and it got to where I wanted to get to
[1:23:49] when you try to put the Holy Ghost it's
[1:23:51] the rising of the sun 1965. when you try
[1:23:54] to put the holy spirit in a denomination
[1:23:57] you're as much as you get a sputter
[1:23:59] you'll ruin your engine by getting it
[1:24:01] full of carbon but oh I'm so glad
[1:24:03] there's a ten thousand octane power the
[1:24:05] word of God and a holy ghost to light it
[1:24:08] up
[1:24:10] all right the word is dead laying right
[1:24:12] here
[1:24:14] it has no life at all
[1:24:17] that's got to come off inside of you
[1:24:19] then the Holy Ghost can help help you
[1:24:22] look and say oh that's me
[1:24:26] and to resurrect the power of God into a
[1:24:29] man's life or a woman's life or into a
[1:24:31] church
[1:24:33] that shoved that Cadillac down the road
[1:24:35] Yonder under the diamond Dynamic power
[1:24:37] of the Holy Ghost now he's talking about
[1:24:38] I would say he's talking about the first
[1:24:40] church and all the different things the
[1:24:41] Dynamo but then all of a sudden what
[1:24:43] happened
[1:24:45] start sputtering
[1:24:47] bring some man's ideas in
[1:24:51] that was the first Chief come up from
[1:24:53] all the prophets which is the Son of God
[1:24:55] the king of all Prophets
[1:24:56] there's been churches churches
[1:24:59] Brides brides
[1:25:01] churches Brides brides
[1:25:04] but there's got to come one
[1:25:06] Hallelujah
[1:25:10] you can say me if you want to
[1:25:12] amen our brother did there has become a
[1:25:15] real bride now not that the other ones
[1:25:17] were false they just had false ideas in
[1:25:19] them
[1:25:21] all right
[1:25:22] there has to come a real bride there
[1:25:25] must come one that not only got the
[1:25:26] mechanics but the Dynamics of it makes
[1:25:29] that church live moving the power of his
[1:25:32] resurrection until we come to that place
[1:25:35] until we find that place what good does
[1:25:37] it do to polish the hubs what good does
[1:25:39] it do to give it a facelift or those of
[1:25:41] you that don't know what simonized job
[1:25:43] is that's wax
[1:25:45] it was a company called simonizing it
[1:25:47] was called simonized wax right then
[1:25:49] there's no Dynamics in it no matter how
[1:25:51] much the mechanics prove
[1:25:56] it's proof to make it work
[1:25:58] Revelations 19 6.
[1:26:02] for hurt is the word the voice of great
[1:26:04] multitude and the voice of many Waters
[1:26:06] the voice of mighty thunderings
[1:26:07] you know I was thinking the other day
[1:26:10] it doesn't just Thunder by itself
[1:26:14] it'll help you understand the Thunders
[1:26:15] if you'll understand what I'm fixing to
[1:26:17] tell you something had to happen to make
[1:26:19] it thunder
[1:26:21] there had to be some lightning before
[1:26:23] there's a thunder
[1:26:25] all right the Thunder is an afterthought
[1:26:28] of what's already happened
[1:26:30] remember you see the lightning and then
[1:26:31] they always say count how many seconds
[1:26:33] and if you count thousand one thousand
[1:26:35] two and if it boom boom boom that means
[1:26:36] it was two miles away it struck two
[1:26:38] miles away because it took that much
[1:26:40] time for that sound
[1:26:44] to get to a year
[1:26:45] [Applause]
[1:26:46] we'll talk about that a little bit later
[1:26:48] on because we got to get in the Thunders
[1:26:50] when we get up here in the cap
[1:26:52] voice of Mighty Thunder and saying
[1:26:54] hallelujah for the Lord God omnipotent
[1:26:56] reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and
[1:26:59] give honor to him for the marriage of
[1:27:01] the Lamb has come and his wife has made
[1:27:03] herself ready to her it was granted that
[1:27:05] he she should be arrayed and find linen
[1:27:07] clean and white for the final linen is a
[1:27:10] righteousness
[1:27:11] of the Saints let's read this real quick
[1:27:13] and then we'll close
[1:27:15] the comforter 1961. there'd be drugs and
[1:27:18] drugstore but there's got to be a doctor
[1:27:21] to diagnose the case
[1:27:23] if he didn't it might kill you
[1:27:27] so therefore you've got to have a
[1:27:29] diagnosis of the case
[1:27:31] you just can't go and take a center and
[1:27:33] give him the Holy Ghost
[1:27:35] he's got to repent first
[1:27:38] he's got to be washed baptized name of
[1:27:41] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:43] his sins away he's got to be prepared
[1:27:46] for this great vitamin that's going to
[1:27:49] be given him
[1:27:50] now we have a sacred trust you know what
[1:27:52] that trust is we have an inheritance a
[1:27:55] Heritage that we inherit as believing
[1:27:57] children it's a sacred trust and that
[1:28:00] sacred trust in our sacred Heritage is
[1:28:02] the word of God what that's been given
[1:28:04] to us then he says the full word of God
[1:28:09] the word itself is the vitamin the word
[1:28:11] itself God's word that that's their
[1:28:14] musicians come on that's where reason
[1:28:17] I'm so dogmatic
[1:28:19] we had a preacher that was real dogmatic
[1:28:21] brother Dale was real dogmatic
[1:28:24] it was a word or nothing
[1:28:26] I would call it on standing on this word
[1:28:28] no matter what anything else says if
[1:28:31] it's not with the word I don't believe
[1:28:32] it
[1:28:34] see if you want to believe it that's all
[1:28:36] right
[1:28:37] but to me it takes the word because
[1:28:39] heaven and earth will pass away but my
[1:28:41] words shall never fail therefore it
[1:28:44] takes
[1:28:45] that word let me read this real quick
[1:28:47] and this is where we'll start this
[1:28:48] afternoon we haven't really touched the
[1:28:51] token much
[1:28:53] and and I want to I want to just
[1:28:55] interject something real quick let's
[1:28:56] stand our feet there was a Doctrine many
[1:29:00] years ago that that um
[1:29:03] there was no giving of the Holy Ghost
[1:29:07] because of this quote
[1:29:09] because brother Ryan said the truth
[1:29:11] token only comes in the end time all
[1:29:13] right
[1:29:14] so there was a doctrine that there was
[1:29:16] no Holy Ghost given it's called No Holy
[1:29:18] Ghost Doctrine Bob Lambert dad knew him
[1:29:21] well Mike Canada knew him
[1:29:23] but he said you didn't get the Holy
[1:29:24] Ghost it was just an anointing you
[1:29:25] didn't get to Holy Ghost and it really
[1:29:27] fit with you know what their belief was
[1:29:29] of the Holy Spirit up here where brother
[1:29:31] Brown says you've come all this way and
[1:29:33] you ain't got to Holy Ghost yet but
[1:29:34] listen folks the token is the baptism of
[1:29:36] the Holy Ghost it was given on the damn
[1:29:37] Pentecost
[1:29:39] how dumb was that for us to believe that
[1:29:40] it was
[1:29:41] the Bible says that Pentecost the Holy
[1:29:44] Ghost fell on them
[1:29:46] you see what it made man's ideas will
[1:29:47] supersede the word every time
[1:29:50] man's ideas
[1:29:52] will supersede the word every time
[1:29:55] but it will not conquer the word
[1:29:59] because there was a group of people that
[1:30:01] didn't believe that
[1:30:02] told the White Eagle to go back to
[1:30:04] wherever he was Ohio wherever he was he
[1:30:06] called himself the White Eagle
[1:30:08] sorry he wasn't a white eagle to me
[1:30:12] the Holy Ghost came on the day of
[1:30:14] Pentecost the true now what brother
[1:30:16] random is talking about what's he
[1:30:18] talking about the fullness
[1:30:21] the Holy Ghost can only work with what
[1:30:23] word you've got right
[1:30:25] right
[1:30:27] and if you still got to follow us on
[1:30:28] Holy Ghost baptism the Holy Ghost can
[1:30:30] never anoint that
[1:30:33] he can't anoint he cannot anoint false
[1:30:35] Doctrine
[1:30:37] he cannot he hates it we'll read it this
[1:30:40] afternoon he said I hate the days of the
[1:30:41] Nicolaitans I hate the doctrine of the
[1:30:44] Nicholas yeah God hates
[1:30:48] he ate anything contrary to the word of
[1:30:50] God
[1:30:51] and we can display the token of the Holy
[1:30:53] Spirit shows that we have been accepted
[1:30:54] in Christ and that is our token that all
[1:30:57] we have need of is already purchased by
[1:31:00] him all right so there's your quote you
[1:31:02] get everything at your new birth down
[1:31:04] here
[1:31:06] you get five toes a one you get five
[1:31:09] hands on one hand you get two eyes you
[1:31:11] get nose to them right
[1:31:15] but can you drive a car
[1:31:17] you can't drive a car at three years old
[1:31:18] five years old some of you can't drive a
[1:31:20] 16.
[1:31:23] what are you laughing about
[1:31:26] but you're still a human but you got to
[1:31:28] grow
[1:31:30] same way in God we got to grow how many
[1:31:31] times we that's the whole thing is
[1:31:33] growth
[1:31:34] it's growth in God
[1:31:36] shows that we've been accepted in Christ
[1:31:38] and that is our token that all we have
[1:31:41] need of is already purchased by him all
[1:31:43] right we are identified with our token
[1:31:46] the token must be ready the blood
[1:31:48] Covenant blood is not recognized
[1:31:51] without the token
[1:31:54] what was the token the blood that was
[1:31:56] applied to the lentil of the of the of
[1:31:59] the door
[1:32:01] that the death angel would come and he'd
[1:32:03] see that blood and he'd go away
[1:32:04] you see that blood and go away but if he
[1:32:06] didn't see that blood guess what he went
[1:32:08] right under the door and took the
[1:32:10] firstborn
[1:32:12] death in the camp
[1:32:14] without the token
[1:32:16] the word assures us of the promise
[1:32:19] the token is the sign that the purchase
[1:32:22] has been made for us
[1:32:25] full obedience
[1:32:30] full obedience
[1:32:31] to the full word of God entitles us to
[1:32:34] what the token of the end time the body
[1:32:38] change
[1:32:39] the getting out of here the rapture
[1:32:43] no other way is there that you could
[1:32:45] ever be entitled to the Token until you
[1:32:47] fully obey the word of God
[1:32:50] now what somebody has put into it added
[1:32:52] to it not what that somebody's put into
[1:32:55] it or had to do it but what God said
[1:32:56] about it when he said you must be born
[1:32:58] again that don't mean jump up and down
[1:32:59] is the altar I don't mean walk back then
[1:33:01] Shake somebody's hand with a pastor that
[1:33:03] don't mean all this foolishness that
[1:33:06] we've seen done it won't mean putting
[1:33:07] your name on a church book it means
[1:33:09] death to yourself first
[1:33:11] and life to the second being
[1:33:16] it means that the blood has been applied
[1:33:18] and you're identified by the life of
[1:33:19] Jesus Christ and if he be divine we be
[1:33:22] the branches
[1:33:24] the life that's in the branch is also
[1:33:26] from the vine it'll bear the fruit when
[1:33:28] we go and pick those
[1:33:29] um
[1:33:31] grapes and all that different stuff it's
[1:33:32] going to come from a grapevine
[1:33:36] it will bear
[1:33:37] the fruit
[1:33:39] are you ready to bear fruit
[1:33:42] let's sing a song God bless you

[1:36:43] the things that we have all the

[1:36:53] comfortable
[1:36:55] to dwell in that person
[1:36:57] in your soul
