========================================

turn in your scriptures turn to Revelations 20 Revelations 20 remember the announcements now the things the Fall Festival and everybody make sure you bring your your enough clothing and things because we always sit around and bring you a chair and things you know and all we always get outside and sit around and and talk about the Lord and we just have a good time in doing that so you know come and be with us and just remember it remember brother forny will be with us that weekend preaching for us then brother pic will be with us on the 29th and brother Ernie villain NOA will be with us on November the 2nd and then the watch Night Service remember that getting all of these announcements about the books that we got from the message companion we only got so many of them so I see they're already gone but if you will there's a there's a tape inside of that too so don't don't lose it there is a a tape inside of that book you know just stuck in there so it's not in a folder or nothing and all it goes together explaining the things but if you will as quick as you can get through with it you know bring it back and we'll let somebody else do it and then that way we can try to order some more but you know we will get you a personal copy of it don't worry about that part of it but if you would read it I'll just scan through mine a little bit on the book it's really good got some beautiful pictures and some great places and things that mean a lot to you and I and so we appreciate all of these things and all and then we will try to order some more and and get it all done I just gave the brother Marcus some money when he was here said send this Min and then we'll we'll do you know but we'll try to get some more all right so just remember that and pray let's see anything else am I missing anything I generally always miss something but you know how it is Revelations 20 Heavenly Father we thank you for your love and your grace and your kindness we thank you for the hour that you have been you have allowed us to be able to live and to not only to do that but be able to see that this hour that we're living here is a very valuable time and very wonderful part in your word that everything is dependent upon this day and Lord then you've waited all of this time and you've brought it down to where we are and now Quicken to your people the part that we are to play in this of the writing of Thy word because we find ourselves therein and we just ask you to help us and guide us forgive our sins because we know we fail you and just keep us remember the sick among us and touch each one Let Your Love be made manifest we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations 20 we'll start reading in verse 11 and I saw a great white Throne now this is not going to be about the white Throne or nothing we're just I'm bringing it to the point where we can get it and I saw a great white throne and I saw and him that sat on it and whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and I saw the dead small and great stand before God and the books were open and another book was open which is The Book of Life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the Sea gave up the dead which were in them and and death in Hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell was cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death now notice death and we're talking about death being destroyed now so watch it death and hell were cast into the Lake of Fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the Lake of Fire you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word really enjoyed the the singing and now just to back up a little bit onto what we were talking about this morning and then care I thought on see I believe and have tried to teach to you the best that I could over all of these years years that that there is a word for every age and time but there's a people also to make that Word Alive there's got to be somebody you know to make it manifest all right now each age has been their time and their doings and they've brought it forth done a wonderful job before us and then to see that it's not finished up by just a waiting on certain things to happen or or something to be I've got a quote when we get over into the message a little bit in relation to something like that it's not just our ideas and our thoughts it's not to just say well we believe we're this you know no uh I believe that we must have a personal Revelation to us individually then it will be in this end time will be the only time that you would bring it down to more of a collective form because of what we were talking about this morning of the Resurrection all right and in doing that I believe that somebody is going to have to look at death and not be afraid of it and get away from the fears and the thoughts of what we've all had in our minds of death and doing this and doing that but to look at it and see that it is conquered right it is finished all right remember this morning we were trying to bring out that when the dead raises it is made manifest then that you know Paul is saying death where's you sting grave where's you Victory now he said that when they were fixing to cut his head off right and I believe he saw onto the end of things and you know by spiritual Revelation he would make that statement of saying don't worry about it cut my head off but death where's your sting grave where's your Victory all right then in doing that then he was looking at death and just saying it's my helper at this time you know we we've always taught and believed that those back there you know they speak of a personal that's true it was personal but yet Paul kept telling us that it' have to be a falling away it have to be a time it would go beyond there and he was getting it out of the people's mind that the Lord was coming right then when we thought that he was talking about it being right there just in a few minutes I finish this sermon it's going to be here you know no because he was looking by spiritual Revelation down to the end time to see what would be here and and as I said now how much more closer could you get than to be able to stand here see the dead raised and then you know that these bodies are deteriorating in and going away but yet you would look at at it and say death where's your sting grave where is your Victory and you're still dying that's right go 30 40 days right that's right but what did I say this morning when you see that dead raised and realize what's happened I believe you'll be as close to Eternity as you could ever be I remember years ago some of you probably remember it in the seal message message I made a statement that I still believe I said when that seventh seal is revealed to you of the coming of the Lord you are already redeemed you're just waiting the Redemption plan to me be fulfilled because you see it by spiritual Revelation all right we'll look at death and just say death forget it because you're not going to get us anymore it's finished I believe that and for a while there see that's why that I'm so different I guess than other people of I'm not trying to get things together in a matched form to satisfy people in their minds as to what I believe but I believe we're going to have 30 40 days with the dead here Among Us well brother Brandon will be here with us 340 days he can do a lot of preaching during that time all right but remember redemption's over why because when the dead rais redemption's finished all right then that way we can have a glorious time for that period of time I'm not looking for for something to take place to to try to bring us to Revelation right I believe we have the Revelation by way of the profit of what we have need of but I believe we must walk into that amen and to be able then to be happy in what's going on and see then death will one day be destroyed because what was our point this morning I didn't get to the message part because I was dealt with the resurrection so much but see death is unbelief what caused the first physical death in the garden was a spiritual death in an individual that's right right right to disbelieve God and what was the thing brother brownon said she disbelieved Hebrews 138 not that there was not a God she believed in that right but that he wouldn't keep his word all right we were talking the other day my wife and I about you know the scripture that says people will say you know uh he delayeth his coming Etc but the script there says that that is the very people that says that is the time that that will take place that he won't be delaying his coming so you look around the world today and see what they're doing you know everybody's just going along rolling with a tide I guess you call it but somebody's going to wake up one day and say this is it that's right amen that's right right but it'll only be now when it's revealed that's right it's not a quote as I saying there the other day the brother you know what I told about he he'd said he heard brother Bram say it and he got up I take every spirit in here and under my control I thought well good quote I didn't believe it was made manifest but I believe it wasn't brother Bram amen that's right I believe every Spirit was under his control but you see we can make statements because he made a statement that's right we can make statements because the Bible says it you know the Bible says we're everyone healed right amen right already we can prove that by the prophet we can read how that that it's supposed to be something per personal to us but we can also read if it's not made manifest then it's not a revelation I want you to watch that in the message today but just think about it he that believeth not is condemned already you realize then if sin is unbelief then that's why we need to be against is unbelief and if you'll watch it then you'll see why that I've been as I have for all of these years because of being able to see that that I haven't been one that just went along hophazardly preaching and each service we preach against women and their dress and hire and their clothes the men and the world and the the doings you know we've tried to preach the message that's right amen because I believe the Bible and what it says that life and immortality is brought to light by the gospel amen right don't youen all right now but here's a man stand up and say those things Paul said those things change them moment twinkle you know what he was going to the Grave there where you staying gra where going to get his head cut off but yet it was something positive to him that's right see it's got to be positive to you and I that's right I always quote Peter you know I was on the mountain he said with the Lord we said I have a more sure word of Prophecy why cuz he had a new birth all right Luther nobody no telling how many times he preached on a j to live by faith but one day it became a revelation see one day what we've talked about will become a revelation and if you get tired if you're in me talk about it then I know for certain you don't have the Revelation and you should too all right right because I believe and we'll try to prove always have that this message that you and I have has within it now I said it the best way I know to say it the revelation of each age that's ever been the times the things but he got a revelation to you and I that's right something personal to you and I and I believe that if you get tired of hearing me say that I'm sorry you come back you'll hear me say it more times because that's what I believe I've always have all right but now talking about what is death and knowing that death is unbelief the original sin in the garden was Eve's unbelief not in God brother Rand says right but in his word yeah all right now that was death am and see we don't have to go out and do a whole lot of wrong things to be dead while we're living and I tried to explain it this morning that there's two Avenues point there to deal with one is if we haven't had to word then we don't know the word that's right right right but if we've heard the word then we're responsible all right and I I Believe by being the way that I've been I don't think there will be an excuse for you to say we didn't hear the message I'm as honest as I can be about that because it's what I've always tried to do is to make the message available to my wife my children the church to you to where you would have a choice that's right you don't have to go around the country and try to find What doctrine to follow you know I I've tried to be that way because yeah I believe that's what it is I believe to take this message as the people has and turn it the way it's been done is the original death I spent so much time on Resurrection this morning I didn't get on to what I wanted to talk about death see to take this message and disbelieve it once it's made known is the original sin that was in the garden amen that's why this messenger knew what death was what do you think about a man bring a message like he did and realize the people were not getting it right amen how do you think it made him feel in his heart to want the people to see Jesus Christ amen in the correct order but see death has always followed sin all right the scripture speaks of sin and death death always follows sin because sin was the original death Eve was just as dead when she disbelieved God's word am as she was the day she physically died amen that's right the physical death was just a manifestation you know a uh climax bringing it into being she was already dead see that's the way the world is today the world is dead because of the unbelief of God's word it don't take a whole lot of sentence you know to disbelief all you got to do is just say well I don't know whether he meant that I don't know whether that means that that is death that's right I'm not worried about physical dying why would you worry about physical dying that's right well I don't want to leave the world and my family and that's normal that's a normal part that's human beings right that's filio right but a goo love is to say I stay here for my family if I can help them if not Lord I'd like to go on to be with you and then you know we're not the kind to run out and get in front of a train we don't do stuff like that and want to hurry it up but why would you want to hold your loved ones here when they would be passing into a wonderful situation now I'd like to all go together right I mean that's what I'm hoping about a bride all right then we'll all go together but see to disbelieve God's word brought natural death into being right now watch what I'm getting at now this morning to try to get that clear see the eagle was the one that called it death all right now I believe the prophet saw death in its highest form or whatever you want to call it you know right I don't believe he was talking about just physically dying you know that's a normal part that's a natural thing it will take place I believe he was talking about the one thing that God cannot get over okay and what is the one one thing that God cannot get over our unbelief right cuz he can't make you be saved cuz that would bypass his being god well now I believe Paul he made no he didn't we see we think can there's your unbelief but see Eve was dead as the Bible speaks about a woman that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth Eve was dead in the worst death of all and lived I don't really know how long she did live 100 years or whatever but it finally took the natural death all right but by the new birth you and I can come to a place to where that that unbelief can be destroyed that's right right CU that's that's what I want to talk about death is destroyed to the Born Again believer death is destroyed right already now it's just not applied in the physical part right that's right all right see then the door of death cannot hinder a born again believer right because it's already settled I can't die right right I can only be helped to cross from natural into the arms of the Lord but I believe somebody is going to stand here and be as we were talking about this morning stand here and I believe she will call the Dead from the ground all right because she's going to be the final voice to the final age and she will call the dead out of the ground one day but it's not because we all get together and decide we're going to do it on a certain day because I'm just as honest as can be we could announce we're going to have it next Sunday and some of you would come up and say I've got something to do next Sunday I won't be able to be here you said but we're talking about the dad being raised you know I mean but I can't be here you going have to make it on another date cuz I'm important yeah about as important as a handful full of dust amen all right but is that true you make it all come to my time and my doings and I I'll agree with you but so I believe somebody is going to stand and look death in the face that's right and then the dead will raise see once you look it in the face and realize that it's finished all right so then if death is unbelief in God's word that's not in God right you follow me yes Eve wouldn't in this she didn't believe you know she believed in God she could prove it was a God right but she doubted his word right all right so if it's unbelief in God's word that kills us would it not simply be as simple as we could talk that the revealed word is what's going to destroy death if the doubting of the word is death what is the opposite you see why we need to hear the message you see why it's so important to study the message for you to study the message not to me to study the message to preach to you that's part of it but it's for you it's not the preacher that's going to make the change it's going to be you as an individual amen all right someone then will have to stand one day and look at death as Peter said and say leave me alone y that's right but it'll be by the revealed word amen amen now there's where we get to meddling if we any thought whatsoever to the message you know me the message is a Bible okay all the Bible and the message is one and we're not into that silliness what he said the White Horse right no we're in the the truth of the message amen all right so then if we could ever come to the place that that can be revealed to us that's right the word of God ex all right now here's my point okay why do we need Daniel 70 weeks you know why do we need it that's even the Israel why do we need to Feast to the trumpets you know you remember that one why them trumpets just to Israel why do we need the seals to be revealed brother why do we need marriage and divorce to be preached why do we need one God to be preached yeah brother Dale just no intellect well I've been that for 50 years GL on now and you know what that ain't changed me or made me any different I'm still the same person because I know one thing for certain there's one scripture that I firmly believe you know what that scripture is all things you I'm paraphrasing it all things you get you received it that's right that's paraphrasing it but that's the scripture right but yet see we're called an intellectual church or word word word word word church well what are you called I don't believe we need that M I know I'm medling see brother R said on Daniel 70 weeks if you don't understand the Daniel 70 weeks you can't understand the seals the plagues the vows the trumpet now I didn't say that he's the one that said it so if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you don't understand the sales that's right amen now I'm sorry that I found that you know I'm sorry that I found that in the message but my point is what is unbelief right that's right if unbelief is death then why would we be so worried about the message I don't want to get into deep things I might get messed up no honey you already messed up we was born messed up right don't worry about getting confused you already are right yeah but that's just old intellect well I asked a question if Einstein said something or if I said it you know would it be value of who was saying it or would it be what was say it does it mean that it would be truer because Einstein said it I get to talking to Aon back there you get into them uh unknown numbers and imaginary numbers and all that stuff that goes with all of that you know that cause them bombs to blow up I just tell them say forget it that's too much Beyond me I know how to turn a wall switch on and I know that that's what they done and they finally wound up one day and throwed the switch and the bomb went off you know took a long time to get all them things together to make make it work but it still was out way it was just from negative to positive and you ever touch the two together you got a problem unless it's word and spirit then you got a wonderful thing all right but how would it be that we could destroy death is for God to reveal the word to us amen right but I just don't have time for them things well where you at you know 24 hours on your clock is 24 hours on my clock right you know what I mean by that I don't have time for it right brother Mo preached statue of a perfect man 68 messages I thanks right now and the brother said I ain't got time to listen to 68 messages brother Mo made a good point he said you listen to a lot of other things you see we don't want to call those things unbelief well what is unbelief unbelief is a lack of Revelation right is that simple enough to say it right see to destroy spiritual death and spiritual death is the perverting of God's word are you listening yes spiritual death is the perverting of God's word are making the word say what we think it should say and we had the Daniel 70 weeks doings and wait and I had presented it and we presented two drawings that were authentic drawings of brother brandham and I made the statement I said well if you're going to differ with me at least please do it openly you know don't go around behind my back and talk to everybody tell me sitting here this one brother Saidi want you to know I don't agree with you I said appreciate that so he had the opportunity the next service or it was and he uh he showed why he didn't believe what we were talking about and he made his own drawing yeah he didn't take brother R's drawing to show what was right he made his own drawing until all the ministers said wait a minute brother that's not what brother Ram draw but you see right he made his point you say is that going to take him to the Grave probably will you going take him to hell not necessarily I didn't say that I didn't make that statement I made the statement that it'd probably take him to the Grave cuz I know one thing for certain the people that are standing there at that change is going to be word born people right all right now I may not be able to stand there but at least let me point at it until the day comes because see to destroy spiritual death why did it take for God to send a prophet the Bible always taught one God and we we always believe to have yes why did God after to send the prophet right I thought it was the the way he said it was that we had got so scrupled up until God had to send a prophet have you ever noticed the connection me see if I can get that I'm going to quit writing notes one of these days I don't never use them uh could you pull up Malachi 4 I'll talk a minute while I'll give you a minute to run it up pull up Malachi 4 verse 5 and six have you ever really looked at that scripture as in relationship to this day and to what would take place in this day I mean really just analyzed it and thought on it to see then why God would have to send a prophet and look what it says behold I will send you elij Elijah the prophet the before the coming the great and Dreadful day of the Lord watch what it say and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the Heart of the children to their fathers and then we stop there we don't read the rest of it lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse you realize if God had not sent the Adam Bomb was already in the process of being developed all right Einstein was not the first one working on atoms and splittings and doings there were multiple multiple people behind him that once he brought it all he done was took these and put it together and done what they were all aiming at and see church here comes a prophet and said if he didn't come and if he didn't turn the hearts of the children to the fathers and the fathers to the children Etc whatever fathers to the children children to the fathers and he Smite the Earth with a curse what was that curse toal Annihilation had God not kept his word and sent brother random with a message when the atom bombs went off it would have annihilated the whole thing right said if not then he Des Smite the Earth with a curse now back to the bodily part of of us do you realize what would have happened if you annihilated the world you smoke the Earth with a curse uh our bodies come out of there and they would have went with it so there would have been no bodily Redemption right had God not sent a prophet are you listening it would have been annihilated but God kept his word amen all right even though we had all of doubt and frustration but what did it take to bring that it took a man to come that God could speak to and to get rid of his unbelief now is that right brother D we don't believe brother randam ever had any unbelief then you you just you are in Mass confusion because he was the one that said himself that I used to believe Jesus loved me and God hated me and said I till I found out they were the selfs sameed person and he Tau the white horse rider was the Antichrist I mean was the Holy Spirit until the seals broke and he saw it was the Antichrist so that solves a problem but that don't solve the problem in people's mind they just cut you off say forget it he don't understand okay I understand one thing that it takes the revealed word and without the prophet you and I would not have the revealed word I don't care how sanctimonious and wonderful F you think you are and how great revelated you think you are or were the world wasn't waiting on you or me that's right the world was waiting on God to send a prophet that he promised and what would he be doing then now now listen we all used to think that hell was eternal didn't we right right but you know a Prophet come along and he just made a few statements and you know what we don't believe that anymore now do you know what went out of you death well you mean it's death for me to believe in a in Eternal yeah it's death for you to believe anything contrary to the word of me either one that's death we all believe that it was God in three persons Blessed Trinity right how many years did it take a prophet to preach before he could even bring out certain things and he'd say I was waiting on this things or that you know we all believe that we're going to get a new body as we were talking about this morning the prophet says no that's not true we see then why is a big portion of the message still believe in that Doctrine when when the the prophet has brought that out and emphatically stated that do you understand what I'm talking about yes unbelief is anything that is not right in God's word you know about God's word or what we think about it nothing wrong with the word it's what we think about it the word never taught a trinity the word never taught hell as Eternal the word never taught many gods it was never written in there right amen but yet we brought it there and you know what that was death well run down you're just trying to get everybody to believe what you believe okay I'll I I'll go along with you I wish you would believe what I believe that don't exalt me it's just honest truth well you think you're the only one's got it now there's a problem cuz I ain't never done that I've always taught you somewhere around the world is the ministers that are on the word of God right now but I believe that there's a place in there let me get it right now I hope I can get it to the right order brother Brandon preached a message one time and if you listen at it if you go in One Direction you're going to blow your mind he preached a message many time called doors indoors y now if you take that message wrong you have drastically got a problem because he brings doors IND doors he brings you by the new birth in each message as to come inside the soul you know Jesus Christ to come to live he's not talking about justification he's not talking about sanctification he's talking about the new birth the person of Jesus Christ coming and living in our soul now I'm trying to illustrate unbelief and yet he brings it to a place that you're born believer you have eternal life but he says you got doors that are closed right one of them becs the door of my pride but I will challenge you to listen to any of those messages and come out of it where he brings the wrong thing in there they can't be in the doors inside the door one of them that you need to open up and get rid of your adultery or get rid of you lying and you're stealing and you committing this and that and the other bring the message to me if you can find it okay no you'll find him talking about your pride the little things in your life but Brother D when I got born again I I all the evil went out of me okay but why did Peter say that we need to get rid of our Temperance I don't have no temper bless God I got righteous indignation it gets stirred up sometimes and like brother told two brothers the ministers meeting one time and they fussing with each other he said y'all both saying that you're not got a temper that that's the way I act when I get mad is the way y'all been acting but you see once you're born again don't mean you got everything that's right so if we have a problem with a little temper we need to work on that no not an outlandish one you know we're not talking about junk right that's right Pride different things of Our Lives you know what that's killing us that's right well let's God then I'll take care of that I just won't have no more Pride well you're kind of like the story of the tiger that you wet him down real good try to wash off the spots and what happens you just make it shinier so it don't work what is sin unbelief all right to take and preach the message and preach it in certain ways can be just as deadly as preaching the Trinity amen I said in certain ways I didn't say the message was wrong that's right I said is according our preaching of it that's right if you think all the message is is dress and hir and clothes then look what the beautiful part that you've missed of the rest of the understanding and the ability to do away with death I asked brother Mo dur in 1971 when he preached the statue of perfect man finished at about 72 I said okay all I want to know is one thing how do we get those virtues you proved that we not only need them but we got to have them right now I W know how to get rid of them I've been as honest as I can be to talk about somewhere about 1980 the Lord spoke to me about that and he began to show me that don't the only way to get those virtues was for the word being revealed and it statement to me was if you'll have patience with the people it'll prove you got patience is that hard to understand is that do you need a great big light bub he was simply telling me I didn't have patience right and the only way that I'd get it was to have patience with the people and it would all grow together all right doors indoors not horrible sinful things but little things that are there that shouldn't be right left there because of the old adamic nature yeah but not murder adulterous and all of that no just little things that we need to get rid of how do we get rid of it see that's why I love it when the Lord tells you and tells you not only that but tells you the way of it see you can be preaching on Daniel 70 weeks and see people get brother Rand preached Daniel 70 weeks and people got healed and got saved you know what brother random preached on Statue of perfect man years later people got saved people got healed you know that brother Randon preached on the seals and people were saved and people were healed but you say well but we need to stay on the simple things to try to get people saved uhuh we need to preach the word I never thought it was simple things and got people saved I understand that I know that I understand but I understand one thing the opening of the word brother brandom what is the new birth Christ Min of God reveal what is the new birth brother brandom it is said it's the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you right right so then he could be preaching any message souls in prison Feast of the trumpets it seems so confusing to the Ministers of this message but yet he said was thus sayith the Lord you know what people weeping their way to the altar you never save nobody telling them how dirty they are now you may think so but just let it go nobody will ever be saved you telling them how wrong they are that's right why don't you tell them about the love of Jesus Christ why don't you tell them about the one who died on the cross like I've always told you we standing out in the yard one day at my mother-in-laws this lady was standing there with this n I mean he just in up center of the world he got his lawnmower out on Sunday wasn't Christ she said he going to die and go to hell cutting chist on Sunday I thought well that's where we all used to be I didn't condemn her and scream and holler at her I thought that's where we all used to be we all used to be believe there was certain things we done or didn't do is why God saved us I don't care what you say you said no brother de you're right wrong well I'm going to call you a li so we'll solve that cuz we're all human we had some little something right right but see God's goodness the Bible said is what leadeth us to repentance that's right tell them about Jesus Christ and what he done cuz you don't you tell him about it I told you this what cuz I saw it before I ever even come out of organized religion I watch people come out of organized religion because the prophet said it and I watched him a year later going back some of them didn't make it a year you remember some you dealt with some of you were around at the time I made the statement then that I still make now the revelation of Jesus Jesus Christ can save a soul but to tell them organized religion is wrong won't save a soul it's a truth and needs to be done all that's well and good these that know that I talked to them about the message I never talked to them about how bad they were and they needed to be saved I never talked to them how bad organized religion was and they need to get out of it I talked to them about Jesus Christ cuz that's what's going to save all of us are you listening then what's going to take away our unbelief the revealing of God's word right so what's going to destroy death y right the revealing of God's word amen what do ises 1 John 5 and3 said the victory that overcometh the world is what what is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith even our faith so if you want a victory get to Faith right do you understand my point if life and immortality is brought to light second Timothy 1:10 through the gospel then why not preach the gospel right now here is where we're at right not too long ago I heard about a minister saying something and his point was like this we've we know the one God we know know the water baptism we know this and we know that you know what do we need what do we need if we know these things but do we really know those things why do you why does the preachers get upset when you speak about something that they say they already know well I know about the seals well then you just make a few little statements my Point Church is one thing there is nothing can destroy death but the revealed word of God that's right amen there's nothing can do away with sin but the opening of God's word no matter what we think it could be it can't be but just a revealing of God's word but why is the people this message so against the revealing of God's word I've never understood that one I'm sorry we used to years ago people would come and tell brother molon we'd be talking about somebody and they'd say oh he's off the word brother Mo say when you get a chance we going and see him we go listen you know what we found out that the ones they talking about know more about the revealed word you know ones that they were talking about know more about the reveal word than the ones that was doing the talking all right see the first death is the death of the Soul right now we're going to flip it now watch and then the next death is the death of the body now we made this statement when we was an organized religion the Baptist was good at it they said if you're born again you die once you remember that one lot of you moving your head a little CU you remember it but said if you're a sinner you die twice y Born Again believer can only die one time first die to itself and be born again the next part of it is he may die physically of a natural death right but to a sinner one who's never saved he dies physically and you know what he's going to die in the second death what is the second death brother brandham the death of the Soul the second death is the death of the Soul that's why I read what I did in Revelation you realize that if the scriptures right there that it's not just talking about little things but it says death and hell right are both cast into the Lake of Fire so then there's going to be a place somewhere that death will be totally annihilated all right now then it reads that what whose names were not written and all they're going to be cast into the Lake of Fire so I got the quotes here if you'd like to have them but what is the second death is the death of the Soul it's not physically dying come on death and hell is cast into the Lake of Fire you know the Bible calls the Lake of Fire the second death which is the second death is said you know that's not going to be just people dying that's going to be Souls yes and demons and Devils CU you know that the devil is cast into the Lake of Fire right the Lake of Fire is a total annihilation of all things not just dying it means to do away with demons to do away with everything ain't going to be no devil in heaven he ain't going to get a second change that's right so when the Lake of Fire is finished all death in any form that you can use the word will be done away but to you and I he that has part in the first resurrection over which the second death has no part is that scripture see the first resurrection is the bride of Christ eternal life there's no death in that death is already annihilated for the soul but somebody is going to have to walk up to Natural death and say you are defeated amen amen now you realize what that's going to be it's going to be like David when he walked out that day and he looked upon that hill and he said W he's big right big old thing he said he's bigger than the barer he's bigger than the lion and said besides that he's smart cuz he's a human being what am I going to do right see that's what it looks like to you and I and that's the reason I bring it out the way I do you see David looked at that Giant and he said I don't care how big you are he had a positive attitude and he had a personal revelation now what was David's personal revelation he had been anointed to be king right by a prophet right right he wasn't afraid of all of it the story is told that he put five stones in there brother around use it f a and 54 Ministry and thing but you know according to the story they say Goliath had about four more Brothers well he probably figured if I get him I'll have to get the other four so he put Rock in there for each one of them he wouldn't scared why Lord y if you've anointed me to be king how can that man stand in my way amen amen right now if what you said is right I'm going to be king I may die the day after right but I'm going to sit on that Throne I thought that we believed that we had been told by receiving the new birth that we were the Christ the little Messiah which would be greater having the anointing of Nathan I believe it was was it which one to David are having the inner being of the Holy Spirit to live in our lives and then we afraid of dying Brother D why can you preach so positive and go on the internet to be worldwide and say you see me wrong come and tell me two motives one is if I'm wrong and you come show me I'm going to get help but if I'm right you think I'm afraid of anything no there's no enemy can defeat the Bride of Jesus Christ because to her death is destroyed not going to be right the day you got that new birth brother Marlo that ended death now watch the body may have to go by the grave I don't do it cuz you see the day he gave you the new birth he claimed that body am that you're living in yes sir amen right they claimed on it sure if David could believe the impossible they could not keep him for being King why can't we believe am the impossibility of all things that we can walk off of this Earth one day death is destroyed I had the time to go on over in Revelation I said vast false prophet devil everything is cast into the Lake of Fire And even death itself is cast into the Lake of Fire according to the scripture and you know what that means they can't be no eternal hell right right because death and hell is going to be annihilated that's right right anything's annihilated is not Eternal is that simple amen but death itself no matter what category you want to put it unbelief this that or the other when day it'll be totally annihilated amen but right here before that happens some over a thousand years later from now even if it was right now because you got the Millennium and then you got the white Throne right somebody's going to stand right here and say it's finished well now would you agree that death is annihilated for the Soul by the new birth would you agree with that would you agree that by being born again death has already been destroyed in the inner being all right but see the hard part is is to believe that death in the physical is destroyed that's right to you and I right there is where our unbelief is killing us well you do brother I don't have no unbelief I believe everything brother Ram said well I remember a group of people telling brother brandham said we speak only where the Bible speaks MH and we don't speak where it don't speak he said I doubt that he said and where are you said the Bible is still speaking but said you're in the byone days yeah well are we that type of people you know what made those people that was a human reasoning re Revelation did you follow human reasoning Revelation there's a lot of difference between a human reasoning Revelation then the Holy Ghost fill Revelation Holy Ghost fill Revelation you don't have to worry about it you can walk on it amen right but his brother would be had to point you can get him in with a hot dog you can get him out with the hamburger good point wasn't it today I'm two Soul tomorrow I'm seven Thunder next day I'll be this one I'll be that one what about it has death been destroyed to you now I had the scriptures and the things but just remember I may not see it in the bases that I need to see it I may not have the comprehension of all that I need to comprehend but there was a time I didn't have this comprehension will you go along with thaten was there a time that you didn't have the comprehension of you being the people that would annihilate death amen right well let me hold on to this until you know and then let me be like Paul I don't see everything put under him I know we're still dying but said I see Jesus at least let me see Jesus amen happy about it I'm not running all over the world trying to find ever doctrinal issues and people and doings I generally hear enough without even trying to listen to a lot of people but the ones that I do talk about I did hear and I relate you know I back away from talking about doctrinal things that I haven't heard somebody say I try to do that but I've come to find out a little bit of what death is now don't do us no good to start saying I'm not going to get no older I'm not going to get no older I'm going to be positive I'm going to be positive I'm not going to get no older you just go ahead and do all you want to you're going to get older right that's just part of the story but to say and let's see if you can follow this and more quick the older I get the closer I get to Eternity right amen so if it requires problems in life I don't glory in my problems I just know they're going to come I know the older you get the more trouble you got if you don't know that you're just not old enough yet but I don't have to glory in that I going to look at that and say hey it's what I tell the doctor I said Doctor I'm 74 years old what do you think I'm supposed to be according to your books I'm not supposed to be able to ride a tractor 68 hours a day day build your stands or run around work I'm supposed to be getting old and slowing down my wife has finally figured out one thing about me says leave him alone she'll beg me every day since my leg's been hurting just sit down just sit down on the couch and lay down and rest I do I go to sleep and I have problems I get up and I don't feel no different I feel worse right so that ain't happen I tried it I finally got where sometime now I I sleep P 7 o00 you but see I'm just not going to give up cuz you give up then you're going to die you go talk to people that retire when you retire retire especially about if you retire at 60 you might be able to make pretty good A while you retire 70 you already on the downhill drag but that don't mean I have to get up every day saying well I'm 70 I guess I'm going to act like you I get up saying Lord I thank you I got one more day I got one more time let me have a good day Lord let me get out and go do something instead of being lazy and they were really like lazy when I was 40 I sure don't like lazy when I'm 70 cuz you quit using them bones and things you are downhill folks you younger people don't know anything about it I'm never cared about going down to a gym and working out cuz I don't think you have do that you you his old brother Sher used to brother Sher brother I think of a minute he said get you a hole and put out a garden right that's right that's right get you a hole and put out a garden you don't have to go down and work out but it's just good if it takes it if it helps you go do it CU you know what ain't going to be long you go slow down that's just human but see I think the other way every day older I get is a day younger cuz I'm closer to Eternity I think that you've been with me all these years you know that it's true on one thing you call me up how are you doing I'm doing wonderful I got a positive attitude why I talk about my hurens and problem s does it help any no let's go on and forget it let's stand think on these things death even itself you don't get nothing out of the message get this death itself the Bible says will go into the Lake of Fire and be destroyed the devil the false prophet all of those things are going to be destroyed what do you think about it we come to the communion time that we say well and it would be nice to be taken to communion and see the Dead Walk Among Us amen right that would be wonderful that's the last thing he done and then when he left but think on these things this means a lot to me for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said
