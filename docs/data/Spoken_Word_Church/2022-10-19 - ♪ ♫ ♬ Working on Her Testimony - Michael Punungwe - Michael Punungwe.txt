foreign listen closely to the broken mother's heart as she talked about her daughter gone astray feeling so ashamed she wants to take the blame and she wonders where she made her mistake but the preacher said this prodigal knows the way to Calvary and the word says that she won't run for long so let's keep believing in God's higher ways and know that till she's back where she belongs she's working on her testimony though the way she chose is lonely know that there's a victory down the road someday she'll share her story and help somebody else to make it home so don't worry she's working on her testimony [Music] This Could Be Your Story You're praying Lord how long what will it take for my child to be saved you know God has a plan you've placed it in his hands but it's hard to leave it there and walk away there's a promise to your children the same one he's given you that together you will spend eternity no failure is final when God extends his grace but until then just speak and with all your heart believed they're working on their testimony though the way they chose is lonely know that there's a victory down the road someday they'll share their story and help somebody else to make it home so don't worry they're working on their testimony though the way they chose is lonely know that there's a victory down the road someday they'll share their story and help somebody else to make it home so don't worry they're working on their testimonies [Music] all right
