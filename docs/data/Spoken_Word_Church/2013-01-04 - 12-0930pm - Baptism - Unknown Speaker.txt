bless our brother as he as he goes into the water and comes out a new man W he performs ceremony amen all right now I know we uh we like to read the scripture every time but it always to me it brings more and more back to what uh to what this is all about it's not just that we're going to uh bury our brother and baptism and welcome him into the family but we're going to to help him amen help him get a fresh Good Start help him to get like brother was talking today about receiving the Holy Ghost you you take all these promises and you you make those you put those promises in the Bible and once you do you say God you promised right here right so you promis if I would be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that you'd give me the Holy Ghost there's not a promise out of that okay the promise is if youd be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ I'll give you the Holy Ghost but we also know that we walk in newness of life that's what we always try to say is when when when we put the old man down um there's a lot of dead devils in this water we hope we pray and we've seen it before lot of dead Devils standing in here Le and them have to leave the pool on all the time to get all get all them demons out of there but now this is a symbol but then when you come up you got to walk in uness of Life the water's not going to wash your sins away but believing that you'll do what God Said Glory believing in what God Said that's what'll do away with your sin right not just being wet and coming back up you walk in newness of life so let's read the scripture here in Romans chapter 6 and what a privilege we have today to take our brother to the water there's always been a privilege to to do this this part what shall we say then shall we continue in sin this is Romans 6 verse1 shall we continue in sin that God May abound that Grace May abound Paul said God for forbid how shall we that are dead to sin live any longer therein what in sin know ye not that so many of us as we baptized into Jesus Christ we're baptized into his death death burial Resurrection therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in newness of life for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also in the likeness be also in the likeness of his resurrection knowing this that our old man that's what we put in this water the old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed brother not just divorced not just hung up in a closet the Bible says destroyed that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead is free from sin can't can't convict a dead man he's dead right he can't do those things anymore now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we shall also live with him knowing that Christ being raised from the dead dieth no more death has no more dominion over him that's the one scripture we need to hang on to right there death has no more dominion what what is Dominion overseer power there's no more power over us for in that he died he died under sin once but in that he liveth he liveth under God likewise reckon you also yourselves to be dead indeed into sin but Alive With God through Jesus Christ Our Lord let not sin therefore reign in your mortal body that you should obey it and the lust thereof neither yield ye your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourself unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteousness unto God brother [Music] dick I am Bound for the pr I am for the [Music] pro I am for the to fulfill the Great Commission that Jesus said going to all the world baptizing in the name of the father and of the son and of the Holy Ghost I now baptize my brother brother William TBO Timo Timo in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah anybody else brother William his mother and father from what I understand his mother and father has go to message Church overseas and uh he's moved over here and he lives in foretta so he want us to baptize him in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so the water's now warm enough so you can get in he looked at me when he got in the water and I said it's not summertime now but it feels fine now anybody else no one else Brother Anderson how about dismissing us in a word [Applause] prayer to
