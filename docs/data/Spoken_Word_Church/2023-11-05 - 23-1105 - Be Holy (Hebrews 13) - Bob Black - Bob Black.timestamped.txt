[0:02] God bless you Saints it's good to be in
[0:03] the house of the Lord this
[0:10] morning we'll just continue on our
[0:12] little study in Hebrews 13 we almost
[0:15] almost made it to the end but there's
[0:16] still some weighty scriptures there at
[0:18] the in that in that chapter that we um
[0:21] I'm looking forward to
[0:23] covering let's just bow our heads before
[0:25] we before we get into the study Lord
[0:26] we're so grateful to be able to gather
[0:28] together around your word I pray Lord
[0:29] that your bless today Lord as we come
[0:31] with expecting hearts Lord Jesus to
[0:33] receive from you granted Lord that
[0:34] you'll guide us through this study of
[0:36] your word Lord and pray Lord that you'll
[0:37] just be with brother Wade as he's
[0:38] preparing Lord and help our hearts today
[0:41] we pray in your name
[0:43] amen
[0:45] now as we get through um Hebrews 13
[0:49] about verses four and five and and so on
[0:53] um Paul's kind of moving into uh where
[0:55] he's just kind of he all through that
[0:58] that last chapter he's just kind of
[0:59] hitting on this thing and then this
[1:01] thing and just kind of moving through
[1:03] pretty rapidly different little topics
[1:06] but one thing he's talking about in
[1:07] verses five and six and and so forth is
[1:10] is to the concept of being holy and so I
[1:13] just want to read a few scriptures from
[1:14] Leviticus and 1 Peter where um God is
[1:18] telling us in Leviticus he said in n in
[1:20] chapter
[1:21] 19 that ye shall be holy for I the Lord
[1:25] your God am Holy so I I believe as we
[1:28] meditate on these scriptures God is God
[1:30] is expressing to us that he wants us to
[1:32] to not just just uh come to church and
[1:35] stay as we are but he's going to change
[1:36] us and to to to be like him and so uh I
[1:40] I thank God that he set it up that way
[1:42] that we he can take us from being
[1:43] unclean and clean us up so that our life
[1:46] is changed in Leviticus chapter 20 he
[1:49] said sanctify yourselves therefore and
[1:51] be ye holy for I am the Lord your God
[1:55] and in First Peter he said but uh
[1:58] Peter's telling us but as he which hath
[1:59] called you as holy so be holy in all
[2:03] manner of conversation because it is
[2:06] written be holy for I am Holy so God
[2:10] don't want us to have unclean
[2:12] conversation unclean lives he wants to
[2:14] clean us up so that we can live right
[2:17] and do right and be an example to others
[2:18] so that when people see our lives they
[2:20] say well there's a real true Christian
[2:22] so let's start meditating on Hebrews 13
[2:25] in verse one it says let Brotherly Love
[2:27] continue and we've already kind of
[2:29] studied on that a little bit in verse
[2:32] two be not forgetful to entertain
[2:33] strangers for thereby some have
[2:35] entertained angels
[2:37] unawares and verse three remember them
[2:40] that are in bonds as bound with them and
[2:43] them which suffer adversity as being
[2:45] yourselves also in the body and verse
[2:48] four where we start getting into
[2:50] Holiness marriage is Honorable in all
[2:52] and the bed undefiled but wh mongers and
[2:54] adulterers God will judge now you think
[2:57] about how in the in the beginning that
[2:58] God set up this this pattern of of a man
[3:01] and a woman that that God set up this
[3:03] pattern where you he doesn't want you to
[3:05] go through life alone that he set it up
[3:07] so that you'd have somebody to go
[3:08] through life with that there's nothing
[3:10] wrong with that situation that scenario
[3:13] but there is something wrong when God
[3:15] when the Devil comes and perverts that
[3:17] situation and and makes somebody live an
[3:19] unclean life so God has called us to
[3:21] live a holy life he's he's put
[3:23] parameters around the way that we we're
[3:25] supposed to be living and conducting
[3:26] ourselves so that you know there's
[3:28] things that you can do when you're
[3:29] married that you can't do when you're
[3:31] not married because listen God wants to
[3:33] live he wants us to live at a holy
[3:36] separated set aart life where we're
[3:39] living in a way that we really
[3:41] demonstrate what a what a Christian is
[3:43] supposed to look like now uh in
[3:45] Galatians chapter chapter 5 Paul said
[3:48] now the works of the flesh are manifest
[3:51] which are these adultery fornication
[3:54] uncleanness lasciviousness and in 1
[3:57] Corinthians chapter 6 Paul's telling us
[3:59] know ye not that the unrighteous shall
[4:02] not inherit the kingdom of God be not
[4:04] deceived neither fornicators nor
[4:06] idolators nor adulterers nor feminite
[4:09] nor abusers of themselves with mankind
[4:12] nor thieves nor Covetous and we'll look
[4:14] at covetousness in a second because
[4:16] Paul's getting to that in the next in
[4:17] the next verse nor drunkards nor
[4:20] revilers nor extortioners shall inherit
[4:24] the kingdom of God now look at the class
[4:26] he's putting that in if you're living an
[4:27] unclean life where you're doing things
[4:30] that you know you shouldn't be doing
[4:31] that are contrary to the word of God uh
[4:33] living outside the bounds that God has
[4:35] put for us then you you've got a promise
[4:38] here in the Bible that the kingdom of
[4:40] God is not for you but then he says and
[4:43] such were some of you but you are washed
[4:46] you've been cleaned up made holy you are
[4:48] Sanctified if if God has got a hold of
[4:51] your life if God has grabbed a hold of
[4:53] if you've yielded yourself to the word
[4:55] but you are justified in the name of the
[4:58] Lord Jesus and by the spirit of God of
[5:02] our God and of course you know use word
[5:03] to study out justification Justified
[5:05] means you look at you and say well what
[5:07] what you can't find anything wrong
[5:08] Justified means you're you've been made
[5:10] just because you put your trust in what
[5:12] Jesus Christ has done for you and he's
[5:14] cleaned you
[5:17] up now brother R said in the pergamum
[5:19] church age he said so balam got Israel
[5:21] to commit fornication do you know that
[5:23] physical fornication is the very same
[5:25] spirit that lies in organized religion I
[5:28] said that the spirit of fornication the
[5:29] spirit of organization and all
[5:31] fornicators will have their place in the
[5:34] Lake of Fire now you see what we're
[5:37] doing this morning as we're study we're
[5:38] going through verse by verse it's not
[5:40] anything that I picked out to Target
[5:42] anything but the word is still a
[5:44] discerner of the thoughts and intents of
[5:46] it it deser It Go Goes Forth and it'll
[5:48] it'll convict where somebody needs to be
[5:51] convict and you see it's not me this is
[5:53] really really the technical term for
[5:55] this is ex aesus where you go through
[5:57] verse by verse and you let the script RT
[5:59] explain itself and the word will convict
[6:02] a heart so maybe this morning there's
[6:04] somebody that needs to sit in here this
[6:05] morning that ain't quite living right
[6:07] and it's up to you who who that might be
[6:09] but the word will go forth and and it'll
[6:11] convict and you begin to the word if
[6:14] you'll yield yourself to it the word
[6:15] will begin to shape your life and shape
[6:17] the way you think and you'll begin to
[6:18] come come to God and God can clean you
[6:21] up but now see there's there's the
[6:23] mystery of the under the first seal is
[6:25] that the Holy Ghost can drive that
[6:28] unclean Spirit out
[6:29] and clean you up and that is the recipe
[6:33] for getting rid of your iniquity what
[6:35] you need is the holy ghost in your life
[6:37] and that will make you clean that will
[6:39] clean you up and sanctify you and make
[6:42] you holy
[6:44] right and John John MacArthur I just got
[6:46] some quotes here about living a holy
[6:48] life he said this is a nation so far
[6:50] down in the sewer of immortality and in
[6:52] wickedness that nothing surprises me and
[6:55] Billy Graham said regardless of what
[6:56] society says we can't go on much longer
[6:59] longer in the sea of immorality without
[7:00] judgment coming you think about the
[7:04] whole world is is is just
[7:08] uh gone into filth and and and
[7:11] horribleness 1 Corinthians chapter 6
[7:13] says flee from sexual immorality every
[7:17] other sin a person commits is outside
[7:19] the body but the sexual sexually immoral
[7:22] person sins against his own body and
[7:25] Paul goes on to explain that if you go
[7:26] read in 1 Corinthians 6 because that
[7:29] that kind of that that kind of sin
[7:31] you're joining yourself to another
[7:33] another body when two bodies are joined
[7:35] together you become one flesh in 1
[7:37] Corinthians 6:15 he said know you not
[7:39] that your bodies are the members of
[7:40] Christ shall I then take the members of
[7:43] Christ and make them the members of an
[7:45] Harlot God forbid CU you got that law
[7:47] that that that U that according to the
[7:50] scripture you two two bodies coming
[7:52] together and I know I'm speaking a
[7:53] little bit frankly this morning for sun
[7:55] for Sunday school maybe but it become
[7:57] two bodies become one flesh
[8:00] in 1 Thessalonians chapter 4 it says for
[8:02] this is the will of God now think about
[8:04] this the will of God is for you to live
[8:06] a holy and clean life right God does not
[8:09] want you to sit in church for 10 20
[8:11] years and be going home and looking at
[8:12] stuff on the internet that you're not
[8:14] supposed to be looking and lusting after
[8:16] things that you're not supposed to be he
[8:17] wants that's the the will of God is for
[8:21] God to clean you up the will of God even
[8:25] your
[8:26] sanctification that you should abstain
[8:28] from fornication that every one of you
[8:29] should know how to possess his vessel in
[8:31] sanctification and honor God wants you
[8:35] to know how to how to possess your
[8:37] spirit to keep your body under
[8:39] subjection to turn your eye when
[8:42] something uh walks walks in front of
[8:44] your path he said not in the lust of
[8:46] concupiscence that's that word that
[8:48] means that uncontrolled urge that like
[8:51] like y'all know even as the Gentiles
[8:55] which know not God that no man go beyond
[8:58] and defraud his brother than any matter
[9:00] because that the Lord is the Avengers of
[9:01] all such as Al as we also have
[9:03] forewarned you and testified for God
[9:06] hath not called us unto
[9:08] uncleanness but unto Holiness God wants
[9:11] a holy cleaned up church and he's going
[9:14] to have a spotless bride a bride without
[9:17] any spot without any wrinkle that's the
[9:18] kind of bride that's God that God is
[9:20] going to have and Ephesians chapter 5 he
[9:22] said but fornication and all uncleanness
[9:24] or covetousness let it not be once named
[9:27] among you as becometh Saints now now let
[9:30] it not be once named among you means
[9:33] don't don't even joke about it don't
[9:35] talk about it with your you know joking
[9:38] around in the parking lot just leave it
[9:40] over to the side just all that unclean
[9:43] conversation now look what Paul's saying
[9:45] neither filthiness filthy jokes have no
[9:49] place in a Christian's conversation nor
[9:51] foolish talking nor jesting now that
[9:55] kind of jesting is not the jesting like
[9:57] you know why we're just we you know we
[9:59] we like to have fun but that's not what
[10:02] Paul's talking about he's saying the
[10:04] word that word in Greek means is Utopia
[10:07] which means that w a word play that is
[10:11] clever but also potentially suggestive
[10:14] or offensive you're saying something
[10:16] that sound uh there's like that
[10:18] underlying meaning that's that's a
[10:21] little bit
[10:22] filthy that that joke that a Christian
[10:25] don't have no business telling because
[10:27] you know somebody over hear it and
[10:28] you're like that sounds like that sounds
[10:31] like a worldly person's
[10:33] joke neither filthiness nor foolish
[10:35] talking nor jesting which are not
[10:38] convenient but rather giving of thanks
[10:41] for this you know that no whoremonger
[10:44] nor unclean person nor Covetous man who
[10:48] is an idolator hath any inheritance in
[10:51] the kingdom of God Covetous man now
[10:54] there there we're going again into the
[10:56] the next thing that Paul's going to talk
[10:58] about
[10:59] so in 2 Timothy Chapter 2 he says flee
[11:03] also the youthful lust but follow
[11:06] righteousness Faith charity peace with
[11:10] them that call on the Lord out of a pure
[11:13] heart God wants us to have pure motives
[11:17] pure thinking pure conversation our
[11:19] whole life cleaned up uh everything just
[11:22] just pure righteousness Faith charity
[11:24] peace all those things like a nice clear
[11:29] stream just bubbling out of the
[11:30] mountains with no filth in it that's the
[11:34] kind of life and conversation that God
[11:35] wants us to have in the message
[11:38] Fellowship he said it's later than what
[11:40] we think it is the coming of the Lord at
[11:43] hand man's Hearts is to the place
[11:45] civilization falling sinking right now
[11:47] just look at this America what a
[11:50] disgrace Look what Jesus said in the
[11:52] last days like it was when Noah they'd
[11:55] be given in marriage and things look at
[11:57] the divorce courts in America is great
[11:58] greater than all the nations put
[12:00] together look at the immoral and you
[12:03] think about divorce I I think I read
[12:05] that 50% of all married couples are
[12:07] going to get
[12:08] divorced look at the
[12:10] immorality look at the perversion of sex
[12:13] perverted clothes out in the west coast
[12:14] and all around now it's the same as it
[12:16] was in the day of lot where you couldn't
[12:18] even find 10 Clean people in the day of
[12:20] lot now look it's come on over to the
[12:23] same thing that's the day where God's
[12:26] going to have a pure spotless bride to
[12:28] show the devil somebody's going to be
[12:29] able to believe his word and live it
[12:32] thousands times thousands growing every
[12:34] year filth dirty ungodly taking the
[12:36] natural use of the body and being
[12:38] perverted into something people with
[12:39] perverted Minds men go out and carry on
[12:42] the way they do women wearing these
[12:44] little old clothes out there they don't
[12:45] think they're wrong sure not their
[12:47] mind's perverted the devil's got a hold
[12:50] of them they don't know
[12:51] it now maybe this maybe these things
[12:54] that I'm reading here will go out and
[12:56] convince somebody if they're not living
[12:58] right and not doing right if you match
[13:00] up with this what this quote is saying
[13:03] then maybe it's time to get right so
[13:04] that your life matches up with the parts
[13:07] of the word that will identify you as a
[13:09] real Christian believer it's time to not
[13:12] pity Patty around and play but but make
[13:14] sure that we're right with
[13:16] God I I was talking with somebody
[13:19] recently where they I think sometimes
[13:20] people get kind of confused about the
[13:22] stature for a perfect man where they
[13:23] lump everything over into growth and say
[13:26] well I can live wrong but that just
[13:29] means I'm going up the statue of perfect
[13:30] man no I I think it's time we get
[13:33] convicted and get really get let's get
[13:35] straight with God and maybe find out if
[13:37] we're really born again or not instead
[13:39] of saying well I'm I'm born again I'm
[13:40] just climbing up the statue of a perfect
[13:42] man all it's not time for greasy Grace
[13:45] it's time for living right and living
[13:46] holy and and making sure we're we're
[13:48] Towing the
[13:50] line and so Paul says let your
[13:53] conversation be without
[13:56] covetousness and be content
[13:59] with such things as you have for he hath
[14:02] said I will I will never leave thee nor
[14:05] forsake thee so that we may boldly say
[14:08] the Lord is my helper and I will not
[14:11] fear what man shall do unto me now you
[14:14] as we meditate on this you know a lot of
[14:16] the Christian journey is is having the
[14:17] right mindset the right mental attitude
[14:20] toward any of God's word will bring it
[14:22] to pass so when we have the right look
[14:25] what these scriptures are doing they're
[14:26] changing the way we look at our
[14:28] situation and the way that we're looking
[14:29] at how we're living a as we meditate on
[14:32] this now now covetousness and in in
[14:35] Exodus it says Thou shalt not covet thy
[14:37] neighbor's house that so that your
[14:40] neighbor got a nice house and you look
[14:41] at that and say well I wish I had that
[14:43] and you start thinking wrong thoughts
[14:44] about it Thou shalt not cover thy
[14:46] neighbor's wife maybe you start looking
[14:49] at your your spouse and you think man I
[14:52] don't like my spouse I wish I had
[14:55] somebody else I wish my spouse was like
[14:57] somebody else and then you start going
[14:59] down the wrong the wrong Avenue with it
[15:01] nor his manservant nor his maid servant
[15:05] nor his Ox nor his ass nor anything that
[15:10] is thy neighbors now now so what's the
[15:12] antidote to be to covet is to just be
[15:15] content with what God has given you now
[15:18] there now there's a secret to a happy
[15:21] life if you've got a little box or if
[15:24] you got a mansion to be satisfied with
[15:28] what God God has given you right now now
[15:30] there's a there's a oh you can get into
[15:32] some listen you got out to churches and
[15:34] there's some pastors that wish they have
[15:36] a big giant church if you just be
[15:39] content with what God has given you no
[15:41] matter where you are in life if you got
[15:43] a small church or a big church a small
[15:45] house or a big house a small family or a
[15:47] big family a lot of money in the bank or
[15:49] a little money in the bank but to be
[15:51] happy and content with whatever God has
[15:54] given you amen if you get invited to
[15:57] preach a lot or if you don't get get
[15:58] invited to preach a lot no matter where
[16:00] you are in life if you can say God is
[16:02] using me God I'm right where I'm
[16:05] supposed to be if you're just a little
[16:06] housewife in a kitchen making biscuits
[16:09] in the morning and that's what God has
[16:11] wants you to to do then be satisfied
[16:13] with that and then you can be content
[16:16] knowing that you're where God wants you
[16:18] to be so let your conversation be
[16:21] without covetousness and be
[16:24] content with such things as you have for
[16:27] he hath said I will never leave thee nor
[16:31] forsake thee now if you've got that
[16:33] promise lay in the Bible that means no
[16:36] matter what you've got in life as long
[16:39] as you've got Christ you got everything
[16:41] that you need now that's one thing we
[16:43] kind of lose sight of sometimes if if if
[16:46] God is for me who can be against me if
[16:49] God's got my back that's all I need and
[16:51] and we forget sometimes that God if if
[16:54] God is influencing our life and guiding
[16:57] our life we're on like a a track as long
[17:00] as I got my hand on that guide rail like
[17:02] brother BR talked about as long as I'm
[17:03] holding on to that and don't let go God
[17:06] is going to see me to the finish line so
[17:08] I should be content with that right
[17:11] trusting and relying that he is going to
[17:13] see us to the Finish Line because he's
[17:15] got us we're we're his and he's ours
[17:18] amen so that we may boldly say the Lord
[17:22] is my helper and I will not fear what
[17:26] man shall do unto me now there's when
[17:29] you're really trusting in the Lord when
[17:30] you're trusting that God's going to take
[17:33] care of the situation
[17:36] right so he Paul's saying in Hebrews
[17:38] chapter 13 let your conversation be
[17:40] without covetousness and be content in
[17:43] Luke chapter 12 it said and he said unto
[17:46] them take heed and beware of
[17:48] covetousness for a man's life consisteth
[17:51] not in the abundance of the things which
[17:53] he
[17:54] possesseth in Colossians chapter 3 it
[17:56] says mortify Therefore your members
[17:58] which upon the Earth fornication
[17:59] uncleanness inordinate affection evil
[18:03] concupisent and look how it looks lumps
[18:05] in covetousness with all of those things
[18:09] that seem to be pertaining to immoral
[18:11] Unholy living covetousness which is
[18:15] idolatry in 1 Timothy 6:10 For the Love
[18:18] of Money is the root of all evil which
[18:21] while some coveted after they have aired
[18:24] from the faith and pierced themselves
[18:27] through with any
[18:29] Sorrows brother brand would say
[18:31] selfishness greed immorality everything
[18:34] else that's in the calendar of God's
[18:36] wrongdoing the church is picking up
[18:38] those habits men drinking smoking
[18:41] telling jokes women cutting their hair
[18:44] wearing makeup doing all kinds of things
[18:46] dressing themselves immorally to face
[18:48] the people all those things are because
[18:51] it's a lack of the blood of the Lord
[18:53] Jesus Christ that cleanse us from all
[18:57] unrighteousness and another place he
[18:59] said lot was down there greedy and went
[19:01] down in Sodom and kept leaning his tent
[19:05] that way because perhaps Mrs lot wanted
[19:07] them kind of dresses that they were
[19:08] wearing down in Sodom and she wanted to
[19:11] be like that see God God had given them
[19:15] everything they needed but they looked
[19:17] down in Sodom and weren't satisfied with
[19:19] what they had and started to
[19:22] covet the
[19:25] world Paul would say in Romans chapter 7
[19:27] what shall we say then is the law sin
[19:29] God forbid they I had not know known sin
[19:31] but by the law now look how he says this
[19:34] for I had not known lust except the law
[19:37] had said Thou shalt not covet so he's
[19:40] equating lusting with coveting and then
[19:44] Ephesians chapter 5 but fornication and
[19:46] all uncleanness or covetousness let it
[19:48] not be once named among you as becometh
[19:50] Saints let it not even be mentioned and
[19:54] Colossians chapter 3 mortify Therefore
[19:56] your members which are upon the Earth
[19:58] Earth fornication uncleanness inordinate
[20:01] affection evil concupiscence and
[20:03] covetousness which is
[20:06] idolatry I want to throw this in there
[20:08] too cuz brother Brown said I haven't
[20:10] covet money he said I don't take money I
[20:13] was a Baptist preacher for several years
[20:15] 12 years pasture of Tabernacle there at
[20:17] Jeffersonville and never one time took
[20:19] an offering in my life never one time I
[20:22] work for a living in other words it
[20:24] wasn't he wasn't doing it for money
[20:26] let's let's we read what he he telling
[20:28] the story and Israel in the church about
[20:30] this Rancher that walked out of there he
[20:32] said Reverend Bram I said yes sir he
[20:34] said you see them mountains Over Yonder
[20:37] now picture this story he's he's
[20:38] pointing to the mountains way out in the
[20:40] distance I said yes sir how far you
[20:42] think they are away I said I don't know
[20:44] he said they're 80 miles said I own Plum
[20:47] to that and Plum beyond that it's my
[20:50] grazing ground I said my that's
[20:53] wonderful he said now see down in there
[20:55] see that City he said I own the bank in
[20:57] that City City I own all that ground
[20:59] down around there and I own this way oh
[21:02] all he all all that land he could as far
[21:04] as he could see that little thing over
[21:07] there that thing over there all the way
[21:08] down to the mountains and then brother
[21:10] brandom said I stopped in this little
[21:13] station wag and I looked at him very
[21:15] nice man I laid my hand on his shoulder
[21:17] I said brother I want to ask you a
[21:19] question he said all right I said look
[21:21] right up this way look go that
[21:23] way how much do you own of that o he
[21:27] said brother random I'm afraid I don't
[21:29] own anything I said there's where my
[21:31] treasures are laying now I don't have
[21:34] nothing down here but a tent or a
[21:37] cottage why should I care they're
[21:39] building a place a palace for me over
[21:41] there of rubies and diamonds and silver
[21:43] and gold his coffers are full and has
[21:46] riches Untold yes sir that's where the
[21:48] riches lays up yonder where your
[21:50] Treasures is your heart is also now now
[21:54] now that's summing up all those things
[21:56] that Paul just talked about to not covet
[21:59] anything of this world not covet
[22:00] somebody don't covet that big nice car
[22:02] your neighbor's got but covet this covet
[22:06] Treasures in Heaven I I I was I was
[22:09] watching in the news recently some some
[22:11] big Hollywood star died and I was
[22:13] thinking about all the stuff that they
[22:14] had all the great riches and everything
[22:16] and then they go down into the grave and
[22:19] and what what is all what is that what
[22:21] is your life for if you just live for
[22:23] the things of this world but if you live
[22:25] for God and you're stored up treasure in
[22:28] heaven what does it matter if you just
[22:29] got a little cottage what if you what
[22:31] does it matter if you got a little
[22:32] concrete house like these little
[22:33] brothers and sisters in Nicaragua or
[22:35] Honduras that don't have nothing in the
[22:37] world but they've got Treasures in
[22:39] Heaven that's more than
[22:41] anything I I was watching a interview of
[22:45] this um this uh actor where they were
[22:47] saying they were asking them why do do
[22:50] the these big Hollywood stars that have
[22:52] everything and they got all this money
[22:54] why do they get so caught up in drugs
[22:56] and he said I'll give you a fair answer
[22:58] and I thought that was pretty good he
[22:59] said because we're born with something
[23:02] empty on in on the inside and I'm we're
[23:04] trying to feel that and see there's the
[23:07] only thing that'll feel that Emptiness
[23:09] is what we're preaching about today and
[23:11] this morning is the is the Gospel of
[23:14] Jesus Christ the only thing that can
[23:16] feel that emptiness that thirst that's
[23:18] in every every person's heart is the
[23:21] life of God so what does Paul say in
[23:24] verse one he says let Brotherly Love
[23:26] continue but not forgetful to entertain
[23:28] strangers for thereby some of entertain
[23:31] Angels unawares remember them that are
[23:33] in bonds as bound with them and them
[23:35] which suffer adversity is being
[23:36] yourselves also in the body marriage is
[23:39] Honorable in all and the bed undefiled
[23:41] but whoremongers and adulterers God will
[23:44] judge let your conversation be without
[23:46] covetousness and be content with such
[23:48] things as you have for he ha said I will
[23:51] never leave thee nor forsake thee so
[23:53] that we may boldly say the Lord is my
[23:57] helper and I will not fear what man
[23:59] shall do unto me and in verse S and 8 we
[24:03] we we we'll just kind of get finish on
[24:05] this remember them which have the rule
[24:09] over you amen now there's a scripture
[24:11] that's a little bit
[24:13] misinterpreted who have spoken unto you
[24:15] the word of God whose Faith follow
[24:18] considering the end of their
[24:21] conversation what's the end of their
[24:23] conversation Jesus Christ the same
[24:27] yesterday to day today and forever now
[24:31] the reason I say it's a little bit
[24:32] misinterpreted let's see let's see what
[24:34] brother brandom really said that because
[24:36] we think sometimes the rule over you
[24:38] means like uh that that there's going to
[24:40] be like a king over you that's going to
[24:42] rule over you come into your home and
[24:44] tell you how to dress and how to do and
[24:46] everything and when you need to come to
[24:47] church and and and control you like that
[24:50] and uh but but that's not exactly the
[24:54] way that brother brandom explained this
[24:56] he said it is the word that rules us not
[24:59] men now see we're up behind the pulpit
[25:02] and we're preaching the word to you and
[25:04] when the word grabs a hold of your life
[25:06] is not a man controlling you and telling
[25:07] you every little detail about how you
[25:09] need to live your life but you become
[25:11] subject to the word and the word begins
[25:13] to control you you become like Paul I
[25:16] I'm I'm a prisoner to Jesus Christ and
[25:18] the word says I need to come to church
[25:20] so I'm going to come to church not
[25:21] because a man told me that if I don't
[25:23] come to church I'm going to get a
[25:24] scolding but because the word tells me I
[25:26] need to he said said now a man as a
[25:28] husband is head of the woman he rules
[25:30] her but the church is a woman too and
[25:32] her ruler is the word Jesus is the word
[25:35] if she rejects the word and takes any
[25:37] other headship she is an adulteress
[25:41] let's let's read this quote well we got
[25:44] one minute let's read this in these
[25:45] different translations and we'll end on
[25:47] this as the musicians come forward and
[25:49] the NIV remember your leaders who spoke
[25:52] the word of God to you consider the
[25:54] outcome of their way of life and imitate
[25:57] their faith in the ESV remember your
[26:00] leaders those who spoke to you the word
[26:02] of God consider the outcome of their way
[26:03] so what's it talking about your leaders
[26:06] just got to be living a good life
[26:08] because otherwise you will you will lose
[26:10] confidence in them and you will not be
[26:12] able to fulfill their scripture that's
[26:14] why it's so oh we get into something
[26:16] here the next time maybe and NLT
[26:19] remember your leaders who taught you the
[26:21] word of God think of all the good that
[26:22] has come from their lives and follow the
[26:26] example of their faith and the nasb
[26:29] remember those who led you who spoke the
[26:30] word of God to you and considering the
[26:33] result of their way of life imitate
[26:36] their faith and we'll end on that God
[26:39] bless
[26:41] [Applause]
[26:56] you
