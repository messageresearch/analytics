just remember that every other month amen father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day that you've given unto us and what a wonderful day it is Lord to be able to talk about you after all of these years we've never been able to exalt exhaust exhaust all the things that we see about you and we've only tried to exalt you into the position of who you are and where you're at and Lord we ask as you would just bless each one now come and speak to our hearts that as we may be led of thy Spirit to speak of Thy word that you would come and honor that by revealing it and then making it manifest among us we love you and we thank you just blessing God remember those that are not here brother Daniel away preaching remember each one have your way now in Jesus name oh man all right Revelations 1. maybe this will be the last time I said maybe okay the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants the things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God into the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he sought blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand the time to reveal right so let's go back now to Hebrews 1. and we'll read the first like three verses God who at sundered times in diverse manner State spake in times past unto the fathers by or in other words in the prophets hath in these last days spoken unto us by or what in his son whom he hath appointed air of All Things by whom also he made the worlds who being the brightness of his glory and expressed image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he had by himself purged our sins set down on the right hand of the Majesty on high you may be seated the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now uh I pray and hope that you followed what I was saying this morning and a lot of that came to me to be able to say and that's the way I like to preach I like to preach when it's coming to me you know and giving me understanding but I pray that you would go back and listen to that message and try to make sure you get the connection of what I'm saying because I'm going to say it a few times this evening you know the same way that the the John that we're talking about on Patmos it it's not the time of revealing and that's where I believe people are getting it confused and then that way they're they're making brother Branham be the the one to come and they're trying to move it to here or move it to their to try to to establish it but uh you know I just can't see that that away you know and I believe it was The Profit that come to John but I want you to follow it we'll get into that in a little bit and and see something from the scriptures that have read all right now but I want you to to think about what I say in this morning now the in the writing of the book of of Revelations we read in there that uh you know that an angel come to John to write the book all right brother random as we'll get back to it in a minute said that that was the only book in the Bible whereas Jesus per appearing personally to the Scribe all right now John is described he is not the author actually of the book The Lord Jesus Christ is the author of the book actually he is just described you know writing down after the author brings it in other words like somebody sitting in brother collie I would say now brother Kali you can type so I'll tell you my life story you type it because see that would be delivered to somebody else to to handle the point but I hope you was listening to what it was saying see back there when that was written John saw a lamb 2000 years ago because that was 1895 and 96 basically is when John was writing the The Book of Revelation and he saw a lamb and he saw him come forth and take the book and the things you know and he wrote it in symbolics and you know to open the word all right that was in the writing of the book all right see because it would be completed then because God would be riding now as I said this morning he was writing the book about a finished product and we are the people of the book you know the the entire Bible it's people all right so back there he could write about what was going to be in the church ages to come and things like that and put it in a book and give it to John to write to to let the people have it and they could read it because it was the writing of the book all right and then that the lamb came forth took to the book out of the hand of the one that was uh sitting on the throne and you know and doing those things and open the seals and we see that all right but see then there was parts of that book that was not totally completed because it was writing about future things to come all right so in writing about the future things to come it would be writing about the Bride of Jesus Christ okay and writing about her then when that book is completed the prophet said then the lamb can take the book after it's completed see all right you go into the breach and the different things you know and and you'll find the statements that I'm making that after the book is completed or in other words after the book Is Made Alive here in the end time we see that the prophet said that that lamb having the seven horns and seven eyes it actually came from the church ages it was produced by the church ages just as the Old Testament the lamb was produced by the by the people you know bringing forth Jesus Christ all right sin he's to come forth again in the end time in Bride form to fulfill Revelations 1 uh 13 and all standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick well as it is when that's completed then this we are the not you and I going we're not going to Israel that's not you know no no uh it is this message that will go to Israel but not just bet hates and books and and they've already got this message brother Perry green years ago uh made sure they had the message over there you know and they played it on things we've seen it on their TVs their things you know all right but that's not it it's it's when the message is Made Alive by the Bride of Jesus Christ and being made alive see then that can go to Israel and see the lamb then brought around him is right when he's saying that the lamb comes forth from the church ages to take the book not for back there but for over here the word this book can go to Israel see he's going to take this book and break the seals off and show Israel that they rejected this message but the Gentiles has accepted the message and thereby you know we can we are ready to go all right now so in doing that now we'll try to um to just make sure you understand one thing then we'll jump on over real quick see make sure you understand if you don't ask me questions about it you know maybe I don't understand but that's all right I really enjoy preaching you know and have a good time talking about the Lord and the things I see but see then that puts it into like two parts one is for back there of the literal writing of the book then John didn't have to be translated over here to see it he only wrote what he saw which would be the visions of down here and the people and the things amen it would be doing those things and that way you don't have to have pre-existences or or I guess it's post-existence or what it is coming meaning later or you know the future and and all and uh I never could understand that because I can't keep folding pretty straight but that's all right but you know I just believe it all right see that way you don't have to worry about whether it was brother Branham that come to John on Patmos your concern will be about the great one that would come to do all things all right that great one would be the one that I tried to preach to you about you know a few weeks ago a few Services back when I was talking about the reason I didn't believe it because I I believe that's the one brother Brown was waiting on he was waiting on one to come right all right and it couldn't come into early Ministry because the background was not there of the opening of the word as far as the faith of the fathers he couldn't come back there on Azusa Street and walk out there and say I am uh the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob and he couldn't hardly he couldn't say that Jehovah the old is Jesus of the new to those people because their Pentecost I mean Zeus is straight Pentecost now they were actually trinitarians the one that's Doctrine started after that somewhere around 1912 14 through there you start the Oneness type of form of Doctrine because they were trinitarian how could he explain the seals to them right how could he explain the things to those people it took him 30 something years to get word that he could preach the statue of a perfect man now that's what he said about it and watch it in a minute now the two parts will run around this message that we've tried to express to you and it'll help you to understand what I'm trying to get to because you see I believe the great one is the Lord Jesus Christ I believe that's the one that come to John on Patmos right right was the Lord Jesus Christ because that's what the scripture says man the Revelation that God give to Jesus to give to John and then brought around page 12 13 of the church age book he said it was the only book whereas a prophet personally or Jesus personally appearing to a scribe now brother let me say this and then we'll get back to it in a minute see John the Revelator was not a prophet like Moses Elijah wrote a random Etc right he could be a prophet in The Fault Ministry but he was not a prophet to do the so you say well the word come to the prophet well it's all right but remember who came it was the Lord Jesus Christ now you watch that you'll see what I'm talking about in Hebrews one in a minute all right and we'll follow that point down but remember now we're dealing with the writing of the book and then that way I said I don't believe right around came back there that would be pre-existence because you'd say well now brother Dale we don't believe that brother Branham come back there physically we believe he come back to our in theophany well I'm just honest as I could be I've always thought that Prophet meant word and flesh right I mean that was always my concept of it was word and flesh that's what it was to Moses the Moses was the word made flesh those prophets were the word made flesh for their time the Lord Jesus was the god of the prophets the prophet all right so then keep that in your thoughts as we go through something and then I'll try to hurry up and get through thank you see I believe the great one that come to brother Branham was the Lord Jesus Christ that's right just as the great one that come to John was the Lord Jesus Christ to write the book all right now in the writing of the book then you see it and then the revealing of the book would be the same I got right here it says explain it lent now remember you're dealing with the writing of the book and not the revealing of the book right there's two thousand years difference almost 1970 25 if you want to be technical or you know somewhere in that 20. see there's that much difference between the writing of the book and the revealing of the book there's a vast difference between those things it had to be written first to be put into book form right right then that book form could come alive in you and I and we would be the words that are on the pages living reality of Jesus Christ all right then that can be taken to Israel because it's got to be in a live book it can't be a just letters on the page it ain't going nowhere it is going to say we want you to know we're going to start here in Acts 1 we're going to start hearing that we're going to read here now as I said I don't think they'll take right around this message and say this is on page so and so this is on but no they'll go over there and they'll preach the Lord Jesus Christ from their own experience of the Holy Ghost coming in them all right the alive word to them and then naturally that will cover us one because they'll have to tell about us so that'll be fine all right now see it would have to be as I said written before you could take it to break the seal so it's written back there right all right now that's written down here and you and I then it can be revealed to Israel from there but you remember the message now that I I spoke on a couple of services and I tried to tie it together that The Book of Revelations then would be written the same as the Book of Genesis right now the Lord Jesus Christ came to John O Pat Mr Wright now the Lord Jesus Christ came to Moses into burning bush you saw now that wouldn't Jesus the flesh I didn't say that when I say the flesh I know how to say flesh it was Jesus Christ it was in that burning bush because see the Bible is correct it says that what the Bible was written by the prophets because the word comes only to the prophets all right Amos 3 and 7 will do nothing but revealeth his secrets and do his service to prophet all right and all the Bible would be written the same way now you remember how we brought that out from The Burning Bush Moses in meeting God which was Christ in the burning bush you've uh I don't think I gave you them but you shouldn't need them anyway you know there's enough to where we can do it and talk about it because of what we preach but anybody on tape let me know if you don't see that see Christ was the angel that was in the burning bush according to the book of Acts all right that was the angel of the Covenant that was Christ not Jesus the flesh no but it was Jesus Christ the angel of the Covenant that met Moses in the burning bush and told him what to write in Genesis well it was the Lord Jesus Christ that come to John to tell him what to write in the Book of Revelations so you got the whole thing being written by the prophets all right now in doing that then I I mentioned it this morning I just left the thought in your mind then what about the writing of Matthew Mark Luke John uh the book of Acts Peter on Paul oh James you know and the things now you know they wrote the Bible right right know what they wrote about they wrote about their day that's right right they wrote about what they saw they wrote about what they experienced they wrote about what they lived all right now but you know who brought that to him was it not the same Lord Jesus Christ in the form how did Paul say he got it right not from man but he said he got it from God I know how to get it from God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was inside of him right that Holy Ghost is the one who was responsible to bring to those people to write but get the point now they wrote what they were experiencing amen there would be some prophecy out of Paul and things and the different ones that would be speaking of a later time yes but basically their thoughts were based upon what they were experiencing what was taking place and they straightened it out there's Paul wrote around and said Paul straightened Outlaw in Grace they bringing it to the correct understanding he was bringing it like that all right and that would be the Lord Jesus Christ speaking through the baptism of the Holy Ghost to them bringing that amen all right that would be the Lord appearing to them but brother random made the specific point of saying see that The Book of Revelation was written by the Lord Jesus Christ appearing personally now he said the only book in the Bible that's right right right whereas the Lord Jesus Christ appearings personally to write see because the Book of Revelations was going to be of future things more than just what was there he starts out in chapter one showing you the future of the Bride we went through those things right right see that's why it says if you notice in the scripture happen these last days spoken unto us yeah by his son all right so in other words anything after Paul all right anything after Paul in the writing of the Hebrews or writing the scriptures you know are them writing anything after that would have to come to word that Jesus Christ would appear to write the future he's not just writing about what's going on he's going to tell the future so he personally appears who the prophet why because the word come to the prophet now don't you remember how much we've been over and over the revelation what how many times we read Revelations 1 the Revelation that God give to Jesus right right so Jesus is the prophet so then he could come and live in a disciples and tell them how to write of their day and time where they were and some prophecies of the future but then he would come to John to take it into a D and he would sin and signify what he was talking to John about bye an angel brother said that's got to be a prophet all right now so we're right back where we've been all the time I believe not that brother random come to John on Batman us know I believe be Prophet come to John on pouch the Lord Jesus Christ the god of the prophets the prophet the great one all right now I gave you a couple of things I may not finish this sermon this even if I don't I'll finish it later any word about it look what you got now over just on the page it's the back page of you know so that doesn't have nothing on one side okay and look what brother Brown says about it because I brought these out this morning or you know last night before when I was finishing up writing my notes and things now remembered it got up this morning and ran these off to where it ran look what he says in the breach 1963 317. he's talking about that the prophets who wrote the word at the sounding of the seventh angel and coming down and Elusive to the church ages um what been probed at in time and when the seals are broke and the Mystery is revealed down comes the angel the messenger now that's not brother Branham right right are well because right around here watch Christ setting his foot up on the land and up on the sea with a rainbow over his head now remember this seventh angel is on Earth at the time of this coming amen so that was brought around him on Earth the seventh angel we're going to split that Ministry in just a minute so you'll see what I'm talking about all right and there he was on Earth and then here comes the great one that's what I believe Here Comes The Great One to to tell right around him watch his brain well then it would be the great one back there that would tell John what to write that angel that come to John would be the great one brought around covers it over and gets into the scripture see that that messenger that come to John would have to be a prophet huh and that's fine he even said I don't know I may have it in Europe you said that it may have been Elijah we don't know who it is he said but see everybody knows it was brought around them you know that's the way they're bringing well see they now you've got pre-existence and and posts you've got all kind of things and and it just won't line up but see the great one will that's who brother random was waiting on and like I told you even the angel that was with him that was right around them from birth why didn't he tell him what the seals were even the great one on the the Ohio river that announced and said as your message for John the Baptist 4 run the first come in your message before on the second coming but he still didn't tell him what the seals were that would have been who Gabriel to announce the second coming right all right we covered all of those things but it wouldn't be the one that could have opened the seals only the lamb can break the seals man only the lamb can and on the whole only the Holy Ghost can reveal to the lamb and the Holy Ghost must be the same person or else you're messed up right but going down this is a continual reading so just keep reading that was page 40 742 this 74 3. just as John was giving his message the same time that Messiah come in the days all right Messiah companies talking about the great one to come the prophet would be here the great one would come just as John the Baptist was giving his message who came the Lord Jesus Christ right at the same time that the Messiah come in that in the days John knew he would see him because he was going to introduce him and we realized that in the scripture over in Malachi 4 there's to be one like John and Elijah to whom the word of God can come to amen we believe it don't we and he is to reveal by the holy spirit all the mysteries of God and restore the face of the children back to the faith of the apostolic fathers restore back all these Mysteries that's been probed out through these denominational ages those years now that's what the word said I'm just responsible for what it said I'm just responsible for what it said see it's written is right that's what it is now watch it now we see that this seven seal book now is the mystery of redemption it's a book of redemption from God now all the Mysteries at this time should be finished at the sounding of this Messenger right all right that was the years of preparation I brought around this ministry from 47 to 63. right and here's the angel on Earth no the messenger blood around them in other words and another I enjoy Mighty messenger come down see this Angel was an Earthly Angel messenger But Here Comes the one down from heaven a rainbow Covenant see only Christ it could be just like it was in Revelation the first chapter standing in the midst of the seven golden candlestick with a rainbow to look upon this Jasper and sort of stone so who wrote the Bible the word of God come into the prophets okay but as I said about the writing of Matthew Mark Luke and John and I they were writing what took place and relationship to what was living are and then Paul would prophesy of things to come you know the Rapture Etc sure why because he was the greatest of all of those and understood more than all the rest of the Apostles you agree all right now but yet when it comes to John on patlis it's just not the Lord Jesus listen to him saying it's not just the Lord Jesus coming to John right you're not listening it's the Lord Jesus coming to the angel to come to John now about the first service I preached on this whole thing I said watch that angel he begins to step back out of the way why because once Christ steps on the scene the angel is not important amen when Christ comes on the scene to you it doesn't do away with brother Branham he puts it in the right place but Christ is the one we're talking about see he's the one so brother Ritter makes Revelations 10 1 the same as Revelation 1 13. but again you understand what I'm saying he could the the apostles could write what was going on and a situation around them and the word being brought to them as to why they believed it like they were like the the disciples see Peter explaining how to climb up the statue of a perfect man that he had experienced it all right but then when it comes to Patmos the Revelation come to get Jesus right to give to the angel to give to John all right and see that way then we believe that that was the prophet that come to John on Patmos right the prophet I I asked the brother that I talked about it one day I said well why would you want to narrow it down to one you know why wouldn't you believe it's all the prophets he said well I never thought of it I said why don't you believe it the prophet is the Lord Jesus Christ right you know I mean I'd rather go that way than any way I know of if I'm wrong come and tell me I don't internet you hear it come I'm sure it may get some response off of that and I open it up and say come and tell me because I want to be right but see it's like I told you to start with I'm not concerned where brother Branham come to John I'm concerned where Jesus come to bread around them because that's where my connection is at is where the Lord Jesus Christ come to brother random to tell him this thing that's the one I'm concerned with right because all of my hopes are set upon that that doing it all right now make on these things all right if you need one on the Christ being the angel of the Covenant I didn't give it to you but it's off the message love 57 519 and it's also uh paragraph 88 87 uh we would see Jesus right because he's the angel of the Covenant see all right then who did we see now listen who did we see come to Moses the Lord Jesus Christ right but what form was he in he was in the form of the son of God right he was in the form of the son of God in other words the logos the theophany God himself in another form right which would have been who would be coming to Moses right the son of man would be coming to him who the word that's right you know not a flesh standing out there it was a burning bush Moses turns out to be that one that's called the son of man but Moses emphatically stated listen that God is going to raise up a prophet like unto me if you don't hear that prophet you're going to be in bad shape read it Moses at the burning bush where he tells him what to do and things I am the that that I am you know I am that I am and when it when it scripture finish it up it says beware of mine Angel because my name is in him I only wouldn't use the name wrote on his back he's walking out this is who I represent you know that was the Lord Jesus Christ a prophetic form of almighty God the son of man the word that come to Moses and Moses wrote it because he was a prophet because the word always come to the prophet all right and in doing it then what are we dealing with we're dealing with the Christ so who come to John on Patmos an angel come to Moses to write which is the Christ the angel of the Covenant the Son of God the Lord God everything like that would be who come to Moses to write that's how he knew what happened in Genesis the first chapter second third and fourth chapter fifth is basically writing about what's taking place you know are the laws and the things but it's something that's taking place whereas chapter I mean the beginning of chapter one of Genesis is about what good place that it would take a profit to get it right all right now so here we come then to John on Patmos the Revelation that God give to Jesus you remember I was bringing that up back there the Revelation that God gave to the angel of Christ to bring to Moses to tell him I was written no he wants right so he got the same thing happening in the Book of Revelation same identical Point all right the angel that came to Moses was the prophet not a prophet he was the Christ the son of the Living God all right now we're going to get down to stardom because the word comes only to the prophet see the word came to the prophet the son of man the word the son of man came to a son of man right right to write okay so then that's what it's doing in the Book of Revelation all right now to write what Moses saw him let's see if we can get started now let's let's start on number one of your notes you ought to know this Moses was a prophet sent from God all right anybody to argue with that point there's something wrong with you and that's from expectation just in case people hear it 1950 that he was a prophet and I only had the signs and then you go over to the unveiling of God 1964 614 number two on your notes and you'll find it Moses with the prophet the word come to listen the word can't come to Joshua that's right he couldn't do it it's got to come to Moses he was the major prophet of the hour amen see the word would never come to Joshua until Moses was gone now what come to Joshua Joshua's not listed as a prophet major Moses was the major that's why God told Joshua right off he said as I was with Moses I'll be with you you follow what Moses said to the letter and I'll back it up he didn't have to come with a new word then he started writing about what's taking place right he was writing what was taking place we went over here we done this we took care of that we you know I met this man over here he was writing those things that could be brought in to understand it but all that maybe remember was written by Moses thank you all right so follow what I'm saying Deuteronomy 18 15 raise up a prophet likened to me we're not talking about just a man we're talking about the God of the prophets the alive word Christ was the alive word spoken of in the book of Acts 3 in 20 and through 24 so read that and then we won't in the book of Acts you finally was at the burning bush all right I believe the one that came to John to tell him what to write was the Lord Jesus Christ and the form of the son of man the prophet right the son of man the prophet Amber what would it be all right okay it would be page 12 13 Church age book personally appearing to ascribe to write um that's number six on your notes I'm going on down yeah but I'm just trying to let me let me read a few things you can read the notes in between of how the Ephesus and the thing let's just jump on down because I'm going to be late anyway let's go down to number six on your notes that's where he said this is usually termed of revelation of Saint John but that is incorrect it is the revelation of Jesus Christ given to John for Christians of all ages the only book in the entire Bible that is written by Jesus himself though personally through personally appearing to a scribe that's the book huh we found out that brother Branham would be on Earth but the angel would come to him we found out that the seals couldn't be broke by that angel that come to him daily but it could be on the other me but see Revelations 1 I gave you a couple of quotes back Revelations 1 says one standing in the midst of the seven golden Candlestick like unto the son of man I didn't say it was the son of man this in Bride form it made it lie under the son of man that's why we turn out to be the son of man all right now I'm trying to jump over Feist so look at number seven on your notes he's talking about Revelations 113. who is he this is the revelation of Jesus Christ and here he's not a prophet here he is the almighty God manifested the Alpha and Omega so remember we went through those things number eight he said he's not a not a Prophet this was God in Revelations one all right let's see everybody wants to go on over to the other one and try to make it brother random we'll leave it like it is it was the prophet the Lord Jesus Christ all right now it was the son of man the word the word that came to the prophet that's what I'm being concerned about my brother right I'm coming to somebody else right right he didn't come to John to write the book that's what you'd be doing with if you ain't careful you're making him come to John on Patmos to write the book and then you're saying that well the reason I'm saying that is because if the word only comes to the prophet well let's read what your Prophet had to say about this that took place on Patmos all right and this is the quotes that they use to try to prove John come to and brother Brown come to John on Patton well let's just read it all right this is taken from the fifth seal 1963 322. all right which is Page 359. he's bringing down about it and all of the things that's taking place go back and read the background have you caught anything I've just wondered if you would see yes sir I might not have to tell you then Sunday notice notice wonderful now notice now and then according to the the time that God was going to deliver the Andalusian world he sent the eagle and the time he was going to deliver Israel sent the eagle a eagle a prophet right do you believe that the time even on John on the Isle of Patmos this message was so perfect that he couldn't trust it with an Angel they couldn't trust it with an Angel let that anchor into you you know an angel is is a messenger but you know the messenger was a prophet you believe that let's prove it revelation 22 let's see if it was an eagle see he was sure he was an angel he was a messenger but it was a prophet that revealed This Book of Revelations to him Revelation 22nd then he goes down bring go down to number 10 right 360. now this the book was so important that it is the word of God now watch and then the word of God is when the word of God is brought forward it's got to be brought by the prophet because that's who the word of God comes to I was expecting to get a question on that in this in this box here I thought I'd just beat them to it a little bit you know I just feel there is one in there though and so and so I I just thought I'd get to it see every word of God is brought the Bible doesn't change its system at all it's the same thing it's got to come to this Seer that we're expecting to arrive he said we'll run around and brother Dale that was him well why was he expecting him to arrive wow he was just saying that to throw you off no he's saying because it's true it's expecting it to arrive all right let's hold a second on the other all right let's take something that we've always tried to express and bring now how throughout this series and I'll end it with trying to say this brother Reynolds message is in two parts according to 327 Church age book this messenger Malachi 4 is going to do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers two reveal the seven Thunders which is revelation contained in the Seven Seals it'll be these to finally reveal mystery truth that literally turn our hearts back so his message in two parts you'll see what I've been driving out all along why that angel could bring brother Brown them up so far the angel that met him and was with him from the birth could bring him up tell him about serpent seed tell him about the great things but then when it comes to the opening of the seals he couldn't do that I run around and called him a minor angel that's what he called him even called it the healing angel because it was a healing campaign went out according to Malachi healing in his wings but when it comes down to bringing the seals he couldn't do it right you couldn't bring it but who brought it to him who come to brother Branham to reveal the seals you surely don't want his own theophany to come to him as or to something that would be making it something like that to come to him in that form the Lord Jesus Christ come to me he said that it was Christ it met him he said the Holy Ghost met him in the room he said those angels came to him daily and they were seven angels do you need me to bring them they were seven angels that he met out there in Tucson man and he said an angel come daily in the room then everybody's tried to make it then that would be brother branham's you know the theophany see why why not stay with yeah the simple things have just following along and letting it be whatever and then when we get there we'll find out what took place in all these places you know but to try to figure them out is not going to bring you Rapture in faith it's not going to bring you Rapture and Faith to pray to say that brother Branham come to to John on patch that's I'm going to bring Rapture and faith it's going to take a revelation of God's word huh sure they wrote a random you have to have to know this ministry that the I need him throughout 30 something years there 33. what really let him on his life was with him from birth but then that angel that brought around me said we're waiting on one to come and there come he said that's why I've always wondered about that seventh angel well he saw that he would have connection to that seventh angel because he was the seventh angel the Earthly Messenger as we read there a moment ago from the breach he was the Earthly messenger the angel right and God didn't come down out of heaven and blast it to the World Council of churches and let them print it into articles and say they heard a voice out of Heaven telling them what these things were oh that would be contrary to the Bible so he come to the prophet to where the Prophet could deliver it to you and I right because we'd have to have a prophet in our day and brother Brandon was born to prophet but now what about these quotes what about these what about the scripture that brought around them always read do the work of an evangelist he didn't call me an evangelist he said for me to do the work of an imagination why because the time would come that something would take place he said I knew all along this message would come I couldn't have to right right do the work of an evangelist all right look at it that's questions and answers in Jeff 19 and 62 527 some of you may have it cropped off the top okay paragraph or page 731. paragraph 731 . you don't like doing the work on Evangel he said it was laid in the Cornerstone now he never said you are an evangelist he said do the work of one now has the time come this is for the seals broke shall I continue on with that or has the time come for something else he said that I don't know and a lot of quotes run it into your computer about do the work of an evangelist and read all of them because then you're going down to spiritual food and do seeds in 1965 7-18 you bring it down he said I haven't had a prayer line of this type for a long long time Hemi remembers my commission when we built the Tabernacle here he said do the work of evangelists didn't say I was in the veins it said do the work of evangelists see for the hour will come when that's to be changed and that hour was arriving all right but the lord gave me what I should do in my message when he said do the work of an evangelist see he never went on down if you remember you go through and read all of those things became questions and answers on the seals 1963. now if you notice when I laid the Cornerstone under that Tabernacle he said do the work in evangelists and now the hour is coming when that work is separated there's something else taking place then I'm you see I get here and try to do evangelics and something else and you see where you're at he's expecting the church to be spiritual standing in the Gap 1963 623 the morning service do the work he was driving out and you know was sleeping Joseph or Billy Paul one got sleepy and he said return did I not tell you in the beginning do the work of an evangelist when I called you down on the river did not I say as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the first coming wasn't John more than a prophet Jesus said what it would have to do a prophet more than a profit through the work of an evangelist action that's where you divide brother Brown's Ministry but the first part just turned the hearts of the children back to the faith of the fathers that's quoting 3 27. he had to come to restore the original Doctrine back not at the Bible changed no the Bible always taught one God the Bible always taught water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ but we self-interpreted those things and made it wrong the prophet had to come to interpret those things and that's what that angel on Earth was doing he was the seventh Church age messenger right but he said if you make me the angel to lady osia he said you've messed it up why because it's got to go into a greater thing right and remember that there's eight churches Messengers not just seven oh yeah but there's just seven men but eight manifestations of God brother random 464 the seal book he tells you about what's to happen that how that this messenger wanted to do he said he calls him the prophet to come on nocturnal in Azusa Street he said but at the end the messenger would come see that Prophet that came in Azusa Street was the baptism of the Holy Ghost that stepped right over and brother Branham and began to carry on and bringing forth the first part of his ministry do the work of an evangelist because there'll come a time when you won't be doing the work of an evangelist you'll take the office of the prophet he stepped right into the office of the prophet in 1963 with the opening of the seals and from thereafter he was doing those things he would back up into it and use those gifts and do the different thing but he said that wasn't right but it was to help the people to get them to believe showing debate on the hook you know but we're supposed to believe the word to start with we're supposed to take what the word says so he was doing the work of an evangelist until that Mighty Angel met him on the out there in Tucson Arizona and they didn't tell him a thing out there if you want to read it that's what everybody says they took him up into this and told him it's not in the other day now you don't have no quotes for that the Angels told him it's a message the prophet said the angel told him to come home it would be told him right they didn't tell him anything out there like that about what the seals were because he'd be a liar because he'd come over to the first seal and said I don't know what it is in the breaching time if they told him what it was out there but they took him up into it sure I'm sure they told him some things that's right not for you and me to know and just getting the point there were seven angels that he met out there and everybody's wanted to make it Church age Messengers and things like that why well what that was was Luther's theophany Wesley's theophany so until why that's right what profit is that I want to know what they told him right show angel number one come to John and told him he had to crash me Angel Number Two come told him about the second seal third fourth fifth sixth and see then he would be connected to all of it understand what the angel would come to him which would be the Lord Jesus Christ come into the prophet to tell him what that Sabbath seal was and I were tired of his life and what was taking place and that would be the one that John would fall down to worship with that when it was all finished was the Lord Jesus Christ amen but you see people want to go that way and they don't want to finish up with the message run around and say it what so we hear that like 20 in our last night how come there's also many different doctrines over one message you know amen like how many doctrines are they about the Bible well are we going to heaven like he was saying is he asked that man when you get to heaven it's going to be a little place over here that the badges live a little place over here the master just live and a little place over here the Presbyterians live and then we hear the Pentecostals live you know because they're all split up okay no no brother then we don't believe that there's gonna be two Soul holes seventh under a virtual I don't mean hole excuse me seven Thunder virtual places and there's gonna be all kind of places I don't see it that way we don't all understand the same thing but we understand the Lord Jesus Christ all right but the prophet said what questions and answers 64 8 23 the perfect interpretation of the word of God with Divine vindication perfect interpretation of the word with Divine vindication and that which is in part is done away when I was a child I was thinking that child not just part like going away with the word not doing away with our part perfect interpretation has come to the Bride of Jesus Christ you know Wise come to the Bride of Jesus Christ because she's got a job to do it well we get all of this and we see brother Branham is that going to come to the iron with us that's all right that's gone whatever you're doing cool if that's all you got to hold on to I don't want to destroy you if all you got to hold on to is what you believe is a Baptist I don't want to destroy Madness because if you kill a man's Doctrine you kill a man you say well I want to destroy everything I can well there's something wrong with you I'm going to do what you want to here's the things they don't want to hear you say because you see we have to be the word My Flesh we have to take what the prophet said and become the word made flesh which will be these on a man the Lord Jesus Christ in his bride and then we are to vindicate bless God brother Branham was Vindicated amen nobody's going to argue me can't argue with you about it I know God Vindicated him but I know what he said don't get mad at brother random what he says here what we're fixing to read they get mad at you for finding it all right smart really well cold right around I'm smart at it I'm gonna run around and said in the message what sitting on an hour with the like 1965-18 he's talking about how that it's come forward now here's the secret of the message he said it must be about my father's business um let's go back let's just read the whole thing I'm doing pretty good notice there will be no more carrier mother Church's denominations after this carrier shook because after the shut there's no more there's nothing left but them and just the grain is that right got to be the grain it's got to be the same kind that went into the ground Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a Spirit come up on the bride to do the same things that he did it's through reproducing again of the grain the word yet young spoke for itself you remember what happened in no not that I must be about my father's business 12 years old 13 whatever he was listen there's the secret of the message now just like the father's business what is the father's business could you think of what the father's business was to him to fulfill what Isaiah said a virgin shall conceive fulfill what Isaiah said again the lame shall leak like a heart and all of these things that it take place like Moses said the Lord your God shall raise up a prophet among you like it unto me it was the father's business to fulfill that word well if that come down through them stalks of them Natural Women what about these stalks of these Spiritual Church women churches means women women means churches really is that right then what is it now we must be about the father's business the crew we would cry back the grain yes sir we must what must I do vindicate Malachi forward vindicate Luke 17 30. vindicate Hebrews 13 8 vindicate Saint John 14 12. vindicate all of his word vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelation the 10th chapter on the opening of The Seven Seals and the mysteries of God even to serpent seed and all that would be manifested marriage and divorce and all of these other Mysteries that's been hid under the pillars from from all these years from the theologians and so forth but it's now the hour that's the father's business the and we must be about the father's business but brother Dale I don't see how in the world we can vindicate Malachi 4. well I do very easily because Malachi forces him turn the harness of the children back to the faith of the fathers that's our part right Luke 17 30. well that's brother Branham and today when the son of man is revealed I believe the Bride of Jesus Christ is the son of man brother random was Ace on a man vindicate Hebrews 13 8 making him the same yesterday today and forever right vindicate Saint John 14 12. vindicate all of his words vindicate Hebrews I mean Revelations the 10th chapter we've got to vindicate that right but now brother Daniel well you know well it's set in the mouth to two or three businesses invisible Union of the bride of Christ 1965-11-25. we're just ready for one thing that's the coming of the Lord there's your name on The Book of Life and the Book of Life is the word of God because the word is God and God is the only thing that's life your name was represented in the Bible before the Bible became on Word and if you're and if you're here to do that won't it vindicate that worked won't the church vindicate itself vindicate Malachi 4 and all of these other things perfectly perfectly vindicate itself and show that that's what it is but you see probably when I said that while ago about we've got to vindicate probably the computers went quick and they cut off you know people quit listening to you but that's what brother random said well brother Dale so you must be greater than him if you know how to straighten him out if you know how to straighten bread around them out you must be almighty God because that's the only step up above a Vindicated prophet that way but you see you just get upset with me for being that way to say it but why not say it I had a dream the other night I told my wife about it in the dream I wasn't hateful with the person I was just straight blunt plain and blunt that's the way it ought to be I'm gonna be that way plain and blunt you know you don't have to sugarcoat it to me you don't have to come around to just come up walk up say brother Dale I want to talk to you I think you're off the word you know I'm not going to slap you beat you around I'm going to sit down and listen to you and I'm not going to argue with you why are you doing it this way you know and if what you're saying is right then I even repent you know try and be helped I don't want to be right but if it ain't right then I won't tell you don't agree with you why because I believe we're in the end time if the bride of Christ is to be the son of man then she's not going to be deceived right that's right I cut out a lot of it you know in the notes what I had to say and but just think on this I hope you understand I'm going to say it one more time because Hebrews 1 says that in the last days he'd speak right my son all right his son is the word I believe that's what's happened unto us I believe that the Lord Jesus Christ the son of the Living God Matt brought around him in 1963. and broke those seals to him and told him what they were you couldn't trust it remember we read that quote you couldn't trust it with an Angel right so brother random in his ministry up until 63 couldn't be trusted with the revelation of those seals now where did he say that at okay that's what brother Dale said what do you say yeah what do you have to say about it at least I've endeavored to try to express it well I just don't want to get in them deep things beware of them this that this person's got all the answers I've only told you I didn't have them I just depend on somebody else but I've gone to phrase to go with that one beware of them that don't know nothing of what's going on in this message well that's Stacy you know let's just stay simple now brother run around come to John on Patmos that's just simple now you show me in the message where he said he did I go back to you show me the message where he said he did well which one there's five times which one would it have been but you see we think we've got a great revelation of something when it doesn't pan out I want the revelation of the Lord Jesus Christ and what he's got to do with me and to give me Rapture and faith to get out of here we're going to have an eternity to sit down and talk about all of the things that we went through here up on Earth and you know I won't mind saying then I'm wrong just as much as I'd say now I'm wrong but I want you to show me all right I just want you to show me well you just won't listen well okay and that proves I'm lost but you see I believe the Lord Jesus Christ come to John on Patmos and told him about the Book of Revelations you know in the writing told him what to write right yes told him what to write they're in the Book of Revelation now you understand what I'm saying the Bible the Book of Revelation the Lord Jesus Christ come to John to tell him what to write and I believe that same Lord Jesus Christ has to come in the end time okay to reveal the Book of Revelation and show us our part amen right let's Stand Together come on musicians I thought I'd be real long this evening I just cut out all I had to say about it so I was just reading I pray that God will help us to understand you know I could spend more months and months preaching on the Book of Revelations but the last thing I'll say we as brother run said the bride goes up Revelation 4 1 from 1941 to 1921 is to Israel and the things you know taking place upon the Earth so then it's not important to understand when Armageddon is going to be I want to know about the spiritual application of it taking place in my life all right I don't care about the tribulation because I don't want that I don't care about the white Throne judgment because I'm going to get to sit on it with him but I leave one thing with you that I've made over and over and over that in the Book of Revelation is the book only book in the Bible that you can find yourself so personally with it that you can't argue the point that's talking about you because Jesus is not shown in the Book of Revelations anywhere by himself he's always shown with somebody because that's what he always wanted right you always wanted what do we got 290 290 in the red book anybody have a name predestination hope I can get it done in a couple of messages no we're Eternal people anyway all to thee my blessings All to Jesus I Surrender on the edge what all forsaken take me let your desire we're all wrong the revelation of one true and living God so that's the whole Mountain oh Holy Spirit Brother Gary he's having problems with his feet and all not able to be with us today so just remember him oh I ain't surrender the Lord are you doing on the way home today Janet and the kids coming back in remember them all right I should River memorize surrender on All to Jesus my friend friendly great place in person that will yield their self to him well you know he said well okay now our brother colleagues you know ain't none of us got no problem no no that wasn't what he said well brother Branham was the only one that reeled himself to God so the rest of us not that wasn't what he was saying we are individuals in the body of Christ right each individual ought to believe that we are the one that he's talking about that can yield ourselves to him and they can use us because if not we might as well just shut the doors and go home and forget about it that's right but if you can believe you're the only one our Dr Prophet said if they wouldn't but one going into rapture I think he said out of a state didn't he one going well I'm sorry the rest of y'all got a problem you better find you another state and there's not enough States even though Obama's tried to make 57 there's not enough States for these people here in the building because there's more in 57 here but you see he's saying we got to believe we are that one that's right behold I send you Elijah the prophet I believe that's to me amen sister media I reckon when that was the scripture God gave her behold I send you Elijah and she knew to get married to him you know well if that was personal to her what about being personal to you and I just remember these things father we pray that the things that we said today would be talks that would be vital to our understanding I know sometimes is when we try to talk it's just sounds like we're just veins angling but we're not Lord we're talking about you but we give all the honor and Glory To You Lord no matter what it would be of who angels are and where they'd appear and what would take place all of the honor and glory is given unto you goes without you there wouldn't be any angels and wouldn't be any people just have your way with us Lord if we bring this series to a close maybe remember the words of this prophecy may we remember the things that we've heard about you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen you're dismissed pray one for another I have decided to follow Jesus please I'm sure foreign foreign
