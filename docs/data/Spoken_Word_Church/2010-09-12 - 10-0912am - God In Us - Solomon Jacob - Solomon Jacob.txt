nice to be in the house of the Lord because he is good to us and he always has a blessings for us because all the curse has been always already taken care of and has been nailed on the cross and so now no more we are under curse but we live under the blessings of the Living God and it's so good to know the Living God Amen till the age of 25 I never I never knew Jesus as my personal savior or my personal Lord I knew him that he is my God and he is the place of worship that I I should go and worship because I was brought up in a family of my father being a Jew and my mother being a Indian Christian and in that atmosphere I was brought up I always had a fear of God in my heart amen and I used to go to church with my mother and at the same time on Sabbat us to have a prayer at home Sabbat prayer with my father and this was the way that I was brought up but never had a real relation with the Lord Jesus but it so happened in my city during 1972 and 73 that there was a great moo of of the holy spirit in my place amen there was no Pentecostal preacher or there was no Pentecostal Mission or nothing kind of that but just the brothers and sisters got together to pray together and the spirit of God just fell upon them and it's so did happen that we saw the many the lives of many people being changed and I saw them I met them they were my friends they were the people who used to go with me to the church and I saw these people being change and that attracted me many times and one day they invited me to come over to the prayer in their house there so I went there and spend a time there and when I nailed down with them in a prayer and I started to pray and all of a sudden then I felt in the spirit of the Lord that something has just come upon me am and I started to confess my sin and I I started to call upon the Lord that Lord forgive me amen and by the blood of your on the cross that you shed for me that you can uh you can remove all these sins from my life and then the Lord just pour on his Spirit upon me and I also started to speak in tongues and praise God and that continued for hours on that night and that was the first experience that I had with the Lord Jesus Christ am and since then I received him as my personal SA Savior and my Lord and it has been so good from that time that my life was changed but that time I was a professional soccer player in India and I used to play for the clubs and the and the teams there in India and that was my life so before this thing could happen in the year 1969 there was a great call from Israel to call all their people back to the land of Israel and they had they had a big war with all the Muslim nations and because they lost many ones in that war the Israel government had sent the call throughout their Jewish agencies around the world that they want their people to come back to Israel so my father he got that news and he decided to move to Israel that was in 1969 so he asked my mother and me also that would you like to go with us so my mother uh she refused on certain things because our education my elder sister was going under education my younger sister was going under education and I was just a professional soccer so I thought that I will come to a certain level higher level in in India and then I will go so I told my father that I will wait for a few more years and then I'll will come to Israel but I my other family we had I had two mothers that step mother and uh from them they had the three brothers and three sisters they were all Jews my another mother that's the sa mother was a Jew so they decided to go to Israel so they left in 1969 and they went to Israel so we we stayed back and that's how I felt the Lord had a plan for me that I come to the Lord in 72 that was 3 years after my father left to Israel and he went there so I was playing for the uh big clubs there in India but Lord as Lord wanted me to get him and to serve him that one day while playing I had an injury on my left knee and uh the all the ligaments in that left knee were damaged and I had to come back home and I was was put in the plaster my and then when I come back home I got back The Fellowship of the Brethren who were were all praying together and I come in there and then I invited them to come my place and I I gave them a room that we all could to come together and pray together and we just started praying praying and praying there so after a week or so it so happened that while we were praying that same day there on that day I felt again the power of God come upon me and I feel that Lord has touched my knee and my knee is healed so I called my elder sister she was a doctor and I told her to open the plaster but she refused and she said no you will have to again go into the plaster I said no I said the Lord has healed me you just open the plaster and she opened the plaster and praise God that my knee was healed and and and just walking and and and after that I prayed I played for a while but that was not the will of the Lord for me to do so in first January 19 uh 73 I dedicated myself in the hands of the Lord for the ministry and that time I was just new I didn't know the Bible I know didn't know the books I didn't know anything of it I didn't know any teachings of any any Mission or denomination or anything I just knew that there are churches and that time we were going to the Christian and Missionary Alliance Church in my place so that was the church there I to go but I never knew the teaching of Trinity or anything but when I started to preach I started to preach that there is only one God Amen I started to preach that how the Lord God has come down and and being in Jesus and revealed to us and has saved us and when I started to preach people started to uh to blame me to call me as Jesus only man yeah I didn't know what was that and that time I it was just new and strange to me but still I continued and then when I started to continue many people left me yeah and I continued to preach the gospel I went lot of places I went in the tribal area I went in the Village area different area and that time I preach in thousands of people and baptize hundreds of them but that time I baptized them in the name of Father Son and the Holy Ghost because I didn't knew uh the more uh things about it but as the people were baptized so I baptized the people then it so happened that during one of the meetings that we had one Pentecostal preacher was there and he handed me over the book the exposition of the seven Church ages and I got that book and he said you like to read this book you read this book because he he of course later on that I came to know that he accepted the message and the prophet but later on he denied it so he gave that book to me and I started reading that book and when I went through few pages and I realized that the the the message that about the godhe which I was preaching was right in this book and it was a confirmation and I thank God for that and I like that book and in so much that I started reading and reading that book and there the Lord revealed to me that the baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so that was that so I got it I tried to speak to the people uh but they don't want to listen because they all believed that the baptism should be in Trinity so when I read that book I got to know through that book the address of Jefferson will so I wrote them back that I wanted to know more about this Prophet about this messenger and his messages and so so they diverted me to brother Charles SAS uh his his church was in Lauren ho oav and his son Randy S I think is's a pastoring the church there now still so he was a missionary down in India that time so I called him and he says Brother come on he says come up so I went to Madras from my place about a night oright Journey from my place I met them him and his wife they were there and I spent about a week with them and we shared a lot of things through the book and through the prophet's messages and he told me many more things and that enlightened me and he gave me the first CD of brother bram's message was to the looking to the Unseen amen and that message I got and I heard that message came back home and it was a great blessing for me and since then I tried to move forward and forward and then this the Revelation which I had got and the Lord has blessed and opened my eyes to receive this Revelation I shared this good Tiding with my brothers and the the brothers which were I used to fellowship with in Bombay so I I told them that brother this is what the Lord has given to me and and you listen and you read it so I played the tape the looking to the Unseen to those brothers and I I showed them the book this exposition of seven Church ages and then we sat together and you know we looked into the scriptures and that's what and then we try to find out that if there are many other brothers of this faith and there we come to know that there are few Brothers in Bombay and then we got in touch with them then the brothers in Bombay were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then I was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then I baptized my wife my mother and my sister in the family and this way the Lord started to work in in my place and there was a great blessing I moved in Bombay started to preach and to go among those brothers who already were there but that was the time they were lying low they were not sharing this message to others it was not like like coming out but we went there and the Lord really blessed and now you can see in Bombay that there are many groups come up in there and those preachers those Brothers whom I introduced this message are now preaching uh the word of God and now are pastoring the many churches down there am so that was how the Lord blessed me and brought me to the knowledge of this message and the prophet and we started to minister in India and the Lord used Us in different places and by God's grace we have good uh six uh churches that we that I Minister among the people and go my Ministry actually is is not a pastoral Ministry I don't Pastor a church as as a pastor but we go I go out and we hold meetings in different places and when the people come out from that place we bring them together and we we just make them to come at a certain place or any any brother's house so that they can come and worship together and there that's the church and then we appoint a brother that we could see that Lord is leading him to have that P pastoral uh uh commission so then we lay our hands on that brother and we give him that church and then like that we move in different places we preach and we teach and bring the people to the knowledge of Christ and to this message and we had the Lord had given to me uh a great opportunity to establish lot of churches now those churches now we gave it to the brothers and they are pastoring those churches but at present I'm having six churches that I go around and minister to those brothers that we already have a pastors to minister to them people and I've given um brother d uh a DVD of our uh Clips uh of our ministry in India and it will be a great blessing if you watch those uh Clips you know and that can give you an idea that how the Lord is using Us in India to put forth the Gospel of Jesus Christ and the message of this hour to bring his bride to or to make his bride ready to meet the Lord Jesus Christ amen her bridegroom amen and it was a great blessing for us and the Lord has been a great a very great uh graceful unto us that we could do these things but then we moved forward in the the about in the in the end of' 70s that is 7879 one brother Shiva tiari from an oror Michigan in the message came to us to India and he was from an oror and when he came to India he ministered in the churches and he ministered for us and we took him around in different places and I interpreted for him from English to Indian languages and it was a great blessing and then I shared to him that brother I'm going to visit my father after many many years because when dad left 69 we never had had an opportunity to meet him neither he could come back neither I could go there so now the time was there so I was prepared I was I come to the Lord Jesus Christ I accepted him as my savior and now here I was in the message of the hour so everything was just ready so I told Brother Shiva that ID like to come because if I pay uh my air ticket to Israel on the same payment I can come to States because that time it was uh the one ticket that you can byy and you can go to these two places so he said he said brother okay you I'll make the arrangements so he sponsored me he SP he sent the all the documents for me and by God's great I got the Visa and I had no problem to you know to prove anything they didn't ask me they just asked me what where are you going I said I'm going to attend the church meetings and I'm going to be with the church people and I'm going to have a a Ministry there and he just okay never ask me what you have in what is what property or bank balance or this or that nothing in the very first stroke I got the Visa and I came in 81 I came to brother Samuel Johnson's camp meeting that was my first trip to the United State States and to meet the brothers and it was a great blessing there I I met all the precious brother there I met edus skill I met I met brother hband that time in that meeting and all other brothers and I listen to them and and they shared all their testimonies about the prophet and it was a great blessing to me amen but the great blessing came to me through a man called brother James Humes yeah brother Tim Humes father he was there in that camp meeting and we got uh to know each other there and he says he says brother would you like to come down to Jeffersonville I'll take you there and there you can see uh brandham Tabernacle and you can see the spoken word public ation and all other things and you can visit brother bram's tomb also I said okay that's very fine so I went with him and we drove together from there to scotsburg Indiana where he used to live and I stayed with him and that was the first American family and the American home that I lived in and since then that home has become a my my home my and that family became my family Amen brother Humes and Mom Humes they started calling me their one of their son amen and I was the oldest in in the age so they call me the oldest son of their family so I got that right that privilege to be called their son and all them all the brothers brother t uh brother team's brother brother Joe Jimmy and Mark and all those and even the sisters I knew them thoroughly I knew them very well I stayed with them and it was kind of like just one family amen and it was a great blessing for me brother hes took me around took me around many places he took me around Jeffersonville and make help me to visit all those places and then he had made an appointment for me to meet uh Joseph uh brandham and it was a great blessing to me so that's how that I come to know the different brothers and different churches and then uh I had a very great privilege to be with brother Wilson Henry in Atlanta and he was the one of the brother that really helped us to establish a tap Ministry in India every time I come from that that uh 1981 he used to give me 50 60 messages of brother brandham on tape and I us to take back them to India and then on the third trip when I was here he bought for me a copying machine that cassette to cassette and it was a pentagon machine a very good you know hard machine and he gave it to me and he said brother you take this machine back to India I took that back to India I had a very hard time to get that machine in India through the customs and know I had to fight for that but they made me to pay the Customs heavily on that I said okay nothing to be worried it's for the glory of the Lord so I brought that machine home and we started the tape Ministry in India before anyone could start a tape Ministry in India by God's grace we started we published out a catalog of the cassets that I had with me I had that library with me and we sent it out to the Brethren and we started to distribute the messages of brother Branham in English and it went for a year for five a few years that we continued that Ministry but the L on that because of the uh lack of finances we could not uh do that Ministry forever and then we had that machine also uh stopped working properly and nobody could repair those machine because in those days in India it was not so Advanced on the things so we had to then dump that the whole thing off but by God's grace whatever the Lord has given us that portion we could I know serve the Lord in that manner and preach the word and distribute the books and distribute the tapes and cassettes so it was like that the Lord was leading us to certain levels then after I came to USA from uh states to from 81 to 87 and 88 then from there onwards I stopped coming to States and I stayed back in India and I was doing the ministry in India brother Humes came to India twice and once he came to us and ministered and he couldn't Minister but he was with us and there we I met him during that period but but the whole family I could meet from uh 1981 uh 80 8788 till this this day so it was we we were going through the ministry and we were been greatly blessed in 2002 my son I have three sons and one daughter so three of my sons they decided to move to Israel because I don't know what made them to take this decision they took this decision without asking me when they went and took the forms from the Jewish agency then only they told me that they they fill the forms they were in Bombay my two sons also were uh uh professional soccer players and they were playing in in the city of Bombay that's a big city and you know in the big cities they have the big teams and they were paid well but they decided to move to Israel and they filled up the form and my sisters my dad was already uh died in 1997 so my uh so my other mother was also dead so now my sisters were there my brothers were there so we send the forms in and they certified it and they they said yes the these boys are the uh sons of our brother and they scrutinized the whole thing up and they found that that these are the children of the Jewish grandfather so according to their law of written and uh uh their resolution they passed everything everything and they allowed my sons to come to Israel and the government of Israel sent their tickets they sent their visa everything was just sent by the government of India we didn't have to pay any money and everything just boys went on 14th of March 2002 to Israel that was another move in my family the Lord had made it and we didn't know that time that why the Lord has done this then these boys were there they they were sent to the school to learn the Hebrew language and they learned the Hebrew language well and they can now very well speak and and write Hindu Hebrew language and they are well in that so they were there and they were in in the that is called Ulan that Hebrew school that they go to and they come out of that and they they were in the uh regular life but then they will call they were called for army training because in Israel every boy and a girl after the age of 18 has to serve an army training and they were called for the army training two boys younger boys that the middle one and the last the boy youngest boy they were called for the regular army training that was 2 and a half year training for them my oldest son as he was little above the age and his qualification was a little higher as he was doing his do doctorate in chemistry there so they gave him six-month Army but these two boys were in a regular army and these boys they come in Israel they didn't come as a Jew they come in as a Christian and that testimony they all always kept with them amen they never denied they never claimed but they always proved to the people that they believed Jesus as the Messiah right that their Messiah is yua right and during their life and even during their training when they were in the army they always used to pray because that's how we had brought them up and we have given that teaching and they have learn in their heart that Jesus is their lord and that's to whom to pray and they every time they pray to him they committed their lives into the hands they read the Bible in the morning they they pray and read the Bible in the in the in the dining hall when they go all with along the Jewish soldiers around them all the Jewish soldiers were there they took the bread break pray it break it and then eat in the night they pray before they go to bed so this prayer life those people had seen them and not only those but the officers also knew that these boys are not Jew but are Christians right and that was a great example for them amen because hardly Hallelujah I mean I mean in a very rare rare to rare case there was any Christian man in the army of Israel come on very rare I I I didn't know that's very rare case and that's how they were they looked in but in the training God had just blessed them amen when they left India I told them that sons that you are going to Israel I know this is a Strange Land for you it's going to be a strange language for you but God is with you amen and not only God is with you but God has blessed you twice Hallelujah the people in Israel are blessed ones that's a physical blessing from Abraham but now you are going to Israel with double blessing come on that the blessing that's a physical blessing and then the second blessing to recognize Jesus as the Messiah is the Satan that's a spiritual blessing the Lord has blessed you and God will always make you head and not the tail right and they believed on it and they took that word and always prayed God and during that whole course of their training these boys were the first among among the all the other soldiers my second son he was in the paratrooper training and the the youngest son Abraham he was on the field intelligence that they they that he works for the intelligence but not in the in the country but on on the war zones he works in those areas so he know he has to look for the enemy look for the spots find out the things from where the enemy is coming and and all sort of those things so he was put up in that and this son the second son was in a paratrooper and during his training Lord has wonderfully blessed him and Lord not only that that but the Lord Has Done miracles in his life and shown to the people that he was the the believer that he believed in Jesus as the Messiah one time while having his training he was in the plane and they they were to paradrop in them and he they had to jump out of the plane to have the parachutes training and they gave them a spot where they should land because they can't go anywhere just like because they are they are if they are on a mission they are given a place that they should land on that place and from there they go on the mission so they were on the training so he jumped out and when he jumped out behind him another Soldier jumped out and when they jump the both they jumped out their parachutes entangled together and the those parachute didn't open the even their emergency they have another parachute that's with tuck with them they tried to open that parachute and that also didn't work work and they just were come down just like just like a rock and those officers who were watching them through the binoculars and they saw these two boys coming down and their parachute didn't open so they made the siren to and call the ambulance and they had their all the Jeeps run to that place where they were supposed to land and they all all ran to that place and these boys were coming down down like a rock and these officers thought these two boys must have been killed or they must have a great injury must have broken their bones or heads or anything that can happen to them and they went they went there they saw these two boys standing on their feet it was a great miracle and really it was a great blessing for him and when he come there thank you Lord he come there there was two the officers come there these two boys were standing on their feet and they were just shocked to see those the boys alive right and the officer came and he said I want to tell you one thing he said you are saved because you pray to God right and that God whom you praise has saved you come on Amen and not only you but Lord has spared the life of the soldier which was with you right so that was the testimony his officers gave in that time Hallelujah so it was a great testimony that they could bring about the Messiah that whom these people denied but these boys received as their Messiah amen and then when his training was over and the camping ceremony come up my dear friends I want to tell you he was aded the best soldier of his company Hallelujah he was brought before the whole company having those commanders standing I was in that camping ceremony and I had that great opportunity to witness that and the gave him that honor Hallelujah and my heart was just filled with great joy and thanks unto the Lord that Lord see all those boys born in Israel brought up in Israel and their body structure and their everything was different but these boys were trained in India for hardship right of the life they gone through the hardship of their life they were soccer player you know good and everything and you know it's it's so good you know the Lord just blessed them amen and when the capping ceremony come up I was there and he was uh he was waiting he he knew in his heart that he was going to be the best carot of this whole company oh my and he was waiting his name to be called and they called from the bottom level you know like from this from this you know and and he thought that my they did something wrong with me because I am a Christian yeah yeah you know that thought came to his heart he told me later on because his name was not pronounced and they were calling but they were calling from the bottom level then to the higher level and then at the last they called his name Hallelujah and that you know that's he was filled with great joy I could see him running down from his place where he was standing in the Scout you know in the whole that company there and he came running and he was right before the Commandment commandant and and he kept him as the best soldier of the company Hallelujah so that's how the Lord has blessed these boys and it was a great blessing for them lord always was with them one time as brother said that there were at at the Gate of the Israelis and the Palestinians yeah and that gate so there are soldiers that stand there that those uh they allow them the Philistines to come in so before that they check them and everything you know there is a security so one time my son was on the duty as a security in those places and when he was there on the duty and his time was over so he left that place and he just walked one or two steps away from his place where he was standing and uh and guarding that place at gate so one girl came in from there a young girl came in from the Philistine area and she came in and the other boy who took over my son was standing there as a God and she talked to him and wanted to come in so he tried to open the door and while he opened the door to check her on the same instance she attacked that that soldier with with a knife and she stabbed him immediately my son rushed back and they took the control of that girl but that boy was stabbed so that would have been my son you know but Lord knew and the Lord just brought him out from that place in in the in the moment of time so these are the things the Lord Has Done in the lives of my boys but the very need that they had in their life was not made in there right because there they were by themselves they had no Fellowship they tried to go to The Fellowship of the Jewish congregation the messic congregation they have in Israel so they went there but my my ear son was one of the trustees also in that Jewish congregation for a long time but they felt out of spirit in those places right they couldn't match to them right and there was something that always they failed in their heart that they cannot stay here and so they came back and they said Dad we no more can go in those fellowships because we don't find ourself feeding in those people so they came out and they they were at home and they just started to pray at home and that's that's that's that's all then they had no Fellowship so then we decided that we also should move to Israel because in that way we can bring the whole family together because these three boys were in Israel and me my wife and my youngest daughter she was in India so we decided to move and last year in the month of March my daughter she moved to Israel and then in the month of September me and my wife moved to Israel so everything was paid by the government of Israel they took us into into the country and the day we landed in the country on the airport we got our citizenship on the same moment we entered there they gave us the citizenship and then we had all all the rights as a citizen of Israel we have the ID cards of Israel we have the passport of Israel and everything was just blessed so that time I never realized that why the Lord has brought us together but only the thought was in my heart that let's go together as a and stay there as a family let there you know my Lord had blessed us with our with granddaughter so she was already staying with her you know and then she was staying there as as a tourist not as a citizen so she had a problem with medical care insurance and everything so then we decided let's go there as a citizen and we come up there as a citizen so now we had all the rights there so she lived in there but I lived very far for a very few days few months in there because I us to go back to India and then we come in last September and then I went back to India in the month of February and from February I stayed in India up to June ministering the word of God and we had very good meetings in those places during this last year and few of the meetings are there in the clips there you can see and by God's grace the Lord opened uh denomination Church a Presbyterian Church for us to preach in there and we had been waiting for last many many years I think it's been since 1982 I'm holding the meetings in that City and Lord just opened this year the the hearts and the doors of the denomination church and the pastor opened his door and we were working on that Pastor from a few few years and this time he opened the door and we had an opportunity to preach the truth right openly without keeping anything in our heart we just you know just preach to them that where they are and what is the true word of God and revealed to this this generation and we told revealed to them spoke to them through the word that all that you believe the Trinity and the baptism and all other things are from the idol worshippers right it's not from the word of God but whatever you do is you're doing the idol worship the god God is the only God there is no two God or no three Gods but there is only one God that's right and we preach to them and they were blessed and they are working on those thoughts and those what we preach to them and they decided that when I go back in the month of December they're going to hold 3 days Bible study and calling they're going to call all other denomination people which are in that area to come together and to hear the truth hallu so that was the greatest opening you'll see in in that DVD that's a big church is there with a big cross on the church in the inside there all the pews and everything that you will watch there that's that is the Presbyterian Church that the lord gave us to preach and we had a wonderful time there and while I was there in that time that the Lord just put a thought in my heart and I was thinking that why I'm am there in Israel why my family is there in Israel and then the thought the Lord just opened my mind and thought that lord said that there you are as my church as my people you see the people who believe the true word of God the people who are anointed with that spirit that has the true word amen in the past days there were people from United States that went over to Israel and try to do some work come on but they had very limited area has to work because they didn't have the citizenship they have they were there on a tourist visa come on and every time they had to go and to renew their visas and it was a problem for them they worked there in a in a p in a private hospital but then they had to come back and to leave Israel and they couldn't do too much of a thing there and there is one family I believe still there whom I contacted them a long back and I asked them that brother my son there and they are without Fellowship so I would like to uh lead them to you or to any brothers that are in the message in Israel right and that brother wrote send a replied my mail and he said brother he says there is no uh message church here in the in Israel and there are no not too many uh families in here that believe this message but we are the one that left here and we are too far from your place and he says it it will be better for your children to to go to a place where they worship Jesus Christ as their Lord amen I said I said I can't s there are the boys already had their uh experience with those churches and those people right I said no okay I said I didn't reply that brother anything I said okay so the Lord just put that thought in my heart now he says you are as a family there and you are there as a citizens of Israel right and you are living that there with all your rights now you are in Israeli you're having all the rights and now he says the Lord show that you are the bride of Christ the church that believes the true word amen the true the scripture the Revelation the true word which has been preached by Paul and laid that Foundation right and now here comes the prophet and brought us back to that Foundation that's right and when we are there on that laying on that Foundation the Lord opened my eyes and he says look there is no church which is laid on that true foundation there are Pentecostals there are different denominations and all of churches are there even the messan congregation but they are not based on the foundation or on the word which is Jesus Christ that's right amen they have different preachings different teachings but the true church was not there and the Lord said that I brought you now here because you are the true church amen you are the part of that body of Christ That was supposed to come up in Israel so now we are citizens of Israel we have all the rights of Israel and the Lord says that as the the gospel has come out from Jerusalem and from Israel and preach among all the nations that has to come back to Israel right not to the 1 lak 144,000 mhm no that's that's not the bride right that's not the bride that's a different uh different they are in different age they have different preacher different Prophet that's not our age but as a bride of Christ Glory as the church we are there and the Lord says that that body of Christ of that faith of the Apostles and the prophet has to come back to Israel right there has to be a a body that believes the gospel the true gospel which is found founded on the prophets and the apostles with the revelation of the message that the Lord has given us in this last days so that church has to be there maybe few maybe five maybe 10 right that's not it's counted it's the body laid on the foundation of the prophet and turn their hearts to their fathers right so that body has to be there right and then the Lord just opened my mind and I said now this is what the Lord has brought us here amen that's how I when I look back that's how the Lord I said that L Lord you left me without father in the land of India and I lived there and in just after 3 years I received the Lord then in 75 I received the message and now here I am with the full understand understanding of the word and and the message and now the Lord has brought us together in the land of Israel so by God's grace my dear friends we wish to start a small group in in Israel now there are hundreds of Indian people that come to work in in India as a laborers in the fields and as a caregivers and some other things and many of them are Christians they are denominations they they they are they are from the denomination churches but they are Christians and they don't go to any church because I that's been preached in Hebrew or that's preach in English or that's preach in French and and any other languages or maybe together that's what the fellowship the the Jewish fellowships are there but if I let this word not out to the people giving them hand bills and different things and contact those people so those Indian people I can bring them by God's Grace and the leading of the Holy Spirit Come Together to worship with us in an Indian language right in the language of their own right and that can be a great attraction for them to come and to Worship the Lord in a place and then when they come there then we can share this message the gospel of the hour the message of the hour and that's how the Lord can give them an opportunity which they might not have received this opportunity in their land exactly because if you look to Trinidad if you look to Guyana and all those places those people now are Christians but if you go back their forefathers were Hindus in the land of India when they come from India the when the British government brought them from India they were all Hindus they worshiped different gods but now they got an opportunity to hear the Gospel of Jesus Christ and they received him and now they they have opportunity to receive the message and now there are people hundreds of them those Hindu oriented people believed on the gospel believed on the message and they have a church here amen bless so that's how the Lord can lead us to those people amen and not only that we have the people come from Africa being as a refugees in Israel the government of Israel has taken over them as a refugees and there are many Christian people they have their churches and they go holding their Bibles I saw them all over they hold their Bibles and go on a sabat day to the church they go to Pentecostal churches and I believe that there might be somebody that already knew the message right that already knew the prophet right but they might not have a place to go in so they are going to that churches but if the Lord just let the things go out and and be known to the people people I'm sure that they will come to worship with us so this how this is how the Lord is leading to me amen and I want you to pray because Israel is more expensive than India it's very expensive than India and in India after 87 I didn't come here to United States brother Wilson helped us in lot of things as I told you about the tape Ministry and about the uh copying machine and everything and he helped us on a monthly Support also till he was in charge of the church there but then later on that that help also stopped but we didn't stop there and there is there was no other Church no other Mission no no other brothers in United States that helped us in our ministry but Lord had given us that heart to serve him right and we always served him without help and with help and it has been so that we taught the people to give to the Lord right we taught them to give whatever they can it's very it kind can be a dime it can be a paining which they bring as a TI unto the Lord because their income is not that high they're all laborers they're just like uh workers you know there are other people good people we have doctors we have engineers in the church right but most of the majority is from the lower people right and they bring the tithe and all these years my dear friends I want to tell you that we serve the Lord we preached the gospel we preached the message and we did everything that we could do with all the support of the brothers and my family right when my mother was there she helped us on the ministry through a tith on other brothers other sisters they helped us on the tith and then in 2002 my sons went to Israel and then they started to help on a greater scale and all that money was used among the Brethren among the pastors and the ministry that which we had if you see that video you will see that we every time we have uh open ground meetings we rent grounds uh school ground school open ground and we arranged there big meetings and the people they come there you know and to hear the and they come out of their denomination come out their religions come out catholism and know everything the Lord just works in that way amen and we spend that money on these meetings we spend money that one time these the city there I was when we preach this on the we had the open camp ground meetings and those ministers there you know their mind you know was so you know they got so much uh uh what I put you in English is that you know uh when we preach the truth yeah and all these years of their life in the in their teaching in their seminaries they were taught that there is a tri God there is a trinity and we come forth and bring them the truth that from where the Trinity has come right they they their mind was blown right because we bring them the truth and we bring them the history we we back up the Bible the word of God and the message together with the history and everything and we brought them from where these things has come revealed to them everything spoken about we I preach in India by God's grace anything that's come against the word of God I preach against catholism I preach against the nuns I preach against all the Traditions that they have and I took them back I took them back from where these things has come right I took them back these nuns I told them from where they have come they are nothing but the the the the being kept for the priest and the high priest I revealed to them through the books of the histories now everything is on the internet everything is on the internet I give them I said you if you don't believe what I have here as as a printed out you go you you search in these places and you'll get the information and their minds were blown and then they decided okay they said okay let us come together I said all right so about six six seven of them the ministers in those trinitarians from different denomination they come up against us okay I said we decided a place I said okay I'll pay the rent I'll arrange for your lunch and you come there we want to we want to see that you hear the word of God we'll present the truth what we have you come up and you present the TR truth what you have and let the people decide that what is the truth and they come up and that's that's in in one of the uh um in the clips there those five six uh the preachers they come in and we stood up and I I explained them very slowly and very slowly and very slowly just word by word and revealed them and spoke to them they were so amazed and they were out of their mind and when their turn come they said no we can't speak anything against this and they refused to come up they said we can't say a word against these things I said if this is the truth I said you better you believe it whe you receive it and that was the result that this Presbyterian Pastor opened his church this may for the meetings so this is the way the Lord has blessed us in India and it's been by just by God's grace that we has been doing all this with the money in India from India and it has been a great blessing to the people and our people are praying people they they go on the mountains and pray in the night they they they believe in fasting I believe in myself in fasting we fast many of days together and Lord just answers the prayer uh it's um and just I received a mail a few days on 27th of August that they had started to work in Pune in the city of Pune a big city in India and they are trying to get together all the message Brethren and have and hold a meeting there and they also gave me the news that there was a young boy who was possessed with a demon and they went and prayed for that boy and he was released by from the that demon and now that that family is open for the message and the truth and they're now holding a weekly meeting in those areas right so the Lord is working with us Glory my today's message I think I can take more 10 10 15 minutes okay so now we see my dear friends that what I wanted to show is from the scripture and from our experiences that the Lord has blessed us why because our God is a living God Amen that's right amen amen the scripture which we read in the scripture the Lord says let man should not be alone it is not good for a man to be alone that's right my dear friends God never wanted man to be alone why why right what was the reason behind it because our God himself never wanted to be alone that was his attribute right that's why the Lord wanted Adam to have an help men right our God he could have just stayed there in a Majesty having all those millions of Angels standing before him y you know yep but he needed a help meate amen he needed a one that can have a fellowship with him and he needed a person that he can go and talk and spend time that could come and say God my Lord to worship him he needed someone to worship Him brother said if if there is no worshipper God cannot be God right if he has to be a God then he has to be a one that can worship him and that's why the Lord say that's why God created man that's why God created Adam that to worship him and that's how we see the God created Adam and it says it's not good for man to be alone that's right my dear friends so the Lord has given us friends has given us Brothers has given us wife so that we could stay in a company lord always wanted to have a company and he choosed man y which was created in his own image and in his own likeness so there he found rest in his people but we see my dear friends that Adam failed God and Adam and the God has to take Adam out of that fellowship and and the scene stood in between God and man right but at the same time lord always has a desire and we also when we have some friend something happens and that friendship is BR broken so we go in search of another friend and we find another friend because that's the quality that's that's that's the that's the inner part of us because God always wanted to have a fellowship and we also look for a fellowship and we also look for a friend and then we see that God looked on the earth and he found one man that's Enoch and then the Lords of the word of God said that Enoch walked with God for 300 years that Fellowship was intact for 300 years it's been we see in the in in this world we hardly have a friendship that can last maybe a year or a two or maybe three or four or five or something like that and that friendship is broken but here Enoch walked with God for 300 years then we see the Lord has another friend called Noah and the scripture says that Noah found Grace in the sight of God and then it says Noah walked with God Amen so that's the grace and then we come up then we see that Abraham was God's friend in Isaiah 418 it says Abraham is my friend he is my friend right see Abraham was long back before the asaiah could come and speak but the Lord is still calling through asaiah that Abraham my friend right so we see that the relation which we come in with God is always remain the same that relation does not change because that relation is eternal relation and still in the days of asaiah God testifies about Abraham that Abraham is my friend thank you Lord amen then we see David my dear friends the God said that he is after my heart Moses he says there is there is no man there is no person as faithful as Moses in all my house so everybody will see had a different characteristics right had a different that everything the Lord call in a different way that look the Lord looked into the hearts of his people he Lord walked with Eno for 300 years God Noah had a Grace in his eyes Noah walked with God then God said Abraham my friend and God said Moses is the faithful servant that I have in in in all my house then Lord says David is the one is after my heart right my dear friends God always I'm keeping it short and the lord always has a desire to have a fellowship with man but he could come down every time in the book in the in the Old Testament if you see the scripture is used the word is used that I will come and I will be with you I will be with thy people he told Moses I will be with you he told Abraham he says I will be with you right I will bless you and Abraham and I will give this lamb to your your sons and daughters and I will be with you thank you Lord to David says I will be with you I will protect you I'll be with you and I will bless you and for for for Solomon he said yes I will be with you and my presence will be here in this Temple and whosoever pray facing to this Temple I will hear that that prayer of his see that was a presence of God right it says I will be with you but the Lord didn't want it to be with us lord always wanted to be in US amen amen and for that the Lord has to do a plan to come and to dwell in human beings and we see that was the plan made perfect in Christ Jesus Lord prepared a body the in Hebrews 2 chapter 14th and 15th vers it says that as such the the children were the partakers of the blood and flesh he also became and took part of the blood and flesh right so he came and he dwelt in Blood and flesh right Colossians first chapter it says nth verse he says in him dwelleth the fullness of godhead bodily second chapter nth verse in him dwelleth the fullness of godhead bodily and and uh Paul says in the book Apostle of Timothy he says without controversy great is the mystery of godl is that God was manifest in flesh right and he came down and dwelt in a man called Jesus Christen and revealed to the world and that's how the Jewish people could not believe Jesus right they thought how God can come in human beings right how this almighty God that holy God could come and dwell in a human flesh am there's this humbled and they said you call yourself God and they tried to took the stone uh Stone Jesus and then he gave the scriptures to him and that's how my dear friends we find the still today that the the minds of Jewish people are still blocked are locked my dear friends they cannot see God in human flesh but by God's grace that Revelation has been given unto us right that God come down yeah and dwell among his people and not only among his people in dwell in us he is in us the hope of glory first uh Colossians 1 chapter and the uh sth verse it says that the hope of glory Christ in you amen Christ in you now that blessing has come to us right those 20 disciples in the upper room they were blessed with the blessing and that Holy Spirit came upon them and that's what the Prophet Paul says in Romans 8th chapter he says if that Holy Spirit by which God raised Jesus Christ from the dead is in you amen then he will raise you your dead bodies Asing amen so if that Holy Spirit mean who is that Holy Spirit that Jesus Christ he is not a different God he's not the second God and third God he is that same person but in in in as a holy spirit inj so now we have received that blessing through Christ Jesus that upon the cross he tow that ve in the two paths from up to the bottom and he made us an open place to come in the presence of God am to worship him and to call him Upon Our AB father and now in these last days my your friends God has revealed to us excuse me through the prophet bless him as we see the ministry of our brother branam that how how the Lord has shown in this last days that's right my dear friends we have to open our eyes in these days my dear friends because what God is going doing in this age in my age and your age come on brother Bram says see the message of the Moses or Noah or that time will not do anything good for you and me it's it's the time that we are living in where we are living in and what's going on in the church about the world is not it's in the church what God is doing that we have to know and we have to see in this last days one more time God has revealed to his church that God can come down in a human flesh and to be in in his people and to walk in his people right he showed to the whole world with Miracles with wonders with healing and the revelation of the word of God Amen he revealed to them that is the same God which was to th000 years before was upon the face of the Earth and walked in a human being that same God is alive and he's alive ever more Hallelujah he is the same yesterday today and forever amen and that God is not with us but that God is in US amen he is in us that hope of glory right my friends if he is in us then he will raise this body into the incorruptable body he transformed that body into that Heavenly Body that's what we are waiting for in this generation God has Saed that Prophet for us in this last generation to open our eyes that's it this is the last time this is the last period that we are living in and if this age if we couldn't understand this age my dear friends we will be the most foolish people to know amen the Lord says to all those Jewish and the Greek people he says you you can recognize the signs of the heaven and can't you recognize the time the sign of the times brother Bram said in the sign of the times see we have to recognize the sign of the time right what time it is sir it is a time to go home come on it is a time to go home and if we don't go home my dear friends it's going be to be more and more worst that we could see on the face of God this has to be there but now we see when the children of Israel were in the Captivity the Lord came down and spoke to Moses and Mo and the Lord spoke to Moses he says I have heard the Cry of my people and that's why I have come to deliver them the Cry of my people Glory that brings down God on the face of the Earth that brings God down to deliver his people is our cry enough to call God down to take his bride away are are we still enjoying right our life here if we are enjoying we are happy we are joyful and we think that no this world is very good for us then we won't cry on to the Lord that's right we'll cry when we see that this world is not worthy to live in when we see that we are tormented in our heart in lives to see our young children being taken away by the things of the world then we will see our sons and daughters walking away from the truth and from the Lord and from the church and the fellowship then we'll cry unto the Lord Lord it's enough now we cannot see it no more let's take us away from this world and then only the Lord will come down Glory my dear friends there is another cry that go brings God down on the earth is the Cry of the Sinners Lord spoke to Abraham he says I have heard the Cry of Sodom and Gora I have heard the Cry of their sin and I have come down right God spoke to Jonah he says I heard the Cry of the sin of nin and I'm going to destroy it my dear friends this two cry has to come has to go before the Lord right amen today the bride of Christ has to cry unto the Lord Lord come down and take us away from this wicked world that cry is not enough right now my dear friends and that's why the Lord has not come down if the Lord you want that the Lord should come down then you have to cry unto the Lord that lord it's no more I can take now Lord it's enough Lord just come down and take your bride away my dear friends we have received the greatest blessing that's right Israel didn't had the Lord spoke in 2 Corinthians 6th chapter the Lord says that I will ye are the Temple of the Living God I will dwell in you and I will walk in you you will be my children and I will be your father this blessing was not for the children of Israel on for them it says I will be with you I will be in you but not in US my dear friends that blessing is still with children of Israel God is keeping that promise defending Israel against all these enemies around around around the uh Israel not only them but all the worldly powers that standing and going against Israel God is a living God his promises are that that he will be in us and if that hope of glory which is Christ is in you my
