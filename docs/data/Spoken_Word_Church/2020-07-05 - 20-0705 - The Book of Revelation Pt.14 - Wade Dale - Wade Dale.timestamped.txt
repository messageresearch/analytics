[0:00] thank you all for coming away or bless
[0:02] you have a good Sunday so far so good
[0:04] we gotta become church and we're gonna
[0:08] hear some good word upstairs good
[0:12] singing it's a new fellowship that's
[0:15] them we own revelation 4 and we will
[0:19] read this here after this I looked and
[0:22] behold the door was open in heaven and
[0:23] we know what that is that's the wrapped
[0:25] ring of the Gentile bride there I got
[0:27] them the Gentile bride not the Jews the
[0:31] Jews are still here the Jews are going
[0:33] to have to get their Redemption after
[0:36] we're gone because God won't deal with
[0:38] both at the same time he deals with one
[0:40] of the other so he blinded the Jews he's
[0:43] getting ready to reveal itself to them
[0:46] but you and I don't have to get out of
[0:48] here but then before that like I said
[0:53] last Sunday this is all the spiritual
[0:56] walk for me and you after this because
[0:58] we'll capture up into the rapture are
[1:01] taken up into the rapture caught up and
[1:04] these has come up hither and I will show
[1:06] thee things which must be Hereafter so
[1:08] in other words it is important to us the
[1:11] hereafter he's talking about because
[1:13] what we're doing this now he took John
[1:16] up into another dimension and he's
[1:18] showing him what's going on in another
[1:20] dimension simply because the four and
[1:24] twenty elders are not alive at the time
[1:26] they're over in another dimension
[1:27] waiting okay to come back to earth see
[1:32] soon they'll come back to earth again
[1:33] revelation 19 I believe with us but
[1:38] right now they're in another dimension
[1:39] the sixth dimension waiting so John was
[1:43] caught up in another dimension so that
[1:44] he could get a revelation
[1:46] number one he said immediately I was in
[1:51] the spirit seen in the spirit so got the
[1:53] spirit
[1:54] to a place and behold a throne was set
[1:57] in heaven and one sat on the throne so I
[2:00] don't think John was surprised when he
[2:03] got there and just saw one because he
[2:05] saw Jesus sitting on the throne he knew
[2:07] that Jesus was he knew me physically and
[2:09] you know personally he knew who he was
[2:11] so good night okay so physically he knew
[2:18] them and where do practice well here's
[2:24] one telling them okay all right it's
[2:28] 9:45 you taking out my time let's go be
[2:30] home a throne was set in heaven and one
[2:32] sat on the throne so he was a surprised
[2:34] to see that one and I don't think it was
[2:36] surprised to see Jesus sent him the
[2:38] throne either and it be one person so
[2:40] there's one God sitting on throne right
[2:43] mm-hmm
[2:44] and he that sat on was all that
[2:46] characteristics of revelation one
[3:00] she was garment down to the foot Girt
[3:02] about the paps with a golden girdle of
[3:03] head and his hair was white like wool
[3:05] why did snow is eyes were flame of fire
[3:07] his feet like unto fine brass is burning
[3:10] the furnace into the voice the sound of
[3:11] many waters that's what he met at the
[3:13] first now he's meeting that same person
[3:16] sitting on the throne and he said sat on
[3:20] him look like Jasper and sardine stone
[3:22] or that would be called sardius stone
[3:27] not a sardine like we think sardine
[3:29] stone and there was a rainbow around
[3:32] about the throne in sight like an
[3:33] emerald so we know that that was the
[3:36] same person the same characteristic the
[3:38] program calls it the person each of
[3:40] Jesus Christ I thought there he was
[3:43] sitting there and round about the throne
[3:45] were four and 20 seats and upon the
[3:48] seats I saw four and twenty elders
[3:50] clothed in white raiment and they had on
[3:54] their head crowns of gold and out of the
[3:57] throne proceeded lightnings and
[3:58] thunderings and voices and there were
[4:01] seven lamps of fire burning before the
[4:03] throne which are the seven spirits of
[4:05] God all right so you've got in tight
[4:09] Paul Iranians Martin Colombo it was the
[4:13] seven spirits that anointed these men I
[4:15] don't believe it was the seven men
[4:16] sitting there it didn't say man it said
[4:19] seven pillars seven lamps before the
[4:22] throne which are the seven spirits of
[4:24] God not just putting all that together
[4:28] okay he's not separating the church age
[4:30] and then here's Paul no there's the
[4:33] seven lamps and the seven spirits that
[4:36] were in each eight and we know it was
[4:39] what Len Talos feared it was the Holy
[4:41] Spirit it was the Holy Spirit every
[4:43] eight seven spirits of God not spirits
[4:47] of the devil or spirits of false
[4:49] doctrine everybody had truth in their
[4:51] church a if I got that all right now
[4:54] look and before the throne there was a
[4:57] sea of glass likely to crystal and in
[5:01] the midst of the throne and round about
[5:03] the throne were four beasts full of eyes
[5:06] before behind
[5:07] for beef lamb boxer calf man and Eagle
[5:16] we've been through this through this and
[5:18] through this and here we are showing it
[5:20] right here that it's coming up again and
[5:24] that's the characteristics of what the
[5:27] Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is in every
[5:29] one of those people the Holy Ghost is
[5:31] there the double ghost was all also in
[5:34] John John had about them the Holy Ghost
[5:37] he was standing there with a baptism the
[5:39] Holy Ghost looking at these four
[5:41] characteristics that were prevalent ndj
[5:46] we know that the lion the odds the man
[5:49] and the eagle we've been through that
[5:51] we're now in the Eagle Age the fourth
[5:53] beast was like a flying eagle not I'm
[5:56] sitting eagle on it on a rock or sitting
[5:59] eagle on a flying eagle showing that he
[6:02] was already up there in the height
[6:04] looking around yes getting revelation
[6:07] and we know that brother Branham was
[6:09] typing that last person but also we're
[6:12] evil brother mom called us Eagles and
[6:14] then Eclipse grow up to be eagle all
[6:16] right so that's what you and I have to
[6:18] do that's why there's a growth
[6:19] development in your new birth you got to
[6:22] grow into them from a baby eagle to I'm
[6:24] in a baby eagle fall out of the mess and
[6:26] kill yourself but a momma eagle she
[6:31] don't matter how high she gets on the
[6:32] cliff front she just assumes right down
[6:34] because she depends brother Graham says
[6:36] she depends on them to arms or those two
[6:39] wings which is the old and new
[6:41] testaments in his line and the four
[6:45] beasts had six wings about him and they
[6:47] were full of eyes within one eyes eyes
[6:50] of Revelation Sears s te RS not st ste
[6:57] er nuts not s not seizures but seer
[7:01] right so that's what the Holy Ghost did
[7:03] you say well now brother Randall is a
[7:04] seer from the Holy Ghost is to see if si
[7:08] s de are the Prophet brother man told us
[7:11] the profitably and
[7:12] Elizabet was the holy ghost right the
[7:15] four basement six wings full of lies
[7:18] within and their rest not day and night
[7:20] saying holy holy holy Lord God Almighty
[7:22] the holy all is no rest right
[7:24] it can't it's always giving you a
[7:27] revelation it's enough you've read
[7:28] giving you a revelation is helping you
[7:30] through your life if he's not having you
[7:31] through your life he's helping it to eat
[7:32] job he's not helping through the job
[7:34] he's your guardian angel when you're
[7:35] outside of the car driving so he's not
[7:38] he is not at rest they are flying and
[7:41] they rest not day and night even at
[7:43] night while you're sleep
[7:45] the Holy Ghost is there interceding for
[7:48] you all right and all the things that
[7:50] you go through holy holy holy Lord God
[7:52] Almighty which was which is and is to
[7:55] come
[7:56] and when those beasts give glory and
[7:59] honor and thanks to him that sat on the
[8:00] throne who liveth for ever and ever the
[8:03] four and twenty elders fall down before
[8:05] him that sat on the throne and worship
[8:08] Him that liveth for ever and ever and
[8:11] cast their crowns before the throne
[8:12] saying thou art worthy why do they know
[8:16] he's worthy because he's the Lamb of God
[8:18] you take away the sin of the world they
[8:19] realize he is the savior of all them
[8:24] thou art worthy O Lord to receive glory
[8:27] and honor and power without that's
[8:30] created that's why I listen member
[8:31] Andrew come up this last night listening
[8:34] God is a jealous God he said he was he
[8:38] said I'll have no other gods before me
[8:39] and every time you go and worship
[8:41] another god I'm gonna give you a plate
[8:44] because I'm in reading in chronicles and
[8:45] kings every time they got out of the
[8:47] will of God God sent a plate they when
[8:51] when Josiah and some of the others were
[8:53] Kings that was rest in the land the
[8:56] Philistine states where they was that
[8:58] mysterion state where they would not you
[8:59] know why because God gave him rest but
[9:01] as soon as some other person comes in
[9:05] couch King and does not that witches
[9:07] please have the God God tells the
[9:09] Philistines hey that's the same way with
[9:13] me and you we don't do the right thing
[9:16] what happened I go back to this in my
[9:20] life a lot of times Kush the scene with
[9:23] Mike I
[9:24] Makana comes up and there's Hezekiah and
[9:27] no one has to kind of lose it and they
[9:29] have they haven't Jehoshaphat they
[9:32] haven't Jocelyn they come in Joe hops
[9:34] passes hey I he has all discernment
[9:37] because he said I have said I got four
[9:39] hundred prophets that do my will and
[9:42] they said go up you know Israel I see
[9:45] you taking over and one of them eight
[9:46] horns and all animated about it and then
[9:49] toss some facts like I believe he said
[9:52] in his heart he said you probably paid
[9:55] them pretty well
[9:56] in other words to say what they're
[9:58] saying ain't you got one more that we
[10:01] can count on and they have said yeah but
[10:03] I hate him he always prophesized against
[10:06] me
[10:06] Wayne way the story is that you see in
[10:08] the Bible it talks about how that Makai
[10:10] saw he's looked he said I saw a God
[10:14] sitting in heaven and he said all these
[10:17] people were saying how all these demons
[10:20] he said well demons get around God well
[10:22] yeah thing like spirit came up before
[10:25] God he said I'll go down there and get
[10:27] him four hundred prophets and I'll
[10:29] because the prophets I see I am seeking
[10:34] he'd change his mind he had already
[10:35] prophesied that the dogs would link the
[10:38] chariot that had a half-blood any so
[10:40] that was a prophecy that had to be
[10:42] fulfilled
[10:43] four hundred lion preachers we're trying
[10:46] to tell them that wasn't gonna happen
[10:48] but Makai stepped up and says I saw a
[10:51] lying spirit come before God so she
[10:53] asked why you and I'm going to go
[10:54] through trials and tribulations what I'm
[10:56] saying is we go through trials and
[10:57] tribulations God has allowed the full
[11:00] listening to come into your camp or a
[11:02] Syrian or this
[11:03] or that one because you got kind of a
[11:05] little bit out of the will of God or you
[11:06] got a little complacent or you got a
[11:08] little mad at your neighbor are you
[11:10] brother and then he'll send a little
[11:11] beady-eyed in that's what he did in the
[11:15] Old Testament every time we get out of
[11:16] the will of God the Syrians would show
[11:18] up with the army of fifty thousand
[11:20] people you know they'd take over a city
[11:22] and then then in one in one scripture
[11:25] one of the Kings repents like has a kind
[11:27] of somebody he repents it's that done
[11:29] I'm sorry for what I did well then God
[11:31] just went out there to the Syrians and
[11:32] just killed about 10,000 of them a name
[11:34] like fleeing back to there you see what
[11:36] I'm saying
[11:36] right there's angels working all the
[11:39] time that was God working that was the
[11:41] Holy Ghost working in the Old Testament
[11:43] working in those people and yes he'll
[11:46] let something come upon you to try you
[11:49] make sure that we are right what we're
[11:52] doing and let us know when we're roaming
[11:55] like what we're doing he'll send a
[11:57] little iron or something there but if
[11:59] you'll turn back to God his promise is
[12:01] if you'll turn back to God he said I'm
[12:02] taking all that away from you so the
[12:04] same way here so he said the four beasts
[12:07] had six wings are in those beasts give
[12:09] glory and honor thou art worthy O Lord
[12:11] to receive glory and honor and power for
[12:12] thou has created all things so there was
[12:14] the creator god and for thy pleasure
[12:18] they are and were created right so I've
[12:23] always said you know God's not an old
[12:27] man he's a happy young guy and he's
[12:31] standing out there an eternity way back
[12:33] before anything was made and he's like
[12:35] man I wanna and I want to Milky Way and
[12:39] I want to Pluto and Neptune and I want
[12:44] some a Saturday with rings around it and
[12:46] I don't want this just to be a dull
[12:48] planet I want to fish
[12:49] now and he was that was him because he
[12:52] said whatever thing it's for your
[12:53] pleasure they were created yes that's
[12:57] why God didn't create sin he allows them
[12:59] to come in to show his glory and a lot
[13:04] of people kind of figured got it out
[13:08] that way why does he allow well he knows
[13:11] we're human listen if we didn't have God
[13:12] think about where we'd be what girl
[13:15] Andrew said last night think about if
[13:17] you went home and there was no God and
[13:19] there was just evil and there was just
[13:21] what's going on in this world is all you
[13:24] had to depend on think about that what
[13:28] shape would be in but to know that there
[13:32] is a micaiah among them four hundred
[13:36] prophets a true Holy Ghost and a group
[13:40] of people they that matter what four
[13:42] hundred people say can you imagine
[13:44] though him standing there I like to look
[13:46] at scenes their sex two kings one of you
[13:49] them one of Israel they have very
[13:51] powerful jaws effect very powerful four
[13:54] hundred preachers just I mean go on up
[13:58] you can take them and do the horn you're
[14:00] not and you don't have fun with air like
[14:02] this I think we got this thing with and
[14:06] the Lord speaks to Jehoshaphat inside he
[14:09] says listen if we find one more opinion
[14:13] on this thing and one guy the had him in
[14:15] jail they had him in jail they bring him
[14:19] out they hadn't seen him in a house with
[14:21] I hate that every time he comes into
[14:23] this room he prophesized against me well
[14:25] a house out a little guy that's when he
[14:27] prophesied against it he had one true
[14:30] prophet so hey
[14:32] however me and you the same way were to
[14:34] stand in the end time against four
[14:36] hundred four thousand four hundred
[14:38] thousand people that think they're right
[14:41] and if you are you bold enough to Makai
[14:44] you know the one three flat demons if
[14:47] we're the spirit going like I said
[14:49] you'll know tomorrow and they have told
[14:52] him said you're going to prison and
[14:53] you're
[14:54] now giving the bread of affliction
[14:55] giving the water of affliction and I'll
[14:58] see you know we're now able you're gonna
[15:00] get back and makai turned and looked at
[15:02] him and he said if you come back I'm a
[15:05] false prophet right many did he died
[15:09] that day
[15:09] just exactly what Makati had said that's
[15:12] the way we've got to be that's what
[15:13] would come out last night we got to be
[15:15] bold when it comes to now to the Word of
[15:17] God because it's narrowing down there is
[15:19] just a small bride there is a lot of
[15:21] people into messes and there's a lot of
[15:22] people that may be sanctified but
[15:24] there's only one bride there's one group
[15:27] of people it's kind of stand in front of
[15:28] 400 preachers and say you're all wrong
[15:33] you're all wrong you you're not getting
[15:35] it right then they're gonna challenge
[15:37] you just like the big profit that comes
[15:41] up and slapped him in the face and said
[15:42] we're the spirit go you know when I
[15:44] slapped you right and my kind of pretty
[15:47] much said well this wasn't in you wasn't
[15:51] in you if that was the spirit you think
[15:52] of the other women you because they are
[15:55] Mikael was anointed to tell the truth
[15:56] we're doing it in this day to tell the
[15:59] truth yeah we're not anointed to tell
[16:00] something's all right we've got to be
[16:03] able to tell the truth all right then so
[16:05] now revelations five issue one minute
[16:07] till let's read this one scripture will
[16:10] go up front I saw in the right hand of
[16:11] him that sat on the throne a book
[16:12] written within and on the backside
[16:15] sealed seven seals so we'll get into
[16:18] revelation 5 next time you'll be back in
[16:23] second and I might maybe in your seat so
[16:26] don't look at them all
