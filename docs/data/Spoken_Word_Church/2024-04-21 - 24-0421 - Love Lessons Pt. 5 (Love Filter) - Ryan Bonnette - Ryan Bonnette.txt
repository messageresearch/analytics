TRANSCRIPT
========================================
and I'm also teaching the Sunday School lesson here again uh it was going to be brother Aaron filling in for brother Bob up here and then he got caught on last minute to go to brother Dutch Scots to minister while I was going to be teaching the teenage class so uh they're joining us this morning the teenagers are joining us up here so I want to kind of cater this lesson partially to the teenagers and then to the adults and kind of make it um appropriate for them as well so just be patient with me but it's kind of all the same thought that I'm going down here I've been thinking about thinking if that makes any sense y'all know I drive a truck and I think a lot meditate a lot and I've been thinking about thinking and how important it is to meditate on the word of God and meditate on your decisions in life and the way you go in life so I kind of had a lesson geared towards the young people for that and and also that was what I was going to be teaching here next in the adult class so I thought I'd just kind of join them all together and just make a few comments toward the young people and for the young at heart so let's all go to the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father pray you bless this little lesson Lord let it be a blessing to your people father you know I've studied and prayed and tried to prepare myself for this I pray you just uh use my lips to speak and let it be a help to them I pray and their walk with you in Jesus name amen so I made the comment last time on my last lesson we're on uh that was love lesson I was teaching number four uh about first love and I made the comment that uh good oldfashioned thought goes a long way you know we kind of go through life and stumble along and think I guess because we're Christians that God just going to make make everything just happen just exactly right and we don't really have to think about what we do and we just kind of stumble around and but really he gave us a mind to think and he wants us to have his mind the mind of Christ so it really pays to think and you young people um I don't see that all that many here but Harmony anyway I don't know I can't young at heart anyway maybe they'll hear it later but um to the young people in that age bracket of you know 10 to 20 years old in that era in that part of life it's a very hard time of life because you're transitioning from childhood to adulthood there's yeah Thomas and Abby too so and these two all right now they're all appearing for me all right I see everybody so all right y'all are in this a really hard time in life and this one part of life I would never want to relive okay so uh I want to encourage y'all to just keep on going cuz it's not always going to be that way you're just in a transition from childhood to adulthood and you're you're no longer children you'll never be children again you know um so that that time is gone but yet you're not a full fledged adult per se and you're in this time of life where you have to make all these decisions that will affect the rest of your life and here you you don't have all that much wisdom from life because you haven't lived that much life yet so you're having to make all of these decisions whether without necessarily a whole lot of good life wisdom and so it means you really have to pray and you really have to think and you really have to meditate on your way in what you're doing and why you're doing it and seek Godly counsel there's a lot of people here older that have been there that you can seek counsel from your pastor ministers your parents and so on before you make these life decisions because as brother T how Thomas told me years ago he said after one of my gradu ation high school or college I don't remember it was a perfect time for him to tell me Ryan think about your decisions today how they'll affect you in 10 years from now in 20 years from now not just for the moment and that affected my decisions and I won't go into detail about that but it really changed my course and and I I started thinking Lord I really want you first I want to prioritize so that left off piloting as a career I said I don't want to be missing Church to fly people to Britain or whatever I don't want to be an Aina pilot anymore so I kept flying as a hobby and said I'm going to go with truck driving well I don't want to be an over the road driver it'll take me away from church away from family so I'll be a local truck driver and so it kind of molded me down to where I'm at now and I'm happy with what I'm doing being at church every service seeing my family every day driving a truck which I enjoy and flying for fun so you really have to just think about what you're doing and why you're doing it as far as College I know it's been it was kind of really pressed on my generation you have to have an education to make it well well yes in some sense but make it make sense if you're going to be a truck driver you don't have to have a bachelor's degree and and whatever you know and I got an associates degree but then I I I stopped with that because I didn't need any further degree to drive a truck I said Mom and Dad this is what I want to do I want to drive a trucks what do I want to do with my life and they said okay so I don't have any regrets about that but at least you know I didn't go $100,000 in a student loan debt to drive a truck you know so really think about what you're doing if you're going to college make it applicable to what you're going to do and don't waste a lot of money and time pursuing something that's just not going to magically give you a degree the history factories are closed you know if you're going for a history degree you're going to have to do something in like teaching history I mean something that makes that make sense you know you're not going to go work at a chicken plant with a history degree doesn't make any sense so good oldfashioned thought goes a long way and don't be so super spiritual to think that God's going to put a big old flashy billboard in front of for every decision and and just tell you exactly what to do as M as much as I would have liked him to do that he doesn't do that sometimes he lets us decide he wants to see what we'll choose he gave us free moral agency he wants us to choose him first put you know our priorities in order like brother John said write something down make a plan if you fail to plan your plan will fail every time so he wants us to think and make choices Philippians 4:8 you know the scripture think on these things choose you this day who you serve the scripture says and um set your affections on things above Colossians 3 set your affections on things above means there's a a choice it means there's some thought involved and some intention there not just it just automatically happen so brother Michael is doing a tremendous job teaching young people and I want y'all to really listen to what he's saying because at at 15 when I was about y'all's age in the Baptist Church I had a youth pastor much like him that was teaching me to seek ye first the kingdom of God and that stuck with me my whole life that's a lot of reason I started reading the Bible every day at that age it's a lot of reason that I chose to put Christ in marriage because of him brother Michael is teaching youall to inquire in the temple of the Lord as David said in Psalm 27 inquire in his Temple don't just come to church and sit and listen and then go home ask questions think while you're here and think about what was preached when you go home okay it'll take you a long ways in life to do that do the homework you know a minister stands up here and says read or listen to XYZ write it down and go do that brother Michael is impressing on y'all on that doors indoor sermon brother bham preached and he had y'all do that quiz and it was a tough quiz uh we helped our girls reviewing and preparing for that and they made a passing grade but it wasn't as great as I thought and I was thought wow that was a really hard quiz but he's trying to impress on you all that you need to let God into your heart but then let him into every door of your heart so that goes beyond just salvation that means opening the door of pride in my private life life and all those things like brother bam taught so he's really teaching you to seek first the kingdom of God so really listen to that all right so choice is obviously connected to thinking and that's why I'm impressing that's why I'm trying to stress the fact of thinking about what you're doing look at things and people and decisions through this love lens and that through that I'm going to try to transition into the adult lesson I'll have more kids comment or no not you're not kids more comments toward the young adults and throughout the lesson but that was the majority of it so Ephesians 5 Paul says husbands love your wies even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it also um kind of teaching on uh don't um don't act out of bitterness and hatred and Malice and strife you know let love be the ruling factor in your life and the way you interact with people and situations and your words and your deeds and everything you do right through this love filter as I'm fixing to get into the filter of love the Holy Ghost the word of God so choosing of her bride brother B I'm talking here about decisions um if y'all remember back 2006 the last Alabama Camp a lot of y'all were there we had that play and I believe we had brother banham quoting this and it never left my mind since then it really really heavily set in with me at that time as I was in that phase of making all these decisions about college career and especially marriage your Eternal Destin ation is a choice and maybe tonight some of you will make that choice of where you'll spend eternity before the service Ends Tonight there'll be one time that if you turn down God many times there'll be one time you'll turn him down the last time there is a line between mercy and judgment and it's a dangerous thing for man woman boy girl to step across that line but there's no turn return when you step across that dead line so tonight it might be the last time that many of you will make their decision where they will spend the endless eternity there's another choice that we have in life and that's the life's companion a young man young woman stepping out on life has been given a right to make a choice young man chooses the young woman has a right to accept or reject it but it's still a choice on both sides both man and woman have a right to choose and he goes on talk about a lot of other things you can choose but those are a couple of the main things especially eternal life please give your heart to Christ at a young age you will spare yourself yourself so much trouble and he will guide you in all these decisions about marriage and so forth forth so this is about love as a choice Psalm 91 because thou Hast made the Lord which is my refuge even the most high thy habitation you put God first there shall no evil befall thee neither shall any plague come not th dwelling for he shall give his angels charge over thee to keep thee and all thy ways they shall bear thee up in their hands lest any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone Thou shalt tread upon the lion and adder and the Young Lion and the dragon shalt thou trample under feet because he hath set his love upon me therefore will I deliver him he set his love upon me that's a choice that takes some thinking and some int intention set your love upon him therefore will I deliver him I will set him on high because he hath known my name he shall call upon me and I will answer him I will be with him in trouble I will deliver him and honor him with long life will I satisfy him and show him my salvation so the love lesson today part five is on love filter and you may realize that I'm I'm making reference kind of to the uh thinking man's filter brother benon preached the sermon about and I believe he quoted that sermon from Ephesians 5 so this is about conforming our desires to the will of the Lord if you will want what God wants you to want you'll get what you want it's kind of like that I know that's kind of a tongue twister but set your affections say Lord let just conform my desires to your will cuz there was a time when I wanted a certain way and God said that's not what I want for you for you and brother Gary Atkins said Ryan if God don't want you to have it trust me you don't want it no matter how bad you think you want it certain things in life you young people may think you want now but if God don't want you to have it he knows best wies submit yourself to your own husbands as unto the Lord for the husband is the head of the wife even as Christ is the head of the church and he's a savior of the body therefore as the church is subject unto Christ so let the wives be subject their own husband everything this is about marriage as well as Christ and the bride we as the bride submit our ways our choices everything we do to our husband Christ husband love your wives even as Christ also love the church so that's kind of a Selfless Love okay put a lot of emphasis in this lesson on selflessness in marriage and in every other interaction we have with people in life don't think about yourself so much and gave himself for it that he might sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of Water by the word so there is that renewing of your mind there is that filter thanking man's filter there is that love filter sanctify and cleanse us with the washing Water by the word and that gives us that Holy man's taste brother Banner said a holy man's taste is like our appetite is no longer for the world as a this kind of a slow transition it doesn't happen overnight but as a slow transition as you go through this journey reading the word and praying and seeking God and coming to church then you start to lose your desires for the things of the world you know for a while you might just have to abstain from it and and make a lot of effort even though you still desire it just try to resist the devil and he will flee from you but then at some point in time you won't have that taste anymore you won't desire those things anymore that he might present it to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself for no man ever yet hateth his own flesh but nourisheth and cherisheth it even as the Lord the church for we are members of of his body and of his flesh and of his bone for this cause shall a man leave his father mother be joined to his wife and they two shall be one flesh so looking at everybody and everything in life through that love lens did I read that one yet this is a great mystery of speak concerning Christ and the church yeah okay let's go on so the thanking man's filter brother B said oh yes the word of God is the thinking man's filter anyone knows that that's what your soul is filtered through the word of God and it makes when you come through God when a thinking man comes through God's filter it gives him a holy man's taste okay that's right when you come through God's filter then your taste is a holy man's taste it makes a righteous man's taste the slogan certainly is okay all right thanking man's filter but down inside of you somewhere here you come there was something in there that began to draw if you note it was something that told you there was a god somewhere and you read his word then you took the church you took the their ideas and you was told better then you never Ed to think uh use to thanking man's filter but when you use God's filter which is a thanking man's filter because all of the filter will pass away but mine shall not and when you take God's filter and draw your life your desires if you draw your desires through God's filter thinking man's filter there is nothing left but the Holy Ghost now if you want the evidence of the Holy Ghost there it is when that soul of yours will align with the word of God in every respect it shows you draw your life through the thing of man's filter God's filter notice is that God's filter he said he was Washed by the Water of the word so I quoted this last time I wanted to leave I want to go ahead and I took a lot of things out that I don't need to repeat but I really want to repeat this little quote here uh it came from the the Life Bible app it's a devotional that you know they quote a lot of devotionals and there from different sources so Western culture has shaped our minds to believe that the purpose of the institution of marriage is to make individuals happy selfish people tend to believe that marriage is about finding the right person a person whose likes and dislikes hobbies and interests match own The Dating Game try this one try that one till you find the right one you know that's not God's way that's that's the world's way trying one trying another and we tend to believe it's about finding a person who completes us and makes us whole this results in a me mindset in marriage we can foolishly enter into a marriage relationship focused on what we think we will get out of it in Ephesians 5 the Apostle Paul tells us that marriage isn't about making ourselves happy it's about making us holy marriage is a picture of how Jesus loves the church and gave himself a sacrifice we quoted uh Ephesians 5 remember too when talking about selfishness about brother Bob's lesson last Sunday about all the eye Wills I think he said that was five eye Wills of Lucifer I will be like the most high I will send to the heaven and so forth he has his will that he wants done and every time someone Falls away from the lord it's always something to do with your own will getting in the way and thinking God's not capable and thinking well I need to help him out I need to help him find me a spouse so I'm going to try this one and try that one and I need to help him find me a job so I'm going to do this and do that and just sit back wait on God pray read your Bible seek you first the kingdom of God and watch what he does marriage isn't about finding the right person it's about being the right person both husband and wife are called to be the type of people who love unconditionally forgive continually serve sacrificially just like Jesus Paul calls us to enter into marriage with the ministry mindset marriage isn't about what you can get out of the relationship about what you can give to the relationship for God's glory when you seek to demonstrate love in your marriage when you're willing to lay down your life for your spouse and serve sacrificially the gospel is rehearsed daily in your household bottom line marriage is about having a Ministry mindset of loving service rather than a selfish mindset that was from a moment of uh from the book um strength inspiration for men so here's an illustration that I thought of the other day and I think it's a beautiful thing and um I hope it's hope there's nothing wrong with it but just imagine what this looks like to the Lord so you young people um you grow up and you come to the age of accountability and you give your heart to the Lord and that's the best thing you could possibly do at a young age 12 years old or so you give your heart to the Lord and metaphorically speaking you've now put yourself up in the lap of Jesus in his arms and you're saying Lord I want you to guide me I want you to lead me through every path that I take in life and have your way thy kingdom come thy will be done and he'll lead you and he'll guide you into all truth and he'll lead you to a spouse and his time and he'll lead you to the right career and college if necessary whatever else you need to do in life life he'll lead you and suppose this is a boy and a girl I can't tell from the picture but let's just suppose this is a boy and a girl living two separate lives and now they've both committed their lives to Christ and they've grown up in the Lord and they're serving the lord what must that look like to him he loves that and they come let back up read that at the bottom first walk with the Lord as a child that's number one establish that as a as young as you can give your heart to Christ and serve him all of your days and determine in yourself I'm never never going to stop seeking God I'm never going to not serve the Lord for the rest of my life now that's thing number one thing number two then when he brings that special someone to you then as a couple you walk with them always so like on the right here uh that picture of me and Gabby there brother Luther's Church there that was me putting the ring on her finger on her wedding day and you know when you come to this wedding ceremony it's so sanctimonious there's so much symbology of Eternity you know when our Rings you know meaning that marriage is until death to your part is not a temporary thing and and the Bible they're representing you know the word of God of course of of the Lord there and then in the church among a cloud of witnesses and at the altar where your life is changed here at the altar and you're taking a new Direction in life in so many ways so many new things opening up to you and from day one suppose that those two kids that grew up in the arms of the Lord have now committed theel to Christ and they both sat there before the Lord every day for their marriage can you imagine what that must do to the Lord what that must what he must think of that that these two people have served him their whole life now have consecrated themselves to each other and together they're going to reestablish what was in the Garden of Eden the original marriage holy matrimony not just a joint venture holy matrimony not just husband and wife husband and wife and the Lord walking together in Christ every day reading the Bible together praying together coming to church together listening to sermons together and what must he think of that I think it's a great thing I think it's one of the best things you can do the best thing you do in life is give your heart to Christ I'd say the second best thing is determined to read your Bible every day and pray but then somewhere down the list for sure is establish a marriage for Christ that you put him in it beyond the wedding day you come to the altar sure and you have all this symbology here for the wedding ceremony but what about day number two what if the very night of your wedding weding you open the Bible and pray together and read the Bible together and then the first day of your the very next opportunity the doors are open at the church you go to church together and from there on you just serve them together walk close with the Lord IND individually and with your spouse remove self from Marriage Paul's saying here in 1 Corinthians 7 but I would have you without carefulness he that is unmarried care for the things that belong to the Lord how he may please the Lord so you can be more committed to Christ without distraction if you don't get married but if you're going to get married he that's married you know has other things uh he cares for the things of the world how he may please his wife he's not say anything wrong about that it's just that you can't fully uh attend on the Lord now you've got to attend to your spouse but he you should be thinking about how you can please your spouse too okay not yourself and then likewise the wife uh the unmarried woman care for the things of the Lord has she may be holy both in body and spirit she that is married careth for the things of the world how she may please her husband this I speak for your own Prophet not that May cast a snare upon you but that for that which is calmly and that you may attend upon the Lord without distraction the point of quoting that was to say that Paul's pointing out that you know husband and wife are committed to each other and not thinking of their own self so God keeps his word brother B said so children back to your God quickly just for time sake I'm going to skip down just read the yellow read your Bible and pray all the time and the yellow part in here too uh from the message of Abraham and he will reveal to babes such as will believe if you want to get anything from God just be a baby like those pictures I showed you be a baby open up the Bible fall in love with Jesus sit there in his lap and just say Lord tell me about you for the message identification then will we let his character be in us if we have become Sons by having the mind of Christ which is his character your mind takes your character let the Mind Paul said of Christ this mind that was in Christ be in you let the mind of Christ be in you it mold the character of a Son of God so that's where we get his mind from I'm going to have to save this for later this is uh that love D book I quoted a time or two before well actually I will just quote one of them I guess while the musicians come y'all go ahead and musicians make your way up this is a devotional that Gab and I reading together um from the scripture Romans 13 don't owe any man anything except to love one another for who uh the one who loves another has fulfilled the law love ultimately fulfills every law of God it persuades us to live out all all that is good and forbids us from doing all that is evil Every Act of hatred subtle deception appla of unfaithfulness is vetoed when the love command is in our hearts love toward God leads us to obey him uphold his rightful place of honor in our lives if we do so we will by default not sin against his name love toward others transforms our behavior for the better and defend diffuses evil intentions like that like light dispels Darkness so put on those love glasses look at everything through these that love lens of the Holy Ghost men who lead by love won't deceive or degrade their wives or their neighbors When Love fills a woman's mouth she encourages her family instead of tearing them down when you're focused on love you will naturally demonstrate patience tenderness and kindness rather than trying to manufacture right actions and attitudes let love become your first response and your default position and you're set to launch in any circumstance graciously and to land with no regrets that's it for today God bless you thank you thank you [Music]
