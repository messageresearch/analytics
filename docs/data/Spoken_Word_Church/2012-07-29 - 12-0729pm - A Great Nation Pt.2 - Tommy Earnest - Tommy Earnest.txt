I ask are am I boring anybody and there was only one hand up and that was his so I am not surprised by that by that Revelation that's right all right all right a couple of verses of scripture before we let you sit down Genesis chap 18 Genesis 18 yeah I'm not I'm not I'm not some right here it feels like it's hitting me in the face you know and you know I got a cut lip already you found that out and that was my wife's fault how how can you trace stuff back that many generations for to be yeah I'm good I'm good I'm I'm moving I'm just trying to remember what I was going to say next you not all right here we go Genesis 18 and verse 17 and the Lord said shall I hide from Abraham that thing which I do seeing that Abraham shall surely become this is Genesis 18 did I tell you right 18 and 18 seeing that Abraham shall surely become a great and mighty nation it's going to happen it shall surely happen he will become one and all the nations of the Earth shall be blessed I like verse 19 for today for I know him right wouldn't wouldn't you like that to be said about you when that when that Divine commentary is written for I know him yep you know we think we think we know ourselves sometime you give us enough time we'll find out we don't even know ourselves but for I know him that he will command his children and household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice and judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he has spoken of him let's pray heavenly father today seeing such a nice crowd out this afternoon in the house of the Lord and enjoying the fellowship after our morning meeting and the lunch and getting to shake hands with our friends and and neighbors here Lord we pray that you'll just bless our service this afternoon baptismal service coming up how how wonderful of a time that always is just welcome others into the household of God into the faith into the economy of God some of them maybe just starting their Journey for the first time but but Lord you know them you know them just like you know us we ask you today Lord let the word speak to all of our hearts in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen why don't you shake your neighbor's hand just in case in case y'all do that here yall Shake hand yeah you do okay just making sure I ain't making sure I ain't Crossing no line there you right there you go you can be seated after that amen yeah I I just I just always like a handshake and a smile you know I didn't wear my coat but you know I got one cuz I left it laying up here and so yeah rather than run up and get it and just bring it out so I could take it off again I just left it laying up here so brother W said he don't always wear one and so so I know y'all like me better than you like like him so I fig if he could get away with it then I could too you know but uh yeah I enjoyed lunch and and fellowshipping and getting to see yall again if we miss you we'll get you after and if you if we got you twice and that that's a double blessing for us right and uh we just appreciate it good brother Allan them got to stay around for another service it's always good to we had a nice time of catching up with them so it's good to be here and trust the Lord will I like I said I ain't never done a 10 and two that I can remember I've been preaching I know I look young you're going to be shocked at this but this is I started preaching in November of 1979 79 so in November it'll be 33 years man and U I know y'all are saying wow were you two or three when you started by how young I looking all you know I wasn't Little David I didn't start at 8 or anything like that but man y'all have got so much going on here today we what we we've done so much we had church we had lunch we had we had a shower we had baby announcements we had we had families welcome from around the world and yall just get a lot of stuff going on here you know am all right but it's 2:00 now normally when we have an evening service we got out at 600 is that okay 6:00 2 to 6 y'all will baptize in the dark if I went on longer light got lights oh man we're good then yall just something yeah it's good yes sir well I appreciated your attendance this today and this morning and your attentiveness and I trust the Lord will help you it's all man ain't nothing mysterious no more you know we we we've gone we've gotten old enough I guess and been here long enough that none of us are out there trying to trip the light fantastic and find you know there's people still digging I want to find that secret little quote that nobody else has ever heard yeah let me tell you folks after all these years somebody else has heard it already there's 1192 tapes you're not going to sneak one in that we've never heard before not unless you got one that nobody else has got because the message has has um spread far and wide enough and it has it's made itself available right I I appreciate the availability of them yes sir amen that's right yes sir you remember the old days and I know before computers before internet preachers would show up with quotes and they were in the big volumes a lot of them so we would come out like this remember that yeah and we would hear your groans back there oh man that Guy brought 47 books with him we ain't going to never get out of here see I was there I remember that I came in the message in 1969 and I remember the first fellow that that brought out those trunk loads of books to preach out of and and sure enough he tried to stay all day he did he did fulfill what I was talking about a minute ago and but now we just print them off the computer and I got volumes right here just but we can wave them around y'all don't get as afraid anymore cuz you don't know how long they are or how many we're going to read and so you'll sit there and just be happy until we get to reading them all and then you're like oh he still brought too many but but I I appreciate the availability of the message I don't I don't agree with everything that that Jeffersonville does and the printing and they didn't have to ask me how to do it that's their program that's right God doesn't want me to take care of their program he wants me to take care of my program that's right but there's a whole lot of folks want to run the whole program I mean I me run into some of them every once in a while they got opinions about this guy should be doing that and I mean I think sometimes things that brother Wade ought to be doing but brother Wade don't feel that way and I don't have to run his program brother Sam's prog or your program we just we just try to follow the mind and the leading of the Lord and do the best we can we ain't got to have no big part man everybody for so many years worried about big parts and little parts and and and the guy that thought he had a big part we all ended up feeling like he didn't have no part you ever run into them yeah guys stand up here and try to convince you how big his part was in the economy of God yeah you found that after a while he's just done fell away and ain't got no part the only man deceived in all that really was himself cuz we knew sitting there listening to him that fell surely ain't got no part in this that's right but uh that's how things have went and and it's long I nobody it's from 69 I started preaching in 79 a know one of us that was around in those years that thought we would still be here there a't yeah we we've gotten long in the program just like Abraham was but in the time of its fulfillment it will right it will come to pass amen that's right so we are going to continue with with this little thought on Abraham this morning or this afternoon I'll probably call it morning or evening cuz I don't usually have an afternoon service but but you know which one I mean it's this one right here so if you if you'll put up a little quote there out of Abraham and his seat after him brother brandom says this he says now notice he perfectly typed Abraham and his seed after him all of brother brandom's preaching about Abraham right was not to just let us know there was a great patriarch that had great exactly you know the beginning of Christianity the beginning of our Salvation all of those things we looked at this morning it was not just so that we would have the great man Abraham to follow after right and neither did we have William brandham in the end time just to have the Great William brandham for us to follow amen that's right brother brandom said in one place and I wish I'd have brought that quote now that I'm thinking of it he says he says you know we're not doing this to build a monument to the great William Brandon we're we're here to follow the lord Jesus Christ through that message through that word I don't dress like him I don't have the right belt buckles to look like him I don't have the right hats to right or the bolo ties or I don't have any of that I'm just in some people's minds is not even in the message yeah because that's what the message was to them but brother brandom says this in in Abraham and his seed he says now notice he perfectly tiped Abraham and his seed after him now this is a tremendous message it's 1961 in Bloomington Illinois called Abraham and his seed after him and he says and notice how he says this he says and I'm going to follow follow the Junctions of Abraham's life and then follow the Junctions of Abraham's seed right and see if God kept his word letter by letter right rightly so Abraham wasn't there just so we could have a great hero of the faith but he was there to live he was there to live a life right and brother Brandon says we're going to follow the Junctions of his life and then we're going to follow the Junctions of his seed now Abraham we know and let me get back to it that there's only one way that we can be saved Y and that is being in the Covenant with Abraham because it was made to Abraham but the Bible said we being in Christ we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and our HS with Abraham is that right Christ is the Royal Seed of Abraham out of Abraham Isaac out of Isaac Jacob out of Jacob Joseph so forth on down David and on and on so and so till finally the Royal seed was born which was Christ and in Christ made Abraham the father of all Nations and the abrahamic Covenant is confirmed to the people or given to the people here's our word what is it un conditionally amen right unconditionally means with no condition attached amen that was Abraham walking along we read it this morning Heathen idolator farmer Berry picker animal Slayer you probably like that didn't you deer hunters brother said Abraham went out in the bush and killed his Noonday meal yeah I saw you Hunters out out there amen yes my brother I like that that's right and all you animal rice people were saying oh no not Abraham surely he wasn't out there killing those poor animals see you you got to preach to everybody everybody same quote but a different reaction right all of you kindhearted bleeding hearted pea people yeah that won't wear fur what's wrong with them people brother brandom said our father Abra went out there and killed his Noonday meal that's right amen rise slay and eat is that is that the model we all live by I'm in Georgia I can say that can't go up north to them liberals and say that no they don't even want you to have a gun see and I'm not working for the NRA I want you to know that but just wanted to throw that him but that's what brother R said every he was just living an old normal life that's right and God came and said I am going to do this for you that's right I am going to do it for you you ain't going to do nothing on yourself you're going to have a great nation and I'm going to give you a Barren wife to make sure that you understand this is my program I love that amen I love that but this is what brother random said we're going to follow the Junctions of Abraham life and then follow the Junctions of Abraham's seed so what brother brandom is telling you is and I did a little chart up here I gave it to the brothers in the back they are technologically savvy enough to bring this up and I just simply took that message Abraham and his seat after him and if you'll go down through it at home you will find brother brandham taking each these seven Junctions of Abraham's life you'll say and then after that he did this and then after that God did that and so what brother Ram basically did in that message was took the Junctions of Abraham's life he started with his calling I went ahead and grabbed some scripture verses so that if you look at this at home later let me just say this every one of these Junctions is more than a message in itself if y'all want to have me back for a twoe Revival I take two nights on each one and when you could finally cover all of those Junctions of Abraham's life but otherwise we're just we just take the summary like brother random gave us first was his calling that was our text for this morning right he then went on down to what was a part of that calling was a separation he says after he was called he was required to separate right now again Paul looked back in the what did we call it this morning the um oh what was that term the God's God's estimation of Abraham right where he did nothing wrong and when brother randam got down to the separation Paul says you know every Everything Abraham did he staggered not at the promise of God he did everything just right but if you remember when he separated yeah he didn't quite separate the way God had told him to do why he brought a lot along with him brought his nephew along and brother Ram said yet when Paul looked at that he couldn't even see it he couldn't even remember it right right oh don't you see it but there's the separation we get on over then brother brandom talked about God then came and confirmed that Covenant to him you remember the split sacrifice that's more than two nights of meeting right there that split sacrifice the smoking furnace came down between him right the third state or the fourth stage then was when he met him and in just one little verse brother Brandon preached some tremendous tremendous things when God introduced him to Abraham as elh the many breast in he strengthened him he came and he strengthened Abraham for the rest of the journey and also for receiving the promised son right after he strengthened him in Genesis 17 and5 brother brand said he placed him he changed his name in Genesis 181 the one of the last visitations he appeared to him on the plains of mamory right shortly after that there was one more Junction that brother brandom identifies in Abraham's life and that was that he not only changed him back to a young man and woman again as him and Sarah but he also healed them because they were not he said you change them back and they're still going to be be Barren they're still going to be sterile they're still going to be infer right and then after those seven Junctions of Abraham's life then came the promised son that you know it it it it really wasn't much of a mystery to me after I studied this out and went over that message over and over again that there was seven Junctions of Abraham's life that brother Bram identified right remind you of anything else you ever heard of before let's see you know you got that's pyramid kind of remind me seem like there's seven of those before the Capstone come out that's right there it is see just just the same thing so I want I only wanted to drop that in and get you to understand what brother ad is saying we're going to look at the Junctions of his life and let me say to each one of you Believers sitting here you you've had to go through every one of those Junctions right it's just like stature of a perfect man you're not going to get to the Capstone until all seven have become a part of your existence right justification you know the the first level brother on up through the temperance and patience and godliness I know there's a lot of preaching on stature of a perfect man and I know the Thunders people messed it up for a long time yeah and there's been all kinds of excellent teaching there's been all kinds of erroneous teaching on the Statue of a perfect man but here was Abraham walking through those same steps going through each each phase just like just just like the statue of a perfect man and so every one of you is Believers you got to go through every one of them you know I mean I mean you have to you have to see yourself identified in the separation in the confirming of the Covenant in the strengthening and in the placing in God appearing to you amen it's there for you and and and that was the purpose of Abraham's walk was so that the believer Abraham and his seed and his seed after him amen do you believe that amen and his seed and that's why you know brother brandham as he approached these messages Abraham and his seat after him he said now this is a very timely message he said I've already preached it two or three times he said this is my third time and then he went to Chicago the very next week and he preached it again the very same thing so he was he was trying to reinforce to the people that follow your steps along with faithful Abraham this is this and you will find yourself in there and God will visit you and do every one of those things for youw if you need strength he will strengthen you right it's just there's a study in each one but I just wanted to put that up for you amen we're going to look at at since we found out this morning it was not not the Flesh of Abraham right that God built the kingdom of B we want to discover what it was and and brother bandam in many places gives us a hand go back to our verse there in Genesis 18 and verse 19 I love those words for I know right him I know him what what you know we could just go on and quit and go home after I know him amen before I know him just let that sink in you know we're not just we're not just a church down in Lula Georgia you know we're not we're you're not just you're not you know how did you everyone get here I'm sitting down there in Fellowship today and I'm finding out where where's where's who people in your that are here visiting from New Mexico where are they sitting at where's the new there they are she's got a a first cousin in our church in witch talk y'all figure that out there he is in fellowship with us right he's from Kansas now was in Colorado there I don't know the I missed half the story you know how bad I am on details we are having a baptism a I just want to make sure I understood that right but here she is I don't know these people they're from New Mexico right I'm from Tennessee originally lived in Canada lived in Florida I'm in Kansas now and in our assembly she's got a first cousin sitting there every week fellowshipping with us am man how it it's not like we're just random folks that wandered in off the street and became a part of the economy of God we are sitting here like Abraham wait a minute I know you you belong there what did Brother brandom tell brother green I've heard brother Perry green tell this many times when brother brandom went back through his family lineage yeah he said he brought your great-grandfather over here in Russia man this thing just falling off today not leave it alone oh leave it alone it's okay it be down around my ankles here sorry Lou yeah told Brother green said your great great grandmother over here in Russia and your grandfather over here and he brought them and they went here and then here and here and you were in Texas and then tracked it right down yep I wish he would have done that for me but I was too little I wasn't old enough it wasn't my lot in life but I'm glad for that because it lets us know we're not just just apples in a bushel here and all of a sudden we're just another knot on the log right brother every one of us can identify in that scripture for I know him God called your name he called your name right amen oh you're saying he called Tom Ernest that no he didn't necessarily call that but there was an election amen God built his kingdom on the heart of Abraham right amen let me read you a couple of quotes and I gave them to the brothers back there to follow along it was the heart it wasn't the Flesh of Abraham God built the kingdom upon it was the heart and this is in a message called Faith Charlotte it's all right I'm I'm I'm not going to lose it you keep do IET okay it's in a message called faith brother bandam says so Abraham 75 years old married to his Half Sister Sarah they come down from Cala dwelt in the shinar lived a good long lives of people then they'd go out in the morning and get some berries there's some similar quote to what we read go out noon time kill an animal with a bow or a spear didn't say nothing bu no rifle did he no so if you all if you Hunter men want to follow in the line of Abraham you have to go out and kill an animal with a bow or a spear come on that's how we get our meat around wiah go with a bow and a spear and we get our meat we're talking about ordinary went out with a bow or a spear and had their proteins few berries go to bed and lived a good normal life but this man not because he was different but because God and brother said oh I just love to push it down see right because God saw Grace in the heart of Abraham that's right and saved him by election amen wasn't what he looked like wasn't who his parents was wasn't how long he had been in the message wasn't if he had ever heard the message he's a heathen he's an idolator walking along and God says I know him I don't know him about what he looks like I don't know him by his physical characteristics I don't know him by his Good Deeds right amen I don't know him because he's a great politician in the city right I know him because in his heart it was the heart of Abraham that God built right the kingdom of and he push it down brother BR says because God saw Grace in the heart of Abraham and saved him by election give him the promise you haven't chose me y you haven't chose me I chose you oh man people said people said I just toiled and wrestle seeking God oh no that's right oh no he's changing our mind about about our election isn't it yes sir well I just toiled and wrestle seeking God oh no it was God seeking you you just wouldn't turn loose no man seeks God no man has s God at any time man is a coward he runs from God but God seeks man oh don't you believe that in the message Jehovah Gyra Abraham in his heart knew them were not ordinary men yeah those three that walked up there talking to him on the notice he run in real quick says Sarah get your sifter on and on that quote goes Abraham in his heart in Jehovah gar 57 Indianapolis now notice Abraham just an ordinary man but God by election Sovereign Grace called Abraham when there's many young men in the land in in that day there was probably some more capable of doing the job you know what he's talking about they probably had fertile wives yeah come on there other guys could have been a great nation they didn't marry Barren women right that's what he's trying to tell you there was probably some more capable of doing the job as the world would think than Abraham was but God knows the heart that's it sometimes we wonder how God takes the foolish things to confound the wise but God knows the heart of man oh he goes on now oh here we go men he said now you people when you're selecting your pastors you usually slip the guy in great big seven-footer with curly hair and so forth man I ain't talking about Lula Georgia is he I know seven-footer curly hairs Hollywood type yeah not him no sir he ain't talking to y'all skip that one over sometimes God don't even choose you want somebody that'll be a mixer it'll go to the card party with you and set in the game man wants mixers but God wants separators I just threw that in for extra measure that wasn't part of our lesson at all but do you see over and over let me read you another Abraham was sitting poor in the minority sitting out under the oak tree he R this is be certain of God he raised up his eyes saw three man coming they look like men dust on their clothes they said they were strangers they were passing through but there was something in the heart of Abraham that he know they were more than men it's the heart the heart over and over amen the marriage of the Lamb Phoenix 1962 remember the Holy Spirit was what cut into your heart and come up here just think of the places he cut and that person will never live that down they'll always remember if our hearts condemn us not right but when you come with something in the word of God and you bypass it that's not Abraham seed Abraham kept the promise of God in his heart regardless of what come or went you know what come or went ishma come and went his trip down to ABC come and went but go Abraham kept the promise of God in his heart it was not the failings right it was it was the story that Paul told of Abraham the heavenly vision that God had of Abraham that's right that's why brothers and sisters when when El when we were told in Malachi 4 that Elijah was going to come yeah why why does this scripture Escape us so often right why does intellectualism seep into this message when the word of God in Mal when Elijah was promised to come you know it I don't need to turn and read it you don't need it to on the screen behold I will send you Elijah the prophet and he shall turn the our hearts hearts of the people right back to the father he shall turn the hearts right Elijah came to deal with the heart it's it's a far cry from what so many places in this message has become right amen a lot of churches believe that Elijah came to turn the neck yeah yeah yeah the next big thing that they hear something new and they jerk around and that's what Elijah came to do yeah he they think that Elijah came to just have great Sensational things to talk about right he didn't come to turn our necks right certainly our minds have been renewed we've had to get a new mind but he came to turn the heart the kingdom of Abraham Abraham's seed is built upon the heart of Abraham oh don't you see it that's right amen it was the heart the heart the heart over and over let me read you a couple of more I've got a few of them here and they're and they're all just so good they're all so good brother random over and over it was the heart it was something in his heart right he was an ordinary man and God looked at his ordinariness and he wasn't interested in that right let me just say that again he wasn't interested in Abraham's ordinariness right sometimes we hold our ordinariness up as a badge of honor yeah he's not interested in that either right what did Brother BR say in perfect strength by Perfect weakness he takes the nobodies to become the somebody right and he said in that quote he said now you may be a somebody and God can turn you into nobody so he can make you a somebody again but it's the heart it is the heart the unconditional Covenant that God gave Amen to the heart there is one more quote that I want to read on that and for those of you that are being baptized I want you to think of this one especially today this is in the indictment way down in 1963 brother bam says look at that little old ill Fame woman she recognized it you know he's talking about the woman at the well she wasn't he judges your heart what you want to be exactly why did the little woman's testimony means so much to brother brandom I I'm not what I want to be but I know I ain't what I used to be right right right I'm not what I ought to be and but she wanted to be in the perfect image of God he judges your heart what you want to be she didn't want none of that stuff when this flashed before her that's what she wanted right amen no matter what she was then she was ready to come right God judges the heart man judges the outward appearance God looks upon the heart no matter what she was that light flashed and that settled it she caught it the essence of eternal life you want to catch some Essence just sit under that word and when that that's what's these candidates coming for baptism the light has flashed in front of them and they want that right amen they want that the best we can do is look at him and say not looking so good maybe but it's the heart that God looks at and let me promise you one thing brothers and sisters if you get the heart right the rest of it is going to follow that's what's wrong with people you're not going to sit here this ill Fame woman didn't go back to her old lifestyle but when her heart was turned when her heart was changed next thing you know the rest of it began to line up right and I know what you're all sitting there thinking you well I've known a lot of people I I've heard this a lot I've known a lot of people they look right on the outside but they're wrong on the inside y'all ever run across any of them yeah yeah well I know them they say they're right on the inside but they're wrong on the outside yeah let me tell you something you can be right on the outside you can have everything perfect according to this message you can have hair dress everything you can have it just right and be wrong on the inside but I can promise you you cannot be right on the inside and stay wrong on the outside you know that you been you know if that heart turns when Malachi turns that heart back to the word right you will not continue in your errors you will not and God will judge you on what you want to be so if you're brand you if you're just now starting the journey it don't matter if I've been here 40 years or brother Sam's been here 60 years Years or or how long these other people have been in the word from the moment your heart is turned you just caught up I want understand you just caught up we don't have to go down the Romans road like the Baptist do you know to be a good Baptist you got to go down the Romans road you know you got to do everything this verse this verse some of those SEALS or statue of a perfect man people you got to have faith then tempers and patience and you got to get them one after the other yeah if you got here 40 seconds ago and when your heart was turned to this word right you just caught up you are even the ground is level at the foot of the cross my dear brother and sisters and when your heart turns we're not worried about the outside it might look a little scruffy right now but with the heart following the body is going to follow right and that is a that I appreciate what our brother Dale said this morning the works that we are that we manifest in our life that is an appreciation for what God has done right amen it's not V a it's appreciation I don't cut my hair just to prove that I believe the message I just do it I don't want no long hair you know right you sisters don't wear your clothes right just because you're supposed to that's right you didn't come to church today just because you were supposed to right come on you came because something drew you drew you he judges your heart what you want to be and every time we slip up like Abraham did like Moses did did like every every other Saint in the Bible did like our own Prophet did every time we slip up and make a mistake there's something in our heart says we don't want that and God judges you on what you want to be not what you are I mean I might stumble my toe every other day right I like that you know that's why he let Peter fall in the water right you know if he had to let Peter fall on the land you know what the Catholics would have done they' have built a church right on top of that spot they' have picked that spot where Peter fell on the ground and they have built a church and said this spot right here there's a little hole there where Peter fell a little divot in the ground yeah this is Peter's holy hole right here this is this is what we got but he let him fall in the water so you know that when he picked him up there was no trace of it left behind wasn't no marker left yeah it's like fishing putting X on the bottom of your boat that's where you know where the fish are come on see you fish from under laughing y'all done done that ain't you right yeah that's what he said to Peter put a mark right here on the boat that's where you fell yeah but he don't remember it because when he lifted him up the waters closed in there was no reminder because he knew what Peter wanted to be and oh that helped Peter so much cuz he went out and he lived a good life after that really come on I'm looking at Peter now like brother here's Peter in the garden when they were going to arrest Jesus he draws out his sword yeah come on if y'all really think he was aiming at that guy's ear y'all are badly mistaken yeah he misfired yeah Peter misfired his General intentions was to take care of that man that was arresting our Lord but he misfired instead of getting the loing it off right at the neck he only got the ear right maybe it got dodged I don't know what happened but Peter misfired on the sword and Jesus said put your sword up you don't want to be that way right how many of y'all have ever misfired every once in a while oh yeah how many of y'all been wielding The Sword and you misfired come on come on you misfired that brother over there ought to not be doing that instead of helping him up yeah instead of lifting him up when we see our brother down as the prophet taught us to do we misfire with the sword some of us got a pile of ears laying around our feet come on because we don't know I don't know what God wants out of you I don't know what God wants out of our brother here and our sister here and every one of you sitting out there amen but I know that if your heart is in the right place you will manifest you will come to the full fruit of what God wants out of you but if I sit around and try to do it I'm going to carve you up just like Peter did I'm going to you shouldn't do this and you should do that and you I've had so many people tell me what I ought and not not to do I got a quote where brother Randon was talking about when he he promised that the Lord told him he was going to have a son his name was going to be Jo Joseph you remember that brother said that woman there in the city was trying to run my life you remember that quote I should have brought it it's a good one he said she was trying to tell and she sent out a letter criticizing when when when the the girl was born and and criticizing brother R he said that's just a woman that thinks she ought to be able to tell me how I ought to live my life and how things ought to be done I wouldn't want to be her but that's all I'm saying to you brothers and sisters if if it was left in our hands what you ought to do you ought to do or you we'd just be carving each other up I said we'd have a bag of years to go home with before it was over because we'd be slicing and dicing and cutting up everybody to our satisfaction but you don't know what God wants with me and I don't know what he wants with you and it ain't none of my business because I know if your heart is turned the holy spirit will come and I'm supposed to pray for you that you will recognize the leading of the Holy Spirit as he comes to you I'm not supposed to come along and and change your style of life or do this for you or that for you I am to pray for you I am to ask the Lord that he because if I change you you're going to unchange Anyway come on how many of us have ever affected a great change on somebody if I can talk you into something somebody's going to come along and can talk you out of it but if it's a revelation if God reveals to your heart this is wrong in my life Lord I Surrender it to you and he takes it away that's right how many of you in your smoking years ever throw them cigarettes away at new years's just to see where the pack landed you wanted to quit it was a good intention that's why brother brand didn't like resolutions he didn't like resolutions he liked deliverance and when God takes it from you it's gone there and my job is not to oh yeah we get all offended sometimes we hear those stories about brother random going to visit a sick man taking him a cart and a cigarettes oh man wind done went out of this place now ain't it not brother brand yeah yeah oh man that that's hurting some feelings right there I can tell we don't mention that in the pull pit to but think about it they did they did sure did that's on testimony you know what happened right amen you know what happened I heard brother Charlie Cox one time telling a story I don't know him I've never met him but I heard him on testimony he was telling a story about when they' first come into the message and brother R come surprised them driving up in their yard one day and said y'all may have heard this before sister Cox was out there hoing the Garden in a pair of blue jeans well you know what that's going to do to you know you just a new Christian you know you you want to be living right ought to be doing better and and and she just got all over beside herself he said just just really embarrassed and apologizing brother Brown said that's s right sister I've been thinking about getting my wife prepared just like that oh yeah there's your new doctrine is you know that wasn't right what was he knew if her heart turns he ain't got to worry about that no more we just make it our business way too early sometimes right I don't know I don't know why I said all that it's the heart on the heart of Abraham the kingdom of God was built on the heart of Abraham and your election is built on your heart not your standing in society not your good looks not your wealth or your lack thereof oh yeah we man I was raised in the South I'm a Tennessee boy yeah I knew what it was to keep them poor and keep them humble I know I mean I know what that was you had to have poor churches you couldn't have no money running around yeah couldn't preacher didn't deserve the Nickels he got yeah come on y'all been there yeah there had to be some money around some places somebody was telling me today about a sermon they heard where a brother was talking about about those Apostles and how they had somebody floating around among them every once in a while yeah thing you know those are things we just don't like to think about but that that's all I'm saying to you as we get in our mind exactly what everybody all look like act like do right passing opinions and yet our Prophet said when you see a brother struggling just just just don't go slice him up don't go don't go chew him up just lift him up pray for that brother let the same holy spirit that some Grace for you have some Grace in his life let it be so Lord he judges your heart what you want to be man judges the outward appearance that's all we got to go on I'm not a prophet if I knew your heart I could judge your heart right that's why those prayer lines were as special as they were right because he knew he discerned between the thoughts and the intents of the heart right don't you see there's the thoughts of the heart and there's also the intents of the heart and that's why they I believe it was Peter wrote over there even if our heart condemn us God is greater than our heart and he knows all things oh yeah your heart will mislead you sometime but it when it gets turned you go over there and read Corinthians when your heart turns to the Lord the veil is taken all and all of a sudden that word is new to you again that's all you can see is the unfolded word and all of a sudden every other part of your body just begins to fall into subjection it just falls into line right it's not because we got to do it it's just what we want to do man alive I'm out smoking all the cigarettes I want to smoke these days come on I drink all I want sister June was bothering us the other day on the text bother what do you want to drink when you get here what she knew I like die she was checking on everybody else and she just kept asking so I told my wife just tell her I want some Bud Light yeah she didn't ask us no more questions but I just want to inform y'all today I am just like brother brandom I drink all I want to drink I just enjoy all I want to enjoy I don't want none of it why because my heart has been turned to the word and it has led me to a more perfect way a more perfect deliverance and I never did drink so I wouldn't even know if I like but light or not amen it's the only one I could think of and she didn't buy me just let her all through it just so youall know he judges your heart he man judges the outward God looks amen upon the heart upon the heart for don't forget that brothers and sisters it was built upon the heart of Abraham for I know him I know him I I know him go back to Genesis 18 I know him I know him for I know him and and he will command his children glory and his household after him and they shall keep the way of the Lord to do justice in judgment that the Lord may bring upon Abraham that which he hath spoken of him yep that's our verse brothers and sisters there we are that he may bring upon us that which is spoken of us that he will fulfill we are in the hour of fulfillment right amen that's why there's not any great books written about escapades and and things going on here in the end time we're not writing another book of Acts because we are the last generation someone someone is going to fulfill Thessalonians 4 1 Corinthians 15 and we have been chosen and that's why I said this morning I wasn't being critical of people that want to go home I want to go home I just want to go and fulfill that word on my way out right I want to go home there's a promise laying here right that that is brother Bron picked up his pen and wrote and and the words came flowing out of that pen as she nears him she will be so much like him she will be in his very imageen there's a promise laying there that there's a little elected bride that's going to look like him she's going to walk like him she's going to talk like him she's going to think like him because her heart has been turned amen that's right ordinary people with an extraordinary heart that's what we're preaching about today amen Ordinary People a couple of more of those let me just read you a couple the calling of Abraham God seeing what was going to happen he made his Co Covenant after the world had gotten full of wickedness and so forth that went into Babylon God was searching out across the lands to try to find somebody who was honest in heart somebody he could give blessings to and of all the people there was in the land God by Sovereign election chose Abraham amen look at his next question how many Christians is here tonight let's see your hand well I believe it's about 100% that's fine 100% Christians then I want to tell you something it isn't very easy to say before Sinners do you know why you're a Christian y you ever ask yourself that you ever stop say why am I a Christian well I was just born in the church down not the right answer right do you know why you're a Christian well my mom is a Christian brother brand covered that so many times it's not a pedigree deal here it's because your great great granddaddy was a Christian and then your mama and your daddy or your mama or your family or whoever do you know why you're a Christian because God called you amen amen you never did SE God at any time it's God seeking you no man at any time has ever sought God that's no man right that's right and Abraham's Grace Covenant brother bam said now it's not Abraham if you'll do a certain thing we got to get that do in a certain thing out of our mind not if you'll do a certain thing I'll make a great nation of you he said I have done it amen remember the promises all together Grace all together Grace and no law mixed in it at all not any ifs at all it's absolutely God's choosing of Abraham now even if you don't agree with some of this let's just give it prayerful consideration amen now you see it isn't what you're done what you done what your desires are it wasn't Abraham's desire he was a heathen right he come down from the Tower of Babel down in the valley of Shar in the land of the calans he was just an ordinary man nothing Abraham done not even his desires but God by grace and election chose Abraham that's the way he chose you not nothing you done what he done amen now remember to Abraham and his seed and his seed oh brother and sisters man how long I've been going seem like forever you all right man I got 89 more pages is that all right just making sure brother wait said it was okay oh what else can we say about you know go back quickly to Exodus chapter one tie it right in I want you to see this ex we read it this morning I like those first few words now these these are the names these are the names there was 70 went in you know how many names God knew all 70 right he wasn't surprised wait a minute who are you why are you why you trying to sneak down there in Egypt with my children yeah these are the names of the children that went into Egypt he knowed every one of them he named off the Patriarchs ex he didn't only know who Joseph was but he know where he was living at the time Glory that's why if you pray for a man I want to just say that he knows where everybody's living at come on we don't have to tell God you know my brother down there he's having such a struggle well I don't know maybe he's already been delivered of that maybe he got delivered 10 minutes ago and I didn't know about him right it's like that man that was chewing tobacco when brother Bram walked up on him and said you chew back he said no he said when did you quit just now just now he's delivered he's quit right but not only did God know the names of the 70 but he knew where they were living at right and he knew Joseph and he was already down there in Egypt right and so Joseph goes in with all 70 of course they begin to grow but now let me ask you another question when 2 million came out of there got to think big now he knew those 70 names these are the names when those 2 million came out of there how many names do you think he knew right oh he knew 1,997 200 no he knew all 2 million of them every name whether they were reprobate he knew the names of Coran and abum let me show you a scripture that I like over here in Exodus it's in chapter 32 follow just flip on over a few few pages there believe that's right Exodus Exodus 31 and verse two is what we're looking for I I just found this very interesting because he said about those 70 going in there I know their names but in Exodus 31 there's a big multitude now there they're fixing to build a tabernacle and the Lord spake unto Moses saying see I have called by name right bezel amen the son of Yuri bezel who's that he's the one that God knew who his name was right I have called by name bezel the son of Yuri the son of her right the of the tri I have filled him with the spirit of wisdom or the spirit of God and wisdom and understanding and knowledge in all manner of workmanship to devise cunning Works to work in gold and silver brass cutting of stones to set them and carving of Timber to work in all manner of workmanship and I behold I have given with him he know another guy so we know there's at least two folks in you right bezel and a holab the son of a a isach yeah of the tribe of Dan right why did God write that in there are we really that concerned with who helped Moses build a tabernacle right I ain't seen none of y'all not naming your children Bez and a holy AB yeah yeah but it's a point he's trying to make a point I have called by name this man to do this specific job right and he's going to need a Helper and his name is going to be a holab we're going to have Bez and holy I mean they're going to do these things because they're good at it right how many believe God would only call you for what you're good at right amen that's right oh yeah no nobody wants to think about that brother said a young man will come in and get converted one night and he'll be up wanting preach the next day and he said it don't work like that right God calls a man for what he's good at now granted some of us wander along a long time we found out what we're good at we get down to the end of our lives and we look back and we're not sure we were good at anything yeah yeah but it happens he calls a man according to his gifts right and he knows them by name Moses over there flip over to Exodus 35 after God told this to Moses a few chapters later in Exodus 35 he goes over there in verse 30 and Moses said unto the children of Israel see the Lord hath called by name yeah he he was a faithful Minister God said look see I want you to know I've got these two guys and Moses said look I'm going to have these two guys do this and it ain't my choosing right the Lord has called him by name right amen but all all we we all know where this what this brother ought to be doing and that brother ought to be doing and the Lord says I know what he ought to be doing and if you don't like what he's doing you ask God about that right because that's what God told him to do right don't you see I I've known him by name it's it's that's why brother brand said one of these days we're not going to be we're not going to hear him call William brandom and it's not it's not that he said I'm not the son of Charles and El branam anymore he knows me by name amen oh Brothers it's all of Grace amen it is all of Grace it's no you're going to have Works yes James got over there and he got all confounded about what Paul said about all Grace and he said how can Grace be manifest unless we have some Works along with it and I agree with James and I agree with Peter and Paul and all the rest of them they're both right right sure it is the heart that will turn the heart will be changed and The Works will follow it the works that's sir brother said if you come up on parts of the word and you can't agree with it you're not even Abraham's seed there's proof that's why when those Jews came to him over there in the Book of John and Jesus was preaching to him and they said We believe We Believe yeah and Jesus said oh yeah you believe if you will continue in my word then are you my disciples not coming up to one part and stopping but if you continue in my word Glory then y are you my disciples indeed do you believe it's all of Grace I believe in grace so great Grace Grace God's Grace Grace that is greater than all my that's right now A man under under legalism he can't stand much grace right you know a guy under grace he can take a whole lot of legalism right but a legalist ain't going to take no Grace you know he don't believe it's nothing in Grace got to be your works and what you do but I am a Grace preacher Grace it was grace that brought Abraham along the journey and God called him and and then and then in the Easter seal brother I said when that light flashes before him when a four day Son of God sees that word of God he rises and goes to me amen brothers and sisters we're living in a day yeah I know and I got so many notes on this the seed is about run out y that's why this church ain't bigger than it is it ain't packed out it ain't thousands of people sitting in here yeah why because the the early the beginning of our Christianity started out slow and it's winding slow right I I know there's churches that are 5,000 people and 10,000 people in other countries and and God keeps the records on all of that right but brother brandham kept making those quotes over when Jesus said There Will Be Few that are saved he meant few amen he didn't mean millions and billions he meant few that's right few few it is a small number compared to the the size of the world compared to the volumes of people right that there are in this world I drove past almost all of them on my way here yeah right we sat up there on I 85 the other day we were coming out of Richmond we got down the road and and the Lord is gracious to us I I want to testify this my wife and I just we hadn't been on I 85 but just a few minutes we decided it's about lunch time we'll get us a sandwich we pull off got our got our got our lunch there we was going to eat it in the car just so we could get on down here and have some more time with brother Wade and we get get in the road and we go just a few miles and we're dead stopped for over an hour right in the of I 85 if we hadn't stopped and got that lunch we'd have probably been right down there two more miles later where that car yeah and those two trucks tangled up we sat there for an hour there must have been a 100 miles of cars behind us by the time they let us get rolling wow but we just sat there stopped for an hour now you know me and and I'm so spiritual I I was sitting there just praising the Lord no I was sitting there frustrated come on yes honey let's thank the Lord that we are stopped in the road no yeah I was like all them mother drivers what's going on up there yeah get those bums out of the street come on but yet I don't know the plan of God for some reason there I was and I've had enough of brother weight already so I'm leaving tomorrow so it all worked out good it all worked out just fine amen God's plan amen whatever it is don't don't get all frustrated don't get all angry at that person that Zooms in in front of you and steals that parking spot right woo man right bro you don't need to shake no fist right or Worse don't need to do that maybe that guy they're parking by was just going to slam their car door right into them that could have been your car had they not stole it from you is that too simple is that good is that all right I remember a testimony and I'm going to share this and I'm going to quit but I remember a testimony I was hearing a man he he was in the meeting he he testified this in brother bisc Church some years ago I don't remember the man's name but he was in that meeting in Phoenix when this day the scriptures fulfilled when he was preaching birth pain ex and and he was telling this testimony and he said you know he said I'm standing in the back of the room brother brandham can't find his scripture and he says all of a sudden this Catholic priest walk up there and he's he's telling brother brandom here read it out of my book and he says I'm standing back there in the back he he he he made a motion he said I'm standing back there against the wall and I'm hitting my fist against the wall thinking why don't that Catholic priest sit down and shut up up there why that's what we would be doing what's that man doing interrupting our Prophet on a day like this he said I'm sitting back there knocking my fist against the wall and saying sit down already let him get on with his message what are you doing up there and he said a lot of us were around talking about it afterward we were frustrated that that Catholic priest would actually walk up there and hand him the book yeah yeah come on and he said it really bothered me until the next night until the next day when brother random came along and said did you see what happened last night exactly he said there he was handing him the book just like it was over there in Luke and he took the book and he sat down and this day this scripture is fulfilled that man said I felt about this tall when I heard the explanation of what God was doing because here I was all frustrated with it we want we're hot and we're sweating and we're wanting to get on with the meeting and God is fulfilling his word and I'm so un unbeknownst to the mind of God for everything around me that I don't even know what's going on but a prophet comes and tells me that's what was being done and it was done for a purpose and the Word was being being fulfilled right in front of you right and I'm standing there knocking on the wall thinking wish that Catholic preest down right we' have done the same thing that's how spiritual we are are we so spiritually in tune that we're going to know the which turn to make no we're just going to live right you know why we're just going to go out and live tomorrow because we're ordinary man right we are just right ordinary you have the musicians come let me read you a quote while they're coming just an ordinary man yeah don't forget this quote in message of Grace when Paul wrote Abraham's commentary he never mentioned one thing about Abraham's unbelief it never was even accounted to him you know why it wasn't accounted to him because when he believed and God accounted it to him for righteousness nothing else could be accounted to and if you have been accounted righteous my dear brothers and sisters there is nothing can be counted against it don't matter how many enemies rise up and point fingers at you and try to accuse the accuser of our Brethren is cast down we don't listen to him anymore he's still accusing he's still standing up he's still bringing up our flaws and our blemishes but it don't matter it don't matter oh my so many I know you want me to read all these but it's 3 3:30 already so let me let me get to this one more I got to read you one more this bear with me hang on there and man look I didn't know I brought all these and I gave the guys in the bat more than this this is in that message we were telling about to Abraham and the seed after him we're going to get down on ourselves every once in a while before this journey is over sure we're going to have mistakes but the commentary the Divine commentary says you never did it right here's this is in that message Abraham in the seat after him brother BR says he's speaking as if the congregation is said well I'll tell you brother brandom I'm not worthy of healing I've just got through telling you it's nothing you've done it's what he done you keep thinking you're unworthy here he's going to give us an example of what that means to God he says here what if an old mayor back here in Bible time would have give birth to a little cult say he had a mule and the mule was born and both ears was flopped down his tail stuck straight up his eyes was crossed his knees was bowed together well if he could look in the glass and think he'd just say woe is me they'll never feed me cuz he looked so bad his ears was flopped down his tail stuck up his eyes was crossed his knees was B together he'd look in the mirror and say woe is me they'll never feed me they'll just knock me in the head when they come out and see me but what if his mother was well instructed in the law You' say wait a minute honey wait a minute I know you're a horrible looking creature you're no good but you're going to live right because there's a law of God that say you are born under the Earth right why do you want to be a presbyterian why don't why don't you go back and be a Pentecostal like it was the first he says see you you were born under a Birthright right if you were born under a Birthright you know what's going to happen what's going to take place in the morning when they come out to the pastor to see you you know what they're going to do they're not going to knock you in the head because you're going to live yeah it's is he's going to reach over and get a lamb without a blemish on it and they'll take that lamb that don't even have a blemish and that lamb will have to die in your stead the priest will the priest will never even see you amen do you see it don't look at yourself look at your sacrifice God don't look at you he looks at your sacrifice which is Christ don't look at yourself I'm not worthy you're not worthy nobody's worthy but he is the one amen I'm not counting on what I've done what I am i' never I'd never make it but I'm looking to what he done that's where I'm trusting what he done He's My Sacrifice I'm not worthy of healing no sir I ought have died long ago I have never even been born but I live and I've got eternal life and I'm going to heaven why because he done it for me he took my place right brother brand said I was not need crossy in every kind of condition but he took my place spiritually speaking I was all twisted up and all messed up but he took my place so he makes me a perfect Son of God a perfect daughter of God his sacrifice did it for mine did it not mine I had nothing to do with it I was born all out of shape anyhow right I don't trust in what I done I trust on what he do amen let's stand our feet y'all sing that song he wasn't there looking at me when he took me in no okay pick another one no no man no
