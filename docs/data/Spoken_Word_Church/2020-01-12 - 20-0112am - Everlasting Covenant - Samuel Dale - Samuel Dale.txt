the service and just have a good time in the Lord because that's what we're all here for anyway right if you'd like turn in your scriptures turn to First Corinthians 14 and we'll read just one verse and then we'll go into our others 1 Corinthians 14 now remember by way of announcements uh the Lord willing where's Aaron is he in the back he's back there okay Aaron you preaching tonight I mean Wednesday night he got the message okay now don't get that Aaron or the next Aaron okay all right brother Aaron will be preaching for us this coming Wednesday okay fellowship meeting Saturday 3:30 and that's coming up so get everything ready all for it uh sister uh Esther wants to meet with all of are the sisters after the about 1:15 today to where she can kind of get some things to tell you what we need to do and whatever to be done so contact sister Esther about that and meet at 1:15 all right now the Lord willing this afternoon after the evening service will'll be running down to the down to terrence's house and have a baptismal service Zach wants to get baptized he wants it done today so Zach black so that's that's one we want to get him done today if he wants it today we'll we'll take off okay brother Aaron McGary I guess the way you pronounce it close we'll be preaching the fellowship meeting and also the uh both the Sunday services and everything set up all right uh so let's see sister Esther make sure I get them all I'll try to forget everything brother Ernie villain noo will be here with us on the 9th now we originally announced that he would be here the 16th I think but we had to move it back because of the uh uh banquet for the the church and so brother Ernie vill and noer will be with us Lord willing on the 9th sister fra wants to be bti too okay hey okay we got another one anybody else we we'll be glad to take them all and have everybody lined up okay and take care of that all right uh let's see anything else all right anything else that I've missed Lord warm yeah there you go there you go he kind of kind of warmed things up for us anyway it could have been real cold of course we don't worry about about that we we've baptized when you didn't know how you was baptized because you know Lord Jesus Christ sounds odd when you I can't get your words out but he knows from the heart what you're doing and what you're trying to do my wife when she was baptized it was Ice froze on all of the lake around there and everything and it was frozen in her high and everything like that uh you know doing so if you're sincere it'll work never had never one bad coal and I've been baptizing for 50 years I guess and never had one bad coal amen out of the whole thing so that's a pretty good record I thank God for that don't you amen amen so just remember all of these announcements okay father we thank you for this day and your grace we thank you for your love and understanding of us we pray that you would just have your way now as we go into the service you under Undertake and have your way with each and every one of our hearts let your loving grace be with us bless us all together in you forgive our sins and lead us by thine understanding we ask it in Jesus name amen what have we got let all things be done decently and in order so you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing so you see it's going to be something different it's not just a thing but uh we we've got kind of a uh New Year's starting out so we'll just call it a New Year's resolution ever how y'all want to call that you know they you never keep them anyway but we're going to try to make some to keep them all right so there's going to be some things said then we'll try to get into the service so I'll try to run through fast now remember now we're trying our best to be a church to serve God and to be right with the Lord in what we do so let all things be done decently and in order so there's an order to everything and the the things that we you know we we wonder and talk about there is an order to it okay now I know it's hard for you to do it but would you please I know I've asked this before and I know it's not working and I'm saying it won't work this time but I'm saying it so you're going to be guilty when you come in there's a sign down there that says turn off all cell phones you're not doing it you're s texting you're sending messages to people you're doing things and that's not right now you say well well well you know like I told one person we was talking about they said well what about so and so being sick we've got two or three telephones that are connected line lined to the church and then you have brother Joe's on home I mean on cell phone so if something goes wrong and you need it you can do that in a hurry all right there's no excuse to say yes but by but my but I need to check on my family after service after service check on your family anything goes wrong we will be glad to give you an information you know stop the services and say you need to do this okay but you're you're do doing it in disrespect cuz you're sit texting and all that stuff like that and then every once in a while you get the Beats comes in so you know all right so take care of that I know here I am one Sunday after making the announcements like that and I we do human errors but I sitting there one day and I'd forgot to turn mine off and here I am scrambling for it to get it turned off you know and I did I got it done but Anna was sitting looking at me life and cuz she knew I got I got caught it just tonight and we do those things that's that's an accident that's a problem it wasn't intended for me to do it cuz I don't fol without phone anyway all right but now listen to your adults and to the children please get things right about going to the bathroom we're very small group of people and things uh you say but my children well that's all right I'm not saying nothing to nobody I'm just saying plain language all right before service all you got to do is take your children to the bathroom and if they can't set an hour and all like that I'd advise you to think things over at home when they're sitting two and three hours with a telephone and working and never even go to the bathroom right it kind of wind up like old brother told me one time he said I can sit and whale he said I can wail for 5 hours and never even hardly get out of position then he was the problem was he was complaining that the services was too long yeah but he killed his own point cuz he said he had he set her five hours I'm not telling you this you know we don't want a bunch of wet Pampers running around okay D ridings decently and everything something goes wrong you take care of it all right but does it have to be all time you say well we can't do it a Sunday morning there's a lot of things we can't do on Sunday morning because of up and down but what about Sunday evening and Sunday night you know I see some of you that are respectable I say Brother Ray as quick as that morning service starts to a certain spot he's gone to the bathroom and back he never goes again to life the service is over that's right all right now we got all think about everybody else amen no we think about ourselves bless God I'm not going to well okay now the prophet said it I didn't he said one person could cause a church to fail amen and said you're going to be responsible that's right now remember your children are going to do what you want what you let them do that's right amen and them little puppy dog eyes you know look at you oh that little old video Samuel back there already he's already got he look them eyeballs around he'll get used to it and everything oh you know it'll do but just try to do what's right amen you know we're not telling you you got a set there no we're telling you do what's right get it done before service you know go by the bathroom before service you say yeah but my my kids are no no you're making excuses so don't make not I'm being as sincere as I can but as loving as I can okay now if you don't think this is a loving way I can get it different I can bring the profit of what he said and read it and say you are an unbeliever because you're not doing this I'm not doing that I'm being serious I'm being sincere and try to do the best that I can all right now no one necessarily talking we shouldn't have a lot of talking in the sanctuary outside of what did the prophet say tell the person see you outside amen see you outside but I've seen some of you stop and talk and take on conversations while the service you know right at the end of the service that's not correct that's that's not the prophet said one child running through a church would hinder the next service so now if you let your child run through the church or you get up and talking and you run backwards and forth you do it then you hinder the next service now who's responsible hey come on Church we're serving a God we're not playing just try to go to church and be good and have a book of rules and and everything I've always said one thing and I believe it Christianity is not a rule that's right amen Christianity is a love of fire between us and God and if we want him to come in our services we must invite him amen amen we must honor him and respect him all right amen now oh no one no congregating and things you know and doing things and like from the doors back underway we can't help it we come up the step and I'm just as guilty I'm not throwing off to you I'm guilty we come up talking and things but the closer we get this way there ought to be a whole lot quieter because it's you know respecting this Sanctuary we ain't got a great big building great big thing to where we can do it's it's our problem but that's still we can handle it all right but see sometimes you'll hear and they we've had trouble back there of people talking right there shouldn't be over two people in that tape room orever who's working the dress should be out here this is where we were supposed to meet all right we play the tape we thought that idea would work good because the prophet said get to church what 30 minutes four time sit down and read your Bible and be quiet right waiting for the service so we started playing the tape of the Prophet for 20 minutes for us to come in on then playing for 20 minutes then it switches over and you have live music and things for 10 minutes for the services we should honor that I it doesn't matter who it is we should come in sit down and hear the prophet amen amen well that's Tak it away my yeah take away your talking time so but remember we're supposed to be serving God Amen as I said Christian J is not a requirement it's a joy why don't you want to come in and hear the prophet get yourself out of the way get here early uhoh amen you sure do it at work yeah you do it at all other things let me call you up and say we'll go eat supper you'll be there right on time right well then there's no excuse for anything else now we're not making excuses we're talking plain we should all come into the sanctuary 30 minutes before and sit down and be respectful as the tape is playing and hearing the prophet I think it's doing a good work amen I think it's bringing the presence of the Lord more into the services than it is to just be running backers and forth now listen I know everybody ain't capable of coming up a lot of time but now don't don't start the excuses well I can't get up Sunday morning might be an excuse cuz you're a teacher you're hailing a class you're doing this that that's that's go that's all but each one of you teachers should say to your children maybe way down to the adults you know boy to the bigger you know hey if you need to go to the bathroom you're excused sure right of course expect all of them to leave you know I mean okay but listen I said I know some of you can't do it all right now we're not complaining we're talking there should be no children come up here to practice music without an adult amen no children come up here to practice without an adult being with you and I know I know listen come on you sitting here and you're having to tell well what song are we praying what are we doing you're you're you're being but be sincere about it be be quiet you don't have to holler boy that was good one was I'm sitting in the study a lot of times okay all right I try not to run out and say nothing but sometimes I hear things a little bit too loud that's what I'm saying no children to be up here now children don't come up here to play unless you got an adult to come up with you all right see no children doing that unless you're accompanied by an adult and controlled by that adult be sure that all are notified of the parts and the practicing and the singing you know let them be notified because that's the way it needs to be make sure all are instructed in the singing and the thing cuz you need to be somebody needs to be in charge appoint someone come to me I'll appoint one and when I appoint one that's a law uh you want to quote from the prophet the pastor is the only one got a right to put in and take out anyone he wants to now that's you want that quote you say yeah but we don't we're not supporting the denominations we're according to what the prophet says all right now listen make sure all are contacted about your singing groups and your things that you're doing all right make sure everybody is contacted tell them in the classes tell them in the what tell them up here we'll announce it we do a lot of times anounce everybody's to meet so make sure everybody knows that and follows that because you're in charge all right then uh you know don't let the children get back there and run up down the stairway I have to say something and have had to say something to Children about that amen I try to say it and don't tell the mama and daddies I'm just a do old granddaddy I'm sorry I just play with the kids around here a little bit myself you know because they're kids and I I don't scream and holler to you that your chid is doing so and so I tell the kids ha calm it down but they'll be running up and down the stairway running up down the stairway life and holling because they're children that's right but this is the church this is not a town hall all right now we had a list before and we need to get back to it I'm asking the song leaders the three of you to get together and get you list because you're missing some people that are not that are capable of singing You're missing them and not getting to them you say well they don't tell me it's your job the list should be put down on the refrigerator all month long year long somebody do that somebody take it and do it and put it and let so and so sing so and so sing all right go by there song leaders go by for your service look at the thing yeah but they supposed to no they're not supposed to come to you you're the song leader you're supposed to make sure it runs right cuz if they're not here you're supposed to get somebody else right if they're not here to sing you're supposed to get somebody else well how you going to know okay so don't don't come to me with those points do you okay we'll have it made up to where the tonight names will be there and you make sure they sing right now we have a little problems a lot of times with you need to clean up the area you're sitting in you need to clean up the area you sit in don't throw down things and let things do you need to clean up where you're sitting it's your children and all and so clean it up to end of the service take a little time and pick up the papers and the things and and all you know I mean that's okay all right now make sure especially downstairs that where you eat at and things that you clean up that area well I didn't see don't start that right if you want to come up here I get here I'm nine nine times out of 10 and I'm a first one here and you know what I'll do most of the time I didn't get to do it today because I was running some things and trying to think a little I go out and look over the parking lot and clean up everything you come out and get out of your car and there's a Coke can or there is there any problem to stop and picking that up and go put it in the dry scan I ain't picking up the trash out there it ain't my job I didn't know we had jobs like that I didn't know we had to have a job as a this I thought it was I helped the janitor as much as I can right we should all be that way there should be no drinks brought into the sanctuary now listen I've been plain I try to be and I know I get in trouble cuz here goes trouble brother dick Addison had problems with his sugar and the things like that I allowed him to bring a drink in I didn't and I'm putting it on here I didn't like the way he cared it in out and open in front of everybody he could have put it in a can and slid it in the seat that's up to him if he hears that and he'll know I don't like it that way see I don't like the point of us doing things to make it look like we're doing if I give you permission to bring a Coke in or a a water you should hide that water in your pocket not hold up brother D told me I could do this yeah no it shouldn't be because in most churches you'd get it straight and blunt right no water drinks period in the sanctuary period period right come on I try to be nice I try to be okay everything should be done decently and in order I believe children that are like six seven years of age they should be sitting up in a Pew listening to the service amen I know children hey I love them and you know that and these children know it they know it from the bottom of my heart that I love them and I want to help them and do and to do anything in the world I could for them but you should be little children should set up and if they get sleepy they're going to lay over and go to sleep that's a kid but don't come with a planning you know what are you going to do today now lay me down to sleep don't PL it don't okay people you know children should be monitored to the point of say get up kids and sit down yes you shouldn't be drawing coloring painting doing things like that in the service if you're over that six seven years of age and control them underneath that you know but you understand what I'm saying I see some bringing in great big bags of things backpacks all like I I don't think we need that in church I mean you know well I'm w c well my kids want well how old are they okay anything shouldn't be brought into the sanctuary that shouldn't be there at all control your children interactions and if necessary you take your children out so that they don't interfere with the services anything wrong with that I ain't saying when you know you in I can pull you and you get brother brandham I'll show you where brother brandham plats he puts it down to the to the point boy I mean he lays it down strong and then right at the end of that service there kids in there crying like everything he ain't saying a thing he's a Doty old granddaddy you think brother brandom was a hard Stern guy no he was honest and sincere he had a heart of love he did not say go back there and run that kid out of the room no we're not saying nothing like that if you think that's what it is you're the one thinking wrong kids are going to be kids just like that one they're going to say things and do things they're going to cry they're going to do you have to take care of them they're kids but now 14 years old is enough right I don't mean that to you kids at 14 that just that just number come out okay all right let me get a little bit and then we'll get on to the service today see control your children make them act and Dre right and then don't if somebody one of the deacons or somebody corrects one of your children you get all blowed up and puffed up if you're going to be that way we leave I didn't ask you to come right is that blunt enough I didn't ask you to come here I ain't going to beg you not to leave that's right but I'm going to tell you where we stand that's right and what we stand for if you don't like that then okay that's a situation you have to deal with it I've done everything I've could to try to be nice and help you and do for you spend money on you give you thousands and thousands of dollars and all like that to do this that and the other send the kids to camps do all all kind of things one of some of it I didn't even agree with parts of things myself but yet I've done it to try to be a good pastor to help you to your children to where they can grow up and want to be right all right remember you're in charge of that child that's right right now who was it said it uh let's see I'm going to paraphrase it I guess you know it's your responsibility for your children get to baptism of the Holy Ghost somebody made that statement just recently now I don't remember what it was but you know it's a good statement you know you're responsible to bring them to church you're responsible to to tell them what it is to be a Christian You're expect they're supposed to be looking at you to see what a Christian is supposed to be like you know that all of that should be okay now listen I've noticed this one around here and I just say a word about it okay I've noticed a a lot of your sisters and when I say sisters that goes from Nanny which is 77 I guess the oldest no no sister CET excuse me sister clet look around back there I'm talking to her down to the youngest little child look your high heels is getting a little bit too high yeah the you want to get the profit see that's where that I get in trouble by saying things to people but if I preach what most preachers preach you'd be in bad shape I don't preach on hair and dress and clothes I expect a mom and daddy to take care of their children I preach Christianity I preach being borned again will take care of the cutting the hire and the clothes but then when you start seeing it ease out and gets a little bit and you know come on Church you sisters know what I'm talking about it's true you say well our sisters on yeah there's a lady what's her name that's got hired that just walks along and it drags behind her Crystal Crystal Gale you know I ain't against her that's none of my business I'm just saying you know yourself it's cut straight across yeah so that means she's cutting it what no matter how long it is she's cutting it hey girls don't be deceived don't think well I can sneak and get my high trimmed anybody that knows any sense at all look at you and see it's cut straight across her don't grow straight across he grows different lens okay but see you should be concerned about your high heels your clothes I'll still put our church against anybody in the message I ain't worried about it so I ain't throwing nobody out right am sir I'm proud of you I'm proud of you girls I'm proud of you boys I'm proud of you very much I've always been very proud I pray for you every day because I want you to do right in God and be right as a Christian but not have to be beat to death about everything it it it irks me to have to say things like I'm saying today because I want you to do what you're supposed to do as a Christian why would you not want to do that moms and dad look at your children what they're wearing yeah but just remember you need to look over at your wife every once in a while and if her knees is shining something's close okay see remember girls but I'm just as bad now listen I'm not against the girls and for the boys come on boys we get the same thing man we're the ones that's supposed to be the head of the home that's right that's right right we're supposed to be the one to direct our wife but does she direct us right she stomp that little foot you need to Stomp the back I don't mean on top of her foot could get you in trouble the only time I ever done anything to I guess was disrespectful excuse me my wife and I had had a little few words and and U she she went home with just a little bit out of the house and she went home and uh she went inside well I guess she done the sensible thing she locked the door well when I got there I tried the door it didn't work I didn't have no key I said hey let me in this is 45 years ago maybe 50 I guess anyhow hey let me in I said if you don't let me in I'm going to knock the door down well time I tapped it one time gently the second time the door opened so remember they will mind you they may not like it but we're still supposed to be the one in charge right so I'm not throwing off on the girls or the boys I'm talking about all of us we're supposed to be a Christian example to live before our children and want them to live like us yes then we say see well brother Dale why does my children like this and not disrespectful I'm very proud of my family I'm very proud of the situation they've come through and life they've existed with and and uh you know I think they've turned to be pretty turn out to be pretty good kids oh maybe needs a knock on a head a few times every once in a while but you know it's true but still they're kids and they've growned up and for people to brag about them to me is a great thing it makes me makes me feel good cuz at least we done we've had people say what did y'all do you know what we done we prayed for them you know what we done we tried to live before them that's oh we failed yeah yeah CU yall going to do that everybody we're going to fail but you say well how come your children come to the lord well and mine didn't well not I'm sorry I've had preachers or people people to say well there your son is a preacher well see they'd be tickled to death for their son to be a preacher I didn't make him a preacher but I sure did pray a lot for him amen amen I'm trying to just be serious about all of us we're supposed to be Christians amen living for the world to look at right amen well that ain't my problem well according to the Bible it is is yes it amen so if I offended you anything I've said today I'm sorry for offending you but I'm not sorry for what I say cuz I'm going to say it and I'm not going to say just me and my me and my my family you to live like my family no you sort to live should live like a Christian you should be a Christian in every actions and ways and thing and maybe your children would like to be about that that way if nothing else they'll highly respect you if you'll just live right and be right amen they might not tell you but they'll highly respect you down the road if you do that because we're all Christians and being Christians all right because that's what we should be amen we should be Christians not to have to be I enjoy it I'm having a I'm having a good time I you know not caral illustration I guess but you know I never had no problem working at General Motors I was making a living amen and I ran jobs that sometimes it' take two people to run them when I wasn't there I worked but I never done it on a basis I done it because they was paying my bills they was giving me money to make a living you know I didn't have to do anything wrong I I was just being what I was being I worked well that's what I think about a Christian and sort of just would just be that and live before them what you'd want them to be now I'll end it by saying this because remember the way you live before them is the way they will be right right that's right did that come out right now you want them to live and be right but remember the way you live is the way they're going to follow so then try to be a Christian try to be a Christian all the time all right okay just try to be a Christian I got just a little thought so let's think about something okay I'm over with that any questions any thoughts anything you want to say against me or for me or whatever just go ahead write notes give them to them and tell me I'll do the best I can cuz that's what I am but I want to ask you questions I love questions amen I do brother R said questions makes a strong church now listen questions without answers don't make a strong church now what's he saying questions with an answer from God is no longer a question it's a statement of fact or a point amen right so then when he says something you know think about what he's saying question makes a strong church cuz it makes us dig in amen I want to ask you a question how many times is it in the Bible where it uses the word Eternal Covenant now I don't ask ask to raise a hand I'm I'm trying to get a point for for the message what I'm talking about H but WR down how many times you think it would be in the Bible now some of you catch real quick on this one so all right I'll I'll let you cheat sheet just a little how many times is in there that's called an Everlasting Covenant what I said see someone already shaking your heads cuz you you got to cheat sheet from way back yeah you you got what you've read and heard okay but it's odd isn't it why would God I believe I'm right now it says Everlasting Covenant I believe it 15 times uh it's not in the Bible at all that says Eternal Covenant that's right now eternal life is there amen and all like that that's why I thought of this the other day when I was ending up in the message remember brother Brandon says he says we believe in Eternal Heaven he said we believe in an eternal God or something he had about three things he said but we don't believe in an eternal hell he said we don't believe in that amen he said because anything had a beginning has an ending so we don't believe in eternal hell we've been taught that all of our life and thought the said but the Bible in no way ever teaches hell as to be an eternal because hell had a beginning it was created the Bible said for the devil and his angels it will be burned up one day in the Lake of Fire amen all right so then there's no such thing as an eternal hell but yet there's an eternal life there's an eternal heaven but yet that'll be destroyed one day so then how you going to explain now I'm just asking you simple questions something that maybe means nothing to you but it rings a bell with me and it just think oh but why why would it not be 5,000 times that it would say an eternal Covenant why would it say an Everlasting Covenant yeah more times than to say an eternal Covenant see that's what makes the joy in my heart is to think of these things and they come out and then you you you you pray and you seek God how many of you remembers the quote that I gave the other day where brother brandom said on things that are to be said I got the baptism with the Holy Ghost that still has nothing to do with it that's just only a temporal gift right amen for you no that's what he said it's a temporal gift why would brother random call S an eternal point of eternal life and the thing but to talk about a baptism of the Holy Ghost that we all said this is where we get born again we get this we get that we get all the things we you know and the prophet say it's a temporal gift a temporary gift now according to my sense and knowledge I thought the word temporary meant something that wasn't Eternal you know that had it's there's something wrong with it why would your Prophet call it a temporal gift why would the Bible speak of an Everlasting Covenant 15 times and never speak of an eternal Covenant but yet we're in the message but see if you read you get an answer so you know real certain you know I don't fool around with all this garbage can that's running out now saying brother Brown was wrong I say it pling language if some of them dummies will come and even halfway come up to what the prophet taught I don't know where I even want to listen to him or not then but I'd at least think more about him if they come up with some kind of a sensible answer to a lot of things do you have eternal life yes you can have eternal life but you don't have an eternal Covenant wow well you say oh that's just the Old Testament cuz it starts out in Genesis about the uh uh the first time is when Noah and the rainbow and he said I give you an Everlasting Covenant comes on over a little bit to Abraham and and changing him from Abram to Abraham and he said I'll give you an Everlasting Covenant it comes on over further into the Old Testament of dealing with Israel as a nation and he said I'll give you an Everlasting Covenant about the land and the things but then you jump over to where we read or we hav read it so better read it You' be thinking I'm reading wrong go ahead brother Hebrews 13 look what Paul has to say now this is New Testament okay obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give an account that they may do it with joy not with grief for it is unprofitable for for it is unprofitable for you now remember they've watched out your souls that's right amen so now something down here is going to pop out in a minute and you're going to see what it means go ahead pray for us we trust you have a good conscience and all things willing to live honestly but I beseech you rather to do that that I may be restored to you the sooner now the God of Peace that brought again from the dead our lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the Sheep through the blood of the Everlasting Covenant I said we could follow it through the Old Testament and look at it and talk about an Everlasting Covenant because we' know that you did not have eternal life in your soul that's right you did not have eternal life in your body or spirit in the Old Testament am right so then in knowing that we know for certainty that it's an everlasting right it's not Eternal eternal life was not a product of the Old Testament maybe a wrong way of saying that but the New Testament has the eternal life that it speaks of that it speaks of a new testament you had an Old Testament that would not deal with eternal life but would deal with things that would be Everlasting uh a rainbow and all but remember the rainbow is to be forever remember the things you do read in Israel and be careful because a lot of that has a point to it that it will be forever see that children of Israel in their land right now that's in their land it's theirs it was given to them that's right there's an Everlasting Covenant with those people for that land all right so they'll never lose it I don't care what the enemy does or what they try to do Israel will never lose that because it's Everlasting but remember the land is not Eternal remember the people are not Eternal amen all right but why would it be that way that Paul would speak of a Everlasting Covenant why would he not call it Eternal why would he not deal with those things go ahead and pull up number five brothers and we'll get that and then we'll we'll take just a minute we'll close out try to give you something where you won't go home down and out about it so all we done got chewed out this morning he hurt my feelings well after the service is over with I'll rub you back not to women but I let my wife do that but listen why would it be get the situation why would it be you can follow as I said you can follow the Everlasting Covenant through the Old Testament right because there's not eternal life there so you can see it's Everlasting now when you get to the New Testament with a New Covenant and the new things why would Paul call it an Everlasting Covenant right why would he not call it an eternal Covenant right see one of these days you're going to realize why I keep hollering and screaming the new birth is the birth of the word it is that word that you take all of that I put on the the anointing was what justification chops off your pie sin sanctification cleans and sets aside the Garment but remember at sanctification the word being brought into your soul is what drives out the devil the unclean Spirit but it all also plants that word within there to where that when the Holy Ghost does come it can make you alive amen right but remember it only makes your soul alive it doesn't make your body alive doesn't make your spirit alive it makes your soul alive all right now look what your Prophet had to say list some close now taken from the message token 1963 do you recognize his son is saved in Egypt the things of blood the blood lamb is the type of Jesus Christ in Hebrews 13:10 and 20 I ain't got time to read it put it down I was going to read it it's called the Everlasting Covenant the blood of Jesus Christ is called the Everlasting Covenant yes sir Everlasting why is it not called eternal Covenant right you said well it's interchangeable between Everlasting and eternal go ahead you just running yourself blind let's read what the prophet says then we know what it's meant by then we know why in the Old Testament it could be an Everlasting Covenant right cuz in none of it was eternal amen a prophecy coming forth of the children of Israel where it says one time that he would give them an everlasting in Covenant which would be the prophecy that God would come and live in you right going to Jeremiah and Isaiah and things just really in Everlasting Covenant when you and and see what I'm talking about but look why wasn't it called Eternal Covenant because that it wouldn't be eternal that's right my brother Brandon amen because that it wouldn't be Eternal now look at his answer when we're redeemed it's all over then that's right now watch our Point listen when you come into the New Testament was you following me from the Old Testament you had the Everlasting Covenant nothing Eternal but when you you come into the New Testament you had a new testament which was speaking of eternal life in the soul of the individual by that new birth all right but that never made the body and the spirit Eternal that's right right so that's what we're waiting on is eternal life for this body and spirit and while we're waiting we're in an Everlasting Covenant because it's not Eternal because we're not fully redeemed that's right looken it's an everlasting which means certain amount of time till time is out there'll never be another one when time runs out we won't need no Covenant that's right amen that's right are you listening but until time runs out we need the Covenant are you with me amen you don't have an eternal Covenant sure you have eternal Life by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but that doesn't redeem the body and the spirit it has to wait but when Redemption is over you don't need a covenant amen that's right are you reading iten no Covenant amen once it's over once you're fully redeemed once your body spirit and soul which is in the resurrection and Rapture and chain and Ascension amen yes now brother Run's right a't he because that baptism of the Holy Ghost it don't make your soul your body Eternal it don't make your spirit Eternal it's temporal that's right or temporary right it seals the soul come on that's right you have eternal life in your soul but your body is not Eternal your spirit is not Eternal but once you're redeemed once you're redeemed see you no longer need a covenant once you're redeemed you don't need eternal life why cuz you already have it right amen you already have it so what is it forgive me need no I'm too far gone finishing up come on musicians just think on these things think about whatever was ask in the question it never says Eternal Covenant no right why because it was never meant to be an eternal Covenant it was meant to be a covenant for time amen amen amen it was meant to be exactly what it turned out to be a new testament but that New Testament is in his blood but that new testament only gives you eternal life in your soul that's right it doesn't make your body and spirit Eternal what about a wonderful point to look back in the Old Testament and say they spoke of it but they couldn't bring it amen and even the Bible coming into Jesus Christ and the new birth it could bring eternal life to the soul right but it didn't bring eternal life to the body nor the spirit we're still waiting on that am no wonder I'm redeemed by love divine glory glory amen when my Redemption is over I don't have to have nothing CU I already have it when my body and spirit goes into that change and makes it Eternal I'm Eternal in Body Soul and Spirit I don't need a covenant a covenant is for the point of where you're needing it to keep you from being condemned and destroyed amen right amen so we have an Everlasting Covenant what eternal life through Jesus Christ Our Lord amen puts us to a place that's why church I don't understand why people don't want to hear the you realize under sanctification God cleansed and claimed that body you're living in amen you don't never even think about that that's in future home he cleansed and claimed that body you're living in and one day he'll take possession of it one day it will be fully redeemed and when it's redeemed I don't have to have eternal life because I am eternal life it dwells within me that day it'll dwell in my body and my spirit to make it Eternal I don't have to have something over there to say oh I'm glad I've got that I've got a tree of life no no uh-uh right here is where it's at yes it's just the way that it's stated but maybe you'd never thought about it go home and look it up it doesn't say Eternal Covenant amen that's right because see if it did then you'd be in trouble you'd only oh maybe that's why the good old Baptist wants to they don't want to redeem his body the good old Baptist in this message cuz you'd be surprised how many people in this message say they going to get a new body maybe you believe that maybe some of you new and's coming in heard that way back you going get you a new body why I want this body redeemed without but one statement when Jesus raised he raised with nail prints in his hands glorified Eternal Body with nail prints he'll always have that that will never be annihilated he'll always have those nail prints that's right but what about when we become just as Eternal as he is Body Spirit and soul we already are in Soul am yes we're already in a new testament that's right under a New Covenant yes right but it can only be called Everlasting at this period of time that's right because it's not finished Oh Glory how much this message could bring to us if we just listen to it right how much it could be if we would just read the message and not get our own ideas and thoughts involved in it when I just don't understand how you can be Everlasting and eternal what are you trying to say brother Dale exactly what your Prophet said yes that we don't have an eternal Covenant cuz it's not finished yet so we have an Everlasting Covenant for time to take care of the space and the point that we areen but one day we'll have a glorified body like unto his glorious body then everything will be Eternal let's stand together what we got done better than I [Music] thought I [Music] long to be like it [Music] come on brother collie we're going to pray over these where you all heard the story behind the prayer clauset at the chiropractor we was at the chiropractor one day and they said Sam said or to us you know said our business is getting real bad said we need help I said well how about us just giving you a prayer cloth I said okay see they understand he's a he's a good Baptist he real good I'd love to see him right here he'd be a fireball he wouldn't be a dried dyed like most of us but listen we took a prayer Clause I said I got one with me they put it over the door she told us the other day said our business is so great and I mean this has been over probably two years I guess at it maybe 3 years ago when we're done she said our business is so great we can't keep up amen well it it's hard to pray Lord you know jump on that Fell's back and break him down where he can go to the chiropractor so we don't do that we pray God you take care of it they need the business so she said the other day and she had asked us because um s some kin folks to them or somebody they know uh two of them has got cancer real bad we sent them some prayer Clause she told us the other day and we started out said could y'all give us some more prayer claws said we need some more I said we take care of it she said you look said upep over that door said it's still there see they believe they believe God honored their prayers amen well you know why that's there now if we wenten in there drunk and carousing and stomping and feuding and mad as a hornet everything they wouldn't be looking at that to help them no they looked at us as to be what we are right just people God doesn't expect us to be anything different amen he expects us to let him be the difference that should be the whole of all of our Lives is to yield oursel to him so let's just pray over these we'll take a prayer Claus back to them and I'll we need some more up here father we thank you Lord Jesus for this opportunity to be able to lay hands on these prayer cloths we've had them here laying on the desk for a long time anointing of all these ministers that's been preaching over them is Flowing down to leing a lot of of sometimes Slava and stuff from our mouth fall down upon these prayer claws sorry for the wording Lord but it's true but yet you just come on the scene now as we send these prayer Claws and every who they go to you just let your love and your grace be with each one we love you we thank you bless us and keep us sanctify these pray Claus in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen only only your dismiss to be like him to be like Jesus to be Jesus on Earth I Lord
