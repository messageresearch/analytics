[16:06] let's just spray before we read our
[16:08] scripture
[16:10] the heavenly father we thank you Lord
[16:12] for the day and thank you for the time
[16:14] that we have
[16:15] thank you for being you Lord
[16:18] and that you would come and dwell among
[16:20] a people that are not worthy
[16:23] because we we know that there's nothing
[16:26] within us
[16:28] that we know there's one thing
[16:30] you promised it we thank you for keeping
[16:32] your promises
[16:34] we believe that they're yea and amen
[16:35] just have your way now as we read your
[16:37] word and talk about these things
[16:39] and the the thoughts and doctrines among
[16:42] some of the people of the message we're
[16:44] not trying to condemn nobody but to try
[16:46] to make sure that we don't follow after
[16:47] some of those things unknowingly because
[16:50] it would be very easily to fall into
[16:52] some traps and things and not know the
[16:55] real truth but we thank you that you're
[16:57] the truth and you gave us the Holy
[16:59] Spirit to be able to divide out these
[17:02] things and to know what is truth and
[17:04] what is not true we love you and we
[17:07] thank you have your way now and guide us
[17:08] in Jesus name
[17:10] amen
[17:12] First Corinthians
[17:14] 11.
[17:16] 18 19.
[17:20] for first of all when we come to when
[17:22] you come together in the church I hear
[17:24] that there'll be divisions among you and
[17:26] I partly believe it
[17:28] for there must be must be also herishes
[17:32] among you that they which are approved
[17:34] may be made manifest
[17:36] among you see now that's the God will
[17:39] show who will stay with the word and who
[17:40] won't okay okay first Peter 3 15.
[17:45] but sanctify the Lord God in your hearts
[17:47] and be ready always to give an answer to
[17:49] every man that asked you a reason and a
[17:52] hope that is with is
[17:54] in you with meekness and fear you may be
[17:57] seated
[17:59] blessing to the reading of the word
[18:02] now I hope you
[18:04] 've done as I said we try to do
[18:07] on each time is to
[18:10] remind you that some of these doctrines
[18:12] that we're covering
[18:14] um have been around a long time and uh
[18:17] pray that you would just understand that
[18:19] what we're trying to do is to just show
[18:22] you what we believe and what we don't
[18:24] believe in it that way we you know a
[18:26] church without a Doctrine it's not a
[18:28] church so we we just stand on these
[18:30] things and see them and there's so many
[18:32] uh when I mentioned something like I'll
[18:35] call out something like we've covered uh
[18:37] now the uh the point of the two Souls
[18:40] the two Lords the River Jordan and this
[18:42] morning we were on the seven Thunder
[18:44] virtue uh point and uh you know
[18:49] in doing that I know that there's
[18:50] different variations different groups
[18:53] and things around the country that say
[18:57] that I don't believe it that way I
[18:59] believe it this way you know and there's
[19:01] doctrines of that order and all brother
[19:03] Aaron was brought it to my attention on
[19:05] one that um
[19:08] you know there is a Doctrine among some
[19:11] of the people mentioned or used to be
[19:12] really about the seven Thunders that
[19:15] actually the seven Thunders were seven
[19:16] men
[19:18] you know and I remember the names or two
[19:20] or three of them but they believed that
[19:23] they were seven men you know that had
[19:25] the you're supposed to follow those
[19:26] seven people well
[19:28] uh I hope you understood what I say this
[19:31] morning and that would correct that
[19:32] point because I believe what the prophet
[19:35] had to say the Thunder's the voice of
[19:37] God Amen when the seal breaks all right
[19:39] now we follow anyone that follows the
[19:42] truth right man because that's the point
[19:45] and as I said there's so many Doctrine
[19:48] at least used to run off until you be
[19:50] preaching for 20 years trying to cover
[19:52] each Avenue that people are taking on a
[19:54] Doctrine and they'll fight with each
[19:56] other but that's pretty well like it was
[19:58] an organized religion we when Methodist
[20:01] we fight with the Baptist and the
[20:02] Baptists with the Pentecost trolls and
[20:04] this that and the other you know and
[20:06] didn't claim to believe the other one
[20:07] and there's always one was with the
[20:09] truth and the other one wasn't and I've
[20:12] even warned you of one thing and I
[20:14] believe it and I've said this for over
[20:15] 40 years I guess
[20:17] that
[20:19] one day I believe God will pour out an
[20:21] anointing upon this church
[20:23] that will change our bodies and take us
[20:25] home believe that I've always looked for
[20:28] that because that's what the prophet
[20:29] said all right
[20:31] but at the same time the rain falls from
[20:33] the Justin the unjust that's right so
[20:36] don't expect everybody to leave all
[20:37] their doctrinal thoughts and ideas when
[20:41] you begin to see the real rain falling
[20:43] on you
[20:44] because you know what the rain's going
[20:46] to be falling on them that's right yeah
[20:48] and they'll be saying I told you my
[20:51] Doctrine was right you know yeah I mean
[20:54] that's what they'll be saying so here's
[20:55] proof of it you know because I've always
[20:58] looked for that not a worldwide sweeping
[21:00] Revival right no no I don't I'm not
[21:02] looking for that that would be the two
[21:04] witnesses coming with the Jews but you
[21:07] know an anointing to strike the church
[21:09] but I believe
[21:10] that is the key to it I believe it's
[21:13] been striking the church for a long time
[21:14] it'll run around and said you know after
[21:17] the door this Gentile church is closed
[21:19] all anointed church then he's sitting
[21:21] gone for doing one year what theology is
[21:22] trying to do in 2000 now in quoting he
[21:24] said
[21:26] they said he's doing at night amen
[21:29] because he's always been doing it he's
[21:31] always been anointing the true church to
[21:34] bring her to the right place but as I
[21:37] said about it the scripture this morning
[21:38] you'd say well why would it need to be
[21:41] be herishes to prove us to see who we
[21:44] are right Amen to see if we'll stay with
[21:46] the word or we'll follow somebody's idea
[21:48] you know and uh what is it the guy that
[21:51] won't stand for something to fall for
[21:53] anything is that the way it goes I
[21:54] always missing that way quote it wrong
[21:56] but that's right you know sometimes I
[21:58] sometimes I get things right but you
[22:01] know just think on these things now
[22:04] and uh let's see
[22:07] I'm gonna hook something down there to
[22:08] cover but anyhow
[22:11] there's a Doctrine among the people of
[22:13] the message
[22:15] and it went overseas I ran into these
[22:17] things in different places
[22:19] and we had a personal experience with
[22:22] this Doctrine
[22:24] um you know where we went to church and
[22:26] everything and it was a doctrine that
[22:28] the basics of what it said and that's
[22:30] what I said now here's a whole lot of
[22:32] flames off this group leaves this part
[22:34] of it and this and it come out of the
[22:37] same situation
[22:39] of believing it but there was a brother
[22:41] that started back years ago there along
[22:43] in the uh
[22:45] late 60s and early 70s and some of you
[22:48] personally knew of these things that he
[22:51] said we don't have the Holy Ghost like
[22:53] they did
[22:54] in the book of Acts
[22:57] we don't have the new birth
[23:00] they believe basically this
[23:04] you know that you'd start here and when
[23:06] you reached the headstone of love that
[23:09] then you would have the new birth
[23:12] or and see even if you tried to talk to
[23:14] them about something and then they would
[23:17] say well you're turning the pyramid
[23:18] upside down
[23:20] things of that order and you know
[23:23] they've take quotes from run around them
[23:24] and try to base it on it and but yet not
[23:28] seeing that and I personally tried to
[23:30] talk with with the brothers that are
[23:32] about this Doctrine I said you're trying
[23:35] to preach adoption but you don't know
[23:37] how that's right well that offended them
[23:39] for me to tell them they didn't know how
[23:41] but I'm sorry I just don't have an
[23:43] education you forgive me I I just talk
[23:46] plain and plain language is easy to
[23:48] understand but it's easy to
[23:50] misunderstand you say well you're trying
[23:54] to tell them they didn't know nothing I
[23:55] wasn't doing that I was trying to tell
[23:57] them that they had a lot of things right
[23:59] but they just needed it lined up a
[24:01] little different because it wasn't
[24:02] coming out to fit the order like I said
[24:05] this morning of it if you say that the
[24:07] virtues the seven Thunder you know that
[24:09] part was the selling virtues will then
[24:11] if you start with faith is a virtue then
[24:13] you've got eight virtues so then you
[24:16] know it doesn't work out mathematically
[24:18] in things but I'm sure sorry for being
[24:21] that away O2 will remember the ones
[24:24] coming home this afternoon because
[24:25] that's where Joyce and and uh uh brother
[24:28] boy and Sister Janet are with the with
[24:31] the kids at the the Youth Camp bad
[24:33] brother guest donors and they're coming
[24:35] home today so you know remember that all
[24:37] right
[24:39] but they the doctrinal issue
[24:43] of the point was that
[24:46] you don't have
[24:49] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[24:52] like it was in the book of Acts
[24:55] and that went on for and has still going
[24:59] on
[25:00] and you know they're still facing the
[25:04] people around the country about the
[25:06] doctrine and that's what hurts me so
[25:09] hard and that's why that I've tried to
[25:10] help people because like when we went to
[25:13] the Philippines
[25:14] and I ran into people to hurt it you
[25:17] know they told me I said when these
[25:20] doctrines came we didn't have anything
[25:21] to to be able to kind of you know
[25:24] counteract the doctrine
[25:26] We Believe brother Brown was a prophet
[25:29] we believed you know and we were just
[25:31] getting that that's all the books they
[25:33] had was just a few books and and they
[25:35] couldn't argue doctrines with these
[25:37] people right but thank God now that they
[25:39] have the the way to you know through the
[25:41] prophet's message and to be able to to
[25:45] do that you know and help but still
[25:47] you're limited
[25:48] to how much has been preached to you
[25:51] amen and how much understanding you can
[25:53] have that's right that's right you know
[25:55] I mean you could say well I've read the
[25:57] message well that's wonderful
[25:58] but has God put it together by somebody
[26:01] that can you know bring it to a place to
[26:04] give you a better understanding you know
[26:07] and that way all right but we're trying
[26:08] to get into that
[26:10] but see they the man actually was
[26:13] teaching me I talked with him and he
[26:15] said he said well you just don't have
[26:17] the Holy Ghost like
[26:18] like it is in the Bible
[26:21] and uh
[26:23] I said well
[26:25] you know I'm I'm sorry I said I'm not
[26:28] trying to prove to you
[26:30] and I'm not today I'm not trying to
[26:32] prove to you whether I'm born again or
[26:33] not that's that's beside the point
[26:36] is for the try to prove a point
[26:38] like that but I said brother what I'm
[26:41] trying to show you is that brother
[26:42] Branham said
[26:45] that he met people
[26:48] that if they had the bad tearsome of the
[26:50] Holy Ghost just like the book of Acts
[26:53] 50 years before he ever came on the
[26:56] scene you know
[26:58] and the those people you know you've
[27:02] heard me refer to it that that people
[27:04] will say those things like that and they
[27:06] look at it like them and I've had the
[27:08] brother to personally sit as close to
[27:09] brother colleague to point his finger at
[27:11] me and say if you got the baptism in the
[27:13] Holy Ghost stand up and show me well I'm
[27:15] glad that God never told me to ever
[27:17] stand up because if he'd ever said stand
[27:19] up I stood up right I mean that's just
[27:21] honest and I finally just had to leave
[27:23] because it got to that point but before
[27:25] I left I had a long talk with a brother
[27:28] and I showed him that brother Branham
[27:30] said
[27:31] people had the baptism when the Holy
[27:33] Ghost yeah all right but that didn't
[27:35] change him right at the point it was
[27:37] discussing it with me he pulled away but
[27:40] then he went right on because now their
[27:43] point was that nobody has perfect love
[27:49] and they you know that nobody has
[27:51] perfect love and if you have to have
[27:54] perfect love remember when around went
[27:55] beyond the curtain of time he said
[27:57] nothing can go here except that would
[27:59] have perfect love and he said you know
[28:01] the brother he said well nobody's got
[28:03] perfect love
[28:05] and I remember two things and I pulled
[28:08] out the books and read them to him
[28:10] and one of them was that brother Branham
[28:13] saw that lady behind the curtain of time
[28:15] that was 90 years old that was converted
[28:18] in his ministry you remember that one he
[28:21] said she's 90 years old when she got
[28:23] converted and I said she was there yep
[28:25] if you remember growing around said it
[28:27] actually his first girlfriend
[28:30] was beyond the curtain of time right
[28:33] well see the point was that they could
[28:35] argue if you just said well what do you
[28:37] mean that was people brought around the
[28:38] city who see their point was we don't
[28:40] know when they're getting there we don't
[28:42] know where they come from but I I I had
[28:45] a decent memory then and and I just
[28:47] discussed it with the brother but the
[28:49] point I want you to get
[28:51] is
[28:53] brought around said
[28:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[28:59] today by the new birth
[29:02] that you have by justification
[29:05] sanctification the baptism of the Holy
[29:07] Ghost the new birth is the same New
[29:09] Birth that came on today of Pentecost
[29:11] amen that's right
[29:14] now one scripture would tie it all
[29:17] together enough for me because I've
[29:20] always tried to tell you that even in
[29:21] the days of Martin Luther that the just
[29:24] shall live by faith was the baptism my
[29:26] Holy Ghost for that day amen right and
[29:28] we just got through that amen
[29:29] sanctification under Wesley was the
[29:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth
[29:33] of that age
[29:35] giving them eternal life putting him in
[29:38] the body of Christ all right now the new
[29:41] birth then
[29:42] would be the the the the the baptism of
[29:46] the Holy Ghost that gives you that would
[29:49] be the same holy ghost that fell under
[29:50] their Pentecost or you would have a
[29:52] different Holy Ghost now
[29:56] I know each age it was degreed out
[29:59] however how you would make the statement
[30:00] that the Holy Ghost was kind of you know
[30:04] put under the justification blood around
[30:06] and said now that's was great and they
[30:08] had it for there but said when you come
[30:10] to the Pentecostal he said it was the
[30:12] fullness of the baptism
[30:14] amen
[30:19] all right and then that see then you
[30:21] would you would say well now why would
[30:23] these people want to believe it that way
[30:24] well
[30:25] they were they were looking at adoption
[30:28] and trying to explain it but not knowing
[30:31] how to explain it amen because in the
[30:34] adoptional series and then the greater
[30:36] things of of going on in the message we
[30:39] know that we are being born again amen
[30:42] wonderful we're being born again but you
[30:45] must have your first bases upon whether
[30:47] or not you are born again
[30:50] and you know and brother Brown statue of
[30:52] perfect man says you're born again in
[30:53] faith all right then you're growing in
[30:56] Grace and knowledge and see then that
[30:59] was all I was trying to do was show that
[31:01] run around and that's all I'm going to
[31:02] do this afternoon is to try to read some
[31:04] things that brother Branham said the
[31:06] baptism of the Holy Ghost is here just
[31:08] like it was under that Pentecost amen
[31:11] all right all right now I admit and I
[31:13] admitted it to them
[31:15] on some of the occasions of talking with
[31:17] them that they had a point of what they
[31:20] were saying but not all together
[31:23] and you remember I told you we were out
[31:25] in Colorado and I was talking with two
[31:27] brothers and we were deer hunting
[31:28] together and and we were discussing this
[31:31] point where brother Brown said people
[31:33] had the Holy Ghost 50 years for him and
[31:35] they both said they couldn't believe
[31:37] that
[31:38] I mean both of them did now that's their
[31:40] words that's right they said they they
[31:42] couldn't believe it
[31:44] and I said well let me explain something
[31:46] to you
[31:48] I said there's a difference on the death
[31:49] Pentecost
[31:51] see and that's helped me to understand
[31:53] on the death Pentecost you had 120 in
[31:56] the upper room that had been tutored by
[31:58] the Lord Jesus for three and a half
[31:59] years and the Holy Ghost fell on them
[32:02] see then it put them right here right
[32:05] brotherly kindness and holy spirit now
[32:08] the love was The Headstone that we
[32:09] covered this morning that hadn't come
[32:11] yet right he couldn't manifest himself
[32:13] in that he could only manifest himself
[32:15] in the pyramid as as the new birth and
[32:18] the point of coming up
[32:20] and the disciples had these virtues all
[32:23] right
[32:24] but I said the 120 see if they were at
[32:26] that place they had been tutored for
[32:28] three and a half years when Holy Ghost
[32:29] fell it felt a word they had the the
[32:33] Jesus in the The Gospel that they took
[32:36] the word and held it
[32:38] let's see they cherished it but like
[32:41] I've always explained to you or tried to
[32:43] the Bible said that Jesus was seen of
[32:45] over 500 brethren
[32:48] after his resurrection all right now not
[32:50] this count before right just take the
[32:53] Bible is it safe you've seen of over 500
[32:56] brethren
[32:58] you know I have to re-range all right
[33:01] the worst the other 390 right why didn't
[33:04] they make it to the upper room right
[33:06] because they've not been tutored in the
[33:08] word right amen
[33:10] they just weren't allowed to see the
[33:12] Lord Jesus
[33:14] but they were not tutored in the word so
[33:17] they didn't make it to Pentecost right
[33:19] right
[33:21] so that's one group of people under
[33:23] their Pentecost where the baptism of the
[33:25] Holy Ghost That Could Quicken the word
[33:27] that they heard that's right but then
[33:28] the 3000 outside it only heard one
[33:30] sermon
[33:34] sermon Peter preached a sermon three
[33:37] thousand people were saved right filled
[33:39] with the Holy Ghost right there that day
[33:43] and it was a day of Pentecost all right
[33:46] so that brought around is exactly right
[33:48] amen
[33:51] the 3 000 had to baptism of the Holy
[33:54] Ghost on the death Pentecost right if
[33:56] anybody has received the new birth in
[33:58] faith the Born Again experience that's
[34:00] the baptism of the Holy Ghost Justified
[34:02] just exactly like Pentecost right
[34:05] that's not the growth development up
[34:07] through the year coming out to these
[34:09] other things right no that takes the
[34:13] tutoring the training as we were talking
[34:15] about this morning that even brother
[34:16] Branham when he was born again where was
[34:18] he born again faith
[34:21] but God could lead him to the deeper
[34:24] depths of the word because he was the
[34:26] prophet
[34:27] a man can't teach you only what he is
[34:31] let's let me give him the scripture uh
[34:33] the husband must be first partaker of
[34:35] the fruit
[34:37] couldn't preach about the Statue of a
[34:39] perfect man until right can you achieved
[34:42] that Amen in his life all right I could
[34:46] preach about your seals until God
[34:47] revealed him died amen
[34:49] how much honest it's been big I tried to
[34:52] everybody's attracted him but then when
[34:53] he revealed it to me then 82 and 83 then
[34:57] I haven't preached it I preached it for
[34:59] Words some things on it but I haven't
[35:01] went back over each seal individually
[35:03] because I didn't feel that too
[35:05] never have feel that dude I believe it
[35:07] stands Amen to this day I preached on
[35:09] Daniel 70 weeks in 1974. and I haven't
[35:13] chosen I have spoke on it in times like
[35:17] 2005 I think
[35:19] I was covering it but never like I did
[35:22] back there because I didn't feel like it
[35:25] was needed all right but get know what
[35:28] I'm saying on the death Pentecost you've
[35:30] got two different groups of people
[35:32] one group of people that had been
[35:34] tutored and the depth of the word that
[35:37] they had and the Holy Ghost falling to
[35:39] Quicken that word because that's what
[35:41] the scripture said you bring you
[35:42] remembers whatsoever I'm saying right so
[35:45] he quickened to them what they had
[35:46] planted in their field or their their
[35:48] being you know
[35:49] and that gave them a deeper depth of the
[35:52] word of God and God chose those people
[35:55] right for the basics of the writing of
[35:57] the New Testament you only have a couple
[35:59] in there like Timothy or one of them but
[36:01] those were trained under Paul right to
[36:03] bring you know the message and that's
[36:05] what Peter was doing as we were reading
[36:07] this morning
[36:08] a second Peter added your faith virtue
[36:10] and all this temporary Faith Peter was
[36:12] teaching those people how to come door
[36:15] that had the new birth right how to come
[36:18] to where he was in the new world Amen
[36:20] and that's what brother Reynold was
[36:22] doing right he was trying to tell those
[36:24] Pentecostals see that had the baptism of
[36:26] the Holy Ghost and he didn't deny that
[36:28] they had it okay
[36:29] sir
[36:30] you see all that this didn't have it and
[36:32] I see you're going wrong
[36:34] that's right you're going wrong and just
[36:37] say people don't have it that's right
[36:38] then you'll start saying the lutherans
[36:40] don't have it and the methodists don't
[36:42] have it and the Baptists don't have it
[36:44] maybe that's what people is doing they
[36:46] they've made those into doctrines
[36:49] that it turned out to where it wouldn't
[36:51] be correct right but anybody that's born
[36:54] again has the New Birth the new birth is
[36:57] put you into the body of Christ are you
[37:00] going to leave Luther and Wesley him out
[37:01] of it
[37:03] we have went through the years of the
[37:04] teaching that even in the children of
[37:07] Israel with their Journey going into the
[37:08] Promised Land
[37:10] you remember they were two and a half
[37:12] tribes that went over and fought out
[37:14] with the children of Israel through
[37:15] Canaan right but they came back and took
[37:17] their inheritance on this side of Jordan
[37:21] we'll study your Bible with her in the
[37:22] Old Testament we'll see that two and a
[37:24] half tribes which Lutheran the West
[37:26] Limbs and the people through there and
[37:27] you're you're uh people coming along
[37:30] into the pilgrim Holiness and different
[37:33] things you know right
[37:34] and coming in there that
[37:38] didn't walk on with the word they went
[37:40] into the land showing that they had it
[37:42] right but they came back and took their
[37:45] inheritance right right all right that's
[37:47] that's all the way through your Bible
[37:48] all right that's right now well see
[37:52] that's why I believe that the new birth
[37:54] is the new birth
[37:56] it's the birth of the word of whatever
[37:58] age you see it
[38:00] all right man and I was telling Aaron I
[38:03] told my wife and brother and sister
[38:05] Tatum one time that this brother was
[38:08] going to read a certain way out of the
[38:10] church age book
[38:11] the only time I ever missed services but
[38:13] you know I guess in my life just about
[38:16] it
[38:17] I have a great big old Ryerson that was
[38:19] really boil a couple they're really
[38:22] killing me and uh
[38:25] I told myself I'm not going this morning
[38:27] but I said the brother's going to read
[38:29] that
[38:29] now the church age book
[38:32] and you remember running around them in
[38:34] the church yet booked talking about the
[38:35] Lutheran age
[38:36] and he said it's the on full Field age
[38:43] that's what he calls it he called wet
[38:45] Luther's age the unfulfilled
[38:48] I said here's the way he's going to read
[38:52] he's going to read to try to prove his
[38:54] point that Luther didn't have the
[38:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost and he's going
[38:58] to read that to say that it was an
[39:00] unfilled age
[39:04] and that's what he done exactly believe
[39:06] in the sister corrected him he said I
[39:10] was all the same thing he said his
[39:11] unfulfilled age unfilled age they didn't
[39:12] have the Holy Ghost back there
[39:14] well I I can't go that way I'm just
[39:17] sorry I wish I could in some respects
[39:20] because I like to be liked and friendly
[39:22] but I still got to make my stand amen
[39:25] that's right to be what I am all right
[39:26] and I believe that the baptism of the
[39:29] Holy Ghost that ever born again believer
[39:31] got it just like the book of Acts amen
[39:34] because you would tear up Acts 2. yeah
[39:37] right you would have to rewrite the
[39:39] Bible because according to the Bible it
[39:42] says the promise is what
[39:45] unto you
[39:47] and your children
[39:50] and them that are far off and it means
[39:52] our Lord shall call amen is the promise
[39:55] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost see
[39:56] you'd have to write that that's right
[39:58] that the Holy Ghost is to the disciples
[40:00] only and then in the end time so and so
[40:03] is going to tell you when he gets it
[40:04] yeah
[40:05] because that what's their point
[40:08] the brothers I said about the thunder
[40:10] message he said I'll tell you when this
[40:12] and the brother about the the point of
[40:15] saying no Holy Ghost Doctrine he was
[40:17] plainly saying I'll tell you when you
[40:19] got it
[40:20] well um
[40:22] I like to be nice but you know I just
[40:26] don't believe it though all right man
[40:27] I'm sorry I believe that everybody has
[40:30] an opportunity to receive the new birth
[40:32] right amen amen I believe the new birth
[40:34] and I've taught you over and over in the
[40:36] days of Luther was the New Birth that
[40:38] was the just you'll live by faith amen
[40:40] that's right and if you and I are not
[40:42] anchored on that or what Luther called
[40:43] it the truth not what he thought of the
[40:45] wrong thing right but what he thought of
[40:48] the truth we're anchored on that or we
[40:49] don't have no anchor right amen see
[40:52] you're cutting your own legs out and
[40:53] under you you don't have nowhere to
[40:54] stand in the gospel and you're leaving
[40:56] yourself out of the message but it's
[40:59] because of people
[41:00] I told you that I talked to a man down
[41:02] at the schoolhouse we're having a supper
[41:04] and I told him these things and he said
[41:06] no Lutheran Wesley said they didn't have
[41:08] the Holy Ghost and said brother random
[41:10] said Zeus or Street was false I said
[41:13] right I didn't say that
[41:24] you know they come right here and he
[41:27] said told the same thing did Lutheran
[41:29] Wesley didn't have the Holy Ghost since
[41:30] then he calls for false
[41:32] because he wouldn't take correction
[41:34] right
[41:35] right and already told him down there
[41:37] that he was wrong
[41:38] of course you know that didn't make no
[41:39] difference
[41:41] no no and these Fellers you know they've
[41:44] got their own ideas
[41:46] that's their business
[41:48] the truth is what I'm like
[41:50] I'm asking you a simple point
[41:54] do you believe
[41:56] the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[41:59] you're here today
[42:01] for you amen if you want to receive it
[42:04] and attack baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[42:06] exactly like the day of Pentecost
[42:11] yeah because if you don't believe that
[42:12] what do you got to stand up that's right
[42:14] right yep what what would be your hopes
[42:18] what would be your your doing you know
[42:21] of anything
[42:23] I mean how much base mine up on the word
[42:25] amen right and I'm not trying to
[42:27] convince you whether or not I have the
[42:29] Holy Spirit
[42:30] right
[42:33] I'm not trying to convince no one of
[42:34] that never happens
[42:36] I'm trying to get you to see it's for
[42:38] you right
[42:40] but if you don't believe it's fire you
[42:41] see you'll never seek it that's right
[42:43] I've always tried to encourage you I had
[42:47] rather seek God all my life and find out
[42:50] I've got something yes that do not seek
[42:52] Him and come to the end to find out I
[42:54] don't have it all right well I seek God
[42:56] every day brother Dale yes I pray every
[42:59] day God feel this whole being fill me
[43:02] with the holy spirit
[43:04] amen amen there's one brother Brown
[43:07] parade sometimes hard to pray
[43:10] I'm gonna run prayed one day he said
[43:12] Lord said you short me in other words
[43:15] you you cut him off he Surety
[43:17] you're right pronounce that word
[43:20] he said you took my wife and daughter
[43:25] he said do it again Lord
[43:28] do it again
[43:31] you think he was meaning take away my my
[43:34] boy and my second wife and whatever you
[43:36] know no he was asking God to bring him
[43:40] down we're listening to a tape last
[43:43] night
[43:44] uh what is the Holy Ghost
[43:47] in 59 and brought around him on there
[43:50] was saying the Lord you know bring him
[43:52] into that place
[43:53] do whatever you got to do to bring me to
[43:56] the place that I can get rid of William
[43:58] Branham and let me stand on God's word
[44:03] no matter what you have to do Lord
[44:07] well
[44:09] that's where I want to be don't you
[44:12] isn't that the thing that we're here for
[44:15] that's right just to hear the truth but
[44:17] it says the truth she'll Set You Free
[44:19] Part truth won't set us free right
[44:22] part truth will bind us to a doctrine of
[44:25] some issue amen well after a day you
[44:27] don't know them brothers was trying to
[44:29] know when I cried
[44:30] all right I'm just telling you what I
[44:32] know
[44:34] I'm telling you what I personally
[44:36] experienced those people sitting in the
[44:38] building here right now that experience
[44:39] those things too
[44:42] about this about the Holy Ghost and
[44:44] whether it is
[44:45] all I'm trying to do is get you to see
[44:47] the road around the city for you
[44:51] now the New Birth when you first
[44:52] received the new birth no you don't
[44:54] receive the new birth up here
[44:58] that's what everybody wants
[45:00] they want a quick fix
[45:02] yeah grab it all at one time let's get
[45:04] out of here
[45:05] yeah no never born again believer
[45:09] he's going to get a faith that's right
[45:12] the disciples were the only 120. that's
[45:15] not a Church of Christ Doctrine it's
[45:17] only the 12 had it either now that's the
[45:20] truth of the Gospel right
[45:24] yeah that's what they teach you they say
[45:25] well I'm in the 12-handed that's where
[45:27] brother run said well what about Paul
[45:29] he said what about worried or die and
[45:31] it's in the church all the way down
[45:32] through then they couldn't argue
[45:35] would you say that's why brother random
[45:37] would say I met people that had the
[45:39] genuine baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:42] he said well did they grab everything he
[45:44] said no
[45:47] because it wouldn't today right
[45:49] it wasn't the time they had no
[45:52] background that's it
[45:54] amen people don't even understand the
[45:56] zoosa street go read a little bit
[46:01] Azusa Street 1906 was trinitarian people
[46:06] the Oneness Doctrine never started until
[46:08] about 19 and 12. right
[46:12] see then they went on and the cabbage
[46:14] down wrote around and said on that
[46:16] go read
[46:18] run around and say something go read it
[46:21] see what said well you didn't know you
[46:24] got time to listen to all kind of false
[46:26] Doctrine that's right and garbage cans
[46:29] yep I'm sorry that's plenty at least
[46:33] what I want to do and what I'm trying to
[46:34] do in my life is put mine into the
[46:36] message and I listen to people to hear
[46:38] what they're saying
[46:40] everything
[46:41] just because this man here went against
[46:43] me about this Doctrine I've never had it
[46:46] never had no issue with him the man
[46:48] where I left the church from that's
[46:50] preached twice in this church since I've
[46:52] been the pasture
[46:55] but he won't let me go to his church and
[46:57] preach
[46:58] but he preached two times right here and
[47:00] I'm happy
[47:02] I thank the world right amen
[47:05] if I needed anything in the world the
[47:07] man would do anything I can believe in
[47:08] the world to help me
[47:10] that's right his wonderful brother but I
[47:12] just can't agree with him but I've been
[47:14] honest with him to tally yeah
[47:18] we were done Colorado and he kept
[47:20] telling his brother every time something
[47:21] would come up he says that's why I left
[47:22] my church
[47:24] that was nice
[47:26] listen
[47:28] blueberry broad salvation that's why he
[47:30] left my church and I bit my tongue the
[47:32] second time I tried to do it
[47:34] third time he said listen he done told
[47:37] you three times I left his church I said
[47:39] I'm gonna tell you why
[47:41] that I left yesterday yeah I said
[47:43] because he's been brought it up three
[47:45] times I tried to be nice
[47:47] but I'm just on this I'm just trying to
[47:49] be myself
[47:50] and I still love people right amen now
[47:53] that preacher to preached here it is on
[47:54] you didn't believe exactly the way we
[47:57] believe
[48:00] but I only had one man that's ever come
[48:02] here that I trusted to the pope he had
[48:04] to come here and try to preach something
[48:05] that wouldn't write
[48:09] and you know I still love the brother
[48:14] I just didn't know what he said and I
[48:17] came and straightened it out all right
[48:18] that's just all the problem but now
[48:21] listen
[48:23] right around him I've given you these
[48:25] before so you can pull these up and let
[48:27] a slice read to get down just a few
[48:28] things
[48:29] on what we're talking about
[48:31] page 143 of the church age book The
[48:33] Samaritan Church age the church age book
[48:36] all right
[48:38] and we've read these many times before
[48:39] but you ought to be able to see what I'm
[48:41] talking about in every age and every age
[48:42] is the age of the Holy Ghost or the True
[48:44] Believer
[48:46] now that's as blunt as can anybody can
[48:48] be right I say in every age the evidence
[48:51] was the same
[48:53] come on those who had the spirit the
[48:56] teacher heard to work and that spirit in
[48:58] them took the word and called it
[48:59] revealed it to them and they were the
[49:01] group that heard the messenger and his
[49:03] message and took it again amen that's
[49:05] Luther Wesley Pentecostal Baptist
[49:08] Presbyterian all of those people had
[49:10] truths at the time right have you ever
[49:13] noticed one thing how about you
[49:14] explaining some things to me
[49:17] brother random in about 19 and 16.
[49:21] I'm pretty sure it's 62 but I'll find it
[49:23] for you maybe 60.
[49:25] but I'm pretty sure it's 1962. brother
[49:28] said made a statement that was
[49:29] astounding to me
[49:31] he said the Baptist has just become a
[49:33] denomination
[49:37] you see I knew where we came from and
[49:40] how long we how far we was behind
[49:43] a hundred years before then right the
[49:46] Badness was a denomination
[49:49] what's he saying
[49:51] you know that really those people never
[49:53] become Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[49:56] Lutheran uh anything you want to bring
[49:58] out you know that when brother Brown
[50:00] stood there with the word that's when
[50:02] they showed their code right right
[50:05] when he brought the word that's when
[50:08] they showed their code all right amen
[50:10] you take that and think about it see
[50:12] then you can see the Baptist become a
[50:14] denomination after they wouldn't accept
[50:16] what brought around had to say
[50:18] so did all denominations denominate and
[50:21] die right
[50:23] because they wouldn't accept the truth
[50:26] of the hour it was offered unto him he
[50:28] came through the Baptist Church
[50:32] and then went on through trying to
[50:34] preach to the other churches and and
[50:36] going out to him but never denying
[50:39] what he believed is a Baptist
[50:42] he said we beat him in the back they
[50:43] come through with something no no
[50:46] that's it he never argued with anybody
[50:48] about what they believed right
[50:51] he just said I just didn't see that
[50:54] he said now you asked me and I just tell
[50:57] you I can't see it like that right well
[50:59] that was a wonderful brother
[51:02] but he still called them brothers right
[51:06] right
[51:07] he said one day to Billy Graham would
[51:09] see the truth
[51:10] you want that quote
[51:14] I don't know
[51:17] he said Owen Roberts had the bad kids
[51:18] you said well chapter no anyone now you
[51:21] go I heard you were brother random I
[51:22] don't know what he meant right you don't
[51:24] either amen that's right you're just
[51:27] trying to justify something
[51:29] but you see those brothers that walked
[51:31] away from him
[51:35] the demonstrikarian
[51:39] all of those people that walked away
[51:40] from blood around them Oxford and all
[51:45] he never said they didn't have it that's
[51:47] right
[51:48] you showed me
[51:51] what you see you'll say when I know them
[51:53] people ain't got it what all right
[51:55] just remember
[51:58] there was a time you called you believed
[52:01] you had the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[52:02] and you were sitting listening to error
[52:05] being talked to it right and hollering
[52:07] amen
[52:10] and don't even do it today here right is
[52:13] that running up amen
[52:16] right it won't even amen it now
[52:19] but you amen didn't shout and run all
[52:21] over the place
[52:23] you know why it's because it was lack of
[52:25] understanding right
[52:27] that's right let's let God be the judge
[52:29] of what things are Amen Let Him decide
[52:33] who's what
[52:34] and you and I just go ahead and be
[52:36] Brothers and Sisters in Christ we run
[52:38] around and said what no let's go to
[52:40] number two
[52:41] every age with the age of the baptism
[52:44] when the Holy Ghost
[52:46] what was the Holy Ghost given for the
[52:48] prophet said same Holy Spirit to save
[52:50] the lutherans the Sanctified the
[52:52] methodists that baptized the Pentecostal
[52:54] is now set in order the coming of the
[52:55] Lord Jesus when it'll be so powerful
[52:57] that body will come into this group a
[52:59] church that'll draw the rest of them
[53:00] from the grave there will be a
[53:02] resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost
[53:04] is for
[53:09] right who led Luther to the Joshua live
[53:12] by faith that's right if it was not an
[53:16] inward experience of his own work you
[53:18] know God's work for him come on
[53:21] but now
[53:22] we're going to read quite a few
[53:25] to where you say well brother Dale you
[53:27] just hollering about something and
[53:29] saying something but let's just read and
[53:31] see what brought around had to say go
[53:32] ahead to number three do you have the
[53:34] new birth do you have the baptism when
[53:36] the Holy Ghost it's the same holy ghost
[53:39] that came on to be a Pentecost which you
[53:40] have
[53:43] all right let's see what the prophet
[53:44] that you said
[53:45] you've heard of Dr Reed had listened to
[53:48] brother Brown
[53:49] 1953.
[53:52] 11 29 the evening service a message
[53:54] called testimony and I said it is Dr
[53:57] Reed head because he had come to him to
[53:58] talk her brother Ronald had went to him
[54:00] he had contacted him and if you remember
[54:03] I believe this is the one that made some
[54:04] remarks about brother Brown and wrote
[54:06] around was so nice when he invited he
[54:07] came to it you know he apologized to him
[54:10] about it that may be wrong about that
[54:11] part but just read above it you'll get
[54:13] it
[54:13] he said I said it is Dr Reed head God is
[54:16] my judge the same holy ghost that fell
[54:18] on Pentecost it's the same Lord Jesus
[54:21] today in the full thing kind of power
[54:25] all right he said can I receive it I
[54:27] said yes sir
[54:28] should win a lot of people say well you
[54:31] can't get it right the doctrine if you
[54:34] say you don't believe us here then you
[54:35] would say it's not here so you'd have to
[54:37] tell Dr Reid head no you can't get it
[54:41] because it ain't here
[54:43] but that wasn't what he had to say
[54:45] no he said when I said I said right now
[54:49] I said how did I get it I said by laying
[54:51] on the hands pray for him laid hands on
[54:52] him God gave him the baptism of the Holy
[54:56] Ghost 1953.
[54:59] all right
[55:01] look at the next one the resurrection
[55:04] e94. I believe he's the same God that
[55:07] was back there the same holy ghost that
[55:08] fell on the dead of Pentecost is the
[55:10] same holy ghost that we feel right here
[55:11] now believe us now this I believe the
[55:15] same power that preached the gospel all
[55:18] night by Paul
[55:20] when a man fell and killed himself Paul
[55:23] is laid his body over his body and he
[55:26] received life again I believe that same
[55:28] holy ghost power is right here
[55:31] he is right here to Fascinate a bunch of
[55:34] people that will make them sit hours
[55:36] after hours in an old hot building to
[55:39] listen to The Glorious gospel of Christ
[55:41] believe it's not this
[55:43] sound like he's talking about the same
[55:44] Holy Ghost Paul man yeah lick the next
[55:47] one
[55:49] 1954 12 19 even acts of the Holy Ghost
[55:52] he's the same yesterday today and
[55:53] forever
[55:54] the same holy ghost that fell into their
[55:57] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost as
[55:59] today what I'll admit it's been trapped
[56:02] on made fun of
[56:04] misinterpreted misrepresented and
[56:07] everything else like that that's only
[56:09] the devil counterfeiting but there is a
[56:12] real genuine baptism of the holy spirit
[56:14] that brings the same results that they
[56:16] had on the date of Pentecost that's
[56:18] right
[56:20] all right click the next one
[56:24] 1955 6-12
[56:26] now watch in a minute we're going to
[56:27] drop over because I just asked you to go
[56:30] home and just run into your computer
[56:33] and run in the same Holy Ghost as
[56:36] Pentecost let's run again there's a lot
[56:38] more that I didn't bring because you'll
[56:40] see that I'll drop from the 50s and
[56:42] we'll drop
[56:44] 64.65. the show that's before and after
[56:46] the seals and everything else all right
[56:48] so what's what he says on the message
[56:49] presence of the Lord 55 6 12. I believe
[56:52] he said if you abide in me and my words
[56:54] and you ask what you will and it'll be
[56:56] given to you believe us all this amen I
[56:58] believe he's the same yesterday today
[57:00] and forever he's Everlasting peace the
[57:02] same holy ghost that fell into their
[57:03] Pentecost it's here tonight believe us
[57:06] now this
[57:08] now the doctrine was that brother
[57:10] Branham had that Holy Spirit
[57:12] but nobody else didn't have it well now
[57:15] he said Dr Reed had received it right
[57:18] and he said it was here first
[57:20] so if it was for one man Dr reedhead
[57:22] that solves the problem issues over with
[57:25] you have no argument right right no
[57:28] don't try to quote all of the quote you
[57:30] have no argument
[57:31] if there's anyone because we're gonna
[57:33] get to one in a minute
[57:34] how many of you will shout glory to
[57:36] Hallelujah that brother Brown was at a
[57:38] meeting one day when the Holy Spirit
[57:40] came in and swept across the building
[57:42] and even his coat was just moving you've
[57:45] heard the story
[57:47] he said that's the same holy ghost that
[57:49] fell on the dead pentagon
[57:51] we'll get to that in a minute okay go
[57:54] ahead to the next one
[57:58] 1956 1006 a wedding supper and now on
[58:01] the western people that's who we are now
[58:03] in this Western Hemisphere here it's
[58:06] poured out the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[58:08] the son has come out to shine again on
[58:10] the at the setting just as it did at the
[58:13] rising and the same holy ghost that fell
[58:15] on the Eastern people 2000 years ago has
[58:18] been Shattered by Creeds and
[58:20] denominations coming across this day of
[58:22] dark
[58:23] day of dark nor light but in the evening
[58:26] time while she's setting the baptism
[58:28] when the Holy Ghost was poured out on
[58:29] the western people with the same portion
[58:32] the same signs and the same Wonders that
[58:34] they did on the Eastern people just
[58:36] exactly amen
[58:37] looks like he's building pretty good
[58:39] case don't it go ahead to the next one
[58:44] 1959 812 Discerning the body of the Lord
[58:47] that's how we discern to see if our
[58:50] discernment is right if the Bible said
[58:52] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[58:54] forever believe it it's the Bible if
[58:56] Jesus said the things that I do shall
[58:58] you do I believe it and if the Bible
[59:00] said that the Holy Ghost is forever
[59:03] generation as many as the Lord Our God
[59:05] shall call I don't believe a handshake
[59:09] takes its place I believe the same holy
[59:12] ghost that fell then shows the same
[59:13] signs the same wonders and for every
[59:16] generation right okay for that big Bible
[59:19] right
[59:20] do you and your children
[59:22] and then we're the far off the minister
[59:24] Lord Our God shall call right that was
[59:26] the promise look at the next one
[59:30] 1965-15 eating and service adoption
[59:32] which they put them down part one part
[59:34] two part three for this new message
[59:35] system to use it all right
[59:39] not just sunk not just some to the
[59:42] apostles and some to this but he's
[59:45] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[59:47] the same holy ghost that fell into their
[59:49] Pentecost is the same Holy Ghost here
[59:51] tonight the same holy ghost that made
[59:53] Mary shout and speak with tongues and
[59:55] have a wonderful time and rejoice in the
[59:58] things that she did is the same Holy
[1:00:00] Ghost here tonight the same holy ghost
[1:00:01] that led Paul on that Old Ship where it
[1:00:04] looked like it was waterlogged and was
[1:00:06] gone 14 days and nights no moon or Stars
[1:00:09] he looked out there in every way you had
[1:00:12] a devil on it glancing and gleaming his
[1:00:15] teeth and said I'll sing the old boy
[1:00:18] same Holy Ghost
[1:00:20] okay next
[1:00:23] 1962 see we're just getting lower and
[1:00:26] closer and closer because I swear
[1:00:27] children
[1:00:28] all right 62 122 confirmation of the
[1:00:32] commission but remember it was promised
[1:00:34] that all clouds would clear away in the
[1:00:36] evening time it's evening time now and
[1:00:38] when the clouds are all clear away that
[1:00:40] same Sun s-o-n that shined his power
[1:00:43] through the Holy Ghost upon the Eastern
[1:00:45] people has in the last 50 years broke
[1:00:48] back the clouds of denominations and
[1:00:50] everything and poured down the Holy
[1:00:52] Ghost upon the Western people that the
[1:00:55] same Sun same Holy Ghost same sign same
[1:00:57] lights same power same evidence and
[1:01:00] everything that it was and the gospel
[1:01:03] had been preached with power and
[1:01:04] demonstration anywhere in the countries
[1:01:07] that's right that's right all over the
[1:01:09] world signed and wonders that are Fallen
[1:01:11] to Believers next
[1:01:16] 1964. now you see where we're at
[1:01:19] after the seals in case some of the
[1:01:21] people out there there's a doctor among
[1:01:22] the people that brother Brown was right
[1:01:24] after the seals broke but he was all
[1:01:26] messed up before it was broke
[1:01:28] he said he thought taught three
[1:01:30] processes from birth that's 1964. future
[1:01:33] home
[1:01:34] and he always taught it that away go
[1:01:36] read as you said
[1:01:38] 1964 416 when the rides were open they
[1:01:40] knew him he's talking about still this
[1:01:43] is the dead and the you know raising the
[1:01:45] dead and appeared in the last days when
[1:01:47] they said years ago when the Pentecostal
[1:01:49] group first started
[1:01:51] now watch what he's saying there was no
[1:01:52] such a thing as that when they first
[1:01:55] started it's the fastest growing Church
[1:01:57] in the world the Pentecost it's the
[1:02:00] message they they've had now for 50
[1:02:03] years they said it couldn't be done but
[1:02:05] it was done anyhow they said there was
[1:02:07] no such thing as the Holy Ghost the
[1:02:09] people went on and received it just the
[1:02:11] same God promised he would pour out his
[1:02:13] Spirit how are you going to stop it when
[1:02:15] he promised he he would do it they said
[1:02:18] nobody will believe it but they did
[1:02:20] believe it
[1:02:22] and that's all that I'm trying to say to
[1:02:24] you and I if if that devil can put any
[1:02:27] doubt in your mind that the Holy Ghost
[1:02:29] is for you you'll keep you from
[1:02:30] receiving it all right amen
[1:02:33] amen that's right but if you can take
[1:02:35] the word and say the prophet said it
[1:02:37] nothing else right
[1:02:40] the prophet had to say look at what is
[1:02:42] this one
[1:02:44] drop back 1950 look at this one 115
[1:02:47] believe it's all this on the death
[1:02:48] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell down
[1:02:50] from heaven our Mana after we've come
[1:02:53] through the blood and have been saved
[1:02:55] been cleansed from our sins and the Holy
[1:02:57] Ghost fell brother Peter said on the
[1:02:59] death Pentecost is for you and your
[1:03:00] children and for them to so far off as
[1:03:02] many as the Lord Our God shall call and
[1:03:05] every person that enters into the
[1:03:06] baptism of the Holy Spirit can have the
[1:03:09] same kind of holy ghost that they got on
[1:03:11] the death Pentecost Hallelujah I believe
[1:03:13] it's God's truth not something that
[1:03:16] looked like it but the real thing same
[1:03:18] kind of holy ghost that fell back to our
[1:03:20] Falls now the same kind of whole the
[1:03:23] real Holy Ghost brings forth the same
[1:03:25] kind of an Evidence and proves that they
[1:03:28] had backgone comes with the same Holy
[1:03:30] Ghost hallelujah amen and how good you
[1:03:33] say I like this oh I feel it right now
[1:03:37] that's right it's real Justice Just as
[1:03:40] real as it ever was to me that's right
[1:03:43] just the same holy spirit that fell back
[1:03:45] there on the day of Pentecost all right
[1:03:50] go to the next one
[1:03:54] 54 8 11 shorts the father I think when
[1:03:57] you see a power of God switch through a
[1:04:00] meeting it means this that Jesus Christ
[1:04:02] is living somewhere hallelujah it's the
[1:04:07] same holy ghost power that raised him up
[1:04:09] on the day of Pentecost and give them
[1:04:10] the blessing of God that power is still
[1:04:13] in existence somewhere
[1:04:16] come on now
[1:04:17] when you can see a church that's
[1:04:19] together with God what a marvelous thing
[1:04:21] God in this universe
[1:04:23] to a shall learn go to the next one
[1:04:27] the interview 56 121
[1:04:31] Peter settled to death Pentecost Acts 2
[1:04:33] he said for the promises unto you and to
[1:04:35] your children to them that far off and
[1:04:37] even as men as the Lord Our God shall
[1:04:39] call the same holy spirit that failed
[1:04:41] was forever generation even to the
[1:04:44] Gentiles those that were always
[1:04:46] considered far off even as men as the
[1:04:49] Lord and our God shall call Peter said
[1:04:51] repent every one of you and be baptized
[1:04:52] in the name of Jesus Christ for their
[1:04:54] mission of sins and you shall receive
[1:04:56] the gifts of the Holy Ghost for the
[1:04:57] promises unto you and your children into
[1:05:00] the Gentiles that's far off even as many
[1:05:02] as the Lord Our God shall call and as
[1:05:06] long as God's still calling God's still
[1:05:09] given the Holy Spirit
[1:05:10] they kept almonds full of that and they
[1:05:12] talked about back in the Old Testament
[1:05:14] when they kept always full of that of
[1:05:17] that of it that every man entered into
[1:05:21] the holy place you know the new high
[1:05:22] priest would even come in the new high
[1:05:24] priest was allowed to take a a piece of
[1:05:26] bread from the original right you kept
[1:05:29] almonds of that every man aired into the
[1:05:31] Holy Spirit every priest could taste a
[1:05:34] mouthful of the original amount that
[1:05:36] fell in the beginning and so is it today
[1:05:38] the middle wall of petition is taken
[1:05:40] down and every man that's called can
[1:05:42] come in and have a heart full of the
[1:05:44] same holy ghost that fell on the death
[1:05:45] Pentecost it'll be to the end of the
[1:05:48] world
[1:05:52] now listen this one
[1:05:55] and people want to quote I've had people
[1:05:57] to tell me about this quote that said
[1:05:59] the Holy Ghost wasn't here
[1:06:03] the same one that told me the Holy Ghost
[1:06:04] wasn't here like it was in the book of
[1:06:06] Acts quoted this to me
[1:06:11] come on
[1:06:13] 258 128 the Oneness of unity what was
[1:06:16] that
[1:06:17] get that tape listen to it
[1:06:20] just like the Holy Spirit Come On To
[1:06:22] Death in the call come right down the
[1:06:24] wind just swept over here
[1:06:26] him and he's a witness of it raise your
[1:06:28] hand
[1:06:29] everyone honest from your heart there it
[1:06:32] is it's went right through the building
[1:06:33] just then it's the same Holy Ghost the
[1:06:35] same Holy Ghost comes by the same word
[1:06:37] blessed be the name of the Lord amen
[1:06:40] amen it's the same Holy Ghost
[1:06:43] the same one that justified the Lutheran
[1:06:45] Sanctified the message baptized the
[1:06:46] Pentecost now sit in order to come into
[1:06:48] the Lord go to the next one
[1:06:50] I think we got about two more or three
[1:06:52] more
[1:06:53] all right we're back at 63 now 7 31
[1:06:56] after the opening of the seals there is
[1:06:59] only one way provided by God for
[1:07:01] anything reached in 1963-731.
[1:07:04] them days has passed yeah that's what
[1:07:06] people you know watch
[1:07:10] people tell you that yeah you think that
[1:07:13] stopped that hunger-hearted people they
[1:07:15] took a hold on this word and know that
[1:07:18] the Bible said
[1:07:19] the promises unto you and to your
[1:07:21] children to them that's far off in his
[1:07:22] men as the Lord Our God shall call they
[1:07:24] stay there on their faces and cried and
[1:07:26] begged and kicked up their heels and
[1:07:29] screamed until God poured out the same
[1:07:31] Holy Ghost upon them that he did at the
[1:07:34] beginning amen what is it it's God's
[1:07:37] provided way that's right they believed
[1:07:40] it and God provided the way for them
[1:07:41] Peter gave them the provided way on the
[1:07:44] day of Pentecost check and see if he's
[1:07:46] not talking about Azusa Street go to
[1:07:48] that message write it down check it see
[1:07:49] if anything what he's talking about
[1:07:51] see a juicers treat people like dirt
[1:07:53] prayed until God sent them to baptism of
[1:07:56] the holy God right all right look
[1:07:57] tonight
[1:08:00] 1963 801 a paradox
[1:08:03] for me to live is Christ have it you
[1:08:05] know I believe that that same God that's
[1:08:07] on to their Pentecost upon his church
[1:08:09] as a pillar of fire and divide into
[1:08:11] himself with glowing tongues among his
[1:08:13] people he's here tonight it's the same
[1:08:15] God he was then
[1:08:17] he is today with the same Holy Ghost I
[1:08:20] know it's a paradox it cannot be
[1:08:22] explained emotion screaming crying and
[1:08:25] so forth cannot be explained but it's a
[1:08:27] paradox how God does it it's the Unseen
[1:08:30] God dwelling in the human heart making
[1:08:32] himself visible by vindicating his word
[1:08:35] that he is the same yesterday today and
[1:08:37] forever go ahead to the next
[1:08:41] 1963-1216 we have senior starting in the
[1:08:43] East and have come to worship Him
[1:08:45] or he's the same yesterday today and
[1:08:47] forever for the promises and Peter said
[1:08:49] on the day of Pentecost repent over one
[1:08:51] of them be baptized in the name of Jesus
[1:08:52] Christ for their mission to sin and ye
[1:08:54] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:08:55] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:08:57] children to them that's far off even as
[1:08:59] many as the Lord Our God shall call as
[1:09:01] many as ever called the same Holy Ghost
[1:09:05] tonight is just the same it was then to
[1:09:08] the honest heart
[1:09:10] look what he said to the honest heart
[1:09:13] if it doesn't
[1:09:15] it is too unusual for you to believe God
[1:09:19] is it too unusual for you to believe God
[1:09:21] okay look at the mice and I think Mercy
[1:09:23] two more all right
[1:09:25] influence should break 64.
[1:09:28] look look up here
[1:09:30] see here in the way God has got a way to
[1:09:33] prepare how did he do it on the day of
[1:09:36] Pentecost Peter told them what to do he
[1:09:38] wrote a prescription for them and it's
[1:09:39] always remained the sign
[1:09:42] prescription every age has been the same
[1:09:44] right don't tamper with it you'll kill
[1:09:46] your patient
[1:09:48] that's what most of the people have done
[1:09:50] spiritually
[1:09:51] has killed the people of this message by
[1:09:53] their Doctrine I'm sorry
[1:09:55] they said what can we do to be saved he
[1:09:58] said repent I want to be baptized out of
[1:09:59] the name of Jesus Christ remission sin
[1:10:01] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:10:02] Holy Ghost for the promises unto you and
[1:10:04] your children to them that are far off
[1:10:05] as many as the Lord Our God shall call
[1:10:07] I'm going to read face because they've
[1:10:09] done right
[1:10:10] that's right here that's right here
[1:10:12] tonight if God is still calling that's
[1:10:14] the prescription you can still receive
[1:10:16] the same holy ghost that they received
[1:10:18] there just you can receive the same
[1:10:20] thing tonight just follow through that's
[1:10:22] all you do yes then you can say
[1:10:26] all right look at that I think it's the
[1:10:28] last one
[1:10:30] maybe she called first 1965 919
[1:10:34] we got a living God not one that died
[1:10:37] 1900 years ago and stayed in the grave
[1:10:39] but one that raised again Hebrews 13 8
[1:10:42] says he's the same yesterday today and
[1:10:43] forever the same holy ghost that fell on
[1:10:45] the death Pentecost is the same Holy
[1:10:47] Ghost that's here now he is the
[1:10:49] satisfying portion because he is the
[1:10:51] word that's right the Holy Ghost wrote
[1:10:53] the word he interprets the word the
[1:10:55] Bible said
[1:10:57] in second Peter that the Holy Spirit
[1:10:59] wrote the word man of old move by the
[1:11:02] Holy Ghost wrote the Bible
[1:11:04] now you can't do it you can't satisfy
[1:11:07] that Holy Spirit with nothing less than
[1:11:10] God himself living in you and the person
[1:11:12] of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:14] if that's not enough quotes and things
[1:11:16] to be able to
[1:11:18] to say well
[1:11:21] at least the prophet says is here
[1:11:30] like I said the doctrine was that
[1:11:33] nobody had perfect love
[1:11:36] brother random said you've got to have
[1:11:38] perfect love to go beyond the curtain of
[1:11:40] time
[1:11:42] but everybody that has the New Birth has
[1:11:44] perfect love
[1:11:46] really our love is not perfected right I
[1:11:49] agree with you there
[1:11:51] I agree that we
[1:11:54] need
[1:11:55] but the new birth is perfect love right
[1:11:57] amen the new birth is the Life of Christ
[1:12:00] amen see we start with a foundation then
[1:12:03] we can grow that's right
[1:12:06] for 40 years we've been preaching this
[1:12:09] and trying to grow
[1:12:11] yeah
[1:12:13] when others it went to everything in the
[1:12:15] book to solve their thirst
[1:12:18] you know
[1:12:19] and well that was a lot of doctrines and
[1:12:22] all kind of issues
[1:12:23] that's all right that's their business
[1:12:26] ain't gonna do with them
[1:12:28] you got to do who don't try my best to
[1:12:30] Pastor all right man anybody else wants
[1:12:33] to listen that's fine
[1:12:35] you say but yet you just don't
[1:12:37] understand well you show me what the
[1:12:39] prophet said contrary to what I said
[1:12:40] amen
[1:12:42] I showed it and divided it
[1:12:45] when you receive the new birth as a babe
[1:12:47] in Christ you were born again at Faith
[1:12:50] you're not born again at the headstone
[1:12:55] you're born again at Faith and you grow
[1:12:57] in Grace and knowledge up the statue of
[1:12:59] a perfect man through what is the
[1:13:00] prophet teaching adoption to where the
[1:13:03] son becomes with the nature of the
[1:13:05] father
[1:13:05] and then the father can say this is my
[1:13:08] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[1:13:09] hear ye him right I believe that's what
[1:13:12] happened with brother random in 1963
[1:13:14] when the seals broke to him it brought
[1:13:16] his message that he's supposed to bring
[1:13:18] that was his adoption you can argue that
[1:13:20] point all you want to
[1:13:22] you told you bring to me and showed me
[1:13:24] where he was adopted today
[1:13:26] I know something great did happen
[1:13:29] I know it did sure and she's like these
[1:13:32] River Jordan people arguing that he
[1:13:34] didn't become God until the River Jordan
[1:13:35] run around and said
[1:13:37] there was no greater experience in the
[1:13:40] word of God
[1:13:41] than the River Jordan
[1:13:44] he said other than of this age
[1:13:47] we're living in
[1:13:50] see they'll quote you part of it it
[1:13:52] won't go at all right
[1:13:55] other than what's happening right now
[1:13:57] right right somebody
[1:13:59] has got the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:01] somebody longing after God all right
[1:14:03] come on seeking after him and praying to
[1:14:05] climb up the pyramid sure it may be slow
[1:14:07] cause it's like 40 years
[1:14:11] to get us ready right
[1:14:15] now I'm gonna I'm gonna read my last
[1:14:17] notes but I'm gonna say
[1:14:19] brother
[1:14:21] Gary wake up
[1:14:23] punching there because he asked me this
[1:14:25] question
[1:14:28] I answered this question to Brother Gary
[1:14:30] years ago he said brother Dale do you
[1:14:33] think we have the new birth like the day
[1:14:36] of Pentecost
[1:14:38] you know the Holy Ghost
[1:14:40] he asked me that question years ago
[1:14:42] I told him yes
[1:14:46] because I believe ever born again
[1:14:48] believer
[1:14:50] this got the new birth
[1:14:53] he's got the same New Birth that came on
[1:14:54] the day of Pentecost but it was a three
[1:14:57] thousand outside right
[1:14:59] right do you say does everybody have the
[1:15:02] baptism of the Holy Ghost like the 120
[1:15:04] in the upper room and I have to
[1:15:07] say no don't think so
[1:15:11] you know and I'm not worried about it
[1:15:14] I've only got one thing to say
[1:15:19] what it's preached
[1:15:21] and believed
[1:15:23] is more evidence than anything you could
[1:15:27] see are here that's right
[1:15:31] amen
[1:15:35] my sister street that would start out as
[1:15:36] Pentecostals could you say to them that
[1:15:39] we have the Holy Ghost the same as the
[1:15:41] dead being called they could probably
[1:15:42] said I don't think so
[1:15:47] and you know they were trinitarians so
[1:15:50] they would have had problems with
[1:15:51] believing that God is real all right
[1:15:55] you and I have no excuse me 40 years
[1:15:58] since the death of the Prophet over that
[1:16:00] 40-something man you see going off the
[1:16:02] scene to get into this message and get
[1:16:05] prepared and I believe somewhere around
[1:16:08] the world that same Ministry of Jesus
[1:16:10] Christ that brought around them had is
[1:16:12] in the bride
[1:16:14] not in one individual not in brother
[1:16:17] Dale or
[1:16:19] I'm starting to say the other one
[1:16:20] because I always try to rhyme in two
[1:16:22] together
[1:16:24] but it never will be in one individual
[1:16:26] again it's in the body of Christ amen
[1:16:28] the same Ministry the prophet speaking
[1:16:30] of in the body of Jesus Christ around
[1:16:33] the world is the same Ministry Jesus
[1:16:35] Christ had right
[1:16:38] don't see it
[1:16:44] don't say this and I'm sorry
[1:16:48] what you see or don't see
[1:16:56] I'm sorry
[1:16:58] if you're basing up on
[1:17:01] then I wonder what your Holy Ghost is
[1:17:03] that's right
[1:17:06] because the holy ghost in my heart is
[1:17:08] always
[1:17:09] from the time that Doctrine struck Us in
[1:17:12] 1968
[1:17:14] the holy ghost in my heart told me that
[1:17:16] wasn't right
[1:17:26] my case Holy Ghost tell you what the
[1:17:27] truth is
[1:17:30] somebody I just don't see it what are we
[1:17:33] supposed to see where has it ever been
[1:17:34] you're supposed to see it
[1:17:36] you're supposed to believe it
[1:17:39] I just don't see nobody if I've had
[1:17:41] people tell me that I just don't see
[1:17:42] nobody with the signs
[1:17:44] and all as it was in the book of Acts
[1:17:48] along with dish and I know you
[1:17:51] don't like it
[1:17:52] but you bring the book of Acts people
[1:17:54] right here today
[1:17:56] and let them live under this lady you'll
[1:17:59] see them position
[1:18:00] and let's see what they'll do that's
[1:18:03] right
[1:18:07] yeah it was old Paul said Paul was
[1:18:10] hearing me driving a Cadillac
[1:18:13] other brother got up said Paul was here
[1:18:15] he'd be in jail for night time
[1:18:17] I like that one
[1:18:20] would you bring Paul up here beat all
[1:18:23] them time and all everything and you let
[1:18:24] him Face Lady of Sia
[1:18:27] that's right
[1:18:30] and you ain't gonna like these other
[1:18:32] statements
[1:18:33] you see Paul would stand right here and
[1:18:36] he'd say what's wrong with you brother
[1:18:38] so and so why are you not sister so and
[1:18:42] so why are you not agreeing with the
[1:18:44] holy spirit amen
[1:18:47] he wouldn't play no games
[1:18:51] I stand here and see frowns and
[1:18:53] all kind of things the head shaking like
[1:18:56] well I don't agree with you
[1:18:58] I have to keep on preaching
[1:19:01] because you see the Lord hadn't told me
[1:19:03] to call it out
[1:19:07] he never does I'll call it
[1:19:10] whether I'll be Pastor the next day or
[1:19:12] what goes on I know I'm undoing that's
[1:19:14] right so I believe the baptism of the
[1:19:16] Holy Ghost is here
[1:19:20] like both experiences of the day of
[1:19:23] Pentecost
[1:19:24] I believe the new birth is proven that
[1:19:26] that's right they cheer that away all
[1:19:28] right amen now you having the new birth
[1:19:29] proves that you got it like it was on
[1:19:31] the 3000s and I believe drunk people
[1:19:34] have been tutored and trained until
[1:19:35] they're standing where the apostles were
[1:19:37] standing right
[1:19:40] you say yeah but why aren't there more
[1:19:42] signs and wonders if you answer me one
[1:19:43] question
[1:19:45] why did Jesus have to take people
[1:19:47] outside of the city
[1:19:49] we're outside the house to pray for him
[1:19:52] you want to say in the Bible let's talk
[1:19:55] in the Bible he had to take them outside
[1:19:56] right why because he said the unbelief
[1:19:59] that was there
[1:20:01] right yes
[1:20:03] I got a nephew that's still living today
[1:20:08] he's what 40 years old yeah
[1:20:11] at least 40. he had sister's fibrosis as
[1:20:16] a baby
[1:20:17] I was at the hospital
[1:20:19] they told him to take him home
[1:20:22] Nicholson I think it was in Atlanta one
[1:20:24] of those real he said take him home
[1:20:30] my brother he said
[1:20:32] should I get this machine and get this
[1:20:35] the doctor said no
[1:20:39] don't spend your money
[1:20:43] did he be back here
[1:20:46] it was too far
[1:20:51] they brought your little boy home
[1:20:55] I went over to see him and I prayed and
[1:20:57] I prayed
[1:21:00] I knew they would believe me if I tried
[1:21:02] to talk to him it'd take too long to
[1:21:03] explain it
[1:21:05] so I picked a little boy up
[1:21:08] little baby just I don't know a few
[1:21:10] weeks maybe a month or two old I forgot
[1:21:12] how old he was he was on up he lived a
[1:21:15] little while you know and you know what
[1:21:16] sister fibrosia does it lungs your lungs
[1:21:18] fill up right
[1:21:20] and you can't live back then it would
[1:21:22] only lived about 20 21 years old with
[1:21:24] the most everybody anybody ever lived
[1:21:27] I pretty much that
[1:21:29] I said Lord forgive all of the unbelief
[1:21:32] you just touch this little boy
[1:21:37] sure
[1:21:38] a couple of years ago
[1:21:42] he had a double lung transplant
[1:21:46] because his lungs were filled up
[1:21:49] but he's still alive amen he'll tell you
[1:21:52] when I come and pray for him
[1:21:58] he'll tell you when I went to the
[1:22:00] hospital to lay my hand up under there I
[1:22:03] said God you spared his life he was up
[1:22:05] to me and I forgot how old
[1:22:07] is he spared his life
[1:22:09] and I swear it again
[1:22:12] he lived to be 40 years old before he
[1:22:14] had a double lung transplant you think I
[1:22:17] wasn't happy
[1:22:18] when they done the lung crackling I
[1:22:21] prayed for make sure it didn't fail
[1:22:27] do we have any Witnesses do we need
[1:22:31] to know that God is Among Us
[1:22:37] what do we need
[1:22:39] brother Gary's a witness back there and
[1:22:41] he's laid up in the hospital with his
[1:22:42] heart out of rhythm and we prayed for
[1:22:44] him
[1:22:45] well it's out now what's that got to do
[1:22:47] with it that's right
[1:22:49] waiting on your faith
[1:22:52] come on waiting on you to wake up
[1:22:56] God done his part when he walked in says

[1:25:01] we were supposed to have but one child
[1:25:03] period She had an Rh factor in her blood
[1:25:06] and that was before they had these shots
[1:25:08] and things that could be done you know
[1:25:09] they can take care of it now
[1:25:12] and we we've had one child we're
[1:25:14] supposed to had any more weight and
[1:25:15] tariffs both had the yellow effect in
[1:25:17] their eyes and their body showing that
[1:25:19] the blood was there her she had an Rh
[1:25:21] factor her blood was negative my blood
[1:25:23] was positive
[1:25:25] I gave gallons of pins General Motors
[1:25:28] we love to get off the line you know
[1:25:31] get cookies and restaurants
[1:25:34] we get blood every six weeks or every
[1:25:36] how many weeks it come up
[1:25:38] and I had gallon pins with a positive
[1:25:42] she wound up being pregnant with Anna I
[1:25:45] come here and told a dream before then
[1:25:47] that I saw a little girl about six or
[1:25:50] seven years old with a long black hair
[1:25:52] somewhere in there and I said I saw a
[1:25:54] little boy
[1:25:55] that belonged to brother moat
[1:26:00] and there's forest and Anna here the
[1:26:03] same age basically
[1:26:05] and I saw him in a dream and come here
[1:26:08] and told about it of course people
[1:26:09] laughed because that was 70 and it was
[1:26:11] born 73.
[1:26:14] and they said you're going to miss a rat
[1:26:16] shirt because the Rapture is coming in
[1:26:17] 73. I said I don't care what you're
[1:26:19] saying I'm just telling the dream
[1:26:22] that was what has told me tell me you're
[1:26:24] gonna miss it
[1:26:26] well you know the story went to the
[1:26:28] doctor
[1:26:29] they wanted to check exactly the blood
[1:26:31] compared to her blood went in and had a
[1:26:33] new doctor and they run blood tests at
[1:26:35] the hospital naturally the nurse she's
[1:26:37] done it all the time because I they have
[1:26:38] a hard time getting my blood out I want
[1:26:40] to keep it they they dig in there and
[1:26:42] try to find it I should get it out of my
[1:26:44] ear you can get all you want to yeah
[1:26:47] and my arm will get this black where
[1:26:49] they try to find the blood flap that's
[1:26:50] what they've done that day
[1:26:52] when I went to the doctor and the doctor
[1:26:53] told me well I said well new doctor you
[1:26:55] know he said well how wonderful
[1:26:58] she said one he said
[1:27:01] well you're you're a negative with the
[1:27:03] RH but your husband is a negative
[1:27:06] she said you better check your record my
[1:27:09] husband's a positive
[1:27:12] he said according these records at the
[1:27:13] hospital we say negative
[1:27:17] I remember what we went for the doing so
[1:27:19] we went I told her I said go back and
[1:27:21] have it run again
[1:27:23] and I throw that lady next time I said
[1:27:25] make sure you get it in the right vial
[1:27:26] this time because I was still doubting I
[1:27:28] guess

[1:27:33] negative medically impossible for your
[1:27:36] blood there's two one nurse sitting
[1:27:38] right back here it ain't no way that
[1:27:41] your blood can change that way you got
[1:27:43] movements in it you know that can be
[1:27:45] done but never to change from positive
[1:27:47] to negative or negative to positive
[1:27:50] and you know what we got the little girl
[1:27:51] back there you know kind of growed up
[1:27:54] now you know Forest is up in Tennessee
[1:28:01] and you tell me there's no God

[1:28:06] crippled up in my knees and he said I'll
[1:28:08] take your kneecap off
[1:28:11] and I just looked at him and laughed
[1:28:14] so you'll have to take my kneecap off
[1:28:18] you sit in my house I said go ahead I'll
[1:28:20] take it all be sure big trades if we're

[1:28:39] it yeah
[1:28:42] thank you

[1:28:51] and he said no I stole my wife as you
[1:28:53] get me another doctor ain't going back
[1:28:54] to an unbeliever
[1:28:56] I went eight years without taking when
[1:28:59] eight years without glasses
[1:29:03] I got where I couldn't even read looking
[1:29:05] out there and it just wave up and down I
[1:29:07] had to start shooting scope on a gun
[1:29:09] because I couldn't see the orange I can
[1:29:11] shoot
[1:29:13] and you see me a lot of times I stand
[1:29:15] and read Bible print right here
[1:29:18] the spirit of God hath made me in the
[1:29:21] breath of almighty God had given me life
[1:29:26] 71 be 72 pretty quick
[1:29:30] I'm too much of a living witness all
[1:29:32] right
[1:29:33] of God's healing
[1:29:35] but for me to doubt that he's here as he
[1:29:39] was in the book of the hacks
[1:29:44] he said but I'd like to see it you've
[1:29:46] got it to open your eyes before you can
[1:29:50] see that's right you are bound by Creeds
[1:29:53] of man and Doctrine
[1:29:56] like I'm saying if you don't believe the
[1:29:58] Holy Ghost as far you you will never
[1:29:59] seek that Holy Ghost
[1:30:02] but if you at least believe it's far you
[1:30:05] let me at least declare it for you all
[1:30:07] right amen whether I've got it or not as
[1:30:10] far as you
[1:30:12] that's right
[1:30:14] the same one bit
[1:30:15] Paul used the same one Peter and all of
[1:30:18] them
[1:30:19] how many gods did Paul and Peter and him
[1:30:21] have
[1:30:23] right right that's right amen amen how
[1:30:27] many gods do we preach right
[1:30:31] I mean it's been about 40 years most of
[1:30:33] you heard the teaching of the godhead
[1:30:35] for about 40 years
[1:30:36] amen amen
[1:30:38] well we ought to be somewhere pretty
[1:30:40] close you know
[1:30:45] but you see I'm not convinced him trying
[1:30:47] to convince you who I am I'm trying to
[1:30:49] convince you God is real amen
[1:30:52] he's for you it won't save you to see
[1:30:55] him in me
[1:30:57] it won't save you to see him in brother
[1:30:59] Brown he won't save you to see him in
[1:31:01] the Lord Jesus
[1:31:02] it'll only be when you see him in your
[1:31:05] own life right
[1:31:08] and receive him as a personal savior to
[1:31:10] you all right amen and then the Bible
[1:31:13] will be right and no man can call Jesus
[1:31:14] the Christ accepting me by a personal
[1:31:17] experience of the baptism of the Holy
[1:31:19] Ghost
[1:31:20] that's right
[1:31:22] that was a promise amen
[1:31:24] come on brother
[1:31:27] I hope you understand what I'm saying
[1:31:30] yes
[1:31:33] I believe
[1:31:34] that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:31:36] here yes amen amen
[1:31:41] let me quote my wife
[1:31:44] because this is a point she made years
[1:31:46] ago
[1:31:48] it was the word that was eat down
[1:31:52] in the church ages you agree all right
[1:31:55] the words eat night amen wouldn't the
[1:31:57] Holy Spirit each day right you show me
[1:31:59] where it was I challenge you on the
[1:32:01] basis of the Bible and brother Ron's
[1:32:02] message you come and show me where the
[1:32:04] Holy Ghost was in today no the word was
[1:32:07] these things that's right and the Holy
[1:32:09] Ghost can only work according to the
[1:32:12] amount of words you have that's right
[1:32:14] amen so when Luther came out that's all
[1:32:16] the Holy Ghost could work with was that
[1:32:18] just shall live by faith amen but now we
[1:32:22] stand in an hour when all the things the
[1:32:24] sealed's broke the prophet's message is
[1:32:26] brought them to us
[1:32:28] all right and the Holy Ghost is here
[1:32:35] let me quote brother Brown
[1:32:38] go see that went with another Doctrine
[1:32:40] and we'll get back to
[1:32:42] see the other Doctrine was when they
[1:32:44] come in the message I'll get to this one
[1:32:46] but you couldn't be saved after 63
[1:32:49] because Redemption was over
[1:32:52] how many of you heard that one
[1:32:55] couldn't be saved after 63 because
[1:32:58] Redemption was over
[1:33:00] you know what I told him then I said
[1:33:02] well according to my Bible the prophet I
[1:33:04] believe Redemption was over for the
[1:33:05] foundation of the world
[1:33:08] I'm so sorry I just can't believe you
[1:33:11] and I said maybe the reason is I don't
[1:33:13] have it
[1:33:16] and see for two years I saw God for the
[1:33:19] baptism
[1:33:21] but then the day I received it I said
[1:33:23] now come tell me there ain't no one Holy
[1:33:25] Ghost now tell me you think we say you
[1:33:27] got your 63. that's right
[1:33:28] that's right until you go jump in the
[1:33:29] dry lake that's right
[1:33:32] because I'm a personal witness that's
[1:33:34] right I'm a witness of these things I
[1:33:38] stood right here not bragging on myself
[1:33:40] but telling you the witness of the Holy
[1:33:41] Ghost About Eyes Open about I mean about
[1:33:44] well now we're praying for sister her
[1:33:46] eyes to come and they're coming back and
[1:33:48] we believe it that's the only thing I
[1:33:50] used to say the only thing I've never
[1:33:52] seen was the dead race and eyes open
[1:33:53] well I've seen the dead raise now worth
[1:33:56] working God's going to bring our eyes to
[1:33:58] the place because he's working on it and
[1:34:00] I believe it
[1:34:02] but you see I'm bragging on Jesus
[1:34:05] not trying to convince you brother
[1:34:07] Dale's got anything
[1:34:10] but one thing and that's the new birth
[1:34:13] and if your personal experience in that
[1:34:16] new bird right that's right man
[1:34:18] let me contend for that go ahead brother
[1:34:23] yes
[1:34:29] I just wanted to testify get this home
[1:34:31] God I'll cut mine off
[1:34:35] I apologize but I'm not apologizing
[1:34:38] because
[1:34:39] Lord's really helped me um
[1:34:41] I've had a neurological condition that
[1:34:44] affected my feet uh for years and uh
[1:34:48] basically there's a sheath that wraps
[1:34:50] around all the nerves in your body and
[1:34:52] then when that sheath begins to
[1:34:54] deteriorate the nerves go Bonkers and
[1:34:57] I've set up nights
[1:34:59] crying with in pain
[1:35:02] three weeks ago it's been going on since
[1:35:05] 0-405 three weeks ago I stood there
[1:35:08] brother Dale brother Wade Brother Dean
[1:35:10] and brother Al come up and prayed for me
[1:35:13] and since then my feet have been better
[1:35:16] than they've been in years I mean I'm
[1:35:19] talking about master safety
[1:35:22] and this is the good part it started the
[1:35:25] journey to 20 year old and made Eternal
[1:35:27] that's what that's where these feed us
[1:35:29] where it all ends up the same guy that
[1:35:31] did that takes his heart
[1:35:34] thank God
[1:35:43] he was one year
[1:35:46] seeking for the baptism and all together
[1:35:48] okay he was one year seeking for the
[1:35:51] baptism I'm coming back home okay
[1:35:54] seeking for the baptism when the Holy
[1:35:56] Ghost
[1:35:58] and here's oh me
[1:36:00] never say it brother Gary you believe
[1:36:03] the prophet so that's a good evidence
[1:36:05] never said that
[1:36:12] matter of fact I guess he thought I was
[1:36:14] totally contrary to him
[1:36:16] because he told me something one day
[1:36:17] that he thought was right and I told him
[1:36:19] I said no you're wrong
[1:36:22] he needed just a little lineup to get it
[1:36:25] right
[1:36:27] see because I'm not going to argue with
[1:36:29] you about anything you asked me
[1:36:31] something I don't agree with it I'll
[1:36:32] tell you
[1:36:34] and then I'll tell you why
[1:36:36] I told him I said quit trying to seek
[1:36:38] God
[1:36:39] you know I didn't mean quit seeking the
[1:36:41] Holy Ghost now you know what I'm saying
[1:36:42] God always teach you to seek all ago but
[1:36:44] I said you're trying to figure it out
[1:36:45] you're doing exactly what I've done yeah
[1:36:48] when brother Mook stood and told me he
[1:36:49] said brother Dale what are you doing I
[1:36:51] said don't ask me I don't know
[1:36:53] I said I ain't want no tongues and this
[1:36:56] that and the others and evidence
[1:36:59] I want a new birth
[1:37:01] right right amen and then I received it
[1:37:04] Brother Gary he used to call me coming
[1:37:05] out I-20 we called it the Battle of I-20
[1:37:07] he come out I-20 there holding those
[1:37:10] films up and down the road you know some
[1:37:12] Kodiak and all he and he called me one
[1:37:14] day and he said it's over with
[1:37:17] itself now I said okay
[1:37:21] well because he had an experience right
[1:37:23] amen
[1:37:25] he'll take care of us that's right he
[1:37:27] started that 20 year old body there
[1:37:29] that's right amen when you get the new
[1:37:31] birth he starts working on that body
[1:37:34] and once in a while he give you a little
[1:37:36] witness to it right you know
[1:37:38] together
[1:38:32] at you don't have to have nobody
[1:38:42] to do I just
[1:38:53] foreign
[1:39:00] how many of you have heard me say this
[1:39:03] I'm trying to tell you something
[1:39:06] I tried to explain the gifts and things
[1:39:08] to you
[1:39:09] but I'll just ask you to do something if
[1:39:12] you'll do it
[1:39:13] and you believe it it'll work
[1:39:16] the next time you're sitting listening
[1:39:17] and God quickened something to you as
[1:39:19] being right
[1:39:21] you know really you know hey that's
[1:39:23] right
[1:39:24] raise your hand right then and say
[1:39:27] my family my children my wife my husband
[1:39:32] yeah my father my mother
[1:39:36] raise it see if it don't happen
[1:39:39] I'm trying to tell you about a gift
[1:39:43] remember I said a minister just has a
[1:39:45] gift to break the spell that Satan has
[1:39:46] over your eyes whether God can speak
[1:39:48] straight to you
[1:39:51] but when you see something that's being
[1:39:53] revealed to you and you say Lord I
[1:39:55] believe that just put it on that and say
[1:39:58] give him a family right and claim them
[1:40:02] we have a list downstairs
[1:40:05] long list of people with names on that
[1:40:08] privilege
[1:40:09] you pray every day for those nights you
[1:40:12] don't have to call every name you know
[1:40:14] God's got a good memory he knows
[1:40:16] everyone is put on there you say Lord
[1:40:18] that list that Wade has right
[1:40:21] for all of the people that's right amen
[1:40:24] over a hundred he said what in the world
[1:40:26] we're going to do daddy if he says I'll
[1:40:28] let him bring him here
[1:40:29] we're building out some way he will
[1:40:32] we'll make out we got a basement we can
[1:40:35] put up a camera in you know something
[1:40:37] watch it from there we'll do whatever
[1:40:39] I'm not worried about that because I was
[1:40:42] going to quote it while ago when I
[1:40:44] missed it in my mind brother Ryan said
[1:40:46] he didn't know how many to be saved in
[1:40:47] that last moment this is a quote if you
[1:40:50] want it you don't want me to be saved in
[1:40:52] that moment last moment two Rapture the
[1:40:55] church that's right amen you say well
[1:40:58] how can they do it because they're
[1:41:00] dependent on you yes
[1:41:05] yes right
[1:41:06] he'll put them to the place they're
[1:41:08] supposed to be he took them on the death
[1:41:10] Pentecost and put them into a higher
[1:41:12] level right that's right then he did the
[1:41:15] three thousand outside that's right he
[1:41:18] can do it again yeah that's right we are
[1:41:22] gathering together
[1:41:28] foreign
[1:42:37] I could come in and said I'm gonna check
[1:42:39] you one more time
[1:42:41] and we'll go
[1:42:50] he should always hide
[1:42:59] let's go
[1:43:00] we can't prove you got it
[1:43:03] it's our question God
[1:43:06] I walked into the doctor's office one
[1:43:08] day and when I had that problem with my
[1:43:10] eyes and it would wave out you under
[1:43:11] that I couldn't sleep good really
[1:43:13] concerned wearing glasses and things
[1:43:25] I said what are we getting
