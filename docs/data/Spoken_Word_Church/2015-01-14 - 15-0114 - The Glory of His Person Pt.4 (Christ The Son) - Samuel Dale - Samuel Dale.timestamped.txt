[3:42] would just have your way with all of us
[3:44] tonight we love you we thank you in
[3:47] Jesus name
[3:50] amen all right Revelations
[3:53] 1 we'll begin about verse 10 I was in
[3:56] the spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[3:58] behind me great voice as of a trumpet
[4:00] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[4:02] and the last and what thou see us write
[4:05] in a book and send it unto the seven
[4:07] churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus
[4:11] and and un Samia and un pergamus and
[4:14] Tara and unto Sardis and unto
[4:17] Philadelphia and unto lady OA and I
[4:20] turned to see the voice that spake with
[4:22] me and being turned I saw seven golden
[4:25] candlesticks and in the midst of the
[4:27] seven candlesticks one liken to the son
[4:30] of man clothed with a garment down to
[4:32] the foot and G about the paps with a
[4:35] golden girdle all right trying to get
[4:38] some thoughts in mind to be able to
[4:42] follow on there end that scripture of
[4:45] going on and understanding you know and
[4:48] trying to look at it throughout the word
[4:50] and see the lineup okay go to Matthew
[4:54] 16 when Jesus came into the coast of
[4:57] cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples
[4:59] saying who do Man say that I the son of
[5:02] man am and they said some say thou art
[5:05] John the Baptist some Elias and other
[5:07] jeremias or one of the prophets he saith
[5:10] unto them but whom say ye that I am and
[5:14] Peter answered and said Thou Art the
[5:18] Christ the son of the Living God you may
[5:22] be seated the Lord at his Blessing to
[5:24] the reading of the
[5:26] word now as I've said trying to get an
[5:31] understanding in the the U Book of
[5:35] Revelations then we will pick up the
[5:37] Sevenfold glory and be able to go on
[5:40] from that part but the main thing that
[5:43] I'm trying to get you and I both to see
[5:46] is that God reveals himself in many many
[5:52] forms uh you know he would appear here
[5:55] he would appear there he would show
[5:57] himself here show himself there
[6:00] and all but it's the same God all right
[6:04] then you can take the seven compound
[6:06] names of Jehovah you can follow that all
[6:09] the way through and see as the prophet
[6:11] said that all of those pertain to Jesus
[6:15] Christ all right then looking at one
[6:18] true and living God and seeing that uh
[6:21] you know and then when he ask here who
[6:23] do Man say I the son of man am he said
[6:26] Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[6:29] Living God all right
[6:31] now as we've emphasized many times
[6:34] before he asked him who was a son of man
[6:39] well Peter evidently didn't catch that
[6:42] or he would have tried maybe to have
[6:44] answered accordingly but he answered
[6:48] according to what you read the rest of
[6:50] the verse it says that the father hath
[6:53] revealed these things unto thee and upon
[6:57] this I'll build my church all all right
[7:00] then the church is built on the
[7:02] revelation of the Christ the son of the
[7:07] Living God Amen right all right now you
[7:10] may not think of it as I do on what that
[7:13] means but remember the prophet said if
[7:16] you don't see Christ in every verse go
[7:19] back and read it again all right so then
[7:21] you go through and you follow Christ
[7:24] throughout the Bible so you can't follow
[7:26] Jesus Through the Bible right you can't
[7:29] see him physically for Etc in every
[7:34] verse but you can see the Christ amen
[7:36] all right and seeing that Christ then me
[7:39] to me then the greatest thing that it is
[7:42] the church has built upon the revelation
[7:45] of who Jesus Christ is all right he
[7:47] comes to John on patmas and the very
[7:50] first thing is what the Revelation that
[7:53] God give to Jesus to give to John to
[7:55] show the church what of who he is amen
[7:58] and then to show his
[8:01] future uh the you know the taking place
[8:05] and seeing the future and it would come
[8:07] out see to understand then the son of
[8:09] man right amen because none of your
[8:11] writers wrote of the son of man Paul and
[8:14] the greatest of all he was he never
[8:17] spoke of the son of man uh Peter and
[8:19] them yeah because they wrote you know
[8:22] because Matthew Mark Luke and John you
[8:25] say they wrote about the son of man
[8:26] right but never they never made any more
[8:31] uh what is the word for it commentaries
[8:33] or or uh anything later in relation to
[8:38] it and looked like Paul would have
[8:40] picked that up but yet he was concerned
[8:43] with the building of the church he was
[8:45] not concerned with a Rapture he says
[8:49] himself you know uh get it out of your
[8:51] mind that God is coming now that's what
[8:53] we used to think we we used to think
[8:55] that Paul was trying to get people to
[8:57] see you know that the Lord was coming
[8:59] the next day and brother Brown said he
[9:01] was trying to get it out of their
[9:04] mind because it have to be a falling
[9:07] away first it have to be these things
[9:09] and Paul knew that so there was no need
[9:12] of Paul dealing with the end time
[9:16] Revelation other than the prophecies
[9:19] that he made the the statements of
[9:21] change in a moment twink of an i etc
[9:24] those things he would make those but he
[9:27] would not deal with how that would come
[9:29] to pass amen all right and God knowing
[9:34] that he was going to send us a prophet
[9:35] to bring those things into being all
[9:39] right now then we we don't have to worry
[9:42] about what the symbols are and now this
[9:47] is going to be valuable later to talk
[9:49] about the the Sevenfold Glory so this is
[9:53] what I'm trying to get you to see that
[9:56] even though you see uh someone standing
[10:02] there uh it can still be in symbolics
[10:06] right because you know as we tried to
[10:09] emphasize last Wednesday night that uh
[10:13] you know that was not the body of the
[10:16] Lord Jesus Christ the human element the
[10:18] fleshly speaking standing in Revelations
[10:22] 1 but it was the body in being the body
[10:26] of Christ you know the Church all right
[10:31] now in being the body of Christ which is
[10:34] your church see you're still dealing
[10:36] with
[10:37] symbolics you're still be dealing with
[10:40] symbols of things or or something in
[10:42] relation you're not seeing it in total
[10:46] Purity uh orever how you would say the
[10:49] word for it uh because to me if you saw
[10:52] it like you needed to see it you would
[10:54] see
[10:55] Jesus
[10:57] now uh if if you don't like this
[11:00] statement then just cast it away but to
[11:02] me anything that will not bring Jesus
[11:05] Christ to the
[11:07] glorification that he's supposed to be
[11:09] brought I don't care if it's bragging
[11:12] about the people I don't care if it's
[11:15] talking about the people but if it does
[11:19] not bring Christ into the open and and
[11:24] showing him and showing who he is cuz
[11:27] who is the church come on right amen the
[11:30] church is Christ made
[11:32] manifest well then that's all I've ever
[11:34] tried to bring is to try to get us to
[11:37] see you know that Christ and that's what
[11:41] we're going to talk about tonight uh is
[11:43] Christ the son amen and we'll get back
[11:46] into the reason of using that in a
[11:49] minute as we go through but now we ended
[11:53] up and I went back and listened to the
[11:56] message because I I like to do that that
[11:59] and I know that I'm I'm I listen to that
[12:02] and I thought man have I got
[12:05] slow I recking 74 makes you
[12:09] slow but I'd rather be slow than
[12:12] fast and I'd rather repeat
[12:15] myself if that is you know part of old
[12:19] age
[12:20] signs and Paul had it and I don't know
[12:23] how old he was because for me he said
[12:25] for me to say the same thing is needful
[12:28] for you
[12:29] all right then but I was very very slow
[12:33] but very very I noticed it trying to
[12:36] make it and I do I'm trying to make it
[12:39] very uh to the
[12:41] point to where that you know what I'm
[12:46] saying all right now whether you believe
[12:49] it or not that's between you and God and
[12:52] I I can't reveal it anyway but I want to
[12:55] make it to where that it's clear enough
[12:58] to to where that you can say well this
[13:01] is what he believes all right now
[13:04] because that's always been my goal but
[13:06] forgive me for being that way and and
[13:09] you know and just being myself all right
[13:12] but we were talking about Sunday I mean
[13:15] Wednesday of how that we got to the
[13:19] point that we were talking about that no
[13:22] man has seen God
[13:25] right all right and see then by by doing
[13:29] that and and we've read it from 1 John
[13:33] 4:12 that no man has seen God at any
[13:36] time then we went to 1 Timothy
[13:39] 6:16 that whom no man can approach unto
[13:43] whom no man has seen nor can see now
[13:46] that's two two uh scriptures we used uh
[13:51] Moses remember when he said I like to
[13:53] see it he said you can't see my face you
[13:56] say well he later he seen the face well
[13:59] I I remember and I did in that I
[14:02] emphasized that you're not just talking
[14:05] about that kind of a
[14:07] look uh to me Moses wanted to see his
[14:11] see
[14:12] him and he says it's not time it's not
[14:15] the right place but said you'll never
[14:18] see me the way you want to see
[14:21] me that that's hard to try to emphasize
[14:25] to people but how else can you say it
[14:29] and stay with the scriptures that no man
[14:30] has seen God at any time all right you
[14:33] can say well he saw the back part there
[14:35] and he saw the front part later you're
[14:37] getting into what you think is good
[14:40] Revelations and the people get all
[14:42] tantalized with those things and say
[14:44] this look at what this is look at what
[14:46] that is but it doesn't uh answer any
[14:51] questions right to talize you with a
[14:55] piece of ice running up down your back
[14:57] won't answer questions
[14:59] right I I like for questions to be
[15:02] answered that way then I like what the
[15:06] prophet said when he says questions
[15:09] makes a strong church that's
[15:12] right you said well we can go here to
[15:14] this Baptist Church and boy they got
[15:17] 10,000 questions about all of the
[15:20] scriptures now that's not exactly what
[15:22] he's meaning to me all right you may
[15:26] think that I think he's meaning
[15:29] questions that are
[15:35] answered you're listening questions that
[15:38] are answered makes a strong Church sir
[15:43] it don't because we can go into the
[15:45] Bible and see where that questions
[15:47] gender
[15:48] stri so don't just think that it's
[15:51] questions no it's questions who that
[15:54] have been
[15:55] answered I had a lot of questions before
[15:59] I heard of this Prophet didn't you I
[16:02] still have a lot of questions after I
[16:04] heard about him and heard the message
[16:07] all right but they are gradually going
[16:09] away to give us understanding all right
[16:13] but we got down in to John 1 and18 where
[16:17] it says no man has seen God at any time
[16:19] but the only begotten
[16:23] son now I emphasize that in the
[16:27] message which is in the bosom of the
[16:29] father he had the clarity him all right
[16:34] so now we're dealing with the son and
[16:38] see when you're talking about
[16:41] um trying to understand to a trinitarian
[16:45] a son happened uh 2,000 years
[16:50] ago right that's the relation of a son
[16:53] that they talk about but we don't talk
[16:56] like that brother brandham took it all
[16:58] the way back as we will in a little bit
[17:00] he took it all the way back before the
[17:02] foundation of the world and speaks of
[17:05] the Son of
[17:07] God and he says now we don't believe in
[17:11] Eternal
[17:13] sunship so then there's something wrong
[17:16] with our understanding that we need to
[17:20] uh maybe think about a lot all right but
[17:24] are you with me now see Jesus said God
[17:28] is a Spirit John 4:24 or 5:24 or what it
[17:32] is there all
[17:34] right but yet he yet the scriptures
[17:37] would say nobody can see God well AR
[17:40] there's something about this part of
[17:43] saying that God is a
[17:46] spirit all right and we'll we'll get
[17:49] down into that in a minute so just hold
[17:51] your point of of that and I want to
[17:54] rephrase uh what I brought out Wednesday
[17:57] because I thought that was a good way
[18:00] for the prophet to give the
[18:03] definition and you know and we could
[18:05] have the understanding so if you will
[18:07] Brothers pull up number one and you know
[18:10] for me to repeat then I'm getting old so
[18:13] just mark it off he just old foty
[18:16] dudy uh but think about what he's saying
[18:19] and I ask you to listen to uh the
[18:22] message questions and answers on Genesis
[18:24] and I won't ask for a raise of hands it
[18:26] might embarrass you um but I hope you
[18:30] did uh you know and besides reading
[18:34] constantly of it and almost t almost
[18:37] printing out uh half the book I we still
[18:41] sat down and we listen to the message
[18:44] you know to try to hear the things
[18:46] because I wanted you to hear it and I
[18:48] wanted to hear it too all right but now
[18:51] look what he said now no man has seen
[18:53] the father at any time no man can see
[18:56] God in the bodily
[19:00] form
[19:01] now now you're going to have to Define
[19:04] things as you come down are you going to
[19:07] be in very uh limbo State all right no
[19:11] man can see God in the bodily form
[19:13] because God is not in body form God is a
[19:18] spirit all right no man has seen the
[19:21] father but the only begotten of the
[19:22] father have declared him all right in
[19:25] John now what do you think about when
[19:29] you see that or read the scripture or
[19:32] think about it that God is a
[19:35] spirit what what are your
[19:40] thoughts uh the prophet took it back
[19:43] before the foundational the world before
[19:46] there was any atoms molecules etc etc
[19:49] etc but he said that God existed now he
[19:53] explained that the word god is an object
[19:56] of worship all right so then uh you know
[20:01] he didn't wasn't God until he created
[20:04] angels and they worshiped and that made
[20:05] him God but that didn't make him God
[20:08] like making him God that made him
[20:11] manifest as God because he would have
[20:14] been God to begin with or else you've
[20:17] missed it you'd say no God is an object
[20:19] of worship well then before he ever made
[20:22] anything that was one of his attributes
[20:26] right okay
[20:28] remember that in the prophet's
[20:30] message that's one of his
[20:33] attributes is to be God was to be father
[20:37] was to be son was to be human was to be
[20:40] this that that was already in him so
[20:43] then he already had those attributes he
[20:46] was just not displaying Angels worshiped
[20:48] him that was a
[20:50] display and that brought him into being
[20:52] all right but now
[20:55] watch now we take the part of God being
[21:00] a
[21:01] spirit and it's very easily to be like
[21:05] that there's no
[21:09] form there's no uh you know nothing it's
[21:13] just
[21:15] Spirit right well now I hope tonight we
[21:19] can deal with that a little bit by way
[21:21] of the Prophet to to take a lot of that
[21:24] that out of your mind as to thinking
[21:26] about just a
[21:30] right I will read in a minute where the
[21:32] Prophet said
[21:34] it he said if he's just like the wind
[21:37] then you do not have to pray for the
[21:40] baptism of the Holy
[21:42] Ghost it would be in you that's the
[21:46] amoia out in right so you see where I'm
[21:52] going but see we we we get our mind
[21:55] locked in and our thoughts are on God is
[21:58] a
[21:59] spirit but watch what he goes on to say
[22:02] now notice there's nothing there just
[22:04] space there's no light there's no dark
[22:06] there's nothing it's just seems nothing
[22:09] but in there is a great supernatural
[22:16] being okay Jehovah
[22:19] God who covered all
[22:22] space in all places at all times he was
[22:26] from Everlasting to ever lasting he's
[22:28] the beginning of the
[22:32] creation Now watch when we get over into
[22:35] it far enough that brother R says God
[22:37] was his first
[22:41] creation see he then needs the beginning
[22:43] of the creation of God all right that's
[22:46] God can't see nothing can't hear
[22:48] nothing not a move of an Adam in the a
[22:52] not nothing no hour no
[22:55] nothing but yet God was there that was
[22:58] God now let's watch for a few minutes
[23:00] and no man has seen God that's the
[23:02] father see all right now are you
[23:06] listening we want to make him as a
[23:08] spirit as to be uh no form no
[23:14] doings but yet he says here that he's a
[23:17] being right
[23:21] amen now I I've always been and I'm
[23:24] sorry to be blunt but at least you
[23:28] understand me you mean we are
[23:32] beings you mean we have a form you mean
[23:35] we are
[23:37] tangibles uh could be felt you know Etc
[23:40] but yet God is just a
[23:45] spirit that that would make us more real
[23:49] than he
[23:50] is
[23:52] right I don't go that way I'm sorry
[23:55] because I believe that
[23:59] if I'm going to believe in God as a
[24:02] Creator to bring into being I'm going to
[24:05] believe that he's
[24:07] real now if I ask you a question without
[24:11] laying down the case I have before you
[24:14] and I would ask you the question and I
[24:17] would say brother collie do you believe
[24:19] the devil's
[24:21] real and you'd say
[24:25] yes and as I said if I hadn't laid your
[24:28] mind something that you know that I'm
[24:30] pulling you into a point of
[24:35] thinking you would really say the devil
[24:37] is
[24:38] real maybe not in the real points of
[24:43] this you know
[24:45] materialistic uh you know the the 16
[24:48] elements or the metals or
[24:51] anything but I I get Plum tickled at
[24:54] people's thinking that there is no God
[24:59] and we think
[25:00] about well who created all of
[25:04] this you know and I know I'm just plain
[25:07] carnal but that's the way I think if the
[25:10] devil is
[25:13] God he's
[25:18] real because he created where we
[25:23] are so that would make him greater than
[25:27] what we are even the Devil
[25:34] Himself I know I know my mind's all
[25:36] slipped and gone and it's all right
[25:39] nursing home's waiting on me teren is
[25:40] getting plans send me and all of that
[25:43] that's
[25:44] hard I'm got to get away from that
[25:49] a just a fun
[25:53] point to drive a a nail down
[25:58] even if I believed in in Buddha Hindu
[26:02] Muslim uh
[26:04] allas um any of the other names for your
[26:07] gods that people claim to be uh I would
[26:12] still believe they were real or why
[26:14] would I believe in
[26:18] them I believe there has to be some form
[26:20] of Supernatural being that brought us
[26:22] into existence don't you all right then
[26:25] if that supernatural being brought us
[26:27] into existence then he's greater than we
[26:30] are because he brought us we didn't
[26:33] bring him right
[26:36] right he brought into the into existence
[26:39] the things that we speak of that are
[26:42] tangibles you
[26:44] know
[26:46] solids all right so then you know I just
[26:50] laugh at people when they say there is
[26:52] no God or something like that cuz I I
[26:56] say Well they're caught in that trap
[26:58] but now
[27:02] listen God
[27:06] is not like the
[27:09] wind that was where we ended up uh kind
[27:14] of you know
[27:16] being but let me get these two in the
[27:19] middle here to where that we before we
[27:21] get to that point go ahead with number
[27:23] two cuz I like this and I like these two
[27:26] places cu in case anybody won't say well
[27:29] I believe in everything after the seals
[27:31] well we give you one after the seal one
[27:32] for the seal so you know we we just do
[27:36] that but look what he says on questions
[27:39] and answers on
[27:40] Hebrews uh theal 2 57
[27:46] 102 another body and I don't want to
[27:49] dwell on this very much I'm trying to
[27:51] get down okay the body God is the spirit
[27:55] how many understand that say Amen God is
[27:57] a spirit Jesus is a man and Jesus was
[28:01] God made flesh Jesus was we could never
[28:05] see God see he's a
[28:08] spirit you can't see Spirit no man has
[28:12] seen God at any time no man couldn't see
[28:18] God all right are you reading what he's
[28:21] saying then let me say this you've never
[28:24] seen me right you never seen me in all
[28:29] your life and you never will see
[28:33] me you know what he's explaining God
[28:36] talking about
[28:40] himself you'll never see me that's right
[28:43] you see this body that declares this
[28:45] person that's in here now this body
[28:48] doesn't have eternal life but the spirit
[28:51] has eternal life this body will go
[28:54] back but it'll come forth again and his
[28:58] likeness like a grain of wheat all right
[29:01] look at the next one which is Shalom
[29:04] 64 when he says but really frankly we
[29:07] have never seen each other right did you
[29:11] know that we have never seen one
[29:17] another you hear something speaking out
[29:19] of a
[29:21] body here that
[29:23] impersonates whatever is on the inside I
[29:26] love that
[29:29] you know the reason I love that I'm sure
[29:32] I had read those things and it was
[29:34] dwelling in on my mind but you know
[29:37] what 90% of the people are preachers and
[29:42] forgive me for numbers most preachers
[29:45] preach to
[29:47] bodies right
[29:51] sure hair dress clothes
[29:56] shoes
[29:58] you
[29:59] know
[30:01] right but you know the Lord showed me
[30:04] something back many many years ago I've
[30:06] made this statement when I say it most
[30:08] of you will remember it real well I said
[30:11] I'm not speaking to your body I'm
[30:14] talking to the one inside of
[30:19] there brother random was not trying to
[30:23] uh contact bodily forms of people you
[30:25] automatically do that that's a human
[30:28] element but he was trying to get down on
[30:31] the inside of that inside to where that
[30:35] inside could make up its
[30:38] mind what it wants to
[30:42] be and I thought when I read these I
[30:44] thought I really love those that's
[30:46] because that's the way I've always been
[30:48] I I what good does it do to be the
[30:52] body you know that's what people say oh
[30:55] we went to church and the preacher he
[30:57] just preached a whole sermon on me and I
[31:00] just feel so
[31:03] good well why didn't you repent and get
[31:07] straightened up where the preacher could
[31:09] have preached
[31:15] something
[31:17] oh
[31:20] yeah he just beat my toes to Pieces well
[31:25] clean up your toes
[31:28] right you want to go back the next
[31:30] service and let him beat on you again
[31:33] and you go home feeling good you repent
[31:36] you cry you ask the Lord to forgive you
[31:39] and you go home feeling Lord I just feel
[31:41] so good he just he just told me like it
[31:45] was
[31:48] tonight well you don't need to be told
[31:51] like it was
[31:52] again I mean one time's good enough may
[31:56] I quote the prophet
[32:01] he said what is it about a woman you
[32:03] can't get her put on a pair of
[32:05] pants and she's got the Holy
[32:10] Ghost and he said you don't have to tell
[32:12] the bride but one
[32:17] time am I quoting it maybe paraphrasing
[32:20] it a little but am I
[32:23] right that what he
[32:26] said but you see church
[32:29] then maybe we'll to get down to thinking
[32:31] about what sometimes people are doing
[32:34] when we get so upset at
[32:37] him he's talking about me well you know
[32:41] what honey if you ain't guilty I can't
[32:45] talk about
[32:49] you but if you are
[32:54] guilty is it me that's doing the talking
[32:58] or is there something inside of here
[33:00] trying to talk to the something that's
[33:02] inside of you re like this okay I'll get
[33:05] off of it in a minute you hear something
[33:07] speaking out of a body here that
[33:08] impersonates whatever is on the inside
[33:10] see then when we talk to each other
[33:12] we're really not talking to the body
[33:13] it's the spirit inside but the body is
[33:15] the thing that identifies the spirit
[33:17] that's on the inside and therefore when
[33:20] we speak to each other we are quickly
[33:23] can understand right away whether we're
[33:25] Christians or not caus ours a fellowship
[33:28] in the spirit that we talk
[33:31] from is that
[33:35] true do you love to talk to people that
[33:38] are not in the word more than you do
[33:41] people that are in the word then you're
[33:44] out of the
[33:46] word I'll continue quickly you
[33:49] understand right away whether you're a
[33:50] Christian or not because there's a
[33:51] fellowship in the spirit that talk from
[33:54] you see that it vibrates to one another
[33:57] that whether we are Christians or not
[33:59] therefore we have never seen each other
[34:02] Jesus no man has seen God at any time
[34:05] but the only begotten of the father has
[34:07] declared him in other words God was
[34:09] identified that's right the person of
[34:12] God was identified in the
[34:15] body the Lord Jesus Christ so he was the
[34:19] expressed image of God Amen or God
[34:23] expressing himself through an image
[34:27] right all right see through an image
[34:30] man God expressed himself to us and he
[34:33] was God not a third person or second
[34:35] person but he was the
[34:38] person he was God himself identifying
[34:41] himself so that we could see him all he
[34:43] goes straight to 1 Timothy 3:16 without
[34:45] controversy that's argument great is the
[34:48] mystery of of godliness for God was
[34:51] manifested are made known in the flesh
[34:53] see the son declares him brings him out
[34:55] into the open isn't that wonderful God
[34:59] we could uh never understand God as he
[35:02] moved through a pillar of fire and so
[35:03] forth as he did but we understood him
[35:07] when he became one of us see when he
[35:09] became one of us we could touch him we
[35:11] could handle him we could do you know
[35:13] the Bible says you've handled
[35:16] God all right but not you didn't handle
[35:20] God because God is a spirit but what did
[35:22] you
[35:24] handle you handled the
[35:28] form that
[35:30] he changed himself into to live in that
[35:33] form now we'll get more on that next
[35:35] Wednesday of of some things on God but I
[35:38] just wanted to get those
[35:42] things see you've never seen God at any
[35:47] time why because
[35:52] he's Spirit
[35:54] God but does that mean he's not a person
[36:03] just when you say he's a spirit does
[36:05] that mean he's not a
[36:09] person the prophet who just read that he
[36:11] said he's not the first second one he's
[36:14] not the first person he's the
[36:17] person I love that statement the person
[36:21] all right
[36:23] now what about God how real is your
[36:27] God I'm not talking about
[36:30] condescending we we are not down we will
[36:33] get to that the Lord willing further on
[36:37] about the God the baby the man the the
[36:40] things
[36:42] and but we're back before the foundation
[36:44] of the world by way of the Prophet
[36:46] message talking about this great
[36:51] Eternal one who covered all space Time
[36:54] and
[36:55] Eternity and how that he is
[37:00] real
[37:04] amen is your god real that's a simple
[37:09] question see I ask most people if you
[37:11] ask and I'm not to no stones but you ask
[37:14] people that are not trained in the
[37:16] message part of what we've heard you go
[37:18] over here and you ask them you said well
[37:20] the Bible says God is a spirit said what
[37:22] do you think about that well he's just a
[37:25] spirit
[37:29] it was just back there when there was
[37:30] wasn't nothing and he was nothing but
[37:33] just the
[37:34] spirit you
[37:37] know
[37:41] well that would make us greater than
[37:46] him and we we can't do
[37:49] it all right look what your Prophet had
[37:53] to say go to Number Four
[37:55] Brothers which is questions and answers
[37:58] on
[37:59] Genesis and you heard him make this
[38:03] statement and then he asked the question
[38:05] now let us who Father and
[38:09] Son now brother Brandon wasn't a
[38:11] trinitarian
[38:13] right but he had no problem saying
[38:15] father and
[38:19] son could say let
[38:25] us
[38:27] right now theologians got trouble
[38:31] there or theological mind had because
[38:34] there's two people involved father
[38:41] son but see we know that the son is the
[38:45] father made manifest in another form so
[38:49] we don't have
[38:50] problems well what about this
[38:52] communicating well I remember one day
[38:55] when a man was standing on on the River
[38:58] Jordan and here came a dove down and
[39:01] here came a voice and that looks like
[39:04] three
[39:08] people but we can't go that
[39:10] way and remain in the truth of one true
[39:13] and living
[39:17] God see then we just look at the acts of
[39:20] a play right but now watch the point now
[39:24] listen very carefully for a few moments
[39:27] let us who Father and Son make man in
[39:30] our own
[39:31] image now if a man was made something
[39:34] like that little sacred light
[39:37] Yonder going to way on back right or
[39:41] something
[39:42] like it could not be
[39:45] seen which is a spiritual
[39:51] being he manifested or unfolded himself
[39:54] down a little more to make a trip inity
[39:56] of himself by father Son and Holy
[40:05] Spirit but how many gods do you
[40:08] have even if you're going back to the
[40:11] the old thought of God as a spirit you
[40:13] would still hold it at least to one you
[40:15] wouldn't have a whole
[40:18] bunch so what are you
[40:22] thinking well brother brandom he has no
[40:25] problem using the word
[40:29] Trinity or
[40:33] triun he has no
[40:37] problem because he's talking of
[40:42] what like a trinity of himself but
[40:45] Father Son and Holy Ghost and here was
[40:47] God unfolded himself now down into let
[40:50] us make man which was his
[40:53] son and all sprang from him him
[40:57] man in our own image he was a
[41:00] supernatural
[41:02] being amen so now remember your
[41:05] scriptures as we go
[41:07] along let us make man in our own image
[41:10] so whatever image this is is the same
[41:18] image he was a spiritual being and we
[41:21] Are Spiritual being or were created that
[41:23] in the beginning right he was a spirit
[41:26] your spirit there no
[41:29] problem but he was a being and we're a
[41:33] being I'm talking about
[41:35] Adam the
[41:38] beginning all
[41:41] right let him have dominion over the
[41:43] cattle of the field and so and the M
[41:47] lad not in natural flesh that was later
[41:50] right right that's
[41:53] right y later he was Genesis is 2 and 7
[41:58] brother brandom what are these this
[42:00] doing he said Genesis 1 questions and
[42:04] answers you heard it if you listen to
[42:05] the
[42:06] tape he
[42:09] said God is a spirit and said the man
[42:13] was made as a spiritual being because
[42:16] God's image was spiritual
[42:18] being amen now all
[42:25] right
[42:26] hold your
[42:29] thought then if God is a spirit that's
[42:32] nonconformity to anything and has no
[42:34] form whatsoever has nothing that he is
[42:37] but just like the wind blowing about
[42:39] then he created a man just exactly like
[42:42] that our language has messed up
[42:46] somewhere that's
[42:48] right because language says let us make
[42:52] man in our own image right so whatever
[42:56] he was this man that he
[42:59] made was just like
[43:02] him you follow
[43:05] me so that order to get a lot of that
[43:08] out of your idea about this the spirit
[43:14] part all
[43:16] right then in Genesis 2:7 he made a
[43:19] natural man and he put to Genesis 1 126
[43:22] and 27 into 27 and brought him on Earth
[43:26] to do but yet he was already controlling
[43:28] the animals and leading and doing in
[43:31] that spiritual being that he
[43:36] was
[43:38] okay so think about
[43:47] it let's read this
[43:50] one number five I love
[43:55] it
[43:58] that we just
[43:59] read no man can see God in the bodily
[44:03] form because God is not in body
[44:09] form God is a
[44:13] spirit but now he doesn't say that that
[44:17] person does not have a form that's our
[44:22] problem he's talking about a bodily form
[44:25] what do you think of in bodily form I
[44:27] think of 16 elements don't you I think
[44:30] of this old
[44:35] stuff God's not in a bodily
[44:39] form but now when he created man in his
[44:42] own
[44:46] image what image was God before he
[44:48] created a
[44:52] man well I don't know I wouldn't back
[44:55] there and I don't figure I need to know
[44:58] well whoe I'm glad you're so super
[45:04] religious because these things are very
[45:06] valuable to
[45:10] me because the only way you'll ever see
[45:13] who you are is to see who God is
[45:18] first sister came to me there last
[45:21] Wednesday and said nobody else might not
[45:23] called it but said I seen for one time
[45:26] myself in the Bible Hallelujah I said
[45:28] praise the Lord amen that's all I'm
[45:31] trying to do to get you to see yourself
[45:34] in the
[45:36] Bible and when you do you can see the
[45:39] Christ and who he is and you can see
[45:41] Moses and who that was and David and who
[45:43] that was and Paul and who that was and
[45:46] brother brandom and who he was and you
[45:50] see
[45:51] yourself in the
[45:54] Bible you say but but brother Dale is
[45:57] just it's just a spiritual what okay
[46:00] let's go a little further then look at
[46:01] the next one which is number six it
[46:04] wasn't so from the
[46:06] beginning uh
[46:10] E10 now God is
[46:13] omnipotent
[46:15] omnipresent by being
[46:18] omniscient makes him om the
[46:23] present now you'll really catch shown
[46:26] what he means in a minute by that
[46:28] statement we just take it from there he
[46:31] being omniscient makes him
[46:33] omnipresent and he knows all things but
[46:36] God God could not be just like the a
[46:41] is because God has a Dwelling
[46:45] Place God is not a
[46:47] myth God is a
[46:51] being God Jesus he God
[46:54] pronoun he he is a being therefore he's
[46:57] omniscient omnipresent omnipotent and
[47:01] infinite right he's not like the air
[47:06] right floating
[47:09] around he's a
[47:12] being all right look at the next one
[47:14] Fellowship 1960
[47:17] e19 raise it on up
[47:21] toward and I said God is a being now
[47:23] watch he's talking to somebody else you
[47:25] know
[47:28] now God's just not like your like the
[47:31] hour if he would you would never have to
[47:35] seek the Holy
[47:38] Ghost it would be in
[47:42] you cuse he'd fill all space and
[47:49] things God's
[47:51] omnipresent sure by being omniscient
[47:56] he's omnipresent in the fact that he's
[47:59] omniscient he knows where he needs to be
[48:05] right knowing all things but God has a
[48:08] dwelling
[48:09] place because he's a
[48:12] being exactly right and God dwells
[48:16] with Fellowship under the shed blood of
[48:19] his son and that alone amen not up on
[48:22] our denomination sometime CU you know
[48:24] what our denomination got him oh he's
[48:27] just a floating around he's just a
[48:28] spirit he just he has no form he has no
[48:31] uh you
[48:35] know what about
[48:38] it what are you thinking
[48:43] about I didn't give them this one this
[48:45] is taken from the message of God's
[48:48] provided
[48:49] way preached in
[48:53] 1953 and God put man first first in his
[48:56] own image which was in in an image of
[49:00] God and God is a supernatural
[49:04] being he was a supernatural
[49:07] man and then he put him in five sentes
[49:10] see Adam created he was a supernatural
[49:14] man and then he was put in five senses
[49:17] none of those the senses decare anything
[49:20] but what is he he's a supernatural being
[49:23] all right going with
[49:27] who is this Mel chdc number
[49:29] 8 paragraph 48 and
[49:34] 49 preached in 1965 to20
[49:39] 221 now he if he isn't
[49:42] infinite isn't God God has to be
[49:45] infinite we're finite he's
[49:48] infinite and he was omnipresent
[49:51] omniscient and
[49:54] omnipotent if he isn't then he can't be
[49:58] God knows all things all places because
[50:01] of his omnipresent omniscient makes him
[50:04] an
[50:04] omnipresent he is a being he's not like
[50:08] the
[50:10] wind well brother Dale them others was
[50:12] written a 50 60 and he changed after the
[50:15] seals broke well that's 65 I think is
[50:18] after I believe who is this
[50:21] mzc is
[50:23] 65 he's a being he DS in a house but
[50:26] being omniscient knowing all things
[50:28] makes him an omnipresent because he
[50:30] knows everything that's going on how do
[50:34] you believe
[50:36] that can you put your life and your
[50:38] Stakes upon that to believe
[50:43] it that
[50:46] he's
[50:49] omniscient which means he knows all
[50:51] things and that makes him on the present
[50:55] and he's not not omnipresent in the
[50:57] words we use omnipresent
[51:00] right because our words of omnipresent
[51:03] if you remember through would just make
[51:06] him like the wind just being anywhere
[51:09] and
[51:10] everywhere he's not that way as I've
[51:12] always said if there's nobody on the
[51:14] moon right now he don't have to be on
[51:16] the moon that's right but when anybody
[51:19] goes up there he always goes with
[51:23] them why because he knows all things
[51:25] things right right but he's not like the
[51:28] wind he's a
[51:33] person the
[51:36] person far greater than you and I well
[51:40] if you think you're something then you
[51:43] ought to know that I'm trying to tell
[51:44] you God is greater than the something
[51:46] you think you
[51:53] are but what do you think about God is a
[51:59] spirit he's a spiritual
[52:02] being he made Man In His
[52:05] Image did he make man just a spirit or a
[52:10] spiritual
[52:18] being was the first man just a spirit
[52:20] form this
[52:22] you we talk about the angel being
[52:26] Spirits Etc but you know they do have
[52:33] forms now if we are in His image and
[52:39] listen hey I know the message a little
[52:41] bit okay I got a little bit of
[52:44] understanding that the first man was
[52:46] made in the image of God the spirit man
[52:49] second man was made in the image of
[52:51] animal right you know hand like a
[52:54] chimpanzee
[52:55] etc
[52:57] etc but you know when we get over on
[53:02] that other side and all of this is gone
[53:06] are we going to see a glob sitting
[53:10] somewhere and realize it's the
[53:17] father well we don't have no
[53:21] form or is it just that we can just feel
[53:24] the wind blowing through the
[53:27] heavens and we think well that's
[53:31] him
[53:34] well I think the prophet done a good job
[53:38] of defining
[53:40] that if he's just everywhere then you
[53:44] wouldn't have to pray for the Holy Ghost
[53:46] right he'd be inside
[53:49] you CU he'd be everywhere well you know
[53:52] where that' make him if he's in you he'd
[53:54] be an a
[53:56] Hitler he'd be in judas's
[53:59] character he'd be in the meanest person
[54:01] you could think of in in your
[54:05] life
[54:06] right right now and now I hope we don't
[54:10] believe
[54:11] that at least to get away from that we
[54:14] might make him a round bouncing ball as
[54:17] a glob but we certainly don't want this
[54:20] to put it to work that it would just be
[54:22] in everything that's right
[54:28] and see that would make the devil then
[54:31] to be in that form too because he'd be a
[54:36] spirit do you understand what I'm
[54:38] getting
[54:41] at I believe God is
[54:47] real I believe that he's not just like
[54:51] the
[54:53] wind he's a being he's a supernatural
[54:57] being but that supernatural being can be
[55:00] anywhere in the world he desires to be
[55:03] that's right right
[55:05] now but being as he is as a being he
[55:10] limits himself forgive me for the
[55:13] words he limits himself to the point
[55:17] of being in one place y you know or many
[55:23] places if he desires to be
[55:25] and that's why I like the scripture
[55:27] where it says you know that and talks
[55:30] about how that the prophet expressing it
[55:34] that see Jesus could only be in one
[55:37] place but now he's got a many membered
[55:40] body that can be around the world so
[55:43] then the more are many there you know
[55:46] more and things in the scriptures
[55:49] doesn't go wrong it's
[55:50] true all but what do you think about God
[56:02] my desire has always been one
[56:06] thing and that's to learn more about him
[56:10] am I've always had that desire I had it
[56:13] when I was in the Baptist
[56:15] Church I wanted somebody to tell me
[56:18] about
[56:20] him
[56:22] but what they would tell me didn't bit
[56:25] what I had an understanding
[56:27] of so one day I had to walk out of there
[56:30] and move
[56:34] on because I I knew that
[56:39] there the people I was talking to didn't
[56:42] have the same thing in them that I had
[56:45] in me even in the point that I wasn't
[56:47] even claiming to be born again at that
[56:53] time
[56:56] see because even a person's not born
[56:58] again got a little common
[57:02] sense you you might not be able to to
[57:06] know God in the correct way but at least
[57:09] you can know there's a
[57:10] God you
[57:12] know I mean you can know there's
[57:14] something real about all of
[57:17] this instead of thinking like an idiot
[57:19] that we was a poliwog flipped over on
[57:22] one side and grow an arm and the leg and
[57:24] flipped over the other way grow another
[57:25] night while we stood up and begin to
[57:26] walk well where did the pow come
[57:31] from right
[57:37] right but then we'll come into the uh
[57:41] religious
[57:42] realm of
[57:44] mankind and in our religious realm of
[57:47] mankind we read the word of
[57:50] God and and not having say the inside
[57:53] teacher
[57:56] that we will try to put our own thoughts
[57:59] upon that scriptures and come out with
[58:02] some concept or
[58:06] thought and that's where your trinities
[58:08] come from your no your hell being
[58:11] Eternal you're all kind of things that
[58:13] comes out of people in their minds
[58:18] thinking without it being the Holy Ghost
[58:20] to
[58:21] teach I I want the inside teacher don't
[58:24] you
[58:26] right and see that with that inside
[58:28] teacher then I don't I wouldn't have to
[58:30] worry about anything all right but do
[58:33] you understand what I'm getting at
[58:36] right I'm not talking
[58:38] about now listen we have to use phrases
[58:41] and words and I'm not talking about
[58:44] where that God begins to condescend
[58:50] down to where we can understand him or
[58:53] help us to I'm talking about what was he
[58:57] before the world before
[59:00] anything before any concept thoughts or
[59:08] ideas I Think Jesus would have a pretty
[59:11] good understanding of the scriptures
[59:14] with you when he said you know that uh
[59:18] God is a spirit and they that worship
[59:21] Him must worship Him in what spirit and
[59:26] in lies that's told by
[59:30] everybody not exactly what it says right
[59:34] spirit and in
[59:39] truth I was thinking about it today and
[59:41] I still didn't bring it I forgot
[59:43] it do you realize that nobody can see
[59:46] God unless they see him in you
[59:50] right CU
[59:53] remember God is is a spirit
[59:57] amen but if they can see what's come in
[1:00:00] your
[1:00:01] life and seeing it affect you right and
[1:00:06] seeing you
[1:00:07] live in that
[1:00:09] realm of you know to them as a place
[1:00:14] that they say we can never attain un to
[1:00:16] where you
[1:00:18] are you know we we value you we honor
[1:00:21] you we we do but we can't live like
[1:00:25] that because we are in this realm
[1:00:32] here for you sisters as the prophet
[1:00:35] would say now for you to go down the
[1:00:37] road walking with your high drag in the
[1:00:40] ground is the what's the lady that's the
[1:00:43] singer crystal gaale is she an image of
[1:00:47] a
[1:00:48] Christian when her High I remember
[1:00:51] seeing it one time it was like a couple
[1:00:53] of feet you know on the
[1:00:56] ground
[1:00:57] well is that the image of a
[1:01:00] Christian when you turn it around and
[1:01:03] her face is painted and makeup all over
[1:01:05] it and and her clothes are ungodly
[1:01:11] and no but what about you sisters just
[1:01:14] going about your daily Duty and you're
[1:01:17] going to Walmart you're going to where
[1:01:20] you work or whatever you do and you just
[1:01:23] dress correctly and you have your hair
[1:01:25] fixed and and all of the things and you
[1:01:28] know you're a
[1:01:30] witness to them about
[1:01:33] Christianity why because you got the
[1:01:35] rest of the makeup right you
[1:01:45] know was it not to prophet's words like
[1:01:48] this he said live me a
[1:01:50] sermon instead of preaching me one y
[1:01:53] right man
[1:01:56] you see somebody that can preach like a
[1:01:58] LK but live like the
[1:02:01] devil i' I
[1:02:05] get that one irks
[1:02:08] me I'm sorry I'm human I ain't blaming
[1:02:12] that on 74 it irked me when I was
[1:02:17] 25 it irks me to see the people of this
[1:02:20] message that had rather hear a man
[1:02:23] that's been married for 9 times and he's
[1:02:26] he's a jail bird and he can sing and and
[1:02:29] he can do all the things and they'd
[1:02:31] rather hear him than someone who has
[1:02:34] lived a decent life and at least tried
[1:02:36] to be right and
[1:02:38] honest and stay with the word now you
[1:02:41] know what I'm saying is true you just
[1:02:45] don't want to admit it that's
[1:02:50] right right you don't want to admit it
[1:02:53] but it's true right that don't change
[1:02:55] the
[1:02:58] point but for to see I thought we were
[1:03:01] to I never knew that all of this great
[1:03:04] understanding of the message was to do
[1:03:06] away with the fruits of the
[1:03:10] spirit I thought it was to bring it into
[1:03:13] manifestation I thought the fruits of
[1:03:15] the spirit was instead of just saying
[1:03:16] Faith virtue knowledge I thought you
[1:03:18] could say love joy peace goodness I
[1:03:20] thought that was the fruits of the
[1:03:22] spirit and I thought that was what God
[1:03:25] wants to see in each and every one of us
[1:03:31] right right
[1:03:34] amen and see then if people can see
[1:03:37] Christ in you they want to be like
[1:03:44] that but I've always told you and I know
[1:03:48] it hurts feelings so get ready rub it
[1:03:53] good some of the people of this message
[1:03:56] I wouldn't want to be their
[1:04:02] children some of the preachers in this
[1:04:04] message I wouldn't want to be their
[1:04:09] children if I die and go to hell I'd
[1:04:12] like to stay at least sensible enough to
[1:04:15] try to live a decent life before my
[1:04:17] kids that they could actually be able to
[1:04:21] in a little way see Christ amen amen yes
[1:04:27] sir because I've always believed that
[1:04:29] whatever God was back there he still is
[1:04:32] that's right am sir
[1:04:36] am but he's not like the wind he's a
[1:04:40] being right he dwells in a
[1:04:46] house I thought that we understood that
[1:04:50] Jesus was up there right now building us
[1:04:53] a house
[1:04:55] called a future
[1:04:58] home but I didn't think he was up there
[1:05:01] doing it I thought he was down here in
[1:05:03] you and I sending up boards that we say
[1:05:08] for whatever the Mansion is well what
[1:05:11] would our mansion look
[1:05:14] like
[1:05:21] right but what about God
[1:05:25] see God had
[1:05:27] to move from that position that he was
[1:05:32] in and remember the position I'm talking
[1:05:35] about is not just like the wind floating
[1:05:41] around he was in another dimensional
[1:05:44] form or whatever you want to call it
[1:05:45] Place house living dwelling moon stars
[1:05:48] Mars whatever you want to call
[1:05:51] it God lived before any of the this ever
[1:05:54] come into being
[1:05:56] amen that's
[1:06:00] right and you know that he had
[1:06:03] thoughts about Redemption etc
[1:06:07] etc I won't get to it tonight but next
[1:06:10] Wednesday we'll get to it to find out
[1:06:13] when them thoughts started coming into
[1:06:23] display
[1:06:25] he had those thoughts as Spirit
[1:06:30] God but when he condescended down into
[1:06:33] another
[1:06:36] form brother BR said he stands there and
[1:06:38] in his
[1:06:41] mind he's thinking about how to do
[1:06:45] this that's not the spirit God before
[1:06:47] the foundation of the world that's the
[1:06:50] logos one to
[1:06:53] create
[1:06:55] these are not new
[1:07:00] things let me just give you just a
[1:07:02] little bit where I lay a foundation for
[1:07:05] the next
[1:07:07] message what about a prophet that could
[1:07:10] talk like
[1:07:13] this seventh grade education
[1:07:16] man but yet he could speak of these
[1:07:18] things pull up number
[1:07:20] nine
[1:07:21] preparation preached in 53
[1:07:25] 1111 paragraph
[1:07:32] 23 let's take a minute little mental
[1:07:34] trip tonight you and I and let's go back
[1:07:36] before there there was a star in the
[1:07:39] heaven for there even wasn't
[1:07:44] anything how a man could go back I love
[1:07:48] I love that statement where he talks
[1:07:49] about God and he said in the
[1:07:52] beginning before for the
[1:07:56] Eternal we can't talk about
[1:07:59] eternity he's talking about in the
[1:08:01] beginning before
[1:08:04] eternity and then we want to try to make
[1:08:07] God as just some Spirit
[1:08:10] form
[1:08:14] oh for there was a star and everything
[1:08:17] sitting way back in eternity that was
[1:08:19] God and then going out of God or God
[1:08:23] unfold holding
[1:08:26] himself what comes the logos which was
[1:08:30] the son of God are the word of
[1:08:36] God right in the beginning was a word
[1:08:39] and word was with God and the Word was
[1:08:41] God and the Word was made flesh and
[1:08:42] dwelt Among Us the logos we'll get to it
[1:08:45] later I got it laying on the desk may
[1:08:47] have it here I doubt it but have you
[1:08:49] ever noticed in the message the
[1:08:51] unveiling of God brother B said in the
[1:08:53] beginning was Elohim Elohim was with God
[1:08:55] and Elohim was
[1:08:56] God he had no problem talking that way
[1:09:00] right he had no problem speaking of a
[1:09:05] Son of
[1:09:09] God but he never did talk about God the
[1:09:16] son all right and watch we're seeing God
[1:09:19] unfold
[1:09:21] himself then he said in Genesis let us
[1:09:24] make man in our own image what kind of a
[1:09:25] man was he he had to be a spirit
[1:09:29] man and they put him in the senses to
[1:09:31] contact Earthly home he gave him a foot
[1:09:33] like a bear and hand like a
[1:09:35] monkey but he was a spirit man cuz God
[1:09:38] was Spirit but he said he begins to
[1:09:41] unfold now what was the scripture that
[1:09:43] we said to
[1:09:45] remember no man has seen God at any time
[1:09:48] one John 1:18 no man has seen God at any
[1:09:51] time but the only begotten
[1:09:57] son that's the scripture we read now
[1:09:59] come on the only begotten son ha
[1:10:03] declared him or as as the prophet would
[1:10:07] say brought him out into the
[1:10:19] open the Son of God which was the word
[1:10:22] of God
[1:10:26] all right go on to the next try to cut
[1:10:29] off in just a
[1:10:31] minute the message called
[1:10:34] life let's close our
[1:10:36] eyes to our imagination for a few
[1:10:39] moments and go way back into the before
[1:10:42] there was
[1:10:43] anything the great Fountain of all
[1:10:46] eternity couldn't you just hear a
[1:10:47] theologian trying to explain
[1:10:52] that you real
[1:10:54] what this man was doing a theologian
[1:10:59] say where did he get
[1:11:03] that he got that the way Moses got that
[1:11:06] and wrote that all right how did Moses
[1:11:10] get all about Genesis and what happened
[1:11:12] in the garden and wrote the first five
[1:11:15] books wrote of his own death for he died
[1:11:19] right now come on get read your
[1:11:22] Bible
[1:11:24] huh way back no
[1:11:28] what Fountain of Eternity was that
[1:11:30] Spirit of love joy that Spirit of
[1:11:32] honesty that Spirit of tress what was
[1:11:34] back before the world all of that in
[1:11:37] this Perfection then out of the
[1:11:39] existence of the father went the logos
[1:11:42] which was the son which was the
[1:11:44] theophany which was the body of the
[1:11:47] great Jehovah God went forth in a
[1:11:50] Celestial body right right
[1:11:54] that's the logos the word spoke out of
[1:11:56] them great Fountains of life and went
[1:11:58] forth and there was the theophany which
[1:12:00] was God made in word right we we'll go
[1:12:04] back over this next
[1:12:09] Wednesday but what I want you to uh get
[1:12:12] is just a little point and then we'll
[1:12:17] quit mind can only comprehend what the
[1:12:19] seat can
[1:12:22] endure
[1:12:26] all
[1:12:26] right let me get the
[1:12:29] license trying to find there there it
[1:12:34] is look what he says on questions and
[1:12:36] answers on
[1:12:38] Genesis you should have heard him say
[1:12:42] this paragraph
[1:12:44] 21 which would be number 13
[1:12:47] brother back up cuz you're on 14 I want
[1:12:51] to be on 13 first because you're on it
[1:12:55] Hebrews run it up now where we can see
[1:12:57] it he talking about the leading the Holy
[1:13:00] Spirit he was in other words Adam was
[1:13:02] the first man in the lower creation of
[1:13:06] God now theologians get ready for your
[1:13:09] teeth to fall in the floor because how
[1:13:11] are you going to comprehend what this
[1:13:13] man with his sixth or seventh grade
[1:13:15] education is fixing to
[1:13:18] say the first creation was God
[1:13:22] himself
[1:13:27] you know the Bible tells you where God
[1:13:28] come
[1:13:30] from do you know
[1:13:33] that he come from teeman that's
[1:13:36] right and look up Tean you'll find out
[1:13:38] it means right hand so you need to go
[1:13:40] right back around to your circle and it
[1:13:42] all connects but look the first creation
[1:13:45] was God himself then out of God came the
[1:13:48] Loos which was the son of God then out
[1:13:51] of the Loos which was the word in the
[1:13:52] beginning was word and word with God and
[1:13:54] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:13:56] flesh and dwell among out of the L guys
[1:13:58] came forth the man bringing it down to
[1:14:07] Genesis I thought that we understood
[1:14:10] that gen that Revelations
[1:14:12] 3:14 begins talking about the message to
[1:14:17] this age and it says the beginning of
[1:14:20] the creation of God
[1:14:25] amen we want to lay that all Upon Jesus
[1:14:29] and that's wonderful because we we'll do
[1:14:31] that we have to bring it forth because
[1:14:32] he coming into being where he says a
[1:14:34] body thou has prepared
[1:14:37] me but where did the Sun come into
[1:14:44] being the prophet can talk about it in
[1:14:46] simple
[1:14:47] terminologies but the sun was the first
[1:14:51] form of God that moved out to where we
[1:14:53] could
[1:14:54] comprehend amen Our God condescended in
[1:14:58] the form to be the word god being the
[1:15:03] son but we don't believe in Eternal
[1:15:05] sunship so just get that part out of the
[1:15:09] way but we believe in Eternal godship
[1:15:13] right do you need that
[1:15:14] quote that's what your Prophet said
[1:15:17] don't believe in Eternal sunship he said
[1:15:18] but I believe in Eternal
[1:15:20] godship amen
[1:15:24] I believe that a Son of God can be
[1:15:28] Eternal
[1:15:29] amen I hope I'm looking at a bunch of
[1:15:33] them right that have eternal
[1:15:35] life and you know what we never will be
[1:15:38] nothing but Sons and Daughters of God so
[1:15:40] we better kind of get used to that
[1:15:45] point but God being the first Creation
[1:15:48] in other words simple terminologies now
[1:15:50] what's he
[1:15:52] saying
[1:15:53] God just simply moving from the
[1:15:55] existence of where he was over into
[1:15:59] another existence is that the way we
[1:16:01] will get back to it next
[1:16:03] week the word that the prophet was
[1:16:06] explaining he says not a part of God
[1:16:09] going off like a lamb or an arm or
[1:16:12] something he said but a part just going
[1:16:19] out and that's the Son of God but
[1:16:22] brother d i not was Son of God 2,000
[1:16:24] years ago that's how far we are missing
[1:16:28] it evand
[1:16:31] Scofield in his
[1:16:33] footnotes
[1:16:34] comprehends the point of talking about
[1:16:37] Son of
[1:16:39] God as the word the theophany why
[1:16:44] because I believed the Bible says that
[1:16:48] all things were created by Him and
[1:16:51] without him which was a son
[1:16:56] right
[1:16:57] Hallelujah nothing wouldn't created
[1:17:00] outside of Him Father didn't create a
[1:17:01] thing but a body for the son to step
[1:17:04] into and he had to come 4,000 years
[1:17:08] ahead of time to be the Son of God to
[1:17:11] where he could speak the word into
[1:17:12] existence to bring a
[1:17:18] body I know that to most people is like
[1:17:22] I said a the
[1:17:23] his mind goes Haywire how could God have
[1:17:26] a
[1:17:28] beginning he's not talking about a
[1:17:30] beginning like we talk about he's not
[1:17:31] talking about a creation like we talk
[1:17:33] about it he's talking about a coming
[1:17:35] into existence to where you can see
[1:17:39] it
[1:17:41] right there was a day my wife and I
[1:17:44] could not see our
[1:17:49] children but according to genetic makeup
[1:17:52] they were were th present in
[1:17:59] me true that's
[1:18:02] right what do you think about
[1:18:05] it what about your
[1:18:11] God but brother Dale you read a
[1:18:13] statement a while ago that where brother
[1:18:15] Brandon said is not in a bodily
[1:18:17] form I agree
[1:18:19] wholeheartedly not in a 16 element form
[1:18:28] but let's read this last one and we'll
[1:18:30] quit which is taken from the message
[1:18:33] questions and answers on Hebrews part
[1:18:35] two
[1:18:38] 5712 paragraph 385 will be number
[1:18:43] 14 all
[1:18:45] right God went out logos so Jesus had a
[1:18:50] beginning God had no beginning see but
[1:18:53] the son was not Eternal sunship but the
[1:18:56] son that was with the father in the
[1:18:59] beginning was the logos that went out of
[1:19:03] God
[1:19:04] right it was the theophany of God that
[1:19:07] went out
[1:19:10] y well theophanies and Spirits are just
[1:19:13] floating around the human form that
[1:19:16] didn't have eyes like you
[1:19:19] see oh that'd be a good one to stop
[1:19:21] wouldn't it
[1:19:23] a better eye it didn't have ears like
[1:19:26] you hear but a far more hearing see it
[1:19:30] was a theophany that all this rainbow
[1:19:33] conders into theophany Moses saw it when
[1:19:35] it passed through the rock like that he
[1:19:37] saw the back part said it looked like a
[1:19:41] man I thought brother brandham when he
[1:19:43] went beyond the curtain of time could
[1:19:44] feel those people that he said was in
[1:19:50] theophany I thought he could feel him
[1:19:56] right but you see we want to make
[1:19:58] everything so supernaturally spiritual
[1:20:00] until we just put oursel totally out of
[1:20:02] the
[1:20:04] way and you know but I've been at this
[1:20:08] 40 years so I ain't worried about it we
[1:20:10] got 40 more be
[1:20:15] fine probably some of us won't be here
[1:20:17] but that's fine with
[1:20:21] me
[1:20:23] what's my point my point is that when I
[1:20:25] saw what this Prophet started talking
[1:20:28] about I laid down all of my thinking
[1:20:31] about what I used to think about God is
[1:20:34] a spirit and he's juster
[1:20:38] this there he goes no he ain't going
[1:20:41] nothing and he's over
[1:20:45] here now don't tell me we didn't think
[1:20:48] about them
[1:20:51] things don't tell me you didn't have
[1:20:54] questions back
[1:20:58] then you
[1:20:59] see the God I serve is real so let's
[1:21:02] come on
[1:21:04] Brothers he was real before he ever got
[1:21:07] here where we're at and all we're doing
[1:21:10] is just showing the reality of a living
[1:21:13] God and what he really
[1:21:18] is to speak of him
[1:21:21] as being
[1:21:25] tangible yeah but brother Dale you just
[1:21:27] try to make God too tangible well now if
[1:21:30] he could create this wood it's pretty
[1:21:32] hard he got to be greater than
[1:21:36] that but we just don't see him like
[1:21:42] that but he condescended so you and I
[1:21:45] could understand let's
[1:21:49] stand
[1:21:51] Christ the son of the Living
[1:21:58] God we'll try to bring it more Wednesday
[1:22:01] to get back on
[1:22:03] it but see when he says Christ the son
[1:22:06] of the Living God and when he say Jesus
[1:22:09] Christ created all things we know the
[1:22:11] Flesh of Jesus never
[1:22:13] created it was the
[1:22:16] Christ the Christ created all
[1:22:20] things then Peter had a great Revelation
[1:22:23] that the church is built upon the church
[1:22:25] is not built upon Concepts or ideas of
[1:22:28] imaginations of Spiritual Beings or this
[1:22:31] doing this this know you know we don't
[1:22:33] know nothing about it the Bible is full
[1:22:35] of the truth of God am men saw
[1:22:41] God but they never saw God they saw the
[1:22:44] form he used for the day
[1:22:48] right he would appear in a form to
[1:22:51] mankind but yet mzd spoke of him in
[1:22:55] Hebrews 7 and it calls him almighty God
[1:22:59] right but you know what it called him
[1:23:01] there too verse forly it called him a
[1:23:06] man and you know Abraham fed a calf to a
[1:23:09] man
[1:23:11] amen he didn't feed a calf to a spirit
[1:23:14] it floating around or something right he
[1:23:16] fed it to a
[1:23:18] man that man was almighty God go ahead
[1:23:21] brother what we got 596
[1:23:23] feel the P think on these
[1:23:28] things at night iay in in bed and I
[1:23:35] begin to
[1:23:36] cry anybody have
[1:23:39] a
[1:23:42] and fails to
[1:23:50] know I
[1:23:53] maybe the reason we don't see God is
[1:23:56] because we don't believe God is
[1:24:00] real
[1:24:01] within it must be God if I was only
[1:24:05] expecting to see a spirit I would be
[1:24:08] trying to figure out which way the wind
[1:24:10] are
[1:24:12] blow I feel the pool just remember if
[1:24:18] God is like people thinks then you don't
[1:24:20] have to pray for the Holy Ghost it's in
[1:24:23] you because it's the
[1:24:27] wind but he's not like the wind give my
[1:24:32] heart he's
[1:24:34] real he speaks to
[1:24:39] me and I
[1:24:45] agree Lord please come and take control
[1:24:51] I feel
[1:24:53] the
[1:24:56] poor I went to hear the
[1:25:03] word say that well we're sending him for
[1:25:06] that purpose amen father you make it
[1:25:11] manifest in Jesus
[1:25:14] name anybody
[1:25:18] else they

[1:25:28] within it must
[1:25:31] be in my soul for I feel the pool we run

[1:25:42] brothers will if you'll come up I let's
[1:25:46] pray over this and then we'll leave it

[1:27:51] feel God is wanting you and I to move
[1:27:54] closer and get away from all of the
[1:27:56] things and ideas and thoughts that's
[1:27:58] right we're getting older we're worrying
[1:28:01] out that's all
[1:28:02] right then he said last night said we
[1:28:05] getting old ain't we well I'm not
[1:28:09] worried about it don't care how much
[1:28:11] longer we got or how much shorter we got

[1:28:17] resting in
[1:28:18] him and believing it right
[1:28:23] doctor tell you you got this that of the
[1:28:24] other okay hey Doc that's what you

[1:28:31] healer that's right he's the one who
[1:28:34] takes care of me so I ain't going to be
[1:28:37] worried about it you go to the doctors
[1:28:40] I'd like to I'd
[1:28:43] like if you'd sat down and listen for
[1:28:46] about 4 hours I'd like to explain
[1:28:49] healing in
[1:28:51] doctors I may do that one day because
[1:28:53] that's been on my mind for quite a
[1:28:57] while you mean God now we know there's
[1:28:59] quacks but they quack preachers so don't
[1:29:02] worry about that part you
[1:29:05] know but real doctors are trying to help
[1:29:09] you right they do the best they
[1:29:12] can well you know when your head's are
[1:29:15] hurting a good old aspirin that was made
[1:29:17] by somebody is real good to take away
[1:29:21] that pain
[1:29:22] you don't have to keep on
[1:29:25] hurting the prophet said that little
[1:29:27] nitroglycerin peel he said it's nothing
[1:29:30] but just for that little valve in there
[1:29:32] that kind of opens it up and makes it
[1:29:35] work he said we God knew we would need
[1:29:39] that and he gave it to
[1:29:43] us yeah but you put too much confidence
[1:29:46] in
[1:29:47] do hey if you went with me sometimes and
[1:29:50] way I talk to doct you would you
[1:29:53] probably wouldn't want to doctor me cuz
[1:29:56] I don't mind telling them doc I'll do
[1:29:57] what you're saying but God is the
[1:30:02] Healer he's the one who takes care of
[1:30:04] things so you do the best you can
[1:30:07] do that's you know you help
[1:30:11] me and you know but we're going to sit
[1:30:14] up front and say God Is A
[1:30:19] Healer ain't nothing wrong with taking
