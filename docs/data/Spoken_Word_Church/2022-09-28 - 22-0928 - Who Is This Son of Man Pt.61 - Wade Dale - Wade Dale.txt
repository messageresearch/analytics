every one of you here good to be in the house of the Lord in the middle of the week man I hadn't had a chance to listen to this weekend service but we'll get it online so we can watch it and uh see how they did thank you I'm glad somebody said wonderful I was hoping for somebody to say something wonderful thank you all for taking over brother Aaron doing uh singing and and all that that's really good so I appreciate that we uh we had a good time in Ohio they said thank you and and God bless you for the prayers for them and they're moving on with the Lord and uh we got to take communion and foot washing and kind of rededicate the place that they were at they're at now so uh we appreciate them we love him with the love of the Lord it is a long way up there though that airplane's not very long but boy about 11 hours of driving it's tough making eyes cross when you get about halfway down here but we broke it up a little bit we got to see brother Richard and Sister Janice Wilson have uh lunch with them and fellowship for a couple hours for them and then we took on off and visited some friends of ours that we had not seen for a long long time and since about 1995 they used to be our neighbors so we got a chance to spend some time with them so it was all good everything was good all right uh Saturday we will have Bible study between six and eight o'clock as usual uh communion will be Sunday brother Aaron will be speaking next Wednesday Lord willing also remember on October the 9th brother Samuel najera from uh Beaufort South Carolina will be with us his children have been here he's been here but he's going to minister for us him and him and brother Louise actually will be doing the ministering so because he'll be uh speaking in Spanish but we'll have him with us on October the 9th and now on October the 16th I've been thinking about this um it seems like I get in trouble when I write things down but uh boot devil but on October the 16th at second service October the 16th that'll be three weeks and second service we're going to have questions and answers for singles and Youth Donnie you're out but for singles and youth right on that'll be the second service on October 16th so if you have any questions forward them to me or give them to one of the deacons brother Terence brother Bob or one of the ministers and then they can pass them into me now don't do it on that day you can if you wish but um kind of give us a little bit of time to study some and uh but it's been on my heart for for a little while we used to do it with the youth when we had to use service but it kind of extended made everything longer and we couldn't Fellowship a lot so so we're going to do that as a church for singles and for the Youth if you have a question that you need to ask that's been on your heart between now and then the Lord should give you something Lord to Lord give you something to ask but it'll be the second service the whole service will take up on questions and answers just for the Youth and just for singles everybody with me all right Nyla that's you unless something happens miraculous in the next three weeks truly just fell but it's been on my heart to do that so um we were praying the other night and that came in my heart also to uh to let the youth have a voice to let them ask some questions and even the singles um Pearl Zack and Lily will be married by then so they won't get to ask anything but if you have a question please bring it forward and give it to us and also remember by way of just letting you know remember to everybody's done the RSVP if you go into the wedding all right which is on November the 6th at four o'clock we'll only have one service here and then we'll go to the wedding and then also the church dinner we always have one at Thanksgiving and it's not catered so we'll be we'll be um all of us will be cooking for that will be on November 13th November 13th we'll only have one service November 13th and that's not too far away where did September go now you know when you say even some come quickly Lord Jesus he's helping us right he's helping us because this thing is going fast I mean like really fast but you know thank God I'd hate for it to be lengthened the other way in this world that we live in goodness gracious you got that right you ain't kidding so let's turn our Bibles and get this thing fired up here to John and tonight I want to bring a little I want to bring it a little at a little bit of an angle I've been praying about uh about this one thing and and it's called a showdown there's going to be a showdown but there's going to be a showdown when we start up that statue of perfect man because it's going to be a separation some will fall off some will not make it I'm sorry that's just the way it is some will some won't you just got to decide whether you want to or not amen so it's your decision if you want to make it or not God has given us all the provisions he has not let's think about this the other day God you know we can we go to work and and uh somebody was saying something the other day about uh you know getting mistreated at work well I mean we all do we all think we get mistreated but kids think you get mistreated by the parents the parents they could get mistreated by the grandparents you know you just keep going up the line everybody gets mistreated by everybody and listen when we were born listen we're the one of the most selfish things on the earth as a human being think about it we're the most selfish people in the world but when we get up to that brotherly kindness that's going to have to shed off that's gonna have to shed off it's not whether you like me and I don't like you or whether you said something good and I like you and I'm in your camp today but tomorrow I'll be in another Camp because you said something to hurt my feelings no that's not what brotherly kindness is not that kind of Brotherly kindness so there's going to be a showdown and we'll listen to what brother Brown has to say about Showdown because there's going to be one there was one in the largest time there was one in Jesus this time and there's going to be one in the end time there's going to be a showdown so we're going to go through this and this would be part 61. and I hope and pray that we continue on the uh the service we had a couple weeks ago I know that sometimes is that was an anomaly but but I enjoyed it but you just think about you think about that atmosphere we were under a couple of Sundays ago because see it Ebbs and flows and that's just the way it is it's just like this our whole life is you know just like this but when we get into eternity sister Anna that's gonna be for an eternity there'll be no I'm tired we got to close the service no it'll be just continuously like that so if you didn't like it two weeks ago you ain't gonna like it in eternity and you probably ain't gonna be there we gotta get used to it here let it out I'll even read your quote where brother Brown almost says that let it out whatever you got let it out so let's bow our heads I know we all have needs we remember the ones in Florida some of the Believers down there riding it out so we know the master of the Wind hey man remember sister Brenda Lewis you wrote that song it'll take a stronger win than this and she wrote it in the middle of a hurricane hey man so in in your troubles today in the middle of your hurricane you remember it'll take a stronger wind than that to knock a Christian off dear heavenly father Lord thank you for this evening you give us thank you for the people you have here Lord assembled together Lord may we all be now in one mind and one Accord may we lose all the thoughts of the of the world and the things that we need to do and we got to do and forgot to do Lord may we just listen to you just for a few minutes Lord I know there's many needs father many sicknesses and Among Us Lord I pray that you'll just be with them Lord and comfort them be with the ones that are traveling such a Barbara said she's traveling out so be with her Lord be with the ones in Florida Lord even be with the ones the linemen and all the ones that are doing the work Lord you'll keep them safe Lord no trees will fall on them or get electrocuted because it's a it's a real trying time when you have to put those wires back up so we pray for them also Lord father they're human beings doesn't matter if they're bright or not they're human beings and we pray for the human beings that are there Lord that you'll come for them Lord give them strength father and that you'll bless the one the little bride also this is there Lord I know they're what they're doing they're talking to you and I pray now that you'll just be with us in this service speak to us today forgive us of our sins in Jesus name we pray amen let me read you this quote brother Brown says and stop you a perfect man so now that is the house that God dwells in that's what we're coming to we've we've come to the place to where we uh leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ we should be able to leave the principles of being born again uh and I hope that that that that we understand that being born again is a journey all right it's not an Abrupt tent it's a journey it's a journey to get born again but once you get bored again brother Brown said you just began to start right there that begins your Christian Journey all right and if you're in justification you're in sanctification and and you realize that then thank God you realize that a man knocked it out just got it all and I'm going to lay down in the I'm gonna lay down in the Roses well you lay down well roses you'd be in bad shape lay down lay down into into lilies and just lay back in the field well it's probably a fire ant bed laying underneath you called the devil but now this is the house that God dwells in not a building with a big Bell on top of it and a high steeple but a body has now prepared me a body that God can dwell in look God can walk in God can sin God can talk in God can work in amen living instrumentality of God God walking on two feet in you glory the footsteps of the righteous is ordered of God God walking in you for you are written Epistles read of all men and if the life that's in Christ being you you'll bear the life that Christ born now what is the life of Christ right there that's not your perfect man that is the life of Jesus Christ that is what he lived and listen that's what he portrayed he didn't just live it he portrayed it in his everyday walk but you got to remember like I said before he was so misunderstood they called him a wine barrel they said he hung around Sinners and prostitutes they said he wasn't Belgium of he was the king of the devils no he was this right here in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and we behold his glory the glory the only begotten of the father for the grace and truth he may be seated Lord has blessing to the reading of the word think about this God that created the air had to one day suck that air in his lungs and start screaming and he was a baby he decided to do that he decided to come down to where you and he that funnel came down to humanity to where you and I could what we can live like he lived all right amen divine right with that all right first Thessalonians four of those forces that every one of you should know how to possess his vessel I was thinking yesterday you know you like I said before you've got that faction over here that says well if anything is dead ought to be buried you got the faction over here that says well we need all teaching but there's got to be a middle of the road there's got to be there's got to be some emotion when when you sisters had babies there was an emotion all right and you remembered when you had that child hey man so that we remember now look every one of you should know when you go to school and you learn and you go through 12 grades and you get a diploma 12 grades get a diploma right you you have what you've accomplished what man says you need for that time and period of your life but now that doesn't make you super intelligent that doesn't make you a doctor instantly that doesn't make you a teacher instantly that doesn't make you the best human being that ever lived no you got a part of your journey finished all right so when we come to this we're going to see that that we come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost and we leave that we don't leave it alone we leave it because it becomes part of us and then we walk on that diploma that you got at high school it's followed you for the rest of your life whether you know it or not you've used it sometime in your life you've used what was behind that diploma what some teacher taught you are you getting the spiritual part of this amen because there's a spiritual part of this it's the teaching that we have we love teaching we are built for teaching we love to hear good teaching all right but what we're going to do with that teaching is going to have to take us to a body change or either we just sat here and wasted our time I'm sorry that's what I'm telling you it's going to be a showdown you say well listen the Bible says more is received more is required so the more we have it's required God's looking at us saying hey come on you got it what are you going to do with it because there's a lot of places go out to the internet and listen I'm sorry I'm like brother Branham you know I don't ever want to be critical but brother Bynum had a critical spirit one time does everybody know that put in your put it in your computer and put in critical he said God forgive me for this critical spirit that I have because he was criticizing everybody even brother around even brother Brown came to a place where he called him Ricky's and rickettas and what God say he said don't do that no more those are my kids those are my children amen so we got to be able to put this out there and I was telling them in Ohio it's got to be able uh God's a master surgeon he can cut you and you don't even know it but now I promise you we've been in some Services where they fire up a chainsaw it ain't pretty when a chainsaw goes to cutting flesh there's blood on the wall Blood on the floor guts all over the place that's not what we want that's what the devil will do to you if you'll let him but I want to go to the master surgeon I want to go to where that cut this thing out of me cut all this out of me and listen may not even know it at the moment but have a aha moment say hey that thing's gone hey that thing's it left me that's what I want us to experience I want every one of you to say all right this is where I begin this is my attitude this is my altitude and this is where I began now what am I going to do three months later six months later if we're here that long A year later what are we going to do from here to there if you stayed the same then listen God moves on right God is a mover he is not he doesn't go backwards we're the only ones that backslide don't backslide now he'll go back and get you thank God but he's not gonna go back and stay he's going to bring you up but that every one of you should know how to possess his what his vessel that's not your car that's not it's not a vessel like a car or or our house that's the vessel you walk around in every day that's the vessel that the world sees and I was saying a couple of Sundays ago listen God is depending on me and you to get this thing finished he's gonna he's done his part he's given us the Holy Ghost he's given us the word of God he's given us everything we need and now he's given us a chance to walk up that statue of perfect man I say walk up yes thus don't run up come on let's walk up brother Brian said you want to jump way up here you want to jump everybody wants to everybody wants to be in the son of man Ministry when they don't even have the Son of God Ministry down yet to having all these virtues working as it was as it was working with the disciples in the early days so that's what I want us to come back to that disciple of the early days to where the little nod from God the prophet said there was a little tug at their heart and they went and did what they were going to do they would preach and the Holy Ghost would just fall on people right you said no I gotta have it they didn't back there so they're not going to have to have it now while the word was being preached the Holy Ghost fell on the people and they got born again just by the word being preached all right and it wasn't a father son holy ghost or two Soul or ever or some denominational idea it was the word of God and they said that ain't nothing but the truth and God fell down in a heart birthed them and they started on their Journey so every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor I don't it's not my obligation well actually standing where I'm at today it is my obligation to make sure Donnie gets there but it's Donny's obligation to get there amen we can't pull you through this thing remember God's not going to pull you through a tube you got to make a choice and you got to be able to what move with God as he moves we move all right but be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind how many times have I read that but how many times have we have we studied it we're going to go on up when we've talked about talk about virtue knowledge Temperance patience it's not what the world thinks about virtue it's not what the world thinks about knowledge it's not what the world thinks about Temperance and patience and all these things that's what you think it was what was supposed to be done through you all right brotherly kindness oh yeah we love our brother well we'll get to that that's one of the roughest ones it's way up there right before the Capstone it's there for a purpose all right well you love them if they love them love them if they hate you don't just tolerate them that's the difference four when you grow and when you were raising your kids we are as human beings we were born with a selfish nature that's mine play with this toy that's fine as long as I play with this toy I'm good but don't you come over here and take it from me all right we're born with a selfish nature this give it to me it's mine this is mine I especially in laodicea oh my Lord Give Me My Rights I got my rights I was talking brother Chris Long yesterday and he said to tell you hi by the way he's I talked let's talk about this new gender reveal thing or gender thing is going on you know they can choose who they want and choose what they want gender they want he said there's a guy I told bro Chris he said I'm going to a gender reveal party and brother Chris said do you not know what gender you are they ought to do away with those gender reveal parties because according to the world they get to choose when they get here what they are you see how this world's perverted yeah God made a man a man and a woman a woman he made that for a reason hey man that you be transformed by the renewing of your mind because that listen the mind of this world has gone crazy the mind of this world will not think like you the mind of this world will be absolutely contrary to you that's why I said well there's a showdown coming listen there was a long time that Bale and that the prophets of Baal they existed with Jezebel then all of a sudden Elijah's Elijah steps on the scene and there's a different story being told there was a showdown all right but see that didn't bother them because Baal just continued it went on to uh it went on to moloch and all the different ones and all the way up to Jesus's time so it didn't do anything to the people the devil just kept going on and kept changing his mind and doing different things but God never changes his mind so by the renewing of our mind that what that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God the only time the word of God is going to be proven to me and you you can't prove it any other way how you gonna prove it well I'll show you right here I got a quote the world don't care about a quote they care about you amen we care about quotes because it builds our character it builds our faith but the world doesn't care about a quote don't give me a quote give me a life second Peter 1 says Simon Peter a servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have what obtained how many times have we read this but I want you to look at this we have obtained light precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according to his divine power the only way that's why I stress so much about the New Birth the only way you're going to get a divine power that renews your mind and gets you to thinking different is when you get the Holy Ghost and that's not an anointing on your flesh that's the new birth the burning out of what's inside of yours we've been talking about the future home God burns out all that old nature that all that old you is burnt completely out amen and it's the Holy Ghost and Fire that does it we'll talk about that in just a minute according as his divine power has given unto what us all things they're pertaining to life and godliness through the knowledge of him that have called us to glory and virtue whereby are giving unto us exceeding great and precious promises listen before we even get up this statue a perfect man you ought to know you're blessed you ought to know that you get the promises of God you ought to know that you ought to be living above the world Amen that by these you might be what partakers then your partakers of a divine nature after you get born again after you receive this renewing of your mind you might be partakers of the divine nature what's the divine nature it's the statue of perfect man that's why it's so important because listen like I'll read to you in just a little while brother Brown says these these gifts that God give us are a stumbling block if you don't have the virtues he ran up against a crowd of people in the Pentecostal time wave when he was a young guy and there was one would stand up and speak in tongues and the other one would interpret they Shout Scream praise God and brother Branham with his little gift you know he pulled that gift out and he says all right this one's good and this one's committing adultery same congregation amen so what was it was this one had a husband just had it on his Flash right but you have escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust so the first stage has got to be the birth I'm going to read this one more time now that's what the way it is trying to manufacture Christianity you can't do it listen if you're not born again you are manufacturing Christianity at the point we are right now now I know you say well now brother what if I'm Justified or Sanctified you're still not finished yet right you're still you're still not finished you're just foolish virgin material at that point in time everybody with me on that maybe this will be a showdown I want it to be a showdown I don't want us that soft open and say well I I come to church every once in a while and I believe the message and I don't cut my hand or don't do this and don't do that and I'm trying that's fine keep trying but you got to come to a place that you get a birth because that birth is what's going to put you in that first resurrection it's going to put you in the rapture the second birth is not remember the second Resurrection if you get a second Resurrection it's going to be way down the road sometime and that meant you didn't get your birth over on this side all right because remember when we get born again it does renew our mind you know what it does it brings eternity into a Time vessel think about that it brings an eternity it brings a theophany it brings an eternal God that Genesis 1 26 and 27 brings it into this Dimension puts it inside of you and it locks itself in and it can't get out except you show what's inside of you that's what's going to happen we are going to show what's inside of us good or bad right we were discussing up there this weekend about foolish virgin remember the foolish version is not bright never will be bride it never was bride amen but there are virgins they heard the call they wanted oil and they even knew what congregation to go get it at give us of your oil five wise virgins well who's the five wise virgin the bride is it bright out there I don't know I know there's bride in here I know there's Brian in this message I know what brother Brown said now I call you bride not church he separated them Showdown that was a showdown one day and brother Brown said I call you bride I don't call you church anymore so the church goes to the tribulation the bride does not there was a showdown every time there was a showdown in brother round of his life there was a separation amen there was a separation he said I indict this generation thousands left him he come to marriage and divorce and he said go on as you are don't do it again you've been forgiven another separation he starts preaching the seals had never been preached before and the people are sitting there with their heads spinning another separation what it was a showdown it was a showdown on those sales where Satan had been hiding in religion he had been hiding in the message and there was a showdown and that Showdown was when the seals were open that Satan couldn't stand it anymore so he took off he exposed himself he went riding that's what I want to do I want him to be exposed not hide with a showdown Elijah said let God be God you call on yours I'll call on mine that's what we're coming to folks is a separation not manufacture Christianity you can't do it the first thing you've got to do is be born again you've got to be what changed and when you cha or changed you become a new creation now you're getting right now he said now you're getting right he didn't say you're always already completely right remember you're just getting started now you don't have to worry about the feathers he'll take care of itself he's talking about peacock feathers shoved into a Buzzard or a crow when you are born again yes sir like I've always said you take a hog scrub him up put a sailor suit on him or tuxedo rather and turn him out there he goes right to the mud hole and wallows that's what's wrong with me and you that's why we while we see people come in the building they get a good uh maybe a case of justification and sanctification but that nature is going to pop its head up it does not matter what you do the word of God will not you can't hide behind the word of God you can hide behind error but you can't hide behind the pure word of God that's why in the pure word of God's preached the head pops up and you get exposed that's what it is with a hog you look say well it looks pretty well let him go he's going right back to the mud because that's his nature wallowing is his nature you've got to change his nature and look and the rest of it will take care of itself changes nature put a lamb nature in him he'll never go to that Hollow wallow again why what inside of him don't want to go there anymore everybody with me all right now notice you must be born again that is change there's got to be a change folks I want you to realize your change everybody wants to get to the change of the body that's fine that's the culmination but if you don't get changed now you're not going to get changed there you got to get changed from the inside first your body change started on the day you got the Holy Ghost everybody with me on that because even if you have to go by the grave if you're born again you're coming up that body's going to be made Eternal it's going to be glorified and we're going into heaven or into that other dimension you say well brother random I know this certain woman over here why she never did anything wrong she's a good woman or this such a man he's a good man he never does anything you know he doesn't harm anybody that doesn't mean one thing he might make a good neighbor but he isn't a Christian until he's born again I hope that sinks in he isn't a Christian I'm gonna make the well that big enough for you all to see can you see that you see that in the back see they can't see that okay I don't want to be like Bob we have to squint see what's going on I do want to be like Bob I just want to be that way like Bob 's a good man he's got a good heart sometimes I wish they had a softer heart like him but I just made the way I am Jesus said except the man be born again look he can't even what see the kingdom that's why you have divisions now that's why you have false Doctrine now because listen the Holy Ghost is not a false Doctrine it will not tolerate a false Doctrine to a degree now listen you cannot know something for a little while but if you keep digging and you keep plowing and you keep listening you keep studying like Brother Richard uh up in Ohio the doubt of all that silly group in 2015 he said God I've had enough of this false Doctrine or something inside of me is just not ringing right how many have ever done that amen something you know what he done he said God show me the truth in other words you're obligated Lord if I need it truth you're into the story he pulls up brother Dale and he's been listening to him ever since amen they've been back listening now they're listening to the seals they're listening to all the backs uh sermons that we've all we've preached in here and they're really having a good time studying it studying it real good except a man be born again he cannot even see the kingdom that means c means understand you look at anything say I look I just don't see it you mean you don't understand it and it's okay not to understand I told him the story and I know Luis is standing back there looking through looking like a picture back there in the in the window but Luis will tell you brother Luis will tell you when he first came here it was hard for him to sit and listen right he's got his thumb up when you come from one this place over to this place and you listen to some good teaching but you got to stay here you gotta listen you got to grind it out I mean if you want to come here and just have a shout and good time you probably need to go somewhere else we do have them but the teaching it places us I want to be settled I want somebody when I'm that I know when the spirit does fall I know how to act instead of sitting there like this I know how to act the Holy Ghost inside of me knows how to act but I don't want to act up because the devil can act up I don't want the devil to I don't want that to happen to me but I want to be able to understand brother we said I sat there three months four months five months and he said I really didn't understand brother I didn't understand it might have been getting a little bit discouraged but all of a sudden praise God he stayed he endured those who endured to the end shall be saved listen this is not a picnic this is not a cruise ship this is a battleship it's a war everything's a war you walk in that doors of War Satan does not want you to know the word of God he does not want you to live right he definitely don't want you to come to church let's quit yielding to that but it says you mean you don't understand it that's okay not to understand but if you sit there long enough you sit there long enough endure to the endure those two hour hour and a half where you really don't understand a lot that's going on but if you stay there and just keep plowing just keep plowing how many have seen that I mean how many of you have seen two though some come in think they need to have this and that's okay because he gave some Apostles some prophets some families some pastors and some teachers I agree brother Louise will tell you he's standing back there now he did tell me one time that he he didn't know if he had the Holy Ghost but he knows he's got it now by the teaching of the word of God that he got the Holy Ghost by setting under a Ministry not that we had to lay hands on him and slap him and run him up down the aisle brother Dale preached the word of God day in day out day in day out and and and I'm getting like him I'm back grounded and he used to background for an hour and preach for 30 minutes that's fine because we didn't get it all right listen he's not backgrounding for himself I promise you that somebody say Amen okay but now God's got a call for us in this end time not to just stay the way we are not to just do like they did in the middle Church ages just give you life for the gospel had a very short lifespan in your Christianity if you were a Christian in the fourth Church age you said Christian you died the next day all right this is the long this is the longevity this is the part that's going to be the long part that we've got to what March we've got to keep going please keep going don't stop the devil would love for you to stop but therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on into what perfection completion not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and the faith toward God of the doctrine of baptism of laying on of hands and resurrection of the dead of Eternal judgment look and this will we do if God permits and he has permitted by one way there's only one way he has permitted this and it's Ephesians 4 11. and he gave some Apostles some prophets some evangelists and some pastors and teachers what for the perfecting of the Saints look for not for the perfecting of the world not for the perfecting of the Justified you're not perfected until you're born again so this is talking about teachers and preachers and evangelists and pastors and Prophets that are preaching to people that are being perfected the saints that are being perfected I know there's one thing for sure there are babies born now all right yeah man there's babies that are born that's okay but you can't stay babies though the Bible tells us I was reading it the other day where where the Lord tells us that there's a former and a lot of rain and it's going to fall in the same month there's going to be a short work all of you are our babies you have the ability to what come from milk to meat real quick some of us it took a long time right foreign at least you know that for the perfecting of the Saints for the work of the what the work of the ministry for the edifying of what the whole body not just one person the whole body is going to be edified we're all gonna what benefit from this Apostle Prophet Pastor teacher and evangelist way that God has done it to get his word to the people till we all come to the white Unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God unto a perfect man that's the statue right there we're looking at unto what the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ look that we henceforth be no more children toss to and fro carried about with every wind of Doctrine by what by the slight of preachers false preachers by the slight of false preachers and cunning craftiness that Devil he's cunning he's crafty whereby look they lie and wait to deceive Paul was telling us they're going to be there to deceive you Paul said Grievous wolves are coming and are already among you back in the first church age May what grow up and in Him in all things which is the head even crossed from whom the whole body fitly joined together we were talking about this a little bit this weekend everything has to be fit together because look folks if there's one little hole if there's one little tiny hole the devil's going to stick his finger in it he'll disrupt he'll capture that whole thing if you'll let him stick his finger in it so we need to cut it off come packed compact it together what Wednesday night Sunday night prayer meeting prayer service praying in your closet talking about the word of God what is he doing I promise you one thing the devil didn't make you do that and compacted by that which what every joint supplies man what if you didn't have your joints imagine not having a joint in your body you'd be just a statue you wouldn't be able to do this this move your fingers you'd be no have no joy but listen we have joints and we are going he's going to supply every joint sometimes I wish he'd supplies get this arthritis out of all these joints in the old people said hey man I'll tell you what you get that burning sensation and it ain't nice no that's right according to the fact you're working in the measure of what every part deacons elders people in the church service people studying people praying and what maketh increase of the body that's us the body the body's not me the body's all of us right all right unto the what edifying of itself in love you don't edify from the from the world you don't edify from that body that's out there because Satan's got a body too he's got a body out there there's like God's got a body in here hidden life in Christ now watch I'm talking about the high priest entering in congregation followed him up when he went in this great place the veil dropped the holy of holies what a beautiful picture it is today of the consecrated life who once enters into with Christ dead to the things of the world hit away with God and the veils drop down around and all the world shut off now there's the renewing of your mind and then Christianity and religion become a pleasure to every believer a pleasure to every believer listen it's a paradox almost you you say well it is easy to be a believer but you got to struggle like I said before it's a battle it's not a picnic all right but it becomes a pleasure to every believer what in the world could this world give us even longevity of life even if they even if they had a pill to take away arthritis Lord please bring it but the young kids are going what's talking about don't worry I hope you don't get bigger or old enough to realize it I promise you that I hope the Lord took us all to the house amen but becomes a pleasure to every believer today people just get enough religion to make them miserable knowing they ought to do this they're trying to escape hell I hope you're not trying to escape hell tonight well if that's the way I felt about brother I don't know what I'd do so now let's look make sure we understand we're in the dispensation now of the Son of God is that right say Amen seven Church ages in time that's where the Son of God Revelation is going to be made known and then we go then when we get through with the virtues now what are the virtues the virtues or that second stage of sanctification where it's not just clean and set aside for service before you're born again it's cleaned and set aside where Paul says I Die daily because we have trash sister Shepard had trash still inside of her sticks remember old dead sticks we talked preached on Old dead sticks but God's gonna take those dead sticks and make you live he's going to give you life one more time folks there's nothing in the world no drug no nothing there's nothing Eternal down here oh I want to have pleasure in this world for a season Moses could have done that himself but Moses even without the Holy Ghost that's right even without the new birth Moses said I don't want that give me those two million Rebels and 40 years in the wilderness I'll take that over that any day that's what you got to see why but that's a renewing your mind that's why people around us think we're crazy why do you have to do this why do you well we go to church when we need to yeah that's exactly right we don't we don't have to like uh something said well y'all are living the Old Testament and we're living in the New Testament oh Heavenly days the New Testament I thought magnified the Old Testament and Jesus said I didn't come to destroy the law come to magnify and make it honorable he said I say unto you that you don't have to because I had one guy tell me one time tell you how the Lord works if you'll keep your mouth shut every once in a while okay I'm quiet so I had this guy we were talking about the the hair in the dress you know Deuteronomy 29 we're talking about the dress and he said well actually test him and I said well you know Ten Commandments are in the Old Testament too I said but we try we we don't do away with either one we live the way that you're supposed to live I said how many times have you seen we were looking at some old pictures one time from about 1950 backwards they weren't a woman with a dress with a pair of pants on that I saw except maybe somebody in Hollywood or somewhere like that I mean even when the girls went to school the school pictures the women had on dresses man so what's changed a Doctrine change somewhere all right because it what was becoming of the woman to wear her clothes and becoming of a man to where his he said well now if you're going to live the Old Testament he said what are you going to do about somebody commits adultery are you gonna are you gonna take it take them out and stone them you know because that's what they did in the Old Testament they physically did it they physically killed people back then but oh thank God we got a Holy Ghost and it brought back to my memory Jesus was standing there one day and he said I say unto you he said if you have all against your brother and you in other words you speak against him you've already killed him see so that's the stoning part he magnified it he magnified Jesus stood there and didn't say now don't Stone them no you're stoning them with your mouth now you're not having to Stone them with and remember brother random even comes up and tells us he says look he said You Killed the influence of a man you've killed the person you've killed you've killed the individual without having to Stone him with stones you kill him by the influence of your mouth and now what that magnified the Old Testament listen we have the old and new both together we know that but the world they look at us and they think we live the old what they don't know is it took the New Testament and the Old Testament to make you and I born again we didn't get born again just because of the New Testament it talks about it all through the Old Testament come on people all the way back from Genesis and Abraham's journey I was listening brother Brown just a little while ago he said to Abraham that was the whole journey of a Christian was Abraham in the Old Testament all the way down we come all the way through those old prophets and different ones they what they were given what the Bible says for our example amen so that's why we we what our mind has been renewed our mind's been renewed to think those thoughts not think the thoughts I was watching uh listening to brother random we were coming home day before yesterday and he was talking about that tax case somebody was you know they were beating him on something he said he said if you'll just stay still long enough he said got to give you what to say and he just gave him exactly what they're saying the man said oh I'm sorry brother Brandon we won't do that anymore we won't you know get on to you for that so maybe sometimes we need to just listen instead of trying to and it's always it's a it's a what do they call it the fight or flight if somebody says something to you go hey man come on somebody Oh I thought you was disagreeing with me hey man we want to what snap back but if we just wait just a minute the Bible tells us he'll tell us what to say and you know what you won't even have to think about what you're going to say you'll say it if you'll just stay calm what renewing of your mind your own nature wants to get to not have brotherly kindness and you want to actually Stone the guy or sister with your words so I said we're going to be I I just pray in a year we're all different we all think different act different if we're here another year I want us to act different think different know the leading of the Lord and not have to ask why are we doing that but that what happened in the first three Church ages brother Brown said that one little nod from God Paul look at Paul now Paul had brotherly kindness you know why there was a woman followed him and there was a man followed him and then he talks about this other sorcerer and all that they hit people around him all the time and he let that woman and finally somebody said hey how long are you gonna let that woman do that and finally he had enough and he turned around and spoke to her and spoke to the people what he waited on the Lord to get that nod from God just like brother Branham did with that guy that was going to kill him and all the different things you know he kept calm power and control so that's what we're looking at when we go through virtue and all his temper's patience I want us to what I read the scripture how to what possess possess means to control when you're possessed of something you're controlled of it right amen there are some people that um that are possessed of football and different things and man they just go to the extreme why can't we go to the extreme for something that's eternal hey you don't have to pay 150 to get into these seats just saying but we've come to all this and we want to see that that sanctification the second stage of sanctification is what it's knocking the the the faults out putting that virtue into where that virtue can come out to where that knowledge and it's really Holy Ghost knowledge not your own knowledge man has used their own knowledge and brought what Creed's denominations it has brought death to the church by their own knowledge they've used their own knowledge by their own words by their own Jesus told them said I read it a long time ago where he says you've made what the word of God of no effect because of your tradition but what is a tradition it's a knowledge of well we did this and we did that we did this we did that we're Moses's children we got Moses's quote book we got all five of the the Torah right we've got 1100 sermons we have 1100 different Doctrine out of those 1100 sermons we don't but it is in the message amen but there's going to be one truth and there's always just one truth he said I am the way the truth and the life and that's what brother uh Richard was was praying and in other words he was talking to us the other day and he said Lord he said you told me that you would lead me and guide me into all all truth not just part truth all truth and he's held on to that for all these years I just hope we can hang on amen this is a crock pot not a microwave yeah but I'm hungry I want to put a stick back away no give me a crock pot because I want that sanctification because watch before we let me I'm trying to back up a minute before we before we get through with this statue of perfect man remember there's going to be brother Brown said there's going to be a holy spirit that what in other words melts down through this and if there's any cracks that starts filling them in because Steve remember there's still going to be little things that we got to get rid of this is not a like water filling up and we're going to try to get all this right here but now we can't get no knowledge until we get this right here no these lines are just what they're just lines to show the difference it's not lines to show because you take virtue and you still got to have virtue flowing through all this brother around calls it flowing all this knowledge flowing but you got to start here for a foundation and then get virtue then knowledge and they're exactly the way they're supposed to be and we'll see that when we get started if that's all right when we get started on the virtues because virtue is what virtue is not being a virgin it's being virtuous it's where you go and you if you get in trouble with with if you get in trouble with the Lord you don't go to the corner convenience store guy and ask him to pray for you you call Brother Dale you call Brother Bob call brother Aaron because you have what confidence that they're full of virtue now that got the corner convenience store is full of something but it ain't the virtue that you need amen listen you're either full of God or the devil I'm there's no way in between folks I don't know why we've got this denominational idea that we're all going to go to heaven because we're good people and the hell's not here anymore we just all in a message and we're all going come on big deception folks who was it yesterday or what no it was this weekend somebody I can't remember who it was in Ohio said it scared them to read anointed ones at the end time we were talking to somebody I said it scared me don't read annoying once at the end time it don't scare you too detect if it were possible so close Judas and Jesus right there together nobody knew it but the son of man that's why we got to get to that son of man Revelation and then there's a real show down then brother Brown calls it a Mount Zion Showdown right it's not about Transfiguration it's not a Mount Carmel that was a separation but when you get to Mount Zion what is Mount Zion that's Jerusalem sitting on a hill that's our possession it separates Matthew 10 says he that loveth father and mother more than me is not worthy of me he that loveth son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me and he that taketh not his cross we were talking about this remember there are some that deny the cross or hate the cross some that come to the cross and some that bear the cross now you and I when we start up this statue of perfect man we're going to be carrying your cross you're going to be carrying your cross all right he that taketh not his cross and followeth after me is not worthy of me he that findeth his life shall lose it he that loses his life for my sake she'll find it Luke 9 verse 23 and he said unto them all if any man will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross daily pick that beam up put it on your shoulders you saw the world to laugh at me praise God praise God I want the world and I'm different not just take it because daily but follow me not just take it up but follow him and listen there's a lot of people took up a cross and went to a father-son Holy Ghost right right a two Soul Doctrine of this Doctrine can't get Daniel 70 weeks right can't get this right but there's one truth there's one cross and it's his that you have to bear you have to bear your cross but we have to follow him and who is he in the beginning was the word where the garden where it was God he's the word of God he was the walking word what are me and you we're the walking word for whosoever will save his life shall lose it oh I don't know I I don't know if I want to raise my hands or not somebody might say something I hope they do I hope they do I hope they say those people are crazy Paul said in a way it's called heresy craziness do I serve God hey two weeks ago if you'd have brought two or three four five or six denominational people in here they would have thought was crazy amen and some of you sat there like a bump on the pickle what's worth what's a bump on a pickle worth but whosoever will ever will fly from my sake the same shall save it First Corinthians 15 says I protest by your rejoicing which I have in Christ Jesus our lord I Die daily there's something that you're confronting every day you brought something that you got to make a choice or God's going to speak to you about something and you're either going to take it or deny it every day every day of your life they don't care even if you're on vacation even you know if you're off somewhere hunting or something bro Dale's got some powerful sermons while he's up in a tree amen so he's talking to God talking to him oh that's dummies working around to get all of his attention I said all of us dummies what are we though we're a chosen generation a royal priesthood a holy nation A peculiar people thank God that you should show forth what the Praises of him who has called you out of Darkness Into His Marvelous Light which in times past look we're not a people you weren't a child of God when you were doing the things you did in the world you were potentially there you were by for knowledge you were there yes but in your Humanity you were lost doomed and on your way to hell which in times past you are not a people but are now the people of God which had not look obtained Mercy but now have obtained Mercy dearly beloved I just just beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstained from freshly lust which war against your soul what that second realm memory reason conscious effects and Imagination that's what the lustfulness is that's where the pride of life and that's where all that junk that happens in your mind because remember you don't renew the mind of the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost don't need to be renewed it's the Holy Ghost it's Eternal it's sitting there wanting to fire on all eight cylinders and you're only giving it a of gas that's it and it fires off and goes no we want to give it a big tube full of gas we want to give it why they call the uh what you call a turbo we want to give it a turbo boost we want to add all we can in there having your conversation honest among the Gentiles whereas they speak against you is the evildoers talking about the world now that made by your good works which they shall what look and see glorify God in the day of visitation listen today is our day of visitation we were visited by a messenger and we're supposed to be the final voice to the final age of that messenger so we have been visited we have had our day of visitation submit yourself to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake in other words do right to the people out there you can't listen you can't be high and mighty and she said well I'll just separate myself and remember brother I'm got in trouble with God for that he said God I just want to go up in a cave have long hair and a beard and just run out and say thus saith the Lord and turn around and run back in God told him said no I didn't bring you to do that I brought you to live among these people because they're your people and you're supposed to teach them not just run out there and condemn them every few minutes you got Grace involved with this thing thank God laughs aren't the governors as unto them they're sent for the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them to do well I want you to watch now this is where I got my thought about separation or Showdown for look for so is the will of God now here is the will of God you want to know what the will of God is we know it's the word of God all right so the word of God tells us that with well-doing you may put to silence how many of you want to silence the devil how many of you want to silence that jerk in your life amen I'm tired of that thing ringing loud in my ear you can't do this you can't do that you ain't worthy of this and remember what you did remember what you didn't do but let's burn this scripture in your mind for so is the will of God that with well-doing yes yes you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish man as a church as an individual the only way to silence a Critic is to live the word of God you oh you say well now wait a minute I can get me 52 quotes and if I can get 52 and this one only gets 42 I won that ain't it right right that ain't it quotes will kill you if it's not what filter to a life but we want to put the silence the ignorance of foolish men guess what happened on Mount Carmel hey folks Elijah literally silenced those prophets of Baal I always wondered how one man could take 400 prophets down to the brook Kidron which is little bitty Brook ain't very much big and he killed them all he killed him he didn't just talk to him he killed him well what he done was is the congregation that was around him started believing what Elijah said they saw the fire they saw what happened to the 400 prophets it cut theirself and jumped all over the place and shouted in tongues and all Elijah stand over there going to talk a little louder maybe your God's on vacation uh maybe he's went on a journey and he ain't got but he can't hear what you're saying he was taunting them why he knew who he was he knew where he stood and he knew that God was going to fulfill his promise because he told Elijah Elijah looked up and said God at your word I'm going to do this fire came down and what it Vindicated who Elijah was but he totally silenced those 400 prophets of Baal everybody with me so we're going to try to now as a church as individuals as people that go to Spoken Word Church we're going to silence the ignorance of foolish men how are you going to do it let's read little babies gotta start somewhere I got one back there just learning to walk now that had to be Joseph because that's 1953 I would assume because he said he'd Boop whatever Boop means and fall down get back up and he thought he was doing something great I was that way one day but now I'm a man I put away childish things now we got to come to full Doctrine I like good old shouting meetings where we clap our hands or shout have a good time have great powerful services and things dance on the bubble as it were but wait then when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing everybody understand what he's saying it's kind of hard to follow him but what he's saying is he said I love all this but when he comes to The Showdown you better know where you're standing it's not all that dancing and all that that's good that's what that's emotion that's that's feeling that comes what after we knew what the doctrine was but wait then when The Showdown time comes you don't know where you're standing let's get back and find out let's find out what's making us do that all right find out what's making us do that I found out what was making us do that two weeks ago it was the Holy Ghost finally somebody said hey use me let's find out what's making us do that let's get back to the foundation see where we're at hmm speak to the Rock 1960. we'll have a meeting like this morning we were having a meeting there in the Holy Ghost falling into place to people screaming shouting praising the Lord then someone come up and said pray for me brother Brandon I laid hands on him and prayed for him I said now go and believe now look now here's what it is it's easy to feel the power of God to see it when you believe but then when it comes to The Showdown are you able to possess the things that you profess to have remember brother Brown said it don't matter how high you jump said when you get down can you walk what you jump for all right are you able to possess the things that you profess to have because it's going to be a showdown that to me that's what brother I'm saying let out what's inside of you it's going to come out you can hold it all you want to but it's going to blow the top of your head off one of these days good or bad that's the thing brother we've got to get it we've got to take it it's ours but you'll fight for every inch Fellowship 1962. we're all tried every Christian every son every child that comes to God is Tried by the word to see if you'll be loyal to it who's going to try you God's going to try you he's going to let the devil loose on you don't kill him don't touch your soul but you can have his flesh job amen that's what he said so you can't kill him that's my job but you do whatever you need to do I'm gonna prove who he is that's what's going to happen now every child that comes to God is Tried by the word see if you'll be loyal to it when The Showdown come what decision are you going to make that's it and he that cannot stand chastisement but goes on with the world he's an illegitimate child a bastard and not a son and daughter of God certainly not now but the spiritual minded catches the word look lines up with it and the spirit comes down under the shed blood and takes that person take me take me if God don't take you the devil will that was a near Kinsman remember Ruth was probably worried there for a little while here come Boaz and said oh I'll redeem you Ruth but I gotta go talk to one more because there's one near Kinsman than I am to you or to Naomi right there's one one one I got to go talk to and if he does it then I gotta give it to him and remember that was a devil in type your flesh he's got a mark on you because you were born in sand shaping and iniquity you came here lost and he has dibs on this flesh part of you but when Boaz thank God what a mighty God we serve bull acid all right you're going to redeem it and said yeah we're damn it and Boaz says no you're gonna get the mole bonus too you're going to get the Gentile because remember it wasn't Ruth it was redeemed it was Naomi Naomi was the Jew she was the old was married in oh praise God Ruth and married into the family to the Gentile more about us get brother Brown said we know how moabs apps to playing that read your Bible but that man boy I said hey if you take Naomi you gotta take Ruth and the devil's like I don't think I want that Gentile bride I don't want her I don't even like her I don't want anything to do with her he said you can do it boy I said okay I got you I'm gonna kick my shoe off and I'm gonna go to Earth I'm gonna kick my shoe off I'm gonna kick my eternal being off for a little while and I'm gonna go down in human flesh and I'm gonna buy them back and I'm gonna buy them all back I'm gonna take Gentiles and Jews back devil you don't have anything to do with this anymore because you have what forfeited you're right thank God when we can put the devil in his place when God through us can put the devil in his place let me put it that way we're no match for the devil but God inside of us is it was a paradox when the Hebrew children were thrown in the fire furnace and I want you to realize this this is something that you probably have never thought of unless you've read this this paradox we look at the attitude of that this don't wait a minute some of y'all are reading that don't read that I saw your eyes looking over there starting to read it show these three Hebrew chip you know the story behind them they said we're not going to bow to this image and Nebuchadnezzar said okay well then I've got to do what I got to do I've done said if you don't bow down you're going to go get put into the fiery furnace all right now when God puts me and you in the same position what do we do we start crying and screaming and they have to drag us to the furnace come on somebody them three Hebrew children said come on you know what they got a revelation of that what was binding them come on what was binding then was the only thing that was going to be burnt off if you look at it that way your trials will so now let's read the quote all right you ready it was a paradox when the three Hebrew children were thrown into the fire furnace how the three men could walk it walk into a furnace so hot that the intense heat even kill the men that were pushing them in and yet they stayed in that only delivered them that's the only thing it did it delivered them from the bonds that they were bound with your trial will deliver you from the barns that you've been bound with if you'll let it so you got to go into fiery furnace you can't turn and go the other direction sometimes in our lives that Paradox repeats sometimes you're brought to a showdown where you have to make a decision adventurous you're going to make a decision God's going to make you make a decision amen this word is going to make you make a decision one way or the other you have to stand on that decision like they did and it all works together for the good what did it do it never hurt them it loosed them oh that's gonna I mean people stand around them the other congregation standing around going man they gonna get just I mean they're going to be like fried chicken they're going to get burnt up burnt to a crisp seven times hotter I bet that thing was just glowing you don't have something when you burn how it just glows yeah we used to burn stuff over June's dad's house and he had the thing about this house and we get that thing so red hot until you could stick up you could stick a dry stick on the outside of it and it would start flaming that's how but they they heated that seven times hot so guess what in the seventh Church age seven times hotter it's going to be seven times hot on us but guess what when they throw us in the fire furnace it's gonna Deliver Us if you let it deliver you and lose them sometimes we're caught in that position first thing we've got just like the man drowning the river you got to get the man out of the river you got to get the man out of the river before you get the river out of him and that's sometimes what a man has to do is come out make it stand get the thing out hello church let it out and get him out of the things so he can get the thing out of him oh what a whoa let me read that one more time what did he do it never heard of me loosed them think of that situation how you turn that thing around job probably thought he was in bad shape he lost everything he had no kids he was like Bill Gates at one time now he's like wait now sitting on an ass sheet probably sitting on what his possessions that he used to have and there were ashes under his rear end and he got boils on his scraping the balls off of his skin turns around and looks and there's there's seven crosses out there in the field for his kids that had died all his animals were gone they had repossessed his car but he was in the will of God from the beginning because he took it and he stood up one day and he said I know from all this there's something good got to come my redeemer is going to have to come and bring me out of this he had when he started everybody with me had twice what he had when he started now you and I need to do the same thing when we go through a trial when we get through that trial and it loses you you ought to be twice as happy you ought to be twice as able to praise God twice as able to testify sister Freda blast is able to do things like that and that's sometimes what a man has to do is come and make it stand get the thing out get him out of the thing so the get the thing out of him that's what preaching will do for you now watch we'll read this and then we'll stop right here we'll get the rest of it Sunday if children than heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ there so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time is not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be what revealed in US unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign job had to suffer to reign Jesus Christ had to suffer to reign everybody all the Old Testament prop Moses Moses had to suffer to reign you say David was one of the greatest Kings yeah but he suffered remember he had the affair with Bathsheba had his best friend killed and God said that baby's not going to live because of what you did so God said your first child's not going to live he carried that with him the whole time the whole time he carried that with him all down through the time there's been a flaw I think brother Dale preached that one time years ago about all the flaws of the people in the new test Old Testament and New Testament Paul listen Paul took a church like this right here and put him in prison and made them blasphemed so they would go and be hung or be killed by lions or whatever they were doing back then he caused that he said causing them to blaspheme don't you think I stuck in his crawl the whole time but he took God to knock him off of a horse blind his eyes so he couldn't see give him a little light Affliction in his whole life to where he could remember what he had done remember he asked the Lord to take it away and the Lord said my grace is sufficient you're not going to die not with that they're going to cut your head off one day but you're not gonna die with whatever that was same way with the different ones same way with me and you you have to suffer to rain let's stand to our feet the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering character is a victory not a gift listen a victory not a gift see there's Gifts of healings there's gift of wisdom there's gift of faith there's gift of speaking in tongues it's not talking about that talk about your character because remember like I said before you speak in tongues and be a devil amen but you can't have the character of Jesus Christ and it be a victory and be the devil I promise you that not a gift a man without character can't reign you say well rain what do you mean rain listen you gotta Reign Over Yourself [Music] who's your worst enemy your neighbor oh who a oh this guy yeah you ain't kidding y'all all point up this way a man without character can't Reign what rain over his own position because power apart from character listen there's power in these in these virtues there's holy ghost power in these virtues and he's not going to give them to you if you're still a baby because you'll use them wrong power apart from character is satanic musicians come but Power with character is fit to rule rule what rule over every situation in your life I told you before the Holy Ghost does not take away your problems it helps you deal with them it helps you do what show that it loses you instead of binds you we think our problems bind us no if you'll take it right your problems lose you put me in the furnace Lord if I'm bound something if something's binding me put me in the furnace and remember when they walked out of that though they didn't even smell like smoke God was so clean to you folks if you'll let him go to clean you so much he'll clean the very clothes you got on if you got on clean clothes and I ain't talking about clean worldly clean I'm talking about dress the way you're supposed to act the way we're supposed to you clothe yourself the right way then God is obligated to start on you with your character but Power with characters fit to rule and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same look on the same basis that he overcame and has sat down in his father's Throne then we have to overcome to sit with him the little temporary sufferings we go through now is not worthy to be compared to the tremendous Glory that we will be revealed in us when he comes oh what Treasures are laid up for those who are willing to enter into his kingdom through much tribulation what does tribulation work patience we'll read that when we get up to there to patients but think on these things think about God coming on Earth in a body of Flesh he walked through life and he was Mr Perfect but the world didn't call him that the world called him belzebub you know why because he was so far off of their Doctrine of what they thought the Messiah was going to be come on people they read the same quotes over and over and over Moses said up at this one and so did Zachariah brother Brown said he never came in he came the same way the word told him and they could read and read it and read it and read it that one was going to come virgin born and one was going to come to do this one was going to come to that what did they do they took the word that they had and misinterpreted it that's what our problem is misinterpreted theology is what got us in the shape we're in now not even not say us but yeah us we have little things little foxes that spoil the mind Little Things that we get upset about or or we can't don't handle them we have to what do it over listen you know what you do you know what you're doing you're actually tying yourself back up and you got to go back in that furnace again hey man come on somebody you tie yourself back up and you go one more time right let's burn those things off and get them out of our life creating me a clean heart let's think whatever you got let's say God bless you we love you with love of the Lord [Music] there are people almost everywhere whose hearts are all a flame when the finally fell at Pentecost that Clinton made them clean it is burning now within my heart glory to his name I'm so glad I'm one of them one of the one of them you believe that I'm so glad that I can't say I'm one of them one of them I'm one of them I'm so glad that I can say I'm one of them though these people may not learn to be nor boast on worldly thing they have all received Pentecost because we're going that statue of perfect man and folks this might be the last time we get up it that we're going to be able to teach it that was a day when God shut the ark and said nobody else is going in nobody else is getting out one of them you read the anointing ones at the end time you're gonna preach to the totally lost and there's nothing you can do about it and nothing they can do about it one of them I'm so glad that I can't say I'm one of them

couples then we need to do that some other time I'm talking about questions for from the youth and from the single people everybody with me on that amen I mean you might have a marriage and divorce question or something like that I at this moment we'll let brother Dale we'll talk about it if you do have a question please let us know don't want to exclude anybody but I want to include the young people because they've always brought him brother by Brother Louise how many good questions that we had from the youth when we were doing that we had some questions that were just unbelievable so I want you to write your questions down give them to me or either if you want to just slip them in there on the desk somewhere or if you want to put them in that box in the back back there that says what's it say titling and offering you can slip them inside there if you want to do it where nobody will know who's asking the question that'll be fine but we need to answer the questions for the Youth let the youth have a have a uh a place in the church they are our church amen there are ones that are that are gonna if we time goes on we got some good ones though we got some good ones they're

dear Lord thank you for the day you give us we pray now that you'll be with us on our journey home we pray that what we've said Lord will sink deep in our heart they will know that that man is drowning we got to get him out of the water first before we can get the water out of them Lord we've got to realize that we're drowning that's what the prophet was meant if we got to realize we were drowning and somebody's going to help us out but we got to get that water out of our lungs we got to get that scent out of our life and all the things that we've done that what the Bible says so easily beset us so easily beset us that what we may run this race with patience looking toward the author and finisher of our faith father forgive us the Lord of our sins if we said anything wrong against you we pray that you would help us Lord be with us now Lord as we come to Bible study at on Saturday night Lord that you'll be with us thank you for bringing the brothers home from the um
