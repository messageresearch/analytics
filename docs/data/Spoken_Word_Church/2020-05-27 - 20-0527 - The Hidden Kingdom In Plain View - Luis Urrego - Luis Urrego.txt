========================================

I want to see I want to say [Music] pour out your power as we sing holy holy holy I [Music] left [Music] shiny [Music] oh holy hell [Music] want to see a man I hope you're here did you see him to this afternoon it's good to be in the house of the Lord are you happy to meet the house of God I trust that you are appreciate you all praying for us while we were away this this past Sunday we were in Beaufort South Carolina administering their brother Samuel now head US church a little Spanish church there not far from brother Jason Watkins church and it's just a little group he's been there a few years it's got a small group but it's a growing group and so he invited me to come out there and we had some good fellowship brother Samuel sends his greetings to brother Samuel and brother Wade and he knows of you of both of you but just about I've invited him to come to the youth meeting because he's got some youth there at the church so Lord will and maybe he'll be here in July if we if we have it so so but we had a good time and also got to spend a little bit of time with brother Jason DeMars down there he he knew I was in the area so he we uh he invited me and we went over to his house had some fellowship and talked about a couple of projects maybe that he needs some help in in the Spanish area on the Spanish side so so we uh we had a good time really really wonderful brother to uh to to fellowship with so really had a good time I appreciate all of your prayers I want I want you all to be seated for just a moment I wanted to just give just right before we go to the word just give about five minutes just a quick report a little mission report on on the on what's going on in Honduras right now because if you don't know we there's a brother that we support there on a monthly basis in Honduras brother Eric and he's a pastor there and is if you remember he was the one that that the church helped to buy him some brand new tires for the truck that he he travels back and forth about an hour and 20 minutes back from from his house to church to be able to minister to the little church that God gave him and so unfortunately he he has not been able to go to the church to actually minister at the church because of the lockdowns that they have in in in Honduras the city where he lives they cannot even go out out of a certain radius and so since the church is in the church is located in another municipality they have not been able he's only been been being able to visit it like once every 15 days so the church there they have people there in that municipality where the church is located there's brothers that are ministering at the church but brother eric has not been at the church and they don't have any resources as far as being able to stream in and things like that because it's let me tell you this area is is in the woods pretty much where the church is and it's very remote so and most of the individuals that live and go to the - - brother Eric's church there are older older people so they're not in tune with technology and things like that so so he is he's just having to do whatever he can but right before all the pandemic all this stuff happened with the coronavirus there was a church there in the city where he lives that a couple of years ago when I was there last time in Honduras the pastor was there was unfortunate events that took place regarding the pastor so he had to step down and when he stepped down the church had about I'd say maybe 80 people in the church when he stepped down he took he took all the of the pulpit the the the chairs everything from the church and left the people without anything and so and and so the church was pretty much you know kind of split so some of the people from the church some of the leadership that was still left there at the church asked brother Eric if he could come and work with them and maybe help them so being that the church is located in the area where he lives he's been able to work with these people more often so it's kind of strange how that worked out and he knew of the group and I even met some of the people from the group when I was there last time but he's been working with them full-time and let me tell you brother eric is a hard-working brother be as young as he is trying to hold two jobs and as a matter of fact one of the jobs he's gonna give it up mainly because he wants to just come by faith just fully dedicate himself more to the ministry that's a big leap of faith especially in a country like Honduras and so so he's having to work there quite often working on the radio as well and he that's where he had asked me if I could help send sermons went on a weekly basis there on the radio and it just the radio spreads out a big area there in that city named tal anga and it goes out quite a few miles so on a day on a weekly basis I've been preaching at the house and so what and so what I what I do I've been preaching I'd say maybe for the last - two months - or two and a half months and but the thing is is that it's gone out to a lot of people because not just believers listening to this radio station it's it's unbelievers out and don't you know that there are listening to it as well and so it's been a blessing and a lot of work to be done there's a lot there's people that this church now by the help that the brother eric is is given to the church there the church is now getting back to its feet again they haven't been they haven't declared any any pastor yet so that's something to be praying about but the church is getting back to his feet some young people are going back to the church there's people there wanting to get baptized so they're trying to leave kind of their past behind you know and just trying to move on with the word so you all pray for that little work there for that church now he says that there's about 70 people now so it's a it's a good sized group and there's lots of work to be done so every time he talks to me about that stuff I just want to go so I want to go so bad but you know God has his people that there and uh at least we everybody preach to him I know through the radio so but you all pray for brother Eric and he sends his greetings to each one of you thanking you once again brother Dale by the way at each one of you for for the support on a monthly basis as well all right so let's stand to our feet again and we're gonna go to the Word of God we're gonna read in Matthew chapter 6 verses 9 through 13 Matthew 6 verses 9 through 13 this is a very familiar scripture to all of us the Bible says here after this manner therefore pray pray ye Jesus speaking our Father which thou art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen amen so this this evening I want to speak on the on the topic the hidden I forgot I forgot the title now but the hidden kingdom the hidden kingdom in plain view and this is a preach this a couple of years ago and I just felt led to revisit this again especially for some of the newer ones that are coming in and also some of the the young people that have that are coming in and trying to serve the Lord maybe just be something that could help them so hey the word of god is the word of God sometimes we just forget things and and I just felt so pressed to to speak about this so let's just bow our heads our gracious Lord Jesus we thank you Father God once again for your love mercy and grace father and we just pray now that you bless your word Lord as it goes forth father garden are you just anointed Lord anoint my lips Lord that I may say father God what your people need to hear and what will glorify you may you Heavenly Father just anoint the ears and let them hear father God reveal to them your word Lord and the importance father god of of the kingdom of God being within us Lord Jesus - so father God that we can manifest it father God on the outside Lord Jesus to a dying world Lord who needs to see Christ in action father Lord we love you we thank you we commit this time into your hands now in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen god bless you saying so you may be seated amen so we're gonna try to go through this as quick as we possibly can I last last time when I had a I had a prayer a PowerPoint I had a lot of content there and so what I did is I tried to condense it as much as I possibly could and and there was still a lot of content so so you just pray for me you bear with me and and and and and just just pray that God would that you get something from the Word of God this evening hey man I believe this is very important praise the Lord all the Word of God is very important so amen so if the brothers could start with uh with the first slide amen amen now let's look at the phrase of the King the kingdom of God so we see that that phrase is mentioned many times throughout the Bible and the phrase the kingdom of God started to be used at the time with John the Baptist coming that's when you started noticing that that phrase was was being used and it the phrase is used commonly between tert Angley with the phrase is the Kingdom of Heaven or the kingdom and so whenever you see those phrases in the Bible it all means the kingdom of God and it's not anything different it's it's the kingdom amen praise God let's go to the next slide now in Matthew you these are the scriptures in Matthew three one two two and those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Judea and saying repent ye for the kingdom of heaven is at hand Matthew 4:17 from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the kingdom of heaven is and you have to think about it that way because as we're gonna see here in just a moment that the kingdom of God is God amen is him a man so here's the kingdom of God manifested physically when Jesus was here on earth amen praise God but that wasn't enough in God's plan you see God's plan needed to be go go further than that it wasn't just enough to have the kingdom of God standing in flesh just in the body of Jesus Christ and just in one man do you see what I'm saying it had to also manifest itself in a manner many member body that was the fullness of God's plan that's what God wanted amen that was the thought he had from the beginning amen so it's so easy to get caught up with with all Jesus on the cross and and and Jesus Jesus Jesus Jesus which is good we thank God for what he did for us but now there's brother Graham said that there's a part that he's done that he didn't fulfill that we need to fulfill in this hour that's a direct quote from brother Branham you see because let me tell you what Saints and you think about this nobody in this hour has been a nobody in this day has been available fulfill what what Paul talked about there in Thessalonians nobody not even brother Brandon to be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye that's gonna be somebody in this day that that word still needs to be fulfilled it was written but it still needs to be fulfilled Jesus didn't fulfill that neither did brother Brandon now somebody's got to fulfill it I say it's just you and me amen praise God let's go to the next slide so this is what Kingdom meaning of a kingdom is a kingdom or territory it's all used in the New Testament to refer the rule of the Messiah but I like this here says a royal power kingship Dominion rule not to be confused with an actual kingdom not to be confused with actual Kingdom but rather the right or authority to rule over a kingdom praise the Lord when you get the Holy Ghost in your life that gives you the rule amen over that kingdom praise God now or that kingdom gives you power which we will talk about in just a moment gives you power to rule over your worst enemy and who is your worst enemy it's yourself that's your worst enemy brother Dale is not my worst enemy the president is not my worst enemy there's no way that you know the word the Hitler was not even not worst enemy the devil is not even my worst enemy it's myself I've got to be able to put myself down amen that he could take over and that he can rule properly because when you're in the way he can't he can't be in the way when you could you get you're in the way a man next slide I appreciate the brothers in the back and then now let's look at this that Jesus did not establish a physical Kingdom when he was here on earth that was not his purpose his purpose was not to come and and and give the Jews what they wanted what they wanted was a somebody to come down and stump out the Roman rule that they had in that day wanted to just completely take him out and and some and and just come down at the corridors where kfs was the high priest and just ruled and they now at a later point those things will happen there will be a physical Kingdom to be established but it's got to start lowly meek humble first it's got to start something like it doesn't even look like it's the kingdom that's how God wants to start the kingdom amen then those men in John chapter 6 verse 14 then those men when they had seen the miracle that Jesus did said this is of a truth that prophet that should come into the world when Jesus therefore perceived that they would come and take him by force to make him a king he departed again into a mountain himself alone they were the Jews were trying to make him a king by force because they saw potential in him they saw miracles they saw signs they saw things and these are these is the only man that could take out these Romans but he that's not what he had come for he went out on by himself what humility what power amen nextslide so and this for the in Luke it says for the Son of man has come to seek and to save that which was lost and as they heard these things he added in spake a parable because he was nigh to Jerusalem and became and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately appear they were seeking for a physical kingdom that's what they wanted next slide and even the disciples in Acts after Jesus resurrection were still seeking a physical Kingdom thinking that something was was physical about what was going on look what look what they asked him here in Acts chapter 1 when they therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord will doubt at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel now watch what Jesus says and he said unto them this is Jesus it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father hath put in his own power but look he turns it back to what's really important and to what they don't recognize that that's what he was trying to preach to them for three-and-a-half years to come to this but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you now watch how this kingdom is going to be spread out and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth but first they had to receive the power without the power a man they were that kingdom could not be established in the hearts of man again it was established in Jesus he was the fullness of the Godhead bodily but the kingdom needed to also now be transferred to you and I Amen that life of Jesus needed to be transferred to you and I therefore we cannot rule and overcome in this kingdom of God trying to establish next slide now let's look at this here Jesus standing before Pilate because this is something very interesting we read in John chapter 18 jesus answered my kingdom this is the pilots talking to Jesus and asking him are you a king of the Jews and and he asked him do you say that of your own or did somebody just tell you in other words is this Britain revealed to you or did somebody just tell you so jesus answered an incest to him my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight that I should not be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence so Jesus was very very loyal to the kingdom Jesus body yeah you see he was loyal to because he saw he knew what was coming so he wasn't going to bow his that's the reason why he didn't bow his head his knees to Satan when Satan was trying to tempt him see if he would have given up and turned those breath those stones into bread he would have been given into what and it would have been giving up the kingdom but he knew that that kingdom needed to stay in place amen Pilate therefore said unto Him art thou king then jesus answered thou sayest that I'm a king to this and was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth or that Kingdom I put in parentheses here with my voice when you are of that Kingdom amen you're gonna hear that voice amen there's no other way if that word has been planted in you amen you're going to hear that voice there is no other way you're going to hear from the kingdom so to a true child and daughter of God you're you're hearing from that kingdom every time the word goes forth every time you read the word every time you even go into prayer you're hearing from the kingdom to draw closer come closer amen they almost reminds me of the pilgrims progress remember read read that as he was traveling in his way and he was walking in his way he was getting closer to the kingdom closer to the kingdom and the only way that you're gonna grow in life and and draw closer and closer that this kingdom can manifest in its fullness through your life is for you to be in the word there's no other way no other way praise God next Luke chapter 17 the kingdom of God is not seen physically see it's very easy for us as human beings just as it was for the Jews to seek for physical things to feel something all the time it's always been that way that if I don't feel it or if I don't see it or if I don't smell it or hear it must not be real but God is trying to get us to get out of that mindset Saints that we don't have to physically feel it physically see it physically here amen if we could just believe what God said about you and I and just step into that amen by faith you will see that that Kingdom amen will conspire through your life and and it's in a way that we don't we can't explain but that's what God wants us wants to do amen so look what he says here in Luke and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come see the Pharisees were even asking them the same thing when is the kingdom of God see they were carnal he answered them and said the kingdom of God comes not with come not with observation in other words the kingdom of God is not something that you see the kingdom of God is not something that you can observe or study there is a you study the kingdom yes as a believer but there's not something that a scientist could grab and just break it down and study it look it under a microscope now the kingdom of God is not that way neither shall they say lo here or lo there there's the kingdom or or there's the kingdom and in such and such a place or out west or up north now for behold the kingdom of God is within you that's the reason saying that you cannot explain amen and we're looking at here in just a moment there you cannot explain the new birth in reality you really can't you really the only you can't explain it you just know that it's there you just know that you experience something amen because the kingdom of God is something that you cannot see amen next look what brother Brown says here now I put the COG is not material but within years the COG is the kingdom of God and the smyrna in church age the lair to scene age is one of vast wealth where often the criterion a spirituality is an abundance of earthly Goods my how rich the churches and goods but how poor in spirit my if we could just reverse that right there what a powerful church would it be at this moment now I'm not saying it's not powerful but what I'm saying they may more of that kingdom would be manifested externally amen if we got those roles reversed right there Amen both sometimes we are so looking at earthly Goods and looking at earthly things and and and and yeah and and I'm gonna say young people listen I know you have plans I know you have things in life but let me tell you you've got to seek the you got to seek the kingdom of God first in your life if you want to get somewhere with God and you want to fully have success in life you've got to seek he got first then there's no way around it there is no way around it so if you try to make it on your own and if you're trying to do your own thing and you're not going to get anywhere you're gonna come you're coming to a big fall in your life you're coming to something great that's gonna damage you because of a choice that you make that's why it's so important to seek amen to - to not think about earthly Goods and earthly things but be be strong in spirit instead blessed be poor for yours is the kingdom of God the kingdom of God is not meat and drink it is not material it is it is within us a rich man is rich in God not in worldly things brother Branham says praise God next slide that's a rich man there's God God's kingdom is not of this earth God's kingdom is in our hearts it's the spiritual Kingdom that we're born into it see Jesus said the kingdom of God comes but with not not without violence and what he meant there without observation and the kingdom of God is within you watch the Holy Spirit God's kingdom moving in the man and governing and controlling him that's the kingdom amen that's the kingdom Saints that's going to it's going to establish Amen that at a later point that it be manifested physically which we will look at here in just a moment again it's hard to - next slide again it's something that you can't explain you you have to experience the new birth all comes down if you experience the new birth then you realize what this kingdom is about other than that you're not going to understand it because all you are is just a natural man a natural woman is as the scripture says you have to be born again first Corinthians 4:20 for the kingdom of God is not in word but in power so this is the kingdom of God is power now I'll put there the word kills but the Spirit is the one that gives life that's why Saints is so important in this hour that you you can have the nut you can have knowledge of this word you can you can know the message from from back and forth and explain every story that brother Branham went through and different stories in the Bible but that is not power that is not the new birth and I'm afraid a lot of many of us sometimes we we can explain things in the Bible but we don't know anything about that power that power of how to overcome this earth that power of how to overcome the line how to overcome cheating how to overcome smoking how to overcome pornography how to overcome all these things that constantly bombard us you need more than just the stories you need more than just knowing the letter you need the life amen that's the only thing that's going to combat your enemy you it's gonna combat you amen acts 1:8 says but ye shall receive power and that power that word power there is Dunamis which comes from the word that's where they get the word dynamite Dunamis you don't want EXO sia power not the part that the disciples had when Jesus gave them power to cast out devils heal the sick and do all these different miracles that's not the power you want that's that the if we get if you get Dunamis power you get all that to you see you can just get that Dunamis power because that Dunamis power is the Holy Ghost amen but if you you can have the letter you can have the physical things I was telling the church there in Beaufort you can do all these physical things as shout and sing loud and shake the preachers hand and do all kinds of but if you don't have the Holy Spirit in your life none of that none of that will benefit you amen none of it will benefit you it it helps you but it won't it's not the Holy Ghost after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you is when you'll receive that power amen I'm here still with me praise God next slide we're trying to move as quick as we can brother Brown says here what is the kingdom of God is within you the kingdoms in you and when the word comes in there now watch what does this word begin it turns itself into power you see I like the way he's explaining this making it say just exactly what it said that is one thing about the new birth that it's going to always lead you to the Word of God and it I always make you say what the word says if you if you are outside of the word or if you're saying something contrary to their word then it's not the Word of God in you because it's not the Holy Spirit in you amen must be your spirit must be your own thought but it can't be the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost only gives me indication to its own word amen you stay with the word brother branham says there it is see and it makes it power Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever praise the Lord next slide now just real quickly what the kingdom of God is not in Romans 14:17 the Bible says for the kingdom of God is not meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost if you read that whole chapter which we don't have time to do but you can read there that Paul was speaking to a group who were concerned about the physical things about if I should eat this or not eat this or what more you can read that on your own but I think sometimes especially at the early uh the early part of the when people received a message and and it's been like this throughout all of the ages but sometimes we think that by our works we're going to be able to please God and advance this kingdom or by the things that we do or don't do in a reality that's that that's not what it advances the kingdom that's not what Kurt Amen that's part of the kingdom but that's not the heart of the kingdom and the Satan will want to try to come in and confuse that in your life and say look because you have long hair because you wear long dresses because you brothers don't sag your pants or their or you don't wear tight jeans and all this kind of stuff you must be alright you must be in this kingdom you must be in the word amen but it's that word changing you from day to day is that life in you making you draw closer to the Lord loving the Brethren Amen loving the word wanting to come to church there's a lot of things that go into this kingdom than just dressing in and all this types of stuff so so when I put here faith without works is so you can have faith and not have works because the two go hand-in-hand a man it's dead the life is dead but and also works without faith are dead also so you can do lots of things in the physical but if you don't have that faith in the Word of God amen if that faith has not come in there then it's it's all dead so we got to have both of them right we got to have both things amen next slide the Bram says here God's blood bound promises makes us free from sin and shame and different from the rest of the world you don't have to dress different anybody can dress different you have to be on the inside different the life is on the inside not dressing wearing the kingdom of God is not meat and drink or wearing of apparel but it's the long-suffering goodness gentleness patience in the Holy Ghost amen next next slide then we're going to come over on the Armenian side what do they get works that's the holiness groups works bless God I'll let my hair grow out the women in oh praise God I won't even wear a short sleeve shirt see we all saw those things back in the day you know the man will all will will and so forth like that brother Branham says that has nothing to do with the kingdom that has nothing to do with the king the next slide and the quote continues no sir you can let your hair grow long you can wear dresses whatever you want to or you can do this that or the other and it won't have nothing at all to do with it so that's why I feel terrible when when you win children or young people are taught that that's that's what the message is about that's not what the message is about if you think that that's what the message is about then you need to read the message you need to go back and read what the message is about because that's not what brother Branham was what was preaching amen if so God would just have made some patterns of such Jesus wouldn't have had to die if it was by the way brother dawn would dress Jesus wouldn't have had to die because we all can look the part we all can do it we can look we can look the part but doesn't mean we have the part doesn't mean we have Christ in us amen you're saved because that God saved you by grace and you do these things just in appreciation common decency will tell you that you do those things and appreciation see you you're saved you received a new birth and because you appreciate God for giving you the new birth that's why you've let your hair grow out that's why you stopped sagging your pants that's why you stopped smoking cigarettes and you stopped listening to hip-hop music and you stopped doing these things because you appreciate what God has done for you amen that's why see don't don't put the cart before the horse don't don't think because you do these things you're going in no it's not that way next slide mark chapter 12 now you can be I want to just quickly touch on this not far from the kingdom see some some of us think that that that we can be you can be close to the kingdom you can know the word this goes back to knowing the word knowing knowing the letter but that's just being close to the kingdom that K that doesn't have to be necessarily be in the kingdom there and there Jesus was had said to a scribe that that he was not far from the kingdom because of his knowledge of the word he didn't tell them put him in the kingdom a man if you can go back and read that yourself mark chapter 12 verse 28 to 34 so being close to the kingdom does not mean you are in the kingdom Pilate was standing right there in front of the kingdom that didn't put him in the kingdom many people touched Jesus in that day that touched the kingdom of God physically that didn't put him in the kingdom amen many people and all throughout the ages have gone to church have cried have have have had sensations have had all kinds of feelings and all kinds of things but then some of them where are you there at now where are they now and if it wasn't for the grace of God where would I be where would you be it's only being by the grace of God that you are still that you are here listening to the word this evening a man is only by his grace by His mercy that you have that desiring you to want to hear the word of God amen praise God so you can be close to the kingdom that does not mean that you are in the kingdom next slide you can be here at church that doesn't mean that your church is in you that God's in you so how do you receive this kingdom again we go back to John chapter 3 where Jesus was talking to Nicodemus we're just on verse 3 and we're just skipping in this chapter jesus answered and said unto Him verily verily I say unto thee except in other words this is the only way except a man be born again he could not see the kingdom of God there's no other way around it you want to get to heaven you want to get closer to God you've got to be born again there's no other way around it don't come to a place in life where you are forced to come to that point III hope that nobody here comes to that point you you fix things with God now while there is time amen except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God next slide Brown says you are born into the kingdom of God how by the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost is the word it's the life of God that's God's witness he gives witness by the Word of God see that we've passed from death unto life because we are in the kingdom of God next slide so Jesus continues talking to Nicodemus and the cadenas Nicodemus is spellbound I mean he's confounded he does he doesn't understand what Jesus is telling him and jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so he cannot he cannot see the kingdom of God now he cannot enter into the kingdom of God and in the water and what is the water and what is the spirit is the Word of God it's the life of God amen praise God so next slide or the Bram says here no matter what it looks like here we don't look at what we see we look at what we do not see is that right anyhow to see doesn't mean to look up the word see means to understand Jesus said except a man be born of water and spirit he cannot see the kingdom of God in other words he can't understand the kingdom of God until he's born again see you have to accept it by faith and then when he comes into you you understand it amen I like that when he comes into you then you can understand it in other words when you let that when you hear that word in that word does something in you and you say and you say amen to that word that word is mine amen and you let that word change your life amen that's that that's him coming into you amen then you can understand the kingdom then next slide it's got to be by revelation the kingdom of God is something that cannot be explained Jesus again speaking to Nicodemus and I like this this verse because at the time when I was studying this a couple of years ago III read this and got and God would just revealed this to me and and it was wonderful to me but Jesus tells Nicodemus that the wind blows where it listeth and and you and you hear the sound of it but you cannot tell where it comes or where it goes and so is every one that is born of the Spirit you see how he ties that in there the Holy Ghost is something that you cannot explain you like for example your outside you feel the wind and you hear it sometimes but maybe you cannot explain where it comes from or where it goes they meant but but you feel the effects of it and that's the same thing with the new birth amen you don't understand how it came you know what happened you just know that it's there because it's manifesting itself through your life amen and we'll look at this here just a moment next brother Brown says here verily verily I say unto you except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God now you couldn't see the kingdom of God because the kingdom of God is the Holy Spirit so I'm standing here will not taste the death till they see the kingdom of God coming in power he said next slide then the kingdom of God the Bible said is within you it's within you the Holy Spirit in you can't see that with your eyes so see means to understand I can't I can't show brother dawn and you know the Holy Ghost in me amen neither can you a man it's just it's shown it's by your fruits you shall know them the Bible says amen it's it's the only way you'll know that the kingdom is being established in your life next how many are still with me amen now that brother Brown says here now that translation there is really understand understand the kingdom of God the kingdom of God's within you so you couldn't actually see it lest you see it operating right that's the only way to see the kingdom but the only way you'll ever be able to understand it you've got to be born together again it's the only way next slide to be borned again you've been filled with God's Spirit then you're in Christ and when you're in Christ the Holy Spirit that wrote the Bible that manifested Christ is in you to recognize his own self amen and his own self is the word and then again and the kingdom of God is the word now God's kingdom is not of this world and when Christ was here he give us the program of this kingdom he gave us the program of God's kingdom the father's kingdom which is his word now if you want to know how you get into that kingdom this words got it that it's it's through the word next trying to go quickly here now the kingdom of God is a mystery now revealed in mark chapter 4 you you in Luke 8:10 you see Jesus was telling his disciples until you it is given to know the mystery of the kingdom of God see they knew the mystery they maybe they knew though at that time but they had not experienced it it's one thing to know and one thing to experience amen until you it is given to know the mysteries of the kingdom of God Jesus would tell them and really they were they were predestinated to that but it wasn't at that time it wasn't until the new birth amen nextslide and Paul continue saying in Colossians even the mystery which hath been hid from ages and from generations but has now made manifested to his Saints so throughout all the ages throughout all the ages that the new birth that has come has come throughout all the ages that mystery has been made manifest to his Saints amen that's not that's not something that's not something new but it's something that we must experience which is the new birth which is Christ in you as paulkaiju said to whom god would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the gentiles which is christ in you the hope of glory see so it wasn't just Christ Christ in flesh just the body of Christ amen but now is that Christ in you living his life through you amen so that that's that's that's been experienced throughout all the church ages next slide but now when in revelations chapter ten verse seven and we are very familiar but of this verse but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets now I say amen to that I believe that with all my heart but that's not where it stops because after that next verse a man you John had to go in and grab that mystery and get in and eat it again that goes back to you know the word and you know the message and you know the mysteries but that if that needs to be in you you need to experience that because what this is about how can I live closer to God how can I give this up in my life how can I stop doing this in my life you've got to have that word in you through the Holy Spirit manifesting they meant many of us even young people and children you know we've grown up in the word we've grown up learning this message from left and right and we know all the stories and the story of the possum and and and all those good things and that's wonderful and that's lovely but have you had an experience with God have you no is this word making you live closer to God is this word making you obey your parents is this word making you draw wondering put that desire in you amen to want to come to church to obey authority to obey yea those in charge amen praise God as he had declared to his servants the prophets nextslide and God said let us make man in our image after in Genesis 1:26 this spiritual Kingdom must now manifest itself in its fullness look what Genesis 1:26 brother Waits favorite scripture God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth and I believe this this is the Dominion that we lost we lost that I mean we have some sort of dominion over the cattle but but really still the cattle is kind of afraid of us the fish is afraid of us the birds are afraid of us and there's something that wants to connect with them but they're that that sin right there that thing Amen that that that broke that fellowship with that with the kingdom with that kingdom a man needs be back restored in our lives so again it has to start with a new birth it has to start with the Word of God in your life amen next brother Graham says here unless we suffer with him we cannot reign with him you have to suffer to reign the reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering see character is a victory not a gift a man without character can't reign because power apart from character is satanic that's why we we cannot rule over the this physical kingdom here on earth because some of us like that character some of us lack a man what that character a man in order to reign the way we need to reign the way God ordained it to be it from the beginning next slide I think it's a continuation of this but look what brother Branham says but power with character is fit to rule how do you get that power by the Holy Ghost amen and since he wants us to share even his throne on the same basis that he overcame and is set down in his Father's throne then we have to overcome to sit with him who do we overcome us I'm not overcoming I'm not all recommen Loren I'm not overcoming brother Don or brother Dale no I'm overcoming me I'm my own problem you are your own problem you are your worst enemy nextslide can't put it all on the devil can't blame it all on the devil this is we are the ones who God gave us free moral agency we're the ones who make decisions in life we're the ones who make the right decisions we make choices we make the right choices or we make wrong choices amen and just real quickly look what character means moral excellence and firmness and then in other words having the good characters the way you behave when others are not watching you how do you behave when others are not watching when you're not in how do you behave what attitude do you have what what what thoughts amen are they pointing you back to the word are your actress pointing back to your work to the word and if you don't know how to rule over your your earth your body how can you rule and reign over the planet Earth you see so you you have to have that Kingdom already spiritually established in you Amen that's what I'm trying to get to next oh I think they missed something there okay so I think oh I lift this out I'm sorry but this is where I was gonna have the statue of a perfect man that's why these virtues need to be established in the believers life after the kingdom has come into the believer a man see the those virtues our Holy Ghost virtues they're not your virtues you didn't come it is Earth with these virtues a man you have a little bit of faith and you have some some virtue and some knowledge some human knowledge and some temperance and some patience you know with one another I many of you you're not going to hold a job if you don't have patience with people you some godliness you know you can you can be good to others but there there is a difference between physical of human of those things and Holy Ghost of these virtues you see and the only way you can have these things forming in your life is that you've got to have the Word of God the Holy Ghost by the new birth in your life a true genuine Holy Ghost experience in your life amen again I'm saying these things to kind of simplify it amen for the for the younger ones as well amen next slide so I do apologize for the older ones that maybe I've already heard this that's alright it's good to hear it again because this is what the kingdom is about the kingdom in you will call forth a resurrection amen all of the subjects and poor takers of this kingdom must resurrect and complete fullness in other words that that life in you amen all of us amen well one day call out that the dead from the grave the dead Saints from the grave amen and it's not that we're standing up in our in a in a graveyard calling forth you know different names no a man it's just that that there's a pool there there's a pool there that that that the subjects of this kingdom must all be in fullness a man in order to meet the king amen praise God then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up with them and of course as we read in 1st Thessalonians 4 13 through 17 you see this is what this key so in order for you for this to be an experience a for you to experience this in your life you have to already have that Kingdom in me you see that's calling you to a physical Kingdom amen it's calling you because they're God's kingdom will be established here on earth physically but it's got to be in you first into in order to mold your character so that God can have complete confidence in you that you are going to be the Kings and the priests that God made you out to be amen because the Bible says that in the latter day there's gonna be kings and priests we're gonna we're made kings and priests amen next slide first Thessalonians 4:16 4:17 for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first that has not been fulfilled yet that still needs to be fulfilled then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air that has not been fulfilled yet so again I say you and I are men are the ones to fulfill that in this time and I believe the hour is upon us I don't know about you amen but I feel that the coming of the Lord is soon at hand I feel I feel that and you know maybe he could be you another hundred years who knows but I'm gonna live my life like he's coming tomorrow amen I wanna I wanna pray like he's coming tomorrow and I want to read like he's coming tomorrow and I want to come to church like he's coming tomorrow I don't want to be caught doing something else and and doing my own thing amen and thinking that I'm gonna I'm gonna make it in no unfortunately there's people that are gonna be here they're gonna be left that has to be fulfilled as well that's a scripture that has to be fulfilled so make sure that you have the kingdom established in your heart it's not something hard not something difficult it's something that you just experience as you stay in the world you cannot explain it just stay in the word keep doing what you're supposed to do amen is that encouragement to you now keep doing what you're supposed to do amen to each one of us amen keep reading the word keep listening to the word and I believe as you're every little tape that you hear every word that you read every sermon that you put in that establishes you more and more into that kingdom or it better yet that kingdom establishes more and more than you it's not difficult amen next it's not difficult in the sense of that it that you know to explain it I mean you know you can but it's it's it's it's a life that it can be difficult it's hard to live because this thing gets in the way this is what gets in the way amen now Satan builds his kingdom with no sure foundation from the head down to the feet now if you remember this is Nebuchadnezzar statue in Daniel chapter 2 this is the dream that Nebuchadnezzar had and this is how how Satan how Satan establishes his kingdom from the head down to the feet in other words he starts from the head and goes down to the feet now you're really supposed to build from the ground up right all right but but he the way he starts is through the head in other words through knowledge human now human-human everything and see this is what I'm saying if you think that you can make it on your own in life you're going to crumble because we see later on in this in this in this vision that Rock a mint comes down and knocks it at its feet and completely demolishes it now there's a lot that goes on to this and there's that's a whole study within itself but I'm just trying to bring it to our life amen you see that's what Satan that's how Satan that's how and that's how all those kingdoms of this earth have been established because if it's Satan that established it it's gonna go it's gonna fall it's gonna crumble you it starts out heady highminded no humility whatsoever you see next slide but this is how Christ builds his kingdom and then from the feet to the head amen it has to start humble and meek and if you if you don't get humility in your life you're not gonna get anywhere in life the humility will draw you closer to God but if you're a proud heavy high-minded lover of pleasure more than lovers of life you're gonna crumble next slide no crumble just and what's gonna humble you is Jesus Christ right the rock it's coming down it's down in it that's what's gonna humble you and I don't want it to be that way young people I don't want it to be it doesn't have to be that way amen and that's why Kingdom that's why Satan's Kingdom will not stand and you see right now we're seeing these things coming together I mean it's been coming together all these kingdoms have been have have been destroyed the this is what's happening right now daddy Pope I don't know what's going on but he's on behind the scenes and then yeah there's no telling what's going on but it's going to crumble no matter no matter it's gonna crumble next slide Thanks cannot stand Daniel chapter 2 verse 35 it says then was the iron the clay the brass the silver and the gold broken to pieces together and became like the Schaaf of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found for them and the stone that smote the image became a great mountain and filled the whole earth amen hey man that's Christ that's what say Amen when that stone that stone hits your life that's what's going to stand it's going to form Christ in your life until you get hit by that stone they man you're not you're gonna do your own thing you've got to crumble that Christ may make me may the image of Christ may grow in you amen next slide now you see Daniel was seeing this Daniel was seeing that a physical kingdom was being established many many years ago see now that this kingdom that is being there was established in his Saints now it's going to come to fruition into full manifestation at some point Daniel 2:44 and in the days of these kings those kings that there were named there in the statue shall the God of heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed now let me tell you what in the days of this kings in other words while those ages were coming God was setting up up and kingdom in people's hearts God was setting up his kingdom - Satan was setting up his kingdom but God was setting up his kingdom in the hearts of man in unseen Kingdom and what who's the one that ends up winning and the Kingdom shall not be left to other people but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever the kingdom of God next slide but the RAM says here we're almost finished enough God already took up his abode potentially all right the kingdom of God is in the earth now right right now in the heart of his Saints amen it's his attributes that he began in the beginning now his attributes is redeemed what's he waiting to redeem the earth to say his attributes on it that's you and I amen to fulfill exactly his predestinated plan so it wasn't just about coming to church he wasn't just about reading the Bible it wasn't a man it's God manifesting himself walking on this earth ruling over creation ruling over the animal kingdom ruling over everything amen exactly the way Adam did except we probably have it greater than because we have we're Adam then it was an eternal in his flesh amen we would have eternal life in our flesh amen as well praise God next slide then our headship is a kingdom the kingdom of God is within you said the Bible Jesus the kingdom we are not a denomination we belong to a kingdom and the Kingdom is the word of God made spirit and life in our own life amen they're hitting the kingdom coming in plain view next slide oh this is the continuation of that quote bringing to pass every promise in this day as it did in that day when the word and God was one and the word in God is one in his church today making it the headship of the body that is redeemed to bring the message in the last day and be taken up from the dead that's what's coming next in the resurrection to go back and restore again as Adam and Eve in the beginning in the Garden of Eden that's that's the that's the whole plan that God had in mind amen next slide so I say Saints seek ye first the kingdom of God that's why Jesus said seek first the kingdom of God in everything that you do seek him first in every plan that you have seek him first this goes from the adult to the younger one here everything that you do seek the kingdom of God first Jesus himself commanded us to seek the kingdom of God it wasn't just a something that he just you know it wasn't a suggestion it was a commandment seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and look and all these things all these jobs all these houses all these cars all these marriages all these things amen all the things that you want in life shall be added unto you seeking the kingdom of God first is the most important thing it's the most a essential thing that you must do amen above anything else and and let me just simplify what is seeking the kingdom of God first it's putting God in first place in everything everything in your life you have the option to do something else a man is and come to church I come to church you have the option to - to do something else or pray I pray you have the option they meant to go spend time with your mom or go spend time with your dad or go spend time with your with your with your brothers and sisters instead of coming to church I'll go I'll go to church that's just an example of seeking the kingdom of God first and when that is not manifested in your life then we just know who is in first place in your life it's you and it's not the kingdom next slide Luke 18 28 verse 30 then Peter said lo we have left all and followed thee see they they left everything and followed you and look what Jesus was blessing me he said unto them verily I say unto you there is no man that hath left house or parents or brethren or wife or children for the kingdom of God's sake who shall not receive manifold more in this present time in other words you're gonna be rewarded for that decision here in this life in this life you're going to receive results and you're going to receive rewards for making the right choices to seek the kingdom of God first and the world and not just in this present time but in the world to come life everlasting so it pays to seek the kingdom of God amen next slide I think I think all right so we're just this I think is the closing slides I want you to read this with me this is what we opened with and let's close with this Matthew 6 verse 9 through 13 after this manner therefore pray ye our Father which are in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors and lead us not into temptation but deliver us from evil for thine is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever amen praise the Lord when you have the kingdom of God in you you you read that difference you read that different I think that's it so to see the Lord's Prayer is the bride's prayer amen the Lord that's that's that's the Bride of God's prayer that's because you have the Lord inside you have the kingdom in you that will manifest on it on the outside man I did pretty good I thought I was just gonna be that was it right brother's not like they can that was 50 slides and I'm like home I couldn't as I'm gonna be keeping them till 9 but praise God you know I mean I just didn't go through a much jibber-jabber but Saints young people listen this is this is again like I preached last time the hour that we're living in now I want to say this things are gonna get worse I mean they're already saying that things are gonna get worse and whether you believe it's a conspiracy or not amen it's gonna get worse all right things are gonna get bad it's time for us to really like I said last time get shut in if God and really man it really seek out this kingdom in your life because what what does it matter for you to go in and and do everything else and forget about God when this world is dying and it's falling apart at this very moment that you're living at this very moment that you're living is crumbling into pieces man can't get their story straight and this guy you cannot put any any trust in governments you cannot put the trust in in any man in this earth only in what God said in his word for you to just go on the side and say look I'll just do it later you do not know if you have later in your life you do not know there is no guarantee that you have tomorrow so why don't you do what you can today again it's my plea amen to each one of us amen to do the first works over you lost your first love go back to your first love amen you love you wherever you left God that's where you're gonna find him if you left them in your prayer life that's where you're gonna find him go back into prayer if you left him and come into church go back to coming to church amen if you left them in it whatever way you left him that's where you'll find him that's where you're gonna find him waiting for you it's not time for us to get consumed with what we want to do and forget God it's time for us to seek the kingdom of God first listen I have plans I still have things that I want to do and I wonder I want to be able to fulfill I want to be able to Amen but I put this in my life first I put this a day I don't because again I may not get to travel the world I mean I get to do all these things I love traveling and I love mission work and I love these things but one day I'm gonna do it anyways because the earth is gonna be mine anyways so amen so if I want the whole earth I want the whole world they mentally I want to settle this kingdom in my heart first amen but you know you you look at the things things look bleak but amen I believe God is still in them on youth I believe God's still working god bless you all let's stand to our feet it's having a musician come praise the Lord Jesus I'm listening that song brother brother Boyd I think you were singing and right before we came out I have decided to

finance it man it's it's good that you gave it a down payment amen but really that car is not really yours it still belongs to the bank because you're making payments on it until you pay that thing in full and to that things completed unto that thing comes to a maturity date amen then you could say the car is mine because you're gonna get you're given a title amen and it's yours amen and this thing until it gets mature mature a man into it comes to that maturity time a man that we could say all heavens and earth is mine a man come out like jesus said they made praise God o everything a man I have power over all heaven death hell and the grave amen hey there's somebody this is somebody you've got to conquer death there's somebody gonna conquer death in this life see Jesus was dead when he conquered death but somebody's gonna be alive when he conquered death and that has never happened yet think about it Saints what a wonderful things that we have in store for us and that's our praise
