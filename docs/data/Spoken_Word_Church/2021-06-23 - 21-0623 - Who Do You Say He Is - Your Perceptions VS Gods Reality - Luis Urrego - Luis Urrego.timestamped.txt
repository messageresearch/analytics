[9:15] him may taking him to central america
[9:18] and
[9:18] south america mexico or something like

[9:47] one another and
[9:48] so uh we're looking forward to that and
[9:50] also remember us in your prayers this
[9:52] sunday we'll be ministering in beaufort
[9:55] south carolina there brother samuel not

[9:57] so you just remember us in prayer as we
[10:00] travel amen amen
[10:01] that the lord are just blessed how many
[10:03] love the lord amen
[10:05] amen praise god i know you didn't come
[10:06] to hear me you come to hear something
[10:08] from god so let's just go straight to
[10:10] the word this
[10:11] this afternoon and let's turn to matthew
[10:13] 16.
[10:15] matthew 16.
[10:18] let's start at verse 13. and i want to
[10:20] talk this
[10:21] afternoon about who do you say that he
[10:24] is
[10:26] and i want you to make that that a
[10:28] personal question to you
[10:30] but as i guess as a little subtitle i
[10:33] guess
[10:34] let's talk about also your perceptions
[10:36] versus god's reality
[10:38] amen we're going to take a look at that
[10:41] perceptions versus reality
[10:44] because uh sometimes i think in our
[10:46] perceptions we make our perceptions
[10:48] our reality and in reality it isn't
[10:53] we think that they are but they're not
[10:56] especially if they're not based out uh
[10:58] from the word of god the word of god
[11:00] should be the reality over all realities
[11:03] because he is and he is the creator of
[11:05] all things
[11:06] and so he's he's our absolute brother
[11:08] branham said right
[11:09] so we should base everything upon the
[11:11] word of god amen
[11:13] that should be our final standard amen
[11:16] in a christian's life amen so let's
[11:19] let's just read this
[11:20] matthew chapter 16. starting at verse 13
[11:23] it says
[11:24] when jesus came into the coast of
[11:26] caesarea philippi he asked his disciples
[11:28] saying whom do man
[11:30] say that i the son of man am right and
[11:32] they said
[11:33] some say that thou art john the baptist
[11:36] some elias and
[11:37] others jeremiah's or one of the prophets
[11:40] he saith unto them but whom say ye that
[11:43] i am
[11:44] and simon peter answered and said thou
[11:47] art the christ
[11:48] the son of the living god and jesus
[11:52] answered and said unto him
[11:53] blessed art thou simon bar barjona for
[11:56] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[11:58] unto thee but my father which is in
[12:01] heaven amen
[12:02] and i say unto thee that thou art peter
[12:04] and upon this rock i will build my
[12:06] church
[12:07] and the gates of hell shall not prevail
[12:10] against him
[12:11] and i will give unto thee the keys of
[12:13] the kingdom of heaven
[12:14] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[12:17] shall be bound in heaven
[12:18] and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[12:21] shall be
[12:22] loosed in heaven then charged he his
[12:24] disciples that they should tell no man
[12:27] that he was jesus christ amen so
[12:30] let's just bow our heads this afternoon
[12:32] you pray for me and i just remember all
[12:34] the requests that we have amongst us
[12:37] and uh let's just go to the lord and
[12:38] pray our heavenly father we thank you
[12:40] lord for the opportunity to open back
[12:42] the pages of your word
[12:43] and father god we know lord jesus that
[12:46] without revelation lord jesus these
[12:48] would just be empty words in a in a page
[12:50] father
[12:51] but lord we ask that these these words
[12:53] would just pop
[12:54] lord to us and reveal them to us father
[12:57] god
[12:58] make us lord jesus uh draw closer to you
[13:01] lord god know in our position father god
[13:04] as sons and daughters of god
[13:06] here lord representing you lord in this
[13:08] wicked hour that we live in
[13:09] lord we thank you meet every need that's
[13:12] amongst us father for
[13:13] we certainly have many lord god that
[13:15] that are sick
[13:16] many they're having maybe even financial
[13:20] problems whatever the needs may be lord
[13:22] you know every situation
[13:24] and you knew it even before the
[13:25] foundation of the world and best of all
[13:27] lord you know how to take care of it
[13:29] lord god
[13:30] so we just committed all unto you and we
[13:32] just commit ourselves unto you father
[13:34] in jesus christ's name amen amen you may
[13:37] be seated this afternoon
[13:41] i'll do my best to not keep you all
[13:43] along this
[13:45] this evening um i just wanted to also
[13:48] mention i forgot to mention this
[13:50] uh uh this week that i've been talking
[13:52] to brother
[13:53] soriano and uh
[13:56] and he says greetings to each and every
[13:59] one of you all and just remember him in
[14:01] prayer amen
[14:02] um but uh just interesting how
[14:05] how you would think that you know in the
[14:08] last year
[14:09] um there's they're having they have not
[14:11] been able to have church services like
[14:14] like they should
[14:14] like like they were accustomed to have
[14:17] and just things you know and they're
[14:18] still
[14:19] i mean they're still pretty much heavily
[14:21] locked down just like our neighbors up
[14:23] north are right now
[14:24] um just like it's still 20 20. and and
[14:27] uh
[14:28] so but uh he told me he said that uh
[14:33] even though that they've had this
[14:34] pandemic and everything going on
[14:36] there's been five churches that have
[14:38] come out out of the pandemic
[14:40] amen five churches right uh
[14:43] just just out of uh of him um
[14:47] you know he's been ministering through
[14:49] zoom through the zoom calls and things
[14:51] like that
[14:52] and of course the the other assistant
[14:54] ministers helping out as well
[14:56] but out out of that i don't know how it
[14:58] happened we didn't get it he didn't get
[14:59] to tell me all the details but
[15:01] he said there's been about five churches
[15:03] come out of the man
[15:04] so it's interesting how god does that
[15:08] so you think you think you know the
[15:11] bible definitely does
[15:13] it says all things work together for
[15:15] good so you think something when
[15:17] something is for bad there's there's god
[15:19] doing something else on the behind the
[15:21] scenes
[15:22] and uh if there wasn't this pandemic
[15:25] there wasn't this lockdown to shut down
[15:27] over there
[15:27] maybe these people would not have been
[15:29] able to come out
[15:30] so these churches might not have been
[15:32] able to spring up so
[15:33] i just wanted to share that with you
[15:35] good to just kind of
[15:38] excite us a little bit amen like god's
[15:40] still working amen
[15:42] in the world he's definitely working out
[15:44] there in in
[15:45] in in that area that's right definitely
[15:48] if the brother could if the brothers in
[15:50] the back could just pull up the
[15:52] the first picture i want to start off
[15:54] with this
[15:56] i hope they were able to get the
[15:57] pictures
[15:59] um all right so we want to we want to
[16:03] just play a little game for just a
[16:05] moment
[16:06] now i want you all to see uh
[16:09] uh see what you see and just let you
[16:12] just
[16:12] you we all have seen these things and i
[16:15] want to see what what you see
[16:17] so how many sees uh
[16:20] a man playing a saxophone
[16:25] how many sees uh uh a woman's face
[16:28] okay does every everybody sees pretty
[16:31] much
[16:32] both things all right all right next
[16:37] all right here's another one right here
[16:39] um
[16:41] see if you can find the elephant's legs
[16:52] it's hard right because they're blending
[16:54] in with the back with the backdrop so
[16:56] it's really
[16:57] uh it's an optical illusion it's playing
[16:59] with your mind
[17:01] and the fact that i know it's playing
[17:02] with your mind is because some of you
[17:04] looked at it and started chuckling
[17:08] so go ahead next
[17:11] all right how many sees a young woman
[17:14] looking over
[17:16] do you see also the old the older lady
[17:22] i'll give y'all just a moment got it you
[17:24] got it
[17:25] all right it took me a while to see the
[17:27] older lady but i finally got to see it
[17:29] there there's there's the older leg the
[17:30] chin there's the nose mouth
[17:32] but then there's a profile of a side
[17:34] view of a woman young woman looking to
[17:36] the side
[17:37] but you have to look hard right you have
[17:39] to see
[17:40] things that wasn't exactly the way you
[17:43] thought it was at first
[17:45] right so there's a neck next
[17:50] how many sees a duck duck head
[17:54] how many sees a rabbit head yep
[18:00] you see both what stood out to me first
[18:04] was the duck
[18:06] but then then then i saw the rabbit next
[18:08] but the rat there's the rabbit ears and
[18:10] there's the
[18:12] the mouth next
[18:15] all right and who sees the vase
[18:21] and you see the two faces as well yeah
[18:24] all right you all are so smart
[18:27] praise the lord
[18:28] [Laughter]
[18:31] amen and i think there's one more one
[18:33] more i wanted to show y'all
[18:41] who are these are are those moving
[18:45] when you look at them are they moving
[18:47] sure
[18:51] yeah yeah but they're not moving
[18:55] it's just your mind is interpreting like
[18:57] this if they're moving
[18:59] but you know that they're not moving so
[19:02] this is what's called an
[19:03] optical illusion and uh
[19:06] we'll say we'll save the next let's see
[19:09] what's next brother
[19:12] i think that's it for now okay
[19:15] we'll just stop it there
[19:19] that is what you call an optical
[19:20] illusion and uh
[19:22] and so it it in reality
[19:26] it isn't what you think it is amen
[19:29] and so and so i wanted to just kind of
[19:31] show that to you to just
[19:33] um to just let you know hey your brain
[19:36] sometimes plays tricks on you
[19:39] and uh but god has given us those types
[19:41] of things amen to also be
[19:43] for survival purposes as well right in
[19:46] it
[19:47] on this earth especially you know we
[19:49] he's given us the five
[19:50] senses the sea taste hear smell uh
[19:53] feel um in order for us to contact this
[19:56] world
[19:57] amen amen um and and we need that
[20:00] to survive amen but at some point in our
[20:04] lives at some point in time amen
[20:06] we have to go beyond the five senses
[20:09] amen right we have to go beyond the five
[20:12] sentences a christian with the holy
[20:14] ghost amen in their life
[20:15] god dealing in their life god wants to
[20:18] train his children amen to look beyond
[20:20] just what you're seeing or just what
[20:22] you're hearing just what you're tasting
[20:24] or just what you're feeling amen
[20:26] because god is a god that needs to be
[20:28] believed by faith
[20:30] it needs to be taken by faith and that's
[20:33] the hard part
[20:34] for us as human beings because we don't
[20:37] see
[20:37] taste feel or smell him amen and you
[20:40] could
[20:40] yeah we know brother brother daley he
[20:42] has a testimony where he said
[20:44] he smelled god in the woods amen i
[20:47] believe that amen
[20:48] i believe that he can make himself uh uh
[20:51] in that way
[20:52] to us amen and he can show himself a man
[20:55] even uh
[20:56] in in the form of a light we see it uh
[20:59] and in the pillar of fire that was even
[21:01] photographed there as we showed the
[21:02] picture there just a moment ago
[21:04] but i wanted to make a comment there
[21:06] about that picture if the brothers could
[21:08] bring that up real quick
[21:10] in 19 i believe was 1953 when that was
[21:13] photographed or 52
[21:14] 52 somewhere there in the early 50s and
[21:18] and it's interesting
[21:19] how god allowed for that to be
[21:21] photographed
[21:22] a supernatural being who by the way
[21:26] all the illusions that i just showed you
[21:28] all the
[21:29] the people around the world who talk
[21:31] about supernatural this
[21:33] they talk about uh i saw a ghost here
[21:36] and this that or the other
[21:37] and they're all into aliens and all this
[21:40] kind of stuff
[21:41] but yet they've never heard of that
[21:43] picture we've never seen that picture
[21:46] nobody i've never heard anybody on tv or
[21:48] a documentary ever talking about that
[21:50] picture
[21:51] and to me to me it seems like it's just
[21:53] satan trying to hide it from the people
[21:56] because he knows it's real man he knows
[21:59] it's true
[22:00] and he won't give you a man the uh truth
[22:03] he won't really uh
[22:04] i mean when he does tell you a lie he
[22:07] does give you 99
[22:08] truth amen but i just wonder why this
[22:11] isn't
[22:12] all out there the way we think it should
[22:14] be right
[22:15] amen but you see a a supernatural being
[22:18] was photographed
[22:19] amen and that's the pillar of fire uh
[22:22] over brother branham's head there and
[22:24] it's amazing and
[22:26] how god timed to for this photograph to
[22:29] be
[22:29] taken at this time when there was no
[22:31] photoshop or anything such
[22:33] right because nowadays if that picture
[22:35] would have been taken nowadays if the
[22:37] prophet was living nowadays
[22:38] people would he said oh that's photoshop
[22:40] that's that that was just added into it
[22:42] but he made sure that that was taken
[22:44] during the time
[22:45] when there was no photoshop there was no
[22:48] maybe there was some sort of editing
[22:49] of images but it wasn't as advanced as
[22:52] it is now
[22:53] right right and and and so uh
[22:56] that it could it could it could be very
[22:58] well said hey
[22:59] that is a and it was not only that but
[23:01] it was also verified by a government
[23:03] agent as well
[23:04] it was the only supernatural being ever
[23:06] to struck the
[23:08] struck the lands they man photographed
[23:10] in that way so
[23:11] that's why i wanted to show that so
[23:15] that for a believer is not an optical
[23:18] illusion
[23:19] amen that should be the truth that
[23:22] should
[23:23] that should be something that you
[23:24] shouldn't be ashamed of either
[23:26] amen yeah right praise god because that
[23:30] is part of what we believe
[23:32] amen amen and and you say oh they tell
[23:34] you oh well you're just worshipping a
[23:36] man you're
[23:36] but see you're looking at the wrong
[23:37] thing you're looking at the wrong thing
[23:40] we're concentrating on this up here amen
[23:42] we're not concentrating on the man
[23:45] and that's where satan tries to distort
[23:47] the thing amen the image amen the
[23:49] reality
[23:50] is is is is this amen amen that
[23:54] that that is just as much real as
[23:55] brother branham once all right
[23:57] amen but to be able to have the the the
[24:00] opportunity to have a picture made with
[24:02] god
[24:03] there you go thank god amen it was the
[24:05] only supernatural being and
[24:06] the world has no idea that it even
[24:08] exists
[24:10] amen but the believers should amen the
[24:12] believers should so amen
[24:14] praise god you can turn that off
[24:16] brothers
[24:17] so i wanted to to talk a little bit
[24:20] about our perception versus our reality
[24:22] and then just
[24:22] see where the lord leads amen so our
[24:24] perception does not necessarily mean
[24:27] that it's
[24:27] it's our reality amen the word
[24:30] perception means
[24:32] the way of regarding understanding or
[24:35] interpreting something or a mental
[24:38] impression
[24:38] that's what the word perception means
[24:41] it's the way
[24:41] you understand how something is right
[24:44] it's the way you for you
[24:46] think i i i i i i i in and if we're not
[24:49] careful
[24:49] that then could become our a reality if
[24:52] you don't have a balance
[24:54] to it you see then then then the then
[24:57] the word reality means this is the
[25:00] definition of the word reality means the
[25:01] world
[25:02] or the state of things as they actually
[25:05] exist
[25:06] right existence that is absolute
[25:08] self-sufficient or objective
[25:11] and not subject to human decisions or
[25:13] conventions
[25:14] in other words there's no dispute in it
[25:16] right it's there
[25:18] it is what it is amen that's reality
[25:21] right and when and and when you when
[25:23] they tell you you know uh
[25:25] when a few years ago when reality tv
[25:28] or reality tv shows came out those
[25:31] who who who watch tv
[25:34] when reality tv is coming out you don't
[25:36] even have to have a tv you just
[25:38] they got it on netflix they got it on
[25:40] all that now and uh
[25:43] but they made you think oh this is real
[25:45] tv
[25:47] and it was just as fake as any other
[25:48] fake show there is
[25:51] because and you look kind of look at
[25:53] some of the scenes they show and things
[25:54] like how in the world can they can they
[25:56] at the moment be able to to to to film
[26:00] that specific
[26:00] uh uh uh time or that specific event
[26:04] obviously something staged somewhere
[26:06] amen so
[26:07] so but perception i want you to listen
[26:10] to this perception
[26:11] occurs totally in the mind and can turn
[26:16] any belief into reality
[26:19] yeah right think about that anything
[26:22] that you perceive
[26:25] that it that that this microphone amen
[26:30] i may think it's something else but you
[26:32] you you might think it's something else
[26:34] but
[26:34] i say it's a microphone amen my
[26:37] perception of
[26:38] it amen or my perception or whatever it
[26:40] is in your mind amen
[26:41] can become a reality to you amen
[26:45] praise god and like i said earlier the
[26:48] perception needs to use your five senses
[26:50] in order to contact
[26:52] what it is amen to construct that
[26:54] reality for you
[26:55] so for example you might have touched
[26:57] something or you might have tasted
[26:59] something in the past
[27:00] and and now you know that whenever you
[27:02] smell that cologne nowadays it takes you
[27:05] back to something
[27:06] a reality that you experienced or
[27:08] something or or
[27:09] or a taste takes you back amen oh when
[27:12] you were a child back in such and such a
[27:14] place you see
[27:15] right amen it evokes emotions amen
[27:18] and so what what are those five senses
[27:20] we've just mentioned they will see
[27:22] taste hear smell and touch now now
[27:25] listen to this perception
[27:26] is not reality right all right people uh
[27:30] there's there's a thing out there that
[27:32] says that perception is reality
[27:34] but perception is not reality perception
[27:38] can become a person's reality
[27:41] because perception has a strong
[27:43] influence on how we look at reality
[27:46] so there is a difference see your
[27:49] perception of how you see
[27:50] someone that's that is your reality i
[27:53] may not see that person the way you see
[27:56] it
[27:56] right do you see what i'm trying to say
[27:59] now i'm trying to bring it to what
[28:01] what peter had what jesus had asked
[28:04] peter
[28:04] who do man say that i the son of man and
[28:07] exactly amen
[28:08] amen see sometimes amen you might think
[28:12] oh that person gets on my nerves
[28:15] but i have no problem with that person
[28:17] right because i have not had the
[28:19] experience maybe that you've had
[28:21] right but that doesn't make your
[28:23] perception of that person
[28:25] the reality or the proof of the standard
[28:28] right it doesn't that's right there is a
[28:30] reality
[28:31] and that's that person
[28:35] let's go talk to that person let's go
[28:37] see what that person is like
[28:39] then we'll we'll both know what the
[28:41] reality is like then you see
[28:42] right praise the lord amen and see
[28:46] perception but perception is really it
[28:49] acts as a lens through which we view
[28:51] reality
[28:52] see the way we perceive something it
[28:55] acts as the lens you know the way
[28:57] the way if i had a telescope with the
[28:58] lens you know it's it's this is the
[29:01] the what's making me see how brother
[29:03] wade is
[29:04] but if that perception if that lens is
[29:07] distorted
[29:08] in some way or another if it has gone
[29:11] through some sort of tragic experience
[29:13] and
[29:14] in your life and back or or something
[29:16] has happened
[29:17] that lens can be distorted and makes it
[29:20] makes it seem like that's the reality
[29:22] in reality it's not do you see what i'm
[29:26] saying
[29:27] so that's why saints as christians amen
[29:30] we have to be careful
[29:31] of how we judge one another of how we
[29:34] look one
[29:35] at one another or how we think of one
[29:38] another
[29:38] amen because let me tell you what satan
[29:41] is is is he's a
[29:42] master of of of changing the perceptions
[29:46] of people
[29:47] i mean that's what he does if he does it
[29:49] out there in the world then all you got
[29:50] to do is turn on cnn
[29:52] and i'd say don't turn it on turn on fox
[29:56] news
[29:56] turn on all these uh uh all these media
[29:59] outlets
[30:00] and you'll realize that they are masters
[30:02] at changing the way you think
[30:05] and they've done this amen for many
[30:07] years but we've seen it
[30:10] rampant amen especially in this last
[30:12] year right
[30:13] through social media through they can
[30:15] they can
[30:16] turn you off at any moment they want to
[30:18] if you're not going by their narrative
[30:20] that's right
[30:23] amen they're masters at changing
[30:25] perception
[30:26] amen praise god last year we were
[30:29] hearing about corrode and virus numbers
[30:30] around this time
[30:31] we don't hear about it anymore it's
[30:33] something different now
[30:35] so you're not even thinking about the
[30:37] numbers anymore you're not even looking
[30:39] at the chart anymore
[30:40] the chart where is that chart by the way
[30:42] no no but see in the philippines they
[30:44] still
[30:44] are right in the philippines they think
[30:48] right here in america we are going
[30:50] through
[30:51] all this asian hate that's going on in
[30:53] the media that people are beating up
[30:55] asians and stuff like that
[30:56] they think that that's going on around
[30:58] here in america yeah
[31:00] but we know that's not the reality right
[31:02] right but in the philippines they think
[31:04] oh my goodness
[31:05] you guys must i don't want to go to
[31:06] america right now and i i tell the
[31:08] brother brother there's nothing going on
[31:10] down here
[31:11] it's don't believe what the media tells
[31:12] you
[31:14] don't believe everything they tell you
[31:17] you and me no different right you and me
[31:19] know the reality amen
[31:21] you see amen praise god
[31:24] but saints that is why even though our
[31:27] lens amen our lens of perception might
[31:29] be distorted amen
[31:31] that's why god tells us amen to look at
[31:34] look through the lens of his holy spirit
[31:36] amen because looking through the lens of
[31:38] the word
[31:39] amen right brother the the word is never
[31:42] distorted
[31:44] the word is never incorrect the word is
[31:46] never crooked the word never has damage
[31:49] in it
[31:49] and you will always be able to look at
[31:51] something exactly the way it needs to be
[31:53] looked at amen
[31:54] amen and it is not your opinion it's not
[31:57] my opinion it's
[31:58] it's what god said and that's what
[32:00] matters do you want to help somebody
[32:03] even out there in the nominal world amen
[32:05] you want to help somebody
[32:06] don't give them your opinions your
[32:08] common ground that you have with them is
[32:10] the word amen
[32:11] right you will help somebody amen with
[32:13] the word
[32:14] but don't give them your opinions
[32:15] because they can't they can't receive
[32:17] that
[32:17] amen something will tell them hey that's
[32:19] your perception of things that's right
[32:21] but when you show it in the word
[32:23] there's no way to deny that it's in the
[32:25] word
[32:26] amen and if you believe that god said
[32:28] what he said in his word and that this
[32:30] is his word
[32:31] amen there's no way amen to say i can't
[32:34] believe that amen
[32:35] amen praise god so
[32:38] we need the lens of the holy spirit to
[32:41] help us
[32:42] look and judge things the right way now
[32:45] i said judge amen
[32:47] amen remember that jesus said judge not
[32:49] lest
[32:50] ye be judged that's right amen i'm going
[32:52] to repeat that again judge not lest ye
[32:54] be judged and
[32:56] and and in matthew chapter seven and
[32:58] just read here real quick and
[33:00] and i wanted to read this for the
[33:01] benefit of our young people as well amen
[33:04] through the um uh con it's the
[33:07] contemporary english version
[33:08] so it's just that you would understand a
[33:11] little bit much easier it says don't
[33:12] condemn
[33:12] others and god won't condemn you
[33:16] god will be as hard on you as you are on
[33:19] others
[33:21] he will treat you exactly as you treat
[33:23] them
[33:25] you can see the speck in your friend's
[33:27] eye but you don't notice the log
[33:29] in your own eye
[33:33] that's this is our just jesus own words
[33:35] how can you say
[33:36] my friend let me take the speck out of
[33:39] your eye
[33:41] when you don't even see the log that's
[33:42] in your own eye
[33:45] how can i help brother dale with
[33:46] something amen when i need help myself
[33:49] that's right man i'm not going to be
[33:50] able to see right to help him
[33:52] amen with whatever if i got something
[33:54] that's blocking my way
[33:56] you're nothing but show-offs
[33:59] that's what verse 5 says you're nothing
[34:03] but show-offs
[34:04] first take out the log take the log out
[34:07] of your own eye and then you can see how
[34:09] to take the speck out of your friend's
[34:11] eye
[34:12] amen jesus own words now you can go back
[34:16] and read it pretty much says the same
[34:17] thing
[34:18] um uh in the king james version amen
[34:21] and then first corinthians chapter four
[34:23] verse five says therefore judge
[34:25] nothing before the time right right amen
[34:29] until the lord come who both will bring
[34:31] the light to light the hidden things of
[34:33] darkness
[34:34] and we'll make manifest the councils of
[34:36] the hearts
[34:37] and then shall every man have praise of
[34:39] god amen
[34:40] so we have no business judging one
[34:42] another
[34:43] let god do the judging right amen we
[34:46] have
[34:47] we have no business you have your
[34:48] opinion that's fine that's perfectly
[34:50] fine
[34:51] but don't let it be the reality and
[34:53] don't let that be the reality amen to
[34:56] just share with others and say that that
[34:58] yeah that's how i see it this way and
[35:00] that's how no right
[35:01] amen let god be the judge of that
[35:03] because i believe that's the christian
[35:05] attitude right
[35:06] you agree with that praise the lord amen
[35:10] i mean i the reason why i was looking
[35:12] into this because this week i was i was
[35:14] listening there was a video that came
[35:16] online some of you all may have seen it
[35:19] it's by a a man he's it's a black man
[35:22] his name was
[35:22] is ty smith i believe is his last name
[35:25] and
[35:26] he was um talking to a group of parents
[35:29] at a at a
[35:30] school board meeting and he was telling
[35:33] them about how he
[35:34] totally disagreed with what what you
[35:36] might have heard in the media about
[35:38] critical race theory and it's a big
[35:41] thing
[35:42] that pretty much is is pushing
[35:45] your children to be racist that's pretty
[35:48] much what is what is doing
[35:49] in the name of not being racist right it
[35:53] hides behind this that's what blm
[35:55] and all these groups do they hide behind
[35:57] that
[35:58] we're not racist but yet but yet there's
[36:00] there's there's
[36:01] uh there's a communism behind it you
[36:04] know that
[36:05] that that's that's it's wrong it's evil
[36:08] and uh but anyways so ty smith and i
[36:12] thought my goodness that that what he
[36:13] had to say i thought that was that was
[36:15] that was good but
[36:16] he told he told a story of an experience
[36:18] that he had when he was a little kid in
[36:20] elementary school
[36:21] and he said when i was in elementary
[36:23] school i played with all my friends i
[36:25] had i had white
[36:26] friends i had hispanic friends i had i
[36:28] had black friends you know everybody was
[36:30] my friend
[36:31] kids don't think the way sometimes we
[36:33] think amen and i'm so thankful that they
[36:35] they don't my man they're they're
[36:37] innocent they're pure amen
[36:39] but this as we get older man we start
[36:41] thinking that we're better than
[36:42] somebody else and and that's when you
[36:44] need the holy ghost
[36:46] amen but he said
[36:49] until they started going to lunch now at
[36:52] the lunch
[36:53] because he couldn't afford they couldn't
[36:55] afford to to take
[36:56] lunch to school so uh there was the kids
[36:59] that could afford to take lunch to
[37:01] school
[37:02] um so they had their own sack lunches
[37:06] and their lunch box pretty lunch box and
[37:08] things like that
[37:08] and they got to go you know they lined
[37:10] them up first you know
[37:12] and then they said he said now i had a
[37:15] ticket you know to get free lunch
[37:17] at school and so he the teacher would
[37:20] say
[37:20] the teacher was just told to do these
[37:22] things it wasn't even her fault
[37:25] i was told to go to the back of the line
[37:28] and it wasn't just because of his skin
[37:30] color it was just if you had the ticket
[37:32] you know
[37:32] because you were getting school lunch
[37:34] right so anybody who had the ticket
[37:37] and he said that because of that he
[37:39] started looking
[37:40] at all his other friends that he would
[37:42] play on the playground with and
[37:44] he would have no problems with until
[37:46] lunch came around
[37:47] he'd start looking at him in the wrong
[37:49] way yeah so
[37:50] those kids didn't have no idea what was
[37:53] going on they were just obeying the
[37:55] the the teachers orders as well so the
[37:58] the kid those kids would be eating lunch
[38:00] and they would wave high at thai
[38:03] and and he'd look at him in the wrong
[38:05] way because he thinks that they're
[38:06] making fun of
[38:07] making fun of him yeah because they're
[38:09] over there like ah we got to go
[38:11] first and and you didn't get to go that
[38:13] was his perception
[38:15] of the the reason they were saying hello
[38:17] to him and so
[38:18] uh he was being mean to them uh because
[38:22] he thought that they were being mean to
[38:23] him but
[38:25] see they and so they now they had
[38:27] distorted perceptions
[38:29] and so now those those kids who got to
[38:32] go first in the lunch line
[38:33] they would go to the teacher and say uh
[38:36] teacher tai
[38:37] is being mean to me and so the teacher
[38:40] would go to the
[38:41] to tie and say well what now ty why why
[38:43] are you being mean to him
[38:44] and he could not explain what was going
[38:46] on he couldn't explain well
[38:49] i don't want to hang out with them
[38:50] anymore i don't want to be around them
[38:51] they'd be they'd go to
[38:53] to to recess and everything and there
[38:55] was just that tension
[38:57] nothing that he did nothing that those
[38:59] other kids did nothing
[39:00] not even the teacher it was just a whole
[39:04] situation that was put on them
[39:06] that changed the perception of
[39:08] everybody's perception
[39:09] right he later realized what it was of
[39:12] course you know he matured and he's a
[39:14] he's a preacher
[39:15] he's a minister now i thought that was
[39:16] an excellent example
[39:18] of how satan plays with one another in
[39:20] such ways
[39:21] that you're perceiving such a brother
[39:23] this way because he said this
[39:25] or you're perceiving such a sister that
[39:28] she said this
[39:29] or i heard that she thought this of you
[39:31] or this that or the other
[39:32] let me tell you what that is the point
[39:34] right there when you need to nip it in
[39:36] the butt
[39:37] amen nip it in the butt and just get rid
[39:39] of and satan get the behind me and stuf
[39:41] and that thing will just get get taken
[39:43] care of amen
[39:45] don't play around with it amen don't let
[39:47] satan amen get a full hold of that thing
[39:49] because let me tell you it'll run
[39:51] rampant
[39:51] all over the church amen and then you
[39:53] realize we'll be all
[39:55] looking at one another amen and
[39:56] wondering what's going on and we realize
[39:59] satan is just in our middle amen just
[40:01] tripping us all up amen
[40:04] the bible says amen we fight not flesh
[40:06] and blood but
[40:07] but but powers and principalities amen
[40:10] spirits
[40:11] amen they're in there we don't fight one
[40:13] another amen we fight satan
[40:15] amen amen when jesus told this
[40:19] uh peter he said when when peter was
[40:22] telling him no you're not going
[40:24] to the cross or he he rebuked peter amen
[40:26] he rebuked satan he said get thee behind
[40:28] me satan
[40:30] but it was it was because satan was
[40:31] using his brother amen was using peter
[40:34] amen it wasn't necessarily for peter
[40:36] amen he knew satan was behind that
[40:39] amen praise god so we got to realize
[40:41] amen what
[40:43] causes amen sometimes tensions amongst
[40:45] us it's not one another
[40:47] it's satan amen and satan
[40:51] and and saints it's too late of the hour
[40:54] saints amen too late in the hour amen
[40:56] for us to
[40:57] to be uh uh just playing around with
[41:00] these things amen
[41:02] and just letting satan just do whatever
[41:04] amen such and such
[41:05] i hear this this i heard this that and
[41:07] the other oh look what such and such
[41:08] person is doing on
[41:09] on instagram look at what such a person
[41:11] is doing on facebook look where they're
[41:12] going today amen
[41:13] hey man let's just let god handle it
[41:15] right and we'll look here in just a
[41:17] moment as something
[41:18] an example of of of a story here in
[41:21] perception amen
[41:22] praise god now uh so i thought that
[41:24] story was pretty interesting about ty
[41:26] smith now look what brother brown says
[41:27] here
[41:28] that um in regards to we've got to look
[41:30] at things through the lens of the word
[41:32] of god amen brother braham says here in
[41:34] the
[41:34] in in the message a guide in 1962
[41:38] he says the god has understanding
[41:41] how to go and what to do amen god
[41:44] god has always sent a god to his people
[41:48] god has never failed amen
[41:51] he sends a guide but you've got to
[41:54] accept that guy
[41:56] see see you've got to believe it you've
[41:59] got to go the way
[42:00] he says if you get into a wilderness or
[42:03] in the woods and your god says we got to
[42:05] go this way and you and yet you think
[42:07] you go that way
[42:09] uh uh you you're going to come up lost
[42:13] in other words if you think that you
[42:14] there's another way to to make it you're
[42:16] going to come up lost
[42:17] then when god sends us a god to us
[42:21] we've got to follow that god no matter
[42:24] what we think
[42:26] what looks reasonable and what looks
[42:28] ridiculous
[42:29] we're not subjects to divide that the
[42:32] god is the only one amen
[42:34] amen so the god is the holy ghost
[42:37] amen the god is his word to us
[42:41] praise god and it doesn't matter what we
[42:43] think about
[42:44] it what our opinions are that's our
[42:46] perceptions
[42:47] what's the reality because the reality
[42:50] will
[42:50] always trump perceptions amen
[42:53] perceptions
[42:54] is is just your opinions it's not the
[42:56] reality
[42:58] amen praise god so and and and that just
[43:00] goes along with us moving by feelings
[43:03] amen it's so easy to just move by
[43:05] feelings especially our sisters amen
[43:07] it's just easy to move by feelings amen
[43:10] and then when a and we have to learn
[43:13] amen that we got to move amen according
[43:15] to the reality of the word of god amen
[43:17] praise the lord i'm reminded in the
[43:20] bible of
[43:20] the of the story of of of elisha with
[43:23] his servant amen how many remember that
[43:25] right
[43:25] when the syrian army the king was going
[43:28] to try to take over israel
[43:30] and there was a moment where uh the the
[43:33] there was horses everywhere from the
[43:35] syrians surrounding
[43:36] that specific area where elisha and
[43:39] and his servant were there and elisha's
[43:42] servant
[43:43] saw the reality of amen
[43:47] of all these horses and all these all
[43:49] these people
[43:50] all these this army getting ready to
[43:52] attack israel yeah
[43:55] but i like what what uh what what elisha
[43:58] says that we could just read just a few
[44:00] little verses from there
[44:02] and i want us to take something from
[44:03] there he says in second kings
[44:05] chapter 6 verse 15 through 17 you can go
[44:07] home and read the
[44:08] whole story yourself but he says and
[44:10] when the servant of the man of god was
[44:12] risen early and gone forth behold and
[44:14] host
[44:15] compassed the city both with horses and
[44:18] chariots and his servants said unto him
[44:20] alas my master
[44:21] how shall we do in other words what are
[44:23] we going to do
[44:25] and elisha and he answered fear not
[44:29] amen wasn't that the same words that
[44:31] jesus said
[44:33] fear not for they that be with us
[44:36] are more than they that be with them
[44:39] amen
[44:40] now let's just say if i was elijah's
[44:43] servant and you were right there and
[44:44] elisha was telling me like that and then
[44:46] you look over at her
[44:48] what are you talking about yeah yeah i
[44:51] mean i see
[44:51] all the syrian army around us and you're
[44:53] saying that there's more of us
[44:55] amen than there are of them what in the
[44:58] world
[44:59] right it looked foolish but see his
[45:02] servant was looking through it through
[45:04] the lens
[45:04] of his of his his own perception
[45:08] he saw that that's how things were
[45:10] therefore he thought that that's how
[45:11] they were
[45:12] amen so
[45:16] and in verse 17 it says and elisha
[45:18] prayed and said
[45:19] lord i pray thee open his eyes that he
[45:22] may see
[45:23] right now i i was thinking about
[45:26] us as parents amen when i was reading
[45:28] this
[45:29] because sometimes our children saints
[45:32] those who who have who have
[45:33] children right now that are growing up
[45:35] we can't make them see things
[45:37] on their own right we uh
[45:40] we can't we can't do the work for them
[45:43] right
[45:44] now amen it has to be god to do the work
[45:46] okay man
[45:47] and look elisha is like okay i can't
[45:49] make my servant see this
[45:51] he elisha couldn't do it as much as as
[45:54] much of god that he had in his life
[45:56] as much as the of the power of god that
[45:58] he had in his life yet he could not make
[46:00] his servant
[46:01] see to change his perception of what was
[46:04] going on
[46:06] amen it took prayer amen for him to do
[46:09] it
[46:10] and watch and he says and the lord
[46:11] opened the eyes of the young man
[46:14] amen it was the lord and he saw and
[46:16] behold the mountain was full of horses
[46:19] and chariots of fire right round the
[46:22] body elisha
[46:23] so you knew amen there was chariots
[46:25] there but they weren't chariots of fire
[46:27] these were chariots of fire
[46:29] after the lord opened his eyes amen he
[46:31] knew then that there was other beings
[46:33] there
[46:33] praise god so you see saints us as
[46:36] parents
[46:37] we could not change our children would
[46:39] they have to come and have their own
[46:41] experience with god
[46:42] the best thing that you and i can do
[46:44] amen is pray for them
[46:46] get down on your knees and pray for them
[46:48] saints and and and watch
[46:50] god amen do the work amen god is the one
[46:54] that can change hearts
[46:55] god is the one that can open the blinded
[46:57] eyes god is the one that can make people
[46:59] see things
[47:00] a different way amen sometimes we can't
[47:03] do it
[47:04] that's fine but we have a god that can
[47:06] make not make any mistake
[47:08] as brother branham said he said that our
[47:10] god amen
[47:12] our god has never failed no amen we
[47:14] cannot do it but he can
[47:16] praise god amen
[47:19] i want to look at another example the
[47:21] woman at the well
[47:22] amen praise god her reality was that she
[47:26] was a prostitute
[47:27] right she had five husbands and she
[47:30] the one that even the one that was she
[47:32] was living with at the moment was not
[47:34] even her husband
[47:36] that was her reality amen and her
[47:39] perception was is that there was no
[47:41] other way for me to live besides this
[47:43] way
[47:44] amen there was no way out of that type
[47:46] of life for her right
[47:48] that was her perception right i mean how
[47:51] sometimes
[47:52] we we think that this is how my life is
[47:55] i don't know if it'll ever change from
[47:57] this this is how i've grown up
[47:59] this is and that is just your perception
[48:03] right you have to realize especially uh
[48:05] us young people
[48:07] young people look at yourself in the
[48:10] in this way god put you here on earth to
[48:13] fulfill his purpose
[48:16] amen so you're not here just to occupy
[48:20] space you're here to fulfill something
[48:23] for him
[48:23] right now whether it whether it's going
[48:26] to be now or whether it's going to be
[48:28] in two years or whether it's going to be
[48:29] in 10 years god knows
[48:31] but you're not here just to be here amen
[48:34] you're here for a purpose
[48:36] amen and god knows exactly all we got to
[48:38] do is get into that lens amen
[48:41] let that lens look through the eyes
[48:44] through the eyes of the word
[48:45] amen in regards to your life and god
[48:47] will show you exactly what you need to
[48:49] do
[48:50] but when we're out doing other things
[48:52] and we're out just
[48:53] paying more attention doing other things
[48:56] more than what we do for god
[48:58] then don't expect for there to be any
[49:01] spiritual changes in your life
[49:04] if if all you're worried about is is
[49:06] something else in your life besides god
[49:09] don't expect for god to increase in your
[49:11] life
[49:12] you see god is going to actually
[49:15] decrease more in your life
[49:17] but when you give more time for god that
[49:20] means god is increasing in your life
[49:23] right and then you will see the results
[49:26] of that
[49:27] praise the lord amen i'm just trying to
[49:29] make it as simple as i can
[49:33] because i i'm a dummy and i have to be
[49:34] taught that way too
[49:37] amen make it simple for me amen
[49:41] praise god but that was the woman at the
[49:42] wells that was her perception amen right
[49:45] and her perception was changed amen when
[49:47] the reality of realities told her all
[49:50] things amen
[49:51] amen remember jesus she told uh
[49:54] jesus she says that when messiah cometh
[49:57] he'll tell us all these things
[50:00] and you know what jesus did that for her
[50:03] and
[50:04] and because jesus did that for her
[50:07] told her all the all these things she
[50:09] ran
[50:10] left her water pot assad and said come
[50:13] see a man who's
[50:14] told me all these things right my
[50:16] brother
[50:17] all things the bible says there that
[50:19] told me all things
[50:21] because see she told jesus that when
[50:23] messiah cometh he will tell us
[50:24] all things right she had that in her
[50:27] life as a foundation
[50:29] because she had heard the word amen do
[50:31] you see
[50:32] you see and i say this to everyone but
[50:34] but but
[50:35] but to our young people don't neglect
[50:38] any part of the word that you may
[50:40] understand in your life
[50:42] no matter how simple it is hold to that
[50:46] hold to that because you see so you see
[50:48] the woman at the well she held to that
[50:50] she she held to that fact that her mom
[50:53] or her
[50:54] dad or a brother or somebody told her
[50:56] hey
[50:57] when messiah comes he will tell us all
[51:00] things
[51:01] and when messiah did come and told her
[51:04] all
[51:04] things of her life that completely
[51:08] changed her man but it had to be the
[51:11] word first
[51:12] the word came forth first to her and she
[51:15] retained that she's
[51:17] no matter what happened in her life no
[51:19] matter how satan destroyed
[51:20] her life the way the way she got she
[51:23] held on to that word
[51:24] amen and that word amen changed her
[51:27] amen so her perception her perception of
[51:31] the way she saw herself
[51:33] do you think it stayed the same
[51:36] i believe it changed from then on amen
[51:39] because the reality of reality is amen
[51:42] kicked in and changed it all for her
[51:44] who's the reality of realities we know
[51:46] it was christ
[51:47] amen praise the lord jesus amen that's
[51:49] right
[51:50] so she had that as that foundation amen
[51:54] now i i want us to understand too that
[51:58] our perceptions of someone determines
[52:01] our relationships with them
[52:03] amen we talked about this just a little
[52:05] bit amen
[52:06] that the way we see somebody is the way
[52:10] we are going to receive them in our life
[52:13] or not
[52:13] or not amen and our perception uh
[52:18] of of of god
[52:21] determines how our relationship with him
[52:23] is as well
[52:25] you see if we you know maybe if i might
[52:28] ask
[52:28] brother dale what do you think of god
[52:30] you know well he might
[52:32] say he might give what he thinks of god
[52:34] you know what what god is to him right
[52:36] my ass zach what god is to you amen he
[52:39] will tell
[52:40] tell me i might ask lord jonas back
[52:43] there what god is to him
[52:44] now he's going to give me what god is to
[52:46] him in
[52:48] in his in his perception
[52:52] but you see there is a reality amen
[52:54] there is a reality
[52:56] of what god is amen right praise god and
[52:59] so whatever you think of what god is
[53:02] is how your relationship with god is
[53:03] going to be right right exactly
[53:05] if you think that if you think like a
[53:07] catholic for example i grew up as a
[53:09] catholic
[53:10] so i had the mentality that if that
[53:13] that god was just an angry god all the
[53:16] time
[53:17] and if i did wrong and if i didn't do
[53:19] the things that i was supposed to do
[53:21] that lightning bolt was just going
[53:23] through that ceiling at any moment
[53:25] and strike me upside the head and i was
[53:28] gonna just be walking around with a
[53:29] crispy head the rest of my day
[53:34] but you know you see that was my
[53:35] perception because
[53:37] of of a past experience of what i was
[53:40] taught of what i was told
[53:42] you see but we know that that's not what
[53:43] god is about right right
[53:45] because i don't see anyone here with
[53:47] crispy head
[53:51] amen god is not a god of of
[53:54] of he's not just a he's a god of
[53:56] judgment we know that
[53:57] he's also a god of love amen amen
[54:00] amen praise god so however you look at
[54:04] god right now is the way is how your
[54:06] your relationship is going to be with
[54:07] him amen
[54:09] so if you look at god as as for example
[54:12] an inviting one
[54:14] an inviting person hey come
[54:17] and i will give you rest right then what
[54:19] are you going to do
[54:20] you're going to come because you see him
[54:23] as
[54:24] an inviting one but if you see him as
[54:26] somebody you better
[54:28] straighten up before you come to me amen
[54:30] and that's how you're going to perceive
[54:32] god that's going to be your relationship
[54:33] with god
[54:34] praise god so and again the
[54:38] it's the same way with a person amen
[54:40] right you see a person a certain way
[54:42] then that's how you're gonna treat be
[54:43] around them that's right right
[54:44] man if i see zach a certain way amen if
[54:47] i look at him a certain way
[54:48] that's how i'm gonna treat him right you
[54:50] see
[54:51] i'm maybe more comfortable with him or
[54:54] not you see
[54:55] but if you perceive somebody a certain
[54:56] way you think oh my goodness they're
[54:58] going to snap at me at any moment
[55:00] you you you kind of back off a little
[55:02] bit you see your relationship is kind of
[55:04] because that's your perception of that
[55:06] person but it just behooves us saying
[55:08] say man to just get to know people
[55:11] get to know people and i tell that to
[55:13] our young people say
[55:15] you know get to know people because
[55:17] people in reality really want to get to
[55:19] know you
[55:22] you see right brother they really do
[55:24] it's not it's not that they
[55:25] they they're they're trying to be
[55:27] standoffish and better
[55:29] than you and stuff like that no right i
[55:32] i always told my girls i said you wanna
[55:33] you wanna have a friend be a friend
[55:36] amen i had to learn that in in in life
[55:39] amen especially as you grow older my mom
[55:43] tells me that
[55:44] when i was younger i was always in the
[55:46] neighbors houses uh
[55:48] and just talking to them and and i was
[55:50] just chitter chatter everywhere as i
[55:52] started getting older i started kind of
[55:54] getting away from that a little bit you
[55:56] see
[55:57] uh uh but then you have to you have to
[56:00] realize well
[56:02] you want to have friends you be friends
[56:04] amen
[56:05] you want to be friends praise god
[56:09] now let's read again matthew chapter 16
[56:12] verse 13 through 20.
[56:18] and just take a few points from there
[56:20] when jesus came into the coast of
[56:21] caesarea philippi
[56:22] he asked his disciples saying whom the
[56:24] man say that i
[56:26] the son of man am amen
[56:30] now you notice that jesus said i the son
[56:32] of man
[56:33] praise god because he was the son of man
[56:36] he always referred to himself as the son
[56:38] of man praise the lord
[56:39] and they said and they said the
[56:42] disciples said because jesus was asking
[56:44] the disciples and they said
[56:46] some say that thou art john the baptist
[56:49] some elias and others jeremiahs are one
[56:52] of the prophets now you notice
[56:54] that what they were telling him that
[56:55] people thought of jesus
[56:57] was that jesus was a a was one of these
[57:00] dead men that had already dead
[57:02] and was resurrected and they didn't
[57:05] equivilate jesus with somebody
[57:07] a live living a a present day man that
[57:11] was born in their day
[57:14] what the disciples were telling jesus
[57:16] was that he was a resurrected person
[57:18] that came from the grave
[57:19] amen and he's walking amongst the people
[57:23] equivalating jesus with death
[57:26] think about that all right father amen
[57:30] and he said in jesus verse 15 he saith
[57:33] unto them but
[57:34] but now the people say that but now what
[57:37] do you say
[57:38] in other words what do you think of god
[57:43] he said he said unto them but whom say
[57:45] ye that i am right
[57:48] and simon peter answered and said
[57:51] thou art the christ the son
[57:54] of the living god amen
[57:57] and you see that was a revelation to
[58:00] peter amen praise god
[58:05] in verse 17 and jesus answered and said
[58:07] unto him blessed art thou simon barjona
[58:09] for
[58:09] flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[58:12] unto thee but my father which is in
[58:14] heaven
[58:15] and nice and i say also unto thee thou
[58:18] art
[58:18] peter and upon this rock i will build my
[58:22] church and the gates of hell shall not
[58:24] prevail against it
[58:25] see so now peter had a revelation that
[58:28] this wasn't just a dead man walking
[58:30] amongst us
[58:32] amen this was jesus christ the son of
[58:35] god amen
[58:36] praise the lord and i will give unto
[58:38] thee the keys of the kingdom verse 19
[58:40] and who whatsoever thou shalt abide on
[58:43] earth shall be bound in heaven
[58:44] whatsoever thou shalt lose on earth
[58:46] shall be loosed in heaven in verse 20
[58:48] says then charged he his
[58:50] disciples that they should tell no man
[58:53] that he was jesus the christ amen in
[58:56] other words he was telling them not to
[58:57] tell
[58:58] not don't change people's perception of
[59:00] me
[59:01] let them think that that's fine you keep
[59:05] it
[59:05] you keep it to yourself saying
[59:07] eventually they would eventually tell
[59:09] peter will eventually tell people who he
[59:12] really was amen
[59:13] after he received the holy ghost but you
[59:15] see so
[59:16] the people had this perception of jesus
[59:19] but in reality what was jesus
[59:22] jesus wasn't interested really in what
[59:23] the people out there
[59:25] thought of him he really wanted to see
[59:27] what his disciples thought of him
[59:29] amen praise god and so that is that is
[59:32] what god wants us to know saints is what
[59:34] do you think of god
[59:36] amen i mean you some of you have been in
[59:40] this message for
[59:41] for years amen has your perception or
[59:44] has your reality of god
[59:45] has it changed from when it was when you
[59:47] first came in
[59:49] to what it is now right or is it the
[59:51] same thing
[59:53] has nothing changed in your life and
[59:55] just the the little time that
[59:57] that peter was with jesus
[1:00:01] his perception of jesus changed a lot
[1:00:04] and that was before the holy ghost at
[1:00:07] first
[1:00:08] heath probably peter probably thought
[1:00:09] that jesus was just a fisherman
[1:00:12] because that's how he met him because
[1:00:15] that's why
[1:00:15] that's what jesus told them hey let let
[1:00:17] go the net over here toss it to the
[1:00:19] other
[1:00:19] other side and he probably thought that
[1:00:22] hey man this is a master fisherman
[1:00:24] but then he realized that this is more
[1:00:26] than just a fisherman
[1:00:29] this is more than just a fisherman but
[1:00:30] he kept going amen
[1:00:32] he kept going amen and and then he
[1:00:35] realized
[1:00:35] my goodness this this man is not just a
[1:00:38] fisherman
[1:00:40] but he can actually take fish and make a
[1:00:43] lot more fish out of
[1:00:44] and not just a lot more fish but it's
[1:00:47] actually cooked fish
[1:00:48] and fed about 10 000 people so now
[1:00:51] peter's perception is growing and
[1:00:54] changing wow my goodness
[1:00:55] he's not just a fisherman but he's a
[1:00:58] creator as well
[1:01:00] and now his perception changed to a
[1:01:02] revelation that he is the christ the son
[1:01:05] of god
[1:01:05] amen but it took peter amen to continue
[1:01:08] walking with jesus in order for that to
[1:01:10] change
[1:01:12] don't just settle for just your one
[1:01:15] revelation
[1:01:16] continue in the gospel continue in the
[1:01:19] word
[1:01:19] continue in the reading continuing
[1:01:22] coming to church
[1:01:23] continue amen and you will realize that
[1:01:25] your perception or
[1:01:27] your revelation that's what we use
[1:01:30] the revelation of who he is will
[1:01:33] continue to grow in your life
[1:01:36] and you will perceive god differently
[1:01:38] amen you know
[1:01:40] uh the woman at the well i forgot to
[1:01:41] mention this she said i perceive that
[1:01:43] they are a prophet
[1:01:44] amen right i perceive because my
[1:01:48] foundation was told to me that
[1:01:50] hey when the prophet comes he'll tell us
[1:01:52] all these things
[1:01:53] share our perception was right it was a
[1:01:56] reality
[1:01:58] amen amen brother branham says here he
[1:02:02] says
[1:02:03] he said but who do you say it isn't what

[1:02:18] it with the word

[1:02:24] living god

[1:02:35] mention this real quick
[1:02:37] and then i'm going to show something
[1:02:38] else here a little quick little video so
[1:02:40] don't fall asleep on me yeah
[1:02:42] yeah we're going to show videos now all
[1:02:44] right don't fall asleep
[1:02:46] all right um let's turn to revelations
[1:02:50] chapter five real quick the brothers
[1:02:51] didn't get this but i i wanted to i want
[1:02:53] to show
[1:02:54] just look at something here real quick
[1:02:56] revelations chapter five
[1:02:58] let's just read from verse one through
[1:03:00] six
[1:03:02] now this here in revelations chapter
[1:03:04] five is
[1:03:05] john amen um
[1:03:09] looking at the right hand of the one of
[1:03:10] the of the book that was covered with
[1:03:12] with which what they were sealed amen
[1:03:16] and it says there in verse 1 and i saw
[1:03:18] in the right hand of him this is john
[1:03:19] now
[1:03:20] speaking and i saw in the right hand of
[1:03:22] him that sat on the throne
[1:03:24] a book written within and on the
[1:03:27] backside
[1:03:27] sealed with seven seals
[1:03:31] so it was a book that was that was
[1:03:33] totally sealed it was closed off amen
[1:03:36] with seven seals and i saw a strong
[1:03:38] angel proclaiming with a loud voice
[1:03:41] who is worthy to open the book and to
[1:03:44] lose the seals thereof
[1:03:46] now imagine if you were john and when
[1:03:49] and when
[1:03:50] you're looking at this at this panoramic
[1:03:52] and you're looking at this scene
[1:03:53] unfolding before your eyes
[1:03:55] and and you hear this voice of this
[1:03:57] angel saying
[1:03:59] who is worthy to open uh
[1:04:02] the book and to loose the seals thereof
[1:04:04] because i'm sure
[1:04:06] that john wanted to know what was in
[1:04:08] that book
[1:04:10] my goodness i mean uh if if you ever
[1:04:13] watched an indiana jones movie and you
[1:04:15] saw uh what what
[1:04:16] what if they had a book that was closed
[1:04:18] with some seals that
[1:04:20] there was it was it was something that
[1:04:22] everybody was looking for
[1:04:23] you know and and and everybody was
[1:04:25] trying to find and it was like a
[1:04:27] it was something secret but yet you know
[1:04:29] needed to be found
[1:04:30] and we want to know what it was in that
[1:04:32] book right right well i'm sure john felt
[1:04:34] the exact same way
[1:04:35] amen and verse 3 it says and no
[1:04:40] man in heaven nor in earth neither under
[1:04:42] the earth
[1:04:43] was able to open the book neither to
[1:04:47] look there on
[1:04:50] and i'm sure john was really sad because
[1:04:54] look what what verse 4 says
[1:04:56] he says and i wept much in other words i
[1:04:59] cried a lot because no man was found
[1:05:03] worthy to open
[1:05:04] and to read the book neither to look
[1:05:07] thereon
[1:05:08] amen so no man was worthy on earth
[1:05:11] in earth anywhere to
[1:05:14] to open this book to unloose those seals
[1:05:18] they could not even they could not even
[1:05:20] touch it not even look upon
[1:05:22] it the bible says amen they could not
[1:05:23] even look upon it
[1:05:25] and he and john got really sad now you
[1:05:28] put yourself in john's shoes
[1:05:30] you know would would you have god said i
[1:05:32] probably would have gotten
[1:05:33] sad i'm sad my what is it in this book
[1:05:37] that no man is able to to look upon
[1:05:40] and one of the elders verse 5 and one of
[1:05:42] the elders saith unto me
[1:05:44] now watch this is when see john's
[1:05:46] perception of things
[1:05:48] was a certain way see he looked and saw
[1:05:53] and perceived no man can open this book
[1:05:57] there's no way and don't satan
[1:06:01] sometimes does like that to us in our
[1:06:02] life there is no way that i'm coming out
[1:06:05] of this
[1:06:06] no way that i can have victory over this
[1:06:09] this thing's already sealed in my life
[1:06:11] and i i grew up this way
[1:06:14] and this is a curse on my life and and
[1:06:17] and you know what the seals
[1:06:20] this book was sealed and yet we know
[1:06:22] that it was opened later on
[1:06:25] so god can open up anything in your life
[1:06:27] amen he can break
[1:06:29] anything in your life no matter how
[1:06:30] tight it is how clo
[1:06:32] how how how hard do you think it might
[1:06:34] be uh to to get away from
[1:06:37] right god is more than able amen to open
[1:06:40] anything amen those seals of your life
[1:06:43] amen that's right brother
[1:06:44] praise god and and it says here and one
[1:06:48] of the elders saith unto me
[1:06:49] watch weep not don't cry john behold
[1:06:53] the lion of the tribe of judah the root
[1:06:55] of david
[1:06:56] hath prevailed to open the book
[1:06:59] and to loose the seven seals thereof now
[1:07:01] john is looking at
[1:07:02] john is weeping and he's got his
[1:07:04] perception is that nobody can open the
[1:07:06] book
[1:07:06] all of a sudden he hears and one of the
[1:07:09] elders tells him
[1:07:10] hey someone the lion of the tribe of
[1:07:12] judah the lion
[1:07:14] of the tribe of judah can open the book
[1:07:18] oh wow so there is building a hope in
[1:07:20] him right there's a hope building in him
[1:07:22] now
[1:07:23] and he knows okay there's a lion now so
[1:07:25] he's looking for the lion
[1:07:27] because he heard that there was going to
[1:07:29] be a lion right
[1:07:30] right his perception was a lion because
[1:07:33] that's what he was told
[1:07:35] but look what verse 6 says and i be held
[1:07:37] and low
[1:07:38] in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:07:41] four beasts
[1:07:42] and in the midst of the elders stood a
[1:07:45] lamb
[1:07:48] the elder said it was a lion
[1:07:51] but when he looked when john looked it
[1:07:54] was a lamb
[1:07:57] as it had been slain having seven horns
[1:07:59] and seven
[1:08:00] eyes which are the seven spirits of god
[1:08:03] sent forth into all the earth
[1:08:05] and watch what this lamb did and he says
[1:08:07] and what and he
[1:08:08] came and took the book out of the right
[1:08:10] hand of him that sat
[1:08:12] upon the throne and when he had taken
[1:08:14] the book
[1:08:15] when this lamb took the book the four
[1:08:18] beasts and four and twenty elders fell
[1:08:20] down before the lamb
[1:08:22] having every one of them harps and
[1:08:23] golden vowels full of odors
[1:08:25] which are the prayers of saints you know
[1:08:28] what saints that's that lamb
[1:08:30] and the one that was sitting on the
[1:08:31] throne was the same person amen
[1:08:34] it was the same god yes the whole time
[1:08:37] but see john's perception
[1:08:38] totally changed from thinking nobody
[1:08:40] could open the book
[1:08:42] to okay the lion can open the book but
[1:08:44] really it's a lamb
[1:08:47] a lamb you know that's the reality of it
[1:08:49] saints
[1:08:51] we this lamb that that john saw was
[1:08:53] bloody
[1:08:54] was slain was was was was
[1:08:57] was jesus didn't look good on the cross
[1:09:01] it's the most pitiful scene you've ever
[1:09:02] seen you'll never see a scene
[1:09:05] that's pitiful as that and yet we've
[1:09:07] never looked at i mean
[1:09:08] mel gibson didn't even touch it when he
[1:09:12] made the
[1:09:12] passion of the christ i mean just barely
[1:09:15] scratched the surface
[1:09:18] but that's what john saw and yet that is
[1:09:21] what god used
[1:09:23] to redeem amen to bring forth redemption
[1:09:26] and open back the seals for us
[1:09:28] amen so it wasn't it
[1:09:31] it's not it john could have seen it and
[1:09:33] stayed crying the whole time
[1:09:36] and no i won't i won't believe what
[1:09:38] you're saying elder i won't believe it
[1:09:39] this is how it is amen
[1:09:41] but god wants to show you a different
[1:09:42] reality
[1:09:44] that's not the way you think it is and
[1:09:46] it doesn't have to stay that way that's
[1:09:48] right
[1:09:48] amen there is forgiveness amen there is
[1:09:51] a feeling amen
[1:09:52] there is a salvation for you there is
[1:09:55] hope
[1:09:56] when you think there is no hope amen
[1:09:58] amen
[1:09:59] god has god has it all taken care of
[1:10:01] amen
[1:10:03] and it changed everything for john amen
[1:10:05] it changed everything
[1:10:06] for john and it can change everything
[1:10:08] for you oh yeah amen
[1:10:09] but just pay just just make sure that
[1:10:12] you hold this reality
[1:10:13] right before you instead of just your
[1:10:15] own perceptions
[1:10:17] amen amen praise god
[1:10:20] now if the brothers can just show that
[1:10:23] little video real quick
[1:10:25] now i'm just going to give you a little
[1:10:26] warning you just forget the video isn't
[1:10:28] bad
[1:10:29] it just makes a point it has no sound i
[1:10:32] took the sound from it
[1:10:34] so you know might show women in pajamas
[1:10:38] and stuff but it makes a point
[1:10:40] and and i hope that that that young
[1:10:42] people take a look at this because
[1:10:44] i want you to understand that the
[1:10:47] reality
[1:10:48] of what you might see on instagram or on
[1:10:51] facebook
[1:10:52] and all these things that's not reality
[1:10:55] an image is not a reality a picture
[1:10:58] that you see on on the internet is not a
[1:11:01] reality
[1:11:02] the reality is the actual person when
[1:11:05] you're with that person that's the
[1:11:07] reality
[1:11:08] a picture can be manipulated in any way
[1:11:12] especially nowadays so just just roll
[1:11:14] the the video
[1:11:17] uh brother why do you want to turn that
[1:11:19] off
[1:11:22] so here's this girl she gets up in the
[1:11:24] morning she's brushing her teeth
[1:11:26] putting fixing herself up
[1:11:29] takes a picture smiling very nice
[1:11:33] she's pretty and she says down at the
[1:11:35] bottom sophie good morning
[1:11:37] and uh she woke up like this hashtag
[1:11:41] woke up like this
[1:11:43] you know she didn't wake up like that so
[1:11:45] he gets it
[1:11:46] he gets that picture so he goes
[1:11:50] he takes a picture of himself and he
[1:11:53] says
[1:11:54] 30 kilometer bike ride done
[1:11:58] i didn't see a bike anywhere but that's
[1:12:00] what he made this girl think
[1:12:02] so it it makes her want to
[1:12:06] start fixing her desk
[1:12:09] all pretty
[1:12:13] but look at that corner right there and
[1:12:16] look where she writes she says becky
[1:12:17] getting organized hashtag
[1:12:19] creative something and so he looks at it
[1:12:23] so of course he takes a picture of his
[1:12:25] breakfast
[1:12:29] but he's like what in the world but i
[1:12:32] just buy
[1:12:32] throws it in the trash but then he says
[1:12:34] super healthy breakfast
[1:12:36] new me so he gets it
[1:12:40] he sees it and so now he's looking at
[1:12:42] himself in the mirror
[1:12:45] it's what satan does so now he's going
[1:12:47] through his wardrobe of clothes just
[1:12:49] changing look multiple pictures taken
[1:12:51] and
[1:12:51] and and now in his instagram he finally
[1:12:54] picks the right one it says
[1:12:55] uh yes styling effortly
[1:12:59] like he didn't take him no effort to get
[1:13:01] to that point
[1:13:03] so now here's a group supposed to be

[1:13:48] getting those likes those loves
[1:13:51] and that's what makes her smile
[1:13:56] that's the label when in reality it
[1:13:59] wasn't that way
[1:14:00] her her boyfriend was like like go do
[1:14:02] something else i'm busy
[1:14:04] but it made her smile that she was
[1:14:06] getting those likes or those loves and
[1:14:08] stuff like that
[1:14:08] saints and that's not our reality a
[1:14:11] reality is not

[1:14:48] reality of the word then don't take it
[1:14:50] don't accept it

[1:14:53] something that you'll never be able to
[1:14:54] obtain amen
[1:14:56] and that's what satan wants you to do
[1:14:58] amen chase
[1:14:59] rabbits and chase things in your life

[1:19:49] real
[1:19:50] but it has no foundation whatsoever so

[1:28:17] we'll do an outside bonfire

[1:29:02] uh part of what we're doing here at the
[1:29:04] church so we got a lot of youth coming
[1:29:05] up now we got some it's 13 more
[1:29:07] 13. we got a lot that's coming up right
[1:29:09] before that
[1:29:10] so uh if time goes on we want to be able
[1:29:14] to uh
[1:29:15] to like brother gary longor says we need
[1:29:18] to get to the kid before
[1:29:19] the devil does man so that's what i want
[1:29:22] us to do is to focus in
[1:29:24] um you say well brother wade i was
[1:29:27] thinking of the day people say well
[1:29:28] we're you know we're it's the end time
[1:29:29] we're getting out of here well we
[1:29:30] thought that 30 years ago
[1:29:32] when i was when y'all were others were
[1:29:34] you and i know there's time coming but
[1:29:36] still brother brown told us he said
[1:29:38] if you're planting potatoes and you know
[1:29:41] the lord's coming tomorrow
[1:29:42] just continue to plant your potatoes
[1:29:44] amen
[1:29:45] and we don't want to be we've never been
[1:29:47] a doomsday church
[1:29:49] right we want to we want you to live
[1:29:51] your life to the fullest
[1:29:53] in the glory of the lord and plan your
[1:29:54] instruments and we sure are proud of all
[1:29:57] the
[1:29:58] all the youth that we already have amen
[1:30:00] amen
[1:30:01] we are so proud of them and watching
[1:30:04] them
[1:30:05] the greatest thing that brother dale's
[1:30:06] always said the greatest gift you could
[1:30:08] ever give him
[1:30:09] is to act out there basically
[1:30:14] the same as you act in here when you go
[1:30:16] somewhere they said oh you're from
[1:30:18] spoken word church you you love to play
[1:30:20] your instruments
[1:30:21] so you some people go to florida
[1:30:28] and didn't even know they were going to
[1:30:29] play just having to take their
[1:30:30] instruments with them
[1:30:31] and they got to play a solo and then
[1:30:34] they got to play in the service and had
[1:30:35] a real good time
[1:30:36] they played for four hours straight
[1:30:40] four and a half hours straight they had
[1:30:42] a prayer line they had
[1:30:43] service after basically service after
[1:30:46] service
[1:30:46] and these two young ladies played for
[1:30:48] four and a half hours
[1:30:50] continually playing for the glory of the
[1:30:52] lord and man four and a half hours
[1:30:54] other people are doing other things but
[1:30:56] you know what god will honor that
[1:30:59] man he'll never it'll never return void
[1:31:02] what you do
[1:31:03] if you do it for the lord you got to do
[1:31:04] it for him first though and i believe
[1:31:06] these sisters did it for the lord first
[1:31:07] so
[1:31:08] i mean for four and a half hours man you
[1:31:10] get in a you get an anointing though and
[1:31:12] it really doesn't matter
[1:31:13] oh yeah all right you weren't sorry i
[1:31:15] mean your hands weren't sore tired
[1:31:19] don't look at me like that your hands
[1:31:21] weren't tired you had to quit
[1:31:23] but they did well so you know we thank
[1:31:25] the lord and that's a testament of what
[1:31:27] happens in the
[1:31:28] in the church here is that when our
[1:31:29] youth go to another place
[1:31:32] they act right because listen folks
[1:31:35] june and i were counselors for eight
[1:31:37] years in alabama
[1:31:39] we saw the best and the worst hey man
[1:31:43] june had to chase women and chase the
[1:31:45] little girls around with
[1:31:46] um lipstick writing lipstick all over
[1:31:49] the wall and
[1:31:49] trying to put on clothes it wasn't worth
[1:31:51] anything remember on the ceiling
[1:31:53] yeah exactly so we've seen it all so if
[1:31:55] you'll go for the glory of the lord
[1:31:57] though
[1:31:57] he'll do something for you if you go
[1:31:59] just to play then you ain't going to get
[1:32:01] nothing
[1:32:01] right amen that's the same way with
[1:32:03] church service so if you stand to your
[1:32:04] feet
[1:32:06] just remember that now monday morning at
[1:32:08] nine o'clock
[1:32:10] have somebody standing at the computer
[1:32:12] or sitting at a computer
[1:32:14] getting you registered for this the
[1:32:15] church is going to pay for it be nothing
[1:32:17] out of your pocket we're going to try to
[1:32:18] get some chaperones to go
[1:32:20] and if we have to all pile in several
[1:32:23] cars then
[1:32:24] i'd like to go a service or two maybe
[1:32:25] but uh but i'd like for the uh
[1:32:28] for it to be a good contingency of the
[1:32:30] of our church to go
[1:32:32] so uh and we thank brother dale again
[1:32:34] for
[1:32:35] always being mindful of the youth
[1:32:38] and being able to forward
[1:32:42] the money so it wouldn't cost anything
[1:32:44] out of your pocket listen folks i've
[1:32:46] seen a lot of people when we were in
[1:32:47] alabama there's a lot of people
[1:32:49] and a lot of churches that the kids
[1:32:51] would have to work
[1:32:52] overtime or pick up cans or do some kind
[1:32:55] of side job just to get
[1:32:57] i think it was 89 dollars when the gym
[1:32:59] and 80
[1:33:01] 80 something dollars at the end that was
[1:33:03] in the early 2000s just to get to you to
[1:33:06] be able to come to youth camp
[1:33:07] they had to afford get their own money
[1:33:09] they had to get their own food
[1:33:11] they had to get their own way there and
[1:33:14] they had to work
[1:33:16] to be able to get off just for that 80
[1:33:18] bucks to get to that camp but you know
[1:33:20] what
[1:33:20] god honored that i believe those are the
[1:33:22] ones that when they went to the altar
[1:33:23] they got something
[1:33:24] amen i guess it would be good to say
[1:33:28] that
[1:33:28] that that 189 covers their sleeping
[1:33:31] that's everything three meals a day
[1:33:33] three meals a day
[1:33:35] for four days yeah so i think that's a
[1:33:38] pretty good deal yeah it's a good deal
[1:33:40] probably get there thursday and then
[1:33:42] friday saturday and then sunday morning
[1:33:43] service so yeah it's a good day a real
[1:33:45] good deal and especially that the word

[1:33:50] every day yeah and be able to fellowship
[1:33:52] with other believers

[1:37:35] show forth the world may think we're
[1:37:37] crazy but that's okay they're living
[1:37:39] in a non-real condition
[1:37:42] but we're living in the reality of a
[1:37:44] living god
