[26:14] front and he told all the
[26:17] Brethren he said how many of you will

[27:23] take
[27:25] notes this morning we want to talk
[27:29] about confronting eternal
[27:35] life and I believe that each and every
[27:37] one of us we're confronting a day or
[27:40] facing a
[27:42] day because we don't know what's going
[27:44] to happen
[27:46] tomorrow but this
[27:49] morning we are face to face with eternal
[27:55] life so if you may stand to your
[28:01] feet we just ask the Lord to guide
[28:05] us he be the one who speaks to our
[28:11] hearts let us bow our heads and let us
[28:17] pray loving Heavenly Father we thank you
[28:21] this
[28:25] morning we believe Lord that you're the
[28:27] only one that can help
[28:31] us Lord I Have Nothing Within Myself to
[28:34] give to my
[28:35] brethren but you do
[28:40] Lord and this morning we believe that
[28:42] you're
[28:46] here because you were the first one
[28:48] invited the first honored
[28:51] guest Lord help us this
[28:55] morning we commit ourselves into your
[28:57] holy
[28:59] hands we ask it in the name of the Lord
[29:01] Jesus Christ amen
[29:05] amen if you would turn with me to Mark
[29:08] chapter
[29:11] 10 we're going to take this
[29:16] scripture Mark 10 verse
[29:25] 17 we read in the name of the Lord Jesus
[29:43] Christ and when he was gone forth into
[29:46] the way there came one running and
[29:48] kneeled to him and asked him good Master
[29:51] what shall I do that I may inherit
[29:53] eternal
[29:56] life
[30:03] and Jesus said unto him why callest thou
[30:05] me good there is none good but one that
[30:08] is
[30:19] God th knowest the con the Commandments
[30:22] do not commit adultery do not kill do
[30:24] not steal do not bear false witness the
[30:27] fraud not honor thy father and
[30:37] mother and he answered and said unto him
[30:40] master all these have I observed from my
[30:56] youth
[30:58] then Jesus beholding him loved him and
[31:01] said unto him one thing thou lackest go
[31:03] thy way sell whatsoever thou Hast and
[31:06] give to the poor and thou shalt have
[31:08] treasure in heaven and come take up the
[31:11] cross and follow
[31:22] me and he was sad at that saying and
[31:24] went away grieved for he had great great
[31:38] possessions and Jesus looked around
[31:40] about and said unto his disciples how
[31:42] hardly shall they that have riches enter
[31:45] into the kingdom of
[31:48] God Lord Jesus Christ bless his word may
[31:56] seated
[31:57] it's good to listen to this scripture
[32:00] and read the
[32:05] scripture but believing that each day
[32:07] that goes by we're hopefully we're we're
[32:10] scaling
[32:11] up that we're
[32:13] growing in our walk with
[32:18] God and that's the reason why we come to
[32:24] church because we believe because we
[32:26] want to walk with God amen
[32:32] amen and so this morning we're
[32:35] facing eternal
[32:38] life now when we're here at
[32:42] church we should lay aside all the
[32:46] problems all the weights and the sins
[32:48] that easily beset
[32:51] us because we can be here seated in
[32:56] church but our mind be somewhere
[32:59] else our thoughts could be somewhere
[33:04] else now you see the scripture that we
[33:06] were reading this young
[33:09] man he had
[33:12] everything he had done
[33:15] everything all the Ten Commandments he
[33:17] knew
[33:20] them I think he probably was even wiser
[33:22] than
[33:25] we but one thing that he did not know
[33:30] about he didn't know if he had eternal
[33:33] life or
[33:35] not so how many of us know if we have
[33:38] eternal life or
[33:41] not have we really met the Lord face to
[33:46] face that's a good
[33:49] question because this the question that
[33:51] this young man
[33:53] has what can I do to inherit eternal
[33:56] life
[33:59] and so Jesus told him do you know the
[34:02] Commandments
[34:04] [Music]
[34:05] yes so it's given to us there's been a
[34:08] homework that has been given to us come
[34:11] to
[34:14] church do the things that we need to do
[34:16] as a
[34:18] Christian fulfill the
[34:21] Commandments have we done
[34:23] those maybe we could say yes
[34:27] and so are we following the
[34:32] Lord maybe the the life that we live is
[34:35] what
[34:36] shows that we are following the Lord or
[34:39] trying
[34:40] to now the Lord knows our
[34:46] heart and there is there is something
[34:48] that that I really
[34:52] like there of an older
[34:55] person he he asked he asked a young
[35:00] man he said
[35:03] grandfather he said why do why do you go
[35:05] to
[35:09] church because I like it it's my duty to
[35:13] go to
[35:15] church what did you learn
[35:19] today well I don't know maybe I didn't
[35:21] learn
[35:24] anything that's how we are uh Sometimes
[35:27] some of
[35:29] us why did we not learn
[35:33] something because really we weren't at
[35:37] church we
[35:39] weren't our thoughts were
[35:45] elsewhere maybe the the the the ranchers
[35:47] the people out in the
[35:51] country maybe they were thinking there
[35:53] was a tree that was going to fall on
[35:55] their little house
[35:58] or that their cows were going to go
[36:01] away and that's why they couldn't learn
[36:03] something at church that
[36:07] day now he's going to church every
[36:10] single time and what did you
[36:13] learn I don't know if I did learn
[36:16] something or not so why do you go to
[36:25] church we we call
[36:30] old uh we call them older because the
[36:33] older ones
[36:35] know because the life that they have
[36:39] lived the experience that they have
[36:44] had that's what's made them to know what
[36:47] they
[36:49] know now watch
[36:52] this the
[36:55] Lord oh the the the the the man in this
[36:57] illustration the the the older
[37:02] man he had he had four
[37:06] baskets and in those four
[37:10] baskets there was carbon in those in
[37:13] those
[37:16] baskets do you know how carbon looks
[37:19] like how does carbon look
[37:22] like it has little little bitty pieces
[37:26] in within it I
[37:30] guess and that place where you put those
[37:33] things
[37:34] ingro it looks dark it looks like s
[37:39] s now
[37:42] notice the older
[37:44] man he told the young
[37:47] man go bring me
[37:50] water go bring water okay
[37:55] okay but how am I going to bring water
[37:58] in that
[38:00] basket go
[38:03] go okay all
[38:05] right he takes the
[38:08] basket and he fills it with water and he
[38:12] pulls it
[38:13] out and he takes
[38:15] it and he asks him where is the water
[38:19] the water fell out okay all right go get
[38:23] more
[38:25] water but the water keeps falling out of
[38:28] the basket no no go go get more
[38:32] water okay all
[38:34] right he takes the
[38:37] basket he fills it with water and he
[38:40] tries to bring it to him where is the
[38:43] water where all fell
[38:50] out now compare these baskets with the
[38:53] one that you use to take up the water
[38:58] water is what cleanses
[39:02] right and water is the is compared to
[39:05] the
[39:08] word and so he told him he said
[39:12] look I go to
[39:15] church because I want to be clean I want
[39:18] to be
[39:20] [Applause]
[39:24] washed he said maybe yesterday yesterday
[39:26] I didn't
[39:27] learn but I went to
[39:31] church and yesterday I went to church
[39:34] and I didn't
[39:36] learn but I stay
[39:39] clean what keeps us clean brothers and
[39:41] sisters the
[39:43] word the word keeps us
[39:48] clean and so when we
[39:51] think that what are we
[39:53] doing that what we're doing is not good
[39:55] it's not right
[39:58] why do we come to church and we feel
[40:00] like we're not getting
[40:02] anything We're Here
[40:04] Brothers we're here to learn something
[40:06] from God what are we going to learn from
[40:10] our Lord Jesus
[40:12] Christ he promised us eternal
[40:14] life and in this
[40:17] morning we are facing eternal
[40:21] life if you reject the Lord Jesus Christ
[40:25] today you are facing eternal
[40:28] life and if you
[40:33] reject you have denied the Lord
[40:37] Jesus because as you
[40:39] reject is denying amen
[40:44] amen and so
[40:47] believing that what God has given
[40:50] us so that we can take
[40:53] it take it in our hearts
[40:58] it's eternal life amen
[41:01] amen eternal life
[41:03] brothers and eternal life should be
[41:06] something
[41:07] daily
[41:09] because eternal
[41:11] life that we
[41:14] have we have it before the foundation of
[41:17] the
[41:19] world and so we don't look for
[41:21] it because we have it but this young man
[41:26] he didn't
[41:27] know he didn't know if he had eternal
[41:30] life or
[41:31] not and so when the question is given
[41:34] what should I
[41:35] do what should I
[41:40] do there is a doubt in our
[41:43] hearts and so each one of
[41:47] us that we have believed this precious
[41:51] message for me
[41:53] Brothers is eternal life
[41:58] Amen brother BR said this
[42:04] message is for the
[42:07] bride it's not for anyone
[42:10] else now who is the
[42:13] bride I believe the bride are
[42:16] those that God
[42:18] himself
[42:20] chose before the foundation of the
[42:23] world now we have seven Church ages
[42:29] he planted a
[42:31] seed he planted many seeds in every
[42:36] age and thank God that
[42:40] he he chose
[42:42] us for this last
[42:44] day so that we as
[42:49] seeds come to
[42:52] resurrect to eternal life in this
[42:55] morning
[42:57] aren't you happy for
[42:59] that I'm happy for
[43:02] that that without deserving it
[43:06] he he came to me I didn't come to him
[43:11] the prophet
[43:12] said no one seeks
[43:15] God God is
[43:18] seeking what he planted in the before
[43:21] the foundation of the
[43:22] world blessed be the name of the Lord
[43:27] because you weren't interested in
[43:29] God he was the one that was interested
[43:31] in
[43:32] you because a
[43:34] seed as it
[43:37] grows that eventually will give forth
[43:39] fruit amen
[43:43] amen as you start getting into the
[43:45] things of
[43:47] God and as you start living a different
[43:52] life your fruits are going to be
[43:55] different
[43:57] you're not going to act like the way you
[43:58] used to
[44:00] act you're going to act as a son and
[44:02] daughter of
[44:04] God that's the reason amen he chose
[44:09] you to be a son and daughter of
[44:13] God blessed be the name of the
[44:16] Lord how many are happy this
[44:18] morning
[44:19] [Applause]
[44:21] amen you forgive me that I speak
[44:25] Spanish
[44:28] but thank the
[44:30] Lord this brother speaks Spanish very
[44:33] well as
[44:37] well we should be thankful for this
[44:41] brother
[44:43] amen praise the
[44:50] Lord so as I as I
[44:54] said
[44:56] God In His Infinite
[45:00] plan he thought of
[45:02] you he thought of
[45:08] me because even while we were in in
[45:14] sins and and uh in our
[45:19] downfalls he chose
[45:21] us he chose
[45:24] us for what
[45:27] to be for eternal
[45:30] life for eternal
[45:34] life have you ever asked yourself
[45:38] Lord I want to have eternal
[45:41] life have you ever asked
[45:47] that now why does the question
[45:53] come why does that question come come to
[45:57] you you've paid your
[46:01] tithes you've obeyed the
[46:04] Lord but why does that question come to
[46:10] you it's something to think
[46:15] about why do I ask
[46:19] myself do I have eternal
[46:23] life am right
[46:29] amen now when that question comes to
[46:33] you we should have we should be very
[46:37] careful very
[46:41] careful Judas had the be the greatest
[46:45] Master around
[46:47] him Peter all the
[46:51] apostles they had the the master with
[46:54] them
[46:57] they faced eternal life
[47:02] personally Peter but maybe was a
[47:06] liar and what about
[47:09] us what are
[47:13] we have we denied the Lord yes see
[47:20] yeah the Lord Jesus Christ
[47:24] knows
[47:27] when Peter was very
[47:30] excited and he told Jesus he said I'll
[47:33] go with you until
[47:34] death I'm going to defend you
[47:40] Lord in in his own desires he
[47:45] tried he wanted to defend the
[47:50] [Music]
[47:52] Lord the Lord Jesus told him he said
[47:54] look Peter
[47:57] you're G to deny
[48:03] me and so the question is that that's
[48:07] the that's where the question
[48:10] comes how many times have we in our life
[48:13] Deni the
[48:17] Lord and you're own natural
[48:22] life where I see older people here
[48:26] I see young people
[48:29] here that maybe you ask yourselves the
[48:34] question do I have eternal
[48:39] life now
[48:44] look when Peter was with God I mean when
[48:48] Peter was with the
[48:51] Lord he didn't
[48:54] know he didn't
[48:57] know you know
[49:00] why because he didn't have the Holy
[49:04] Spirit he didn't have the Holy
[49:09] Spirit but in in his own desires and his
[49:12] own
[49:16] impulses he said I'm going to fight for
[49:18] you Lord
[49:21] Jesus but when the Lord Jesus told him
[49:23] Peter you're going to deny me
[49:26] no Lord I will never do that
[49:31] no so the doubt
[49:34] comes in his
[49:39] mind what is it that that you fight
[49:45] with you fight
[49:47] demons day by
[49:51] day and by the grace of God brothers and
[49:53] sisters we're here this morning
[49:56] morning by the grace of God it is by
[50:00] nothing else but by the grace of
[50:04] God and so when you
[50:07] overcame this morning you overcame you
[50:10] overcame death you overcame all kinds of
[50:13] different
[50:16] things this morning you're facing
[50:18] eternal
[50:20] life and as you're facing eternal life
[50:24] you have it before you
[50:26] before
[50:27] you and you say
[50:30] Lord I'm going I'm serving you today
[50:34] with all of my heart I'm going to serve
[50:36] you with all of my heart but maybe
[50:41] tomorrow we
[50:43] forget of our promise that we made the
[50:47] Lord you remember that when Peter was
[50:52] there he was hiding
[50:54] himself
[50:57] aren't you one of the ones that are
[50:58] following Jesus no
[51:05] no and do you know why they recognize
[51:09] him because of the way he dressed see
[51:13] yeah and so you and
[51:16] I we have we have a a
[51:22] pattern that even if we wanted to
[51:27] because there is your free moral agency
[51:29] right
[51:30] there brother brandham said
[51:34] sisters remember that I told
[51:37] you that you don't have to cut your
[51:41] hair because that's going to help
[51:44] you that's going to help
[51:46] you so but it's a it's a
[51:49] choice you can do it you can do it the
[51:55] any
[51:57] man each and every one of us have free m
[52:00] agency choice and
[52:04] depending on what we have uh fed the
[52:09] most that's what's going to conquer us
[52:13] and so
[52:15] look let me go back to this young man
[52:19] this young
[52:21] man as the prophet teaches
[52:24] us
[52:26] maybe he left school
[52:28] University his parents taught him good
[52:35] things and when he finished what he was
[52:37] trying to
[52:39] finish he ended up with a lot of
[52:44] money so the Bible that's why the Bible
[52:46] calls him the Rich Young
[52:51] Ruler now when he came face to face with
[52:54] eternal life
[52:56] because Jesus is the eternal life
[52:59] amen Jesus is eternal
[53:02] life because he said I am the way the
[53:05] truth and the
[53:09] life and death can't dwell with eternal
[53:14] life so
[53:18] us we have come face to
[53:20] face with eternal
[53:23] life in our in our
[53:27] walk in our daily
[53:30] life what do we
[53:32] do do do we
[53:36] try we try to live the best that we
[53:40] can but in the
[53:42] air there are powers in the
[53:46] air there are demons
[53:51] everywhere that are trying to to derail
[53:54] you and I
[53:55] day by
[53:57] day either you're even if you're young
[54:01] or if you're
[54:04] older the devil doesn't care about
[54:08] ages the devil doesn't care about
[54:11] that what he cares
[54:13] about is to be able to derail
[54:16] you derail your mind
[54:19] first because Paul said every
[54:23] day we have to
[54:26] renew the spirit of our
[54:29] mind because that's where the devil
[54:32] works in the
[54:34] mind the mind is the
[54:37] womb and when the mind is
[54:41] impregnated it comes down to the
[54:43] heart and from the heart all these bad
[54:46] desires come and
[54:49] depending on what you have
[54:53] desired that's what comes to light
[54:56] blessed be the name of the
[54:58] Lord
[55:07] [Music]
[55:08] amen maybe I went ahead a little
[55:13] bit but I want you to to see
[55:17] this the the the word
[55:24] confront
[55:25] means facing someone or
[55:30] something especially in a
[55:38] challenge in life it's inevitable for
[55:41] you to have to face uh uh uh to come
[55:44] face to face with some things in
[55:51] life we confront our fears so that we
[55:54] don't allow them to dominate
[56:03] us we confront error because ignoring it
[56:07] might do us wrong might do us
[56:14] bad Jesus had several confrontations
[56:17] with those who were coming against
[56:23] him
[56:29] the the apostles and the prophets in the
[56:31] bible they felt that they uh forced to
[56:34] confront
[56:38] themselves being that their message
[56:41] would bother the
[56:42] people is that
[56:48] correct confrontation can be good or can
[56:51] also be
[56:53] bad
[56:56] depending the
[56:59] situation and the Bible gives examples
[57:01] of
[57:04] [Music]
[57:06] this bad confrontation is motivated by
[57:11] pride and and wrong
[57:15] desire or other carnal
[57:23] desires those that confront others in
[57:26] order to to be able to to win some favor
[57:29] for
[57:34] themselves or to seem like they're
[57:36] better than someone
[57:39] else they're abusing that that Arc of
[57:51] Confrontation Street Wars start when a
[57:54] leader of a of a gang a gang leader
[57:57] starts problems with another
[58:09] one social media Wars start when one
[58:13] starts with another
[58:15] one on that on those
[58:18] platforms you know what I'm talking
[58:23] about
[58:32] you're not gaining anything with these
[58:34] confrontations because your motives are
[58:36] are are are are are are just dealing
[58:40] just with
[58:42] you selfish in other
[58:46] words Jesus many times was an object of
[58:49] a
[58:53] confrontation
[58:57] while he was preaching and teaching in
[59:03] Judea the main the the the
[59:07] priests sades and the
[59:11] Pharisees were motivated by pride and
[59:15] and
[59:19] fear and the fact that they didn't know
[59:22] what was going on and the desire to be
[59:24] able
[59:28] to and that's why they felt
[59:32] offended what Jesus would say and
[59:38] do and they would take advantage of any
[59:41] opportunity to confront
[59:45] him and his last confrontation finished
[59:48] was on his
[59:52] crucifixion the greatest crime in
[59:55] history in human
[59:57] history the greatest crime of human
[1:00:01] history now
[1:00:04] watch the prophet teaches
[1:00:07] us he tells
[1:00:10] us everything that we
[1:00:13] do that we do
[1:00:17] wrong when we know
[1:00:23] better crucifying the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:26] in
[1:00:27] you we denying eternal
[1:00:31] life we are denying eternal
[1:00:35] life and and so as men and
[1:00:39] women brothers and
[1:00:42] sisters we have to be very
[1:00:45] careful because this is like this is
[1:00:47] like a
[1:00:49] thread devil wants to cut
[1:00:52] it and he wants to disconnect us amen
[1:00:58] amen he wants to disconnect us from that
[1:01:01] love from that Divine
[1:01:05] love and that's something that the devil
[1:01:07] really
[1:01:08] wants disconnect you from
[1:01:11] him and once you're
[1:01:15] disconnected you're running
[1:01:17] desperately but your thread has been
[1:01:21] cut and so when you come to desperation
[1:01:28] I'm going to say it this
[1:01:30] way many people lose
[1:01:34] children what can you
[1:01:39] do you can get desperate you can cry you
[1:01:42] can you can do
[1:01:45] whatever you will never get get him back
[1:01:47] he will never come
[1:01:53] back now to to cut the
[1:01:55] communication with God that who is
[1:02:01] love who cuts that
[1:02:03] communication the devil our
[1:02:08] enemy and so how are we are going to
[1:02:11] confront eternal
[1:02:13] life because all the things of this
[1:02:17] life they're wanting to trap
[1:02:20] us especially social
[1:02:23] media
[1:02:25] social media is one of the most
[1:02:26] dangerous
[1:02:30] things is
[1:02:34] allowing it is allowing spiritual death
[1:02:37] in
[1:02:39] people so we want to confront or come
[1:02:42] face to face with eternal
[1:02:44] life when we
[1:02:47] can't it's sometimes is there's no
[1:02:50] remedy for it
[1:02:51] anymore there's no remedy
[1:02:55] because you are
[1:02:57] cut you have no
[1:03:01] connection so that's why the devil wants
[1:03:04] Brothers to just fight with another
[1:03:06] wants to separate us from fellowship
[1:03:11] and that's what he
[1:03:14] wants but that's why we are here this
[1:03:17] morning Servants of the Lord Jesus
[1:03:20] Christ to to come
[1:03:23] together eternal life or face to face
[1:03:26] eternal
[1:03:28] life because the
[1:03:30] majority is the greater power the union
[1:03:35] is great is a greater power amen
[1:03:42] amen let's read the uh what brother
[1:03:45] Brandon says the message that God gave
[1:03:48] us are you happy this

[1:03:54] Jesus

[1:04:04] me uh paragraph
[1:04:11] 39 the Holy Spirit through brother
[1:04:17] Brandon he says here let's look at this
[1:04:19] fellow for a few
[1:04:21] minutes that we read about
[1:04:28] no doubt that this kid was born in a
[1:04:30] good
[1:04:33] home why is there no doubt about
[1:04:36] that because he was
[1:04:38] young he knew the
[1:04:40] Commandments he was
[1:04:44] rich and that was there was no doubt
[1:04:46] about
[1:04:50] that how many are rich
[1:04:53] here how many are
[1:04:57] millionaires I'm a
[1:05:02] millionaire Paul said that we we we're
[1:05:05] we're expensive in the eyes of
[1:05:08] God Amen we're we're
[1:05:12] expensive just one one

[1:05:33] States now do you know more than 10,000
[1:05:36] worlds that's that's your
[1:05:42] worth then this man here was rich in
[1:05:47] properties his father or he might have
[1:05:50] have
[1:05:51] inherited because a young man
[1:05:56] because maybe he comes to a point where
[1:05:57] he's paying
[1:05:59] rent his car
[1:06:02] insurance and and at the end of the
[1:06:05] month he's asking for more for some
[1:06:07] money from his dad for for for
[1:06:12] gas a young man in our
[1:06:16] age but this young man he was rich he
[1:06:19] was he was
[1:06:21] wealthy but what he didn't have
[1:06:24] why he didn't know if he had or not if
[1:06:27] he had eternal life or
[1:06:30] not now when you know that you have
[1:06:33] eternal
[1:06:34] life you're the most happiest person
[1:06:36] ever you're the most thankful person
[1:06:39] ever brother bham
[1:06:42] says that you're waiting for the doors
[1:06:45] to open so that you can come
[1:06:48] worship to come
[1:06:51] worship it's not to just sing good songs
[1:06:54] to
[1:06:56] worship is to come here to The Altar and
[1:06:59] to ask the Lord Lord
[1:07:02] help Lord bring your children bring your
[1:07:05] bring bring your your neighbors bring
[1:07:08] anyone amen predestin
[1:07:11] children that is a good
[1:07:15] worshipper not is the one that plays
[1:07:17] guitar really well are the one that
[1:07:19] sings like an angel
[1:07:22] no the good worshipper is the one that
[1:07:26] worships in every moment and in every
[1:07:30] place
[1:07:32] amen are you with
[1:07:35] me all right let's
[1:07:38] continue I don't know how much time I
[1:07:41] have but I'm just I'm just
[1:07:43] [Laughter]
[1:07:50] starting I normally preach back home
[1:07:52] about 35 minutes so you don't
[1:08:02] worry so this is what we see when Jesus
[1:08:05] uh
[1:08:09] uh okay so no doubt that this kid was
[1:08:11] born in a good home like you kids are he
[1:08:13] was brought up with good
[1:08:16] parents because it proved it when Jesus
[1:08:18] presented to him the Commandments of
[1:08:22] God
[1:08:32] he he said I've kept these since youth
[1:08:34] it showed that he had been he had been
[1:08:36] brought
[1:08:40] upright the prophet uses this word he
[1:08:42] wasn't just a snatch
[1:08:49] out and you know he had been brought up
[1:08:52] to know what's right
[1:08:57] kids like you all
[1:09:03] are probably come up under a God-fearing
[1:09:06] Mother and
[1:09:10] Daddy to teach him
[1:09:13] right when he was a
[1:09:16] kid that's why I
[1:09:19] like you instruct a child in the way
[1:09:22] that now when when it's talking about a
[1:09:29] child I believe it's not just a a little
[1:09:34] newborn when you come to the knowledge
[1:09:36] of the
[1:09:38] word you come to this glorious message
[1:09:41] you are a child you're a
[1:09:45] child said instruct a child in the way
[1:09:48] that now in the natural in the natural
[1:09:52] you could you can do it
[1:09:58] but the psalmist said instruct the child
[1:10:00] in the way they should go that when he
[1:10:01] gets older he shall not
[1:10:05] depart he might
[1:10:07] depart he might
[1:10:09] depart each and every one of us have
[1:10:12] backslid for in our life each and every
[1:10:15] one of us there's not
[1:10:18] one but the life that has been given
[1:10:21] us that that teaching that has been
[1:10:24] taught us that won't go away from
[1:10:27] us and each one of us that have
[1:10:30] backslid we have to
[1:10:32] return we have to
[1:10:35] return
[1:10:37] amen
[1:10:39] why why do we have to
[1:10:41] return because it's part of the plan of
[1:10:44] God it's part of God's perfect
[1:10:47] plan that you and I in this
[1:10:51] day we were predestined
[1:10:55] in this in this age for
[1:10:59] what to
[1:11:01] manifest to be manifested as Sons and
[1:11:04] Daughters of God that's what Paul
[1:11:07] said he said we are
[1:11:11] waiting the
[1:11:13] manifestation of the sons of God amen
[1:11:17] amen blessed be the name of the
[1:11:22] Lord now this young
[1:11:24] man because of his
[1:11:29] riches he didn't want to accept eternal
[1:11:32] life he was before eternal life and he
[1:11:36] rejected
[1:11:38] it he had three moral
[1:11:41] agents he he was going to
[1:11:44] accept and as he
[1:11:48] accepted he had to obey what the eternal
[1:11:51] life was telling him what was the
[1:11:54] eternal life telling
[1:11:56] him go sell everything that you
[1:11:59] have now what do you
[1:12:02] have what do you have to
[1:12:05] sell let me tell each and every one of
[1:12:08] you nothing is
[1:12:11] free but the Lord Jesus
[1:12:14] said come and
[1:12:16] buy without money and without
[1:12:22] price but you don't buy anything
[1:12:25] free everything that you've
[1:12:29] obtained everything that has gotten in
[1:12:31] your way in life you have to sell it you

[1:12:50] free the devil never sells you anything
[1:12:52] for free gives you anything for free now
[1:12:55] you have to just go ahead and just give
[1:12:57] it back to
[1:12:59] him and this is not
[1:13:02] mine all these wrong
[1:13:04] desires all these bad actions they're
[1:13:08] not my own so I I just give them back to
[1:13:11] you
[1:13:14] Satan that's what we have to
[1:13:16] do in order to obtain eternal life
[1:13:19] because eternal life what is eternal
[1:13:22] life Prophet teaches
[1:13:25] us to live for
[1:13:27] others and what are we going to
[1:13:30] live the life that the prophet taught
[1:13:34] us that's what you have to show people
[1:13:37] that is living for
[1:13:40] others not that you go to
[1:13:43] work and you're going to give your money
[1:13:45] or your paycheck to someone else no but
[1:13:48] the life that you
[1:13:49] live that means eternal
[1:13:52] life blessed be the name of the

[1:14:37] message but the
[1:14:39] devil is so
[1:14:42] astute that he's come to try to steal
[1:14:45] that away from us
[1:14:48] mentally
[1:14:50] spiritually you might say but but I have
[1:14:54] my
[1:14:55] son and does your son want to come to

[1:15:12] daughter do you really want to come to
[1:15:22] church good
[1:15:29] question I tell you that by
[1:15:34] experience and it broke my heart so
[1:15:39] much my oldest
[1:15:43] son he's an obedient
[1:15:46] boy
[1:15:47] but he's not going to
[1:15:51] church he told me
[1:15:54] he said
[1:15:57] Dad I want to have my own
[1:16:01] experience I want to feel it for
[1:16:07] myself and that broke my heart so
[1:16:10] much he said
[1:16:15] dad he said I don't want you to come
[1:16:17] knock the
[1:16:20] door and tell
[1:16:22] me
[1:16:24] let's go to
[1:16:26] church don't come knocking my door like
[1:16:29] that
[1:16:29] anymore how do you think I felt when he
[1:16:32] told me
[1:16:36] that
[1:16:40] now us being
[1:16:44] parents that the lord lord Jesus
[1:16:47] said you are good
[1:16:50] parents you've given everything to your
[1:16:52] children
[1:16:54] you're not going to give them a stone
[1:16:55] instead of
[1:16:59] bread you're not going to give them a
[1:17:01] snake instead of a fish that's
[1:17:03] right you're going to give them the
[1:17:09] best and how much our heavenly
[1:17:13] father that he loves
[1:17:17] us and so what you
[1:17:20] love and what you tell the
[1:17:23] say those
[1:17:25] things how do you think you
[1:17:31] feel so our heavenly
[1:17:34] father how do you think he feels when
[1:17:36] you tell him those
[1:17:37] things when one of his
[1:17:40] children when one of his
[1:17:44] children has rejected his
[1:17:47] word how do you think he
[1:17:52] feels
[1:17:55] now do we really need an experience
[1:17:59] yeah we need
[1:18:02] it either whether you're
[1:18:07] young and your
[1:18:09] experience that you and I should have
[1:18:12] Prophet
[1:18:13] said the new
[1:18:16] birth we the new new birth and so when
[1:18:20] you have the new birth
[1:18:24] your nature
[1:18:28] changes as your nature
[1:18:31] changes God comes
[1:18:33] in and he takes
[1:18:35] control he takes
[1:18:39] control and he's the one that guides
[1:18:45] us he's the one that teaches
[1:18:48] us of what we need to
[1:18:51] do and
[1:18:55] during as as a
[1:18:58] father you bring your child to church at
[1:19:01] 10 years old eight years
[1:19:04] old Come On
[1:19:07] Son let's go to
[1:19:09] church and because they want to
[1:19:12] obey let's
[1:19:14] go but really do they really want to
[1:19:21] come
[1:19:23] let's ask ourselves as
[1:19:27] parents do our children
[1:19:30] really if they haven't really had that
[1:19:33] experience in their
[1:19:34] life and if you haven't experienced that
[1:19:36] in your life do it ask them that
[1:19:40] before the devil takes
[1:19:43] them it's
[1:19:47] hard you know you just look at the
[1:19:49] prophet's
[1:19:50] life how he felt
[1:19:55] how did Brother brandham
[1:19:58] feel him being the servant of
[1:20:02] God can you imagine
[1:20:05] that all eyes were on
[1:20:08] him were on the servant of the
[1:20:12] Lord eyes were on the
[1:20:16] pastor all eyes on the
[1:20:19] Deacon all eyes on the on on on the uh
[1:20:23] uh on the
[1:20:24] uhu a leader at church and what can you
[1:20:28] do the
[1:20:31] life that you
[1:20:34] live is not the life that your son's
[1:20:37] living because it's an individual
[1:20:40] walk what you
[1:20:43] say is what your children are going to
[1:20:48] do when the
[1:20:50] Lord
[1:20:51] deals W with your heart or with their
[1:20:56] heart because the the steps of a good
[1:20:59] man are ordered by
[1:21:01] who are ordered by
[1:21:05] God blessed be the name of the
[1:21:09] Lord I'm I don't think I'm going to
[1:21:13] finish but I think we have two Services
[1:21:16] right okay all
[1:21:20] right Lord Jesus allow we may continue
[1:21:23] this
[1:21:25] afternoon and in in paragraph 41
[1:21:27] continuing to read here in the same
[1:21:31] message and so the mother and
[1:21:33] father with him
[1:21:36] praying
[1:21:39] constantly so that your so that their
[1:21:42] son would not be just a common
[1:21:47] boy but an extraordinary young
[1:21:51] man that is why every parent would
[1:21:59] want did you hear Jesus as he referred
[1:22:02] to that
[1:22:04] commandment honor your father and
[1:22:07] mother and so he he stood
[1:22:14] there and that is the ambition of any
[1:22:18] father to do the best he can for his
[1:22:21] children to educate
[1:22:25] [Music]
[1:22:27] them to maybe even give them the things
[1:22:30] that they have themselves
[1:22:35] had and that's how I feel with my
[1:22:42] children sometimes I think about going
[1:22:44] to
[1:22:46] school and I sent Becky and I sent Sarah
[1:22:49] and
[1:22:51] Joseph to these to these
[1:22:56] schools and all these places where all
[1:22:59] these bad behaviors
[1:23:03] are I would rather just take them up in
[1:23:06] a mountain
[1:23:09] somewhere and raise them up there with
[1:23:12] the
[1:23:14] Indians but this is the
[1:23:16] thing this is the thing watch what the
[1:23:18] prophet says
[1:23:20] here what is in the in the in the
[1:23:24] child is going to come
[1:23:27] out doesn't matter where he
[1:23:30] is that
[1:23:32] has that is going to come
[1:23:34] out if there's wickedness there that's
[1:23:38] what's going to come
[1:23:39] out and even in the Indian Camp if I
[1:23:42] took him to the Indian Camp if he's
[1:23:44] going to be up
[1:23:46] there that same wickedness will come out
[1:23:49] in no matter what camp he's at so so you
[1:23:53] see now
[1:23:55] watch social
[1:24:00] media I have
[1:24:03] heard
[1:24:05] men older
[1:24:08] men they have rejected this
[1:24:11] message
[1:24:14] why
[1:24:16] why have you ever asked yourself
[1:24:19] why when a
[1:24:21] person has walked in this glorious
[1:24:25] message 40
[1:24:29] years how many years did Moses walk in
[1:24:32] the
[1:24:37] desert how
[1:24:46] many and the prophet says how how much
[1:24:49] time that they have to get to the
[1:24:51] promised land in reality
[1:24:55] just a short
[1:24:56] time that's how we
[1:24:58] are now we
[1:25:01] think we're 40 years into
[1:25:05] this and we're just the best of the best
[1:25:09] you know
[1:25:10] what when you start thinking like
[1:25:14] that you're the most miserable
[1:25:17] one and I am
[1:25:19] too that's
[1:25:21] why
[1:25:22] the Apostle Paul was
[1:25:24] careful and saying
[1:25:27] renewing of our mind the renewing of our
[1:25:30] mind the spirit of our
[1:25:33] mind when we have that kind of
[1:25:37] wisdom because you have to have a
[1:25:39] wisdom how to renew that
[1:25:46] mind how how do we renew how do we
[1:25:48] restore renew a vehicle a
[1:25:51] car when we we see that it's
[1:25:54] old when we see that maybe it's not
[1:25:57] running
[1:25:58] anymore the
[1:26:01] devil likes to make you look like
[1:26:05] junk in your
[1:26:10] mind that's why we need God in our
[1:26:15] life in order to Reen in order to
[1:26:19] restore our mind our spirit
[1:26:24] when you have those tools
[1:26:29] available you're you're you're good to
[1:26:32] go you're good to
[1:26:35] go but you
[1:26:38] need we need this message we need this
[1:26:41] message this message is to what to
[1:26:46] restore that's why God sent this
[1:26:49] message and what was he going to restore
[1:26:55] it it was going to restore something
[1:26:57] that was already kind of a
[1:27:00] junky
[1:27:03] amen you're a child of God you're a
[1:27:06] daughter of
[1:27:09] God while you're facing eternal life
[1:27:12] face to face on a daily
[1:27:15] basis Jesus told this young
[1:27:18] man go sell everything that you have to
[1:27:22] the
[1:27:23] poor and then
[1:27:25] come and follow me every
[1:27:30] week no he said daily come follow me
[1:27:35] daily
[1:27:37] daily and to serve God daily is to live
[1:27:42] a life that is worth but is worth more
[1:27:47] than 10,000
[1:27:49] worlds and when the people say
[1:27:53] you look
[1:27:56] good look at that nice hair you
[1:27:59] have are you
[1:28:01] walking are you

[1:28:16] you he's
[1:28:18] preaching he's preaching what is he
[1:28:21] preaching
[1:28:22] what he
[1:28:23] lives is what the prophet
[1:28:26] said he said Don't Preach me a sermon he
[1:28:29] live me a
[1:28:32] Ser that's
[1:28:34] [Applause]
[1:28:39] it
[1:28:46] okay give me one more
[1:28:49] minute and let me just read you this
[1:28:51] last one
[1:28:56] stand to your feet have the musicians
[1:29:09] come and the prophet continues here
[1:29:12] asking this question do you know
[1:29:20] something 86 % of conversions to Jesus
[1:29:25] Christ happened before the 20 21 years
[1:29:30] old that's what it
[1:29:33] shows that's what statistics
[1:29:36] show that's what the the statistics
[1:29:41] show and 86% of those that come to
[1:29:46] Christ come before they're
[1:29:50] 21 once you're at you're past that
[1:29:54] age you're more
[1:29:57] molded or
[1:29:58] hardened in your
[1:30:01] ways
[1:30:02] oh but it's possible
[1:30:08] sure whether it's 70 or or when they
[1:30:11] come to 70 or 80 years
[1:30:14] old they come in but sometimes it's it's
