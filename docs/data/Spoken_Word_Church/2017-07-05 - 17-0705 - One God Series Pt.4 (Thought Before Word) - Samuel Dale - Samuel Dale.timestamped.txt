[2:47] Jesus name Amen
[2:54] it says John 1:1 in the beginning was
[2:58] the word and the Word was with God now
[3:03] that doesn't mean with like two people
[3:06] right
[3:07] that's not what it's emphasizing it's
[3:10] emphasizing the fact of the self
[3:14] existing one more than it is to try to
[3:17] bring a Trinity and the word was god see
[3:21] that saw was a problem the same was in
[3:23] the beginning with God all things were
[3:26] made by him and without him was not
[3:28] anything made that was made in him was
[3:31] life and the life was the light of men
[3:34] and the light shining in darkness and
[3:36] the darkness comprehended it not you may
[3:40] be seated the Lord at his blessing to
[3:42] the reading of the word know as I've
[3:47] tried to express here a few weeks ago a
[3:50] little thought you know we asked
[3:54] ourselves a question sometimes about the
[3:57] way God writes his word but now remember
[4:00] he does two things in writing his
[4:02] scriptures all right
[4:04] he reveals it to his children all right
[4:11] called us a very private letter not
[4:13] written to the world it is written only
[4:16] to the bride of Jesus Christ others can
[4:19] read it and follow in thoughts and lines
[4:22] but it is not written to them it's
[4:25] written to those that are in Christ
[4:27] Jesus right all right now to then it's
[4:31] written to reveal to the children but
[4:35] it's written to hide it from the wise
[4:37] and prudent like I said wouldn't it it
[4:40] wouldn't be much of a surprise it
[4:42] wouldn't take a revelation if you
[4:45] started off in Genesis and it would be
[4:47] fulfilling the scriptures you know and
[4:49] say in the beginning Jesus created all
[4:53] things well that's exactly what the
[4:55] scripture says
[4:57] question said that John says it Hebrew
[5:00] says it vision says it yeah it's
[5:06] so you could literally say that but
[5:09] there wouldn't be no mystery right and
[5:13] see if you read it here like this
[5:15] if you said in the beginning was Jesus
[5:20] and Jesus was with Jesus and Jesus was
[5:25] Jesus and then saying Jesus was
[5:31] manifested among us there wouldn't be a
[5:33] mystery you understand what I'm saying
[5:38] the Bible's written to hide it from the
[5:41] wise and prudent now we'll read it again
[5:45] in the medical I want to get to throw
[5:47] tanner
[5:47] what brother Brandon would talk about in
[5:49] the beginning before the eternal he said
[5:52] well that's just you know that just
[5:54] blows your mind well why would it blow
[5:57] our mind what if it is said in the
[6:05] beginning was God or Jesus or whatever
[6:13] it was right and just say back before he
[6:19] created anything you know that he truly
[6:26] existed what's he that that wouldn't be
[6:32] a problem but it's not stated in that
[6:36] way even brother Branham a lot of times
[6:38] will state things that I like the way he
[6:42] said it in this quote that's reason I
[6:43] keep giving it over and over so let's
[6:47] just read that one go ahead with number
[6:48] one I like that we come up with a way of
[6:50] breaking it down to understand the
[6:53] commas and things but I'm wanting you to
[6:55] see the point that he's trying to make
[7:01] he's simply trying to state that before
[7:05] anything existed we look back and we see
[7:09] eternity and the best way to see that is
[7:15] for the point of saying you know if
[7:17] there is a God surely he's eternal
[7:22] well then to bring it down you've got to
[7:27] see it by revelation you can't see it my
[7:32] theology if the theologians can take it
[7:37] and break it down and and do things but
[7:42] they can't keep it totally in line right
[7:45] but watch now look what he's saying
[7:51] notice now his attributes then the
[8:01] attribute was first God the thought the
[8:07] attribute all in one without being
[8:12] expressed then when you express second
[8:16] early
[8:16] he became then the word now listen to
[8:20] what we're saying tonight this is the
[8:22] thought of the whole message the title
[8:25] of the message is thought before word if
[8:36] you hold that in your mind so before
[8:39] word then you'll see why it will say in
[8:45] the beginning was the word Word was with
[8:47] God and the Word was God
[8:49] it's first all than word but now
[8:54] remember what it's saying are about
[8:55] attribute we'll get back to that but
[8:57] then and then the word was made flesh
[9:00] and dwelt among us st. John rivers in
[9:02] the beginning but before the eternal
[9:05] that destroys our mind and once he said
[9:11] notice in the beginning was the word
[9:14] when time began it was word but before
[9:24] it was word it was attribute a thought
[9:32] then it was expressed in the beginning
[9:34] was the expression the word alright
[9:38] now think about it so we try to figure
[9:43] out what it means to be this for that
[9:46] alright a beginning means a starting
[9:50] point or are something to look at now
[9:58] how are you going to talk about an
[10:00] eternal God that the Prophet would say
[10:04] he covered all space time and eternity
[10:10] and then you try to comprehend him so
[10:16] you can't do it
[10:18] it's got to be left to work that is done
[10:23] by revelation right by revelation so you
[10:32] can't follow God by intellect you can
[10:37] only follow n by revelation because you
[10:43] can't comprehend an eternal God with a
[10:47] human mind we see we try to figure it
[10:51] out and try to get it to fit here fit
[10:53] here fit now it doesn't fit anywhere me
[10:59] it has to be believed
[11:08] as the Prophet would say you got to
[11:10] believe that there is a God it's not a
[11:18] power of words or persuasion or whatever
[11:22] to to try to give us understanding it's
[11:25] a very fact of being truth who stop
[11:31] trying to figure it out and just believe
[11:34] it just believe it because what we've
[11:41] done now this is for messages and we
[11:43] haven't come out of eternity yet one of
[11:48] the things that I'm approaching is on
[11:51] this side of that eternity because I
[11:56] want you to see how real it is and how
[11:59] real eternity is maybe one of these days
[12:05] that our donors that that new birth that
[12:08] we have is a very part of God it's his
[12:16] own life it's the person of Jesus Christ
[12:27] coming in living in you see that can't
[12:30] be figured out you mean as a person come
[12:32] down to lives in the end of the person
[12:33] the words that is in here they'll hear
[12:35] over see this no it's believing it so it
[12:42] was never a time I don't mean never now
[12:46] because the apostle - understood
[12:49] but after you coming down to the ages
[12:52] you lost the ability to explain God I
[12:56] don't mean that wrong explain God
[12:58] because you never could explain it but
[13:02] mankind by his own ideas lost all
[13:05] thoughts of understanding an eternal God
[13:14] then the Prophet had to come and spend
[13:16] all of those years preaching
[13:22] trying to reveal God and in doing that
[13:32] it's got to be revealed to you just a
[13:41] simple little statement see you say I
[13:44] can't understand in the beginning before
[13:45] the eternal you think I'll make it
[13:53] confusing I try to make it simple how
[14:00] about something being before the word
[14:13] because it was first attribute or
[14:18] thought and then word then trying to
[14:29] understand really what we're trying to
[14:33] understand is to look back by way of a
[14:37] profit bringing it to us to see what God
[14:40] has done that's what makes it so
[14:44] marvelous to me to see that how the
[14:47] eternal God by way of a simple seventh
[14:52] grade education man could bring God down
[14:57] from eternity we might find that one of
[15:03] these days that old black guy that was
[15:05] up there you know when he first brother
[15:07] branham first met him the colored guy
[15:10] you know that all the rest ever talking
[15:13] about what's going on on earth said he
[15:15] took his message from back before the
[15:16] foundation of the world come down the
[15:18] horizontal rainbow bringing him down it
[15:22] meant something to him well but he was a
[15:28] prophet he knows more he sure did enjoy
[15:35] hearing the colored brother explained
[15:38] that this and he emphasized that all
[15:42] through his ministry of thinking why in
[15:45] the world they're going to put that old
[15:46] man up there when they got all these
[15:48] young guys but when he got through
[15:53] another man got through bringing his
[15:56] message your prophet went home happy he
[16:01] heard from what he believed can you take
[16:07] it anyone what about a prophet don't you
[16:11] think he'd be listening he would brag
[16:15] about brother Neville and the messages
[16:17] he's brain brother lavell and all of
[16:19] those brothers but around him would brag
[16:21] about you know Thank You minute
[16:25] you know what I think he meant it even
[16:31] though he was a prophet but yet me see
[16:37] to me it's very simple
[16:39] God has tried to condescend to mankind
[16:45] and to do that it bypasses all thinking
[16:52] of our carnality
[16:56] remember what we gave where the Prophet
[16:58] said you can't go back in theology any
[17:04] further than in the beginning when he
[17:10] said by revelation we go you see the
[17:17] most theologians how do you think they
[17:19] felt sitting there listening to a man
[17:21] that would start talking about how the
[17:24] world come into being and this happening
[17:26] that happened and it's a boy he don't
[17:31] know nothing about the Bible that's what
[17:35] he said and he said might not know much
[17:36] about the Bible but as I know the author
[17:38] real well but now the problem was at the
[17:44] end of the service when he said if I
[17:46] told you the truth now let God come down
[17:49] it means say now come on brothers or
[17:52] you're welcome for the pulpit if you
[17:55] were to come and do this well you know
[17:58] they didn't get up and go up they have
[18:00] the sense not to do that because they
[18:04] knew that he had some contact that they
[18:07] didn't have but I hope you've understood
[18:13] now what I've tried to bring message
[18:16] after message at least three of them
[18:17] about how real God is and how real he
[18:22] was before you could have any thoughts
[18:26] of eternity Zorba for eternity or
[18:30] anywhere in eternity or whatever that
[18:33] God was real
[18:35] he didn't come into being
[18:41] he always was a being he didn't come in
[18:47] existence to be something he always was
[18:50] that I want you to get that part and
[18:54] think about it
[18:55] because we're going to deal with
[18:56] thoughts and attributes and I want you
[18:59] to think about what I've always tried to
[19:01] teach you 47 years this is not new I
[19:04] don't want to worry about it I can go
[19:07] right in my closet there's a big old box
[19:09] there and I'll pull it out let you read
[19:13] the title sister Johnny wanted to take
[19:15] all my messages one time and put them
[19:17] into you know book form
[19:20] I said good luck first off you can't
[19:24] read them second off you wouldn't know
[19:27] what in the world it was being saying
[19:29] because it's me talkin you know I'm not
[19:34] exactly like brother branham but it's
[19:35] pretty close sometimes he'd draw a star
[19:38] going across the bridge you know we'll
[19:43] see he preached for two hours over that
[19:47] stars going across that bridge but he
[19:49] wasn't said they just are going across
[19:50] the bridge that made him think and kept
[19:53] him lined up to what he wanted to bring
[19:56] alright but think about it now the point
[20:02] tonight is what if you thinking about in
[20:06] the beginning all right in the beginning
[20:07] was the word
[20:09] where's was with God the Word was God
[20:13] now by way of the Prophet we back up
[20:20] before that word comes into being you
[20:24] said what your words eternal well praise
[20:27] God you thought of that with everything
[20:32] the word talks about it's not eternal
[20:36] God created everything right but
[20:40] everything he creates is not eternal
[20:47] you got to remember that and remember to
[20:49] thought that I've always tried to make
[20:51] to you whatever attribute you can think
[20:54] of you know father son Holy Ghost Lily
[20:57] LaValley right you know anything on any
[21:01] point that you can bring a father healer
[21:04] Savior or whatever
[21:06] remember those attributes already
[21:12] existed in him as a part of him before
[21:19] he ever even made one angel or star or
[21:23] anything if not so you're making him as
[21:30] a president you can't add two you can't
[21:36] add to the Word of God you got to
[21:39] believe it like it is and let God reveal
[21:43] it see then all of those attributes if
[21:48] you see anything you can think of he
[21:51] never gained that as he come down he
[21:55] displayed it as he came down he's never
[22:00] getting anything he didn't become
[22:03] eternal by us writing the word eternal
[22:06] on the page or something remember what
[22:10] I've emphasized to do it because the
[22:12] best I can do that that you tell him to
[22:15] show the self existing whatever the word
[22:18] could you use to at least to how that
[22:24] much but now look that's education
[22:27] that's theology that's man's definition
[22:37] because when he met Moses get a name it
[22:40] couldn't be pronounced
[22:47] and it can never be pronounced by
[22:48] theology but it may be so simple that
[22:56] we've stumbled all across it I could try
[23:00] to express the brother one time that
[23:03] brother branham told him he would speak
[23:04] the word and one day he'd walk out he
[23:06] never didn't do that but before he died
[23:08] I explained to him one thing I said
[23:11] brother that in my home I said brother
[23:15] you've probably said what you're
[23:17] supposed to say millions of times but
[23:21] it's never dropped from your head to
[23:24] your heart as it may be so simple but
[23:32] it's never dropped from the head and
[23:35] into the heart it may be by shots I'm
[23:39] healed but you see is it was never meant
[23:47] to be talking about Sunday's are you on
[23:55] my company being in and all forgive me
[23:57] sometimes I have to back up and you know
[24:00] without finding backing up a lot of
[24:02] times it's helpful to the older ones as
[24:05] much it is the younger ones too to be
[24:08] able to understand but talking Sunday
[24:12] about God dwelling alone but yet we
[24:16] think about him as dwelling alone as
[24:20] notice he's nothing he's just nothing
[24:25] he's just ever worked well in alone I've
[24:30] tried to make it into terminologies to
[24:34] help us how many millions of years I
[24:39] know God can think in a million years in
[24:43] the flesh right come on so don't
[24:45] misunderstand me but what about him
[24:48] thinking before the world of what he's
[24:50] going to do he could spent millions of
[24:54] years walking through the portals of
[24:57] whatever region you want to call of
[24:58] heaven or where he was at her
[25:00] we've done determine that with rudder on
[25:02] said he had a house he said he lives in
[25:05] heaven how long would it take you to
[25:15] think over and write down your life if
[25:23] you wrote ever mind you detail how long
[25:26] would it take him but why don't you
[25:30] think about God doing and you set in our
[25:36] thinking way Mike it was telling well
[25:40] you don't know I know one dying he's God
[25:45] we limit into what we do but why don't
[25:50] you allow him to be able to think about
[25:58] what he's going to do is there any
[26:02] probable man well my problem with you is
[26:07] brother Dale you try to make him too too
[26:09] real I would to God I could make him so
[26:12] real that he would appear here real to
[26:15] you to see that is real I would do God I
[26:22] could make him so real that you would
[26:24] understand but you don't want you'll
[26:26] never understand how really is unless he
[26:28] reveals himself now that's the point for
[26:31] tonight you will never understand him by
[26:35] human intelligence you cannot comprehend
[26:40] an eternal God with our peanut brains of
[26:45] trying to figure things out
[26:48] we're not you sat down and listened to
[26:53] him talk sometime you know what I've
[26:57] brought over and over here lately you
[27:00] know prayer is a communication well you
[27:03] know we do all the laughing my don't we
[27:08] stop listening to him he might show us
[27:12] something
[27:15] you see we we think about eternity well
[27:19] how can you think about eternity the
[27:23] only way you can think about eternity is
[27:26] to think by revelation
[27:31] how could you explain to somebody that
[27:34] don't have eternal life about eternal
[27:36] life you know yourself well what I'm
[27:48] fixing this age right that even with
[27:49] eternal life in our soul as a child of a
[27:53] son and daughter of God we still have a
[27:56] lot of problems residual mentality that
[27:58] we have right brother Gary Atkins we
[28:06] used to talk of what in the
[28:08] terminologies or something like that and
[28:10] you know he'd say oh I just hadn't
[28:14] failed anything or had any real good
[28:17] feelings for months now I said you just
[28:21] that far I said I appreciate our Sunday
[28:27] three times a week back then especially
[28:29] I said I'm preaching and I haven't had a
[28:33] word from God until her from the time I
[28:35] started preaching
[28:42] yeah but you think she's just all made
[28:44] it God Rena I love this message the
[28:51] random was a prophet you agree the great
[28:54] contact with God you agree you mind if I
[28:58] tell you a little story about him that
[29:03] one day he said he couldn't get nothing
[29:04] from the Lord and he got in his car and
[29:07] wrote all up in the Clarks Turner and
[29:09] what it was up above Jeffersonville
[29:11] rolled all the way back up in there he's
[29:15] because he couldn't get anything getting
[29:17] contact with God and he was a prophet so
[29:23] how much you think we can't be left if
[29:29] he had trouble getting contact with God
[29:31] and he got one time every five minutes
[29:34] where do you think me and you gonna be
[29:36] pull it right maybe one time there were
[29:40] five years can I quote write about and
[29:45] said God may train you only your life
[29:51] for one 30-minute sermon
[29:55] give her down even a man preach all of
[30:00] his life three services a week then with
[30:10] preaches one sermon on a host of life he
[30:13] said see there's a lot of times if you
[30:16] think they're hard to understand
[30:17] something about this without of the
[30:18] other there's a lot of things that could
[30:22] be expressed it hit wonder about I
[30:27] remember one brother he was telling
[30:30] about you know how the Lord was leading
[30:32] him to go and he was talking about
[30:33] fishing and boy he was just you know the
[30:37] Lord told him he got to a place Lord
[30:39] told him to fish or in this little pond
[30:41] he said Lord ain't no fish in that pond
[30:43] I can see the bottom of the Elda I'm
[30:45] gonna fish over here Lord said fiction
[30:47] over here he's I'm gonna fish over here
[30:49] Lord says Mitchell here
[30:54] I didn't make the light of it it's
[30:59] between them the Lord the Lord ain't
[31:02] gonna argue with you buddy he gonna tell
[31:05] you where to go fish and if you don't go
[31:08] fish
[31:08] he ain't gonna beg you all day get you
[31:11] to go right you agree without he doesn't
[31:18] play with anybody do we get her ideas
[31:23] and thoughts and we think oh it's this
[31:25] way that way but think about it what
[31:34] about something that was happening
[31:36] before the word you know before you come
[31:40] into a situation of saying the word all
[31:45] right now we can go back behind that
[31:47] where it says in the beginning was the
[31:49] word weird with guarding the Word was
[31:50] God
[31:52] if we can go back by revelation back
[31:55] there then we can see that there is
[31:57] something like that a reality and
[32:03] remember time hasn't begun yet I know it
[32:11] took six days to make man in the world
[32:15] and all the things Brown said time never
[32:18] begun until sin entered the picture but
[32:25] we one day was this and one day without
[32:27] it one day we had trip over will we had
[32:30] seven days I brother hell I wouldn't
[32:33] want it major study it was your prophet
[32:38] that says he said time beginning when
[32:42] the fall came into being
[32:46] yeah but we don't see that's where we
[32:49] get into all of that and we get all into
[32:52] those things and we wind up naturally
[32:54] confused what about an eternal God
[33:06] never had a beginning never had an ended
[33:12] but yet I don't like this word but it's
[33:16] only word I don't have the education we
[33:18] get he would limit himself to doing
[33:23] things to help you and I now if you
[33:27] think I'm throwing off on God then
[33:28] you're in bad shape he limits himself
[33:31] you remember the other day when they're
[33:33] talking about it what about a God who
[33:35] has amnesia well he can't remember your
[33:39] sin right you can't remember your seat
[33:47] he has the ability to forgive and forget
[33:51] we have the ability sometimes to forgive
[33:55] but we can never forget and see God
[34:07] condescending he didn't send somebody
[34:10] else he came himself when he was
[34:17] existing alone self-existing so you know
[34:23] yourself for sure that I don't believe
[34:25] in all of this predestination doctrines
[34:28] it's around
[34:29] well I always was eternal I could just
[34:33] feel it yeah I believe what the Prophet
[34:38] says about which you better approach
[34:43] predestination the way the Prophet
[34:46] approaches it which is only one way to
[34:50] approach predestination not
[34:54] foreknowledge right
[34:57] I didn't say that your prophet said that
[35:04] so then there's no native thinking about
[35:06] all of this stuff was we back there was
[35:08] we did what we do we're going to get
[35:10] into a message next probably when we're
[35:15] the morning stars sang together sons of
[35:17] God shouted for joy we just remember
[35:20] we're going to still be an eternity
[35:26] not on earth we got to start to hire
[35:31] yeah because I don't know what okay but
[35:35] look here's what I love because like I
[35:39] said we read there in the message the
[35:45] Prophet said in the beginning was the
[35:47] word when the time begin it was word but
[35:57] before it was word it was attribute a
[36:03] thought then it was expressed in the
[36:09] beginning was the expression the word so
[36:14] now we're automatically by paced
[36:16] gentleman John one bilk you following me
[36:22] by way of a prophets delivering a
[36:25] message and that's by revelation we're
[36:27] already back there we have it came we
[36:30] haven't brought any thoughts coming this
[36:32] way yet we're looking at him and how
[36:37] really is and him existing before we can
[36:40] have any thoughts or whatsoever humanly
[36:42] speaking about him
[36:45] we must believe it by faith you remember
[36:53] here while back and I was trying to
[36:55] express anybody in the Bible that ever
[36:57] amounted to anything come by what faith
[37:03] a revelation
[37:11] my brother Dale you just make it
[37:13] confusing how can it see can I say it
[37:18] this way why don't you get the new work
[37:19] on my guest couple of clicks went off
[37:24] some people turned off you know because
[37:26] they don't want to hear stuff like that
[37:27] what is it true it regardless of
[37:31] anything is it true that there's no way
[37:35] to comprehend an eternal God except my
[37:38] revelation you can't put him in a
[37:44] cubical box and try to explain him
[37:50] your probably didn't have him in a box
[37:53] he had him coming from the heart up
[37:59] through the mind to speak about an
[38:05] eternal God then we're going to have to
[38:11] get eternal with him to be able to
[38:13] understand is that so he said yeah but
[38:20] brother you sound like you're talking
[38:21] about that a lot of people need your
[38:23] Newburg brother asked me something years
[38:25] ago about something on a doctrine he
[38:28] said what do you think about it I said
[38:30] brother I think a lot of people don't
[38:31] have anywhere I said that's just fine
[38:34] language how can you how the Neuberger
[38:40] can turn down the word you see no but
[38:48] you're not talk about people like oh my
[38:50] family's out there my dear from idea
[38:53] mine are too but the truth is the truth
[39:02] you can't prop it up or do anything cuz
[39:04] there are families we've got to admit
[39:07] where we're at God could take care of
[39:11] our families we can't see what about it
[39:18] now first
[39:21] of anything you can think of is L ahem
[39:26] being self-existing okay but he dwelt
[39:31] along with his scholarship if you don't
[39:38] get nothing out of the message tonight
[39:40] please think on this time he could have
[39:45] millions and millions of trillions of
[39:48] years to sit under a tree here anywhere
[39:51] you want to put it and think about you
[39:58] and I think of ever nat there were
[40:04] better time like i've ever person that
[40:09] would ever accept jesus christ you know
[40:12] are you going to limit him like that I
[40:16] know I got in trouble trying to explain
[40:18] something one down and I generally do
[40:20] every time I try to explain if that's
[40:21] alright I try to explain it because that
[40:23] means I'm trying to help you it was one
[40:28] down the road one day and a taste of no
[40:30] Baptist preacher that old Baptist
[40:33] preacher preached more sermons I mean
[40:36] more funerals not house sermon again it
[40:39] was wonderful oh man
[40:41] one man that I never heard nothing in
[40:43] all my life about it everybody loved him
[40:45] and I think it was eight preachers
[40:47] preach this fearful I believe that try I
[40:50] didn't go but I read about it everybody
[40:54] thought the world the old man but when
[40:57] he passed me I said I mean I fight him I
[40:59] thought Lord that man he's preached more
[41:09] funerals in the house sermons he loved
[41:14] by everybody but why didn't you choose
[41:17] him
[41:21] and we're not going into the philosophy
[41:23] then being to over there's at it we just
[41:25] keep it like plain language okay I said
[41:29] why didn't you choose him and you chose
[41:32] me to bring the end of this message I
[41:43] don't know I don't know whether he
[41:47] turned the word down not told off on it
[41:52] well I said we could put him in other
[41:54] other range of peoples and think and
[41:57] maybe old enough to have eternal out I
[41:59] don't know that's none of my business
[42:00] that even what I'm talking about I'm
[42:02] talking about a simple point why did he
[42:05] choose you why did he choose you even to
[42:11] be where you are now you don't never
[42:19] think like that the Lord why see I know
[42:25] I go crazy and my thinking is hard
[42:27] because it went on down the road I was
[42:30] thinking about I thought the same
[42:33] thoughts going along that and I thought
[42:36] about a girl that I had an opportunity
[42:39] today but I didn't Jorah but I thought
[42:46] about that girl and I thought Lord what
[42:49] if I to married that girl you know what
[42:56] if I the dated heard and married that
[42:57] normal and she was a Methodist I said
[43:01] Lord I'd probably be a Methodist
[43:03] preacher you see you're stupid I know I
[43:06] agree with you but you know sometimes I
[43:08] have a good time I mean I enjoy it
[43:10] sometimes just thinking and maybe you
[43:15] ever try he's 17 but God knows that
[43:19] better my god I've always tried to
[43:22] explaining this away my God knows who I
[43:27] would marry and what would happen
[43:33] but he also knew what would have
[43:37] happened if I'd married that girl he
[43:41] said now you're going too far why you're
[43:45] limiting your God why do you limit him
[43:52] if he knows every thought you'd ever
[43:54] have George he never would have whatever
[43:57] would think about it why would we worry
[43:59] about in the rest of it when I just be
[44:01] happy we're happy and rejoice and said
[44:05] God chose us and then we go back before
[44:11] the foundation in the world find out he
[44:12] chose us tired we'll get into that later
[44:14] but to think about an eternal God with
[44:23] eternal goals but just remember our
[44:26] point to try to help you if you don't
[44:30] understand how that they could be
[44:32] something back theis the beginning that
[44:36] gives you to see is in the beginning was
[44:39] the word but before it was word it was
[44:43] thought then you'll realize one of these
[44:49] days if you wouldn't up in heaven
[44:50] playing around with in God's mind
[44:53] prophets said you were
[44:55] he said not your being here then you
[44:59] realize there's a great thing to all of
[45:02] this see then God doesn't have a stamp
[45:11] I'll take this one won't take down
[45:19] whatever you think about eternal life
[45:21] just remember you've got to accept it
[45:25] before you can have it so when I come in
[45:30] the world eternal I've you did I got the
[45:33] profit I know where the quotes are
[45:35] I said laying on my desk you want Robert
[45:43] I didn't believe I was always eternal
[45:45] within what did Jesus time solve the
[45:52] whole problem soon but it won't stop the
[45:55] thinking you know when we walk off of
[46:01] this earth when these days church and
[46:03] the great glorious rapture will
[46:10] understand what all this was about
[46:13] and the purpose and plans for all of
[46:17] this
[46:21] the Bible says I'm looking at it today
[46:23] when the Prophet was expressing how that
[46:26] your very being in things will start
[46:29] he's explained it and he dropped down
[46:32] into a scripture he said even the harder
[46:35] of your head and then he watched he
[46:38] stopped see her ever something he moves
[46:41] into the thought and he says you can't
[46:45] add one cubit who your being
[46:53] watch ha why not for one time relax and
[46:58] let God come into our hearts and lives
[47:01] and got us into the truth and let him
[47:07] show how much he loves us
[47:14] but then you remember this one of these
[47:16] days we'll get around to it if he's
[47:20] building a future home to fit our
[47:22] desires you believe that that's what
[47:24] your prophet says well then you mean to
[47:28] tell me he's old like your desires you
[47:35] dishonours is what brings him to you
[47:43] what about it
[47:46] but I love this statement do I like it
[47:49] starting off on what we're going to be
[47:50] talking about when we talk we talk a
[47:52] little bit Sunday there about how God
[47:54] dwelt alone now we're talking about how
[47:56] God dwelt alone with his thoughts see
[47:59] we're backing up a step from the word
[48:01] because it's taught first and then word
[48:08] so just think about it listen to what he
[48:11] says here in the message who do you say
[48:13] this is 1964 number two brothers that's
[48:22] the way he was he was in the beginning
[48:25] by himself God dwelt alone with his
[48:29] thoughts now look at that next word I
[48:33] love it he'll never do that again
[48:41] cause his thoughts are being medic
[48:45] benefit and that's why we are right here
[48:52] this day if God fellowshipping with his
[48:56] dollars in made manifest ours were you
[49:01] look there you are so by taking thought
[49:03] now he's talking about the thoughts of
[49:05] God in him by taking talk cannot add one
[49:07] cubit to your stature you cannot do this
[49:11] that or the other it's God that short
[49:14] mercy is God all the father's giving me
[49:16] walk under me and no man can come except
[49:19] my father draws him that settles it
[49:23] think about him think about what he's
[49:26] saying
[49:28] you'll never dwell alone he was drilling
[49:36] back there with his dogs all along I
[49:41] think he was happy I do I think he was
[49:47] having a joyous time we look at him as
[49:52] just nonchalant they're sitting around
[49:53] wondering what's going on what does I
[49:55] just a spirited just loafing around we
[49:57] don't say there's nothing see we're
[50:06] limiting our God and to bring him into
[50:11] our thought pattern instead of realizing
[50:15] how great he is these are these children
[50:22] to get these children to just think
[50:24] about God being real is my greatest goal
[50:27] in life so why don't you explain this
[50:33] rather I can't explain nothing else but
[50:35] the way I am get the kids to see God as
[50:44] real it's my goal since the gale asked
[50:48] her when she thought we started Sunday
[50:50] school and she said Sam what do you want
[50:52] me to teach I said I want you to teach
[50:54] them little children that there are
[50:58] little David and that they can take
[51:03] their little slingshot of faith and face
[51:06] that main devil and conquering so little
[51:14] I think and small amount that I think of
[51:19] go that's wonderful to me they try to
[51:23] get you to see Jesus Christ all right
[51:26] but do you follow me
[51:27] he said God dwelt along with his
[51:30] thoughts
[51:35] that's back before word now Co we're
[51:38] going to come on down and prove in a
[51:39] minute through the Prophet that it's
[51:41] thoughts first and word but he dwelt
[51:45] alone but he'll never do that again
[51:53] that's wonderful to me now cuz you know
[51:56] what we're part of that look at the next
[51:58] one get number three this God changed
[52:00] his mind but you see God the Great
[52:03] Spirit the father in him was attributes
[52:07] now watch thoughts and attributes now
[52:10] and remember its attributes and thoughts
[52:13] before it becomes word that's the whole
[52:17] point
[52:18] in him was attributes what's the
[52:21] attributes to be a savior to be a healer
[52:23] and be father to be son attribute right
[52:27] so they was there with him any a part of
[52:32] him before he ever even started thinking
[52:33] about us has to be in two beings and
[52:38] what would be and these things that you
[52:41] see displayed now just his attributes
[52:44] being display he dwelt alone he was not
[52:46] even God God was an object of worship he
[52:49] was the great eternal one and in him was
[52:53] attributes such as to be father to be
[52:55] Savior to be healer and now how could he
[52:58] first he had to be father because it
[53:01] proves he was father but he dwells alone
[53:04] he alone is immortal
[53:07] and now but his attributes has to be
[53:13] displayed his first attributes you
[53:20] remember what I said there was at last
[53:22] this past Sunday or when with Linda see
[53:25] everybody's always said if I just feel
[53:28] like I'm in the mind of God I just feel
[53:31] like I'm in the mind Judas Iscariot was
[53:33] in the mind of God what do you want to
[53:40] carrot was in the mind of God Adolf
[53:43] Hitler was in the mind of God I don't
[53:46] want to just be in the mind of God I
[53:48] want to be a part of the mind of God and
[53:50] I thought that's what the Bible said I
[53:53] thought Paul summed it up person what
[53:55] let this mind that was in Christ Jesus
[53:59] being you it'll make you a new creature
[54:05] would it be a part of the mind not just
[54:09] what he thinks up in him was attributes
[54:19] he alone is immortal what about a garden
[54:23] an immortal God now if you want to go
[54:26] with that when you run all you want to
[54:27] call him mortal means flesh mate eternal
[54:29] that's the best definition I can give
[54:32] you for immortal go to the next one
[54:39] wisdom verses faith in the beginning was
[54:46] the word and the Word was with God and
[54:48] the Word was God the Word was in God it
[54:52] was God it was his thoughts that was
[54:56] with him always done God's thoughts is
[55:00] as eternal as God is are you read Amen
[55:07] that ain't skin me up bro yes he loved
[55:10] that one did here it comes
[55:12] God's thoughts with his word in the
[55:16] beginning that's in eternity now when
[55:22] beginning first started time in the
[55:25] beginning was the word God's talk and
[55:26] the Word was with God and the Word was
[55:28] God and his thoughts is what he was when
[55:33] right back to everything relating right
[55:36] down to him and his thoughts and his
[55:39] attributes
[55:44] we'll read one in a minute where Braille
[55:46] runs called it attributes he said that's
[55:48] his desires attributes a part of God if
[56:00] you're not a part of God you never will
[56:02] be
[56:03] we'll get onto those statements as we go
[56:06] along but look what he said what does it
[56:08] take to make a Christian life number
[56:12] five which is e 40 in the beginning was
[56:14] the word and the Word was with God and
[56:16] the Word was God
[56:18] now word is a thought expressed God had
[56:23] in his mind what to do but when he
[56:28] expressed it there's word it had to come
[56:32] into existence it become it's become a
[56:38] reality because it was God's Word
[56:40] expressed I draw the how God's promise
[56:46] in all of your realities in mine just a
[56:52] promise you realize we're promised a
[56:58] change of the body
[56:59] we're promised an eternity after this
[57:03] we're promised a lot of things
[57:05] somebody's going to walk into that why
[57:10] don't we believe we're part of it the
[57:14] other things that just get one man quote
[57:16] the Bible be careful saying those things
[57:19] because the Bible says that they'll say
[57:23] we've heard this from the beginning so
[57:29] you can be fulfilling Scripture it's the
[57:34] next one number six we just melt
[57:35] shattered it that's a good message
[57:39] really to read our listeners and say now
[57:42] in the beginning God dwelt along with
[57:44] his attributes he dwelt along with his
[57:48] attributes now he's making his
[57:51] attributes something right and he's
[57:55] dwelling with his attributes
[57:58] he never became a savior he wasn't saved
[58:01] he never became a healer he was a few
[58:04] what I wouldn't have doctor said I was I
[58:08] got to do with it
[58:11] that's when you come on over here
[58:13] according to the Bible he was the lamb
[58:16] slain before the foundation where we
[58:18] tend to profit turn around say what he
[58:20] said but it's 4,000 years ago when it
[58:23] come into manifestation I'm not there's
[58:25] manifestations there's realities of
[58:26] things right but in God it was done
[58:30] before the world listen that's his
[58:34] thoughts
[58:36] there was nothing just God alone but he
[58:39] had thoughts just like a great architect
[58:42] can sit down in his mind and draw out
[58:44] what he thinks it's he's going to to
[58:47] build create he cannot create he can
[58:51] take something talking about the
[58:52] architect that's been created and make
[58:54] it in a different form because God is
[58:57] the only way only one can create but he
[59:00] gets in his mind what he's going to do
[59:06] that's his thoughts
[59:09] that's his desire he desired to be a
[59:14] savior he desired to be a father he
[59:18] desired to be a healer
[59:21] that was his desire before the world
[59:25] ever begun we're not even talking about
[59:27] physical creations I'm deliberately
[59:31] pulling the quotes to making it Staton
[59:34] but back before not some of these down
[59:38] under here they have quotes about you
[59:40] and me I'm deliberately trying to show
[59:43] you how the Prophet could start in the
[59:44] 40s and through the 60s and hold the
[59:47] same talk that's the way I see a prophet
[59:53] but he gets in his mind what he's going
[59:55] to do and that's his thoughts that's his
[59:57] desires that's a thought and then he
[1:00:00] speaks it and its word then a word is a
[1:00:02] thought when it's expressed is a word
[1:00:05] I thought Express is a word but it has
[1:00:08] to be a thought
[1:00:10] sir so it's God's attributes remember
[1:00:15] thoughts and attributes are the same
[1:00:17] word it's God's attributes and it
[1:00:22] becomes a thought in a word he said
[1:00:25] knowledge attribution is okay you go
[1:00:27] anywhere you want to just remember that
[1:00:29] what I'm dealing with his attributes and
[1:00:32] thoughts and times are the same and then
[1:00:35] it speaks and which is the word you know
[1:00:40] what brother Brennan said he said it
[1:00:42] stuck the logos is like a little feller
[1:00:44] a little child playing outside the
[1:00:46] father's don't worry you know just
[1:00:48] saying let there be he's going to put
[1:00:52] his thoughts into reality go ahead
[1:00:54] number seven sure is we would see Jesus
[1:00:58] in the beginning God was not even God he
[1:01:01] was the great eternal and there was
[1:01:03] attributes attributes with his thoughts
[1:01:05] and then he'd become a word like this
[1:01:08] and a word expressed well a thought
[1:01:11] expressed is a word a word expressed is
[1:01:14] it's all I think no bother he does it
[1:01:20] because that's what he's saying
[1:01:22] well I thought Express is a word and a
[1:01:27] word expressed are spoken he's from the
[1:01:31] dollop are you 400 go ahead to the next
[1:01:39] one
[1:01:39] Christ identified the same he was
[1:01:43] self-existing of him so there was
[1:01:45] nothing to worship him so he was just a
[1:01:47] great eternal now in him was attributes
[1:01:50] and attributes this folks just like you
[1:01:53] have to think of anything before you
[1:01:55] speak it then when you speak it it
[1:01:58] becomes a word and then he is the
[1:02:00] eternal and in him was the attributes
[1:02:03] and he spoken it was the word and the
[1:02:06] word has made manifest as the word has
[1:02:08] made manifest this God becoming material
[1:02:13] look at his word real as he called it in
[1:02:20] speaks it as him coming down to reality
[1:02:28] to material material means something
[1:02:33] founder okay what's the next one this is
[1:02:39] a good movie that the other church a
[1:02:40] book a long time Adam the eternal
[1:02:43] thoughts of God let me ask you are the
[1:02:46] salt regarding tunnel you can if you can
[1:02:49] see this will you see many times God is
[1:02:51] unchangeable in both essence and
[1:02:52] behavior we have studied that and proven
[1:02:55] that already God is infinite in his in
[1:02:57] his abilities therefore he as God must
[1:02:59] be under Xiang if he is omniscient then
[1:03:02] he is not now learning nor is he taken
[1:03:06] counsel even with himself nor is he at
[1:03:10] any time adding to his knowledge if he
[1:03:14] can add to his knowledge then he is not
[1:03:16] omniscient the best could say best we
[1:03:20] could say that some time he will be but
[1:03:23] that's not scriptural he is omniscient
[1:03:25] he has never had a new talk about
[1:03:30] anything because all of his thoughts he
[1:03:34] has always had and always will have it
[1:03:38] and knows the end from the beginning
[1:03:41] because he's God thus the thoughts of
[1:03:43] God are eternal they are real now look
[1:03:47] at he he used up here minute ago a man
[1:03:50] with a blueprint type of thing kind of
[1:03:52] laying it out now like what he says what
[1:03:54] God does they are not simply like a man
[1:03:58] with the blueprint is drawn up in which
[1:04:00] one day will be translated into
[1:04:01] substance and from and formed but they
[1:04:06] are already real and eternal and a part
[1:04:09] of God so now we're back into his
[1:04:13] thoughts we've done come taste the word
[1:04:18] you understand we're going to have to
[1:04:21] get this stock and then let him speak
[1:04:26] but you only speak is the Hogs
[1:04:34] let's look at a few of these aren't the
[1:04:37] Second Coming which is number 10 each 24
[1:04:43] go ahead and rolled it up with you talk
[1:04:45] about the word being made manifest in
[1:04:47] the beginning was the word word with God
[1:04:48] Word was God not a people that the word
[1:04:51] was to take a word is the expression of
[1:04:53] thought it has to be a thought before it
[1:04:57] can be a word won't that driven in there
[1:05:01] I've got a lot of quotes till God in the
[1:05:05] beginning
[1:05:05] gave the thought of what would be spoke
[1:05:11] the word what far not ordinated we see
[1:05:18] we receive the word and it produces what
[1:05:21] God God thought was the word is the
[1:05:25] gospel and C form C we want to speak the
[1:05:29] word that's always been man's kind ever
[1:05:32] since I've been in the message
[1:05:33] everybody's always said we want to come
[1:05:35] to adoption we won't come to speak to
[1:05:36] word I made a statement and everybody
[1:05:41] thought I was contrary to them but I was
[1:05:43] making straight statement I said you
[1:05:46] can't speak the word till you get it you
[1:05:52] can't speak the Word of God until God
[1:05:54] gives you his word you're saying what
[1:05:59] somebody else says you're saying what
[1:06:02] somebody else says and brother branham I
[1:06:05] was looking at you see if we're doing
[1:06:07] that if we're saying what somebody else
[1:06:08] said then what do we do we're just
[1:06:11] talking about somebody else's it's not
[1:06:13] something to you eisah reason I say it
[1:06:17] the way I say it was crazy but Moses at
[1:06:19] the burning bush he said I believe
[1:06:23] you're the God of Abraham Isaac Jacob
[1:06:25] but I ain't going unless you give me
[1:06:31] something personal
[1:06:34] how much more personal could it be made
[1:06:37] than what God said to Moses and I've got
[1:06:40] it in the last year no we won't get to
[1:06:42] it but I made this statement for 40
[1:06:45] years it's an all phrase point I mean a
[1:06:47] little bit I don't mean wrong I mean
[1:06:50] that I've quoted it saying one thing for
[1:06:52] the tea when it is you know but brother
[1:06:57] branham is explaining Moses receiving
[1:06:59] the thought he said it's God's thought
[1:07:02] transmitted into the mind of Moses he
[1:07:06] said it's Moses Tom said it's not word
[1:07:10] yet he said Moses then speaks it what's
[1:07:19] wrong you're six a biased shots on me
[1:07:28] look at your children and say they are
[1:07:31] saved look at them and say they're lost
[1:07:36] you're saying what the devil says I
[1:07:38] don't need that he needs somebody to
[1:07:41] stand on what he's saying well you can
[1:07:46] bank on one thing if I ever say it it'll
[1:07:48] be God telling me to say it well why
[1:07:50] don't you try you know once you just
[1:07:53] tried why don't you just start out by
[1:07:58] saying by shots on the yield you might
[1:08:03] walk into it you heard Wade testifying
[1:08:09] there Sunday
[1:08:10] let that man over in South Carolina that
[1:08:14] they told him he had three months to
[1:08:16] live
[1:08:16] this guy was or something up in a
[1:08:18] college or doing something he wouldn't
[1:08:20] listen to like Jack like guy like us he
[1:08:22] was a good guy and he just helped me
[1:08:25] he just he'd go with me and put me take
[1:08:28] me in the woods and help me and walk
[1:08:30] with me and day after day and didn't
[1:08:32] feel nothing sound it is that if we just
[1:08:35] had a good time but when he told that it
[1:08:43] wrong down inside of me I went out in
[1:08:48] the truck and got my Bible got a prior
[1:08:51] clock you've heard it told walked up to
[1:08:55] him and I said Terry you know what that
[1:08:58] is he said yes I am I do bad this
[1:09:02] preacher extended I turned with us I'm
[1:09:04] going off on he was just looking
[1:09:07] I said Terry did they say you got three
[1:09:11] months he said yeah that was in March I
[1:09:14] said we'll see you in November he said
[1:09:20] okay we'll see you know better November
[1:09:26] rolled around he was there telling the
[1:09:27] whole place doctors lawyers all kinds of
[1:09:32] people that were sitting in there said
[1:09:35] the Lord healed me I'm healed he went
[1:09:39] nine years about a year before he died
[1:09:42] or so he went on an Alaskan down sheep
[1:09:46] trip where you just walk four miles up
[1:09:48] into the mountains or things like that
[1:09:51] he was a great friend but you see it was
[1:09:56] just he said well what told you to say
[1:09:59] that I don't know I just said it once it
[1:10:03] matter
[1:10:06] that dad just preached you might've pray
[1:10:08] for a no problem
[1:10:09] he might have prayed for him to be
[1:10:10] healed I got no problem I'm not trying
[1:10:13] to gain sin yard these are gained
[1:10:14] popularity SHhhh just know one thing for
[1:10:18] sure the man was healed right then
[1:10:19] because he lived for nine years instead
[1:10:21] of three months why can't we just go on
[1:10:25] and believe it but see we got but I was
[1:10:28] the first one that said that I said it
[1:10:31] first now know if that's I'm just honest
[1:10:36] if that's me are you or anybody that
[1:10:39] says I said at first you didn't say it
[1:10:41] you didn't say what God said it might
[1:10:44] have been that little child if you ever
[1:10:46] noticed what I've done here minute I
[1:10:47] took a prayer cloth and I stood around
[1:10:50] and said every man woman and child
[1:10:54] take this prayer clock and pray
[1:10:56] over it we send it in God heal it could
[1:11:02] be the least little child that contacted
[1:11:05] God what you see we've got to get it all
[1:11:08] blowed up I was the first one when you
[1:11:12] say that then it's for sure you what the
[1:11:13] first one is that plain enough because
[1:11:16] that puts me right in the middle of the
[1:11:18] whole time okay all right let's go on a
[1:11:21] little bit funny what's the next
[1:11:28] identification
[1:11:32] 1964 and in the beginning said Saint
[1:11:41] John for one was the word and the word
[1:11:43] with God now word has to be a thought
[1:11:47] before it's a word because the word is a
[1:11:52] thought expressed your ear
[1:11:57] whatever you do you're speaking it's a
[1:12:00] word you'll find out when we get to it
[1:12:02] that word lo gosh it has called multiple
[1:12:07] meanings if it means speech that's what
[1:12:14] it means it means speech and you had
[1:12:18] never caught on to really what brother
[1:12:21] branham will do a lot of times in
[1:12:22] listening to it and knowing like Jesus
[1:12:24] in the scripture Jesus breathed oh did
[1:12:33] he
[1:12:33] I'm honest I'm sorry do you go no he
[1:12:41] just spoke said receive you the Holy
[1:12:44] Ghost I didn't get it right then no
[1:12:48] problem we'll see we look at it like
[1:12:52] it's got to be up but remember it is
[1:12:54] word I've asked you to do one time I
[1:13:00] mean remember this one I've asked you to
[1:13:03] do one time
[1:13:07] you never notice about your breath and
[1:13:08] what it does sometimes turn the back of
[1:13:13] your hand and lay it like that and start
[1:13:16] praying you'll feel that our breathing
[1:13:23] those words that's what God does
[1:13:30] he's the breath of life you can feel it
[1:13:35] just just put your hand up down pray
[1:13:37] just put your hand up right now and just
[1:13:39] start saying hallelujah you can see a
[1:13:42] man you can move the hires when you hang
[1:13:44] him word has to be a thoughtful force
[1:13:50] work cause the word is without
[1:13:51] expression in the beginning was the word
[1:13:53] words with God the word was gone he was
[1:13:56] God and the word the Word was made flesh
[1:13:58] and dwelt among us okay let's get a
[1:14:01] couple more because these are the points
[1:14:07] or what I want to make from the message
[1:14:09] of trumpet give an uncertain sound but
[1:14:13] that word still stands eternally because
[1:14:16] it is a word and before it was a word it
[1:14:20] has to be a thought and a word is a
[1:14:23] thought expressed and God in eternity it
[1:14:30] come into his mind he expressed his
[1:14:37] thoughts it become a word and the word
[1:14:41] has to be made manifest well brother
[1:14:46] Dale I thought when you here's crazy
[1:14:48] when you began to tell us about God
[1:14:51] being a being and trying to emphasize on
[1:14:53] that too much well surely you probably
[1:14:55] think I really am crazy now but God
[1:15:00] thought it over before he spoke
[1:15:08] God it come into his mind what he wanted
[1:15:16] to do go to Christ mr. God reveal at
[1:15:19] least before Sunday and read we read
[1:15:21] around talking about the plan and
[1:15:23] purpose of God we're going to get there
[1:15:25] eventually whom conjuror
[1:15:41] let me just read these off will close in
[1:15:48] order to know if you want took your hand
[1:15:50] holler I'll give it to you now before it
[1:15:52] can be a word it has to be a fault for a
[1:15:55] word is a thought expressed and if God
[1:15:59] in his mind preceived these things then
[1:16:05] they were in his mind then he spoke them
[1:16:09] and they're just they're as good as
[1:16:12] finished when God speaks because he's
[1:16:16] infallible before it could be a word
[1:16:20] spoken it has to be a thought because a
[1:16:24] word is a thought made manifest when God
[1:16:28] speaks now back in the back back in the
[1:16:32] beginning when God looked down through
[1:16:34] the corridors of heaven and saw all the
[1:16:37] things that we're going to that we're
[1:16:42] going to happen on the earth we're going
[1:16:45] to happen did you ever sit and just draw
[1:16:51] a picture out in your mind now that's
[1:16:55] the way God did it go ahead that's
[1:16:58] number 14 can you get it back up 14 but
[1:17:05] it's the infallibility before it could
[1:17:08] be a word spoken has to be a thought
[1:17:10] before it was a thought made manifest
[1:17:12] and God speaks now back in the beginning
[1:17:14] when God looked down to the quarters for
[1:17:16] heaven and so all the things that we're
[1:17:19] going to happen on the earth did you
[1:17:22] ever sit down and just draw a picture
[1:17:24] out in your mind now that's the way God
[1:17:27] did it you ever notice brother Brennan
[1:17:30] the pilot says I'm kidding a thought is
[1:17:35] coming into my mind says now let me
[1:17:38] express it and this is why I love it he
[1:17:41] said for these little children and he
[1:17:44] said I'm one of these little children to
[1:17:47] where we can get it I love those don't
[1:17:50] you
[1:17:50] did you ever sat down and draw a picture
[1:17:52] out of your mind
[1:17:54] brother Gary and remodeling a house I'm
[1:17:58] already done with it all but anyhow he's
[1:18:00] got in his mind what he wants to do he
[1:18:04] sought it out
[1:18:06] yeah alright and he sets down and he
[1:18:09] thinking well as far as his thinking he
[1:18:12] said I'll do this on the debt off with
[1:18:14] this Europe at that and then he goes and
[1:18:16] makes it into reality right go into
[1:18:23] masterpiece and listen to brother around
[1:18:24] and talk about Michelangelo in his cup
[1:18:27] Ramos's he had in his mind what he
[1:18:29] thought to others there was a block of
[1:18:32] stone but to Michelangelo it was Moses
[1:18:36] sitting there waiting to come out into
[1:18:39] reality and glory God did it per house
[1:18:43] in the beginning and then it seemed good
[1:18:46] to him so he spoke it and as soon as it
[1:18:49] was spoken it became a word but all was
[1:18:52] expressed in a word
[1:18:53] now listen once God expresses his
[1:18:55] thought and makes it a word he could
[1:18:57] never take it back he can't take it back
[1:19:03] no way can he take it back
[1:19:07] a thought had to be a thought before it
[1:19:10] can be a word now this is God's thought
[1:19:17] that he has placed in the word when you
[1:19:24] read now that's a force field the word
[1:19:30] itself has spirit its spirit and word
[1:19:32] form and you see what when it is
[1:19:35] quickened by quickened are brought to
[1:19:37] life the spirit of the word goes to work
[1:19:39] and actually because that now look a
[1:19:42] thought has to be a thought before it
[1:19:44] can be a word and then when a thought is
[1:19:46] presented it is a word see when it is
[1:19:50] presented
[1:19:51] now this god stop now this is how much
[1:19:54] the Word of God God's thought that he
[1:19:56] has placed in the word and then when we
[1:19:59] receive it from him it becomes a bird
[1:20:04] you realize what he's saying I would to
[1:20:10] God I had revealed in my heart what is
[1:20:17] written in my head wouldn't you you know
[1:20:22] what I mean you've read it you studied
[1:20:25] it over and over wouldn't it be
[1:20:29] something to have all of that into your
[1:20:30] mind and come out of it with a beautiful
[1:20:34] talk the God before the world is
[1:20:38] listening that prophet he had in his
[1:20:40] mind what he was going to do and he
[1:20:42] comes out and he steps out as a word and
[1:20:44] then he fenced in the word is the logos
[1:20:46] which is a son and he steps out and he
[1:20:48] says let her be what about a man could
[1:20:53] take us all the way back to that alright
[1:20:57] God's thoughts that he has placed in the
[1:20:59] word and then when we speak it from him
[1:21:02] it becomes a word God revealed to Moses
[1:21:06] what to do Moses spoke it and it
[1:21:08] happened see that's it when it really
[1:21:10] comes from God okay I want to read this
[1:21:17] one so go ahead and sir number 729 will
[1:21:20] be one continual reading there's many
[1:21:22] paragraphs but I would ask you to go
[1:21:25] home and listen to this message I read
[1:21:28] it 1954 1003 the morning service the
[1:21:34] word became flesh in the India trip but
[1:21:43] now here it tells us that before there
[1:21:46] was a man before in the beginning was
[1:21:49] the word the Word was with God and the
[1:21:50] Word was God
[1:21:52] Lord Rickard and the word Word made
[1:21:55] flesh that's just about as far as the
[1:21:57] human mind can go on one one as far as a
[1:22:03] human mind can go that's as far as you
[1:22:06] can go back now to the beginning is that
[1:22:08] right in the beginning was the word but
[1:22:11] now that's as far as we can go by
[1:22:14] theology that's as far as we can go by
[1:22:18] our mind but revelation carries us
[1:22:22] beyond that is that right if you're
[1:22:27] teaching something on theology you think
[1:22:30] in the beginning was the word word with
[1:22:31] that was God and the word was Garcia
[1:22:34] theologian can read though sign this
[1:22:38] word the same word was made flesh and
[1:22:40] dwelt among us and then God was made
[1:22:42] flesh that's without controversy that's
[1:22:45] true God was made flesh we believe that
[1:22:48] but now before this was word what is a
[1:22:51] word a word is the manifestation of a
[1:22:57] thought is the expression of a thought
[1:23:02] is that right before you can say
[1:23:04] anything subconsciously you think it
[1:23:08] before you speak it and that's right a
[1:23:14] word first it was thought then it was
[1:23:22] word I love that about Moses because we
[1:23:30] can relate to it what about a man riding
[1:23:38] basically the Old Testament no you got
[1:23:42] all the other writings but you know I'm
[1:23:43] talking about the main point of the word
[1:23:47] Moses get all of that about Genesis or
[1:23:54] did get all of them time from the
[1:23:57] thought Paul pick it up in the New
[1:24:02] Testament and look at him where did you
[1:24:04] get all of that from the thought brother
[1:24:09] branham look at all the things that he
[1:24:12] went through and explained to us where
[1:24:15] to get it started on the thought a
[1:24:20] meditation a talk and then he would just
[1:24:27] bring it out so much until God would
[1:24:29] come into plain view
[1:24:34] I've set another day just thinking now
[1:24:36] weep about it to think we as Baptists we
[1:24:46] wanted to know about God all these
[1:24:49] people they want to know about God these
[1:24:51] churches they're not all that bad some
[1:24:53] kind of they want to know about God but
[1:24:58] they turn down the channel my way that
[1:25:02] God could speak to them that don't stop
[1:25:08] the little Bride of Christ
[1:25:10] come on musician they don't halt the
[1:25:13] little Bride of Christ she goes right on
[1:25:17] down the road believing God's Word
[1:25:21] listening to a man explained about God
[1:25:28] the one thing that we should all want is
[1:25:33] to know more about him he said but we
[1:25:37] don't need to know him by Inlet you
[1:25:39] cannot know him by revelation until you
[1:25:42] first hear it by Inlet I wish you'd get
[1:25:46] that out of your mind it's got to
[1:25:49] because the Bible says faith what cometh
[1:25:52] by hearing fake don't come by anything
[1:25:56] else it comes by hearing and hearing by
[1:26:00] the Word of God letter Branum the great
[1:26:07] prophet as he was what would he say he
[1:26:10] said he talked to that angel an angel to
[1:26:12] say something to it he said the Holy
[1:26:15] Spirit which would tell him something he
[1:26:17] said go spend the rest of the day
[1:26:21] searching and I you know that you don't
[1:26:27] never think like this enough it's a
[1:26:30] great Holy Spirit that birthed a man
[1:26:34] that done all the things and yet it
[1:26:36] would tell him something you need to go
[1:26:40] home and study it
[1:26:44] I'm still holding skirts are you doing
[1:26:47] studying I told you well we know for
[1:26:51] certain that wouldn't hold expiry right
[1:26:53] we know for certain that wouldn't the
[1:26:55] Holy Spirit Holy Spirit was so happy
[1:26:58] what do you think he reported back to
[1:27:00] the Father
[1:27:01] you remember adoption and how he takes
[1:27:02] back he says your son is down our
[1:27:04] checking out he said I went and told him
[1:27:06] I told him what it was and said he's
[1:27:10] spending the rest of the day checking it
[1:27:12] out the father says give him a little
[1:27:16] more give him a little bit more Oh
[1:27:22] wonderful go ahead brother all got less
[1:27:24] tan first it's about
[1:27:37] all those attributes then it can be made

[1:29:13] [Music]
[1:29:14] oh Jesus the only red random our
[1:29:26] thoughts are louder in heaven that our
[1:29:28] words on earth and certainly we try to
[1:29:34] keep them cleaned up what about having
[1:29:38] the right thoughts
[1:29:40] what about sitting down and just
[1:29:43] thinking about the Word of God thinking
[1:29:47] about God and what he's done for think
[1:29:54] about what's been to your life were you
[1:30:03] been and where you come from what you've
[1:30:05] done I brought you out of all these
[1:30:08] things
[1:30:16] what a wonderful time to think about God
[1:30:22] called about us
[1:30:30] he knows exactly what you're not going
[1:30:32] to do but he ain't gonna force us into
[1:30:37] doing anything he doesn't do that he
[1:30:42] leaves us a free moral agent he allows
[1:30:49] us to live me he doesn't make us do
[1:30:56] anything oh no how long he makes us he
[1:31:00] just made us like I seen him at that
[1:31:02] feller said well he's over here fish
[1:31:05] over there I just walked away because I
[1:31:08] didn't want to hinder his testimony and
[1:31:15] I didn't want to thank wrong but I just
[1:31:19] didn't think if you argue with God
[1:31:21] I just don't come I never never did
[1:31:30] Father we ask you to just speak to each
[1:31:34] one of our hearts and knowledge we've
[1:31:37] tried to express what your thoughts are
[1:31:40] how great they are how wonderful a day
[1:31:44] to think about that we could just be
[1:31:47] something that we would just start up
[1:31:49] even if we're lost and die and go to
[1:31:51] hell but to think about it Lord that we
[1:31:54] could be thought of in heaven and our
[1:31:57] names would appear there and you would
[1:32:00] consider us and what's more is it Lord
[1:32:05] if we just yield ourselves to you and
[1:32:07] get out of the way and let you think
[1:32:09] your thoughts to us and everything will
[1:32:13] come out better be with us on the way
