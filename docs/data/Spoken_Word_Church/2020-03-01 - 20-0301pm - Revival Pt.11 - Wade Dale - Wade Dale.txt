church and for a while they wouldn't let me go to church either but and I never heard of William Branham but when I was in high school I have a grandmother who had went to Pentecostal church and she would tell me things about the Lord and remember one day she's telling me about a Wednesday night prayer meeting they had and she said the fire department was called out somebody had seen fire on the church and she said the fire department got there the church was not on fire but there were little licks of blue flames got across the top because they were having a prayer meeting it it was things like that they're influenced me and I was probably that same age as some of these young brothers like Zac black Michael and when I the day that I I was thinking what brother way was preaching this morning I know the day that I knelt at the cross at the feet of Jesus and gave my heart to him there was a light came on inside and I didn't know it had been dark inside but from that from that day my life changed and that's been more than 50 years ago anyway this song has been running through my head for the last two weeks and now we've been singing it in here but I'll do it again there's a river

there'll be no communion today brother Dale wants us to wait until he's here which is fine because today's Sunday is first for sunny but we'll wait till the second kind second Sunday so also remember junior 18th to the 20th our Father's Day annual fishing trip will be in it's actually Roberts town Georgia Helen area we've rented a 25 25 room lodge so we're gonna have a good time and it's writing

to discuss their trip that they're going on so long just pray for them thing find a place thing all agree on we just all agree we can agree on I mean it's not a problem for us we just anyway let's go to Psalms 138 8 decisions decisions Bible talks about the valley a value of decision let's just let's just hope thing get it done Lord to open up a place for them to have alright anything else any other announcements same thing I'm missing so I think night just remember officer brother Dale will be having a shoulder surgery on March the 10th if he gets over this cold he should be having this shoulder repaired so not replaced but repaired so just remember him he's been having some trouble with that so may the Lord bless him I hope you enjoyed this morning that was that was that was something that needed to fill in some gaps and then it will go a little bit further because listen you'd have to be just so narrow-minded like brother Brown said one time a man was so narrow-minded he could take a lead pencil put it between his eyes and they touched both eyeballs that's how narrow-minded some people are that this world is in a famine we got plenty of food plenty of water plenty of good stuff and still you see this coronavirus thing but but worse than that you see for the hearing of the word of God there is there it's narrowing down to a pencil point or a knife's blade edge of where you can hear the true Word of God and be fed by it and not only be fed by it but go on up the Statue of a perfect man and go on in God to the change of the body it will not happen without a word revival that's why we've been speaking on word revival it I mean healing is fine the the healing where Bibles and all these different reforms and all these different things they're good they have their time because they're in the body and you can't do without them but you and I as we said before as brother Branham told us yes this morning we're the final voice final means finality there is no other voice in this age but the bride of Jesus Christ and when we go over into another dimension that voice will continue in to take 144,000 out but it will be to no one in a Gentile age it will be in this age right here this other parts of the world there's no revival there's no there's nothing there's no God except to the 144,000 that are promised through two witnesses to culminate and put us in the Millennium Amen so let's focus in it's to you and you only the bride they can listen the umbrellas out there the healing and the signs and the miracles and the wonders God will do that whether you're saved or not a prostitute can pray to God and be healed but now that doesn't heal her soul if she gets a soul healing then she won't be a prostitute anymore okay I'm using that as a worst-case scenario but I'm telling you we we need to be careful that we don't take on that same spirit of adultery that's brother Branham remember he discerned that spirit of adultery on this man he wasn't committing physical adultery with his wife against his wife he was committing spiritual adultery from the Word of God so it's the same demon it's not it's not a it's not there's a real bad adulteress demon and then there's a kind of a nice adulteress demon no it's all the spirit of adultery brother Branham says you've taken a husband that's not yours that's committing adultery so if you take on a false doctrine that's taking on another another another bridegroom everybody got the upsell it's a solemn time but God promised we would make it we're going to make it someone will make it all right so Psalms 138 verse 8 let's go to the warden prayer the Lord Jesus thank you for this day that you give us that we can stand here Lord truly you know in my heart it's the purchase of your blood the greatest people to stand on the face of the earth that we can speak in front of them Lord today but father let it not be just a speech or words of a man but Lord let it come straight from your heart right to the people Lord that truly as the song says open the eyes of our heart open the eyes of the soul of our being that we can feed from your word Lord they did not be a natural food that we're looking for but a spiritual food that we're seeking Lord as we talk about water and rain and revival Lord what a refreshing time to have a good cold drink of really good clear water and Lord as we sit here today and we listen father may that clear crystal water come down from heaven and bathe each one of us Lord and give us a renewed spirit give us a renewed life as we you see many times people being caught in a desert and they're thirsting they're not calling for food they're calling for water just a little bit of water and how water nourishes Lord and how water brings us back up Lord and revives us father we pray that you'd do that to us today Lord we're needy people we need you more than anything father so I pray that you'd come on the scene father and you do the speaking you'd be the one that does a revealing father there any sick among us you said you sent your word and healed them and delivered them from destruction we pray that you just touch each one in this building the ones that are not in the building all the ones that are affiliated with this sanctuary with this people in the internet and different things brother Dale sitting home there father we pray that you just give him a supernatural charge that your blessing father and an anointing father for the work that he still has to do Lord just be with each one bless us take care of us keep us strong here father and give us this day our daily bread in Jesus name we pray amen Psalms 138 eight we're gonna kind of background a little bit and then we'll get into where we left off this morning though I walk in the midst of trouble that would revive me I want you to make sure that's you he's talking to you thou wilt revive class participation that would revive as brother John says I want that's not good do it again me thou wilt revive me thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemies and thy right hand shall save me I've sorry I was thinking while I was done did you know it's somebody you got a bunch of excuse me you got a bunch of older people in a room and they're playing bingo and thinks they stalk but when that girl a woman hid that bingo card they take a body change and all the other people go here and they'd to go but no really that we should be we should be happy what God said about us and if it'll ever strike you like it would if you want a million dollars in a lottery or in a bingo game then you know watch and thou shalt stretch forth thine hand against the wrath of mine enemy and thy right hand shall save me the Lord will perfect that which concerning me thy mercy O Lord into forever for Satan off the works of thine own hand someday d5 one turn this oh god of our salvation caused on anger toward us decease wilt thou be angry with us forever this is David crying out to God look they'll be angry with us forever without draw out that anger to all generations he's asking a question but he says wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice indeed let's go ahead and rename us because that's what we're going to get to behold the day days come saith the Lord then I will send a famine in the land not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from North even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now let's go ahead and read this I have another prayer that that brother Branham prayed I listen I don't I do not advocate that brother Branham was our intercessor but some of the prayers that he's praying I believe he was talking to me I believe he was talking he wasn't talking to them ever how many hundreds of sin to congregation that day back in 1964 he's talking to me because this is an updated revelation that I have that God's talking to me through this man [Music] God's talking to me through this man the man's not God so we get that straight than ever the picture is just so beautiful all right until there's only one intercessor between God and man and that's the man Christ Jesus and then then Paul says follow me as I follow Christ so let's read this one here we're brother branham's praying God created me a revival let me be the revival let each one of us be the revival the revival in me make me Lord to hunger make me to thirst create in me Lord that what is needed in me let me from this hour on be more consecrated servant a better servant more blessed of you more able more Humber more kinder more willing to work more looking to the things that are positive and forgetting the things that are in the past and the negatives let me press toward the mark of the high calling of Christ amen so that to me is a mouthful that is what I am trying to get to you that God is talking to you and telling you that we we and don't don't get me wrong when I say we don't need these other revivals but we've already come through these other revivals a healing revival and restoration and the different things that's not for me and you though our revival is a word revival that will change our bodies that will bring a resurrection and a rapture that's what we're looking at because obviously it hasn't happened in the other six churches sure they're sitting in heavenly places they have the baptism of the Holy Ghost but they didn't have a word revival to bring that thing to a culmination or to the headstone the only time the headstone is supposed to come is now and to me that is the word revival now there's there's partial word all down through here they had to they had they had they Paul had the pure unadulterated word but it wasn't all open because the book was still closed where is the book open in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound at the end of his message not the beginning at the end of his message he's going to sound an alarm or a trumpet we're gonna maybe if we get to it this afternoon we're gonna read we're brother I'm talks in the rapture book about a shout a voice and then a trumpet all right so we've been talking about the voice the voice of many waters the voice crying out there's the voice of one there's always a voice in every age Luther Wesley penticoff all the different ones but they've never they've never had the voice open under the open book which is the opening of the seven seals look Paul had nothing at all didn't know anything about the seals he died before the seals were even given to John to write in the Book of Revelations that there would be a seventh seal open and no one spoke of it until you see a prophet prophet coming in the end time and he starts telling us about he doesn't say word revival but it is a word revival it's the word being revived it's not being changed remember they wanted him to write a new book a new chapter a new Bible and he said no that ain't gonna work this Bible right here can't be changed that's why I said if you don't see every major doctrine come out of this Bible you've got a problem you've got another God Amen just like Daniel seventy weeks and all the different things you can't change the Bible the Bible is right everything else is wrong but when you have a word revival where is it coming from the Bible this is the only word there is there is no other book that we need to turn to and because the Prophet came in the end time and God threw that prophet pull those sails back listen start throwing Tomatoes you can throw some oranges too less vitamin C amen but anyway the Seventh Seal is what and for brother Branham because the seven seals is the full plan of redemption and he had to go off the scene he's in the ground waiting on somebody to become what he said hey man waiting on somebody to become us being then the final voice in Malachi 4 Luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 in the days of the voice of the seventh angel well remember that's not anything exclude we're not exclusive because in the days of the voice of the first angel there was a word sounded Paul didn't finish anything brought a message the people caught the message and they carried it on and then their revival began to what why did their revival why does a revival die down now listen you can say well they get tired of it how you gonna get tired of the Word of God Satan starts bringing in logs he starts putting logs different ideas and different sayings and different this and different that he starts bringing these things in and it clogs up God's program so God just says hey I can do something about that I'm gonna bring an Iranian and he's going to bring a message and that's gonna revive the people same water no different water now same way with brother Branham he didn't bring a different water he brought us a way to get those logs out and by that time there were so many logs in the water that Jesus was on the outside of the church trying to get back in that didn't put him all totally out of the church not in any other age brother Brown said was he put completely out of the church except this age right here and we read that this morning about spewing them out of the mouth but this revival that we're in will it will from this day forward I'm talking about today 2020 March the 1st it cannot and will not wane it cannot and will not go down oh you say well everything looks bad you know the old saying is people look around say well boys are brides in bad shape never has been never will be the true bride you're looking at the mixed multitude you're looking at even even the honda parts and then there's somebody Joshua Neelam there's somebody made it to the promised land because God promised that's why it's called a promised land somebody made it to the promised land if it wasn't it would just be land but it's so promised land and you're what's our promised land about gives my Holy Ghost through the church ages but now I promised land now it's not just getting the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's going up this statue of a perfect man knocking those logs out of your ditches so that what brother Ram said so the Holy Spirit that's why he put it right here that's not a different Holy Ghost and you got down here it's the same Holy Ghost but what's it doing its sealing all this together so that it can come to a place to where that can be what filled in and the caps don't come or the heads don't come and change our body and then mm-hmm I know that's that's about 10 summer sermons worth right there but still it all has to do with a revival it all has to do with the way we look at the Word of God we need to look at the Word of God more now more rich more pure because if you got the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're gonna make it can't not make it there goes another promise acts to repent every one even be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sin for you shall shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for the promise is T that's the promised land that's why it's brother Dale has been preaching on Paul Paul was back and says day without us cannot be made perfect there was nothing to perfect those people in the Old Testament they didn't have the Holy Ghost in their soul had an anointing that would cover them until Christ died but now you and I don't have that excuse now we know the blood covers us we know about the token but I'm telling you something folks I was reading a quote back here just a few minutes ago brother Brown said God said God didn't come just to just just to cover you over God didn't give you the Holy Ghost in the end time just to cover you over and hide you know he came to eradicate your sin he came to put it in a sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered again because you and i are you know the scripture tells us here we go off again the scripture tells us that he's coming back for a bride without spot or wrinkle now those that have went on they had spots and wrinkles while they were here sorry they were they were caught in these Church ages couldn't get all the way out properly God told us but you and I have the ability now by the Word of God by the open book by the word revival that you and I are going to be brother Brown says the sinless perfect bride of Jesus Christ what by the opening of the word same thing they had same Holy Ghost but they never went on and continued to have enough word to take them to where they can stand one day and say I and my father are one I am the resurrection and the life we'll get to that maybe in just a just a little while so we know that number two let's read real quick this revival is just the stirring on what you already know about we already read that several several hundred times now number three testimony on the seat then we begin to find out miracles didn't taking place in the more like they were the sick go home sick it isn't because of God it's because of the lack of the revival among the people now remember it's not going to be a worldwide revival right it'll be an individual revival it will not be as it was before we'll take a tent and go put it out in a community all that's over with sure they can do that that's fine but the bride the bride's revival is a word revival and it will completely like I said this morning I'm telling you we still have problems with the word everybody do this we still have problems with the word because we're still here but Jesus never had a problem with what the father told him and if he says that we're to be 1 John 17 weird to be one as he in the father 1 then there can't be an argument that's what we get the logs once we get to the River of Life folks when we get to that new city there's nothing to hold that River back all sins gone all worries gone all our own ideas are gone it's just a free-flowing River but that listen it's got a free flow in your soul and in your person so that we can't get out of here anybody got that say man that's what word and you say well I don't know if I get what you mean you don't know you can do it you've been equipped for the job we're astronauts brother Brown says we're prophetic people love revelation but the problem is is we think we got our own right Bob we think we got it not Bob but we you know you talk about other people they have these little different doctrines and yeah it's not your own idea it's got to be the Word of God not our own ideas brother Bram said it's because the lack of the revival among the people there's no revival they sit and listen and go home well I guess that was pretty good there's not that zeal there's not that something in the people that should be there I wrote myself a note there's got to be a pull which we sing I feel the pull I mean really come on honestly people every service do you fill a poll or you're just here to see the neighbor are you just here to exchange recipes or anything just protects while to see your boyfriend our girlfriend which is okay it's a good time to meet them here not somewhere else not advocating meeting them somewhere else but you feel the pull that you need more words that you need more word I need some more God you got yeah I'm giving you some son that's fine daddy but I want some more I want some more I got a log here and then when I get this log out of the way right that feels better when the waters flowing free man I hate for my toileting to back up I don't anybody ever has that problem Louis what are you smiling about Oh him anyway will not go there but I mean don't you hate that day I just messed your whole world up when there must be a secret going on back there by something but don't you just hate it though when you have your you know you go and you wash your hands and and you do all these things you go to the bathroom and eat your flesh the toilet are you are you doing your dishes and you pull the stop router you're flipping you go water is running everywhere why because your flus have been stopped up there some things topped up your your plumbing and it's not nice that's the same way with God we want this thing to flow that's why that that now and I appreciate I really do when brother Joe and some of them took over for the song service not belittling any other song leader at all I promise you is just the way things happen they come back here and you'll see them come in our office we're not in there talking about yesterday's news or today's football score right what are we doing brother John we're praying that God will anoint him to do his job first brother Joe brother boy and all the different ones that he'll anoint them to do their job and also their praying that God will anoint us to do our job now if we would do that more often we might get somewhere because prayer changes things but you know what that's the flow of the service that's what I enjoy I enjoy the flow of a service I don't like confusion there and God doesn't like confusion what brother Brian said God is not the author of what confusion all right so let's not if there's any type of confusion that's why I said this morning fits the in type of confusion we need to get together and talk about it because we want this thing to flow we want God to have preeminence we want the we want all the logs to be gone because that's Deadwood we want all that Deadwood to be gone before we walk through that door amen yeah somebody said the other day they come to this brethren from another church not here and told the brothers in I'm just really nice that's you and your wife stopped at the door back there and and gathered together and pray before you come in service so we really think that's great and the brother said well to be really honestly it says we're what we're doing is is praying and asking forgiveness for all that stuff we told said to each other before we got here coming to terms raise your hand well I'm gonna raise both of mine okay Boyd's got both his up well that could ruin a service if you don't get it out it could stop back there Bray you can start your argument that's the service again Julie you can start afterwards no boom listen we're just human but I'm telling you what though if you take this word revival anything you need it's in there for any situation you know what it's not gonna stop you from arguing you're two different human beings and you got families children grandchildren but there is ways to get rid of it before you come in the sanctuary and be able to talk to God and God be able to talk to you so that's what we're talking about is we feel you know you should feel the pull that you don't walk through that door you should feel in your heart something's not right take care of it right there then come into the house of God because brother Brown said here say there is not that something in the people that should be there and I believe it's that extra little desire to do what God says Joel 2 verse 23 let's get through this be glad you children of Zion now who's he talking about yes now I want you to see this because I picked up something else on this again I love the Word of God because if you you think you've gleaned everything you can glean off of it and all of a sudden God says you need to talk about that for just a minute so we've read this about six times so we're going to read it again for he hath given you the former rain moderately and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former rain and the latter rain in the first month what it takes rain to grow something you can't grow anything in dry ground it takes the moisture right and the force you'll be full of fat I mean wheat and the facts shall overflow with wine and oil now look I will restore there's another promise he is going to not leave this bride tree a stump so here's mine here's my extra revelation he's going to reverse the process if those four eat it down if those four eat it down there's got to be four that bring it back up the lion the ox of man and the Eagle the baptism of the Holy Ghost brother Branham says for death messengers eat the tree down and for life messengers bring it by so he's going to reverse the process if if the locust each one of them had something different meant what the locusts eat the leaves or something I can't remember all that it's not just for another sermon but the locusts did apart well God's got to bring something to restore that part by it to bring that tree back you got to reverse the process you know brother Brown said one time it's somebody saying well what do I do about these about these demons that I have them you know of all these different I'm stings you know he said what do you say do the vice of mercy that's a direct quote so do the opposite watch what God's doing he's let this thing eat it down but he said I will restore through the reverse process if this one eat the leaves I'm going to send somebody that brings back the leaves and the leaves was what the leaves was I believe the worship and all that stuff you you see now what brother Brown did brother Branham came to restore us back to the faith of the father's restore us back to this tree this restoration of the bride tree our this revival and it couldn't come by anything but the Word of God so to reverse anything you've got if you see Satan's eating down do the vice versa of it if Satan gives you something you know if the devil gave me a bad thought about Bob I just go up to him and Huggies neck and say God bless you I love you man I said if Satan gives me back okay blame it on him if Satan gives me a bad thought about brother Bob but same way with anything doing the vice versa go to the Word of God full of promises that will give you the reverse process if it had to be eat down it's got to be brought back and it's got to be brought back with rain it's got to be brought back with moisture it's got to be brought back putting it in the right ground number four don't let that bubbling brook you don't need filter or strain no pumping no jerking no nothing else it's just there bubbling up I don't have to depend on local rains to fill it up rains or revivals where that fountain there's at the fountain of life where the carcasses the Eagles will gather you don't have to pump up a revival you don't have to pump up nothing everybody got that same man you do not have to pump it up all right so let's go the next one real quick mm-hmm it's what we read this morning revelations it had in his hair was white like wool white as snow his eyes were flames of fire and his feet like unto fine brass said their burning furnace and his voice as the sound of many waters brother Branham says and his voice go and read the read just a 4-time and his voice was the voice of many waters both Christ in the church speaking together in other words she saying what he said with no argument because she is him with a golden girdle around about the breast part of the church covered over holding the gospel holding the righteousness of Christ over the church I love that quote let's go to Patmos vision and get then we'll get to the Book of Amos he's talking about the hair highest planet he's reading what reread the sound voice of many waters voice of many waters what does waters represent if you want to mark it down revelation 17 15 the Bible says the water which down sauce is thickness and multitude in people in tongues all right voice what a horrible thing for a drifting soul on the sea of life no pilot to guiding loose floating with the tides to hear the roar of the great cataract at the falls what a horrible thing that would be to a soul drifting voice of many waters what is his voice is the judgment the voice of the Esther's through the Holy Spirit that's cried out to the people in every age standing there the voice of many waters cried out thickness and multitude the voice of the seven stars in his hand ain't it wonderful to know that we know every one of them's and by name ain't it wonderful people read this and they go seven stars seven this seven that they have no clue and I'm not saying that derogatory but is that they don't go say well I know the first ones Paul Iranians Martin Klump no but God sent us a little seventh grade education prophet and took him in the back side of the desert took him in Arizona took him all these different places and he placed every one of them exactly to the man of those seven stars now we have not just seven stars we have seven stars with names on them a man so thank you Lord for sending us a prophet and every church age preaching the baptism of the Holy Ghost baptism in Jesus name speaking in tongues the power of God resurrection of Christ the second coming divine judgment the voice of many waters come forth from this one that looked like the Son of Man what is in time where do we start I'm we're supposed to be the son of man the son of man is that listen the son of man was Jesus Christ standing on the earth right what is it in the end time Jesus Christ standing on the earth he just can't get here he's got to come to a bride amen now watch the voice of the ministers the final voice to the final age John 7 verse 37 and the last day that great day of the feast remember Jesus was in church Jesus stood and cried saying if any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he didn't believe it on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water what a promise and I like that song like sister Barbara was saying we were we were singing it today there's a river of life flowing out from me from me make the lame to walk in the blind to see open prison doors sent the captive free there's a river of life flowing out from me amen Amos 8 verse 11 now let's get into this what we were talking about this morning just for a few minutes we got a really good note coke story behold the days come saith the Lord that I will send a famine in the land now this is this is also a promise all right so we got a promise not a famine of bread nor thirst for water but of hearing the words of the Lord and they shall wander from sea to sea and from North even to the east they shall run to and fro to seek the word of the Lord and shall not find it in that day shall the fair virgins and young men faint for thirst alright let's go to the Hebrew lexicon what is a famine is hunger it's famine in a land or a nation and then figuratively it's a famine for the Word of God individuals lack of food now what is the Word of God the Word of God is food amen cart where the carcass is brother Branham said where the word is the Eagles will be gathered there and it's fresh food not old food all right so look now also listen this morning let's look at the four things that famine does number one and I like this because just leave that right there number one keep this in the back your mind number one a famine moves people people have to move because of a famine 99.9% of the time people don't stay in the land where there's famine because there's nothing there amen it moves people it moves them to make a decision oh I like that it moves them to make a decision you think it's the worst thing in the world it could be the best thing in the world to you and during a famine there's lack of water there's lack of moisture and there's definitely no growth or they would be something would grow and you would have something to eat and there would be no famine alright so famine moves people moves them to make a decision it's a lack of water or a lack of the word there's no growth development you can be stunted going upset your perfect man and also death is included in famine because wherever there is famine there's most the time death all right there by okay with that say ma'am don't get bored with me now Genesis 12 verse 10 and there was a famine in the land and Abram just sit still no no Abram went down into Egypt was so during sojourn now listen Abram left and you'll see brother branham I didn't bring the quotes to save time on this one but he says that Abram got out of the will of God he's actually talking about Israel in the church talking about Israel getting out of their homeland God's not going to bless Israel until they get back to their homeland and he's not going to bleed it and blessed Abram till Abram went back to Canaan but the famine drove him out but it was still part of Abraham's journey to get to Abraham if I got that same M it was still part of Abraham's journey to learn a lesson to not go to Egypt and what is Egypt type the world alright now let's look in Ruth 1 verse 1 now it came to pass in the days when the judges ruled that there was a famine in the land and it actually caused a group of men to move and a certain man of Bethlehem Judah went to sojourn in the country of Moab he and his wife which was the husband and excuse me Naomi and his two sons which wound up marrying Oh Oh anyway artha thank you and Ruth so that was part of Ruth's journey but the famine had to move them to another place everybody got that so we set this up watch second samuel verse 21 chapter 21 verse 1 and there was a famine in the days of David three years year after year and David inquired of the Lord the Lord said it was for Saul for his bloody house because he saluted to gibeonites because there was something he did wrong first King 17:1 and Elijah the Tishbite this is what we're gonna we're gonna hone in on this one here because it's Elijah that's the first coming of Elijah we've got the fourth coming of Elijah it's got two parallel something somewhere mm-hmm and Elijah the Tishbite who was of the inhabitants of Gilead said unto a have as the Lord of God Lord God of Israel liveth before whom I stand there shall not be do nor rain these years but according to my word let's read what he said in Jezebel religion number seven watch him take this all brother branham could tell a story my he could tell a story and you just feel like you were right there sitting right there watching the thing you know what because he was sitting there watching it unfold God had given him a vision of what what he was talking about now through that you can you and I can get a vision of what's going on so watch now it looked like that he was sent to take what little she had but it was vice versa when she was willing to give what she had in support of the word God fetter and if you're willing to give what spirit you do have what spirit that God's give you to support of the word then God will keep you alive hallelujah Oh glory to God do you see it Church don't think I'm beside myself I'm not but once you have what you have got listen to me what you have got what little you do believe in God what faith you have got place it on the word not or not no organization not an organization put it in God's Word he'll keep you alive she was ready then because she couldn't before because they wouldn't let her but now she's ready will she receive it God sent a prophet her way updated revelation 20/20 did God not sends you a prophet in your way amen will she receive His Word will she receive this prophet yes she did and he told her he said now what little why if you've got place it in here and bring it to me first in other words she had that one little cake left that was all the life there was and the Elijah said bring it to me she agreed what and what happened when the rest of the world was languishing and dying in hunger her and her children in her household all eat three good meals a day divine revelation on the word I hope you see it friend what went on and he stayed there until the famine was over living with those women won't live in lieu this woman this church that received him and believes his word and he kept her alive kept the church alive by the word of the Lord because he said thus saith the Lord have you accepted thus saith the Lord have you accepted though folks the only reason we're still alive not physically the only reason we're alive spiritually is because of that man right then brother Brian brought us a message to keep us alive until God came that's what he said he stayed with her now listen brother I'm physically not with us but his voice his message is his message is with us and will be with us until the consummation let me tell you how important a prophet is now we're going to talk about Joseph here for a minute and once you realize the timing of this revival and the timing of all these things because we haven't spoke on revival ever I don't know here but now we're talking about revival and there's things happen in this that's bringing this revival to pass even we see people see people brother-brother black here you know bring bringing coming back to the Lord and realizing that he needed to change his life and and realizing that that he had some logs pretty big ones but you know what doesn't matter they be a redwood forest full of logs God don't care he'll get rid of them for you if you let him but we come to this place and we're fixing to read about Joseph now remember we're gonna set the story here because Joseph Pharaoh has a dream right everybody got that I'm gonna set the stage Joseph is in Egypt actually he got put in prison but Pharaoh had a dream about seven good-looking whatever you wanna call it cows whatever you want to call them seven good ones and then you see seven bad ones the seven bad ones eight to seven good ones and then he has another dream about seven ears of corn real good pretty ears of corn and then seven skinny ears of corn and they in other words they either eat or you know they take over the seven good ones well nobody in Egypt could tell Pharaoh what was going on so God sent Joseph his reputation got out that he could tell an interpretation to a dream so Pharaoh brings him out of them out of jail brings him up to and Joseph said Oh said you're gonna have seven or seven years that kind of called them kind kima the seven cows and the seven bad ones that eat them up it's going to be that you're going to have seven years of good and seven years of famine same way with the ear corn told the same thing we're reading here in just a second but I want you to realize you say well that was important that was not near as important because who knew when the seven years started who knew Joseph was the only person that knew when those seven years of plenty started now there's for sure we know when the seven years of famine because you gets after the seven of good but it took a prophet in his time to come to a group of people and say the famine is going to be in seven years but we can the good year starts now you said what are you saying brother wait seven years we didn't know when they started and we didn't know when they ended but a prophet did listen to this Genesis 41 I'm when it's kind of a long reading but I'm start first twenty eight this is the thing which I've spoken unto Pharaoh what God is about to do he show us unto Pharaoh behold there comes seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Egypt like I said before when were they already in it wasn't going to start the next year because they had to put up seven years they had to put up plenty to last for seven more years of the drought so it took a prophet to come into the land and tell us or tell them when it started and there shall arise after them seven years of famine and all the plenty shall be forgotten in the land of Egypt and the famine shall consume the land and the plenty look and the plenty shall not be known in the land by reason of that famine following for it shall be very Grievous you got to know when it started and for that the dream was doubled under Pharaoh twice it is because the thing is established by God and God will shortly bring it to pass now therefore that Pharaoh take out a man discreet and wise and sent him over the land of Egypt let Pharaoh do the and let him appoint officers over the land and take up the fifth part of the land of Egypt in the seven plenteous years and let them gather all the food of those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the city and that food shall be for what we talked about for food Word of God okay the Word of God this has got a spiritual meaning behind it there by a grace a man and then let them gather all the food for those good years that come and lay up corn under the hand of Pharaoh and let them keep food in the cities and that food shall be forced or to the land against the seven years of famine which shall be in the land of Egypt that the land perish not through the famine and the thing was good in the eyes of Pharaoh in the eyes of all the servants and Pharaoh said unto his servants can we find such a one as this a man in whom the Spirit of God is now watch and Pharaoh said unto Joseph for as much as God has showed thee all this there is none so discreet and wise as thou art now watch what Pharaoh does right here thou shalt be over my house and according unto thy word not mine I'm Pharaoh I'm the king if I say die Dolph I say live live right but he has transferred power to Joseph and according unto thy word shall all my people be ruled only in the throne will I be greater than thou only in the throne there's only one god but he has transferred the power of the voice to a man that knows what he's talking about to save us in the land of even in the plenty to store up what a brother Brown say in the vision the angel said store up food and of court I love this according to thy word shall all my people be rude Joseph was the second most powerful person in all of that Kingdom only in the throne will I be greater than now we can't be greater than God but he told us that we could sit in his throne and the voice that we speak if it's the voice of God it will come to pass let's read number eight here angel of the Lord 1951 see people a long time ago you ought to have come to God and got yourself settled down here what brother I'm saying he knows when that seven years of plenty is and he knows when the seven years a famine is going to be see people a long time ago you oughta have come to God and got yourself settle down know where you're standing the Bible said in these days that there'd be a famine not for bread and alone but for the hearing of the word of God and men would go from east west north and south trying to find it and would fail you better get sealed into the kingdom of God by the Holy Ghost while you got a chance you talk about a confusing time it's here I'm not saying that's coming you talk about a confusing time it's the coming when the Bible said they'd be seeing so close well it would deceive the very elect if possible it's not coming folks the prophecy he spoke is right here today amen you believe that it would deceive the very legs be possible all right the curtain of time number nine will move forward here just today I was reading a little place in scripture Joel I mean Amos 8:11 where it said there will be a famine not for bread or for bread and water but for hearing of the Word of God people will go from sea to sea from east to west to and fro everywhere seeking the Word of God and failed to find it if that don't fit this nation at this time I don't know where it is that's 1955 we don't need bread we got plenty of it we got plenty to eat plenty of clothes to wear nice home to live in and everything but there's a famine for the hearing of the word of God a man know what to believe you're all I'm just telling you what brother Brennan said you're all confused one says this one says that and one says this one says something else base your thoughts on thus saith the Lord God will confirm it this word revival will cause a confirmation to come to you to ease your mind where am I at what am I doing here where am I going number 10 this is the next prayer won't you listen to this brother brown's praying united under one head 1958 and god if there ever was a land that needed healing it's the land that we live in and we pray that you will heal it by sending an old-fashioned revival that will cure it of its diseases its spiritual ailments hmm you might have thought something else no spiritual ailments thou has give us plenty of food good clothes but all we long to hear the word of the lord thou has said it in the word there will come a famine in these days and people would run from north to south and from coast to coast seeking to hear the word of God and would fail to find it listen to this Oh God anoint your ministers afresh Lord may we get out into the field with the word plant the real word if there's no word no seeds sowed there will be no harvest listen it doesn't matter how much it rains if the seeds not planted in the ground there's nothing going to come up brother Brax my brother I'm sitting on seed there's nothing too quick and there's no seed there there's no seed of life give us strength now while it is day that we might show the seed of life to the dying in perishing millions for asking in the name for his glory amen we come to a place that we have it we're brother branham opened the seals and this would be our last thought go to Matthew 24 verse 7 I know this is all familiar but still still has to do with famine because when brother Brown was talking and in bringing us the seven seals remember he refers back to Matthew 24 where Jesus preached the seals and that was seal 1 through 6 everybody got that same am matthew 24:4 nations your rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom and there shall be famines now listen there's been families and pestilence and earthquake all down through time right natural but what about the spiritual families that we've all been through all these are the beginning of Sorrows then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you and you shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake now this is the third seal and this is the fourth seal what fourth seal is a raptured seal go back to go back to where we've been in in the seals when that whole year so let's go back to revelation 6 verse 5 when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I'll be held in the law of black horse and he that said of them have a pair of balances in his hand and heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat now remember brother Branham said that wasn't the voice of one of the beasts that was Jesus Christ amen but I got that say men we've not been through this and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny brother Branham talks about that being a famine because they start charging for the food and see they'll not hurt the oil in the wine and when they had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see I look and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death that's this in time that's the time right now what is a famine you say well what's going to happen they're not killing us by the sword of natural they're killing us by false word amen and the hunger which is part of famine and with death which is hooked to famine because you and I in the end time know for a fact that Satan being that fourth horse rider which is the pale horse that that's the power of all four three horses put into one horse and man all of Satan's power the XOC a power that he has not Dunamis the exosphere power that he has he's trying to amass and he listened he didn't want you to die listen Satan is not a murderer you do the murdering for him Satan physically can't kill anybody how does he kill you stay at home don't listen the tapes talk about your neighbor talk about your brother run this one down run that one down too that's the killing because it's a killing of the inside man brother Brown said if you killed a man's influence you've killed the man listen we're not we're not in the end time of looking for now we know there's going to be a battle that's gonna happen when we're out of here this is gonna kill a lot of people physically but the very reason that you and I get out of here is because Satan has killed so many people spiritually until zonal there's only a few left and it has to be through a word revival that you and I Satan listen say it doesn't matter how many healings you get Satan doesn't matter it doesn't matter to the devil anything you do like we were talking about the other day Satan's God's right-hand man Satan was his worship angel so now they have worship centers and they worship hours and hours and hours of just worship and no preaching Satan enjoys that say it doesn't mind that at all that doesn't bother him at all what bothers him is when you come to church and get a revelation that God is talking to you and gives you a promise and you hold on to that promise and it quicking something inside to listen Jesus Christ walking into the desert he was he was so hungry 40 days first thing Satan sensing pouring to that big old rock over there I'd make a big piece of bread you could really eat that big old piece of bread you just turn it into a into a piece of bread and you can just eat it Jesus looked at him and he didn't you know you didn't he just look I'm sure he just turned to looked at him and said it's written you're not supposed to tempt the LORD thy God Saint said well what am i dealing with here then after you get to the 3rd when Satan's done knock back on his heels so far the Bible says he leaves in something he's never done to me I like what brother Larry skogen says he's I'm gonna do something the devil will never do he's I'm fixing to leave you but the power is in the Word of God and that power has to lay inside of you it has to be that you we come to adoption to where Pharaoh tells Joseph it's your word you can't be God Joseph but you can act in my stead I instill what I have into you and besides being a creator being the one that created you you've got every other power that you need and that came from the word of Pharaoh the word let's go to job five till five verse 17 because listen folks we're going to still be here and we're gonna still be dying still getting old if we don't do something but remember you can't do anything but pray it down you pray it down you pray read your Bible I know and I'm as human as you are you want to brother Dale when he gets to the very end of a powerful series he's been on and you're sitting there with your toes curled up in your shoes and you're sitting on the edge of your seat not asleep sitting on the edge of your seat and you want to say God he's gonna tell me some little something and I'm just gonna take a body change that's not the way it work sorry it's this great crescendo that we're coming to you know we're gonna we're gonna bring this thing to a to a powerful end and this whole building is gonna shake I wish remember a famine you can be in a famine but you can survive because a prophet told you you can survive that little woman listen God didn't come to her when the barrel was high full God didn't come to her when the barrel had about three or four days worth in it God came to that with a woman by a prophet of God the very day she was gonna die the very day she got to her last piece of meal and God sent a prophet now listen I'm gonna humanize this thing how many of you being the mother of a baby and you're down to your last meal so you know what you've done you've rationed for a long time before that listen they ain't been eating three meals a day before that and all of a sudden they just got one pick know she's been sectioning it out and maybe giving more to the baby and she's weak she's hungry herself she knows that this thing's coming down to a close and then a strange man walk up to your door and go bake me a cake women sisters what would you say to that man don't say that loud what would you say though bake me that cake you know she said she just told him one time she said this is my last meal me and my boys gonna eat this and we're gonna die it never fazed Elijah one bit Elijah did not compromise on why he was sent there Elijah did not compromise on why he was sent there he said bake me a cake he said but I'll promise you in other words dust at the Lord you do this little bit and you'll eat in plenty three square meals a day until this famine is over with what's God done to you and I he may have came down to the last time you need you had something and he said hey listen to what this guy's got to say listen to what this prophets got to say listen to what this fivefold ministry has got to say with the voice of the Prophet flowing through them is it important it saved her life and it saved her son's life so let's listen to this joke 5 verse 17 behold happy is the man whom God correct this boy that's kind of controversial isn't it blessed isn't happy is a man who God correct us therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty for he maketh sore and bind us up he wound it and his hands make whole he shall deliver thee in six troubles hmm yeah in the seventh there shall no evil touch thee what church are we in in seven there shall no evil touch thee in famine he shall redeem thee from death and in war from the power of the sword old folks we're gonna have battles but the war is already won thou shalt be hid from the scourge of the tongue neither shalt thou be afraid of destruction when it cometh at destruction and famine thou shalt laugh neither shalt thou be afraid of the beasts of the earth let's go to Psalms 33 18 behold the eye of the Lord is upon them that fear him upon them that hope in his mercy to deliver their soul from death and to keep them alive in famine giving you some promises here some 37 18 the Lord knoweth the days of the upright and their inheritance shall be forever they shall not be ashamed in the evil time and in the days of flats famine they shall be satisfied that's what the Word of God said about you see that he's already put that provision in there he give you that provision the days of famine he said by the way you read us that scripture and Amos he looks kind of bad it does look bad but I remember one characteristics of a famine is as it moves you makes you make a decision every day you're at church you have to make a decision brother Brown says you either leave worse or better you have made a decision to keep that demon in you or you've made that decision to lay him down and walk out that door Oden you and a free person now listen one more quote and brother Anderson this is one I was going to use in the rapture message and this will bring it to a close remember Jesus told us he said my sheep know my voice my sheep know my voice the voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride are gonna be together in the endtime rapture message 1965 the first thing is the sounding the first thing is the trumpet or he stops he said a voice a shout then a voice then a trumpet shout a messenger getting the people ready hmm the second is the voice of the resurrection the same voice that allowed voice in Saint John that called Lazarus from the grave getting the bride together and then the resurrection of the Dead to be caught up with it now watch the three things take place the next is what was a trumpet a shout and a voice of trumpet now the third thing is a trumpet which always is the Feast of Trumpets calling the people to the feet and that'll be the bride's supper of the lamb supper with the bride in the sky so you better not be looking you better not be looking for that will already be changed and over on the other side when that happens the first thing comes forth is his message calling the bride together what the boys are a shout a shout to break what hey hey hey hey I wake a few of you up just when somebody shouts what's the first thing you do you turn to see what's going on you turn to see what's going on so my shout says hey what what's going on all right listen the first thing comes forth is this message calling the bride together the next thing is the resurrection of the sleeping bride the one's died back in the other ages they're caught together and the trumpet the feast in the heavens in the sky well that's the thing that takes place friends we're right there ready now the only thing look the church is coming out has got to lay before the Sun to ripen now what brings that listen that's what I want to bring this last point you've got a former in the latter rain the former rain is what the teaching rain are the rain that breaks the seed open and gets the thing to start growing is that all right say ma'am now remember here's a key the latter rain which is the harvest rain listen you don't harvest anything during a rain [Music] there's hard I don't know of anything what do you have to do you have to wait it dries it sure the harvest rain is going to come the let the latter rain is going to fall is falling now but it's not to harvest it's to get us ready for the harvest everybody got that same in one more time the corn is out there in the field you got you heart your former rain it brings the plan up which is the teaching rain to show you how to go up the Statue of a perfect man but you can't harvest that corn when it's wet it was sour on you anything that you harvest wet unless you want to make I'm sorry if you want to make beer or something with it cuz that's where it rottens but if you want true grain if you want true corn you wait until it dries it has to go through a famine it has to go through a famine but there's life in it there's life in it but that you say well what do you say brother wait well you can't say the harvest rain is what we're it's what we're looking for it's too late if you think the harvest rain is going to be when they harvest listen lay before the Sun to ripen and it's not raining though you've already had your rain right now we're having our ladder rain falling on us to give us a harvest but you got to lay in the Esso in to ripen the great combine will come by after a while the wheat will be burnt or the stalks but the grain will be gathered into its garner we Sam brother wait let's don't look for a harvest rain the harvest rains falling now and the harvest is going to be the resurrection not that they're not the same we're getting our rain now but we've got to go through a drying period we got to go through the famine but even as we go through a famine I want to ask you a question as the musicians come I want to ask you a question as it logic aim by your house as Elijah came by your house and promised you that your cruise and your barrel will not run dry that during the time of famine that he will absolutely sustain you give you strength for everybody else it's dying all around you but there's no harvest during the rain we're getting our rain now we're getting our revival now we're not looking for it I'm looking at it because if you don't if we keep pushing it this way in this way we're gonna be a bunch of wet grain and God's not going to harvest wet grain we're gonna have to go through a period but God's going to sustain us and keep us so whatever you you know that's why I've been trying to tell you this word revival brother Brown says it's not gonna be some whooping something or somewhere you work it up and you've got all the great signs and wonders I believe there I believe we can we have them but that's not my foundation of this revival it's not that I've got to see signs and wonders I thought signs and wonders followed after the believer and man I like what brother Danny steamin did that time he took two kids and he he put them behind him he's told this one's name a sign and this one name is wonders and he was the believer and he started walking down the aisle and he said signs and wonders follow the believer not in front of them a man saw them kids following him all over the place but that's a good point the greatest sign and Wonder is is that you'll make it to the end of this thing and you'll take a body change where nobody else has done it before let's stand our feet if you have a need today but you should be able to accept it right in your seat believe what God's already said about you if you don't get nothing else from today ask yourself a question as the Elijah came by and said thus saith the Lord your crews won't ever run dry don't worry about what's happening out in the world don't worry about it what it looks like out there I will sustain you I have given you thus at the Lord we live under the staff the Lord but he doesn't say it except he says it to his little bride first listen he tells us he tells us his secret not the world I want you to know one thing's for sure my brother Ernie says you're absolutely connected to something eternal and being connected with something eternal that makes you eternal with eternal thoughts and eternal qualities that you and I have got to come to a place till we doubt
