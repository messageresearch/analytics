========================================

but his own received him not but as many as received him because he power to become the sons of God I'm quoting scripture you realized then that when the Lord Jesus started out there doing don't you think of what a wonderful day he was having when he seen his people turning him down rejecting him on every hand and yet he turns around and there's a little Gentile woman he said Lord this is just crumbs his crumbs off the table you know he said that's not right for me to give it to you he called her a dog did you have no right for none of these time she said yes Lord I said the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table the Bible said he said I have not seen so great a faith in Israel she was a Gentile don't you think with his heart he would Almighty God don't you think with in his heart he already knew the story he knew that they'd reject him as Messiah but he knew the Gentiles would receive him so did he come to the Jews yeah he had to do that like the Apostle Paul had to be to the Jews right okay but then when it finished up he said I'll leave you I'm going to the Gentiles see the Lord Jesus look at all of that when that man come up and said to him don't come over here said just speak the word and said my server to be healed that was Gentiles and he said Oh Lord look at that he could see what he was a-doing building up and so what's watch 1 conv o Israel has always been chosen people right then you tell me why he walked down through there and didn't choose a big group he had toyo when he got through and one of them was the devil he hand hit'em Gentile dispensation coming into view speaking of it he said come on Peter come on guy come on you don't think like that that thrills my heart I realized he knew that there was the Gentiles that was going to accept him for what he was just saying and they did accept him but look Church what was eaten away back there in that time it was not the new birth it was eaten away it wasn't that it was the point of the statue of a perfect man the things Peter and Paul talked that was what was rejected that was what was eaten away in the Dark Ages and there was that couldn't be nothing else coming forth and he'd start with ruler to Luther with the just shall live by faith that wasn't restoration brother Brennan said it wasn't and you listened to him that's what I say you listen to him and you'll get massively confused or even you get straightened out if you let the Holy Spirit take care of it but everyone said Luther was Reformation he said Wesley was Reformation Reformation is carnal reform something you think you have something to do with so look at Luther he thought he had something to do with that justification he did he accepted it but by accepting it he didn't get the full understanding of it he got what he had and what was needed for the time that put him into the body listen see then what did it turn out to be how did it turn out to come forth they come forth in an understanding that you and I didn't know what in the world we were talking about when we heard the profit season I say that piece oh yeah I had a great understand yeah nice told you you want to take your understanding we'll talk about it not being sarcastic and they're hateful but I had a good understanding of the Bible remember where my story comes from did I read Malachi 4 and said according to the Bible there's gonna be two prophets coming was any of you looking for two prophets to come no that's what I'm saying see then I say things like that and you think I'm sarcastic and hateful and Argus is any problem with telling the truth see I didn't have any trouble when brother mo said brother around him was a prophet you remember the story when I told him I said listen you saw the dead raised you saw this that healed you saw the Word of God being spoken I said I didn't see it so I can't do it but I said you tell me what he taught in the Bible you tell me what he told in the Word of God and I'll know whether he was a prophet or not I still stand with that today can you put everything you've got only he was a prophet when something comes up there's like I said when a statement comes up that you're born again and then baptized into the body do you still believe the Prophet was right even though you'd admit maybe you don't understand what he's talking about we can get down on the hard things okay see do we really believe brother branham was a prophet when he preached there was one week left after the rapture and we argue with him that it only thrilling a half years left after the rapture do we believe Ryland was a prophet the best way to say it is I don't understand okay that's the best way to say something when something comes up the best thing to say is I don't understand because at least you've got it on its heart out of it and God can help you I can prove that right here but bring it on you see I'm not arguing with nobody about the word it takes one thing about it there's things in this prophets message that your human mind is never going to comprehend it can't comprehend what a prophetic prophet was bringing we've tried to figure it out we've tried to do everything and we wound up just getting further awake cause we're not as was not he saying that in those seventh seal when he says go on as you are in trouble don't try to figure all this thing out especially with this seal coming up tonight he said go on and he said this stay with the same simple message said it'll be made known he remember that quote would have we done that or we tried to figure it all out what you see Joel said I will restore now giving us a minute then we'll quit Joel said I will restore what is to be restored not a new birth it was never taken away I don't care what age you want to call it or whatever do you want to do with it brother Brad said every age I'm quoting him every age had the baptism with the Holy Ghost then you burn the art that's number one drive that stake down they say that's it that's all settled but do we believe that what he brought to us was the truth then we I mean in your own mind ain't asked me to raise hands I don't do it cuz see that just gets embarrassing I thought it's bad to raise your hand today and then go fluid tomorrow okay then go down because you don't understand but listen Church it was not the new birth that was eaten down all right it was not the headstone that was eaten down go to that and come yet I've got the quotes laying right here in front of it hadn't come yet it's not the love or a capstone of the statue of a perfect man it was not eating away all right so what was eating away what is between here and there and see we say eating the way you look at it like taking the Bible to turn out them pages not any what I'm talking about I'm talking about this Bible needs to be revealed to you and me if it's revealed then we have what is saying if it's letters on a page we have letters on a page me the disciples had the revelation of Jesus Christ right now listen to me for a second did it aside both how the revelation of Jesus cry I can ask you shake your head because there's Michael boom you know I'm asking to be sensible in your own head the disciples never taught a Trinity there was no such thing taught in the original disciples even though this guy what was his name sir it says come along at the same time right after Paul writing that period closer and he was already teaching Sean it was trying to in wrote he was already teaching that Jesus was just a demon God which was another God you know flesh man's or something that wouldn't ride all right he was trying to do those things but the one God held true to the fourth church age I'm quoting brother Branham so if you want them I'll give them to you the one God true stayed to the fourth church age and they's even things Church D you don't listen and don't pay attention to that's why people think were the most illiterate people that you can say and truly a lot of people are you know there's people in the days of Martin Luther that taught the Godhead truth right because there's a little line that all the ways that come through that's why when you're Baptist comes up and you say what do you believe they'll say we believe in one true and living God they still teach one God ask them they'll different Trinity they'll get onto your body Trinity they don't believe in a Trinity if they're real good badness to the church what happened down through the ages the revealed word is what was either way the real truth the revealed word began to be eat away cankerworm palm worm locust caterpillar they begin to eat it down they didn't do away with the words in this Bible now I'm trying to illustrate it so if you listen I'm not stolen no stones or asking you I'm just saying to place it and ask you for a raise of hands but how many of you believed in the Trinity before you heard of this message in one way or the other no God see mine was garden three persons cuz brother Mon asked me what I believe I said one true and living God he said explain that I said okay Father Son and Holy Ghost is Lord Jesus Christ God in three persons Blessed Trinity he stopped he said you just as Trinitarian interesting I said would you explain yourself sir he said a father is a father and the son is the son and a Holy Ghost of the three and you're a human and you're this and you're that he went through a simple little illustration and he said there's one true God what do you believe I said don't believe what he used to that's no problem to me I saw it in one illustration and that ended it I didn't mean I understood the Godhead no way I'm still amazed at it I still ain't never preached all I can see about the Godhead we get any eternity I'll take care huh we can talk about it down through the eternity and say you mean you understood that you don't understood the death but listen if you'll admit to one thing we'll move on if you'll admit humanly speaking in your mind that at one time you was a Trinitarian you believed in three guards or you believed in some way different from brother branham's explanation well we put it that way you believed in to some way different from the explanation of brother Branham all right now if you do that now you won't internet you listening that that's all I'm asking you do I'm asking you just be sensible what was wrong with what we were doing when we were teaching the Trinity well I mean I believed in Jesus I believe in jibt I could prove to you I could go through it I was in the Baptist Church we we've valued reading and studying I could go through the Yahweh's I could go through the im's I could tell you Jehovah and what it meant and how that Jehovah goes back to the word Jehovah C which goes back to self-existing the Bible tells you that I could read in the madness and take you back to all the way up till it would put Jesus standing back there yet I know where I was wrong because you see he wasn't standing back there I love it when the Prophet said it they just thrilled my soul when he made their statement he said when my hand said in the garden he said God never left him he said he didn't go away and leave him that he said he'd come right down to live with mankind the thrills my heart to realize they don't matter how sinful we are he's still an advocate if we just realize he's still on our side we gotta worry about no problem okay but listen now when that new little streisand can you understand what was eating away the revelation of one God the revelation that he was one true and living God you know that most people call us oneness you know they call us one that's what caught of our believing and you know to most people and I can sit down and talk with you a little bit about it on that line most people are oneness because it's one like your finger to most people what did the Prophet say he said if one like it's the deaths not yeah we think we've got it all figured out what's your if you open up your mind enough to think about what I said that to understand that we did not understand the truth of one true and living God then now we can preach the rest of the night if you could understand that one little thing because then that one little thing will show you we didn't understand predestination you know predestination with a Baptist doctor Presbyterian and a Baptist you know that the the bat and I knew this in the Baptist Church you know that the Baptist Church was started by two brothers and they split the church over predestination and they come out of will well I'm glad I fell off there because I had to do that somewhere one of these days I had to do that so I'm glad I got that done that's predestination no that's stupidity accuse me but I'm getting a little point can you see you didn't understand one God can you see you didn't understand predestination and like I said did you understand the engrafting of the Gentiles that was not the mystery to be brought by the Prophet Paul brought the mystery of the engrafting of the Gentiles that's why you want to be in the message of truth I'm trying to lay down some little thoughts were your mind will think how many of us believed hell was eternal until we heard of the Prophet in other words we come into the message we've still brought living hell was eternal and we know that can't be true so what was eating down Paula I've never talked no eternal how old's or anything like that they never talked nothing on that line they talked the truth Paul talked the truth of predestination those who he foreknew he did predestinate that solves it that answers the whole thing you get anything in predestination fold over that scripture you're wrong how come the scripture says those who he foreknew he did predestinate so it goes to foreknowledge I see it took a prophet to figure them out listen these guys right here up to where you come in to here at Luther now these guys up here to the fourth church age they taught it correctly oh yeah that was enter runs of people and God trying to change them and get them to old messed up and everything but yet it never changed that church she stood on that word but then all of that was what was eat down he didn't take out the Bible where it says God and God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ that ain't - Lissy trying to get you to see what went out where you can see what come back in what went out was the understanding of the true revelation of one God the true revelation of predestination the true revelation of serpent seed Paul taught serpent seed and when I heard that and heard Brett around him and what he said I said oh glory no wonder them fire see so Jesus and we wouldn't born in adultery they knew what Sir Percy was that's what they told him we wasn't born in fornication like you let you see Church we didn't understand that it took the prophets message to open up in those things to what we could understand you know the prophets message in the basis of returning the ministry now give me a second on that part so what it was it was not up on the Ohio River that you that you gonna turn the hearts of the children back to the face of the father's God knew that was going to be in it but what'd he say he said your message will forerun the second coming all that I've taught you of one God water baptism predestination all brother and it's taught of this thing in the Statue of a perfect man was the faith of the father and he preached 30 something years for those two them things to be restored then God took him out on the back God took him up Aaron spoken words original seed I wish you'd listen to that message especially read it and just read it and look how beautiful and what he's laying out how that Mary had the two wounds how that this happened and that happened and how the bride and how she had to come to that place and in a little bit he says but Lord said I've got him out on the lil that's his words he said what can I do in other words he told it uh listen he taught it back up to where the faith of the fathers were standing there now you ain't gonna like this that's all right I've told you and I believe it if everybody in the world 7 billion people if ever person had the new birth exactly the way the Apostles taught it and the truth of it they would still be no change in the body because they was not one back down you can differ with that all you won't do but you better consider it well I got to face the fathers I'm ready for the rapture I've said this 40 years ago and I keep saying it we've got to come to the faith of the fathers to be able to even understand what the seals are and especially like Daniel seventy weeks were brother Browns when it said it he said if you don't understand this he said then you can't understand the seals the vials of Wrath he said you can't understand it but nobody wants to know about 270 weeks of Daniel which hurt may I run through it 562 in stat in in spoken words original seat letter run saw that he had preached it right up to where the disciples were or did they preach one God he preached one go where they preached predestination he saw it was all laid in order but he saw there was no change in the body so he said lord I got him out on the limb what did he mean he had him out on the limb if there wasn't something to come forth it was all over with and this man was standing with the faith of the fathers the dead raised the sick healed he said where they preached one God I preached one God he was standing with the faith of the fathers but yet he knew he couldn't progress in the word why cause he thought he'd already finished it and when he did he said they got him out on the limb did what can I do the Lord said pick up your pen ain't gonna read all of what said I'm just gonna read just a little bit or if you want to follow me if they can get over to number five I hadn't asked them to if they can get the number five spot words reading they'll see paragraph 432 God has promised be careful God has promised now right above this is where he's first he tells him two times our brother and says that two times in the spoken word original see that God told him pick up his pen and write one of them is just back up above this cuz now you don't tell me what to do God has promised be careful God has promised Malachi for for this last days and Malachi for has not yet the medaka for has not yet has been fulfilled but it will be fulfilled it's a German ties Word of God spoken through Malachi the Prophet Jesus referred to it before the coming of the Cross the second coming said it must be fulfilled at that time belicoff for he says not fulfilled he thought he'd preached Malachi for going down to number six this is from the spoken word reading OC the messenger Malachi 4 will appear at God's appointed time we are looking for him we believe he will come that is according to his word now you know yourself he knew who he was but no prophet ever declared who he was right don't get confused on that he knew what he was doing but he didn't know that key it says as of yet Malachi fours not fulfilled God spoke straight to him and that's what I've asked you to do it if you won't do it then don't throw it back in my face read the spoken word original see and look what he's bringing it down and then God said pick up your pen and he picks up his pen and he goes right back over here and I can put you on the page and let you start reading again right down through there are the same thing he'd already told and God brought him right back to that spot and he stopped the second time that of yet there's no way there's no way your rapture could come what's he talking about he was talking about his message see then we'll get it one of these days they don't know how old River was a whole lot more than just his turn the faith of the fathers on the Ohio River was a voice speaking that says as John the Baptist for under SEC first coming your message and then say the Apostles message your message will forerun now we better remember one thing especially on internet he's in no way in the world am i teaching they brought a runs message if something extra added to the Bible because it can't be it's got to be in the book so get that right now don't go tell somebody that I'm saying that there's something different to come no it's something out of the message it's something that was not explained but will be explained okay listen go under number seven just about six months after that I had my first baptism down here on the river when the light came down right at Spring Street many of you people might want to go down and take a look at it I like this one because I've never seen I never heard him say that his point are you risen look have you ever heard him say go down there and see it I mean come on have you ever heard him say I wish you'd go down there and see on Ohio River look what he says many of you people might want to go down and take a look at it he's getting personal in there there's where the angel of the Lord appeared in public first at two o'clock one afternoon and a voice came from it said as john the baptist was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming this is 30 years later and Here I am still tonight proclaiming that message and around the world if went and I'm glad to be back in my hometown tonight to represent this Lord Jesus Christ when was that seed not our to show up 1965 let me give you these and then we'll quit he says when the message first started out of course everybody was praying for the sick great signs and wonders it started specially in the Pentecostal people a universal revival and healing campaigns that swept the world and revivals will never hand look on the seed not out with a shot they still reading right on down paragraph 29 where we at but when he sat down one day now remember that's where he was describing what happened I and my father one that was more than they could stand it was also when he said except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you they couldn't understand that there was no way they could follow that time with a message that always follows ever sign because the voice was the sign has a voice alright the force of the sign 1964 we're told that in the last days that will appear again there's going to be a message come forth that will introduce the Messiah to the people and it'll be in such a way they stand dumbfounded like they did then he promised it in the next chapter alright listen to these now let's get it faced off the message trying to do is guard a service I've always told you I've always told it believe it the brother Browns message never begun with the disciples that was the disciples ministry being restored that was the restoring of the whole thing his message began in the opening of the sealed right at that little balance period maybe coming up close because especially if he gets spoken word original see then he gets in is this the sign of the end time serve and he goes backwards and forth on sign of the end times read it he'll go backwards and forth look like saying it's here then he'll look like he's saying it's coming he look like he's saying this here he looked like he said cause idiot see sometimes he's saying some things he ain't and he's done preaching it now look so what we get to them 7mr be revealed in the last days when the seven angels seventh angels message when he not when he starts out doing this but when he begins to sound his message see not two years in preparation but when he begins to sound the message these mysteries then will be revealed and here they are now not knowing them and you people are a witness okay that's all for what that's off the message trying to do God a service without his will alright here we go to work since birth Express now that was sixty four five here 65 works is faith Express that brings us to Pais today because we have faith and I know this is of God is because this and other scriptures point to this our revelation 10 said that in the hour of the seventh angel message when he begins to sound forth his message not in a healing service but the message that follows the healing service he's placing it so much until you can't argue the point look at the next one I have heard but now I see 1965 11 27 and when he promised at the hour of the seven angels message the seven seals would be revealed and the misters of God would be declared revelations 10 when the seventh angel begins to sound his message not the healing service the message that follows the healing service now you know he had a healing server you know all that but then there was a message because there's a voice to go with that all right go to the next one on the rapture I love this one now here also taught that the seven churches which is revelation 10 7 that the great mystery of the book was to be unfolded by the seventh angels message now there's a messenger above always and above and always a messenger on earth even get them to straight and find out what it is God was bringing his word down to the Prophet the English word angel means a messenger and the seventh angels message and in excuse me the seventh angels message while he was making his proclaiming his ministry then when he began to stand and stand forth his minute sound forth his ministry not when he started out Jesus when he started out he started healing the sick and afflicted oh that great rabbi he's a prophet everybody wanted him in his church but when he sat down one day and said I and my father are one that was different that was different and except you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink his blood you have no life in you rolling it on huh yeah maybe I can do it from here basically always father seven things was amazing Jesus when he started out okay that's it he started healing this sick a great prophet but when he sat down one day and said on my father one now the scripture says I mean the Prophet went on into another message he said when you begin to say I and my father's one he said the church will pull away from you now I'd be glad to find that one for you but here's one more off the message is this sign of this fist the sign of the in sir right out of a pricey day where there hadn't been been rained for weeks here he come with a rower and said as John the Baptist was sent forth to forerun the first coming of Christ you're sent forth with a message to forerun the second coming of Christ he was sent with a message his message is not and I got another one off on the rapture that's why I pulled that one but that should be enough for you to know where I'm standing anyway to understand why I believe it because it's not in the years of preparation and to think I'm a musician not in the years of all of that all of that was faith of the father's being restored but one day that prophet spoke the word original seed he said I love you yet Malachi fourth he set out right then to find out what about Malachi four it wouldn't be just a little while he was sent west and he come back to bring his message because listen the seals was not restoration seals was not restoration show me Steel's was something that mankind had never seen you remember you don't go with the Prophet we worked up top off the pyramid you know look down in he said light never shined on this brother branham stood dar with a message his message would full run their second coming of Jesus Christ I'm gonna save this statement to you so you get this one now see that's why I've always believed those seven seals is the message that the Prophet was to bring those it was something that was not known before before all right let's see now it's known because it's the opening of the word there ain't nothing to be opened by the side besides the seven seals would you admit that I mean would you admit that just in your mind and take it home we there ain't nothing beside the seven seals to be revealed because you say well now wait a minute days this third pool is a it's all in the seven seals marriage and divorce was revealed in seven sealed surface he's revealed in the southern sea everything was really nothing revealed it ain't revealed in the seven seals now come on get the message right but then you'll see that was his message his message was to bring those seven seals that is the head stone to me why would I want another head stone beside the revealing of the positive word therefore leaving the principles I didn't finish that message the other day right therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to perfection let's go on to completion right I thought brother Brennan said the Seventh Seal was the finish of all things I thought he said the seventh seal was the completion of all times why are we looking for something else I don't mind saying it I don't want no problem could you see I faced it's all the way back you say well now what do you think about the tenth brother Dale I don't know blind language you don't either because you're talking about something that a prophet said but I'm not sitting down waiting now anybody's known me for all of these 40 years some of you know me 50 years and you know one thing for sure learning them sitting back there they were there today I was baptized you know I stopped I ain't backed up one step I still believe today when I believe in brother Branham can come back and go across the country and preach but it'll be after the resurrection because there's no way to bring him up before the resurrection because you're making him deity if you try to bring him up to where there's nothing on now don't make him deity take it to any if he can raise and preach across the land for 30 40 day you mean we're gonna sit around in that 30 40 days after the resurrection Oh glory hallelujah direction the resurrections come wait good 3040 days we're gonna have such a wonderful opportunity the weekend traveling I thought we can go to Jeffersonville any time we want to or we can go to California anytime we want we can go anywhere we want to cause we can travel like I thought that's all I've ever told all I've ever contended the world is real this message is the only message with life it's not a message must and unless there's a voice to speak with that message and declare the message to be true there is no hoax outside of this message that's all I've ever said it's all I've ever contended let's get in the message I've always said it and that's what I said I ain't backing up this is what I say if you're saying well brother Browning's got to come back realize there's got to be me and you to get to a place to be wet ready to receive it now I can quote brother branham if you want to get into it you want to go with me and spoken word original seed how that the Prophet was taken back here and this happened to that away you better remember that but just remember if it don't come according to the word we've missed it he said well you just don't say no that's the one thing don't talk to me about it because I'm beyond all talking to that pray for me he said brother de la but one thing that I believe has got to be done and that's the new name of Jesus today I suppose be revealed in the thunders let's quote brother Brandon he said it might be made known when we get to that's no the Lancer that's just stating him he said it might be made known when I get there what do you need a new name for so you're making it to be some kind of something that there's got to be some mysterious something that you don't understand let's get in the message and take what the prophet has told us and we'll be ready for whatever takes place most of you know what happened a couple of years in a row or not years but time everybody was over in the fellowship meetings and they were saying oh we got to have a woman president he's got to be this prophet said and what we're president you know I got up over one time and I told him I said all y'all talking about distant woman got to be a president but I said you want me tell you who's gonna be President they just all shut up I said you won't dust at the Lord or they did Drive that's cause I'm gonna tell what the Bible say he said I put in Kings and I take out Kings so whoever God wants in the White House is gonna be in the White House he's got to wonder now for the way it's supposed to be he had Obama to bring it to the basis he got this one now why do we want to argue about what's going on I don't care who's president it'll be who God wants to be is that any problem I mean I think he's playing common sense God's gonna put in the office right go ahead and anybody have a need in with him now be careful on the way home but if anybody have indeed come brother ray its sister Kathy wants us to pray for him about traveling mercy so let's do that go ahead brother we just gonna give you two or three okay [Music] come on brother white ball father we
