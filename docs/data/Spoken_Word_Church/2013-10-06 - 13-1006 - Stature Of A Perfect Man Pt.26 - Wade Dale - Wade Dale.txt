TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well the door's open i hope you saw what we saw and for all of you all the information today is my regina just said this morning how that you know if our son's been married 34 here well mama yo mama man all right we're a little slim on crowd today but that's okay i heard a story uh the other day that it's kind of fitting with that you know we've been 34 years and this man said him and his wife been married about 30 years and he bought her he said he was you know tired of her mood swings so he bought her a mood ring so he could know what move she was in and he said no this is what he said he said now it works wonderful he said there's only one problem he said now when it turns blue everything's fine he said but when she's in a bad mood he said it turns red about right here words of wisdom best 34 years of my life put it that way absolutely and i asked the same question for getting different i said there's no other woman there's no other woman that would have me so thank god she's whatever she is ignorant of it or whatever so she's the only one who can put up with him anyway all right now we're talking about knowledge now last sunday we ended up with a word that i want to give you a definition of and i don't i don't why is it not over there yeah everything's gone but what i want not yet supposed to be on up there but it's probably coming look there you go no secrets there's no signals for those of you that are for those of you that were not here last sunday we were talking about the word knowledge now the word knowledge means what somebody had somebody else look it up i'll give you another week to look it up knowledge i have information okay um acceptance of the truth or existence of something the greatest possible amount of knowledge of god proceeds from observations or experiences a desire for extensive or specialized about a subject okay how about the word intelligence about the word intelligence intelligence or revelation and information but the key word i want to look in knowledge in the statue of a perfect man has nothing to do with human ability to add subtract multiply know the 50 states even though you're on social security no to me it means discernment now look at this word discernment maybe some of you can say i can't make this any bigger but um look at the word discernment the quality of being able to grasp and comprehend what is obscure so the knowledge of god is obscure to man okay the knowledge of god is totally obscure to man because the knowledge of god is i can make a world the knowledge of man is i don't see how right and i don't see how you make a world well god just says i can make one okay so the knowledge is an obscure it's an obscurity all right it's the ability to see and understand people things or situations clearly and intelligently all right now that's man's definition but i like that one right there the quality of being able to grasp and comprehend what is obscure yeah all right the word of god is totally obscure even the word of god that we see see the word of god in the statue of a perfect man is not denominational knowledge okay it's not denominational knowledge because their knowledge is is more obscure than ever because it's not by the bible because so you have to take what does discernment do it the act of perceiving or discerning something all right well that's the same thing is knowledge you got to have knowledge or intelligence right now if you're born again you do have the intelligence of god if you're born again if you're born again you have the intelligence of god everybody got them you have the intelligence of god if you're born again now if you receive all that you need at the new birth that's what brother brown said but faith alone won't do it that means you've got a storehouse in your soul if you're born again you have a storehouse of all these virtues you can go get them when you want them somebody else can't come and get yours now they can feed off of yours but they can't come and get your knowledge they can't come and get your virtue all right and it's got to come from within now in hosea 6 and 6 we're just going to read a few scriptures he said i desired mercy and not sacrificed and the knowledge of god more than burnt offering so he desire now jose knew that burnt offerings was the way to get to god right because that's the way that he that was ordained for people to get to god was to make a sacrifice but he said i desire the knowledge of god more than that why because burnt offerings is only going to do one thing for you it's going to make you be aware that there's sin right but it's not going to take away your sin burnt offerings you know sacrificing offerings i would it's not but a body though has prepared me all right so the body of god is where all these things were are still are but now look right here in first corinthians 15 34 it says awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of god some have not the knowledge of god all right i speak this to your shame await the righteousness and say no it's talking to christian people right but some have not the knowledge of god now remember to be born again means you have all these virtues like i said in a storehouse all right you're the one who can draw from it or you can keep the door shut one of the two all right so that's your all these are that's why i don't i don't understand these people that says you know that we don't have a choice and then you know the world this this whole christian experience is is due to choice and is affected by choice you remember that one more time it's due to our choosing we became a christian and then our choice continues on if we want to continue on with god so we don't stop choosing now you you know brother brown said he said you know you weren't born on any certain day and you you weren't you know you always were eternal that's correct but there had to come a point in time where you made yourself available for the word to be for those virtues to be birthed in you all right now we know the new birth is the birth of the word it's the birth of almighty god in your soul burning out the old nature and putting him in right right he wasn't there to begin with you were black brother brown said your soul was black darkness all right so there was no light there but there was a representation see that's why god give you a statue of a perfect man somebody's gonna attain to that or you want to give it all right just like which one did he create first the water or the fin on the fish's back are the scales on the fish's back or the water first he created the water all right he created the thirst and and i got a quote um it's a little bit off what we're talking about but it's really not because let's go back to discernment and knowledge brother brown said every creation of every man was a creation of god and there was a part of god in that person in the in the part that we need something to worship remember he put that in everybody he put that ability to worship man every man even adolf hitler is given the ability to worship god right so that puts everybody on a level playing field all right but what he done was brother i said then you have a choice whether to turn that desire everybody's got a desire to serve god even the hot tots in africa even people never heard of jesus christ they've all got a desire because of the creator to worship god so there's that deep calling to the deep what you've done was god knew you would respond to the word and that adolf hitler would not respond to the word he responded to greed power and all the things that that's perverted because satan was given a permitted power he was a right-hand man he was god's first creation really i mean as far as creating angels he was the first one right beside of him brother brown said but what did he do he took that desire to worship god and he worshipped himself self-worship and that's the problem with people nowadays you look out in the world now self-worship why it's layout sea of people's rights i have a right to do this i have a right to do that that's my rights it's me i have a privilege and a right to do that so but anyway we've got to have this knowledge which is not just how much you can quote how much you can read the bible and say well i've read every page and i can cite you know uh brother stephen abraham from uh where is he from ap or wherever he was from where was stephen from trinidad he could stand up you he could stand up there and he could you pick out a psalm and he could just right out of his mouth well see without holy ghost knowledge that's just man's knowledge that's just being able to uh saw somebody on the internet last night this guy you can talk to him for like 30 minutes to 45 minutes and he retains everything you say and he can say exactly what you said he's that in tune with what his natural intelligence his brain because remember most of us only use our 10 capacity of our brain some only has 10 capacity of the brain but you know what i think i think god gave us a brain brother brother branham had a brain but he had a conscious that was a little bit closer to his subconscious why he was given a gift he was made that way right but i believe we were made in the image of god so i believe we were given a brain that they want with to have the knowledge of god but it's got to come from discernment because you're an individual it doesn't go by individual knowledge everybody understand when i say knowledge when i say knowledge don't get in your mind that will well this this person can can can speak better than i can or this person went to 40 14 years in college brother brown said the most illiterate person can receive the new birth peter one of the most illiterate people in the bible had these virtues working in his life actually that probably kept him from being hindered so much you know what he does he's believed god right he believed god he said god you said it i've been with you i was with you the whole time i think peter's peter's whole um well i want to say peter's greatest ability when jesus was here peter paid attention i believe peter paid attention because you gotta remember in the scripture he's always saying lord you yo lord you did this you who's touching me and peter said lord everybody's touching you peter was aware of something that was going on but he just couldn't get it get his brain wrapped around it you know because he didn't have the holy ghost but when you have the holy ghost and you bring it into a brain of course it's not in your brain but you understand what i mean it works through all that all right your outlets in your brain then you must have not just regular knowledge but discernment discernment to me is the bottom line because you know what you're going to need it when you get to temperance without discernment you're gonna get mad at things that you shouldn't get mad at come on without discernment you know why because i do without a little discernment i didn't have it before without some discernment it's hard but that discernment is knowledge and there's one thing for sure though i don't know if i got on this one but i got it somewhere god is not going to just give you knowledge as far as saying okay you've got the holy ghost so you don't need this because the holy ghost is god right right the holy ghost is the holy spirit the one that created all things the one on the chart that we did a couple weeks ago that's what came to you at the new birth the christ the logos of theophany of god the word form of god the creator the seed of god all that came into new birth but now he didn't say all right you got it all you can do yes all you you got it all but you gotta go settle you go sit over here and i'll just pour it in you because god can't go past his word his word says that you have to come to church you have to read your bible you have to communicate with god yourself all right see that's the problem with the catholic church they want to communicate with one man the priest and then let the priest take everything to god right well that's not what the bible says now he gives you a five-fold ministry to perfect the saints so the only way you're gonna get it is you're gonna get it by apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists you're not going to get it from one person that's why you're not going to get it from brother branham off the tapes by yourself even though the holy ghost is in there with all that kind of strange it's kind of hard but you're not going to get it by saying the homelessness because see that's not what the word of god said all right where god said you're only going to be perfected by a five-fold ministry all right and doing the things of god all right and it's okay to have earthly knowledge it's all right it's okay to uh one key to a lot of you of course a lot of you are older and don't have little kids but there's knowledge there reading reading you perceive more you need to read and you know that's what i did i read a lot i read a lot of my study books and i didn't have to do so much as far as homework at all actually none and but i listened in class i paid attention i did gyms a lot of time because she was thinking about me while she was in the classroom and she wasn't there in bonnie only where was that that was 35 years ago on 34 that was 35 years ago joyce and danny's got one there is jacob that's right jacob's just today yeah he texted me last night and i texted him back told him i said he said don't forget i said you better not forget so yours is number one mine is number 34 it's a little different you know in missing one and number 34 so happy anniversary to jacob but listen you gotta have you got what you say discernment as long as they know that yeah as long as i know but when we discern things what do you do when you discern things that means you take what's saith right because right here says the ability to see and understand people things or situations clearly and intelligently there's no way you can discern the things of god without knowing the things of god the basic like trudy said you get it in a baby form well the baby makes mistakes the baby falls down the baby babbles the baby cries the baby because they don't have any other way of communicating but now if you'll have stayed that way ten years from now there's a problem somewhere there's a deficiency in that child and you see a lot of christians that way but you know why because they don't have a good set of parents i'm talking spiritually now not nothing not grinding them i think they're wondering but spiritually they don't get the right parents and they stay babies brother brown calls it mental deficiency and that's what it is it's a mental deficiency but it's not a mental deficiency as far as humanly it's a mental deficiency because of the word of god because you know you can only you can only get if your pastor's right here that's as far as you're going you're not going unless you hear somewhere else and you'll go to that because if this pastor is preaching here and this one's down here and you're ordained to listen and get it and know what god's doing then you know what you're going to do automatically the the god in you not you most of the time the god in you is going to move you over here because he knows how far you're going to go we don't that's why it's a mystery but it's you and i still having a choice now what if i knew this was over here but stayed over here what if i knew this was here and i stayed here does that mean well that means one thing for sure i may not even have faith yeah in your birth you got it i mean that's pretty simple to me if you hear a word that's this that calls your name not your name physically but your name in it you can't you contact that you connect yourself to that to that and yet you stay over here and just keep drinking milk and drinking milk and drinking milk drinking milk there's something wrong somewhere forgive me class but can you back up you were you were saying about reading and then you were saying you listened in class and i need to get back there because i got to move on you're saying you get more from reading and then from harry just puts the icing on the cake is that where that's correct yes i would re i can comprehend what i read but you still got to listen to somebody somebody a teacher's got to put it together you can't take and read you can physically read acts 238 and you can physically read matthew 28 19. without discernment the right kind of discernment you're going to say those two are contrary so i'm going to take the one jesus said now that's what they do out in the in the denominational world right well i'll tell you what jesus said over what peter said well with discernment in the knowledge of god they're saying the same thing right yes but now you can't get that from just reading now some might but remember faith comes by hearing faith comes by hearing in acts 2 when the holy ghost fell it wasn't the speaking it was they heard in their own language okay so that's what you're doing today you're discerning remember when you have preachers come up and they freak something a little bit off and you're you're discerning the whole time your computer's turning and what are you dealing with discernment of the knowledge that you already have yes okay you're you're using the discernment of the knowledge you already have because we're we have been taught well here right yeah yes other people have not been taught well so they'll they'll hear a sermon of of two souls or or we're gonna get a new body or whatever and they'll just shout and why they're not you they don't have anything to discern with you gotta have a basis what i'm saying is you got to have faith you got to draw strength from virtue from the word of god then you have to have knowledge that that word of god is right but you got to have knowledge you've got to go get it somewhere that god's not going to just open your head and start pouring it down in you okay so you can read it but you got to hear it how can they hear without a preacher so you can't now not that you got not physically hearing you understand what i mean when brother when brother brown and brother dale or any preacher says do you see what i'm saying it's not do you see what i'm saying it's do you see or understand or do you discern what i'm saying okay do you know what i'm talking about right and then that's why we bring quotes and scriptures because you bring quotes and scriptures and you put the thing together that's what brother brown done many people in this message take brother brown's message and say this is right and this is wrong okay if he made a mistake he is the one that corrected okay because you can't correct the prophet he's corrected by god alone all right so we can't say let's think about it this morning all these people that say well that was before 63. well if them people want to just take 63 to 65 then don't ever quote anything past that throw those books away throw those tapes away because what you're saying is he didn't know anything until 1963. now that's not right he was born a prophet and sure there was things in his ministry that he had progressive revelation he had to go up that pyramid just like you and i did yeah brother brown started one time with faith he went to that whatever that was wood shed and all that and he got the holy ghost well now when he got the holy ghost he always already was an ordained prophet so the holy ghost come and enhance that okay so the prophet can be a false prophet not have the holy ghost but if you have a prophet with the holy ghost you put them two together you can't make a mistake you understand what i'm saying he makes human mistakes like seven hundred seven thousand that has nothing to do with what the word of god is okay that's a slip of the tongue you know daddy will say adam and mean moses you know what your knowledge discerns that that's right the only reason i ever try to correct him is is because people on that internet because they sit there and pick every word and if you miss one word they'll go because i've heard them do it you know so you have to be real precise not for us but for the ones that are listening or watching on the internet so we want to try to keep everything in line and keep everything straight but with holy ghost discernment or knowledge the bible said it'll lead you and guide you into what all truth and i didn't say right all true that's why knowledge you would think you would i would think if i was going to build this pyramid see because here i am that's god's knowledge i'm not god so i would put knowledge on it for a little bit i put temperance down there where i could control my temper first but he gives us knowledge and discernment the third thing he gives us knowledge and discernment to do what because when we get to temperance we know how to handle it because the knowledge of god will tell you how to handle a situation so it's exactly perfectly where it should be because if you don't have knowledge of it doesn't matter if you get mad or blow up or say something you shouldn't say but if you have a knowledge of it every one of these things to me is a is a check off it's like it's like boy said i i won't i would love for all of y'all to to find out where you are in this pyramid and point to it like boyd did he said i need temper okay does that mean he's got faith virtue knowledge not all of it but maybe some of it he at least realizes right there's where i need to work on okay see i need to work on being more like god that's what i need to do work on being more like god because godliness brother random didn't spend a lot of time on it he said that's to be like god well you can't you can't what am i going to say here you can't build on that anymore because here's how to be like god so you got to get to this then you you can't be a walking zombie you can't say well i'm going to be like god so i'm going to me and jim's not you're going to divorce after 34 years and i'm going to go over into a monastery and i'm going to do nothing but just in the morning in the afternoon and evening i'm just going to pray that's not what god wants that would drive you crazy me especially you know so it's not that way it's not that we're going to be um god robots i heard one time a man say he was uh he was william brown's parakeet well i i don't want to do that because the parakeet only states to me that's belittling yourself for the parakeet only states what he hears he has no revelation of what he's saying right he has no revelation apparently he has no revelation of what he says i want to be my own individual person have the knowledge and the discernment to know that brother branham was the problem what he said was right from 47 to 65 that you can blend all that together and it all works into a beautiful picture well once you do that then it's kind of like i was telling you all the other day about some people have the cow the grass they got all the components of a picture but if you take that cow and put it in the top of the tree and grass what does it do to that picture doesn't matter how beautiful the picture is doesn't matter if it's in high definition quality it's worthless it's not true the cow can't eat grass on top of a tree it's not true so it makes the whole thing called pretty wild huh we better go i'm losing time here i wonder if that cloth the ding dong hadn't went off yet okay all right let's go up front we'll we'll work on discernment next next sunday i i won't be here next sunday i'm going to dutch scots he called me and i'm going to preach for him next sunday so bob will be here next time and we'll continue after that y'all be careful i'm going up front there won't be no seats everybody's just churchill you said todd dale was here
