standing on they just think that well some people think that well this just happened and we're here then some people do believe in a divine creator and that's why we're here but what purpose are we here for they don't have a clue what we do we know where we come from we know what we're doing here we know where we're going so god bless each and every one of you thank you again for for coming out by way of announcement let me go and get this out of the way some of you weren't here this morning no church this Wednesday that will be Christmas Day next Sunday dad will be preaching both services I'll be with brother Chris long and brother Mike Altice in South Carolina also there will be no wins the service the next week January the 1st because we will be having our probably number 40 something annual watch night service which will start at 8 o'clock and conclude at midnight brother Chris will be preaching for us and then we'll sing till midnight take communion your sister's bring maybe some sweets finger food and we always have a good time we usually get her about 6 o'clock or 6:30 somewhere before before we have a service and eat and fellowship a little bit but this is a new year coming up this is actually a new decade this is not interesting new years a new decade we never thought we'd be here at 2020 but we are and we're here for a purpose amen so remember that also January the fourth which will be that next weekend our youth the Bible study will begin at 3 o'clock we'll be having pizza and brother Nathanael Greene will be speaking for us for about 30 minutes then we're gonna have our youth Bible study or questions and answers whichever one you want to say regular Bible study will begin at 6 from 6 to 8 that'll be our normal Bible study first Saturday of every month alright and then brother Nathanael will be staying over for that Sunday and he'll be preaching the second service for us which that is also youth Sunday so the youth will be conducting the services all right also on January the 18th brother Aaron McGarry from Hickory North Carolina will be with us at the fellowship meeting fellowship meeting starts at 3:30 so we ask all of you to attend you'll be getting their instructions of what to do and all that for food so and brother Aaron will be staying over for that weekend with us who never had him here before but I've heard him a couple of times in Wichita Kansas has a real good understanding of the message it's real good brother so god bless you let's turn to the Book of Psalms and we'll continue our thought won't be very long today we're just going to kind of go through and then bring a few things that we did in this morning hope you enjoyed that this morning we we must understand we're gonna have a revival we better we better understand how to have one amen because the world does not know anything about this revival this revival will be to them it'll be silent but I thought the Bible says their silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour you know why because the world don't know what's going on but you and I know what's going on hey ma'am Psalms 85 verse 1 let's go to the Lord in prayer the only father thank you Lord for the day for all these wonderful singers Lord that you've sent our way father we pray that you'd bless them I know some are going back to another country but Lord it won't be long before we'll be able to convert together we won't need an interpreter when we get in our glorified condition we'll all hear as worse as we're known we won't need that we'll all be able to fellowship and Lord touch each one that's traveling bless the ones that are not here bless the ones that are sick all the requests that you've heard we would Joby's family Lord in the passing of him yesterday Lord he's been a long time in the community a good friend we pray this you just bless each one now take care of us lead us and guide us by your Holy Spirit you have preeminence in this service in Jesus name we pray amen like I said again god bless you brother Isaac and your wife thank you for coming if we keep you we would but you got to go back before you there you go you have to wait a man lease has to tell him what I said so I still can't get this wrap this around my brain I go to the Philippines and we sing songs for two hours in English and I have to have an interpreter when I preach I told him I said if I just sing my sermon do you need an interpreter that'd be horrible Healing the songs eighty-five I don't need any amens to that okay that was just a thought okay that was just a thought all right let's get started but no listen we are weird we're the only people like I said that know where we are coming where we came from what we're doing here where we're going all right and then we see that many things are happening in the message but there is going to be a promised revival but it will be an individual revival it will not be worldwide it may not even be community-wide but it's going to be in your world your own world you're gonna have to have a revival like no one else has had before because you got to have a revival that's gonna take you into a body change all the rest of them was not required that all right Psalm 30:5 one - the chief musician the Psalms for the son of Korah Lord now it's been favorable into thy land now it's brought back the captivity of Jacob now it's forgiven the iniquity of thy people thou has covered there since Eli now has taken away all thy wrath thou has turned thyself from the fierceness of that anger turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us to cease now remember this is David in the Jewish community they they didn't fall away from being Jews they fell away from what the commandments of God all right they'd fill it they've fallen away from the commands of God because the revival is not to change them into a different person they were always Israel but God is trying to what do away with their sin get them to realize that he's done away with their sin and then watch what he says turn us O God of our salvation and caused on anger toward us decease wilt thou be angry with us forever we'll talk draw out that anger to all generations wilt thou not revive us again that thy people may rejoice in thee because without a revival there are no rejoicing what are you gonna rejoice over yes I'm a Christian well that's not going to get you in a body take a body change that's gonna get you in heaven no problem but that's not our requirement our requirement is is to go on further amen show us thy mercy O Lord and grant us thy salvation all right let's read 2nd chronicles 7 verse 14 through 16 if my people if my people who are called by my name were the only people that know the right name and how to call on him and know who he is and know where he is I want us to hone in on this I want us to know that this is talking about me and you sitting in this building today if my people which are called by my name shall humble themselves and pray and seek my face see what causes a revival humble thyself pray seek my face turn from their wicked ways then will I hear from heaven and will forgive their sin that will heal their land now mine eyes shall be opened in my ears the tenants of the prayer that is made in this place for now have I chosen and sanctified this house like I said before this house not this building this house that my name may be there forever and my eyes and my heart shall be there perpetually you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now this morning what we're talking about just for a minute of background we were talking about pull the screen up on the Hebrew lexicon mm-hmm a revival is not talking about resurrection a revival is talking about what you already have that God will quicken what you already have because he cannot quicken non seed or non word there's nothing to quicken that's a direct quote from brother Branham in the church age book but look this is to live have life remain alive it does not saying get life you already have life but you're doing something to that life that you already have as I said this morning I hope and pray you realize maybe you don't have life and you can get life amen but that would be a resurrection not a revival a resurrection is you got to die and Christ come and live in you and resurrect you in heavenly places so that you can walk in the light of the Lord but then as we walk on even Jesus Christ we were talking this morning mmm downstairs even Jesus Christ had to grow in grace and knowledge you and I have to grow sure that baby Jesus was wonderful and in that manger in that feed trough but he did us no good staying in the feed trough he had to grow in grace and knowledge his body had to grow up he had to grow to where he knew who he was I don't think it five years old he knew who he was he didn't have to it wasn't his time you remember the Bible and all through the Bible it says his time had not come yet his time had not come yet he had a time you and I have a time there's a time for everything not not for all things but to all things remember sustain life live prosperously live forever be quickened be alive be restored to life and health to continue in life and remain alive so reviving as the song says revive us again fill each heart with I love now that mean that you need a new birth it means that you need a refilling a man there's many refilling 's we this is all refilling x' we need many refilling I Bob and I were talking a few minutes ago you know you're talking about the mechanics and dynamics everybody's thinking we need them we need to dynamics where's they're not dynamics we need to dynamics you know you can have mechanics and dynamics you can have mechanics and dynamics but where's an area let me have your car keys I'm gonna give it to your daughter your car keys weird you know oh it's Louise's car okay it's Louise yeah look yeah where's your daughter where's your daughter at well that was a horrible example get it okay let's rewind cut that tape off let's start all over again you see what I'm saying there's a car sitting in the driveway out there full of gas which is what but all right the dynamics is to spark but give the keys to a baby disaster disaster that's what God's waiting on he's waiting on us to be mature enough to be able to work with the power that he's giving us everybody got that same am a man so everybody can be shouting mechanics dynamics mechanics dynamics but we got to put a mat or person behind the wheel hey man that's why God's not gonna get listen if brother Brown said you've got enough power inside of you if you've got the new birth to create a world and go live on it Amen cause I see that's the same eternal life that said let there be brotherly the same eternal life you got today is the same eternal life that stood in nothing and said let there be this and let there be that and let there be listener to be left but you are what your withholding from that because you might make a mistake as a human I didn't make a mistake but you might make a mistake with that power that you got inside of you that's my brother Brian said there's a bar what's the bar the bar is maturity but now will we come to full maturity Jesus walked out of the tomb and he said all power and heaven earth been given unto me why he had to go to a process he had to grow up just like we did he was Almighty God but he had to grow in that human body so what is this revival this revival I believe is going to tell us it's an individual revival so what it's going to do is it's going to help us all grow up car sitting there the message of the hour is the car hello the message of the hour is the car got plenty of power got plenty of gas and can't spark if you got the right person to stick the key in and turn the key you don't want to do that you know what disaster would be because you know what you can let a kid they think stick keys in the ignition and they can turn it but Lord don't let him drive neither I'm putting on my car one day at my house and I said we're going to nanny's I said okay just ease it out ease it out ease it out of my driveway go toward nanny's house go this way she goes okay reverse we go that way almost to the railroad tracks I said stop she hits the accelerator Nayla I'm sorry but that's what happened in it you can't see her face get red so she's okay but you see what a disaster that wasn't our look she was an adult almost but she wasn't trained had the complete power to drive that car maybe in the right direction but she didn't have the training folks this 50 something years this has been training we've had the Holy Ghost we've had the Holy Ghost since 1906 Azusa Street we've had the Holy Ghost come and we've had it tell us and then a prophet comes and he takes and just opens the book for us and gives us this message but what have we done fifty years we've been going fifty years we've been sucking our thumb going lord help me pastor save my children yeah we can't be Catholic God wants us to be men and women adults even you young kids with the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the right teaching you can become adults in God what is this revival for brother Brown said revival comes from you we're gonna read it in a minute and it comes from when you're fed up with you now you can't find that in a quote but that's what brother Brown says well look when the children of Israel were fed up for where they were they were fed up oh yeah they've been there for a few years and they was okay until about year 350 something Moses you know then Moses comes on the scene then he had to wait another 40 years Moses had to go back to the desert amen so let's take this for a Bible and like I said before brother Brown said revival comes with prayer sometimes also with fasting and what happens is we catch the center which is okay they come under conviction and we catch the center and the center comes in and then there's sometimes a healing campaign going on but remember a revival though is revived what you already have so that God so that God can see that you can handle the word that you can drive the car though the mechanics be there and the dynamics and the ability to turn the key it takes me and you but what does it take it takes reading praying studying coming to church and doing the things you got to do Bible cleans first folks we got to do Bible stuff first if we do Bible stuff first brother Branham did not come to change the Bible he did not come to make the Bible less effective i believe he came to make it more effective he came to open what not just a book cuz what's a book about you your the book he was opening open the eyes of my heart Lord what to read to see he didn't write a new Bible but brother Brown said the Bible became a brand new book why he was reading with a mature set of eyes I like that with a mature set of eyes now let's go to Hosea 6 verse 1 let's read a little bit more from this morning we'll skip some of the quotes I want to get to to this part about revivals s61 come let us return it to the Lord for he has torn and he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us that listen God will do nothing to a child that doesn't help them he cannot do anything to hurt you you may hurt yourself he may make you realize that you are hurt but God listen God can't hurt you you understand what I mean Satan hurts you but God don't hurt his own children while you walked up he says what a father would give there the kid would cry for a piece of bread and you give him a stone cry for a fish and you give him a scorpion that's not God that's the devil come and let us return them to the Lord for his torn and he will heal us listen I love his omnipotence because he knows what we need but there's one thing for sure we have a free moral agency somebody asked the other day brother Russ called me he said brother wait I can't get this out of my head he said brother branham and your dad's been talking about God waiting on you and I remember he says that an adoption series God's waiting on you and I adoption time where he can fill us with his phone God's waiting on us you know why is waiting us waiting on us cuz you can't go over our free moral agency there's your answer to the question because you think oh listen see this would be us Jeannie this would be us we're God you're gonna do what I said anyway I'm gonna make you do it God can't do that he can't make you do something and be a just God he can't do that that's always waitin on you and I - what he can't override our free moral agency brother Brown man I love what he says about the Holy Ghost he's a timid person he's a gentleman he'll knock on your door but he'll not knock your door down do you know why because that would be making you do something right but see when we do it out of love for God that's much greater than him making us do something amen so he can't override our free moral agency so God is waiting on menu now he knows the day you're gonna come to adoption he knows the day we're gonna get out of here new he knows all that but he's not gonna tell you he's gonna wait and let you call on him that's what the children of Israel did finally one day 400 years or 300 something years after they were in bondage they said finally said God send us a deliverer send us somebody to get us out of this in other words you could go back in the scrolls and say God you promised you promised our Father Abram that we'd be down here for hundred years and it's coming up remember Jeremiah Jeremiah's the same way Jeremiah comes and prophesized God through Jeremiah says you going to be in captivity for 70 years but I'm gonna bring you out with a mighty hand and then here's Jeremiah coming up and we see that he wrote that prophecy and then here Daniel was in that prophecy sixty-eight years the Prophet said he had already been in bondage in Israel and he wanted to know what was gonna happen when he got out but we'll talk about that in a minute he will heal us he has smitten and he will bind us up after two days after what's the day - God 2,000 years after 2,000 years he will revive us he said the way he didn't know he's revived people all alone but the revival that you and I have gonna get going to come to this difference it's a word revival I'm talking a complete word revival Luther listen Luther had a word revival but it was just on one scripture they just shall live by faith all the other things he could smoke a pop drink a beer you can't do that why because we progressed on that further in the word amen but Luther could do that because he lived by one word one sentence the just shall live by faith then Wesley comes in and says okay we'll take that and we're gonna add two now you can't go to the pub and drink and smoke you got to sanctify yourself do the Methodist and then we see he came on up into the Pentecostal but after two days will he revive us in the third day he will raise us up now obviously that's our day we're in that day right there if you want to know this day this scripture is fulfilled right there it is and we shall live in his side everybody fine with that same n so now I'm gonna read this quote now we didn't have it up on the screen excuse me don't either the rising of the Sun I love this quote because you see what brother Branham says you got it on there yeah okay thank you there was the first sheaf come up from all the prophets which was the son of God the king of prophets there's been churches churches Brides Brides Brides churches Brides Brides but there has got to come one hallelujah one there has to come a real bride not that all those other Brides were false but those other Brides didn't have enough word to carry them to a change of the body we have that now there must come one that's not only got the mechanics but the dynamics of it makes that church live moving the power of his resurrection until we come to that until we find that place what good does it do to polish the hubs and like I said this morning most people don't know what simonize is but all of us older people I had them raise their hand this morning who all know what sign cuz it was actually was the name of a wax simonize and you'd have to wax your whole car and you'd have to wait till it gets all dusty and and and then you would rub it off and you'd look at it and you go oh man I miss the spa you can tell it but that's what he's talking about what have we done we've we've window dressed this message dress hair clothes do this don't do that we've window dressed it when we've missed the power behind it but now sure we've had healings a lot of you were born again during brother branham's time and then on further into this time so don't tell me God's not working God's working okay but he's wanting us to leave this place because we're not into two days we're in the third day what does it good to give her a facelift or a simonize job when there's no dynamics in it no matter how much the mechanics proved to be right there has got to be dynamics to make it work so now when we realize where we're at and realize that dynamics is here along with the mechanics it's like I said this morning some preacher was telling me said well these people they think they've got the third pull and they think they've got the revelation of the seven seals he said they just he said they're adulterers and they live like dogs and then they a lot of them do but I said there's a truth not everybody's gonna have the truth how many people had the truth in Jesus's day one person him and they called him a devil amen one person Jesus had it right now a few years later and on the day of Pentecost there's 120 had it right amen listen to this let's go to the next one go to this evil age it is now watch it is that both engaged brides look both engaged brides believe Satan's knowledge against God's Word the Bride of Adam believes Satan's knowledge against God's Word and the Bride of Christ listen folks don't do 2000 years it doesn't matter you can call them whatever you want to but that there were message believers for their time they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost even during that 15 5 years of dark ages when they did nothing but confessed I'm a Christian and they got their heads chopped off that was God they're going to be there we're going to be able to converse with them because they are believer they're on their message believers so we're not belittling anybody but look they're gone there's no way they can help us physically to get out of here only live people and I hope you understand that it's a live message it's a live ministry the Bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge could creep sure he did Luther you Jesus Christ never preached the father son Holy Ghost baptism jesus never stood and said there's an eternal hell he never stood and said I and my father of three did he but now the bride down through the ages did because of their own theology God winked at their ignorance because the book was closed and they couldn't see all the truth now you and I can't do that the Bride of Christ has believed Satan's knowledge in this in intellectual evil age against God's Word and notice even the natural that believed that and plunged the whole human race to death the natural bride Adam the natural man of the earth his bride before he got to her to be wife plunged a whole human race into death whether scientific or not but we're talking about this morning people trying to scientifically prove the clouds wrong and all this stuff don't pay attention to that it's worthless worthless it really does not even have a it's not a Salvation issue anyway I william branham open this Bible to me through him like brother Mike was talking about he was that pipe that God pushed the water through and you know where that water went to me you gotta say it went to you but he went to me so I don't care if the pipe was rusty I told deal in that peripheral stuff he didn't do is really any good like I said this morning they got a cloud they got fire they got water out of a rock they got man out of heaven every day three times a day and it had everything they needed they don't have to go to the grocery store with the list I gotta get greens today and I gotta get fish tomorrow and I gotta get no they got man and a God give them free food and they complained they loathed it remember they love it walk out and go I don't want this no more well they asked for something they got it but God God give them something beside quail but you know what you don't do that to God you don't take all that that God gives you an in you want more like that they were murmuring and complaining don't you ever complain to God you ask God there's an approach to God you ask him about things who are we to who are we to question our Creator know all things work too good to them that love the Lord maybe you're not in that group God don't have to take care of the devil's kids he takes care of his own kids whether you're in Holy Eden I'm not gonna charge you for that one whether its scientific or not we die just the same because God said we would whether you're in Holy Eden our Holy Church our holy denomination or whatever it might be you'll die the day you disbelieve one word of God's Word to be the truth when it's vindicated and proved to you that's the day you separate yourself from God not just the whole sentence one word whosoever shall add one word or take one away that's the day you die now let's skip on and see that no that's degree number two because I want to get to something right here when you see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean revival so I'm gonna set this up for those of you that weren't here this morning will tell you what a revival in the world the world is looking and I've got a I've got a little commentary down here at the end I may read it where this guy and he's a nominal guy they're looking for a revival a sweeping revival that God is gonna come in and just take care of all this that we got wrong ain't gonna take us away from here that's not what this is the brides revival is a silent revival the bride's revival is a revival of person person but listen you got to be right that's why he's not added denomination right now is because they're they have folks word when you see these crowds gathering that doesn't mean revival that's just the gathering but it revival is when people get really right with God and pray through and starts a revival throughout the city and everything they put away sin put away their iniquity turn to God turnaround start back again in other words down the road now let's read number three brother I feel real good about it anyway what's this church needs today is a good revival not in your doctrine not a new order just they're stirring up of what you already know about listen what we know right now can change the world but you better get to change first cuz it's not going to the world number four now Minister cannot bring a revival there's no preacher can bring a revival he doesn't pack it or carry it with him and the only thing you can do is just be loyal to God and His Word and the revival has to come by the people in your home in your life now revival isn't adding new members to the church its reviving that was what's already we've already got to revive means to bring back all right let's go to number five believe us now this 1951 what we needed is an old-fashioned god-sent revival clean up the home clean up the heart get things ready start a revival in your home and it'll begin at church oh boy preacher don't bring it into the briefcase I wish we could God sends it from heaven to the individual walk there buddy got that say man let's go to number six mothers of old they love to raise their kids but all this modern America day what we're living in now I tell you our nation is simply polluted there's not a hope left of this nation as I see you know wheat like I said before we we hunt with some nominal Christian guys I guess you may call them that but every time we every time they pray they pray for this country they pray for the Democrats and they pray for the previous no they don't pray for the Democrats pray for the Republicans they're all Republican and they pray that God will help this and that's okay I mean I'm not gonna stop them in the middle of the prayer and say no I bless God brother Brown said you can't do that but in my heart I'm like it's a wasted prayer he is God's not gonna bring this nation back he's already condemned it we can pray for individual people but not the nation there's not a hope left for this nation that's 1956 remember he said this year would be the year whether they brought it in or turned it down well anyway they turned their revival down 1956 Lord that's been a long time ago only an old-fashioned revival and according to the scripture it'll never be nationwide so then we're just left it'll be a revival among the people now look , the eat elect of God not everybody that sits in the church pew right but it won't be a real sweeping revival take the whole nation in never was never will be alright everybody got that say ma'am all right let's go to Genesis 15 just for a second we're gonna look now what happened was let's read this one yeah no go back to that one I missed that one I'm sorry I'm sorry go back to 7 there more oh there it is I got another page let's go down to the bottom the bride hasn't had a revival yet everybody got that bride hasn't had a revival yet all right there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to stir the bride yet yet we've seen signs and wonders in this church we've seen the dead raise the sick heal cancer go away we've seen guns brought back if brother Colley was here we've seen purses wherever Amy's not here but anyway we've seen God do things in this just in this little assembly rain be called for rain stop we thought we've had all that storm be talking away we've seen that but we've not been woke up according to the brother branham you know why tell us a word revival right brother that was preaching on anointing once I know anyone's can do every bit of that do you know for a fact Judas Iscariot cast out Devils through the name of Jesus did many mighty wonders in the name of Jesus Judas Iscariot the one that betrayed Jesus had signs and wonders so so good till they didn't know it actually deceived the other eleven because even at the night I've been reading I'm in the book of John when they're in the upper room jesus said John John the one laying on his bosom said Lord who is it he said the one I sought the cup with well he reaches the Bible says in socks it and Judas his cup and says go do what you need to do we'll leave on the Bible in the commentary John it shows the Comte says it says you know the words we thought he was just gonna go pay for the food we read he and I'm so deceived they didn't know what he was fixing to go do what about today we're looking for it it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again I believe we've heard them you might listen I have you may not have that's for you to decide cuz this the total plan of redemption reveal to you and that's what the thunders are it's not seven minutes not polygamy it's not getting seven wives why do they do that it will take those seven unknown thunders back there to what wake her up okay he will send it he promised it now if you believe William Brown to be a prophet which I do wholly I believe what he said if he prophesized if he tells us something just like the other day I was telling somebody you know when brother Brown stood up like 1960 I think it would he stood up and he said those denominational churches have become lodges now folks we went to one not too long ago and it's just like going to like our art Fela or whatever you want else club you know why cause brother Brown spoke it that's just what I believe he spoke they were lying is back in the sixties they can't get away from that why would you think of profit 1956 will say if they don't receive God this year he said she's gone now what was that that was the Word of God through a prophet their largest so their lodges they're not coming back the people are good but the lodges it's full of dead men's bone but the bride hasn't had a revival yet excuse me look at number 89 and then we'll go forward he's come back to Full Gospel people would come one heart and one Accord there'd be a revival that would shake the whole world every spiritual gift will be in the church within an hour's time after it took place signing signs and wonders that was done by the apostles will be a minor thing now this is 1948 and brother Branham steps up in about 10 years from that and he says there's been more people healed in my ministry than in my ministry and one night then Jesus had his hold three and a half years that's what he was feeling he say he felt listen being a prophet he felt a lot of things coming amen I believe he did he's a prophet he was prophetic he could see he was an eagle that was shaped the whole world without hit that was his revival the healing revival there brother brown started shook the world signs and wonders that was done by the Apostles will be a minor thing to what we'd do if we could just get the church together it's got to happen it will happen it may be after I passed off the scene but I want to put my word in this that you might know that my voice is this old Christian people bind yourself together with one heart and one Accord for God cannot no more send the gifts to the church until the church while the church is separated look at the people in the message and I'm just gonna name them one groups in Jeffersonville they don't have another doing nobody else if you don't just go to that place or if you just listen to tapes I'm just going to name them all then you got another place over here that says if you don't believe that you got two souls you're out then you got another one over here that says believe if you don't have the you say one of me how in the world it's got that confused this message is perfect man has got in it and messed it up but until we get everything back together God's not gonna send a revival he can't I got a quote I'm saving but brother man says God can't go to a denomination and make a revival because they don't have the word because we're looking now for a word revival we're not looking for great signs and wonders we're looking for a word revival a revival of the word when Jesus stood and said I and my father are one you're gonna have to hear me you know that was pretty good that Jesus said you're gonna have to hear me to have eternal life Paul said the same thing brother Brown said the same thing you'll be judged by my gospel but watch for God cannot no more send the gifts to the church while the church is separated we got divisions factions these places in this country that there's a church right here and 200 feet down the road there's another message Church and they don't speak to each other I know that for a fact okay cuz this church preaches something about marriage and divorce that that people don't like how are we gonna get it together we got to do it individually first we got to get it right but our problem is as we look at all these peripheral things clouds doesn't matter to me they're really done we solely must put our faith on the Word of God and the prophet of God give us divine revelation of that word and man I'm telling you if he didn't have a vindication there's no man was more vindicated than him except Jesus Christ no man because we're gonna read it in a minute no man then he can sent look for God can no more the gifts to the church until the churches while the church is separated then he can send the Holy Ghost then he can let me get that right for God cannot no more send two gifts to the church while the church is separated then he can send the Holy Ghost unless you're in one Accord that's right for it came by the Holy Ghost believe it verse number nine faith want delivered the Saints 1953 that's the reason we can't have a revival you've got to get back to God's faith again in the Bible where men and women become born-again and regenerated by the Holy Ghost then that man can't help from being a Christian he's a Christian by birth that's right now that's not natural birth that's the new birth you don't have to pledge him give him a card in other words beg him to come to church go visit him ever ever a Sunday or two if they don't show up just shows one thing not born again if he's born again brother you almost have to bar the door to keep him out amen you've got the cart before the horse brother that's what's the matter you've got to get Christ first instead of the church you got to put Christ first that's what we need today that's what America needs today that's what the whole nation the whole world needs today is an old-fashioned revival stirring God sent revival everybody okay with that that's your prophet telling you what his that's his example and I'm gonna skip through this so we don't have one I'll read it next Sunday because there was a revival during Daniels time there was a revival during Nehemiah's time there were certain revivals that came up there was a revival listen there was a revival when John the Baptist came on the scene it was reviving them from the old to the new ma'am all right now Jesus really wasn't a revival it was a resurrection he was trying to get people born again he was trying to give them the doctrine to be born again so that they could have a revival and then they had a revival in the upper room on the day of Pentecost they had a resurrection but what did you do it revived what they heard from Jesus it quickened what they had heard from God and like a brother said the other day now we got people in the message see what I mean you got people in the message that believe that the Apostles had the Holy Ghost before Jesus died find me a quote on that one it's not in the Bible because my Bible says in the book of John about birth about chapter 7 it says they didn't understand what Jesus said why because the Holy Ghost had not been given yet because Jesus had not been glorified how can you get the Holy Ghost when the man standing there had it in him and he said go to they go to the upper room and you will receive power being dude with power from on high Pope's I'm telling you if they had the baptism of the Holy Ghost and let that happen that happened to Jesus they prayed to let that happen no no they did call fire down out of heaven but see they couldn't do that even Jesus himself being the Holy Ghost submitted himself so much to the cross till he didn't use any of his power none at all you know what he saved it from me in you he saved it for us for us to use I don't want to go through this real quick and then we'll stop and then we'll back up a little bit but I want you to see that a revival listen hmm a revival begins when people start calling out for it and they're tired of the shape they're in they're tired of the things that's going on around them Israel got tired of all that the people got tired of all these things that people were crying out for a deliverer they weren't crying out though at first when there were no taskmaster when they could just eat of the ground and kill them a calf and you know but when when what when Egypt or the world started tightening up they said we need to get out of here Abram said we got a promised land we gonna go to you and I have a promised land we got to go to hey man all right let's look there was there was five I want you to see this every characteristic of a revival starts the same all right let's go to the there was five awakenings starting in 1730 you got to go off to all the way over to where it says great first first Great Awakening brother Anderson Bob oh Lord okay here we go Bob's my buddy first Great Awakening was in the nineteen 1730 now look when you see these days this is not from brother branham this is the commentary that I got got off of the Internet I read several of them and this was pretty close to what I needed first Great Awakening was 1732 the 1740s where England and then the colonies most notable Massachusetts what churches are lacks in their requirements for church participation and membership you see that word lacks that's what we become like some days alone churches are relaxed in their requirements for church participation and membership it is called the halfway covenant and it allowed children of non believing parents to still be baptized in good faith that they'd be reared with the morals of the church huh God makes a halfway covenant you know who made that covenant don't you it wasn't God and it allowed children of non-believers to be baptized in good faith that they'd be reared with the morals of the church and that did not happen remember that church membership is voluntary which creates a challenge for what is truth and the function of infant baptism as an usher into wider community citizens you see what they took they took from the Catholic Church and they still went to sprinkling the babies water baptism infant baptism we know that's not right who did it all right Jonathan Edwards is well known for his in the hand of an angry god and so many other well-crafted expiratory sermons that emphasize the rational appeal for faith now this is their coming out into a revival look who now that they spelled his name wrong it's not John Weasley they may have they may have pronounced T John Weasley but it's done Wesley now we note through the property gardener John Wesley was he was the church age messenger for that time all right he was greatly influenced by John Locke John Wesley thank you Charles wouldn't get it Bob I don't know if there's a copyright on that or not you better be careful John Wesley Charles Wesley and George Whitfield we've heard all these names in the message are several other instrumental leaders John Wesley begins the Methodist movement his brother Charles give its music writing 6,000 hemes Whitfield begins an orphanage in Savannah you know that you know actually John Wesley come across from England and resided in Savannah for a long time trying to convert the Indians remember and then as brother Dale tells us he's going back to England and he meets the Moravian people that are that have sanctification down bear and he does but what happens is God has the mold with Martin with John Wesley he can't mold with the Moravians because he didn't it's not going with a group he's got to have one messenger for a church age all right so he's that's why brother Brown chose John Wesley begins the Methodist moving Whitfield begins an orphanage in Savannah and it is still there and preached to nearly a million people throughout the colonies how to the local teaching of Edwards and the traveling ministry of Whitfield starting in Georgia worked up to Massachusetts the colonial people are convinced that there's convicted of their sins and renewed of their need for Jesus and then what happens from 1740 to 1820 go to the next one from 1740 to 1820 it goes back down again they get last they get look the moral fabric of society this is 1822 1850 the moral fabric of society is tattered torn by sin and misplaced affections that's a real nice way to put that misplaced affections they were sinners the desire to usher in the second coming of Jesus by saving Society provides the strongest impetus to make certain my kingdom come Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven who started it well here's the guy brother Branham talks about Charles Finney Charles many offers a fiery message of repentance in the big tents constructed for meetings left in weeks and weeks he Institute's the crying bench where invites those renewing renewing our professing faith to proceed down front and make a public commitment to Jesus The Awakening theology is clear infinities Escoffier 1 and anyone can heed the call Feeny helps to establish the Oberlin College as well how whereas the first Great Awakening works itself through the church the second will appeal to anyone and everyone you see when that first awakening came they were still is a big influence the Catholic Church everybody had to go still do infant baptism come from Catholic but you see how this is coming out whereas the first Great Awakening itself worked through the church the second work to anyone and everyone that's what I'm telling you now God is now working through us individuals a man he's not called a Beth of this church in the end time he's not called a random Church you understand what I'm saying he's called the Church of the Living God his children in the end time it brings about the temperance movement now that temperance is not that temperance that temperance is the alcohol movement they try to do away with alcohol the anti-slavery movement as well as the Underground Railroad women's rights the Salvation Army you see what a revival does it brings thoughts to people all right watch the YMCA and sees mighty growth in the Baptist and Methodist denominations all right let's go to the third one which is 1875 to 1885 where did it start in Chicago you know where this is going Dwight Moody I want you to see how many people Dwight Moody preached to the civil war ends in 1865 and with the Great Chicago Fire of 1871 the vulnerability of humanity is clear this backdrop provides the opportunity for me to see their need for Christ in other words what happened Chicago was wiped out they needed somebody to come in they needed God to come in and help them up watch DL moody begins a Bible study for street children in the 1850s it grows to a substantial number whereby even president-elect Abraham Lincoln attends to see it for himself now this is one guy Dwight Moody moody goes on to establish the moody church and Bible Institute and is still there and continues to preach all around the country to more than 100 million people IRA Sankey a notable hem writer works closely with moody how moody is uneducated and breaks out of the normal conventions of the church the appeal is simple Jesus wants you the way you are and come to him now because he's coming back soon all right now look at the next one we are all familiar with this one the Azusa Street revival 1906 to 1915 in Los Angeles in the church at 3:12 Azusa Street you know what it somebody was it worked for me a long time ago of McDonald's was from Azusa California you know what Azusa means there's everything in that City from A to Z in the USA a Z USA there was everything she said in that city what happened on the zoo's our streets parks what we know today as the Pentecostal movement it is built on the holiness movement which focuses on sanctification being noticeably separated from the habits of the world and as they is a repercussion of the Second Great Awakening on April the 9th 1906 the Spirit of God falls down and several people begin speaking in tongues they call it the second blessing or sometimes the third work of grace the first being salvation the second being sanctification who started it you have to have somebody to come the forefront William Seymour daddy Seymour is front and center from the disciples of the Charles Fox poem of Topeka Kansas and the influence of the evening light Saints our Church of God and address in Indiana Seymour sometimes prays for seven hours a day that's how you get a revival started for months on end not just come in and say one day I prayed for seven hours yesterday no months on end with an expectation that God would act in his timing how the revival helps integrate the church into a more harmonious unified community bringing together rich and poor black and white male and female humanism is beginning to take root with all of it with all that Superman thoughts of the future glories of society the Azusa revival and subsequent Ewell subsequent Pentecostal movement brought back into focus the gifts of the holy spirit and the unique place of the church is God's institution in the world to do his bidding and there's a quote where brother Brown says he's talking about in turn-of-the-century why why did God bring and this is the last one the 20th century revival when they don't have brother Branham in there but there's no doubt he was but what I'm telling you is there there was I said this before and I'm going to say it one more time when when man come to a place in the at the end of the coming into the 1900s cancer and all these horrible diseases were coming about and man had no cure science had not caught up with the disease the disease had had went past the science man all they could do for you and you kind of crazy but they would bleed you that bleeds you to try to get the bad blood out of you probably killed a lot of people but you see it was the ignorance of the people what happened was brother Graham said Christians started to call out to God I love that Christians started to cry out to God and say God man can't do this science cannot heal me God you're the one that's gonna have to do it see that's our problem we get a little sick go CVS go to the doctor go to walk quick care yeah go there a couple of times it ain't quick and you might get cared for but you know that but that's why God God you know God's waiting God knew that was gonna happen for the nice world he knew man was gonna get sick he knew but he let man start crying out to God instead of God just coming down so oh you're sick I'm gonna heal you I wish sometimes I do but at the turn of the century science did not catch up with the disease so God sent a healing campaign and I love what brother Brahm the angel told brother Brown said everything will be subject to you and then he says even why do you break out cancer because that was the dreaded disease you heard the word cancer you died but the angel said not even cancer will stand in your way bringing a healing campaign now what's happened now though and I thank God for medicine but what's happened now is medicine has kind of caught up with disease I mean if you get cancer now they pretty much cure you by God's grace you understand what I'm saying but it here's my point it's because man started crying out to God for something that they didn't have that's what you're not gonna have to do we're gonna have to cry out to God for something we don't have we do not have a glorified body yet we don't have that yet oh yeah potentially the inside man's eternal I want this guy eternal I don't know about y'all but I'll be 60 in a couple weeks hmm 20th century revival 1910 to the 70s American cities most notable in New York and Los Angeles my brother Brandon go to Los Angeles a lot West Coast the Industrial Age is in full force and Darwinism is reshaping our sense of the value of history in other words Darwin isn't come starts coming in there in the early 1900s so God sends a revival to repress all that so there's not true Darwinism it's not true that's the devil talking so Darwinism comes out and then God sends a messenger Billy Sunday much like the revivals before it this period is noted for its large gatherings and the accusation of sin and proxy many of people to the gates of hell as a result of their wayward lives who began it well Billy Sunday did it first Bobby brother branham stepped into the healing part and all right roll it up please who Billy Sunday everybody know Billy Sunday we've heard of it his name Billy sign me a professional baseball player did you know that he was supposed to sign with like the New York Giants and he was supposed to get like a contract that was unbelievable at that time but he turned it down to preach the gospel because God told him his field was not the ball field if you'll read about Billy Sunday a professional baseball player turned preacher is direct and powerful with the gospel message beginning in 1907 he carries the message to 1.5 million people around the country in month-long meetings is he his preaches he preaches up until his death in 1935 then remember he died and then brother branham gets his commission Billy Graham enters the scene with vigor in 1949 with his Los Angeles Crusades about the same time you know brother Martin starts in 48 that catches the attention of the press he goes on to hold more than 400 Crusades in 185 countries attracting arena sized crowds and broadcasting many Crusades on television then while add what we know is his brother branham came up during that time and had a healing campaign like no other but what happened there's a lot of people fall fell into that and try to copycat it but remember whatever even in God's journals they'll tell you that brother Branham was the founder of the healing campaign they don't doubt that now they said later on he went off and you know got off the word we know let's just allow the devil but say everybody puts him I guess except this guy but Sunday and grammar' two of many who see the fraying of culture both before the wars and certainly after World War two but I want to tell you something as powerful as they were they never changed anything the world kept getting worse same way now brother Brown didn't change anything he changed individual people he didn't come to change a nation he didn't come to shape a denomination he didn't come to shape something so that we can all get in this big circle he come to shape individuals for the glory of God not not not group individuals they represented the preaching arm of revival Francis Buckman who began the Oxford group and Alcoholics Anonymous Robert Pierce that founds World Vision and Samaritan's Purse which now Samaritans purchased purse is taken over by the Graham Foundation represent the social armored revival Graham's work is careful to work with local churches the outgrowth of the movement is not isolated but designate it to be stimulus a stimulus for strong church participation in the discipleship but then you got brother Branham and I'll bring a quote a couple of Sundays from now where brother Brown says he interviewed Billy Graham said he don't have thirty thousand converse and go back to find thirty five now that's depressing you know why cuz he wasn't getting them to Christ he was getting them to a feeling or any emotion brother Branham wasn't doing that he was getting the people to Christ there's a wealth of information out there but each of these five great revivals watch this more than could be addressed in this blog post God's work is not isolated but sometimes we see it concentrated around specific places and people like in the case of us could God be working toward a revival now no except for us know may our hearts and minds be open may our posture be prayer may our hope being the Living God who will seek and save those who are lost may we be his instruments now that's the guy a nominal guy they had a real good commentary about the revival but he never mentioned the message of the alum he never mentions William Branham we know something he don't know we know that God sent a prophet he sent a prophet that began as a worldwide revival of a healing campaign what about brother Brown said he said I went to one place what was it he prayed for people and he'd get tired and laid down on a cot on the pulpit and then get back up and pray for 20,000 people go back and lay back down a cot not to eat for three days he gave his life for that but you know what that kept dwindling away though that went from thirty thousand to three thousand from thousand to 300 from 300 to thirty why because he brought the word he brought the word pure and unadulterated sure he threw the net out there when the musicians come he threw the net out there when when he was preaching to Baptists and Methodists and Pentecostals but buddy I'm telling you in 1962 when he preached his spoken words original seed he said thousands of my friends will leave me why because he brought it down to one seed and that was what the original was not some hybrid he called him hybrid he preached hybrid religion listen there's nothing wrong with denominational people they're good people there's some good they some people outshine us in the denominational world but they can't have a word revival you and I are the only people that can have a word revival because we have the word pure and unadulterated estándar our feet listen folks we can't lose there's gonna revival be started by somebody individuals it's why can't it be us you like I said you'd say well I don't see anything see believe believe it in you will see pray for a revival here we come up to a new year we make all these new year's resolution we eat ourselves to gain 20 pounds and then we we make a resolution in January to lose that same 20 pounds if we just not gained it in the first place we wouldn't had to make that resolution in that right skinny gal that stands back then 20 years old yeah you can maybe not getting 20 pounds but some of us some of us look at food gain treatments as we get older but to revival will start when you get serious we're going to open the weave I believe we're gonna weave open the door to tell you how we'll have a few more sermons on it but if you'll notice every every every revival started when people got tired of the status quo they got tired of what they were living under during the time that they were there Israel John the Baptist came because there was a call out of the Old Testament to come into the new there was a call for a group of people to come out of a Catholic Church till they were tired of dealing with what the Hail Marys in the oh god said Martin Luther didn't get him all the way out but he sent Martin Luther to have a revival but you and I our revival he's gonna happen inside of you but I hope and pray there's like a pressure cooker you know you got them pressure cookers at home and you you put everything in there and you turn the thing up and it starts boiling you don't hear a lot but the pressures building and then the pressure is building and then all of a sudden right at the top of that pressure cooker there's a little thing it goes why there's so much pressure built up on the inside it's got a little little bit out at the time so I hope God lets a little bit out lifts next
