[4:04] 33 I want to thank everybody for praying
[4:08] for us during all of that time you know
[4:11] that my heart was out of rhythm and
[4:14] everything else kicking around but they
[4:17] shocked it back in there Monday and it's
[4:22] okie dokie so everything's fine there's
[4:24] no problem and uh we just thank God for
[4:28] that everything's
[4:30] really really in good shape so we thank
[4:32] you I talked to brother Claude weinger
[4:34] this morning and he's uh doing better
[4:38] you know he had a a minor I guess you
[4:40] call it a mini stroke or whatever and he
[4:44] he said he was doing a whole lot better
[4:46] they still some tests and some things
[4:48] that they're doing so you know we just
[4:52] we appreciate the Lord taking care of
[4:54] him and uh I forgot to do it last
[4:56] weekend we're glad to have Sister
[4:58] Barbara back with us cuz she'd been gone
[5:00] for about a month there and with her
[5:04] husband on a trip and but we're glad
[5:07] that God took care of and brought her
[5:08] back to us and all of that so we
[5:10] appreciate it uh remember now the that
[5:14] brother Aaron will be preaching is
[5:16] coming Wednesday we haven't had two you
[5:18] know we off two Wednesdays and because
[5:20] of bad weather but maybe everything will
[5:22] be all right this Wednesday but brother
[5:24] Aaron the Lord willing be preaching for
[5:25] us Wednesday remember the Bible study
[5:28] will be Saturday at 6 remember the
[5:31] fellowship meeting will be on the 3D
[5:35] Saturday at 3:30 and brother Matthew
[5:38] Bray will be preaching that and on into
[5:41] the Sunday services so getting all of
[5:44] these announcements out of the way if
[5:46] I'm missing
[5:47] any heard from Wade he's doing great
[5:50] that he preached yesterday which you
[5:52] know they're they're day ahead of us
[5:54] about 13 hours or something and uh so
[5:58] he's he's done that said they had I
[6:00] believe she said June didn't say had 250
[6:02] 300 people or something in the service
[6:05] and and all so that's it's working real
[6:08] good and pray that the Lord will bless
[6:11] but now that he needs his clothes
[6:13] because Delta is real good at uh losing
[6:18] things and they're and I understand they
[6:21] have a big thing but I've been to
[6:23] Jamaica about 10 11 times and the only
[6:26] time I ever flew Delta they lost
[6:28] everything I had
[6:30] so the only thing I had was the carry on
[6:32] but they're trying to get it and working
[6:35] it out and through sister Mila and
[6:37] talking and everybody they they've I
[6:40] think they've located his clothes some
[6:41] of them but he's doing all right so
[6:45] he's I guess he's found out what I said
[6:47] was true that over there they like that
[6:50] thing of what they call them Baron it's
[6:52] a it's a thing you put over it you know
[6:55] those great big chics and all them guys
[6:57] wear them great big fancy ones with
[6:59] these are a little you know a whole lot
[7:00] less but you can wear them and they call
[7:03] them a they say you're like a tuxedo
[7:07] when you're wearing that and uh boy when
[7:10] I found it out I didn't wear a tie after
[7:12] then and uh so he'll he'll be in good
[7:15] shape so I think he had to go out and
[7:17] buy him some but you know to be able to
[7:20] do cuz they were all in his luggage but
[7:23] the Lord will take care of him I just
[7:25] pray that they'll bless and heal they're
[7:27] going into some ministers meetings and
[7:29] things that they're going to be having
[7:31] and he'll be you know be put to the test
[7:34] because there'll be some there you
[7:37] remember the story was when I was there
[7:40] and we had that ministers meeting and
[7:42] this brother he kept asking this
[7:44] question well I just it was just
[7:45] something in the way he was setting I
[7:47] couldn't get it and the brother was
[7:50] blind but now you talking about quoting
[7:52] this message I mean it's easy for him to
[7:55] say paragraph 278 Hebrews chapter 3 book
[8:00] one you know and you can turn over there
[8:02] and read it cuz he he he does that but I
[8:06] couldn't figure out what he was to
[8:07] saying so I said brother Ernie come up
[8:09] here and find out what this man saying I
[8:11] don't mind answering this question but I
[8:13] want to know what he's talking about you
[8:14] know what he's asking me well brother
[8:16] Ernie got up if you remember and told
[8:17] him said well we got a blind man asking
[8:20] a question and said we got a deaf man
[8:23] trying to answer it so we was you
[8:27] know we got his an or do no amen but
[8:32] we'll go ahead and read our scripture
[8:33] and then we'll get brother Timbo to come
[8:35] up okay father we thank you for the day
[8:38] and the hour that we have and thank you
[8:39] for all things and we ask you to just
[8:41] bless and guide each one of us Lord be
[8:43] with way there and give him Lord
[8:45] whatever has need of for the times and
[8:47] all of being there with the people and
[8:50] Lord we know that they're receiving from
[8:52] you the word that we would receive here
[8:56] if he was here ministering to us so we
[8:58] pray that you'd bless bless and Open the
[9:00] Eyes of each one's heart and the hearing
[9:02] Lord of each ear we love you and we
[9:05] thank you Father and guide each one here
[9:07] now open our eyes this day remember the
[9:10] the promise in your word because there's
[9:12] many sicknesses and things among us and
[9:14] you said in your word that you sent your
[9:16] word and healed us and delivered us from
[9:19] destruction so we Praise Your Great Name
[9:22] we love you and we thank you in Jesus is
[9:24] your name amen Genesis 1 we'll read
[9:28] these and
[9:31] then I mean Revelations 1 excuse
[9:35] me let's drop over to save time reading
[9:39] verse 12 and I turned to see the voice
[9:41] that spake with me and being turned I
[9:43] saw seven golden candles sticks and in
[9:46] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[9:48] like unto the son of man clothed with a
[9:50] garment down to the foot and gir about
[9:53] to paps with a golden girdle now let's
[9:57] go to Genesis this is
[10:00] one very familiar scripture with all of
[10:03] us and God said let us make man in our
[10:06] image after our
[10:09] likeness and let them have dominion now
[10:11] notice them have dominion over the fish
[10:15] of the sea and over the foul of the air
[10:17] and over the cattle and over all the
[10:19] Earth and ever over every creeping thing
[10:22] that creepeth upon the Earth so God
[10:25] created man in his own image in the
[10:27] image of God created he him
[10:29] male and female created he them now if
[10:34] we get to this scripture we will be
[10:37] trying to cover you know a little bit if
[10:40] it don't we'll pick it up in
[10:43] another
[10:44] Point got a marker there it is job 33
[10:49] and verse
[10:51] 24 then he is gracious unto him and
[10:57] saith deliver him him from going down to
[11:00] the pit I have found a ransom you may be
[11:05] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[11:07] reading of the word the Timo would you
[11:08] come up and just he has a little
[11:10] testimony and he wants to give us about
[11:13] what the Lord has helped him and done so
[11:16] we appreciate it and uh we believe in
[11:20] God dealing with us right yes sir bless
[11:22] you buddy let's go ahead God bless thank
[11:24] you all
[11:27] right all right most of you got guys
[11:29] know me you guys all pretty much know
[11:31] who I am but um you guys don't know
[11:33] nothing about me where I came from in
[11:35] the background I come from I grew up in
[11:37] this message my mom and dad my mom and
[11:39] dad raised me the best they can they
[11:41] gave us the best we've always had but I
[11:44] went out and did stuff on my own wanting
[11:47] just I was addicted to heroin for 10
[11:49] years cocaine alcohol just whatever I
[11:53] could I I the spirit was in me hated
[11:55] myself it didn't want to live but so but
[12:00] I had the escape from I came to visit
[12:03] Joe and God really helped me out from
[12:05] coming here with you guys I learned a
[12:06] lot and but them Spirits were always
[12:09] there even though I know that this
[12:12] message it's all in my head you know
[12:14] what I mean it's all I've been taught
[12:16] this my whole life and um I just want to
[12:18] give you a little background where I
[12:19] come from but it started
[12:22] about uh last month it was the 28th this
[12:25] brother called me he's been he he was a
[12:27] stranger to us at one time he just came
[12:29] and visited us and he said um it was
[12:32] like 6 months ago he told me some things
[12:35] only God would know so I knew God spoke
[12:37] to him to his heart so once then that
[12:40] kind of scared me it got me enthused for
[12:42] a while but it went away I just kept
[12:44] doing the same things I said oh I'm all
[12:47] right I had a religious spirit on I had
[12:49] a religious spirit on me I was like okay
[12:50] I got it all up here but I was still
[12:52] doing wrong things and
[12:55] um and I just I couldn't do it I
[12:59] couldn't do it no more and he came about
[13:01] the 28th of last month he came he called
[13:04] texted me and said well brother God

[13:25] pray uh just pray for me nervous but you
[13:30] guys are all seasoned in the word
[13:33] so all right but he said fast and pray

[20:30] of the Lord he said and I said and then
[20:33] he's he's all okay and then we didn't
[20:34] even get outside he shook my hand said I
[20:36] need to talk to you come to the study
[20:38] and um he said I ain't here to preach he
[20:40] said I'm God sent me here to talk to you
[20:43] and we went back to the study we talked
[20:45] to he talked a little bit he just said
[20:47] BR he said brother God wants to deliver
[20:49] you and stuff he said these demons are
[20:51] laughing at you he said because they
[20:54] think they're going to come back he said
[20:55] but you just don't have the power right
[20:57] now to overcome the these spirits and I
[20:59] said well I agreed with him I said I
[21:01] believe that cuz I try to quit chewing
[21:03] tobacco or smoking or whatever I did
[21:05] quit smoking but I just threw it in the
[21:08] closet I never got delivered and it just
[21:11] came back in a different form of tobacco
[21:13] and the addiction was always there it
[21:16] just changed its form into pills and it
[21:20] just changed its form so and I truly
[21:23] wanted Deliverance every time I came I
[21:25] always wanted to pray I came up
[21:27] sincerely in the bottom my heart wanting
[21:28] Deliverance but them religious Spirits
[21:31] were holding me with those were just
[21:33] didn't let they didn't want to get
[21:34] evicted you know what I mean they just
[21:36] let me get so high so that he took me to
[21:39] the back of the study we talked a little
[21:41] bit and he said he pulled out a a
[21:44] message book that Jean gave him the last
[21:46] time he was there he said he said
[21:49] brother and he read me some quotes and I
[21:52] he said um there's a light he he said um
[21:55] he said you can't do this on your own he
[21:57] I don't remember the exact quotes but he
[21:59] said you can't do this on your own and
[22:00] um you've been trying to do it yourself
[22:02] this whole time and you can't do that
[22:05] and I said I said yeah it's true he said
[22:07] there's a light inside you that you
[22:09] can't that it's there there's a hunger
[22:11] in there but these Spirits are too
[22:14] strong for you you can't overcome right
[22:16] now but God's going to give you the
[22:17] power to overcome them and I said I want
[22:19] the power and stuff I said that in my
[22:21] heart we talked a little bit he said go
[22:23] get sister Esther oh he didn't know
[22:25] nothing what was going I didn't tell him
[22:26] we were going through no problems or
[22:27] nothing but he brought all this out and
[22:29] I was like and then I knew it was had to
[22:31] be God With Us and he said go get sister
[22:34] Esther and I went the house got her and
[22:36] said come on come talk he wants to talk
[22:38] to us and he talked with us and he said
[22:41] he said write this down sister Ester and
[22:42] he gave her a piece of paper and said
[22:44] write this down small town of lincolon
[22:47] he said um not very much jobs too much
[22:50] work to do around here um not uh not
[22:54] enough resources just a bunch of list
[22:57] what was on my heart
[22:58] I I got it tacked up on the wall at the
[23:00] house but um just a list a list of what
[23:04] was on my
[23:05] heart I didn't tell him the only thing I
[23:07] told him I said there's just not I'm not
[23:08] making enough there but he all this
[23:11] other stuff he brought out and had her
[23:14] write it down for me and um he looked at
[23:16] me and said brother Timothy what on this
[23:19] piece of paper is worth not doing God's
[23:22] will and I looked at the list and I said
[23:25] nothing's not worth doing God's will I
[23:27] want to do God will and
[23:29] everything and he said okay brother
[23:32] we're going to he talked with Esther a
[23:33] little bit I forgot what they were
[23:35] saying but he said he said brother we're
[23:37] going to pray for you he said and he got
[23:39] we got in the corner of the study he put
[23:41] his hand he put his hands on my head
[23:43] like this and he said sister Esther
[23:45] stand behind him and hold his hands like
[23:46] this and she held she was behind me she
[23:49] held my hands and um he said we're going
[23:52] to pray we started praying and um all of
[23:55] a sudden I I talked to God in my heart
[23:57] and I said God God if you're going to do
[23:58] something for me oh I I told him first I
[24:00] said I've been trying to do this my
[24:02] myself my whole time and I keep failing
[24:04] I can't do it no more and I was sincere
[24:06] in my heart I said I can't do this no
[24:08] more I said I can't do this no more and
[24:10] I said God if you're going to do
[24:11] something for me I need you to heal my
[24:13] stomach and my liver because I abused it
[24:15] in the past that I really abused it in
[24:18] the past and all of a sudden I spoke
[24:21] that of my heart all of a sudden that
[24:22] brother reached down and grabbed my
[24:23] stomach and said uh heal this brother
[24:27] from all the poisonous things he put in
[24:29] his body and then all of a sudden I lost
[24:32] I knew it was something Supernatural I
[24:35] lost total control my my hands started
[24:38] squeezing so tight they were squeezing
[24:40] so tight and like they started curling
[24:43] back like drawing back and I I realized
[24:46] I didn't have control over my body and
[24:48] my mind was saying stop stop this and I
[24:50] couldn't stop it and I screamed out as
[24:52] loud as I could I screamed I with with
[24:55] all my mind I screamed as hard as I
[24:57] could but no voice was coming I was like
[24:59] like like that and the awfulest taste
[25:01] was coming out of my mouth like a metal
[25:03] or a sulfur and my eyes F they're going
[25:06] to pop out of my head there was uh snot
[25:09] coming out of my nose and then all of
[25:11] all of a sudden I I said God help me cuz
[25:13] I was scared of death I I couldn't
[25:15] control myself and when I fell to the
[25:17] floor I was up against the wall was like
[25:19] this and I was up against the wall of my
[25:20] neck like that I couldn't move he said
[25:23] and I was and then all of a sudden the
[25:25] burning and fire stopped coming out of
[25:27] my it was like pull P me forward cuz it
[25:28] was coming out of my face it felt like
[25:29] those Spirits were coming out and all of
[25:32] a sudden those um I I was on the floor
[25:35] shaking I didn't have I couldn't get up
[25:37] my mind was saying get up off that floor
[25:38] you can get up and I was trying to I
[25:40] couldn't get up it was just I was
[25:41] shaking I couldn't move he said sister
[25:43] Esther go get some water and she ran in
[25:45] there I don't know where she got the
[25:47] water from she came back with some water
[25:48] and he said in Jesus Christ's name I
[25:50] turned in Jesus Christ's name turn this
[25:53] pre this water into your precious Holy
[25:54] Blood and he sprinkled it on me and
[25:56] rubbed my head on the top but now that I
[25:59] when I get excited about it my head
[26:01] still feels numb gets numb on top but
[26:05] but after that I got I he helped me off
[26:07] the floor and I was in shock I was
[26:08] shaking I was I was scared of death and
[26:11] I he he I said brother did you cast The
[26:13] Demon out and he said brother I didn't
[26:16] and then later on that night then he he
[26:20] left and I went and took care of some
[26:22] things that I didn't have the power to
[26:24] take care of before but I went and took
[26:25] care of them and um
[26:28] but I haven't been the same since amen
[26:31] you know what I mean my appetite's
[26:33] changed that it's it's been a reality to
[26:36] me so much every promise in that book is
[26:39] mine I'm going to be the one to take a
[26:41] body change you know what I mean if God
[26:43] wants me to do it he's going to give me
[26:44] the power the strength the words to say
[26:46] it to do it but and then that night I I
[26:50] fell asleep on the couch and the dog
[26:52] started going crazy about 3:00 in the
[26:54] morning just crazy barking at at like in
[26:57] the certain area of this room of our
[26:59] house his barking and at that time I had
[27:02] a a dream about this man he he had a
[27:06] little snake and he had his mouth
[27:07] stretched wide open he said stick your
[27:09] hand in here and I was like I ain't
[27:10] going to do that and I woke up and then
[27:13] the dog was still going crazy and I I
[27:14] said I prayed and went back to sleep but
[27:16] then when I woke up I realized I've seen
[27:18] that snake before in a dream but the
[27:21] last time I seen it that snake was so
[27:22] huge going through the rafters of a
[27:24] house and I didn't have the power over
[27:26] it but now I have the power to overcome
[27:30] it's it's a reality to me now it's so
[27:33] real it's so
[27:41] real
[27:43] amen see God is still
[27:46] real he is still real if we'll just take
[27:49] it and believe it he'll come to it may
[27:53] take a
[27:54] while sometimes he doesn't come on the
[27:57] scene as as quick as we think he needs
[27:58] to but he's there he's always there you
[28:02] don't have to worry about it he'll be
[28:03] there when you need him righten amen and
[28:06] amen appreciate that testimony cuz we're
[28:09] talking about what a living God
[28:11] Amen the reality of understanding that
[28:14] God is
[28:16] real not just a thought or an
[28:19] imagination or you know things are a
[28:23] spirit as we talk about you know God is
[28:25] a Spirit Well I believe that that yes
[28:29] but then that
[28:30] spirit that God can take a form and
[28:35] appear and be a lot more well you know
[28:38] that was part of him to start with that
[28:40] wasn't uh you remember we talking about
[28:43] the attributes of God how did he had all
[28:46] of those attributes in him before the
[28:48] world ever
[28:49] begun and in doing that then you know we
[28:53] look at him and we see that he's real
[28:56] he's not just a thought he's not just
[28:58] something in your
[28:59] imagination because until you have an
[29:02] experience with him that's all you can
[29:05] believe I I don't care who you are or
[29:07] how much you think you know or whatever
[29:11] you cannot know God the prophet said
[29:13] without a definite experience of the
[29:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost it's only in
[29:19] your head and that's what Timo was
[29:22] talking about sure he had it in his head
[29:24] he's tried in his head to work out
[29:27] things he's tried in his life to do you
[29:29] know and been there with him some things
[29:32] and all he's tried to work out things
[29:34] but you don't work them out with your
[29:37] head right you got to get a reality in
[29:39] your heart then something can take place
[29:42] well then see that's the way that I've
[29:45] been talking about God he is real he's
[29:47] not just a thought or an imagination or
[29:50] you know a good thought because there's
[29:53] doctrines of that that people actually
[29:56] teach you know that that God is just the
[29:58] the good thoughts and the devil is the
[30:00] bad thoughts and you're the rest of it
[30:03] well where did you come from you know
[30:05] that's the only thing that I say but now
[30:09] see that's what we've been talking about
[30:11] and you know last week we were talking
[30:13] about the message of how we look at the
[30:19] creation and we can understand the
[30:22] Creator by looking at the creation by
[30:24] looking around us we can understand it
[30:27] and we can see how real he is by seeing
[30:30] what's around us and what takes place
[30:34] but now like I said until you have an
[30:36] experience you don't know what people's
[30:38] talking about you can talk about it you
[30:41] can talk about what is and what was be
[30:44] or oh we've seen that in people we've
[30:46] seen them but and you know then you can
[30:49] uh through the parts of your
[30:51] imaginations and memories and things you
[30:53] can work up some of your own
[30:56] experiences to where you can think oh I
[30:58] know this is real because this that the
[31:00] other but without a personal
[31:03] experience God's not real to
[31:05] you a guy years ago you know said God is
[31:08] dead well see to 90% of the people of
[31:11] the world God is dead because they don't
[31:14] have a living God Amen you all right but
[31:19] what about you and
[31:20] me how real is our God Amen right and
[31:25] dry trying and driving hard to to try to
[31:29] make us to
[31:32] understand if there is a
[31:35] Creator we can look at his creation and
[31:38] see him
[31:40] amen because that's the way he works he
[31:43] reveals himself
[31:45] through the people that he's made all
[31:48] right and what was the last thought that
[31:50] we had you know we were talking about
[31:53] not that God has a soul see that's an
[31:57] incorrect
[31:59] terminology you know it's not that he
[32:01] has a soul because that means it's just
[32:04] something when you start getting into
[32:06] the nature part of it you really get
[32:08] messed up but to realize that he is a
[32:12] soul amen the soul being what we gave
[32:15] the definitions of seeing talking about
[32:17] it a soul is a
[32:19] being it's a
[32:22] person right that's what a soul is
[32:25] that's what Webster says in that's what
[32:27] the definition of the word literally
[32:30] means that the soul is the real you all
[32:34] right we went through talking about even
[32:36] that see the soul is more real than your
[32:38] body and your
[32:40] spirit but yet we can see the
[32:43] body and we can watch the reactions of
[32:46] the spirit part of us and we think
[32:49] that's more real than the soul really is
[32:52] but
[32:54] remember as we'll get to it in a minute
[32:56] in Matthew you there Jesus says Don't
[32:58] Fear them that can destroy the body
[33:01] right said but but fear him that can
[33:05] destroy the soul well there's no way
[33:08] that the soul can be destroyed by
[33:11] mankind you just release it from this
[33:14] human elements that we are if you kill
[33:16] somebody you know it just that Soul
[33:19] leaves out and as it leaves out see then
[33:23] it's got to go somewhere all right the
[33:26] prophet saw
[33:27] Souls under the altar as we'll get back
[33:29] to in a little bit and see but we're so
[33:33] greatly revelated that's that's what
[33:35] gets me about
[33:37] people till you say Souls under the
[33:39] altar that's fifth sealed Jew brother
[33:42] Dale don't know the message well I'd
[33:44] invite you to go back to the prophet's
[33:46] message and just run
[33:49] in talking about souls in prison or
[33:53] Souls Under The Altar and just study it
[33:56] a little bit and see what he said about
[33:58] it cuz that's all we're trying to do I'm
[34:01] not smart enough you're not smart enough
[34:03] no human being is smart enough to be
[34:07] able to do anything uh I have some some
[34:10] scriptures when we get back to it if we
[34:12] get through there today on the soul of
[34:15] talking about it how that that it says
[34:17] there's no way that a that a brother can
[34:20] redeem amen you can't redeem me right I
[34:25] can't redeem you that's right amen
[34:27] there's no way all I can do is try to
[34:30] help
[34:31] you see he's the one that has to do the
[34:34] redeeming and only he can do it only he
[34:38] as we read there has found a
[34:40] ransom for the soul of mankind well if
[34:43] he's found a ransom for the soul of
[34:45] mankind then God is a soul yeah but we
[34:49] just but we just see that's what we've
[34:51] been taught all of
[34:53] life right we don't look at what we are
[34:57] and try to
[34:59] comprehend you
[35:01] know what you and I
[35:04] are and understand what we are what's
[35:07] motivating you well it's just a spirit
[35:09] motivate well a dog has
[35:13] that right a cat an animal has a spirit
[35:17] part about him but they don't have a
[35:19] soul right all right and see by not
[35:23] having a soul they're not a real being
[35:25] that's right they're an
[35:27] animal all right they're real to their
[35:30] part of what they're supposed to be but
[35:32] they're not a they're not a real being
[35:35] see that's what I'm trying to get you
[35:37] and I to see and and the first quote is
[35:40] one we use before many times so go ahead
[35:43] brother and we'll just read this and and
[35:45] get started on it cuz I like to
[35:48] uh I like for the prophet to do it I
[35:51] have one in here that where I've got
[35:52] about two or three pages that we're just
[35:55] going to read the whole thing
[35:57] you know because he's the one with the
[36:01] answer then you can't argue with him so
[36:05] you can argue with me I don't believe
[36:07] that I got quotes too well you know you
[36:12] mean you got a contradiction in the
[36:14] message just like you believe there's a
[36:16] contradiction in the
[36:22] Bible same old Spirit right but look
[36:25] what he says
[36:27] this is questions and answers on Genesis
[36:29] paragraph
[36:30] 13 and look what he gets down to talking
[36:33] about he's talking about God formed Man
[36:34] Out of the Dust of the ground breed into
[36:36] his nostrils we haven't got to that
[36:39] yet all right we'll get over there Lord
[36:42] willing maybe this evening or next week
[36:44] one
[36:47] but trying to stay back there to
[36:50] understand and the only way we can go
[36:52] back there to
[36:55] understand is by way of the
[36:58] Prophet well we got the
[37:01] scriptures what we need a prophet for we
[37:04] need a prophet to tell us what the
[37:06] scriptures are saying he didn't change
[37:08] the
[37:10] scriptures they said what they said to
[37:12] start with we were the ones who had that
[37:15] self interpreted to the point you know
[37:18] that we believed it meant this right it
[37:21] wouldn't ask for a raise of hand but how
[37:22] many was trinitarians before we heard of
[37:25] this message right
[37:27] well you know there's no such thing in
[37:29] the Bible well yes they are we believe
[37:32] it you know well see you're not going to
[37:34] convince people head arguments is not
[37:37] going to work now how many times have I
[37:41] made this quote to you I'm not speaking
[37:44] to your body right CU all I can do
[37:49] speaking body to body is get you mad at
[37:53] me right right I'm not trying to speak
[37:58] to your
[37:59] spirit because that gets into the memory
[38:03] the conscience affection and see then
[38:06] you can start looking at me and and I'll
[38:08] say but but brother so and so you done
[38:11] wrong you done wrong
[38:16] too that's body and spirit fighting each
[38:19] other that's right and you're not going
[38:22] to listen to what I'm
[38:24] saying irregardless of if I told you
[38:28] that God told me to tell you
[38:30] that you're not going to believe
[38:34] it cuz you're going to go away in your
[38:36] own
[38:37] self I told him off he told me I was
[38:40] wrong I told him he is wrong and ain't
[38:43] none of us no good we're all just
[38:46] problems well ain't nobody got no
[38:49] problem with that we know
[38:51] that but I try to speak from an inward
[38:54] part of me that God has spoken to
[38:59] me about
[39:01] this and I'm trying my best to express
[39:04] what he speaks to me about and that's
[39:06] soul to soul that's not body to body
[39:08] that's not Spirit to
[39:11] Spirit all right it's from an inward
[39:17] being that I believe is the holy spirit
[39:20] directing
[39:22] me and see as long as it lines up with
[39:26] the word
[39:27] word I don't have any trouble so then I
[39:30] have to read what the prophet
[39:33] says to be able to make sure I got it
[39:35] lined up right right you but you don't
[39:38] have to read it all to me brother Dale
[39:40] well you got a smart elic mind right
[39:42] there and you're automatically admitting
[39:44] up in your spirit not in your soul that
[39:48] you're wrong in your
[39:52] spirit
[39:55] sorry
[39:57] because have you ever noticed brother
[39:59] Brandon brother Donnie and I talk about
[40:01] it yesterday have you ever noticed him
[40:05] right in the middle of the
[40:07] great uh preaching of the
[40:10] seals and he uh he said I want questions
[40:14] and answers on what I've preached here
[40:17] on the seals he said don't make it these
[40:19] others just kind of paraphrasing it
[40:22] don't make it to other things as much
[40:24] right now let's put it right here
[40:27] and what was the questions he
[40:30] got what about Matthew 28:19 compared to
[40:34] act
[40:36] 238 should women wear pajamas to
[40:43] bed go in and check it he got one
[40:49] question and I imagine about the time he
[40:52] got that question I'm just honest I
[40:54] figure he's probably so uh
[40:56] downhearted until the only question he
[41:00] got does you know first Thessalonians
[41:02] about the man of sin you know said said
[41:04] does that fulfill the first seal he said
[41:06] yes and went right on to panty
[41:10] hoes right I don't know what went next
[41:12] but I'm just making the point right
[41:15] right the man was probably so down and
[41:18] out long about that time he thought I
[41:20] guess I just need to quit and go
[41:23] home but you know what he done he just
[41:25] answered answer them questions he said
[41:28] this is a question on somebody's
[41:32] mind he said they want to know about
[41:36] this I was trying to remember it I
[41:39] believe I believe it says the
[41:44] baptism we was listening to a tape the
[41:46] other day and and really it was funny to
[41:48] me cuz you know how brother brandom is
[41:50] about it and it's right about you know
[41:52] when he's up speaking he don't want
[41:54] pictures taken he don't want things
[41:55] moving around he don't want thing
[41:57] because that's the spirit part uh and
[41:59] and he'd say you know don't don't ask
[42:02] you don't ask nobody a question while
[42:03] they're trying to preach you know I mean
[42:07] you say well anybody got a question
[42:08] that's a different thing but we were
[42:10] listening to One in which I actually
[42:12] started lifing you know what he was
[42:14] doing he was explaining water
[42:19] baptism what to four ladies to Four
[42:25] Women
[42:27] and those women were talking back to him
[42:29] all the way through the time not
[42:32] necessarily arguing with
[42:34] him you know no no them saying now
[42:36] brother random you're wrong it would but
[42:38] all through that whole thing he was
[42:40] talking to them Four Women about water
[42:43] baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:47] Christ and they was just talking back to
[42:50] him and just saying things while he's
[42:52] saying it he said that's right sister
[42:54] that that's what I'm trying to explain
[42:57] you
[42:58] know I thought he sure got to be a good
[43:01] Christian even hang on with that let
[43:02] alone a
[43:04] prophet cuz you've heard him say this
[43:06] statement right you ever heard him make
[43:08] this statement he said somebody wanted
[43:10] to question me about I believe it was
[43:12] water baptism but anyhow something he
[43:14] said I found out it was a woman preacher
[43:17] and said I didn't contact her to talk to
[43:22] her but here he is one time that way
[43:24] here he is the other time you know
[43:26] that he just I well I'll try to remember
[43:28] it and we'll get it but I believe it
[43:30] just says the baptism or something in
[43:33] that order I I'll get it off the tap and
[43:35] tell you where it's
[43:37] at but you see Church my
[43:41] point we've got to believe what the
[43:44] prophet
[43:46] said all right and forget what we
[43:52] think I was explaining something to
[43:54] brother Donnie there yesterday
[43:56] that I believe you ever noticed brother
[43:58] Bram own the stature of a perfect
[44:01] man and uh you know he he never uses the
[44:05] scripture that actually says
[44:11] stature he doesn't use it it's over in
[44:14] Ephesians 4 I think is that right where
[44:16] he talking about coming to the fullness
[44:17] of the stature there's a scripture there
[44:20] that says stature s t a t e that we
[44:23] talking about he never used that
[44:25] scripture
[44:27] and emphasize that
[44:30] point that see there the Bible calls it
[44:32] a
[44:34] stature and I told brother Donnie I said
[44:36] I believe the Holy Spirit does that a
[44:38] lot of times where people can have a lot
[44:40] of things to argue about couldn't you
[44:43] see some old Theologian sitting there
[44:45] said he preached all that
[44:48] message and we can't figure out what
[44:50] he's talking about cuz it looks like
[44:53] you're born again here you're born again
[44:55] there you over here and over there and
[44:57] he said if he just went over there where
[44:59] it says
[45:00] stature well you know maybe God didn't
[45:02] want him to do
[45:05] that maybe he didn't want him to use
[45:07] that
[45:11] word you see church he was a prophet and
[45:14] thank God for it I know as a human being
[45:17] he made mistakes
[45:19] right we believe that we understand that
[45:21] there was mistakes the man made even in
[45:24] his teaching that God had to correct but
[45:28] you know what there wouldn't a man in
[45:30] the world could correct
[45:32] him Clarence Lin taught the white horse
[45:36] riders Antichrist for Brother brandom
[45:38] come
[45:40] along go back and read a little
[45:46] bit but he wouldn't have
[45:48] profit so that was still sealed until it
[45:51] broke to the
[45:53] prophet and he wasn't responsible just
[45:55] get to T see that's the way I I I
[45:57] believe it and that's why I want you to
[45:59] read what the prophet said even if I
[46:01] keep reading it over and over go ahead
[46:02] with a quote Brothers I'm
[46:04] sorry he's talking about what connection
[46:06] they ask him a question does Genesis 1
[46:08] 126 have to do with 27 where God it says
[46:12] God created two men all
[46:15] right then look what he
[46:17] says well now if you'll notice close now
[46:19] in Genesis
[46:21] 1:26 let's get the first part
[46:24] first God said let us now let us is a
[46:29] let us make man in our own
[46:32] image our course we realize he's talking
[46:35] to
[46:36] someone see then right there this
[46:38] people's minds gone you
[46:41] know was he a
[46:44] trinitarian he was speaking to another
[46:46] being you remember the one we gave the
[46:49] other day where he says to the
[46:50] animals R said God said to the animals
[46:54] let us make man you know the animals
[46:56] were made before the body of Adam was
[46:59] made but we'll get to it in the message
[47:01] out a while the soul of Adam was made
[47:05] before the physical man that's why I
[47:07] said you read five and six in your
[47:10] creation of that day and you read it you
[47:12] you got a problems right there and
[47:14] understanding you got to deal what he
[47:16] said he was speaking to another being
[47:18] let us make man in our own image that's
[47:20] Father and Son word and spirit no
[47:22] problem with us now right but there was
[47:24] a time we had a problem with
[47:27] that and maybe you still have a problem
[47:30] well I just keep saying it over and over
[47:31] so one of these days we'll get
[47:33] it you can't have two persons up there
[47:36] arguing with each other over how they
[47:37] going to make man amen that's right if
[47:40] you're going to believe in one true and
[47:42] living God right well he was really a
[47:45] trinitarian and he deceived you and I he
[47:48] done a good job because I still believe
[47:49] it let us make man and I were after a
[47:53] likeness and let them have dominion over
[47:55] the catle of of the field if you'll
[47:56] notice in creation the first thing that
[47:58] was created of course was
[48:01] light want you you come on down through
[48:04] the creation the last thing was created
[48:06] was what a man and a woman was made
[48:10] after the man all right the first last
[48:13] thing was created of God's creation is
[48:15] mankind well when God made his first man
[48:19] if you'll notice he made him in the
[48:21] likeness of himself he was made in the
[48:23] image of God and what is God
[48:26] now what you now if we can find out what
[48:29] God is we can find out what kind of a
[48:32] man he made all
[48:35] right but just turn that quote around a
[48:38] little bit and read it this way we find
[48:41] out what man is we can find out what God
[48:44] is because the man is to be made in the
[48:47] image of
[48:50] God is that something to be hard to
[48:54] comprehend just think of about
[48:56] it if you're made in the
[48:59] image and we proved over and over that
[49:02] that word image doesn't mean a picture
[49:04] taken or something to look like or or a
[49:09] cologne no it can't even be a cologne
[49:12] can't be a identical twin can't be none
[49:14] of those things when you say in the
[49:16] image of God that means whatever God was
[49:20] right that's the way he made the man or
[49:23] there's something wrong with our
[49:24] sensible understanding I'm trying to get
[49:27] away from saying stupid so
[49:29] much
[49:32] okay but Church
[49:35] listen to find out what kind of a what
[49:39] God is we can find out what kind of a
[49:42] man he
[49:47] made but see if we find out what kind of
[49:50] a man was
[49:51] made we can find out what God is and as
[49:55] I started off talking it's not that God
[49:58] had a
[50:00] soul you remember we went through that
[50:02] Sunday afternoon where brother Brandon
[50:04] would say he put a soul on him see
[50:06] everybody see there he didn't say he put
[50:08] it in him he put it on him it's just
[50:10] something he just put on him
[50:13] and
[50:16] well it must be something pretty real
[50:20] the soul of an individual because
[50:22] remember it cannot be destroyed
[50:26] by mankind that's right I don't care
[50:29] what you do with the body the spirit or
[50:30] whatever you do anything with it cannot
[50:33] be you can't destroy that Soul so the
[50:35] soul is the real you amen
[50:38] right all
[50:41] right well brother Dale how big is my
[50:43] soul cuz they found an in square
[50:45] compartment in the human heart remember
[50:48] he says they say that could be the place
[50:51] of the Soul he didn't say that was what
[50:53] it
[50:54] was he said that's what they
[50:59] say well see we want to put an in square
[51:03] compartment well what do you need an in
[51:05] square compartment
[51:10] for come on what do you need an inch
[51:12] square I'm a little bit bigger than some
[51:15] of y'all I might need an inch and high
[51:19] Square Aaron gets 4 in off the
[51:24] top
[51:29] okay do you see what I'm talking about
[51:32] yes you use in human
[51:34] terminology to try to speak about things
[51:38] well man automatically takes the human
[51:41] terminology and interprets what he wants
[51:43] to be said amen instead of listening
[51:47] from the heart he's listening from the
[51:51] head and he's comparing it with his
[51:54] spirit
[51:57] to see whether it works in his love this
[52:00] that or the other you know just remember
[52:03] brother Brown says you don't love with
[52:05] your
[52:07] body he said you love with your
[52:13] spirit you display it with your
[52:17] body you can't love with it has no no
[52:20] doing it see taste feels smell and here
[52:22] doesn't work too good all right but the
[52:25] find out what God is we just look back
[52:27] to the man that he made and we see that
[52:30] how God is real cuz he made something
[52:35] real right right all right then why
[52:39] can't we believe
[52:44] that look what I I love the way brother
[52:46] brandom will bring things and and it
[52:48] strikes me as a as things you know I I
[52:52] look at those things maybe you don't but
[52:54] when he says things I I look at it and I
[52:57] I think
[52:58] about man I wish I'd said
[53:02] that I think there ain't no way in the
[53:05] world theologians and things can come up
[53:08] with the wording that man come up with
[53:10] but yet to them it look so carnal look
[53:13] at this next quote I I I get Plum you
[53:16] know look at number two what he says on
[53:18] the message called look and he gets down
[53:21] life comes you know the confessions and
[53:23] things but just getting down to the
[53:24] quote
[53:26] part there is that life of God as a Son
[53:29] of God born by the blood of God and
[53:33] you're you're the same holy spirit that
[53:36] wrote this Bible will focus it right
[53:39] back into you there's not a denomination
[53:42] or a Creed that can do that only God
[53:45] himself can take a hold of the camera of
[53:49] your eyes
[53:51] am now how greater could
[53:54] that
[53:56] he's and let you see what God is and
[54:00] what his purpose amen that he can take
[54:04] the camera of your eyes now you know you
[54:08] can't see you know what he's doing he's
[54:09] walking back into the human being
[54:12] part he's getting back into the real you
[54:15] because the human eye is not
[54:17] seeing all right the spirit is reasoning
[54:21] memory conscious and things and can get
[54:24] that all out of focus
[54:26] but I had just to happen when time
[54:27] reading I know if you ever let it be
[54:30] that you could stand and look at
[54:32] somebody and walk back in
[54:36] yourself and see them as God was seeing
[54:40] that
[54:41] person it'll stop you playing
[54:45] around it'll stop your
[54:50] condemning boy I tell you what they need
[54:52] to get straightened up they go clean her
[54:55] around your own door
[54:56] first right but that happened one time
[54:59] and I thought oh God I saw that person
[55:02] as he was looking at him
[55:05] right through the blood of Jesus
[55:09] Christ that's how he was seeing
[55:12] him but now what's what we're talking
[55:15] about see we talk about God as a
[55:19] spirit but we read many quotes and many
[55:21] thoughts and points the prophet would
[55:23] say that he's a spiritual
[55:27] being God is a supernatural
[55:30] being that he's not like the
[55:34] wind he's not just blowing out this this
[55:38] everywhere and all he's omniscient he's
[55:43] omnipresent and we went through
[55:45] explaining those things the only way he
[55:46] could be omnipresent was to be
[55:49] omniscient all right because he's a
[55:52] being
[55:54] right
[55:56] and the brother brandom was the one that
[55:58] said it he saidh would God be in the
[56:01] garden saying Adam Adam Where Art Thou
[56:04] when God created every Speck of dirt
[56:08] every tree everything that was in that
[56:11] Garden
[56:15] right I told you I said some of these
[56:17] days I'm going to preach on God with
[56:20] amnesia you know
[56:23] what now here's God standing in the
[56:26] garden he knows every move everything
[56:28] that's there but yet he's hunting
[56:31] atam oh he just done that to
[56:35] show well your prophets wouldn't said it
[56:38] I
[56:39] didn't he said God come down looking for
[56:42] Adam and he said Adam Adam Where Art
[56:44] Thou
[56:46] right now you explain you say well I
[56:49] just can't explain that well you explain
[56:50] how your sins can be put in the sea of
[56:53] forgetfulness and we'll talk
[56:57] an eternal God that cannot never stop I
[57:00] mean his thoughts are beyond our
[57:02] thoughts or anything but yet he can
[57:04] annihilate our sin and they're gone in
[57:06] the sea of forgetfulness and cannot be
[57:08] brought up by the
[57:10] devil you explain that when we don't
[57:13] have no problem explaining the
[57:15] others but you see church that's just
[57:17] what I'm what I'm trying to get us to
[57:20] see he's a supernatural being he's not
[57:23] like the wind
[57:25] he is all of those great things a
[57:27] prophet would use Father Son and Holy
[57:29] Ghost theophany logos speech all of the
[57:32] great uh things of talking about him the
[57:36] L of the valley the rose of Sharon the
[57:38] bright and Morning Star all of those
[57:40] things but yet he's a
[57:44] person and brother Rand you remember we
[57:46] gave it off of paragraph 78 of the I I
[57:49] don't give this to them but the
[57:51] unveiling of God where he said he's not
[57:54] the first person or the second person I
[57:56] not the second person or third person he
[57:58] said he's not the first person he said
[58:01] he is the person right now why would he
[58:05] emphasize that he's not the first person
[58:08] CU if you got a first person you could
[58:09] did a little a little bit to talk about
[58:11] a second person so he put it in plain
[58:13] language am that Theologian just go but
[58:17] Haywire sitting there listening to
[58:19] it well he says he's not the third he's
[58:22] not the second he's the third he's not
[58:23] even the first he is the person what I
[58:27] mean to me that's the way he's
[58:29] condescending to reveal
[58:31] himself that Blinds To man's ideas right
[58:35] that comes to the right order and then
[58:38] that Prophet could look down through and
[58:40] see what God could see of what we
[58:43] talking about the camera of your eyes
[58:46] and look through and see by the
[58:48] supernatural eye of Revelation may we
[58:52] say it that way where you'll understand
[58:54] what he's talking talking
[58:56] about when he said we're looking by the
[58:59] eye of
[59:01] Faith he said not the natural eyesight
[59:03] of the thing we're looking at the
[59:06] supernatural by Supernatural thing what
[59:09] by
[59:13] Revelation you ever noticed this one
[59:15] that brother R made it really you know
[59:17] it didn't throw me but it really throwed
[59:19] me in a
[59:20] light he said you know how these
[59:22] discernments and things work he said
[59:24] said it's
[59:26] Revelation you ever noticed that it's
[59:31] Revelation how did he know what house
[59:34] number the people lived at or whatever
[59:35] you say he's seen it out there well why
[59:37] did he have to see it out there he can
[59:38] see it by
[59:39] Revelation I ain't saying he didn't see
[59:41] it out there I'm just saying why can't
[59:42] you talk by
[59:45] Revelation by the eye of Faith by
[59:47] Revelation because I said to start with
[59:50] the human body can't comprehend what the
[59:53] Bible is saying the spirit will reason
[59:56] upon those things and it it just gets it
[59:58] all that's where your confusion is at
[1:00:02] there's no confusion in the
[1:00:04] soul it's either confused or it's of God
[1:00:07] because there's only one nature of that
[1:00:09] Soul you're either born again or you're
[1:00:11] not if you're not born again the prophet
[1:00:14] said souls in prison if you're born
[1:00:16] again the nature of your soul is God he
[1:00:18] said but if you're not born again the
[1:00:20] nature of your soul is of the devil or
[1:00:22] the world all right simple point of just
[1:00:26] looking at it what do you see about
[1:00:31] God well brother D I just I just used to
[1:00:34] think he was just this yeah you used to
[1:00:36] think he was just a
[1:00:42] spirit but now remember these statements
[1:00:45] and you might not like them a spirit
[1:00:47] can't heal
[1:00:48] you
[1:00:51] right a spirit can't save you
[1:00:55] right
[1:00:56] right as
[1:00:58] father and if that was as far as he went
[1:01:01] which would have meant
[1:01:03] creation to bring us into
[1:01:05] being that would have been
[1:01:08] great but he couldn't be a Healer he
[1:01:11] couldn't be a
[1:01:16] savior I hope it's doning on you a
[1:01:18] little bit the reality that I see of a
[1:01:21] living
[1:01:23] God
[1:01:28] that he's
[1:01:30] real he's not just a thoughts of your
[1:01:36] mind he's real
[1:01:39] amen Jesus said if you've seen
[1:01:43] me he said you've seen the
[1:01:46] father no he he just he wasn't talking
[1:01:50] about see this thing he was saying if
[1:01:54] you could could look through but there
[1:01:56] was no way that man could look through
[1:01:59] and see God standing there until the day
[1:02:01] of
[1:02:03] Pentecost that's right that's right but
[1:02:06] when the day of Pentecost come he knew
[1:02:07] what Jesus said right
[1:02:12] right you see what I'm getting at
[1:02:17] yes we covered in in great length or
[1:02:20] have been
[1:02:21] covered that the kind of man that God
[1:02:29] created was created in the image of
[1:02:34] God
[1:02:35] now we try to deal with that as a point
[1:02:39] of looking at
[1:02:41] created I keep going back on that
[1:02:43] because maybe it's in my mind all
[1:02:46] right but we look at things that's
[1:02:52] created you know something that had a
[1:02:57] beginning
[1:02:59] right
[1:03:00] well when we go on down into another
[1:03:03] quote in a minute to where the Prophet
[1:03:05] said your souls was made before the
[1:03:07] foundation of the
[1:03:12] world we need to get away from that
[1:03:15] created
[1:03:16] idea he's the beginning of the creation
[1:03:18] of God according to the revelations 3:14
[1:03:22] right well you know what that makes
[1:03:24] people think God created Jesus and Jesus
[1:03:27] created everything else I read you the
[1:03:29] quote from
[1:03:33] it can't
[1:03:37] believe can't believe right see we get
[1:03:41] it all figured
[1:03:45] out and I face this one every time I say
[1:03:48] it I'm going to say it again but I
[1:03:50] remember I'm talking about your spirit
[1:03:52] because but the time I ask you the
[1:03:55] question about when did the Son of God
[1:03:57] come into being you answered 2,000 years
[1:04:02] ago now your spirit right now is
[1:04:04] rebelling because you don't like for me
[1:04:06] to bring that out but how come you mean
[1:04:09] if I saved your soul from hell you
[1:04:11] wouldn't love
[1:04:16] me I don't I don't get
[1:04:22] that but you see we know that the Son of
[1:04:25] God was
[1:04:32] Creator
[1:04:36] right we see when we talk about
[1:04:41] creation we always want to talk about
[1:04:43] something with a
[1:04:47] beginning but see how could he be the
[1:04:49] beginning of the creation of God and be
[1:04:53] eternal
[1:05:01] but you see to look back and see it as
[1:05:03] not a
[1:05:07] creation we want to look at the
[1:05:10] world and it had a time it started
[1:05:15] right we want to look at man and had a
[1:05:18] time it started that's right all
[1:05:21] right but what about going back into
[1:05:25] God's
[1:05:26] mind until where we're dealing with
[1:05:29] Supernatural
[1:05:30] things and then we want to talk about
[1:05:36] creation see then if God created
[1:05:40] Jesus and the Bible says that Jesus is
[1:05:44] the
[1:05:45] creator right that true Colossians 1
[1:05:48] John 1 Hebrews 1 James 3 I mean
[1:05:52] Ephesians 3 and9
[1:05:55] Revelations
[1:06:00] 4 then see our mind is hooked on
[1:06:02] creation as some form of a
[1:06:09] beginning when Christ never had a
[1:06:11] beginning that's
[1:06:15] right the L go the speech the
[1:06:18] theophanies the things that we use they
[1:06:20] never had a
[1:06:21] beginning right
[1:06:27] they were just God in another form
[1:06:29] that's
[1:06:31] right and then see I say that that those
[1:06:35] attributes was in him he wasn't no
[1:06:38] savior till he come into the world I've
[1:06:41] got a little sense whether you believe
[1:06:44] it or not I can think
[1:06:51] sometimes but when I say attribute that
[1:06:54] he had the attribute of healer then he
[1:06:56] had that in the
[1:06:58] beginning or he gained it when he got
[1:07:00] over
[1:07:06] here you got a
[1:07:09] problem whether you know it or not you
[1:07:11] got a vast problem I'm speaking to the
[1:07:13] spiritual Mind of a lot of people's mind
[1:07:20] mankind then the logos that came out of
[1:07:23] God would being a second
[1:07:29] person the Son of God that came out of
[1:07:32] God would be a second person like you're
[1:07:34] saying and you're right exactly where
[1:07:36] your trinitarian Concepts come from
[1:07:38] that's
[1:07:44] right then Jesus would have been lying
[1:07:47] when he said I and my father are
[1:07:52] one
[1:07:56] he's saying what I am the father made
[1:08:00] manifest that's right wasn't that what
[1:08:03] he was just saying
[1:08:08] believe we see looking at what God made
[1:08:11] we can see God looking at at what he
[1:08:15] made we can see God looking at at God
[1:08:17] and we can see what he made right or
[1:08:21] else we're going to have to change the
[1:08:22] scripture where it says in the image
[1:08:26] well see we want to make the image
[1:08:28] another
[1:08:34] likeness but that lust that theophany
[1:08:37] that Son of God that came out of God in
[1:08:40] the beginning wasn't another person
[1:08:42] that's
[1:08:43] right
[1:08:45] right it was the same person in another
[1:08:48] form that's
[1:08:52] right what do you believe about God I
[1:08:55] thought there was only one eternal life
[1:08:57] right now would you like this quote you
[1:08:59] know brother R said there's no such
[1:09:00] thing as two forms of eternal
[1:09:02] life you need that one I'll be glad to
[1:09:05] get it for
[1:09:07] you there's no such thing as two
[1:09:14] eternities it can't
[1:09:17] be there's one
[1:09:20] Eternal somebody remind me to pull that
[1:09:22] up with a computer bro joke can pull it
[1:09:24] up just put it in there brother Joe and
[1:09:25] then you can shoot it up on the screen
[1:09:28] that there's no such thing as two
[1:09:30] eternities maybe that's not the wording
[1:09:32] exactly so they'll have trouble trying
[1:09:33] to find it but
[1:09:37] listen so we're getting down then to
[1:09:41] where that I want to do a lot of reading
[1:09:44] so don't worry on that you can on your
[1:09:47] own but for those on running the screen
[1:09:50] pull up number
[1:09:52] three see
[1:09:54] I sat
[1:09:57] down and I read these
[1:10:00] things and I thank
[1:10:04] God there was no
[1:10:08] way for us human smart
[1:10:11] elic intellectual
[1:10:13] Giants there's no
[1:10:18] Theologian can
[1:10:20] talk of the Simplicity that a child a
[1:10:24] can understand what God is talking
[1:10:29] about by way of a
[1:10:35] prophet there's just no
[1:10:38] way look what he starts here on
[1:10:40] questions and answers it's why I ask you
[1:10:42] to listen to that message or read it I'd
[1:10:44] suggest you just keep on reading
[1:10:46] it and the one who is God there's
[1:10:50] another one on that to do and before the
[1:10:52] next week next next week or week after
[1:10:54] next sometime read who is this male
[1:10:58] jesic you know brother Al once's real
[1:11:02] good about it he called me he said what
[1:11:03] should I read next what can I read
[1:11:06] That's related to the message and I'll
[1:11:09] tell him in advance what
[1:11:11] I'm I said this go to who is this m
[1:11:15] chassid you know go we'll get there
[1:11:18] eventually but look what he starts off
[1:11:20] talking about this is paragraph 21 and
[1:11:22] it will go through paragraph 32 or 33 so
[1:11:26] forgive
[1:11:27] me I just like for you to see what he
[1:11:30] says you know that a lot of people never
[1:11:36] read you know that I say something to
[1:11:38] you and you'll say I remember one person
[1:11:41] said I sat there and said brother Dale
[1:11:43] says so and so and said I say no way in
[1:11:46] the world brother R didn't say that he
[1:11:48] said in just a minute he flighted it up
[1:11:50] on the screen and there he reads
[1:11:52] it
[1:11:56] I just want you to see how simple a man
[1:11:58] can talk but yet the greatest Revelation
[1:12:02] could ever be right and look where it's
[1:12:05] at back in
[1:12:10] 53 and look at
[1:12:13] him now if God created man in his own
[1:12:16] image and his likess now this is one
[1:12:19] we've read a lot right but we didn't
[1:12:21] keep on reading we've read this quote
[1:12:24] right here about five times already all
[1:12:27] right what kind of a man did he create a
[1:12:29] spirit man now if you'll notice after he
[1:12:32] had made all the creation and created
[1:12:34] and created a spirit man the close
[1:12:36] reading to the one that asked the
[1:12:37] question that God give dominion to the
[1:12:40] cattle and the fishes and everything to
[1:12:42] the man who the spirit man now not the
[1:12:44] flesh I mean the flesh man not the
[1:12:46] spirit
[1:12:47] man let me get it right he gave the the
[1:12:50] control of the animals to the spirit man
[1:12:52] the flesh man inherits that by the way
[1:12:55] he stepped within him that's what I was
[1:12:57] trying to get to the point stumble over
[1:12:59] it to get the right
[1:13:02] answer he gave Dominion of the cattle
[1:13:05] and the fishes and everything to the
[1:13:07] man but in his making up there he made
[1:13:11] man in his own image to lead the cattle
[1:13:14] lead the Beast of the field just like
[1:13:16] the Holy Spirit leads a Believer today
[1:13:18] see he was in other words Adam the first
[1:13:21] man in the lower creations of God the
[1:13:24] first creation was God himself see that
[1:13:26] just blows our mind if you don't have
[1:13:29] Revelation I'm
[1:13:32] sorry I'm talking to your soul I ain't
[1:13:35] talking to your body or your spirit you
[1:13:37] can't take your body and spirit and
[1:13:38] figure that quote out
[1:13:42] right it's got to be revealed right
[1:13:46] right and I can't do that the Holy Ghost
[1:13:49] page 40 is it 45 uh Christ of Myster God
[1:13:53] reveal it's either that or future home
[1:13:55] 45 that the Holy Ghost is the only
[1:13:57] revealer of the word that's right all
[1:13:59] right but watch the first creation was
[1:14:02] God himself then out of God came the
[1:14:04] Loos which was the son of
[1:14:06] God back before the world then out of
[1:14:09] the L God which was the word now watch
[1:14:12] in the beginning was the word the word
[1:14:14] was with God and the Word was God and
[1:14:16] the Word was made flesh and dwelt among
[1:14:17] us we bring that quote and we got
[1:14:21] there's quotes for it but we bring that
[1:14:23] thought of in the beginning as to bring
[1:14:26] it down to be Genesis
[1:14:32] 1:1
[1:14:33] right go that's as far as we can go back
[1:14:36] in the beginning was the
[1:14:38] word but now he's back up in
[1:14:41] eternity talking
[1:14:44] about God and how that things are to be
[1:14:47] unfolded or is condescending
[1:14:50] downward and he's using John 1
[1:14:55] cuzz
[1:14:56] remember you better get John 1 because I
[1:15:00] believe the John 1:1 is in the beginning
[1:15:04] was the word the word is with God and
[1:15:05] the Word was God and verse 14 is where
[1:15:07] you get in the word was made flesh in
[1:15:09] between there and it says and all things
[1:15:11] were created by Him who the
[1:15:16] word so it had to be back
[1:15:18] there all right but look look what he
[1:15:23] say says oh I got a beautiful picture in
[1:15:25] my mind
[1:15:28] now we'll read this and quit okay let's
[1:15:30] go back a 100 million years before there
[1:15:33] was ever a was a star moon or anything
[1:15:36] in the world now there was a time when
[1:15:38] there wasn't nothing here it was just
[1:15:41] all forever and Eternity and all of ever
[1:15:45] and Eternity was God he was D in the
[1:15:51] beginning well let's go out let's go out
[1:15:54] here on the edge of this banister and
[1:15:56] look over and see these things
[1:15:59] happen now no man has seen the father at
[1:16:02] any time wrote it up a little where
[1:16:04] everybody can get it watch now no man
[1:16:09] can see God in the bodily
[1:16:12] form there's no problem with that is
[1:16:15] there because God is not in bodily
[1:16:19] form you can't look back there and see a
[1:16:22] 16 element person standing before the
[1:16:24] foundation of the
[1:16:25] world you know what I mean body read it
[1:16:29] with sense
[1:16:31] right CU look what he gets on all right
[1:16:34] no man has seen the father but the only
[1:16:36] begotten of the father had declared him
[1:16:39] John 1 John right but now notice now
[1:16:42] there's nothing there is just space
[1:16:44] there's no light there's no dark there's
[1:16:47] no nothing it just seems nothing but in
[1:16:51] there is a great Supernatural being
[1:16:54] Jehovah God who covered all space of all
[1:16:57] places at all times he was from
[1:16:59] Everlasting from
[1:17:02] Everlasting he is the beginning of
[1:17:05] creation that's God can't see nothing
[1:17:08] can't hear nothing not a move of of an
[1:17:11] atom in the air not nothing not no a no
[1:17:15] nothing but yet God was there that was
[1:17:18] God now let's watch for a few minutes
[1:17:21] and after a while no man has seen
[1:17:24] that now that's the father that's God
[1:17:28] the father because you can't see God the
[1:17:35] father right you can only see him by
[1:17:37] Revelation remember
[1:17:39] Peter you've seen me you've seen the
[1:17:41] father Peter's looking there and said
[1:17:44] uhuh I might have been able to speak to
[1:17:46] you a little bit about you by being the
[1:17:48] Christ but you sure got me confused now
[1:17:51] now notice and after a while begin to
[1:17:53] see a little sacred light begin to form
[1:17:56] like a little Halo or something you can
[1:17:58] only see it by spiritual
[1:18:01] eyes to look or what the
[1:18:04] camera the quote the
[1:18:06] camera now while we're looking the whole
[1:18:09] church now we're standing on a great big
[1:18:11] banister watching what God's doing and
[1:18:13] we'll get right down to this question
[1:18:15] here and you'll see how he brings it in
[1:18:19] now no one has seen God and now the next
[1:18:22] thing we begin to see by eyes of
[1:18:24] Supernatural looking we see a little
[1:18:26] white light forming out there what is
[1:18:29] that that was called by Bible readers
[1:18:32] logos or the anointing or the anointing
[1:18:36] or as I was going to say the the part of
[1:18:39] God begin to form begin to develop into
[1:18:42] something so human beings could have
[1:18:45] some type of an idea you remember we put
[1:18:48] a couple of messages on part of
[1:18:51] God Heart Of God arm no no it ain't that
[1:18:55] it's
[1:18:57] terminologies all
[1:19:00] right now God gave oh excuse me little
[1:19:04] white light moving and he said any type
[1:19:06] of idea what it was begin to develop
[1:19:09] that was the word of God now God gave
[1:19:11] himself birth to his to this
[1:19:14] son which was before there was ever even
[1:19:17] an adom in the or a to make an adom that
[1:19:22] was see Jes Jesus said glorify me father
[1:19:25] with the glory that we had before the
[1:19:28] foundation of the world see way back in
[1:19:31] Yonder Son of
[1:19:34] God not two people remember the son is
[1:19:37] the father made
[1:19:39] manifest in another form all right now
[1:19:43] in St John 1 he said in the beginning
[1:19:46] was the word when the first and the Word
[1:19:49] was was God and the Word was made flesh
[1:19:52] and dwelt Among Us God unfolding himself
[1:19:54] down to a human being now now watch what
[1:19:58] he watch how he did it now back there
[1:20:01] then when this little Halo comes now you
[1:20:05] can see nothing yet but just by eyes of
[1:20:08] just Supernatural we see a Halo standing
[1:20:11] there now that's the Son of God the
[1:20:14] logos now I can see him playing around
[1:20:18] like a little child before the father's
[1:20:20] door with all eternity
[1:20:24] and now and then in his imaginary
[1:20:27] makeup he be to think of what things
[1:20:30] would
[1:20:31] be and I can hear him
[1:20:33] say who the
[1:20:36] son
[1:20:38] right I can hear him say Let There Be
[1:20:42] and when he did an Adam burst and the
[1:20:44] sun came into existence she s for
[1:20:46] hundreds of millions of years forming
[1:20:48] clinkers and burning and forming like it
[1:20:50] is today still burning still breaking
[1:20:53] Adams think about
[1:20:55] it think about this great person that
[1:20:58] we're talking about and that how back
[1:21:01] before the world ever begun
[1:21:06] whatsoever we can find that word Son of
[1:21:10] God but that means trinitarianism is
[1:21:15] Right CU you got to have father son Holy
[1:21:17] Ghost that's
[1:21:21] threee
[1:21:25] not if the son is the same person in
[1:21:28] another form right now you got your one
[1:21:32] God Doctrine correct without going now
[1:21:35] remember how we kept bringing it out the
[1:21:38] one the trinitarian doctrine says a
[1:21:40] three so they like to quote like that
[1:21:43] that here's the father and here's the
[1:21:45] son and here's the Holy
[1:21:48] Ghost but they don't like when it says
[1:21:51] and these three are one
[1:21:54] well three are
[1:21:58] one it can't be
[1:22:02] explained right ain't that what
[1:22:05] everybody says it can't be
[1:22:08] explained now what you're saying is I
[1:22:11] can't explain it but you ain't going to
[1:22:13] say that so you're going to say it can't
[1:22:15] be
[1:22:20] explained you remember the big man that
[1:22:22] said that years ago and I told you about
[1:22:24] it I said but the only one problem was I
[1:22:26] don't believe him he said it can't be
[1:22:29] explained the Trinity can't be explained
[1:22:32] he could no way he could explain
[1:22:34] it but if he just sat down and listen to
[1:22:37] brother brandom for a little bit of
[1:22:39] course he wouldn't have been what he was
[1:22:40] you know all right but now watch watch
[1:22:45] the point like a child playing before
[1:22:48] the father's
[1:22:50] door that's not two people
[1:22:56] but look it's not trinitarianism
[1:22:59] right but now if you go the other way
[1:23:02] you've went into
[1:23:03] Oneness when you're just taking the one
[1:23:06] like that the one like that you're doing
[1:23:07] it you you've got the problem with the
[1:23:11] all God was he poured in and you got the
[1:23:14] empty place to come over I spent time
[1:23:18] trying to explain that to
[1:23:19] you did it help you any and all Christy
[1:23:23] pours in the church and you ain't got no
[1:23:25] father you ain't got no Christ you ain't
[1:23:27] got nothing but the
[1:23:31] church but you see you've got to keep
[1:23:33] this
[1:23:34] thing to where that they can always be
[1:23:39] Father Son and Holy
[1:23:42] Ghost as being
[1:23:47] one but the problem in our human mind is
[1:23:51] we're one
[1:23:53] see father son Holy
[1:23:58] Ghost well on the River Jordan the one
[1:24:00] that everybody likes to talk about you
[1:24:02] know I mean the river where he was
[1:24:05] baptized where it come down you know and
[1:24:07] here's the son and here's the holy ghost
[1:24:10] coming down like a dove and voice from
[1:24:13] Heaven see that's
[1:24:18] scripture but that don't prove
[1:24:20] trinitarianism that's right that proves
[1:24:23] true one God because if you was a
[1:24:25] Oneness you couldn't have that
[1:24:29] example are you listening give me about
[1:24:32] two minutes you couldn't have that
[1:24:35] example if you're just a
[1:24:37] Oneness cuz oness means all this goes
[1:24:40] over into here and all this goes over
[1:24:41] into here one like your
[1:24:45] finger or only as Jesus was the life
[1:24:48] form of
[1:24:50] God and that's contrary to scripture cuz
[1:24:53] the Holy Ghost came on the day of
[1:24:55] Pentecost as a form of
[1:24:59] God so know you're
[1:25:01] wrong you see why you can be just as
[1:25:04] wrong on wondess as you can be on
[1:25:08] Trinity I don't have any problem with a
[1:25:10] father and son talking to each
[1:25:14] other I talk to him I think I'm a child
[1:25:18] of God and I talk to my father don't you
[1:25:21] yes right well where's he
[1:25:24] at I don't have to holler to get him
[1:25:27] down but I will remember what Billy Paul
[1:25:29] said his daddy told him one day he said
[1:25:32] he come in he would late getting to the
[1:25:33] meal to eat you know now this is what he
[1:25:35] said so not have called his name but
[1:25:37] that's all
[1:25:38] right he said he bowed his head and said
[1:25:41] his bir said he dad looked over at him
[1:25:43] and
[1:25:44] said Billy do you believe God heard
[1:25:49] you he said yeah he said I didn't hear
[1:25:56] you
[1:25:59] well do we have to scream out loud for
[1:26:01] God to be able to hear us he's not
[1:26:06] deaf no I can whisper to him in the
[1:26:08] night can't you but I still like to
[1:26:11] raise my voice because the Bible does
[1:26:14] say about the prophet in the days of the
[1:26:17] voice of the seventh angel it doesn't
[1:26:20] say in the whisper or the
[1:26:23] thought right it says in the
[1:26:27] voice of the seventh
[1:26:30] angel the Bible says that the children
[1:26:33] spake often one to
[1:26:38] another
[1:26:40] they or give a thought
[1:26:44] transplant did you get
[1:26:48] it said they spake often one to another
[1:26:51] and said a book book of remembrance was
[1:26:54] written what what they talking
[1:26:57] about
[1:27:00] right you see that way you're not
[1:27:02] trinitarian you're not a
[1:27:06] Oneness you've got it down to the right
[1:27:09] place to see God like he
[1:27:13] is he's real

[1:27:19] has a need let's stand together we just
[1:27:21] won't have no singing this 5 minutes
