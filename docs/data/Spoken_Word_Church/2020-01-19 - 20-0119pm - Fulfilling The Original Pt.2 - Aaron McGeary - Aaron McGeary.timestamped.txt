[20:41] I want to see you hey man praise the
[20:54] Lord well let's just jump right back in
[20:56] the word
[20:56] I've enjoyed the worship we could turn
[20:58] our Bibles to Genesis chapter 1 I'll
[21:03] read verses 27 28 and then we'll skip to
[21:05] chapter 3 it's been a great privilege to
[21:08] be with you this weekend we appreciate
[21:11] the invitation from brother Samuel your
[21:13] pastor and also it came by way of
[21:16] brother Wade so we appreciate the
[21:17] opportunity to be here on the fellowship
[21:19] weekend it was nice being together
[21:20] yesterday and the fellowship with the
[21:23] other churches and and then also to have
[21:25] the services with the home church today
[21:27] it's been a great blessing we appreciate
[21:29] it very much we pray that God would
[21:30] bless you all tremendously as we brought
[21:33] greetings from our home church there in
[21:34] Hickory you can always work your way up
[21:36] north and come visit us sometime
[21:39] and I know we'd be blessed to see you
[21:42] Genesis chapter the 1 verse 27 says so
[21:46] God created man in his own image and the
[21:48] image of God created he him male and
[21:51] female created he them and God blessed
[21:54] them and God said unto them be fruitful
[21:57] and multiply and replenish the earth and
[21:59] subdue it and have dominion over the
[22:01] fish of the sea and over the fowl of the
[22:03] air and over every living thing that
[22:06] moveth upon the earth so this is a
[22:09] commandment given to them male and
[22:11] female even though the female had not
[22:13] yet had expression in her own flesh or
[22:16] the flesh of Adam but yet independently
[22:18] they're outside of him it's still a
[22:20] commandment to them and then I'd like to
[22:22] just read one place genesis 3:15 and
[22:25] this is after the fall and this is god
[22:28] speaking a curse to the serpent he says
[22:31] an output enmity between thee and the
[22:34] woman between thy seed and her seed it
[22:37] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[22:40] bruise his heel so he knew there'd be a
[22:42] child even Satan knew there'd be a son
[22:45] come forth that would crush his head so
[22:48] he was always looking for that son to
[22:49] come let's just pray if we could a
[22:51] gracious Heavenly Father thank you for
[22:53] this opportunity we have
[22:54] afternoon being gathered back together
[22:57] Lord it's nice to come quickly back
[22:59] together it doesn't give the world time
[23:01] to intervene and get into our thoughts
[23:03] and separate us from what we spoke on
[23:05] this morning and what we enjoyed
[23:07] together as a family this morning so
[23:09] Lord we pray that you would just ready
[23:10] our minds and our bodies Lord keeping us
[23:12] attentive to receive from you yet again
[23:14] we believe this is your divine purpose
[23:17] for us to come together feast at your
[23:20] table and though I would just be a human
[23:23] man with my own weaknesses and
[23:24] shortcomings Lord I believe that you can
[23:26] take a gift that you've given Lord for
[23:28] your people say can use it today to
[23:30] bless them and strengthen them and
[23:31] benefit them so we pray that you would
[23:33] do so and the name Lord Jesus Christ we
[23:35] pray amen may be seated just keep going
[23:40] right where we were this morning on
[23:41] fulfilling the original looking at God
[23:44] the finishing of God's purpose for the
[23:47] original creation and some of it to see
[23:50] here the outset might be picking back
[23:52] some of the same things we've discussed
[23:54] this morning but brother BAM talked
[23:55] about the three-fold purpose of God that
[23:57] was manifested in Adam and Eve so in
[24:00] Adam and the woman there was his
[24:03] three-fold purpose was hidden in them
[24:04] and it was manifested in them and takes
[24:07] a revelation to see the mystery that was
[24:09] being manifested in them and we're
[24:11] really looking at and emphasizing how
[24:13] the bride is fulfilling the original
[24:15] that she is completing her part in this
[24:17] threefold purpose of God we're taking
[24:20] our inspiration from the statement where
[24:22] Bram said there was Adam and Eve walking
[24:25] in the Garden of Eden every seed
[24:27] bringing forth and so these are the
[24:29] elements Adam and the woman walking
[24:31] together in the garden every seed
[24:33] bringing forth he said it could never do
[24:35] nothing else it never could do nothing
[24:37] else because God said let it be that way
[24:39] it had to be that way
[24:41] says all how I'd like to stop here just
[24:43] a minute to say there is where we are
[24:45] facing yet the completion of that word
[24:49] the completion of what Adam and the
[24:51] woman walking in the garden every seed
[24:53] bringing forth we're facing the
[24:55] completion of that and it has to come to
[24:58] completion because God said let it let
[24:59] their be God said it was to be a certain
[25:01] way and it has to come to completion and
[25:04] so when brother Branham says we're
[25:06] coming to the completion of that
[25:07] word there was something that Adam and
[25:10] Eve did not finish Adam and the woman
[25:12] walking in the garden every seed
[25:13] bringing forth of its kind there was
[25:15] something that was left unfinished and
[25:17] so we're just looking at that word where
[25:19] Bret says we're facing the completion of
[25:21] that word we're just looking at that
[25:23] word to understand what it is that's
[25:25] being fulfilled in this hour what is it
[25:27] that's being finished today what is it
[25:28] that's being completed so we could fully
[25:30] yield ourselves to that purpose and so
[25:33] Adam and the woman in Eden he says
[25:36] walking in the Garden of Eden they were
[25:37] under a command and that command was
[25:40] Genesis 1:28 and it was connected with
[25:42] the law of reproduction which is in
[25:44] Genesis 111 and that's where is that let
[25:47] each seed bring forth of its kind so as
[25:49] God gave in Genesis 111 a commandment
[25:52] for every seed to bring forth of its
[25:54] kind this is similar to the commandment
[25:56] that's given to man and the woman that
[25:58] they would multiply and replenish the
[26:00] earth that they would be fruitful so
[26:02] there to bring forth also of their kind
[26:04] so he says and God blessed them and God
[26:06] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[26:08] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[26:11] and have dominion over the fish of the
[26:13] sea and over the fowl of the air and
[26:15] over every living thing that moveth upon
[26:17] the earth so this puts man and the woman
[26:20] in the image of God over Dominion with
[26:22] the domain and so you could see how that
[26:25] man now is is it's being described it's
[26:28] gonna be reflection of God in heaven
[26:30] what he desired from the very beginning
[26:32] so everything's in perfect harmony and
[26:35] the man and the woman were to be in this
[26:37] beautiful garden this is the unfolding
[26:39] of God's great masterpiece brother Aaron
[26:41] called it his picture unfolding all the
[26:43] time and so Genesis 1:28 that's
[26:46] according to God's law of reproduction
[26:48] in Genesis 111 where you bring forth of
[26:50] each kind that's a species reproduced by
[26:53] a sip the same seed and so as mankind
[26:57] was placed under this commandment and I
[27:00] and not nothing I'm saying today am I
[27:03] saying it because I don't think you know
[27:04] this it might kind of be a cheap trick
[27:07] I'm saying it because I know you know it
[27:08] and when you already know it you get
[27:10] more a man's as a preacher
[27:12] when you preach something everybody
[27:14] already knows you usually get a little
[27:15] bit more amens that's why I don't
[27:17] understand some of these guys I just try
[27:18] to make stuff up my man stay with what
[27:20] brother branham said that way you get
[27:22] more amens and so that's what we're
[27:25] gonna do just stay right in the channel
[27:26] that you guys already know so Genesis
[27:31] 2:18 he says and the Lord God said it is
[27:35] not good that the man should be alone I
[27:37] will make him a help meet for him
[27:40] because mankind in Genesis 1:28 is
[27:42] Commission he's commanded be fruitful
[27:44] multiply and replenish and so God now he
[27:48] said looks at mankind he says it's not
[27:50] good so first time God says something's
[27:52] not good as he created in these days
[27:54] finished it's good it's good it's good
[27:56] it's good very good
[27:57] and he says it's not good why because it
[28:00] wasn't good for man to be alone he says
[28:03] I will make him a help meet for him
[28:06] what because the expression of God was
[28:08] not complete God could see in Adam
[28:11] himself and so he could say well here's
[28:13] Adam and he exists
[28:15] he's existing by himself with the domain
[28:17] in a Dominion but God wasn't satisfied
[28:19] just being God with those worshiping him
[28:21] and a domain in that supernatural realm
[28:24] that spiritual realm he wanted to have a
[28:26] bride of his choosing
[28:28] so his he had evolved to this point
[28:31] where now Adam is a reflection of the
[28:33] highest in heaven this invisible realm
[28:35] there the spiritual realm is
[28:36] supernatural realm now Adam in a
[28:38] physical realm I've heard their
[28:40] expression now just coming down and God
[28:42] says well there I am so he sees an Adam
[28:45] himself he says I don't want him to be
[28:47] alone I'll make a help meet for him and
[28:50] brother branham catches this very
[28:52] principal masterpiece he says when he
[28:55] made this man there was something about
[28:57] him yet that didn't look just right
[28:58] because that he was by himself and
[29:01] that's how God had been by himself so
[29:04] that's why it did look right God wasn't
[29:06] just happy being the highest in heaven
[29:08] with angels worshipping him he wanted to
[29:10] have a bride that could reign with him a
[29:12] bride of his choosing so he wasn't happy
[29:14] to leave Adam at that expression he was
[29:17] the eternal and man now in the image of
[29:19] God also existed on earth by himself so
[29:22] he must have struck a little blow over
[29:24] on his left side and from there he took
[29:25] a piece
[29:26] that struck off of it and made him a
[29:28] helpmate a wife then he wasn't by
[29:31] himself he had somebody with him and
[29:33] that's his great work and that beautiful
[29:38] I'm brother Brown in places this woman
[29:39] that came from men brought forth for man
[29:42] and all the substance the woman had was
[29:44] originally in the man so you see that
[29:46] God is foreshadowing the bride there was
[29:48] nothing she had that came from anything
[29:50] else but Adam himself and so Nana at now
[29:54] Adam and the woman they are a further
[29:57] expression of God Adam was in the image
[30:00] of God now now Adams wife the woman she
[30:03] is an expression of something that was
[30:05] hidden in Adam and now she becomes a
[30:07] further revelation of a mystery that was
[30:09] hidden Adam and it's only Pro trained
[30:11] what is in gone because there's a
[30:13] mystery in the back part of God mind
[30:15] that he's going to achieve through
[30:16] thousands of years and wants to bring
[30:18] into view so the picture of God is
[30:20] becoming more complete this portrait
[30:23] God's family portrait is coming into
[30:25] view and so in Genesis chapter 2 verse
[30:28] 22 and and I didn't go back and read
[30:31] over these scriptures because I feel
[30:32] were just picking right back up from
[30:34] this morning it says in the rib which
[30:36] the Lord God had taken from man made he
[30:39] a woman and brought her unto the man and
[30:42] brother man many references this
[30:44] scripture says he is showing portraying
[30:46] here the bride so according to our
[30:49] prophet Genesis 2:22 is showing and
[30:52] portraying here the bride God
[30:55] foreshadowing this God is showing in the
[30:58] very beginning with this creation not
[31:00] that this was to be his ultimate not
[31:02] that this was to be the end of it all
[31:03] and this was his great perfect picture
[31:06] and Satan came in and ruined the whole
[31:07] program God had planned it all out from
[31:10] the beginning Satan didn't sneak in and
[31:13] Mar this great masterpiece and God go oh
[31:14] no what do i do what should I do let's
[31:16] call it counsel let's figure this out
[31:17] weekend we have a couple options here we
[31:19] can start all over with another earth we
[31:21] could try this we could try that Adams
[31:22] got a lot of other ribs what's what
[31:24] should we do he knew all along what he
[31:26] was going to do
[31:27] nothing caught him by surprise it was it
[31:30] was ordained this way and set forth this
[31:33] way so he was foreshadowing in
[31:35] portraying you when he took this woman
[31:38] from the man
[31:39] and when he said he'd make him a
[31:41] helpmeet that Hebrew word means to one
[31:43] to be at hand always ready to help to
[31:46] comfort in to please
[31:47] he's who make one that was always to be
[31:49] at hand that helped me it's a very
[31:52] unique word it means one before him in
[31:55] opposite so it's like a mirror image one
[31:59] who is a opposite to him corresponds to
[32:02] him the word can actually be called
[32:04] a second self I'll make him a second
[32:07] self I'll make him a help II mean one
[32:10] that's opposite to him so it's a
[32:12] compliment to him just like him but yet
[32:16] okay and exactly like him but opposite
[32:19] so it's a compliment to assist him in
[32:20] aid him in his great purpose so she was
[32:23] a perfect resemblance of the man she was
[32:25] neither inferior north superior came
[32:28] from the side came from the rib
[32:29] they were co-equal and in all things
[32:32] they were equal to himself but opposite
[32:34] wide to suit his purpose to suit his
[32:36] needs and that's when the woman's
[32:39] brought to the man in Genesis 2:23 Adam
[32:42] says this is now bone of my bones flesh
[32:44] of my flesh she shall be called woman
[32:46] because she was taken out of man the
[32:49] woman was made came from the man and as
[32:52] Paul said made for the man so not in
[32:55] wish she made for him but she came from
[32:57] him and then he begins to prophesy the
[32:59] great prophecy of Scripture therefore
[33:01] shall a man leave his father and mother
[33:04] and shall cleave unto his wife and they
[33:05] shall be one flesh and they were both
[33:08] naked the man and his wife and were not
[33:11] ashamed
[33:12] just as God was showing and portraying
[33:15] the bride when he brought out the woman
[33:16] now in the garden God is foreshadowing
[33:19] that eternal Eden of Christ in his bride
[33:21] because here they're together
[33:23] husband and wife with no shame brother
[33:27] Branham says and it is the rising of the
[33:28] Sun he being the groom the bride has to
[33:30] come forward because it's part of him
[33:32] said there's been many many churches
[33:34] churches Brides Brides but there must
[33:36] come one and so he says that it can only
[33:38] be the manifestation of the fulfilling
[33:41] of all the revelations any others have
[33:44] spoke of the bride it can only manifest
[33:47] so it's a fulfilling of all the
[33:48] revelations that have ever been spoken
[33:49] of the bride
[33:51] this one that comes is fulfilling all of
[33:53] it it can only manifest if it does
[33:55] something different from the groom it
[33:57] isn't the bride because she is flesh of
[34:00] his flesh bone of his bone life of his
[34:03] life power of his power
[34:04] she is him she is him with the same
[34:10] ministry to do the same work and so we
[34:13] shouldn't spend our time trying to
[34:14] figure out the difference between Christ
[34:17] and the bride and we shouldn't be afraid
[34:19] that well if we make too much of the
[34:21] bride we take away from Christ no listen
[34:23] the more you speak against the bride the
[34:25] more you're tearing about Christ tearing
[34:27] down Christ I remember a man one time he
[34:30] was he had been married to a woman for
[34:32] maybe 20 years and they got divorced and
[34:33] he was calling me tell me how and was
[34:35] just running down his wife of 20 years
[34:37] and I was just like look the more you
[34:39] run her down the more you run you down
[34:41] she was your wife herb you know for 20
[34:44] years and so there should be no fear in
[34:47] placing the bride scripturally placing
[34:50] the bride in the message to reckons she
[34:52] is him
[34:53] and we don't we don't tear down the
[34:56] bride at the sake of lifting up Christ
[34:57] it's impossible you got to lift up the
[35:00] Word of God you got to lift up Christ
[35:02] and in doing so you're gonna lift up the
[35:03] Brian any ministry today that's lifting
[35:06] up a man it is not lifting up Christ and
[35:10] any ministries that's not feeding the
[35:12] bride lifting up the bride show it
[35:13] trying to show her in the word who she
[35:15] is that he's not zeroed in on the
[35:16] message of this hour and so this man and
[35:20] this woman this is God's first
[35:21] masterpiece in a perfect Eden but
[35:24] they're under a commission is it I
[35:26] mentioned this morning this is the world
[35:28] that God loved she said it's so pleased
[35:30] him the Garden of Eden in these things
[35:32] it's the enclosure of God's delight the
[35:34] Garden of Eden God's delight of the
[35:35] enclosure of God's delight God's
[35:37] pleasure and so it's a man and woman but
[35:41] not just man and woman they're under a
[35:43] commandment of Genesis 1:28 and that
[35:46] commitment has God blessed them and God
[35:48] said unto them be fruitful and multiply
[35:51] and replenish the earth and subdue it
[35:55] and so this has got a part of God's
[35:58] original purpose part of his original
[36:00] design it was not just a man it was not
[36:04] just
[36:04] and woman but it was a man and a woman
[36:07] under commandment to bring forth seed so
[36:11] as we read in verse 24 Genesis to Adam
[36:14] speaking after this woman comes to him
[36:16] this is that what the inspiration that
[36:18] comes forward therefore shall a man
[36:20] leave his father and his mother now
[36:24] there's no children yet but yet this is
[36:27] what comes forth this is the prophecy
[36:28] that's contained here this is what it is
[36:31] now cemented with this great happening
[36:33] where a man meets this woman for the
[36:35] first time this is what comes out
[36:38] therefore shall a man leave his father
[36:40] and his mother and shall cleave unto his
[36:42] wife and they too shall be one flesh and
[36:46] so this is part of the original word and
[36:49] this word that's being spoken here is
[36:51] signified that there was more to this
[36:53] masterpiece than just the man and a
[36:55] woman there was more than just man and
[36:57] woman the man was to be fathered the
[36:59] woman was to be mother and they were to
[37:00] have a son and he likewise was to be
[37:02] joined to his wife so the very word is
[37:05] signifying there's more to this
[37:07] masterpiece than just a man and a woman
[37:08] but there's also to be seed that comes
[37:11] forth that's very beautiful how the
[37:13] cycle works a man will leave his father
[37:16] and his mother so this would be a child
[37:18] of the man and the woman so he would be
[37:20] in the image of the parents and he says
[37:22] and they and a man going to cleave to
[37:24] his wife he says they shall be one flesh
[37:26] so here the Union starts the cycle over
[37:29] again because the parent when they have
[37:32] a child they are become one flesh again
[37:35] in their child because it's the father
[37:38] and the mother now join together in the
[37:40] child and in it's something my wife
[37:43] often likes to engage in whenever
[37:44] someone has a child she goes oh they
[37:46] look like the dad they look like the mom
[37:47] and who do you think they look like and
[37:49] I always say they look like what a child
[37:52] would look like if those two people had
[37:54] a child
[37:56] that's exactly what it looks like and
[37:59] I've wanted to do a fake quiz some time
[38:01] to show a baby picture show a mom and
[38:03] dad and say who do you see and they all
[38:05] just be random you know that's the real
[38:08] mom not the real dad not the real kid
[38:10] because we'll look for it we'll see
[38:11] something I'll definitely got dad's lips
[38:13] it definitely has mom's ears it's not
[38:14] mom or dad but that's it that's really
[38:17] what the child represents is it
[38:19] represents a union now again of the man
[38:21] and the woman in an undividable flesh
[38:24] you can't take the dad out of that boy
[38:26] you can't take the mom out of that boy
[38:28] it's in there forever permanently so
[38:31] there's a beautiful thing being
[38:32] expressed in Genesis 2:24 a man will
[38:34] leave his father and his mother shall
[38:36] cleave to his wife and they shall be one
[38:38] chapter flesh there to bring forth now
[38:41] brother branham writes in the church age
[38:44] book chapter 5 we're gonna be drawing a
[38:46] lot from the pergamene church age which
[38:48] brother man time in this takes a lot
[38:50] from spoken words the original seed and
[38:51] I was back there in the office seeking
[38:55] the Lord by dream as it were we're
[38:59] trying to maybe there's the playgrounds
[39:01] right there they're not getting much
[39:02] sleep on a Sunday afternoon with the
[39:05] playground right there you think of
[39:07] swing was attached to that room or
[39:08] something but he's just in there doing
[39:12] getting ready for the service and they
[39:13] started playing the tape spoken words in
[39:15] the original scene I was like who
[39:17] chooses these things this is right right
[39:19] where I mentioned they said they've been
[39:20] playing this now for awhile in these
[39:21] services so I believe it's just the Lord
[39:23] bringing that continuity just so you
[39:25] could know it's not for me it's so you
[39:29] would know God's with you God's feeding
[39:31] you looking out after you it's not for
[39:33] the minister any confirmation of
[39:35] vindication to him and should be
[39:36] vindication to you that God's looking
[39:37] out after you and wants to feed you by
[39:40] that voice that's on those tapes that
[39:42] we're listening to those for a purpose
[39:43] we hear that voice it becomes not common
[39:45] to us but it's familiar to us so it can
[39:47] make a difference for us and if somebody
[39:49] comes along and starts to try to tell
[39:51] you things about that voice you can say
[39:53] listen you've come too late because I
[39:55] was just listen to that voice this
[39:56] morning and it said this to me and it
[39:58] struck my soul and it did this for me
[40:00] and it changed my life you've come too
[40:01] late to try to get me suspicious of that
[40:03] voice
[40:04] so brother madam writes and the first
[40:06] son Adam was the spoken seed Word of God
[40:09] he was given a bride to reproduce
[40:13] himself that is why the bride was given
[40:16] to him to reproduce himself to produce
[40:19] another son of God to produce another
[40:23] image of God so that's why out of who's
[40:26] in the image of God was given the help
[40:28] meat is he was given a bride to
[40:30] reproduce himself now this is the
[40:32] purpose to bring forth to produce
[40:36] another son of God that is why a bride
[40:39] was given to him so then you can
[40:41] understand why God would say in Genesis
[40:43] chapter 2 verse 18 it is not good that
[40:46] man should be alone I'll make a help
[40:49] meet for him because now Adam needed a
[40:53] bride in order to be fruitful in order
[40:56] for in order for him to continue his
[40:57] work now if you look at Genesis chapter
[41:00] 2 verse 19 God has just said I need to
[41:04] make someone to help Adam and the very
[41:06] next thing it begins to describe it may
[41:08] seem peculiar its arrangement in
[41:10] scripture but it's here for a purpose
[41:12] and out of the ground the Lord God
[41:14] formed every beast of the field and
[41:16] every fowl of the air so just as God had
[41:19] formed Adam out of the ground the animal
[41:21] likewise the animal life for all these
[41:23] beasts they came from this ground every
[41:25] spoken word seed was already sowed in
[41:27] there and it would come forth forth from
[41:29] him and then it says and brought them
[41:31] unto Adam to see what he would call them
[41:34] now remembered verse 18 he said it's not
[41:37] good for men to me alone I'll make him a
[41:40] helpmate and it help me there's one
[41:41] who's there to aid him and assist him
[41:44] and brother Branham said now he had
[41:46] somebody with him and that's his great
[41:48] work but now when God says I need to
[41:51] make him somebody to help him with his
[41:53] work he begins to describe a work that
[41:56] Adam could do by himself he brought unto
[41:58] them Adam to see what he would call him
[42:00] and whatsoever Adam called every living
[42:02] creature that was the name thereof and
[42:04] Adam gave names to all cattle and to the
[42:07] fowl of the air and every beast of the
[42:09] field here's Adam working this is the
[42:12] work he could do by himself this is
[42:14] something he could do he could have
[42:15] dominion he could do these things he
[42:17] could he
[42:18] can name the cattle he could name the
[42:19] foul there he could name every beast of
[42:21] the field this was the work he could do
[42:23] by himself and so God now is using his
[42:26] son he's working he's laboring he's
[42:29] fulfilling a commission he's doing
[42:31] things that the son is supposed to do
[42:32] but he hasn't he isn't able to finish
[42:35] his work without a wife and that's why I
[42:38] believe this is inserted right here in
[42:40] this and so that you could see that Adam
[42:43] had a job to do but he hadn't finished
[42:44] his job he had to have a helpmeet to
[42:47] finish his job and then even in doing
[42:50] this job there's an image that's being
[42:51] expressed to Adam and there's and if
[42:53] something that keeps coming up before
[42:55] him because the Bible says but for Adam
[42:56] there was not found to help meet for him
[42:59] because every time Adam would name a
[43:01] beast of the field male-female found the
[43:04] air male female all the living creatures
[43:06] male female and so as Adams doing this
[43:10] I've been every every time he named the
[43:11] man he could identify with the man and
[43:13] he could give that that male a part of
[43:15] the species he could give that name and
[43:17] then all when he goes to name the woman
[43:19] I wonder if there wasn't a conversation
[43:21] he was having within himself what am i
[43:23] it's almost like I'm missing something
[43:25] because he saw something expressed an
[43:27] animal life that was inside of him male
[43:30] female male female and there's something
[43:32] maybe communing with he might have had
[43:34] something that felt like in the back
[43:35] part of his mind having fellowship with
[43:38] his laws thinking oh my I just wish
[43:40] there was somebody like me that I could
[43:42] have fellowship with and he long now to
[43:44] have a woman a female part of himself
[43:47] that he can't fellowship with and God
[43:49] saying that's right that's right my son
[43:52] that's exactly how I felt when I was
[43:54] bringing forth angels and I was doing
[43:56] all these great things I was having
[43:58] these fellowships with plots in the back
[44:01] of my mind and now Adams having the same
[44:03] experience God did Who am I is so
[44:06] beautiful but Adam could not finish all
[44:10] the work that he was given unless he had
[44:12] a woman Genesis 1:28 to be fruitful
[44:16] required a wife some brother branham's
[44:20] writes this and it also comes from the
[44:23] spoken words the original sate he says
[44:25] he did not complete all his work
[44:28] speaking of Jesus Christ now he did not
[44:30] complete all his
[44:31] while in his earthly ministry just like
[44:34] Adam he had a ministry but he didn't
[44:36] complete it he was given a woman to
[44:38] complete it so now Christ he works in
[44:41] and through the bride
[44:43] she knows that for it was not yet time
[44:46] for him to do certain things that he
[44:49] must do now but now but he will now
[44:55] fulfill through the bride that work
[44:58] which he left for this specific time
[45:03] just like Adam there was a lot he could
[45:05] do but there was a specific work that
[45:07] worked certain things for a specific
[45:09] time and what was the woman for to
[45:12] Purdue produced the image of God here's
[45:15] Adam in the image of God in order for
[45:18] him to bring forth another image of
[45:20] himself he's gonna it's going to come to
[45:22] this woman because he says he was given
[45:25] a bride to reproduce himself are you
[45:27] with me so far
[45:28] I made the mistake one time of asking is
[45:31] everybody with me nobody said a thing I
[45:33] was like wow this is a sharp group
[45:36] because nobody could answer for
[45:38] everybody so I had to say are you with
[45:41] me well if the individual was they say
[45:43] yes we're right there with you
[45:45] but I don't I don't know who I'm
[45:46] answering for behind me I don't know who
[45:48] I'm answering for in front of me so I
[45:50] say are you awake if I notice people
[45:53] drifting off I might just have you stand
[45:55] up for a little bit god I don't want you
[45:58] to miss this this is this is part of
[46:01] God's program this is what he's ordained
[46:03] to bring us into the unity of the faith
[46:05] I haven't had any fellowship with your
[46:08] pastor before haven't had the privilege
[46:10] of hearing a minister I haven't heard
[46:12] the ministries in this church but in a
[46:14] wonderful someone from the outside
[46:16] somebody just moved from Texas can just
[46:18] show it one day and you can hear the
[46:19] same message preach that you're feeding
[46:21] on that you cherish
[46:24] I didn't submit my notes beforehand and
[46:28] brother Samuel say well this is a good
[46:29] thought just change this here and insert
[46:32] this here and use these quotes there
[46:33] they didn't hand me what to preach
[46:34] there's a confidence in the Holy Ghost
[46:36] confidence and the Holy Ghost to come
[46:38] and speak the things that you have nita
[46:40] so we'll go a little bit further here
[46:43] because now is we can I hope you see
[46:46] that what was being foreshadowed in Adam
[46:48] and the woman brother BAM showing this
[46:50] with Christ and his bride because Christ
[46:52] didn't finish his whole work in the days
[46:54] of his earthly ministry but he will
[46:56] finish it through the bride because that
[46:58] work he is left for this specific time
[47:00] she's got to do certain things so if we
[47:04] look at when the original was marred or
[47:05] how it was changed it identifies it
[47:08] continues identified that word that's
[47:10] been completed today now brother BAM
[47:12] says this in spoken words the original
[47:14] scene I'll just use a number of these
[47:16] statements from there to convey this
[47:18] this thought he says notice what
[47:21] happened to Eve's children the first one
[47:23] that was born now if God said multiplied
[47:26] to his bride to Adams bride and
[47:28] replenish multiply and replenish the
[47:30] earth that was God's commission he says
[47:34] and she would have done it he would
[47:37] mixing themselves together but what
[47:40] happened when Adam got ready to come to
[47:43] her she was already a mother so we know
[47:47] and as we read here you'll see that
[47:48] there was a time that God has a time and
[47:51] there's a timing for something and there
[47:53] were it would have it was an oncoming
[47:55] promise as he describes it and so this
[47:57] was something that had she waited until
[47:59] the time then according to God's words
[48:01] she would have brought forth and she
[48:03] would have done it he said and he makes
[48:05] a very striking statement she would have
[48:07] eventually brought forth Jesus Christ
[48:09] brought forth that child is the phrase
[48:10] that he uses and that's a very
[48:12] staggering statement and now that's had
[48:14] there not been an interruption and and
[48:17] we know that it was God's plan that it
[48:20] be interrupted he knew this he he
[48:23] actually put the woman and this is very
[48:25] difficult to say but brother Evan
[48:26] teaches us he put her on the basis that
[48:28] she would fall
[48:30] that might seem to be unfair but it was
[48:33] all for God to express his attributes it
[48:36] was so that he could have at the end of
[48:38] this cycle a woman having never seen him
[48:41] but absolutely love him and that's what
[48:46] he wanted right woman to love him by
[48:49] faith in my revelation and so he says
[48:52] Adam would have come to her but but but
[48:54] he says when he got ready to come she
[48:55] was already a mother and so he says it
[48:58] this way in the same sermon Adams bride
[49:00] could not wait God had told Adam and Eve
[49:03] multiply and replenish the earth it was
[49:06] an oncoming thing a promise and I think
[49:09] he's making an important distinction
[49:11] here to understand our position today
[49:13] she was not his wife as of yet because
[49:16] he had never lived with her so that's in
[49:18] this consummation of this expression of
[49:20] the marital Union and it had not been
[49:22] completed yet he says she was not his
[49:25] wife as of yet he's using a language for
[49:27] us to understand these things and he
[49:29] says later on he says she got in a hurry
[49:31] what did she do she crossed her seat she
[49:34] mingled it with the Serpent's heed
[49:35] she brought a child of death a child
[49:37] that she perverted every child after
[49:40] that so now they were under commandment
[49:44] and a commission be fruitful multiply
[49:45] and replenish the earth and they were to
[49:48] come together under God's timing under
[49:50] God's Word in God's Way and however he
[49:52] had envisioned him remember uses the
[49:55] phrase mixing themselves mixing
[49:56] themselves together and she would have
[49:58] brought forth an image of God another
[50:01] Adam another expression of God and this
[50:05] is part of God's great family picture I
[50:06] don't and I won't have again I'm not
[50:09] trying to invite myself back or have but
[50:10] I won't have time to get to these things
[50:12] but I thought even the child dedication
[50:14] well it was wonderful this morning
[50:16] because God's great picture his great
[50:18] family portrait was father and mother
[50:20] with children and for this just to
[50:23] continue on and in and I believe that's
[50:25] our table today as token families that
[50:28] were to bring forth sons and daughters
[50:30] of God I'm just bringing forth children
[50:32] we're bringing forth sons and daughters
[50:34] of God
[50:36] and he says it continues this now
[50:39] because this commandment was given to
[50:41] the man and the woman and now the
[50:42] elements that he needs are there the man
[50:45] and his woman the woman there are there
[50:47] and they can take this commandment and
[50:49] go forth with it but he says here let me
[50:51] take these handkerchiefs and he said
[50:54] obviously I didn't see him do it but he
[50:57] said here's the man that was supposed to
[50:59] be right here is the man that's supposed
[51:01] to be what happened Eve hybrid it breed
[51:04] it what did it do
[51:05] then what did it do it turned to death
[51:07] and just keeps dying now and then I
[51:11] believe he's making reference to
[51:12] something he says now here stays the
[51:14] word just the same here's the word lain
[51:18] here just the same now what happened
[51:21] here's the word the word that God spoke
[51:23] to multiply and replenish the earth I
[51:26] think he just heard this right before
[51:28] service says it couldn't find a place to
[51:31] land so when the woman brought forth
[51:34] children even of Adam but that's also
[51:38] the mingling with the serpent that was
[51:40] not in fulfillment of Genesis 1:28 the
[51:43] commandment to be fruitful multiply
[51:45] replace the earth couldn't find a place
[51:48] to land it didn't land in the womb of
[51:50] the woman who but this so this word
[51:53] stays the same it's a prophecy it's
[51:57] still a delayed promise there's a delay
[52:00] it's caring it's waiting it couldn't
[52:02] find a place to land and so here's the
[52:04] man and the woman of Genesis 1:28 with
[52:07] an unfinished work they never finished
[52:10] the work they never did the full thing
[52:12] they never have completed what God had
[52:14] commanded them to do so now we can see
[52:17] what it is that God is wanting us to
[52:19] complete in this hour to replenish the
[52:23] earth that means to be full to be ended
[52:25] to fulfill to accomplish to complete to
[52:28] replenish what was the purpose of the
[52:30] earth to get a bride out of it that's
[52:33] what he made the earth for and were to
[52:35] replenish her to fill up to accomplish
[52:36] the Earth's purpose to fulfill it to
[52:38] bring it to a completion and so just as
[52:42] God created the heavens and the earth
[52:43] and it was without form and void and the
[52:45] Spirit of the Lord began
[52:46] move upon the face of the water and
[52:47] things begin to happen God brings it to
[52:50] a place where the great purpose of God
[52:52] is left pregnant in the earth and he's
[52:55] leaving it to the man and the woman to
[52:57] finish it and I'm gonna let you finish
[52:59] it I want you to take it from here
[53:01] but notice how brother Branham teaches
[53:03] this and this is going back to the way
[53:05] he writes it in the church age book the
[53:07] first son Adam was the spoken seed Word
[53:10] of God we read this a moment ago but
[53:13] we'll read more he was given a bride to
[53:15] reproduce himself that is why the bride
[53:18] was given to him to reproduce himself to
[53:21] reproduce another son of God which would
[53:24] be God expressed be another image of God
[53:27] but she fell she fell by hybridization
[53:30] she caused him to die so this is that
[53:34] this is what happens in the original
[53:36] Genesis 1:28 is never fulfilled because
[53:40] she hybrids she says he says now the
[53:41] second son Jesus also a spoken seed word
[53:44] of God was given a bride like what as
[53:47] was Adam in what would that before to
[53:51] reproduce himself to produce another son
[53:54] of God to produce another image of God
[53:55] that's what she if if that's what Adams
[53:58] wife was for this is what Christ twice
[53:59] was for says but before he could marry
[54:03] her she also had fallen the exact same
[54:08] thing just as the woman had fallen and
[54:10] become Eve now the bride that he's given
[54:13] on the day of Pentecost this great
[54:15] church is coming where it falls and it
[54:17] becomes more brother branham there's the
[54:22] way he describes it there's great
[54:24] commandment to be fruitful multiply and
[54:26] replenish the earth he says what
[54:28] happened
[54:28] he sent Adam and Eve here on earth and
[54:30] said multiply now and replenish the
[54:32] earth this is a peculiar statement their
[54:34] bodies was all laid out here for you to
[54:36] eat and make your body that's the way he
[54:38] had of doing it but sin come along and
[54:41] interrupted his plan so it was all laid
[54:44] out God had it all ordained and all laid
[54:47] out and there was a way that God had his
[54:49] had designed it that it would have come
[54:51] forth and Satan comes along interrupts
[54:54] seemingly interrupts and destroys God's
[54:56] plan but he's playing right into God's
[54:57] hand
[54:58] just like you did with the second animal
[55:01] I'm gonna crucify him what was he doing
[55:03] playing right into God's hands because
[55:06] what you know that saying as soon as
[55:08] this prophecy came forth in genesis 3:15
[55:09] if you want to turn there we'll read it
[55:12] he says and I'll put enmity between thee
[55:14] and the woman and between thy seed and
[55:17] her seed it shall bruise thy head now
[55:19] this is a curse to the serpent and thou
[55:21] shalt bruise his heel this is prophecy
[55:25] of the restoration of that word genesis
[55:30] 3:15 is the seed of Genesis 1:28 this is
[55:34] the reviving of the original plan and
[55:36] purpose of God there's going to be man
[55:38] and woman and the commanders be fruitful
[55:40] multiply and replenish the earth and so
[55:43] when God says the seed of the woman and
[55:45] there's going to be enmity with the seed
[55:46] of the Serpent and the seed of the woman
[55:47] he's actually prophesied of Christ
[55:50] he's prophesied of that son that would
[55:52] have come he's prophesying a redeemer
[55:54] he's prophesying a restoration of the
[55:57] original because it's brother man says
[56:00] that commandment of Genesis 1:20 could
[56:02] never find a place to land but it
[56:04] finally caught in the womb of a virgin
[56:06] mary' so now when that happens you have
[56:10] the original spoken word of Genesis 1:28
[56:13] now coming to life and what will it
[56:15] bring forth a son of that commandment
[56:18] it'll be a man of that commandment and
[56:20] what is God going to bring out of that
[56:22] man a bride to fulfill Genesis 1:28 but
[56:28] as soon as that prophecy went forth and
[56:30] thou shalt bruise his heel
[56:33] Satan was looking for a son so is it any
[56:39] wonder that the first son born of Adam
[56:42] and the woman was murdered my hybrid
[56:47] shouldn't be no surprise to you why
[56:50] because the serpent heard it the devil
[56:52] heard it and he knew it's going to be a
[56:54] son that crushes this great plan it's
[56:57] gonna be a son that destroys what I'm
[56:58] trying to do so the first son that's
[57:00] born he's murdered and so he was always
[57:04] looking out after son and finally one
[57:07] came biller Bram said that seed of a
[57:10] woman come into physical
[57:12] apart from the instrumentality of the
[57:13] human male why was Genesis 1:28 and
[57:17] before Adam could come to the woman the
[57:22] woman had been beguiled by the serpent
[57:23] so now what God does in bringing forth
[57:26] the seed of Genesis 1:28 the seed of
[57:29] genesis 3:15 before Joseph could take
[57:31] married to be wife she receives seed
[57:34] from God he's portraying something brand
[57:38] said the word of promise came to the
[57:39] Virgin Mary but that word of promise was
[57:42] he himself to be made manifest God was
[57:45] made manifest
[57:46] he himself acted at that time and
[57:48] fulfilled his own word of promise in the
[57:51] Virgin so then this is what God did he
[57:53] himself did it and that word was he
[57:56] himself and that seed was he himself
[57:58] there was God bringing forth and then it
[58:00] this is what he's portraying in Mary and
[58:02] then Bregman says here's the secret of
[58:03] this is the secret of this the word is
[58:06] in the bride as it wasn't married once
[58:09] he himself in you the word is in the
[58:12] bride so Jesus was the restoration of
[58:15] the original bridegroom the bride is the
[58:18] restoration of the original woman she is
[58:21] that original brought back alright
[58:24] everybody stand up
[58:25] stand up for a moment I think I'm
[58:27] halfway through I'm gonna stand it just
[58:30] kind of stretch a little bit what is it
[58:32] it's just it's just 205 or 305 you're
[58:35] like where they aren't you on the wrong
[58:36] time how everybody everybody feel good
[58:38] you say praise the Lord God's good hey
[58:42] man you may be seated
[58:44] that's the only way I can have to tell
[58:47] people to be seated some of them just
[58:49] had to you may be seated while you're
[58:51] preaching after every but everybody's
[58:52] sit down all the time why don't I have
[58:54] to get you to stand up I hope your hope
[58:57] you have enough to go the rest of the
[58:58] way here if I started just after 2:30
[59:01] I've only been preaching about 30
[59:02] minutes or so and I'm halfway done so
[59:05] we're doing pretty good now he says he
[59:12] says this in super sign God the great
[59:15] contractor had all his bodies laid out
[59:19] here on the earth of calcium pot aspart
[59:20] row Liam it's what he said in future
[59:23] home he said there is all laid out what
[59:24] sits in the earth
[59:27] and I think about all the substance
[59:29] wheat comes from the earth only God
[59:31] could look out after all that to bring
[59:34] us to where we are today hi
[59:36] he was going to create it and make it
[59:39] but she bypassed the way of God what did
[59:44] Adam do when he come to his wife when he
[59:46] come to her he found her pregnant of an
[59:48] evil conception had received foul seed
[59:51] that's what hadn't happened with Adam
[59:53] and the woman that came from him now he
[59:55] makes this connection again Jehovah
[59:57] before he couldn't marry his wife did
[1:00:01] the same thing and Jesus before he could
[1:00:05] get to his bride she had organized
[1:00:08] herself and become the Roman Catholic
[1:00:10] Church these things are there for us to
[1:00:13] understand what it is we're doing in
[1:00:15] this last day what makes us different
[1:00:18] than the first woman what makes us
[1:00:20] different than the first church because
[1:00:22] though we're exactly the same there's
[1:00:24] going to be one great difference listen
[1:00:27] and this outlet through all other Ages
[1:00:29] people went to church and fed on the
[1:00:30] Word of God for their day and the
[1:00:32] leadership of the Holy Spirit was taking
[1:00:34] them to a grave and absolutely sealed by
[1:00:37] the Holy Spirit of God
[1:00:38] absolutely sons and daughters of God
[1:00:40] walk into the light of their day but
[1:00:42] their God ordained supernatural
[1:00:45] experience led them to a grave but let
[1:00:47] me tell you there's people in this hour
[1:00:48] who are not having the same experience
[1:00:51] your supernatural ordained experience is
[1:00:54] not leading you to a grave but I'm
[1:00:56] meeting in the air
[1:00:58] we're not living for a funeral we're
[1:01:01] living for a meeting in the air and
[1:01:03] that's what makes this bride different
[1:01:06] she's breaking the cycle of revival in
[1:01:09] death before he can marry his wife
[1:01:12] before he could get to his bride said
[1:01:15] she had organized herself he's the same
[1:01:16] thing but he will have a bride don't you
[1:01:20] worry that will be bought with his word
[1:01:23] just exactly what he told Eve to stay
[1:01:25] with he will have a church amen
[1:01:27] that will be bought by his word finish
[1:01:33] what the woman started finish what the
[1:01:36] church started then it's what God had in
[1:01:39] his mind and now I want to I want to
[1:01:42] share this and it's introducing
[1:01:43] something that's very very large and
[1:01:47] profound and I just want to make
[1:01:49] reference to it in brother Branham is
[1:01:50] using the same type of emphasis in
[1:01:53] marriage and divorce invisible Union
[1:01:55] Satan's Eden he says what a woman is
[1:01:58] entrusted with certain characters that
[1:02:00] she must not defile him and it's in the
[1:02:03] sermon that he gives this this detail
[1:02:05] she says the woman is trusted to them
[1:02:07] there's not a creature on earth like a
[1:02:09] woman so there's no female dog there's
[1:02:11] no female of any kind entrusted with the
[1:02:14] character that a woman is a woman was
[1:02:16] not even in the beginning of the
[1:02:17] creation because God know that she would
[1:02:20] fall all other females could not commit
[1:02:23] adultery she's the only one that can
[1:02:25] commit adultery if she had been made
[1:02:27] like the original that would have been
[1:02:29] disk complementary to God's great wisdom
[1:02:31] and he's obviously sharing quite a bit
[1:02:33] you have to kind of catch what brother
[1:02:35] branham's trying to say there the his
[1:02:38] race couldn't find a very large thought
[1:02:39] a very profound thought so she was made
[1:02:42] a byproduct of men and this is where
[1:02:45] he's pointing out on this balance of
[1:02:48] this because he in one place and I don't
[1:02:51] think i'ma get to it tonight he makes
[1:02:52] the statement and that doesn't mean I'll
[1:02:54] get to it in the morning don't get
[1:02:56] nervous
[1:02:57] everybody's getting nervous now thinking
[1:02:59] I wish I was on that train
[1:03:03] he talks about how that this one this
[1:03:05] woman how that there's he says he's
[1:03:08] talking to all the filthiness and the
[1:03:09] perverted woman he said now that's the
[1:03:11] world the woman he says he says to you
[1:03:12] sisters now I'll get to your place a
[1:03:14] little later on because she has her
[1:03:16] place in the Word of God and it's
[1:03:18] something similar here he says but now
[1:03:21] he's just described the woman in this
[1:03:22] very pro curious way she's interested
[1:03:25] with characters that she must not defile
[1:03:26] but he was placed upon the basis that
[1:03:29] she could commit adultery placed upon
[1:03:31] the basis that she would fall but yes
[1:03:35] she has he she's entrusted with certain
[1:03:37] characters that she must not defile and
[1:03:39] he says but because she was cast over in
[1:03:42] that side she has also been given a
[1:03:46] sacred charge from God for redemption oh
[1:03:51] can you see what God's raising you up
[1:03:53] for because the woman was used for the
[1:03:56] fall God has reserved the woman for
[1:03:59] redemption Satan used the woman in the
[1:04:03] fall but God's gonna use the woman in
[1:04:05] the restoration because Satan used her
[1:04:08] on that side God's gonna use her in the
[1:04:11] end
[1:04:11] for the fullness of redemption that's
[1:04:14] exactly what he's saying because she was
[1:04:16] cast over in that side she's also been
[1:04:19] given a sacred charge a divine
[1:04:21] responsibility a duty by God for the
[1:04:24] purpose of glorifying God a sacred
[1:04:26] charge for redemption
[1:04:29] the woman has a special place in
[1:04:32] bringing forth the fullness of
[1:04:33] redemption listen there's a lot of ways
[1:04:35] that God could have drawn it up but God
[1:04:38] knew all along he's like I'm gonna come
[1:04:40] to the end and I'll let my wife beat him
[1:04:44] don't let it come to the end I'll let my
[1:04:46] wife take care of it I'll let it get to
[1:04:48] them right there and sentence him he
[1:04:50] came down in my eating and caused the
[1:04:52] first woman to fall I'm gonna go ahead
[1:04:54] and let him then go ahead Satan's Eden
[1:04:56] the perfection of his eating I'm gonna
[1:04:58] go ahead and raise up a bride and I'll
[1:04:59] let her take care of the rest put that
[1:05:02] last double which is death under our
[1:05:03] feet
[1:05:05] hey man she's been given a sacred charge
[1:05:09] for redemption through you will be the
[1:05:13] completion of what God for shouted in
[1:05:15] the Garden of Eden he says the spoken
[1:05:18] words the original seed he says but God
[1:05:21] came in flesh to give us another birth
[1:05:22] to bring us back to original sons and
[1:05:25] daughters of God were you listening to
[1:05:27] it he was talking about how that new
[1:05:28] birth brings us back right there before
[1:05:30] service he says there you are
[1:05:32] he says the life sperm of Eve never
[1:05:34] happened it never did why she mingled it
[1:05:38] kept it away instead of Adam coming to
[1:05:41] her for a bride when the time appointed
[1:05:43] would be just like Christ would have
[1:05:45] come to the group Christ would have come
[1:05:48] to his church at an appointed time he
[1:05:51] promised to do it God promised to
[1:05:53] multiply but they had to wait until
[1:05:56] God's time and I say it's that time the
[1:06:01] delay is over the Lord Himself has
[1:06:03] descended with the shout the mighty
[1:06:06] angels descended out of heaven with an
[1:06:07] open book and calls unto his elect come
[1:06:10] unto me take the book eat it up that you
[1:06:14] and take in this book can prophesy again
[1:06:16] being a final voice to the final age
[1:06:18] being a declaration of Jesus Christ be
[1:06:21] the name reproduction of God and flesh
[1:06:24] this is that time the day is over the
[1:06:29] Old Testament prefigured Christ and all
[1:06:32] the prophecies and all the figures and
[1:06:34] sages of the Old Testament they were pre
[1:06:37] figure of Jesus Christ and then and it
[1:06:39] finally it culminates in the perfect
[1:06:41] expression of the bridegroom we read it
[1:06:43] this morning Brother Bear says she's the
[1:06:45] New Testament that's all so the New
[1:06:47] Testament prefigures the Bride of Christ
[1:06:48] which culminates in the perfect
[1:06:51] expression of the brine
[1:06:53] that's what even these church ages have
[1:06:55] been all about Bram says at harvest time
[1:06:57] is Noah Moses David reflected the coming
[1:07:00] of this perfect bridegroom so as Luther
[1:07:02] Wesley and Pentecost reflected the
[1:07:04] coming of a perfect bride she and she
[1:07:09] has a sacred charge for redemption
[1:07:12] why because bread man says that life
[1:07:14] sperm of Eve never happened it never did
[1:07:17] he says
[1:07:18] before Adam could come to her then he
[1:07:20] god raises up a church on the day of
[1:07:22] Pentecost as Christ would have come to
[1:07:23] his church but before he did before he
[1:07:25] could Satan was already at work in the
[1:07:27] midst of him but it didn't stumble
[1:07:29] garden God knew all along and you think
[1:07:33] about it just the momentum of this I've
[1:07:35] been potting this for quite some time
[1:07:36] the momentum of everything that's been
[1:07:38] happening since God formed himself in
[1:07:40] the logos everything building every
[1:07:43] every turn every second every minute
[1:07:44] every event every prophecy every miracle
[1:07:47] every sign every experience at the altar
[1:07:49] every prayer line every testimony of the
[1:07:52] the Saints of the days gone by foxes
[1:07:54] Book of Martyrs my dad would say foxes
[1:07:56] book of mortars I thought maybe they're
[1:07:57] all bricklayers but all these things
[1:07:59] down to the age everything happening
[1:08:01] everything coming from a time after time
[1:08:03] it's all been building torn ow you can
[1:08:06] actually have a people on earth and can
[1:08:08] look back by way of a prophet giving us
[1:08:11] this great entrance into the presence of
[1:08:13] God we can look back and know everything
[1:08:16] that God has been just the time befallen
[1:08:18] himself in the world God and she can
[1:08:20] take her stand on the expression of God
[1:08:22] and say it's all come down to this it's
[1:08:26] been building to this moment and this
[1:08:28] time there's gonna be a bride of his
[1:08:30] choosing and here she is come it's come
[1:08:35] to this time where he's come to unite
[1:08:39] he's joined himself together at this
[1:08:41] Brydon and brother BAM says in Christ as
[1:08:43] the mystery God revealed and I just have
[1:08:45] a few statements left
[1:08:46] he says the anointed man now the
[1:08:49] anointed people all my to bring back the
[1:08:52] anointed bride and the bridegroom
[1:08:55] anointed by accepting what Eve turned
[1:08:57] down so it has to be what we looked at
[1:09:00] has to be there in Genesis 1 Genesis 2
[1:09:02] and Adam coming back with the anointed
[1:09:05] of the word because he said my word of
[1:09:07] spirit she anointed with the word what
[1:09:10] Eve turned down he ketched us he comes
[1:09:13] back and we accept what are we accepting
[1:09:17] him he said all seven seals are opened
[1:09:20] if you can receive it we receive it we
[1:09:23] accept it so how that hybrid condition
[1:09:26] again just exactly how he done Eve he
[1:09:28] told him don't you do this don't you do
[1:09:29] that you can do this and that and Saints
[1:09:31] you know but she turned around and
[1:09:34] listen to him but in the last but the
[1:09:37] even the last days is not going to do it
[1:09:39] why we're over there and we're just
[1:09:42] better and we're just good ER and we
[1:09:44] just try harder and you know it's just
[1:09:46] we've got mp3s they didn't have him no
[1:09:49] no he says because she preached she's
[1:09:50] predestined not to do it why why did the
[1:09:54] first woman fall well she was ordained
[1:09:57] doing I mean that's just what happened
[1:10:01] why won't we fall because we're day not
[1:10:04] to the even the last days is not going
[1:10:08] to do it because she's predestined not
[1:10:10] to do it yes sir
[1:10:11] God's going to do it he knows he'll have
[1:10:14] it he said his church would be there
[1:10:17] without spot or wrinkle she's going to
[1:10:19] stand there in the splendor of him his
[1:10:22] word made manifest
[1:10:24] hallelujah your predestinated motto for
[1:10:27] all your ups and downs and in and outs
[1:10:30] and all your weaknesses listen don't
[1:10:32] focus on that focus on the promise
[1:10:34] you're ordained not to fall gone to this
[1:10:40] evil age he says what would God call the
[1:10:42] people out of this age for the reason is
[1:10:45] to try her she wants to try his bride
[1:10:48] and we've been talking about how God
[1:10:51] what he wants to do in Satan's eNOS it's
[1:10:53] just all him avenging the engine tables
[1:10:55] blood his great plan when he cast Satan
[1:10:59] out of heaven he wanted to deal with
[1:11:01] that he just just knew just the way to
[1:11:03] do with it this is dealing with Satan
[1:11:05] all in new could you all sin old death
[1:11:07] always says it's a great plan of
[1:11:08] redemption for God to express himself
[1:11:09] but now we've come to the end where now
[1:11:11] this woman has got to be tried by all of
[1:11:13] it what she's made manifest been tried
[1:11:17] been proven proved to Satan like it was
[1:11:20] at the beginning so shall it be at the
[1:11:22] end there's your statement like it was
[1:11:24] at the beginning so shall it be at the
[1:11:26] end as the seed starts in the ground it
[1:11:28] comes up through carriers the life of it
[1:11:29] but it ends up in the same seed that it
[1:11:31] was when it went into the ground and the
[1:11:33] same way the seat of deceit fell on the
[1:11:35] ground in Eden is the same way ends up
[1:11:36] in the last days just as the gospel when
[1:11:38] it failed to a denomination and I see it
[1:11:40] it ends up in a super organization just
[1:11:42] as the seat of the church fell back
[1:11:44] there
[1:11:44] with signs and wonders and a live in
[1:11:46] Christ among it ends up in the last days
[1:11:48] under the ministry of Malachi 4 and
[1:11:50] restores back the original faith that
[1:11:53] was once given we find now this evil age
[1:11:57] is to prove to Satan she is not like Eve
[1:12:00] that she is not that type of a woman a
[1:12:06] man do you believe that we should
[1:12:09] believe that this age in this evil age
[1:12:12] is to prove to Satan that she's not like
[1:12:15] Eve that is she is not that type of a
[1:12:17] woman and I remember reading this some
[1:12:21] years back and as I was reading it and
[1:12:23] pondered it it struck me as I read over
[1:12:25] it it's at this age is evil to prove to
[1:12:29] Satan she's not like Eve in other words
[1:12:33] God wanted it to be the most evil age
[1:12:35] there ever was
[1:12:37] so that Satan's with that excuse just
[1:12:41] like what job they said well I mean look
[1:12:43] you built the heads around him no wonder
[1:12:44] he maintains his integrity no wonder he
[1:12:47] worships you no wonder he blesses you
[1:12:49] he's up charlie he lives a charmed life
[1:12:50] and God said you know what take
[1:12:52] everything away from but his life and
[1:12:53] he'll keep his integrity and what did
[1:12:55] job do he proved God right and so it's a
[1:12:59] similar thing that's happened in this
[1:13:00] day God says okay I want Satan to build
[1:13:03] for six thousand years give him as much
[1:13:04] time as I had to build my eden and let
[1:13:06] him build his eden and it's there that
[1:13:08] I'm gonna raise up a bride and just as
[1:13:12] the woman in a perfect Eden surrounded
[1:13:14] by no love no death around her at all
[1:13:17] perfect understanding love of God
[1:13:18] everything around her everything
[1:13:20] bringing forth of its kind Satan caused
[1:13:21] her to fall he now raises up a woman in
[1:13:24] the midst of great darkness and
[1:13:25] perverseness and it's the most foul and
[1:13:27] dark it's ever been and you know why
[1:13:29] it's evil because of you I mean that's
[1:13:35] what he's saying
[1:13:35] that's way he struck me when I read it
[1:13:37] several years ago this age is as evil as
[1:13:39] it is to prove the brides not like Eve
[1:13:42] so it's our fault in a way all right and
[1:13:48] and listen that means we've got the
[1:13:50] remedy to it
[1:13:52] that means we've got power over it
[1:13:54] because it's as wicked as it is to prove
[1:13:57] that were not like Eve that even in
[1:13:59] Satan's Eden we can stand he says she's
[1:14:03] not like he she's not that type of a
[1:14:05] woman and she will be tried by his word
[1:14:07] the brightest Adams bride was tried by
[1:14:09] the word and Adams bride believed every
[1:14:12] bit of the word all but confused on one
[1:14:14] promise that he's the same yesterday
[1:14:16] today and forever today see but failed
[1:14:20] on one promise under the temptation of
[1:14:22] the enemy face-to-face and now the
[1:14:25] people that's called for his name of
[1:14:27] course is his bride she is to come in
[1:14:29] contact again by the same thing not by
[1:14:33] just denominational truth or something
[1:14:35] but by every word she it now just as the
[1:14:40] woman in the beginning had an experience
[1:14:43] she had the Word of God given to her and
[1:14:45] she knew this word is she was tried by
[1:14:48] the word and she came under the
[1:14:50] temptation of the enemy face-to-face
[1:14:51] he's saying this bride in the last days
[1:14:54] has got to come in contact again by the
[1:14:56] same thing by every word so that what
[1:14:59] happened literally in Genesis 2 was the
[1:15:02] woman was brought forth and she had a
[1:15:05] commandment to be fruitful multiply and
[1:15:07] replenish the earth and now what she is
[1:15:09] expressed she's brought face to face
[1:15:12] with her bridegroom and it's after she's
[1:15:16] been brought face to face with her
[1:15:17] bridegroom and has under this
[1:15:19] commandment has been given the
[1:15:20] revelation of him and her purpose it's
[1:15:23] after that she's tried by the enemy and
[1:15:25] the same thing has happened to us in
[1:15:27] this hour we have had Malachi 4:5 where
[1:15:30] the Ministry of Elijah brings us face to
[1:15:32] face to Jesus Christ
[1:15:34] now you're Gentiles so the way God
[1:15:37] reveals himself to you is different than
[1:15:39] the way he identifies himself with to
[1:15:41] the Jews everything's physical with the
[1:15:43] Jews to the Gentiles it's spiritual so
[1:15:46] he was he was a fleshly bridegroom in
[1:15:48] the days of his coming to Israel but now
[1:15:51] it's the revealed word our mate
[1:15:54] that's what we know our revealed word
[1:15:57] our made and so now you've been brought
[1:15:59] face to face with your bridegroom
[1:16:01] it's our Lord up there there he is
[1:16:04] standing there and in he's a wigged one
[1:16:07] the supreme deity it also shows us that
[1:16:09] it's the lamb now as a lion that's the
[1:16:11] mane of a lion here he's coming in a
[1:16:13] different time a different dispensation
[1:16:15] to avenge his elect and now that you've
[1:16:18] met him face to face Jesus Christ has
[1:16:20] made known you through the word and
[1:16:22] you've been brought into a union with
[1:16:23] your mate you will now be tried by that
[1:16:26] word and you face your enemy face to
[1:16:28] face and you can do it with confidence
[1:16:32] knowing you can not fail because you've
[1:16:39] been ordained not to you'll prove that
[1:16:42] you're not that type of a woman and
[1:16:45] brother Branham said in the first
[1:16:47] chapter the church age book has Adam and
[1:16:48] Eve were in the garden and did not
[1:16:49] finish out the thousand years now Jesus
[1:16:53] our last Adam and his Eve true church
[1:16:54] will fulfill all the plan of God oh you
[1:17:01] will fulfill he will fulfill you and him
[1:17:04] together will fulfill all the plan of
[1:17:06] God not just him it's you that's why
[1:17:11] when you come to the end of the book it
[1:17:13] says the spirit and the bride say come
[1:17:16] now that voice is united together
[1:17:19] now she's he's speaking through her and
[1:17:23] invite the musicians to come in Chapter
[1:17:27] five of the church age but gets spoken
[1:17:29] words the original seed and I'm not sure
[1:17:30] just exactly where it is in the tape
[1:17:32] you're listening to bits where he says
[1:17:33] pick up the pin and this is how it's
[1:17:36] expressed here in the church age book
[1:17:39] and it's a lengthy quote but I believe
[1:17:41] it just summarizes what I've been
[1:17:42] expressing to you today and I hope this
[1:17:45] has been a blessing to you says here's
[1:17:48] what I'm trying to say to you the law of
[1:17:50] reproduction is that each species forth
[1:17:53] after its own kind even according to
[1:17:56] Genesis 111 and God said let the earth
[1:17:58] bring forth grass and the herb yielding
[1:17:59] seed and the fruit tree yielding fruit
[1:18:01] after his kind whose seed is in itself
[1:18:03] upon the earth and it was so whatever
[1:18:06] life was in the seed came forth into a
[1:18:08] plane
[1:18:08] and thence into fruit because that's
[1:18:11] when you're brought back because the
[1:18:13] seed fruit is flesh around the seed so
[1:18:18] you are the fruit flesh around the seed
[1:18:21] flesh becoming word word becoming flesh
[1:18:24] he said the very same law applies to the
[1:18:27] church today
[1:18:27] whatever seed started the church would
[1:18:30] come forth and be like the original seed
[1:18:32] because it is the same seed in these
[1:18:35] last days the true bread church Christ
[1:18:37] see sow the seed is not not so much what
[1:18:41] the first church was but what the
[1:18:42] bridegroom was we'll come to the
[1:18:45] headstone she will be the super church a
[1:18:48] super race as she nears him then the
[1:18:51] bride will be so much like him that they
[1:18:54] will be in his very image this is in
[1:18:56] order to be united with him they will be
[1:18:59] one listen to this they will be the very
[1:19:02] manifestation of the word of the Living
[1:19:05] God
[1:19:06] denominations cannot produce this wrong
[1:19:08] seed they will produce their Creed's and
[1:19:10] their dogmas mixed with the word this
[1:19:12] mongrel izing brings forth the hybrid
[1:19:14] product first son Adam was the spoken
[1:19:18] seed Word of God he was given a bride to
[1:19:20] reproduce himself that is why the bride
[1:19:23] was given to him to reproduce himself to
[1:19:25] produce another son of God but she fell
[1:19:28] she filled my hybridisation she caused
[1:19:30] him to die the second son Jesus also a
[1:19:33] spoken seed Word of God was given a
[1:19:35] bride like was Adam but before he can
[1:19:38] marry her she also had fallen she liked
[1:19:41] Adams wife was put to the test whether
[1:19:43] she would believe the Word of God and
[1:19:45] live or doubt the word and die she
[1:19:48] doubted she left the word she died but
[1:19:52] we're living in a time there'll be a
[1:19:55] people not taste death here right form a
[1:19:58] little group of the true seed of the
[1:20:00] word God will present Christ with the
[1:20:02] beloved bride she is a virgin of his
[1:20:05] word she is a virgin because she knows
[1:20:07] no man-made Creed's or dogmas this is
[1:20:10] the phrase that just sums it all up and
[1:20:11] you'll say brother Aaron you could have
[1:20:12] read that this morning we could eat
[1:20:13] chicken all day but he says it all right
[1:20:17] here by and through the members of the
[1:20:20] bride
[1:20:21] we'll be fulfilled all that was promised
[1:20:24] of God to be made manifest in the Virgin
[1:20:28] Panama I love that I'm gonna read it
[1:20:33] I'll keep maybe reading and maybe a few
[1:20:35] more times because I really want you to
[1:20:36] catch the distinction he makes here it
[1:20:38] just doesn't say through the bride
[1:20:40] because a lot of us think it's just
[1:20:42] going to happen by proxy will brother
[1:20:44] Samuel you're doing it for us brother
[1:20:46] Wade you're doing it for us
[1:20:47] oh yeah we're just thinking all they're
[1:20:49] all they're doing it for us and all men
[1:20:50] this great move of God over in that
[1:20:52] church and a great thing happening over
[1:20:54] there overseas and these signs and
[1:20:55] wonders happening everywhere else listen
[1:20:57] we all have our part to play brother man
[1:20:59] talks about you may not lay your hands
[1:21:00] upon a body and watch it be quickened to
[1:21:02] life you may not be the one that sees
[1:21:04] miracles happen you may not be present
[1:21:06] when the Spirit of God moves in a
[1:21:07] service and people shouting and passing
[1:21:09] out because the God moves in different
[1:21:12] ways he gives us gifts everly in
[1:21:14] different dispensations and things but
[1:21:16] there's one thing you can say for sure
[1:21:17] that you as a member of this bride you
[1:21:20] have a purpose you have a job to do and
[1:21:22] thus said the Lord is God doing his work
[1:21:25] through you just as he promised to do
[1:21:28] him bringing his word to pass however he
[1:21:33] thought of it in the beginning and so
[1:21:36] what he expressed is here I was waiting
[1:21:39] for the whistle to come I knew it was
[1:21:41] coming he says by and through the
[1:21:44] members of the bride not just the bride
[1:21:48] collectively but through you as an
[1:21:50] individual I want you to take this to
[1:21:52] heart brother Brown as I read this
[1:21:53] motion I must serve his purpose by and
[1:21:56] through me will be fulfilled all that
[1:21:59] was promised of God to be made manifest
[1:22:01] in the Virgin what was promised to God
[1:22:03] to be made manifest in the woman in the
[1:22:05] garden what was promised to be made
[1:22:07] manifest and the woman of the first
[1:22:09] church is now going to be fulfilled by
[1:22:11] and through the members of the bride God
[1:22:13] is completing the original God is
[1:22:16] finishing the purpose of the earth and
[1:22:18] he's going to do it for you I said god I
[1:22:20] want to serve your purpose by and
[1:22:22] through the members of this church
[1:22:24] spoken word Church God will by and
[1:22:27] through you fulfill all those to be made
[1:22:30] manifest in the Virgin
[1:22:32] god bless you let's stand to our feet
[1:22:34] why don't you just give them thanks
[1:22:36] maybe we could say of course if I love
[1:22:38] him I love him I sing it in the key of C
[1:22:41] if that works for you all it'd be good
[1:22:43] for me let's think about what he's done
[1:22:45] for you think of this as we sing this
[1:22:48] great course to him oh I love him hasn't
[1:22:52] he done such wonderful things for you
[1:22:54] love him
[1:22:58] [Music]
[1:22:59] [Applause]
[1:23:00] [Music]
[1:23:05] because people love me
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:18] is my salary
[1:23:23] [Applause]
[1:23:27] long time
[1:23:30] every street just lift your hands and
[1:23:36] praise them now
[1:23:39] [Music]
[1:23:44] [Music]
[1:23:52] because
[1:23:54] he loved me chest
[1:24:08] sound a
[1:24:14] Danka
[1:24:22] I hope you can just see this beautiful
[1:24:23] theme in the word how we're fulfilling
[1:24:26] the original ha there's so much there in
[1:24:29] this seed chapter of the Bible God is
[1:24:32] quickly laying all these things down
[1:24:33] because you know it's just how quickly
[1:24:34] he gets through creation the fall of man
[1:24:36] and he's quickly getting to Abraham why
[1:24:39] because now it begins to foreshadow in
[1:24:40] Abraham what he's going to do through
[1:24:42] Christ in you because the seed promised
[1:24:45] Abraham was the seed of genesis 3:15
[1:24:48] which is the promise of Genesis 1:28 it
[1:24:52] wasn't Isaac but it was actually Christ
[1:24:55] and Paul picks this up and you're
[1:24:56] tracing it all the way back to Jennifer
[1:24:58] and what you find genesis is
[1:25:00] foreshadowing you go all the way back
[1:25:02] now thousands and thousands of years
[1:25:03] later here you are over 6,000 years
[1:25:07] later and here we are and that's what
[1:25:09] was foreshadowed then it's amazing to
[1:25:11] think of it that way but that's exactly
[1:25:12] what it is really this this this
[1:25:16] gathering right here and this almost 50
[1:25:20] year old building whatever it is you're

[1:26:49] doing things in different ministries if
[1:26:51] we could submit under the headship of
[1:26:53] the word and let you have the
[1:26:55] preeminence then we can harmonize
[1:26:56] together and be a great voice living out
[1:26:59] against the enemy in this hour i'ma pray
