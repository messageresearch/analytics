[25:01] here amen they're good support but good
[25:06] to be in the house the Lord good to have
[25:07] our visitors with us from brother
[25:09] Wallace Church there in Virginia believe
[25:11] it is and good to have them with us and
[25:13] they're one of us so we don't have to
[25:16] hide anything
[25:19] kaitlin's with us today so everything's
[25:21] got good I finally remembered your name
[25:26] sterling bringing this girlfriend of
[25:29] Turks that's good
[25:30] so good to be in the house the Lord now
[25:31] what we're going to do today is is I
[25:34] told you a couple of weeks ago before we
[25:36] went to New Mexico that we would answer
[25:38] some questions so there's a couple of
[25:40] questions that I got and we're just
[25:43] going to go back through and cover this
[25:44] Genesis 1:26 man one of the questions
[25:48] was explain what the Genesis 1:26 man is
[25:51] exactly what it is with not all the
[25:53] other stuff around around it and number
[25:55] two was this one was Rhines in Genesis
[25:59] 1:26 men could not fall so when Adam
[26:03] fell what part or parts of the Genesis
[26:05] 1:26 man left Adam so we're going to try
[26:07] today to explain that maybe draw it on
[26:12] the board and I want to tell you
[26:13] something
[26:16] before we get started
[26:18] you can't draw these things I'm going to
[26:21] read your quote we're brother Ramsay
[26:22] you've got to you've got to see this
[26:25] with a supernatural eye so we can draw
[26:30] all we want to and you can't explain God
[26:33] with it and then because how can you
[26:36] draw eternity how can you draw something
[26:38] that was nothing and then it became
[26:39] something yet it always was something
[26:43] you can't do that but I'm going to try
[26:46] and like I said involving him coming
[26:49] down the road yesterday i daddy slapped
[26:52] I couldn't sleep so I got up Friday
[26:54] night I went and setting my car and her
[26:58] my truck and and did some studying out
[27:00] the only thing you can get in that place
[27:02] where we were at was if you what's on
[27:04] your phone so I had the tablet or the
[27:08] word on my phone so I was looking up the
[27:11] often in things like that so I got a
[27:12] little thought that we will try to
[27:14] continue I know that most of you here
[27:18] know that the Genesis 1:26 men is a
[27:21] favorite subject of mine but we're going
[27:23] to try to by the Lord's help I want to
[27:27] where it will be plain and easy for you
[27:29] to understand that's our job that's our
[27:32] job our jobs not for us to figure out
[27:34] how it is it's to give it to you and
[27:38] present it to you and let God speak to
[27:40] you and through that filter of the Holy
[27:42] Ghost you get it for yourself and that's
[27:44] what we was talking about this morning
[27:47] like brother Dale those seven sons of
[27:48] sceva they said we're jury in the name
[27:50] the poll priests and the demon said we
[27:52] know Paul we know Jesus but we all know
[27:55] you are so we're going to we're going to
[27:59] try to to not preach this than a what
[28:03] Paul preached we're going to try to
[28:04] bring it to you in the love of the Lord
[28:07] and some quotes in Scripture so if you
[28:09] would pull up Genesis 1:26 and if I do
[28:13] draw something that you don't see or
[28:15] understand or just hold your hand up
[28:18] because today we're just going to answer
[28:19] questions we're just going to have a
[28:20] sunday-school class and if you got a you
[28:22] got a question just raise your hand up
[28:23] and we'll stop and try to answer it so
[28:25] if we don't get finished with it maybe
[28:26] we'll finish it next Sunday I got a call
[28:29] in to brother Tim Humes he wants me to
[28:31] preach for him that
[28:32] Sunday but he hasn't called me back yet
[28:33] so we'll let you know though probably
[28:35] before Wednesday night but let's bow our
[28:37] heads before we get started just pray
[28:39] for us that we will bring it so simple
[28:44] to you can understand it
[28:45] Amen let's bow our heads there Heavenly
[28:48] Father we pray today Lord this truly we
[28:52] need you to be the active participant
[28:53] the one Lord that moves our thoughts and
[28:56] ideas out of the way and you come and be
[28:59] the one that draws and the one that
[29:00] gives a revelation be the here be the
[29:04] speaker you take total control Lord
[29:07] because we pray that something will be
[29:10] said today that will help each one
[29:13] property God said it was good to have
[29:15] questions but I believe it's good to
[29:17] have questions an answer
[29:18] amen answers to the questions that the
[29:21] people have they're good questions
[29:23] they're questions that are all in our
[29:25] hearts and minds we pray to door today
[29:27] Lord that you will settle that for each
[29:29] one of us forgive us of our sins bless
[29:32] the ones that are not here the ones that
[29:34] are sick bless our visitors that are
[29:36] among us Lord we they're not visitors
[29:38] they're just family members coming to
[29:40] see a a new part of the family of God
[29:42] and father we pray that you'd be with
[29:44] the missionaries on the foreign fields
[29:46] give them fruit for their labor let's
[29:48] each one bless brother dick and sister
[29:50] Gail Lord is a 62 years of life together
[29:55] father they're they're just a wonderful
[29:59] couple a great example of Christian
[30:03] experience changing somebody's life
[30:06] father we pray that should be with us
[30:08] take care of us lead us and guide us by
[30:10] your Holy Spirit in Jesus name Amen
[30:12] and happy Father's Day to all you
[30:14] fathers and hey happy Father's Day to
[30:16] all you mothers because without your
[30:17] mothers we wouldn't be fathers and
[30:20] without you fathers we wouldn't be
[30:22] mothers so we got to do this all
[30:23] together so anyway amen
[30:26] and God said let us make man this is
[30:29] Genesis 1:26 God said let us make man in
[30:33] our image after our likeness so it's not
[30:37] a you're going to hear brother Branham
[30:39] he's going to bring out in illustration
[30:42] purposes only halo of light sacred light
[30:46] remember if we were made in the image of
[30:49] God we were not sacred lights and we
[30:52] were not halos we were human people all
[30:56] right after I likeness and let them
[30:58] plural have dominion over the fish of
[31:00] the sea over the fowl of the air and
[31:02] over the cattle over all the earth and
[31:04] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[31:05] upon the earth so God created man in his
[31:09] own image in the image of God created he
[31:11] him male and female created he them and
[31:15] God blessed them I like that because he
[31:18] blessed them before they even put them
[31:19] in flesh brother a bless them for even
[31:21] put it on the earth so we're blessed
[31:22] people a man and God blessed them and
[31:25] God said unto them be fruitful and
[31:27] multiply and replenish the earth and
[31:30] subdue it in other words have dominion
[31:32] over the fish of the sea and over the
[31:34] fowl of the air and over every living
[31:35] thing that moveth upon the earth you may
[31:39] be seated in the war that is blessing to
[31:41] the reading of the word and we're just
[31:42] going to like say we're going to try to
[31:44] take our time but what I want to we
[31:47] didn't bring out some of these words
[31:49] the last time I want to make this where
[31:51] we can Donny can you see all that board
[31:54] daddy you can't sell it okay this board
[31:57] can you see it okay can everybody see
[32:03] that board this is a board okay can
[32:10] everybody see the board can everybody
[32:13] see the board and we'll get it in a
[32:17] minute all right so let's get let's
[32:20] let's get a few of these words don't go
[32:24] to sleep yet okay thank you and the
[32:28] Greek lexicon we look up the there's
[32:30] going to be two words we're going to
[32:31] bring in today and I'm going to let the
[32:33] prophet of God tell us from the quotes
[32:37] and then from the quotes I'm going to
[32:39] attempt to because they always say that
[32:41] you know what is it listening you get so
[32:42] much a percent reading you get so much a
[32:46] percent reading and listening you get a
[32:48] better percentage but visual you get a
[32:50] much better percent of of understanding
[32:53] so today we want to look at it was kind
[32:57] of funny brother um
[33:00] Holloway was preaching on justification
[33:03] sanctification baptism Holy Ghost
[33:04] brother temperature and he said he said
[33:06] I wished I was a teacher like so-and-so
[33:08] that was in their church and and he said
[33:11] the brothers said well now brothers is
[33:12] some people teach college and some
[33:15] people teach elementary school some
[33:19] people teach kindergarten so you can
[33:22] have teachers that teach at these
[33:23] different levels so I want to be I want
[33:26] to be where we can see what God's
[33:28] already given this is this is not
[33:30] something new all right but I want to
[33:32] explain it for those that has a question
[33:34] about it all right so now the Greek
[33:36] lexicon brings the word logos in which
[33:41] low gods means word saying an account
[33:44] speech are the word or Christ everybody
[33:48] got that same am all right so we got one
[33:51] word here we got what we got two words
[33:54] actually but I'm gonna list them right
[33:56] here you got low gaan and you got Christ
[33:59] yes I'm left-handed and yes this is how
[34:01] I write so so that works out good I can
[34:04] step over here all right so we got low
[34:06] gosh we've got Christ now I want to go
[34:09] to number one and let's read three four
[34:11] quote the deity of Jesus Christ 1949
[34:16] this is 1949 alright so we're going to
[34:19] bring this word in like someone was
[34:23] speaking the other day God what was he
[34:25] when he was back yonder millions and
[34:27] millions of years ago when he was no
[34:30] just like this space here now what we're
[34:31] going to do is today this is God no
[34:36] boundaries this whole white part of this
[34:38] board is God is that okay that's
[34:40] eternity there's no that's what I said
[34:43] you can't draw this but for but for
[34:46] illustration purposes this whole white
[34:48] is just like what brother Dale will talk
[34:50] about this morning every attribute of
[34:52] God I can't lift them all I Omega all
[34:58] the way all the way through this is all
[35:00] God something we can't understand
[35:03] because we're finite people how can you
[35:06] understand a God that ten billion maybe
[35:09] maybe maybe billion years ago he hadn't
[35:13] aged a day
[35:14] when he said this right here in Genesis
[35:17] 1:26 to this stay standing here God is
[35:19] not one second older we can't fathom
[35:23] that because we're finite people we all
[35:26] are in time and time continues on and we
[35:29] said well God's got to get older I was
[35:31] telling you a long time ago you know the
[35:34] denominational world they all think God
[35:36] is some grey-headed stoop-shouldered
[35:40] who's one of the eternal God that look
[35:42] like that
[35:43] I don't want an old God I believe God is
[35:46] eighteen to twenty years old I believe
[35:48] he's in the prime of his life amen
[35:51] Melchizedek didn't meet Abraham and tell
[35:53] him he's going to get a body change and
[35:55] have to walk up to Abraham like this
[35:58] no he was a young man that's why Abraham
[36:02] could even look at him and say Lord God
[36:04] you're young you're just a child Abraham
[36:08] was 99 close to citrulline Aziz I said
[36:16] close but she's she's closer to being
[36:21] young than we are a man yeah I think
[36:25] eyes that way that was just space that
[36:29] was your space all right and then he
[36:32] gathered up into the logos and then he
[36:36] came from the logos down into Christ see
[36:40] it's just God coming down like this to
[36:42] the earth then going right back into God
[36:45] again that alright say Amen all right
[36:49] don't you see what I mean
[36:51] just revolving coming down from space
[36:53] from eternity rolling together
[36:55] now listen let me tell you something
[36:57] I've always told you this before for the
[36:59] sake of the visitors this is not for God
[37:02] understanding right God had never had a
[37:08] different thought he's never had a new
[37:10] thought all this is for us and if there
[37:15] was any better way for God to explain it
[37:17] he would have already give it to us
[37:19] so this is the way God wants to be
[37:22] explained
[37:23] on this side of eternity and then
[37:26] because that's what he said
[37:27] right hey watch coming down from space
[37:29] from eternity rolling together coming
[37:32] down into the low goes the low GOx down
[37:36] into the man then returning right back
[37:39] again for one purpose to redeem that man
[37:43] that had fallen right all right to
[37:47] redeem the man that had fallen I go to
[37:50] 46 let's go back up to here and God in
[37:53] the beginning made his first man he made
[37:57] him out of spirit and the Spirit is the
[38:00] invisible part of man that you don't see
[38:03] now God made man in his own image are
[38:06] you listening to me
[38:08] congregation says why a man that was
[38:11] weak your favorite team just scored a
[38:18] touchdown ok now what hey man one day
[38:23] we'll get all this together
[38:24] alright God made man in his own image
[38:26] the god of the Spirit says the Bible the
[38:29] first man that was made had the
[38:31] government overall the creation that's
[38:32] what we were just talking about in
[38:33] Genesis 1:26
[38:35] and the first man was made had the
[38:37] government overall the creation just
[38:38] like the Holy Spirit has government over
[38:41] the church today alright
[38:43] he led the creation he led the animals
[38:46] so now we got another one here we got
[38:48] and I I'm not afraid to go so I'm gonna
[38:51] say holy go okay a lot of people in the
[38:55] denominational world they're full of
[38:56] ghosts they call the Holy Spirit but I
[38:58] say go I like the Holy Ghost amen amen
[39:02] thank you better but there was no man he
[39:06] he led the animals but there was no man
[39:08] to till the soil so god made man out of
[39:10] the dust of the earth now this is the
[39:12] flesh part of man that you see alright
[39:14] and that man he might have give him a
[39:16] hand like a monkey a mighty give him a
[39:18] foot like feet like a bear whatever he
[39:20] did he just throwed it together and made
[39:22] a man but this man he put this immortal
[39:27] spirit that never dies into this man
[39:32] alright and he became more than a brute
[39:35] he became a man that all right say man I
[39:38] like that quote there number two the red
[39:41] of Lazarus 1951 brother Brown said and
[39:44] then after he got all this creation made
[39:47] he said let us plural make man in our
[39:49] image in our plural own image now if God
[39:52] is unseen if the logos was in the form
[39:55] just mythically speaking so now it's a
[39:58] drama okay so I said you can't draw this
[40:02] and make it look right right but in the
[40:05] form of a halo then it's supernatural
[40:07] then he had to make a man in his own
[40:10] image John Force's that God is a spirit
[40:14] and he had to make a spirit man and he
[40:18] brought it down now there's deity cannot
[40:23] be seen deity is the supernatural then
[40:27] he brings it down from a sacred halo to
[40:30] a little white cloud something that's
[40:32] more visible that's man now man is not a
[40:35] white cloud not all right this is for
[40:38] illustration purposes only we were made
[40:41] in the image of God Glide never was a
[40:44] cloud but for illustration purposes what
[40:48] got what brother branham showing us if I
[40:50] may remember brother Branham saw that
[40:54] what that halo of light right remember
[40:58] the halo that was over his head he said
[41:01] what that's you angel the Covenant
[41:02] that's Christ right amen
[41:05] that wasn't just some different angel
[41:06] that was Christ amen and then the pillar
[41:09] of fire the burning bush run the burning
[41:14] bush if Moses would have had a true
[41:16] revelation like Paul did Paul saw a
[41:19] light but he saw Jesus Amen because of
[41:22] the revelation he had Moses in
[41:24] Revelation was not at the moment that
[41:26] God was a human man at that moment you
[41:29] understand me so God sends a pillar of
[41:31] fire - what - hide himself but God
[41:37] Himself Jesus Christ was standing in
[41:39] that pillar of fire in that burning bush
[41:42] but Moses is revelation had not
[41:44] progressed to that point yet because
[41:47] remember it will because finally Moses
[41:49] is going to say God I want to see who
[41:51] you really are
[41:51] right and what did he show him he showed
[41:54] in that theophany he
[41:55] showed him the back part of a human
[41:57] mortal man that was coming now that he
[42:02] wasn't mortal at that time but he was
[42:03] coming to be mortal he was coming to be
[42:05] Jesus Christ right all right so out of
[42:07] this halo of light step two one
[42:11] I'm sorry banane I'm not an artist but
[42:16] look but out of that halo out of that
[42:18] revelation that God is this big board
[42:23] ten billion miles that way and ten
[42:25] billion miles that way and don't even
[42:27] cover his fingernail all right
[42:29] but for illustration purposes how many
[42:31] times am I gonna say that illustration
[42:32] purposes this is God eternal that you
[42:35] can't see don't know no man has seen the
[42:38] father but something has declared him
[42:41] there is something that is making him
[42:43] manifest and what is it it's just low
[42:47] Gauss that comes out he comes out of
[42:50] this halo but remember he always loves
[42:53] back near the same person he is right
[42:55] here that all right but for me and you
[42:58] now prophet is trying to explain it to
[42:59] us so we have to go by brother Branham I
[43:02] believe he saw this by supernatural life
[43:05] he had to see it first and then we see
[43:07] it because he gets what the prophet
[43:09] catches a revelation from God then what
[43:11] he delivers it to the people
[43:12] amen so he delivers it to the people
[43:15] that's why we needed a prophet in the
[43:16] end time no one know Billy Graham as
[43:19] great as he was no Laurel Roberts as
[43:20] great as he was no hey Allen and all the
[43:23] great ones of the ones that were back in
[43:26] the 50s and 40s and even Smith
[43:28] Wigglesworth people that had a wonderful
[43:29] revelation of God they weren't a prophet
[43:33] so God couldn't speak to them the way he
[43:36] spoke to that prophet William Branham
[43:38] that conduit that comes straight from
[43:41] God right to brother Branham no one in
[43:43] between there's no other prophet there's
[43:46] no other somebody can stand here and go
[43:48] you were wrong God you only one that can
[43:51] correct the Prophet and then so a
[43:54] prophet gets it straight from God but
[43:56] what's his job his job is then to what
[43:58] put it out to the people through
[44:01] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[44:03] evangelists to bring that and break it
[44:05] down to the people okay he just he give
[44:08] us the big
[44:09] I guess and then we take and break them
[44:12] into little nuggets
[44:12] so the logos is what what we say the
[44:16] logos was it was the speech our let me
[44:21] draw this a little different right here
[44:23] this is what I like
[44:25] I don't looking see it in the back was
[44:31] that side that's the word I'm going to
[44:34] read it right here brother mom says that
[44:36] was the word the logos was the word
[44:39] because what is the word the word has to
[44:41] be spoken the word can lay on the pages
[44:44] for an eternity but once it's in
[44:46] somebody and they're able to speak it
[44:48] because this man is going to start
[44:51] creating that all right this man is
[44:54] going to start creating so he's got to
[44:56] what speak all right so listen let's
[44:59] just keep going right here he brought it
[45:04] down now there's dead he cannot be seen
[45:05] deity just supernatural then he brings
[45:08] it down from a sacred halo to a little
[45:10] white cloud something that's more
[45:11] visible that's man he give him the
[45:14] rulership over the kingdom all right so
[45:19] now he governs the Beast just like the
[45:21] Holy Spirit leads the church today
[45:23] let's keep and there's where science
[45:26] gets mixed up let's finish he might give
[45:29] him a face like a chimpanzee you might
[45:30] give him a foot like a bear but God put
[45:32] a soul in a man I was telling you this
[45:35] morning I heard a minister the other day
[45:37] which did a real good job and he said
[45:41] the love of God the true love of God was
[45:45] giving you a choice think about that you
[45:48] think of that so profound you think the
[45:51] love of God will be I'm going to save
[45:53] everybody and I don't care what you
[45:54] think and you're just going to do this
[45:56] all your life I'm a child of God I'm a
[46:00] child of God move I'm a child of God
[46:02] move what love is that what love is in
[46:07] that no that's not love that's more of a
[46:10] demanding no but what greater love for
[46:13] God to say I'm going to put you on the
[46:14] earth and you got a choice love me or
[46:18] hate me
[46:20] to me that's the greatest letter there
[46:23] was is that he gave us a choice what and
[46:25] the only reason we have a choice the
[46:28] animals don't have a choice because they
[46:30] don't have a soul man has a soul to make
[46:34] a choice between right and wrong and
[46:37] then so that soul of God you see where
[46:40] I'm going
[46:40] so that soul of God comes out and what
[46:43] he begins to speak all right now watch
[46:47] and there's where science gets all mixed
[46:50] up what was I know if they're tough
[46:52] we're good God put a soul in a man this
[46:57] white cloud deity came down not in the
[47:01] animal in the man and now if you want to
[47:04] go back and dig up some old bones let
[47:06] them dig as many thing one two all the
[47:08] fossils that doesn't have a thing to do
[47:10] on the burying of the word of God there
[47:13] is there's no Bigfoot we had an
[47:18] experience this weekend we'll tell you
[47:20] about it later maybe or this week didn't
[47:23] know that Bigfoot was in Georgia I
[47:25] didn't know we had a Georgia Bigfoot but
[47:28] daddy told them where it was at then the
[47:31] second accession snake but here's this
[47:34] man and now man sinned now watch how
[47:37] they said this is what I've been looking
[47:39] for for awhile and when he sinned and
[47:41] fell then that little cloud in there
[47:44] became marred in blackness Iran he
[47:46] didn't take the cloud out here there's
[47:50] no way once God gave Adam eternal life
[47:52] there's no way God could take it back
[47:55] now I like what one brother said he God
[47:59] cannot God cannot break your
[48:03] relationship but he can break those
[48:12] Adam did not lose his relationship the
[48:16] Bible says in the Book of Luke that Adam
[48:18] was a son of God he did not become a son
[48:21] of God when he failed no he didn't lose
[48:24] his relationship he lost his fellowship
[48:26] hey man that's the same way with you and
[48:29] I we lost fellowship we lost the
[48:31] closeness of God
[48:33] come down and brought us back into that
[48:35] what fellowship but look that little
[48:38] cloud in there became marred and black
[48:41] then the logos came down and was made
[48:44] flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this
[48:46] man back to the love of the Father and
[48:49] he came in by what the baptism of the
[48:52] Holy Spirit I'm going to get to this a
[48:53] little bit later and chase sin out of
[48:56] the human amen
[48:58] chase sin out of the human and brings
[49:01] men back again again in fellowship with
[49:04] God you believe that a man
[49:08] but he became marred and black what
[49:10] there was something that was without the
[49:12] Adam had total control over everything
[49:17] total control amen but once he sinned
[49:21] there was a mark or a Mar that was that
[49:24] was covering that and like I said before
[49:26] you you know we were born in sin shaping
[49:29] an iniquity sponsored my mother's womb
[49:31] the liar what the Bible says right but
[49:35] there was a representation in heaven
[49:38] that covered us a man and God came down
[49:43] remember brother I'm saying Jesus didn't
[49:46] come to bring you what he had come to
[49:48] bring you that he come to make a way to
[49:51] get back to that and then good Jesus
[49:54] didn't bring you in inheritance no
[49:57] brother Brown said no no is an adoption
[49:59] series he said no no Jesus didn't come
[50:02] to bring you inheritance your
[50:03] inheritance was before the foundation of
[50:05] the world
[50:06] a man preserved in him I like that word
[50:09] preserved
[50:10] remember if you preserve a pickle get I
[50:12] mean a cucumber remember it turns into a
[50:14] pickle right but the pickle can never go
[50:17] back to being a cucumber yet it looks
[50:19] like one yet it looks you're like one
[50:21] but it can go back it's been what it's
[50:24] been preserved all right same way with
[50:26] you and I you believe that say ma'am
[50:28] number three number three cruelty of sin
[50:34] and the penalty that it costs to rid sin
[50:36] from our lives jeffersonville everybody
[50:38] all right say man so he couldn't just
[50:41] leave it in that state he had to leave
[50:43] something with it in other words he's
[50:46] talking about the animal
[50:47] so he said let us plural make man plural
[50:51] in our image let us make man in our
[50:53] image so when then when God made his
[50:56] first man alright watch this when God
[51:00] made his first man he was a spirit man
[51:01] he was something on the order of God or
[51:05] the Son of God the logos that was the
[51:10] first man now remember what was glow God
[51:13] slow gotcha is a word its speech for
[51:20] those of you can't see that it says let
[51:22] there be right that's your Creator the
[51:28] word created everything that's why the
[51:31] Bible says Jesus Christ not Jesus the
[51:33] flash Jesus Christ was the creator god
[51:36] he was the one that created the word was
[51:38] before the foundation of the world if
[51:40] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[51:42] of the world then the book was already
[51:43] written and then in the mind of God but
[51:46] what to develop this picture so that you
[51:49] and I can understand God so we can
[51:53] understand God this eternal thing that
[51:55] we can't understand because he doesn't
[51:57] know he just can't be understood but
[52:00] thank God he's brought us a part that we
[52:03] can't understand that we can see by the
[52:05] eye of faith that he steps out of this
[52:08] this great all the attributes like
[52:11] brother they was talking this morning
[52:12] all those attributes all those titles he
[52:15] comes down and you can bring it down to
[52:17] one word and it's word you can bring it
[52:21] down to word word it's where you begin
[52:24] and word is there's no end but word is
[52:27] where the logos comes out and he's right
[52:30] here now remember this is still your
[52:34] Genesis one sustainer good money this is
[52:38] still that Genesis 1:26 man she's back
[52:41] there somewhere this Genesis 1:26 man is
[52:45] the Word of God
[52:46] it's the logos its Christ it's the Holy
[52:50] Ghost we're going to put a few more in
[52:51] there just a minute which is the titles
[52:53] memory has one name see this is kind of
[52:55] connecting in what brother Dale he's got
[52:57] one name but now it's name what in Jesus
[53:00] right here
[53:00] but now in the mind of God it was in the
[53:03] mind of God he never developed the name
[53:05] Jesus four thousand years after this
[53:07] only all watched Jesus he always what
[53:10] Hebrews 13:8 Jesus Christ what the same
[53:13] yesterday today and forever amen
[53:17] general writes Amen let us make man in
[53:22] our image so then when God made his
[53:24] first man he was a spirit man he was
[53:27] something on the order of God or the Son
[53:29] of God the logos that was the first man
[53:32] now remember let me finish reading this
[53:35] and let me come in then he gave the men
[53:37] jurisdiction over to lead all animal
[53:40] life just like the Holy Spirit leads to
[53:43] believer today
[53:44] now look watch what he says right here I
[53:46] didn't read it but I should have now if
[53:48] we were perfect in submission to the
[53:51] Holy Spirit now God would lead us by the
[53:55] Holy Spirit just like Adam led the
[53:57] animals up that day that's what we're
[53:59] going back to and in the property God we
[54:02] saw it when here we've seen it we're
[54:04] nature it's what controlled by what a
[54:06] man says a man right here nature was
[54:09] controlled by what man says amen number
[54:16] four we've read this for many many times
[54:19] questions and answers on Genesis
[54:23] now God created man in his own image in
[54:26] his own likeness what kind of man did he
[54:28] create a spirit man now if you'll notice
[54:31] now I want you to notice right here I
[54:34] haven't made another person there's only
[54:39] one person in this Godhead okay I
[54:43] haven't made another person but we don't
[54:45] have to bring him out and show how he
[54:48] condescends down to not another person
[54:52] but himself in another form so I'm going
[54:55] to leave that one man standing right
[54:56] there hey man oh okay amen
[55:00] because we're not going to do away with
[55:02] it we're not going to do away with this
[55:04] blackboard I mean just whiteboard
[55:05] collapse the Eternal Father God that's
[55:07] one you can't see you can't understand
[55:09] now we're going to try to develop them
[55:10] to where we can see them and understand
[55:12] it that Alright
[55:14] now God created man is own image no like
[55:17] this what kind of man is he created
[55:18] spirit man now if you'll notice after he
[55:22] had made all the creation and created a
[55:24] spirit man the close reading of this now
[55:25] is the one that asks the question will
[55:27] find this that God gave the million of
[55:30] the cattle and fish and everything to
[55:31] the man but in his making up there he
[55:34] made man in his own image to lead the
[55:36] cattle lead the beasts of the field just
[55:38] like the Holy Spirit leads to believer
[55:40] today so Adam in other words Adam the
[55:42] first man in the Lord creation of God
[55:44] I'm not going to draw another man I'm
[55:49] not going to draw another man because
[55:52] when a for Adam wasn't dead now we got
[55:54] to put a flesh man in here now we got to
[55:56] do that because the Adam went into the
[55:58] offering he went into a flesh man right
[56:00] but we're not going to it right now
[56:02] because Adam had no limitation does the
[56:08] Holy Spirit have limitation because the
[56:10] Holy Spirit can be speaking to me today
[56:12] it can be speaking to somebody in
[56:14] Africans at the same time he's in
[56:16] another dimension and it's way faster
[56:18] than this one and I am so thankful you
[56:21] know brother Chris long is right memory
[56:22] preached here and he's going to do our
[56:24] wax night service he has been studying
[56:26] on dimension so me and him we had we
[56:29] were beating the tables we thought we
[56:31] got mad at each other but we wasn't we
[56:33] were just shouting at the things that he
[56:35] saw in the things I saw we kind of put
[56:36] them together you know some so God is in
[56:39] a faster dimension we're in the slowest
[56:43] dimension of all 1 2 & 3 we think we'd
[56:46] travel fast forget it this is the
[56:49] slowest God will ever get when he walks
[56:51] in this dimension
[56:52] I believe when Melchizedek came down he
[56:55] said man this is slow whoo but he's so
[56:59] fast he can talk to me and he can talk
[57:01] to you and he can talk to somebody in
[57:03] Africa in the same instant why he has no
[57:06] time he has no tribal limitations we
[57:09] have a life light and matter limitation
[57:12] and man even though how fast we want to
[57:15] go and like Einstein like brother Dale
[57:18] said well it's already been proven
[57:19] because look radio waves are coming
[57:21] through this building right now without
[57:23] a hole being made sorry folks but
[57:27] are travelling through this through this
[57:29] place right to the wall going right out
[57:32] that wall going up here with no
[57:34] limitation why they're in a faster
[57:36] dimension hey man so maybe we need to
[57:38] start thinking more in a faster
[57:40] dimension hey man that alright say man
[57:45] because when Jesus I believe when he
[57:48] came back he was in that seventh
[57:49] dimension
[57:51] he had a glorified body he had a he had
[57:54] a body that was as solid as this wood
[57:56] and he just steps to the wall now how
[57:59] fast is that we think well something
[58:02] that's the spirit can just flow right
[58:04] through the wall what about a man that
[58:05] stepped through the wall and walks in
[58:07] and says give me a piece of fish and he
[58:11] puts it in his mouth and they don't hit
[58:12] the floor it goes somewhere there's some
[58:16] substance after he walks through there
[58:18] why he was in another dimension hey man
[58:21] we'll get into that not today but it
[58:25] didn't help how that God you know puts
[58:27] people together he was in other words
[58:29] Adam the first man in the Lord creations
[58:31] of God the first creation was God
[58:33] Himself was random God Himself a
[58:39] creation anything is created has to have
[58:43] an end brother
[58:44] no no we just did it right here we just
[58:50] did it right here that's the beginning
[58:52] of the creation of God that's the part
[58:55] of God that we have to understand in
[58:57] this dimension that God is now showing
[59:00] himself ascend remember the word
[59:03] creation God created man in his own
[59:08] image listen if we were created in at
[59:10] the beginning then we got to have an end
[59:12] so that word creation is not exactly
[59:15] like we're talking about that creation
[59:17] word that we're looking at it's just
[59:19] like a car a car was created but what's
[59:25] in the car rubber from the ground or
[59:28] iron or from the ground hello
[59:32] plastic from the ground everything what
[59:35] brother Brown said what TV cars written
[59:37] or in the Garden of Eden wife
[59:41] substance that it was made from will hey
[59:43] the substance that we were made from
[59:45] hello somebody the substance that we
[59:48] were made from always was here and then
[59:51] it just developed so that we could see
[59:54] because the words eternal the Bible
[59:56] wasn't written thousand years ago the
[59:59] Bible was before there ever was the
[1:00:01] Bible was Word was with God and the Word
[1:00:05] was God and then the Word was made flesh
[1:00:08] so that word was already in place before
[1:00:14] anything so the word is eternal hey man
[1:00:24] it just developed so we can understand
[1:00:26] God a little bit faster amen why do you
[1:00:29] think we're going to have a message of
[1:00:30] cheer Lord we can't understand this what
[1:00:33] about what about when we get into an
[1:00:35] unlimited unlimited dimension to where
[1:00:38] it's not going to bother us for time and
[1:00:41] we get to sitting around talking about
[1:00:42] God Wow
[1:00:45] the first creation was God Himself then
[1:00:48] out of God came to logano we're looking
[1:00:52] here the logos is what the speech right
[1:00:54] there by all right which was the son of
[1:00:57] God then out of the logos
[1:00:59] watch out of the logos which was the
[1:01:01] word in the beginning was the word
[1:01:04] wherewith garden word was God and the
[1:01:06] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[1:01:08] we know where it went out of the logos
[1:01:10] came forth the man now we got to bring
[1:01:12] another word in here
[1:01:20] because that's the body the word
[1:01:25] theophany we'll look at it DeMint Theo
[1:01:27] is always God vanian is actually the
[1:01:32] Latin word and it means to show so to
[1:01:38] show God is that theophany amen so what
[1:01:45] we're doing we're taking something that
[1:01:46] you can't see and you can't understand
[1:01:48] and we're showing God
[1:01:51] to who me and you we're showing God
[1:01:55] we're bringing now the word is in body
[1:01:58] form that alright you don't believe it
[1:02:01] I'm gonna read it because right here
[1:02:02] brother Graham said so not my reasoning
[1:02:05] a lot of the logos came forth the man
[1:02:08] let's-- treating this read number five
[1:02:10] questions and answers still in Genesis
[1:02:13] next one there you go and no one has
[1:02:17] seen God and now the next thing we begin
[1:02:19] to see roll it up to the top this is
[1:02:21] where I caught my eyes of supernatural
[1:02:24] looking so now we got two supernaturally
[1:02:26] look at all this mess that I've made
[1:02:27] here on the board all right we see a
[1:02:30] little white light forming out there one
[1:02:33] is it that was called by Bible readers
[1:02:34] the logos are what they were anointed
[1:02:37] which is Christ a lot of titles to this
[1:02:42] person huh the anointed are the
[1:02:47] anointing or the as I was going to say
[1:02:51] the part of God begins to develop into
[1:02:53] something so he can see who he was know
[1:02:58] something so humans so his children in
[1:03:02] other words his children can see where
[1:03:04] we come from what we're doing here where
[1:03:07] we're going and then something so human
[1:03:09] beings could have some type of an idea
[1:03:12] now he didn't say we know all of God he
[1:03:15] said we just have some little idea of
[1:03:17] who God is it was a little a little
[1:03:20] light moving that was the work dot
[1:03:23] number six the great mighty conquer in
[1:03:25] 1957
[1:03:28] now if you'll if you'll understand where
[1:03:30] I'm going in 1957 brother Ram doesn't
[1:03:33] used to work the
[1:03:34] until 1957 so some part of his
[1:03:37] revelation had come to a spot to where
[1:03:39] he he understood more all a prophet yeah
[1:03:43] a prophet the Bible said Jesus learned
[1:03:46] by the things he suffered and was made
[1:03:48] perfect and then so brother Branham had
[1:03:52] progressive his revelation progressed he
[1:03:54] went 1957 he starts talking about a
[1:03:57] theophany but right here let's see in
[1:04:00] 1957 in 421 then we'll continue on then
[1:04:04] he came he came down because he was in
[1:04:06] the beginning the Bible said he was to
[1:04:07] work he was the logos that went out of
[1:04:10] God and the logos in the beginning was
[1:04:13] the word so we're establishing now that
[1:04:15] this is the word of God the logos is the
[1:04:17] Word of God if some big words if they
[1:04:20] use logos is really not a big word it's
[1:04:22] only four letters
[1:04:22] pablor but it's a big word if you don't
[1:04:28] have revelation but in the speech part
[1:04:32] it's just a word to go it's the Word of
[1:04:33] God if when God steps out and begins to
[1:04:37] speak let there be
[1:04:39] that's the Creator God he had to have a
[1:04:41] speech remember brother Branham said
[1:04:43] Moses he had a thought then when he
[1:04:47] spoke it it was that thought expressed
[1:04:49] that's the same thing what God God had
[1:04:51] these thoughts and playing in his mind
[1:04:53] before there ever was anything but it
[1:04:56] didn't come to fruition until he was
[1:04:58] spoken amen there's the beginning of the
[1:05:03] creation of God that's when God was
[1:05:05] created was when he comes in speech we
[1:05:08] know it was created in the womb of a
[1:05:09] woman we know that but the God that we
[1:05:12] know don't have a beginning but there is
[1:05:15] a time of creation or a forming where we
[1:05:20] can see him now remember not for his
[1:05:22] sake Crower all right and lifts and
[1:05:26] brothers and sisters if there was a
[1:05:27] different way to bring it he would have
[1:05:30] made it but when he brought it through
[1:05:32] brother Branham he brought it through
[1:05:33] the Prophet to show us who God was and
[1:05:36] to show us remember the property God
[1:05:37] said when the seals break it what it
[1:05:39] shows you what where you come from what
[1:05:42] you're doing here and where you're going
[1:05:44] and Mansell if you're showing us where
[1:05:46] we came from
[1:05:47] what we're doing here and where we're
[1:05:49] going that all right say Amen the logos
[1:05:53] in the beginning was the word now number
[1:05:55] seven thirsting for life the logos that
[1:05:58] went out of God is no disregard to
[1:06:00] calculate people and I wanted one is
[1:06:03] kind of just paraphrase this for you
[1:06:06] talking about the Father Son and Holy
[1:06:08] Ghost brother Brown was telling them
[1:06:09] that a son had a beginning now you can
[1:06:13] get real messed up with that because
[1:06:15] remember this is the son of God he just
[1:06:20] said that this is the son of God but not
[1:06:23] the Son of God second person of the
[1:06:25] Trinity okay that all right
[1:06:27] that's not eternal sonship eternal
[1:06:30] sonship would be that that son that
[1:06:32] they're talking about no no this son of
[1:06:36] God is eternal a man but right here
[1:06:41] brother Brown says ah now wait a man had
[1:06:42] a beginning or has no end son means how
[1:06:45] the beginning so that ain't the same son
[1:06:47] he's talking about that all right
[1:06:49] it could be an eternal god ship but
[1:06:53] never an eternal sonship a son is one
[1:06:56] that lets be got enough so it had a
[1:06:58] beginning art goes o'clock and tool oh
[1:07:00] gosh which was the son of God went out
[1:07:03] created by these great fountains of
[1:07:05] purity excuse me God is those spirits
[1:07:08] went out and it created the low God
[1:07:11] listen it formed remember it didn't
[1:07:16] create this was not a created being
[1:07:18] this always was or it did have a
[1:07:22] beginning but to develop into what we
[1:07:25] want to see to what you and I want to
[1:07:27] see this Genesis 1:26 minutes it had to
[1:07:30] come in a form that week that we could
[1:07:31] that me and you can look at each other
[1:07:34] and we can see God Amen alright and it
[1:07:39] was a body it was in the form of what we
[1:07:42] are now which is called in the clergy
[1:07:45] way of speaking at the oppening now the
[1:07:48] theophany is what I just told you it was
[1:07:50] see often in the Oh means God and banan
[1:07:54] means to show show it's to show God the
[1:07:56] way to show God is through the theophany
[1:07:59] okay
[1:08:01] and not that gods over here and he's got
[1:08:04] a theophany God isn't the offer man God
[1:08:09] is not part of the word God is the word
[1:08:12] in the beginning with the word we're
[1:08:14] because that's why Jesus was the
[1:08:15] fullness of the Godhead bottle he was
[1:08:17] all these things and then that all right
[1:08:20] now where was I oh here we go 813 lets
[1:08:28] going down to here it's a body that
[1:08:30] doesn't let's read this for him it was a
[1:08:32] body that does it easy it was a bunny
[1:08:35] that doesn't have a spirit in it it's a
[1:08:37] body that's waiting for you Christians
[1:08:39] as soon as the life leaves this you go
[1:08:41] into that body and when this earthly
[1:08:43] time and I could be dissolved
[1:08:44] we have an already waiting a theophany
[1:08:46] know we'll touch on that in just a
[1:08:47] minute now raise it up now when God was
[1:08:50] in theophany which was Christ in the
[1:08:53] making we got he still we got our words
[1:08:58] here all right we got theophany over
[1:09:01] here we got the logo same person Christ
[1:09:05] same person
[1:09:06] Holy Ghost same person that all right
[1:09:10] but now remember Adam wasn't the
[1:09:14] fullness of the Godhead bodily he was
[1:09:21] part of it but he wasn't the person of
[1:09:25] God if he was he could have saved even
[1:09:27] saved the human race but he could not
[1:09:29] right he could not save the human race
[1:09:32] in other words he couldn't give his life
[1:09:34] and it go back into a believer and make
[1:09:37] them right
[1:09:38] God Almighty on the one who can do that
[1:09:40] but we'll get to that myth when God was
[1:09:42] in theophany which was Christ in the
[1:09:44] making then that theophany became flesh
[1:09:47] and dwelt among us that was to redeem he
[1:09:50] came from there down through this to
[1:09:55] redeem this creature give it life and
[1:09:57] take it back up into the turtle one amen
[1:10:01] jesus said I come from God and I go back
[1:10:06] to God he was the creator right he came
[1:10:11] down in this dimension for one purpose
[1:10:13] and that was to redeem
[1:10:14] that had failed that that had failed all
[1:10:17] right that all right say man
[1:10:19] alright now let's read this now right
[1:10:24] here now when these great lights went
[1:10:26] out or great rays of spirit love peace
[1:10:28] that's all there was there wasn't no
[1:10:31] suffering there wasn't no hate no malice
[1:10:35] it couldn't come from this fountain that
[1:10:38] was Jehovah that was your hope of God
[1:10:40] now hold on a minute we can put Jehovah
[1:10:42] God in this hey man that was Jehovah God
[1:10:45] and now as the theologians call it a
[1:10:48] theophany went from that which was
[1:10:51] called in the scriptural tool Oh God so
[1:10:53] the logos is the speech that he often is
[1:10:56] the body that Alright that the often is
[1:10:59] the body the logos is the speech so he
[1:11:03] says right here and now that the oldest
[1:11:05] call that theophany went from that which
[1:11:07] was called in the scriptural the logos
[1:11:09] the logos that went out of God it's hard
[1:11:11] to explain but it was a part of God I'm
[1:11:17] just telling you what prophet said it's
[1:11:20] hard to explain but I believe with the
[1:11:24] Holy Ghost you can understand so now
[1:11:27] let's go to the next let's go to where I
[1:11:30] was just telling you the word origin and
[1:11:32] history of theophany the operating come
[1:11:34] from a Latin word field fornia from
[1:11:36] Greek Stephanie from cos God and finanza
[1:11:42] show so that's that's what we said to
[1:11:44] show God is the theophany body all right
[1:11:47] if I got that same man all right to show
[1:11:50] God let's get some of this
[1:11:53] I hate erasing God but we're going to
[1:11:57] erase a little bit of it because we get
[1:11:59] to get the the essence of what we're
[1:12:02] doing is everybody all right
[1:12:03] this Genesis 1:26 man is not just some
[1:12:06] something that we we talk about and I
[1:12:09] guess I've done it too we just kind of
[1:12:11] throw it to the side and said well
[1:12:12] everybody ought to understand what that
[1:12:13] is but but maybe by some of these
[1:12:16] questions that that we have is that we
[1:12:19] see that that truly that that this
[1:12:22] Genesis 1:26 man was the part of God we
[1:12:26] know that
[1:12:27] a man the characteristic of God this
[1:12:32] Genesis 1:26 man's the Word of God amen
[1:12:36] it's in the Word of God and let them
[1:12:40] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:12:41] and found their that's what we're
[1:12:42] heading toward in eternity
[1:12:44] amen if they would have stayed in that
[1:12:46] state it would have been any Turnitin
[1:12:48] there would never been a fall but we
[1:12:49] know that's not going to happen because
[1:12:51] inside this word is a healer inside this
[1:12:56] word is a savior inside this word is the
[1:13:00] Redeemer the Rose of Sharon lily of the
[1:13:03] valley we can call him lily of the
[1:13:05] valley planta been lost
[1:13:07] those are redemptive nays all those
[1:13:09] names are names it that let's just put
[1:13:14] it this way God we know look down
[1:13:18] through time by foreknowledge he saw all
[1:13:20] this happen I do not believe that God
[1:13:23] put us through a tube and shot us
[1:13:24] through and that's the way we're
[1:13:26] supposed to be I just told you that God
[1:13:28] give us a choice amen
[1:13:30] but being what being this eternal God
[1:13:34] that knows the end from the beginning
[1:13:37] look down through time and for knew by
[1:13:43] foreknowledge he knew what the end would
[1:13:47] be knew what choice look he knew Adam
[1:13:51] would make this choice not this one
[1:13:55] he knew one hour would make this choice
[1:13:58] he comes down here and he knows what
[1:13:59] choice you would make so he could
[1:14:02] predestined predestination
[1:14:04] if the destiny determined beforehand why
[1:14:10] can he do it before him because of
[1:14:12] foreknowledge I like that word because
[1:14:15] of foreknowledge not that God made us do
[1:14:18] this he did not make Adam fall but he
[1:14:22] knew if he put that 1:26 man which was
[1:14:25] purity the Holy Ghost now the Holy Ghost
[1:14:28] can fall but when you put that man into
[1:14:32] a human flesh and the mole if all
[1:14:40] this is all white right we fell but Adam
[1:14:49] didn't follow him so he couldn't there's
[1:14:53] no way he could I just told you in the
[1:14:57] quote brother Ram said he put that
[1:14:58] immortal being inside of that man that's
[1:15:02] enough for me that's enough for me
[1:15:05] whatever you want believe your your
[1:15:06] business but in Seoul Adam was the Sun
[1:15:09] bright the Bible calls Adam son of God I
[1:15:12] don't have to get to find a quote
[1:15:14] I'll get who's read the Bible and lose
[1:15:15] and listen he was the only Son of God in
[1:15:20] the Old Testament that all right we're
[1:15:23] going to get to that in just a second
[1:15:25] cuz we're going to draw that a little
[1:15:26] bit further but I want you to see this
[1:15:29] where was I number eight let's go to
[1:15:31] number eight I want to read a few of
[1:15:32] these we will stop we will see Jesus
[1:15:37] 1957 like I said 1957 brother Evan start
[1:15:39] talking about logo I mean talks about
[1:15:41] theophany he brings the off in the end
[1:15:43] talks about logos in 1949 but he comes
[1:15:45] up and sees that that logos being the
[1:15:48] speech that there was a body there God's
[1:15:50] got a body God's not got a body God
[1:15:53] hears the body ma'am Thank You Jeanne I
[1:15:56] need it so when she smiled I knew that's
[1:15:58] what I should have said start with thank
[1:16:00] you and the low guys that went out of
[1:16:02] God in the beginning became become what
[1:16:05] we would call a theophany
[1:16:07] are a supernatural body God is not like
[1:16:11] the air y'all heard that somewhere
[1:16:13] before this morning a couple hours ago
[1:16:15] but he's in a body
[1:16:18] Moses seen in past and said it looked
[1:16:20] like the back part of a man and so forth
[1:16:22] and when that same theophany was made
[1:16:25] flesh that same theophany and dwelt
[1:16:28] among us and we beheld him the only
[1:16:30] begotten of the Father Christ amen that
[1:16:34] all right
[1:16:35] that was him that was demand alright
[1:16:41] let's go to what number was that eight
[1:16:43] let's go to nine and then we'll stop
[1:16:45] right here real quick number nine
[1:16:46] hebrews chapter one
[1:16:47] now if you want to if you want to really
[1:16:49] read about the oppening in the hebrew
[1:16:51] series brother groundcovers theophany
[1:16:53] more
[1:16:53] in that one group of sermons then he
[1:16:57] covers the whole time he bring he in
[1:16:59] this Hebrew series
[1:17:00] now here's what happened oh excuse me I
[1:17:03] just get on this this just gets me right
[1:17:05] where I love it
[1:17:06] me too the logos in this great fountain
[1:17:09] this great fountain of spirit which had
[1:17:11] no beginning or no end this great spirit
[1:17:13] began to form in the creation and the
[1:17:16] logos that went out from it was the son
[1:17:18] of God
[1:17:19] we've already told you that right right
[1:17:21] it was the only visible form that the
[1:17:25] Spirit had so he must be bringing
[1:17:28] something visible that we can see and it
[1:17:31] was a theophany which means a body and
[1:17:34] the body was like a man just like what
[1:17:38] we're talking about right here all right
[1:17:39] now the only problem we have with this
[1:17:44] in drawing is that that one Fiat any man
[1:17:51] covers all of Christendom and I can't
[1:17:56] draw that because you can have you know
[1:18:00] you can you can have 10 billion little
[1:18:02] little born-again believers but it comes
[1:18:07] from at one body and it is that one body
[1:18:10] so you can't really draw that you can't
[1:18:12] you can't draw a multiple of God you
[1:18:16] just can't because brother Ram say the
[1:18:18] oneness with God he said he said true
[1:18:20] oneness is God and Adam and Eve in the
[1:18:23] Garden of Eden well now if you and I
[1:18:25] look at that and walk up to that
[1:18:26] situation we're going to see three
[1:18:28] people but in God's eyes true oneness
[1:18:32] was God able to walk right up to Adam
[1:18:34] and Eve and feel the oneness and nothing
[1:18:37] between no fear just like what we're
[1:18:40] going back to you think we're going to
[1:18:41] go to the you think we're going to go to
[1:18:43] the Millennium and when jesus walks up
[1:18:44] we're gonna go no no no no no you're
[1:18:50] going to want to never leave exciting
[1:18:52] you're going to want to never leave that
[1:18:55] man hey man
[1:18:57] so let's don't be scared that's the
[1:18:59] first thing item said Adam said I was
[1:19:01] afraid he'd never said that before he'd
[1:19:04] never been fear that feared that God
[1:19:06] would walk why something had changed
[1:19:10] something had changed he knew he had
[1:19:12] done something wrong and then I look
[1:19:16] Moses saw it when it passed by the rock
[1:19:18] looked at it it looked like a hind part
[1:19:21] of a man it's the same type of body that
[1:19:25] we received when we got here it deserves
[1:19:28] time and I could be dissolved we have
[1:19:30] one already waiting that was it that was
[1:19:32] the theophany which was the son of God
[1:19:34] that son that logos became flesh
[1:19:37] so all this right here that's why like I
[1:19:39] said he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:19:41] bodily Father Son and Holy Ghost the
[1:19:44] word the logos the speaks the Holy Ghost
[1:19:46] anointing the Creator all was in Jesus
[1:19:50] Christ amen that's why he was the
[1:19:54] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:19:55] it's a certain time when I could be
[1:19:57] dissolved we have one already waiting
[1:20:00] that was it and that was the theophany
[1:20:02] which was the son of God that son that
[1:20:04] logos became flesh because we were put
[1:20:07] in flesh the only reason Jesus came in
[1:20:11] flash is because we were put in place
[1:20:13] pretty simple
[1:20:15] amen and the theophany the logos became
[1:20:20] flesh here among us and it was nothing
[1:20:23] else but the dwelling place for that
[1:20:25] entire fountain dwelt in him all right
[1:20:31] let's go to number 10 and now the low
[1:20:34] guys that went out of God nothing
[1:20:35] finished still in Hebrew series that was
[1:20:37] the logos all this began to form into a
[1:20:40] body shape and this body shape was
[1:20:42] called in the scholars teaching low God
[1:20:44] the logos that went out of God in other
[1:20:46] words a better word for it now he see
[1:20:48] his devout he sees something developing
[1:20:50] in other words a better word for it was
[1:20:53] what we call a theophany
[1:20:54] now watch this real close watch this
[1:20:59] wake up
[1:21:02] jocks turn this one oh I'm just couldn't
[1:21:05] don't do this don't do that I'm not that
[1:21:07] mean not yet the operon is a human body
[1:21:10] that's glorified now hold on a minute
[1:21:14] yeah you got a hold on we gotta watch
[1:21:16] this write it but look he corrects it
[1:21:23] not exactly with flesh and blood like it
[1:21:28] will be in its glorified stage got it
[1:21:34] the option is a human body that's
[1:21:37] glorified now I agree there's not a the
[1:21:40] glorification of the body is de flesh
[1:21:43] why do you need a theophany glorified it
[1:21:47] is the glorification and then the
[1:21:49] theophany this listen this never fell
[1:21:54] this this theophany is the reason we can
[1:21:59] go back to the eternal so there's no way
[1:22:03] it can fall that Genesis 1:26 man cannot
[1:22:07] fall it is the Word of God but I'm just
[1:22:11] telling you what brother M said remember
[1:22:14] I told you you got to read through your
[1:22:16] filter not exactly with flesh and blood
[1:22:20] like it will be in his glorified stage
[1:22:22] but it is of a form of human body now
[1:22:26] watch him correctly because remember
[1:22:28] when he went across the curtain of time
[1:22:29] this is three years before he went
[1:22:30] across the curtain of time he always
[1:22:33] thought here that you could pass through
[1:22:35] each other there was nothing solid right
[1:22:37] brother Neville how you doing you a
[1:22:39] cloud that was the old lifestyle we
[1:22:41] always had him grandma always told us if
[1:22:43] we're going to go up on heaven go to
[1:22:44] heaven set on the cloud and play a heart
[1:22:46] and we're going to just float buying
[1:22:48] gold hey brother did my that's not
[1:22:52] fellowship that's not God but when he
[1:22:56] was going across the curtain time what'd
[1:22:57] he say he said those people were real
[1:23:01] they had what they had something solid
[1:23:05] remember he hugged women and he must
[1:23:08] have been able to hug them to know that
[1:23:09] they were so there was solid right
[1:23:15] but it is over a form of a human body
[1:23:18] that doesn't eat remember they told
[1:23:20] brother Branham when he went across the
[1:23:21] curtain time they said we don't eat here
[1:23:23] right hey listen
[1:23:26] they're human they're in the sixth
[1:23:28] dimension those are human beings those
[1:23:31] are not angels they're human people that
[1:23:35] what it's desiring to come back and get
[1:23:38] their human body hello get their human
[1:23:43] body so they can eat because we ate when
[1:23:47] we were here brother Brown said death
[1:23:50] only changes your dwelling place I like
[1:23:54] mountains and a mountain stream and I'm
[1:23:56] not going to change when I get over
[1:23:58] there I'll go visit Lisa on her little
[1:24:00] island that's okay with the ocean all
[1:24:03] the way around it but I'm going to go
[1:24:05] back up to the mountain cuz that's what
[1:24:09] I like a man that all right listen I'm
[1:24:16] gonna tell you something he built this
[1:24:17] because you he built all this desire you
[1:24:21] have he built that city didn't the
[1:24:23] Prophet tell us in the future only built
[1:24:25] that city because of what you like right
[1:24:28] I'm telling you people we're not going
[1:24:30] to walk down the streets of gold and
[1:24:31] there'd be a little block and there's a
[1:24:33] house and the same little block that's
[1:24:36] all the thing I didn't like about New
[1:24:37] Mexico Rachel
[1:24:38] where's Rachel they have an ordinance
[1:24:43] every house has lutes ain't it looks
[1:24:45] just like they stamped them they all had
[1:24:49] to be basically the same color they
[1:24:51] couldn't have a roof like this some of
[1:24:54] them did you know long time ago but what
[1:24:55] they're building now it's just so
[1:24:57] mundane that you drive down the street
[1:25:00] you go I like that house you drunk I
[1:25:02] like that house well if you like the
[1:25:04] first one you're gonna like the last one
[1:25:07] cuz it looks the same it's not gonna
[1:25:13] look the same in the future home I
[1:25:14] promise you
[1:25:15] amen like I said Mama's not gonna have
[1:25:21] to walk by and go why did it pace at
[1:25:22] that color
[1:25:24] but ends up a form of a history body
[1:25:26] that doesn't eat neither does it drink
[1:25:29] but it's a body a body that's waiting
[1:25:32] for us as soon as we leave this one now
[1:25:34] we understand and no one thinks for sure
[1:25:37] that we're not going to get something
[1:25:40] it's here hey man we're not going to get
[1:25:44] there's not a body for me hanging up in
[1:25:46] a closet in heaven my theophany is who
[1:25:50] you're looking at now inside of me the
[1:25:53] eternal part of me and we'll explain
[1:25:54] that in just a minute
[1:25:56] Mego over an hour today that's all right
[1:25:58] say Amen okay it's a body a body that's
[1:26:01] waiting for us as soon as we leave this
[1:26:03] one now obviously we know for sure that
[1:26:06] if we die we're going to have to change
[1:26:07] them right something's got changed this
[1:26:11] is not going to another dimension and
[1:26:14] then let that pull from that dimension
[1:26:17] is going to pull what that soul into
[1:26:20] that six dimension that's what the pull
[1:26:21] is because remember I believe the pull
[1:26:24] from the six dimension is going have to
[1:26:25] come this way
[1:26:26] because all them in that six dimensions
[1:26:28] got to come into this dimension why are
[1:26:31] they still over there and don't want to
[1:26:33] come back why was brother Brent I'm
[1:26:34] looking back and said do I have to go
[1:26:35] back into that why it was dying death
[1:26:40] has to be destroyed here folk when death
[1:26:42] is destroyed here that'll make that six
[1:26:45] dimension come in here then we'll see
[1:26:46] the people that are dead and going on
[1:26:48] why does why do they want to come back
[1:26:49] here they never said one time we want to
[1:26:53] go back brother branham no he was the
[1:26:54] only one that said I want to go back
[1:26:56] because his body was still laying in
[1:26:57] this dimension and then a body that's
[1:27:00] waiting for us as soon as we leave this
[1:27:01] one now ends there we enter into that
[1:27:05] body and that's the kind of body that
[1:27:07] God was but we're not little dots on the
[1:27:21] paper we're what we are the word
[1:27:30] we're born by the word our new birth
[1:27:33] comes by the Word of God the preaching
[1:27:35] of the gospel Bree said let us make man
[1:27:38] in our own image and in our likeness
[1:27:41] now when man became in that body talking
[1:27:44] about Genesis 1:26 men had control the
[1:27:46] fish and the fowl of the beasts of the
[1:27:47] field
[1:27:48] then there was no man to till the soil
[1:27:49] Genesis 2 he done made male and female
[1:27:51] but there's no man to till the soil then
[1:27:54] God made man out of the dust of the
[1:27:56] earth he gave him a hand like a
[1:27:57] chimpanzee gave him a foot like a bear
[1:27:59] made him on the image and this earthly
[1:28:02] body is in the image of animal life we
[1:28:05] know that and it's made out of the same
[1:28:07] kind of material your body now he's
[1:28:10] talking about a human body this body
[1:28:11] your human body is made or sorry I don't
[1:28:14] want to interject your body is made just
[1:28:17] the same kind of material as a horse a
[1:28:19] dog or anything like that it's made out
[1:28:22] of calcium potash petroleum cosmic light
[1:28:24] you're just know all flecks like that is
[1:28:27] not the same flesh now you watch it
[1:28:29] because remember we can't give a animal
[1:28:31] a blood transfusion so so we are
[1:28:33] separated from that all right but we do
[1:28:36] have the same calcium potash that makes
[1:28:39] their flesh makes ours how can they put
[1:28:42] a pig valve in your heart
[1:28:44] okay that's flesh that has nothing to do
[1:28:46] with the spirit there's nothing to it so
[1:28:48] that's just a flesh body they can take a
[1:28:50] pig biome and put it in your heart and
[1:28:51] it what won't reject it okay
[1:28:54] so we're close Bigfoot oh I'm still
[1:29:00] giggling about them they're just enough
[1:29:02] left anyhow all flesh like that is
[1:29:06] people gotta have something to do that's
[1:29:08] all I knew about them they just needed
[1:29:10] something to do if a guy drove down from
[1:29:11] Minnesota to look for Bigfoot in Georgia
[1:29:13] he didn't have a lot to do I wonder why
[1:29:17] I said when he someone do it for Bigfoot
[1:29:19] for a couple of days where you going
[1:29:20] Georgia can you go cut the grass home
[1:29:25] before you leave it's a different flash
[1:29:29] but it's made out of the dust of the
[1:29:31] earth where we came from where it came
[1:29:33] from
[1:29:33] but the difference between an animal and
[1:29:35] a man God put a soul in a man and he
[1:29:38] didn't put it in the animal because the
[1:29:40] soul that was in the man is that
[1:29:42] theophany
[1:29:43] all right so your soul is your theophany
[1:29:46] all right
[1:29:47] I just wanted to get to that right there
[1:29:50] now you know put it back together okay
[1:29:59] we'll stop pretending just for a second
[1:30:01] now
[1:30:02] now let's read one more I had it
[1:30:04] separated on my notes but they put it
[1:30:06] back together so that's okay questions
[1:30:08] and answers on Hebrews they kind of play
[1:30:09] with my notes every once in a while but
[1:30:12] it's good now he's speaking of the souls
[1:30:13] of spirit while we pack our bodies over
[1:30:15] the grave of the sainted ones for this
[1:30:16] body and the body in the first place
[1:30:19] when God the logos that went out of God
[1:30:21] or as I went through it the Catholic
[1:30:23] caught in comedy ternal sonship go with
[1:30:27] not eternal sonship but the son that was
[1:30:31] with the father in the beginning with
[1:30:32] the logos that went out of God not to
[1:30:34] different people now I didn't draw two
[1:30:36] different people over there one person
[1:30:37] all right what here's God all eternal if
[1:30:41] I can understand him he just steps over
[1:30:43] and starts speech but he's in a body
[1:30:47] because he's that Genesis 1:26 man was
[1:30:50] in the body all right and it was the
[1:30:52] theophany of God that went out the human
[1:30:55] form that didn't have eyes like you see
[1:30:57] thank God a better eye it didn't have
[1:31:01] ears like you hear but a far more
[1:31:03] hearing see it was at the often he said
[1:31:06] all this rainbow condescended into a
[1:31:08] theophany
[1:31:09] Moses saw it when it passed through the
[1:31:11] rock like that he saw the back parts and
[1:31:13] said it looked like a man right all
[1:31:15] right so everybody okay with this
[1:31:17] Genesis 1:26 man it's what a part of God
[1:31:23] not a separate person but a part of God
[1:31:26] and man collection if we're a separate
[1:31:29] person then we must be the third person
[1:31:31] no no there's only one person of God and
[1:31:35] there's only one person that's
[1:31:36] manifested itself into a bride that all
[1:31:40] right and man bear with me just for a
[1:31:48] few minutes there by alright my boring
[1:31:52] your stiff
[1:31:53] the man let's go around here I want to
[1:32:00] get to something what I've done was I
[1:32:02] separated the quote I'll be okay I
[1:32:09] handle it I handle this booth devil I
[1:32:13] can't live here we go
[1:32:15] thank you brother come on up here and
[1:32:17] talk to me so hit so now what happened
[1:32:22] here we go now we're going to develop
[1:32:23] this I'm not going to use any quotes but
[1:32:25] you can go through Scripture and there's
[1:32:27] no way I could write them all down but
[1:32:29] remember you and I are the children of
[1:32:31] God we were born by the Word of God
[1:32:34] there was a there was a place in the
[1:32:38] Word of God that God saw that you would
[1:32:40] respond to is that Alright that you
[1:32:43] would respond to and then that would
[1:32:45] connect you to this word okay because
[1:32:50] all God's children were right here
[1:32:53] listen like I was telling Bob brother
[1:32:56] branham said you were in your
[1:32:57] great-great-grandfather now let's not be
[1:32:58] vulgar but you weren't there in sperm
[1:33:01] because sperm dies sperm goes away
[1:33:04] farming goes out you understand what was
[1:33:06] going on so you weren't just a little
[1:33:08] sperm running in your great-grandfather
[1:33:10] and then he happened to give it to the
[1:33:12] and then he happened no it's the DNA
[1:33:15] it's the just of what may as to what
[1:33:18] part that makes you your blood the blood
[1:33:20] still life right your DNA was in your
[1:33:22] great-great-grandfather they can trace
[1:33:23] you back further than that so you were
[1:33:26] not in there as a person but you were
[1:33:30] identified by the DNA of the dáil family
[1:33:35] I was identified by that and I can go
[1:33:37] back so far because grandpa
[1:33:39] great-grandpa had relations with Grand
[1:33:42] mine broke grandpa didn't broke paw and
[1:33:44] then brought me there by all right with
[1:33:46] that but now remember glide does not
[1:33:50] multiply by sexual reproduction never
[1:33:53] has never will sex has nothing to do
[1:33:57] with God that was permitted because why
[1:34:01] because Satan blocked us off
[1:34:07] property guard said brother branham
[1:34:09] brother branham said that Satan in the
[1:34:13] Garden of Eden cut any no other sons of
[1:34:16] God could be born the one was polluted
[1:34:21] Eve's mind and natural womb was polluted
[1:34:25] so there was no way you and I could come
[1:34:27] we were absolutely alienated the Bible
[1:34:30] says cut off from the Commonwealth of
[1:34:32] God even though the word is here it's
[1:34:36] eternal it's already spoke what's going
[1:34:39] to happen why brother Brown said sin is
[1:34:43] so bad to disbelieve God's Word will
[1:34:46] that cut us off genesis 3:15 says I'll
[1:34:49] put enmity what there was a division
[1:34:51] there was a gap that Adam couldn't fill
[1:34:56] back up amen but there was one man that
[1:35:02] could the Creator the Christ the
[1:35:07] anointing the Holy Ghost all these
[1:35:09] things that great fountain he could but
[1:35:12] now remember when Abel was born remember
[1:35:19] what this is right here Genesis 1:26 is
[1:35:22] the book of Redemption
[1:35:34] hello think about it the Genesis 1:26
[1:35:39] man didn't fall but what was identified
[1:35:41] with that Genesis 1:26 man fell okay
[1:35:47] remember we didn't break relationship
[1:35:50] remember I'm going to read you the last
[1:35:52] quote you didn't become sons that the
[1:35:53] rebirth
[1:35:54] you always were son but by the rebirth
[1:35:58] you could be brought back amen
[1:36:04] not that we had to eternal life when we
[1:36:06] got here no no we had representation
[1:36:09] that the foreknowledge of God saw where
[1:36:14] we would go and had it waiting for us
[1:36:17] when we got here Tamizh are so simple
[1:36:19] because I know one thing's for sure I'll
[1:36:23] promise you I was a vile kid when I was
[1:36:26] 18 to about 30 and there was no Holy
[1:36:30] Ghost in myself because the things I did
[1:36:33] he wouldn't have done so there was no
[1:36:36] Holy Ghost there was no eternal life in
[1:36:38] my soul as a possession now that's just
[1:36:42] really stupid for somebody to say I was
[1:36:44] just great eternal something when I was
[1:36:46] born but the people in the message
[1:36:48] preacher they do now I can see my part
[1:36:54] of the representation that I had that in
[1:36:58] 1998 God would meet me at a place had it
[1:37:04] already waiting for me already paid the
[1:37:07] price because we gotta get over here and
[1:37:09] pay a price had already paid the price
[1:37:12] and wrote my name in the book but did
[1:37:15] you know it knew you didn't know it till
[1:37:19] you realize what greater to me that's a
[1:37:22] greater Redemption than to just say I
[1:37:24] always was eternal the guy you looking
[1:37:28] at right now is getting old
[1:37:30] he ain't eternal the guy inside is but
[1:37:38] we'll talk about saying just the same if
[1:37:39] you'll bear with me I've been trying to
[1:37:41] keep in an hour I've been doing pretty
[1:37:42] good but today we're going to go over a
[1:37:43] little bit that alright brother branham
[1:37:46] said
[1:37:47] your soup will not ball over remember he
[1:37:49] said that one time he said sisters he
[1:37:50] said you said don't worry about you and
[1:37:52] I believe he you know what I believe if
[1:37:54] that man said that he said look sister
[1:37:56] your suit won't bowl over I don't
[1:37:57] believe her suit bowled over he was
[1:37:59] telling them something supernatural and
[1:38:01] he wanted them to listen alright so
[1:38:04] don't worry about you about your suit
[1:38:08] we're about your suit all right look if
[1:38:11] this is the Shogun I'm okay if I confuse
[1:38:13] anybody yet nobody's raises their hand
[1:38:15] okay but this Genesis 1:26 man that's
[1:38:18] why I love it because it encompasses
[1:38:19] everything we are because in Genesis
[1:38:24] 1:26 is not the Old Testament now
[1:38:36] they're a part of Redemption Abraham
[1:38:41] Isaac Jacob Joseph all those but they
[1:38:43] are not part of that Genesis 1:26 men
[1:38:46] because the Genesis 1:26 man is sons and
[1:38:49] daughters of God Abraham was never
[1:38:52] called a son of God he's called a friend
[1:38:53] of God David would not have done what he
[1:38:57] did because you say all know prove it
[1:38:59] alright I'll prove it was there any
[1:39:04] redemption in the Old Testament that's
[1:39:05] all going to ask you correct there was
[1:39:10] no born-again experience in the Old
[1:39:12] Testament
[1:39:13] no David would not have had his best
[1:39:16] friend killed committed adultery
[1:39:19] now that really sounds like a Christian
[1:39:20] doesn't it to me it's like I told him
[1:39:24] downstairs I'm glad God created grace
[1:39:27] and not me because nobody'd make it but
[1:39:32] by god being grace he's the one only one
[1:39:35] that could ever develop the word grace
[1:39:36] which is unmerited favor David you're
[1:39:39] the Alpha my but God he killed his best
[1:39:42] friend so he could get his wife pregnant
[1:39:45] or he had his wife pregnant already he
[1:39:48] was trying to cover it up had his best
[1:39:50] friend killed on purpose
[1:39:52] that was premeditated murder because he
[1:39:57] said you would draw yourself from the
[1:39:58] battle and just let that got that far
[1:40:02] but yet he was yet he's going to be one
[1:40:04] of the people there you know that God
[1:40:06] city was out for mine well he must have
[1:40:08] liked something about it but it but he
[1:40:09] didn't have this Genesis 1:26 man so the
[1:40:12] Old Testament all right you got it the
[1:40:14] Old Testament the Bible talks about in
[1:40:16] the book Luke it gives you all the
[1:40:18] generation and it calls back to where
[1:40:21] this one man Adam was the son of God and
[1:40:25] man that's Adam back here all right all
[1:40:31] the way down in the Old Testament there
[1:40:34] was no way that this could develop
[1:40:35] inside of a human being there was no way
[1:40:38] that the soul of men you said prove it
[1:40:42] okay I'll prove it
[1:40:58] the blood of bulls and goats only
[1:41:01] cupboard scenes now tell me about this
[1:41:05] person right here that ain't covering
[1:41:08] sin that's sinless but the blood of
[1:41:13] bulls and goats only covered sin if put
[1:41:16] a covering over the people as long as
[1:41:18] they made a sacrifice God did not
[1:41:21] destroy them but now they are going to
[1:41:22] be judged and man David paid for what he
[1:41:27] did
[1:41:28] remember David paid God said there's too
[1:41:31] much bloodshed you gonna have a problem
[1:41:32] no look at his kids look at his whole
[1:41:35] family within turmoil after all this
[1:41:37] happened but the blood of bulls and
[1:41:39] goats only covered sins so this right
[1:41:40] here Genesis 1:26 man this Christ come
[1:41:44] to do what not to just cover since he
[1:41:48] came to eradicate sin and man he came to
[1:41:52] do away with sin and put it back in
[1:41:54] fellowship with God amen so the blood of
[1:41:58] bulls and goats only covered sin so
[1:42:01] there was no born-again believer in the
[1:42:03] Old Testament no no that was an
[1:42:06] anointing sure Christ is all look if you
[1:42:09] can't see Christ in every verse read it
[1:42:12] again so Christ was in every verse
[1:42:14] because look Christ was in Moses God
[1:42:18] should have killed Moses Moses of the
[1:42:20] murderer look at all these people in the
[1:42:23] Old Testament the one little things that
[1:42:25] they did show that they didn't have this
[1:42:27] in their soul because you and I love you
[1:42:29] know sometimes we are pretty pretty
[1:42:32] we're Rascals but how can the Holy Ghost
[1:42:36] let you kill somebody how can the Holy
[1:42:38] Ghost let you let you let your best
[1:42:42] friend get killed on purpose - I'm
[1:42:46] saying all the characteristics isn't in
[1:42:47] the Old Testament was that God covered
[1:42:49] that sin there was no way to do away
[1:42:51] with it they still had that cloud member
[1:42:54] brother Aaron said that cloud of
[1:42:55] darkness was still over them in the Old
[1:42:58] Testament and I like what one brother
[1:43:01] said he said you know remember the
[1:43:04] little dove that was in the ark
[1:43:07] remember Noah sends the Dove out he
[1:43:10] comes back
[1:43:12] then he goes out with a leaf no one
[1:43:15] knows that the world is getting green
[1:43:18] again and then remember he sends it out
[1:43:20] and they don't come back anymore he said
[1:43:22] that I love this Bob Ford Bob Bob take
[1:43:29] notes that does tried to find a place to
[1:43:33] land and it did on the river Jordan the
[1:43:42] Dove came down and found a place to land
[1:43:46] hey man
[1:43:47] he couldn't land in the Old Testament he
[1:43:50] couldn't find a place to land but that
[1:43:52] does found a lamb he found a place that
[1:43:56] he could reside a man
[1:43:58] so that dove falls what descends from
[1:44:01] heaven like a dove on a man named Jesus
[1:44:03] Christ which was this man right here we
[1:44:06] just read that right this man right here
[1:44:08] comes down I don't want to reach there
[1:44:16] which was the fullness of all this now
[1:44:26] we go to Genesis 3:14 the beginning of
[1:44:32] the creation of God this was this in
[1:44:36] other words this righted the ship it
[1:44:39] brought the Dove it brought the lamb and
[1:44:41] it brought the Lamb of God together and
[1:44:44] he died and when he died on the day of
[1:44:46] Pentecost that same man came back in a
[1:44:55] mini member body not just one body it's
[1:44:59] not just in one person that whole of
[1:45:02] Genesis 1:26 Christ opened the book he
[1:45:06] opened the seals broke the seal what
[1:45:09] there's one seal brother I'm sitting out
[1:45:11] with the seal of death he broke the seal
[1:45:13] of death and brought us what back into
[1:45:17] fellowship with God now let's read a few
[1:45:20] quotes now make a comment all right tell
[1:45:22] you man all right
[1:45:27] number two number 12 in just a few
[1:45:31] minutes so just bear with me just a
[1:45:32] minute God which was a part of God God
[1:45:35] seen what the end would be we just said
[1:45:37] that from the beginning and the logos
[1:45:39] came to the earth this person not
[1:45:43] another person he didn't send another
[1:45:45] person this one guy came himself a man
[1:45:50] the logos came to earth which was Christ
[1:45:52] the word spoken word of God now let's
[1:45:55] stop right there but what did he do as
[1:45:57] this person was going to speak and
[1:46:00] create sons and daughters of God what
[1:46:04] happened to this man he was the son of
[1:46:06] man he was the store of the what sort of
[1:46:10] the seed what is the seed the seeds a
[1:46:13] word
[1:46:14] where'd he saw it me and you that's why
[1:46:21] we're born by the spoken word of God not
[1:46:26] by sexual desire I'll get to that just a
[1:46:30] second I want to show you something Lord
[1:46:31] show me I hope it's right it was good
[1:46:33] right to me
[1:46:34] poka Word of God part of God and was
[1:46:35] made flesh and dwelt among us and then
[1:46:37] we come out of Christ Oh
[1:46:40] which makes the same life that was in
[1:46:42] God in Christ in you and just as sure as
[1:46:46] God raised this up we've got to come
[1:46:49] with the same thing it's the same
[1:46:51] spirits in us because it's the Spirit of
[1:46:53] God making us sons and daughters of God
[1:46:56] oh isn't that marvelous
[1:46:58] how do we get it by believing on the
[1:47:00] Lord Jesus Christ that's what and
[1:47:02] accepting it and then God in return give
[1:47:05] us the Holy Spirit crying in our hearts
[1:47:08] Abba Father my God my God and then we
[1:47:10] were resurrected in the last days to be
[1:47:13] caught up and he said that day you shall
[1:47:16] know that I am in the father the father
[1:47:17] may iron you and you and me there's the
[1:47:19] spirit coming out of God manifested as
[1:47:22] the logos come down and made flesh dwelt
[1:47:26] among us revs revs died taking on the
[1:47:30] penalty of sin raised up again setting
[1:47:32] up the Majesty on high the right hand of
[1:47:34] God and the Holy Spirit coming back
[1:47:36] bringing in the same
[1:47:38] spirit in the individuals now to bring
[1:47:42] them back into relationship with their
[1:47:43] creator is it that marvelous and man
[1:47:46] brings us back it's kinda like tell like
[1:47:54] Daniel seventy weeks you know you take
[1:47:55] Daniel seven weeks you got sixty nine
[1:47:57] weeks and then you got to gap and you
[1:47:58] got one week left right and what is in
[1:48:01] here Gentiles right but now if they had
[1:48:05] been no Gentile bride it would have been
[1:48:09] this all Jews the seventy weeks would
[1:48:16] have started and ended and they'd been
[1:48:17] no gap amen same way with the Old
[1:48:20] Testament if sons and daughters would
[1:48:23] have been born here Satan had had done
[1:48:24] what he did Adam doing what he did then
[1:48:26] it was just the bend we would have been
[1:48:27] born into Eden and we would just kept on
[1:48:29] living the eternity but that didn't
[1:48:33] happen
[1:48:33] we fell and when we fell we came down
[1:48:38] here into sin and then he came all the
[1:48:41] way down through all that came down here
[1:48:44] where we are Jesus Christ
[1:48:45] to do what take it back there I come
[1:48:51] from God and oh boy I go back to God
[1:48:54] amen and that's a revelation you can't
[1:48:57] you say that oh they're your life and
[1:48:59] don't go to hell but if you say I can't
[1:49:01] if you get a revelation if that's where
[1:49:03] you came from
[1:49:04] then you've got to go back to it you got
[1:49:08] to go back remember Satan can't give you
[1:49:11] a revelation like God can give you
[1:49:13] revelation is eternal so you've got to
[1:49:16] know where you come from know what
[1:49:18] you're doing down here
[1:49:19] what to fulfill the plan and purpose of
[1:49:21] God and then we're going right back in
[1:49:24] the Garden of Eden and man alright what
[1:49:30] number was that trying to hurry number
[1:49:33] thirteen the Holy Spirit is nothing in
[1:49:38] the world but the Spirit of Christ back
[1:49:40] working in the church it's a Spirit of
[1:49:43] Christ worked in Jesus the low gosh
[1:49:45] works in Jesus he gave his blood and he
[1:49:47] might cleanse us and God by
[1:49:49] foreknowledge where he heard that before
[1:49:51] godbye for knowledge set orders in the
[1:49:53] Church of different things that same
[1:49:54] logos work in us we'll do the same thing
[1:49:58] got to all right let's go to number 14
[1:50:02] life 1957 but close our eyes to our
[1:50:05] imagination for a few minutes and go
[1:50:06] we're back in the for there was anything
[1:50:08] the great fountain of all eternity that
[1:50:09] was spirit of love joy spirit of honesty
[1:50:12] that spirit of prudence in this
[1:50:13] perfection then out of the existence of
[1:50:15] the father went to logos which was the
[1:50:17] son which was the theophany which was
[1:50:20] the body of a great Jehovah God went
[1:50:21] forth in a celestial body that's the
[1:50:23] logos the word spoke out of them great
[1:50:26] fountains of life and went forth and
[1:50:28] there was the theophany
[1:50:29] which was God made into word then that
[1:50:32] theophany now he's not finished then
[1:50:34] that the oppan he was made flesh in the
[1:50:36] person Christ Jesus and then all the
[1:50:39] fullness of the Trinity running through
[1:50:42] your filter all the fullness of the
[1:50:44] Trinity dwelt in him both Father Son and
[1:50:47] Holy Spirit all in that and that's the
[1:50:49] very way we go plumb back to the
[1:50:52] original beginning of God which was what
[1:50:55] back over here there we are born again
[1:50:59] not of flesh born again not of blood but
[1:51:03] born again by the Spirit and then then
[1:51:06] that eternal spirit of love and honesty
[1:51:08] comes down to make its place in us and
[1:51:12] then when we die from this life we go
[1:51:14] into the body which of this earthly body
[1:51:16] because all we have a theophany to go
[1:51:18] into a body celestial then that's the
[1:51:20] coming of the Lord Jesus this body this
[1:51:24] body is picked up from the earth again
[1:51:27] we're not going to get a new one folks
[1:51:28] it's this one redeemed mmm and made in a
[1:51:34] glorified state to live in his presence
[1:51:36] forever then all the perversion all the
[1:51:38] things that sin in perversion we'll all
[1:51:41] go out of existence number 15 Jehovah
[1:51:44] Jireh 1964 God tearing loose I like this
[1:51:47] one oh yeah cutting apart separating
[1:51:49] himself dividing himself he did the same
[1:51:52] thing on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:51:54] Holy Ghost came down that pillar of fire
[1:51:56] came down that followed Israel he's
[1:52:02] talked about different
[1:52:04] that pillar of fire came down that
[1:52:06] followed Israel we all know that that
[1:52:09] was the logo that was Christ and when it
[1:52:11] came down onto their Pentecost what did
[1:52:14] it do it divided itself and tongues of
[1:52:17] fire set upon each one of them God
[1:52:20] dividing himself among the people old
[1:52:22] brother
[1:52:23] you can be undivided with that same
[1:52:25] spirit with the same spirit that was in
[1:52:28] Christ
[1:52:28] hey man I Street number 16 paradox 1964
[1:52:33] he was God we are not God okay you gotta
[1:52:38] have a revelation there too because we
[1:52:39] are God all right but we're not the God
[1:52:43] look remember remember there's one man
[1:52:46] that's a big G that's why always there
[1:52:49] we got BG and you got little G's we the
[1:52:52] little G he to be G don't get them
[1:52:54] separated I mean don't get them mixed up
[1:52:56] okay but we are this big G made manifest
[1:53:00] in the little G Laird's you get that
[1:53:03] with BG okay this he was God we're not
[1:53:09] God what we're not we can't look I can't
[1:53:11] buy my soul save anybody but I remember
[1:53:17] though let me go back and let's just
[1:53:18] bring something out right here real
[1:53:20] quick that's real close because what I
[1:53:23] said in Sunday School class you take
[1:53:25] somebody like Gabby she's back with the
[1:53:28] kids she don't talk wait a minute let's
[1:53:31] take sister Jean she never talked I
[1:53:34] always told her to be quiet but you take
[1:53:38] sister Jean I believe she's a born-again
[1:53:40] christian chance for a long time she
[1:53:41] explains she displays that but she
[1:53:44] doesn't she sings a special if we make
[1:53:46] her we may make you do it again you and
[1:53:51] your brother over here but we are but
[1:53:55] you know look at this Jean though she
[1:53:56] doesn't say anything she's not like me
[1:53:58] she's not you know talking all the
[1:53:59] timing and she she prays she reads her
[1:54:02] Bible she studies so we go now to the
[1:54:07] white zone judgment she thinks man I am
[1:54:08] I'm not anything I haven't done anything
[1:54:10] for God but one day while she was on
[1:54:13] earth now I want you to get this one day
[1:54:15] while she was on earth she don't drive
[1:54:17] anymore
[1:54:17] think but if you did Drive if she was on
[1:54:21] the highway and she had a flat tire okay
[1:54:25] this man stops by he's just an old
[1:54:27] greedy got tattoos all up his arm living
[1:54:29] with three women kick some beer cans out
[1:54:31] of his car when he gets out - I'm coming
[1:54:34] changes our tire and she says wonder oh
[1:54:36] you and he said nothing he's just fine
[1:54:38] you'd wanna talk about it our life
[1:54:42] talking about imparting eternal life we
[1:54:46] get to the white throne judgment this
[1:54:48] man walks up in front of the white
[1:54:49] throne with his head down he knows he's
[1:54:52] in for it he knows he's not live the
[1:54:54] Christian life he know you don't have to
[1:54:56] tell you if in judgment you don't have
[1:54:58] to tell at that moment you won't have to
[1:54:59] tell him what he did he knows what he
[1:55:01] did and he's getting ready and God's
[1:55:02] fixing the way judgment on this man
[1:55:04] because remember in this life he was
[1:55:06] quite a whoremonger he was all these
[1:55:08] different things he had to go to hell
[1:55:10] he had to go to hell he says I I pass
[1:55:13] and he hears this boy's way back in the
[1:55:16] back and I don't know jinkin of course
[1:55:18] we're going to be eternal so you can
[1:55:19] hear this regime from anywhere that
[1:55:20] would be great you know she can be
[1:55:21] shouting hallelujah and I'm gonna go I
[1:55:23] told you you could do that but we get up
[1:55:26] to the day of judgment though and she
[1:55:27] seems like she's never done anything for
[1:55:29] God and all of a sudden God's fixing to
[1:55:32] pass judgment on this guy that has no
[1:55:34] chance
[1:55:35] and she says hold on a minute remember
[1:55:39] God brother Brown said God loves for you
[1:55:41] to remind him of his promises right so
[1:55:44] shifter gene says hold on a minute said
[1:55:47] that man changed my tire one one day and
[1:55:51] said you told us in the Bible that a cup
[1:55:54] of water or anything that you do to the
[1:55:57] least of my little ones it will not be
[1:55:58] forgotten in this earth are in the world
[1:56:02] to come and not that God's going to be
[1:56:05] surprised he knows that's what's going
[1:56:07] to happen but for sister Jean to impart
[1:56:10] eternal life to a man that never needed
[1:56:13] it never wanted it on his way to hell so
[1:56:17] don't tell me we are gods we are gods
[1:56:23] but we're not the God like this man so
[1:56:26] you got running through your filter
[1:56:27] because what if you notice it's
[1:56:29] beautiful Illustrated when
[1:56:31] great pillar fire that followed the
[1:56:32] children of Israel through the
[1:56:33] wilderness it appeared to st. Paul when
[1:56:36] it come down under their Pentecost it
[1:56:37] broke up in tongues of fire set upon
[1:56:40] each of them that was God in this pillar
[1:56:42] fire the logo separating himself among
[1:56:44] his people showing that Christ and the
[1:56:47] bride see God and His Church are
[1:56:50] becoming one why it's just the most
[1:56:53] beautiful thing you ever seen
[1:56:56] amen this Garden of Eden great wonderful
[1:56:58] thing absolutely but sin marred and
[1:57:01] broke us off but what happened though is
[1:57:03] God that didn't stop him he just kept on
[1:57:06] coming he's coming to get his kids he's
[1:57:10] coming to get his kids it's what he's
[1:57:11] doing he's coming to get his kids
[1:57:13] because his kids are in the Word of God
[1:57:14] he comes down here and he sews the seed
[1:57:16] Word of God he goes back up and comes
[1:57:19] back what so he can get into me and you
[1:57:22] so he can get into me and you when Jesus
[1:57:25] was here by yourself he didn't save one
[1:57:27] person he didn't give nobody the baptism
[1:57:30] of the Holy Ghost while he was there but
[1:57:32] when he went back what when he went back
[1:57:34] to where he came from the full purpose
[1:57:37] of God comes now to where I can now go
[1:57:39] back and get into the people how by the
[1:57:42] word by the word by the word we are sons
[1:57:46] and daughters by the Word of God and
[1:57:49] then the Word of God that was right here
[1:57:52] it's now right here and then right here
[1:57:58] he's going to take us out and take us
[1:58:00] back here at Genesis 1:26 man is the
[1:58:06] Holy Ghost you got in your soul if
[1:58:08] you're born again that's just to me as
[1:58:11] simple as you can get it but it started
[1:58:14] right here and it comes all the way
[1:58:18] through this big long journey and then
[1:58:20] finally it rested where it rested on you
[1:58:25] God dividing himself so now let's look
[1:58:32] at number 18 or finish 18 which kept 17
[1:58:38] number 18 Smyrna church a brother Evan
[1:58:41] said now then here we are coming to a
[1:58:43] conclusion
[1:58:44] as the eternal logos God was manifest in
[1:58:47] the Sun and in Jesus what all the
[1:58:50] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[1:58:52] and that eternal one was the father
[1:58:54] manifested in flesh not a second person
[1:58:56] and thereby gained the title of son even
[1:59:01] so we look at me eternal in his thoughts
[1:59:07] we were eternally in estill we were part
[1:59:10] listen we were not just part of the mind
[1:59:12] of God we were the eternal part we were
[1:59:14] not just there's a book there's
[1:59:15] different books there's a book of life
[1:59:19] there's a part you never named never
[1:59:21] wasn't they depart that your name was in
[1:59:23] it and took out Judas
[1:59:25] then there's a part that the eternal
[1:59:26] station the eternal section of God's
[1:59:29] mind is his children his progeny the
[1:59:32] ones that watch even eternal in his
[1:59:36] thoughts in our turn now what if he
[1:59:39] would have kept them as a thought we'd
[1:59:42] have never developed but the logos had
[1:59:44] to speak our name had to speak our name
[1:59:48] way over here what does it matter if it
[1:59:50] took 10 million years for God to get to
[1:59:51] you wanted to matter to him that wasn't
[1:59:54] even a millisecond for him to get to you
[1:59:57] and tell you hey you're my son you're my
[2:00:00] daughter so even as we turtle in his
[2:00:04] thoughts in our turn see in our turn not
[2:00:07] forever not we always was but in our
[2:00:10] turn my turn was December the 17th 1998
[2:00:15] that was my turn
[2:00:16] amen that was when God came and filled
[2:00:19] me where the Holy Ghost that I should
[2:00:21] have had before the foundation of the
[2:00:23] world but got trapped into all this
[2:00:25] the prophet of God told us right by Adam
[2:00:28] and Eve sending it trapped us into what
[2:00:30] below the fall line that all right we
[2:00:34] got trapped down here so even as we
[2:00:38] eternal in these thoughts in our turn
[2:00:40] became the many membered spoken-word
[2:00:43] seed manifest in flesh and those eternal
[2:00:47] thoughts now manifest in flesh are the
[2:00:50] sons of God even as we are so called we
[2:00:53] did not become seed by the rebirth we
[2:00:58] our seed we were always in the Word of
[2:01:02] God we just didn't know it
[2:01:05] we were blackened the cloud was over us
[2:01:08] we had spin that we listened I don't
[2:01:11] know if it bothers you or not but sin is
[2:01:12] what bothers me oh it doesn't bother you
[2:01:16] okay
[2:01:17] it bothers me what bothers me is what
[2:01:21] like the brother said my stinking
[2:01:23] thinking is what bothers me and most of
[2:01:27] it it's the devil God gets in there just
[2:01:30] about that much we did not become seed
[2:01:33] by the rebirth we were seed we had
[2:01:38] representation the woman at the well had
[2:01:41] representation Christ looked all the way
[2:01:44] by hey if he was Christ here he knew he
[2:01:48] had her already hey man hey how are we
[2:01:52] gonna ever fail if you know you're in
[2:01:55] God you can't fail we did not become
[2:01:58] seed by the rebirth we were seed and
[2:02:01] therefore we're reborn for only the
[2:02:04] elect can be reborn because we were in
[2:02:08] that Genesis 1:26 man may I may I say
[2:02:11] without you know somebody will kill you
[2:02:14] if you if you misinterpret the quote so
[2:02:17] let's just read it like this and then
[2:02:18] I'm gonna coming because we were seed is
[2:02:20] the reason we can be quickened and non
[2:02:23] seed there is nothing to quicken if you
[2:02:26] weren't here if you weren't part of that
[2:02:31] low God if you weren't part of that Word
[2:02:33] of God you never will be
[2:02:35] so God by foreknowledge putting another
[2:02:38] quote together by foreknowledge knew you
[2:02:41] would want it here so he had it already
[2:02:43] waiting on you here that is it for you
[2:02:47] he didn't write a new word of god so
[2:02:50] that mark action Rob could come in he
[2:02:53] wrote that before the foundation of the
[2:02:55] world knowing that one day he would
[2:02:57] think God moved from Massachusetts and
[2:03:02] learn how to talk
[2:03:05] well some he still can't say car okay
[2:03:10] with the care but he shot lunch at the
[2:03:13] journey though he he waited all those
[2:03:15] years mark didn't he you were just like
[2:03:20] me we were born in sin we did things
[2:03:22] wrong but God waited for the patient God
[2:03:25] because he had already spoke it right
[2:03:28] here because he had already looked down
[2:03:30] here and saw where mark was so he
[2:03:33] already had it for him had it waiting on
[2:03:35] him and then what happened he comes down
[2:03:38] to Massachusetts
[2:03:39] I don't you didn't get morning up there
[2:03:40] he got morning down here okay so he come
[2:03:43] he had a journey and he met God here he
[2:03:48] heard a word that was not a 23rd chapter
[2:03:51] of Revelation that's why my brother
[2:03:53] brown told him he said don't you make me
[2:03:55] Antichrist he said I can't get outside
[2:03:57] the word so everything you have is got
[2:04:01] to be inside that 66 books of the Bible
[2:04:04] because it was wrote for you let me give
[2:04:07] you let me sound the trumpet that was
[2:04:08] written just for his children that was
[2:04:11] written just for you so that you can
[2:04:13] respond
[2:04:14] somebody preaches the Word of God and
[2:04:16] you respond to that what that's that
[2:04:19] Sheen word coming alive that God saw
[2:04:23] before the foundation of the world that
[2:04:25] that would meet right here see I believe
[2:04:29] that more than I believe always was
[2:04:31] eternal when I was drinking and doing
[2:04:32] all the things I was doing I had God in
[2:04:34] me no no no no no one more time no God
[2:04:41] will not dwell in an unclean vessel he
[2:04:44] will not dwell in something that he
[2:04:46] can't have control over and the things I
[2:04:48] did remember those songs the things I
[2:04:51] used to do I do them no more why because
[2:04:55] the seed word was quickened the Bible
[2:05:00] was where I was born from I wasn't born
[2:05:04] sure I was born from Samuel Peggy Dale
[2:05:07] yeah but I was reborn I've been reborn
[2:05:12] I've been changed
[2:05:16] why because of my second birth hey man
[2:05:20] let me give you a little information
[2:05:22] here
[2:05:24] this is what I driving down the road for
[2:05:27] whee
[2:05:28] I'm sorry it took so long anybody got
[2:05:32] more questions let me tell you something
[2:05:35] when I was looking up those quotes
[2:05:37] Friday night because I couldn't sleep
[2:05:39] probably too much that case that
[2:05:40] antimony give us but I was reading about
[2:05:44] the offing brother Branham was talking
[2:05:45] about going across the curtain of time
[2:05:47] and that nine year old woman he said why
[2:05:50] is this woman so happy the angel of the
[2:05:53] Lord what does he say he said she was
[2:05:55] ninety years old when she in your in
[2:05:58] your service received the baptism of the
[2:06:02] Holy Ghost and it changed her to an
[2:06:05] eighteen to twenty year old woman let me
[2:06:10] ask you a question
[2:06:12] and this helped me put some things
[2:06:15] together but I'm 57 years old I know I
[2:06:19] don't look it I look older I know go
[2:06:23] ahead but I'm 57 years old if I wasn't
[2:06:28] born again now see God gives you us God
[2:06:30] gives you a soul right better everybody
[2:06:35] got one God had to give you one Satan
[2:06:38] can't give you a soul everybody
[2:06:39] everybody I sold that come from God but
[2:06:42] that's where your choice is to be made
[2:06:44] and then now that nine year old woman
[2:06:47] let me tell you how because the Bible
[2:06:49] says were a new one creation reborn we
[2:06:53] become a newborn baby in Christ amen so
[2:06:59] that woman was 90 years old she lived in
[2:07:01] sin for come on people
[2:07:03] she lived in sin for 90 years her
[2:07:06] theophany looked just like her she
[2:07:10] wasn't a young woman brother Graham said
[2:07:13] a sinner will be judged in the body they
[2:07:15] send in and am I like brother Dale I
[2:07:17] don't think they get when they go to the
[2:07:18] fifth dimension they got this new body
[2:07:20] this 18 to 20 no it's exactly because we
[2:07:23] look to be reborn that's the whole thing
[2:07:26] you may not get this it may take you
[2:07:28] years
[2:07:28] I got it I got it I got it I got it so
[2:07:30] fresh when I was turned when I became
[2:07:33] born again in 1998 I was 38 years old my
[2:07:40] soul went to 18 my soul went to 18 to 20
[2:07:48] because that's what's growing me back
[2:07:50] that's what's going to change my body
[2:07:52] you're not going I'm not 57 years old in
[2:07:55] my soul but when I was reborn God didn't
[2:08:00] kill my soul he created a new one not
[2:08:04] new as then killed me no remember the
[2:08:07] Bible says that the earth is to be
[2:08:10] destroyed remember annihilated no
[2:08:13] brother ever said nope that's not what
[2:08:14] that means he said it's just going to be
[2:08:17] burnt over and made new I didn't get a
[2:08:23] new soul that's why let you see if you
[2:08:24] watch these doctrines if you don't
[2:08:25] preach them right you can follow one
[2:08:27] side of the other I didn't get a new
[2:08:29] soul but my soul was made new that's
[2:08:34] exactly right
[2:08:34] my soul became new by the new birth new
[2:08:37] birth that's why it's called new birth
[2:08:40] your first birth is making you this my
[2:08:44] first birth is 57 years but my second
[2:08:49] birth my new birth put me back right
[2:08:52] here and then my body has got to obey
[2:08:58] and go back to that that's where the
[2:09:02] change is coming people when we realize
[2:09:04] which they all worry I got this new body
[2:09:06] we got this meal it's your soul it's a
[2:09:14] whole new remember you have new thoughts
[2:09:18] you have new ideas you act different the
[2:09:23] same hand that me and Mark used to drink
[2:09:25] beer with I think that's okay we all
[2:09:27] right now God didn't cut this and I'll
[2:09:30] get me a new one
[2:09:33] he cleaned the desire inside
[2:09:37] and then this obeys this so now our
[2:09:42] problem is is we got that gap in between
[2:09:46] called the spirit memory reason
[2:09:48] conscious fiction imagination we
[2:09:50] remember all the old things we used to
[2:09:51] do we remember that we were centers we
[2:09:53] remember all right
[2:09:57] but we've been changed our thoughts have
[2:10:01] got to come back to this the word that's
[2:10:05] why thoughts must be that's why we're
[2:10:07] being born again the Bible has 66 books
[2:10:11] but it's eternal in 66 books every
[2:10:18] born-again believer has got their soul
[2:10:22] reborn you really don't know the
[2:10:29] property God said he said if you knew
[2:10:30] really what happened to the new birth
[2:10:33] because it didn't just it did it took
[2:10:36] that old person I was and it burnt that
[2:10:39] nature off there used to be and I became
[2:10:42] new I'm at that point to where God saw
[2:10:46] us right here and that Genesis 1:26 I
[2:10:50] swine I love that Genesis 1:26 he shows
[2:10:52] me where I came from and it actually
[2:10:55] shows me where I'm going what I'm doing
[2:10:57] here and where I'm going back to God did
[2:11:01] not give me a new tongue it's the same
[2:11:06] the same old flesh tongue that used to
[2:11:08] curse like a sailor but I hope by the
[2:11:12] grace of God by the rebirth the word has
[2:11:20] changed it to where it brings life and
[2:11:24] not death see that's the whole thing
[2:11:26] when Jesus came he had all this ending
[2:11:28] he didn't need a new birth he didn't
[2:11:30] need a rebirth no he didn't need a
[2:11:34] rebirth he always was that he had to
[2:11:37] come down and human flesh to be a
[2:11:39] sacrifice so that we can have something
[2:11:42] to look to and call him a redeemer and
[2:11:45] then sure he was a redeemer but my when
[2:11:49] I got redeemed listen when it
[2:11:50] brother got redeemed like his deal but
[2:11:53] when I got redeemed that made it
[2:11:56] personal that made it me not the seven
[2:12:00] sons of sceva
[2:12:01] Paul we know see I want to be considered
[2:12:04] in that group that he was talking about
[2:12:06] not the seventh son Paul I know Jesus we
[2:12:10] know wait they all we know but you you
[2:12:16] haven't had a personal experience with
[2:12:17] God yet if you'll go and get a personal
[2:12:20] experience and talk about Paul yeah
[2:12:22] we'll talk but you got to have the God
[2:12:24] that Paul had and man you got to have
[2:12:26] the glad that Paul had because listen
[2:12:29] the devil doesn't bother them the devil
[2:12:31] that devil called Legion he sure he gave
[2:12:35] the human people fit but all it took was
[2:12:39] one son when Jesus put his foot on that
[2:12:42] Shore Legion come running and said son
[2:12:46] of God what are you doing here what are
[2:12:48] you doing here to torment me before my
[2:12:50] time it took one man to walk up in front
[2:12:53] of him and change the whole thing Legion
[2:12:57] we are many many demons jesus said when
[2:13:02] I can't cast out but about 100 I find me
[2:13:06] some help no they said can't we leave
[2:13:10] this man and Jesus said go until he said
[2:13:15] go look at the power that was behind it
[2:13:18] though go and thousands of demons left
[2:13:21] that man thousands of demons why the
[2:13:25] Word of God that word of God is forever
[2:13:28] it will not change let's stand our feet
[2:13:31] it will take us in a rapture but we got
[2:13:34] to realize that when we were born again
[2:13:36] it didn't just make us different
[2:13:39] it made us eternal god bless you thank
[2:13:47] you for putting up with me for a few
[2:13:49] hours
[2:13:49] geez I'm sorry I am I am I hope that
[2:13:57] Ryan did that help you wake up run

[2:14:25] when God can show you something and you
[2:14:28] know what it may be elementary to you
[2:14:30] I mean look some people have told me
[2:14:33] things and honestly in my human and my
[2:14:35] human nature I'm white you should have
[2:14:37] seen that a long time ago but you don't
[2:14:39] say that but but really you look at
[2:14:42] people you go well now somebody look at
[2:14:44] me and go you really didn't know that
[2:14:46] yeah my soul is 18 to 20 years old now
[2:14:50] right now
[2:14:52] when I become born-again it went to that
[2:14:55] condition so now all it's got to do is
[2:14:58] I've got to realize it and head right
[2:15:01] back toward it head right back to that
[2:15:03] condition that we had before the
[2:15:06] foundation of the world
[2:15:07] we weren't there's people come on now we
[2:15:10] weren't there as souls we weren't there
