[0:00] he's not gonna be here all right I'm
[0:12] gonna just keep right on through the
[0:15] part folder on the birth pains I'm just
[0:18] finished right on up and I'm not totally
[0:20] so I'm gonna pass into the baton like
[0:30] the only thing we got never recorded
[0:32] we're not going on so let's recap birth
[0:40] pains
[0:40] what causes birth pains when a message
[0:42] goes out and first of all that message
[0:45] going out and cause the pain because the
[0:47] people are coming out of that system
[0:48] that they're in within the people not
[0:51] just the preaching of the message but
[0:53] the one that people begin to receive it
[0:54] then they're birthed out of that that
[0:57] organizational system they're there in
[1:00] burnt-down of their own ideas and they
[1:02] come forth the birth born by the word
[1:05] and they and when you're born you come
[1:08] out so you come out speak and cry to
[1:10] have a father I believe the message I
[1:12] believe what God has spoken is correct I
[1:14] believe that the way to to the new birth
[1:18] is to repent and be baptized in the name
[1:20] of the Lord Jesus Christ and who his
[1:21] name is and all those things and you
[1:23] keep confessing as you keep growing and
[1:25] you walk into your confession all up
[1:27] until you come to maturity and then
[1:30] finally to birth us from completely out
[1:34] of the world God sent us a message a
[1:37] shout to birth us from the things of
[1:40] this world
[1:40] that's the capstone and it births us out
[1:43] of this and come it's gonna change our
[1:47] bodies it's changing our bodies right
[1:48] now and and when you catch that then you
[1:52] begin to speak the same thing and that's
[1:55] what's going to cause the Damned to be
[1:57] raised as when the pride is saying the
[1:59] same thing that was spoken by the
[2:01] prophets message and so what's pulling
[2:04] us up was doing all the turning and the
[2:06] pulling him
[2:07] is this message the capstone message
[2:11] that the prophet priest that he brought
[2:13] today that he the the shout as the bride
[2:17] begins to catch the message then she's
[2:19] birthed from the things of this world
[2:22] out of the earth out of the things of
[2:25] this world that's why I preached to miss
[2:28] a long time ago called earthly shackles
[2:29] because all of our creeds and our dogmas
[2:32] are things they're all up shack loans to
[2:34] the earth and as you believe the word
[2:36] then those shackles are broken until
[2:39] finally the last shackle is broken and
[2:41] you can brush death off your own
[2:44] sickness comes up your honor you brush
[2:46] it off because you have become the word
[2:48] and so that's why we'll say you know
[2:51] when brother I preach the message the
[2:53] rapture
[2:54] it changes the way we perceive the
[2:56] rapture because we used to you think
[2:58] well the rapture was like this event
[3:00] that like the how they make movies of
[3:02] things about where that one one day just
[3:04] also thereby is disappearing from planes
[3:06] and all kinds of things that is one
[3:08] event but what brother Branham taught
[3:10] the rapture is is a process where you
[3:13] begin to you it really starts when it
[3:16] starts on a clothesline in religion
[3:18] where you say I'm not dressing right I'm
[3:21] not doing right I don't want to change
[3:23] the way I am because I heard the word
[3:26] and you start you begin to feed all the
[3:28] things of the world the things of God
[3:30] the thing on the word and it changes you
[3:33] from the things of the world to the
[3:36] things of God and that's a long process
[3:39] maybe because because it's really found
[3:41] that it depends on how much you can open
[3:44] your heart to the work to the word open
[3:47] your heart to receive God so I might
[3:49] want to when the kid was asking me how
[3:50] long does it take to be adopted and you
[3:53] can look at the disciples you just say
[3:54] well they say that were with Jesus for
[3:56] three and a half years and after that
[3:57] three years the spirit fellow limit the
[3:59] day of Pentecost and boom they shout up
[4:01] all the virtues were manifested in them
[4:03] so it really it depends home and how
[4:06] much word you can receive how much you
[4:09] could
[4:09] yourself up two and and that's really
[4:11] what the constraint is the God has been
[4:14] waiting on the readiness of the bride
[4:16] all these years he's been waiting on us
[4:17] to get ready because we to be an honest
[4:20] to do for round we don't give enough we
[4:22] don't dedicate ourselves to the word we
[4:24] don't get into the message and read
[4:26] about it and find it and see what it's
[4:28] really saying but back at the point I
[4:30] was trying to make people have have had
[4:34] a incorrect conception of what it means
[4:36] to miss the rapture to miss the rapture
[4:39] you could be missing the rapture right
[4:41] now if you're not in the books and the
[4:43] tanks you're not listening to what the
[4:46] prophets said because this is the
[4:48] rapture the rapture is the word that the
[4:50] prophets in and if you you know you so
[4:55] if you're not if you're not paying
[4:57] attention to what the message is you
[4:59] could be missing the rapture right now
[5:03] and so so these birth pains the birth
[5:07] pains are the producing the word and us
[5:10] producing a change in the world and we
[5:12] know that the change has to be in us
[5:14] first before the world can be redeemed
[5:16] that but all of these things are kind of
[5:19] happening simultaneously you can see
[5:21] that the three loaves world war one
[5:23] world war two all their four things we
[5:25] talked about last time all the
[5:26] earthquakes and things and it was at
[5:28] this 8.0 earthquake in Alaska just
[5:30] recently all these things are taking
[5:32] place in the world because there's
[5:34] something taking place in the bride and
[5:37] that has a it produces a chain reaction
[5:39] right that because there's a change of
[5:42] happening in the bride there's a change
[5:44] happening in the earth as well so what I
[5:47] wanted to kind of finish this last
[5:49] little little surgical lesson home is
[5:51] Anna's the bride is being birthed
[5:54] there's a twin produced because brother
[5:57] branham always taught in every revival
[5:59] there's a twin producer there's been
[6:01] carnal and the spiritual just like Isaac
[6:04] and Rebekah when they had the children
[6:06] they had to take it from Esau and then
[6:08] we're at war in the womb because that
[6:10] carnal and this
[6:12] always at war they're always fighting
[6:15] because they can't agree with one
[6:16] another they were at war all the way
[6:18] back to the beginning of in the Garden
[6:20] of Eden when when Cain and Abel came
[6:23] forth and came knock table upside the
[6:27] head with a stone or whatever he did and
[6:29] that continues all the way down word
[6:32] goes forth and somebody believes it
[6:34] because to confess it and say this is
[6:36] what it really is it produces it
[6:40] produces conflict because there's this
[6:42] twin being born and what what what's
[6:46] happening is this twin is an
[6:48] impersonation of the real thing and if
[6:50] you want to really around them even even
[6:52] talk that it gets as we get closer to
[6:54] the end time the impersonation gets
[6:56] closer and closer and closer you start
[6:58] out with like a cane move on up to Esau
[7:01] and then finally you've got a Judas
[7:04] that's right there putting his arm
[7:05] around Jesus with the money bag right in
[7:09] there with the camp casting out Devils
[7:11] he's right there next to the word made
[7:15] flesh he's right in there so you know
[7:18] we're gonna look at how you know I said
[7:20] that as birth pangs they produce they're
[7:22] ultimately going to produce in this
[7:24] world council two churches that bundles
[7:27] up all the all the denominational
[7:29] systems and and through that the Roman
[7:33] Catholic Church has an opportunity to
[7:35] influence the world economic situation
[7:38] but you know really that's not going to
[7:40] deceive the message believer what what
[7:43] the real the real doesn't there's a
[7:45] house they have another twin there's
[7:48] right sitting in the church right next
[7:51] to you
[7:51] a carnal and person ATAR that's that
[7:53] claims to believe the same message that
[7:55] you do but it doesn't go all the way and
[7:59] that's really what the impersonator does
[8:00] is they stop and just a sanctified life
[8:03] and they don't continue own like Jesus
[8:06] failed to do
[8:08] continue on to Pentecost he didn't go
[8:10] all the way and we know that's that's
[8:15] really the the Gospel message is to keep
[8:19] moving on as God as the message keeps
[8:21] moving on this fried keeps moving on and
[8:24] follow us with the work because when you
[8:25] don't continue to go on then you'll
[8:28] follow by an end innominate which is
[8:31] what happens is each message went forth
[8:33] Paul's message went forth something I
[8:35] came after him pullback denominated him
[8:37] and God
[8:38] mark Cyrenius mark mark and Colombo each
[8:42] of these men they preached a message in
[8:44] and they fell back and the people could
[8:46] not continue o and continue all this
[8:49] with the message and so they feel like
[8:50] in the denominator so a carnal the
[8:54] carnal twin can't impersonate the work
[8:57] and we're gonna look at another example
[8:58] as Janice and jammers who they could
[9:00] impersonate maybe they're throwing down
[9:02] the snake the sign in the in the hand
[9:05] all the different things but when it
[9:06] came to the word to follow that word out
[9:10] of Egypt to leave them aside all of
[9:12] Egypt and and speaking the word they
[9:15] could not be personate that so you know
[9:17] look at this there's a lot of things
[9:19] that you could impersonate you could say
[9:21] I've been taught there's a a just a
[9:24] natural that when you're born of their
[9:26] mother earthly mother and father you
[9:27] could you you even maybe have a natural
[9:31] virtue or you can speak words of
[9:33] encouragement to help people natural
[9:36] temperance and patience and all these
[9:38] things could be impersonated but when it
[9:40] comes to the opening of the word for
[9:42] this to the to the third pool you can't
[9:44] impersonate that you can't personate the
[9:46] third pool because the third pool is
[9:49] that the word open knowledge a super
[9:54] knowledge is super anointing and
[9:57] speaking the word and so another thing I
[10:01] want to bring out is is look at look at
[10:04] like Joshua and Caleb as they got to
[10:06] Kadish barn even then you really got an
[10:09] example of the of the two
[10:11] spirits right there one Joshua and Caleb
[10:13] were saying what God is able to deliver
[10:15] the Giants into our hands and and / they
[10:19] were it was really wanted to be and I
[10:21] wanted to be in a situation the whole
[10:22] rest of the group said well I don't
[10:25] believe that and so it came down to what
[10:27] their confession was one said I believe
[10:29] that God is able to take us over the
[10:31] other said I don't believe God is able
[10:33] to take us over all the others until
[10:36] they were ready to kill Joshua and Caleb
[10:39] and that's that same story of the
[10:42] conflict being repeated all the way down
[10:44] and so you know I really think that that
[10:48] we're seeing that kind of repeat even
[10:50] now when Joshua and Caleb
[10:52] maybe maybe frame with the statement
[10:55] that Joshua and Caleb made like this I
[10:57] believe that God is able to produce
[10:59] adopted sons and daughters of God I
[11:02] believe that the adoption time is now
[11:05] and everybody else was looking like like
[11:09] maybe like Balaam did all the people he
[11:11] saw the hinder parks he saw the the bad
[11:14] things the ones that weren't moving fast
[11:16] enough and he looked down on the people
[11:18] and said I don't see nothing moving in
[11:21] them I don't really see I can't
[11:23] recognize the pillar of fire and so you
[11:26] see those two one has a confession I
[11:28] believe that God is able to take us over
[11:31] and the other can't quite get there and
[11:34] so I would caution you and this time I
[11:37] believe this is adoption time I believe
[11:39] now is the time when God is a dumb
[11:42] brother and I said that way back and
[11:44] what 1960 1963 a long time ago its
[11:47] adoption time but now you can see more
[11:51] than ever something better to happen
[11:53] because like let me go to this this
[11:56] first the second slide they just
[11:59] adjusted the
[12:00] Doomsday Clock meant from three minutes
[12:02] to midnight to two minutes to midnight
[12:04] because of what's going on in North
[12:05] Korea you can look at the signs of the
[12:07] times all around the world and we know
[12:10] we don't base it on a calendar like a
[12:11] date or anything like that but just
[12:14] looking at the signs of the times
[12:15] something somewhere is happening to
[12:18] somebody and you say well I don't see
[12:21] nothing happening in this church let's
[12:23] say let's just say for example that
[12:25] there is nothing happening in this
[12:26] church but there's something happening
[12:28] somewhere somebody is going to be
[12:31] adopted and somebody is going to take a
[12:33] hold of the word and believe it
[12:34] because it's already been spoken God
[12:37] promised it his prophet spoke and
[12:38] somebody's taking taking it and running
[12:40] with it and I would rather it be man so
[12:44] I'm gonna I'm believing I believe that
[12:47] is able I believe I believe that God is
[12:49] able to take us over he is able to by
[12:52] the power of a spoken word that we have
[12:55] heard the changes in to adopts his sons
[12:57] sons and daughters of God so let's let
[13:02] me go back to this slide this is the
[13:05] this is a 1961 Brook where brother
[13:07] Branham said he was talking about how
[13:10] the Doomsday Clock was three minutes to
[13:12] midnight and we know that since then the
[13:13] Doomsday Clock is oscillating backwards
[13:16] and forwards and it's not necessarily an
[13:18] accurate measure it's precisely where we
[13:22] are as far as the dangerousness all
[13:24] these these are scientists and whatnot
[13:26] they kind of put together a little
[13:27] visualization see the people kick in a
[13:30] picture where we are as far as the how
[13:33] close we are to somebody dropping a
[13:35] nuclear bomb and so they just like the
[13:37] last week or so they move this to two
[13:39] minutes to midnight as an indicator that
[13:42] there's some stuff going on in the world
[13:44] that people should be concerned about
[13:46] doesn't North Korea is waving their
[13:48] hands and they're saying that Russia is
[13:49] behind it and all this kind of stuff and
[13:51] just a reminder that all these things
[13:54] we're not looking for a particular world
[13:56] of being to change our bodies what we're
[13:58] looking for is the word or change our
[14:00] body
[14:01] but this shows that there's something
[14:02] taking place is what's taking places in
[14:05] the bride there's a people that are
[14:06] catching on to what the message heat is
[14:09] their bodies their their their lives are
[14:13] being changed and it's causing a
[14:15] reaction worldwide and you can see see
[14:19] that it's going to produce twins and the
[14:23] twin that the other twin is this world
[14:26] council of churches that is coming
[14:27] together they're saying that I want to
[14:29] have that all together this year the
[14:32] middle of this year and what that will
[14:34] allow the Roman Catholic churches is
[14:36] through that World Council of Churches
[14:38] that is coming together in then they're
[14:41] a man-made unity it will all have a
[14:43] Roman Catholic Church to begin to
[14:45] influence the economy and begin to put
[14:48] things into place and everything and and
[14:50] it will reproduce what has been going
[14:54] down through all the ages the great
[14:57] conflict that where the devil is after
[15:00] the bride you see and so then then you
[15:03] got things like a brother man talk about
[15:05] one day that doors will close and the
[15:07] doors are kind of close now because
[15:09] there's all these people who are saying
[15:11] things about how don't listen to the
[15:13] five-point ministry don't you don't need
[15:15] to go to church and so that closes the
[15:17] doors in one way but one day the doors
[15:20] of the churches will be closed so that
[15:22] you can't go to church anymore unless
[15:24] you are under this World Council of
[15:26] Churches system and then it'll be like
[15:29] when when the door of the Noah's Ark was
[15:33] closed
[15:34] God closed he allowed the door to be
[15:36] closed Noah's Ark he'll allow this doors
[15:39] to be closed and you'll see something
[15:41] happen then I believe our births must
[15:45] have pain and that's what when the
[15:47] message goes forth it produces a
[15:49] conflict and that's what it produces a
[15:51] sorrow in your life as you struggle as a
[15:53] word was being born and so he just kind
[15:56] of took a recap and earnestly continued
[15:59] for the faith that was once looked at
[16:00] the same way back in 1950
[16:02] brother branham said just as there was
[16:04] pains and growing's in the first birth
[16:06] birth of natural or have to be the same
[16:09] thing in the second making a man a new
[16:12] creature in Christ Jesus there's got to
[16:16] be fenders god we talked about that
[16:17] there's got to be a gardener yes Emily
[16:19] there's got to be a crucifixion a public
[16:22] crucifixion and so look for that public
[16:25] crucifixion when a bride is vilified
[16:27] they say talking about how when Jesus
[16:29] was publicly crucified what more could
[16:32] be what what more horrible think that it
[16:35] be did for people to laugh and mock him
[16:37] and scorn for the word that he preached
[16:39] it's one thing to be hung up there on
[16:42] the cross but when people pointed you
[16:44] and say well these people aren't
[16:46] Christians and Keena my wife and I were
[16:47] talking about even now today when she
[16:50] goes into Walmart or anywhere you can
[16:52] see it's like people hate somebody this
[16:55] wearing a dress I was walking behind my
[16:57] family at a part recent land and and
[17:00] these young girls were walking by they
[17:02] began to laugh and what who do they
[17:04] think they are wearing their dresses and
[17:07] you think that people are more receptive
[17:10] to that kind of thing in this modern day
[17:12] but people hate it you know like I was
[17:15] thing about the Nazis when when when
[17:18] they kind of pull the the gates back of
[17:20] the restriction on the people and gave
[17:22] them an opportunity people to shoot
[17:24] people in the back of the head there
[17:26] were many people that were willing they
[17:28] were glad they were happy to shoot
[17:31] people in the back of the head and you
[17:32] think there's an undercurrent today of
[17:34] people around in the world that would be
[17:37] happy if it's just the restrictions of
[17:39] the laws were Unleashed they would be
[17:42] willing to do some pretty horrible
[17:43] things and that's what's going to come
[17:45] on the face that's what's going to
[17:47] happen during the tribulation all
[17:49] Jacob's trouble all those things because
[17:51] there's got to be a purging the people
[17:53] that cannot come all the way now well
[17:56] that will give them an opportunity to be
[17:58] purged under the sixth seal of perfect
[18:01] of the world all those things the but
[18:05] you don't want to be purpose that will
[18:07] because if the if the things that they
[18:10] endured on their Eichmann and Stalin and
[18:12] during the Dark Ages or think about how
[18:15] horrible that was we don't want to go
[18:18] through the tribulation it's time to to
[18:21] open our hearts fully to receive the
[18:23] gospel that we've heard now so that the
[18:25] word can be born in us because we don't
[18:29] want to I think sometimes we kind of get
[18:32] so caught up in the theological aspect
[18:34] of well God's going to save other people
[18:37] then then the ones that hear the message
[18:39] that's true now that's true but but
[18:41] think about what those people would have
[18:42] to go through to go through the
[18:44] tribulation or to stand in from the
[18:47] white throne judgment without knowing
[18:49] what you're standing on you're just
[18:51] being you just in from the white throne
[18:53] judgment being judged no not only based
[18:56] on his works but upon your works so
[18:58] certainly there will be salvation to
[19:01] those that don't hear the message
[19:02] there'll be many people saved but we
[19:04] want to receive the word that we've
[19:06] heard now hear the gospel now but let me
[19:11] hurry I'm not I'm not going to give in
[19:12] my slides so it's this is adoption time
[19:15] and brother Graham way back in 1953 and
[19:19] the valley full of ditches says it's
[19:21] adoption time he said that's what's
[19:23] matter today brother the church ought to
[19:25] be an adoption right now bring into the
[19:27] full favours of God but the thing we're
[19:30] ups and downs and ins and outs and ups
[19:32] and downs and in and out del God can't
[19:34] trust us with nothing hardly and then
[19:38] this day the Scriptures fulfilled he
[19:40] talked about the pains that the world is
[19:42] going through and finally she had birth
[19:44] planes pulling up blowing up pull them
[19:46] all up until she delivered a son of the
[19:48] gospel which was the Word made flesh
[19:50] which is really the focus of what I've
[19:52] been running out and bringing forth that
[19:55] son of the gospel word made flesh again
[19:58] now bring Jesus Christ to his bride he
[20:02] said in this day
[20:03] scriptures were fulfilled in 1965 that's
[20:06] why the churches in birth pains for the
[20:09] deliverance of the son
[20:10] and things that are to be he said that
[20:13] you've got to be born again he said that
[20:15] why goes to show there's more for you so
[20:17] you're craving it your little birth
[20:19] pains are coming home so you need more
[20:21] so that we can be happy and free and
[20:23] perfect we got to be and then in unity
[20:28] now this is the scripture that I was
[20:31] listening to some denominational
[20:33] preachers recently and they will bring
[20:34] it out really it's just really amazing
[20:37] what some of them are preaching about
[20:39] the World Council of Churches coming
[20:41] together and how that they're using like
[20:43] Kenneth Copeland and Tony Palmer and
[20:45] others are using these scriptures
[20:47] ephesians 4 11 and 12 Malachi 4 5 and 6
[20:51] to justify the World Council of Churches
[20:54] to come together and so the word is
[20:57] bringing the bride together which you
[20:59] know a lot of skeptics and things the
[21:02] young people so lots of people even
[21:04] around the message say well it seems
[21:06] like the message believers are not in
[21:08] any kind of unity there's all these
[21:10] disagreements and things everybody that
[21:12] seems like they're at each other's
[21:13] throats and and you know to a point I
[21:17] would agree honestly and ministers
[21:19] meetings everything that seems like
[21:20] there's not too much agreement but
[21:22] there's one thing that I'm assured of is
[21:24] that the bride all around the world is
[21:27] coming to a unity that what's he
[21:29] bringing them together is the Spirit of
[21:32] God as uniting the bride and it might be
[21:34] like brother Adam tall and it is a small
[21:38] small group of people all around the
[21:41] world one here one there but all around
[21:44] the world are coming together into a
[21:45] unity of faith that is not going to be a
[21:47] you
[21:47] at some particular geographic location
[21:50] but as the unity under the word now what
[21:54] the World Council of Churches is trying
[21:55] to do is they're trying to produce a
[21:57] unity based on just same way everybody
[21:58] we just saw all roads lead to God we're
[22:01] just all one instead of coming to the
[22:03] word they're trying to trying to create
[22:05] this man-made unity but they read this
[22:08] scripture scripture I was listening
[22:10] Kenneth Copeland read this I'm just
[22:12] going on the internet so he read it he
[22:17] read this scripture too we all come in
[22:19] the unity of the faith and of the
[22:21] knowledge of the Son of God unto a
[22:22] perfect man unto the measure of the
[22:24] stature of the fullness of Christ and we
[22:26] his more be no more children tossed to
[22:28] and fro and carried about with every
[22:30] wind of doctrine by the sleight of men
[22:32] and cunning craftiness whereby that a
[22:34] lot they lie in wait to deceive but
[22:36] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[22:38] into him in all things which is the head
[22:40] even Christ and so they read this about
[22:43] coming into the unity of faith and yeah
[22:45] it's interesting too that they read
[22:47] about the sliding men and cunning
[22:48] craftiness because that's exactly what's
[22:50] happening yeah by that cunningness and
[22:52] their craftiness and saying words of the
[22:57] you know encouragement to one another
[22:58] and it looks so beautiful and so
[23:00] wonderful but seeing how you can
[23:02] impersonate all the way up you can
[23:04] impersonate it looks good a kind no
[23:06] priest somebody that's real sweet and
[23:08] humble and and looks nice and fine on
[23:11] that on the outside but they can
[23:13] impersonate the word they cannot
[23:15] impersonate the third pole what's the
[23:17] third pole will effectively blame the
[23:19] third pole is this because you come
[23:21] through three pools of your own journey
[23:23] where you start off in a justified by
[23:27] the new birth you you are just there's
[23:30] who can only think of the charge of
[23:31] God's elect agonic begins to produce a
[23:34] sanctification by the word in Washington
[23:36] you by the word a higher form of sense
[23:38] of sanctification until you come up to
[23:41] the headstone where he you you hear the
[23:44] message for your day from
[23:45] the message being from that now we know
[23:48] we believe all the message from 1953 or
[23:51] whatever all the way up to 1965 but the
[23:54] shout the message the capstone began in
[23:57] 1963 when when it really began to preach
[24:00] the seals and preach all the all of all
[24:04] of this and so that's that's when when
[24:07] you feel that cool when that pulls you
[24:09] up you enter into the third pool and
[24:12] that is something that cannot be
[24:14] impersonated I've been back I want to
[24:18] appreciate this and so so when when
[24:23] something that happens when a revival
[24:25] happens and we know this this is the
[24:27] greatest revival of all that's right
[24:30] look you know people say the Bible days
[24:32] are over but when the word begins to
[24:34] open up to the bride there's a revival
[24:37] fire and you that will never burn out
[24:39] because it's been kindling you and it
[24:42] just keeps growing it grows from the
[24:43] face olive oil is come on come back
[24:53] and so when a revival is preached
[24:57] now revival always produces twins and
[25:00] that's why we're talking about twins
[25:02] whenever there is art available it
[25:04] always produces twins that's the root of
[25:06] Martin but it's true when it was a birth
[25:07] from I produce twins when the world was
[25:10] created produce twins to trees and it
[25:12] goes on down that one look to the
[25:14] natural intellectual the other one walk
[25:16] by the spirit and that innovation apart
[25:20] that's that's the dangerous part that's
[25:22] what Paul preached it you could have you
[25:24] could understand all mysteries had it
[25:26] fair all knowledge but without love and
[25:28] and now now that's that's the treat part
[25:31] without love because perfect love in
[25:34] your soul is down here but perfect love
[25:36] here is the full redemption of the body
[25:38] that's why people that's what sort of
[25:40] tricks up its up so many people they say
[25:42] well how can you have perfect love until
[25:45] you get all the way up here what about
[25:47] the ones beyond the curtain of time I'm
[25:48] gonna grab one over there and they they
[25:50] he said they all had perfect love
[25:51] perfect love and your soul that's what
[25:55] Redemption is three stages are
[25:57] interesting for your soul it's your
[25:59] spirit lined up and in your body perfect
[26:03] love and in your soul down here but
[26:05] we're coming to this perfect love well
[26:07] you have come into the full unity of the
[26:09] faith where you come to line up
[26:13] perfectly in sync with God's Word
[26:15] matching pieces and brother Brennan said
[26:18] you cannot impersonate the magic pieces
[26:21] where your life matches exactly what was
[26:26] in heaven before the foundation of the
[26:28] world matches exactly that one twenty
[26:30] six seven member you have the the word
[26:33] is now in flesh in you and it matches
[26:36] perfectly with that well I got off my
[26:41] twenty let me get back to this
[26:43] that spiritual seat and here in
[26:46] recognizing acting on the Word of God
[26:47] going to said but that spiritual seed to
[26:50] the Living God though it has to be a
[26:51] sojourner though it has to be a Rambler
[26:53] it always causes separation he says this
[26:57] church settles down see it cannot go on
[27:00] and that's why it's so important to keep
[27:03] moving on we don't say well I believe
[27:05] this put a dot by put a comma because
[27:08] that God will continue to even after we
[27:11] get out of here there will be a message
[27:13] of cheer downs of the endless ages
[27:14] because God will still have more of
[27:17] himself to unfold so don't put a period
[27:20] on the end of your revelation but keep
[27:21] moving home because if you put a period
[27:24] on the end of your revelation down here
[27:26] then you wouldn't be able to move on to
[27:28] verse here you keep moving on up until
[27:31] you come to the full unity of the faith
[27:34] Esau was a very good type of the carnal
[27:36] believer that you've never able to
[27:38] overcome the world
[27:38] he don't that's that's the difference
[27:42] Janice and Jambres didn't want to leave
[27:44] Egypt days and Igor couldn't leave Egypt
[27:49] the King couldn't forsake the things of
[27:53] the world and follow after God Judas was
[27:56] so interested in the money bag and said
[27:59] after that the woman who watched Jesus
[28:01] feeding and all from then on Jews had a
[28:05] problem because he couldn't be get out
[28:07] he couldn't lay down on the things of
[28:09] this world knowing he couldn't he died
[28:11] there's gotta be a death to have a
[28:13] birthday man he couldn't lay he loved
[28:17] the things of the world so much they
[28:19] couldn't keep going on until the kingdom
[28:22] was birthed in they still like their
[28:25] Corral their dicks and their manicure
[28:26] makeups and the women on their faces and
[28:28] cutting their hair and still belong to
[28:30] church and all of us and you can keep
[28:32] reading but then carnal and the
[28:35] spiritual because it twins are being
[28:37] born that clock is my enemy
[28:44] the program he talks about in the
[28:47] unfriendly realities of the Living God
[28:48] that the spiritual they got their eyes
[28:50] on Christ because they were elected to
[28:52] eternal life they plant right there on
[28:55] that it takes everything if you take
[28:57] everything it takes everything that God
[28:58] they plant there the other is a nominal
[29:01] man he goes to church he feels just as
[29:03] good as the rest of them goes home oh my
[29:06] that's that's dangerous that's that's
[29:08] the danger zone right there
[29:09] when you come to church and you feel
[29:11] like you've done your religion you've
[29:13] done your religion for the week and you
[29:14] go through the whole exercises and you
[29:16] go home and you say well I'm just as
[29:18] good as the other one there well there's
[29:20] somebody else there that is dying to
[29:22] their self and you soaking up the word
[29:24] and then going home and studying and
[29:26] when they sit in church they don't they
[29:28] don't complain about how long the
[29:30] minister's preaching but they're eating
[29:32] it up and that's the difference between
[29:33] the carnal and spiritual that's how
[29:36] close it is in this day it's gonna be so
[29:39] close where Jesus Judas is putting his
[29:42] own around the word and say I believe
[29:43] the same thing you do I'm casting out
[29:45] Devils I'm doing all this kind of stuff
[29:47] but he's sitting right there amongst the
[29:49] people and so you say well brother Bob
[29:52] are you preaching against me I'm
[29:53] preaching against all of this was if we
[29:56] can all get it get an understanding of
[29:58] how close it's gonna be with I think we
[30:01] maybe wait up like program said in the
[30:04] beginning of why Christ speak he said
[30:06] everybody all well all of us we need to
[30:08] be down in the altar seeking God and
[30:10] praying for God to come in and restoring
[30:14] us the joy of his salvation might as
[30:18] well do the dying now because get it
[30:22] down by the way before before the bad
[30:25] times comes every model produces twins
[30:29] just as Jacob and Rebecca produced wind
[30:31] as he said in the ephesian church
[30:32] changed and Jacob he didn't care how
[30:35] long he had to hang around or whatever
[30:37] he had to do the many thing in his life
[30:38] was the birthright and you know we can
[30:40] look at the birthright of the Old
[30:42] Testament from also some theological
[30:43] standpoint would represent real and all
[30:46] that stuff but brother Aaron was typing
[30:48] that as the new birth there's nothing
[30:50] more important than being born again and
[30:52] nothing more important now in this time
[30:56] then adoption because this adoption time
[30:58] it's time to get adopted because if
[31:00] you're not adopted
[31:01] if you don't come to adoption then
[31:02] you're gonna go by the grave and that's
[31:04] that's one of those things that I know
[31:05] blows a lot of people's minds that I've
[31:07] been kind of talking to my wife about
[31:09] how I honestly I have presented that
[31:12] wrong because the way that you should
[31:15] worry is you can't take a body change
[31:18] without coming to adoption right you
[31:21] can't go in the rapture without coming
[31:24] to adoption because you go by the grave
[31:25] you come up and then you go in the
[31:27] rapture but the body changes what we're
[31:30] talking about and so when I say I've
[31:32] said in the past you can't go in the
[31:34] rapp rapture without that's that's a
[31:38] correct incorrect way of saying it
[31:40] because what we're trying to do is we're
[31:43] trying to go from walking around now
[31:45] sitting in church directly into heaven
[31:48] without without tasting data and so
[31:53] that's what I mean when you you must
[31:57] we're it's an option traffic Jesus and
[32:09] Jews come out of the same tribe and in
[32:10] the same church and even the Holy Spirit
[32:13] of the Antichrist is to be twins so
[32:15] close that will deceive the very elect
[32:16] that's possible hey you know you can
[32:18] even see the twins and the seals if you
[32:20] listen to what brother Wayne has been
[32:22] preaching out as as the Beast set come
[32:24] come and see then then the devil
[32:27] impersonates and he says okay now I got
[32:31] what God is doing and how it goes as a
[32:33] rider now you can see that down through
[32:35] all the church ages but you know it
[32:38] represents something a little different
[32:40] in your own life as you see the word
[32:42] being born in you then you see the rider
[32:44] going away
[32:46] now see see what the devil does they see
[32:48] always he can't he never does anything
[32:50] first there's a quote we're gonna I'm
[32:52] gonna lay that out he's always wanting
[32:54] to see what God does first because he
[32:58] isn't he don't he's not a creator he
[33:00] doesn't have any understanding outside
[33:02] of what he sees God do so he's got a
[33:05] weight firt and that's why you know all
[33:07] these things that are happening in the
[33:09] world are a side effect of what's
[33:11] happening in the bride because the bride
[33:13] God produces his word in the bride and
[33:16] then if the devil looks at that and says
[33:19] okay now I see how to make myself fully
[33:22] manifest in in the Pope in the people in
[33:26] the system and he incarnates himself in
[33:30] the in the people the same way that he's
[33:32] watched God incarnated himself in his
[33:36] people and that's really that's really
[33:38] the twins and he said in in birth pains
[33:45] which again is where I'm getting all of
[33:49] these lessons and them to today is in
[33:52] the womb of the church and in the womb
[33:54] of the church because that's where the
[33:56] bride came out she was called out of the
[33:59] church and then there's another group
[34:01] that's that's called out too but they
[34:03] standard carnal ideas and they don't go
[34:06] on to the new birth and so it produces
[34:08] this this horrible situation and there's
[34:13] a great big system trying to be formed
[34:15] he said called the World Council of
[34:16] Churches and from the womb of the church
[34:18] is coming forth to children you just
[34:21] mark my word the world's and the word
[34:24] must deliver the word bride Church the
[34:26] church has got the believer that could
[34:27] be delivered out of her a bride for
[34:29] Christ then that fell asleep and all
[34:31] ages will make up that bride they come
[34:32] out on the word that they come out on
[34:34] the light from your feet coming to your
[34:35] head she gets greater and more you have
[34:38] to have and so forth as the body grows
[34:40] up so does the body of Christ grow up
[34:42] and then finally the head will come to
[34:45] let's see now he's turned up the bride
[34:48] gets greater and greater
[34:50] but this twin is also gives you greater
[34:52] and greater because they say it's a it's
[34:55] a the devil sees more and more of what
[34:58] he's in a person a demon and so it gets
[35:00] greater and greater from a came to an e
[35:02] so the bail mixed in there somewhere all
[35:06] the way down to Judas right there
[35:08] amongst the people experiencing the same
[35:10] blessings he talks about the two of them
[35:13] are fighting she speaks to bring from
[35:16] with a perfect word and I'm gonna finish
[35:23] up and just hearsay let me let me get to
[35:25] these last few slides
[35:27] he said he's going to produce uh
[35:29] stillborn baby an ecclesiastical system
[35:32] that's going to bring all the
[35:33] denominations together to produce any II
[35:36] saw that hate speaks Jacob I hope you
[35:38] see it a stillborn and their
[35:40] denomination all of them going together
[35:43] all of them going together and and now
[35:46] the Kenneth Copeland is and and the
[35:49] Catholic Church and the World Council of
[35:51] Churches coming together is not just
[35:52] bringing all the denominations together
[35:53] but they're bringing the Muslims
[35:55] together the Jews together everything is
[35:59] going together into this great big thing
[36:01] and so that's what if you go to look at
[36:03] these websites this big conference that
[36:05] they had look at the look at the
[36:06] headlines of this website reconciliation
[36:09] matter this is from this for this
[36:10] meeting in 2017 to they had lack of
[36:14] Christian unity harms gospel witness
[36:16] there's not unity in diversity you think
[36:23] Jellico's Orthodox and Catholics discuss
[36:26] justification and reconciliation and
[36:29] that's what's on their mind is coming
[36:32] back together completely contrary to the
[36:35] word but they don't realize it United in
[36:39] Christ icon this is another one of their
[36:40] big websites working to strengthen the
[36:43] whole body of Christ the mission of
[36:45] United in Christ is to promote the
[36:47] reconciliation of all Christians and
[36:50] Christian churches who profess creatures
[36:52] Christ as Lord and Messiah everybody
[36:55] coming together and so these things are
[36:58] happening behind the scenes that's it
[37:03] let's look at what he said in to hearing
[37:04] recognizing acting on the word just a
[37:08] second not just the carnal church the
[37:10] one out there the regular routine Carl
[37:12] church the Esau group which is what
[37:14] those slides represent the carnal church
[37:17] we got now the Judit Aryan group which
[37:22] is far more treacherous far more
[37:25] treacherous
[37:26] coming right up into the very hands of
[37:28] the blessing and so there's two really
[37:32] groups one that's making this world
[37:35] Council of Churches and the other this
[37:38] sitting right there in the blessings
[37:40] saying they believe the same thing but
[37:43] they'll and I'm gonna finish right there
[37:52] [Music]
[37:56] every day I
[38:09] [Music]
