[7:27] reveal yourself because there's an order
[7:29] to all things and
[7:31] it all has to be in a direct order and a
[7:33] direct line up for us to be able to
[7:36] receive
[7:37] we must be in the
[7:39] right order ourselves
[7:41] in yielding ourselves to
[7:43] you to try to understand
[7:46] so just come and help us lord
[7:48] and direct us in your grace and love
[7:51] we committed to you now in jesus name
[7:54] amen
[7:56] all right revelation 1 we've been on
[7:58] that
[7:59] because we've been on the study of the
[8:01] book of revelations
[8:02] this is the 30 31 messages
[8:08] you don't know how long we'll be on it
[8:09] maybe until the millennium and then we
[8:11] can understand
[8:13] it says the revelation of jesus christ
[8:14] which god gave unto him to show unto his
[8:17] servants which must shortly come to pass
[8:19] and he sent and signified it
[8:21] by his angel and to his servant john who
[8:24] by record of the word of god and the
[8:25] testimony of jesus christ and of all
[8:28] things that he saw
[8:30] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[8:32] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[8:34] those things which are written therein
[8:37] for the time is at hand what the time to
[8:40] understand
[8:42] is at hand all right
[8:44] revelation six
[8:47] one through two one and two and i saw on
[8:50] the lamb opened one of the seals and i
[8:52] heard as it were the noise of thunder
[8:54] one of the four beasts say
[8:56] come and see
[8:58] and i saw and behold a white horse
[9:00] and he that sat on him had a bow and a
[9:02] crown was given to him and he went forth
[9:05] conquering
[9:06] and to conquer you may be seated in the
[9:09] lord that is blessing
[9:11] to the reading of the word
[9:13] now i want us to just leave that up
[9:15] brother joe on
[9:16] revelation 6 because i want us to
[9:19] emphasize a little bit on that you know
[9:22] and i guess brother anderson stood
[9:24] brother joe
[9:26] and we were running one ago and we
[9:27] didn't have anybody on the camera and
[9:30] sitting in the office wondering whether
[9:31] joe was too old
[9:33] we're missing somebody so we had to jump
[9:35] up and grab one and
[9:37] get everything to go with you know
[9:39] we certainly appreciate those brothers
[9:41] for doing all that they do
[9:44] appreciate god putting them in a
[9:46] position to work that they would would
[9:48] be able to uh do these things when it
[9:51] would come up needful
[9:53] amen we appreciate it
[9:55] but they have everybody with us their
[9:57] sister is not a visitor she's been here
[9:59] one time so she's part of us
[10:02] so just make yourself at home now we've
[10:04] been trying to talk a little bit about
[10:07] the um opening of the seals and the
[10:09] different things there in the book of
[10:11] revelations and
[10:12] we were speaking a good bit about the
[10:14] antichrist
[10:17] want to just kind of slide this message
[10:19] in tonight
[10:20] on the scriptural lineup and
[10:23] and then we'll drop back to the
[10:25] uh you know the antichrist and the
[10:28] systems and and the things but i want us
[10:30] to just look at a few things
[10:34] that will maybe be helpful
[10:37] unto us
[10:38] and then father in the line up of it
[10:41] to be able to
[10:43] uh see we've studied revelations
[10:46] one two three four
[10:48] and in revelation four we found that
[10:51] there was a
[10:52] uh four beast
[10:54] and like a lion one like an ox
[10:57] one like a man one like an eagle
[11:00] was in the fourth chapter
[11:02] all right now when we come to the sixth
[11:04] chapter
[11:05] of the uh you know
[11:08] opening of the seals and said when the
[11:10] lamb would open one
[11:12] you know open one of the seals
[11:15] look what he said and i heard as it were
[11:18] the noise of thunder
[11:22] one of the four beasts saying come and
[11:24] see right
[11:26] now that's what we'll be dealing with
[11:27] tonight in that part and looking into it
[11:31] see
[11:31] if you read that the way it's written
[11:33] out there
[11:36] it says simply what and i heard as it
[11:39] were
[11:40] the noise of thunder
[11:42] one of the four beasts didn't come and
[11:44] see
[11:45] that what he heard
[11:48] was like a thunder
[11:50] right
[11:51] but he knew it was the voice
[11:55] of the beast
[11:56] they were saying come and see
[11:59] all right
[12:00] now
[12:03] then it says and i saw and behold a
[12:05] white horse
[12:07] all right
[12:08] see then it opens up into a symbol
[12:12] but now remember
[12:14] and you'll get the point of what i'm
[12:15] driving at for the night
[12:17] that
[12:19] those combat beasts
[12:21] as we'll read in a
[12:22] minute they are the spirit of god
[12:27] that is manifest you know and going
[12:29] forward
[12:30] and
[12:31] then you you'll pick up a few things as
[12:33] we go along
[12:34] and you'll see
[12:36] that it was actually
[12:38] the the combat beast right
[12:41] now father what i'm saying now
[12:44] the combat beast it says come and see
[12:48] so what john saw
[12:51] was shown to him
[12:53] by the combat beast
[12:56] all right
[12:57] now
[12:59] it would be very easy in this day
[13:02] to
[13:03] talk about the combat beast it is for a
[13:05] lot of people in this way
[13:08] and they'll say well now
[13:09] that was brother branham right there you
[13:11] know
[13:13] that you know that first seal
[13:16] i said come and see the beast said come
[13:18] and see but if you'll notice
[13:22] it goes on down to the
[13:24] next seal and it says
[13:27] that there was another combat list
[13:30] right right
[13:31] you'll go on down to the next one
[13:34] and it says the third beast right
[13:36] then you get down to the fourth one
[13:38] which is chapter six and verse seven
[13:40] nine
[13:43] and you'll see that it's talking about
[13:44] then the eagle or the end time amen
[13:48] all right
[13:49] now most of you know
[13:51] for all of the years what i preached
[13:54] about these combat beasts
[13:57] that i believe it's the spirit of god
[14:00] and we've read it and proved it
[14:02] that is
[14:06] revealing or making known
[14:11] the combat beasts have the ability
[14:14] to make things known right right
[14:17] man i mean that's what i want us to
[14:19] consider
[14:21] and then we'll get to the point of
[14:22] seeing really about our age
[14:25] and the eagle you know
[14:28] the anointing
[14:29] but don't just jump over there and try
[14:31] to say well that one that spoke to john
[14:34] must have been brother brown
[14:36] no
[14:37] it wouldn't brother branham it was
[14:39] it was the spirit of god amen right all
[14:42] right
[14:43] and being the spirit of god
[14:45] it was
[14:50] god
[14:51] using
[14:54] someone to speak
[14:55] right
[14:58] he says and i heard
[15:02] i heard as it were
[15:04] the noise of thunder
[15:07] and see that's god speaking amen
[15:11] right right
[15:13] forgive me if i can walk this thing
[15:14] around and hurt it
[15:17] it's funny that i can talk all week long
[15:19] and
[15:20] not run out of voice but then i come up
[15:22] to breach
[15:24] and it starts messing up right
[15:27] but now listen with me
[15:30] see the combat beast is the one that
[15:32] says come and see that's right amen
[15:36] now
[15:38] and he also
[15:39] shows john
[15:42] the white horse rider
[15:44] you know in other words he points him
[15:45] out right shows it
[15:48] right
[15:49] so now it would not it could not be
[15:52] mankind
[15:55] it would have to be
[15:57] something closer
[15:59] to that form than it would to be to just
[16:01] a man right
[16:06] because a man can thunder all he wants
[16:08] to
[16:09] you know run his mouth
[16:12] but that's no good unless god is
[16:14] speaking through it
[16:16] all right
[16:18] you need to point out a lot of things
[16:20] right
[16:22] but he can't reveal nothing
[16:25] right
[16:27] now when i get over the message a minute
[16:29] i want you to think on this very
[16:31] seriously
[16:32] the words of a man goes through your
[16:34] brain
[16:38] when we here goes to our brain our head
[16:42] down into the heart right
[16:45] now if it doesn't go from the head to
[16:47] the heart
[16:50] and we're only dealing with the words of
[16:51] a man right amen
[16:54] and that's what people do
[16:56] i've got scripture
[16:58] i've got quotes
[17:00] i can tell you what i'm
[17:02] saying well and good
[17:07] but is it a revelation that's right amen
[17:09] or is it a head knowledge right
[17:12] that's true
[17:14] that's why it's so hard to follow people
[17:18] you know that really try to preach by
[17:19] revelation right
[17:22] it's easy to follow people that preach
[17:25] about and listen i believe in living
[17:28] right and doing right right
[17:31] i believe what the prophet said the
[17:33] bible says
[17:35] but now if all you're going to preach on
[17:37] is dress and iron clothes and things
[17:40] like that
[17:41] you're only talking to the head
[17:47] and you may change the people
[17:51] because alcoholics anonymous
[17:53] does a great work right right
[17:56] but they don't touch the heart right
[17:58] they touch touching the head
[18:00] all right
[18:03] then getting you to make a decision etc
[18:07] we see a revelation deals in the heart
[18:09] of mankind amen
[18:12] and if
[18:12] no matter what we can say that we can
[18:15] know everything that brother around says
[18:19] that's no good unless it's revealed
[18:22] now there are a lot of the people in the
[18:23] message that believe
[18:25] that
[18:26] you know
[18:27] that is a revelation
[18:31] the quotes i've got written here
[18:34] they say that's the revelation right
[18:36] around that revelation i don't have to
[18:38] have it
[18:39] well
[18:41] the only best way to tell you're lost
[18:43] right right
[18:45] because you can't be saved except to be
[18:47] revealed to you right now that's what
[18:49] that's what demanded i'm holding up the
[18:51] papers
[18:52] i'm saying right he said you can't be
[18:54] saved without faith
[18:57] without a revelation amen
[18:59] the scripture says that no man can call
[19:01] jesus to christ
[19:03] unless it be what from the inside
[19:06] out not from the head
[19:08] but from the heart he speaks out
[19:12] and then he can call jesus to christ
[19:15] all right
[19:17] see then my point of what i want us to
[19:18] look at is
[19:20] just put a title there a noise of a
[19:22] thunder
[19:24] right
[19:25] i'm not going into the seventh thunder
[19:27] or since it don't so don't
[19:29] get excited you're on the internet don't
[19:32] just stay with me where i'm at
[19:34] we'll get time to get there
[19:36] but this is a foundation for that
[19:40] and that's why i read you the other week
[19:42] the prophet said if we don't get the
[19:43] foundation right yeah
[19:46] then nothing else is not gonna fit you
[19:47] know right so we need the foundation we
[19:49] need the truth and follow it but see
[19:52] notice what it says
[19:56] as it were
[19:59] the noise of thunder
[20:01] one of the four beasts saying come and
[20:04] see
[20:04] now we know what he's saying
[20:08] right he said come and see
[20:11] is that simple right
[20:13] we don't have to wonder what he
[20:16] said
[20:21] now the next part of it is when and then
[20:24] when that
[20:25] it says and i saw
[20:27] and behold a white horse
[20:31] now you're going into a symbolic form
[20:36] that
[20:37] even though you can read the words
[20:41] you don't know what it's saying
[20:43] right
[20:45] are you listening i'm just trying to
[20:46] make it as simple as possible
[20:48] when the combat beast says come and see
[20:51] that's no problem
[20:54] you just come and see
[20:56] right amen
[20:57] that's like telling you nothing
[21:00] come to see me well there's no problem
[21:02] with that isn't it all right
[21:05] i mean that's simply me come see me
[21:08] see that combat beast is saying
[21:11] come and sing
[21:13] all right
[21:14] now the world can't even hear that part
[21:19] they can hear letters off of a page
[21:23] but when you start dealing with that
[21:25] thunders we will admit it being the
[21:27] voice of god
[21:29] many people have heard the voice of god
[21:32] right
[21:34] he had spoken unto him
[21:38] but did he do him any good
[21:40] right
[21:42] jesus preached around all over the
[21:44] country right
[21:45] now but did he do any good
[21:49] right
[21:50] why
[21:52] because they couldn't even follow it
[21:54] like in john there when
[21:56] when jesus was talking about you know
[21:59] i'm glorifying me and me with the glory
[22:01] of having people he said i'm glorified
[22:03] in your name and glorified again and
[22:05] those that stood by heard it thunder
[22:10] never heard a word that would say it
[22:12] right no sir
[22:14] right man
[22:17] the bible tells you what was said
[22:20] right
[22:21] right but they heard it thunder
[22:24] man
[22:25] that's why it's got to be the holy
[22:26] spirit
[22:29] to reveal it right right
[22:32] right
[22:34] no man can reveal anything to you
[22:38] amen according brother around jesus said
[22:40] my own life
[22:43] didn't reveal that unto thee
[22:45] he said it was my father which is in
[22:47] heaven
[22:49] the only remember the word is the
[22:51] baptism of the holy ghost
[22:54] so if we don't have the baptism in the
[22:55] holy ghost
[22:57] whatever is said by the prophet the
[23:00] bible or anyone
[23:03] is just a noisy thunder
[23:11] now think about that there's still jesus
[23:12] in a voice boat and he heard what was
[23:15] said
[23:16] right but everybody else heard it go
[23:21] a blue
[23:26] would it be possible that we could
[23:28] actually sit right here
[23:32] and
[23:33] hear the very words of god
[23:35] that would be able to deliver us
[23:40] and yet
[23:42] it would wind up to be only just words
[23:44] that are touching the head
[23:48] right and not the heart right
[23:54] would make us good people
[23:58] we would go to church
[24:00] rejoice
[24:04] there anything wrong with the pharisees
[24:06] life
[24:08] you know in the time of jesus right oh
[24:11] no right amen was there anything wrong
[24:14] in their worship in their
[24:17] right
[24:20] no they live the word to the letter amen
[24:23] right
[24:24] but yet when the god of the letter stood
[24:27] before him
[24:29] they couldn't hear his voice right
[24:33] now they heard words in their ears
[24:36] their brain could translate that
[24:40] and if they were were
[24:43] greek
[24:44] but was capable of understanding will
[24:46] you know i know jesus spoke
[24:48] uh
[24:51] the former what is it
[24:54] aramaic
[24:56] which was a common language
[24:59] but that greek he had been trained he
[25:01] could understand
[25:04] right
[25:05] his mind could translate
[25:08] what jesus was saying
[25:12] from the paramedic or whatever back into
[25:15] to the
[25:16] greek
[25:19] didn't have any problems with that
[25:21] that's right
[25:23] well i was talking about the other day
[25:24] about it
[25:26] the bible says it that jesus spoke in
[25:28] parables
[25:30] right and he didn't speak to the people
[25:32] without a parable
[25:34] the disciples would ask him later
[25:37] and he would describe or explain
[25:40] the parables that's right
[25:42] all right
[25:44] finally the pharisees began to realize
[25:46] hey
[25:46] he's talking about us
[25:48] they caught on you know
[25:50] all right
[25:51] but it was done too late to see the god
[25:54] right they were standing there
[25:56] all right
[25:57] now
[25:59] see then the combat beast
[26:03] told john said come and see
[26:07] but it was like a noise of thunder
[26:11] because that was the voice of god amen
[26:16] see those combat beasts
[26:18] they have no voice of their own and
[26:20] we're talking about the heavenly the
[26:22] doings now when they drop the earth
[26:23] we're not dealing with that we're up in
[26:25] heaven okay
[26:30] those combat beasts have no voice of
[26:32] their own
[26:36] nobody understand what i'm trying to get
[26:37] across they have no voice of their own
[26:39] that's right when they come to earth and
[26:42] become the lion the oxen and the eagles
[26:44] now you've got voices right right
[26:47] you see they have no voice of their own
[26:49] because they are the spirit of god right
[26:52] that's right
[26:53] that's why it says annoys like a thunder
[26:59] the thunder of god is a
[27:02] is the voice of god
[27:05] it thundered at mount sinai amen
[27:10] but the people what did they do right
[27:15] now he spoke from mount
[27:18] sinai not just that there was a thunder
[27:21] going on right he was speaking
[27:27] but when it came down to the earthly
[27:29] form of mankind
[27:31] all i could hear was
[27:35] and they got scared
[27:40] i've got in here a couple of questions
[27:42] one of them is
[27:43] have we heard the voice of god
[27:47] or has it been the voice of a man
[27:50] amen
[27:57] i'll repeat this about a dozen times
[28:00] okay
[28:02] the voice of man will touch you in your
[28:04] head
[28:06] right amen
[28:07] the reasoning factors of mankind
[28:11] god speaks not to your brain he speaks
[28:14] to your heart
[28:16] you may have to use your brain sure to
[28:18] go through that's right well that's the
[28:20] human element
[28:23] that's why when a man really when god
[28:25] speaks to him in his heart there ain't
[28:27] nothing to do with it he might we'll
[28:28] leave him
[28:35] if god spoke right
[28:37] now
[28:38] if it's only what man spoke
[28:42] another man with eloquent words
[28:45] can convert that person over to
[28:47] believing like what they're saying
[28:48] that's right right
[28:53] if god ever speaks to you
[28:57] it don't matter tomorrow you might not
[28:58] just forget it
[29:02] because he's speaking to the heart right
[29:05] right
[29:07] all right then
[29:09] if he's speaking here
[29:12] and this combat beast
[29:15] he's speaking to john
[29:21] see then we can call it a line we can
[29:23] call it an ox we can call it a man we
[29:26] can call it an eagle right right but
[29:28] what is it
[29:31] it's the voice of god right
[29:35] speaking through
[29:36] someone
[29:40] then being the voice of god then we
[29:42] don't have to worry about it
[29:44] all we got to do is believe it
[29:47] but i remember my point and listen
[29:51] see then when we read the first one it
[29:53] says
[29:54] you know
[29:56] the first combat beast
[29:58] well if i want to run that over and i
[30:00] said to brother brown and put it all
[30:01] over there
[30:03] that's what i want you to see
[30:08] that first combat beast
[30:12] on earthly terms
[30:16] was the line of the tribe of judah
[30:20] the word of god going out in the early
[30:23] ages
[30:28] the voice of god right
[30:30] sure
[30:32] that's why paul and them could be so
[30:34] stern and straight
[30:36] about what they would say that's right
[30:41] they didn't compromise
[30:44] they said what god said amen
[30:49] to the world their voice was
[30:51] a thunder
[30:54] and if we're not born again tonight we
[30:56] can read the same words
[30:58] that he said back there and it's still
[31:00] just a noise right
[31:05] it's just the noise of the thunder
[31:09] but that thunder through that combat
[31:11] beast is the voice of almighty god
[31:17] delivering
[31:19] the message to john right
[31:22] on patents
[31:24] which is come and see
[31:30] see then he saw why i was writer you
[31:32] don't know
[31:34] and he had a bow with no arrows and the
[31:36] things
[31:40] but my point is is god spoke to you
[31:43] right
[31:44] that's right amen
[31:50] thinking what mama said it's real good
[31:53] you know what daddy said that's real
[31:55] good
[31:57] taking what brother brown said is real
[31:59] good
[32:01] but as god spoke to you and i that's
[32:03] right
[32:04] into our heart
[32:09] not in her head
[32:11] gotta come through there
[32:15] we'll cover if we have time tonight but
[32:17] not we'll get it later
[32:18] but sure this comes down to where the
[32:20] eagle comes right
[32:23] in the end time to bring the message
[32:28] but remember all of those combat beasts
[32:30] have to be the spirit of god
[32:33] that's the only way they can have the
[32:35] voice of god amen
[32:39] is because that combat beast
[32:41] is a manifestation of the holy spirit
[32:46] and when you bring it to earth
[32:50] then you can see that it is the line the
[32:53] word that went out in the early times of
[32:56] the writing of the book of acts and the
[32:57] things
[33:01] the bible says
[33:03] hear his voice
[33:08] now a lot of people have heard the words
[33:10] of god
[33:13] but have you heard the voice of god
[33:14] that's right
[33:16] well what do you mean i don't understand
[33:18] you you talk so much riddles riddles of
[33:20] what
[33:25] how much more simple can that be brought
[33:27] right
[33:30] this bible we hold up we say is the word
[33:32] of god
[33:34] but this bible that we hold up and read
[33:36] from says the letter killeth
[33:42] but the spirit gives life
[33:44] what was wrong with the pharisees and
[33:46] sadducees
[33:48] they had it to the letter
[33:50] amen
[33:51] that was what was killing them
[33:52] right because the letter spoke of a
[33:55] coming messiah
[33:58] but they had it figured out their way
[34:03] and then there was no
[34:05] persuasion
[34:08] to try to change their mind
[34:13] jesus never tried to argue with him
[34:14] about the word
[34:18] matter of fact he used it right against
[34:20] him so did paul right
[34:24] he said the word says
[34:27] well they couldn't argue with it
[34:30] because he was speaking to him
[34:33] about what they claim to be true
[34:36] now what about you and i
[34:40] we claim to follow a message
[34:43] we claim to believe that god spoke to us
[34:45] through a man
[34:46] right amen and that's well and good
[34:48] because we believe that
[34:52] but i believe he spoke to us to us
[34:54] or speaks to us through peter paul james
[34:57] john
[34:58] those that are in the bible don't you
[35:00] right man
[35:03] the only difference is we're in the end
[35:05] time
[35:06] right
[35:07] if we were back there we would be
[35:09] listening to them speak
[35:11] and say that is the voice of god
[35:14] right
[35:16] see then that way we're not putting the
[35:18] emphasis upon the man
[35:22] we're putting the emphasis upon the god
[35:25] that's speaking to us
[35:26] right amen you know the dumb donkey told
[35:29] the prophet one time
[35:31] in the bible
[35:34] spoke to him told him the word of god
[35:36] right saved him from being killed
[35:40] well
[35:44] rooster crew corrected peter
[35:48] why can't we believe that god can speak
[35:50] to us
[35:57] but see the point i want you to look at
[35:59] is is that not we're not trying to get
[36:01] in i preached to you for 40 years about
[36:03] the
[36:04] the combat beasts and how it's the
[36:06] spirit of god down to the ages amen
[36:12] i think it's time to begin to realize
[36:14] that
[36:15] we must hear the voice of god amen
[36:19] by way of the prophet messenger amen
[36:21] right right that's right
[36:25] now we got the part of it right
[36:29] we got the part that we believe the
[36:30] message
[36:34] of course a lot of people don't believe
[36:35] it because they're always trying to
[36:37] change what he said or correct him or
[36:39] something you know right
[36:40] that's their business that's not mine
[36:42] yours
[36:46] which either thunder is the voice of god
[36:52] so now if it's the voice of god
[36:57] then that combat beast must have been
[36:59] god all right that's right right
[37:03] in another form amen
[37:05] right right
[37:10] see then when it came to earth to dwell
[37:12] on the earth then we would start out
[37:14] with the first combat beast being
[37:17] you know the word the line
[37:19] the next one is the ox that goes on down
[37:22] into the chest ages you know when they
[37:24] begin to kill them and and all of the
[37:26] things
[37:28] then it comes out under the minds it's
[37:30] the lime yachts man comes out under man
[37:32] under luther wesley ziegly and
[37:35] knotts and calvin and all of those
[37:38] smart people that begin to bring us the
[37:41] word of god
[37:44] all right
[37:46] you see then in doing
[37:48] that you always say it's easy to follow
[37:52] the first three combat beasts and it'll
[37:54] be it'll be a spirit among the people
[37:59] brother brandon there on the first seal
[38:00] i think it is i've got it in the notes
[38:03] said i want to put this box up here
[38:06] said to represent
[38:09] he said the spirit of god that was being
[38:11] used
[38:12] you know doing
[38:14] but that's what i want you to see
[38:18] if it's a noise if it it you know
[38:22] if it's a noise of thunder
[38:24] it's the voice of god right yes
[38:30] see then when you come down to the age
[38:32] it's the line the ox to man that's fine
[38:34] you can follow those but then the end
[38:36] time people will deal only with brother
[38:37] brown as equal
[38:40] they won't listen to where he says when
[38:41] the eagles come
[38:46] and then they'll halfway listen to where
[38:48] that we're little eaglets
[38:51] you know
[38:56] but you realize if somebody tells you
[38:59] the truth
[39:04] and they have the holy spirit
[39:06] and they're speaking to you
[39:09] what is the difference in that voice and
[39:11] the voice of almighty god that's right
[39:13] that's right now i made it out to where
[39:14] i said it right if they tell you the
[39:16] truth now all this blame you know
[39:17] babbling and all this other stuff they
[39:19] don't amount to nothing but
[39:23] but if a true person with a genuine
[39:25] baptism of the holy ghost whether it be
[39:27] man woman child or white that's right
[39:30] and they're telling you the truth
[39:34] then what's the difference in that voice
[39:37] and the voice of god that thundered at
[39:39] mount sinai
[39:41] or the one that spoke in
[39:44] john there when the jesus was standing
[39:46] there
[39:49] see that thunder is the voice of god
[39:52] amen that's why when you do get down to
[39:55] the seven thunders it's simple to see
[39:58] right you hold your channel correctly
[40:00] that the thunder's the voice of god and
[40:02] you'll see that god thundered
[40:05] as the seals were being broken right
[40:10] because when you read your seals if
[40:11] you'll notice there was only one thunder
[40:14] right there
[40:14] on the first seal you didn't put a
[40:16] thunder on the second one right
[40:18] third fourth
[40:20] and then when you get to the fifth seal
[40:22] you don't even have a combat beast
[40:26] you only have four combat beasts right
[40:28] right right you get to the fifth six and
[40:30] seven seal you don't even have a combat
[40:32] beast
[40:34] now i wrote myself a note
[40:36] i ain't even found it yet cut off the
[40:38] nose
[40:39] but
[40:45] how many voices does god have
[40:48] all right
[40:51] now i'm not talking about how he sounds
[40:53] and what he does and through people and
[40:55] you know do it i'm talking about how
[40:57] many voices does he have
[40:59] he has only one voice
[41:05] that's why when the seals broke it
[41:07] thundered amen
[41:10] that's the voice of god amen
[41:12] and only god can tell us what under
[41:14] those what's under those seals
[41:21] so then have we heard the voice of god
[41:23] yeah
[41:24] or have we heard just the voice of a man
[41:27] that's right
[41:30] when we read the bible
[41:33] when we get over to the red letter
[41:34] edition you know it means jesus is
[41:36] speaking
[41:39] do we really hear that is god speaking
[41:41] to us
[41:48] are we still thinking about well that's
[41:50] what luke wrote
[41:53] you understand
[41:55] what people say well
[41:57] that's what matthew said
[42:02] matthew says go out and baptize what
[42:04] name of the father not of the son and of
[42:07] the holy ghost
[42:09] matthew 28 19. that's what he said
[42:14] but over the book of acts they baptized
[42:16] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[42:20] somebody messed up on the voice didn't
[42:22] it
[42:23] they heard the words
[42:25] all right
[42:26] they didn't understand the voice
[42:31] because that voice speaking over there
[42:33] when jesus said it it's in red letter
[42:40] now how come peter and him didn't follow
[42:41] what he said
[42:43] yeah right
[42:46] they bounced out of the name of the lord
[42:47] jesus christ lord jesus christ
[42:53] but he told them it looked like the
[42:54] baptized father son holy ghost
[43:00] because peter
[43:02] by the time that he said what he said
[43:06] he had the inward experience
[43:09] of the baptism of the holy ghost amen in
[43:12] other words he had the spirit of god
[43:13] within him right
[43:15] all right amen those disciples had the
[43:18] spirit of god within them didn't it
[43:20] then they could understand that jesus
[43:23] wasn't saying
[43:26] father son holy ghost
[43:30] because he said it correctly said in the
[43:31] name
[43:32] right
[43:33] singular
[43:35] of the father
[43:36] another son of the holy ghost not three
[43:39] names
[43:41] all right there's only one name
[43:43] right amen
[43:46] just illustrating
[43:49] the words of a man can convert you and
[43:51] put you in the water
[43:54] and you'll go follow it because you say
[43:56] well i've been out arguing
[44:03] put a revelation in your heart of who
[44:05] that is speaking to you
[44:08] and what really happened to her right
[44:13] it won't only just put you in the water
[44:15] it'll put you in the body right you know
[44:18] you just keep right on going until you
[44:19] come into the body of christ because it
[44:22] will come for not dealing with the head
[44:28] it will start coming into the heart
[44:34] and in doing that then we can say that
[44:35] we've heard the voice of god
[44:38] well brother brother daley god never
[44:40] spoke to me
[44:45] who is it speaking to you when you read
[44:46] the bible
[44:49] are you still hooked up what i'm saying
[44:51] luke said that
[44:56] when you're reading your bible who's
[44:57] talking to you
[45:00] i believe in order i'll be red letter
[45:01] myself
[45:04] no not just because of what jesus said
[45:06] right but all of it is what god said
[45:09] right
[45:12] then if i follow it that away
[45:15] see that i can realize what the voice of
[45:16] god is it's a thunder
[45:19] to those who can't understand
[45:25] but to those who can receive it
[45:29] is god speaking amen
[45:32] whether it be the rooster crowd
[45:35] or the donkey brain
[45:37] right
[45:38] it was still the voice of god amen
[45:41] you corrected the prophet
[45:47] but follow my point
[45:50] see
[45:51] look at that combat beast as being the
[45:53] spirit of almighty god
[45:56] and then when it comes to earth
[45:59] it will be made manifest
[46:01] in many people
[46:05] it won't be just one person see no
[46:07] that's right
[46:10] it'll be manifested in many people
[46:14] because it's the voice of god
[46:21] see it was what was combating
[46:24] the antichrist
[46:26] right as it goes forward
[46:30] because it was god speaking through man
[46:37] to man
[46:39] that's right he uses man to speak
[46:42] amen
[46:44] thank god for that like that yeah amen
[46:46] but you remember as i was quoting there
[46:48] a moment ago that mount sinai thundered
[46:52] and they said don't let god speak no
[46:53] more to
[46:54] us now folks whether you like it or not
[46:57] we chose that
[46:59] oh i didn't i wouldn't back there
[47:02] no but if you'd have been back there you
[47:04] would have chose that okay all right not
[47:06] enough
[47:08] you can make all you want to and twist
[47:09] it but it won't work right
[47:13] see they said don't let god speak
[47:17] unless we die said moses you go up find
[47:21] out what god wants us to know bring it
[47:24] back and we'll do it
[47:27] they lied like crazy
[47:29] but when moses went up and got it and
[47:31] brought it back
[47:34] oh
[47:36] you're a man
[47:39] yep
[47:40] is that what you were doing you some
[47:42] kind of a god
[47:44] were you a man just like we are
[47:46] wasn't that their argument with moses
[47:51] moses said everyone's on god's side come
[47:53] over here
[47:55] and you know there was 250 priests
[47:58] there was preachers okay
[48:01] 250 priests
[48:02] carrying
[48:03] cold off the fire
[48:06] in the sensors exactly the way you know
[48:08] the cuts and the things the way they
[48:10] were supposed to do
[48:12] the earth swallowed them up
[48:15] right
[48:20] they took those golden things and
[48:23] beat them up and reused them
[48:25] because it was okay
[48:28] but the people died
[48:31] right in the front of god standing there
[48:33] in a man called moses right he said no
[48:36] he was god no i didn't say that
[48:38] i said god's standing there and a man
[48:40] called moses
[48:41] you didn't listen to what i said
[48:45] brother around him wasn't god right
[48:49] but god used the man
[48:51] to speak to us that's right
[48:54] even one of the texts he said i'm using
[48:56] his voice this is not william bradley
[48:59] i'm using his voice
[49:03] you say a lot of times i don't know what
[49:05] i say
[49:06] i'll have to go back and let play the
[49:07] tape see what i'm saying
[49:12] but you see we we look at that
[49:16] and that
[49:17] voice of god
[49:20] can speak to a child right
[49:24] and tell you the truth
[49:27] that's right
[49:30] no no no brother dale if you don't make
[49:32] anything gotta make it to preachers
[49:34] why because you won
[49:38] is that the reason you want it that way
[49:41] why can't you see the spirit of god is
[49:43] in the bride of jesus christ
[49:46] amen
[49:48] they ask the prophet will the will the
[49:50] bride have a ministry he said she
[49:51] consists of apostles prophets evangelist
[49:54] pastors and teachers she consists of
[49:56] that's
[49:57] puts it all together
[50:00] five four minutes right worth nothing
[50:01] without a bribe
[50:04] i try to direct
[50:07] but you see church that's why i don't
[50:08] speak
[50:10] i know i'm human sometimes i do i
[50:12] blabber a lot
[50:14] and i speak from the head
[50:21] and that's what you see preachers do
[50:22] they
[50:23] they beat you over the head because
[50:25] they're speaking from the head
[50:29] but you see a man that's truly
[50:33] a servant of god he'll speak from the
[50:35] heart
[50:37] he's hard to be understood then
[50:40] that's right
[50:42] because sometimes he'll speak in riddles
[50:45] sometimes
[50:46] right
[50:47] because it's the spirit of god directing
[50:49] him in that path amen
[50:51] but if you've got the spirit of god why
[50:53] are you worried about it
[50:56] right
[50:58] see the thunder's the voice of god
[51:04] now being the voice of god
[51:07] who's it come true that's right man
[51:14] you're going to talk to some of these
[51:15] little kids
[51:17] and ask them some questions
[51:21] you might be surprising how
[51:23] great an understanding they have
[51:29] because they're sitting listening
[51:34] i have more understanding than some of
[51:36] us adults and guys
[51:42] because they're more subject to god
[51:44] right
[51:45] sweeter nicer right
[51:49] but noise
[51:51] of a thunder
[51:56] the noise of the thunder was when the
[51:58] combat beast said come and see
[52:02] right
[52:06] anybody can read that can they
[52:10] but they can they understand
[52:15] that god is speaking to that person
[52:18] or those people you know
[52:20] because that's what the combat beats are
[52:22] right it's god among the people for the
[52:24] age that you're living in time
[52:27] and it comes down to the ego being the
[52:29] lies to sum up all things
[52:34] and see being that eagle then god can
[52:36] speak to him things that even some of
[52:38] the others couldn't comprehend
[52:44] i don't think god's upset because i said
[52:45] it that way
[52:47] you like that
[52:50] see that early age went out under
[52:52] the word
[52:54] the word was pure and unadulterated
[52:58] but that line of that
[53:01] bar was calling it they didn't know what
[53:02] the seals and things were right because
[53:04] it was not time for it to open
[53:06] amen
[53:11] but it was still the spirit of god right
[53:13] amen right
[53:14] all right when the when the ox came out
[53:19] you know the the sacrificial
[53:21] animals the ops and the things and then
[53:24] through the dark ages they gave their
[53:25] lives freely for the gospel uh you know
[53:29] rick fox's book of martyrs and see how
[53:31] many of them was killed what 68 million
[53:35] amen
[53:36] they've slaughtered
[53:42] but that was that spirit of god in them
[53:46] that made them go give their lives
[53:47] freely
[53:50] like it was said a polycarp
[53:52] that he was too old to run
[53:55] i said why don't you deny him he said he
[53:58] can't deny it
[54:00] all right
[54:02] why because he had something in his
[54:03] heart amen right that's right damn it
[54:05] wasn't that polycarp that requested the
[54:08] ones who come to arrest him i believe
[54:09] one would
[54:11] he requested one man did
[54:13] to pray for his enemies that they come
[54:15] to capture him
[54:17] he prayed for me fed him a meal and
[54:19] prayed for him two hours
[54:22] before leaving with him to go be killed
[54:26] spirit was seen as a dove leaving out of
[54:28] him you know
[54:29] fire wouldn't which one was it him that
[54:31] the fire wouldn't even burn he just
[54:33] turned away from him
[54:37] god was honoring
[54:40] that spirit that was within him that's
[54:42] right
[54:43] but you know he couldn't have done that
[54:44] if it hadn't been the word and it began
[54:46] if he didn't have his foundation based
[54:48] upon based upon the fact that the line
[54:50] of the tribe of judah had wrote out
[54:54] the line ministry
[54:58] see neither could lutheran them have
[55:00] come out and been worth anything of
[55:02] their intellectuals
[55:04] points of brains because that's what
[55:05] they were but it was the man
[55:09] brother brown says in the seal book he
[55:10] said
[55:11] god used their intellect
[55:15] to speak out against that
[55:17] bread and wine and things you know
[55:20] i'm telling them that it couldn't that
[55:22] couldn't be
[55:23] right
[55:25] but you know all that was based upon
[55:27] those that had been before them
[55:31] all you and i have is based upon what we
[55:33] have behind us
[55:35] that's right
[55:36] but have you heard the voice of god
[55:41] are you still wondering
[55:50] well brother dale you sound like you're
[55:52] saying that you're god
[55:55] you know the reason you're thinking that
[55:58] is because that spirit on you is trying
[55:59] to make you god in the wrong way
[56:02] i don't mind talking plain
[56:07] because if you've been around here long
[56:09] enough to realize what we're doing and
[56:10] think that i'm trying to make something
[56:12] right you're in bad shape
[56:21] see i'm trying to get you to see within
[56:24] your heart
[56:27] within your heart
[56:29] by the new birth
[56:33] is the only way
[56:36] you can hear the voice of god
[56:38] amen
[56:40] if you don't have the new birth you
[56:42] can't hear it although you hear the
[56:45] words
[56:47] see that's in the head
[56:51] it doesn't drop down into the heart
[56:53] once it drops into the heart of mankind
[56:56] you you can't do anything with that
[56:58] person
[57:02] like those that were back there during
[57:03] the times of the of the killings i mean
[57:05] they were offered
[57:07] to go free
[57:09] if they just recant upon what they
[57:10] believe right exactly
[57:12] amen wasn't it martin luther that they
[57:15] offered him an opportunity
[57:17] to recount on all of his books that he'd
[57:19] read
[57:22] he finally made the statement of what
[57:24] i've written i've written
[57:28] i can't take that back he said because
[57:30] it's a part of me
[57:32] i'm just paraphrasing his words
[57:36] see it wasn't just words on a page to
[57:38] him amen that's right he was trying to
[57:40] describe the god that he was believing
[57:42] was in his heart and getting that to
[57:44] mankind
[57:47] that's all brother branham doing amen
[57:52] he was just describing what god had made
[57:54] known to him
[57:56] into his heart
[58:00] the thunder being the voice of god
[58:05] saying come and see
[58:09] so i can talk all day long about the
[58:11] seals but
[58:13] when something happens to you
[58:18] then you can't change it right
[58:23] once you hear it then you get away from
[58:25] seeing who's who
[58:27] you know
[58:29] you know what i mean in the school they
[58:31] had to who's who well i never could
[58:33] figure out what was what let alone who
[58:36] it didn't matter i didn't get to go to
[58:37] school that much
[58:40] but listen church
[58:43] that voice that speaks to you and i
[58:48] is there one voice that spoke to a
[58:50] prophet
[58:52] and another voice that speaks to you and
[58:54] i yeah
[58:56] where's his son god amen
[58:59] so that's the only way i can know the
[59:01] prophet's right
[59:04] you know how i know the prophet's right
[59:06] you know what i'm fixing to say right
[59:08] you know how i checked the doctrine
[59:12] by my new birth
[59:16] all these doctrines around the message
[59:18] that's right
[59:19] see
[59:21] i checked it by my new birth
[59:25] oh but i i tell you what i i just
[59:27] checked it by the spirit of god that's
[59:29] within me why are you so confused
[59:33] and one of you get
[59:34] caught in all of them you know
[59:39] well i was just wanting to try to help
[59:40] the people you ever heard that over and
[59:42] over i stayed there because i wanted to
[59:45] help the people
[59:48] help them do what not go to hell
[59:54] come on
[59:57] when that prophet began to speak
[1:00:00] i begin to hear
[1:00:02] words
[1:00:06] of the form that i've never heard before
[1:00:08] man
[1:00:09] right in his simple old kentucky
[1:00:12] language
[1:00:14] he began to talk about god
[1:00:17] that's right
[1:00:21] like my wife said even though before we
[1:00:22] ever even left the baptist remaining she
[1:00:25] said that he'd done all the things he
[1:00:26] said he's done said he's got to be a
[1:00:28] prophet
[1:00:36] but you see
[1:00:38] that's what i tried to tell the
[1:00:39] ministers the other day about it i said
[1:00:41] if we're going to believe the prophet is
[1:00:42] being
[1:00:44] the mouthpiece of god
[1:00:45] if he says it's 483 and you figure it
[1:00:48] out to be
[1:00:49] 481.99 people point one point
[1:00:52] well brother reynolds
[1:00:54] no you missed it right
[1:00:56] that's right because you don't believe
[1:00:57] what he said he said 483 right
[1:01:00] well i'm stupid to believe it that way
[1:01:02] well i'm just stupid enough to believe
[1:01:04] amen
[1:01:05] all right let's see what you're doing
[1:01:06] with it
[1:01:07] amen
[1:01:10] i'm just stupid enough to believe what
[1:01:11] he's saying right right now because i
[1:01:13] couldn't figure out the 483 i didn't
[1:01:15] know where to start to find where to
[1:01:16] start at did you
[1:01:21] so when he said it's 483 you can take
[1:01:23] 475 multiplied you come out where you
[1:01:26] get 491
[1:01:29] now 481 point something
[1:01:34] very close to what he's saying right
[1:01:36] then you just checking around to find
[1:01:38] out the calendars have been changed
[1:01:40] three times
[1:01:41] right
[1:01:43] you know what was surprising the other
[1:01:44] day a lot of people
[1:01:46] at that ministry meeting didn't know
[1:01:47] that the calendar had been changed three
[1:01:49] times
[1:01:56] he's the one who told us about the
[1:01:58] gregorian
[1:02:01] julia and what else alexander is
[1:02:04] he's the one who told us about that's
[1:02:06] where i learned that they've been
[1:02:07] changed three times
[1:02:09] by him telling you
[1:02:14] see how we heard it in the head or how
[1:02:15] we heard it in the heart
[1:02:23] because god spoke to you in your head or
[1:02:25] your heart
[1:02:29] he spoke to you in your head like i said
[1:02:31] a while ago somebody else could speak to
[1:02:33] you and convert you to their thinking
[1:02:34] right yeah right but if he spoke in your
[1:02:37] heart
[1:02:38] right there's nothing nobody can do
[1:02:40] might leave you alone
[1:02:47] but think about it
[1:02:49] the voice is a thunder
[1:02:56] but even after all who say it
[1:03:00] we could talk about the combat beast and
[1:03:02] the thunder and the voice of god
[1:03:05] i want to make one life simple
[1:03:06] illustration
[1:03:11] even though it was the voice of god
[1:03:13] through the combat beast it said come
[1:03:15] and see
[1:03:21] when john saw what the combat beast was
[1:03:23] showing him
[1:03:27] and he was a
[1:03:28] prophet
[1:03:30] he saw a symbol
[1:03:35] of a white horse right
[1:03:40] john knew he didn't understand
[1:03:45] but he was told to write it
[1:03:47] right
[1:03:49] that symbol would last 2 000 years
[1:03:54] of mankind and her smartness and the
[1:03:56] best they could do
[1:04:00] but in the end time god would send us a
[1:04:01] prophet amen
[1:04:05] that he could speak to him in his heart
[1:04:09] and he could tell us what those symbols
[1:04:10] were
[1:04:14] before i heard of this message i heard
[1:04:16] the seven church ages talk
[1:04:19] they taught it there at doraville
[1:04:21] general motors there was a man in there
[1:04:23] that was teaching the seven church ages
[1:04:25] and lined up fairly decent
[1:04:27] i said fairly decent
[1:04:34] but you see he couldn't hold it together
[1:04:39] and right around them again to talk
[1:04:40] about those church ages i began to see a
[1:04:42] pattern unfold
[1:04:46] you just keep unfolding
[1:04:50] you would walk right down through time
[1:04:52] and
[1:04:53] come out at the end
[1:04:57] to be god speaking to mankind
[1:05:00] through the voice of a man
[1:05:03] to tell us
[1:05:05] the symbols
[1:05:11] tell us what was said there
[1:05:15] where did that combat beast while he was
[1:05:17] there
[1:05:19] in
[1:05:20] heaven
[1:05:22] are you listening
[1:05:24] i was in heaven couldn't tell you
[1:05:28] no
[1:05:31] that combat beast couldn't tell you what
[1:05:33] that was right or what
[1:05:36] but he was in heaven
[1:05:38] and it was sealed to him
[1:05:44] and all he saw was a white horse
[1:05:46] he knew it was a church symbol
[1:05:49] am i quoting the prophet
[1:05:50] yeah
[1:05:53] but even john admired that
[1:05:55] church
[1:05:57] it's so beautiful right
[1:06:02] it covered him to a point of admiring it
[1:06:04] looking at it it's so beautiful
[1:06:11] but you see in the end time it was to
[1:06:13] come back to work
[1:06:14] a profit was to come
[1:06:17] god could tell us what those symbols
[1:06:19] were
[1:06:24] you know he tried to explain those
[1:06:26] symbols of the seals
[1:06:28] he preached to seal their one in his
[1:06:30] early ministry that's right
[1:06:33] he tried to explain those symbols
[1:06:38] now your profit
[1:06:41] because the seals wasn't broke see
[1:06:44] so it was not he wasn't responsible
[1:06:49] and he preached and it was like prompted
[1:06:51] what the people have said that it was
[1:06:53] cupid with his little bow and arrow
[1:06:55] shooting arrows of love into the hearts
[1:06:57] of the saints right
[1:07:03] your prophet was confused on that
[1:07:10] even though he was a prophet born to
[1:07:12] prophet
[1:07:15] he said i made a horrible mistake that's
[1:07:18] right
[1:07:19] he was fixing to preach it wrong
[1:07:25] you know what
[1:07:26] happened that combat beast from heaven
[1:07:30] got connected with that
[1:07:33] prophet on earth
[1:07:38] and you begin to realize there's
[1:07:40] something wrong
[1:07:43] he said the holy spirit come in the room
[1:07:45] and corrected me on what i was fixing to
[1:07:47] say
[1:07:49] right
[1:07:50] who is the combat beast the holy spirit
[1:07:53] there's only one holy spirit that's not
[1:07:56] why there's only one voice of god
[1:07:59] sure you've got thousands of little
[1:08:01] voices yes
[1:08:03] but every one of them better be the
[1:08:04] voice of god there's no good right amen
[1:08:09] what about it
[1:08:11] have we heard his voice
[1:08:14] has it spoken in our hearts
[1:08:18] or is it only spoken to our heads
[1:08:28] then you see people like we've talked
[1:08:29] about the other day about the man that
[1:08:31] told a brother about it he was wrong
[1:08:33] about jesus's crucifixion because he was
[1:08:36] crucified on wednesday
[1:08:38] wouldn't crucified on friday
[1:08:45] said brother brown had a denominational
[1:08:46] doctrine by believing that no he was
[1:08:48] right backwards that was a
[1:08:50] denominational doctrine then he was
[1:08:51] crucified on wednesday or thursday
[1:08:54] and hung around raised early saturday
[1:08:57] afternoon you never heard that i heard
[1:08:58] them before heard of the prophet
[1:09:00] he raised on saturday afternoon
[1:09:05] and appeared
[1:09:10] on sunday morning
[1:09:12] early the first midway
[1:09:16] because he couldn't be in our 72 hour
[1:09:18] they would have rotten that's right
[1:09:20] but see that's the argument
[1:09:22] right would you ask that person i
[1:09:24] believe everything brother brown says
[1:09:27] but that one time
[1:09:29] yeah
[1:09:31] so we hadn't heard the voice of god
[1:09:33] that's right that's right
[1:09:35] he's thunder in his head
[1:09:38] that's right when he hears the voice of
[1:09:40] god you realize that a prophet
[1:09:43] stands before no one that's right
[1:09:46] yes sir
[1:09:47] the answer is to no one
[1:09:49] even when he preached the white horse
[1:09:51] rider was the holy spirit there was
[1:09:53] nobody even though clarks locked and
[1:09:55] i've told you many times
[1:09:57] way younger maybe almost a hundred years
[1:10:00] before then he preached the white horse
[1:10:02] rider was the antichrist
[1:10:04] but there was no man who could stand up
[1:10:06] there and correct that prophet
[1:10:09] because a prophet stands before god
[1:10:11] alone right
[1:10:12] now i ain't saying brother brown didn't
[1:10:14] that
[1:10:15] you just misunderstanding me go ahead
[1:10:18] he took correction
[1:10:20] when he seen it
[1:10:23] he took correction
[1:10:25] who could tell him
[1:10:29] that's right i've heard people even say
[1:10:32] say bill or the man one time say bill
[1:10:34] and i was talking about this
[1:10:41] well his point was that bill was wrong
[1:10:43] he was right
[1:10:48] well
[1:10:51] i'm just as honest as i can say it
[1:10:54] we may have a lot running around up in
[1:10:55] our head
[1:10:57] we have a very shallow mountain in their
[1:10:59] heart right
[1:11:02] that's right
[1:11:04] what we need is a revelation more than
[1:11:06] anything amen
[1:11:09] are you praying for a revelation
[1:11:14] are you praying for god to speak to your
[1:11:16] heart
[1:11:17] or your head
[1:11:23] there are many many voices that speaks
[1:11:25] to man's head
[1:11:28] he could change his thoughts
[1:11:33] but the voice of god will speak to the
[1:11:34] heart and you never will be changed
[1:11:37] amen
[1:11:39] once he speaks and it's nothing else
[1:11:43] because there's no word of god
[1:11:46] even the disciples finally done figured
[1:11:47] out how long about pretty close to the
[1:11:49] crucifixion they even that's it working
[1:11:52] we go
[1:11:53] thou hast the words of eternal life
[1:11:55] right they all had figured it out the
[1:11:57] signs and wonders was following him
[1:12:00] and they began to catch on one time they
[1:12:02] finally asked their father said do you
[1:12:04] now believe right
[1:12:09] but listen church it's just a thought
[1:12:11] that comes to me what do we hear
[1:12:15] have we heard the voice of god
[1:12:17] revealing these things or have we heard
[1:12:20] the voice of a man
[1:12:29] if something is not too clear
[1:12:33] the best thing to do is just leave it
[1:12:34] alone
[1:12:40] just leave it alone
[1:12:43] let god speak to us about it
[1:12:47] just wait on
[1:12:48] him any problem i've studied on things
[1:12:51] 20 years before i'd ever preach
[1:12:54] 20 years
[1:12:56] i'm not trying to copy brother brown i'm
[1:12:58] doing that i'm just telling you
[1:13:03] i've seen things and wouldn't preach on
[1:13:04] them at all but then after i've seen it
[1:13:06] i'm not worried about nobody
[1:13:08] or what they want to say about it
[1:13:10] or tell me that i'm wrong
[1:13:12] all i want you to do is just come show
[1:13:14] me what you're right
[1:13:18] but have we heard it that's the main the
[1:13:20] point you know we can talk about seals
[1:13:22] we can talk about
[1:13:23] combat beasts we can talk about
[1:13:26] all kind of things
[1:13:31] but that combat beast said come and see
[1:13:36] john goes into look
[1:13:40] and he sees a white horse
[1:13:42] a rider with a bow with no arrows
[1:13:47] and he can't explain
[1:13:52] he had heard the voice of god calling
[1:13:54] him to it
[1:13:56] but he couldn't explain it
[1:14:03] i like what brother woodley said to
[1:14:05] brother dick one time here
[1:14:07] the dick said i see that he said put it
[1:14:09] in your own words
[1:14:13] if you see it
[1:14:14] put it in your own words
[1:14:17] can we put this message in our own words
[1:14:20] right
[1:14:21] like i told we were talking out there
[1:14:23] sunday night it was straight i think i
[1:14:24] might have done a year but we were
[1:14:26] talking i said you take one man standing
[1:14:28] here and one man he's standing here the
[1:14:30] good old baptist
[1:14:33] and you say to him what do you believe
[1:14:34] he says one true and living god
[1:14:39] you look over to the believer in the
[1:14:41] message what do you believe one true and
[1:14:43] living god
[1:14:46] don't know what you're going to do
[1:14:47] you've got two people saying the same
[1:14:49] words
[1:14:51] now go back and ask them what they
[1:14:52] believe
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] you ask the baptist said what do you
[1:14:56] believe he said i believe in one true
[1:14:58] and living god god in three persons
[1:15:01] blessed trinity
[1:15:03] coequal and co-eternal
[1:15:06] mercy
[1:15:08] we know that ain't right
[1:15:10] so you go to the believer
[1:15:13] you ask him said would you explain what
[1:15:15] you believe
[1:15:17] he said let me tell you brother branham
[1:15:19] said
[1:15:24] i didn't ask you what brother said right
[1:15:27] i asked you to explain to me what you're
[1:15:29] thinking
[1:15:30] right
[1:15:31] what you said well brother random said
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:34] you can't get them to say nothing on
[1:15:36] their own right
[1:15:38] now they said right around said right
[1:15:41] now what's the difference in the two
[1:15:42] people
[1:15:45] right amen
[1:15:46] see i say neither one of them
[1:15:50] can speak from their heart right right
[1:15:58] you take a man speaking from his heart
[1:16:00] sometimes it's hard to understand
[1:16:07] sometimes it's easier to understand from
[1:16:08] the head
[1:16:10] because it don't require revelation
[1:16:13] the heart requires that god speaks to
[1:16:16] you
[1:16:21] then have we heard god's voice
[1:16:24] speaking to us in the end
[1:16:31] or is it just a thunder
[1:16:37] which one is
[1:16:38] come on brother
[1:16:40] which one is it
[1:16:45] can you explain
[1:16:47] what you believe
[1:16:49] that's it
[1:16:55] most people explain what brother branham
[1:16:57] believed right
[1:16:59] i've heard people explain what brother
[1:17:00] branham believed that i knew brother
[1:17:02] brown didn't believe that amen
[1:17:06] and i've heard them explain what he
[1:17:07] believed
[1:17:10] i knew he didn't believe
[1:17:14] i don't want somebody telling you what i
[1:17:16] believe
[1:17:18] i want to tell you myself
[1:17:22] because you might get confused on what i
[1:17:25] believe
[1:17:28] i don't like to speak through an
[1:17:29] interpreter
[1:17:32] so here it is this
[1:17:34] will you call it disposal i guess or
[1:17:36] here it is
[1:17:37] under his mercy because the details you
[1:17:39] say i believe you want to live in god
[1:17:41] and then go
[1:17:42] explain the trinity
[1:17:45] and say he said it
[1:17:48] i told the only one i ever had to deal
[1:17:50] with i said
[1:17:51] you will answer to god
[1:17:54] if you don't say what i say
[1:17:56] irregardless of whether you believe what
[1:17:59] i say or not
[1:18:03] you tell them what i say
[1:18:07] and then if i'm wrong we can take care
[1:18:08] of it
[1:18:09] that's right
[1:18:12] because it's very easy to do that i told
[1:18:14] you the point of worthy
[1:18:16] he was trying to interpret when i told
[1:18:18] her sister that
[1:18:20] sister says are they
[1:18:22] you know
[1:18:22] i'm glad to be there and glad that the
[1:18:25] wife is standing behind her husband you
[1:18:26] know and all and things like that and
[1:18:29] real good help me
[1:18:32] everybody in the congregation about 300
[1:18:34] and something people were just dying

[1:19:29] you tell them what i say
[1:19:32] and i found out later their word meat
[1:19:34] meant like a companion marriage
[1:19:37] etc you know bonded
