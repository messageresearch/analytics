[8:41] alright now we go to Malachi 4 we'll
[8:45] start with verse 2 Malachi 4 went into
[8:50] you that fear my name shall the Sun of
[8:52] righteousness arise with healing in his
[8:55] wings and you shall go forth and grow up
[8:57] his calves in the stall and yet and ye
[9:01] shall tread down now I wish you would
[9:03] look sometimes how many years and many
[9:05] times it's speaking about what we'll do
[9:07] there of course you know it's got and
[9:10] you shall tread down the wicked for
[9:12] there shall be ashes under the soles of
[9:14] your feet and the day that I shall do
[9:17] this says the Lord of hosts remember ye
[9:20] the law of Moses my servant which I
[9:25] commanded unto him in Horeb for all
[9:27] Israel with the statutes and judgments
[9:29] behold I send you Elijah the Prophet
[9:33] before the coming of the Great and
[9:34] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[9:36] turn the heart of the father's to the
[9:39] children and the heart of the children
[9:41] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[9:44] the earth with the curse you may be
[9:47] seated the Lord that is blessing to the
[9:50] reading of the word now we're going to
[9:55] try to cover as much as we can this
[9:59] morning but we will be dealing with the
[10:02] same thing all day today you know
[10:05] because we're at the position and then
[10:08] the Lord willing maybe after this
[10:11] evening we will start into the covering
[10:16] about the virtues and you know what they
[10:18] are and what takes place and things so
[10:22] you just start reading in that room of
[10:26] understanding of this other statue of a
[10:29] perfect man
[10:29] and you know kind of pay close attention
[10:32] we're like brother branham's on virtue
[10:35] he said now that's not gonna live in a
[10:36] virgin life well he's really what he's
[10:40] saying
[10:41] don't get so much natural because you
[10:45] take the word virgin see and you put it
[10:48] on in your wind up with the wrong way
[10:50] see of following what the real meaning
[10:54] of those scriptures are he wasn't
[10:56] against and nobody would begin the fact
[10:59] of you supposed to be a virgin you know
[11:01] that's that's the thing that's supposed
[11:04] to be but that's not what it's talking
[11:06] about there just be one I'll say it this
[11:08] way for we get to it I've seen a lot of
[11:11] women that were our girls maybe that
[11:14] were virgins but we're meanest
[11:16] rattlesnake right so you kind of see the
[11:20] wavy Cohen you know maybe the meaning is
[11:23] a rattlesnake but they may be virgin but
[11:26] that's not exactly then what it's
[11:27] talking about in the statue of a perfect
[11:30] man there see so you see right around
[11:32] him when he said something you just
[11:34] think about what he's saying and then
[11:37] little hole come in to view all right -
[11:40] I want us to think this morning
[11:44] especially trying to just to get a
[11:47] thought and then receiving we're going
[11:49] to read I gave them 33 quotes for used
[11:53] all right good to see it'll be back
[11:57] there with it and and we're going to try
[12:00] to read a lot this afternoon
[12:03] because that way then you have to say
[12:05] well the Prophet said it you know all
[12:09] right see then that way we'd have the
[12:11] understanding but what I want us to
[12:13] thank this morning I want to thought in
[12:15] your mind like this you know we say well
[12:19] those people are not in the message you
[12:21] know we say that's her show with our
[12:25] they're not in the message well you know
[12:28] that may be true yeah you know that may
[12:32] be true but yet why do we spend so much
[12:36] time on that when maybe I could go or I
[12:40] was explaining to my wife a little bit
[12:42] yesterday about it
[12:43] I could go over there today and I could
[12:45] preach a message that's kind of us
[12:47] swinging off of a Baptist Church and I
[12:50] could preach a message of one God to
[12:55] those people just not say brother
[12:58] Branham say it does not get into certain
[13:00] thing and especially not mention the
[13:02] water baptism you know and not be
[13:06] outlandish about my statements of of you
[13:09] know they're off the word so you just
[13:12] kind of bring it a message and you know
[13:14] what those people would accept it they
[13:17] would say men won't say that's right you
[13:18] know man I enjoyed that I was that's a
[13:21] good thought because their concept is
[13:23] one god of the Baptist Church all right
[13:26] but see then when you start saying some
[13:30] things onto it then they catch on to
[13:33] what you're doing well but now this is
[13:35] what I found among the believers of the
[13:37] message you just name your title and
[13:41] they're automatically against you I mean
[13:47] you just name your title now we're going
[13:51] to talk today on spiritual gifts that's
[13:55] what we're gonna talk on spiritual gifts
[13:57] alright see then anything I say listen
[14:01] you don't understand it you don't
[14:02] understand it we know this we know that
[14:04] about this but you instead of listening
[14:06] to what said the people have a
[14:09] preconceived idea about what you're
[14:13] saying and they turn it down before you
[14:15] ever even get to the message that you're
[14:17] trying to bring these over brother Dale
[14:20] we don't do that okay
[14:22] just making a point it might be good for
[14:26] us to pay close attention to the way
[14:32] things are said and what is said instead
[14:36] of trying to figure out what is saying
[14:39] we're gonna be owned today
[14:42] all right on announcement kind of
[14:44] thought then you pre conceived your idea
[14:47] and see how it fits we're going to be
[14:49] talking about that the fivefold ministry
[14:52] is for the perfecting of the science
[14:57] now we're gonna be on that realm and be
[15:00] talking on those things okay Jay all
[15:04] right now some see you'll back up before
[15:08] you ever listen to what is being said
[15:12] and then anything that said you'll
[15:15] automatically run it the wrong way
[15:17] all right but now think on those things
[15:21] kind of as we go along now remember this
[15:25] past Sunday that we were talking about
[15:28] we had got to the position of speaking
[15:31] about that these virtues that we read of
[15:37] in 2nd Peter
[15:38] add to your faith virtue or knowledge to
[15:41] enforce passive not that those things
[15:43] are required now it's down through the
[15:48] ages the Prophet said this groups not
[15:52] required what this is this group has not
[15:55] required what this is all right and
[15:57] that's true see because it was the
[15:59] amount of word that was there the Holy
[16:02] Spirit wasn't taken away it was the word
[16:04] that was ADA way the Holy Spirit was
[16:06] dark working in the church all right and
[16:09] see then in that they had their word for
[16:14] the age but we're not in the ages now
[16:17] we're supposed to be in the end time
[16:19] there's not supposed to be any ages now
[16:22] we're living in Lady ousia
[16:24] all right we're here but we're not
[16:27] supposed to be a part of Lady ousia each
[16:30] church age the bride of that age was
[16:34] birthed out of the age into the message
[16:39] of the hour that they were living nor
[16:41] did you follow it they were birthed out
[16:43] of that that new birth see Luther when
[16:46] he brought that message forth then it
[16:49] was required that those in that age to
[16:53] be a part of the bride was to be birthed
[16:58] by the same word or the word that Martin
[17:02] Luther brought because he brought the
[17:05] just shall live by faith
[17:06] all right see that was his basic
[17:09] now he preached all kind of messages and
[17:11] wrote commentaries and all kind of thing
[17:13] but yet his whole basic message was
[17:16] that's just shall live by faith
[17:18] well what would be the new birth of that
[17:20] age that's your shall live by faith
[17:23] all right we see then it it required
[17:26] more for the next because you come to
[17:28] Wesley were sanctification well all
[17:31] right what they had in Luther's age was
[17:34] the foundation or the part
[17:37] Wesley never come along Wesley come
[17:39] along teaching the same message Luther
[17:43] was teaching oh the just shall live by
[17:46] faith then he comes to America
[17:49] kind of got missionary minded in his
[17:51] ways and he comes to America and he runs
[17:55] into a group called the Moravians ever
[17:57] how you pronounce it and and they
[17:59] actually taught him a lot about
[18:00] sanctification we see they were not the
[18:04] messenger of the age the John Wesley was
[18:09] the messenger of the age so when John
[18:11] Wesley brought the message he never left
[18:13] justification he didn't say we don't
[18:18] need that no more he said I sister way
[18:22] I've come in other words he said I've
[18:24] come through Luther's message I've been
[18:27] a Christian all of these years of this
[18:29] that or the other through the doctrine
[18:31] of the just shall live by faith
[18:32] now we move into another age all right
[18:37] the same thing with the Zeus's treat
[18:40] okay oh I see then you wind up in this
[18:43] age
[18:43] there's not another age to come not
[18:46] another message to follow to to the
[18:50] Gentiles this is the end of it so then
[18:52] the end of all things has come upon us
[18:54] and it's required then that we as the
[18:58] Church of this age is required that we
[19:01] come to perfection through the word to
[19:06] the place that all that's behind us has
[19:09] been dependent upon it and see then that
[19:13] away brother Branham went all the way
[19:15] back course he went on back to Pentecost
[19:17] you know restoring the faith but when
[19:19] the point see he believed what Luther
[19:21] talked
[19:22] the truth he believed what Wesley
[19:24] thought he believed what is this a
[19:25] street talk of the truth amen see then
[19:29] he brought the message of this age which
[19:32] to tie up all the loose ends right he
[19:36] was to top all the loose ends and then
[19:39] in that would be the faith of the
[19:42] father's to be restored I think that
[19:45] would be the melikhaya that we read to
[19:48] turn the hearts of the John turned them
[19:51] to the New Testament message all right
[19:54] what he done he turned him to Jesus
[19:56] right cuz he really he didn't turn him
[19:59] he's just pointed right see we used the
[20:04] terminology as he turned it this away
[20:06] and then it's got to be turned back it's
[20:08] technically not turning he just John
[20:10] really just laid right and said there is
[20:13] the Lord Jesus Christ he introduced him
[20:16] all right see then that came in to the
[20:19] early church of that faith of the Lord
[20:23] Jesus Christ and the message he taught
[20:25] him all right see then Satan eat that
[20:28] away and it went down what's he in the
[20:30] end time it's coming back to where this
[20:34] message has pointed out Jesus Christ
[20:36] again just as John the Baptist pointed
[20:40] him then there is the faith of the
[20:43] fathers there's the message he pointed
[20:46] him to the truth or us to the you know
[20:49] mankind back dire to the truth because
[20:52] he pointed to Jesus Christ well what is
[20:53] the profit to burning us back to the
[20:55] word the original word that was given
[20:59] all right see then that's what the world
[21:02] waiting on Hebrews 11:40 right they
[21:05] without us cannot be made perfect okay
[21:09] see because we've come to the end time
[21:12] to understand the truth of the word of
[21:16] God and the world is waiting on you and
[21:19] I I didn't write the book you're
[21:23] supposed to be believing the prophets
[21:25] message if you want to get anything gets
[21:27] the message on adoption and read those
[21:29] and you'll see where that I'm talking
[21:31] about what I'm talking about
[21:33] other returning you know and bringing it
[21:36] all right we see then once we get turned
[21:39] to back to the faith of the fathers
[21:41] that's still not the fullness of their
[21:43] story it's got to go on and not stop
[21:48] there he's got to go home to a change of
[21:50] the body to bring back to the faith of
[21:52] the fathers I've always said it you
[21:54] might not understand the terminologies
[21:56] but if everybody in the world had the
[21:59] faith of the Father seven billion people
[22:02] with the faith of the father be a
[22:04] wonderful world to live in wouldn't but
[22:06] that would not be the finish because we
[22:11] would still be in human bodies see
[22:16] brother branham not only brought us to
[22:19] turn us back to the faith of the fathers
[22:20] but he went on in the message seek to
[22:24] bring the real his message began in the
[22:27] opening of the word of the seals in the
[22:29] time the others was restoration up until
[22:33] 63 there in the message he was doing
[22:36] restoration then his message come into
[22:40] view which was the seals than the things
[22:42] you know all right and it takes you all
[22:46] the way to the chains of the body
[22:48] because that way we're not looking for
[22:50] somebody else to come along all right
[22:54] now I'm just putting a point in then I
[22:57] want you to understand where I stand
[22:59] we're not looking for somebody to come
[23:01] along and have another message
[23:03] another great following another great
[23:06] move of that that's not to be now God is
[23:09] to come in and bring a rapture in all
[23:11] the things and I believe it a great
[23:13] outpouring of the Holy Ghost on the
[23:15] bride I believe that but as far as the
[23:18] world it's not going to be those things
[23:20] saying there's not another messenger to
[23:22] come to bring us some thing or secret
[23:26] thing to change these bodies Paul talked
[23:30] to the change of the body Paul described
[23:34] the change of the body but he's just
[23:37] couldn't attain unto it because it
[23:39] wasn't time but yet he told he said
[23:42] you're changing him on 120 you and I
[23:44] know that's a lie struck for the trumpet
[23:46] she'll say oh he put all of that into
[23:49] word for you and I to understand but see
[23:53] then we come that this end that's what I
[23:56] was getting on Sunday so I'm trying to
[23:58] get the point now that the point Sunday
[24:00] was what these virtues are required all
[24:07] right it's not something you just talk
[24:09] about the virtues are required all right
[24:15] they will be known already to get in a
[24:18] minute
[24:18] there'll be no rapture unless this
[24:22] message is brought forth by someone into
[24:26] reality all right
[24:29] the okay then see the bride being the
[24:33] final voice is that the words of your
[24:37] prophet the bride is to be the final
[24:40] voice to the final age all right so then
[24:44] I'm not looking for something else but
[24:47] neither am I looking for somebody to
[24:49] come along that can give us the great
[24:52] interpretation of the message I believe
[24:54] God I thought the message was bro and
[24:57] that God vindicated that that was the
[25:01] truth that's the way I stand you know he
[25:04] vindicated it to be the truth all right
[25:07] see then in doing that then these
[25:11] virtues we read in there that it's a
[25:15] requirement you realize the requirement
[25:20] of this age is to bring these things
[25:22] into manifestation not to just go to
[25:26] church and be good and live good and do
[25:29] this out of the other thing that's what
[25:32] people think they think it's just well
[25:36] you know we come into this message and
[25:38] it's just a little move upward of some
[25:40] kind of something no it's the end time
[25:43] everything is dependent upon whether or
[25:46] not this bride can reach that position
[25:49] all right
[25:51] see then you say well now this we've got
[25:54] a well everything you would talk about
[25:56] is going to be the bride is going to be
[26:00] involved no matter what
[26:03] praying or try to bring to this point it
[26:05] happened we're looking for this to
[26:07] happen it's still going to be the
[26:09] involvement of the bride because it's
[26:13] not one man to bring the whole time well
[26:17] now see I say words and you take me
[26:21] wrong and misinterpret but there's no
[26:23] scripture that said brother Branham is
[26:25] for the perfecting of the science now if
[26:30] it is I'd like to see the scripture it
[26:33] says the fivefold ministry is all right
[26:37] now it's time to not throw away our
[26:39] thoughts and ideas I've never said
[26:41] nothing I've never tried to interpret
[26:43] nothing to anybody about the end time of
[26:46] what it to be because that's left up to
[26:48] God but I can't at least say the parts
[26:52] that I know you know what I do know I do
[26:56] know the Bible says the fivefold
[26:59] ministry is for the perfecting of the
[27:01] science all right
[27:04] but now for sure of one thing the
[27:07] fivefold ministry does not have a
[27:10] message of her own now get that plane in
[27:16] your thoughts and we'll go through it
[27:18] today the fivefold ministry doesn't have
[27:21] a message of her own she has this
[27:23] message we're not trying to find some
[27:27] other secret coded something within the
[27:29] Word of God to make us get changed
[27:32] no this message has everything in it
[27:36] that you and I need because if not you
[27:39] got to look for something else
[27:41] but see the message has within it the
[27:44] things that we need and these that the
[27:48] message it will cover it we have over
[27:50] and over the the thing of being were
[27:55] that we can see the truth now
[27:58] I like statements brother Branham will
[28:00] make you know I like these kind of
[28:04] statements I like positive statements
[28:06] you know I hate that wishy-washy well
[28:09] what's your input under this what's your
[28:12] idea how do I do that's why I got
[28:16] 30-something quote
[28:19] you know I try to say what's the
[28:20] prophecy so you get into philosophies
[28:25] and people's ideas well what do you
[28:27] think it'll be either this is the life's
[28:33] message or you and I are in bad shuddhi
[28:37] one way or the other no we're standing
[28:40] in bad shape and we're 50 years down the
[28:43] road from the time with the profit
[28:44] leaving the same right these in I think
[28:50] it's about time to settle down to think
[28:52] about things and consider the day in the
[28:58] hour that we're living all right and
[29:01] follow these things all right there
[29:06] cannot be there cannot be a change of
[29:12] the body until someone reaches the faith
[29:18] for that it's all dependent and the
[29:24] bride being the life's voice to the life
[29:26] stage we're not looking for something
[29:28] else well you just don't understand this
[29:31] all right I probably don't but I
[29:34] understand one thing I can stand on
[29:36] water I believe okay I can stand in that
[29:40] position so then make sure you you
[29:43] follow all right
[29:44] see now watch what I'm getting at if
[29:48] it's true if it Hebrews 11:40 this is
[29:53] day without us cannot be made perfect
[29:57] huh now if that's true
[29:59] see then look at what's left for the end
[30:02] time people to do and to be don't you
[30:07] just go to church and be good people
[30:09] that's fine I mean that's good but
[30:14] that's not the whole story
[30:15] there's more than just going to church
[30:17] and being good well what do you think
[30:19] order do brother or not the world lives
[30:21] there's plenty of plenty of religious
[30:24] people in this world that their lives
[30:27] are marvelous
[30:29] their works are doing a lot of things
[30:31] and and you know they're doing wonderful
[30:34] things look at all of the money that's
[30:37] being sent overseas to run these places
[30:41] and do all this by the people that claim
[30:46] to be Christians so then that way you
[30:49] don't there's no way to to leave them
[30:52] out they have their place huh
[30:56] and see it's not to to try to say well
[31:00] we they're not they're not bringing the
[31:03] message they're not in the message right
[31:05] over there
[31:05] we're in the message well if someone
[31:12] preaches the truth once what's the point
[31:15] you know all right see then you today
[31:19] will well you know they're doing this
[31:21] and they're doing that well show me what
[31:22] they're doing it's not right
[31:24] you know what I mean that there there's
[31:26] good places there's good people in this
[31:28] world but a random never was against
[31:31] something like that he would call them
[31:33] Christians no they're not Christians
[31:36] because they don't believe this message
[31:40] well maybe they've never heard this
[31:44] message right maybe they've never heard
[31:50] the truth now what are you gonna do with
[31:54] them they're going to answer to God to
[31:57] what they have and they're doing in
[31:59] their own thoughts and idea they got to
[32:01] be put to do that
[32:02] but get the point now if we talk about
[32:06] these virtues are required you remember
[32:11] and I said this statement if they're in
[32:13] the word it's required it's not just in
[32:18] our haphazardly to just fulfilled it
[32:21] Peter was saying I'm a born-again
[32:24] Christian and I have like precious faith
[32:29] with those that are born again we said
[32:32] now we need to add this faith virtue or
[32:35] not you know we need all right now that
[32:39] would be the faith or revelation of the
[32:42] father's
[32:43] and that was what was eat away during
[32:44] the Dark Ages in the time Satan comes in
[32:49] we'll get to her bread around talking
[32:50] about he said you know you don't listen
[32:53] to what he's saying he said the people
[32:58] he said they don't they they don't teach
[33:01] that we need these things that they
[33:06] don't teach that we need these things
[33:09] right what's he saying but yet they're
[33:14] teaching it you know they're reading it
[33:17] they're proclaiming it they're putting
[33:20] it in into action as I said a lot of the
[33:23] churches are that make you and i ashamed
[33:26] of ourselves of the reality of the life
[33:28] that we live and walk in what's the
[33:33] difference well we have the word well
[33:39] when you come over into the message and
[33:40] it's perverting what's the difference
[33:42] and perverted word worse dire here hmm
[33:46] you know what I'm talking about how look
[33:48] at the end time and the ministry around
[33:50] the world until people will go 50 years
[33:53] preaching this message and then all the
[33:54] minute automatically just quit and just
[33:58] turn to some other thing maybe as I said
[34:02] their Sunday maybe some that brought you
[34:06] or was instrumental in bringing some of
[34:09] you to the message you think about where
[34:12] they are today that they've went back
[34:16] further than organized religion you know
[34:21] what most of them is doing they're going
[34:22] back to pull their own the light is in
[34:24] their own little groups and trying to
[34:26] build something of that order see then
[34:31] church listen maybe it's about time that
[34:34] we wake up to kind of think about these
[34:38] things if something is required if
[34:45] something is required then I thought you
[34:51] know if it's a requirement in the Bible
[34:53] for me to be a Christian walk right down
[34:57] supposed to get baptized name of the
[34:58] Lord Jesus Christ now we say that's a
[35:00] requirement right well you know we go
[35:03] and do that right she's required or huh
[35:09] it's required that we follow in the
[35:14] lineup of the word and we we walk into
[35:18] to that alright but see then do we just
[35:24] say well okay oh I have it anyway no no
[35:29] it's not automatically now come on see
[35:31] I'm quoting brother Branham he said
[35:33] don't worry about it he said you get
[35:34] born again he said then these things
[35:37] will be automatically added right but he
[35:40] didn't say they're automatically added
[35:42] because you're you you get borned again
[35:46] you get the new birth then you depend
[35:51] upon God to bring these things into
[35:53] reality but if we don't know we have to
[35:56] have them
[36:02] if these virtues are required for us to
[36:06] be a virtuous Christian then you know
[36:12] you could go right over here and say did
[36:15] you know that we need these virtues that
[36:17] say what are you talking about because
[36:20] they don't know what that is in other
[36:27] words I'm trying to get you to look at
[36:28] something about what I was getting that
[36:30] Sunday these virtues are required you
[36:34] realize those virtues were people that
[36:38] had walked into the word until they made
[36:42] manifest those things right they made a
[36:49] manifest that was people that was
[36:52] Christians they were not happy to just
[36:55] go to church and be good they had a
[36:58] deeper desire a greater desire within
[37:01] their heart to be able to follow after
[37:03] God and that was the faith of the
[37:06] fathers
[37:10] huh see we'll get to those things when
[37:13] we come into it but look the point is
[37:15] now Malachi 4 says all right you turn
[37:23] the hearts of the father's to the
[37:24] children the children to the father's
[37:27] all right John turned them to the New
[37:29] Testament of Jesus Christ of the words
[37:31] pointed to him there he was from him
[37:36] came the faith of the fathers in the
[37:38] Apostles all right that was either way
[37:41] as far as now listen it wouldn't take an
[37:45] out see that's what we think either way
[37:50] you can still read Peter them but people
[37:54] didn't have in their understanding that
[37:56] those were requirements they just had in
[37:59] their understanding that we've got these
[38:00] things we've got this no no Peter said
[38:05] be in you and abound see the faith of
[38:12] the Father that's that seems to be the
[38:14] thing because you don't hear that priest
[38:16] anymore see we're so up high we're
[38:20] fender they're swept into that we're
[38:22] when the only thing well how did you get
[38:25] up there that's all I've ever asked how
[38:29] did you get up if it's required that we
[38:32] have these virtues if it's required that
[38:35] we have and you can't have say like
[38:37] you're born again here you can't have
[38:39] brotherly kindness in its full
[38:41] manifestation until you climb up that
[38:43] will we'll get to those time it's not to
[38:46] just look at it and say well okay that
[38:48] one hour we'll just work on that one no
[38:51] that won't work if these things are
[38:55] required then someone has to come forth
[38:57] into that and to walk into that word
[39:01] into the original faith that those
[39:05] disciples had brother Ron said they had
[39:08] these virtues he said they had the least
[39:11] little nod from God and they knew what
[39:15] God wanted them to do that's what we
[39:17] read so you can do is in paragraph 4 18
[39:20] 419 a statue of a perfect
[39:23] he said these are the things that God is
[39:26] expecting us to add these virtues and he
[39:33] said remember the one that we read on
[39:34] that go ahead and pull up number two and
[39:36] let's get to that one we'll just read a
[39:38] little bit this morning then we will go
[39:40] on but each age God has placed these
[39:53] things into the church and pattered it
[39:56] by showing that each individual has
[40:00] these possesses these qualities now not
[40:04] showing that everybody has them showing
[40:06] that everybody's require them are you
[40:09] reading with it's not saying they had it
[40:12] ever individuals born again don't have
[40:14] it it's a growth development all right
[40:17] so look now and he says the individuals
[40:21] has these possesses these qualities and
[40:25] this being when it's completed is the
[40:30] church now he's going to the whole
[40:31] pyramid the whole church
[40:35] that'll do what that'll when it's
[40:42] completed the Church of God going in the
[40:45] rapture and this being completed is a
[40:52] servant of God in the Church of God
[40:54] that's going in the rapture you realize
[40:58] then the rapture is is dependent upon
[41:01] someone obtaining to these qualities now
[41:11] that's what I'm saying that's what I'm
[41:12] trying to get over to you to say all
[41:16] right it's required it's required for
[41:22] somebody to reach that place all right
[41:26] because that's what's going to bring
[41:28] about the rapture he's not saying that
[41:34] every body down there there's plenty of
[41:36] people that
[41:37] will not have these virtues that will go
[41:39] in the rapture that's why they're
[41:41] dependent upon you and I they're
[41:47] dependent upon you and I they're
[41:48] dependent upon somebody somebody that
[41:53] will come forward with these things into
[41:56] manifestation well I think I would need
[42:00] to do just brother Dale he tries to make
[42:02] it so hard I just don't understand the
[42:05] lighting well I'm glad brother branham's
[42:07] one that said it
[42:08] he said when sister Shepherd had that
[42:10] dream and the different things and he
[42:12] told it he said she's worried whether
[42:14] she had the Holy Ghost or not at least
[42:16] she got concerned because brother
[42:18] Branham had preached it so hard that we
[42:22] just don't go to church and claim to be
[42:24] good but we're just to all the world
[42:26] Christians wherever though she at least
[42:28] had it as our heart I think that should
[42:32] be every one of us do I really have it
[42:35] lowered are these things in
[42:38] manifestation in my life or if I'm just
[42:42] a church owner see we know that those
[42:47] down through there that never attained
[42:49] to these things they're going to go in
[42:51] the rapture we yet seemingly here it
[42:55] looks like that's the only group that's
[42:56] going is the ones who possesses these
[42:59] things well there's people down through
[43:02] there that's died that don't possess
[43:03] these time already talking about what a
[43:06] change a rapture change those down to
[43:11] the lutheran 'm not required what will
[43:13] require but they're going in the rapture
[43:16] right he's not saying they're not going
[43:20] to go because they don't have these it's
[43:25] they're dependent upon you and i to
[43:28] bring it to a place to where the change
[43:30] can take place and the change the moment
[43:34] with weaker than i is to me what he's
[43:36] talking about they're not changing what
[43:40] he's saying but just make the point that
[43:42] the person with these things is the ones
[43:45] that's going to go in the change
[43:49] because we're all going in the rapture
[43:50] all born-again believers all born-again
[43:55] believers is gonna go in the rapture
[43:56] when the Lord comes right because that
[43:58] is the new birth
[44:00] now all born-again believers not just
[44:02] somebody believe in untruth not somebody
[44:05] confessing all who have the baptism of
[44:08] the Holy Ghost the new birth sealed in
[44:11] with God in that so that is the rapture
[44:14] and you're going in the rapture all
[44:18] right but there's a lot of people that
[44:20] don't have these virtues that's going to
[44:25] be there well it would sound like he's
[44:27] saying only those that have these
[44:29] virtues is gonna go into rapture no he's
[44:32] not saying that he said well how do you
[44:36] know what he said I know what he's
[44:38] saying go to know what he's already
[44:39] saying I know he's already taught us
[44:42] that the Holy Ghost inside the
[44:44] individuals what's gonna take us so then
[44:48] those people they're waiting on us to
[44:55] bring forth in the reality or somebody -
[44:59] why don't we claim we're the ones they
[45:03] he's waiting on somebody the whole Bible
[45:06] everything is dependent really if you
[45:08] read Hebrews 11 you realized the whole
[45:11] Old Testament all those great warriors
[45:14] of faith all those great Abraham's and
[45:17] David and the things that happen and
[45:20] then he summed it up by saying they
[45:22] without us cannot be made perfect see
[45:29] the Old Testament without the New
[45:30] Testament to bring it forth it's no good
[45:36] but the New Testament brings it forth
[45:38] into the right order all right but then
[45:41] listen then what about a lot of the
[45:49] years now I'm just hitting a little spot
[45:52] this morning and then we'll cover the
[45:54] other decision in us in let's look at
[45:56] number three and thank a little
[45:58] something about your prophet and what he
[46:00] was doing
[46:02] related with number three which is
[46:04] prayer about 275 then look what he says
[46:10] like I've tried to get this message over
[46:12] at the Tabernacle what message the
[46:18] statue of a perfect man because that's
[46:20] the faith of the fathers I've tried to
[46:23] get this over to the tabernacle
[46:27] we got him with each member of the
[46:29] tabernacle become this it's hard to do
[46:32] I've tried to have patience this is 33
[46:34] years they have patience women still Bob
[46:37] door higher still the same but that's
[46:39] just how patients see just how patience
[46:42] wait see if you ain't got it
[46:46] don't try to build on this down here
[46:48] have patience see just wait wait all
[46:51] right what's he saying that each into
[46:54] each member of the tabernacle to become
[46:57] these things what these virtues because
[47:02] you see do you understand that the
[47:04] virtues and all of those things is the
[47:07] faith of the fathers they had the
[47:10] revelation of these things they taught
[47:13] the statue of a perfect man that's what
[47:15] I spent time over and over with it Peter
[47:18] telling you you add faith virtue or
[47:20] knowledge temperance patience Paul says
[47:24] adoption born into the family tutored
[47:29] then comes to the adoption and Paul
[47:32] carries it further than Peter Peter
[47:35] doesn't declare but he does say if they
[47:39] are in you and abound Paul says that
[47:45] when you come to that part he said in
[47:47] Romans 8 even to wit to understand the
[47:51] change of the body but they're both
[47:54] speaking the same thing that is the
[47:57] faith of the Father the faith of the
[48:00] father's is the revelation of the
[48:01] father's the revelation that they had so
[48:05] all right they stood at a position had
[48:10] these virtues knew the little nod from
[48:12] God listen
[48:15] Satan gradually dis take that away until
[48:18] you come down - what just go to church
[48:20] would be good well brother Dale I just
[48:23] don't understand him I don't I don't he
[48:26] just so deep I don't understand what's
[48:29] deep about what I just say it the
[48:33] disciples had these virtues and little
[48:38] each little nod from God all right so
[48:42] what would be the difference in them
[48:44] having and us having it we've got to
[48:47] have what they had right they had what
[48:53] we call the faith of the Father
[48:54] they had these virtues into
[48:57] manifestation they had the adoption and
[48:59] into the places were to do waiting for
[49:02] the change and see you and I've got to
[49:06] have that somebody has well I just don't
[49:12] see this it's necessary and we just go
[49:14] to church and be good that's exactly
[49:17] what the devil done and he slept the
[49:19] church to sleep or put her to sleep just
[49:22] by saying read your statue of a perfect
[49:24] man and brother instead see there they
[49:26] don't even teach this is required come
[49:32] on I send the virtue they don't even
[49:35] teach these things are required he said
[49:37] it's just go to church and be good well
[49:41] see I've never been happy with just
[49:43] going to church and being good the first
[49:47] thing I did never was too good to start
[49:49] with so I ain't worried about that then
[49:53] you started trying to be good you start
[49:55] trying to do this out of the other and
[49:57] that's well and good but you could be a
[50:00] buzzard with peacock feathers
[50:02] I didn't say that your prophet did right
[50:09] I want what they had is where I fought
[50:17] for that ever since I've been in the
[50:19] message a fault for the faith that they
[50:22] had to know that their faith was what we
[50:26] would have to rich have to recombination
[50:29] the word that our revelation of God and
[50:32] all would be right and you think about
[50:33] it think about what God has given you
[50:38] correct understanding of one God
[50:41] correct understanding a water baptism
[50:44] correct understanding of predestination
[50:47] correct understanding of no eternal hell
[50:50] correct understanding of all the Word of
[50:52] God thinking about what God has given
[50:55] you you don't go good things like that
[50:58] he has given us a marvelous
[51:02] understanding of his word over this past
[51:06] time that we've had he's given us then
[51:08] 50 years right 50 years after the going
[51:17] of the Prophet to study these things the
[51:22] word could be brought into manifestation
[51:23] how marvelous he is look what he's done
[51:31] for you and me look what he's made for
[51:37] you and I and he's given us the correct
[51:40] way and understand him he didn't just
[51:43] leave us to be in a religious Society
[51:52] you remember what he said he said Jesus
[51:55] appeared to the Jews did he appeared to
[52:00] the Samaritans - i'm cinda but he said
[52:04] he never brought to the Gentiles back
[52:08] tyre he went to the house of Cornelius
[52:11] all that was well and good there within
[52:14] all of those things but yet he still
[52:16] never went to the Gentiles did he
[52:19] reserve that to be in this day - where
[52:22] the son of man came into human flesh not
[52:28] brother branham being god or the son of
[52:30] man now no it was the Word of God in a
[52:33] man to show us the same thing that he
[52:38] showed the Jews and he showed us of
[52:43] right so he showed us that he's not left
[52:48] us blindly that we don't understand he's
[52:51] given us the word he's laid within our
[52:56] hands the very thing and see then if
[53:03] it's true I ask you the question
[53:08] if it's true that we must have the faith
[53:12] of the Father and you got to admit
[53:16] that's true or at least you were to have
[53:19] enough common sense to admit that's true
[53:21] I've put it down away you were to be
[53:23] sensible enough to realize something
[53:26] went wrong somewhere some problem exists
[53:32] you say well we don't see it like the
[53:34] Apostles seen it why not well they ain't
[53:40] no silent one the Apostles they nope
[53:42] here either I've said then I get into
[53:45] trouble doing those things that's all
[53:46] right you take the disciples and bring
[53:50] them down here
[53:50] they fight they faced the Sadducees and
[53:55] the Pharisees and a little road Ian's a
[54:00] few little group of trying to mingle
[54:02] around right there in the first part of
[54:04] the book of Acts but we face thousands
[54:12] of denominational ideas plus thousands
[54:17] of believers ideas and see carts all in
[54:24] that whole thing trying you and I to see
[54:27] if we will stay with a word said he's
[54:31] gonna prove this bride was gonna prove
[54:33] to Satan that she wouldn't be like Eve
[54:35] was she'd stay with the word you see
[54:41] that's where people are not happy for
[54:42] the word being revealed they want to see
[54:44] other things I get what I'm talking
[54:48] about
[54:49] swap places with us in the disciples
[54:53] they only faced a couple of little
[54:55] groups
[54:56] bring them down here that like I was
[54:59] saying nine minute ago you start
[55:02] preaching on something and the
[55:04] congregation's already figured out what
[55:06] you're going to say and your line up
[55:08] before you ever get the message finished
[55:11] it'd be wonderful
[55:14] I'd be more welcomed in a lot of the
[55:16] places in the organized religion if I
[55:19] just change certain little things you
[55:20] know not preaching the insular do it and
[55:22] let them know what you do it I'd be more
[55:24] welcome than I am among the believers of
[55:27] the message why because they
[55:29] automatically when is he gonna bring
[55:32] what is he gonna bring well forty some
[55:36] years that I've been with you tell me
[55:40] where I changed but you don't like that
[55:44] you think that's exalted show me where
[55:47] I've changed you name some of these and
[55:50] I'll show you where they changed right
[55:55] you name some other and I'll tell you
[55:58] where the time but what about it what
[56:02] about it Church we have been told what
[56:11] to do and how to do it we need to faith
[56:16] of the fathers okay now they had it and
[56:21] they walked in it now brother branham
[56:25] now we're asking him for the answer
[56:29] because he's the Prophet right brother
[56:34] branham how are we going to get the
[56:38] faith of the father's I don't mind doing
[56:45] that I don't mind when he comes like all
[56:49] Christ as a mystery of God revealed and
[56:52] says brother Branham what is the new
[56:54] birth well I love to quote that don't
[57:00] somebody ask him what is the new birth
[57:02] or a thought was in somebody's mind out
[57:04] in the congregation or something you
[57:07] know what yes
[57:09] it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[57:11] personally to you all right
[57:15] well brother then what is the new birth
[57:17] oh come on it's paid soon so Christ the
[57:20] mystery of God revealed the Prophet told
[57:22] us what it was well I just don't believe
[57:27] that I've never read that book
[57:29] I've had them to do that I don't know
[57:31] where it said I thought I've never read
[57:33] that book well boy that's a good thing
[57:35] innit
[57:36] I mean you gonna shut the whole world
[57:37] down cuz you ain't read a book right and
[57:42] you're gonna straighten that boy some
[57:43] people boy things he's straightened him
[57:45] out
[57:46] no he told him he'd never read that book
[57:47] now boy ain't that something that's
[57:49] about as dumb as you can get sorry but
[57:53] it's true
[57:53] huh see Church you I've asked the
[57:59] questions in other words my questions to
[58:01] you too I'm questioning maybe you don't
[58:05] understand my point getting that what
[58:07] seeing when the seals begin to open just
[58:10] ask God what's he talking about you know
[58:16] he don't mind you doing that you know
[58:20] he's never got mad at me and slapped me
[58:21] down because I asked him what this was
[58:26] or that one you might have answered yeah
[58:31] like I said about that wrote around him
[58:34] what is the new birth revelation Jesus
[58:37] Christ person to you what is the real
[58:43] true meaning of one God the prophet
[58:48] hamster what's the difference brother
[58:51] branham between the one god teaching of
[58:54] the oneness and the one god teaching of
[58:57] the you know in town doing whatever and
[59:05] he tell you it's the revelation of the
[59:08] same God that welcomed the shores of
[59:10] Galilee is the same God in your heart
[59:15] answer a question
[59:19] brother branham what is the truth what
[59:25] is the truth of marriage and divorce
[59:30] we'll go to girls almanac and read up on
[59:32] anything you're supposed to be asking
[59:35] the Prophet did one can't you believe
[59:38] what he said see it doesn't bother God
[59:47] for us to question him he enjoys us
[59:50] questioning don't you enjoy your
[59:54] children coming up in life and learning
[59:57] and do that and come to you and say
[59:59] daddy or mama this right here you know
[1:00:02] so you showed me one time how to ride a
[1:00:05] bicycle and why I can ride a by saying I
[1:00:07] like dog well are you gonna get mad at
[1:00:12] the child no you're gonna be joyous
[1:00:18] about it because you told him that no
[1:00:23] see all that's all I'm trying to get us
[1:00:25] to do if we ask them if we ask God for
[1:00:29] an answer
[1:00:30] he'll give us an answer but ask him with
[1:00:38] an open heart
[1:00:40] and not to try to build up our sales
[1:00:45] arena but just ask him see so ask God
[1:00:51] well how did I get these virtues if I'm
[1:00:56] required to have them how do I get them
[1:01:00] why don't you ask him like that Lord I'm
[1:01:05] required for having them so how to get
[1:01:07] them see then he puts in he sends a
[1:01:15] prophet to give us the answer and what
[1:01:19] was the answer the Prophet gave God how
[1:01:25] do we get these faith of the father's
[1:01:27] how do we become into the statue of a
[1:01:29] perfect man
[1:01:31] be a living moving instrument of
[1:01:33] Christianity a virtuous life and that
[1:01:36] how do we do it and he answers it but do
[1:01:44] we want that answer how do we get this
[1:01:50] faith of the fathers how do we get this
[1:01:56] statue of a perfect man how do we get
[1:01:58] this adoption because to me it's all
[1:01:59] preaching the same thing to us it's
[1:02:02] different ways that the disciples were
[1:02:04] describing how to come or to attain to
[1:02:07] where they were remember you can't teach
[1:02:11] nothing but but what's your what you
[1:02:13] have that's why they certain things I
[1:02:18] won't speak on you know why cuz don't
[1:02:23] understand it
[1:02:27] come on did the prophets say that then
[1:02:31] he wouldn't preach on hail for all of
[1:02:32] those here why because you didn't
[1:02:34] understand well see we try to figure it
[1:02:37] out now just read something leave it
[1:02:39] alone if you don't see it just read it
[1:02:41] leave it along just lay it down and you
[1:02:46] just say well Lord now all right you
[1:02:48] come on the scene somewhere all right it
[1:02:50] may be six months before you come back
[1:02:53] to that same thought or topic or reading
[1:02:56] again but just keep waiting and then
[1:03:01] you'll come and answer you if we're his
[1:03:05] children so brother branham how do we
[1:03:09] attain to this faith of the father's
[1:03:13] this adoption this statue of a perfect
[1:03:17] man when we realize that those virtues
[1:03:20] are required and those virtues are
[1:03:22] saying the same thing is the adoption is
[1:03:24] required that we have this to come to
[1:03:27] the faith of the fathers how do we get
[1:03:30] the faith of the father's Lord
[1:03:31] well I just study myself into it we'll
[1:03:35] get into it it's not head knowledge
[1:03:41] it's not head knowledge it's holy ghost
[1:03:44] knowledge the disciple didn't have just
[1:03:48] head knowledge they had Holy Ghost
[1:03:49] knowledge scene I want what they had
[1:03:52] don't you well brother Dale all my life
[1:03:57] I've wondered how do we get this how we
[1:03:58] get do you believe God sent us a prophet
[1:04:05] do you believe God sent us a prophet
[1:04:08] well then are we going to take what the
[1:04:10] prophets say it like I said we say
[1:04:12] brother Branham what is the baptism of
[1:04:15] the Holy Ghost and he says it's
[1:04:16] revelations Jesus Christ personally you
[1:04:20] write well what about these virtues I
[1:04:24] heard about this statue of a perfect man
[1:04:26] we've read this and over and over and
[1:04:28] over enough to you do you order be able
[1:04:30] to read it we'll go ahead and we're
[1:04:31] number four and put it up brother
[1:04:34] Branham how do we get these things as he
[1:04:38] tells us well I think it ought to be now
[1:04:45] I don't care what you think you or not
[1:04:47] care what I think you ought to care what
[1:04:49] God thinks right look what he said now
[1:04:54] this message of Malachi 4 revelation 10
[1:04:57] 7 is gonna do two things one according
[1:04:59] to Malachi 4 you turn the hearts of the
[1:05:01] children to the father you know what
[1:05:06] he's talking about it won't be him
[1:05:09] coming down and turning us it's his
[1:05:10] message right now come on are you are
[1:05:14] you with me it's his message he come to
[1:05:19] do that someone had to turn us back to
[1:05:22] the original truth and that's what the
[1:05:25] prophet came for
[1:05:27] it's his message that turns us back it's
[1:05:32] not if he just walks out and flicks a
[1:05:33] coin and we turned back look what he
[1:05:40] says okay don't brother branham you
[1:05:43] telling me that the way that I get this
[1:05:45] part of Melek I for I read in Malachi 4
[1:05:49] that the first part of that because I've
[1:05:52] got the answer we know the truth of it
[1:05:53] John the Baptist
[1:05:55] was a part of mela cautery and john the
[1:05:58] baptist's turned the people of the old
[1:06:01] testament the father's to the new
[1:06:03] testament message which was jesus christ
[1:06:05] right you know he never taught anything
[1:06:08] about this or that he never talked
[1:06:10] doctrines of one God and all the things
[1:06:13] he turned us to the original so you
[1:06:17] understand what it would be then to turn
[1:06:19] the hearts of the Old Testament Saints
[1:06:21] to the New Testament message he turned
[1:06:26] them right straight to Jesus Christ
[1:06:28] right so what would be the end time to
[1:06:32] turn the hearts of the children back to
[1:06:34] the fathers it be the same Lord Jesus
[1:06:37] Christ right but it's in the way he's
[1:06:40] doing it all right so what does he do
[1:06:45] how do i how do I know this is right
[1:06:50] because the word says it and according
[1:06:53] to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of
[1:06:55] the children to the father's now we know
[1:07:00] who's going to do it right we got that
[1:07:05] solid we don't need another prophet we
[1:07:07] don't know how to run around with some
[1:07:09] of these big things that's going we know
[1:07:12] where it's at it's the message of the
[1:07:13] hour it's the prophets message all right
[1:07:17] that settle okay now well brother
[1:07:21] Branham we don't see it in full
[1:07:25] manifestation we don't we know that what
[1:07:30] was to be was to be brought by Malachi 4
[1:07:33] and we understand that you and your
[1:07:36] message in the relation would be Malachi
[1:07:38] 4 the truth and we were just talking see
[1:07:45] we're talking to brother Branham we're
[1:07:47] asking him questions why can't I ask him
[1:07:50] questions he's the one who taught it so
[1:07:54] what does he say he said all right its
[1:07:59] messenger of Malachi 4 and revelation 10
[1:08:04] 7 is going to do two things
[1:08:08] according to Malachi for you turn the
[1:08:11] hearts of the children to the father
[1:08:13] he's going to bring back the original
[1:08:16] faith that was in the early church right
[1:08:22] no you with me he's going to bring back
[1:08:25] the original Word uh-huh
[1:08:30] because that would be the restoring Park
[1:08:34] to bring back the original word that
[1:08:37] Satan ate away in the dark ages uh-huh
[1:08:42] he was to bring it to that all right now
[1:08:45] look say what we don't understand all
[1:08:47] about it okay he says now there's two
[1:08:49] things he's gonna do one he's gonna turn
[1:08:51] the hearts of the children to the
[1:08:54] father's we understand that has to be
[1:08:56] done for this requirement in the
[1:08:58] scriptures now how's it gonna be done
[1:09:03] how are we gonna be turned back we just
[1:09:08] got the message now listen what he says
[1:09:11] number two numbers don't do two things
[1:09:15] he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven
[1:09:19] thunders in Revelations 10 but ours
[1:09:27] whether or not you believe that that's
[1:09:29] been done I don't
[1:09:37] I don't play I put it straight he'll
[1:09:43] reveal the mysteries of the seventh mm
[1:09:45] has that been revealed now according to
[1:09:51] brother Branham the mysteries are now
[1:09:52] history I got these when we get home
[1:09:55] later into the message I want to know
[1:10:00] one thing you gonna be able to argue
[1:10:02] with it was honestly don't say it I
[1:10:05] stood and faced these things across the
[1:10:08] land for 50 years there's only one thing
[1:10:11] you're gonna argue about
[1:10:14] you're gonna argue your mind right now I
[1:10:16] said Argan because you're saying the new
[1:10:20] name of Jesus is to be revealed in the
[1:10:22] thunders what is that name that's the
[1:10:27] only one you can go with it come on you
[1:10:29] get on some of these others come on
[1:10:30] we'll talk the only thing you can say is
[1:10:34] worth a new name what is it my brother
[1:10:38] branham would you explain what you're
[1:10:42] talking about
[1:10:46] and many of you knows that he told us
[1:10:49] what it is
[1:10:53] it's Jesus no it's got to be something
[1:10:59] well in all right now I will go with the
[1:11:02] quotes he says why I love the message
[1:11:09] but I run said maybe it'll be in the
[1:11:12] made known when we get there you just
[1:11:18] lost your case he said maybe it'll be
[1:11:24] made known when we get there so you
[1:11:29] can't say the thunders are not sounded
[1:11:35] as the thunders and you want to go
[1:11:37] through the message you want to get over
[1:11:39] in in the message and has this happen
[1:11:41] has that happened he says happen
[1:11:48] looking for something instead of looking
[1:11:50] at what we've got so that's what I hold
[1:11:53] on to that I ain't worried about it now
[1:11:55] listen the mission of the seven thunders
[1:11:57] reveling to which are the revelation
[1:11:59] contained in the seven seal
[1:12:01] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:12:02] truths that literally turned the hearts
[1:12:05] of the children to the Pentecostal
[1:12:07] father's huh so how do we get back to
[1:12:12] the faith of the fathers by the prophets
[1:12:15] that brought the message right he
[1:12:21] brought the message that's how you and I
[1:12:24] are to a time how are we going to be
[1:12:30] turned back to the faith of the fathers
[1:12:32] then why are people so scared of the
[1:12:35] messages related to the seals in those
[1:12:39] areas when the prophets done told you
[1:12:45] see they've got in the message now that
[1:12:48] see one group says the seals broke the
[1:12:51] other group says it ain't broke no the
[1:12:53] group says they don't know what's going
[1:12:54] on that's just the best way to say it
[1:12:58] we'll see we can ask brother Branham how
[1:13:00] they have they open he said yes but he
[1:13:04] said it'll never be made known to the
[1:13:06] public
[1:13:10] lean concerned with it was her the one
[1:13:13] they'd known to the bride all right now
[1:13:17] if we have to have these virtues to how
[1:13:20] the face of the fathers then we've
[1:13:24] already got the message to bring it to
[1:13:26] us
[1:13:28] it's his message would you listen to his
[1:13:32] message would that understand
[1:13:41] you see church that's why that the Word
[1:13:45] of God is true we are looking either
[1:13:52] back or looking forward we're failing to
[1:13:59] look at what's taking place they are
[1:14:03] things to take place in the forward
[1:14:05] right that we're not supposed to look
[1:14:08] for them here right but why can't we
[1:14:13] accept what's right here we look back
[1:14:19] thank god we've had the truth bro
[1:14:22] but the Bible has always been present
[1:14:25] tense anybody in the Bible that ever
[1:14:32] amounted anything how many times I made
[1:14:34] this statement it's built on the basis
[1:14:36] of a present tense God a reality of
[1:14:42] right now we were talking about it
[1:14:45] life's not then you know in the Bible
[1:14:48] study had a good time talking talking
[1:14:54] about where we're at and what's going on
[1:14:59] then you say brother Joe's got a thing
[1:15:02] in order to look at it it's just a
[1:15:04] natural way of showing something so you
[1:15:06] say they ain't nothing going on you know
[1:15:10] I'm not seeing this I'm not seeing that
[1:15:12] so we don't have it because of that you
[1:15:16] take a drop of water and analyze that
[1:15:18] drop of water and then that drop of
[1:15:21] water is all kind of wiggle tail and all
[1:15:24] kind of thing dirt and Trice and garbage
[1:15:28] is no you wouldn't even want to drink
[1:15:29] the water cuz it's got bugs in it and
[1:15:34] just a drop of water
[1:15:37] let's see you look at the drop of water
[1:15:38] and said I don't see nothing you don't
[1:15:41] see nothing because you got to magnify
[1:15:45] all of that to be able to find what it's
[1:15:47] talking about you say well I don't see
[1:15:50] nothing going on brother Dale so we must
[1:15:52] not have it
[1:15:55] that to me is the greatest thing that
[1:15:58] you can ever think of it's for God to
[1:16:04] try a group of people to see if they'll
[1:16:07] stay with the word when he seemingly
[1:16:12] himself just backs off seemingly from
[1:16:16] the time the prophet left to seen God
[1:16:18] has just backed off to allow of people
[1:16:25] to be tried to see if they're gonna
[1:16:28] stand with it and look what's happening
[1:16:31] he took some of them forty years before
[1:16:34] they bring in to break what you don't
[1:16:36] want
[1:16:36] you showed me a guy that left the
[1:16:38] message you show me one that's left the
[1:16:41] message now go back in his life you'll
[1:16:44] find he's got some problems way on back
[1:16:49] because he walks away from the message
[1:16:51] now he never was in the message not that
[1:16:57] simple
[1:16:58] is it true never was in the message if
[1:17:02] he leaves the message now I was got one
[1:17:09] mark we'll get to it this evening
[1:17:10] brother Brennan said I'll show you now
[1:17:14] we've heard this statement about how
[1:17:15] he'll say you know there that he makes
[1:17:18] this statement he says I'll show you
[1:17:20] where God put the gifts in the church he
[1:17:24] said I want you to show me one scripture
[1:17:26] where there was taken out you remember
[1:17:30] that he said they was put in the church
[1:17:33] and you show me where was taken out
[1:17:35] you're gonna be surprised when you get
[1:17:37] to those gifts when we're talking about
[1:17:39] the fivefold ministry being the gifts to
[1:17:42] the church
[1:17:49] but think on these things are these
[1:17:51] things required is it necessary that we
[1:17:55] have the faith of the Father not if we
[1:17:59] don't want it not if we don't want to be
[1:18:03] interchange not if we don't want to
[1:18:11] honor our Father to glorify God with the
[1:18:16] things of taking the word and standing
[1:18:19] on the word when everything else is
[1:18:21] falling away come on the Bible told us
[1:18:29] that it couldn't be any end until what
[1:18:33] there has to come a falling away first
[1:18:36] this is falling away now if Bible
[1:18:40] prediction the people falling away
[1:18:43] because you can't fall off a building
[1:18:45] till you get up on it is that sensible
[1:18:51] you can't fall off a building till you
[1:18:53] get up on the building so the people had
[1:18:56] to get up on the building before they
[1:18:57] can fall out they had to walk in the
[1:18:59] message do the best they could some for
[1:19:02] 30 40 years and all at once you see them
[1:19:05] start falling away they had to be so
[1:19:10] close so close to the truth
[1:19:17] I don't glory in that people are falling
[1:19:21] away from the message that's not my
[1:19:23] point my point is the fact that they're
[1:19:26] doing it and that's Bible the Bible says
[1:19:32] they'll do it so there must be a falling
[1:19:36] away first
[1:19:43] you senator denominations is falling
[1:19:45] away no they found their way 50 years
[1:19:48] ago get it right they fell away when
[1:19:53] they turned down the message and him
[1:19:54] trying to bring it and Gordon loved them
[1:19:58] for all of those years the dead raised
[1:20:00] the sick Hill and they're still walking
[1:20:02] away come on you think I'm hard to start
[1:20:08] what about when he had those ministers
[1:20:11] together to challenge him on you know
[1:20:14] what he called him people's nothing
[1:20:16] right and he said one of them said I
[1:20:21] want 300 types to take to all of my
[1:20:24] ministers they never come after one but
[1:20:31] you never heard that guy griping about
[1:20:33] it he just walked away people walked
[1:20:39] away from the message while the Prophet
[1:20:41] was here that's your organized religions
[1:20:43] and things falling away but now
[1:20:49] everybody's falling away churches
[1:20:54] everything's falling away one because
[1:20:58] the people has walked into the word
[1:21:00] they've walked into the opening of the
[1:21:02] word and they can't go any further you
[1:21:09] know what's going to happen you and I
[1:21:11] are gonna do the same thing if we're not
[1:21:13] genuine right cause this is the day of
[1:21:17] manifestation right you get a guy's name
[1:21:21] and put it up for him to run for
[1:21:23] president and before they type his name
[1:21:25] on the front page of the newspaper they
[1:21:28] don't already tell him where he's wrong
[1:21:29] and what he's been doing
[1:21:31] who keeps up with all this stuff I mean
[1:21:34] do they have people that don't do
[1:21:35] nothing with camera all day walk around
[1:21:38] you go follow from them I won't follow
[1:21:40] Bush I won't follow this one you know
[1:21:42] you understand one get that how do they
[1:21:44] know so quick I don't even know the guys
[1:21:48] name you know and as quick as his name
[1:21:54] is brother he's this
[1:21:56] that it's a day of manifestation the day
[1:22:01] of making known what we really are and
[1:22:05] what's going on but it's the day the
[1:22:07] bride is supposed to be made manifest to
[1:22:09] know who she is
[1:22:11] to see if she'll stay with the word what
[1:22:13] about God trying you what about God
[1:22:15] deliberately letting these things happen
[1:22:18] to try you to see if you'll stay with a
[1:22:22] word
[1:22:25] what about it and even got to the point
[1:22:28] because I knew I'd just come up to a
[1:22:30] certain spot with the Prophet said I've
[1:22:35] tried Lord to get this to the people he
[1:22:40] said I've tied 33 years 33 years he
[1:22:45] preached the statute of perfect man says
[1:22:50] where people said no he didn't preach me
[1:22:52] see you're looking for a title or a
[1:22:55] sermon you're not looking at the word I
[1:22:57] look back in 56 on on the inner veil
[1:23:01] when he's preaching a living moving
[1:23:04] instrumentality of Christianity God
[1:23:07] walking on two feet in the people he was
[1:23:09] trying to teach that to the to the
[1:23:11] systems back then and he come up to the
[1:23:14] Pentecostal trying to teach him and what
[1:23:16] did he say when he said for Pentecost
[1:23:18] fail he said that's where you're looking
[1:23:21] for this and said you're failing to see
[1:23:25] that the new birth was just the
[1:23:27] beginning and said you take it and
[1:23:31] shouting it out and running it over we
[1:23:33] got this we're in the latter rain
[1:23:34] he said nonsense he said the former rain
[1:23:37] ain't come yet that's that is that oh no
[1:23:41] word regional see see they thought all
[1:23:49] they had to do is go to church and as
[1:23:50] long as they spoke in tongues right some
[1:23:55] kind of gifts or something that there
[1:23:57] was a he said that just brains that that
[1:23:59] new birth this brings you into the body
[1:24:01] he was trying to teach them Pentecostals
[1:24:03] the stature of a perfect man that the
[1:24:06] new birth this puts you in the body
[1:24:10] let's say they had it down red and
[1:24:12] sealed up everything was ready to go we
[1:24:14] was waiting on the bus to pull up go
[1:24:16] we're here and they were shouting glory
[1:24:18] hallelujah and rejoicing about that and
[1:24:21] he said that's where Pentecost failed
[1:24:27] where did they fail they failed on a
[1:24:31] progressiveness to move on in God that
[1:24:34] is God through that prophet begin to
[1:24:36] bring deeper messages in deeper messages
[1:24:38] people begin to fall away he began to
[1:24:41] bring truth right and they begin to fall
[1:24:46] away until he wound up in the end of his
[1:24:49] ministry preaching to half a dozen and a
[1:24:51] trailer or something because that's
[1:24:57] always going to listen do you understand
[1:25:03] why you must have these virtues because
[1:25:11] God has required it but now he's told us
[1:25:17] how to get it you think that wasn't a
[1:25:20] rejoicing time to me and somewhere along
[1:25:22] about 1980-81 somewhere right in that I
[1:25:25] had asked him over and over Lord how do
[1:25:27] I get these virtues and all like that he
[1:25:32] said just read 327 Church age book there
[1:25:38] was the answer the opening of the seven
[1:25:46] seals the opening of the word is to
[1:25:51] convert a people from babies to
[1:25:56] adulthood do you understand that it's
[1:26:01] gonna be adults that going to change of
[1:26:04] the body it's gonna be adults that can
[1:26:07] stand here and take all of the things
[1:26:10] it's going to be a dogs not babies
[1:26:18] we got it laid in our hands but what are
[1:26:19] we gonna do come on musicians what are
[1:26:22] we going to we've got to say welcome to
[1:26:24] our sister we see somebody back there I
[1:26:26] just she was behind that post and I kept
[1:26:29] moving around I don't think with it
[1:26:31] she's the first time here we say to you
[1:26:33] welcome glad to have you with us he's
[1:26:36] been here before we're glad to have her
[1:26:37] with us so with us either way okay but
[1:26:40] it's glad to do that what is the faith
[1:26:45] of the fathers the revelation of Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ in his word and then we are
[1:26:57] supposed to be manifest what those early
[1:27:01] church was now all I've ever said to you
[1:27:04] is what I said wanna go take us and put
[1:27:08] us back down you know I see things kind
[1:27:14] of funny I guess maybe you know what
[1:27:17] people say I don't want to live under
[1:27:19] the law you know what it'd be easy to
[1:27:22] live under the law you just don't do
[1:27:24] that right you just don't know how many
[1:27:33] of you got up stole stuff this morning
[1:27:35] how many of you lied and cheated and
[1:27:38] done everything today we don't want it
[1:27:42] be easy to live by book of rules but see
[1:27:50] then it brings it into the Christian
[1:27:52] realm that doesn't make it hard for us
[1:27:55] to do those things if we let it be part
[1:27:59] of our life this let it be part of our
[1:28:04] life you could live a good life under
[1:28:08] the Old Testament because you wouldn't
[1:28:10] be guilty of this that is everything
[1:28:11] long as you ain't guilty ain't guilty
[1:28:14] but yet you wouldn't be living what you
[1:28:17] need to be you know you don't have to be
[1:28:21] good to be a Christian you just have to
[1:28:23] be a Christian that automatically makes
[1:28:26] you good that's no problem you know I
[1:28:28] mean I steal everything I'm gonna steal
[1:28:30] don't you
[1:28:31] I mean come on Mina is that honest and
[1:28:38] sincere
[1:28:39] we don't go do those things we live a
[1:28:42] decent life would that be perfect under
[1:28:44] the law cuz you wouldn't be breaking it
[1:28:48] so he could live good Andrei but that
[1:28:51] would not be the fulfillment of what God
[1:28:53] wanted God wanted the people that would
[1:28:56] come forth into manifestation and be the
[1:29:00] law made flesh cuz that's what he was no
[1:29:04] no no no no no he was grace you know
[1:29:07] honey you don't listen he was the
[1:29:10] fulfillment of all the Old Testament
[1:29:12] Scriptures and all of that spoke of
[1:29:16] grace he just couldn't make it manifest
