uh betting and uh was not doing real well couldn't breathe and there's a lot of different things when as soon as he was born they took him to the queue a lot of different things but uh they come out of that uh in a few days was able to breathe on his own um he's still he's still got a little ways to go but he's but the Lord has really brought him along just so I just thank the Lord that uh he's mindful because it doesn't matter who put has faith in his word he honors he honors their faith right because it doesn't matter if I pray for you or you know because brother BR said it didn't matter who prayed for somebody you know just he said if he can enter in and have faith then he's obligated to fulfill his word and just praise the Lord for that and y'all just continue to pray for him his name little boy's name is Liam and uh getting bigger all the time Hallelujah we just thank the Lord Lord knows all things and takes care of all things and we just put our faith in him that's right amen so God bless you this evening we're going to look into the scripture we're going to look in uh two places uh Isaiah the book of Isaiah 57 and then then we're going to go to uh Luke uh 19 and uh so and uh I don't know if Brother Anderson got that right or not he put acts Luke 9 this going to be 19 but anyway we we'll read acts 92 I mean Luke 92 but uh before we read the scripture now let's just all bow our heads and speak to the Lord our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we're so thankful again to be in your house Lord together with those of like Precious Faith Lord to gather around the revealed word of the hour and Lord we just pray tonight you just come and speak and just Lord just calm our minds and our and our spirits and Lord Jesus you just come and anoint us to hear and to speak and Lord just have your way with us tonight Lord there's you know what's I have in my heart to speak tonight Lord but it takes you to come and speak I can't do it in myself but we're realizing we just have a gift to just get ourselves out of the way and that you can come and and Lord you told us that the people just operate the gift Lord we just come and Lord they pulled and Lord you can come and speak to us because it doesn't matter what we have to say Lord if you just come and give us the inspiration the anointing to speak Lord we can speak whatever has whatever the needs are Lord whatever the questions are Lord and we just believe that and we just rest in that this evening we just pray for each one that's not here Lord we just pray for Brother Gary there Lord Jesus just continue to touch him and and be with him Lord and lift him up and for each prayer request Lord each one that's been represented by the uplifted hand Lord there's so many that Lord you're still on the scene you're still mindful each one and you're still taking care of us and Lord you helped us get out of bed this morning and and get on our way and you took us through our our jobs and our responsibilities through the day and Lord you know we know that the scripture tells us that the the devil is is seeking whom he may devour Lord but we know that the angels of God encamped about us and Lord no matter what we do we know that you're there and you just take care of us and we're so thankful for that even many times Lord we're not even thinking and not realizing just how present you are with us and we just want to be more mindful that you're with us and that you're there to help us and lead us if we just trust in you and Lord we just commit all things to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen amen amen Isaiah 57 and we're going to begin verse 10 and and the scripture says Thou Art wearied in the greatness of thy way yet sest thou not there is no hope thou Hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou was not grieved and of whom Hast thou been afraid or feared thou Hast lied and Hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart have not I held my peace even of old and thou fearest me not I will declare my righteous and thy works for they shall not profit thee when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away vanity shall take them but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land and shall inherit my ho mountain and shall say cast ye up cast you up prepare the way take up the stumbling block out of the way of my people for thus sayth the high and lofty one that inhabit inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I will dwell in the high and holy place with him also that is of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite ones for I will not contend forever neither will I be always WTH for the spirit shall fail before me and the Souls which I have made right amen and now we're going to go I think Brother Anderson got it wrong he put Luke 9ine and Luke 9 says and when he called his 12 disciples together he gave them power and authority over all diseases all over all Devils to cure diseases right amen but now the place that I want to read from is going to be Luke chapter 19 cuz I wrote I put 19 on there but he he must have so anyway we're going to go to Luke 19 let me read that right quick and uh but I mean am man he did give us power over all powers of the darkness and over diseases and all but if we go to Luke chapter 19 beginning in verse one cuz they've got this mixed up but anyway um Luke 19 verse1 says and Jesus entered and passed through Jericho and behold there was a man named zachus which was the chief among the publicans and was rich and he sought to see Jesus who he was and could not for the Press because he was little of stature and he ran before and he climbed up in a sycamore tree to see him for he was to pass that way and when Jesus came to the place he looked up and saw him and said unto him zachus make haste and come down for today I must abide at thy house and he made haste and came down and received him joyfully and when he saw it they all murmured saying that he was gone to be a guest with a man that is a sinner and zakus stood and said unto the Lord whole Lord the half of my goods I give to the poor and if I have taken anything from any man by false accusation I restore him fourfold and Jesus said unto him this day is salvation come to this house for as much he is also a son of Abraham for the son of man is come to seek and Sav that which was lost am amen God bless you you may be seated this evening so they got that mixed up a little bit so but amen all the word all the words good just like the like the old black man said they want to know where he wanted to read from he said just read it he said it's all got to be preached so God bless you and uh y'all just just help me this evening a little bit I want to speak a little thought on prepare the way and uh that the scripture here in Isaiah what what he brings out and you can read the whole scripture and basically if you read the whole book of Isaiah you know Israel Israel's in sin and Isaiah is trying to restore it is calling for Israel to come back to God because God wants to restore them and U here he is speaking again and and you and you see when when Isaiah starts to speak in in in this chapter he's speaking uh he's he's identifying Israel as a harlot and he's talking about the things that they do and one of the things that you find out when he gets into the scripture here in verse 10 and he says I just kind of break this down for you a little bit he said Thou Art wearied in the greatness of Thy Thy way he said yet sayest thou not there is no hope and he says but thou Hast found the life of thine hand therefore thou was not grieved and now what what he's saying is when you look back at what he's what he's trying to say is they were looking at the journey the the travel that they were in the relationship they had with God and he said that y'all see that it's uh great or the or the length of of the travel of the things that you've gone through and he said yet you said that uh we have no hope yeah yeah because they're in sin and they're looking at what they have yet they don't realize that they have no hope because they never come to the point and realize that they or how bad a shape they're in is what he's saying because he's pointing back and saiding but y'all don't realize just how bad y'all are and he said thou Hast found the life of thine hand therefore was thou not grieved or what he's what he's getting to at this point is he was talking about he said y'all have found a place of uh of rest or relaxation one of the one of the translations of this says that they were quickened and the and the way that you uh get you to understand what he's trying to drive at is here is he's talking about the the length and the and the travel and and the relationship with God yet as many times people do that they go out in and live in a world of sin and a life of sin and then all they want to do is stop doing that for a while they don't want to ever get away from it but they want to they want to get away from it and ease their conscience long enough because they just want to just cover it over but then they'll go right back to it and that's what he's saying is here this because he said you were you've wearied in this but he said you never come to the place to realize that you need to come to me because you have no hope and so they're they're driving at this point and he said yet he said yet you've not been grieved or you you've not come to the place that you need to come back to where I am because you've just come and you just set it aside for a little while and you relax and you know you just try to live a moral life and then you go right back to it and you've not come to the place that you need to come back and and just turn away from all that and leave that but they go right back to it and so he said see they've not seen how bad they are he said yet you've not been grieved you you've not come to the place of repentance you've not come to a place of of seeing just how morally rep rep reprehensible you are and so then he goes on and talks about and he said of whom hast thou been afraid or feared that thou Hast lied and Hast not remembered me nor laid it to thy heart right so whatever has happened to them that has caused them to fear they they they re reacted in fear but they never thought of God and when they were in the time of fear even though God was there and wanted to speak to them yet when they had fear and they were afraid yet they never thought of God right they went they just went on and so then he continues on he said and thou Hast lied and Hast not remembered me so when somebody come and and ask them are you a Christian or they come and ask somebody something that that was going to be hard to them they just thought well we'll just take the easy route out and we'll just lie about it yeah you know just like Abraham did with with his wife you know when when they asked about with Sarah his wife no that's my sister right instead of telling the truth it was just easier to lie about it and so it's the same way with Israel when they come to when they've had fear or when they when the Press came on them they just lied about it and he said and he said nor laid it into thy heart so what it was was they went through all this and it never affected them they lied and it never affected their heart it never had any effect on them and you know and because here as you get through this see God is grieved by this and that's the reason that he was speaking through Isaiah was he was speaking because it grieved him to see Israel in their condition but you know what they didn't they didn't care but he stood there and then when he when it continues on here he said of whom hast thou been afraid and fear and thou Hast lied and has not remembered me nor laid it in thy heart have I not held my peace even of old and thou Hast not feared me yeah so he didn't speak to them even though he was there and they knew it but you know what they got to the point where you know what they had no fear of God they never thought of God they never thought of what would take place they never thought the penalty and the price they would have to pay for their actions they never they never thought of that so because God said well because I never spoke to you you forgot what it was going to cost you right and so he continu on here he's trying to get them to understand what kind of condition they're in he said I would declare thy righteousness and thy works for they shalt not profit thee so he's he's telling them their condition and the things they do have no profit to you why because it's going to cost you more in the end and so he's going to continue how what it's going to cost them he said but when thou criest let thy companies deliver thee but the wind shall carry them all away right so what he was talking about was Israel being in idolatry he said but when you cry out he said cry out to your Idols cry out to your false gods and let them answer but he said when you call out he said the wind will carry them away he said they will all be blown away he said nothing will stand they'll all be destroyed because because there's nothing that's going to stand before them he said vanity shall take them he shall put but he that putteth his trust in me shall possess the land or the scripture says he that puts his trust in me shall possess the Earth possess his Earth and he said and then he goes on and says and he shall inherit my Holy Mountain right or the possession that God has for him and he said and shall say cast ye up cast you up prepare the way take up the stumbling block out of the way of the people out of my people so what what they're saying here is when when this person that comes to this place of receiving this inheritance and they take this the person that trusts in God and they take their possession then that person will cry out that they will tell them he said cast you up or cast you up and what that what that means is for you to prepare a road to prepare a path and what you do before you go out and pave a road you've got to go out and you've got to scrape the road and you've got to add uh dirt and such to it gravel to build it up because you can't just pave on anything and so what what he's saying cast you up or Build It Up Lift It Up he said prepare the way or or make the road or make the highway as one uh translation says make the highway make this highway and then he says take up The Stumbling Buck out of the way of my people or the things that are because these are the way as you're as you're laying this Foundation then you're going to remove the things that are standing between you and God because that's what the people of God are going to do so he's saying these people are going to cry out because somebody that trusts in God now everybody else just held on to their Idols they just continue to do the same thing but there was somebody who was raising up and they were going to stand there and they were going to call out and they were going to show people the way they were going to prepare the way for the people because you know the thing is it wasn't just that Isaiah came out there or any of the prophets ever came and just spoke just to be speaking but he spoke to a a group because somebody was there to hear the word because brother bham said that God just didn't send his word out for nothing but there was a group that was going to hear that word so there was a group that came because somebody was calling out to tell them to come back because there was a way made there was a way made for the people to come to this am he said for thus saith the high and lofty one that inherit inhabiteth eternity whose name is Holy I will dwell in the high and holy place with him also that of a contrite and humble Spirit to revive the spirit of him of the the spirit of the humble and to revive the heart of the contrite once so there was a place a high a high and holy place which was the word which was the place of Fellowship because when you when you go into the Old Testament and you look when they talk about Mount Zion or when they talk about Jerusalem when they talk about going up they were talking about not just a place because it wasn't geography that they're speaking when David speaks of Zion he or Isaiah even speaks of the the ones returning back to Zion they're not speaking of a geographical place they're not just talking of the city of Jerusalem because the most important place in all Jerusalem and all of that was the holy of holies because that was the place of of divine Fellowship so when they speak of Mount Zion they're not talking about coming to any place they're talking about Divine fellowship with God because you're coming back to that place and so this is what he's talking about when you come back you're coming back into Divine Fellowship because you're coming back to the word you're coming back to the fullness of the word but he said the only way that you can do that is to have a contrite and humble Spirit to revive those that have this to revive these and he said for I will not contend forever neither will always be rough for the spirit shall fail before me and the Souls which I have made right because he said there's a time that this is going to be over with he wasn't going he wasn't going to contend with them he wasn't going to fight with them he wasn't going to try to call them because there was a time that mercy and Grace was to be extended and after that it was over with but here's the time so he's making his his call made to Israel for them to come and that's because that is what what God has for us amen because now is the time because God is calling for his for his people now he's calling for the bride now because that's this is the call but you know he's laid it out there because many people have stood around the message around around the churches and and but they have not come into this place I mean you can you can be good you can be moral you can do a lot of things but if you're not born again it doesn't matter there there's no there's no place to be but you've got to come into this place place and he's standing there calling out to every individual the the Call's been made but it's your choice amen so you have to you have to call and that's the reason I want to speak on this because you know brother brandham makes a makes a an interesting thing and is from the message God ha uh a provided way in 1956 and he and he's talking he says don't you like to entertain people he said don't you like to go out and take people to your home and entertain them you clean up everything you fix everything you know put a little flow here you this is just the way they would like it fix a little thing here now see they like this so you fix it just making arrangements I know that they like this kind of meat so you prepare the meat real spicy and nice because if you can't do it you get somebody else to do it but who can do it better you're making arrangements preparations for something because you want your to be highly entertained he said God HD in sunred times he wanted his children to have the best so he made the preparations he foreshadowed it through the prophets he revealed it in Christ and the table set today and every man woman that's invited has a welcome to come to this table for he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed it's all foreseen it's provided and prepared the meal's ready they the call is given he foresaw it he made a prep he made preparations it's God's provided way for you when your souls are hungry right so here he is he's speaking of of making a preparation and you know one of the the the last two sermons that that I that I preached on or a couple of them that that I had preached on you know um one of them was uh speaking on Isaiah 61 and you know I kind of like the book of Isaiah just kind of speaks to me sometimes but you know Isaiah 63 because when he speaks of when Jesus Takes the book in Isaiah and he's reading it and he's speaking of the first of his first coming you know Isaiah is writing but then in the verse three he says to appoint unto them that mourn in Zion Beauty for Ashes the oil of joy for mourning the Garment of Praise for the spirit of heaviness and when you go back and you look at at the verse there where it says a point you know many people look at that word a point and I don't know if you remember but many people look at it as as something that's just set aside or a decision that's made but when you go back in the scripture and you look at that when he speaks of what he appointed that wasn't something he just set aside it wasn't something he said but that's actually something that was actually laid on them because one of the trans uh definitions of that word means to transform into so so when he laid that on them when he put that on there so when you're speaking of of of what he's done he's made this preparation for you it wasn't that he just made a decision for you Brother Richard but when he came inside of you he prepared prepared you for this because you have been given because see everywhere I go I want everybody to know he said everything that you have need of in this Earthly Journey was given to you but the thing is is it's just like a soldier brother R talks about a soldier when he goes into battle when he hears that sound he's been trained he's been he because you know there was a there's a little slogan somebody said he said don't practice something to get it right he said practice it till you can't get it wrong so when you're practicing see a soldier when they give ready it doesn't matter what kind of pressure they're under or what happens you know what they know what to do but you know what they're equipped to do the job so you're given them and so God has given us everything so you know what the pressures that you're under the things that happen to you you know what it doesn't take God by surprise but the thing is is you've got to know that you're equipped to do that he said that's the reason he said for you to take on the whole armor of God see you've been that you may quench the fiery darts of the enemy that you can overcome the devil why because you've been equipped not that because God knows what you can do but you've got to know what you can do he knew what job could do but job had to know where he stood with God when he knew what where he stood with God see then he knew God was real he knew God had spoke to him he had a revelation but that's the only way that you and I will ever have a revelation we've got to have an experience with something see you just can't have you just can't have there's a lot of people in the world they can they can do a lot of talking they know a lot of talking they can read a lot of things things but the thing is is it real is it life to them is it something that's changed you that's right because I don't want to I don't want to be the same old Aaron Roberts that I was I don't want to have anything to do with that old man I you know because he's been gone he's been buried in the in the sea of God's forgetfulness and I don't ever want to see him again right I don't ever want to dig him up I don't want anybody else digging him up but see God has appointed these things to us he's provided these things to us so if we understand what's been provided for us because see we you know God can lay these things out before you but the thing is is you've got to use them but the thing is is there God has God had many times people talk about you know brother Bram talks about God uh money in the bank you know when it when he talks about the the lady that had the had the checks from India her son was in India you know she had them all in her Bible she didn't realize what she had she carried around all the everything that she had needed in her Bible but she didn't realize she had what she was needing she was standing there starving to death trying to get somebody to help her and she had everything in her Bible and brother BR say you know she thought that it was just pretty pictures to her but he said come to come to find out it was real value to her and then he turns around and says and brother he said when they try to tell you of a painted fire of Pentecost he said don't you believe it see many people have talk about what happened in the good old days but you know what what happened in the good old days still happens today the problem is as people have got their eyes filmed over and can't see that God's still here because they want to talk about what happened years ago well praise to God what happened years ago but you know that same one is still here today to do the same thing and brother ROM says you know he's here tonight to heal the sick to save the lost to fill with those filled with the Holy Ghost those who want to be filled he said do you agree with that you you know the congregation says amen and I read that everywhere I go why because I want people to know I still believe he's say he's the same yesterday today and forever because what he started way back there he still does it tonight but the thing is is you and I have to come on the same ground the same Faith the same understanding that they had to receive it because you know what he's still here tonight to do it but you've got to believe that he's going to do it right many people can say well God can well I believe God will but what a lot of people talk about money in the bank you know they talk about money in the bank well see that's some kind of abstract concept or something but you know the thing is is it's different when somebody takes when it's like when it's something that somebody hands you right see it's not it's not just because we use that as a as a as a form of understanding but see we don't realize that it's actually there right exactly because lots of times we say well you know we can have a money you know Bank full of money next thing you know it's all gone cuz all all it is is a bunch of ones and zeros yeah right brother Anderson tell you all about that yeah people going have money next thing you know they got nothing but see the thing is the scripture tells us you know what thieves can't get to this moth moths can't destroy this there's nothing that can happen to this because it's been given to you then there's nothing that can be Tak away from you but the problem is is you won't use it it's been given to us he said it's the father's good pleasure to give you the kingdom but the problem is is you've got to believe it and you got to use it because he said as as many times that we know that you got people that can write a check but they got no money in the bank and you got people that can write you know that got money in the bank but they can't write a check and so people got to understand that you've got to know what you've got and you got to know how to use it right exactly right that's sir so when when God speaks this is what what we have been given this is this is what has been given so he's prepared the way for you but the thing is is because you've got to prepare the way to use it right because that's what God wants us to do just realize you've got to prepare the way because we the way has been prepared but you've got to get prepared because you know he when when Isaiah or when God spoke to Moses and was telling him about bringing the children of Israel out you know there was there had a way had been provided long before that and you know I was I was listening to brother brand and he was preaching on the message uh teaching on Moses when he was talking to the children and you know many times we all we'll take that and we'll go right back to you know the foundation of the world we'll say you know God had all this provided way before the Foundation War by the way all this was laid out and God knew what was going to take place but you know there was people that didn't know what was going to take place oh yeah that's right exactly when you go back and you read that and what struck me was brother Brown was talking about amram and amram you know he went out there and he saw the condition that his people were in yeah and he saw what was taking place and you know you go back and you read and he said you know what he saw those young men were going through all the time how they were being mistreated and all the things that took place and you know he would come home and and he didn't even want to eat all he wanted to do was pray to God yeah and he couldn't sleep he couldn't eat all he want to do was pray to God why because he wanted God to come and deliver his people he said are you are we not are we not your people we want deliverance we want we want to see something take place and you know he just kept on praying to God every night you know and every time he'd go out and he'd pray all night and then he'd get up and he' go to work the next day and it was worse than it was the day before and you know he just go right back and he would go right back in and he was praying all the time looking for a deliverer amen I think it was brother brother klie I may be wrong but I think it was brother collie was talking about somebody and you know they were talking about praying all night because they wanted to see a Revival and they just kept praying and praying the most of the night and you know the Lord told them said well if you just pray a little bit longer you can have a Revival and people saying well Lord I'm praying most of the night already but you know what they didn't do that when God said pray some pray longer pray longer you know what that's exactly what they done they kept praying longer and praying longer and praying longer and you know what a Revival took place but you know what God gave them the answer but he wanted to see just how far they would go with that and you know here was amram and he just kept going on on and on and on because you he saw the condition that they were in but you know what he kept crying out for a delivery and you know it wasn't just Moses and them but you know it was his father and those that were there they kept praying and all of a sudden God come to amram and told him he said the deliverer will come right and you know what then the next day he didn't cry out to God anymore why because when he received that Revelation then he went out there praise God let's make some more bricks well guess what the the Egyptians want more bricks we're going to make more bricks but you know what our day our days of making bricks is over there's a day it's appointed unto us that we're going to quit this brick making and we're going to go into a land flowing with milk and honey we're going into a land that's promised to us we're coming out of this place because you know he went back but it was the same situation that he was in but he kept going back and he was so thrilled why because he knew God had spoke to him and one a day when it came time according to life Joseph had bore a son right and you know what was so amazing you know he didn't get upset because when this was going on the Egyptians were killing babies killing baby boys and that's what he had but you know what he knew God had spoke to him didn't matter to him God had his hand on this boy he come to do a job that's right it didn't matter what was going to take place God was there God was going to take place God was going to take care of him and when he got to be three months old you know he had to go down there and he had to make a decision not not not a wonderful decision not something anybody wanted to do but it was something that had to be done he went and told Joseph and and and Miriam and them and said listen we've got to get rid of him we've got to take him and do something with him because they're going to find him and they're going to kill him and God spoke to him and told him said there's a way out there's a way but you've got to make it God gave him the way but you know what amram was down there making and taking sticks and waving a basket and Aaron went got Pitch and you know they fixed the ark for Moses to float in God gave him away but you know what amram had to take that and make that Ark right and they had to put him in the in the O in the river and send him away but see the thing is is they thought they they thought they were trying to you know they thought they were losing him and didn't realize that he was in he was in the plan of God he was in God's hands because as soon as soon as he went and and Pharaoh's daughter found the next thing you know Miriam was there and said oh do you need a nurse well I know a wonderful lady that can take care of your son the one that boring but you don't know that right so what she got paid to take care of her own child right amen and so here he was when when death was all around God had a place to put his Prophet that he was stationed and that he was appointed to this place why because he was given everything they had need of he was given the best education the best everything when his when everybody that was related to him was under that death curse out there dying and sweating and toiling there was a Moses sitting there in the lap of luxury and God had his hand on him and brought him through to the place that when he came old enough see that whole time when he was under that see his mom was teaching him the whole time that you know what you're the deliverer you're not that woman woman son but you've come from from the mind of God to deliver these people that's right and see and then but see he got exalted in himself and he tried to do it by himself he didn't wait on God to do it he tried to do it in his and that's where he failed yeah he was the deliverer but it wasn't the time and he wasn't in the right condition to do the job but when he came to the place and then he was on the backs side of the desert and he forgot everything that he had and he forgot everything thing that he learned and he got rid of everything else and he thought he couldn't do nothing and he was worthless then God said you're at the right time you're in the right place I can use you because he wanted to stand there because see God had told him through his mother who he was but you know he got to the place where he didn't realize and didn't believe that but you know what God had proven had made him got him ready to the job that had to be done and when he come to that place then he went out there and and God told you know he told God I can't speak I can't do these things I can't go before Pharaoh yeah you're perfect I got you right where I want you molded and he said guess what you can't speak well your brother can speak and speak for you that's what Richard always said about me he said I'm like Moses I can't talk but I got a brother named Aaron and he can just ask him he'll talk right and he can talk talk talk talk talk he'll talk about it whether he knows it or not just he'll talk but see God had it all planned out for Moses and when he went forth then he could step right in and he could go but see he was walking in the prayers and the faith that his father had yeah right because his father had went through all that and I don't know probably died in bondage but you know what there was Moses and God come down and met him and said I've heard the Cry of my people amen and he said I come down right but you know what you're going to be anointed to do this you're coming to deliver these people and you know what he done that every obstacle mes had God had an had a way for him had an answer for him but you know he just had to keep trusting even though the even though these people this group of people that were there that were longing to leave this place yet you know they they're Desiring to leave and when the door opens up they're still standing there he's trying to drag them out the door that's right and then every time because that they never saw never come to understanding that God had delivered them and he was going to continue to do that and they were unthankful everything had God done and all they could do was murmur and complain right right and when they come out of that then they went back and said oh we wish we were back there it was so wonderful the leaks and the garlics you know we had we had such a wonderful life of ease in Egypt yeah oh yeah we don't we don't remember all the people that died under the under the rule of the taskmasters we don't remember all the conditions that we lived in we don't remember how they took everything from us we just remember it's so wonderful yeah yeah see there's people that come out from come out from the world and see if you don't if you if you don't get right with God if you don't get filled with something the devil can paint you this nice pretty picture and people have come right out and you know because you can live a good life you can carry your message books and you can carry a Bible and you can just try to live it but as long as you're trying to live it it won't get you anywhere right it's going to profit you absolutely nothing just like just like Israel did when God was trying to tell them come on you need to come back to me and live the right kind of life and and get right with me right because no we're just going to take it easy we feel better we'll just go right back to it yeah and then that's what they do people just paint them a pretty picture and they're right back out in it oh yeah and it's worse the second time around that's right yeah amen but God made a way for them God brought them to the place God brought them through and he brought Moses to the place and he carried them through the into up to the land Moses done his part but you know there was there was one that came through that carried them all the way and you there was a there was a group of people that you know they may not have seen all the things that took place in Egypt they might have not seen all of but you know they had a they they heard about it yeah because you know the little ones there in the scripture in in numbers he says and and your little ones who you think will be a prey he said they'll go in and take that land they'll possess the land he said but your carcass is rot in the wilderness why because he kept trying to show them that there was a way made that but they had to prepare themselves to go in just like when they when they had the um the feast I mean the uh unleavened bread with the lamb you know they had to get ready to go out and then when they got ready to go in the land Joshua was there and told him said you prepare yourself because you're going in so he told him said you know God has given you this land because Abraham walked on this land yeah see the thing is is see God Abraham's life prepared this place for him yeah God prepared it because he gave it to them but you know what Mo Abraham had the promise because Abraham walked in the land Abraham put his feet there because everywhere he stepped was his possession but when they got ready to go in see the way had been prepared because Abraham's Faith had laid that hold for his children's and his children children and all those generations to go into that land but you know what when it came time for them to stand out there and Joshua gave them the word and told them said y'all prepare because in three days we're going over you know what they had to get themselves ready because everything else had been done but it was time for them to get ready to go in the land because they couldn't you know because Abraham had done his part and Joshua had done his part but the problem is see they had to get themselves ready that's that was where the issue was and see when they got ready then they had to go in but you know what it wasn't just a cakewalk when they went in see they had they had to get past a lot of messages of doubt and fear and unbelief and a lot of mixed up uh doctrines and things like that when they went into that land because there was only two of the of the 10 or of the 12 that actually had a had a real understanding of what was going to take place but see when they went in you know they had to fight they had to fight when they went in yeah it was there's land but you know what it just didn't lay there they had to go in and take it and say it's the same way you got to go up there you got to hit the road this is mine what they do they had to go out there and pull a sword and say listen you can leave or we can fight but y'all this is mine y'all going to have to go one way or the other and they had to make they had to make that determination that they were going to take it no matter what and a lot of them they F they F they took part of it but there was a lot of them that didn't take the land that didn't clear out all the unbelief that God told them to he said to utterly destroy it he said destroy all these people wipe them off push them off get rid of them but they think well we got 75% of it we're good 85% of it we're good no God said utterly destroy them get rid of them that's right and that's why that's why you know because what happened is later on they had the same issue they hadn't got rid of them and you know what they was born in their side forever right as long as they were there they had a thorn in the flesh because they never got rid of them because they never followed the word they never done what God told them to do so when God told him get rid of them get rid of them and so we know that see God has made a way he's made the way but they had to go in and take the land and do the things that God wanted them to do and all through the scriptures the same way right see God has laid the foundation and you I I think that I thank God that I had a I had a grandmother that believed this message I thank God that I had a grandmother that that had that really had a a relationship with Jesus Christ I believe I believe she had a a born again experience with this with with the god of Heaven I I believe she believed this message and I believe because I always knew one thing that no matter what what I where was at or what was going on in my life I had a grandmother that was praying for me see I I believe I believe today I'm the I'm and I you know you can look at me and and say whatever you know because I'm not what I what I used to be and I'm not what I want to be but thank God I'm not what I used to be but see the thing is I believe I'm standing here today as living manifestation of the faith of my grandmother because I I believe that's what takes place because somebody had had to pray for for me and each one of us we can go back and we can find somebody because you know somebody was praying somebody held the token over us somebody was doing something for us that we can come to this place you know I I think about the my you know my life and and my family and you know you go back and you look at you know um I had a grandfather you know he built some of the first you know Pentecostal churches in in the state of West Virginia and you know way back many many years ago when Pentecost was really Pentecost you know and you know when the um when ausa Street and all those you know different things were taking place and you know there's a there's a lot of family members you know they they look back and they say well we know what God really moved in the in our great grandfather and our great in in these people and all these type ones but you know what they still hold on to that as as their token as as their Banner that you know well it was good enough for Grandpa and it was good enough for Great Grandpa and all of them you know because they want but you know what they walked in the light for their day but the thing is is you know what God has moved on from there there's a greater light but shining there's there's something more than what they had and you know what I believe today because of their faith of what where they stood in the things because you know they were the ones that done without they were the ones that were ridiculed they were the ones that that were Outcast but you know what they stood with the word of God and they had faith and you know what I believe today that we're standing I'm standing where I am today because of what they've done why because they've laid the path for exactly and you know many other people can say the same thing they know you know because but a lot of people they just want to walk around and say well you know they want to hold that as a badge of honor but you know the thing is is Pentecost ain't where God is today because you know what God has come to Greater light and when when God has made known the word to you come on now when God opens the word to you and say well you know what I don't see that but I don't believe that but you know what it was good enough for Grandpa it's good enough for me yeah you can wear that as a badge if you want to but you know and I feel sorry for my family members because the way because they're under that because they're under that bondage why because because they've just held on to what what somebody else had but you know what I can't have somebody else's experience I can't I can't can't live what somebody else lived but you know what I believe what they laid was the foundation for what we came to because the life the word that came in our day was because of what they done what God moved back then but it God has moved today and he's made it known to us today and this is where God is today is for us to come to this place because God wants us to come here in the fullness of the word because I believe if my family members could come back today and were standing here today they'd be rejoicing for what they could hear today because over what they heard back there why because it's a greater light it's a greater Ministry than what they had back then that's right and see we can we can look and and and think about that all the way down through history you think about Peter and Paul and all of them all the things that they had if they could be here with us one time one service and see what and hear what we hear and heard what we've heard and to see where we stand today but you know what they have prepared the way for us they have laid this down but you know what with they without us cannot be made perfect because you know what we've got to come to the place that we've got to connect back to them in the fullness of the word because that's the only way they had the fullness of the word for their day but we've got to come back to the fullness of the word for our day we've got to come to the place that we Unite with them see we got to come and get them out of the ground why because when they have the fullness and we have the fullness then guess what when it connect then they come out of the ground because we're going to have the voice of the Resurrection that's going to speak to them that they're going to come up out of the ground see that's what that's what we have today that's the reason I'm so happy because I can see where I'm standing today why because God has made these things known to us because God has opened these things up to us but you know there's a and I just want to share a few other things with you but you know a lot of people when they talk about things that they they've tried to put up scarecrows and they triy to put up things to to scare people away and you know uh let's see if I can find this Brother Anderson if you can find Luke 6 there well this is the first this first verse but we'll go to 46 here in a minute he said a good man out of the Jesus speaking he said a good man out of the good Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is good and the evil man out of the evil Treasure of his heart bringeth forth that which is evil for of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaketh so when he continues on in verse 46 and he says and why call ye me Lord Lord and do not the things which I say whosoever cometh to me and heareth my sath sayings and doeth them I will show you to whom he is like he said he is like a man which built a house and dig deep and laid a foundation on a rock and when the flood arose the stream beat vly against the house it could not shake it for it was founded upon a rock but he that heareth and doeth not is like a man that with that without a foundation built a house upon the Earth which when against which the scam the stream did beat vehemently and immediately it fell and the ruin of that house was great and you know the thing that always come back to me was in the message time tested Mor Memorials of God brother Ram talks about the young architect that came from England when they wanted to build the Great the bridge in Sydney and you know everybody else went down there and they looked at it and all they could see was the shifting sand and you everybody said you can't build a bridge here there's nothing to build upon but brother R said that man got a vision of what could take place and you know he kept digging and digging and digging until he found the rock because he had to dig to find it and you know many people they say well you know you know you got to stay away from those deep things but you know that's what the but the the the Bible says in in in the in Corinthians there it tells us that God by his Spirit revealeth the things to man he said eyes Not Seen Nor Ear heard nor have it entered into the heart of man what God has prepared for them but he said the spirit of God have made know these things known hath revealed them right and he said the things of God he said yay the Deep things of God so the things that we you know that that are so fabulous to us that maybe our finite Minds can't understand yet the spirit of God is here to reveal those things to you exactly so when that man came along there when he said the man that's heard this word see you've got to dig deep because he said the wise man he dug deep until he found the foundation many people say well you got to stay away from those deep things no that's where the foundation is that's what you build upon you got to dig and dig and dig until you find the foundation but many people have not come to the place where they're going to dig and dig and seek until they find the foundation to build upon he said when you come to that place then he said you can build as a wise man he built that house he built a foundation he built a house that stood there and he said when the when the storms and everything came against it it could not be blown down it had a foundation and just like that man he had a vision of where to build and he dug and he dug and he dug until he found the foundation and he told him he said this is where we going to build everybody else ridiculed him but he said you know what I know what I'm doing right I've proven it that's it he said I don't care what you believe believe it or not he said I'm going to build this bridge he said I dug down and I found it and he laid that bridge and when it come time to cross it he said I'm going to be the first one to cross it and I'm going to prove to you that this is the foundation it's built just exactly right amen that's right and see the same thing Jesus came and he was the bridge the gap between God and man and he came and he came to do those things and it didn't matter if anybody else agreed with him or not or what they done but he came to do that because he said the son of man has come to seek and save those of which are lost and he came and he made it and he bridged that Gap and he come across and he came to you and I and he reached out to each one of us to bring us back so there's a way been made but the thing is that you've got to prepare the way that you got to come and get prepared and say Lord you prepare me to be your Sanctuary you prepare me to take me wherever I need to go Lord just take me if it's to the highest highs or the lowest lows but prepare me to be wherever I need to be just mold me in your image Lord wherever it's got to be but mold me and make me so that I can be like you but you've got to prepare the way right the Way's got to be made and if we can only make the way God has a lot for us right we have we have more than we can imagine oh yeah right so he's here tonight but you know what he's he's made the way from here to the Future home but is your ticket ready to go are you at the right place where you need to be as Brother D always says are you are you waiting at the bus stop waiting for a train right do you know where you need to be that's right do you know what's yours right amen that's it are you ready to go are you are you facing some kind of issue in your life and you're wondering if God's going to meet it or not have you just relaxed and let God take place let him have his way CU God has made way for us amen it's it's it's yours and I ours amen but you know we've got to accept it right amen you know I'm going to close with this the other scripture I read was zakus and you know and you think about zakus there and he was a man he cheated and lied and done all kinds of stuff to his own people you know he was well liked yeah he had a he had a lucrative job he collected taxes for the Romans yeah and you know how he got rich he over taxed everybody and then he just paid the wrong is what they wanted he kept the rest for himself he had a lucrative business and you know what nobody could stop him cuz he was under the under the protection of the Romans he got to do what he wanted to and everybody thought you know he's a low down scoundrel nobody liked him and you know he probably had that as as they call it that little Hitler syndrome because he was short of stature you know probably carried a chip on his shoulder all the time yeah a lot of people thought boy you know if I found him in a dark alley he wouldn't walk out but you know what he had a Praying Wife yeah drove him crazy because you know what he knew the truth but he didn't want to live it right but you know what God Was preparing a way for him that's right wife drove him nuts talking about Jesus and you know he walked around he didn't want to hear it but you know what it's something brother bham said you get salty enough he said you make them thirsty you know he just kept on going and it kept driving him crazy he said well I got to go find out about this Jesus all these holy rollers and nuts and everybody following this man around but you know the scripture said that he couldn't get close to Jesus because the Press was too great right and because he was short of stature he couldn't see but you know he could have went out there and said okay well I tried I couldn't get near him I couldn't see nothing I just seen a bunch of nuts running around everybody yelling at each other hosana to the King of Kings hey if you're the if you're the Son of God we got a graveyard up here full of people won't you come ra some dead yeah all this contention and fighting and everything going on he could have just said well you know I seen what I saw I'm going to the house but you know what he made a way for himself God made a way for him but you know what he went out there and you know brother Brown talked about you know he was wearing his good robes his good clothes but he had to go get that trash can so he get up in the tree you know he was gonna find something that day right and he got up in that tree and stood there and waited but you know what God knew knew where his where his each individual is God knew where his own are and when he come along there he was and he looked up in that tree and said zachus come down make haste we got to go to your house well here's a man that zakus didn't know him just the just the guy that his wife talked about all the time yeah how did he know who he was how did he know that he was in that tree for him to call for him to come down and when he came down out of that tree then he went and he said Lord he said I give I give half my to everything I got to the poor yeah he said I give half of it he said if I've defaed anybody he said I'll restore him for fold why because something took place that day that struck right zachus sitting in that tree you know what something God made a way through his wife something had prepared but you know zachus prepared a way for himself yeah because something drew him to climb up in that tree because he wanted to see something and that's when God met him see God's made a way for you and I but the thing is is have you made the way for him to come and meet you it may be it may be just like Elijah he had to go sit in a in a cave yeah you may have to climb a sycamore tree it may be climbing over in the pig pin right wherever it is but you know you got to come to a place to meet God because you got to you got to willing to meet God wherever he wants to meet you and when when he because the scripture said there it said that for zakus it said that Jesus was to pass this way he was passing his way so he's passing our way this evening and if if he's passing our way then you've got to make you got to prepare the way for him to reach you he's coming by but you've got to open up and say Lord come in amen right yeah amen because you know you can say well I brother and I'm born again I know that well that's wonderful but you know each one of us have need right who who who can raise their hands this evening and say I've got all all of God that I want I'm so full up I just couldn't stand it no anytime God comes and speaks to you anytime God gives you anything that just that just makes you more hungry right that just makes you want more of him the more more he reveals himself the more you want to see of him and say Lord I want I want more of you I want to see more of you Lord I want you to reveal your word to me because I brother Dell can preach but Lord if you don't come and Quicken it it don't mean anything it's not it's not going to because he can get up here and he can preach till he's blue in the face or he can just wear his out but if you don't come and Quicken it it's just it's just words in our ears it's just words that we hold and we think about but if it's not quickened lord it's not going to do us any good right right Lord come and and give us the give us the bread of life but make it real to Us open it up to us amen because I I believe we got the one of the finest Ministries in in all the world but you know what it can be prepared and Laden before you this this great feast is laid out before you and you know we can just come up there and say oh all I want is water and a toothpick and get nothing right but that's our choice but God is here tonight right and I you know take advantage of it I I want to take advantage of it am you know sometimes it's not it's not being in church where God speaks to you sometimes you're more confused when you come to church honestly I mean I am sometimes I I hear things I'm just like and I mean that's that's that because the thing is why because if it's in your mind the devil's going to fight you that's where the Battleground is and sometimes it's it's working sometimes it's on the roof at work sometimes it's working on an air conditioner sometimes it's out outside sometimes it's riding in the truck I don't I don't know about y'all I get I get I get praying time in the shower but see that you know there there's s that when you're by yourself that you can talk to God that you're just by yourself and all of a sudden God can right just drop something and it just opens up right and sometimes sometimes it's just one thought but you know what it takes that one thought right sometime sometimes it just takes that one piece and then over time it just right starts to build that's right and that's all you're waiting on is that one piece and that's what God's here for whatever you have need of right amen let's all stand this evening but God's God's good to us and he's here to give it whatever we have need of am I just want to thank the Lord that we have everything that we have need of Amen how many believes you're equipped this evening right amen that God has given you everything that you have need of right amen that he because he said he said that how be it when he the spirit of Truth has come right that's right when that Spirit of Truth has come he said he'll lead and guide you into all truth right amen so there's a place for every one of us to go right because there there until there's a body change right that's it we a't reached that point yet but there's still more to go and I may be behind all of you but guess what I'm there I may be you know I may be the one bringing up the rear but at least I'm bringing you know I'm in the I'm in the way right I'm going along it's a little it's a little song and we listen to on the in the van and little little group sings and and I I'm not going to sing it so I wouldn't I wouldn't wouldn't know half the words but it's such a good song but it talks about being a good soldier and he says he says my steps may not always be in time but he said when I hear the battle I'm near the front lines and that's what that's why I think about all the time we may we may not falter we may falter we may not always have everything right but let us be faithful in the fight whatever it is let's be faithful in it because like you like the song says I just want to you know Lord make me a good soldier amen let's let's sing a song 139 amen amen

the blow that made makes me white as no other F I know nothing but the blood of Jesus Amen don't you just love the Lord I want to want to tell you something I people ask me when when you find out when you're going to preach I said sometimes we find out we're going to preach when y'all find out we're going preach we don't we don't sometimes brother devil stop us on the way in on Sunday mornings and ask us and other times we find out when y'all find out got to be instant in season and out of season but you know sometimes you have you have no idea what you're going to say absolutely nothing and everything everything I I had originally to preach on tonight and I just sitting there thinking Lord what am I going to say and you go back through notes and everything and you just sit there and you read and you try to find something and you just praying and everything I had to preach on the other night you could have wrode on a 3x5 card and had a lot of left over and you just sit there and you think well you know what I'm going to go up here and I'm going to start with this and we'll see where we go but you know I I the Lord just come and I thought well he's the one does the speak and I don't I I just show up I'm just going to be present but you know the Lord come and at work we always have to we always have to carry a notepad with us and and pens and I was at lunch and I just pulled my pocket out and just I just started writing stuff and things just started opening up and you just think well you know I don't you you wonder but you know you you try not to get in get your mind into it because sometimes the devil say well you know what you GNA do now you got nothing you got nothing well you know what he spoke the world into existence out of nothing so that's right that's right there nothing there and he spoke and he spoke it in the existence so if I got no sermon he'll speak one into existence right but the Lord just come on the scene and I and I went home this I just I just had a little bit and I went home and started working on it this evening and things just started to open up and I you know I just thank the Lord that he's because you just get ready and just get prepared right and he'll he'll come on the scene and and and give you something to say to the people that's right and you know I learned a long time ago you know I I you I wish I could preach like I wish like I could preach like brother Dale and brother Wade but you know what I'm not them and I ain't never going to be like them and the day that I figured out that never going to be like them well praise the Lord cuz you know what I'm going to be Aaron Roberts because you know what I'm not going to be nobody else and I can't be like nobody else when I figured out who I am that that going to be like me then you know because I'm going I'm going to spit and and yell and scream the rest of them may not do that but I'm going to do that cuz that's me that's just who I am and you know I'm just everywhere I go I just and people say you know I I told them preached with brother brother Hughes the other other Sunday night and and I told him I said if y'all had been there Sunday night y'all wouldn't even known who I was if you been if y'all ever been to brother Gerald hughes's church I covered a lot of the platform I cover a lot anywhere let's put this way I covered Walking the platform as a big one I done a lot of walking but I tell you what I I think God that I just be who you are God made you who you are and you know brother R said when you when a person gets born again he said if they get born again in a in a more of a Pentecostal atmosphere they're going to be that type of person and he said he said if they're if they're more reserved he said they'll be more reserved exactly that's right so you just who you are cuz God that's how God made you that's right and you know I just I just am who I am and just thank God and you know when I realize I'm not going to be Brother D and they have their Ministry and I have mine thank God I'm going to be faithful in my little pieace amen and God has blessed us to do to do what God has given us to do and we just want to be faithful in that amen so God bless you tonight appreciate each one of you continue to remember all the ones that are not here with us that are sick I think about Brother Gary about every day and he's you know I know God's with him and you know I just you you you look at people and and you try to feel bad and sometimes you do but you know what God's mindful God's on the scene and when God's on the scene I think I think of brother dick all the time and it was because when brother Dick had cancer you know I was so I was so burdened and I've told I tell every I've told this I don't know how many times brother dick but I was so burdened riding in the truck at night and the Lord just dropped down and told me he said he said Lazarus was dead in the grave four days the scripture said that his nose had fallen in he was rotten and you know what the great physician passed by and diagnosed his case and said you know what you're not too bad off called for me come right up I was riding in the truck that day and the Lord told me said you know Lazarus was in was in the grave four days dead said brother dick ain't got that far I tell you what it changes your whole outlook on life right and you know I I tell everybody that all the time that when you when you see things like that if you know if you know God's on the scene there there's no fear there's there's no worry that's right that's right you can't worry over that you can't be sad you know we don't we don't want we don't want anybody to have to suffer but you know what it's it's part of the human condition but you know what if God's got it in control and the message letting off the pressure brother Brown talks about that lady said she is 60 years old she looked like she is 30 years old and he asked her said she had two grown sons he couldn't believe she had grown sons and said sister how do you do it he said she said when I become a Christian she said I know I can't carry my own burdens he said he was going to take my burdens said if he can't take care of it I sure can't take care of it so I ain't going to worry about it right she said iin never had a worry never had a care and it never aged her that's right so we cast our cares on him because he cares for us I thank the Lord for that little mishap today1 because that really I can't get that out of my mind it just keeps going over and over if he's the same yesterday today and forever he called his disciples if we call ourselves Christians we are his disciples that's right and if we are his disciples he gives us power over the devils and over all diseases that's right now think about that yes sir I it just keeps going through my mind I'm glad that was a mistake amen well there is no mistakes with God God just gives you the point that you that you need to make you uh you have a friend that you work with they got a baby that's got lung trouble seven month baby there's three kids on that right there the top the girl MH the man and the girl there yeah and the
