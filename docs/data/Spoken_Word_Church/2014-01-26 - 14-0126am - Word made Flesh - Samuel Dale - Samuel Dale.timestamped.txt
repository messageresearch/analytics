[17:09] John 1.
[17:15] checking to make sure I got all of my
[17:17] announcements
[17:20] John 1 1
[17:22] in the beginning was the word and the
[17:24] Word was with God and the Word was was
[17:27] God the same was in the beginning with
[17:30] God all things were made by him and
[17:32] without him without anything made that
[17:34] was made
[17:35] in him was life and the life was the
[17:37] light of men and the light shineth in
[17:40] darkness in the darkness comprehended it
[17:42] not
[17:43] there was a man sent from God whose name
[17:45] was John
[17:46] the same came for a witness to Bear
[17:48] witness of the light that all men
[17:50] through him might believe
[17:53] now my point I want you to see is and we
[17:56] won't we'll get into some of it but see
[17:58] right in the middle from where it's
[18:00] beginning the word and then the word
[18:02] becomes flesh you've got to have John
[18:05] the Baptist to come to introduce Jesus
[18:08] Christ
[18:09] all right so then in the end time when
[18:12] you would come down through
[18:14] see then you would have to have uh
[18:18] as we get over into the first John
[18:20] you've got to have another Messenger to
[18:22] come in the end time to to to be the
[18:26] point right all right so to show you
[18:29] what we're trying to fit together
[18:31] verse six there was a man sent from God
[18:33] who's whose name was John the same
[18:35] came for a witness to Bear witness of
[18:38] the light that all men through him might
[18:40] be believed he was not that light that
[18:43] was sent to Bear witness of that light
[18:46] that was the True Light which lighteth
[18:48] every man man that cometh into the world
[18:51] he was in the world and the world was
[18:53] made by him and the world knew him not
[18:55] he came into his own in his own received
[18:58] him not but as many as received him to
[19:01] them gave he power or authority you know
[19:04] the right to to become the sons of God
[19:07] even to them that believe on his name
[19:10] which were born not of blood nor of the
[19:13] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[19:16] but of God now see you're coming right
[19:18] into the bride part right okay now
[19:21] and the Word was made flesh and dwelt
[19:23] among us and we believe beheld his glory
[19:25] as the glory as of the only begotten of
[19:29] the father full of grace and truth
[19:32] now I like little John because the same
[19:34] authors writing this writes in the
[19:37] little Johns after he's coming over you
[19:40] know and bringing his message
[19:42] as he comes back from Patmos
[19:46] John 1 1. first John 1 1 that which was
[19:51] from the beginning which we have heard
[19:53] which we have seen with our eyes which
[19:55] we have looked upon in our hands have
[19:57] handled of the word of life
[19:59] for the life was manifested and we've
[20:02] seen it in by our witness and show unto
[20:05] you that eternal life which was with the
[20:07] father and was manifest unto us
[20:10] actually not just manifest or may know
[20:13] but
[20:14] come alive in them because this is John
[20:16] riding after the Holy Ghost right that
[20:19] which we have seen and heard declare we
[20:21] unto you
[20:23] that you also may have fellowship with
[20:25] us
[20:26] until our fellowship is with the father
[20:28] and with his son Jesus Christ
[20:31] and these things right we unto you that
[20:34] your joy may be full
[20:36] this then is the message
[20:39] which we have heard of him
[20:41] and declare unto you that God is light
[20:43] and in him is no Darkness at all
[20:46] if we say that we have fellowship with
[20:48] him and walk in darkness we lie and do
[20:51] not the truth but if we walk into light
[20:53] as he is in the light we have Fellowship
[20:55] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[20:58] Christ his son cleanses us from all sin
[21:01] amen you may be seated the Lord add his
[21:04] Blessing to the reading of the word
[21:09] and as I said I hope you take the point
[21:11] because
[21:12] you know reading the two different
[21:14] scriptures is covering the same thing
[21:18] is covering in the beginning was the
[21:20] word word was with God the Word was God
[21:22] and then covering him coming down to you
[21:24] and I
[21:26] and in the middle of it there's got to
[21:28] be a witness to come forth see to bring
[21:31] the message that you and I could
[21:32] comprehend it and then coming out to be
[21:36] in you and I in the end of it now also
[21:39] I'm going to try for a little while now
[21:41] and see how it works
[21:43] um
[21:44] I'm going to be reading a lot but I will
[21:47] not be putting it on the screen for you
[21:49] to read and a lot of it I maybe just be
[21:52] quoting it as we go through because I
[21:55] want to try that to see how it works uh
[21:59] sometimes reading I realized that
[22:03] the human mind
[22:06] looks and sees words and words appear
[22:09] and and sometimes your thought will be
[22:13] distracted from what I'm saying unto you
[22:16] because you'll be reading on down below
[22:19] or above and you're into a totally
[22:22] entirely different thought so I'm going
[22:25] to try that and see how it works and all
[22:28] when and uh so you just pray for me glad
[22:31] to have sister milkers brother they're
[22:33] with us good to see him
[22:36] now
[22:37] we've covered in the message on
[22:39] predestination
[22:41] a lot of the things and I did not bring
[22:44] it to a total conclusion
[22:47] of doing but I'm hoping this will make
[22:50] us to understand
[22:52] my point
[22:54] you know of of preaching the way that I
[22:58] have
[22:59] and coming down to seeing the end of all
[23:02] things
[23:03] now I was kind of thinking the other day
[23:06] about something and it was kind of funny
[23:09] the way it came out and my thoughts but
[23:11] you'd have to be in mind or you probably
[23:13] would think it's funny
[23:15] but
[23:16] you know the Bible is
[23:20] we talk about it being the word of God
[23:23] we talk about it being you know God
[23:26] revealed to us
[23:28] all right now that's exactly true
[23:31] because we believe it
[23:32] all right now but it's also revealing
[23:36] people
[23:37] you know
[23:39] down through the Bible is revealing now
[23:42] listen to what I'm talking about see
[23:45] then I thought well you know
[23:47] we have to give all the honor and glory
[23:49] to him
[23:51] because it is he that hath made us and
[23:53] not we ourselves you know whatever we
[23:56] are he has made us that all right
[24:01] if we're part of the word then he made
[24:04] us part of the word all right that's
[24:06] that should be sensible but I'm thinking
[24:09] about it and I thought well what
[24:10] percentage would be the Bible in
[24:15] relation to God
[24:16] in relation to his people or mankind
[24:22] and I thought well surely we don't want
[24:24] to give ourselves too much credit
[24:25] because uh you know that would would run
[24:29] out into the wrong area
[24:31] and uh you know that's what I see in
[24:34] some people the way they do they have
[24:36] totally forgotten God in the word
[24:39] and they just went into themselves
[24:42] you know and building themselves up all
[24:45] right and and that's to me that's not
[24:48] the point that I've always tried to do
[24:50] so I come up with this thought
[24:53] that
[24:55] the Bible then consists of in a I'll
[24:59] express it to her
[25:01] and the people will understand it uh to
[25:04] me the Bible is the revelation
[25:07] of almighty God
[25:09] all right one true and living God
[25:12] all right it's the revelation of that
[25:14] all right be in the revelation of one
[25:16] true and living God then you know it all
[25:21] the way through the words you're talking
[25:23] about God being made manifest
[25:26] no matter what age time or whatever
[25:29] throughout the Old Testament as well as
[25:31] the new you're talking about the
[25:34] manifestation of God or God made
[25:37] manifest that's the reason I read that
[25:38] in in John where it's in the beginning
[25:41] was the word and words with God and
[25:43] coming down the internet and the Word
[25:44] was made flesh and dwelt Among Us well
[25:47] see I believe that in the end time the
[25:49] word has to be made flesh again
[25:52] in The Bride of Jesus Christ all right
[25:55] now in believing that because I believe
[25:58] that's the way the prophet taught it see
[26:00] then I came up with a conclusion that
[26:03] the Bible is now you life at my doings
[26:07] but remember wait till I get through all
[26:08] right uh the Bible is 75 revealing God
[26:15] now you said when I saw one hold on to
[26:17] your point and get my get my thought and
[26:19] then all right we'll come back to it all
[26:22] be in God don't worry about it because
[26:24] that's what you know I'm doing
[26:26] but it's 75 percent of revealing God and
[26:29] 25 of revealing mankind are people the
[26:33] children of God
[26:34] all right now
[26:37] as we'll read in a little while the
[26:39] prophet says that
[26:41] that God is not complete without you and
[26:44] I
[26:45] all right because that's the way he
[26:47] chose to do it
[26:49] it's not something that we are it's what
[26:52] he chose to do so the entire Bible is
[26:55] the revelation of Jesus Christ right
[26:59] but to do that then there's going to
[27:01] have to be somebody
[27:04] on the earth that will make manifest
[27:09] that part of God that they are
[27:12] and that's what your prophet's done see
[27:14] for the day and the hour they were
[27:16] leaving they were the word made manifest
[27:18] for the time but only in a portion
[27:21] for their time none of them were the
[27:23] fullness
[27:24] but it says in Colossians 2 there that
[27:26] they're talking about Jesus Christ that
[27:28] he's the fullness of the god hit bodily
[27:30] all right when he stepped up on Earth he
[27:33] was God made manifest in his fullness
[27:36] River Jordan coming down
[27:39] Etc going all the way through it turns
[27:42] out to be almighty God all right and we
[27:45] believe that
[27:46] all right but see then
[27:50] if it was just the writing of
[27:55] or how can I say it if the Bible you say
[27:58] it's a revelation of Jesus Christ and I
[28:00] agree with you 100 now to listen
[28:03] but you know there's got to be somebody
[28:04] make manifest the parts
[28:07] where he could be the fullness
[28:10] so the Old Testament gave birth
[28:13] through those prophets right the word
[28:16] they brought gave birth to Jesus Christ
[28:22] but now each one of them had their part
[28:27] to where he could be the fullness
[28:31] because in him all things according to
[28:34] the Bible all right now so then the New
[28:37] Testament
[28:39] would be the same way as the old
[28:42] in the Old Testament they gave birth to
[28:45] Christ the lies to the Old Testament was
[28:48] who
[28:48] John the Baptist
[28:50] he
[28:51] the third coming of Elijah
[28:54] to introduce the Messiah all right
[28:57] now so then the end time
[29:01] if it would end up in the same way and I
[29:03] believe it does according to John 1 and
[29:06] first John 1 showing identically the
[29:08] same
[29:09] that
[29:12] the fullness of the word is going to be
[29:14] brought forth in the end time
[29:16] all right now in doing that then it had
[29:19] to be an Elijah come
[29:22] right
[29:23] because of Malachi 3 was John the
[29:25] Baptist
[29:27] right
[29:28] see he was the one of Isaiah 42 or what
[29:32] I believe it is in there where you know
[29:34] what's in my messenger
[29:36] he was the fulfilling of that well who's
[29:38] the fulfilling of Malachi 4.
[29:42] well there's a group down in Florida
[29:44] claims they are
[29:45] there's a group of but worries any of
[29:47] them now I'm just asking a simple
[29:48] question
[29:49] because I'm just simple everybody says
[29:51] you're so deep now I'm so simple until
[29:54] it's I'm an idiot I have a nice great
[29:57] education so you know that
[29:59] all right
[30:00] but
[30:02] there's got to be an individual bring it
[30:07] not a group of people
[30:09] because the the coming of Elijah was
[30:12] what you got Elijah
[30:14] right you've got five times in the Bible
[30:16] of the coming of Elijah
[30:18] all right you got Elijah Elisha had a
[30:21] double portion of the spirit of Elijah
[30:24] right Elijah done four Miracles check
[30:26] your Bible Elisha done eight Miracles
[30:28] all right see showing the double portion
[30:32] then you've got John the Baptist
[30:36] the spirit and the power of Elias that
[30:38] Jesus said
[30:39] all right
[30:40] see identifying him
[30:42] all right then who's Malachi 4.
[30:45] see we know that through the two
[30:47] witnesses
[30:49] to Israel to wind it all up that that
[30:52] will be Moses and Elijah
[30:54] all right there's arguing over whether
[30:56] Moses or whatever they want to make it
[30:58] Enoch or whatever but everybody even the
[31:00] scholars teach that it will be Elijah
[31:04] it will come to the Jews not the person
[31:06] of Elijah because
[31:09] John the Baptist was not the person of
[31:12] Elijah that's why when they asked him
[31:14] they asked him was he Elijah
[31:17] you remember he says no
[31:20] see because if he said he was all of it
[31:23] first off he would have been lying for
[31:25] the fact that he would have been saying
[31:27] I'm Elijah
[31:28] well that's reincarnation we don't
[31:30] believe in it
[31:31] but second off he would have been the
[31:33] fulfilling of all of the things of
[31:35] Elijah so it couldn't be all right so
[31:38] then
[31:39] looking at it see then there's got to be
[31:41] that fourth one to come forth
[31:45] to turn the hearts of the children back
[31:47] to the faith of the fathers according to
[31:49] Malachi 4. all right Jesus referred to
[31:55] here it's refers there in Matthew I
[31:57] believe it is about
[31:58] John being you know
[32:01] the Elijah
[32:03] that was to introduce the Messiah all
[32:06] right then there's got to be one in the
[32:07] end time to introduce the end time of
[32:09] all things right that's what's going to
[32:11] bring to pass the end of all thing is
[32:14] the the word of God to be revealed to
[32:16] the people all right just getting the
[32:18] point now
[32:19] because I'm talking about the Bible
[32:21] being 75 God 25 man
[32:26] all right
[32:28] see because I'm not going to make the
[32:30] Bible 50 man and 50 God
[32:34] that would not even fit where it would
[32:36] come into him being the fullness
[32:38] but if you're looking at it and seeing
[32:40] that somebody's got to make him manifest
[32:43] all right
[32:45] then he does use mankind amen
[32:49] he uses mankind to manifest himself so
[32:53] then the Bible is fully 100 God
[32:57] but mankind is used
[33:01] to bring the word for that age Moses was
[33:05] the word of the hour that he was living
[33:06] right
[33:07] Jeremiah Ezekiel
[33:10] Malachi
[33:11] all of those
[33:13] they were the word of their hour that's
[33:15] why that the enemy could not stop them
[33:19] you agree there was no way that they
[33:21] could stop them or they may wind up
[33:23] killing them
[33:25] but even the greatest of all you know of
[33:27] the killing of anybody who maybe you
[33:29] think about was Samson and those were
[33:31] just judges
[33:33] that were to come forth you know to
[33:35] judge of children of Israel and even in
[33:38] him in his death he killed more than he
[33:41] killed in all of his life
[33:43] so it's not belittling of anything but
[33:46] it's God made manifest
[33:49] all right now that's the point of what
[33:51] I'm talking about word made flesh
[33:58] because that's what it says in John 1 14
[34:00] and the Word was made flesh
[34:04] all right we know that's talking of
[34:05] Jesus Christ
[34:07] let's see the people then was to make
[34:11] manifest
[34:14] what they were
[34:16] so you can see Christ in Moses right
[34:20] you can see Moses Evan nearly even
[34:22] trying to show God a better way of doing
[34:25] something God he said if you killed him
[34:27] you got to kill me first
[34:29] you remember that
[34:31] the prophet of God said even himself he
[34:33] said I wondered about that until one day
[34:35] I seen it was Christ in Moses
[34:38] so what were all of those prophets
[34:40] Christ
[34:42] anointed ones
[34:44] all right now what is the bride of
[34:47] Christ
[34:49] that's right
[34:51] come on
[34:53] he's not she to be the Messiahs
[34:56] the little Messiahs
[34:58] are we not God made manifest in human
[35:00] flesh again
[35:02] we'll get back to it at the end of the
[35:04] message in the bride of Christ
[35:07] all right now but to do that then what I
[35:12] want us to do is look at it so does
[35:13] everybody understand now the reason I
[35:15] said 75 25.
[35:19] I don't want you to misunderstand that
[35:20] and say who thinks there's 25 of it to
[35:23] us no it's God in us it's been God in
[35:28] man it's never been man it's been God in
[35:31] man
[35:32] all right
[35:34] the brother Randall said it on Christ
[35:35] The Mystery of God's reveal
[35:38] paragraph 233
[35:40] look Christ in you makes him the center
[35:42] of the life of the revelation
[35:44] Christ in you makes him the sinner of
[35:47] the life of the Revelation all right
[35:49] Christ life in you
[35:52] makes him the center of the revelation
[35:55] all right did you get it Christ in you
[35:58] makes him the center of the Revelation
[35:59] Christ's life in you makes him the
[36:03] center of the Revelation Christ the
[36:05] Bible makes the Bible the complete
[36:07] revelation of Christ Christ in you makes
[36:09] the complete revelation of the whole
[36:12] thing
[36:13] you see what God is trying to do
[36:16] then he goes on to talk about what
[36:19] what is the new birth
[36:21] brother random it's the revelation of
[36:23] Jesus Christ personally to you or in you
[36:28] all right now
[36:30] then taking that
[36:32] we're talking about the word
[36:36] the word is being going to be made flesh
[36:39] all right my point is listen
[36:43] there has to be a word then for each age
[36:49] all right
[36:51] there's always been a word for each age
[36:55] but there's always been to someone to
[36:58] make manifest that word for each age
[37:03] all right going back to our
[37:05] predestination what we believe in
[37:07] predestination we believe the Bible
[37:09] Romans 8 surely you ought to remember
[37:12] that by now
[37:14] those who before knew he did
[37:16] predestinate it doesn't say those he
[37:18] predestinated he might have known them
[37:21] it doesn't say that it says those who he
[37:24] foreknew all right how does God
[37:26] predestinate by for knowledge
[37:31] for knowledge is first
[37:33] then predestination our destiny is to be
[37:37] determined after he had the
[37:39] foreknowledge
[37:41] so if we were in his thinking
[37:45] right
[37:47] and if we're not in his thinking we sure
[37:49] missed it all because
[37:51] according to this book of Revelations
[37:53] the lamb was slain before the foundation
[37:55] of the world and our names were written
[37:58] in that book if not never will be
[38:01] written there
[38:02] well my name was written there when I
[38:04] joined the church well that's a good
[38:05] Baptist Doctrine
[38:07] it's not the Bible
[38:08] all right see then just getting to the
[38:12] points
[38:13] driving down some little thoughts that
[38:15] we brought along the way but not to try
[38:18] to stay on it that much all right see
[38:21] then God for ordains things to take
[38:24] place
[38:25] how
[38:28] he predestinates it to take place right
[38:31] how by his foreknowledge
[38:35] he doesn't desire that anybody
[38:38] be lost
[38:41] he desires that everybody be saved and
[38:44] see to you here then you you understand
[38:46] a lot but just remember
[38:48] um brother Joe and these are on the
[38:50] internet the quotes that I'm using so
[38:52] then if I
[38:55] you should know where they're at
[38:57] but others out there it is on the
[38:59] internet to where that they can read it
[39:03] and see what it is okay all right so
[39:06] we're not leaving a loophole for
[39:08] somebody else
[39:09] trying to get down to a place to talk to
[39:13] you and I
[39:14] because I am one to believe in one thing
[39:18] I believe we're in the end time
[39:22] but if we go 15 more years what's the
[39:24] matter 20 more years 30 more years 50
[39:26] more years
[39:27] we're going to be old
[39:29] and like I told them in the fellowship
[39:31] meeting I said if we don't get out of
[39:34] here we're going to have Fellowship
[39:35] meetings in the nursing home
[39:38] because we're going to be there and some
[39:40] of you that are young are going to be
[39:42] there and maybe before we get there
[39:45] uh-huh
[39:47] Terence Sims already picked out ours
[39:50] we don't they won't tell us where it's
[39:52] at that's the secret
[39:53] you know
[39:55] maybe you're wearing a chicken house you
[39:57] know with a cow today
[39:59] all right
[40:01] but there's a word for every age
[40:04] all right now you remember the story The
[40:06] Prophet told he said
[40:08] that
[40:10] it wouldn't have been no good for
[40:12] Moses to come along
[40:15] and said okay now what we're going to do
[40:17] he said we're going to leave Egypt
[40:19] you know the words right there on the
[40:21] Nile you know right there
[40:23] I said what we'll do is we'll just build
[40:25] an ark
[40:27] and we'll float out of here
[40:31] been pretty good art for about two and a
[40:33] half million people in all their cattle
[40:35] and all the things but God could still
[40:36] do it I don't worry about that
[40:40] if they'd have been all those people
[40:42] would have been saved in the days of
[40:43] Noah you know Noah would have been 240
[40:46] years instead of 120 because he would
[40:48] have built an ark big enough to take all
[40:50] the people if
[40:51] if it was God's plan
[40:54] but we know that it didn't work out that
[40:55] way all right but see Moses couldn't say
[40:59] I'll do like Noah
[41:00] why because Moses had the word of the
[41:03] hour for the time that he was living all
[41:06] right in comparison to the Noah having
[41:10] the word for the hour that he was living
[41:13] all right but see as you come down then
[41:16] you come from there to Abraham and and
[41:19] to David and and and Solomon and and and
[41:23] on down you know Joshua and all the
[41:27] different ones each one of those
[41:31] people and the people of the hour that
[41:34] they were living right
[41:36] there was only seven more in the days of
[41:39] Noah that received the message of Noah
[41:41] now the other was probably hung around
[41:44] they probably sympathize with it or said
[41:46] as the prophet said they probably went
[41:48] up there and hung around the door and
[41:50] said come on out Noah but said just in
[41:52] case
[41:54] I'll hang around the ark a while they
[41:56] probably had good camp meetings and sit
[41:58] around there waiting but when the rain
[42:00] started they got the beaten on the ark
[42:02] but there was no way to get in all right
[42:05] but that's no matter what it is if it's
[42:07] only seven remember Enoch was the only
[42:09] one that represented the Rapture all
[42:12] right so there was only one really
[42:13] walked off the Earth in that day
[42:15] in the true word of God all right now
[42:18] then see there's been somebody
[42:23] everything you read
[42:26] we read in John
[42:28] well John witnessed this and wrote about
[42:31] it
[42:33] see that was the word of the age or the
[42:36] time are you following me so they never
[42:39] aged down through the Old Testament
[42:41] coming through the New Testament there
[42:44] has been somebody to make that word
[42:46] alive for the age that mankind was Dire
[42:50] and that word was the seed
[42:54] that we talked about
[42:56] that the prophet of God says on the the
[42:59] 154 Church age book that what it is not
[43:03] the person that comes predestinated
[43:05] eternally from God it is this word or
[43:09] seed
[43:10] all right
[43:11] see the person comes predestinated by
[43:14] foreknowledge
[43:16] because God knew who would want to be
[43:17] saved
[43:19] and who wouldn't
[43:21] all right so he could predestinate
[43:24] okay we say well I was born with this
[43:26] seed in me well
[43:28] we went through the whole series part of
[43:31] trying to express that
[43:34] that does God have to put something in
[43:37] you for you to be able to say you had
[43:39] deceived because be careful if you put
[43:42] eternal life in you and you still lost
[43:47] because Jesus Christ had to die before
[43:50] anybody could receive eternal life
[43:54] all right
[43:55] the Old Testament people had to go to
[43:58] paradise
[43:59] they could not go into heaven so that
[44:02] shows that there was no uh New Birth
[44:06] there was no eternal life for the person
[44:10] in the Old Testament because Jesus
[44:12] Christ was that life amen you agree
[44:15] see then then him throughout the
[44:16] fullness of the godhead bodily see then
[44:18] he paid the price for the old he went
[44:21] and even preached to those that were
[44:24] disobedient even into hell and preached
[44:26] to them
[44:27] but he picked up the Old Testament
[44:29] Saints and took them up
[44:31] why because they were not able to go up
[44:37] that should let anybody know that that
[44:39] the Bible says that Jesus Christ had not
[44:41] been crucified the Holy Ghost had not
[44:44] been given that scripture
[44:46] because he had not been crucified well
[44:49] brother Dale I think they had eternal
[44:50] life all the way down well
[44:53] good for you
[44:55] I don't
[44:57] I believe they had to wait on Jesus
[45:00] Christ if they had eternal life in the
[45:03] Old Testament why was they waiting on
[45:06] him
[45:08] that's right always just to get a body
[45:09] back
[45:10] he can speak all he wants to
[45:14] but we know he won't
[45:16] because we don't believe in
[45:18] we believe in Redemption of these bodies
[45:20] all right now so it's not the person
[45:25] that comes predestinated eternally
[45:29] the person comes predestinated by
[45:31] foreknowledge
[45:33] he knows what we'll do he knew what Esau
[45:35] would do he knew what Jacob would do so
[45:38] he could say Jacob have I loved Jacob
[45:41] shyster
[45:42] that was his name shyster
[45:45] you can always tricking everybody Esau
[45:48] was a good guy
[45:50] all he ever done tried to take care of
[45:51] his daddy
[45:53] but the Bible said Jacob have I loved
[45:55] Esau have I hate it why because he knew
[45:58] what they was going to do God doesn't
[46:00] predestinate my desires he desires it
[46:03] all be saved all right
[46:06] but we know everybody won't be
[46:09] so that it's our choice
[46:13] and he can look down and see what our
[46:14] choice is so then he could go ahead and
[46:17] predestinate
[46:19] but now watch he would predestinate
[46:22] where that seed would fall
[46:26] what does that say in a moment ago now
[46:29] you've got to draw out something
[46:32] and put a spot that's where everybody
[46:35] wants to do it they want these fancy
[46:36] drawings everybody's got drawings
[46:41] what I'd like for you to draw me one
[46:44] I'd like for you to draw me a drawing
[46:47] that Jesus Christ is the Lamb of God
[46:49] slain from the foundation of the world
[46:53] then draw me a drawing overlaid that
[46:56] all in one drawing to show me that he's
[46:59] the lion of the tribe of Judah
[47:06] and that he's the dove that comes down
[47:09] oh people's trying to draw that out but
[47:11] how can you put it in there
[47:16] the only way you can get
[47:19] the lamb and the lion together is what
[47:24] changed the nature of the line
[47:27] you certainly don't want to change the
[47:29] nature of the Lamb
[47:33] now
[47:36] if you understand what I'm driving at
[47:39] so Jesus Christ had to die to release
[47:41] that life that was in him
[47:43] to where anyone that could be would
[47:45] believe then could have eternal life all
[47:48] right
[47:50] so then he would look down through time
[47:55] and see even the little woman
[47:58] you know with the five husbands
[48:01] into things
[48:03] you could say there was a seed in her
[48:07] well does God have to put a spot
[48:10] for it to be some
[48:12] why not his foreknowledge
[48:19] representation what did we cover
[48:23] future home representation
[48:26] from predestination
[48:29] so the little woman was represented
[48:32] in heaven
[48:33] right by who
[48:37] by Christ
[48:39] and when the Lamb's Book of Life were
[48:41] just correctly to say the book of the
[48:44] Lamb that was slain before the
[48:45] foundation order
[48:47] to do that then
[48:51] he saw she would accept him
[48:55] but as I was saying then we want to make
[48:58] it to where it looks like she came here
[49:00] with something extra in her
[49:03] the prophet of God I didn't cover this
[49:05] through the series
[49:06] but I thought you ought to know it I
[49:08] spoke of it the prophet of God says
[49:11] everybody in the world is born with that
[49:14] faith
[49:17] you need to quote call me
[49:21] everybody everybody
[49:22] was born with a desire to serve God
[49:28] no matter what if that's not true why
[49:31] does the hot and tots
[49:34] for the Indians the eskimos or whatever
[49:37] why do they worship totem poles
[49:41] because they know there's a Creator
[49:43] because they are a creation
[49:47] and anybody's dumb enough to believe in
[49:49] evolution
[49:50] I want you to tell me where the pollywog
[49:52] comes from that's all I want to know
[49:54] they say well let's probably walk it
[49:56] done this and it doesn't have well just
[49:57] tell me where the pollywog come from
[50:01] that's all I want to know I'm not no
[50:03] problem no argument for anybody
[50:05] I just want to know where it come from
[50:08] if it didn't come from if it come from a
[50:10] germ and then a pollywalk where'd the
[50:11] germ come from we just keep going
[50:13] backwards and you can do all you want to
[50:16] but think about it now
[50:21] God predestinates by his foreknowledge
[50:25] and he could look down through and see
[50:28] everybody that would either be saved or
[50:29] lost now if you can't do that then what
[50:31] kind of a god are we talking about
[50:33] all right
[50:35] but in doing that then he would be
[50:37] watching that seed
[50:39] but does God have to put a spot
[50:42] somewhere
[50:43] does he have to put a word in you
[50:47] or does he know that you will receive it
[50:50] then all I've asked just a simple
[50:52] question
[50:54] to me simple everybody says we're born
[50:57] with this seed in us I believe what the
[50:58] prophet said I just got through
[51:00] expressing that
[51:02] the gods foreknowledge is all he needs
[51:06] all right
[51:07] but you say no no we got to have this
[51:09] thing in us well then if you had the
[51:11] thing in you
[51:12] why did you have to receive it
[51:15] and all I've ever asked is the new birth
[51:17] is it the birth and once you come into
[51:19] the world with
[51:20] or is it the birth of what you receive
[51:22] after you got here of course most people
[51:24] believe that you don't need to do birth
[51:27] you always was eternal well that ain't I
[51:30] don't know of a denomination
[51:32] that even teaches that
[51:36] so now you can see how far I believe it
[51:38] and what I'm standing on if do you know
[51:40] one denomination now you got your your
[51:43] wrong
[51:43] Mormons that believe in pre-existence
[51:45] but they still got to have an Earthly
[51:47] Journey
[51:51] they've got to have a being here
[51:56] what's wrong with us what's our problem
[51:59] but there's a word or seed predestinated
[52:04] for each age
[52:06] Noah was that Moses with that Joshua was
[52:09] that David
[52:11] Solomon Amen in all the Old Testament
[52:14] prophets and people
[52:17] but now I know I probably won't get to
[52:19] it this afternoon but if I do if not
[52:21] just remember I'll give you the quote
[52:24] for it you know that brother random call
[52:26] those Prophets
[52:28] he said the prophets are carrier
[52:38] he said the denominations are carriers
[52:45] brother Dale I don't like you good
[52:51] let you tell me those
[52:53] Prophets
[52:55] were the word no
[52:57] the word came to the prophet
[53:00] the word is Jesus Christ
[53:05] all right now we get down to where we
[53:07] solve the problem
[53:09] Mary was not
[53:11] God
[53:15] she was not even the seed
[53:22] s
[53:24] about all you want to
[53:26] she was a carrier of the seed
[53:29] the seed was in Mary
[53:32] that's what I'm concerned with I'm not
[53:34] concerned with Mary
[53:36] all right that's a long ways on down the
[53:38] road that's all right we've been through
[53:40] some of this
[53:41] but listen do you see what I'm talking
[53:42] about then
[53:44] what happens is on proving his word
[53:49] he's got to predestinate it to that age
[53:53] he does everything by the same method he
[53:56] says
[53:57] so he predestinates for that age
[54:02] in order words to have Believers to meet
[54:05] the word he's got to predestinate it to
[54:07] that age
[54:12] see Church listen
[54:13] I'm not preaching about what the method
[54:15] is worth the Baptist where the
[54:17] Presbyterian the thing
[54:19] like Wade was talking one day I believe
[54:20] you're talking about uh you know Abraham
[54:23] you know we're not Abraham
[54:25] we we read about him
[54:28] we're the Seed of Abraham yeah we read
[54:29] about him but who wants to go back to
[54:31] Abraham
[54:33] I mean you want to go home we want to go
[54:35] to tents and and living in the deserts
[54:38] oh no no no no no no no no no you're
[54:40] silly well not no you're silly
[54:44] our preaching has been done about a lot
[54:46] of people have done it about other
[54:48] people
[54:53] that's why I come up with a 75-25
[55:00] because other people are 75-25
[55:09] and I explained that didn't I
[55:12] that it's 100 God
[55:16] but mankind is used
[55:19] but the bride in the end time
[55:22] is not 75-25
[55:25] she will be 100 percent
[55:29] or there will be no rapture
[55:32] you see why that I've spent 40 something
[55:34] years screaming and hollering at you
[55:36] about the word of God instead of playing
[55:39] around with little sugar tits and all
[55:41] the words you dress you hire your
[55:43] clothes you get borned again it'll take
[55:44] care of your dress and you hire in your
[55:46] clothes
[55:46] if you don't take care of it you ain't
[55:48] born again
[55:50] any problems
[55:52] you still have trouble whether or not to
[55:54] cut your hair paint your face then get
[55:56] born again
[55:58] well I believe on okay I believe will
[56:00] you
[56:01] let me get the Holy Ghost in there and
[56:03] you can't get a holy ghost woman
[56:05] to wear pants or
[56:07] or could her higher her painter he said
[56:09] that's Bible
[56:10] that's not brother Dale or brother
[56:12] Branham
[56:13] that's Bible
[56:16] go back and read what they've done and
[56:18] how they were
[56:21] and then bring it down not throwing off
[56:23] on nobody is trying to be right
[56:25] so he predestinates the seed
[56:29] when he predestined Malachi 4
[56:32] it's got to happen
[56:36] when he predestinated Malachi 4 it's got
[56:40] to happen why because that's a
[56:42] predestinated seed
[56:47] see that's the way I believe in the seed
[56:48] being in you
[56:50] he knew that brother Branham wood want
[56:53] the word
[56:57] oh but he was born with the word in him
[56:59] were show me that in the message
[57:05] even Jesus the Bible says
[57:09] grew in Grace and knowledge
[57:14] why because he was a human element
[57:19] the outside was a human element
[57:22] inside was the god of Glory
[57:28] he didn't know everything
[57:29] wait a minute now he's gone well you
[57:32] argue with the Bible because Jesus said
[57:34] he didn't know when he's coming so you
[57:36] argue with the Bible you argue with the
[57:38] prophet don't argue with me there's no
[57:40] need of it
[57:41] I'm probably on Redemption for most
[57:43] people's ideas that's all right
[57:46] I just keep going
[57:47] because I didn't get here on account of
[57:49] you I got here on account of the word of
[57:50] God 40 something years I've been trying
[57:53] to preach the word of God to you
[57:56] and stand to this day to show me where
[57:58] I've been wrong
[58:00] if that's exalted Do What You Won't Do
[58:02] with it but I want you to show me where
[58:04] I've been wrong
[58:05] of course you talk among yourselves
[58:07] where I'm wrong
[58:11] come in my office and tell me
[58:14] I'll be glad to come out here
[58:17] and say
[58:19] I was wrong brother Donnie fabush showed
[58:22] me the truth I'll give you all the honor
[58:25] and Glory
[58:27] well I just don't well it's okay what
[58:30] about the word
[58:31] that's all I'm concerned with I ain't
[58:33] concerned with your feelings my feelings
[58:34] my family's feelings my wife my kids
[58:37] grandkids and great-grandkids I'm
[58:40] concerned with one thing
[58:41] trying to preach the Gospel of Jesus
[58:43] Christ for you and I to be saved
[58:46] and when we get on the other side we
[58:48] laugh about all this other stuff
[58:50] and we will
[58:53] I don't think we're going up to heaven
[58:56] I think we're gonna have a good time
[58:58] this is just a starting ground
[59:01] all right come on
[59:03] now we know for a certainty
[59:07] that according to the Bible
[59:09] and according to the prophet bringing
[59:11] the message to you and I
[59:14] that Jesus Christ was the fullness of
[59:17] the godhead
[59:19] bodily
[59:21] it was all resting in
[59:25] the son of God
[59:27] not God the son now because it's
[59:28] different get out of it
[59:30] he was the full manifestation of God you
[59:33] believe that
[59:35] that's what the Bible says about it so
[59:37] you know what he was
[59:40] he was
[59:43] the fullness of the word
[59:47] right
[59:50] all right
[59:51] see the prophets only pointed
[59:56] to him
[59:59] and listen
[1:00:01] they even pointed to the fullness in
[1:00:03] themselves
[1:00:06] now that you don't have to listen a
[1:00:08] little bit right
[1:00:09] and there wasn't no other word in the
[1:00:11] days of Moses
[1:00:13] Moses had it no he's pointing to the
[1:00:16] word in himself
[1:00:17] that's why he said and went down there
[1:00:19] who's going to free he said I am
[1:00:21] he said well that's just being carnal
[1:00:23] huh you go Carnival you want to
[1:00:26] God told Moses to go down there he said
[1:00:28] I'll be with you amen
[1:00:31] amen so who was it brought him out of
[1:00:32] Egypt Moses no no no it was Christ
[1:00:35] right but Moses was still used
[1:00:39] there had to be somebody to make that
[1:00:41] word alive for that day
[1:00:44] and that was all of God for that day
[1:00:49] now if you miss it when we get on
[1:00:50] through the message in the days of
[1:00:52] Martin Luther
[1:00:54] the judge shall live by faith that
[1:00:57] struck Martin Luther was the fullness of
[1:01:00] God for that hour
[1:01:01] there was no more to be brought in that
[1:01:04] day
[1:01:07] that's how I believe it
[1:01:09] that's why you can't leave them out of
[1:01:10] it
[1:01:13] even though you can call them carriers
[1:01:19] but just remember
[1:01:22] the end time bride
[1:01:25] that will eventually be the fullness
[1:01:29] starts as a carrier
[1:01:34] because you get the same Holy Ghost
[1:01:38] that fell on the day of Azusa Street
[1:01:45] no no no no no brother I got the Holy
[1:01:47] Ghost to come to well I ask you to read
[1:01:51] about four messages or listen
[1:01:53] one of them is called a masterpiece
[1:01:58] the other one is called the identified
[1:01:59] masterpiece
[1:02:02] the other one is called season not out
[1:02:04] with a shock
[1:02:08] and check those out because see you've
[1:02:09] got them in California you got them in
[1:02:11] in Jeffersonville you've got them in
[1:02:13] different places so this and I'd ask you
[1:02:16] to read
[1:02:17] the unveiling of God
[1:02:22] I'd ask you to read the Mighty God
[1:02:24] unveiled
[1:02:28] and even look at the titles
[1:02:31] read Christ is right now
[1:02:34] the mystery of God revealed
[1:02:39] who is this Mount has a deck
[1:02:44] not who was
[1:02:47] mankind didn't even know who he was
[1:02:52] that gives you a lot to read
[1:02:55] but why not
[1:02:57] I thought we believed the word
[1:03:01] I mean you you got a little time
[1:03:04] oh you're riding down the road just put
[1:03:06] Masterpiece in and listen to it
[1:03:10] you know
[1:03:12] I mean you got a little time at home
[1:03:14] what's wrong we're sitting down and
[1:03:16] listen to tape
[1:03:20] might wind up be like my neighbor there
[1:03:21] he said
[1:03:24] he said we'd always be a bird little boy
[1:03:26] in our neighbor's boy because he ain't a
[1:03:29] boy now
[1:03:30] you know the kids and always waiting him
[1:03:31] he said we'd be up at the house playing
[1:03:33] with Wade and him and said
[1:03:35] that man being there preaching all the
[1:03:37] time
[1:03:40] he wasn't making no light of it you know
[1:03:43] he just said that man being there
[1:03:44] preaching all the time
[1:03:46] well that's pretty good testimony
[1:03:53] but if you would just listen to
[1:03:54] masterpiece
[1:03:58] listen to see not out with a shock
[1:04:01] the identified masterpiece
[1:04:05] just listen to those
[1:04:07] and you'll hear everything that I'm
[1:04:09] talking about
[1:04:11] but look
[1:04:13] the prophets being the word for the hour
[1:04:16] they were living
[1:04:19] right
[1:04:22] go see God spoke it let me put it this
[1:04:25] way
[1:04:27] Moses
[1:04:28] interpreted it
[1:04:32] well then you turn back around and see
[1:04:34] that no man can interpret so it must
[1:04:36] have been Christ in Moses
[1:04:39] because Moses couldn't understood the
[1:04:41] Ten Commandments even though he was
[1:04:42] giving them the right
[1:04:44] but it was Christ in him
[1:04:46] to interpret to mankind
[1:04:51] had they listened to what Moses was
[1:04:53] saying they were not wound up with so
[1:04:55] many Book of Rules that they had to live
[1:04:58] by
[1:05:00] because it was never meant to be a book
[1:05:01] of rude it was meant to be a revelation
[1:05:03] of Jesus Christ
[1:05:04] all right
[1:05:06] We Believe or to believe these things
[1:05:08] without any problem
[1:05:10] that he was the fullness of the word
[1:05:13] Jesus Christ was the fullness of the
[1:05:15] word that in him would dwell all the
[1:05:17] fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:05:19] so then words or any second person third
[1:05:22] person
[1:05:24] and then when he comes on over there in
[1:05:26] the scriptures after his resurrection
[1:05:28] and what does he say
[1:05:30] he said all power is given unto me in
[1:05:33] heaven and in Earth
[1:05:35] well where's the power of the father
[1:05:37] where's the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:05:41] that's why we believe in one truth
[1:05:42] Living God
[1:05:45] if he was the fullness of the godhead
[1:05:47] bodily that means all of God would dwell
[1:05:49] in him
[1:05:51] all right now we won't get to it this
[1:05:54] morning but remember all that God was he
[1:05:57] poured into Christ
[1:05:58] right
[1:06:00] and all that Christ was where's he
[1:06:01] poured
[1:06:02] into the bride
[1:06:05] the church
[1:06:07] all right
[1:06:09] what you see he was then
[1:06:12] wisdom versus faith
[1:06:14] he was the predestinated word
[1:06:19] he was the predestinated word
[1:06:23] all right
[1:06:25] all of those pointed towards him
[1:06:28] he was the person of God that was to
[1:06:31] stand in that day
[1:06:34] to be the sacrifice for sin
[1:06:46] to fulfill the scripture and then he
[1:06:49] could say
[1:06:51] Philip said or which one was it one of
[1:06:53] them said show us the father
[1:06:55] he said have I been so long with you
[1:06:58] said if you've seen me you're saying the
[1:07:00] father
[1:07:03] well maybe in a what
[1:07:05] see
[1:07:07] that's where we reasoned it come up with
[1:07:09] a trinity
[1:07:12] and see it won't work or a garden tree
[1:07:15] person's Trinity
[1:07:17] all right
[1:07:18] but now if we believe that he was the
[1:07:21] person of God
[1:07:24] you remember the statement
[1:07:27] he's not the first he's not just third
[1:07:29] person second person he's not even the
[1:07:32] first person
[1:07:34] he is the person
[1:07:36] because if he's the first person that
[1:07:37] could be two or three more or a hundred
[1:07:39] more
[1:07:40] but if he is the person
[1:07:44] then they can't be no more than that
[1:07:45] because if you look in the Bible because
[1:07:46] I remember I knew that in the Baptist
[1:07:48] Church I I I wouldn't educate it but I
[1:07:51] could read sensibly you know they called
[1:07:53] him John the Baptist
[1:07:56] this is
[1:07:57] right that's what it says John the
[1:08:01] Baptist well I told the Baptist the
[1:08:03] Deacon is the preacher of the people
[1:08:06] you know
[1:08:08] well we're Baptist called John was a
[1:08:10] Baptist
[1:08:12] well
[1:08:13] first off I'd put you under the law
[1:08:15] because that's where he was at
[1:08:18] right
[1:08:20] Jesus Christ hadn't come he introduced
[1:08:22] you I said second off the word v means
[1:08:25] singular
[1:08:28] because it can't be no more Baptists
[1:08:33] you know what I'm saying
[1:08:35] John be Baptist means there's just one
[1:08:37] of them
[1:08:38] singular
[1:08:41] all right he was the fullness he was the
[1:08:44] person of God
[1:08:45] all right
[1:08:48] he's the spiritual Kingdom over the
[1:08:50] spirits that's in US
[1:08:55] future home
[1:08:57] because we were in him at the beginning
[1:09:03] God in the beginning when he thought of
[1:09:05] you and thought of others like that
[1:09:07] thought of himself of being tangible
[1:09:09] that was his thoughts so he expressed
[1:09:12] his thoughts by word he said let there
[1:09:14] be let there be
[1:09:16] and there was
[1:09:24] we were a part of him in the beginning
[1:09:28] what part of us was there
[1:09:31] are we Mormons
[1:09:32] that believe in pre-existence of Souls
[1:09:35] do we believe in transmigration or souls
[1:09:38] or reincarnation or so go 154 Church
[1:09:42] 152 I think it's in the church a book he
[1:09:45] said I don't believe in that more yes
[1:09:46] 154. I don't believe in that Mormon
[1:09:48] doctrine of pre-existence well that
[1:09:50] didn't mean he didn't and like a brother
[1:09:51] said one day he said he didn't say he
[1:09:53] didn't believe in some form I said amen
[1:09:55] he believed in some form
[1:09:57] of pre-existence I do too I believe
[1:10:00] Jesus Christ pre-existed
[1:10:03] because he was on my
[1:10:05] Almighty not the human flesh
[1:10:09] the one that was in the flesh
[1:10:10] pre-existed
[1:10:12] because he's the only one that could
[1:10:13] pre-exist
[1:10:15] and if his name is Elohim which is what
[1:10:17] it was meaning self-existing
[1:10:21] then we would not be back there as
[1:10:23] people
[1:10:25] we were only in his thoughts
[1:10:30] we were attributes a part of him why
[1:10:33] because when he died I died with him
[1:10:39] right
[1:10:40] when he went to hell I went to hell with
[1:10:43] him right
[1:10:44] because I was in him now it's out of
[1:10:47] that you you got a problem right
[1:10:49] but now listen
[1:10:54] God
[1:10:57] knew what he would do
[1:11:00] the prophet said it on Christ is
[1:11:02] revealing his own word that we were in
[1:11:04] him in germ form
[1:11:08] you remember that through the series
[1:11:11] the prophet deals with genes he deals
[1:11:13] with germs he deals with seed
[1:11:18] a gene is not a germ a germ is not a
[1:11:20] seed
[1:11:24] a seed takes
[1:11:27] egg and sperm to be a seed
[1:11:31] right
[1:11:34] the words got to be germinated
[1:11:36] all right
[1:11:37] when he was crucified we was crucified
[1:11:40] in his body when he rose from the dead
[1:11:42] we rose with him and now since we have
[1:11:45] recognized it now we sit together with
[1:11:47] him in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus
[1:11:49] Christ revealing his own word then we
[1:11:51] were in him from the beginning and when
[1:11:53] Jesus became the word then we were part
[1:11:56] of him then
[1:11:57] there you are when that's in there there
[1:12:00] is no devil no powers no nothing can
[1:12:05] ever move it
[1:12:06] that's the post of the Soul
[1:12:10] and when it comes to that top host it's
[1:12:12] tied to the word
[1:12:17] why is it the people of this message are
[1:12:18] so flip-floppy
[1:12:21] somebody come along with a new doctor
[1:12:22] and everybody runs to it
[1:12:27] come on
[1:12:28] 40 something years
[1:12:31] I was thinking the other day about it
[1:12:32] you know us it's been around a while
[1:12:34] we'd be good historians
[1:12:39] right
[1:12:41] you know what a historian does
[1:12:43] a historian can tell you about history
[1:12:47] well you know most of his history is not
[1:12:49] experienced
[1:12:50] it's reading what somebody else say it
[1:12:52] so he becomes a historian but we're
[1:12:54] historians by being historians
[1:12:57] we lived it Danny
[1:13:01] we've been here brother collie
[1:13:03] we've seen all the doctrines come and go
[1:13:07] we've seen the people be led astray
[1:13:11] to even people that brother random call
[1:13:14] their names
[1:13:16] Go off into
[1:13:18] false doctrines or like it is now trying
[1:13:21] to prove them wrong in every which way
[1:13:27] you know if you're back there the same
[1:13:28] old people is down here trying to prove
[1:13:29] him wrong if you're back there with
[1:13:31] Jesus you know which side you'd be on
[1:13:38] why that Jesus he got mad he got planted
[1:13:41] them ropes and he went in that Temple
[1:13:43] and he beat them out of there
[1:13:48] like I had one brother to tell me he
[1:13:50] said
[1:13:51] well he said I don't believe he beat the
[1:13:53] people he said he beat the animals I
[1:13:55] said you're worse than ever
[1:13:58] what the animal got to do with the
[1:13:59] people put him in there
[1:14:02] right
[1:14:04] I'm sorry
[1:14:06] but ain't that sensible
[1:14:08] he's beating the people
[1:14:12] when he turned around and died on the
[1:14:13] cross for him now you explain that one
[1:14:19] you do it that way you start out to beat
[1:14:21] the people
[1:14:22] and you know you ain't gonna beat them
[1:14:24] right
[1:14:29] and listen
[1:14:33] brother said lean not to your own
[1:14:34] understanding
[1:14:36] 65.
[1:14:38] and God listen
[1:14:40] and the only way you can be a Son of God
[1:14:42] or a daughter of God you had to be a
[1:14:46] part of God and what and God isn't
[1:14:51] complete
[1:14:52] without you
[1:14:57] if you have a part of God in you
[1:15:00] by the new birth and that's what it's
[1:15:02] supposed to be right
[1:15:03] it's supposed to be Christ in you the
[1:15:04] hope of glory
[1:15:06] amen supposed to be the person of Jesus
[1:15:07] Christ Living in you that Paul said it's
[1:15:09] not I that liveth
[1:15:11] what
[1:15:13] but I live by the one that's inside of
[1:15:15] me
[1:15:15] all right
[1:15:17] he said but that's just making it too
[1:15:19] much what
[1:15:22] get that Catholic Doctrine out of your
[1:15:24] mind
[1:15:26] get with the word
[1:15:31] remember they said that to Jesus he said
[1:15:33] well
[1:15:34] you know the prophets were God
[1:15:37] and said
[1:15:38] they spoke of the sons of God
[1:15:41] and if I say I'm a son of God
[1:15:45] now who gives you the right say I'm not
[1:15:48] now if I go out and live like the devil
[1:15:50] you got a right to say that period right
[1:15:52] come on
[1:15:53] but God isn't complete without you you
[1:15:55] know why because there's only one
[1:15:57] resource of eternal life and that is God
[1:16:00] and God alone has eternal life now you
[1:16:04] were a part of him and so much that
[1:16:05] you're an attribute or in his thinking
[1:16:08] in the beginning that because he thought
[1:16:10] of you in the beginning it gives that
[1:16:13] little tug towards him
[1:16:15] can I say tug
[1:16:17] can I say seed get a safe spot
[1:16:22] and it be saying the same thing
[1:16:26] a little tug to him what
[1:16:29] a representation from predestination
[1:16:34] if I have eternal life today if you have
[1:16:38] eternal life I put it back in your
[1:16:39] pocket
[1:16:41] if you have eternal life that eternal
[1:16:43] life always was eternal
[1:16:45] you can't have a beginning of eternal
[1:16:47] life
[1:16:49] come on get out of Catholicism
[1:16:52] okay
[1:16:55] gives a little tug toward him that's
[1:16:58] what has to be quickened
[1:17:01] some of them will never be quickened
[1:17:04] they just don't have it
[1:17:07] some will never be quick and why because
[1:17:08] they reject
[1:17:15] for some reason
[1:17:17] and the biggest reason is the preachers
[1:17:19] why did the prophet say the little woman
[1:17:21] there one of them was prostitute or one
[1:17:24] to them
[1:17:25] he said she's seen so much religion
[1:17:28] until she turned to prostitution
[1:17:36] religious in the preachers
[1:17:41] you know what
[1:17:44] you get Tales of these preachers you
[1:17:46] know in their polygamist ideas you know
[1:17:49] what they're still welcomed
[1:17:52] when a man with a word ain't welcome to
[1:17:53] come in the churches and preach but
[1:17:56] those who are polygamists in everything
[1:17:57] in the world
[1:17:59] bigamist higamus and what Commission or
[1:18:02] anything else
[1:18:03] they're welcomed they're Brothers
[1:18:08] or somebody standing true with the word
[1:18:10] of God is not even welcomed
[1:18:14] one of these days I'll get back to
[1:18:15] preach about the faithful Ministry and
[1:18:18] what they are because I believe if the
[1:18:20] prophet taught the five-fold ministry is
[1:18:22] predestinated
[1:18:27] now that don't mean everybody that says
[1:18:30] they're a preacher is a preacher
[1:18:33] it's the ones that's predestinated
[1:18:36] they're the preachers all right listen
[1:18:42] God of this evil age I died with him for
[1:18:45] I was him in him then
[1:18:49] the whole godhead bodily shaped up in
[1:18:52] the person of Jesus Christ
[1:18:54] and when Jesus Christ died at the cross
[1:18:56] I died with him for I was in him then
[1:19:00] for he is the fullness of the word
[1:19:02] manifested
[1:19:04] knowing that we would be manifested
[1:19:08] later
[1:19:11] you hold on to that one
[1:19:14] God of this evil age paragraph
[1:19:16] 67-68
[1:19:21] knowing that we would be may be
[1:19:23] manifested later and we was at Calvary
[1:19:25] with him we went into grave with him and
[1:19:28] we raised with him
[1:19:30] and his resurrection and now we're
[1:19:32] ascended by his holy spirit to the
[1:19:35] throne of grace sitting together in
[1:19:37] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now we
[1:19:39] know we was not there physically so
[1:19:42] what's he talking about
[1:19:47] if he was the fullness of the word you
[1:19:49] agreed that while ago now come on so now
[1:19:51] let's see if you agree with it
[1:19:53] he was the fullness of the word that
[1:19:55] meant all the word was in him that means
[1:19:57] if we got anything to be made enough
[1:19:58] visited it was in him if David had
[1:20:00] anything to be made manifested Moses
[1:20:02] Noah it was in him
[1:20:04] right
[1:20:07] all we got to do is just get out
[1:20:11] I really love that scripture I wonder
[1:20:14] how many people even know what it said
[1:20:15] he says I in you
[1:20:18] right that's easy to understand
[1:20:21] right
[1:20:23] I in you that's the new birth right he
[1:20:26] comes down to Elton unit but what about
[1:20:28] the next part of that scripture I in you
[1:20:31] and you in me now that's what Jesus said
[1:20:36] so you argue with him about it
[1:20:38] so I was in him on the shores of Galilee
[1:20:40] but you know what I was there when Moses
[1:20:42] crossed the Red Sea
[1:20:45] but you know where I was at too I was
[1:20:47] with George Washington when he crossed
[1:20:48] to Delaware
[1:20:53] in the same quote
[1:20:59] come on
[1:21:03] because he was the fullness of the word
[1:21:07] spoken words original seat back at 420.
[1:21:10] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[1:21:12] anything until sin of the father
[1:21:15] or the father showed him first now is
[1:21:16] that scripture
[1:21:18] did Jesus say that he said I do nothing
[1:21:20] until the father shows me
[1:21:22] now is that Bible okay now listen
[1:21:25] notice what Harmony Jesus never did
[1:21:27] anything until scene of the father or
[1:21:30] the father showed him first
[1:21:31] Harmony between God and Christ see
[1:21:34] John 5 19. so will the bride and he
[1:21:39] shows her his Word of Life
[1:21:42] he shows her and she receives it
[1:21:46] she never doubts it nothing can harm her
[1:21:48] not even death for if the seed be
[1:21:51] planted the water will raise it up again
[1:21:53] amen then I got a great big Hallelujah
[1:21:56] here is the secret well listen
[1:21:59] the word is in the bride
[1:22:02] and the mind of Christ
[1:22:05] come on what is the mind of Christ
[1:22:07] baptism when the Holy Ghost right to
[1:22:09] know what he wants done with a word and
[1:22:12] she does it
[1:22:13] in his name
[1:22:15] she has thus saith the Lord
[1:22:17] and it's germatized so the Holy Spirit
[1:22:19] watches Waters in until it's grown and
[1:22:22] serves its purpose
[1:22:26] they do only his will
[1:22:29] no one can persuade them different they
[1:22:31] have thus saith the Lord or they keep
[1:22:33] still

[1:22:58] going to do you didn't ask me what you
[1:23:00] want to do what I wanted to be done you
[1:23:02] didn't ask me what the word said

[1:23:05] I'm just brother collie okay I'll argue
[1:23:08] with him
[1:23:15] you see the point of what I'm trying to
[1:23:17] get at
[1:23:20] all right
[1:23:25] think about it

[1:23:34] what do you think about it goodbye
[1:23:40] you just told me you felt like it
[1:23:42] but when you felt like it you walked out
[1:23:43] when you felt like it
[1:23:46] your body's just hanging around
[1:23:48] right and you're in the way
[1:23:53] if nothing else we need the seats for
[1:23:55] the devil to sit on

[1:24:08] but is it the truth
[1:24:10] have I become your enemy because I tell
[1:24:13] you the truth
[1:24:14] I feel like I'm just going to go over
[1:24:16] here to this church amen so long I ain't
[1:24:19] never told nobody not to go nowhere and
[1:24:21] ain't never told nobody that's lost
[1:24:23] cause it went
[1:24:25] show me on the tapes they're here from
[1:24:27] 82 up to now anyway
[1:24:31] and I got the notes from their back
[1:24:35] the
[1:24:38] that's your choice to where you go to
[1:24:40] church
[1:24:42] it's not my choice but when you tell me
[1:24:45] you're planning on doing why you're
[1:24:46] going to tell me that
[1:24:47] why don't you just wave goodbye and say
[1:24:49] brother Dale I'm leaving
[1:24:52] okay
[1:24:57] listen
[1:24:58] there is a word according to the
[1:25:00] unveiling of God paragraph 129.
[1:25:03] there is a word for each age
[1:25:06] and Moses come forth his face shined the
[1:25:10] word was in him ready to be manifested
[1:25:12] give out to the people
[1:25:16] do you see it
[1:25:18] wherever the word is
[1:25:21] it's veiled
[1:25:26] the word has always been veiled
[1:25:29] it's veiled right now do you think the
[1:25:31] world can see the word
[1:25:33] now come on Jared
[1:25:37] I can read it every day
[1:25:40] you and I read it
[1:25:43] but we got a trinity out of it
[1:25:48] right
[1:25:52] but see there's a word for each age
[1:25:57] and there's got there's it's veiled
[1:26:03] Moses walked out there he had to put a
[1:26:05] veil over his face it was so spiritually
[1:26:08] as we'd call it in the presence of
[1:26:10] almighty God
[1:26:12] his face glowed
[1:26:15] and they couldn't stand to look at him
[1:26:19] but you know what
[1:26:20] one day that was no longer on his face
[1:26:22] anymore
[1:26:24] right oh they were scared while it's on
[1:26:27] his face oh we wouldn't dare do anything
[1:26:29] Moses we went there too
[1:26:33] but today that light was off of his face
[1:26:35] did Moses change
[1:26:39] and here come ahold of preachers around
[1:26:41] right
[1:26:43] about 250 of them I remember one time
[1:26:47] no dathan and core I believe was the
[1:26:49] ones that said it though in one
[1:26:51] situation
[1:26:52] Moses you take too much upon yourself
[1:26:54] we're all spiritual they wouldn't adire
[1:26:58] said that when that Halo was over his
[1:27:00] face
[1:27:04] they wouldn't have died say what they're
[1:27:07] saying today brother random while he was
[1:27:09] alive
[1:27:12] right 300 preachers one time
[1:27:16] when he preached on water baptism in the
[1:27:18] name of the Lord Jesus Christ when they
[1:27:19] challenged him on it
[1:27:23] in 300 preachers
[1:27:25] names that we could call
[1:27:29] we want the tapes we're going to send it
[1:27:31] everywhere why because it was right
[1:27:32] there in his presence
[1:27:34] but after then he said not one of them
[1:27:37] come back
[1:27:43] you see that's the way it is and I know
[1:27:44] even for my own personal experience
[1:27:47] I want to see somebody stand in front of
[1:27:49] my face and call me a liar about
[1:27:51] something
[1:27:52] because I'm going to look you dead in
[1:27:53] the eye
[1:27:54] and I'm going to say I can prove you're
[1:27:56] wrong
[1:27:59] brother Dale you said so and so the
[1:28:01] other day you will get the tape and
[1:28:02] we'll listen to it
[1:28:04] then if I didn't say it you're the liar
[1:28:06] then what are you going to do about it
[1:28:09] if I said it then I can show you in
[1:28:11] there that I made of a human mistake
[1:28:16] what you see people won't stand in front
[1:28:18] of the word
[1:28:20] why is it what's wrong with it today but
[1:28:23] the prophet said I'll be glad when the
[1:28:25] church comes to the place that she'll
[1:28:26] say Paul didn't say that
[1:28:30] but brother Dale that's their that's
[1:28:33] their opinion you're just against
[1:28:35] everybody no I'm not
[1:28:40] I'm against sin in you and me and the
[1:28:44] sin I'm against is unbelief
[1:28:47] if you're committing adultery if you're
[1:28:49] out running around gambling smoking and
[1:28:51] doing all of these things
[1:28:54] you better believe one thing for sure
[1:28:57] you're not getting by with it
[1:28:59] God's got a record I don't have to
[1:29:02] preach on it for you to see that it's
[1:29:03] wrong
[1:29:05] go to write them on Daniel 70 weeks says
[1:29:07] we know polygamy is wrong you don't need
[1:29:11] somebody to tell you he said right well
[1:29:14] yet they're Brothers
[1:29:18] Hey Brother so-and-so he's completely
[1:29:20] but did you hear what he's saying
[1:29:22] yeah dumb donkey talked a lot of times
[1:29:24] too
[1:29:26] let me hurry
[1:29:28] Feast of the trumpets
[1:29:31] and each age has allotted the word for
[1:29:35] each age
[1:29:37] that would be on the Earth
[1:29:39] he loted it in the church ages and the
[1:29:42] Seven Seals revealed every bit of it
[1:29:49] look where he's tying it to
[1:29:53] let me get one more then we'll pick
[1:29:54] these up his season because I got too
[1:29:56] many more left
[1:29:57] man here they are just turn on the
[1:29:59] lights reaching 64.
[1:30:02] each age God has lauded so much of his
[1:30:05] word for each age and he always sends
[1:30:08] somebody to manifest
[1:30:10] that word
[1:30:13] we'll take it right there this afternoon
[1:30:16] they won't have to use the 30-something
[1:30:18] quotes I got for the next message
[1:30:20] we'll still be on this
[1:30:23] but do you understand what I'm talking
[1:30:24] about church
[1:30:27] just trying to preach instead of maybe
[1:30:29] me read some but not you look at it
[1:30:31] because I realize the human mind you're
[1:30:34] going up and down the screen and you're
[1:30:35] seeing it and you're down here reading
[1:30:37] at the bottom because it's highlighted
[1:30:40] and you're not listening to what I'm
[1:30:41] saying
[1:30:43] I know you're not because I talk to you
[1:30:46] well I didn't know you said that
[1:30:53] I'm sorry
[1:30:55] but I'm not sorry for the word that I've
[1:30:57] tried to preach
[1:30:59] and that way that I've tried to bring it
[1:31:01] may be a problem
[1:31:03] but that dumb donkey tell you the truth
[1:31:05] you've got to listen to the Donkey
[1:31:11] see I've just tried to be honest and
[1:31:12] straight as I can to talk to you about
[1:31:14] it because I believe in predestination
[1:31:16] yes
[1:31:17] I believe in a predestinated seed that
[1:31:20] comes predestinated eternally from God
[1:31:25] and I believe that it lands in certain
[1:31:27] people and they make that seed manifest
[1:31:31] but do you have to put spots and spats
[1:31:34] and this and that
[1:31:40] those are terminologies to express
[1:31:43] not trying to show a better way that he
[1:31:46] should have said it this way I didn't
[1:31:47] say that
[1:31:49] he said it the only way that the Holy
[1:31:52] Spirit won't it say it
[1:31:54] you know I brought around and said a lot
[1:31:56] of things the way he said it because the
[1:31:58] holy spirit said say it
[1:32:01] you know why because that way people
[1:32:04] could twist it any way they wanted to
[1:32:11] I've asked you to do one thing
[1:32:14] go to the questions and answers from
[1:32:16] conduct order and Doctrine
[1:32:19] and read the questions
[1:32:21] that were asked to profit
[1:32:25] some of those things it was asked when
[1:32:28] he finished you knew no more about what
[1:32:31] was said than you did to start with
[1:32:34] let's get to go do it
[1:32:38] because the whole
[1:32:46] it was said one time about him said you
[1:32:48] told this group of people this and you
[1:32:50] told that that he said I told them what
[1:32:51] they wanted to hear
[1:32:56] he didn't say thus saith the Lord he
[1:32:58] said I just told him what they wanted to
[1:32:59] hear
[1:33:04] as a matter of fact I think it was tied
[1:33:05] to
[1:33:06] to
[1:33:09] childbearing
[1:33:12] you see one coming up and said the
[1:33:13] doctor told my wife for not to have no
[1:33:16] more kids
[1:33:18] okay
[1:33:22] and that's what they told us
[1:33:26] we would have never had but one child
[1:33:30] period
[1:33:31] there was a doctors that was their proof
[1:33:34] there was nothing back there in in those
[1:33:35] days when weighed 54 years old today I
[1:33:38] called and told him happy birthday
[1:33:39] 54 years ago they didn't have all these
[1:33:42] fields and drugs that they got today my
[1:33:44] wife had the Rh factor in her blood and
[1:33:46] I my blood was a positive
[1:33:49] and it wouldn't match
[1:33:51] Wade and Terence both had the yellow
[1:33:53] John to effect which come from that
[1:33:57] they told us never to have but one child
[1:33:59] that it could be anything from now on
[1:34:02] any deformity whatsoever we had a exact
[1:34:05] right by the prophet to say we're not
[1:34:07] going to have any more
[1:34:11] Terence bye
[1:34:13] you didn't get here Anna
[1:34:17] but see we believe God
[1:34:19] and we prayed
[1:34:22] that's why there's five years between
[1:34:23] Wade and Terence there's nine years
[1:34:26] between Terence and Anna
[1:34:28] you ever take a little bit as close to
[1:34:30] those ages
[1:34:33] when the second one come along they said
[1:34:35] don't have no more
[1:34:42] that it could be anything in the world
[1:34:45] when I've told you what happened
[1:34:51] Layton Terrence both was born before we
[1:34:53] come in the message
[1:34:55] and it was born after we come in the
[1:34:57] message
[1:34:58] we begin to see what it was to believe
[1:35:00] by faith
[1:35:05] so when Anna become I mean when Nanny
[1:35:07] become expecting
[1:35:08] she went to the doctor and you've heard
[1:35:10] the story
[1:35:11] the doctor says
[1:35:13] get your husband to go and see exactly
[1:35:15] where the blood count is at
[1:35:17] it's you're a negative with a r error
[1:35:20] negative with an RH on it and said he's
[1:35:22] positive so I go over they run the test
[1:35:25] go back to the doctor she does got a new
[1:35:27] doctor happened to be in that day you
[1:35:29] know assistant he said oh how wonderful
[1:35:31] said you're a negative said your husband
[1:35:34] is that is negative
[1:35:38] RH hers with rhs9 was negative
[1:35:42] she said you better go back and check
[1:35:43] your records because my husband was
[1:35:46] tested twice by you and it's positive he
[1:35:50] went in there and he come back he said
[1:35:51] they made a mistake
[1:35:54] said go over there and do it again I
[1:35:56] went back and they done it again
[1:35:57] come back and they said we don't know
[1:35:59] what happened but now you are a negative
[1:36:03] I gave gallon pins at General Motors
[1:36:05] under a positive
[1:36:08] but now my blood is A negative
[1:36:10] why because God changed the same
[1:36:14] because Anna was to come
[1:36:19] right
[1:36:22] can I quote a little bit without being
[1:36:24] up
[1:36:25] hateful in my wife taking it the wrong
[1:36:27] way you know what rode around and said
[1:36:28] he said if there's a seed to come
[1:36:30] through you and your wife won't have it
[1:36:35] that's paraphrasing the quote but it's
[1:36:37] close enough
[1:36:41] it don't mean you can go out and
[1:36:42] adultery and bring it
[1:36:44] that might be why a lot of women passed
[1:36:46] off the scene too quick
[1:36:49] Do What You Won't Do I'm quoting your
[1:36:52] prophet
[1:36:56] but you see
[1:36:57] Anna wound up to be healthy she was the
[1:36:59] only one out of the three that didn't
[1:37:00] have the other effect come on musician
[1:37:03] she didn't have the other fact why
[1:37:05] because the blood was a total match you
[1:37:08] tell me that's medically impossible I
[1:37:10] say Amen
[1:37:12] your blood can't change
[1:37:16] and a nurse come walking down right
[1:37:18] there ask her
[1:37:20] is it medically possible to go from a
[1:37:23] positive to a negative
[1:37:29] what you see
[1:37:31] I just happen to believe
[1:37:34] and you know what we was praying
[1:37:36] see we didn't get in all this where you
[1:37:38] could find out what the kids are going
[1:37:39] to be you know Dad got up that far yet
[1:37:41] of course we couldn't afford it to run
[1:37:43] the test but
[1:37:46] so when it wound up
[1:37:48] had a little girl
[1:37:53] she weighed 10 pounds
[1:37:56] my wife had done had one ten pound boy
[1:37:58] that was Terence
[1:37:59] two ounces weight was nine pound 13
[1:38:02] ounces
[1:38:03] and when I went in there and told her
[1:38:05] she said we got another boy
[1:38:09] I said honey and the boy's a girl
[1:38:12] she said I don't
[1:38:14] know of course she was in and out you
[1:38:15] know how he had a little shot day I
[1:38:18] don't believe it you know what I done I
[1:38:20] said nurse go get the baby
[1:38:24] I said pull the clothes off the baby
[1:38:30] well yeah
[1:38:34] what you see
[1:38:37] he'd already told me
[1:38:42] saw a little boy about that size
[1:38:45] they would have Brew the most
[1:38:50] saw a little girl about that size
[1:38:53] a long black hair

[1:38:59] well you know what
[1:39:01] brother Moulton him had a little boy and
[1:39:03] his name's Forest
[1:39:05] and him and Anna's pretty close at the
[1:39:07] same age I don't know exactly but
[1:39:10] and we had the little girl
[1:39:12] see we couldn't have had no boys we
[1:39:14] could have had too many boys in between
[1:39:15] maybe but it meant for that little girl
[1:39:18] to come
[1:39:20] I'm a firm believer in predestination
[1:39:25] but he showed me before they overcome
[1:39:27] what they'd be
[1:39:31] why do we worry about it when God didn't
