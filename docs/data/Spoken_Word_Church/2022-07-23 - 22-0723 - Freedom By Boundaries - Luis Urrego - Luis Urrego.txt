from a young person a couple weeks ago i was at byc for the first time and i experienced a lot of things a lot of different things but so we were in our dorms all the girls and each night we'd have a devotional and one of the times we were told to write on a piece of paper something that we wanted to get rid of our lives whether it was feelings or physical things and um we weren't supposed to tell anybody but later that day we had a bonfire and we had threw him in the fire um and personally for me i wasn't supposed to tell anyone but because it was so special i had to share with the counselor the next day for our next devotion she wrote on a piece of paper for everybody that were good enough and she handed it to all of us and i just thought it was so special how the day before that the one thing i had wrote is never feeling good enough because that's something i've struggled with a long time and the fact that she wrote that like it could have been anything and i just thought that was that was god's way of telling me that i'm enough so if anybody's feeling that we just know it's a lie because you are enough [Applause] so we have uh three three new specialists so that's wonderful we have plenty of time if there's more that's great but right now we'll have with aaron and sister sarah come up and after them will be sister christine is even the lord said paul my son i need you to

amen because he's mighty mighty indeed we appreciate each and every one of you thank you for your patience and thanks to all the musicians thanks yes thanks to all that have worked hard brother isaac

brother wade appreciate brother dale appreciate nanny thank you all for allowing this opportunity amen praise god amen we just most of all we just thank god for the opportunity that he gives us amen we're going to go ahead and go to the lord to the word this this afternoon i'll do my best to not keep you too long so but um we want to go to the book of colossians if you have your bibles the book of colossians chapter 3 and we're just going to read one verse there actually uh we'll read the first first three verses there colossians 3 verse 1 praise the lord the bible says if you then be risen with christ if you are risen with christ in other words if you are alive man seek those things which are above the thing is is that when you are alive and when you are risen in christ you will want to seek those things that are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of where's to set your affection on things above amen what is the word affection the word affection is something that you love dearly something that that that you hold dear to your heart and that is very very special to you so paul here is telling us set your affection that thing that you really love what is that thing that you really love in your life right now many of us may have different things some some of us may like to garden man that's an affection that you have for gardening some of us like collecting shoes i have a brother-in-law who used to like doing that up in canada he collected shoes had all kinds of shoes they know what to do with them so you started giving me some of them i got some penny hard ways up there i don't even use them uh not penny harvey kobe bryant's it might be worth some money but uh yeah that might be their your affection you some some some people's affection are collecting video games you know some people's affection different things but paul here is telling us set your affection on things above amen in other words it's beyond anything else in this world it's okay to do your garden and we need that it's okay to collect your guns it's okay to collect this your shoes it's okay to collect cars amen but is that where is your affection will you die if you don't have your cars or will you die if you don't have christ you see praise the lord it says set your affection on things above not on things on the earth for ye are dead and your life is hid with christ and god praise the lord jesus amen i want to talk this this afternoon a little bit about boundaries amen and i want to i don't i want to i want to i want us to think about this this phrase freedom by boundaries freedom by boundaries amen because sometimes we think that there is we're bound when there are boundaries in our life but in reality you're free by those boundaries if we don't have boundaries then everything goes uh array everything gets out of cater gets out of order and therefore we need to have boundaries so let's we're going to talk about freedom by boundary so let's just buy our heads and how many have a need on their heart if you just make it i know we all have needs amen you say lord i have a spiritual need i have a physical need my body needs healing my children need salvation and god knows your need god knows every need behind that hand and he's more than able to meet that need so let's just go to the lord in prayer heavenly father as we come before you lord jesus we thank you for the opportunity lord that you give us father to open back the pages of your word and lord not to hear a man lord god but to hear father that christ speaking to us lord jesus i don't know all the needs that are represented here but you do lord and every young person here every middle-aged person here every older person here has a need behind those hands and i pray that you will just meet that need according to your riches in glory lord we pray that you would continue blessing lord god the rest of the service and every activity that's being done and lord father let everything that we do say and think be honored to you help me to get aside lord so that you'd use my lips to speak to your people lord and we just commit this time into your hands lord for it's your word lord jesus in jesus christ and we pray amen amen you may be seated praise the lord i know those seats ain't the most comfortable so if i see a lot of squirming stuff we'll just stand up for a little bit or you're welcome to do that if you want but freedom by boundaries i want to you know when i was when i was a younger i used to play soccer and uh i really liked soccer i used to play soccer and i wasn't good at it but i played goalie all right that's mainly what i what i would play and i got plenty of times i got hit in the head with the ball seen white for about 10 seconds but sometimes it back in my home country you know we didn't have goals we didn't have goals i mean so we would make up our own goals our own goals so we built would build like a little one stick here one stick here and another stick here touching each other and that would be our little goals that we would have and that would be that and that's where we would play but see that would be our boundaries that we would have you see we would make our own little boundaries a goal out here is a boundary see we have boundaries right here on this and this and this court in this basketball court you see if the ball comes out at a certain place it's out of bounds and they they uh they they start they start blowing you hear that right when you're out of bounds that's what you're gonna hear when you're wrong that's what you're going to hear right when you're in the wrong what does that mean that means get back in step right i mean get back in bounds or or or do what you're supposed to do praise the lord jesus that is the exact same thing sayings that that that the word of god is to us amen it's it's that it's that whistle amen when we step out of bounds when we get out of our boundary amen that god knows that you are going you are on your way out of freedom amen out of what you're supposed to be doing so he amen he uses a preacher he uses the word he uses whatever he needs to use in order to get get back instead amen praise the lord jesus so you know in soccer you know you have you have uh goalkeepers and goalkeepers uh uh you know they're there to guard the ball so that the other team won't score in that goal you see and satan satan is the one that that he he's there trying to block our life i mean he's there doing everything he can to make sure that you don't score and you're supposed to do what what you have to do amen in order to scale and scale higher spiritually amen and that's what satan is their job he's he's the goalkeeper amen you have a goal you have a purpose and you have something amen that you must do in this life but satan is right there he's ready amen he's ready at all times he's sometimes i say i say a lot of times that he's he's more prepared than we are he comes to church more than we do sometimes amen but he is right there he does his job very good and he's ready he's ready there to put a stop to it because if he had a way he wouldn't he wouldn't allow this man but some of you all persevered and man we all persevered and you're here amen because god put something in you amen there's something beyond than just just fellowship and physically amen there's something eternal that we are seeking amen and that is the that is that is the purpose of what we have in this life amen so what is what is a boundary and the in in the body in the in the dictionary boundary is something such as a river a fence or an imaginary line that shows where an area ends and another area begins another another definition of it is a point or limit that indicates where two things become different amen and i like that that definition because i believe as christians amen we should be different amen how many believe that i mean i i i believe that there should be a distinction between a christian and a worldly person now we're not then diminishing the worldly person or the sinner amen praise god they need christ just as you needed christ amen but i believe that when you profess christ there has to be a difference in your life amen there has to be a difference in the way you dress there has to be in the difference in the way you talk there has to be a difference in the way in the way you see things amen it can't be the same thing and say that you are putting your affections on things above because you're still looking at earthly things and you're trying to mix them with christianity and that doesn't work there's no boundary in that now how many believe that god likes boundaries the the best the best the this is the best uh uh example of a boundary that we have the word of god this is the rule book right just this just as a a referee in a basketball game or a volleyball game has a rule book that he goes by he can't just be blowing the whistle just to blow it whenever he don't like you so he's going to blow that whistle every time you you touch the ball you you hit the ball no no but that's not what the word of god does right the word of god has certain rules has certain boundaries but it's not just a free thing a free-for-all he he has he knows what he's talking about in other words now when the referee blows his whistle amen when he blows his whistle everybody you know pays attention right and you may not agree not everybody agrees but he's the absolute he's the one that's got the whistle he's the one that's got the rule book he's the one that that is in charge of making sure everything's right and it doesn't matter if everybody understands throws cups at him throws tomatoes at him he's got a job to do praise the lord jesus and it doesn't matter amen what people say what people think praise god the bible already gives us something definite and we got to stick to that amen that's why us preachers amen we got to preach the word we we can't preach our own ideas we can't preach our own opinions we can't preach joe olsteen we can't preach uh uh you know you know we got to preach the word of god because that is the ultimate that is the that is the rule book praise the lord so a point a limit that indicates where two things become different so there's there's a difference amen there's a difference but if i go past this line i'm out of bounds but if i stay in this line right here i'm in bounds there's a difference right praise the lord jesus i mean you're still with me so boundaries they're they're essentially for keeping things in order and and to flow smoothly and i want to encourage you young people i want to encourage you uh children hey man when we we have to have boundaries everywhere we go we have to have boundaries in our homes amen you have to have certain boundaries in your own even in your own room you you know some of you who have your own room there are certain boundaries there are certain limits certain things that that you won't allow amen some of you you know don't don't you know they have your own room at 15 16 17 18 year old hey man you just don't want any three-year-old to come in there and just start messing around with everything that you got and everything hey man because you have limits you have you set your own boundaries for your own room right see you you set your own boundaries and so don't get upset when the parent at the house is trying to set their own boundaries in their own domain praise god we got boundaries too and we just don't want anything to be done around there or or anything to be said amen we have to have our own boundaries as well and not just that it's because the rule book said so amen and because we love you and god loves you amen so those boundaries are there for freedom so that you can maintain your peace your sanity your freedom praise god it's not to bound you praise the lord it's not it's not to keep you restricted you can't go anywhere you can't do anything amen it's to keep certain things flowing in order in a certain direction because our prayer us as parents and god has a vision of you right we have visions of of you and and and it's positive visions just as god said in his word that he told jeremiah that i have i have what is that uh i have known you or i have seen you i have i have uh i have forgot the the the verse but it's something on the line so that you can have a positive end right and that's what we desire is for you to have a positive end therefore we've got to implement boundaries so that you may have a positive end praise the lord so there is sent there for keeping things in order now the children of israel when they were receiving their inheritance amen and joshua was given out the the inheritances for each area they were supposed to have the joshua was saying this this tribe will have this piece of land and this tribe will have this piece of land and this tribe will have this piece of land you can read that in the book of in the book of joshua and god gave wisdom to joshua revealed to joshua amen where each one was to be located and they could not cross each other right they had to respect each other's boundaries praise god so boundaries are important to god amen and and like i said each tribe they received their portion and they couldn't step out of bounds praise god now as i we was just talking about you can't even play sports if there's no boundaries right you can't even play you there there's nothing that there's no game that you can play there's no there is no sport that is played and there are no boundaries in place there has to be boundaries if everything is free for all we could just it's really no fun you think about it it's not fun when everybody can just do whatever they want to and i remember sometimes you know i am the type of person that i like to play games by the rules right and when i would play basketball or where i play soccer and i'd be very concentrated and and i wanted to just play you know and just have a good game going you know i play out in the rain i play out but then with my friends when they start getting bored and they just kind of start slacking and just shooting around and just man i'm like man forget y'all man i'll just go home it's boring then when you don't set any any boundaries you see everybody's all loose about everything you see and that's what god doesn't want us to do just be loose about everything amen but have some boundaries in your life praise the lord jesus now i want us to read here for just a moment i want us to look at a story here in the book of first samuel first samuel chapter eight if you have your bibles we want to read here a few verses i want us to look at something here real quick first samuel chapter 8 verse 1. man the bible says here and it came to pass when samuel was old samuel being the prophet of god that he made his sons judges over israel now the name of his firstborn was joel in the name of his second abaya they were judges in beersheba and his sons walked not in his ways but turned aside after luker and took bribes and perverted judgment so his sons did not did not go after their his father's ways their father's ways then all the elders of israel gathered themselves together and came to samuel unto rhema so here comes all the people around israel everybody all the elders and they gather around samuel and this look what they tell him and said unto him watch pay attention and say unto him behold samuel you're old and your sons are not walking in your ways now make us a king to judge us like all the nations they wanted a king so that they could be like everybody else right when god was their king amen using the prophet samuel he was speaking directly to samuel and they would get the word from samuel right and that was the boundary that god had placed in their life and they were living like that and there was peace there was there was they had they had peace in their life you see everything was flowing fine but when they started looking at everybody else in the world and how they did things now they desire the same exact thing i mean certain certain person she wears these type of shoes i gotta have those shoes i gotta have that certain look i've gotta you you see it was the exact same thing they desire it is it's a human thing to want to be like somebody else there's nothing wrong with that there's a reason why we have to be good examples it's it's it's it's it's normal to want to to have a model in your life you see but that's the reason why jesus gave us himself to be a role model he gave us his word he gave us him he showed us how we should live life how we should conduct ourselves how we should think how we should talk but that's the one that we look at the less and then we wonder why we have so many problems in our life spiritually and physically but we don't look at the right role model we look at at lebron james we look at at whatever pop singer that's out there we we look at anime as a role model all these different things but we don't ever stop to think this role model is eternal those other things will pass away praise god but here's israel they want a king just like everybody else and in verse 6 it says but the thing displeased samuel when they said give us a king to judge us and samuel prayed unto the lord and the lord said unto samuel hearken unto the voice of the people in other words listen to what they're that they're asking for go ahead that's fine hearken unto the voice of the people and all that they say unto you for they have not rejected you samuel but they have rejected me this is the lord speaking that i should not reign over them according to all the works which they have done since the day that i brought them up out of egypt even unto this day where they have forsaken me and served other gods so do they also unto thee now therefore hearken to their voice how be it yet protest solemnly unto them and show them the manner of the king that shall reign over them and samuel told all the words of the lord unto the people that asked of him a king in other words god told samuel to tell the people that's fine they can have their own king go ahead and let them have their their worldly living go ahead and let them have what they desire in their heart to do that's fine let them but tell them first first first hand give them the consequences of that decision and so samuel gives them the consequences of them one and a king and this is the consequences that he tells them he said he will take their sons that king if you have a king he will take their sons and make them his servants his horsemen and drivers of his war carriages and they will go running before his war carriages in other words everybody was to work for the king then they didn't have a king then they didn't have to do that now they're going to have to do that right the daughters he will take to be makers of perfumes and cooks and bread makers in other words you're going to be forced to work for the king he wants a certain style of perfume or a certain cologne the daughters are gonna are be tasked to make sure that they get that exact scent for the king they're gonna they that they get him the exact cake that he likes to he likes to eat that exact thing that he likes why because he's the king but that's what they want he will take a tenth of their of their and the fruit of the of the vines and give it to his servants in other words he will start taking taxes from them but they didn't have that before the king and then another thing is that he will take their manservants and their servant girls and the best of their oxen and their donkeys and put them to his work so they could not have their their donkeys their cows their even their dog they couldn't have at their house anymore everything had to be just for the service of the king now this is the warning that samuel gave to the children of israel right just as god gives us warning if we go that direction if we step out of those boundaries that's this is what's going to happen it's already laid out in the word the problem is is that we don't like to look at it well i'm just going to do it anyways so this is this is exactly what we do just walk away and ignore it like in there it's never there [Music] but the word of what god is still staring it still stands it's still established just because you ignore it doesn't mean you're not going to suffer the consequences that it gives right and so samuel gives them this warning and this is what they say to samuel and in that day you will cry out because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves but the lord will not answer you in that day now watch verse 19. he says but the people refused to obey the voice of samuel and they said no but there shall be a king over us after samuel had given them exactly everything that they were going to they were going to suffer they still say no still give us a a king now i i want i want somebody i want somebody to tell me what that sounds like to you what does that sound like to you now but what do you think the children of people the children of israel what does that sound like to you after samuel giving uncertain that warning and they still say we still want a king they don't want to listen to samuel they want to do what they want to do and not listen to the prophet what do you think i mean is it dumb i said it sounds subtle doesn't it adam what do you think about that adam says it's dumb how about over here somebody over here tell me somebody has been given a warning but yet they still go and do it michael disobedience michael says disobedience that's exactly right mercy do you have an idea no do you think that it's it it's a dumb idea to not listen the prophet already told them but they still just do do what they want to do right what do you think brother christian what's happening today amen sounds like what happened everybody wants to do their own thing praise god right so so some people said stupid all right i heard stupid over here or dumb oh stubborn something but it's still stupid some people over here said uh disobedient michael said disobedient but a christian said it sounds like people today right praise the lord jesus but i want you to think about this young people amen if that sounds like that amen what is this what are we thinking for example as parents when you guys don't listen to what we tell you under the the word of god what are we going to think that sounds dumb that's stubborn that's disobedient the exact same things that you're thinking about these these people here the children of israel is the exact same things that we as parents or as ministers or as pastors or people over you amen what do you think the holy spirit as the referee what does he think that's stubborn that is that's that's dumb right but he can't do anything because he can't force you to do something that you don't want to do you go ahead go your own way but you're going to suffer the consequences you get out of bounds amen you're going to suffer the consequences praise the lord just as somebody keeps getting uh uh in a game keeps doing the exact same thing keeps fouling amen after the fifth or sixth foul you're gonna get kicked out of the game right because the referee said so praise the lord but the people here kept going and they said here what we also may be like all the nations verse 20 and that our team may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles and when samuel had heard all the words of the people he repeated them in the ears of the lord and the lord said to samuel obey their voice and make them a king samuel then said to the man of israel go every man to his city praise god so samuel had to do exactly what the people want see that is the grace of god to us that god allows you to make a choice in your life what if we didn't have a choice and we'd all be just robots you know we're just walking one direction and then god pushes us this way so we're just gonna go this way and then god says go this way back again and then go this way and then we're just all robots but god allows us to choose amen in that choosing you learn lessons good or bad or you have positive experiences or negative experiences right but remember there's freedom by having boundaries god's word is our boundary praise the lord amen i'm going to try to move a little quickly here so jeremiah tells us this for us to seek the old paths he says thus said the lord in verse 16 of jeremiah chapter 6 thus said the lord stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths where is the good way and walk therein and you shall find rest for your souls but what the children of israel tell them but they said we will not walk therein those are some stubborn people jeremiah's telling them amen go back to the old paths amen go back to the original foundations do the original things and watch what he said he said and you will find rest for your souls how many want peace in their soul how many want rest in their soul i i want rest i want peace i want i want an assurance i want something firm to stand on praise god but we seek in everything else and not where and not the original source so we need to seek to go back to those old paths amen some of you some of you children you you know you you you think your your your parents sometimes they talk to you too much and you say something like leave me in peace leave me in peace but in reality there is no peace in your heart there is no peace in your life amen if you are outside of the bounds of the word of god there is no real peace in your heart that peace will end amen but god's peace will it will never end because even if you're going through problems in your heart in your life even if everything your car breaks down and you can't get to work if you're if you lose your job if you uh whatever it may be you get a flat tire or or your your tennis shoes get scratched up you're like oh well i got peace and joy in my heart amen because i i know the prince of peace amen and that's what matters the most praise god amen praise the lord jesus trying to move a little quickly here so there is even boundaries and i'll just get to a point here in just a moment we'll get to some some some sticky things now because what is the difference between courtship and dating right there's there's a difference i'm like oh well it's just the same thing no no wait a second dating let's look at dating here for just a moment dating has no boundaries dating you just you could shack up with somebody or you could go out with somebody go on a date amen and whatever it may start something something uh uh innocent amen and then one thing leads to another there is no boundaries there one little touch of the hands ends up with something else some kissing some hugging and then it ends up with something that you didn't even think about in the first place and you're wondering how in the world did i get into the situation why because you didn't put boundaries in your in that in that in that thing now if you have god in your heart god will be the boundaries you see that's the reason why young people we don't we don't encourage them man we don't encourage you just to go from one person to the other one person to the other and let me just try this one let me just try another one and let me just oh this one no it doesn't work that way have a goal in mind have something that that you are aiming for amen and i hope that that is marriage right and then and that's that's what courtship is courtship is is you aiming is two mature people two mature people that are actually aiming amen they're they're seeing each other they're they're they're talking to each other and everybody around them knows about it that's one of the main things everybody around knows about it and that there's a pastor knows about it their parents know about it why because they want to do things by those boundaries so that things don't get out of hand you see and they have a goal in mind we want to marry we want to we this is our goal you see but in dating there is no goal and dating is just to have a good time and that good time could lead to other things that you eventually you'll end up regretting now i've had friends that have gone there done that even when i was in high school i had a friend in 10th grade got a girl pregnant he had a baby at 10th grade in 10th grade and you see it all the time and and now you see but it could have been prevented if you just had the right mindset about things you see praise god so it's so it's very important even to have the right goal the right uh bounds and the right boundaries even in those areas in our lives you see because you can't just let loose you can't just let loose and so don't get upset with your with your dad that says uh sweetheart listen i i don't i don't agree that you go that way why because he's looking ahead he you're looking at the moment the way i feel right now and it is and it just feels so good and it's all right but see we're looking ahead we're looking beyond the feeling right the feeling will lead to something later on that you will regret and you'll be like why did i even go there how did i even meet him why didn't i even meet her you see we we were trying to prevent that from and more and more for sure god god is trying to prevent that praise god all right so trying to move ahead here skipping all these things here all right so jeremiah 6 1 tells us it says also i set watchman over you right and saying hearken to the sound of the trumpet but israel said but they said we will not hearken so god's always placing watchmen god's always placing boundaries in our lives and let's not be like the children of israel are amen we will not listen we will not listen we will not hearken amen because i'm going to do my own thing well if you do your own thing you'll go you'll have your own reward that's what jesus said amen so god's placed watchmen over you the ministers the the pastor the the the different men in your life and and women in your life that will help lead and guide you young people don't be afraid to talk to your parents about certain things ask them questions amen they're we're we're here as boundaries for you we're not here to harm you or give you or or stop you from having fun in your life or no we're here to just be guides you see just like a a a guy for a river amen if if a person that needs to have a flow of water go this way where they got to have something there to stop that flow right here and make it go this way you see but the flow is still going it's just we're just guiding it you see amen and the holy spirit is guiding us amen so that we can guide you praise god amen boundaries usually have landmarks amen landmarks can be rivers hills trees or even man-made landmarks and what do you think our our landmark is what is our spiritual landmark amen this is the token which is the holy ghost amen the holy ghost is our landmine amen whatever the holy spirit says that's what we do amen that is uh that that is what guides our lives amen praise glory and you know what if you do away with that landmark amen if you do over that land work then you're then your boundaries are lost you see we when we have boundaries out here between for example two neighbors there is a landmark there there's maybe a little flag there or a little something to mark that that is your property and this is my problem you see and that is what the holy ghost is amen this marks amen that i am i belong to god and that is that is of satan and i don't belong to that you see the holy ghost is what makes the difference in your life that's why it's so important young people to make sure that you have the new birth in your life to make sure that you have the holy ghost and not just not just a feeling or not just a hunch that i think i have it or or that or that no now that you know that i have that that landmark in my life that i have a guide in my life that i have an absolute in my life make sure that you know don't just go by a hunch don't just go by by by uh or maybe you know i i i felt this or no it's not my feelings it do you have it the way the word of god says amen sure you may have a feeling that's good but don't don't put bank everything on the field amen bank it on is the word of god more interesting to you or not do you desire the word more do you desire even to come to church do you desire to even hang around with the right people right i know when i got saved and now when i became a christian i didn't want to do the things of the world anymore and my mom and dad didn't tell me to stop or my mom and dad didn't tell me to stop playing video games and and things like that it was something in me said i shouldn't be feeding on these things anymore and it made me want to seek the things from above and i i got around and i started giving out i've given this testimony before i used to love playing video games that's just what i love right now i still get around sometimes if i have time but i hardly don't have time anymore michael did me the other day he was over at our house and we got we got to play in some racing games like man i ain't done this in a while but you see there is a there's a time that you know there are certain things that i used to do that i just couldn't do anymore why because they were not feeding my soul they were actually vexing my soul right watching me chopping people's heads off and and and mutilating people and playing scary games with demons and things like that that's what i was into none of that helped me grow spiritually right so when i was giving out the video games to my friends really what i should have done is just threw them away but i was giving them out they're like man why are you giving this thing you know what it's like actually no i didn't give it i didn't give him i threw him away actually and so my friend one of my friends i even what gaming buddies i used to play with he's like man why don't you just give them to me and i told them i said listen man it's like me giving you poison taking my poison and just giving it to you i didn't feel right you see so there's got to be a change there's the the holy spirit amen puts boundaries in our lives amen praise god you can't be the same when you really receive an experience with god amen praise the lord jesus sometimes saints it's not about the enemy moving the landmarks but it's us moving those landmarks ourselves we put and blame everything on the devil but in reality we're the ones who move the landmarks we're the ones who are at fault you see praise god i know everybody's getting hot so we're trying to move along quickly and young people don't don't see how close you can get to the world hey man don't see how how how close i can get to the to the i'm still okay i'm still going to church i'm still hey man but but i'm just just walking barely rarely any little thing that happens in your life you're going down you see just teeter-tattering you know just that just a little bit of the world you know just to you know that's not how we we gotta we gotta run away from the world get as far away from it as possible so that people know where we stand right by the way you dress by the way you look by the way you you talk amen you can't just be walking and think that you won't fall if you're doing this you see people know if you're doing this tender tattering right next to the world but still got your foot over here on the things of god people can tell but people can see something's wrong with you spiritually and any little thing that will come in your life is gonna knock you over amen but what what a great thing it is to be able to walk firmly walking and not when i'm not teeter-tattering with the world just a little bit you know but walking firmly that's why god gave us two firm feet to walk on and god gave us two spiritual firm feet to welcome the old and new testament amen praise the lord jesus so don't let the bars down in your life young people hold fast to what you've scripturally been taught make sure you have an absolute so this one i want you to get in summary as christians we must we must establish healthy boundaries that are biblically based amen boundaries activate the promises of god in our life how many believe that amen they they activate the promises of god in our life boundaries promote true freedom boundaries are not there to tie you up bound you up they promote true freedom while some things may be lawful for you not all things are beneficial for you you see praise the lord so i want you to think about these questions what is the landmark that you have moved in your life that has taken you out of the spiritual boundaries what is that landmark only you know that is it prayer man is it going to church is it reading meditating on the word of god amen what is it what is it that you're not doing again that you used to do when you had that real close relationship with god amen because brother brennan told the story he said wherever you left christ that's where you'll find him again he's there waiting for you again wherever you left him that's where you'll find him he has not moved you're the one that moved he's still there extended hands waiting for you amen is it reading studying god's word get to reading and study praise god is it how you treat others start treating others with respect and kindness treat them the way you want to be treated right is it coming to church then start coming to church if you are not consistently right i want to finish with this i want us to set our eyes on reading the first verse that we that we started with in colossians 3 2 set your affections on things above and not on things of this earth praise the lord brother christian i want you to help me with this example here oh yeah we brought out the tools we brought up the the cute all right remember what we just read we just read in paul told us set your affection on things above are the things above temporary are they eternal they're eternal right and he says here not on things on the earth are the things of the earth eternal or temporal they are tempered they won't last they will burn up amen but the things of god will always be amen so i have this rope right here amen i want us to thank brother christian said that this rope was about 12 feet we cut a little piece yesterday to make sure this is going to work now a rope you can use it as as a as a boundary too you see you can use a rope to to to you know for boundaries and for look at that i'm making it look like a snake that was pretty cool all right but i want us to think about this young people adults too because sometimes we just get carried away with the things of this life too much i include myself this right here this right here represents our life this little piece right here you have this whole thing right and this little piece right here from here to the end is our life is our life here on earth right but some of us we fixate more on this little piece and you forget about the rest of eternity that is ahead of you look look how long that rope is but you're only thinking about this little piece in your life right and at any moment god will come in and cut that piece right go ahead this represents death this is all that you have left this is what you were concentrating on which is time here on earth this little piece on earth and you forget what lies ahead this whole thing lies ahead what would you prefer the short piece or the or the long piece the the thing that will that that's longer that that lasts that's eternal i mean i i want the longer peace thank you brother christian give him a clap of praise [Applause] don't fixate on this fixate on the eternal things that's why paul said don't look at the things look at the things above and not the things of this earth right because this is going to end one day death will come and cut you off death will come none of us are exempt from it it will come we don't know when we don't know how but it will happen we trust that each and every one of us who have the holy ghost we're going in a rapture right amen but while we're here on this earth amen we're not promised tomorrow so don't think about today think about eternity that's why paul said set your affections on things above and not the things of this world amen so i hope i hope that that helps amen to keep boundaries in your life it's very important and don't get upset with the parent just trying to make sure that you stay by those boundaries don't get upset with the preacher that's preaching and trying so that you can stay by those boundaries amen because it is the holy ghost speaking if it's according to the word of god if he's speaking according to the word or if your parents are speaking according to the word don't get upset say lord let me analyze this let me think and be prayerful about it god will direct you exactly where you need to go praise god how many love the lord amen if you desire prayer if you want us to pray with you if you know we're more than glad to pray just amen so god sins of him don't let them go get it because they're going to get their own but if god gives it to you you're not going to get thrown around when god does his work amen that it's done right thank you thank you absolutely amen let's just go to the lord in prayer our heavenly father we thank you once again for the opportunity to have served you lord we appreciate heavenly father the word lord that you've given us today
