[1:09] ones are here I just thought they our
[1:10] church is expanding this
[1:12] morning yeah Monica family it would
[1:19] expand all right let's review before we
[1:21] get to John where we came from blessed
[1:24] are the poor in spirit for their is the
[1:26] Kingdom of
[1:27] Heaven in 2 Corinthians 8:9 for you know
[1:30] the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that
[1:31] though he was rich yet for your sakes he
[1:33] became poor that ye through his poverty
[1:35] might be rich so Christ was an example
[1:38] for us to follow and he demonstrated all
[1:41] these attributes the characteristics of
[1:43] someone that is in this new kingdom that
[1:45] he's um telling about in Psalm 861 bow
[1:49] down in your ear oh Lord hear me for I
[1:51] am poor and needy characteristics of a
[1:53] bever of believer blessed are they that
[1:55] mourn for they shall be
[1:58] comforted everybody can see all
[2:01] right he has despised and rejected of
[2:04] men a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with
[2:07] grief and we hid as it were our faces
[2:09] from him he was despised and we esteemed
[2:12] him not a man of sorrow is and
[2:14] acquainted with grief Sor him because
[2:17] people turned him down and wouldn't
[2:18] believe his message and couldn't see
[2:21] him and then we uh taking on the same
[2:25] attributes we begin to mourn for sin in
[2:27] our lives and mourn because other people
[2:29] just like he mourned that people
[2:30] couldn't see see the word that he was
[2:33] trying to teach can't see the truth
[2:35] blessed are the meek for they shall
[2:37] inherit the earth the me will get all
[2:39] the promises of God everything that was
[2:41] promised when Jesus therefore perceived
[2:43] that they would come and take him by
[2:44] force in John 65 to make him a king he
[2:47] departed again into a mountain himself
[2:52] alone think about and and us the the
[2:55] spirit of God in us makes us not to want
[2:57] to promote ourselves and make us some
[2:59] something big but uh just like he did
[3:02] and I know the whole I know the whole
[3:04] story about how it wasn't time for him
[3:06] to to introduce his Earthly Kingdom but
[3:09] uh it's kind of uh the spirit of it is
[3:12] he he uh didn't he wasn't interested in
[3:16] making himself uh over you know right
[3:21] something something big in that way his
[3:24] Brethren therefore said unto him John in
[3:27] John 73 show thyself un the
[3:30] world cuz they thought U and it goes on
[3:34] in John 73 that he um went separated
[3:37] himself and went apart from the people
[3:39] his bre if and show show thyself under
[3:41] the world and that's what
[3:44] uh maybe a lot of times we kind of it's
[3:48] the opposite of meekness to show make
[3:51] yourself something
[3:54] big blessed are they which do hunger and
[3:56] thirst after righteousness for they
[3:58] shall be filled
[4:00] fulfilled by fulfilling God's word
[4:02] Matthew 5:17 think not that I am come to
[4:05] destroy the law or the prophets I am not
[4:08] come to destroy but to fulfill to
[4:10] fulfill everything that the pro that the
[4:11] word spoke about and in John 4:34 Jesus
[4:16] said unto them my meat is to do the will
[4:18] of him that sent me and to finish his
[4:20] work and that's what we're our our role
[4:24] is to uh believe God's word take it in
[4:27] fulfill everything that God's word said
[4:29] about us if it said we're blessed uh
[4:31] then we could hang on to that promise
[4:34] that if we hunger and thirst after
[4:36] righteousness we see see God's word make
[4:38] uh made real in our lives and not just
[4:41] uh we're not just here to learn about
[4:43] God and and put it up on the shelf and
[4:44] say yeah I know I know all about it but
[4:47] it's to change our lives to fulfill his
[4:49] word in
[4:51] US blessed are the merciful for they
[4:54] shall obtain Mercy Titus 3:5 said not by
[4:57] works of righteousness which we have
[4:59] done
[5:00] but according to his Mercy Mercy he
[5:02] saved us by the washing of regeneration
[5:04] and renewing of the Holy
[5:06] Ghost and
[5:08] mercy how do you know if you if Mercy
[5:11] has been shown to you then you will show
[5:13] Mercy in James 21:18 he said yeah a man
[5:15] may say thou H has faith and I have
[5:17] Works show me thy faith without thy
[5:20] works and I will show thee my faith by
[5:21] my works this is a a characteristic of a
[5:25] Believer to be merciful to others to
[5:27] introduce to pull other people to Christ
[5:29] by your life and then blessed are the
[5:32] pure in heart for they shall see God and
[5:36] that's what we're going to talk about
[5:37] now what what does it mean to be pure in
[5:39] heart and if you're pure in heart you'll
[5:41] see God and think about when Jesus was
[5:45] standing on this mountain telling all of
[5:47] these Parables the the almighty God
[5:50] remember that first slide was that that
[5:52] Galaxy that the hble telescope took a
[5:54] picture of the same one that spoke that
[5:57] Gacy into existence was standing before
[5:59] them speaking these Beatitudes speaking
[6:02] these blessings but they couldn't see
[6:06] him because uh maybe their motives and
[6:11] objectives and the things that they
[6:12] desired in life were not pure and think
[6:14] about go down back through history and
[6:16] think about all the people that did see
[6:18] God and it's not the people that lived
[6:21] uh you kind of uh might be tempted to
[6:24] let make like merciful shall obtain
[6:26] Mercy because uh like uh that we're
[6:28] saved by our works or the pure in heart
[6:31] will see God because they live pure
[6:33] lives which is is true but it's uh
[6:36] remember Rahab uh saw God she was a uh a
[6:40] prostitute the woman at the well was a a
[6:43] woman of ill Fame uh this the Good
[6:45] Samaritan all uh go down through history
[6:49] and the people that saw God were Longing
[6:51] To See were had a desire to see God and
[6:56] um even though when they saw him maybe
[6:59] their lives weren't perfect but after
[7:01] they saw God then God began to purify
[7:03] their lives and uh
[7:06] um root a change in their life so the
[7:09] pure in heart is we looked at that quote
[7:11] last time where brother R
[7:13] said the the pure in heart is someone
[7:16] that will believe God that will take God
[7:19] at his word and won't settle for uh any
[7:22] leev to any uh false Doctrine to be to
[7:25] be introduced so let's look at John 1
[7:30] 46 and
[7:32] 49 see what kind of what kind of person
[7:35] it takes to uh to see
[7:40] God start at John 1 verse
[7:44] 46 and Nathaniel said unto him Nathaniel
[7:47] was talking to Phillip who had been
[7:50] praying a Desiring to see the things of
[7:53] God and brought up maybe to look for a
[7:56] messiah that one would come to um
[7:59] deliver men from their sins and he he
[8:02] was praying when Philip found him Andel
[8:04] or Nathaniel was praying when Philip
[8:06] found him and
[8:07] Nathaniel or first Versa sorry and
[8:10] Nathaniel said unto him can there any
[8:12] good thing come out of Nazareth Philip
[8:15] saith unto him come and see now all the
[8:19] others maybe look Upon Jesus and and
[8:21] could not see God made manifest mhm
[8:25] Jesus saw Nathaniel coming to him and
[8:28] saith him behold an Israelite indeed and
[8:32] whom is no
[8:34] G now his motives and objectives and
[8:37] what he was Desiring in life was pure
[8:39] and uh it reminds me of a story my dad
[8:42] used to tell me growing up about he uh
[8:44] he was in a Pentecostal church and one
[8:47] day he got in the car and there was a a
[8:51] minister in the car and he pulled out
[8:53] this big water of bills and said son if
[8:55] you want to be a preacher this is what
[8:57] you can have a big water bill
[8:59] so his motives and objectives were not
[9:02] in he wasn't he was not pure in heart
[9:05] Desiring to see Desiring to seek
[9:09] God now Nathaniel saith unto him whence
[9:14] knowest thou me Jesus answered and said
[9:17] unto him before that Philip called thee
[9:20] when thou was under the Fig Tree I saw
[9:22] thee now Nathaniel's Eyes Are
[9:25] Open he can see that this just isn't any
[9:28] man think about all the all the uh all
[9:31] the times that brother brandham turned
[9:33] his back on the audience in the
[9:36] congregation and some people in the
[9:37] audience could see God in that man but
[9:40] some
[9:42] couldn't and then we're going to kind of
[9:43] go down through uh the how brother
[9:46] random said you can see God in his
[9:48] universe and his word and his son and
[9:50] his people and all four of those uh some
[9:54] can see God you can look up in the stars
[9:56] and look outside and see God uh
[10:00] manifesting his telling the story of the
[10:02] Resurrection by the way the sun moves
[10:04] across the sky and goes down and comes
[10:06] up the next day or how every every fall
[10:10] the uh nature goes into the ground and
[10:13] then comes up the next year resurrection
[10:15] and you can look at those things and one
[10:16] person can see God and the other can't
[10:19] the same thing about
[10:21] uh what about when the when a minister
[10:23] standing behind the platform this this
[10:25] morning after this Sunday school lesson
[10:27] some will be able to say well this this
[10:29] this is the word of God because I know
[10:31] that it Bears record with it's the same
[10:32] thing that Paul said and others will say
[10:35] well it's just I'm just here I'm just a
[10:39] church some can see God in the people
[10:43] and some
[10:45] can't Nathaniel said unto him once
[10:47] knowest thou me Jesus answered and said
[10:49] unto him before that Philip called the
[10:50] when thou was under the washed under the
[10:52] Fig Tree I saw thee Nathaniel answered
[10:55] and said unto him Rabbi Thou Art the Son
[10:57] of God Thou Art the king of
[11:00] Israel and he got a revelation he can
[11:02] see God he look past the flesh think
[11:05] about Peter uh when Jesus said who who
[11:08] am I and he said thou are the Christ the
[11:10] son of God and he said Flesh and Blood
[11:12] My Flesh my outside hasn't revealed this
[11:15] to you but the Father in Heaven has
[11:17] revealed has opened this to you because
[11:20] Peter was pure in heart so let's um so
[11:25] you can see God in his universe and his
[11:27] word and his son and his people and when
[11:30] you can see these things by Christ
[11:32] Living in you brother Rand said and show
[11:34] us the father and suffices there was so
[11:37] much God on the inside he could see him
[11:39] on the outside he's talking about that
[11:40] Deacon in his church if you want to see
[11:42] God in his Universe get him on the
[11:44] outside and he goes on to talk about
[11:46] watch the birds sing in the trees he's
[11:48] in his Universe did you ever see him in
[11:50] a sunset you can see him all around
[11:52] because he's he fills you up right and
[11:54] changes the way you look at things right
[11:57] changes your eyesight
[12:00] now let's look at uh expand it on out
[12:05] look into look into the universe and the
[12:07] um the U remember how brother brand
[12:11] talked about Daniel uh uh was the head
[12:15] of the Magi in in Babylon and if you
[12:18] look back through history all of the the
[12:20] constellations and the star patterns and
[12:22] everything are the exactly the same
[12:24] across all of the civilizations they
[12:26] came back through down through history
[12:28] somebody
[12:29] way back Beyond had a revelation
[12:31] Josephus said it goes all the way back
[12:33] to Seth that he could look up into the
[12:35] stars and say that uh I and see God's
[12:39] word patterned in the stars the story of
[12:42] redemption told now it's got to take a
[12:45] revelation because look at this you got
[12:47] 1 2 3 4 five five stars how can you see
[12:50] a ram in that little simple
[12:53] constellation Aries you look up in the
[12:55] stars and see well there's there's the
[12:59] Redeemer Aries
[13:02] mhm that's the same way not just the
[13:06] universe the same way with uh the the
[13:10] word and the sun you can open up this
[13:12] this Bible and unless God opens it to
[13:14] you it's just like this constellation I
[13:17] I don't know what it means I remember
[13:19] when I first started my journey I would
[13:21] open up a church AG book and uh the
[13:23] Bible and I it it was almost like Greek
[13:26] but over time it begins God to unfold it
[13:29] right that's right and unfold it and
[13:32] uh in in James chapter 4 James said um
[13:36] uh he wrote uh if you draw unto God
[13:39] he'll draw unto you and cleanse your
[13:42] cleanse your hands you oh you Sinners
[13:44] and purify your heart uh he's talking
[13:49] about uh he said purify your heart you
[13:51] double minded because a pure heart is
[13:54] somebody that desires to see God and and
[13:57] won't take anything else not any leev of
[14:00] the world is Desiring to um to for just
[14:03] the pure unadulterated word of God to
[14:06] see him and his creation and his people
[14:08] and his word and his
[14:09] son and look at at the solar system and
[14:12] you can see God in his Perfection how
[14:14] remember number three is life on the
[14:17] third day of creation life was came into
[14:20] being and uh what planet are we 1 2
[14:26] 3 and it just speaks of of uh you look
[14:30] at how the moon was put into orbit just
[14:33] perfectly to reflect the light of the
[14:35] sun it testifies of the bright and this
[14:37] and and in God how when it's a full moon
[14:40] you can look up into the night sky and
[14:41] see the the Moon is so bright that you
[14:44] can see
[14:46] everything and the Earth was put into
[14:49] orbit in such a way that they had it was
[14:51] just big enough to hold just to to pull
[14:54] just amount the right amount of
[14:57] atmosphere together so that we could
[14:58] have air to breathe if it was too big it
[15:01] would spin into the sun if it was too
[15:03] small you wouldn't have enough oxygen
[15:05] and atmosphere but it was placed just
[15:07] perfect you know Mercury was just a a
[15:10] big old hot cold so close to the Sun
[15:12] that nothing could live on it but we're
[15:14] positioned right in just the right
[15:18] spot let's look at real quick at Psalm
[15:20] 19 which tells of the of the
[15:27] heavens
[15:37] now you can kind of see the pattern here
[15:40] verses 1 to 4 this this first part talks
[15:43] about the the heav theonomy and then
[15:46] this last part talks about the
[15:47] scriptures and it's compared them and
[15:50] you and you think when you read it he's
[15:51] changing topics when he Swit when he
[15:53] gets to verse seven when he starts
[15:55] talking about the scriptures he's
[15:56] talking about something else but he's
[15:58] talking about the same thing Jack have a
[16:00] question yeah I get up really early in
[16:03] the morning sometimes you see that Moon
[16:05] and all the stars seem like that fade
[16:07] away but you see one star which is north
[16:09] star
[16:11] mhm what that shining
[16:14] star so let's uh let's read through this
[16:17] real quickly uh the heavens declare the
[16:20] glory of God and the firmament showeth
[16:22] his
[16:23] handiwork day unto Day utth speech and
[16:26] night unto night showeth knowledge
[16:29] every day when the sun comes up
[16:31] Resurrection every night you're going to
[16:33] have to die use your time wisely um
[16:36] you're going to have to die unless you
[16:37] go in the Rapture yes uh there is no
[16:40] speech nor language where their voice is
[16:43] not heard all over the Earth the heavens
[16:45] testify of God's glory and of his of
[16:49] redemption their line is gone out
[16:51] through all the Earth their measurement
[16:54] uh you're going to have to answer one
[16:56] day for uh judgment is what this story
[16:58] is that there's a redeemer and and it's
[17:01] the same story that is told in this
[17:04] Bible that's why we don't have to look
[17:06] at the stars now because that same story
[17:09] was first told in the heavens now it's
[17:11] and then it was told in the pyramid it
[17:13] was magnified and now it's told in this
[17:15] Bible magnified even greater and
[17:17] greater their Ling has gone out through
[17:19] all the Earth and their words to the end
[17:21] of the world in them hath he said a
[17:22] tabernacle for the sun which is as a
[17:25] bridegroom coming out of his chamber and
[17:28] rejoice rejoices as a strong man to run
[17:30] a race his going forth is from the end
[17:34] of the heaven and his circuit into the
[17:36] ends of it and there is nothing hid from
[17:39] the heat
[17:40] thereof now verse seven swi to talk
[17:43] about the scriptures and how the same
[17:45] thing applies to God's word here that
[17:48] we're reading the law of the Lord is
[17:50] perfect converting the soul the
[17:51] testimony of the Lord is sure making
[17:54] wise the simple the statutes of the Lord
[17:56] are right rejoicing the heart the
[17:58] Commandment of the Lord is pure
[18:00] enlightening the
[18:01] eyes the fear of the Lord is clean
[18:04] enduring forever the judgments of the
[18:06] Lord are true and righteous altogether
[18:09] more to be desired are they than gold
[18:10] yet and much fine gold sweeter also than
[18:13] honey and the honeycomb moreover by them
[18:15] is thy servant warned and in keeping of
[18:18] them there is great reward we warned by
[18:22] the reading of the scripture just the
[18:23] same way the Ancients were warned by
[18:25] looking at the stars for 2,000 years or
[18:28] so so before Moses began to write the
[18:30] scripture the Stars testified of that a
[18:34] redeemer would have to come who can
[18:37] understand his errors cleanse thou me
[18:39] from Secret faults keep back thy servant
[18:40] also from presumptuous sins let him not
[18:42] let him not have dominion over me then
[18:44] shall I be upright and I shall be
[18:46] innocent from the great transgression
[18:48] let the words of my mouth and the
[18:50] meditation of my heart be acceptable in
[18:52] thy sight oh Lord my strength amen and
[18:54] my
[18:55] redeemer then Psalm 147 for he said he
[18:58] tell the number of the Stars he calleth
[19:00] them all by their names every Star God
[19:04] gave a name and some of the names of the
[19:05] stars are written in the
[19:07] Bible in job 91 he said which maketh
[19:11] Arcturus Arcturus is the constellation
[19:13] boots and boots was the man that had a
[19:15] sickle in one hand and and a Shepherd
[19:17] staff in the other to both reap and to
[19:20] and to her the sheep and Orion Orion is
[19:24] the uh the the ancient acadians called
[19:28] called and the the light of Heaven the
[19:31] um coming down from heaven bringing
[19:33] Revelation and playes in the chambers of
[19:36] the South ples is a constellation that
[19:38] has seven
[19:39] stars job 26:13 by his Spirit ples the
[19:43] Ancients called that the congregation of
[19:45] the
[19:46] Lord job 2613 by his Spirit he hath
[19:49] garnished the heavens his hand ha formed
[19:52] the Crooked serpent serpent there's a
[19:54] big serpent that typifies that great
[19:56] battle that goes that went all all the
[19:58] way from Genesis to Revelation job 38:
[20:00] 31-32 can't thou bind the sweet
[20:03] influences of ples or loose the bands of
[20:06] Aran cast thou bring forth mazero in his
[20:09] season or C thou guide Arcturus with his
[20:13] sons a't that something Arcturus had
[20:15] sons and mazero is the zodiac sign that
[20:21] um I'm going talk about in if we have
[20:23] some time Amos 58 seek him that maketh
[20:26] the Seven Stars the Seven Stars as ples
[20:30] and Orion and turneth the shadow of
[20:32] death into the morning and maketh the
[20:33] day dark with night that calleth for the
[20:35] Waters of the sea and porth them out
[20:38] upon the face of the Earth the Lord is
[20:40] his
[20:42] name and brother R said the he talking
[20:45] about the ancient and as I got back into
[20:47] some of the ancient history this is in
[20:48] his wonders to perform 1958 such as his
[20:50] two bab on and many of the other ancient
[20:53] writers to study what these Magi I find
[20:56] out the Magis in India were really the
[20:57] means of the Persians that we were
[20:58] speaking of the other night in bu shar's
[21:00] Big Rock and Roll Party when the me of
[21:02] Persians took over the Babylonian
[21:03] Kingdom and they had immigrated and got
[21:05] up into India now the Indian is called
[21:07] the Untouchable but the Hindu is the
[21:09] Mido Persian and and in there they still
[21:12] have these Arts of the wise man now I
[21:15] find that these Magis were not these
[21:17] type of fellas today that take the stars
[21:19] and tell
[21:20] fortunes cuz taking the stars and trying
[21:23] to look at yourself is the opposite of
[21:25] what you should be doing or what they
[21:27] they back then when that was their Bible
[21:29] when they were looking at that it should
[21:30] have been telling of Christ the Redeemer
[21:33] and the story of redemption but they
[21:35] were scientific men who watched the
[21:36] heavenly bodies and could look know
[21:38] every little star that was visible to
[21:40] the human eye and they were pure in
[21:42] heart any little move it meant some
[21:44] spiritual significance that meant
[21:47] something let's look at uh for they had
[21:50] learned in J watching a star 1959 for
[21:53] they had learned in job and of the
[21:54] moving of the stars and the names of the
[21:56] stars and they watched for that that one
[21:58] true God to give them a Sign by the
[22:00] stars and they stud those Stars just
[22:03] like we study the Bible it was handed
[22:05] down Scrolls from ancient fathers that
[22:07] they studied those heavenly bodies and
[22:08] they knowed where everyone was and if
[22:10] one moved the least bit out of its place
[22:13] they knew it and I'm sure it bothered
[22:16] him a little bit cuz you want to have
[22:18] everything just like in uh when you hear
[22:22] someone teaching something that's a
[22:24] little bit off the word bother you you
[22:27] want to uh be real careful one day uh
[22:31] one day they were looking at the stars
[22:32] and they saw brother talked about how
[22:35] they they were looking up of the night
[22:36] sky and thinking about all the things
[22:38] that Daniel wrote about and uh they saw
[22:41] a strange star and then and they
[22:44] followed it when they got to their
[22:46] destination they tried to tell everybody
[22:48] about it but they were the only ones
[22:49] that could see what the message of that
[22:52] star where it was taking them and
[22:54] Josephus tells a story of how they look
[22:55] down in this well the same well that
[22:57] David dug
[22:58] and when they got to Bethlehem and they
[23:00] looked down in the well at the bottom of
[23:01] it they could see the reflection of that
[23:02] star and they knew that's how they knew
[23:04] that they were in the right place
[23:08] um so the star LED them to
[23:13] God now the zodiac is a um brother R
[23:16] talked about the Zodiac beginning with
[23:19] Virgo and ending with Leo the Lion and
[23:23] that's not the way that astrologers read
[23:24] it astrologers start at Aries and then
[23:26] at Pisces but it goes around in a circle
[23:29] and when you look up at the night sky
[23:31] the sun and the and the constellations
[23:33] are moving they're both moving but the
[23:35] sun moves faster and every month the sun
[23:39] moves in a line right through all the
[23:42] constellations and it touches on each
[23:43] one one after the
[23:46] other now over time after about 2,000
[23:48] years the Ancients knew that the uh
[23:52] constellations will begin to change a
[23:54] little bit the the the order of it
[23:56] there's a little bit of shift so that
[23:58] now we're um we're seeing the start of
[24:02] the year begins a couple of
[24:03] constellations over than what it did
[24:06] when uh you know two two or 3,00 years
[24:09] ago so they had to leave us a a way for
[24:12] us to know where it started is it's a
[24:15] never ending circle where do you start
[24:17] do you start at Aries like the
[24:18] astrologers say or do you start at
[24:21] Virgo and brother Brown knew that you
[24:24] started Virgo there's a temple in E
[24:26] Egyptian temple that uh was uh built in
[24:33] uh hundreds hundreds of years before
[24:35] Christ was
[24:37] born and in the in the top of this
[24:39] Temple there's a a little a little
[24:41] graphic of uh Virgo and Leo the Lion and
[24:44] it shows which direction to go because
[24:46] of the Sphinx the Sphinx has a woman's
[24:49] head and a lion's tail and it's pointing
[24:51] that way and so they say that's how you
[24:53] that's how that's the the riddle of the
[24:55] Sphinx is which way to how to read the
[24:59] uh the
[25:02] constellation and in Shalom the first
[25:05] Bible Shalom 1964 brother R said in the
[25:08] Zodiac we find out in the constellations
[25:10] of the stars that he declared the whole
[25:12] Bible in the constellation of the zodiac
[25:14] we find out there that he starts off the
[25:16] very first figure in the zodiac is the
[25:17] Virgin and the last figure in the zodiac
[25:19] is Leo the Lion showing that Jesus will
[25:22] come first to the Earth by a verion
[25:24] he'll come the second time as the lion
[25:26] of the tribe of Judah
[25:29] and he goes through the cross fish the
[25:31] cancer Aid what we're living in now and
[25:33] all the heav is declared and then uh he
[25:36] said and God's only provided place of
[25:38] worship did you notice that it starts
[25:39] off of the Virgin the first figure in
[25:40] the Zodiac the last figure is Leo the
[25:42] Lion he come first by the Virgin he
[25:45] comes next as the lion of the tribe of
[25:46] Judah just before that a cancer ra a
[25:48] cross fish all the rest of the ages if
[25:51] we had time to go through it which we
[25:53] have at the
[25:55] Tabernacle I don't I guess that's not
[25:57] record it CU must not be can't find it
[26:02] yeah so um in the 1800s this lady name
[26:06] by name of Francis Roland went back she
[26:08] spent her whole life going back to the
[26:10] ancient uh to to try to find what the
[26:14] meaning of the uh star signs she went
[26:17] back to find what the Ancients called
[26:19] the stars that were part of the
[26:20] constellation so uh just a real high
[26:23] level overview I wanted to quickly go
[26:25] through uh this the name of the stars in
[26:28] the
[26:29] constellation so uh in Virgo you got
[26:32] Stars called alimac which was Arabic for
[26:35] the branch SE there's another star
[26:37] called SE which means the
[26:40] Messiah uh there's another star called
[26:42] zavi jaave the gloriously beautiful and
[26:45] alamedan who shall come down there it's
[26:48] also there's also a calan word vend
[26:52] mediatrix the branch who cometh and so
[26:55] there's 12 there's 12 12 constellations
[26:59] in main constellations in the uh zodiac
[27:03] and in each constellation around them
[27:05] are uh two three or four small
[27:08] constellations that kind of are
[27:10] interwoven and they're all relate so
[27:12] serpents wraps around Ursa Miner to tell
[27:15] a story what why is the serpent wrapping
[27:17] around Ursa Minor and so they all
[27:20] interact when Orion comes up the
[27:23] Scorpion goes down you'll never see
[27:25] Orion and the Scorpion in the sky at the
[27:27] same time because when Aion comes the
[27:28] bringer of Life the Scorpion goes below
[27:31] the Horizon you can't see them together
[27:33] when scorpion goes up Orion goes down
[27:35] and vice versa so the constellations
[27:37] that are part of Virgo's coma the woman
[27:39] and child desired of all Nations sent
[27:41] Taurus despise sin offering and Boots
[27:44] that's the one archus that job talked
[27:46] about he cometh with his Shepherd's
[27:48] Crook and his
[27:51] sickle Libra is the scales in Hebrew
[27:55] maanam weighing in Arabic Al zua
[27:58] Redemption and UK and aad and tuu or the
[28:01] holy Altar and it it has these Stars Zu
[28:05] alui the purchase zuban chamali the
[28:07] price which covers zubab close is close
[28:10] to Centaurus the price of the conflict
[28:13] and in that Constellation Are the are
[28:15] the are the uh they called deacons the
[28:18] crooks the cross lupus the
[28:21] lamb s the lamb it's called the lamb in
[28:25] the ancient dendera zodiac and uh Corona
[28:28] the crown or
[28:30] Jewel and
[28:32] uh
[28:34] Scorpio and the the odd thing about it
[28:36] is and astrologist say that a Scorpio is
[28:39] represented by two animals it's the only
[28:41] one that's represented by two and the
[28:44] other the one the other animal that
[28:45] Scorpio is is the eagle so if you look
[28:48] at the the four corners of the zodiac
[28:51] you got Aquarius the man Taurus the Bull
[28:54] uh Scorpio the eagle and Leo the lion
[28:58] that represent the four corners of the
[29:01] zodiac blind man Ox Eagle MH and the
[29:04] stars that make up the Scorpion are Anar
[29:06] is the wounding and it's this deep red
[29:09] star in the center of the Scorpion and
[29:12] lth the perverse the star and the
[29:13] stinger and constellations that make up
[29:15] Scorpio are serpents and of ofus the
[29:18] struggle with the Enemy and Hercules the
[29:21] mighty one uh and there's a star in
[29:23] Hercules called Ral gey the head of him
[29:25] who bruises
[29:28] and you can kind of see how this all
[29:29] fits
[29:31] together wrestling with the serpent
[29:33] stepping on the head of the Scorpion see
[29:35] how they all fit together you got the
[29:38] scales over here just a beautiful story
[29:41] Sagittarius the redeemer's Triumph the
[29:43] beauty of the coming forth you got stars
[29:45] named name the gracious one nkey Prince
[29:47] of the earth now whoer they going or
[29:49] sending forth we just got a few seconds
[29:52] you can see the the con the 12
[29:55] constellations are divided up into
[29:56] groups of four four four four and the
[29:58] first four end with the defeat of Draco
[30:01] the dragon the second four end up with
[30:03] the uh cedus the sea monster leviathon B
[30:06] the third book ends with Hydra the old
[30:08] serpent destroyed so they're all four
[30:10] they're all three reading repeating that
[30:12] same story
[30:13] capricornus is the place of the
[30:16] sacrifice there's a star called dby the
[30:18] sacrifice slain ma mad Arab like the
[30:21] slave and it has constellations called
[30:24] Saga the arrow sent forth Aila the e
[30:27] wounded the dolphin Rising so the eagle
[30:30] goes down wounded and then Rises up in
[30:32] Resurrection
[30:35] delphinus and there there's so much in
[30:37] these constellations why why the uh the
[30:41] the last one was a part goat and part
[30:43] fish Redeeming the people that that were
[30:46] in him Dinda the sign of Aquarius is the
[30:51] a man with a with a bucket pouring out
[30:54] water s elet the record of the pouring
[30:56] for side out soon to pour out in numbers
[30:59] 24:7 it says he shall pour the water out
[31:01] of his buckets and his seed shall be in
[31:03] many Waters and his King shall be higher
[31:05] than a God and his kingdom shall be
[31:06] exalted in Isaiah 44:3 for I will pour
[31:10] water upon him that is thirsty and
[31:12] floods upon the dry ground I will pour
[31:14] my spirit upon thy seed and my blessing
[31:16] upon thine Offspring and the
[31:18] constellation and Aquarius areis
[31:20] australas a
[31:21] stream Pegasus he goeth and returneth
[31:24] who he ascended to his father and then
[31:26] so he could return in us and pour out
[31:29] his blessings and sness the blesser
[31:32] returneth and then uh real quick pises
[31:36] this is where the astrologers end the
[31:38] constellation but this is uh this isn't
[31:40] the end for the if you look at it the
[31:43] right way from Virgo to Leo the
[31:46] Egyptians call it P Orion the fishes of
[31:49] him that cometh and Hebrew D the fishes
[31:52] and O there's a star called OCTA that
[31:54] United and another star called alaka the
[31:57] H and the constellations that are part
[32:00] of B Pisces are the band binding cus the
[32:03] sea monster the band binds the fish
[32:05] together to the monster and androma the
[32:08] chain woman sfus the Redeemer coming to
[32:10] rule Hosea 11:4 said I drew them with
[32:12] cords of a man with bands of love and I
[32:14] was to them them as they take off they
[32:16] that take off the Yol on their jaws and
[32:19] I laid meat unto them and Isaiah 52 2:3
[32:22] Shake thyself from the dust arise and
[32:24] sit down Jerusalem loose thyself from
[32:26] the band of th neck o captive Daughter
[32:28] of Zion for thus sayith the Lord you
[32:30] have sold yourselves for not and ye
[32:32] shall be redeemed without money stop
[32:34] right all right
[32:49] amen
