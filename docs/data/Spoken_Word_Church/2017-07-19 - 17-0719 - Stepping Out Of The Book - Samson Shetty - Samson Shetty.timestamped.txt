[9:07] know in in perfect faith and you know
[9:12] identifications and all different one
[9:14] different messages isn't recognizing our
[9:18] position in the scriptures
[9:20] there's a divine identification amen and
[9:24] Jesus also said that it is written of me
[9:28] in the Bible so that means when the time
[9:34] has come when the season and over the
[9:37] age when when when he manifested himself
[9:42] this world that means is stepping out
[9:45] from the book praise the name of the
[9:49] Lord so it is written of me in the
[9:53] scripture stepping out of the book so my
[9:57] brothers and sisters I would like to
[9:59] read here quote question and answers
[10:01] 1964 brother Branham he said in
[10:04] paragraph 91-94 is it as wrong as you
[10:09] are in Christ you are in the Bible you
[10:13] are in him in the Bible as long as you
[10:17] are in Christ then you are in the
[10:19] fullness of the Bible praise the Lord
[10:23] as long as we are in the Christ as long
[10:27] as we are in the anointed Word of the
[10:31] power that means we are in the bride in
[10:34] the Bible amen
[10:36] praise the name of the Lord praise the
[10:38] Lord hallelujah can I take this yeah so
[10:42] my brothers and sisters this evening
[10:44] time so ah I need your prayers because
[10:51] I'm not I'm not used to preach in
[10:54] English language my language is
[10:56] different than here your language and I
[10:59] have got my accents and I've got my you
[11:02] know way of doing things and
[11:04] pronunciations and the words I don't
[11:07] know the very much English grammar but
[11:09] in a way the Holy Spirit is the speaker
[11:12] and he can use anyone he can anoint his
[11:17] ministers and he can put them on the
[11:21] spot and he can use them and for the
[11:24] benefits of the people of the bride of
[11:26] Jesus Christ so my brothers and sisters
[11:29] the divine identification to the
[11:31] believer is recognizing our
[11:34] position in the scriptures praise a lot
[11:37] we are you know identifying if we are
[11:40] identifying from with a group that's
[11:44] does don't do any good to us or for a
[11:48] certain denomination or a certain group
[11:51] of believers of a certain group of
[11:53] people or certain group of you know some
[11:56] kind of association or society or
[11:59] community that don't do any good but
[12:02] recognizing Buie we are in the scripture
[12:05] that's the great blessing to us amen
[12:08] that means stepping out from the book
[12:11] praise the name of the Lord that is it
[12:13] is written of me Amen praise the Lord
[12:16] hallelujah here I would like to just
[12:18] base I make I would like to lay some
[12:21] foundation for this message
[12:23] this evening time Daniel prophet Daniel
[12:27] pelegrin said is the scriptural prophet
[12:30] he always wants to know where he was and
[12:35] very easy and what age he is living in
[12:38] and he want to know he want to recognize
[12:42] his position he want to know the edge
[12:45] you know we want to know that
[12:47] circumstances and the situation's is
[12:49] growing through he want to know where he
[12:51] was at by the scriptures
[12:54] Amen praise the Lord Daniel you he
[12:57] understood various at in his day he said
[13:00] that I understood by books the number of
[13:05] the years wear off the word of the Lord
[13:08] came to Jeremiah the Prophet so the
[13:11] piece is searching the scriptures is
[13:13] searching the scroll is reading the
[13:15] scriptures and you want to know the
[13:18] outside world the people don't doesn't
[13:21] have the revelation of Jesus Christ they
[13:23] don't know where they are living in in
[13:26] the day the Daniel also you know if you
[13:30] compare with other people he is totally
[13:32] different in a scriptural man he the
[13:35] spiritual man is a prayer warrior he's
[13:38] looking unto God and he wants to know
[13:40] what's happening in his present world
[13:44] the scripture praise the Lord hallelujah
[13:48] he understood by the books the number of
[13:51] the years where of the word of the Lord
[13:53] came to Jeremiah the Prophet so why we
[13:56] are why would this all happening why
[13:58] would this going on why we are in this
[14:01] captivity and and the other false
[14:03] prophets and the denomination in that
[14:05] age you know in that world you know at
[14:07] the time they are thinking that is
[14:09] something you know this wasn't wrong
[14:13] you know something is not good but even
[14:17] he was searching the Scriptures he came
[14:19] to understand various add according to
[14:22] the scriptures he identified he
[14:25] recognized his position praise the Lord
[14:28] hallelujah and Virgin Mary recognized
[14:31] our position in the scriptures therefore
[14:34] the Lord himself shall give you a sign
[14:38] behold a virgin shall consume we're
[14:42] essential call his name Emmanuel the
[14:45] scripture didn't says behold a virgin
[14:48] mary concealed it didn't say like that
[14:51] he didn't mentioned the name of say
[14:54] america but when the time is caught when
[14:58] the season when women that age came that
[15:01] when she was praying in her room or in
[15:04] the her living room or you know she was
[15:06] you know meditating on God and she was
[15:09] relevant him said she was exactly
[15:11] reading the same scripture at the table
[15:15] the angel of the Lord appeared praise
[15:18] God the angel of the Lord appeared but
[15:21] well random said when you talk about the
[15:24] Lord he will come hallelujah when you
[15:28] want to see him even appear whenever you
[15:32] want when you have a great desire in
[15:34] your heart to see him to want to see him
[15:38] then he will appear to you to not my
[15:42] brother sister tonight here the
[15:44] scripture says therefore the Lord
[15:47] Himself show a sign here written it
[15:54] didn't say about you know it didn't
[15:57] mention about the name
[15:58] name of Mary but when she was reading
[16:02] one day the scripture and the angel of
[16:05] the Lord appeared in her room
[16:07] and he said Shalom praise the Lord
[16:12] she longed to you and she was looked
[16:15] around and what is this happening and
[16:17] what so he the angel of the Lord said
[16:20] you're going to have a son how could I
[16:23] come how come and that means she has to
[16:27] recognize her position which was written
[16:34] in the Holy Bible that means she has to
[16:38] step out from the written pages of the
[16:42] Bible and living epistle of Jesus Christ
[16:47] their divine word payment rates award
[16:51] hallelujah that means some it is written
[16:54] about you and me tonight also that is
[16:58] written about Virgin Mary and she's
[17:01] coming out from the Bible recognizing
[17:05] her position from the scriptures praise
[17:08] the Lord and the Bible says let's see
[17:10] John the Baptist they asked what they
[17:12] asked him here we see they asked unto
[17:14] him John the Baptist who are there who
[17:18] are there that we may give an answer to
[17:21] them that sent us these people came from

[17:33] that denominations and they went to the
[17:35] Prophet and they want to know who you
[17:37] are and what you want and what is going

[17:43] an answer to them in that sent us what
[17:45] says though of thyself right that the
[17:48] same question the Holy Spirit is
[17:50] speaking to our hearts tonight
