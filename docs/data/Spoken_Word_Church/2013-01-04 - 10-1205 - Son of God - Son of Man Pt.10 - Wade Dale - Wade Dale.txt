========================================

he today we're going to today we're going to talk about something no wait a minute today today we're going to talk about the children of the Kingdom or what the kingdom is so let's turn to Matthew I got so many stickers in here three Matthew 3 all right cuz we went through talking about last week about the New Creation new race of people in Acts 2 started what God wanted uh the word Kingdom means Reign or royal power also it's kind of funny that I looked in the Bible definition and strongs and the kingdom means to become king and queen so that sums up the whole thing both of them are a king that's what it says in SC in the strong concordance that the word Kingdom in the Bible when it's talking about Kingdom it is referring to to become king and queen of a domain kind of striking that God didn't want to leave himself out that's why that the kingdom only started on the day of Pentecost we're the only people that's married to Christ Abraham's not married to Christ Isaiah Jeremiah John the Baptist was not even married to Christ so that's why we're going to talk about this new kingdom in Chapter 3 of Matthew in those days Came John the Baptist preaching in the wilderness of Juda and saying repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so there was not a sure there was an Earthly Kingdom God's always had a kingdom um Earthly kingdoms through David and all the all the kings that ruled in in the Old Testament but that's not what God wanted God wanted a kingdom for him and his wife to re over remember he was married to Israel in the Old Testament but that's just a type because they were never born again but that was his wife but what did he do when she started hoing around just say in the natural Bible says except for fornication you can't put your wife away but if you catch her run around on you you can put her away and divorce her and marry again and be right y able to do so and uh so that's what God did he divorced them in the Old Testament looking forward to you and I in the New Testament but this Kingdom if you if you got Scofield bible he does a a really good job says the phrase Kingdom of Heaven is peculiar to Matthew and signifies the Messiah rule Earth rule of Jesus Christ the son of David it's called the kingdom of heaven because it's the rulle of the heaven over the Earth so here we got the man coming with the stone cut out without hands remember Daniel saw all these Earthly kingdoms but at the end he saw one stone break that whole image of that whole Earthly Kingdom all right so and and Jesus said I you know pilot asked him said and we'll read it in a minute said uh is your kingdom going to be of this Earth he said no my kingdom is not of this Earth my kingdom is of heaven so mat um John started out repent ye for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand and then we know that Matthew in the Book of Matthew Jesus starts preaching the kingdom uh pray like this Our Father who art in heaven Hallowed be thy name in other words thy kingdom come thy will be done the kingdom had not come yet the kingdom was in him but the kingdom had to get out and that's what happened in the book of Acts that's why that Jesus had to die to release the a life so that he could have a queen cuz where did where did um Eve come from Eve come out of Adam all right and that's why that you and I have to be born again to become that bride to go back in the side of Adam or the second Adam all right now let's turn to Matthew 11 oh wait a minute let's go Genesis 10 cuz this is where the first Kingdom the word Kingdom in the Bible this is the first time it's used and look who's used it because guess who wants to set up a kingdom first see always wanted to set up a kingdom first 10 Genesis 10 10 let's read verse eight and Kush now these are the sons of ham that came after the fall I mean after the flood and ham is one that brought sin across M because he did what he did to his father and Kush begot Nimrod he began to be mighty one on the earth now Nimrod is one that created Babylon he was a mighty Hunter before the Lord wherefore it is said even as Nimrod the mighty Hunter before the Lord and the beginning of his kingdom was Babel Satan began his kingdom at the Tower of Babel brother Bram will tell you that if you look at he he slops Two Babylons and in brother bram's reading you'll see that he organized he brought things together Nimrod was just like you see brother bandam typed him you see the the the Beast working in Genesis the Beast working in the middle and the Beast working in the end all right cuz it came from an organization in the beginning cuz right here Genesis 10 this is right you know right at the first of the book right after the flood they began to come together you know and U and they all spoke the same language and they remember what God did God confounded the language and that's what sent the people out all over the world that's what sent them out to populate the rest of the of the world so that's the first Kingdom set up and that was the kingdom of Satan cu the kingdom of God was started in the in the uh Garden of Eden God was beginning to build his kingdom in the Garden of Eden he put Adam and Eve there what husband and wife king and queen MH all right well when that got marred he couldn't do that anymore had to stop wait didn't bother God made sure that all his attributes would be displayed but that's what we're going back to King and Queen ruling in the Garden of Eden same thing all right and that was just striking to me that that um kingdom here that it talks about in the Bible especially in the New Testament the definition is to become king and queen of a domain not just King not just king king and queen all right so now let's go to Matthew 11 and John preached the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand John did not preach the Kingdom of Heaven everybody understand that John could not preach the Kingdom of Heaven because the Kingdom of Heaven Wasn't in him right the kingdom of heaven was in Jesus Christ he was preaching repent for the kingdom of heaven is coming right here Behold the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world coming all right now listen verse seven and what John let me give you a little behind this John the Baptist sends his disciples John's already in jail and he sends his disciples to ask Jesus are you the one that should come or do we look for another in other words John was brother BR said John's the Eagle Eye was filmed over he was doubting his own self now if John had been born again guess what would have happened now John was full of the Holy Ghost we read that last night in the Bible study for those of you that weren't here we John the Baptist was full of the Holy Ghost the Bible say filled with the holy ghost from his mother's womb but that was an anointing that was not a baptism of the Holy Ghost brother randam never said and the Bible never said John the Baptist received the new birth he received an anointing of the Holy Ghost on his Spirit to do a job now not to say John's Soul was black but John's Soul was not born again or he would have not ask this question are you the one or do we look for another that's the same man that stood in the Jordan River saw a man coming said Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world walks right up to him the Bible says John the Baptist was told when he sees this Dove or this Spirit descending on this man and remain that's the man that's going to restore the Kingdom right now several years later John's in prison Matthew 11 something happened to John John didn't backslide but the anointing had left him right his ministry was over it was done finished I've always said before think of this John and Jesus were cousins by what people could see we understand Jesus was no kin to anyone on Earth but Elizabeth and Mary were first cousins all right that made John and Jesus second cousin by by Earthly looking lineage all right and they probably grew up together and and then John at 9 years old went out in the desert remember and then when he they met back together but why didn't Jesus go get John out of prison he was just in there because because he went up to Herod and said told herod's wife he couldn't have that woman as his he Herod was going to marry his brother's wife you know John said can't do that that's all he was in prison for why didn't Jesus just go do some miracle and get his cousin out of the cuz that's the man that introduced him that's right Jesus knew that was the man cuz he said right here in in chapter 11: 7 what went out you to see a reed shaken in the wind but what when you out to see a man clothed in soft rment behold they that wear soft clothing are in King's houses but what went out to see him a prophet yeah I say unto you more than a prophet why didn't Jesus go get him out of jail he could have walked right into the court walked right up and got him out of jail and nobody ever said a word his Min he was finished right he was done God was finished with that man called John the Baptist because when you introduced like brother Rand said he said if the great one is on the scene I must in decrease decrease because here right now is even a group of people that are still Disciples of John some two years later they're still Disciples of John now if you last night the Bible study remember I read way over when Apollos was preaching in the book of Acts which was in what year was that in let's see it was in 8033 another two more years after this was ad31 according to the scofi two years later they're still Disciples of John and they're being taught by Apollos and Paul walks in and says have you received the Holy Ghost since you believe they said we don't know anything about the Holy Ghost we just know know that we were we're Disciples of John remember I read last night M Disciples of John the Baptist two some two to three years after all this event after Jesus had done died and all that why because John the Baptist was a great man they believed on John the Baptist Apollos was preaching by what John was saying that Jesus was the Christ so why didn't Jesus right here just say well let's go get him out of prison no for one he knew that that Ministry was over and the father didn't lead him to do it so his ministry was done and finished but there was no greater man let's read verse n but what went you out to see a prophet yeah I say unto you and more than a prophet for this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before my face which shall prepare thy way before thee verily I say unto you among them that are born of woman this is God speaking it has to be true this is not just Jesus without a word words remember when I preached partial to perfect what Jesus done was perfect that was the perfect will of God if it's written in this Bible it's the perfect will of God right all right verily I say unto you among them that are born of women there hath not risen a greater than John the Baptist now from John backwards look at all the great people Abraham Isaiah Jeremiah Moses that's St a my fa notwithstanding he that is least in the Kingdom of Heaven is greater than he and from the days of John the Baptist until now the Kingdom of Heaven suffereth violence and the violent take it by force that's what he was talking about now let's go to Luke and get another angle of this Luke 7 verse 24 and when the messengers of John were departed and he began to speak un the people concerning John what went you out in the wilderness for to seea read shaken with the wind but when he went out yet out for to see a man clothed in soft rment behold they which are gorgeously apparel and live delicately are in King's courts but what went you out for the see a prophet yeah I say unto you much more than a Prophet this is he of whom it is written behold I send my messenger before thy face which shall prepare thy way before thee for I say unto you among those that are born of women there is not a greater Prophet than John the Baptist but he that is least in the kingdom of God is greater than he now but the kingdom of God is the on that has the Holy Ghost right the kingdom of God was not in power yet the kingdom of God during this time was still bottled up in Jesus Christ he had to die to get it out so on the day of Pentecost 120 like we read last Sunday started the new creation new race New Kingdom of people cuz like we said last night in the Bible study you have to listen you have to hear the word you have to hear some kind of a sermon or a a witness or something before the Holy Ghost can fall on you because it has nothing to fall on uh it can't just fall on dry ground or or Barren ground it has to fall on good ground so they had to hear a sermon well theyve heard for three and A2 years that's what the disciples heard that was the Kingdom of Heaven out of three and 1/2 years there's been Untold billions of sermons doctrines false and true that have come out of that 3 and a half years that Jesus spoke but everything from the book of Acts all the way to the Book of Revelations was what it was based on what Jesus taught while he was here right you said oh well that they took some out of the Old Testament come on people who's the one who wrote that in the Old Testament right right the man that was standing on the shores of Galilee okay so Jesus wrote the entire Bible I believe I just believe Jesus Christ not the flesh the Jesus Christ the the God Almighty wrote this whole Bible sure it is all right and but he came had to come on Earth as a witness said for the least in the kingdom is greater than John the Baptist now what kingdom we just talked about a kingdom of heaven now let's turn to John 18 let's read the last thing Jesus said about this Kingdom all right this is the last thing Jesus said about the kingdom this is right before they crucify him all right verse 34 Jesus answered him saying thou sayest th oh sorry verse 33 pilate entered into the Judgment Hall again and called Jesus and said unto him art thou the king of the Jews Jesus answered him sayest thou this thing of thyself or did others tell it thee of me in other words are you coming up with this or did you hear it from somebody else pilot answered am I Jew thine own nation and the chief priest have deliver thee unto me what hast thou done in other words he did hear it from somebody else that's what he's telling Jesus uh your priest is the one that brought you here Jesus answered my kingdom is not of this world if my kingdom were of this world then would my servants fight see right then and there that's why the Bible said he died a l o n e he died alone there was nobody in his kingdom at that time on the Earth right nobody that's right they wish nobody to fight for him but he said if his kingdom was here if my servants my kingdom was here they'd fight for me but they're not that I should not Bel be delivered to the Jews but now is my kingdom not from hence in other words not here pilot therefore said unto him art thou a king then Jesus answered thou sayest that I am a king to this end I was born was I born and for this cause came I into the world that I should bear witness unto the truth everyone that is of the truth heareth my voice and a sheep and and another sheep or a goat they will not follow right so this Kingdom of Heaven was standing there in Jesus Christ but let's not get into the SE of the seed cuz we we've been over that and over that Jesus said there was a swer went out to seow and what did he sow sowed seed what he say the seed was seed was the word of God who sowed it the son of man what was the children that came up from that it was the children of the Kingdom right us the baptism of the Holy Ghost and The People's soul all right so what are we looking at Jesus was a king he was standing here in front of pilate and he said you say I'm a king and to this end I was born but he never said I am king and queen and I have this Kingdom set up he said my kingdom is not of this world why he didn't have a queen that's right he have a queen with him right eveil was still inside of him right eveeve could not reproduce Adam as long as Eve was inside of Adam right she had to come out of Adam to reproduce Adam right we had to come out of Jesus to reproduce Jesus Christ cuz this is still the law of reproduction law of reproduction is he told uh he told Adam and Eve to multiply and replenish the Earth right right before they were in flesh bodies see we think that that's oh that's sex we sex we sex is going to repopulate the world that's permissive will absolutely that's exactly what happened but that's not what Jesus was talking about or the Christ was talking about in Genesis 1:26 he wasn't talking about sexual birth no he was talking about being born again that to me Genesis 1:26 and 27 God was setting up his kingdom that is his kingdom because that's his bride that's who he was looking for at that time we were in theophany form in died that man but when he put Adam out and then took Eve out of Adam he was beginning to bring that Kingdom see he could say if we were to glean this in scripture and and go back into the mind of God God was saying just what John said but he don't at that time he didn't have to say repent John said repent for for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand Genesis 1 126 and 27 just says the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand CU we didn't have you don't have to repent Genesis 126 never had to repent of nothing right nothing that's God Eternal but he told us to multiply and replenish the Earth how the seed is the word so or so son of man son of man had to come to se the seed now because of the Fall once you get down to the fall then you got to do it this way God wanted it this way remember we was talking about last Wednesday night this is eternal God this long ribbon is eternal God everything's going to work back up to that but down here now is where all this is coming from the kingdom of heaven now has to come up out of what Born Again Believers just like we talked about last night why didn't Cornelius why didn't Apollos Apollos was preaching Jesus was the Christ he was getting converts he was baptizing them under John's baptism of regeneration why didn't they get the new birth cuz they didn't have it to give now does everybody understand that if you were here last night you ought to understood it cuz we really covered it really well last night but for those of you that weren't uh that New Birth come on to that Pentecost to a group of 120 people and that begun the kingdom of God right before that nobody had the new birth in their soul except Jesus Christ and it wasn't a new birth he was the birth right he didn't need a new birth he's born right the first time right okay he didn't need a new birth he Soul was almighty God okay ours comes in a fallen condition and has to be taken back but why didn't apalus and and Cornelius why didn't God just give him the Holy Ghost why didn't he just say well man that sure aren't preaching real good just like we were talking about um you know like U brother Claud and I were talking and somebody we were sitting in here this morning talking about it one old brother um Ray we were talking about people that really preach it's just nothing but just it's just like the reading room at at U at the latterday Saints or wherever they do that reading room thing at just you just reading like a newspaper that's right CU there's no New Birth well they can't you know they're preaching to a th people or or 15 people if they ain't got the new birth they definitely not going to get it for the congregation right now they congregation may go out and hear it and the word spark and they come back with new birth but I promise you one thing they won't stay in that church long if that Pastor ain't got the new birth right cuz you can't come together and degree except you be one right but God was starting in Genesis 1:26 that's what he started to do he started to build his kingdom Satan came into his domain into his kingdom and said I'm going to stop stop that cuz that's what he did he stopped a Son of God and a daughter of God from being born like they should have been born and that's what he's doing right now through spirituality spiritual birth he's trying to keep a son and daughter of God from being born again right that's been his Ploy since the Garden of Eden he just planted a natural seed into Eve through the Beast to pollute it so that God couldn't use it cuz remember he's a perverter Satan doesn't even have a seed cuz the is life Satan doesn't have life God created the devil right God gave the devil power but Satan can't create God's the only one that can take something and and out of from nothing and bring something out the devil has to take something that's already here right he had to take Eve and pervert the world through Eve he had to use a vehicle he couldn't have created a vile woman he can't create a vile man God does all the creating and Satan just perverse but that's the way God wanted it to to be happen in the garden so let's get it straight from the garden of of Eden when or before the Garden of Eden when Adam and Eve were together in theophany in in theophany form in Genesis 1:26 God told them to multiply and replenish the earth now the way they were going to do that was through spiritual multiplication just like we see now that this little church has come from 15 people to you know close to 100 sometime why if we're all born again spiritual multiplication that's right seed being planted being a birth becoming out of that that's exactly what Genesis 1:26 wanted that's what God wanted right but not in the form of us being in sinful flesh but through permissive will we had to come this way now because he had inside of him an attribute to be a Healer there's no way he could be display that attribute except somebody be sick so he allowed the fall to happen so he could be a savior a redeemer A Healer all these compound names Jehovah J and all Raa and all those things like that but that's not God wanted but remember watch it working back to God said multiply and replenish the Earth spiritual form here guess what it's come to same thing right here right right here was the same thing he said here as he's saying here multiply and replenish the Earth spiritual form multiply and replenish the Earth right here right Jesus said my kingdom is not of this world in other words I can't birth a child not until I get in a bride and he nurtured those 12 disciples and then remember last night as we were talking remember the Bible says the unclean Spirit goes out see that's what Jud that's why Judas had to leave cuz he had an unclean Spirit he had to go out before those other 11 could come to God cuz he was the one that was stopping them per se you know he was the one that was the evil one and once he went out they got together went in the upper room and then here was 12 disciples that went around the world changing the world because of that you just said do you think that we brother brand well that the unrighteous won't be able to sit in the congregation of the righteous do you think it'll literally come to that I think it literally happened brother Brown say somebody could come in and pollute the whole church by being unbeliever or have something in their life and it hinder the whole church cuz you said Anan and Safara come in too and that's the same what happened um ananas and safire were not U let me put it this way they were not they weren't committing adultery they weren't stealing I mean I mean they weren't per se they weren't they didn't go out and do something wrong they just sold what they had and didn't give all of it to Peter and them and they and then Peter asked the question if you reading Peter asked both of them the same question did you give all and and I said yes Peter said you've lied against the Holy Ghost he fell over dead and I think it's going to come to the same way we going to say you've been in this church 20 years you got the new birth yeah I got the new birth Earth Yep you going to have to produce it that's right or God's going to take you out right this place is going to be clean I ain't talking about just this place I'm talking about his kingdom his kingdom is going to be clean before this all gets over okay I mean it's like d said and that's true last night the reason we don't get a lot of things is because we're not close to God like we should and it's going to take persecution I'm afraid we're lay out to sin I don't matter if you full of the Holy Ghost from your toe to your nose you still we're just this is is the age we live in and but God knew it so he made a provision he's going to put us through some persecution that's right we got way too much and that's all of us brother brandham said he said you he said I fast before I come to a service during the day he said I fast and pray for two to three hours they come and get me out of the motel I go straight to the pull pit he said I don't talk to nobody he was telling one time that somebody did actually come in and and tried to shake his hand and say God bless you brother R started talking he said that took me he said it took me you know a long time he didn't say how long took me a long time to get myself back on track when not sure you say well that's a gift it should be all of us that's why I'm telling you if you come to church 5 minutes before the service starts or 15 minutes after you're hindering the service right I don't care if you're just the most spiritual person that ever lived on face this Earth you're hindering the service that's why brother bam said 20 minutes before service come in sit down clear your mind pray no we run in throwing stuff everywhere like he said have a fight with their wife or kids fighting in the back you know just that's just things that's going to happen cuz we're lay out to see it but when we ever do I read you that quote last night remember I read in the in the Christ the mystery of God revealed if the church ever all gets the Holy Ghost and they all get all this stuff out of the way she'll be a mighty Army so guess what's hindering us is us right now is what's hinding that's right and that's everybody I don't consecrate my life like I should none of y'all do I just don't think you do I right we don't we don't we don't put you know we don't even hardly put 10% of our life to study you know um and we're the greatest hindrance then it's not the preachers not hindering us it's us hindering so right let's get back on the positive the kingdom of heaven will be here whether we want it to be or not that's right all right I mean the Kingdom of Heaven part of it or not God's going to have a predestinate I read it last night in Christ the mystery God's going to have a bride period she's predestinated to stand she's predestinated to make it in this age and she's predestinated to get into the position she's supposed to get into so your choice is the election part you can either elect to get in it or you can elect to vote for the other guy right you know you bring the devil in or you bring God in it's our choice all the way and that's even hard for people to see that even people in the Statue of a perfect man that goes up that seems like that you know they're so spiritual they can just cut God off anytime they want to and that's the way we do cuz the Bible says grieve not the holy spirit so guess what we can grieve him it says grieve not the holy spirit of God whereby your seal brother R said he's very timid he's a gentleman right the Holy Ghost is a gentleman right remember dad's going to get on that but the Holy Ghost comes brother R say it's a sweet Spirit he said sometimes when that Angel's in the room he said you don't ask him a question what it's a little different that angel is not the Holy Ghost right that angel was somebody sent from God to direct brother randam right but that angel never gave brother randam a revelation of nothing that's right he told him where to find it in the scripture brother brand went and read it in the scripture and the Holy Ghost Inside of brother Bram said that's right right brother Bram just didn't walk in out and say well bless God I had an angel walk through the door and I'm going to preach serpent seat read the read the 1959 he said I studied all day he said I went in back in the scriptures and saw how it tied together all down to the scripture what happened the Holy Ghost then quickened what was inside of him wasn't the angel quickening nothing an angel can't give you anything we're supposed to be greater than the angel right the Holy Ghost Inside of us is greater than the angel because the Holy Ghost Inside of us created that angel right and let Dad get into that so that that's that's okay but let's go back to the kingdom the kingdom of God is now being produced through seven Church ages through seven Messengers through all the people that are in that age some of them look like they just barely made it and you know what brother Bram told us he said some of us will just barely make it that's right by the skin of our teeth and that's okay as long as you make it that's right that's right long as you make it David said let me be a doorm in the house of God at least he was in the house that's right right you know just get me in the house Lord I you know I don't like Brother Ray said he didn't have a call to preach and he thank God for that people told him he'd been the message for 40 years seniority don't make you a preacher I'll promise you that it is good that you have some seniority and you're a preacher it is but like Brother Ray said he said I don't have a call you know what that's good yeah that's all right ain't a thing as long as he knows that right that's better than these people that don't know it and go get in a pull pit can Daddy called and Mama s right he's our brother that's important exactly well we can't all like you know Paul said we can't all be of this and of this and of this and of this no just doing the little things of God that's that's part of the Kingdom cuz the kingdom is really not just just the king and queen it's the king and queen of a domain and a domain is people places houses economy you say God's got an economy absolutely he's got a perfect economy no money involved that's right no money involved that the scriptures what we use economy of God sure what we use for to make our economy we going to walk on so but the kingdom of God is within then that's what we'll start on next week I mean not next week brother Joe's got next week cuz brother Donnie and myself and Dad will be leaving Monday pray for us that we'll get a de and come back before Saturday but then after that we will talk about the Kingdom of Heaven is within but the Kingdom of Heaven is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and all that goes with it look y'all can get it de early but y'all didn't stay amen till Saturday amen sister that's the internet you know I really feel L love well I can't throw away all your stuff do
