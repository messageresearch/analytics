[0:01] we're going to
[0:05] read second
[0:14] peter chapter one
[0:26] then we're going to
[0:28] look at sister shepard's dream today
[0:31] which is in blasphemy's name all right
[0:34] second
[0:34] peter
[0:35] 1
[0:38] simon peter servant apostle jesus christ
[0:40] to them that have have obtained
[0:43] like precious faith
[0:44] with us through the righteousness of god
[0:46] and our savior jesus christ for grace
[0:48] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[0:50] the knowledge of god in jesus our lord
[0:52] according as his divine power hath given
[0:54] unto us all things that pertain to the
[0:56] life and godliness through the knowledge
[0:59] of him
[1:00] that have called us to glory and virtue
[1:02] whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:04] great and precious promises
[1:06] that by these you might be partakers of
[1:08] the divine nature having escaped the
[1:10] corruption that is in the world through
[1:11] lust
[1:12] all right and besides this so besides
[1:15] you you are you get born again besides
[1:17] this born-again experience
[1:19] this is an addition too everybody
[1:21] understand that
[1:22] this is an addition to
[1:26] this is telling us that the newborn
[1:28] you've got to get this is what you got
[1:29] to get the new birth
[1:31] and look at verse 5. and beside this
[1:34] what besides that new birth
[1:37] add to your new birth
[1:41] yes
[1:42] virtue
[1:44] add to you and your birth knowledge
[1:47] temper patience godless brothers
[1:50] now you get everything you need there's
[1:52] a quote you get everything you need at
[1:54] the new birth
[1:56] that's right
[1:58] jonas has everything he needs to drive a
[2:00] car
[2:03] right
[2:04] except for
[2:06] growth development
[2:08] virtual knowledge temperatures in the
[2:10] natural
[2:11] before he's able to drive a car he's got
[2:13] to gain some knowledge he's got to grow
[2:15] up
[2:18] so that's what we have to do as
[2:19] christians
[2:21] and you'll you'll find there's a lot of
[2:23] people in the message that don't agree
[2:24] with this they think you get everything
[2:26] because brother brown does say you get
[2:27] everything for your journey after your
[2:29] birth
[2:30] well a kid gets everything he needs when
[2:32] he's a baby
[2:34] but that baby's not going to stay a baby
[2:38] he's going to grow up in god all right
[2:41] and that says besides this what besides
[2:43] receiving the new birth
[2:46] add to your new birth
[2:48] or what you believe
[2:51] virtue knowledge knowledge temperance
[2:53] temperatures places goddess godless
[2:55] brother kindness and brother kindness
[2:58] charity for if these things be in you
[3:00] and abound
[3:01] overflowing what we're going to look at
[3:03] today they make you that you shall
[3:05] neither be barren nor unfruitful in the
[3:06] knowledge of our lord jesus christ
[3:08] but he that lacketh these things is
[3:10] blind
[3:12] quit feeding jonas and he's going to be
[3:16] his growth is going to be stunted
[3:18] his nutrition's going to go down he's
[3:20] going to get sick maybe he's even going
[3:22] to die all right
[3:24] but now he's still a human
[3:26] he's still born into the family of
[3:28] canada everybody understand what i'm
[3:29] saying even though you're born into the
[3:31] family of god
[3:33] you can stop your growth development at
[3:35] any time by not eating
[3:38] and then if you eat on the things of the
[3:39] world like brother brown says you get
[3:41] perverted
[3:42] or you get stunted
[3:44] or or your your growth is not what it
[3:47] should be all right so these are
[3:49] requirements but he that lack of these
[3:50] things is blind and cannot see it far
[3:53] off and has forgotten that he was purged
[3:56] from his old sins wherefore the rather
[3:57] brethren give diligence that you make
[4:00] your calling and election sure
[4:03] for if you do these things you shall
[4:05] never fall
[4:06] right
[4:08] well now
[4:09] sister shepherd
[4:11] was a sister in brother brown's church
[4:13] and on blasphemous names
[4:15] she was worried whether she had the holy
[4:17] ghost or not
[4:18] when she laid down across the beautiful
[4:20] where her husband was reading a paper
[4:23] she's got little ones that i have and
[4:24] they're always making noise and things
[4:26] and so on she fell asleep for 10 minutes
[4:28] or 15 and she dreamed
[4:30] and she never could understand it or get
[4:32] it all together
[4:34] from a year ago almost until this
[4:36] message was taught now what is
[4:38] blasphemous names it's a higher brother
[4:41] brown goes to a higher degree he
[4:43] preaches this right after he preaches
[4:44] the statue of a perfect man
[4:47] if i understand that you get the book
[4:49] blasphemous names he goes right back
[4:50] into the statue of a perfect man and
[4:52] starts talking about faith's virgin
[4:54] knowledge temperatures and that's what
[4:56] he's saying right here
[4:57] and she never could understand it or get
[4:59] it all together from a year ago almost
[5:00] until this message was taught
[5:03] then while i was teaching it it all came
[5:05] back to her now that was when he drew
[5:06] the pyramid and taught on the statue of
[5:08] a perfect man and she dreamed that she
[5:11] was praying she was walking the floor
[5:13] first
[5:15] before she dreamed and ringing her hands
[5:17] and thinking lord have i got the holy
[5:18] ghost
[5:20] okay so now watch what he's
[5:22] doing can you prove to me some say
[5:25] because i shouted or because i spoke in
[5:27] tongues and believing all that
[5:29] but have i really got it
[5:34] i believe in all those things those
[5:35] virtues speaking in tongues shouting all
[5:37] kind of demonstrations i believe in
[5:39] every bit of it
[5:40] but if if it's there without this
[5:44] in other words the new birth if it's
[5:45] there without this
[5:47] there's something wrong see now see you
[5:49] see you've got a
[5:51] shell
[5:53] see that a shell
[5:56] right
[5:57] see what he's saying watch let's analyze
[5:59] this a minute and she was worried about
[6:01] it
[6:02] so she just laid down across the do a
[6:04] photo where her husband was reading she
[6:05] went to sleep and she dreamed she was on
[6:07] a mountain
[6:10] okay
[6:11] and the best i haven't got on paper
[6:13] before me but i think
[6:16] it like this she dreamed that she saw a
[6:19] rock box
[6:20] like a framework sitting right on top of
[6:22] this mountain
[6:24] and her husband was just behind her
[6:27] and she saw a large man standing there
[6:29] with work clothes on sleeves rolled up
[6:31] bailing the most pure water that she
[6:32] ever seen pouring it into the box
[6:35] all right pouring it into the box
[6:38] okay
[6:39] the rock box sitting on top of the
[6:41] mountain and the rock box would not hold
[6:42] the water
[6:45] all right
[6:49] holes in it
[6:52] our experience wasn't rock solid
[6:54] have some holes in it
[6:56] but look we have the rock box
[6:59] she had the rock box she had the
[7:01] confession she had the new birth brother
[7:03] i was going to tell her that
[7:05] and the rock box would not hold the
[7:07] water and it rolled right out of there
[7:11] see just boiled up all the trash and
[7:14] sticks
[7:15] so as the water of the word goes in
[7:19] okay
[7:20] that rock solid box
[7:22] still
[7:23] has some problems
[7:25] humanity
[7:27] poured the water in it boiled all the
[7:29] trash and sticks and everything in there
[7:32] pulled it out and rolled it down the
[7:34] mountain
[7:35] all right
[7:37] and it rolled out over her feet she was
[7:39] standing right in that stuff only it
[7:41] didn't stick to her
[7:43] what the sticks and the stones and all
[7:45] or all that stuff i didn't stick to her
[7:50] and then she asked why the box didn't
[7:52] hold it the man said that is not water
[7:54] that's the holy ghost
[7:56] nothing will hold it
[7:59] then he went back and got another bucket
[8:01] and it was full of honey
[8:04] and poured the honey in there and said
[8:05] now it will hold this
[8:08] now look
[8:10] go ahead
[8:14] this is the box all right everybody said
[8:16] this is the box he's talking about
[8:19] pouring in and the stuff coming out now
[8:21] brother brown i'm in the statue of a
[8:22] perfect man we'll get to it later
[8:25] this is the honey now you got the new
[8:26] she had a new birth
[8:28] because she had a rock solid box it was
[8:30] her confession she had her confession
[8:32] but there was other things that had to
[8:34] come out all right
[8:36] this is the honey because watch what he
[8:38] says he said you get all these things
[8:40] here he'll say you up here and you don't
[8:42] have the holy spirit well you don't have
[8:43] the fullness of the holy ghost you're
[8:44] not a full adult you've got all the
[8:46] parts you've got all the working
[8:47] mechanism you just can't drive the car
[8:49] yet because what you're doing is you're
[8:51] looking at adoption adoption is not when
[8:53] you're a baby
[8:55] adoption is when you come to something
[8:58] jesus even on the river jordan he said
[9:00] this is my beloved son and whom i'm
[9:01] pleased to dwell stopped right there
[9:03] jesus had to go three and a half years
[9:05] before god took him upon a mountain and
[9:07] said this is my beloved son and whom i'm
[9:08] well pleased hear ye him all right
[9:11] that's the adoption part the adoption
[9:13] part is not when you get born again you
[9:15] have the spirit of adoption remember
[9:17] romans eight you have the spirit of
[9:19] adoption you're in the line of adoption
[9:21] in other words you've got in the right
[9:22] family
[9:24] you've got to get in the right family to
[9:25] be adopted all right
[9:27] so now you come here and this is the
[9:29] honey that you're going to see that he
[9:31] pours out and what you're going to do
[9:33] brother brown said the holy spirit seals
[9:36] these virtues in all right
[9:40] so let's keep going
[9:43] it was full of honey and poured the
[9:44] honey in there and said now it will hold
[9:46] this
[9:46] and she thought the box with the rock
[9:48] box was going to burst out and spill the
[9:50] honey but it didn't it finally stuck
[9:52] together
[9:54] and it held it
[9:56] she turned and went down the mountain
[9:58] going down the mountain she stopped at
[9:59] the bottom of the mountain and looked
[10:00] back she saw five streams
[10:03] of pure crystal water not contaminated
[10:05] by the things that it went through still
[10:07] pure clear coming swiftly then it slowed
[10:10] up then almost faded out and she was
[10:12] wondering would it never reach the
[10:13] bottom of the mountain five strings and
[10:15] she woke up
[10:16] right now he's going to give the
[10:18] interpretation
[10:20] now no more than i picked up the letter
[10:21] and opened it i saw the dream now this
[10:24] is a true prophet see the prophet a true
[10:26] prophet
[10:27] sees the dream himself before i read it
[10:30] he sees the dream and then he interprets
[10:31] it right that's what daniel that's what
[10:33] the problem with um
[10:35] with daniel the people in daniel's day
[10:37] was
[10:38] that
[10:41] remember the people walked up to the
[10:42] king and said oh king
[10:44] tell us your dream
[10:47] he said if you're anything you're
[10:48] supposed to tell me the drink well
[10:50] daniel walks up and said here's the
[10:51] dream and the interpretation so brother
[10:53] brown gives the dream and the
[10:54] interpretation
[10:56] which is the way of a true prophet right
[11:01] now no more than i picked up the letter
[11:02] note before it i saw our dream that's
[11:04] the way dreams are interpreted and many
[11:06] viewers come with me with dreams and say
[11:08] things to me about dreams i say wait a
[11:09] minute you never told it all see and go
[11:12] back and pick it up and if you can't
[11:13] tell what you dream how you know the
[11:14] interpretation is right or not see
[11:17] you've got to see the dream a vision has
[11:19] to show the dream and when you see the
[11:21] dream that the person dream that can
[11:22] tell them before they tell you
[11:25] then you know the interpretation
[11:27] well i believe that's in the scripture
[11:29] also daniel one time all right there's
[11:30] daniel
[11:35] a person would start telling brother
[11:36] about him a dream and he'd just stop him
[11:38] and say wait a minute you missed so and
[11:39] so we're so-and-so so and so then they
[11:42] say that's right all right
[11:44] now
[11:46] here's the interpretation of her dream
[11:48] she was bothered about the holy spirit
[11:50] now as much that she'd been she had seen
[11:52] the box on top of the mountain was the
[11:54] rock rock box and rock confession she
[11:58] had a confession say now like jesus said
[12:00] in the scripture said peter who jesus
[12:02] said who does man say out of the son of
[12:04] man lamb
[12:05] one of them says they are the lies of
[12:07] moses and so forth and he said but who
[12:09] do you say he said thou art to christ
[12:11] now some people say the catholic church
[12:13] he goes on and talks about that
[12:19] that's when each church age has had
[12:20] their rock confession now what did the
[12:22] church age have the holy ghost right
[12:25] holy ghost in every age all right now
[12:29] on up to this rock confession of the
[12:31] laodicea and now you cannot make a holy
[12:34] church there's no such thing as a holy
[12:35] church the holy spirit can be preached
[12:37] in it but in there you find good and bad
[12:39] renegades and different and everything
[12:41] else
[12:42] so an organization will not hold
[12:45] you can't say we got it none of the rest
[12:46] has it the holy spirit is poured out on
[12:48] what
[12:50] individuals it's the individual this is
[12:52] her individual dream now i believe it
[12:54] was all of us but it was too hard she
[12:55] had a question
[12:56] god answered a question
[12:58] so therefore the rock this latter-day
[13:00] pentecostal church which has received
[13:02] the holy spirit they did it the first
[13:03] all down through the ages they received
[13:04] the holy spirit but not in the measure
[13:06] that they have it now
[13:09] right
[13:10] they didn't have these virtues working
[13:12] in their life except in the first stage
[13:13] but that was all
[13:15] eat down eroded man's ideas like what
[13:18] we're talking about last night man's
[13:19] ideas has put a lid on it so it can't
[13:21] work now in the end time
[13:23] we're we're required
[13:26] it was a requirement when peter said it
[13:29] back in a.d whatever that was
[13:32] back in 80 60
[13:36] it was a requirement
[13:38] but nobody could come to that because of
[13:40] what
[13:43] those five streams to me
[13:46] also represents the fivefold ministry
[13:49] because they bring the washing of the
[13:50] word of the word right
[13:52] you can say grace or jesus wherever you
[13:54] want but it's a five-fold ministry
[13:56] you've got to hear it from somebody
[13:57] before you can get it right all right
[13:59] it's got to be fivefold of it not one
[14:02] all right so my brother brown had to go
[14:03] off the scene so a fivefold ministry
[14:05] could take the voice
[14:07] and break it down to the people
[14:10] they received the holy spirit but not in
[14:11] the measure that they have it now it's
[14:13] the same holy ghost but it's not in the
[14:15] same measure all right
[14:17] because it's a restoration of the first
[14:21] and we take the candlesticks alpha and
[14:23] omega how they lit the first candle went
[14:25] higher got dimmer dimmer then they come
[14:27] back again first and last
[14:29] so forth what's he saying the first
[14:30] church age had it
[14:32] now the last church age is supposed to
[14:34] have it all right
[14:35] now but in this church age the message
[14:37] is being poured into the church
[14:40] but the church body itself and all
[14:42] together like this tabernacle will say
[14:44] that's where she comes to church this
[14:46] tabernacle is not a holy ghost
[14:47] tabernacle there's no such a thing
[14:50] individuals that come into this church
[14:52] is holy ghost tabernacle
[14:54] they are tabernacles that contain the
[14:55] holy ghost but not the church in the
[14:58] body a group
[15:01] therefore it runs out
[15:03] but what this man who was pouring the
[15:05] water the messenger to the church that
[15:07] was him
[15:09] but he's not going to tell you it was
[15:10] him he's gonna say it's the messenger to
[15:12] the church because he's not gonna bring
[15:13] any light on himself right
[15:16] a true prophet always points you to
[15:17] christ
[15:19] so he's pouring the message into the
[15:21] church but what was the water doing it
[15:22] was boiling out all the trash that was
[15:24] in it that's what the holy spirit does
[15:29] now you take it to somebody
[15:32] that
[15:33] that believes that you get everything at
[15:35] the new birth
[15:36] down at the bottom and you get all these
[15:37] virtues and you're adopted reading my
[15:39] quote right there where's the trash at
[15:44] i mean if you got the holy ghost and
[15:45] that's all you need and that's all you
[15:46] got where's the trash
[15:50] the trash is in your spirit and in your
[15:52] body yeah actually it's not your body
[15:54] your body just does what your fear tells
[15:56] you today that's right it's actually the
[15:57] spirit guy that's right okay your soul
[16:00] is redeemed your soul just as eternal as
[16:02] god is but god's got to work on boiling
[16:04] out the trash that was in it that's what
[16:08] the holy ghost does it boils it up now
[16:11] now the honey represented brotherly love
[16:13] brotherly kindness which is this age
[16:15] right
[16:16] i just got through telling sea of
[16:18] brotherly kindness the age that we live
[16:19] in now
[16:21] now you might say
[16:23] look i sure don't like brother neville
[16:25] or i sure don't like brother jones i
[16:26] don't like brother so-and-so and
[16:27] something like that
[16:28] just let something happen to him brother
[16:30] your heart is broken nearly kills you
[16:32] see we can obtain
[16:34] obtain he said we had it
[16:38] see that bob
[16:40] he said we obtained it
[16:42] we didn't have it we obtained it right
[16:45] we can obtain brotherly kindness right
[16:48] and feel for one another
[16:52] because let me let me really
[16:54] you know we're all a bunch of legalists
[16:56] when we first get born again it's always
[16:58] do's and don't do this don't do that and
[16:59] this one's not doing this rightness i'm
[17:01] not doing that right
[17:03] and you're not doing this right you're
[17:04] not well that's what we are we just
[17:07] we're under the log
[17:09] right until christ comes but when christ
[17:11] comes it's not a total chopping off we
[17:13] receive the holy ghost but there's still
[17:14] things like daddy's been saying our
[17:16] memory and our reasoning what is that a
[17:19] lot of stuff in the past
[17:22] memory
[17:23] we can't remember something we haven't
[17:25] done
[17:26] so we can't remember the future
[17:28] right god can show us things in the
[17:30] future but that's through the holy ghost
[17:33] but memory
[17:34] reason we reason about what we know
[17:37] right
[17:38] conscious what does our conscience
[17:40] bother us about what's going to happen
[17:41] tomorrow no
[17:43] it
[17:44] bothers us about what happened yesterday
[17:48] imagination now we can imagine something
[17:50] going to happen but what are you
[17:51] imagining it from what happened in the
[17:53] past
[17:54] i wasn't going this way so this this is
[17:56] good though because what daddy said
[17:57] about the past
[17:58] everything in your spirit realm deals
[18:01] even affection
[18:04] how do i know i love somebody
[18:08] the experience i had in the past with
[18:10] them
[18:11] right right so all that memory reason
[18:13] conscious affection imagination those
[18:15] five senses in the spirit realm all is
[18:17] contacting backwards
[18:19] which is contrary to god
[18:22] right he don't want you to look back
[18:23] that's good that's true got it he won't
[18:25] want you to look back he wants you to
[18:26] look forward by the holy ghost that'll
[18:28] teach you things to come now that
[18:30] promise he promised he'd teach us things
[18:32] to come but see what we got to do is
[18:34] look through the eye of faith not
[18:35] through the eyes that mom and daddy gave
[18:37] us
[18:40] look through the eye of faith and forget
[18:41] the eye what mom and dad gave because i
[18:43] mom and daddy gave us to swear
[18:45] you remember something because you
[18:48] saw it or hear it see you taste phil
[18:50] smelling here
[18:51] you remember something's hot because you
[18:52] felt it
[18:54] you've experienced that well god's
[18:56] trying to tell us here he's saying hey
[18:58] you can obtain brotherly kindness
[19:01] and feelings for one another you obtain
[19:03] it you don't just have it
[19:06] okay
[19:06] but to maintain in a group of people
[19:09] why do you care for that brother because
[19:10] you broke bread with him here at the
[19:12] altar
[19:14] as you will tonight you fellowship with
[19:16] him you shook his hand you worship with
[19:18] him
[19:18] he's your brother
[19:20] and he might do something in the flesh
[19:21] that you would disagree with but you
[19:23] just kind of stay
[19:24] which you ought to do but shun him a
[19:26] little don't do
[19:28] but he said you kind of stay in other
[19:30] words he was trying to try and stay he's
[19:31] kind of stay away from him that's right
[19:33] that's what he was saying i'm not trying
[19:34] to put words in his mouth but read that
[19:36] because you just kind of stay what stay
[19:38] away from him and he said no you
[19:39] shouldn't do that
[19:41] but shut him a little but in the bottom
[19:43] of your heart if something happened to
[19:44] that brother neither kill you or that
[19:46] sister
[19:47] i'm an old man i was once young now i'm
[19:49] old i've seen it down through the age do
[19:51] that
[19:53] hear people say i just won't have no
[19:54] more to do with him and something
[19:55] happens to that man that nearly kills
[19:57] him he thinks oh god i let my precious
[19:59] brother go without making friends with
[20:00] him you see see see it's brotherly love
[20:04] all right
[20:06] my computer security is fine leave me
[20:08] alone
[20:16] get that trash out of there
[20:21] where was i oh you see see it's
[20:23] brotherly love it looks like it won't
[20:25] stick but it does stick the honey it
[20:27] sticks now in as much
[20:29] that she came from there down the hill
[20:32] to the bottom of the hill now this
[20:33] glorious water was gushing over hills
[20:35] and five strings now five is the number
[20:37] of grace
[20:38] j-u-s-u-s-f-a-i-p-s g-r-a-c five is the
[20:41] number of grace
[20:42] and like i said about the five-fold
[20:44] ministry
[20:45] that five-fold ministry is what to you
[20:48] g-r-a-c-e
[20:49] that's the grace of god did you even
[20:51] hear the people
[20:53] it's the grace of god that he leads you
[20:55] to a place where you can hear instead of
[20:57] just listening to one person you got a
[20:58] five-fold ministry that can help you all
[21:01] right five streams is pouring from up
[21:03] here at the trough
[21:04] down through here so there must have
[21:06] been listen
[21:08] there must have been some trash in here
[21:11] because this is where the trash come
[21:12] from the box
[21:15] the trash didn't come from out here the
[21:17] brother brown said the trash come from
[21:19] inside the box
[21:21] and then the trash come out
[21:24] and the water washed it down the side of
[21:26] the mountain all right everybody
[21:27] understand am i okay with that never got
[21:29] it yet
[21:31] could all of these things in a worldly
[21:33] sense be the trash that's going on
[21:35] that's your wisdom yeah
[21:38] absolutely
[21:39] see we have we have a lot of there
[21:42] there's people that you want to be
[21:43] around
[21:44] that has like jen's dad he's got worldly
[21:46] virtue about running business and making
[21:49] money
[21:50] but now that virtue is not virtue i want
[21:53] in the degree that i know that it's
[21:55] spiritual what this does it gives you
[21:57] what this does what the bible and what
[21:59] we're teaching and what the powerful
[22:00] ministry does it shows you how to
[22:02] separate the two
[22:04] see most denominational people think if
[22:06] you're if you're
[22:08] um
[22:09] if you're wealthy
[22:10] you must be of god right well
[22:14] it's not true
[22:16] you can be the wealthiest person in the
[22:17] world what jesus said he said it's kind
[22:18] of hard
[22:20] i was reading the other day a commentary
[22:21] and somebody wrote about
[22:22] could you imagine somebody standing
[22:24] around listening to what jesus said that
[22:26] it would be better to pull a camel
[22:30] through the eye of a needle
[22:32] than it would be for a rich man to go to
[22:35] heaven why because he leans to his money
[22:36] and he does all the time they didn't get
[22:38] their money
[22:40] but if you have these virtues what does
[22:42] it do it separates
[22:45] it separates that
[22:47] that's what that was doing what was it
[22:49] doing it was burning the trash out it
[22:51] wasn't burning the virtue out
[22:54] it's burning the trash out because
[22:55] virtue's not trash
[22:58] if it's holy ghost virtue
[23:01] if it's holy ghost knowledge
[23:04] it'll stick
[23:06] but there's a lot of trash in there
[23:07] that's got to come out because that's
[23:09] what that dream says all right look
[23:12] each one of these ages had that rock
[23:14] confession what the holy ghost so she
[23:16] had the rock
[23:18] what brother brown was trying to explain
[23:19] to her is that
[23:21] the holy ghost has got to be poured into
[23:23] the church so it can continue to wash us
[23:25] out
[23:26] each one of these agents had that rock
[23:28] confession the saints were sleeping
[23:29] waiting waiting waiting seeing home till
[23:31] this age but soon the holy ghost being
[23:33] poured out from christ will come and
[23:35] seal up the church all right now
[23:39] that's not down here
[23:41] that's right here he's referring right
[23:42] back to his to his chart where he wrote
[23:45] the holy spirit right here because if
[23:47] you read in the statue of perfect man
[23:50] the holy spirit here is what sealed
[23:52] these virtues in
[23:54] all right
[23:55] each one of these ages had that rock
[23:56] confession the saints sleeping waiting
[23:58] waiting but soon the holy ghost being
[23:59] poured out from christ will come and
[24:01] seal up the church then the church will
[24:03] be raptured
[24:04] it will be a complete unit of god
[24:07] a bride for christ who will be the head
[24:09] of all things
[24:10] you follow me now congregation says amen
[24:13] which i'd
[24:15] doubt
[24:16] now she was wondering now in her dream
[24:18] she was wondering would this little
[24:19] stream with this little stream ever get
[24:21] to the bottom
[24:22] see it was drying up now being that she
[24:24] she herself now here's what i want you
[24:27] to get to now she herself was wondering
[24:29] about her own self did she have the holy
[24:31] ghost now shawn's saying this a few days
[24:33] ago thinking that the church would be
[24:35] spiritual enough to catch it
[24:37] and maybe i put i better turn this tape
[24:40] off right now because i don't want it to
[24:41] get amongst brethren but you could speak
[24:43] with tongues shout dance cast out devils
[24:45] do anything you want and still not have
[24:47] the holy ghost
[24:49] didn't even disciples come back
[24:50] rejoicing
[24:51] because the devils were subject unto
[24:53] them and jesus right among them was
[24:55] judas
[24:56] jesus saying that day you'll cast out
[24:58] devils and i'll say depart from you by
[25:00] your fruits you'll be known now you say
[25:01] brother brown do we should we speak with
[25:03] tongues absolutely that's a gift
[25:05] but those gifts of god
[25:08] without these virtues
[25:11] makes a stumbling block to the
[25:13] unbeliever
[25:15] you see there
[25:17] these gifts of god without these virtues
[25:20] in them in other words the life it's
[25:21] going to go back to the looking at the
[25:23] life that's right remember the brother
[25:25] that he went to and the one brother
[25:27] speak in tongues and he would interpret
[25:29] and man he thought he was with angels
[25:31] and then the lord revealed to him that
[25:32] this guy was living with a woman and had
[25:34] babies by another person just living in
[25:36] total adultery
[25:39] and then god showed him you know the
[25:41] rain falls on it just in the unjust so
[25:43] that's what it is and then brother of
[25:45] animals say power without character is
[25:47] what satanic okay well power
[25:50] because this age
[25:52] joel said i'll pour out my spirit upon
[25:55] all flesh he didn't say just the bride
[25:57] he said i promise beard upon all flesh
[25:59] that's why brother brown had to preach
[26:00] in northern ones at ten times so that's
[26:01] what's coming in the end time it could
[26:03] be so close
[26:05] amen amen
[26:07] he's saying
[26:08] amen
[26:10] but these virtues here without this
[26:12] that's what says treaty was saying
[26:14] this virtue without character is satanic
[26:18] a man can use this virtue to make people
[26:21] prostitute their body
[26:24] you see people with charisma and sweat
[26:26] well they got virtue yeah there's some
[26:28] strength that's drawn because listen
[26:31] promise you one thing
[26:32] if there's one of these for god
[26:34] there's one of them for the devil
[26:37] right so power
[26:42] the holy spirit anointing
[26:44] without character
[26:46] is satanic
[26:48] okay you'd be anointed with the holy
[26:50] ghost every day your life remember on
[26:51] your spirit dying on hell
[26:54] and look like these virtues are working
[26:57] in a man's life but look
[26:59] they were all empty
[27:02] look
[27:04] it makes a stumbling block to the
[27:05] unbeliever
[27:07] it's not accepted by god
[27:09] all right
[27:10] this has to be first
[27:13] and when you have faith virtue knowledge
[27:14] temper spaces godless and brotherly love
[27:17] then the holy ghost comes down and seals
[27:20] you as a unit
[27:23] now a lot of people in the message
[27:24] believe that that you have to get all
[27:25] the virtues before you get the holy
[27:26] ghost but he just said
[27:28] read him where he says power without
[27:30] character
[27:31] it's satanic all right
[27:33] the holy ghost comes down and seals you
[27:35] as a unit not as a baby
[27:38] but as a unit
[27:40] the way he makes his bride is the way he
[27:42] makes his individual
[27:47] made out of same material like eve was
[27:50] made out of adam ripped from the side
[27:52] here is the things that you have to have
[27:55] first you can't impersonate them you
[27:57] can't imitate them they've got to be
[27:59] god's sin and god born imitation
[28:03] only causes
[28:05] confusion
[28:07] right seals you as a unity is that
[28:09] adoption
[28:10] yes
[28:12] there was a sentence that he did since
[28:14] the church seals the church age
[28:16] yeah back up
[28:22] back up 136
[28:24] yeah 136 right there it says
[28:28] those who knows it says u.s unit the
[28:30] same as he says the church
[28:33] okay
[28:34] what's the question
[28:44] well see all the churches were not
[28:46] adopted the only only the only people
[28:48] that adopted is people in the end time
[28:51] okay
[28:52] because
[28:53] the church ages most of them
[28:57] five up six of them actually
[29:00] didn't have all these virtues the the
[29:02] virtues were going out it you know when
[29:04] three
[29:05] when 325 a.d and 606 when they started
[29:07] bringing in
[29:08] uh father son holy ghost uh eternal hell
[29:11] and all the things that we kind of
[29:12] talked about last night
[29:14] it kind of took the birches down and
[29:16] then it was just you just got born again
[29:18] was about it now you just barely
[29:20] squeezed into the body all right
[29:22] and then but now see
[29:25] you come back up
[29:26] what he was saying about alpha and omega
[29:28] whatever was in the beginning has got to
[29:29] come to the end before it can
[29:31] be restored all right
[29:33] so look that's the way he makes his
[29:35] bride is the way he makes his individual
[29:36] made out of same material like he was
[29:38] made out of adam or rib from the side
[29:41] here's the thing that you have to have
[29:42] first
[29:45] you can't impersonate them
[29:47] you can't imitate them you've got to be
[29:49] godsend and god born imitation only
[29:52] causes confusion he talks about the
[29:54] buzzard but it has to come from the
[29:57] inside and it produces
[29:59] christianity
[30:01] god by the power of the holy spirit our
[30:03] sister had her feet wet when she got to
[30:05] the bottom all of us know sister shepard
[30:07] to be charitable her house is open
[30:09] brothers i don't care if it's a bum
[30:10] beggar
[30:11] oh god accepted that her foundation part
[30:15] you hear that feet her foundation part
[30:17] what birth she had the new birth faith
[30:20] right down at the bottom of the pyramid
[30:21] she had that but then all these other
[30:23] things happened all right
[30:27] it says here is what's wrong with the i
[30:29] turn on for this here's what's wrong
[30:31] with the branham tabernacle there's two
[30:33] different kinds of faith there's two
[30:35] different kinds of virtue
[30:38] right two different kinds of knowledge
[30:40] different kinds of temperaments
[30:42] one thinks it's prohibition thank god it
[30:45] ain't that kind of temperance that god
[30:46] is talking about it's that ungodly
[30:48] uncontrollable temper you got
[30:50] and things of that side
[30:52] fast back fuss
[30:53] patience and so forth there's a mockery
[30:56] of it and pretend to be a nature given
[30:59] faith and nature given virtues that's
[31:00] what i mean there's a nature given part
[31:02] of that but you guys see that that's
[31:06] burnt out
[31:08] dead
[31:10] not divorced
[31:11] dead
[31:12] and the biggest part of our faith is
[31:14] mental faith
[31:15] by hearing the word it brings us to a
[31:17] mental recognition of god that's why
[31:19] that like brothers dave was talking
[31:20] about last night the bible says in
[31:22] ezekiel i give you a new spirit well
[31:24] that's not the holy spirit that's just a
[31:25] spirit that makes you religious
[31:28] by bringing it by hearing the word it
[31:29] brings you to a mental recognition of
[31:31] god all right if you stay there that's
[31:33] not good but if you keep going on but if
[31:35] this coming from above oh brother if it
[31:38] ever strikes this there's a godly
[31:40] spiritual faith
[31:41] then what does that faith do that faith
[31:44] recognizes only the word no matter what
[31:45] anything else said don't recognize the
[31:47] word
[31:48] but then the beginning word word has
[31:49] been god where it was god the word is
[31:51] still god and the word was made flesh
[31:52] and dwelt among us
[31:54] when the word itself is pouring into our
[31:56] faith
[32:00] you hear that
[32:02] so you don't get it all
[32:04] you got to hear the word
[32:06] the word has it all right you've just
[32:08] got to get in there and let it what
[32:10] discern the thoughts and intents of your
[32:12] heart
[32:13] and the word was made flesh and draw the
[32:14] most when the word itself is poured into
[32:16] our faith our mental faith becomes a
[32:18] spiritual
[32:19] revelation right so let's go upstairs
[32:21] we'll finish this two sundays from now
[32:24] i'll be in new jersey y'all remembering
[32:26] your prayers leaving friday be back
[32:28] sunday afternoon kind of late so keep
[32:30] doing great
[32:31] i won't chew you
[32:33] you know what
[32:36] oh no all right
