TRANSCRIPT
========================================
now okay how's that 65. thank all y'all that came yesterday and cooked and fixed i want to thank you daddy will probably thank you 140 people 139 exactly there last night at the fellowship meetings so that was a record that's the most anybody ever come so we hope everybody's gonna get time isaiah 65. now what we've been doing just for background again what i've been doing is we've we started talking about the millennium and then it kind of struck me to kind of do a comparison between what is in the millennium and what is in the future home what is the similarities and what's the total difference between each one the millennium for one thing is still in time so sin is still here once you if you ever have time you have sin because remember in the garden of eden time started when they sinned right so time and sin is pretty much close together uh so as long as you have time you're going to have sin so there will be a thousand years that we live and rule and reign in the millennium and it will be a 360 day 1000 years all right the future home is totally different because i say totally but it's not totally different it is different in the sense that the millennium has time the future home has eternity so that's not going to bother me and you mean you are eternal on this side right here on this earth but and even in the millennium you and i will be in glorified bodies but there's a process like i said god is so wonderful that that we can't digest all this at one time so he puts things in stages human beings like things in stages all right are in revelation which is the revealing part all right so he reveals his self to us down here as the son of god then as the son of man to take us in a rapture then he's promised and we read it before of the son of david david was promised that his son would rule and reign on the throne of david so this is where the millennium temple comes in and he sits on the throne his son of david you and i are there just on a honeymoon we have no connection the son of david he's already our all in all but there's a group of people that's having to come through a developmental stage just like the earth the earth brother branham said the earth was formed it was void then light came god created the world and he stopped but then what happened sin happened in the garden it threw the earth off started throwing the earth off then when you got to knowing the flood it really tilted the earth and it hadn't been right ever since all right so as the earth is trying to get itself straightened back up god is straightening a group of people redemption remember what i said it's it's not taking this pin people say oh you take this pin and drop it pick it back up that's redemption to a degree that's right but if i drop if i hold this pin here and i drop it and then i pick it up and hold it here that's not for redemption that's a process i've still got to bring it back up to the exact place where god saw it in his mind if you if you'll think about that in what god saw you and i before the foundation of the world that's what he's going to bring us back to at this point right here not this point but there has to be a process reach down pick up and bring it up through a process to bring it to right here that's god's way of doing things right so in the flood what happened in the flood earth tilted but brother brown said god washed it with water justified it wiped all the sin off of it remember he said that man evil has been continually in in man's mind they just continually were evil so what god's doing is he's starting to bring it back up he sanctified him when jesus christ came shed his blood on the earth cleansed and claimed the earth all right and then in the millennium i believe it's going to all come right back to this all right because that's restoration but it's still going to have sin as far as spirits or our souls that are going to have to be dealt with and evil spirits so even though it's in it's coming up in its rightful condition it's not in its total perfect condition until this thing right here comes down onto the earth the future home comes down on the earth that will make it brother brown said then a redeemed entire earth that's what he said in a future home that's why he didn't i don't believe he he preached one service on the millennium because the millennium is a process so they asked him brother brown could could children be born in the millennium he said it looks like it can looks like it can but seeing that future home when he brought that message to the future home down he brought it right down to where it was going to be the dimensions what it looked like and everything see he was positive that that was going to be the culmination of everything earth and man and nature all three all right now what's what's god doing god is bringing man back first because he's the one that fell all right then he's going to restore nature because in romans 8 it says the whole world is groaning and waiting now the creation and groaning and waiting on who man to come back first to redemption then he's then the nature's going to follow because we're going to read it right here what's going to happen isaiah 65 verse 21 they shall build houses and inhabit them and they shall plant vineyards and eat the fruit of them what's god doing he's he's he's cultivating the earth back again letting us have something still to do with it all right because he put man on he put man on earth to till the soil before the fall right before the fall that's what the bible says before the fall he put man in in flesh to till the ground right so we're going to do that again they shall not build in another inhabit not shall plant in another eat for the days of the trees the days of my people and my elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands my elect shall enjoy the work of their hands we're not going to get callouses i wouldn't say why wouldn't get dirt on our hands that washes off okay we're in glorified bodies it's not going to matter to us they shall not labor in vain or bring forth for trouble for they are the seed of the blessed of the lord and their offspring with them and it shall come to pass that before they call our answer and while they yet speak i will hear the wolf and the lamb shall feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the bullock now what he's talking about the earth's being restored back to an eating condition but it's not a total eating condition because even in the garden of eden the devil was there right walking around in spirit form not in the beast yet because remember he come into the beast later he incarnated the beast and then talked to eve but the devil was standing right there when all this was being created he was formulating his little plan the wolf and the lamb should feed together and the lion shall eat straw like the book thus shall be the serpent's meat they shall not hurt or destroy all my holy mountain saith the lord all right so now and then the bible talks about beating their uh swords in the plow in the plow stops that is in the millennium the prophet said so in the millennium we are going to black build houses all right but what's gonna happen over here let's go to revelation 20 1. and what happens in revelations 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and the first earth were passed away and there were no more seed all right everybody understand that the new heaven and earth doesn't mean he's going to annihilate it what's he doing he has um during the millennium or before the millennium man is going to destroy the world he always does but the second fire that falls is the holy ghost and fire that burns everything out of you you receive the baptism of the holy ghost uh say 10 years ago but what's he doing now he's taking the fire and he's burning the droughts out he's burning he's burning these things into you right he's burning virtue he's burning knowledge temperatures guys brother kindness all right what's he doing though he's actually burning you so that those things can come in because we still have the ability to shut those doors you can be a born-again christian and never have knowledge like in a pyramid okay but you're gonna die you're gonna go by the grave you're not gonna you're not going to take a body change all right but does god give us enough word to do it that's right does god give us enough preachers to do it yeah yeah and you don't do it whose problem is it right your problem that's right that's why i was preaching last sunday now there's something it's unconditional god saves you unconditionally by faith but this right here all the way up through to love is your condition it you do have something to do with it in that sense right you do have something to do with shutting the door and not letting god in right right not in your heart is being in your soul but brother brandon preached the message doors and doors one door you open to let christ in but if i let you in my house and you go down my hallway there's three doors down my hallway if i don't want you in josh's old room i pull the door shut right because i know there might be something in there you don't want to see but you're still in the house right you're still living there you're still coming in you know you understand what i'm saying you're still eating you're still doing like brother gerald this don't do away with nothing he preached last night with the kitchen the living room in the bedroom but there's not there's there is just a three-room house but even in the spiritual even in the natural you don't have a house that just has a kitchen mom and daddy used to live in one when i was born and just had a kitchen living room and a bedroom but there's more than three rooms in your natural home so there's more than three rooms in that spiritual part of your heart which is open the door for virtue knowledge temperatures godly brother and kindness and all that so you do have something to do with it when it comes to that abraham had an unconditional covenant god said i'm going to save you because you believed in me all right and then abraham went through a journey but he never went through the journey of a statue of perfect man that was given for you and i because the the the teachers inside to do it but like i said before and it's really hit home here recently how that you can grieve the holy spirit be born again we must just born again as as god is right you can grieve that holy spirit away you cannot come to church you can do you know do the things of the world i'm not talking about do the things of the world like you used to let me don't get me wrong if you were smoking you didn't go back smoking again all right that should be dead but it but like brother gerald was saying fellowship leads to relationship that's right okay fellowship you got to start learning how to have fellowship with god all right don't always have fellowship with god still the word that's right but you can you can have you can be born again and and like i said not have knowledge or temperance or patience some people are not going to get rid of it so they're going to go by the grave right okay so you can you grieve it away but now that doesn't mean you lose it right that just means god can't use you like he wants to and you're gonna be you know the reason how you're gonna be held accountable you're gonna have to die that's right you're gonna have to die and go by the grave there's no way you can stay alive and remain to the coming of the lord and not have all those virtues working in your life if not then you've got to go by the grave that's just the way it is all right let's see why don't come no they don't come some come to 30 some come to 60 but there is a group promise to come to 100. the ones that come to 30 fold they're just as righteous as the hundredfold but there's a position here on this earth that you gotta reach a statue a mountain of a perfect man that has not been required in all the other ages unless it was this age because somebody's gonna make the hundredfold when he spoke hundredfold if he just said thirty see that's the continent thank you brother right that's the continuity of got it because remember it's 30 60 90. if you go in you're 30 60 90 that's not 100. if he just hit 30 60 90 nobody would have been able to take a body change right without death but he said some 30 some 60 some hundred so a hundred fold is the ones that go on the rapture without death but no shame to the ones that are dying now they you know god sees you come to one place and and um and we don't worry about things like that right we think pearl's sister irene um wilson but she's had a lot better time we are right now uh brother hugh wilson's wife that died a while ago she's she's having a better time than we are we don't we gotta get him to go to work tomorrow and pay the bills and all she got to do is sit there and wait on us talk to god talk to brother brown talk to all the people in that dimension rotate him i'll guarantee you he looked at william branham the first man he looked for when he went across that curtain of time well his wife i believe she went and got him i believe she's the one to come got him at the river and took him you know because she died first brother brown said he'll send somebody to the river to get you that you know that'll lead you across that river all right from from natural to supernatural it's not a river people it's not a running water it's just it's just a crossing over from one dimension to another dimension and sister tatum walked over there and just brought him right over and said hey here's brother branham and i don't guarantee you he was shocked yes all right let's finish and i saw in you heaven and your earth chapter 21 verse one for the first heaven and the first earth will pass away and there were no more sea see that's what happened that's what happens at death the first earth one your mom and daddy gave you passed away but everybody thinks well it's going to pass away means it's going to go back to the dirt and you god's going to give you a new one did god destroy did god destroy the earth he destroyed the outside of it changed it didn't didn't blow it up because in our old ideas we thought well we're going to go live in heaven and this earth's just going to be annihilated because that's what the bible said earth's going to pass away but i recognized that 40 with 40 40 somewhere in there i created and brother gerald um said it yesterday i created this world to be inhabited that's the eternal word of god it cannot go past that right if he said i made it to be inhabited and god said it that makes it eternal there's nothing there's nothing god can't go against his word so he made that earth to be inhabited now it's going to be cleaned off and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down from god out of heaven now that's not this city right here because remember when we come back in the millennium we build houses and gardens and all that down here got it john right here sees a new city coming down from god out of heaven prepared where coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride adorned for her husband so where was he coming the city was coming to this earth right all right city was coming to this earth so this city is a heavenly city coming the earth coming to earth let me do one more thing this is temporary this is not even the one that abraham saw he didn't see a he said we have no continuing city but we look for one whose builder and maker is god god made this one right here man is going to make this one that's why it's going to be it's going to be creative evolution just like god did when he started i don't believe in evolution like darwin did but i believe in creative evolution where god created one specie and then a higher species and a higher species and a heart species same thing with here we're going to take you say well how are we going to it don't matter how we're going to do it don't don't worry about where we're gonna get nails you miss this whole thing sitting there with your mind going way off over into space somewhere wondering what what's it gonna look like where are we gonna get glass i'm just dumb enough to believe that there was no glass in the garden of eden and somebody somebody took sand and fire and heated it hot enough and made glass out of it guess what we're going to have fire still here we're going to have sand still here and we're going to have people and we're going to have a thousand years you say that's not very long people this united states of america is less than 300 years old and look how far we've advanced from 300 300 years ago there wasn't nothing but indians and farmers in this land right look where we've come in just 300 years what we've built up out of this earth think about a thousand years that's right a thousand years man has come from from just barely out some way to print to put print on paper so now we can instantly through our cell phones and anything if you got a wireless printer and no sin and no sin right so you know i don't worry about what my house is going to look like i just worry about getting there that's right all right but if we're get if we get here this is the whole point i want to make if we get to the millennium you're guaranteed a free trip right here i've always said if you're born again today you'll have this city already in you right right your house your garden because brother randall said he made it according to your desire right okay but he made it according to your desire this is going to be built according to maybe our desire that we have on earth uh whether we build them with stone or brick or water doesn't matter to me that doesn't think a little trivial thing like that makes no difference to me at all because you know what god's got this all in his mind but god still got all this in his mind too he knows what we're gonna do he knows what we'll need right and he'll put it there if he knew what man needed naturally and put all the minerals and vitamins and everything in this earth that man would need a man could put it together and make an aspirin or make this or make that um guess what this is going to be a piece of cake right compared to how we're living on this earth right now okay because like brother donnie said our sin will be gone there'll still be sin around somewhere but it won't be any there won't be any greed or my house is bigger than yours or or you didn't help me make my barns i'm not going to milk you make you help your barn there's nothing be that right i just like to look at the natural you know remember what they used to do back in the old times they used to have a barn raisin you'd have a barn raisin and they almost help each other now anyway right now you say well i don't care if they're dead if they're ranked centers that doesn't make any difference to me but the type that they show that man goodness of man always comes out what i'm trying to say so take that times 10 billion times 10 billion the prophet said billions of billion and put that love in here and you see what the amish do for each other times all that is what we're going to do for each other in a millennium but now remember when we come to this future home there's no working involved god's already built it behold the tabernacle and heard a great voice out of heaven saying behold the tabernacle of god is with men all right and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and be their god and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death no sorrow no crying neither shall there be any more pain for the former things are passed away and he that set up on the throne said behold i make all things new and he said unto me right for these words are true and faithful and he said unto me it is done i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end i will give unto him that is the thirst of the fount of the water of life freely he that overcometh shall inherit all things and i will be his god and he shall be my son then now you see what happens to all the others feel fearful unbelieving abominable murderers whoremongers sorcerers idolaters and all liars shall have their partner in the lake which burneth with fire and brimstone which is the second death which is going to happen right here at the white throne judgment he throws them over into the lake of fire all right and he carried me away in the spirit to a great high mountain showed me that great city the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from god having the glory of god and her life was likened her her lot why did john see the city it was looked as the bride adorned her husband her light was like into a stone most precious even like jasper clears crystal it had a wall great and high and had 12 gates and at the gates 12 angels and names written their own which are the names of the 12 tribes of the children of israel on the east three gates on the north three gate south three gates and on the westbrook gate and the wall of the city had 12 foundations and in them the name of the 12 apostles was the lamb so you got your apostles you got all those things coming in here now that that never was explained the bible doesn't explain a city and throne and walls except for the jews right because remember there's a millennium temple to be built here and it does have dimensions ezekiel 40-44 but this right here is built specifically for me and you everybody else is going to live outside that city whatever they do if they have to build their own house which i believe they will and all those things and have gardens they will but this eternal city that god's talking about right here is something that god made special for me and you and he's the only one that holds that in his bosom until where john saw everything was finished white throne's done sin has done away with and then an eternal city a mountain pushes up the prophet said 1500 miles square so it's at an incline 1500 mile square and then that city is going to sit down now what's going to sit down on top of that mountain you and i you and i are going to sit down because he saw that it was as the bride adorned for her husband so it's going to be us coming back after all this has been wiped over god's fire wipes everything off kills all the sin killed all the devils all the spirits that's floating around then that mountain's gonna push up and god's gonna set that city you and me are gonna come right back down and when we sit down it's all going to sit right in its place right that'll be eternal city see what the difference is now the difference is in the millennium the earth is being renewed being born again the earth is being born again right here because remember we're building things we're doing all that but once you go through all this this is not being born again this is all in all right here in verse three behold the tabernacle of god is with men and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and god himself shall be with them and he be their god that's going to happen to us should have it's happening to us down here but see that's the process we go through it the bride goes through it first we're sealed in all right 144 000 gets sealed in and we come back in this millennium everybody else is dead all the dead live not for what a thousand years right the bible says in 19 of revelations i believe it is and the rest of the dead lived not for a thousand years so the millennium is going to be us and the jews and whatever the the heathen or whatever that's raised up you know that's between god and and and what he does and not us but we know one thing's for sure the foolish virgin and all sinners and everybody that is died and does not have the holy ghost in their soul are going to stay dead until this white throne judgment then the bible says the earth the sea everything gives up the dead right in other words everybody that's ever died is going to be alive at one point in time what's god doing he's bringing this thing back up getting rid of all the trash and then guess what's going to happen this is what he wanted to happen in the garden of eden this is a show of it kind of a preview you know you get a movie trailer you know you get about two minutes a little snippet of what's going to happen in the movie they'll show you a few action scenes a few love things a few of this that's what god's doing he's showing a few things he's showing himself a few few ways here but right here this is all in all right everything he's got is going to be poured out on this earth which is the bride then it'll be the bride the 144 thousand foolish virgin cup of water in my name babies that have we sometimes we forget about those babies that didn't make it to to um the age of accountability they're going to be in heaven they're going to have to be given eternal life because they never knew jesus christ but he died for their sin they'll be given eternal life all dad's going to be dead and all i was going to be live right here now right here you got a difference there's some dead some alive some of these are going to stay there you know they're going to come up but god's going to you know take care of them but there's some of these going to be come over into here so see that's why the millennium doesn't it's not everything everybody understand that because somebody that's down here that's dead in these dimensions somebody's going to get to live for eternity right here that's not the case right here that's the case they're going to get get eternal life imparted to them but this eternal city was made for you and i and next sunday i need to hook brother gerald up but next sunday we will uh kind of try to finish this up and then i'll then we won't be here the next sunday brother joe won't either and donny you won't either so we just may not have sunday school but on the uh first of august because most of us will be gone to the uh to the youth camp you
