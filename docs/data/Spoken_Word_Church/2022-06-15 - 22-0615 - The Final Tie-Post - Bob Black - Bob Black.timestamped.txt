[6:24] oh
[6:30] [Music]
[6:44] amen you want to see him tonight
[6:46] it's good to be in the house of the lord
[6:48] and
[6:49] y'all can be seated just for a second
[6:50] i'm going to do something a little bit
[6:51] different tonight
[6:54] tonight i want to speak on the final
[6:55] type post but before um before i do that
[6:58] i've just been kind of meditating on
[7:00] some things that um uh that you know
[7:03] there's all these different videos and
[7:04] things circulating about the way that
[7:06] young people think and and so forth and
[7:09] so i i wanted to just play a little clip
[7:11] for y'all and that the brothers can
[7:12] bring up that's only three minutes
[7:14] before i preach
[7:15] and uh
[7:17] what it is is as there's some folks down
[7:19] in alpharetta that
[7:21] went around to different user university
[7:22] campuses and they went and interviewed
[7:24] some of the young people and just talked
[7:26] to them about the lord and and it's
[7:27] really interesting the way that they
[7:29] react and so it's real quick but i want
[7:32] you to just just just real pay attention
[7:34] to the to the to the responses they
[7:37] they say to the some of the questions
[7:38] they're asked
[7:40] and then i'll preach on them so i'm just
[7:42] going to stand up here and y'all and
[7:43] y'all go ahead and play it
[8:00] so for you
[8:02] um
[8:02] would you tell me that i'm wrong
[8:05] if i said that i was a christian do you
[8:07] think that that's wrong
[8:08] no
[8:09] no okay i think it's right
[8:12] um
[8:14] it's not right or wrong it's uh it's
[8:16] your personal belief you have the right
[8:18] to believe what you want to believe
[8:19] anything can be true even alive a good
[8:22] amount of people believe in it but then
[8:23] does that make it true if it's a lie
[8:25] yeah because usually it's the majority
[8:27] the majority out rules the minority when
[8:29] it comes to things like that someone can
[8:31] say
[8:32] jesus is god's son and if a lot of
[8:35] people believe that then for that
[8:37] majority group it's true but for
[8:39] everyone else is not
[8:41] so if i got everybody in the universe
[8:43] somehow to look at you and say you're
[8:45] not a real person
[8:46] or you're not really you know alive or
[8:48] don't really exist would that make it
[8:50] true just because everybody says it
[8:52] i always say yeah is there a difference
[8:53] between true truth and someone's own
[8:55] truth i think there is but sometimes it
[8:58] doesn't matter is all truth vow the
[9:00] truth
[9:02] yes do you believe in absolute truth
[9:05] no so i know this is a crazy example
[9:07] yeah but let's say there's a culture
[9:09] that thinks it's really cool when you're
[9:11] five years old to have a ceremony where
[9:13] you stick you know burning hot poles
[9:15] into their eyes okay
[9:17] is that right or wrong morally
[9:20] subjective we kind of evolved from that
[9:22] because if you go back like i'd say 3
[9:24] 000 years ago that was just uh
[9:26] that was that's kind of sounds like a
[9:28] ritualistic approach to a boy becoming a
[9:30] man now would be wrong but that back
[9:31] then you know it would have been bad no
[9:33] not really nazi germany for example um
[9:36] do you think that they were wrong to
[9:37] kill six million jews yes
[9:40] why i guess because
[9:42] i was bred to think that it's wrong to
[9:44] single out a minority and kill them off
[9:47] um but maybe in other cultures that
[9:48] would be looked at as normal let's say
[9:50] um i really wholeheartedly thought that
[9:53] that trash can was god if i believed
[9:55] it's true
[9:56] you would agree with me it's your belief
[9:59] i mean it has nothing to do with me so
[10:00] yeah who determines what truth is you do
[10:03] what is truth
[10:05] truth is
[10:08] okay that's hard
[10:09] i think truth is something that is like
[10:13] universal
[10:14] yeah i think to build off of that i
[10:15] think it's something that's like very
[10:16] widely accepted um
[10:18] and that is valid i guess if that makes
[10:21] sense this is all truth valid truth is
[10:24] all truth valid truth um
[10:26] yeah
[10:27] i would say so all truths about truth
[10:29] what you just said yeah let's say two
[10:31] people believe things that are
[10:32] completely opposed to each other is that
[10:35] possible for someone to be wrong about
[10:36] their truth no no no because your truth
[10:39] is you're true everyone perceives the
[10:41] world differently so it doesn't matter
[10:43] like to me most of the time it's just
[10:45] like your own truth it doesn't matter
[10:48] all the time what other people think i
[10:50] feel like people can definitely have two
[10:52] different viewpoints and still be their
[10:55] truth whatever you believe is your truth
[10:57] that's what the truth is
[11:11] and uh you know if you talk if you talk
[11:14] to young people you've ever had a chance
[11:15] to really talk to young people you can
[11:16] see that it's not just something that's
[11:18] out there
[11:19] it the devil moves and he's trying to
[11:21] he's trying to do something
[11:23] and uh
[11:24] if you want to research that further
[11:26] what that's called is post-modernism
[11:28] where post-modernism the idea behind
[11:30] post-modernism is there is no truth
[11:33] so this morning or this afternoon i want
[11:34] to read from the book of acts in chapter
[11:37] chapter 20 and just take a take a topic
[11:39] out of this scripture as the final thai
[11:41] post
[11:43] lord jesus we're so grateful for truth
[11:45] lord and so grateful to know you
[11:47] so grateful to know you in the power of
[11:48] your resurrection lord jesus
[11:51] lord surely the things that we just
[11:52] heard are scary lord and lord but thank
[11:55] god that we've got a typo something that
[11:57] we can hang on to that we can hang our
[11:59] soul and hang our life and hang
[12:01] everything that we are on to lord and we
[12:03] just ask lord that tonight lord that
[12:05] maybe you'll answer some questions lord
[12:06] jesus and you'll you'll speak right to
[12:08] the need of somebody tonight lord and we
[12:10] just ask your blessing upon the service
[12:12] that you'll feel at liberty to move
[12:13] among us lord jesus and make these words
[12:15] not just not just dead letters on the
[12:17] page but lord let them leap off lord to
[12:20] a living reality in our hearts and lives
[12:22] granted lord that you'll just bless this
[12:24] service we ask in your name amen
[12:28] so paul here's somebody in in acts that
[12:30] that that's that's speaking uh in acts
[12:33] chapter 20 verse 22 and 24 that had had
[12:36] done a lot of bad things and uh gone
[12:38] down the wrong path but then god got a
[12:40] hold of him and he found that final thai
[12:43] post
[12:44] and he said now behold i go bound in the
[12:46] spirit of jerusalem not knowing the
[12:48] things that shall befall me there
[12:50] save that the holy ghost witnesseth in
[12:52] every city saying that bonds and
[12:54] afflictions abide me
[12:56] but none of these things move me
[13:00] none of these things move me
[13:02] neither count on my life dear unto
[13:04] myself
[13:05] so that i might finish my course with
[13:07] joy
[13:08] and the ministry which i have received
[13:10] with the lord jesus to testify the
[13:13] gospel of the grace of god you may be
[13:15] seated the lord at his blessing to the
[13:16] reading of the word
[13:19] so paul what a strange thing there to
[13:22] to think about that paul found something
[13:25] that
[13:26] so tied him down
[13:28] so so rooted him and grounded him
[13:31] to where he could face death and he'd
[13:34] say i it doesn't move me i'm not moved
[13:36] by all the things i'm not moved by being
[13:38] lowered over the wall in a basket i'm
[13:40] not i'm not moved by being stoned to
[13:42] death and then raised up i'm not moved
[13:44] by any of those things i'm not moved by
[13:47] face and death at jerusalem he found the
[13:49] final thai post
[13:51] now now let's just meditate on that
[13:53] video we just watched and and and kind
[13:55] of think about some of the things that
[13:56] we just heard people saying that that
[13:58] you know
[14:00] the devil has got people so tied up that
[14:02] they don't even know what's right and
[14:04] wrong that that go to these universities
[14:07] and this is in georgia now this is right
[14:09] down the road from where i live this is
[14:11] in georgia and
[14:13] the devil's got people so tied up they
[14:15] don't even know what truth is that when
[14:16] you ask them
[14:18] there's that other video circulating
[14:19] that some of you might have heard of
[14:21] some of the brothers talking about it's
[14:22] called what is a woman because they they
[14:24] ask they go and ask people what's a
[14:25] woman and they can't even answer because
[14:27] they don't even know what what truth it
[14:29] can't even they can't even get down to
[14:31] what what reality is
[14:33] but listen now let's just meditate on
[14:35] some of these responses that we heard
[14:37] being a christian the first one being a
[14:39] christian is not right or wrong
[14:41] you got the right to believe whatever
[14:42] you want to believe it's not right or
[14:44] wrong was it right or wrong
[14:46] we should be able to nail it down it's
[14:48] either right or wrong it's neither right
[14:50] or wrong is what the response is the
[14:52] next one anything anything can be true
[14:54] even a lie if enough people if you got
[14:56] enough people to believe it anything can
[14:57] be true even a lie that you heard it
[15:00] right out of the the fellow's mouth any
[15:01] can anything can be true even a lie
[15:04] and the majority out rules the minority
[15:06] if enough people say jesus is god's son
[15:08] then even if if enough people believe
[15:10] that and for that majority group it's
[15:13] true so if you've got enough people to
[15:14] believe it then that makes it true
[15:17] or if everybody in the universe got
[15:19] together and said you weren't a real
[15:20] person that would be a true statement
[15:22] and you heard it right out of their
[15:23] mouth and if everybody said that that
[15:25] would make it true
[15:26] the difference between truth and
[15:28] someone's own truth sometimes doesn't
[15:30] matter
[15:31] now see see tonight i i wanna i wanna
[15:33] just speak that it does matter it
[15:35] matters what you believe there there is
[15:37] a truth there is a real true
[15:40] something something there's a right
[15:42] answer and a wrong answer there's
[15:43] there's something that gives meaning to
[15:45] everything that we're looking at
[15:46] everything that we're doing there's
[15:47] there's a there's a truth
[15:49] the question was asked do you believe an
[15:51] absolute truth and and the girl said no
[15:54] there's in other words there's no
[15:55] absolute absolute what is absolute truth
[15:58] absolute truth is it's something
[16:00] concrete that's unchanging that never
[16:03] changes
[16:04] that that that is it that matches
[16:07] reality reality truth is what reality is
[16:12] reality is what truth is
[16:14] sticking hot coals in someone's eyes is
[16:16] not subjectively wrong
[16:18] and three out three thousand years ago
[16:20] wouldn't have been bad
[16:22] germany was only wrong to kill six
[16:24] million jews because of our our
[16:25] upbringing and other cultures that might
[16:27] be considered normal
[16:29] or what about this if i said that trash
[16:31] can was god would you agree with me it's
[16:33] your belief it ain't got nothing to do
[16:34] with me so sure i'll go along with it
[16:37] or who who determines what truth is is
[16:39] the question that was posed and the
[16:40] answer was you do
[16:42] you think about a society that we live
[16:44] on where you can just make up whatever
[16:46] you you want to you want us to be the
[16:49] truth and whatever
[16:51] whatever you say the truth is that's the
[16:53] way it is and that that sounds like
[16:55] madness to me
[16:57] you see what we see what a quagmire or
[16:59] the devil has got this world in where
[17:01] nobody even knows what's right and wrong
[17:03] and nobody even nobody even believes
[17:05] there is a right or wrong
[17:08] if you believe things that are
[17:09] completely opposed is it possible for
[17:11] someone to be wrong no your truth is
[17:13] their truth is what the answer was
[17:16] it's your own truth it doesn't matter
[17:17] what other people think people can have
[17:19] two different viewpoints and it's still
[17:20] be their truth whatever you believe is
[17:22] your truth that's what the truth is
[17:25] now see that's just that's some scary
[17:26] stuff right there
[17:28] and but thank god for the truth so maybe
[17:30] tonight i want to just ask you what what
[17:32] do you believe
[17:33] i'm sitting here tonight there might be
[17:35] all kinds of thoughts you know the young
[17:36] people go to school and they get
[17:37] bombarded by that but i want to
[17:39] challenge that i want to challenge your
[17:41] thoughts i want to challenge the things
[17:42] that the environment that you've been in
[17:44] school and and the the influence that
[17:46] you have in the world the people that
[17:48] you go to work with i want to challenge
[17:49] that tonight because there is a truth
[17:51] there is a right and wrong every time
[17:54] you go out in the world and you're
[17:55] you're confronted with something you
[17:57] have to make a choice there's a right
[17:58] way to go and a wrong way to go no
[18:00] matter what the devil tells you what no
[18:02] matter what the lie of the devil is that
[18:04] it don't matter it does matter
[18:06] and sitting here tonight it matters what
[18:08] you believe it matters what you're
[18:09] receiving it matters it matters the
[18:11] course that you go in life it matters
[18:14] what kind of job you take or what church
[18:16] you go to it matters where you hit sit
[18:18] at home and listen to a tape or go to a
[18:20] church where the five full ministry is
[18:21] preaching all these things matter
[18:24] do you believe in an unchangeable
[18:27] universal truth
[18:29] or do you believe the truth is what you
[18:31] make it
[18:33] do you believe everybody's got a point
[18:36] or do you believe that it matters what
[18:38] you believe
[18:40] see these are questions that need
[18:41] answering these are questions that
[18:43] you've got to come to conclusion to
[18:45] these are questions that matter do you
[18:47] is there a universal truth and i want to
[18:49] declare to you tonight there there is a
[18:51] universal truth there is something that
[18:54] we could tap into that stretches beyond
[18:56] all the time and all eternity that
[18:59] something that you can that will anchor
[19:01] your soul and anchor your life and
[19:03] anchor your family and give you peace
[19:05] and love and joy that the world don't
[19:07] know anything about
[19:09] you know if you if you go watch those
[19:11] videos if you go find them online and
[19:13] watch that it's called a road trip the
[19:14] truth they'll go the point they end up
[19:17] making is that people that don't know
[19:18] what truth is that's why there's all
[19:20] this depression and things because
[19:22] people don't know what the reason the
[19:24] reason for life or the reason for living
[19:26] is and they don't even know that there's
[19:27] there's a right or wrong or nothing
[19:30] the end of their story is that it just
[19:32] doesn't matter what i do
[19:34] but it matters
[19:36] you matter there's a purpose in your
[19:37] life and you matter to god enough that
[19:39] he came down and died for you on the
[19:41] cross and it matters what is real and it
[19:44] matters what you believe
[19:46] that's why paul could say in acts
[19:48] chapter 20
[19:49] behold i go bound in the spirit unto
[19:51] jerusalem not knowing the things that
[19:53] shall befall me there a man that had
[19:56] found something that could go bound down
[19:57] into jerusalem freely knowing that he
[20:00] would give his life
[20:01] saved that the holy ghost witnesses in
[20:03] every city saying that bonds and
[20:05] afflictions abide me but none of these
[20:07] things move me move me neither count on
[20:09] my life dear unto myself so that i might
[20:12] finish my course with joy he had found
[20:15] something that he could be anchored to
[20:17] to the point that he was willing to give
[20:19] his whole life over to it to lay his
[20:21] life down on the altar of sacrifice to
[20:23] give everything over to this and you
[20:25] think you think how do we know that the
[20:27] gospel is real because these 500 men saw
[20:30] jesus after he rose and they were
[20:32] willing to give their life and lay down
[20:34] their life all these men that we read
[20:36] about in the bible found something that
[20:38] was real it's more real than all that
[20:40] nonsense they feed you in school it's
[20:42] more real than all that stuff you see on
[20:44] tv it's more real than that gobbledygook
[20:47] you read about in the newspaper we found
[20:49] something we found the final top post in
[20:52] the gospel
[20:53] paul had found something to rest
[20:55] everything on and you can find something
[20:58] to rest everything oh too you can find
[21:00] something to rest your life and your
[21:02] soul
[21:03] and everything that you are
[21:05] and i want to say to you tonight that
[21:07] you'll never be a success in anything if
[21:10] you can't distinguish right and wrong
[21:13] you will never be a success and nothing
[21:16] if you can't tell the truth from the
[21:18] false you can you won't be a success if
[21:20] you can't tell the good and the bad and
[21:22] the wrong and the right you've got to
[21:25] have a tie post you've got to have
[21:28] something that you can anchor to and say
[21:30] this is this and this is that
[21:34] everyone's got to find something to tie
[21:36] to
[21:37] you're tied to
[21:38] tied to every great achievement every
[21:40] everybody's to every person and
[21:42] everything that's been did or done this
[21:44] is what brother brown said rather
[21:46] there has been an absolute connected
[21:48] with it
[21:49] everybody that's been amounted to
[21:51] anything had an absolute tie to him
[21:53] there's got to be something for it's the
[21:55] final time post there's got to be
[21:59] something
[22:00] first the final time post
[22:03] you know what what what you're tied to
[22:06] is what will determine the decisions
[22:08] that you make in life your decisions are
[22:11] based on what you're tied to if you're
[22:13] tied to the devil you're going to make
[22:14] that kind of decision you're tied to the
[22:16] devil then you uh it's a young man or a
[22:19] young woman tied to the devil they're
[22:20] the decisions around a wedding or it's
[22:22] going to or whether they even get
[22:23] married is going to be tied to that what
[22:25] they do with a bachelorette party or
[22:27] what they do with the bachelor party is
[22:29] going to be tied to the devil the life
[22:31] that the kind of home that they have is
[22:33] going to be tied to the devil but you
[22:34] get anchored in christ and everything
[22:36] changes and your decisions are based
[22:38] upon something else it's based upon the
[22:40] word of god
[22:43] who to marry and where to live and where
[22:45] to go to church and if you will go to
[22:47] church and all your life goals or
[22:49] whether or not you even have life goals
[22:51] are all tied to that tie post what
[22:54] you're tied to but we try to tie off to
[22:56] all kinds of stuff we try to tie off to
[22:59] most of the time it's our own opinions
[23:02] you know sometimes you you get around
[23:03] and you start talking about the word of
[23:05] god and and even then in that situation
[23:07] people begin to they start talking about
[23:09] well i think well i think this and i
[23:11] think that but you know what no nobody
[23:14] cares about what you think the devil
[23:15] don't care about what you think we don't
[23:17] you if i come up here with my own
[23:19] opinion you wouldn't care what i think
[23:21] you can't tie to your own opinions
[23:23] that's not a typos it don't matter what
[23:26] we think but i tell you what does matter
[23:28] is the word of god if you get anchored
[23:30] back to the word of god that's the only
[23:32] thing that matters
[23:33] we'll tie back to the popular opinion
[23:35] that's one thing that the kids have
[23:37] trouble with at school and people adults
[23:39] have problems with that because we'll
[23:41] try to tie to the most popular doctrine
[23:43] of what all the other preachers are
[23:44] preaching about it will tie to what
[23:46] everybody in school is thinking what
[23:48] what the popular opinion is but that's
[23:50] that's that's sinking saying we'll try
[23:52] to try to tie to the church's opinion
[23:57] if you know if you're tired of anything
[23:59] else anything other than the word of god
[24:01] you've got a tie post that's on sink and
[24:03] saying you got something that'll get
[24:05] frayed you're tied down to something
[24:06] that'll unravel and we'll leave you
[24:08] stranded one day
[24:11] maybe we'll tie to our favorite
[24:13] minister's opinion somebody that we
[24:15] really hold in high esteem and then
[24:16] after a while things they begin to say
[24:19] some strange things and maybe that'll
[24:21] all unravel you see you can't tie to a
[24:23] person you can't tie to an opinion but
[24:25] the only thing that's stable is god's
[24:27] word if we can get tied to that final
[24:30] top host everything will come out all
[24:32] right
[24:34] brother ham said god cannot say anything
[24:36] and ever take it back
[24:37] that's why we base our hopes upon god
[24:40] because god being infinite he cannot
[24:43] change
[24:45] you know you think about what a what a
[24:47] great thing that is we've got something
[24:48] that we can anchor to a god that can
[24:51] never change that if you could if you
[24:52] meet him in the same way that abraham
[24:54] met him in the same way that enoch met
[24:56] him in the same way that moses met him
[24:58] that you can get the same results if you
[25:01] come to him with faith believing because
[25:02] he's an unchanging god and he never
[25:05] changes that's the kind of tie post i'm
[25:07] talking about tonight you see the devil
[25:09] the devil don't care about any of them
[25:11] other typos you'll never be able to
[25:13] defeat the devil with any of the other
[25:14] other type hosts of our own opinions and
[25:17] our own thoughts and our own the things
[25:19] that we think the devil does not care
[25:21] about our own opinions
[25:25] in romans chapter 14 it says him that is
[25:27] weak in the faith receive you
[25:29] but not to doubtful disputations
[25:32] now the new living translation says
[25:34] accept other believers who are weak in
[25:35] the faith and don't argue with them
[25:37] about what they think is right or wrong
[25:39] because you see you you start talking to
[25:41] somebody this week in the faith and
[25:43] and it can turn into a turned into an
[25:45] argument
[25:46] about what what are arguments i think
[25:49] and you think
[25:50] and i think and what you think doesn't
[25:52] matter
[25:53] you sit there and you start arguing
[25:55] about stuff and arguing doesn't
[25:56] accomplish nothing that's something
[25:58] that's taken me a long time to learn but
[26:01] sitting there and going back and forth
[26:02] with somebody ain't going to accomplish
[26:04] nothing well because what we need we
[26:06] need to be anchored we need a revelation
[26:08] for our own self sometimes we want to
[26:10] argue it out with our kids and and beat
[26:12] them over the head with all of our
[26:14] wisdom and the knowledge and stuff but
[26:16] what everybody needs is a revelation for
[26:18] ourselves because you got to be tied for
[26:20] yourself you got to be tied for that
[26:22] typos yourself all the arguing in the
[26:25] world because what is it it's not it's
[26:27] not trying to reason it into somebody
[26:29] it's not trying to pack in the
[26:30] intellectual understanding but we've got
[26:33] to be anchored in christ christ is our
[26:35] absolute
[26:37] in galatians
[26:38] paul said for do i now persuade men or
[26:40] god or do i seek to please men for if i
[26:43] yet please men i should not be the
[26:45] servant of christ
[26:46] why are we not trying to please men
[26:48] because our opinions don't matter our
[26:50] opinions don't matter one iota
[26:53] in proverbs chapter 18 a fool has no
[26:55] delight in understanding but that his
[26:57] heart may discover itself
[27:00] and the english standard version said as
[27:01] a fool takes no pleasure and
[27:02] understanding but only in expressing his
[27:05] opinion he only wants to discover what's
[27:07] what he thinks in his in his heart is
[27:09] right you ever talk to somebody that's
[27:11] like well i think i think think think
[27:13] think and all all they're talking about
[27:14] what they think instead of instead of
[27:16] the laying laying something taking you
[27:18] back to a foundation of of where they
[27:21] got it from take it back to the
[27:22] encyclopedia take it back to an old
[27:25] person that you got it from that knew
[27:26] how to work on a car or something take
[27:28] it back to something that's real but see
[27:30] our opinions don't matter
[27:35] in romans chapter 8 verse 7 the carnal
[27:37] mind is enmity against god our carnal
[27:40] mind of all our opinions what we think
[27:42] is right what we think is what we think
[27:43] is right or wrong if we if we rely on
[27:46] what we think will be like that man that
[27:48] said that if you say that trash can is
[27:50] god
[27:51] then well
[27:53] that because that's that's as far as the
[27:54] carnal mind will take you the carnal
[27:57] mind is no anchor because it's at enmity
[27:59] against god it's it's against god for it
[28:02] is not subject to the law of god neither
[28:04] can be
[28:06] and second corinthians chapter 10 for we
[28:08] dare not make ourselves of the number or
[28:10] compare ourselves with some that commend
[28:12] themselves that talk about how good they
[28:14] are and their own opinions are but they
[28:16] measuring themselves by themselves and
[28:18] comparing themselves among themselves
[28:21] are not wise
[28:23] see when you compare yourself with
[28:24] somebody else you're not wise when you
[28:26] measure yourself against somebody else
[28:28] you're not wise why because our own
[28:30] stature and our own opinions and what we
[28:32] think about things do not matter
[28:36] maybe think about that when you go to
[28:38] school when you go to university and
[28:39] think about the opinions that the
[28:40] teachers are giving you and think about
[28:42] the opinions that your friends are
[28:43] giving you those opinions if they're
[28:45] contrary to the word of god don't matter
[28:46] at all you got to take everything back
[28:49] to the only solid typos which is the
[28:51] word of god and the devil's trick is to
[28:53] damage your confidence in that final
[28:56] type host that's what he did in the
[28:57] garden of eden is he damaged eve's
[28:59] confidence he got her to walk up from
[29:01] from behind the word and begin to think
[29:03] that she had a better understanding than
[29:05] the preachers
[29:06] go to school and listen to all that
[29:08] tommy rot and all that filth and stuff
[29:10] where they they pack into your mind
[29:11] where there ain't no truth there's no
[29:13] way for you to know truth truth is
[29:14] whatever you make it a and and the devil
[29:17] will begin to to sow and use this
[29:19] confidence in the in the ministers and
[29:21] the gospel of this age has tried to get
[29:23] you into the right mind they see the
[29:25] devil's lie is there's no right or wrong
[29:28] that everything's subjective
[29:31] that your opinion matters
[29:33] that isn't that like the lie of the age
[29:35] that your opinion matters your opinion
[29:38] does not matter at all your opinion does
[29:40] not matter
[29:43] oh if we could get to a place where we
[29:44] could die out to our own self and crawl
[29:46] up on that altar of sacrifice like abel
[29:48] did when he identified himself with his
[29:51] sacrifice we could realize that our
[29:52] opinions doesn't matter our own efforts
[29:54] don't matter our own works don't matter
[29:57] but christ is everything that we depend
[29:59] on
[30:00] christ is the one that we're anchored to
[30:02] christ is the one that we look to for
[30:03] everything we have need of
[30:06] he's that final type host
[30:09] there's a lot of shaky things to tie off
[30:10] to but there's one final unchanging type
[30:13] host that can never be moved and that's
[30:15] christ in his word
[30:16] and brother said and man cannot
[30:19] cannot by no means achieve anything
[30:21] until there comes somewhere where they
[30:23] recognize that there is an absolute
[30:27] now you think let's meditate on that you
[30:29] can't achieve nothing until you realize
[30:31] that there is an absolute
[30:33] there there is a truth
[30:35] i'm talking about a universal truth not
[30:37] just what you make it sitting here
[30:38] tonight
[30:39] sitting here tonight you might in your
[30:41] own mind think well well i i i want to
[30:44] do what's hap what makes me feel good i
[30:46] want to do what makes me happy i want to
[30:48] cut my hair the way i want to cut it i
[30:49] want to dress the way i want i want to
[30:51] dress
[30:52] but you see all those things will take
[30:54] you down the road wrong road
[30:58] you'll never be able to achieve anything
[31:01] until there comes somewhere where you
[31:03] recognize that there is an absolute
[31:05] and brother adam said that final typo is
[31:07] the last word he said it's the amen he
[31:10] said you hear people say absolutely
[31:12] that's it that's the last thing
[31:14] there's nothing else in its way
[31:17] it's the supreme
[31:19] it's an ultimate
[31:21] and an ultimate is when primarily an
[31:23] ultimate because you've reached the end
[31:25] it's the amen it's the it's the final
[31:28] thing the the final say like like the
[31:31] supreme court in the land or or a
[31:33] policeman that stops you on the road
[31:34] that's the final you you can't say
[31:36] nothing else because you've reached the
[31:38] ultimate you've reached a place where
[31:40] there's no argument there's no excuse
[31:43] there's nothing you can say what are you
[31:45] going to do if you if you come to the
[31:47] place where you stand at the white
[31:48] throne judgment
[31:50] what would you say what excuse would you
[31:51] make when the word has been preached
[31:53] when it's been laid before you and you'd
[31:55] say well you had come up maybe with all
[31:56] kinds of excuses well i was tired and
[31:59] that's why i didn't go to church and
[32:00] maybe i i forgot to get gas the night
[32:03] before and that's why i didn't come to
[32:05] church and these are the reasons why i
[32:07] didn't want to become a christian but
[32:09] you see the final type post is the
[32:12] ultimate when you reach that ultimate
[32:13] there is no excuse there's no opinion
[32:15] that you can you can raise there's no
[32:17] argument you can raise to reach that
[32:20] final ultimate arg the final tie post
[32:23] and brother i said one time in a
[32:24] doctor's office i was speaking to a
[32:26] doctor you see we you gotta have
[32:28] something that you base everything on
[32:31] he was talking to a doctor and he said
[32:33] the doctor said i believe that a man
[32:35] could appropriate enough faith
[32:36] that he could go out of here and touch
[32:38] this tree and be healed now listen to
[32:40] what brother brown said he said i
[32:42] believe i believe you could have enough
[32:43] faith and you could just go lay your
[32:45] hand on a tree
[32:47] and be healed
[32:49] and brother i'm saying no
[32:51] you gotta have an absolute
[32:54] you gotta have something that you can
[32:56] base your faith on
[32:57] i said but doctor how could a man ever
[32:59] appropriate enough faith to touch a tree
[33:01] and be healed because there is no
[33:03] background to that
[33:05] there's no place you can tie to it
[33:07] because it's not scripturally a
[33:08] foundation you got to have a foundation
[33:11] you got to have something to base your
[33:13] faith in we can't base our faith in one
[33:15] another's opinions or in a tree or in a
[33:17] cloud or something like that but you can
[33:19] base your faith on the word of god
[33:21] you've got to have something that you
[33:22] can tie to
[33:24] to know
[33:25] that this is it
[33:28] you got to be able to tie into it
[33:32] and brother around told that story about
[33:33] how he went to the hospital to pray for
[33:35] this little girl that had had got into a
[33:37] place where she didn't even know where
[33:38] she was at
[33:40] and he went in there and he began to
[33:41] pray for her and and he had a vision he
[33:44] said i looked back and the vision left
[33:45] me and said normal does she have a the
[33:47] the little girl's mother was normal does
[33:49] she have a boyfriend kind of tall and
[33:51] dark hair
[33:52] yes i said does he do something with
[33:54] them in singing
[33:55] i said yes that's right
[33:57] i said don't you worry
[33:59] i have thus saith the lord she is coming
[34:01] out of it
[34:03] now
[34:04] now norma got tied into that
[34:06] she was she was she got anchored in what
[34:08] a prophet of god said
[34:11] and she said brother ryan said norma
[34:12] threw her hands and caught me by the
[34:14] knee looked up to her husband said honey
[34:17] it's never wrong
[34:19] it's never wrong now if we could have
[34:21] that same kind of attitude about the
[34:22] word of god
[34:24] that it's never wrong
[34:26] said it's never wrong and about two
[34:28] hours from in the phone was just ringing
[34:29] when i come up from mr woods down below
[34:31] and it was her father he was on the
[34:32] phone he said brother branham i got
[34:34] something to tell you said you hadn't
[34:35] been gone 20 minutes until she come to
[34:38] herself normally and she's been examined
[34:41] by the whole staff of doctors were
[34:43] taking her home in the morning
[34:45] and he said you got in everything you
[34:47] got to have somewhere you could tie down
[34:49] to
[34:51] now see she she was so tied down to that
[34:55] prophet of god when he said he said i
[34:58] saw a vision thus saith the lord she
[35:00] said it's never wrong
[35:02] and she was so confident in what he said
[35:05] now can't we be that confident in the
[35:08] word of the lord that's laid in these
[35:09] pages that when we read by his stripes
[35:12] we're healed he was wounded for our
[35:15] transgressions bruised for our iniquity
[35:18] he all these promises that are laying
[35:20] there in the bible and when you see it
[35:22] if you can have that kind of a
[35:23] confidence that it's not just letters
[35:25] laying on the page but christ that's
[35:27] rhythm from the grave and may these
[35:29] words come to life and that's what
[35:31] anchors you that not the letters on the
[35:33] page but the risen christ that's made it
[35:35] real to you you've got to have somewhere
[35:38] you can tie down to
[35:40] that's why in mark chapter 13 it says
[35:42] heaven on earth shall pass away pass
[35:44] away but my words shall not pass away
[35:47] and these are not these are not just
[35:48] empty words but you think about if all
[35:51] of heaven and all of earth were to be
[35:54] burned up and to be no more and to be
[35:56] completely consumed
[35:58] we still have a confidence that his
[36:00] words will never pass away
[36:03] so if you're anchored into his words his
[36:06] words will never pass away that's that's
[36:08] the name that's a sure tie post that's
[36:11] something real
[36:12] and that's what paul was sold out to
[36:15] in philippians chapter 1 he said
[36:16] according to my earnest expectation and
[36:18] my hope that in nothing i shall be
[36:20] ashamed
[36:21] but that with all boldness is always so
[36:23] now also christ shall be magnified in my
[36:25] body whether it be by life or by death
[36:29] whether i die or whether i live christ
[36:31] will be magnified in me that's the kind
[36:33] of typos that paul was anchored to for
[36:35] to me to live as christ and to die is
[36:37] gain but if i live in the flesh this is
[36:40] the fruit of my labor yet what i shall
[36:43] choose i what not
[36:45] paul was so anchored he didn't care
[36:47] whether he lived or died as long as
[36:49] christ was manifested in his members
[36:52] and and would say a great brawler giving
[36:54] out great threats and doing things
[36:56] against the church of god making havoc
[36:58] of it and even persecuting it unto death
[37:00] and one day on the road down
[37:04] that's the reason he had this christ in
[37:06] her life is because he personally and
[37:09] brother said now laying aside his
[37:10] teaching
[37:11] he personally met christ
[37:17] listen there's there's been a lot of
[37:18] people that understood some things in
[37:19] the bible
[37:21] but you got to meet christ christ is the
[37:23] one that makes the bible live
[37:26] christ is the one that makes the bible
[37:28] real he's the one that wrote the bible
[37:31] they spoke it through the apostles and
[37:32] prophets
[37:33] you got to meet christ
[37:38] and brother said that's the only way
[37:39] that you're ever going to know him is to
[37:41] meet him
[37:42] to know him his life
[37:44] not even know his word
[37:46] now let's see does that trip you up
[37:48] tonight not even know his word as good
[37:51] as it may be
[37:52] yet you've got to know him
[37:54] to know him as life
[37:57] you see because you can read the bible
[37:59] and know all the greek and everything
[38:01] and say well this greek word means this
[38:03] and we can explain it what dunamis means
[38:05] and all those things but to know him
[38:08] actually brings it off of the page and
[38:10] gives you the understanding of what it
[38:12] is it puts the pieces together so you're
[38:15] not looking at daniel seven weeks over
[38:17] here the statue of a perfect man over
[38:19] here and the headstone over here and all
[38:22] these different parts and pieces all
[38:23] laying separate but christ comes and
[38:26] puts it together for you and you see him
[38:30] you've got to know him and the power of
[38:32] his resurrection you got to see who he
[38:34] is
[38:36] and don't do it don't do you any good
[38:38] just to read read about him on the page
[38:41] but when he becomes a living reality to
[38:43] you that's what the anchory is
[38:46] paul stood right in the midst of the
[38:48] people those jews and so forth he knowed
[38:50] who he had believed
[38:51] he would by no means have did it if he
[38:53] hadn't found something that was
[38:54] genuinely anchored him
[38:57] you think about paul's life before that
[39:00] how he knew the scripture
[39:02] he had said under under gramelia that
[39:04] great teacher and he he could he could
[39:06] talk about the scripture
[39:07] but he didn't have that anchor
[39:10] i'm talking about the anchor now i'm
[39:11] talking about christ
[39:13] not just an intellectual understanding
[39:15] of the word but i'm talking about christ
[39:16] that can make the word live that can
[39:19] fulfill the word in your feet and your
[39:21] hands and your walk and your talk to
[39:23] make these virtues live in you that it's
[39:26] not just something that you read about
[39:28] that it's not like a newspaper anymore
[39:30] but it's like a love letter that you can
[39:32] open up and read between the lines that
[39:34] christ means something to you that it's
[39:36] not just dead letters where you're just
[39:38] coming to church and going through the
[39:40] motions but it's come off the page into
[39:42] your life and it's real to you
[39:45] that's what i'm talking about you've got
[39:47] to be anchored into him are you angry
[39:49] tonight do you know him and the power of
[39:52] his resurrection do you know that he's
[39:54] come forth from that grave and that he's
[39:56] not dead do you know that it's not dead
[39:58] up there in jeffersonville but it's
[40:00] alive tonight and you
[40:04] and brother brown said i think any
[40:05] christian should be that way every
[40:07] believer and meet god upon those sacred
[40:10] sins where there's no philosopher can
[40:12] explain in a way
[40:14] you met god and you know it and there's
[40:16] nothing could ever hide it away from you
[40:19] to come on those sacred sands like moses
[40:21] did where he took his shoes off because
[40:24] he realized that he was on holy ground
[40:26] to realize that there is a real god that
[40:29] there's a real power that's beyond all
[40:31] the things that you can see with your
[40:33] moral eyes
[40:34] that no philosopher can explain it you
[40:36] know what philosophy is philosophy is
[40:38] just trying to
[40:40] trying to trying to piece things
[40:42] together to give you a little bit
[40:43] understanding of the fundamental nature
[40:44] of knowledge and reality and existence
[40:48] trying to trying to
[40:49] like when you talk to somebody and you
[40:50] try to dig in well let me see what let
[40:52] me see what your problem why are you shy
[40:56] why are you why do you have this problem
[40:59] that's all philosophy where you're
[41:01] trying to you're trying to poke around
[41:02] in somebody's psyche and something but
[41:05] that's
[41:06] an experience with god goes beyond all
[41:08] the philosophy where we're trying to
[41:10] piece it together with our intellectual
[41:12] understanding
[41:16] and brotherhood said we have times that
[41:17] we have great scholarship
[41:19] and nothing against that that's all
[41:21] right but all that goes good
[41:23] but you personally have got to meet god
[41:25] to a place that no one can twist any
[41:28] scriptures
[41:29] you were there
[41:32] you're the one that met him
[41:34] you had the experience of it
[41:37] you know him
[41:39] i wonder i wonder if we examined
[41:41] ourselves tonight do you remember where
[41:43] you met god i should remember i sure
[41:45] remember my experience
[41:47] i remember when i when i came to an
[41:49] understanding that
[41:52] there was a god
[41:54] and he loved me and wanted to save me
[41:56] and that he did save me and he come down
[41:58] and did something in my life
[42:01] and i knew that it wasn't just something
[42:03] that i was reading about but it was
[42:04] something real see you've got to come to
[42:07] a place where you meet god for yourself
[42:10] you have an experience just like abraham
[42:13] did and just like moses did and just
[42:15] like paul did and just like david did
[42:18] and all the ones that you read about in
[42:20] the bible is fine to read about it but
[42:22] you do you know god for yourself
[42:24] i'm not talking about where you just
[42:26] come to church and go through the
[42:27] motions but have you fallen in love with
[42:30] god where you're not doing it because
[42:32] somebody screamed and yelled you but
[42:34] because you love god
[42:38] to where you're anchored in christ
[42:41] paul said in hebrews chapter 6 that by
[42:44] two and we're getting to this in sunday
[42:45] school by two immutable things in which
[42:47] it was impossible for god to lie we
[42:49] might have a strong consolation who have
[42:51] fled for refuge to take to lay hold upon
[42:54] the hope set before us which hope we
[42:56] have as an anchor of the soul
[42:58] and that hope
[43:00] is an anchor
[43:01] two immutable things that a god that
[43:03] cannot lie would make a promise that a
[43:05] god that there's no there's no falsehood
[43:08] in him and that god will make a promise
[43:10] that who who is who i justify you're
[43:12] going to be glorified and make a promise
[43:14] that if you'll believe my words you're
[43:16] going to be saved and make a promise
[43:18] that he's going to take you to the end
[43:19] of the road and that's the anchor of our
[43:21] soul the hope that we hold that anchors
[43:24] our life and brother evan said it's just
[43:26] like a ship a ship has an absolute and
[43:29] that ship's absolute is the anchor and
[43:31] there the ship has an absolute it's
[43:33] anchored waves might toss it about but
[43:36] still that ship can stand just perfectly
[43:38] still where it's anchored because it's
[43:40] an absolute to it and if christ is your
[43:43] absolute you're tied to him in that
[43:45] manner no matter what anybody says
[43:49] how hard the persecution gets
[43:52] how bad the storm seems to be
[43:54] you're anchored it doesn't matter what
[43:56] everybody's opinion is it doesn't matter
[43:58] what the world says it doesn't matter
[43:59] what people at school say because you're
[44:02] anchored in him it doesn't matter what
[44:03] your boss says how it looks for it to be
[44:06] how it looks impossible for it to happen
[44:09] it doesn't matter what the doctor says
[44:11] because you're anchored in him we've got
[44:13] that hope of those two immutable things
[44:16] that a god that cannot lie made an oath
[44:18] a god that cannot lie
[44:21] gave us his word he said it he said it
[44:24] whatever he said is my anchor
[44:27] and brother brahma said if something has
[44:29] happened in you that christ becomes your
[44:31] absolute or any promise in the bible
[44:33] becomes your absolute if you're sick and
[44:35] you're praying for healing or something
[44:36] that comes to that strikes that promise
[44:38] in the bible
[44:39] i've got it
[44:41] there's nothing going to wave you from
[44:43] it
[44:45] you need an anchor
[44:48] an absolute that you know
[44:50] because churches will fail
[44:52] and people will fail
[44:54] church opinions about churches will fail
[44:57] thoughts about churches will fail
[44:58] people's opinions about themselves will
[45:01] fail people's doctrines will fail but
[45:03] christ cannot fail
[45:06] how do i know whether i'm right or not
[45:09] this tells whether we got the right
[45:10] absolute or not
[45:12] this tells
[45:13] this tales whether we got the right
[45:15] absolute or not
[45:17] this tells so you can open this up and
[45:19] look into the mirror of god's word and
[45:21] see whether you're tied to it or not
[45:24] he said if you could read in that
[45:25] scripture something that christ has
[45:26] ordained or commissioned us to do and
[45:28] because of some twisting around and
[45:30] someone would tell you that was for the
[45:32] disciples or someone else and then you
[45:34] don't hold on to that
[45:35] then christ is not your your absolute
[45:40] that person who led you out of the way
[45:42] is your absolute
[45:45] see that's why
[45:46] you hear you hear somebody at school you
[45:48] you hear your teacher saying there's no
[45:50] right or wrong there's no truth you hear
[45:51] your friend that girl that yeah at
[45:53] school that you really like that you
[45:55] think she looks real pretty or something
[45:56] and
[45:57] and you want to listen to her but that's
[46:00] that's something that's a tie post
[46:01] that'll lead you astray that'll unravel
[46:03] itself that'll lead you down into the
[46:05] gutter like solomon would say lead you
[46:07] into the pit
[46:09] or you want to get some wisdom go read
[46:11] what solomon would have to say about
[46:12] things like that some a a girl that that
[46:15] would lead you away and she becomes the
[46:17] mouth of hell and all those things you
[46:19] you can't tie yourself to those things
[46:21] you don't see brother i'm saying you you
[46:22] say you must get that absolute that's
[46:25] something that's real that identifies
[46:26] you with christ in his word
[46:28] and the word is christ and you must be
[46:31] sure that you can say amen to that word
[46:34] or your absolute is wrong
[46:36] see your whole identity
[46:38] your id the world doesn't know what
[46:40] their identity is they don't even know
[46:41] whether they're a man or a woman or what
[46:43] what they like or what they don't like
[46:44] or what's true or not or whether that
[46:46] trash can is god or not but your
[46:48] identity your whole identity is in his
[46:50] word
[46:51] you know what identity is
[46:53] the set and qual of qualities and
[46:55] beliefs that make one person a group
[46:58] different from others
[47:00] see your name is what makes you
[47:01] different our name is jesus christ miss
[47:03] jesus christ
[47:05] your name is what makes you different
[47:06] your background is make diff what makes
[47:08] you different the the history of your
[47:11] life as a christian where you come from
[47:13] and where you're going and your goals
[47:15] all that is your identity your goals is
[47:17] what makes you separate from the world
[47:20] your goals is not your goal is not to
[47:22] look like the world or act like the
[47:23] world but to be a christian
[47:25] to be a christian that's what separates
[47:27] you
[47:28] my family
[47:30] this just come to me my family we went a
[47:32] little kayaking trip with the family and
[47:33] we got all the kayaks in the water and
[47:35] we went on a nice little little outing
[47:38] and we came back and on the back of my
[47:41] van i've got that cloud the jeez with
[47:43] the picture of jesus
[47:45] it seems like every time we go kayak and
[47:47] every time i come back somebody wrote
[47:48] something nasty on the back
[47:51] there was some some uh some some dirt on
[47:54] the back of the van and they somebody
[47:55] had written uh something up i i forget
[47:58] exactly what what it was but something
[48:00] about whether or not homosexuality is
[48:02] right god loves everybody like god loves
[48:04] gays and all this kind of stuff and you
[48:06] see because you you put that picture of
[48:08] jesus you identify yourself with christ
[48:11] and you're different and it it's going
[48:14] to cause a reaction because you you you
[48:17] let's just listen to those people that
[48:19] we heard in that video
[48:22] the world is going to think that you're
[48:23] different and it's not because there's
[48:26] something wrong with you it's because
[48:28] there's something wrong with the world
[48:30] if you've got the holy ghost tonight
[48:32] you're the only ones that are in your
[48:35] right mind
[48:36] now to think about that you become jesus
[48:38] was the light of the world when he was
[48:40] on the earth but now you are the light
[48:42] of the world because christ that same
[48:44] christ is living in you and wherever you
[48:46] go you're a testament to the to the
[48:48] insanity of the world a world that
[48:50] doesn't know what's right or wrong that
[48:52] doesn't know what's black or white it
[48:54] doesn't know what's true or false but
[48:56] you are a living witness a living
[48:58] testament of what's
[49:00] right because you've got that holy ghost
[49:03] and the holy ghost brother said the holy
[49:04] ghost in you is like a compass that only
[49:06] points to the word just like the compass
[49:08] only points to the north star the north
[49:11] star that's unmoving the north star that
[49:13] is unchanging in the sky and the holy
[49:15] ghost in you always will take you back
[49:17] to the word he said you can't look up
[49:19] here and say this is shine and this star
[49:21] shines here and after a while it shines
[49:23] somewhere else see you've got to get
[49:25] somewhere where it's absolutely
[49:27] established and that's what the holy
[49:29] ghost does and you're down in your soul
[49:31] it's established that it knows where the
[49:33] north star is it knows what it's
[49:35] anchored to that it's anchored to this
[49:37] word
[49:38] there must be an absolute in your life
[49:41] you've got to have it somewhere and
[49:42] every one of you has got one
[49:45] you can't go on without one
[49:47] you've got to have an absolute
[49:50] now he would say there was a time when
[49:51] germany when germany when adolf hitler
[49:53] was an absolute in germany
[49:55] now what did that mean with that adolf
[49:57] hitler was an absolute
[49:59] no matter what anybody said hitler was
[50:02] the last word
[50:03] if anybody come to him
[50:05] if if
[50:06] i was actually reading the history of
[50:08] where where people would would have
[50:09] opinions different from hitler and
[50:11] hitler bring them up for execution and
[50:13] they would they would come up with all
[50:14] their different excuses and things well
[50:16] well i didn't know you were going to
[50:18] kill me i didn't know this and that but
[50:20] all their excuses and their opinions
[50:22] didn't matter because he was the
[50:24] absolute and when they came you see he
[50:26] was the one that determined who lived or
[50:27] died who was promoted or demoted he was
[50:30] the absolute you come up to him and his
[50:32] word was the final word that's what the
[50:34] absolute is
[50:36] mussolini was the absolute in in his day
[50:39] all those italian black shirts they had
[50:41] they actually had a motto if you go back
[50:43] and read the history of the italian
[50:44] black shirts that would go around and
[50:46] arrest you if you had an idea different
[50:48] from mussolini and it was it was really
[50:50] really horrible i certainly can't say it
[50:52] from behind the pulpit but the gist of
[50:55] it was was we don't care about you we
[50:58] don't care that was their motto so you
[51:00] come up with all your excuses and all
[51:02] your schemes and all your opinions and
[51:04] it didn't matter because mussolini was
[51:06] the final authority he was the absolute
[51:10] brother i'm going to talk about now this
[51:11] is funny he would talk about that was a
[51:13] woman's word that she had there was this
[51:15] lady that used to write in the
[51:16] newspapers called emily post and her
[51:18] word was at the absolute on how you
[51:20] should act at weddings and how you
[51:22] should act at the table how which fork
[51:24] you should use and which spoon you you
[51:26] should use and how you should act at
[51:28] funerals what kind of cloak whether you
[51:29] should wear white or black at funerals
[51:31] and we know you accordingly post you're
[51:33] supposed to wear black at funerals
[51:35] you're not supposed to wear white at a
[51:36] wedding except for the for the bride and
[51:39] all this stuff came from emily post who
[51:41] was the absolute so if you had any any
[51:43] qualms or any disagreements or any
[51:45] opinions about table manners or what
[51:47] spoon you're supposed to use you got to
[51:49] take it back to emily post because she
[51:51] was the absolute she was the final
[51:53] authority
[51:56] you know my wife's family they came from
[51:58] romania when chaucesky was ruler and he
[52:01] was the absolute they got all these
[52:02] stories about he would say give me your
[52:04] cow and you got to give him your cow
[52:05] give me your give me your crops you got
[52:07] to give him your crops because he was
[52:08] the absolute and if you disagreed with
[52:10] him well he'd have you thrown in prison
[52:12] because his word was the final authority
[52:15] and it didn't matter what your opinion
[52:16] is you see what i'm getting at it this
[52:18] afternoon it doesn't matter what our
[52:20] opinions are we we think so many times
[52:22] that our opinions are so great and we
[52:24] will argue with our mom and dad or
[52:26] whether our co or whether different
[52:27] people at church or whatever and we
[52:29] think that that we know what it's all
[52:30] about but you see ultimately your
[52:32] opinion doesn't matter you got to find
[52:35] something that you can base everything
[52:36] on you got to go back to a
[52:38] foundation not just some tree that you
[52:40] lay your hands on and say i believe i'm
[52:42] going to be healed but it's got to go
[52:43] back to a foundation it's got to go back
[52:46] to something real and that's what truth
[52:48] is something real
[52:50] something real not just some trash can
[52:53] or something where well i think that
[52:54] might be god or or whatever but it's
[52:57] something it's the real thing
[52:58] it's real
[53:00] real
[53:04] there was a time when pharaoh was the
[53:05] absolute of egypt and whatever pharaoh
[53:08] said had to be done but you know you
[53:10] know now if you want to go find out what
[53:11] happened to pharaoh you got to go out
[53:13] into the desert and you got to go dig
[53:15] down in the ground you got to dig 20
[53:17] feet in the ground to find out where
[53:19] their throne was because it was not a
[53:22] firm foundation
[53:24] now they're all covered up with dust and
[53:26] i went we went to the museum one time to
[53:28] see i think it was ramsey's mummy when
[53:30] it was touring and we were i stood there
[53:32] and looked at his at his mummy and his
[53:34] face his nose had all fallen in
[53:36] and he looked all decayed and to think
[53:38] that once upon a time that was a great
[53:40] pharaoh that set up on the throne and he
[53:43] was the one that doled out punishment
[53:44] and said you're going to live and you're
[53:46] going to die but now his nose is caving
[53:48] in and we're standing around with all
[53:49] our kids and strollers and stuff looking
[53:51] at him thinking
[53:52] wow
[53:53] look at that
[53:55] you see
[53:56] you say what kind of an absolute is that
[53:58] something we think we think things are
[53:59] so great here that we can look we think
[54:01] we're we're so great but but there he
[54:03] was in a museum behind place of glass
[54:06] and all these people were crowding in
[54:08] paying fifty dollars each or however
[54:10] much it wasn't to get in and listening
[54:12] to a little audio recorder telling about
[54:14] ramses and that's all that his life
[54:16] amounted to was people that he never
[54:18] would have thought looking at him
[54:20] looking at his decayed corpse
[54:22] listening to an audio recorder
[54:25] you got to dig 20 feet in the ground to
[54:27] find where their thrones was is what
[54:29] brother ram said it's perished and gone
[54:31] and the people that relied upon that
[54:33] kind of an absolute they are perished
[54:35] with it and gone on it was man-made and
[54:37] anything that's man-made will perish
[54:39] with man
[54:40] but there is an absolute they cannot
[54:42] perish
[54:43] and that's the eternal word of god
[54:45] pharaoh comparison mussolini they hung
[54:48] upside down in the street after they
[54:49] shot him josh kiskew what they did
[54:52] something similar with him i forget what
[54:54] happened shot him they shot him
[54:56] and all these but you see there's that's
[54:58] an absolute that perishes but we've got
[55:00] an eternal word of god that will never
[55:02] die it can never perish
[55:04] you stay with it
[55:06] you got to have an absolute in
[55:08] everything you do
[55:11] you know you think about all this all
[55:13] this stuff in the news lately about roe
[55:14] versus wade how the supreme court's
[55:16] going to going to reverse that and how
[55:18] they take it all the way up to the the
[55:19] highest court in the land but you see
[55:22] the supreme court is the absolute so
[55:24] whatever the supreme court says that's
[55:26] the final say you say well i i don't i
[55:28] disagree with that i don't i don't like
[55:30] their opinion and see our opinions if
[55:32] you go if you would go to stand in front
[55:34] of those nine supreme court supreme
[55:35] court justices it wouldn't matter to
[55:37] them because they'd say our law is final
[55:40] and because as far as the united states
[55:42] laws go the supreme court is final
[55:45] and brother adam said they we got an
[55:47] absolute here we go out and have a trial
[55:50] and you get into trouble and you have a
[55:51] trial here in the city they can take it
[55:53] up through other courts and so forth it
[55:54] might finally come to the supreme court
[55:56] but the supreme court's decision is the
[55:58] absolute that's the end of trials that's
[56:01] all the further you can go that's the
[56:03] last court it's the supreme court and
[56:05] that's an absolute
[56:07] i was looking up all these controversial
[56:09] opinions of the supreme court decisions
[56:11] of the supreme court brown versus board
[56:13] of education
[56:15] plessy versus ferguson all these
[56:17] dred scott versus sam dredd scott you
[56:20] all remember that dread the dread case
[56:22] where the supreme court said that if
[56:24] you're african-american you don't even
[56:26] have a right to be a united states
[56:28] citizen but that was a decision of the
[56:30] supreme court at the time and you could
[56:32] say well my opinions are different but
[56:34] it's the supreme court the supreme court
[56:36] all the roe versus suede
[56:38] bush versus gore
[56:40] if you all remember that supreme court
[56:42] decision bruce forced a score and
[56:44] everybody was divided over it but the
[56:45] supreme court decided and they made the
[56:47] decision and your opinion didn't matter
[56:50] when they made their decision
[56:53] giafalo versus washington was the last
[56:55] decision over the i think that was the
[56:57] the last election they made a decision
[56:59] over how the votes were going to be
[57:00] counted or something i i forget the
[57:01] details but the point is the point
[57:03] stands when the supreme court makes a
[57:05] decision you can argue until you're blue
[57:07] in the face but they're the absolute
[57:09] they're the final decision and brother
[57:11] brown said sometimes we don't agree with
[57:13] them or like their decisions but just
[57:15] the same it's the absolute because the
[57:18] nation is tied to it see what the
[57:20] supreme court says
[57:23] you see sometimes we don't like what the
[57:24] bible says but it's our absolute jezebel
[57:27] didn't like it in her day she wanted to
[57:29] wear all her makeup and flirt with jehu
[57:31] and all that stuff but yet elijah in
[57:33] that day representing the word of god
[57:35] was her absolute it don't matter what
[57:38] our opinions is you you got to have you
[57:40] got to have an absolute if i can get my
[57:42] word straight you got to have an
[57:44] absolute in everything
[57:45] you go down to the ball field and
[57:47] somebody i work with the other day that
[57:49] we went down to the atlanta braves and
[57:51] watched the ball game and they were
[57:52] sitting there and watching all the
[57:53] umpires and stuff and you know even in a
[57:55] ball game you got to have an absolute
[57:56] and that umpire is the is the absolute
[58:00] if if there's any decision now brother
[58:02] brown would say he said don't argue with
[58:03] him
[58:04] he's there he's the absolute in that
[58:06] ball game he's the absolute you said you
[58:09] can't argue with him not many people do
[58:10] you go to the the youth ball games and
[58:13] stuff and you see parents leaning over
[58:14] the fence yelling you can't throw my kid
[58:17] out you can't do that they argue until
[58:19] they're blue in the face but what good
[58:20] does it do in the end because the umpire
[58:23] is the absolute
[58:25] our umpire is the absolute
[58:27] and a ball a ball game can't operate
[58:29] right without an absolute and that's the
[58:31] umpire
[58:32] sometimes we don't like his decisions
[58:35] but it don't matter because he's the
[58:36] absolute
[58:37] well i don't like the way we have to
[58:39] dress and i don't like but you know if
[58:41] you line up with the word you can claim
[58:43] all these benefits
[58:45] there's a there's plenty of stuff to
[58:46] like in the word of god if you pay your
[58:48] tithes he rebuked the devourer if you if
[58:51] you become a christian you can claim the
[58:53] benefits package if you get that token
[58:55] you can hold it over your prayer and
[58:57] watch god answer your prayer watch god
[58:59] move on the scene for your family in
[59:01] your life if you've got that token to
[59:03] hold over your prayer watch things
[59:09] brother around said what if there was no
[59:10] umpire in the game
[59:12] what kind of a fuss would it be
[59:14] it would all be chaos
[59:15] that's why you need an absolute to bring
[59:18] order to chaos
[59:19] that's what the supreme court does is to
[59:21] bring order to chaos that's what the
[59:23] umpire does is to bring order to chaos
[59:26] if somebody slides into home plate and
[59:27] it looks like everybody's arguing over
[59:30] whether or not they were safe
[59:32] the umpire comes out and brings order to
[59:34] all that chaos and says this is that
[59:37] and declares what it is
[59:39] you couldn't play the game without
[59:40] having an absolute in it
[59:42] what about life
[59:45] it has to have a resting place
[59:47] and every moral here this afternoon has
[59:49] got your absolute somewhere your
[59:51] ultimate that's the last word
[59:54] an absolute brings order to chaos
[59:58] you go through traffic you know you ever
[1:00:00] come to it when the power goes out and
[1:00:02] you're trying to and it's raining you go
[1:00:03] to a stop light and and the and the
[1:00:05] lights are all blinking and it seems
[1:00:07] like madness trying to get to that stop
[1:00:09] light but the stop light is the absolute
[1:00:11] and that stop light brings order to the
[1:00:13] chaos if the stop light's working
[1:00:15] properly when it turns red you just know
[1:00:17] to stop because you're you're in you're
[1:00:19] in line with what that absolute is and
[1:00:21] you play hate behave what the absolute
[1:00:23] tells you to do
[1:00:24] and the program will say what if that
[1:00:26] red light don't work one would say i'll
[1:00:28] go here first and the other one will say
[1:00:30] i'm in a hurry to go to work and you
[1:00:32] talk about madness and talk about a
[1:00:34] traffic jam because
[1:00:36] without an absolute then you end up with
[1:00:39] what we just watched in that video with
[1:00:41] people running to and fro and getting
[1:00:43] depressed and having to be
[1:00:46] on all kinds of pills and
[1:00:47] antidepressants and not knowing what the
[1:00:49] meaning of life is and not knowing what
[1:00:51] they're supposed to be doing and whether
[1:00:53] they're boy or girl whether they like
[1:00:55] men or women and all kinds of chaos
[1:00:57] because whether or not without an
[1:00:59] absolute it's just a bunch of chaos
[1:01:01] there's got to be something that's right
[1:01:04] there's got to be something that's true
[1:01:07] there must be something there to say you
[1:01:09] go and you wait and so forth or we'd be
[1:01:11] all messed up
[1:01:13] we'd be all messed up without that
[1:01:16] christ is our absolute
[1:01:18] in john chapter 5 verse 24 he said
[1:01:20] verily verily i say unto you
[1:01:22] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:01:24] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:01:26] and shall not come into condemnation but
[1:01:28] is passed from death unto life
[1:01:30] now that's something you can hang on
[1:01:32] everything on
[1:01:33] he that heareth my word and believeth on
[1:01:35] him that sent me hath everlasting life
[1:01:37] if you hear that word and you've you've
[1:01:39] hung on to it until it become something
[1:01:42] real to you and you've got a personal
[1:01:43] relationship with jesus christ
[1:01:45] that's an anchor for the soul
[1:01:48] in john chapter 14 verse 12 verily
[1:01:50] verily i say unto you he that believeth
[1:01:51] on me the works that i do shall he do
[1:01:53] also in greater works than these shall
[1:01:55] he do
[1:01:56] there's an anchor
[1:01:58] there's an anchor that when you come to
[1:01:59] church if you believe that scripture you
[1:02:01] can have hands laid on you and devils
[1:02:03] cast out and and
[1:02:05] and healing in your body if you believe
[1:02:08] if you're anchored to that type post
[1:02:11] brother would say the reason we've got
[1:02:13] into there is because that every one of
[1:02:14] us make our own absolute
[1:02:16] what what's our absolute my viewpoint is
[1:02:18] right
[1:02:19] the way i see things is right my chi my
[1:02:21] children are right the way my children
[1:02:23] are doing things is right my family's
[1:02:25] right our own opinion my family my
[1:02:28] opinion and everything else is wrong
[1:02:30] sometimes you can even say well my
[1:02:31] church is right but all that stuff all
[1:02:34] that
[1:02:35] pales in comparison to this ass absolute
[1:02:38] i'm not i'm talking about this absolute
[1:02:39] something that's real
[1:02:41] brother brown will say each church has
[1:02:43] its absolute
[1:02:44] each group has its own absolute and they
[1:02:47] say each one of them say we are the
[1:02:48] truth the way we got it all
[1:02:51] you see when you start saying that
[1:02:53] you're treading on dangerous ground
[1:02:56] we got it all we
[1:02:58] know he's the one that's got it all
[1:03:00] we got it all
[1:03:02] you ain't got nothing to do with it
[1:03:04] brother ryan said
[1:03:05] you're in a minority
[1:03:07] you say we're the greatest group
[1:03:09] no he's the one that everything is based
[1:03:12] on
[1:03:14] we say we are the truth and the way
[1:03:16] but there's really only one way
[1:03:19] and christ is that way
[1:03:23] you see why the word the bible says the
[1:03:25] word will transform your mind
[1:03:28] will transform your thinking to
[1:03:30] from listening to all that junk out
[1:03:32] there in the world to where you realize
[1:03:35] you know if i'm born a girl i'm a girl
[1:03:38] if i'm born a man i'm a man
[1:03:40] i i get all that homosexual tommy right
[1:03:43] out of your mind get all that untruth
[1:03:45] and all that all that filth of the world
[1:03:46] out of your mind get under under
[1:03:48] subjection to the word of god and let it
[1:03:50] claim hold of your life
[1:03:52] let god have preeminence in your life
[1:03:54] and god will change you to where you're
[1:03:56] thinking is right the world don't know
[1:03:58] how to think they don't even know what's
[1:04:00] right or wrong but this bible will
[1:04:02] straighten up your thinking to where
[1:04:04] you're thinking right
[1:04:07] listen to what jesus said
[1:04:10] he said i am the way
[1:04:12] the truth and the life
[1:04:14] no man cometh unto the father but by me
[1:04:18] he's the only way
[1:04:20] listen
[1:04:21] it's bold these days to say buddhism and
[1:04:24] and of the muslim and all
[1:04:26] the different faiths the sikhs and the
[1:04:28] jains and everything else is wrong
[1:04:31] because we believe that there is a wrong
[1:04:33] and a right
[1:04:34] there is a right everybody is not right
[1:04:37] there is a right and jesus said i am the
[1:04:39] way the truth and the life he said i am
[1:04:42] the vine
[1:04:43] you are the branches he he made it he
[1:04:46] anchored it down so you have something
[1:04:48] to hang on to
[1:04:49] he said i am the living bread which came
[1:04:52] down from heaven
[1:04:53] i am the living bread if any man eat of
[1:04:56] this bread he shall live forever and the
[1:04:58] bread that i will give as my flesh which
[1:05:00] i will give for the life of the world
[1:05:02] he said as long as i'm in the world
[1:05:04] i'm the light of the world
[1:05:06] as long as i'm in the world i am the
[1:05:09] light of the world
[1:05:11] he said i am the door
[1:05:13] by me if any man enter in he shall be
[1:05:16] saved and shall go in and out and find
[1:05:18] pasture
[1:05:19] he's making it real that there is a
[1:05:21] truth and he is that truth
[1:05:24] he said jesus said unto her i am the
[1:05:26] resurrection and the life he that
[1:05:28] believeth in me though he were dead yet
[1:05:31] shall he live
[1:05:33] you believe these statements it's going
[1:05:34] to make you weird to the world not
[1:05:36] because you act weird but because the
[1:05:38] word makes you just it's weird to the
[1:05:41] world
[1:05:43] he said i am the true vine and my father
[1:05:46] is the husbandman
[1:05:48] he said fear not
[1:05:49] i am
[1:05:51] the first and the last i am he that
[1:05:53] liveth and was dead and behold i am
[1:05:55] alive forevermore and have the keys of
[1:05:58] hell and of death
[1:05:59] that's the hope that we have anchored
[1:06:01] our souls to i a hope that you can
[1:06:04] anchor everything onto and brother i'm
[1:06:06] saying you've got to have something that
[1:06:08] we could come to and say this is it and
[1:06:11] it can be proven that's it that's what
[1:06:12] it is see him
[1:06:15] how is it proven it's vindicated
[1:06:17] vindicated by signs and wonder you can
[1:06:19] you can just look young people you can
[1:06:20] look at the lives of your mother and
[1:06:22] father and see how god has changed them
[1:06:25] see how they act different than than the
[1:06:27] way that they talk about how they used
[1:06:28] to be you can look around you and see
[1:06:30] the miracles that have been brought
[1:06:32] wrought right here in our midst of
[1:06:34] people being healed of uh you talk about
[1:06:37] brother ryan's daughter that's been
[1:06:38] healed of the epilepsy and and
[1:06:41] you could go down the list of all the
[1:06:42] different ones of sister regina that
[1:06:44] that problem with her with her throat
[1:06:46] she was healed of and paul that was
[1:06:48] raised up from his sick bed in the
[1:06:50] hospital when he had covered you go down
[1:06:52] the list of all the ones that have been
[1:06:54] touched by the hand of an almighty god
[1:06:56] but why because we've been we've been
[1:06:58] anchored we've been tied into the
[1:06:59] benefits
[1:07:03] you know god is real
[1:07:05] he there is a real god we were talking
[1:07:07] to coming up that we were just talking
[1:07:09] to somebody that was talking about their
[1:07:10] aunt that was sitting in a meeting
[1:07:12] i'm gonna share this and she said she
[1:07:14] looked over and she saw on the end of
[1:07:16] the pew and angel sitting there
[1:07:18] and the angel was listening to the
[1:07:19] preacher
[1:07:20] and nobody knew that that angel was
[1:07:22] sitting there and after a while the
[1:07:23] angel got up
[1:07:25] and walked down the aisle and she was
[1:07:27] watching this
[1:07:28] and he sat down next to the piano player
[1:07:31] now you think what what would you do if
[1:07:33] you saw that i sat down next to the
[1:07:35] piano player
[1:07:36] and watched her play the piano
[1:07:39] and she saw and you see listen how many
[1:07:42] times are there angels in our midst
[1:07:45] and we're unaware
[1:07:47] because we've just become we've gotten
[1:07:49] it it's become common to us and we've
[1:07:50] become and now we're not enthralled with
[1:07:53] the word anymore and it's not we're more
[1:07:54] entertained by what we watch on tv and
[1:07:57] stuff than something that will anchor
[1:07:59] our souls that will give us life
[1:08:02] and you think that that angels are in
[1:08:04] our midst right now they're they're in
[1:08:06] our why why
[1:08:07] we know that they're in our midst
[1:08:08] because the bible says that the angels
[1:08:10] of god and camp around those that fear
[1:08:13] him they actually camp out they camp out
[1:08:16] when you're home when you're in your
[1:08:18] prayer closet when you're driving to
[1:08:20] work they're camped out around you
[1:08:22] so you know if two or three gather
[1:08:24] together that he'll be in our midst that
[1:08:26] he's kept around here
[1:08:28] but we just our eyes are holding from
[1:08:30] actually seeing it but every once in a
[1:08:31] while you might bump into something and
[1:08:33] you feel something change something some
[1:08:35] emotion or something but god is real
[1:08:38] he's here and he's more real than all
[1:08:41] that junk that they feed you at school
[1:08:43] and all that trash that your friends try
[1:08:45] to tell you try to cram down your throat
[1:08:47] at school god is real
[1:08:50] there's an anchor for the soul that is
[1:08:52] real
[1:08:54] amen brother ram will say every man in
[1:08:56] his own sight say well now if i want to
[1:08:59] take the golden rule
[1:09:01] if i want to do this or some religion
[1:09:04] i believe my religion is do so and so
[1:09:07] and so
[1:09:08] and he'd say it's got to where it's like
[1:09:09] it was in the bible where it said every
[1:09:12] man just does as it was writing his own
[1:09:14] eyes where you just say well i go to
[1:09:16] sunday school on sunday morning
[1:09:18] i keep the 10 commandments and i keep
[1:09:20] the sabbath day all that's good but if
[1:09:23] you haven't got something a little more
[1:09:25] than going to sunday school
[1:09:29] let me ask you this do you love god do
[1:09:32] you really love god
[1:09:34] or do you just kind of like like coming
[1:09:36] to church and kind of going through the
[1:09:37] motions are you really in love with god
[1:09:41] if you've fallen out of love with god
[1:09:44] it's time to go back to where you left
[1:09:45] him from and you can go back tonight to
[1:09:48] that spot where you left him from and
[1:09:49] fall back in love with him fall back
[1:09:51] where you where maybe you left him you
[1:09:54] left that prayer closet you left him
[1:09:56] alone you left that alone time with god
[1:09:58] where you get on your back porch with
[1:09:59] your coffee in the morning or in the
[1:10:01] evening time and you sit alone and talk
[1:10:03] to god it's time to go back and fall in
[1:10:06] love with god again
[1:10:08] everybody thinks well they just do what
[1:10:10] they think is right but that don't make
[1:10:12] it right in proverbs it says there's a
[1:10:14] way that seemeth right unto a man but
[1:10:16] the end thereof are the ways of death
[1:10:19] what way would seem right to a man his
[1:10:21] own ideas and his own opinions
[1:10:25] the opinions of his fellows the opinions
[1:10:27] of his schoolmates and other teachers
[1:10:29] that have their own idea i remember when
[1:10:31] i was in school i had some teachers that
[1:10:32] would they would come up with some
[1:10:34] doozies i remember i had a teacher that
[1:10:35] would say
[1:10:37] she'd say who would want to live forever
[1:10:39] because some books she read
[1:10:42] listen i want eternal life
[1:10:46] i want to live and reign with christ
[1:10:47] forever i i see you listen to all that
[1:10:50] junk that teachers are put pop in your
[1:10:52] head and
[1:10:54] there's a way that seemeth right into a
[1:10:56] man but the end thereof are the ways of
[1:10:58] death but his word is life
[1:11:01] in john chapter 6 it said his is the
[1:11:03] spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet
[1:11:05] if nothing the words that i speak unto
[1:11:07] you they are spirit and they are life
[1:11:09] brother adam said the word has to abide
[1:11:12] in you
[1:11:12] if ye abide in me and christ
[1:11:15] and my word and you
[1:11:17] then how do we get into christ
[1:11:19] by baptism of the holy spirit
[1:11:22] then that's one part
[1:11:24] but then if you abide in me and then my
[1:11:26] words abide in you then you can ask what
[1:11:28] you will
[1:11:29] but you have to have both
[1:11:31] christ
[1:11:32] and word
[1:11:33] spirit and truth
[1:11:35] the oil and the meal
[1:11:37] and you really can't have one without
[1:11:39] the other because it's the self-same
[1:11:41] thing
[1:11:45] you got to have that absolute
[1:11:50] i know the hour's getting late but i got
[1:11:52] to finish this
[1:11:54] yo y'all hang on with me now
[1:11:57] he said you see we take we take
[1:11:59] something else for an absolute
[1:12:02] when dr davis come to me and wanted him
[1:12:04] to do he said a certain thing there that
[1:12:06] absolutely was unscripture what was that
[1:12:07] thing that dr davis wanted to do that
[1:12:09] back there at the baptist church he
[1:12:11] wanted him to ordain women preachers
[1:12:14] but that wasn't that wasn't in what he
[1:12:16] was anchored to
[1:12:17] and he said i am tied to the word
[1:12:20] let every man's word be a lie and mind
[1:12:22] be the truth
[1:12:23] that was his absolute
[1:12:25] if you're tied to that word
[1:12:28] god's word is first
[1:12:30] god is right his word is right others
[1:12:33] are not right
[1:12:36] he said we got so many ties one pulling
[1:12:38] this way and one that way and one
[1:12:40] against the other what we need is the
[1:12:42] full gospel planted in a full heart with
[1:12:45] a full power to bring a full
[1:12:48] absolute you know brother brown would
[1:12:50] talk about he said them old timers
[1:12:53] you look back at the old timer billy
[1:12:54] sunday and all the ones that brother
[1:12:56] brown that picture with hope where he
[1:12:58] would get on the street corner and play
[1:13:00] it play his instrument or what plays
[1:13:01] tambourine and stuff and he he had he
[1:13:04] was tied to something where he'd get out
[1:13:05] on that street corner he didn't care if
[1:13:06] people mocked him or
[1:13:08] threw threw tomatoes at him or whatever
[1:13:10] and he'd say the old-timers were tied to
[1:13:12] an absolute
[1:13:14] he said that's the way pentecost is
[1:13:15] today your mother and father would have
[1:13:16] had a spasm if they had thought you'd
[1:13:18] have god in this kind of condition
[1:13:20] that's what god wants us to do he wants
[1:13:22] us to be real men and women of god
[1:13:25] anchored to something real bold with the
[1:13:27] truth he said them old-timers are tied
[1:13:29] to that absolute and held onto that word
[1:13:31] regardless of what it was they walked in
[1:13:34] the spirit and went out and done
[1:13:35] miracles and performed things
[1:13:37] they had azusa street meetings going
[1:13:39] everywhere brush arbor meetings you
[1:13:40] can't even get me in on the street
[1:13:42] corner anymore to
[1:13:44] testify and paul was one of them
[1:13:46] old-timers and he was anchored to
[1:13:48] something real
[1:13:50] because he said none of these things
[1:13:51] move me
[1:13:53] not one of these things move me
[1:13:55] i don't care if they stone me to death
[1:13:57] i don't care if they lure me in a basket
[1:13:59] over the wall
[1:14:00] i don't have care if i have to go if i
[1:14:02] get bit by a snake and i have to throw
[1:14:04] it in the fire
[1:14:06] i don't care if all these things assail
[1:14:08] me
[1:14:08] none of these things move me because he
[1:14:10] was anchored
[1:14:12] he was anchored to his purpose god had a
[1:14:14] purpose for paul and what was his
[1:14:15] purpose to do his will
[1:14:18] to fulfill his will
[1:14:20] now i'm wrapping up here i
[1:14:22] i'm not i'm not really going to go along
[1:14:27] i'm not
[1:14:29] brother i said look look how
[1:14:31] look how much different
[1:14:33] this word is from stuff you get out in
[1:14:35] the world
[1:14:36] he's so much different from others i see
[1:14:39] this is brother brown's word he said
[1:14:40] always there's something pulling
[1:14:42] everywhere you go there's something
[1:14:43] pulling you in the world your teachers
[1:14:45] your
[1:14:46] all these ads you go to facebook or tick
[1:14:49] tock
[1:14:50] tick tocks a bunch of nonsense
[1:14:52] instagram all that stuff and all these
[1:14:54] ads are popping up and what are they
[1:14:55] doing they're pulling you this way and
[1:14:57] pulling you that pulling you to buy this
[1:14:59] and pulling you to do this and pulling
[1:15:01] you to buy this book pulling you to get
[1:15:02] this self-help book pulling you to this
[1:15:04] and that
[1:15:05] but in this here
[1:15:07] you pull nothing
[1:15:09] the only thing that's brought down on
[1:15:11] you
[1:15:12] it's the absolute
[1:15:14] and brother and would go on to say he
[1:15:16] said the new and old testament coincides
[1:15:18] with one another like a dovetail piece
[1:15:19] of board coming together well he's
[1:15:21] explaining how this is different
[1:15:24] it it all dovetails together it's not
[1:15:27] just something that's all these
[1:15:28] different lectures or philosophy
[1:15:30] many men wrote that book that 66 books
[1:15:32] of the bible they wrote it in a span of
[1:15:34] hundreds and hundreds of years apart one
[1:15:36] not knowing the other you can't make one
[1:15:38] word contradict the other one
[1:15:41] not one word in this bible contradicts
[1:15:44] the other one
[1:15:45] and that is a miracle
[1:15:47] that not one word
[1:15:49] from the time that job wrote his book to
[1:15:52] moses all the way down
[1:15:56] to john on the isle of patmos
[1:15:58] not one word out of place
[1:16:01] you put your heart right on god's word
[1:16:02] and heaven and heavens and earth will
[1:16:04] pass away
[1:16:05] but that never shall pass away
[1:16:08] that's the absolute the solid foundation
[1:16:10] that's my compass myself that's my god
[1:16:13] that's my light is upon that absolute of
[1:16:15] god's word i'm tied there eternally
[1:16:17] eternally with him by his grace i'm tied
[1:16:22] to him
[1:16:23] what are we tied to
[1:16:25] what's and i'm gonna close on this on
[1:16:27] this thought we're tied not just the
[1:16:29] letters on a page
[1:16:31] but we're tied to that pillar of fire
[1:16:33] the same pillar of fire that anchored
[1:16:35] moses you know brother brown would say
[1:16:37] when moses met that pillar of fire he
[1:16:39] talked to that in the burning bush he
[1:16:41] talked to it but then the fire came out
[1:16:43] of the burning bush
[1:16:44] and went in moses
[1:16:46] and moses got on fire enough that he
[1:16:49] went down
[1:16:50] he went down to conquer egypt with a
[1:16:51] little a little donkey and his wife and
[1:16:53] his little child
[1:16:54] and and no army behind behind him
[1:16:56] because he was on fire for god
[1:16:59] you think about what happened on the day
[1:17:01] of pentecost that pillar of fire the
[1:17:02] same pillar of fire that paul met the
[1:17:04] same pillar of fire that moses met
[1:17:07] went into those people on the day of
[1:17:09] pentecost why because because the bible
[1:17:12] says that he'll baptize that's what john
[1:17:13] said there's one that's going to baptize
[1:17:16] you with the holy ghost and fire
[1:17:18] now you see we we've got the picture of
[1:17:20] the pillar of fire on our wall and we
[1:17:22] talk about the pillar of fire but that's
[1:17:23] our identification that was brother
[1:17:25] brown's identification but we are
[1:17:27] identified with that pillar of fire too
[1:17:29] because that pillar of fire is the
[1:17:31] anointing of god
[1:17:32] it's the life of god it's the anchor of
[1:17:34] god the anchor to our soul that anchors
[1:17:37] us that we're tied to
[1:17:39] not just our intellectual conception of
[1:17:41] the word
[1:17:42] but the revealed christ moving among his
[1:17:45] people
[1:17:47] let me get to that quote
[1:17:49] brother brown said in questions and
[1:17:51] answers somebody said was the pillar of
[1:17:53] fire
[1:17:54] the son of man
[1:17:56] and he said no
[1:17:58] the pillar of fire
[1:18:01] is the anointing
[1:18:03] now you think about meditate on that
[1:18:05] is the pillar of fire the son of man
[1:18:08] and we know we've been taught it's been
[1:18:09] laid out to us the the son of man is the
[1:18:12] word the fullness of god back in flesh
[1:18:15] the fullness of god moving in flesh the
[1:18:17] pillar of fire is not the son of man the
[1:18:19] pillar of fire is the anointing he said
[1:18:21] now that pillar of fire is the logos
[1:18:22] that went out of god
[1:18:24] the logos which is actually the
[1:18:26] attribute of the fullness of god
[1:18:28] when god become into it i'm talking
[1:18:30] about our anchor now y'all don't get
[1:18:32] tired on me when i'm wrapping up
[1:18:35] this is the thing we're anchored to
[1:18:37] when god become into a form to where it
[1:18:40] could be seen
[1:18:41] it was the anointing of the great spirit
[1:18:43] that went forth it's condescending
[1:18:46] coming down god the father the logos
[1:18:48] that was up over israel he was holy
[1:18:50] could not bear sin there had to be a
[1:18:52] blood offering right and eden then that
[1:18:55] logos
[1:18:56] become flesh
[1:18:59] that pillar of fire come into flesh
[1:19:02] and dwelt among us
[1:19:04] and where this logos dwell in a human
[1:19:07] body which was the sacrifice
[1:19:09] now let's finish our thought and
[1:19:11] questions and answers number two where
[1:19:12] he said
[1:19:13] then watch the works of it
[1:19:17] it among us
[1:19:19] that pillar of fire the thing that paul
[1:19:21] was angry to the thing that went into
[1:19:23] moses and anchored him
[1:19:25] it among us
[1:19:26] proves the same jesus that once lived in
[1:19:29] palestine
[1:19:31] the same spirit was upon him has come up
[1:19:34] through a body
[1:19:35] until it's come back to headship again
[1:19:38] which is coming soon to claim the body
[1:19:41] the heads coming to the body
[1:19:45] you get it
[1:19:46] that will be the son of god
[1:19:48] the son of man the son of david
[1:19:51] the i am the rose of sharon the lily of
[1:19:53] the valley the morning star
[1:19:55] i am not he i am his servant and the
[1:19:57] pillar of fire is not he it's in spirit
[1:20:00] form which was upon the son of man and
[1:20:03] has come now
[1:20:05] to anoint sons of men
[1:20:08] i'm telling you that's an anchor now
[1:20:10] this with that same pillar of fire that
[1:20:12] anchored moses and that led the children
[1:20:14] of asia israel through the wilderness
[1:20:16] has come now to anoint sons of men to
[1:20:20] bring back a ministry just exactly like
[1:20:23] he said it would be in order for the
[1:20:25] head and the rest of the body to connect
[1:20:27] together
[1:20:29] don't you think we need an
[1:20:30] absolute don't you think we need
[1:20:33] something real
[1:20:34] maybe we could say it like this don't
[1:20:36] you think we got something real
[1:20:38] we got something that the world doesn't
[1:20:40] have we've got we've got the pillar of
[1:20:42] fire in our midst identifying us with
[1:20:45] the risen christ the musicians come
[1:20:47] forward
[1:20:48] that same pillar of fire is here our
[1:20:50] absolute
[1:20:51] our top hosts
[1:20:53] you think
[1:20:54] i've heard so many times people talk
[1:20:56] about well i wonder if christ is really
[1:20:57] doing something but you think about all
[1:20:59] the things that that pillar of fire has
[1:21:01] been doing in this church
[1:21:03] that that pillar of fire would take care
[1:21:05] of brother wade's blood pressure that
[1:21:07] pillar of fire would take care of
[1:21:08] terrence's keys and ryan's daughter's
[1:21:11] seizures and take care of sisters milk
[1:21:13] his brother laying in there in the
[1:21:14] hospital for two weeks and come out of
[1:21:16] the hospital
[1:21:17] take care of take care of paul there in
[1:21:19] the hospital with covet and would move
[1:21:22] on somebody's heart to get right where
[1:21:23] they want to be baptized and you'd never
[1:21:26] see so many people want to get baptized
[1:21:28] that's the effect of that same pillar of
[1:21:30] fire that led moses and paul
[1:21:35] you see god i want to assure you that
[1:21:37] god we've got an absolute and god is in
[1:21:40] our midst god is with us people let's

[1:31:05] bob was saying our youth we really
[1:31:06] appreciate our youth and we want to get
[1:31:08] them for satan does
[1:31:10] we want to try to get god to them
[1:31:12] it's not a formality
[1:31:14] it's a living word of god
[1:31:16] and that absolute whatever it says
[1:31:18] that's what we do
[1:31:20] because that's our absolutely if not
[1:31:21] then you've got another absolute
[1:31:22] something else
[1:31:25] them people on those videos they don't
[1:31:26] know what in the world they got
[1:31:28] you know why they got the devil and
[1:31:30] there's no foundation to the devil
[1:31:33] remember hell has no foundation
[1:31:36] and so satan has no foundation right so
[1:31:38] there's no foundation you can just do
[1:31:40] whatever you want
[1:31:42] whatever you wish it's just whatever
[1:31:43] makes you feel good no that ain't right
