[25:21] that we welcome you uh back with us but

[25:29] to you welcome amen we're reading from
[25:32] Hebrews
[25:36] 6 Hebrews
[25:38] 6 and then from Revelations
[25:42] 1 Hebrews 6 Revelations
[25:48] 1 Hebrews 61 says therefore leaving the
[25:53] principles of the doctrine of Christ let
[25:55] us go on unto perfection
[25:58] not laying again the foundation of
[26:00] repentance from dead works and of Faith
[26:03] toward god of the doctrines of baptisms
[26:07] and of laying on of hands and of
[26:09] resurrection of the dead and of Eternal
[26:12] judgment and this will we do if God
[26:17] permit now like I've been making the
[26:19] statement to you for quite a
[26:21] while Paul saw many many things
[26:24] prophesied of many things spoke of many
[26:26] things to come that he was not able to
[26:29] attain
[26:30] unto but yet he saw
[26:33] them and as far as what he saw is much a
[26:38] reality as to literally being there cuz
[26:41] that's the way the prophet saw
[26:43] it and they would when theyd see
[26:45] something it was like they were there
[26:48] they said about nonon seeing chariots
[26:50] josling in the streets well he saw down
[26:53] to our day when you got Buicks and O
[26:55] mobiles running up and down the
[26:57] expressway the prophet said and running
[27:00] with some cuz non saw him running like
[27:02] torches see they had lights on cars and
[27:06] well he actually saw that but how could
[27:07] he describe that he'd never heard the
[27:10] word Buick it wasn't in existence and
[27:12] expressways and that so he said
[27:15] chariots jostling in the streets but
[27:18] they saw what they
[27:20] saw so that that's what Paul saw it but
[27:23] he wasn't able to attain cuz he's in the
[27:26] grave he was able to make the change
[27:29] that he even literally prophesied of
[27:32] because it wasn't time thank God he
[27:35] didn't you know what cuz you know why
[27:38] cuz we wouldn't be here right if he if
[27:42] he had went there then it wouldn't we
[27:43] wouldn't be here right okay now let's go
[27:45] to Revelations
[27:47] 1 Revelation 1:1 the revelation of Jesus
[27:52] Christ which God gave unto him now
[27:56] notice to show unto him
[27:59] servants things which must come to
[28:02] pass and he sent and signified by his
[28:06] Angel unto his servant John who bear
[28:10] record of the word of God and the
[28:12] testimony of Jesus Christ and of all
[28:15] things that he
[28:17] saw blessed is he that readeth and they
[28:20] that hear the words of this prophecy and
[28:22] keep those things which are written
[28:24] therein for the time is at hand
[28:28] amen you may be seated the Lord add his
[28:30] Blessing to the reading of the
[28:34] word I understand the brother was is a
[28:37] missionary from Honduras that right yes
[28:40] from Honduras from Honduras um let's see
[28:45] used to know a brother there brother did
[28:47] you know a brother named
[28:51] LeAndre little bitty brother name
[28:53] LeAndre he was from Honduras but we're
[28:55] glad to have you with us
[28:59] now we've been speaking for some
[29:04] time about what Paul was saying to the
[29:10] Hebrews and you know they understood a
[29:13] lot of things that's what he was
[29:16] saying he said we we understand the uh
[29:20] doctrines of
[29:22] Christ we understand the resurrection of
[29:25] the
[29:26] Dead we we understand that uh Eternal
[29:33] judgment now he wasn't saying it was
[29:35] eternal
[29:37] hell no cuz that won't work he said
[29:40] Eternal judgment because once God's
[29:42] judgment is set the Judgment itself is
[29:45] eternal he said we understand all those
[29:48] things we understand the
[29:51] godhead we understand the
[29:53] baptisms you know it's plural there too
[29:57] which would be water baptism we
[29:59] understand how to do that we understand
[30:01] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and when
[30:04] it came and what it was to do and things
[30:07] but he said now leaving the principles
[30:11] he call those things
[30:13] principles all right principles in our
[30:17] human language means
[30:21] foundations this building is setting
[30:24] upon a
[30:26] foundation all right now so when Paul
[30:29] was saying leaving the
[30:32] principles he wasn't saying they're no
[30:35] good throw them away you know no no he
[30:40] saying that's what holding us up right
[30:43] cuz according to the Bible we're built
[30:44] on what right the
[30:47] foundation of the Apostles and
[30:50] Prophets so he wasn't saying throwing it
[30:53] away but what was he
[30:56] saying he saying let's go on right right
[31:01] amen go on unto Perfection
[31:04] right all right now was it said he said
[31:08] there this we will do if God
[31:12] permits but God never permitted Paul to
[31:16] go on unto the Perfection that you and I
[31:18] are looking for
[31:21] right you had to go by the grave right
[31:24] and according to Hebrews
[31:26] 11:40 they without us not be made
[31:28] perfect right so he's waiting on you and
[31:31] I amen all right to bring him out of the
[31:34] grave and right cuz Perfection there is
[31:38] meaning uh not totally just
[31:41] completion but that's what he's talking
[31:43] about but it's meaning to car it to the
[31:49] highest height and anything can be
[31:52] brought to right and the highest height
[31:55] of all mankind would be what
[31:59] what is your desire what is the highest
[32:01] thing you could think
[32:03] of having a million
[32:05] dollars put it in the bank you broke
[32:08] tomorrow amen one sign of the pen
[32:13] and big old
[32:15] companies right there was worldwide
[32:18] companies one stroke of the pen and they
[32:22] belong to the
[32:25] government so that couldn't be what we'
[32:27] be want
[32:29] right Health okay we'd all like to be
[32:32] healthy we'd all like to be young again
[32:36] you know
[32:38] but you just get old that's right amen
[32:42] and I went through it one time I don't
[32:43] want to go through it
[32:46] again I've enjoyed life but I don't want
[32:49] to have to go back through it again
[32:52] right so that the Apex of my heart to
[32:56] what the inection I want to come to is a
[33:00] change of this body amen that's right
[33:03] the Rapture okay right and I believe
[33:06] this is the
[33:07] age I believe we're the people that will
[33:11] take the
[33:13] change amen all right and in believing
[33:16] that that way then I believe we have
[33:20] received as I was expressing this
[33:22] morning
[33:28] I don't believe that we need another
[33:30] Prophet no we've had the life Prophet
[33:34] that was promised to the Gentile
[33:37] dispensation when brother Ram came and
[33:39] brought the message that was the last
[33:41] Gentile Prophet now what we call major I
[33:45] believe in a five-fold ministry right am
[33:48] right and in the five-fold ministry you
[33:50] got Apostles
[33:52] prophets evangelist pastors
[33:55] teachers but none of them is the church
[33:59] age Messenger right right we've had the
[34:02] church age messenger we've had the one
[34:04] that was come to to be promised
[34:06] according to
[34:08] Malachi that would turn the hearts of
[34:10] the children back to the faith of the
[34:12] fathers and this being the the fourth
[34:15] coming of
[34:16] Elijah that would be in our
[34:19] day I believe that's already transpired
[34:23] right am but I believe what he said
[34:27] he said the fivefold
[34:29] ministry would take this
[34:32] message and break it down to the people
[34:37] amen all right now that's our job then
[34:41] right until we all come right as the
[34:45] scripture says to the unity of the
[34:48] faith the
[34:50] Revelation that we're supposed to come
[34:52] to so then we're not looking for another
[34:54] Prophet to
[34:56] come we have Great Men Among Us that can
[34:59] carry this message on I believe around
[35:02] the world the Bride of Jesus Christ is
[35:05] receiving the message of the hour
[35:08] amen and progressing on and and then
[35:12] that way it's not my responsibility to
[35:14] be all of
[35:15] it it's not yours it's a worldwide body
[35:19] of Jesus Christ
[35:21] amen and in being that then we each one
[35:24] have our part
[35:26] right but once we put all the parts
[35:29] together I mean may be a little Honduras
[35:32] part connected to a Georgia part you
[35:36] know because that's what it's got to be
[35:40] I mean if you're talking about a body
[35:42] the body of Christ right then you
[35:46] know I mean the best you can do my
[35:48] fingers are still different you know I
[35:52] mean you can say well now you got the
[35:55] same fingerprints yes but they on two
[35:56] different hands
[35:59] you I you know I like it that
[36:01] way because it's my body so we're
[36:05] talking about a body to be built for God
[36:07] to live
[36:08] in and then in doing that then we want
[36:13] to see what the word says about us
[36:17] that's right all right now we spent 40
[36:20] years
[36:22] preaching I'm that's little over 40 you
[36:24] know since the prophet has passed on
[36:27] preaching about the things I think it's
[36:30] about time we begin to realize who we
[36:33] are the prophet of God said when the
[36:36] bride realizes who she is that's right
[36:40] and what her purposes of being
[36:42] here that Satan will be powerless I in
[36:46] the church at his book did he be
[36:49] powerless before us well it's about time
[36:52] to wake up to
[36:54] reality and start accepting What God
[36:57] Says yes you know that God says I'm
[37:02] perfect I might not agree with
[37:05] him you probably wouldn't agree with me
[37:08] about me that ain't got nothing to do
[37:10] with
[37:12] it I didn't have anything to do what God
[37:15] says God says I'm
[37:17] perfect all right now you argue with him
[37:21] about
[37:23] it but you know that's what we're
[37:25] supposed to believe right yeah but
[37:28] Brother D you still do wrong sure we do
[37:31] CU we're
[37:32] human sure we make
[37:35] mistakes but yet God says I'm
[37:38] perfect when are we going to start
[37:40] saying what he said now let's get on to
[37:43] what we were trying to say this
[37:48] morning and you forgive me for being a
[37:50] little cepy because I preach of the
[37:53] morning I get pretty fast and in the
[37:55] evening I have to talk slower okay so
[37:59] maybe the slower talk is easier for you
[38:02] that especially uh just you know kind of
[38:05] know a little bit about the human
[38:06] language of of what we Americans use the
[38:09] reason I say that is we're
[38:12] Southern and it's hard to interpret any
[38:15] of these brothers that would get up here
[38:17] and try to interpret what I say would be
[38:19] a
[38:20] problem because you're taught to say
[38:23] there over there and all of these proper
[38:26] words and and I'm just playing in
[38:28] southern this can be and I just say
[38:30] oh and that's hard to interpret but I
[38:33] know in your language you have word you
[38:36] know have people who talk we used to
[38:38] have a man that come down at Terrance
[38:40] and it worked for him and his name was
[38:42] pops and old pops he'd come down to work
[38:46] a little bit around the house
[38:49] and they' send somebody down to
[38:51] interpret but nobody couldn't interpret
[38:54] pops cuz they said he had his own
[38:56] Spanish
[38:58] language nobody could interpret pops so
[39:01] we've done a lot of sign language I'd
[39:06] say well we got the point you know we
[39:09] know how the language of the land is but
[39:11] forgive me and if you want to know what
[39:13] I said ask somebody
[39:16] else punch someone next to him what did
[39:18] he
[39:20] say all right no no joking just ta is
[39:23] true but now listen we got into this
[39:27] morning talking
[39:28] about how
[39:31] that as I said now let's go on to
[39:35] Perfection because we're not supposed to
[39:37] just stay in one
[39:38] place we're supposed to move on the
[39:42] Bible calls it growing in Grace and
[39:45] knowledge okay now this prophet's
[39:50] message never changed
[39:53] anything that had been brought by the
[39:55] apostles and Prophets because they
[39:58] brought the pure unadulterated word
[40:01] right all right but what he had to do
[40:04] was was to tell you and
[40:06] I that what it
[40:09] said right so as I said you know we've
[40:13] been told to stay out of the Book of
[40:15] Revelations because we can't understand
[40:18] it you know all right that was a
[40:21] faithful saying back in organized
[40:23] religion you can't understand this you
[40:25] can't understand that well now since the
[40:29] prophet came to bring us the message to
[40:33] tell us the
[40:35] symbols to tell them the tell us the
[40:37] things that was
[40:40] said why can't we understand
[40:43] right you know the one thing we need to
[40:45] understand
[40:46] with we need to baptism of the Holy
[40:50] Ghost but no man can call Jesus the
[40:53] Christ that's right except it be by the
[40:55] Holy Ghost right all right so that's
[40:59] what we need see we try to interpret it
[41:03] without the spirit of God right and we
[41:05] got man's ideas right oh man you're
[41:10] talking about getting into it you find a
[41:12] good
[41:13] Baptist that's where I came from I'm not
[41:15] thring off nobody but basic Baptist
[41:19] Doctrine is one
[41:21] God but now you ask him what he
[41:25] believes he'll tell you
[41:28] basic Baptist Doctrine is one
[41:31] God you say okay now explain
[41:35] that cuz that's what I done
[41:37] [Music]
[41:38] see they say God in three
[41:41] persons Blessed
[41:43] Trinity coequal and
[41:46] coeternal that was our explanation of
[41:50] the word of God the Bible never said
[41:53] that it never did talk about that that
[41:57] was what we interpreted and took our
[41:59] gles to read with to get our
[42:04] understanding but it never taught that
[42:07] right well I can read it to you right
[42:09] here he said but that wasn't what the
[42:11] Bible was
[42:13] saying the great Apostle
[42:16] Paul never in no way ever taught a
[42:19] Trinity right cuz the word wouldn't even
[42:21] there and the doctrines wasn't even back
[42:24] there in the church at the time of Paul
[42:26] I the Trinity you come along at 3:25 ad
[42:30] right but Paul said the God and father
[42:35] of our Lord Jesus
[42:38] Christ 1 2 3 4
[42:43] 5 now he he didn't say what we thought
[42:47] he said right he was talking about the
[42:50] same
[42:51] person we're going to get to it in a
[42:53] minute if I don't get there I'll ask you
[42:55] to read uh
[42:58] Revelations U verse 4 not read it now if
[43:02] we get there we will verse 4-7 and look
[43:05] how many ands and and and and and and
[43:09] and and and there only one person right
[43:13] right and we believe in many man
[43:16] manifestations of
[43:18] God there is where the Prophet brought
[43:20] to us to understanding
[43:22] amen we believe in the father Son and
[43:25] the Holy Ghost but not as three Gods
[43:26] right
[43:28] not as God in three
[43:30] persons but is God made
[43:34] manifest in many forms I just got do
[43:38] with a series on the uh seven compound
[43:41] names of
[43:43] Jehovah he was Jehovah Gyra Jehovah
[43:46] dis Jehovah
[43:49] Shar the
[43:51] seven was all one
[43:54] God
[43:55] now he's no greater to be Jehovah Gyra
[43:59] than he is to be Jehovah
[44:01] RFI we make him greater in one way or
[44:04] the other it's not true God is the
[44:07] same see then that way we see the one
[44:09] true and living
[44:11] God and that's the Revelation for this
[44:15] day is God to be
[44:19] revealed that's why God had to send a
[44:23] prophet that's right now what I want to
[44:27] talk about this afternoon is what I was
[44:30] mentioning this morning the title of the
[44:32] message is words of this prophecy
[44:35] because that's what John
[44:39] says this whole Bible is a
[44:43] prophecy right now there's a lot in this
[44:46] Bible that is not
[44:48] necessarily just verbatimly say
[44:52] prophecy there's a lot in this Bible
[44:54] That's
[44:55] History right history
[44:58] book A lot of it in here doesn't need
[45:02] interpreting because it says it right
[45:06] now brother random didn't have to come
[45:07] and tell us that the seven golden
[45:12] candlesticks you know and the Seven
[45:15] Stars he didn't have to tell us what
[45:17] that was that's right it says it in the
[45:21] Bible so there are
[45:23] things if you go back in the Old
[45:25] Testament you'll find this written
[45:27] there are things in the Bible that was
[45:31] sealed and there are things that was not
[45:33] sealed right you remember
[45:36] that and they put it in an Earthly
[45:39] vessel some was sealed some wouldn't
[45:41] seal why because some didn't have to be
[45:44] sealed
[45:45] right now but those things that are
[45:49] sealed the scripture says the secret
[45:51] things belong unto God right but those
[45:55] things that he reveal
[45:58] belong unto his
[46:00] children all right so that's what I want
[46:03] is what I want watch mine that's right
[46:06] I'm kind of a selfish person in one
[46:08] thing if you got a banana pudding don't
[46:11] set it down if you don't want a hole in
[46:14] it cuz I want mine I love banana
[46:20] pudding but now what I want to talk
[46:23] about a little
[46:24] bit and forgive me brother Samuel you
[46:28] interpret this to your
[46:30] people especially to where they won't
[46:32] misunderstand not necessarily now but
[46:35] when you later well they won't
[46:36] misunderstand my language cuz I only
[46:39] have a seventh grade education or ninth
[46:41] grade and it's not worth anything anyway
[46:45] but I want to talk about how that
[46:49] God
[46:51] limited
[46:52] himself that's
[46:55] right now
[46:57] the word limit comes from a thing of
[47:00] saying like
[47:03] a you confine it within a limit you can
[47:07] find it within a
[47:10] area all right so now God for you and I
[47:14] to be able to understand
[47:17] him when Christ The Mystery of God
[47:19] revealed read around and said how could
[47:21] the god that covered all space and time
[47:26] and
[47:27] eternity be
[47:30] comprehended by
[47:34] mankind but you know
[47:36] what he's done it am he's revealed
[47:40] himself right it's took him 6,000
[47:45] years to bring it to the basis that you
[47:48] and I can understand about God right a
[47:54] life being that he would send a prophet
[47:57] to make sure we didn't get it messed
[48:00] uph
[48:02] now the Old Testament was so
[48:06] important you know we used to say well
[48:08] it's not important there all we need is
[48:10] the New Testament you the Old Testament
[48:12] was so important until God came
[48:16] himself to back up what those prophets
[48:19] said brother randam own the message
[48:22] called
[48:23] Masterpiece he talks about Abraham Isaac
[48:25] Jacob Joseph building a foundation and
[48:28] he said then the prophets built the
[48:31] body well you take one of those little
[48:33] guys like non and you say ah non just a
[48:36] minor
[48:39] Prophet you take him out of the Bible
[48:42] Jesus's body is not complete am right
[48:46] but see you take any of us out and the
[48:49] body of Christ is not complete okay now
[48:52] that's what I'm getting at see not just
[48:54] back there but they buil the body John
[48:58] the Baptist being the last one to
[49:02] come to introduce Jesus Christ to the
[49:07] world so it shouldn't be very odd to
[49:09] realize and
[49:11] see that Elijah was to come in this
[49:15] day and introduce amen Jesus Christ the
[49:20] word
[49:22] amen to you and I am right right so it's
[49:26] not something that we're playing around
[49:28] with something that we don't
[49:31] understand no it's been
[49:35] Vindicated brought to reality all right
[49:38] now that's what I'm talking about is
[49:41] revealing that
[49:43] God to you and
[49:46] I now in doing it then look what it says
[49:51] in Revelations 1:1 there the revelation
[49:57] what of Jesus
[50:00] Christ now this Revelation is about
[50:03] Jesus Christ right all right now just
[50:07] read the Bible in plain language read it
[50:09] read it just like you're looking at it
[50:11] and like it's talking to you like I've
[50:14] always tried to illustrate to
[50:17] people you know that the theologians has
[50:20] read the
[50:23] Bible but they couldn't figure out the
[50:25] serpent seed for nothing in the world
[50:28] right even though it says in the
[50:32] garden that there was just Adam and
[50:37] Eve and here comes two
[50:41] children one of them's a real good the
[50:44] other one just like his
[50:46] daddy see science can't find that
[50:48] missing Le Darwin couldn't never find it
[50:52] you kids in school you know what I'm
[50:53] talk about the theory of Darwin how
[50:55] we're all linked and real you know but
[50:58] they can't get across from the monkey to
[51:00] the man right but if they read the Bible
[51:04] right they would find the Beast
[51:07] right but now here's my
[51:10] point we done it as well as the
[51:13] theologians done it we read the
[51:16] book but we didn't read what it said we
[51:20] read what we thought it said
[51:22] right but you can go take a newspaper
[51:28] you take a newspaper
[51:30] article you go home this evening you
[51:32] pick up your
[51:33] newspaper and right on the front
[51:37] page of the
[51:39] newspaper it says it was one man and one
[51:42] woman on an
[51:45] island
[51:48] right and there was a beast
[51:52] there and all at once something happens
[51:56] and you get a messed up generation of
[51:59] people well you know there's hardly
[52:03] anybody that wouldn't read that and say
[52:06] o we know what happened oh
[52:10] my that woman had something to do with
[52:12] that
[52:14] Beast just because we'd read
[52:17] it and they laugh at us and say we're
[52:20] not spiritual for believing what this
[52:23] said
[52:24] right this tells the truth
[52:27] truth tell where we come from where
[52:29] we're going that's why the devil don't
[52:31] want you to read the book of
[52:35] Revelation because the Book of
[52:36] Revelation shows his beginning and it
[52:39] shows his
[52:41] ending so you don't want you know us to
[52:43] know
[52:44] that your old boy be better off if he'd
[52:47] take a couple of thousand years vacation
[52:49] and leave us
[52:51] alone amen but instead of that he keeps
[52:54] pounding on us right you know what he
[52:56] does he makes a Christian dig deeper
[53:00] right don't you want to know what's
[53:02] going
[53:06] on but you see he said to
[53:11] revelation of Jesus
[53:15] Christ Now read it there with
[53:19] me the revelation of Jesus
[53:23] Christ which God gave unto him
[53:28] him now who did God give the Revelation
[53:31] to Jus Jesus Christ what was the
[53:33] Revelation
[53:36] about it was about Jesus Christ
[53:39] right that's what it
[53:42] says this wasn't a revelation now watch
[53:45] me and don't misunderstand me this
[53:48] wasn't a revelation of God
[53:51] no it was revelation of Jesus Christ
[53:54] right but this Revelation going to prove
[53:57] that he was God Amen not the oness now
[54:00] this real TR the revelation of Jesus
[54:05] Christ which God gave unto
[54:08] him as we were talking about this
[54:12] morning
[54:16] Jesus he didn't know all
[54:19] things now make sure brother Samuel you
[54:22] interpret that one cuz people can
[54:24] misunderstand that one real good
[54:27] Jesus didn't know when he's coming right
[54:30] right amen he didn't know when he's
[54:34] coming right right but he said he didn't
[54:38] right he said I do
[54:40] nothing until the father shows
[54:45] me everybody
[54:47] understand why was
[54:50] it that Jesus we believe to be God
[54:58] but why was it he didn't know all
[55:03] things good question is
[55:07] it we'll read it after a while but the
[55:11] prophet of God he
[55:13] said you got the Holy Ghost in
[55:17] you say but you don't know
[55:23] everything why is it you don't know
[55:25] everything
[55:31] very simple questions I love questions I
[55:34] I love for people to think you know a
[55:37] lot of preachers and that's fine they
[55:38] like you get all geared up with them and
[55:40] get to shout and Glory Hallelujah but
[55:42] I've sitting a many a congregation and
[55:44] heard people hollering amen amen and I
[55:46] sitting there no that ain't right that
[55:48] ain't right that ain't
[55:51] right my amen was H me
[55:56] because it wasn't right you get so built
[55:59] up until you just amen amen amen and
[56:01] that's all right now forgive me now if I
[56:05] offend
[56:08] you but I like for you to think about
[56:10] what I say right I never read in the
[56:14] bible where jesus shouted all over the
[56:17] place now come
[56:20] on you show it to
[56:23] me show me where Paul never got up
[56:25] shouted all all over the place now he
[56:27] preached all night long he preached so
[56:30] long till the boy fell out of the window
[56:31] and got
[56:32] killed but you know what he must have
[56:34] had some pretty good Goods cuz he went
[56:35] down and raised him up that's
[56:40] right I get my time to shouting when I'm
[56:43] out in the woods by
[56:46] myself and I'm listening to the prophet
[56:48] on my little MP3 player thing in my
[56:51] pocket you know
[56:54] iPod but see I I like to think about
[56:58] things I like for you to think about
[57:02] it so what is that guy
[57:07] saying then I tell you what I'm saying
[57:09] and then you can make up your mind
[57:11] whether you believe it or not
[57:13] okay but now you know Jesus there the
[57:17] greatest anointing he said brother so I
[57:20] no no come
[57:21] on but the Bible says in that Jesus the
[57:25] prophet says it
[57:26] was the
[57:28] anointed and yet he simply read a scroll
[57:30] turned around and sat
[57:32] down and said this day this scripture
[57:38] fulfilled now I remember when I first
[57:40] saw that I
[57:45] shouted because I
[57:47] saw that he saw something about himself
[57:51] right he said well how could he be
[57:54] God I don't understand y'all
[57:57] folks we had the Trinity all figured
[58:02] out the father was up in heaven and the
[58:05] Holy Ghost was running up and down and
[58:07] keeping us doing this that and the other
[58:09] and the sun was within
[58:11] us so we had all this and we had forgive
[58:15] me
[58:16] secretaries some of them called them
[58:18] priests and nuns and and some of them
[58:21] called them
[58:23] preachers and he wanted something to try
[58:25] to explain to them what is going on well
[58:28] oh that's
[58:32] wonderful but what do God say
[58:36] right now there was a
[58:39] revelation that had to be
[58:43] given and it was a revelation of Jesus
[58:49] Christ and it was something Jesus didn't
[58:52] understand right
[58:58] I'll be glad to give you this is in the
[58:59] church AG
[59:01] book it's about page
[59:06] 12 that Jesus didn't understand his part
[59:08] in the kingdom when he was here you know
[59:11] they ask him will you restore to you
[59:14] know to the kingdom to Israel he said
[59:15] you don't
[59:18] understand you know what he didn't
[59:21] understand we'll get back to that in a
[59:23] minute but I want to prove the point to
[59:25] you make sure you understand
[59:29] so he didn't
[59:33] understand but the prophet of God said
[59:35] when he come here to
[59:40] patmas read it the church when he come
[59:43] to
[59:45] patmas then he
[59:49] understood that that he didn't
[59:51] understand when he was here on
[59:53] Earth and then he could tell the the
[59:56] even the
[59:57] future church and what it would be doing
[1:00:00] and what would take
[1:00:01] place okay
[1:00:04] am but how is it that he could be God
[1:00:08] and not know all
[1:00:09] things that's our
[1:00:11] problem we try to figure that out with
[1:00:14] our
[1:00:15] brain
[1:00:18] right you can't do
[1:00:21] it that's one of the things you got to
[1:00:23] believe
[1:00:27] well I just can't believe that Jesus
[1:00:28] didn't know everything well he said he
[1:00:30] didn't your Prophet said he didn't so
[1:00:32] now you're going to argue with him I
[1:00:35] going to argue with
[1:00:39] you so what
[1:00:42] happened now as I said this morning in
[1:00:44] ending the
[1:00:46] message the Christ of the Old
[1:00:51] Testament he knew all things right
[1:00:56] right right cuz that was almighty God
[1:01:00] Amen he knew all
[1:01:03] things he was not limited in any way
[1:01:06] right that's right because he was
[1:01:08] almighty
[1:01:11] God but because of the fall of
[1:01:16] Man now I told you I don't have no
[1:01:19] education so just forgive
[1:01:21] me but just
[1:01:24] think some way God God made a way cuz we
[1:01:27] couldn't do
[1:01:28] it some way he made a
[1:01:32] way that when he would come into
[1:01:37] flesh that he would limit himself right
[1:01:40] to where he wouldn't know all time
[1:01:44] right
[1:01:46] now to try to express that in a
[1:01:50] way you know the story of the called the
[1:01:53] bumper blood
[1:01:56] how that when man sinned in the
[1:02:00] garden that God took the
[1:02:04] animals he killed those animals he made
[1:02:08] skins and he put them on Adam and Eve
[1:02:11] right and he made then what would be
[1:02:14] known as a bumper
[1:02:16] blood to cover the whole
[1:02:19] world that's why your Prophet would say
[1:02:22] then it being read he said you look
[1:02:25] through red at Red you'll see
[1:02:29] white so that way in the Old Testament
[1:02:32] he wouldn't destroy
[1:02:35] mankind yet they would sin like
[1:02:37] everything right 10 times the Bible said
[1:02:40] the children of Israel sinned against
[1:02:42] God from the time they left Egypt till
[1:02:45] they got to cadis barnia 10 times sure
[1:02:49] he whpt them J he punished
[1:02:53] them but they were still going to the
[1:02:55] promised land
[1:02:58] but when they would not believe Joshua
[1:03:01] and Caleb's report that they could take
[1:03:04] that
[1:03:05] land God could not Overlook that because
[1:03:08] that was
[1:03:10] unbelief by their unbelief they were
[1:03:12] turned back to the
[1:03:14] Wilderness until all that was 20 years
[1:03:16] of age and over died in the
[1:03:21] wilderness because of their
[1:03:24] unbelief heaven have we don't want to
[1:03:26] disbelieve
[1:03:29] God see there was no
[1:03:31] limit he was there he could do the great
[1:03:34] things he could park the water in front
[1:03:36] of the children of
[1:03:38] Israel he could rain Quail down out of
[1:03:40] the sky to feed
[1:03:42] them he could be as we were talking
[1:03:44] about
[1:03:45] Jehovah Gyra the Lord's provided
[1:03:47] sacrifice to Jehovah RFA like the Healer
[1:03:50] brother R said one day he said Moses had
[1:03:54] two and a half million people
[1:03:59] not one doctor in the whole
[1:04:01] crowd you need
[1:04:05] one so you want to look into
[1:04:07] Moses Dr saxel you know what I mean the
[1:04:10] little black bag the doct carish do you
[1:04:12] want to look in his satel say I am the
[1:04:16] Lord that Health all of thy
[1:04:19] diseases there no limit to God
[1:04:23] there but the bumper blood protected the
[1:04:26] people
[1:04:28] amen thank God that buffer of blood is
[1:04:30] still here amen but it changed at
[1:04:36] Calvary go to became the blood of Jesus
[1:04:40] Christ but you see God
[1:04:45] knew he couldn't send a
[1:04:48] son he couldn't send a prophet
[1:04:51] right he couldn't send somebody else
[1:04:54] right to die for sins he wouldn't be
[1:04:57] just would you send one of your children
[1:05:00] as the prophet would say to die when
[1:05:04] you're the one supposed to
[1:05:06] die so what did he do he came
[1:05:11] himself the great Eternal
[1:05:14] God that covered all Space and Time and
[1:05:18] Eternity came
[1:05:21] down the prophet said it like this
[1:05:24] bottled himself up
[1:05:28] into the wound of a a Virgin
[1:05:32] Mary to bring a
[1:05:34] body he said there was little
[1:05:38] Jehovah crying in the
[1:05:40] Cradle my Bible says Emmanuel which is
[1:05:43] God With
[1:05:45] Us right with another God another
[1:05:51] person he didn't he wasn't one person
[1:05:53] that sent another one
[1:05:56] now here's the words of the prophet he
[1:05:58] said I don't believe in no second person
[1:06:00] no third person second person he said
[1:06:02] matter of fact don't even believe in the
[1:06:03] first person that's right cuz he said he
[1:06:06] was the person because there a first
[1:06:12] person then that means they could be
[1:06:14] another person he didn't believe him I
[1:06:17] don't believe
[1:06:18] him I believe God condescended to
[1:06:21] humanity
[1:06:23] amen he come down into that human
[1:06:26] body and when that little body was
[1:06:29] delivered from the the Virgin
[1:06:33] Mary the Soul and Spirit of almighty God
[1:06:37] came into that body right huh what
[1:06:41] happens to you when you're born
[1:06:43] amen mama and daddy supplies the body
[1:06:50] right God gave you a soul and a
[1:06:54] spirit the make you a human being make
[1:06:56] you a
[1:06:58] person so Jesus come the same
[1:07:02] way now have them if you'd like
[1:07:05] them I've read it to you so many times
[1:07:08] but brother brand said in body he was a
[1:07:13] man but said in Soul he was God
[1:07:18] Amen and he said in body he was a
[1:07:22] man but said in spirit he was God right
[1:07:27] so what was the Virgin birth it brought
[1:07:29] the body
[1:07:30] right It produced Hebrews 10:5 a body
[1:07:34] thou Hast prepared me right
[1:07:38] amen we see once he stepped into that
[1:07:44] body D is where the limitation
[1:07:49] came because in that body he would be
[1:07:53] limited right amen
[1:07:56] now you've heard it over and over from
[1:07:57] the prophet so it's good
[1:08:00] enough when he was dwelling in that body
[1:08:02] he couldn't be all over the world at one
[1:08:04] time
[1:08:06] right right is that true he can only be
[1:08:10] in one
[1:08:11] body but he said Greater Works can you
[1:08:14] do now not greater like we can do
[1:08:15] something different than what he done
[1:08:17] but what does it mean the original says
[1:08:18] more Works can we do then he done that's
[1:08:21] what Jesus
[1:08:22] said why because around the world now
[1:08:26] you have the body of Christ God can be
[1:08:29] all over the world today living in
[1:08:32] individual people whereas then he was in
[1:08:35] one body right am well C you understand
[1:08:39] in the
[1:08:42] godhead
[1:08:44] right the Bible says that in him dwelt
[1:08:47] the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:08:53] right right so then it's simple to say
[1:08:56] God just condescended dropped right down
[1:08:58] come right out of that virgin created a
[1:09:00] body stepped right out when he did he
[1:09:01] stepped right in Soul and Spirit and
[1:09:03] there was almighty
[1:09:04] God now there's some doctrines in the
[1:09:07] land
[1:09:08] today that some of you probably had
[1:09:10] heard of but there's great Doctrine in
[1:09:11] the land among the people of the message
[1:09:14] that says that Jesus wasn't god Till The
[1:09:17] River
[1:09:19] Jordan the anointing came on him and
[1:09:21] made him
[1:09:23] God well according to my Bible Bible
[1:09:25] said unto you this day in the city of
[1:09:27] David is a savior which is Christ the
[1:09:29] lord right his name Shall be Called
[1:09:32] Emmanuel which is God With Us your
[1:09:35] Prophet said little Jehovah crying in
[1:09:36] the Cradle little Jehovah playing as a
[1:09:38] boy little Jehovah coming out the
[1:09:41] adoption time he come to those things
[1:09:43] that was little
[1:09:45] Jehovah
[1:09:47] now but you see if you just had
[1:09:51] Jesus being a man and then God steps in
[1:09:55] him and then he steps back out of him
[1:09:58] because you got to admit something
[1:09:59] happen right see then where did Jesus
[1:10:04] go now according to my Bible that's why
[1:10:07] I love to read the Bible I believe this
[1:10:10] Prophet turned us back to the Bible he
[1:10:12] didn't turn us away from the Bible he
[1:10:13] turned us back to the
[1:10:15] Bible all
[1:10:17] right then according to my Bible are on
[1:10:22] Calvary he yielded up the ghost that's
[1:10:25] right
[1:10:26] right into thy hands I commend my spirit
[1:10:29] right yet the prophet of God will make
[1:10:32] outstanding statements which are true he
[1:10:34] said the anointing left Jesus in the
[1:10:36] garden said because he couldn't
[1:10:39] die like
[1:10:42] that you say God can't
[1:10:47] die you're okay if you're dealing with
[1:10:50] Spirit realm
[1:10:52] right when that God was in that human
[1:10:54] flesh
[1:10:57] that's why he was never called a Son of
[1:10:59] God show me he was always called son of
[1:11:03] man that's right who a man say I the son
[1:11:05] of man am why cuz it was a son of man
[1:11:07] that died right son of man was word made
[1:11:12] flesh Son of God was the spirit right
[1:11:15] that's why down to the church ages you
[1:11:16] don't deal with son of
[1:11:18] man Paul never even taught the son of
[1:11:21] man none of the disciples in their
[1:11:23] writings Peter didn't WR of the son of
[1:11:25] man cuz he didn't understand even though
[1:11:28] Jesus stood right there to Peter and
[1:11:30] said who the man say I the son of man am
[1:11:34] right he
[1:11:36] said th art the Christ right the son of
[1:11:39] the Living God right what did Jesus say
[1:11:43] Flesh and Blood didn't reveal that unto
[1:11:45] thee but my Father revealed it and on
[1:11:47] that rock I'll build my church other
[1:11:49] words you don't know what I ask I ask
[1:11:52] you about the son of man you refer to me
[1:11:54] as the son of God that's who I
[1:11:56] am but someday I'll come back in the end
[1:11:59] time as son of man that's right in the
[1:12:03] Bride of Jesus Christ amen cuz brother
[1:12:06] Brandon wasn't the son of man that's
[1:12:08] right brother Brandon was a son of man
[1:12:10] that's
[1:12:11] right come on I'm quoting brother random
[1:12:13] out of the church age book brother
[1:12:16] randam wasn't the son of man the son of
[1:12:19] man is the Lord Jesus
[1:12:20] Christ but he had the ministry of the
[1:12:22] son of man that's how close it was but
[1:12:26] you make him de son of man you make him
[1:12:29] Dey then you got a
[1:12:31] problem but see limited himself by
[1:12:34] coming into
[1:12:36] flesh cuz I asked a question a moment
[1:12:38] ago you have the new birth you have the
[1:12:41] baptism of the Holy Ghost if you have
[1:12:43] the new birth you got to have the
[1:12:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost right you have
[1:12:46] the life of God living in you right I
[1:12:49] come you don't know
[1:12:53] everything why is it you don't know
[1:12:56] everything because you got a body and a
[1:12:59] spirit that in a worldly Earthly realm
[1:13:04] right and we're controlled by that
[1:13:06] whether you like it or not right there's
[1:13:10] not too many of us real
[1:13:12] skinny maybe a
[1:13:14] few but most of us are pretty fat so you
[1:13:18] know what's happening the world is
[1:13:21] controlling
[1:13:23] me come on
[1:13:26] right flesh controls us we must live in
[1:13:30] this realm and to do that there must be
[1:13:33] a spirit within us to motivate us and
[1:13:36] you're not born again in your
[1:13:38] spirit you're not born again in your
[1:13:41] body you can only be born again in your
[1:13:45] soul that's why the body has to be
[1:13:51] changed not get a new one now don't
[1:13:54] believe in that amen believe is his body
[1:13:57] redeemed that's right I know how say it
[1:14:00] one thing when Jesus raised he had nail
[1:14:02] prints in his so it must have been the
[1:14:04] same body it raised back up he still had
[1:14:07] the nail prints that's right but now
[1:14:11] listen but while he was here in this
[1:14:13] world he had to
[1:14:15] eat sure I know he could go 40 days and
[1:14:18] you and I can't do it don't try
[1:14:23] it now remember where was that for one
[1:14:25] thing but you can't
[1:14:28] go you can go without food for a long
[1:14:33] time but you can't go without
[1:14:36] water you got to have water in about 3
[1:14:39] or 4
[1:14:40] days that's in this
[1:14:43] climate we were in Israel walking the
[1:14:46] deserts and you know what they told us
[1:14:48] keep a bottle of water in your hand and
[1:14:49] drinking at all times because I remember
[1:14:52] sometime they said you have to consume
[1:14:54] in that environment you must consume
[1:14:56] between two and three gallons of water a
[1:14:59] day to keep you from dehydrating right
[1:15:02] and remember he was out in the desert
[1:15:03] without water or food so you can't do
[1:15:06] that that's proved who that was nobody I
[1:15:09] don't care you say brother so and so
[1:15:11] fasted so many days did he drank
[1:15:15] water then you find out they put a
[1:15:17] little Coke in their
[1:15:19] liquid and then you find out he was
[1:15:21] sneaking down to McDonald's every once
[1:15:23] in a while getting a hamburger while
[1:15:25] nobody wouldn't watch
[1:15:26] him he buys him some pants about four
[1:15:29] sizes too
[1:15:30] big and he walks around and everybody
[1:15:33] look at him fasting oh that's a
[1:15:36] hypocrite that's just the best way to
[1:15:37] say it that's what it is that's what
[1:15:40] Jesus called
[1:15:41] him but now get my point my being in
[1:15:45] human
[1:15:46] flesh does everybody understand me being
[1:15:49] in human flesh
[1:15:52] limited because Satan could talk to
[1:15:56] Jesus you
[1:15:58] agree he did in the
[1:16:01] Temptation take these Stones make them
[1:16:03] bread take this to that take this to
[1:16:05] that he talked to
[1:16:07] him and your Prophet said that Jesus
[1:16:10] could even be
[1:16:11] tempted the Bible said in all points as
[1:16:15] we are your Prophet said he could be
[1:16:17] tempted by
[1:16:19] women you might not like that statement
[1:16:21] but it's true what he said now he didn't
[1:16:23] go out with his tongue Led Out l y night
[1:16:25] for everybody went
[1:16:26] by
[1:16:28] no there's nothing wrong with being
[1:16:30] tempted is when you yield yourself to
[1:16:33] the Temptation there is where you messed
[1:16:36] up when you entertain the thought you
[1:16:38] can't help the thought coming Satan
[1:16:40] could talk to
[1:16:43] Jesus tried to make deals with
[1:16:46] him you know what he even said to him
[1:16:48] ever thought
[1:16:49] about he said you do all these things
[1:16:51] I'll give you these kingdoms
[1:16:55] well you know what Jesus knew he was
[1:16:57] going to have to die to get him that's
[1:16:58] right right he knew he'd have to die to
[1:17:01] get him wouldn't it been easy say hey
[1:17:04] hand him over
[1:17:05] buddy I'm just on your side a little bit
[1:17:07] no he wouldn't on his side none
[1:17:11] whatsoever he said I'll go pay the
[1:17:14] price and he
[1:17:16] did but you understand how that God is
[1:17:19] the only one that could
[1:17:23] limit now how it how is that God can't
[1:17:25] see your
[1:17:29] sins now don't tell me he don't know you
[1:17:31] s don't sin I mean sin don't tell me
[1:17:33] that now I didn't say
[1:17:35] that he knows what you're
[1:17:40] doing but you know brother Rand made a
[1:17:42] statement one time was outstanding to me
[1:17:45] somebody said something to him about in
[1:17:46] the prayer
[1:17:47] line you know at times brother Brown
[1:17:50] especially his early Ministry he called
[1:17:51] it out he said you're living with this
[1:17:52] man's wife you're doing this you're
[1:17:54] doing wrong he said God told him not to
[1:17:56] use it that way he stopped doing it
[1:17:58] unless it was really just God bearing
[1:18:01] down on him cuz he said you cause
[1:18:03] marriage and divorces you cause lawsuits
[1:18:05] killings and everything
[1:18:07] else but you know what he said one
[1:18:10] day somebody asked him something he said
[1:18:12] listen if that person has repented of
[1:18:15] that
[1:18:16] sin I can't bring it
[1:18:20] up now there's God not in that man or
[1:18:23] brother around now
[1:18:25] amen when
[1:18:27] God covers your sin the scripture say
[1:18:30] it's in the seal
[1:18:32] forgetfulness as far as East and West
[1:18:34] now you go north and south going to
[1:18:35] reach a pole you go east and west you
[1:18:37] just come back back around start back
[1:18:38] over you just that's why it says east
[1:18:40] and
[1:18:41] west cuz you can't find no stopping part
[1:18:46] right and like the man said you know he
[1:18:49] found out his sins was in the depth of
[1:18:50] the sea he said I read the other day
[1:18:53] where they
[1:18:54] can't even find the bottom in some of
[1:18:56] the places is that means my sins is
[1:18:58] still
[1:18:59] going but you
[1:19:01] understand God limits
[1:19:05] himself to keep from having destroy me
[1:19:07] and you that's right oh don't think
[1:19:10] you're so good now don't ever get the
[1:19:14] idea that you're so goody goody that God
[1:19:17] don't he loves you so much you can do
[1:19:19] anything you want to
[1:19:22] do you better be careful how you walk
[1:19:27] because God can pull a limit off anytime
[1:19:30] he wants
[1:19:32] to he can cover us but he can pull it
[1:19:35] off too right but you understand God
[1:19:38] limited
[1:19:41] himself I remember one time I preached a
[1:19:43] little message on you ever thought about
[1:19:46] a god having
[1:19:48] Amnesia you better interpret that to the
[1:19:50] brother I hope he catches that no it
[1:19:53] don't bother me for you to tell him what
[1:19:54] I'm saying you know what amnesia is
[1:19:58] Right Amnesia means your mind's blocked
[1:20:01] out you don't
[1:20:04] remember well I go do something wrong
[1:20:07] and I go before God and I say God
[1:20:09] forgive me he said I don't remember
[1:20:12] it the devil says he done it the whole
[1:20:17] congregation says he done it amen God
[1:20:20] said I didn't see it now if you think
[1:20:23] that ain't right you go over o
[1:20:25] baam you remember bam and B you remember
[1:20:29] bam o ba paid him to curse Israel they
[1:20:32] were time he' go down and try to curse
[1:20:33] Israel he couldn't curse them he blessed
[1:20:37] them he said hey come around here to let
[1:20:41] me show you the worst things it's called
[1:20:42] hinder Parts in the Bible you know what
[1:20:46] that means it's it doesn't mean this
[1:20:47] back it means the worst thing you can do
[1:20:50] you know we said come around here let me
[1:20:53] show you all these bad things they doing
[1:20:55] he said I can't see anything he said
[1:20:58] because there's a sh of the king in the
[1:21:02] camp that's wonderful God isn't it you
[1:21:05] know one of these days I'm going to
[1:21:06] thank you and say God thank you for
[1:21:11] forgetting hey come on don't you think
[1:21:13] you're
[1:21:15] guilty guilty of the least guilty of the
[1:21:19] whole but just think about it now trying
[1:21:21] to get the point across
[1:21:26] when you get down to
[1:21:29] verse we won't get that far to say it
[1:21:31] but when you get down to verse 11 in
[1:21:35] Revelations
[1:21:38] 1
[1:21:41] verse 10 said I was in the spirit on the
[1:21:45] Lord's Day heard behind me a great voice
[1:21:48] as of a trumpet
[1:21:49] saying that's in red letter then because
[1:21:52] it would show Jesus right I'm Alpha and
[1:21:55] Omega the beginning end and all what you
[1:21:57] see here's what brother Bram said on the
[1:22:00] message patas Vision 1960 paragraph 143
[1:22:05] he said before we go any
[1:22:07] further and I say
[1:22:10] anymore I want you to know who I
[1:22:15] am now that's what he wanted John to
[1:22:18] know that John before I start revealing
[1:22:21] any other things I want you to know who
[1:22:23] I am
[1:22:26] what about a wonderful
[1:22:29] God a God that would want us to know who
[1:22:32] he
[1:22:33] is a God that would so love
[1:22:38] us that he wants us to
[1:22:41] know I'm not a theologian in all no way
[1:22:45] but I sure do like to read what some of
[1:22:46] them say about those big old words that
[1:22:49] we use
[1:22:51] sometime you know I mean we're we're
[1:22:53] people in especially in America we we
[1:22:56] know all about
[1:23:00] theophanes we used to we didn't know
[1:23:02] what the word theophany was right till
[1:23:06] the prophet came right and we knew all
[1:23:08] about Elohim self-existing Jehovah
[1:23:12] Jehovah je we can just keep going going
[1:23:15] why because we've been
[1:23:18] trained but you know all of that is
[1:23:20] revealing God
[1:23:24] right all of that can be said about that
[1:23:26] little fell running down they
[1:23:32] playing what about Jehovah God just
[1:23:37] playing what about him growing up and
[1:23:39] becoming a little boy you know children
[1:23:43] he is to each one of us what we are so
[1:23:46] no matter how young you are God is to
[1:23:50] you and he can understand you he
[1:23:53] understands what it is used to be a
[1:23:54] little
[1:23:56] boy now brother bradam
[1:23:58] said see people don't think brother Bram
[1:24:00] was human most of the time but he said
[1:24:03] one day he either read a book or
[1:24:05] something I forgot which way saw a movie
[1:24:07] or read a book about
[1:24:10] Tarson he went in the house and got his
[1:24:12] mother's rug he cut it up and he made
[1:24:15] him a suit and he started doing the
[1:24:18] Superman's and the thing and he started
[1:24:20] swinging through the trees he started
[1:24:24] cuz he was a
[1:24:27] boy I get so tickled at him when I hear
[1:24:29] him because see I'm 70 years old and I
[1:24:32] was raised in the country right most of
[1:24:35] you don't even know nothing about what
[1:24:36] he's talking about I don't mean that
[1:24:38] wrong I just mean you didn't come up
[1:24:40] like
[1:24:40] that you remember him telling about how
[1:24:43] that he had his cover his overalls
[1:24:45] pulled over and just had one
[1:24:49] strap and he had a nail sticking through
[1:24:51] it oh brother Thomas back there laughing
[1:24:53] CU see we used to come through some of
[1:24:56] that you know when that button got broke
[1:24:58] off you either tied a knot and tied it
[1:25:01] in your over halls or you just take you
[1:25:03] a nail and you just stick it through and
[1:25:05] you slide that nail in there
[1:25:09] right amen he said he got ready to go in
[1:25:13] swimming said he just started running
[1:25:15] toward the
[1:25:17] water and he just pulled a
[1:25:22] nail he said the clothes was left in
[1:25:25] midair and he was diving into the
[1:25:28] water well you don't know that
[1:25:31] see but I
[1:25:34] do you know cuz we was
[1:25:38] kids but now listen here's my point I'll
[1:25:41] quit
[1:25:42] on you know I believe Jesus was a little
[1:25:45] boy that's
[1:25:47] right you know if he'd been in the days
[1:25:50] when Taren was jumping out of the tree
[1:25:52] hard a you know swinging on vines you
[1:25:55] know what Jesus would have
[1:25:57] done he swung on
[1:26:00] Vines he was a
[1:26:03] boy am you don't ever think about that
[1:26:07] you don't ever think about how that he
[1:26:09] was a
[1:26:12] teenager amen you teenagers running I
[1:26:16] know what you think you think us grown
[1:26:18] up don't know a
[1:26:20] thing right I don't care where you're
[1:26:22] Hispanic or where you whatever y'all
[1:26:24] call yourself cuz I know you get in
[1:26:25] trouble saying that a lot of times
[1:26:27] because one groups wants you to call
[1:26:28] them Hispanics other wants to call you
[1:26:29] Mexican other wants you to call you this
[1:26:31] and I just don't know which one to call
[1:26:32] you okay so I just stay
[1:26:35] Hispanic I went to Brazil and come find
[1:26:37] out they was they were speaking
[1:26:40] Portuguese excuse me well I didn't
[1:26:42] understand a lot of it but you know what
[1:26:43] I understood most of it I told him I
[1:26:45] said want some
[1:26:47] AA they'll get mad at you for saying the
[1:26:50] Portuguese will for saying they are
[1:26:52] speaking Spanish but you know what they
[1:26:53] got me some more
[1:26:55] water but the thing of what I'm getting
[1:26:57] at
[1:26:58] listen I want you to see one thing just
[1:27:01] forget all the
[1:27:03] other Jesus lived as a human being
[1:27:07] right upon this
[1:27:09] Earth You know he had to take a
[1:27:13] bath you know he had to
[1:27:15] eat come
[1:27:19] on I mean his toenails need cutting too
[1:27:26] you see I'm just trying to make him down
[1:27:28] to where you can understand my whole
[1:27:29] point how that God limited himself by
[1:27:31] coming in living that
[1:27:36] way Amen brother BR said he sat on a
[1:27:39] rock grown with a headache taking it
[1:27:40] from uh what is it Prince of the House
[1:27:44] of
[1:27:45] David he said he sat on the Rock and
[1:27:47] grown with a headache after raising that
[1:27:48] little boy from the dead you know he was
[1:27:51] sick
[1:27:54] but Brother D say I was a Baptist okay
[1:27:56] one God that's what I told about ho
[1:27:58] ghost God in threee person Blessed
[1:27:59] Trinity but still one God I believe he
[1:28:02] was so much God when I was in the
[1:28:03] Baptist Church that he couldn't stomp
[1:28:05] his toe and hurt
[1:28:06] himself I don't mind telling you that's
[1:28:09] the way I believed it I believed he was
[1:28:13] God so he couldn't be
[1:28:17] hurt I believe my God couldn't get
[1:28:21] hurt I believe my God didn't die
[1:28:24] but then when I come in the message I
[1:28:26] found a lot of difference
[1:28:28] right you say what happened at
[1:28:31] Calvary brother randam unveiling of
[1:28:34] God get the message unveiling of God
[1:28:38] brother Randon said he only acted the
[1:28:39] part of
[1:28:40] death
[1:28:45] amen you know what happened to
[1:28:50] Calvary I could go back to brother
[1:28:52] collie of ill it many times I could cut
[1:28:55] his head to slap off of him you know I
[1:28:57] can't kill
[1:28:58] him you said no you just killed him no I
[1:29:03] can't CU God want me put the head back
[1:29:07] on
[1:29:09] right see God's the only one who can
[1:29:11] take our
[1:29:14] lives so what happens when you
[1:29:19] die what happens when you die your soul
[1:29:23] and your spirit leads out of the body
[1:29:27] agree everybody understand your soul
[1:29:30] your spirit goes out of the body the

[1:30:02] right the spirit was released and come
[1:30:05] back and come back pick the soul up the
[1:30:08] prophet said and step right back into
[1:30:10] that body and raised it right out of the
