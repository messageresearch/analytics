[0:00] hello hello God's time God's time God's
[0:05] time God's time whatever you got to say
[0:08] worthless right
[0:09] now Matthew
[0:12] 24 step on your first
[0:15] sorry oh with your foot that's why I was
[0:17] stomping
[0:20] on she's got on purple glasses got on
[0:23] purple real brother to
[0:28] fight
[0:31] you want to drink glasses
[0:33] accessoriz you got that on oh baby whoa
[0:38] okay all right I think those are
[0:40] opposite good morning
[0:43] everyone all right we're going to try to
[0:45] wrap up I know we we were supposed to
[0:47] look up sanctification and you should
[0:50] have thank
[0:52] you
[0:55] and but let's read we haven't been
[0:58] reading Matthew 24 let let's go to
[1:00] Matthew
[1:02] 24 and let's read and let's let's pick
[1:06] up first seal second
[1:08] seal body breaks are
[1:10] okay okay I was talking to
[1:17] her Matthew
[1:21] 24 take heed that no man shall deceive
[1:23] you look at verse 5 for many shall come
[1:25] in my name saying I am Christ and shall
[1:27] deceive
[1:28] many
[1:30] what was the first
[1:31] seal a white righteous Church went out
[1:34] everybody assumed that was God so many
[1:37] shall come in what in my name saying I'm
[1:40] Christ and that's what they
[1:42] did they become that the Antichrist
[1:45] Spirit they thought it was God people
[1:48] thought it was God that's why it was a
[1:49] white righteous church that's why it was
[1:51] so innocent that's why it went out in
[1:53] the power that it went out cuz they
[1:54] thought it was God but it wasn't
[1:56] right but there was a group that went
[1:59] out
[2:00] and they were
[2:02] Christ but they didn't deceive you see
[2:05] what I'm saying they didn't deceive all
[2:07] right now look at the verse six and ye
[2:11] shall hear of wars and rumors of wars
[2:13] now what happens in a
[2:16] war there's blood there's
[2:19] death right remember the symbol was take
[2:22] peace and kill so there's your parallel
[2:24] between the second seal and verse 6 and
[2:26] you shall hear of wars and rumors of
[2:29] wars see that you be not troubled for
[2:31] all these things must come to pass but
[2:34] the end is not yet now in my Justified
[2:38] condition just talking from my
[2:40] experience I didn't have a big
[2:43] battle I knew my sins were forgiven I I
[2:46] felt like God had had had had emptied
[2:49] that into the sea of God's forgivness
[2:52] but now the battle really began wars and
[2:55] rumors of war the battle really began
[2:57] for me at
[2:58] sanctification cuz that's that's when
[3:00] this guy has to start lining up right it
[3:04] should have been in your experience you
[3:06] should have had the worst problem in
[3:09] sanctification because that's when the
[3:11] unclean Spirit goes out walks in dry
[3:13] places seeketh rest and findeth none and
[3:16] if you don't fill it with something he's
[3:17] going to bring seven of his buddies back
[3:19] with him and you're just going to be a
[3:21] religious person then see there's your
[3:23] wars and rumors of wars you think well
[3:25] that's natural that's true remember
[3:27] there's a natural application to the
[3:28] seal then there's a spiritual
[3:31] application to the seal the spiritual
[3:32] application to the seal is right
[3:36] here Tim said the other day I'm
[3:39] saved battle right battle battle
[3:44] station you better get your gun because
[3:46] you know what brother Brown say Satan
[3:48] will train every gun on you why you're
[3:50] trying to do better right and you're
[3:54] you're coming under and sanctification
[3:56] brother Ram said and and brother Ryan
[3:58] covered it last night he give you new
[4:00] spirit but not his Spirit to give you a
[4:01] new spirit what a new spirit to say I
[4:04] want to come to church I want to study
[4:05] more I want to pray more I want to be
[4:07] around another group of people
[4:11] right what does Satan do he puts him
[4:14] same old buddies back in there he puts
[4:17] him same old thoughts back in there he
[4:19] brings the same old things back up what
[4:21] then there's your War right you wasn't
[4:23] Waring when you when you were not a
[4:25] Christian were you Waring I wasn't
[4:26] Waring all there was little things in my
[4:29] mind you need to go to church well that
[4:30] was God just kind of pecking you know
[4:33] sending a little signal right but when
[4:36] you know it didn't let's just take for
[4:38] example just plain language today I have
[4:42] no desire to go buy a pack of beer or p
[4:45] p of
[4:46] beer but when I was in the
[4:49] world it didn't matter I mean did it
[4:51] bother you no it didn't bother me I went
[4:54] and did it why the old nature was still
[4:57] there there was not the
[5:00] War but see when God came and said and I
[5:03] accepted that he had forgiv my
[5:05] sins and that I'm just as righteous as
[5:08] he is on my journey on my road baby form
[5:12] justification you got to realize even at
[5:13] baby form justification that you're
[5:15] starting going you're going
[5:17] somewhere you're going two places you're
[5:19] either going back or you're going
[5:21] forward one of the two can't stay
[5:23] neutral in any of these all right but at
[5:26] justification he chopped off my past
[5:28] sins we you know I felt empty but that
[5:32] desire to do certain things were still
[5:35] there why because that unclean Spirit
[5:37] had not been to grow out but then when
[5:40] God when I started coming to church and
[5:43] I started getting under the anointing of
[5:46] what was going
[5:47] on listening to the
[5:50] word that's when the conviction
[5:53] came when you went and grabbed that you
[5:57] know um cooler
[6:00] P it open and you just grab that beer
[6:02] and you put it in course I never did
[6:03] that but there was a lot of other things
[6:04] I did do but you grab that beer and just
[6:06] I see people at Walmart you know all
[6:09] walks of life they got beer and wine I
[6:12] mean to them it's nothing right to them
[6:14] it's just natural I'm going to have me a
[6:17] beer and maybe go to church on Sunday
[6:19] but I'm going to have me a beer and and
[6:21] and and then you know the guy puts the
[6:23] cart in of cigarette he's not going
[6:25] should I do this or should I not do this
[6:29] no it's just automatic just like me and
[6:31] you going to getting milk now you just
[6:34] put that guy on the milk why there that
[6:36] desire the old man is still there Satan
[6:39] is
[6:42] residing right but now in justification
[6:45] there starts a separation right all
[6:48] right this white righteous Church in the
[6:51] first
[6:52] seal what caus Satan to ride out was is
[6:55] because a righteous true church was
[6:57] there that had been driven that had
[7:00] driven him out in the upper room the 120
[7:03] upper rooms Satan was driven out of
[7:06] those 120 people right cuz they went
[7:08] through justification sanctification
[7:10] baptism of the Holy Ghost all at one
[7:11] time because they had been tutored the
[7:14] word that they
[7:16] hell come alive right all right that can
[7:19] happen to you
[7:21] today or it could take you a year in
[7:24] justification or a year in
[7:26] sanctification that doesn't matter as
[7:29] long as you see that you're progressing
[7:32] as long as you see that you're doing the
[7:33] things that you're supposed to do all
[7:36] right but still that's the greatest
[7:39] battle is sanctification because you
[7:41] know what God's going to do God's going
[7:42] to say you're still
[7:46] lost now you might be giv eternal life I
[7:49] don't like that might
[7:50] be I don't like might be when it comes
[7:53] to my life continuing on or or or being
[7:56] you know thrown out somewhere I want to
[7:59] know know that I know that I
[8:01] know but in sanctification though God's
[8:03] coming and saying hey keep going keep
[8:05] doing what you're doing you're doing
[8:07] fine everything you know and through the
[8:08] ministry I'm not talking about God just
[8:09] coming and speaking to you he speak to
[8:11] you through the minister speak to you
[8:12] through through reading the Bible
[8:14] reading the prophet's message like
[8:16] brother Ron said last night just that
[8:18] was that was preached to
[8:20] us whatever they did with it the people
[8:23] that were sitting in that congregation
[8:24] in the 60s and 50s and 40s whatever they
[8:26] did with it was their business they
[8:28] weren't the fin voice to the final age
[8:31] you and I have come up to this message
[8:33] and there's a period there's nothing
[8:34] past us that's going to come and help us
[8:38] out this is
[8:41] it so he was speaking to me and you so
[8:44] through that voice God was trying to get
[8:46] a bride ready get them Justified get
[8:49] them Sanctified get them filled with the
[8:51] Holy Ghost right right but there's a war
[8:54] in between there that's what brother R
[8:56] was talking about last night remember
[8:57] he's talking about the war there was a
[8:58] there's a war started why because it's
[9:01] opposing forces that's why this second
[9:03] seal says and you shall hear of wars and
[9:05] rumors of wars see that you be not
[9:07] trouble in other words don't be
[9:10] troubled Satan will come I promise
[9:16] you if you hadn't already look out he's
[9:18] coming that's right but he's going to
[9:21] make you religious though and put you in
[9:22] a message church and say oh everything's
[9:24] all
[9:26] right that's the worst deception that's
[9:30] right but you got to go on to that third
[9:32] step all right but we're still in the
[9:34] Second Step so let's not get to the
[9:35] third one so sanctification is to make
[9:38] holy set apart as sacred consecrate now
[9:42] that's what you've got to
[9:43] do got to start doing the right thing
[9:46] that's right cu the spirit he gives you
[9:48] brother Brown said it's the
[9:50] spirit where you can at least deal with
[9:54] your own self cuz cuz I I didn't get
[9:56] Sanctified because June did that's I
[9:59] didn't get Sanctified cuz my daddy did I
[10:01] got Sanctified cuz I did all right so
[10:04] it's an individual Affair it's us
[10:06] helping but it's an individual Affair
[10:08] you got to sit down and say God this is
[10:11] just me and
[10:12] you this is just me and you I I can't
[10:16] pour it
[10:18] in it's you and God all right sanctify
[10:22] consecrate to purify or free from sin
[10:24] sanctify your heart to impart religious
[10:26] sanction to render legitimate or B in to
[10:29] sanctify a vow to entitle to reverence
[10:32] or respect to make prod to make
[10:34] productive of pro productive of or
[10:37] conducive to spiritual blessings all
[10:42] right and you do you become
[10:45] productive in a Sanctified condition
[10:48] because what are you doing you come to
[10:49] church start paying your tithe start
[10:53] doing the right things that's right see
[10:55] but Satan's going to say oh well you got
[10:57] something else to do today or that's
[10:58] true
[10:59] watch it cuz remember
[11:04] justification is a hope you make it
[11:08] sanctification is a hope you make it the
[11:12] new birth you made it so you're still at
[11:14] the hope so so be
[11:17] careful but the best thing to do is is
[11:20] tell Satan say look whatever you going
[11:22] to do that's okay I know you're going to
[11:26] be there like we talking about uh coming
[11:29] to church you know brother Ron was
[11:30] saying we need and he did he said we
[11:32] need to be in church you need to be
[11:33] where you're supposed to be you need to
[11:34] be under the the the ospice of of God
[11:37] and the people of God and be around the
[11:39] people of God but Satan's here more than
[11:42] most people are he'll tell you it's okay
[11:44] to stay home and he'll come to
[11:48] church get like brother Ron start diing
[11:50] your hand like again get around him you
[11:53] get his
[11:53] Spirit you hear me are you with me are
[11:57] you with me are you with me
[11:59] Tyler did last but huh Tyler oh I'm sure
[12:03] he
[12:05] did but that's what he did you know
[12:07] Satan will tell you something to get you
[12:10] out of church and he's going to be here
[12:11] first thing he don't miss a service not
[12:14] one but see we start doing and and right
[12:17] there is really your dos and
[12:19] don'ts at justification you really don't
[12:21] stop cutting your hair or wearing makeup
[12:23] or pain or all that stuff it's
[12:25] sanctification when you really sit down
[12:27] and start reading it and that starts
[12:29] convicting your
[12:31] heart oh it's okay to do a little
[12:34] bit you know I see some of the sisters
[12:36] here in the church that hair don't ever
[12:39] grow except
[12:42] straight that's not that's not God
[12:45] people that's not
[12:47] God wearing a little bit of this a
[12:49] little bit of
[12:51] that when we going to know that at
[12:54] sanctification that's where that's
[12:55] supposed to go out not at the new birth
[12:58] sanctification that's when the unclean
[13:01] Spirit the Bible says Matthew 11 I
[13:02] believe it is the unclean Spirit goes
[13:04] out of a
[13:05] man right true that's when it goes
[13:10] out now sanctification and New Birth may
[13:12] be together and it goes out and you
[13:15] become a you know a born again Christian
[13:17] but if you're going to you're going to
[13:18] go through those three stages I don't
[13:20] care who you are whether you go through
[13:21] it the same
[13:23] morning evening or it takes you 60
[13:27] years but you're going to have wars and
[13:30] rumors of wars right and you even gonna
[13:33] have wars this war continues on to the
[13:35] end these wars don't stop but look right
[13:37] here it says right here and you shall
[13:41] hear wars and rumors of War see that you
[13:42] be not troubled for all these things
[13:46] what all these from five down through
[13:49] all the seals must happen and then the
[13:52] end is not yet so see at sanctification
[13:56] is not your end at the new birth is
[13:58] where you old dead you dies and ends
[14:02] right not in
[14:04] sanctification the old you still alive
[14:07] the old nature is still there but it's
[14:10] being driven
[14:11] out why you do what you're supposed to
[14:15] do all right same way here you listen to
[14:18] what the same doctrine that that that
[14:21] Satan's taking and he's deceiving his
[14:22] people with you take the truth of that
[14:25] Doctrine and it puts you in in the path
[14:27] toward a new birth right right all right
[14:30] so see all these things brother Ron and
[14:32] I were talking last night we were kind
[14:34] of going over some things but but that's
[14:38] why I want to make sure that we don't
[14:39] see all the bad cu the seals are for us
[14:43] they were for no other generation they
[14:45] were for no other time they were for no
[14:47] other bride except for the ones that
[14:49] sitting I'm looking at right
[14:51] now and the natural part of the seal we
[14:54] don't get cuz it's
[14:56] bad Antichrist
[14:59] false prophet all look at all this false
[15:01] anti false kill kill
[15:06] blood
[15:08] dark that's not we're children of light
[15:11] right we're children of live not killing
[15:14] you understand what I mean but if we
[15:15] don't get the spiritual application of
[15:17] this that we do have to die that's right
[15:19] we do have to listen and take the sword
[15:21] of the true word of God listen to a true
[15:24] Prophet give see all you got to do is
[15:27] cover up a few little words
[15:29] that you get Christ
[15:31] Spirit true
[15:33] Prophet put you in the bride all right
[15:37] but now we know and understand that
[15:38] these are for the Redemption of this man
[15:40] here but I want this is just still let's
[15:42] just look at this as just sanctification
[15:44] where the unclean Spirit goes out
[15:46] because you know what once you get born
[15:49] again you know how it's taught here at
[15:51] the church we go through that start over
[15:53] again we got to still ask God to forgive
[15:56] us of our sins cuz we have them he's
[15:59] just to forgive
[16:00] us and then Paul says I Die
[16:03] daily so there's a daily sanctification
[16:06] not just that not just that the snuff
[16:08] box went out and or the pill box went
[16:10] out or the beer can went out well guess
[16:13] what if Satan can't get you one
[16:16] way he's going to go right around here
[16:18] and he's going to come in this way and
[16:20] he's going to try to get you in another
[16:22] way right even though you're born again
[16:25] right even though you're born again
[16:28] that's right
[16:29] but God's made a
[16:31] way because the end is not yet so the
[16:35] end of you right there chapter and 24: 6
[16:39] the end is not
[16:41] yet now listen let's just give you a
[16:44] little thought though for the third seal
[16:46] listen to number seven for nation shall
[16:49] rise against
[16:50] nation and King D
[16:54] singular against
[16:57] kingom
[16:59] Satan's kingdom against God's
[17:03] kingdom cuz Satan's kingdom is this
[17:05] right here God's kingdom is the new
[17:07] birth that's what the third seal is
[17:08] going to tipe right the new
[17:10] birth Satan's kingdom is going to be
[17:13] against God's kingdom cuz really if
[17:15] you're not born
[17:17] again you're still in Satan's kingdom
[17:20] that's right cuz your soul is not born
[17:21] again you're not Gods you're not a son
[17:24] and daughter of God now you're
[17:25] potentially God knows God knows but you
[17:28] don't don't God knows if you're going to
[17:31] be a son and daughter of God but you
[17:32] don't that's why you got to keep that's
[17:34] why they asked brother brand said
[17:35] brother brand if if there's only going
[17:36] to be so many saved and and God knows
[17:38] how many why do you keep preaching he
[17:40] said well God knows I know that's
[17:43] right God's one that knows I don't know
[17:46] I'm I'm going to be like him I'm going
[17:47] to preach that everybody is saved and
[17:50] then somebody will be drawn to that and
[17:53] be saved okay and God knew that but you
[17:56] and I don't that's why we don't stop and
[17:58] say you see a lot of people in the
[17:59] message think redemption's over and all
[18:01] this stuff all those stupid doctrines I
[18:03] don't like the word dumb
[18:06] crazy
[18:08] anti false they got these doctrines that
[18:12] redemption's over and nobody can be
[18:13] saved well you know
[18:15] what if I found out right now that that
[18:18] was true I'd go to the
[18:22] house why stay here that's right yeah
[18:25] why do what we're doing yeah that's
[18:27] right why why pay my 10% of tithe to
[18:29] something that's already
[18:31] over I go home eat drink and be married
[18:35] true and that's you know what that's
[18:38] what that Spirit takes them to do they
[18:41] get so
[18:43] self-righteous they're
[18:45] so remember God said they'll believe a
[18:48] lie and he will let them believe it and
[18:52] they'll be down by it in other words
[18:54] he's not even going to tell them it's
[18:55] not true he's going to let them believe
[18:57] that lie and be down by it that's what
[19:00] that's scripture all right so I'm going
[19:03] to act
[19:05] like it's not over with Redemption is
[19:09] not over with you know what if I found
[19:11] out Redemption is over with right now my
[19:13] kids w't saved I don't what I do
[19:14] probably blow my brain
[19:16] though cuz what do you got to live for
[19:19] see we still got to live every day
[19:21] brother R said live every day like
[19:22] Christ is coming but live every day like
[19:24] he's not coming that's right if you
[19:25] building a house he's to continue build
[19:27] if you know coming tomorrow he said
[19:29] plant potatoes today he said you just
[19:31] plant potatoes today see because you get
[19:33] it you know why you lean over to one
[19:35] side and you get into that crazy Bunch
[19:38] that that hey everything's done and
[19:40] finished there's no reason to do
[19:41] anything you get lazy you quit your job
[19:44] if we knew everything was over why would
[19:45] we even like I said why would it even be
[19:47] here that would even change my mindset
[19:49] it change your mindset if everything was
[19:51] done and over and there's nothing you
[19:52] can do about it cuz when Redemption is
[19:54] over there is nothing you can do about
[19:55] it right let's go to house
[20:00] I I can go hunting this morning it been
[20:02] a good morning to get in the
[20:04] wood amen D amen yeah it been a good
[20:07] morning to be in the wood I walked
[20:09] outside this morning that's Frost
[20:10] everywhere and I thought wow be a good
[20:13] day to be
[20:14] hunting but you know what I come here
[20:16] and go hunting I'm hunting right now
[20:20] we're hunting for that last one to come
[20:21] in right so but see Satan will tell you
[20:24] he said you go
[20:27] hunting you call in sick like brother
[20:29] Joe said you call in
[20:32] sick
[20:33] no no we got a driving force behind us
[20:36] if you're born again and that driving
[20:39] force is even at
[20:40] sanctification he gives you the new
[20:42] spirit that new spirit is to be able to
[20:44] come amongst this group of people and
[20:47] not be
[20:48] ashamed not be
[20:50] ashamed see I'm not shamed to call you
[20:52] Breen even though I may know you're in a
[20:54] Sanctified or you tell me cuz I'm not
[20:56] going I'm not going to judge anybody say
[20:58] well I believe this one you don't do
[20:59] that don't do that but when you come
[21:03] tell me and say hey I'm in a Sanctified
[21:05] condition and I'm having trouble I know
[21:06] then what to pray for Timo com said I'm
[21:09] saved I said Okay God protect that boy
[21:13] Satan's fixing to let him have it if you
[21:15] didn't let him have it before he F to
[21:16] let him have it right tempt you with
[21:20] more than you've ever been tempted with
[21:21] before but you know what the end is not
[21:26] yet that Timbo going to be saved
[21:29] Sanctified filled with the Holy Ghost
[21:31] cuz that's what the Bible says that's
[21:34] because King Nation shall rise against
[21:35] Nation Satan's kingdom is going to fight
[21:38] against God's kingdom and there shall be
[21:40] famine and pestilence and earthquakes in
[21:42] many places and all these are the
[21:44] beginning of Sorrows all
[21:48] right that's going to be the third seal
[21:50] that we're going to get
[21:51] into next Sunday Lord willing and then
[21:55] we'll be gone the next two Sundays so
[21:58] who who's you did it last
[22:03] right wants to call you going call in
[22:06] six for two Sunday all right well we get
[22:09] somebody maybe we ask maybe brother Ryan
[22:11] can get up and do one that be
[22:14] good maybe brother Mark yeah maybe
[22:17] Brother
[22:19] Anderson Danny's already said no he's
[22:21] not ready yet not till his hair getting
[22:22] gr we got Bob and we oh yeah somebody
[22:25] will do it but anyway next Sunday we'll
[22:27] we'll start on the third
[22:29] seal everybody clear with the second
[22:31] seal think of that seal read that second
[22:33] seal again and
[22:35] think about you because see I can stand
[22:37] up here all day and tell you what I
[22:39] think that second seal is but God's got
[22:41] to reveal to you what it is that's right
[22:44] to me the seals are the most individual
[22:46] affair with God that ever has been on
[22:48] the face of the
[22:49] Earth you got to say God I hear what
[22:52] that man's saying but I want to hear
[22:54] what you're saying out of that right and
[22:57] then make it personal cuz even though
[23:00] you're born again these things are high
[23:02] this is a higher order of justification
[23:04] than what we're talking about a higher
[23:06] order of sanctification than what we're
[23:08] talking about but we're just kind of
[23:09] trying to get the basic down maybe we
[23:11] will go over it again but read the third
[23:15] seal and
[23:18] read just go read all this Matthew 24
[23:20] and just kind of get a just kind of get
[23:23] a feel for for that part of the seal
[23:26] because brother ROM didn't he come to
[23:27] the four seal I think it was till the
[23:30] Lord showed him that's what it was
[23:32] brother you can't find somebody do let
[23:36] know okay all right we'll uh we'll see
[23:40] what we can do I don't want to wear you
[23:42] out brother Jo I mean you know being
[23:44] being on being on Social
[23:50] Security okay how'd it go
[23:53] yesterday pretty I don't want to be
[23:55] spiritual but it wasn't one of best
[23:56] services
[24:06] okay okay all right all right let's
[24:13] go
