siebert's there and uh he sends his greetings to each one of you amen brother mike is about 76 years old and he just has all kinds of testimonies and you can just listen to him talk all day long he he went to oh he said he counted the times that he'd been to brother brown's meetings and it was about 40. majority of them were at the tabernacle so so he he has a lot of a lot of good testimonies and so we had a good time there i also wanted to mention before we we read the word i wanted to if you all haven't looked at uh at the new website of the church uh you should go and see it and brother joe did a wonderful job on it and it's it's an excellent job so uh man and it you know he took it took him a while to get get it going but uh it was it was a lot of material so you just thank him next time you see him and when you see him and say thank you it's more streamlined and it's easier to find things and it's better to view even the sermons now uh so so just thank him for that we appreciate his hard labor on that and man i also wanted to thank brother ryan also he sent out a uh a little a testimony out in the mail maybe some of you parents may have received it it was several sheets it was pretty lengthy but uh uh you should take time to read that it's the testimony of how him and his wife you know how they courted and and how god has has blessed that amen and it's something that really as especially for our young people you know they should really consider even reading and i encourage you parents to encourage your young people to read it because i'll tell you what i i believe the hand of god is they've been blessed amen when you do think when you do things the right way young people when you court the right way when you don't go ahead of the plan of god you're gonna have a good marriage amen because you did things the right way right right and i believe god has blessed uh brother ryan and sister gavin in a great way because they did things the right way they put god in front of their lives and before them and they still do so i encourage you to read that and uh and really consider and we appreciate brother ryan doing that taking it because i'm sure that took a long time to do it took a long time to do so i wanted to get those two things out there and so before we read the word so let's turn to the scriptures this this evening we want to go to genesis chapter two genesis chapter two verse seven through nine and uh i wanted to revisit this uh this uh this message again from when i preached uh last month about the tree of life i've just been looking at it a little bit more and uh and just the lord has been working with me on that and last time when i preached it didn't i didn't get to show some of the quotes and some of the things and uh so i wanted to go into a little bit more detail with it so uh so if you feel like well i've already heard this well you could hear it again and you get a double portion just you're going to receive however you what attitude you have towards the word that's how you're going to receive the word so so this is how the lord i felt led to go so you just pray for me this evening amen so let's just let's just bow our heads before we read the word our heavenly father we come before you lord jesus we thank you once again for the opportunity that you give us lord to open back the pages of your word father we know that you are the same yesterday today and forever lord you don't get old lord jesus we in our minds may think father god things get old things get are the same hum ho ho-hum and things like that but lord god to you father god you are the same lord you're eternal it's the same life lord god from beginning to end lord jesus and we thank you for that lord we ask that you would forgive us for our sins if there be anything that would hinder the service lord may you forgive us place it under the blood of jesus christ for we know that under that blood there's power father and lord we ask now that you would just help us lord help us to understand this material this word lord god let it not just be father god head knowledge to our heads lord but father god let us look into it closely and apply it to our lives lord for the time is at hand father god and i believe that and i know my brethren believe it with all their hearts lord we commit ourselves now unto you and we thank you father god in jesus christ's name amen amen genesis chapter 2 verses 7 through 9 and then verses 15 15-17 it says and the lord god formed man of the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and man became a living soul amen so he had eternal life in that soul right and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and thou and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil and the lord god took the man and put him into the garden of eden to dress it and to keep it this is verse 15. and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat of it for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die now let's read revelations chapter 2 verse 7 it says he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches to him that overcometh watch to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life amen amen which is in the midst of the paradise of god amen you may be seated this evening what a privilege amen in this hour that we have that we have access to the to the tree of life in this hour amen do you believe that i believe that with all our hearts amen amen the word has come in our day the the god has done uh what he could what you know what more can he do as the song says what more can he do there's nothing more there's nothing else that you can do now it's in your lap what are you going to do with that word what are you going to do with this christ amen what are you going to do with him in your life amen do you want more of him that you may obtain a full inheritance or a full redemption of not just your soul but of your body amen because that's what we're looking forward to in this hour amen over the redemption we have our souls redeemed amen we have eternal life in our soul but now we're waiting for eternal life for our bodies amen something that adam had the opportunity to obtain but did not obtain exactly but through our lord jesus christ we were able to we're able to in this hour amen praise god amen so um last time we were talking about and i had called the the the message uh all access granted and the reason why i called it that's because it is open full access to that tree in this hour and and and if you don't partake of the tree it's not god's fault it's your fault that you don't obtain the benefits of the tree amen because it's it's all axis amen and i gave the example of when you nowadays when we try to access something on the computer or when you're trying to access something on your phone you see and you oh and you try to open up your phone maybe you have to put a certain password in well if you're putting your pa a wrong password in or if it's not recognizing your face because it's not your face or you got a beard on your face [Laughter] just messing around brother bob but if it doesn't recognize you you you won't have access to what you need to obtain inside your phone right or tablet or whatever and same thing with god amen if he doesn't recognize his own image amen by the word through his word amen if he doesn't recognize himself amen you can't access anything of his benefits in your life amen he he's not going to recognize your deeds your own deeds he's not going to recognize what you can do amen but he only recognizes what christ can do or what he has already done through your life and if you're dependent on that amen then he can bless you and you have full access to his word amen full access to his benefits full access to his blessings praise god amen when you type in that password in and you get access amen you have full access to everything right supposedly i mean nowadays you got all these different different uh roles and all these different things now with computers so but that's the that's the whole line of thinking of that now the word access it means uh it means permission liberty or ability to enter or approach or pass to and from a place or to approach or communicate with a person or a thing yeah i like that to communicate with a person or thing freedom or ability to obtain or make use of something right amen god has given us freedom in this hour amen through him through him through through through him amen a way of me or means of entering or approaching right amen we appreciate him for for what he's done and amen and we have so much to be thankful for in this hour amen because hey man he's taking care of it yes he's taking care of it and it's so we could just if we could just get into that man if we could just get into that you know i i realize now more and more that um you know it really in this hour it has to take a revelation for anybody to get the word of god right if you don't get a revelation you're not going to understand the word of god is i i've just come down with people that i've talked to in the last few days even someone that at work that i was talking to yesterday and i just i was just telling him plainly about the message of the hour and just testifying to him pretty much talked for about an hour and it just boils down to if it's not open to you you're not going to understand it and and you can still be coming to this church here or any other message church for that matter and if you don't get what's going on it's because it hasn't been revealed to you it just boils down to that and you need to pray and we need to pray for revelation we we brother branham said revelation is the greatest thing that the church can have amen if your the word of god is not revealed to you it's going to be boring to you every single time you come to church and and i don't blame you because you don't understand it you haven't seen the whole picture but to us that have seen the whole picture we don't have an excuse to just sit there and just you know amen we we we got to serve god amen we have the full access open amen to us praise god praise the lord jesus so what is this tree of life amen that and and we talked about how this tree the word the phrase the tree of life is mentioned six times in the bible right only six times the phrase the tree of life now you have phrases the phrase a tree of life that's mentioned a few times and you see that um in proverbs and uh and also like in psalms uh you see the phrase a tree of life but only six times you find in the in the bible where it says the tree of life and then this and these six times three times as mentioned in genesis three times as mentioned in in revelation glory praise god now brother brown talks about this you go back and read this in the in the church age book that's where i got all that from but he talks about that and so and so uh these two books are the two books that satan attacks the most the book of genesis and the book of revelations so if he attacks both of these books the most then what is it that he's trying to keep us away from that's right you see the way has been opened to the tree of life but he is trying to keep us away from that tree of life you see now brother brown says in the in the in the in the church age book he says have you ever noticed how satan hates two books of the bible more than all others through liberal theologians and pseudoscientists he is always attacking the book of genesis and the book of revelation in both of these books we find watch we find satan's origin his awful ways and his destruction he doesn't like to be reminded about what he what his what his end will be i wouldn't either if i was in his shoes right you know that is why he attacks them he hates to be exposed and in those books he is exposed for exactly what he is have you ever noticed that when you expose something in somebody's life they personally start attacking you you bring something to light right they immediately the attacks go on you a per start person and you start getting personally attacked and you start getting called names and you're this that and the other why that's exactly what satan's doing because he's being exposed jesus said about satan he has no part in me and i have no part in him the devil would like to prove that different but he cannot so he does all he can to destroy confidence in the word right that's what he's trying to do in this hour and he's doing it he's working overtime i've always said he does his job better than we do ours he's 24 7 a devil and he does a good job at it and i salute him for that but you and i what are we doing when we have access to this full word right and we get lazy and we get laxed and we get nonchalant and we forget where he has we've come from and where we're going too remember he's he god has also told us where we're going what our what our what our and it will be amen that should excite us that should that should make us to act just as satan acts because he knows what his end is that the word of god should make us act because we know where we're going right we know the the story we know how the book the book ends and in reality the book doesn't end the book will continue amen continue for eternity it's a life but when the church watch this now but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her all right i'm going to read that again but when the church disbelieves satan and believes the spirit's revelation of the word the gates of hell cannot prevail against her you notice how what he said there that believes the rev the revelation of the word not just believe the word but the revelation of the word because you can believe the word many a drunk here can believe the word but doesn't they may not really believe the revelation of the word and that's two different things remember revelation will cause you to act revelation will cause you to live a certain way amen when you when you know beyond the shadow of doubt that something that you're something about yourself that he said about you when you know beyond the shadow of the doubt something in your life amen there's nothing that can take that away from you you saw it with your own eyes amen that's what revelation is praise god amen so we see that that word that word that phrase the tree of life is mentioned in the bible six times and uh and we talked we talked about how it's interesting you know that this is six times this the this phrase is mentioned in the bible three in genesis three in revelation the number six being the number of man very interesting amen and the and and we know that that if you know the numerology amen in the bible the number three is perfection the number five means grace the number seven is completeness or completion the number eight means new life resurrection new beginning eternal life amen and so in between there is the number six which is the number of man so that means amen that this tree of life has a relation to man praise god has a relationship a relation to man even the tree of the tree of knowledge of good and evil has a relation to man as well brother branham mentions that in in the message and so in all six of these places amen we talked about how in all six of these places it signifies the same thing it's it's a person right the tree of life is a person amen we'll go into a little bit more detail about this you know psalms chapter 1 verse 3 it says and he shall be planted like a tree uh he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water now this is that's that's an example of the bible mentioning mentioning uh planet like a uh he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water um i'm sorry that's that's just one example of where god talks about man being a tree amen the other example we gave was when the when jesus healed that blind man and he said and when he opened his eyes he said i see man as trees you see so god is always typing man to trees amen that's that's that that we represent trees and even to wood if you look in the scriptures and you look at wood and even the things the the the the wood that that noah used amen and for the boat and all that that all types uh humanity you see type types man so we could go all day with that but uh we'll maybe touch that some other time so um so this this tree of life amen we know that it's a person and and and this person amen is the originator of life right that is that that this tree of life is amen the originator of of of of is the source of all life amen praise god i'm so thankful that we serve the god who is the source of all life amen all life man it's not you know the god that the the that the muhammadans uh worship amen that that six armed god i think is sheba or whatever whatever the name is that's not the source of all life maybe they might think that but that's not the source of all life you know uh whatever god you may have out there you know and you can have a god out of anything denominations it can be a god in your life amen but that's not the source of life and you knew that you know that man if you ever were about out in denominations i mean i i was out in in almost seven of them that's why i say i go i went through the seven church ages before i came to the message amen i there was no life there i just following my mom and dad wherever they went but i always say it was just god trying to deal with them and leading them to truth amen there's no life in politics goodness gracious we we can see that this year more than ever how now more than ever i realize what brother branham said in the 1960s about politics i mean that that right there just clinches the nail on that exactly right it is rotten to the core you don't even know what to believe i i got people telling me now i don't even know what to believe now i don't even know what to do i said well trust the word that's right you see that's exactly what god is trying to god is allowing all these things so that we can stop putting our confidence on these politics all these politicians on trump and bidens and all these people i have no confidence in that they all will fail you amen we see that they've failed the word of god has never failed you though so go back to the word go back to the tree of life that's open to go back to that amen politics will fail you sports will fail you there's no life in sports i mean those sports stars now i mean they're bound their need just like to to to to the politics you know and uh to all these all these all these systems that they got going you know now uh just bound their knee in and then they'll do whatever because they they get paid by them you know they just they just do whatever they tell they tell them to do i don't know you know in their heart if they believe what they do but they bow their knees anyways amen there's no life in partying alcohol drugs you know those of you who have gone through those lives there's no life in that right i remember remember that story where brother branham saw that lady you know that young girl she was half naked through the through the hotel through the hotel lobby or through the hotel owl and she was talking with a with some beer in her hand and screaming oh there will be this is life and he said that's death right that's death yet they think it's life there's no life and there's no life in sexual things you know you've you know those of you those of you who've who've who are married and you know all that passes right the only life is in christ the only true enjoyment is in christ amen praise god amen so john chapter 6 through 8 amen declares to us jesus there was declaring to us that he is that a source of eternal life amen he called himself the bread of heaven and the water of life amen amen because if we drink from him you would live forever amen praise god and so this life is in his son in first john chapter 5 verse 11 it states and this is the record that god hath given to us eternal life and this life is in his son that's why you have to be in him and when you're in him he's in you amen and when he's in you you're in him praise god he that hath the son verse 12 he that hath the son hath life you see i don't there's no space there there's no room there for politics or anything he that hath the son hath life and he that hath not the son of god hath not life amen i can't get it make it be more clear than that amen praise god amen aren't you thankful for that the true trees amen the true trees and let's talk about these two trees here for just a moment in genesis chapter 2 verses 8 through 9 and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight now i want you to notice amen maybe for those who who are just coming in you know and trying to understand this word every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden now notice he differentiates the between those two trees between the trees that were good for food and then he goes in and says and this is a semicolon the tree of life also in the midst of the garden right right amen and the tree of knowledge of good and evil amen so there was trees in there that were good for food but then there was also a tree in there there was the tree of life that was totally different from these trees you see and then this tree amen was totally different from this tree as well amen praise god right so so we want that we we we want to make sure that we understand that those two trees were persons amen because those trees were in the was they're standing they were in the midst of the garden amen the tree of life was a person then if the tree of life was a person then logically that must mean that the tree of knowledge of good and evil is a person too right he believed that i mean brother brown taught all these things amen ezekiel chapter 28 verse 13 tells us talking about satan thou has been in eden the garden of god amen satan was in the garden of eden right obviously he anointed the serpent to do what he did amen praise god so man was to live amen they were the the food that they ate at that time from those trees was was not to fill their bellies and for them to live right it was just for their enjoyment amen exactly it was it wasn't for like the way we eat now amen do you know that we go i'm so hungry you know i can't you know i was so hungry the other day we we got to use that texas roadhouse card brother brother brother wade brother wade gave us a uh a little texas roadhouse gift card for christmas and and uh uh i guess he gave to all the sunday school but uh got to use it on monday at uh uh in in knoxville tennessee i was hungry we had been driving already maybe five hours or so and uh man i was hungry but i was waiting out i was holding off and man when i got there you know uh we had me some good uh i don't even forget what i ate but it was good though so good and we had leftovers for the next day but what was funny is that what what christine ordered was almost just as much as the gift card was [Laughter] again she ordered a big old rack of ribs and i always tell i always tell and i i was telling the uh a server there in panama city florida uh the other day i said you know every my wife orders these the big plates and when they come and serve the server comes and gives us the food he always gives me the big plate thinking that i was the one to order it but it's really her i'm the one who ordered the smaller one but she does it because she wants to use she shares it with with zoey and so it all works out but uh anyways so adam was not to eat to survive right we we know that well today we eat to survive but the he was to continue to eat from that tree of life amen all right from that from that person just as we are supposed to continue eating from that tree of life to even today amen how you get now remember adam was not eternal in his in his body adam only had eternal life in his soul therefore there was a purpose for him to continually eat off the tree of life amen just as we as born again christians we have eternal life in our soul we're not eternal on the outside or spirit but if we continue to eat from the tree of life we're heading to that body change amen praise god just as adam was supposed to go there amen now brother brahm says in the message in the ephesian church age watch he says this god's intention for his creation man is to express his words wow this is the intention of god in genesis adam was given the word to live by right he was given the tree of life to live by because the tree of life is the word and the word is christ a life lived by the word would be the word expressed amen i'd like to read that again a life lived by the word would be the word expressed amen when you are living the word amen when you're expressing the word that means you're expressing the expressed god right amen praise the lord he says is that true or not but did adam live by that word no because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word amen he gave up his inheritance he gave up his his his his right to the tree of life amen to to do what he did and we we know what what happened there in the story amen so we are to be living amen by the every word in order to truly be the word expressed not just part word not just half word not just what you like of the word it has to be a full word in this hour in order for us to obtain a full inheritance or a full redemption amen all right i i wanna honestly get that again it's gotta be the full word in order for us to obtain a full redemption you see what i'm saying amen now god wants this more he wants this badly just as much as you and i want it right amen in ephesians chapter one verses four through eleven we don't we're not i'm not reading the whole thing but watch what's the the things that he says in the in these in these verses he says that we should be holy and without blame before him in love he wants us to obtain that he wants us to be blameless we're the ones who sometimes condemn ourselves and keep condemning ourselves and keep bringing ourselves down and we can't do it and i can't do it i can't live this christian life i can't i can't i can't i can i can't when god is is rooting for you all the whole time he's got more grace than you could ever imagine that he has praise god because he knows you love him and he knows that your desire is for him even though you're in this falling condition see that we should be holy and without blame before him in love listen in verse 5 there haven't predestinated us unto the adoption of children by jesus christ himself it doesn't say that he will predestinate us having predestinated us in the past unto the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself not to another and then verse 6 talks about wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved glory he i i like how paul words it because it's all past tense right hath accepted right half done it's already taken care of glory you're the one who who who stops that from working in your life right it's you and i but to god it's already done as the song goes it's already done amen verse 7 in whom we have present tense in whom we have redemption through his blood right the forgiveness of sins verse 8 talks about he hath abounded toward us in all wisdom and prudence i just hear positivity the whole time i don't hear any negativity about you and i so why are we being negative towards each other ones we should be negative to us towards the toward the devil amen having made known unto us the mystery listen having made known unto us the mystery of his will we we have a an open book in this house right it's not a closed book it's an open book as john was given in revelations chapter 10 and john types to bride amen verse 10 it says he he might gather together in one all things in christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him see you're part of all those things amen and verse 11 there it says in whom also we have obtained an inheritance again being predestinated right being predestinated amen so i read that and i just read positivity you know that that right there is is is is those books that you know that you try to be you know get positivity from and all this there's my positivity word for the day right there my uh i forgot what they call it the uh i can't remember the the when you when you say something and you speak yeah positive thinking there you go that's more than positive thinking to me that's positive living right there amen praise god amen so adam had eternal life in his soul now let's keep this in mind but not eternal life in his body all right remember that he had eternal life in his soul but not in his body so in order for adam a man to obtain eternal life in his body amen he had to continue eating from that tree of life praise god amen and so see adam and eve they fell from their original estate right right they were supposed to continue if they they kept eating god told them amen that if that day that you eat thereof amen that day you will surely die now uh oh that day that they would eat from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil not from the tree of life amen they would keep living from the tree of life but it's from the tree of knowledge of good and evil that they would die that day now did they literally die no no amen but their bodies started to die for sure amen their bodies started and dying out they also died spiritually but now you have to watch how you say that too because they did not lose eternal life in their soul amen they still kept eternal life in their soul i want to read a quote here where brother branham talks about that amen they still had eternal life in their soul but they lost they lost that that relationship with god just as a few if you're walking with christ and then you start devin with the things of the world and you start going into into living for yourself your relationship with christ is going to suffer your relationship from that tree that tree of life becomes further and further away from you now that tree is not closer and closer to you're getting away from that tree but that tree stays still where you last left it right and wherever you last left it if you go back to it that's where you'll find it you see but that's what happened to adam and eve they they they died spiritually that's why they went and hid right they said uh you know god was saying we're out thou adam adam we're our dogs not that he didn't know where adam was he knew where adam was brother branham says that he wanted to make sure that adam knew where he was at right in what position and what condition he was in and when you recognize what condition you're in amen then god can help you but if you don't recognize where in the position and the condition that you're in and you think that you're doing good and you're living okay when in reality you know that you need him he can't help you because remember he doesn't force you to do anything that you don't want to do right that's why he gave us free moral agency you decide and according to your desire that's how he'll do amen but i'm so thankful for predestination amen because because by predestination amen he'll make sure that the way will be provided that you come to it amen praise god that you make the right decision right amen so so remember the fact that adam and eve died spiritually that did not take that eternal life that they already had in their soul amen amen amen that's why adam he continued to be the son of a son of god amen amen but he did not come to that redemption of that body but you see it wasn't god's plan for it to be that way amen now i want to read here a quote and uh and the brothers could bring it up uh blasphemous names brother brown says here see if and if you've got life without end how can you perish you have become a part of the eternal and there's only one thing eternal right but satan is not eternal i'm so thankful for that that's why he's not your brother no he becomes satan hell is not eternal amen hell was created right it's not eternal and watch and these bodies are not eternal referring to our body our physical bodies they were created right amen they were created but the spirit of god is eternal it never had a beginning or it never has an end and the only way we can have eternal life from the greek word zoe which means god's own life we have we become a part of god when we become sons and daughters of god and we have an enos life so the part that lives that lives us that recognizes this word from here to there that recognizes aeneas life life without end it's god's own life in us amen now watch this but what god did he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he become a living soul watch a soul that can't die see a soul that can't die now watch now we're going to get into honey plum to your elbows he says notice he breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils into adam's nostrils and he became an eternal soul glory because god breathed not what nature done but what god did right watch br he breathed the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he become a living soul so that is what gave god adam an eternal soul right right are we are we together on that amen now watch what brother man says then you say to me adam adam died brother branham but remember before adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him amen before adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him those who he foreknew he has called he got a lamb to redeem them he was a type adam fell watch then the lamb was provided for adam because already in his nostrils had become the breath of eternal god and he become a living soul he was a son of god amen amen so adam had eternal life amen in his soul when he when he fell he did not lose his eternal life in his soul why because the lamb was already slain before the foundation of the world amen the lamb jesus christ or in other words but but here's the thing it wasn't physically slain it was in the mind of god but eventually it would come to pass see in the mind of god when things happen it's like it's already done right and it's connected to that eternal life amen that's why adam could not fall from eternal life and his soul because it was already how could god breathe eternal life into him to his soul and he and then he and then he he takes away his eternal life that that's what brother brown said to be like an indian giver when i give you a gift if or if you give me a gift amen you gave it to me you didn't let me borrow it that's why it's called a gift you gave it to me you didn't let me borrow the gift so you can't ask me let me have my gift back because it's not your gift it's my gift and same thing with god amen he gave you eternal life in your soul so he's not going to take it back because it's yours because it's connected to him amen praise god you understand what i'm saying you understand what brother brandon was talking about and i believe brother dale has been bringing this out too but dale i think we've been kind of in the same line because this right here i had to preach to uh some believers in uh uh two weeks ago in in europe uh we i preached online and uh to some believers in portugal and spain and in germany and uh so i went on the same line but before i started i started uh i started reading i started i started looking at this and i found i found that quote because i i thought maybe that they might stumble on this i said i said i said lord let me find something that that that they would they would they would point that the the lamb was slain before and that's why adam could not lose his eternal life and his soul and i came down exactly to this quote and then coming back from ohio amen and brother dale's i was listening to the services and brother dale's preaching about the same exact thing amen so so i just thank god for that amen it's the word amen praise god to me that that opens up the picture even more further and it should to you don't look at it just quotes look at it as life glory if you could keep log he's just reading quotes and he just keeps reading quotes but you're not you're not reading the quotes you're just looking at them read the quotes and i believe it'll change you you want to understand the word right you want to come you want to understand the word right i don't know of anyone here that does not want to understand the word even further not just understand it but have it revealed to you but you have to pay attention in order for there to be a revelation [Music] pay attention so that you may obtain revelation amen praise god so adam and eve we see that eventually they got ahead of the plan of god you see they got ahead of the plan of god and and the same thing with you and i when you get ahead of god's plan when you start reasoning with god's word amen there's nothing but death after that you see what happened with eve amen when she started reasoning with god's word when's when satan came to her through the serpent and said thou shall not surely die right right all he did was added one word in there satan never comes with you to you with 40 percent truth and the rest of it lie he always comes to you with 99.9 truth it's that little percentage that that that that's deceiving and that causes you to reason the word right if you're not careful if you're not careful in this hour we are living in an hour where people are are are being fed that little point one percent right and that's causing them to reason things out that's why what brother wade's been preaching you know that this thing's so close right that it'll deceive the very elected if it was possible these two trees in the garden mingled with each other you see there was an atom there was there was a there was a cane and an abel you see there was a jacob and an esau in the bible very close then they even come to the to jesus and and and and judas so close no you couldn't tell that judas was a devil even though jesus had already said that there was a devil amongst them he said i chose you 12 and one of you is a devil he said but you can tell which one was the devil right same thing today you can't tell which one is the devil you'll be able to tell when you discern that that person is off point point one percent of the word right that's right remember it has to be full word in order to obtain a full redemption not not point not not 99.9 percent word it has to be 100 percent worth amen praise god amen and and same thing with with with and i just want to interject this because we have our young people today and young people in this church that are seeking marriage in their life right now maybe seeking seek going through those those stages in life and i just want i want to encourage you to be careful all right to be careful the choices that you make it's you by by you having you know feeling that you want a a partner in life and and having those desires that's all very normal there's nothing bad about that none of that is bad and none of that is abnormal and each and every one of us went through those same stages in life as brothers and as sisters nothing wrong with that but it's what you do and it's what you allow for those feelings to take over you and that you that you get ahead of the plan of god and then you make a mess out of your life because those feelings are real right and if you know what i mean those those who are older those feelings are real and if you don't hold and control them they're going to get you in trouble they're going to get you in trouble don't get ahead of the plan of god like eve did see eve got ahead of the plan of god and it felt good for the moment but it caused death right all right i just plain being raw with you all right because i feel that you're grown up and i feel that you understand that amen don't go and some of us probably in life went through that got ahead of the plan and it wasn't the same right sure god you know there's a permissive will in in life that god gives you but my is so certainly so nice to be able to live in god it's perfect will like sister gabby and brother ryan amen did i believe that god led them to amen and that's why i encourage you to read that that that that testimony that he gave praise god in ecclesiastes chapter three verse one it tells us to everything there is a season and they time to every purpose under heaven so there's a time for marriage there's a time for these other things amen that supposed to take place it's after marriage not before marriage i'm just telling you this because i know satan's sly [Laughter] satan is it wants to destroy your life and does not want for you to to he because if he can destroy your life that way that means then he can strike he starts destroying your life spiritually right because now you don't want to come to church see when when you're not serving god and when you're doing things behind your your back parents back and doing the things that you're not supposed to be doing you don't want to come to church because you feel guilty you don't want to you want you don't want to serve god you know what's right but you don't want to fully give in because you feel guilty and because you don't want your parents maybe to realize that what you've been engaging in so then you just act out a certain part you see and you act like everything is okay when in reality it's not and in reality you know what you got to do just be free if you know that you've done wrong or whatever just just let it go let give yourself to god and and let him take care of it and be free it doesn't matter who what happens just be free amen in christ serve him because the hour is late amen the hour is late and it's not time to play games and i i'm not saying that because i know something or nothing like that i'm just encouraging you hey man i'm encouraging you as because we have younger people that are coming up into those stages now amen that goes for my daughters too she just turned 14. and i know that she's gonna have those those those wanting to have a boyfriend and things like that you know but i gotta i gotta i gotta let i gotta let them know about these things she's over there looking at me looking all right i'll i'll i'll shut it all right so getting back to the to the to this tree of life amen so this first adam he never obtained eternal life for his body amen due to his unbelief to the word and he lost access to the tree of life so we read in genesis chapter 3 verse 24 so he drove out the man god drove out the man god drove out adam and he placed it at the east of the garden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so it was kept you see the way of the tree of life was guarded now brother branham even ties in this flaming sword which turned everywhere he ties it into even the the the beasts the four combat beasts amen turning in every wave for the east north west and south amen and uh they were they they were they were there to keep the way the the tree of life because look uh uh god says uh in in verse 22 there genesis chapter 3 says and the lord god said behold a man has become as one of us to know good and evil you see and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat and live forever you see so god was trying to prevent them from eating in that in that condition that they were in but they were not as brother dale's been bringing out they were not to it was not to live eternally but to live forever the bible says there you see god god was was was hindering from that to happen brother brown says in the in the breach between the seven church ages and the seven seals adam lost his inheritance the earth exactly all right and not just the physic not just this earth but the body the change of the body he lost that amen praise god now it passed from his hand to the one he sold out to which was satan he sold his faith and god to satan's reasonings therefore his eternal life his right to the tree of life his right to the earth belonged to him it belonged to him and he forfeited every bit to the hands of satan he passed it from his hand to satan therefore now it has been it returned and has been polluted and the seed of adam has destroyed the inheritance that adam should have had that's the earth amen the seed amen now adam's seed praise god it has destroyed that inheritance that's why sex doesn't bring us back right do you see what i'm saying sex was what caused the problem and sex can't redeem you back to it as raw as that sounds it can't because there's some people that even kind of think that way and even kind of preach on those lines they can't bring you back to that that's what polluted the whole thing god exactly you see right praise god amen so at that point there was no there was no way to have access to that tree of life again in its fullness i'm so glad you all are paying attention i don't see one person sleeping tonight that's wonderful i you know i'm gonna give y'all a clap [Laughter] amen that's wonderful i know it's hard on wednesday night i mean the other night i was having a problem and you know it's tough i was having an issue staying awake it's tough i understand but i hope that you're enjoying the word you know and it's not me it's the word amen we have a few for a little bit more just just hang on with me because i got i i have some things here uh this wonderful thing that i read today that just blessed my soul so there was no way to have access to that tree of life again but why watch there was no way to have access to that tree of life again in its fullness right you see throughout all the ages or throughout even before christ came on the scene the prophets and the abraham and all the the davids the daniels they have they had a form you know of salvation they were able to touch god and god was able to work in their lives so it wasn't that they were completely restricted you know from the but there was no born-again uh uh a process in their life and and definitely no no no way for them to obtain even redemption for their bodies they were looking at these things from far off right and they were desiring it amen but now we are looking at it right there in the pinnacle of it amen we're right here right on top of it just looking at it i mean it's it's it's here it's not that it's coming it's here and it's just got to manifest from the inside out amen saints praise god because god is ever present right amen praise god and last time we talked about the tabernacle of moses amen and i won't go into that just to save time amen but we know what happened in the tabernacle of moses only one the priest could only go in there into the holy of holies even even the other the other priests amen they could only go to to to us to the the the holy place there was the curtain there that's as far as they got but the priest one time the high priest one which jesus christ is the high priest of our redemption amen he could go in there with blood amen and back there be able to have full access amen to what to the blessings of god amen now even then you see the the the the uh the tabernacle of moses that and that wasn't even the full access to the tree of life neither exactly as powerful as that was right i mean could you imagine can you imagine you being a high priest going back in the back in the in the behind the curtain and being able to partake of that original manna that fell the first time they had a little bit of that mana still there and it was always being renewed it was it never spoiled behind that curtain because the presence of god was always there so you could always partake of it on a yearly basis when the high priest would go in there with blood amen they would he would always see that tree that limb amen that rod aaron's rod budding and it was not even connected to a tree it was a tree it was a branch not even connected to a tree and as i said last time but yet it was connected to a tree because the tree of life was back there amen the presence amen the glory of god the word of god was back there moses ten commandments oh my it was just just wonderful goodness i mean you could you could talk so much about the word of god and it's just it's all so interconnected it's it's beautiful i don't see how we can get bored amen praise god amen so that that's why the second adam jesus christ the word came himself to do what adam failed to do right now we're going back to to what jesus did now see the first adam failed here comes the second adam which is jesus christ amen and jesus hey man he defeated the enemy by the word the way adam was supposed to defeat the enemy by the word right he failed in doing that because he didn't take all the word but jesus christ amen he he defeated the enemy by the full word because he was the word that's why it had to be god to come down and rescue you and say man it wasn't a sun that he sent it was god himself that came down to die for you and me and to save you and die it was god himself amen through a virgin birth the bible says that it was jehovah amen it was god god with us emmanuel even as a baby that was god with us because he jesus christ didn't come the same way that even adam came right he came he came the way we came except it wasn't through what man and woman did it was what god did in the in the womb of mary but you see because he came through a womb of a woman because that's how we come to this earth because he needed to be a kinsmen redeemer do you see what i'm saying that's why he had to come that way amen praise god so he came amen jesus defeated the enemy by the word he died and resurrected in order to obtain eternal life for his own body and for our souls and bodies amen praise god amen we can read that in romans 6 5 for if we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall be also in the likeness of his resurrection romans 6 8 says now if we be dead with christ we believe that we shall also live with him right colossians 3 1 if ye then be risen with christ seek those things which are above where christ sitteth on the right hand of god amen watch what brother branham says here in the true easter seal i'm trying to go a little quickly now and your limbs aching and the little mothers with their babies and dads and aged and all waiting watching watching to see one sign of the living god then see him moving on the scene and prove that he's jehovah that he's jesus the resurrected one i'm alive forevermore in the keys and have the keys of death and help because he broke the seal of it he broke the seal of death he broke the seal of the tomb he broke the seal of hell he broke the seal of the grave and he opened the seal to the tree of life amen and watched and baptized us by his holy spirit into that tree of life and made us sons and daughters of god amen so now it's not just touching it or or just looking at the tree of life from far off amen now it's having that tree of life in us and you being in that tree remember it's not a literal tree it's a it's a person the person of christ amen that's what that tree of life is praise god and so we now today we have that promise of not just receiving eternal life in our soul but also eternal life on our physical bodies amen because he's the one who broke the seal of death hell in the grave amen and was the head and was the first fruits of the resurrection the head amen what do we always say i was mentioning this to the brothers in in portugal there what comes up from your pillow first when you wake up in the morning it's your head it's not your arm unless like you know maybe some of us that might come off like this you know dragging from the and it might be your arm it might be your leg i don't know it depends on how you wake up but a normal person wakes up their pillow their head off the pillow right and that's exactly what christ did he's the one who came up first because he is the head glory right and the body then follows what the head does what the intelligence does that's the reason if he raised from the dead amen then we must rise from the dead and if he received redemption in his body then we must receive redemption in our bodies as well hey we're cut we're in that process right now saints i believe that with all my heart exactly right the process is taking place right now and it's happening faster than we think so it's not time to play games with god it's time to get serious with god this word is coming as being revealed even quicker than amen glory he said he said that he would amen but the key thing is is for that process amen to take place from the from your soul right from the inside out exactly right that's the key remember what we talked about when we were talking about the kingdom of god the kingdom of god which is the the life of god this tree of life that's the kingdom of god it has to be a man rooted it has to be rooted first it has to be found at first in you that it can then be manifested on the outside you're not gonna you're not gonna take over earth and you're not going to possess the earth amen your earth and this earth if you've not possessed a man if you don't have the possession in your soul do you see what i'm saying you're not going to come here amen if you don't know how to even possess your own body how to overcome temptations how to overcome yourself how to overcome bad thoughts how to overcome all these things how are you going to overcome the the elements you see amen so that way to the tree of life it has been restored saints brother watch brother brown says in the in the in the resume of the ages but there are no cherubim flaming swords to guard the tree of life now amen there's no there's no the cherubims have been removed because christ has already re removed the seal of that tree of life now it's whosoever will come amen it's axis is open amen brother brown says oh come take the tree of life now instead of the cherubims now i want to say something instead of those cherubians guarding this throne they're out here seeking trying to run people guard them to the throne trying to bring them through the gate back to the tree of life again that they might take this and that's exactly what god is trying to do in this hour amen and i believe all this all this stuff with the virus and everything that's going on around us is what god is trying to do to take us back to this tree of life amen and when you're dependent on on on what you can get out of life when you're dependent on your bank account and on the money that you have in the bank and your plans and everything amen god amen goes in there and just shakes that nest and says amen you got a tree of life to look to right you don't look to these things of life you don't look to donald trump and you don't look to politics and you don't look to none of this amen you've got something better to look ahead to look to yes and it's that thing that god has given you in the new birth look to that which is the word supposed to be the word in you amen to manifest on the outside to a full redemption in the body amen amen revelations 2 7 and we just we read it but we will read it again he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches watch to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life it's to him that overcometh amen the thing is is that we want to we want to be called overcomers and we have not even overcome anything right amen there's something that you and i must overcome in this hour and the main thing is overcoming ourselves amen it's the greatest enemy that we have because satan comes in and anoints us amen anoints us amen but we must overcome ourselves we're the greatest enemy that we look at everyone in the in the mirror satan can't make you do anything right you're the one to decide if you're going to do it or not if you're going to think it or not if you're going to say it or not you're it's your decision amen but remember every time that you don't it's like you just punch satan in the face and gave him a big black eye you see and then you do it again the next day and it's another black card to satan's eye you see on a daily basis keep giving him black eyes amen with the decisions that you make amen praise god to him that overcometh amen but the thing is is that the overcomer should already be in you right right but you can't do it on your own it has to be christ that already overcame he's in you that means you're an overcomer with him jesus christ is the overcomer who conquered satan death hell and the grave if jesus christ is in us in the form of the holy spirit that makes us equal overcomers with him brother brown says here he says overcomers only that overcome the beast overcome his mark that's catholicism protestantism denominationalism let me just add whirly-ism and and uh luisism and and and babism uh brother dale ism and and and brother danielism and brother whoever amen to overcome all these isms amen let me just add that amen uh who overcome the beast his mark the letter of his name he'll have a right to the tree of life to enter into the gates where nothing that the files can ever go in see think of it now just a minute now as we just got a little bit farther tree of life will be for the overcomers only amen see this tree of life is only for the overcomers but god has opened the axis for whosoever will but he knows only the overcomers can come can only understand and really desire amen what because they're part of it they're part of that tree by that eternal life amen romans 8 11 tells us but if the spirit of him that raised up jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up christ from the dead shall also quicken your mortal bodies by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen do you believe that amen praise god amen just hang on with me just a moment amen so that process amen should be taking place in you right now and it shouldn't take place tomorrow it should take place right now if you don't have the new birth in your life right now get it amen tonight we have you have no excuse amen we can we pray with you we we whatever we need to do amen but get god in your soul tonight and you be sure that you have him amen right now in your soul and don't wait till tomorrow what you can do today don't wait till tomorrow there's no time for that nobody got time for that right do it tonight amen pray with your mom and dad ask them mom what is what is brother louise talking about explain it to me amen and you parents be willing to do it don't just say well just keep listening to brother dale on sunday no you you should know the word too right right don't depend on brother dale or brother wade or me or anybody or minister to to to amen you explain the word of god to your kids you should have the new birth in your soul amen to know the word of god you should know how to pray with them you should know how to do devotionals with them you should know how to do these things don't don't depend on anybody else to do that for you that's why your young people go the way they do because us parents don't understand don't know that we're supposed to do these things with them and then you wonder why my kid is lost in the world i'm sorry but that's the case it's not brother brown said it's not child delinquency it's parent delinquency amen and i believe that with all my heart now let me read this book this quote that's lengthy but we'll we'll this is the last thing this is the last thing but brown says this this this is the whole summary of of of of this whole matter and i love this when i i this is the first time i read this today to be honest with you and i thought it was wonderful in the church his book the ephesian church age brother branham says this now that we have come this far let me try to crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as i have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was jesus all right the other tree is definitely satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there all right they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto god in other words amen they they must have been related to man in some way or otherwise god would not have known anything all things and we know that he does that's why he's called an omniscient god amen because he's ever present and because he's ever present amen that's why he makes him omniscient amen now watch now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of of the earth the purpose of god was to share his eternal life with man glory that see we talked about that that that was the desire of god from the beginning was to share his eternal life he had attributes that he wanted to express amen you and i were part of those attributes part of those eternal attributes that he wanted to express amen see now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god was to share his eternal life with man ephesians 1 4-11 we just read that in revelations 13 8 and all that dwell upon the earth shall worship him satan whose name are not written the book of life of the lamb slain from the foundation of the world amen now watch but that life and i and i added i added this and uh in parentheses from the tree of life you see but that life from the tree of life could not and would not be shared in any other way than through the way of god manifest in the flesh this was a part of his eternal and predestinated purpose for him to come into flesh all right um this plan was to be to the praise of the glory of his grace it was the plan of redemption it was the plan of salvation now listen closely and i say that to you listen closely read closely god being a savior it was necessary that he predestinate a man who would require salvation in order to give himself reason and purpose of being amen that's why adam had to come to a sinful state that would give then god a purpose and a reason amen to do what he did for us and not just for us but he did it for adam as well but remember it had happened in the mind of god before the foundation of the world it was already done now watch that is 100 correct and multitudes of scripture buried out as does the very pointed verse of romans 11 36 of for of him and through him and to him are all things to whom be glory forever amen man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden they could not directly come and partake of it in in that in that sinful state that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first right amen i love that amen that eternal life of the tree have to become flesh first in other words christ had to become flesh that so that way that man could be redeemed back to that tree amen but before god could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save amen man had to fall man had to fall the fall which would be caused by satan had to have flesh to make a fault to make fall satan had to come through flesh also but satan could not come through human flesh to make the fall as would christ come in human flesh to restore the fallen see that's where satan make him he must he thought that he could interject himself into the human race by going into the serpent and and he and he did and it worked for what he thought it was going to happen you know he did what he did but it wasn't amen but he could not redeem amen like christ could come in amen right interject himself into the human race and redeem the race back to him amen but there was an animal the serpent so close to man that satan could get to that beast and through that beast he could get to human flesh and cause the fall and inject himself thereby into the human race even as jesus would one day come and inject himself into the human race into human bodies even to the extent of a resurrection wherein we would have bodies like unto his glorified body amen thus what god that what god worked out here in the garden was his predestinated plan amen and when is the last part and when satan had brought about that which was necessary to the purpose of god then man could not get to the tree of life in the garden see in that condition certainly not it wasn't time amen but an animal animal had caused the fall had it not talking about the serpent let animal life be shed was taken and his blood shed and the and then god had communion with man again but you see that was that was that that physical lamb that god killed and enclothed amen uh adam and eve but that that was only just a covering for them right it wasn't it wasn't eternal it wouldn't be eternal until jesus christ come and did the sacrifice you see see god that was god's permissive will amen but god's perfect will was for them to be fully redeemed restored amen and then god had communion with man again then there was to come a day when god would appear in flesh and by means of his humiliation he would restore fallen man and make him a partaker of that eternal life once you see this you can understand the serpent seed and know that it was no apple that eve ate no it was the degradation of humanity by intermingling the seed amen praise god i thought that was wonderful and that just really summarizes everything that i've been trying to say here for the last hour and a half almost that's exactly what god's been trying to do or has done glory in this our day amen and we may have troubles on every side saints we may have problems and we see the the situation around us amen but take it as it's the tender hand of jehovah leading us to that tree of life do you see what the jews had to go through in the during the during the world war two and during that time they went through terrible things we're not we're not promised amen that we you know that that we're gonna be protected from things like that something like that could take place i don't know you know but let me tell you what you have to keep in mind that it's god's tender hand leading us amen to the full redemption of our bodies and i say lord whatever needs to happen you let it happen lord right cause the after event afterwards is more glorious than anything around us right now oh my that's more glorious and amen that's than than the things currently happening amen god's standard hand amen praise the lord jesus do you love him amen do you believe his word do you believe that we've been redeemed in this hour you believe that we're we have i now full access to his to the tree of life i believe that with all my heart amen praise god let's stand to our feet amen let's just sing a little song amen and before we dismiss just one one quick song let's praise god god is in full control in this hour amen it's we the one that we get into let me tell you what saints i've been i i have been i have since january 1st i have purposed in my heart to not even even look at the news do not even watch the news do not even look at anything outside of the word right and i tell you what i feel so much better i you know not knowing anything about bill gates not knowing what anthony fauci is doing or not no hey man what they're doing what they're doing whatever but i'm doing what i'm doing amen to get access to to have that tree of life to come inside of me fully amen and to be redeemed on this outside i want the full word amen so you should you should be that should be your desire that's an encouragement to you it may mean not the news it may be
