[9:52] pretty good yangon
[9:53] we got three of them down here so that's
[9:55] we appreciate that you can't have them
[9:56] no more
[9:58] they gotta stay down here
[9:59] all right let me read this quote real
[10:01] quick and then we will read the
[10:02] scripture and be seated from power
[10:04] transformation look what brother brown
[10:05] says now work we've been taught and
[10:07] we're going to get started on the
[10:08] virtues next week
[10:10] but we've got to stay on this foundation
[10:11] we've got to make sure we're born again
[10:12] we got to know we're going to see this
[10:14] afternoon where brother branham not only
[10:16] says it one time he says it four
[10:18] different times these virtues are
[10:20] required
[10:22] it's a requirement of god it's not
[10:24] something we might need to do or
[10:26] something we need to bypass
[10:27] it's something we got to go through all
[10:29] right so brother brown says sometimes
[10:31] you have to separate from everything
[10:33] that's dear on earth to you
[10:37] i'm gonna read your scripture a little
[10:38] while jesus said forsake mother father
[10:40] sister brother and follow me
[10:42] all right to take your position
[10:45] that god has called you to that's the
[10:46] word we're going to be using a lot when
[10:48] we start in from faith to virtue that is
[10:51] a position
[10:53] and that is a position in christ not a
[10:55] position in school or a position in the
[10:56] church
[10:58] all right that's a that's gifts of god
[11:00] position of of god and we need to get in
[11:02] our position brother ryan said well what
[11:04] realize who we are what we're doing here
[11:05] and get in our right place then what the
[11:08] rapture will take place
[11:10] we're we're kind of a a body that's a
[11:12] little bit out of joint maybe um that's
[11:15] a whole body but everybody needs to get
[11:16] in there
[11:17] we need to we need a god chiropractor to
[11:19] get us back in to get us back in line
[11:21] you know i'm sure you can read between
[11:23] the lines
[11:25] what i'm saying see sometimes the very
[11:27] dearest person on earth you have to
[11:29] shake hands with them now what he's
[11:30] saying is shake hands with them and walk
[11:32] away from them
[11:33] just take your position in christ to
[11:35] where god has called you amen
[11:38] well i'm worried now if brother if
[11:40] brother uh donny's in his position no
[11:43] you worry about yours
[11:45] let brother donny worry about his
[11:47] all right
[11:49] there's
[11:50] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[11:52] the bankers to help him
[11:54] but let him
[11:55] you know
[11:56] let him get in his own position
[11:58] now look but what is god doing that's
[12:01] what we're going to talk about we've
[12:02] been talking about renewing of your mind
[12:04] transforming you from what you was
[12:08] maybe a daughter or a son or whatever it
[12:09] is from a lovely family sometimes he
[12:12] places you somewhere else
[12:17] god is a separator
[12:20] amen
[12:22] because it's his way of doing it see by
[12:24] the renewing of your mind to obey the
[12:26] word of god regardless of what the price
[12:28] is
[12:29] these things don't come now look our
[12:31] redemption wasn't a cheap thing
[12:33] it was the son of god had to die for us
[12:36] things of value come
[12:38] of great
[12:39] price
[12:40] that's by our heads lord thank you for
[12:42] this day that you give us we appreciate
[12:44] the time that we have here lord now i
[12:46] pray that you do sanctify us for this
[12:47] journey that we're on
[12:50] thank you for bringing us here lord
[12:52] thank you for a group of people that we
[12:53] can speak to

[12:56] of the way lord and you take over and
[12:57] you do the speaking father you do the
[12:58] revealing lord if there be anybody sick

[13:04] the highways that we've already called

[13:11] being a labor day weekend lord a long
[13:13] weekend people are taking off i pray
[13:15] that you'll just be with us now though
[13:17] just take care of the ones that are here
[13:18] lord that are faithful come to church
[13:20] today lord to hear from you father so i
[13:22] pray that you do that you would send us
[13:24] something
[13:25] to hear lord we pray in jesus name
[13:28] amen
[13:29] john 1 1 says in the beginning was the
[13:31] word where was the god and the word was
[13:33] god and the word was made flesh so
[13:35] there's a position the word was made
[13:37] flesh and dwelt among us and we behold
[13:40] his glory the glory of only begotten of
[13:41] the father full of grace and truth let's
[13:43] read first that's the longest and then
[13:44] you can be seated
[13:47] that every one of you should know
[13:50] now when we're gonna when we get i was
[13:51] reading last night
[13:53] about knowledge brother brown spends a
[13:55] lot of time on knowledge
[13:57] in the statue of perfect man book he
[13:59] don't spend a lot of time on virtue but
[14:00] boy on knowledge he spends several pages
[14:03] because we mix our knowledge with man's
[14:06] knowledge our knowledge with god's
[14:08] knowledge a lot of times and that's
[14:09] where we get mixed up it was saying last
[14:11] night in the bible study if you see a
[14:13] preacher get up and he preaches false
[14:14] doctrine that is not god coming out of
[14:16] his mouth
[14:18] because god can't preach a false
[14:20] doctrine amen
[14:22] that every one of you should know how to
[14:24] possess his vessel and sanctification
[14:26] and honor you may be seated in the
[14:27] lord's blessing
[14:29] to the reading of the word
[14:31] romans 12 verse 2 says be not conformed
[14:33] to this world but be transformed by the
[14:36] renewing of your mind
[14:38] that you may prove that's what god's
[14:40] going to do he's going to absolutely
[14:42] drew me and you he's going to prove to
[14:44] the devil that somebody that was born in
[14:46] sin shaping in the nicu a spouse from a
[14:48] mother's womb a liar doomed and on our
[14:50] way to hell he's going to use you to get
[14:52] us out of here
[14:54] he's going to work through you to get us
[14:56] out of here all of us collectively as a
[14:58] body nobody's going without the other
[15:00] one we're not going to leave an arm here
[15:01] we're not going to leave a finger here
[15:03] but by the renewing of your mind it's
[15:05] got to start in your what stinking
[15:07] thinking
[15:08] amen
[15:09] that you may prove what is that good and
[15:12] acceptable and perfect
[15:14] will of god i was reading last night
[15:16] where brother brown was talking about
[15:17] somebody said well brother ryan we can't
[15:19] be perfect he said the bible tells us to
[15:21] be perfect he said if the bible tells us
[15:23] to be perfect he's got to make a way for
[15:24] us to be perfect he can't just throw it
[15:26] out there like me and you may throw out
[15:28] a plan and brother gary looks at it and
[15:30] goes i can't build that
[15:33] why because we throw some drastic plan
[15:34] out there but not with god god's plan is
[15:36] perfect it's already done in his mind
[15:38] it's already finished so in second peter
[15:40] one now this is going to be the first
[15:42] part we've got to get we've got to nail
[15:44] it down that you we're either born again
[15:46] or not today today sitting in here in
[15:48] front of me looking at me you're either
[15:50] born again or you're not that's right
[15:53] there's no in between now you may be
[15:54] working toward
[15:56] but until you get we were talking last
[15:58] night the holy fire of god which is
[16:01] going to in the battle of gog and magog
[16:02] is going to burn
[16:04] demons up
[16:05] souls
[16:07] he didn't burn your soul completely up
[16:08] he burnt that old nature that was
[16:10] attached to you because you were born
[16:12] with a carnal mind
[16:14] he burnt that off by holy fire and
[16:17] you're inside of you your soul is just
[16:19] as eternal as god is because it is god
[16:22] all right so now but we got to get that
[16:24] settled down first if we get that
[16:26] settled down first then we can move
[16:27] forward
[16:28] as we were saying and we'll talk about
[16:30] in just a few minutes that's where some
[16:32] hate the cross some come to the cross
[16:33] and they get a really good experience
[16:35] i'll read it here in just a little while
[16:36] brother bryan said you get a good case
[16:38] of sanctification
[16:40] now that won't get you in the in the
[16:42] bride in the end time
[16:44] that just cleans you up
[16:46] gets the unclean spirit out but you've
[16:48] got to put god back inside there
[16:53] what you got to get a divine nature
[16:55] your own nature is horrible
[16:58] that's right
[17:00] everybody in the building would you all
[17:01] do this
[17:02] your own nature is horrible even the one
[17:04] that you have to deal with now in the
[17:05] next realm which is memories of
[17:07] conscious effects and imagination you
[17:09] got to deal with that there's there's a
[17:10] lot of things going on there that you
[17:12] got to deal with that's where that's
[17:13] where this is going to work at yes
[17:16] amen your souls is eternal as god is and
[17:19] when brother branham will read it here
[17:20] in just a minute brother brown said when
[17:21] you get born again you get all you got
[17:24] all you need for your journey
[17:26] but now you got to remember then then
[17:28] that's a group of people that says well
[17:29] we don't need the statue of perfect man
[17:31] teaching because we already got it
[17:33] well
[17:35] where's the youngest baby in the in the
[17:37] place
[17:39] probably ellie
[17:41] well let's take ellie beautiful little
[17:43] girl she is and let's just go put her in
[17:44] her closet she's a human
[17:46] right
[17:47] she's a human let's go put her in the
[17:49] closet and don't feed her
[17:50] she'll die that's right that's the way
[17:52] it is with god you'll die if you don't
[17:53] get fed
[17:54] but you have everything you ever faculty
[17:56] in her to be a wife to be a mother is
[17:59] right there sitting in her now but she
[18:00] has not developed it yet same way with
[18:02] me and you because you and i are newborn
[18:04] what babies
[18:05] newborn babes in christ down here at the
[18:07] bottom of the pyramid
[18:09] babies crying
[18:11] wanting daddy all the time
[18:14] so watch what simon peter said look
[18:16] simon peter a servant apostle of jesus
[18:18] christ
[18:19] to them
[18:20] that have obtained
[18:24] went out and got it
[18:28] like precious faith with us
[18:31] now that's peter talking that's peter
[18:33] that's one of the apostles that's one of
[18:35] the disciples of jesus that's one man
[18:38] that has these virtues because he's
[18:40] going to tell you to get them he's going
[18:42] to tell you you need them so if he tells
[18:44] you you need them he's already got them
[18:47] and god thought enough of him to put him
[18:49] in an eternal word of god so there's the
[18:51] eternal word of god telling us
[18:53] that you have to obtain a light precious
[18:55] faith that's why i'm spent for two
[18:57] months on trying to make it sure that we
[19:00] know either we're born again or we're
[19:01] not i want to make sure we either know
[19:03] one of the two
[19:04] all right and it's not just a feeling
[19:05] it's not just emotion it's not just well
[19:07] brother around with a prophet well i
[19:08] come to church i believe brother dale's
[19:10] uh my pastor and and we got all this
[19:13] down and everything that's good
[19:15] but are you born again
[19:18] because you know what they came up to
[19:19] paul and they and paul said they started
[19:21] talking to him you know cornelius or
[19:23] wherever the house he was and he was
[19:25] preaching he was a good guy and paul
[19:26] said
[19:28] have you ever received the holy ghost
[19:29] since you believed all that
[19:31] so i want to say to you today have you
[19:32] received the holy ghost since you well
[19:34] i've believed this for 50 years have you
[19:36] received the holy ghost since you
[19:38] believed
[19:39] in what you got amen
[19:42] that you have obtained like precious
[19:43] faith with us through the righteousness
[19:45] of god and our savior jesus christ grace
[19:48] and peace be multiplied unto you through
[19:49] the knowledge of god and of jesus our
[19:51] lord according as his what divine power
[19:54] what we say power was
[19:56] dunamis dynamite
[19:58] dynamo power according as he has given
[20:01] as his divine power has what given unto
[20:04] us
[20:04] all things that pertain unto life and
[20:07] godliness through the knowledge of him
[20:08] that has called us the glory and virtue
[20:11] that's why i've been telling you
[20:14] folks if you don't go to church you
[20:16] ain't born again
[20:18] i'm sorry you can't go across the word
[20:20] of god
[20:21] i've been telling you all this and i've
[20:23] heard other preachers online and
[20:26] everybody is trying to get people to
[20:27] just to do the number one simple things
[20:29] brother brown said abc's
[20:34] then we'll get the xyz
[20:36] but we got to get the abcs first
[20:41] it ought to be your desire i read to you
[20:43] the other day it might it must be your
[20:44] desire you're yearning to be a church
[20:50] and i'll promise you about saturday
[20:52] evening about 10 or 11 o'clock
[20:54] something's going to happen
[20:56] that didn't happen all week
[21:01] and as i said before he got diarrhea
[21:05] lost your dog
[21:08] can't find the keys to the car
[21:10] i don't have any gas in my car so we
[21:12] can't go to church today
[21:13] garbage
[21:15] garbage it's just excuses and you know
[21:17] what you're gonna have to answer to god
[21:18] not me so don't don't think it's me you
[21:20] gotta answer to god cause he wrote it in
[21:22] his word
[21:23] he said and much more as the day
[21:25] approaches much more
[21:28] we need to try our best to do what we
[21:30] can do to
[21:31] live the word of god ain't not what a
[21:33] christian life is no bro wait it's just
[21:35] believing brother branham was the
[21:36] prophet
[21:37] no there's going to be hell's going to
[21:39] be full of people that believe brother
[21:40] brown was a prophet
[21:44] well i'll preach it anyway
[21:45] through the knowledge of him that has
[21:47] called us what called us to glory and
[21:49] virtue whereby are given to us what
[21:51] exceeding
[21:52] amen exceeding great and precious
[21:54] promises that by these what these
[21:57] promises and we're going to read this
[21:59] the way brother branham read it either
[22:01] this afternoon i may have in my notes
[22:03] we're going to let him read it and break
[22:04] it down because he says by what by these
[22:06] promises so are there promises of god
[22:08] amen all right it's not a promise peter
[22:10] may it's a promise god made if you'll
[22:12] live these virtues guess what
[22:14] something's going to happen
[22:16] that you may be
[22:18] partakers of the divine nature
[22:21] having escaped the corruption that is in
[22:23] the world through lust
[22:25] and that's where we've been right there
[22:26] for several months we've been on the
[22:28] foundation of faith and like i said
[22:30] before it looks like a cross almost and
[22:32] that's where we were talking about the
[22:33] other day
[22:34] about that that's the beam that we have
[22:36] to carry because listen
[22:39] it's not easy
[22:41] it's easy being a christian
[22:44] okay it should be
[22:46] but it's so contrary to the world it
[22:48] makes you think that you're that you're
[22:49] you know you're having ladies your
[22:51] sisters you're having to not cut your
[22:53] hair no if you'll get born again you'll
[22:55] know inside of you that's what the bible
[22:57] says
[22:59] not what william branham said it's been
[23:01] in the bible way before william branham
[23:02] got here
[23:04] going to church it's been way before
[23:05] william branham got here
[23:09] so the first stage we know is the birth
[23:10] we've been on that i want to make sure
[23:12] that we understand that we're not just
[23:14] justified that we're not just sanctified
[23:16] that we're not stuck in a rut that we've
[23:19] moved on with god that we want to know
[23:21] more of god
[23:23] isn't that the christian life it's
[23:25] wanting to know more of god i want more
[23:27] of you we sing all these songs more of
[23:29] you and the different things
[23:31] do we
[23:35] well i've got this not
[23:38] you'll have to talk to god about that
[23:40] so romans 8 verse 14 for as many as are
[23:42] led by the spirit of god look they're
[23:44] led by the spirit of god they're the
[23:46] sons of god
[23:47] for you have not received the spirit of
[23:49] bondage against fear you're not bound
[23:52] now the world thinks you're bound
[23:54] the world thinks we're bound
[23:57] to a cult or to a man
[23:59] or to a this or to a ladder we got to do
[24:01] this we got to do that
[24:06] like brother donny says he says they
[24:08] call us the skirt church they can't call
[24:09] us nothing else so they call us a skirt
[24:11] church
[24:12] because every time they see you wearing
[24:13] a skirt well thank god
[24:16] hey man what a testimony
[24:19] for as many as led by the spirit of god
[24:21] what they are the sons of god for you
[24:23] have not received the spirit of bondage
[24:24] again to fear because when we go up this
[24:26] statue of perfect man
[24:28] it's not a fearful thing
[24:30] as far as being afraid
[24:34] you shouldn't be afraid to want virtue
[24:36] you shouldn't be afraid to want the
[24:37] knowledge of god you shouldn't be afraid
[24:40] of that
[24:41] well
[24:42] boy bro when we get up there brother
[24:44] kindness i don't know if i love my
[24:45] brothers i love myself well then you
[24:47] ain't gonna make it
[24:49] amen
[24:52] because he made provision for you to
[24:53] make it yes sir
[24:57] i was reading the scripture
[24:59] you know we're talking about beams we've
[25:00] been talking about beams you know the
[25:02] cross beam that goes on top of the cross
[25:04] and i went to the scripture where jesus
[25:06] said
[25:08] how can you that's got that little bitty
[25:12] you know you're talking about the little
[25:13] moat which is a little bitty small straw
[25:16] in your brother's eye and you can't get
[25:18] the beam out of your own eye
[25:20] all right
[25:22] remember when you point fingers how many
[25:23] you got pointing back at you
[25:25] you got three of them pointing back at
[25:26] you all right
[25:29] we have to say things as ministers i
[25:31] think this other day we have to say
[25:32] things as ministers because we're called
[25:34] of god to do that
[25:36] but we do it like brother dale's always
[25:38] done it with softness
[25:40] and and wisdom and we pray that we
[25:42] continue that we can do it that we can
[25:44] absolutely cut your head off and you not
[25:46] even know it
[25:49] for we are not
[25:52] surgical
[25:54] but you have received what the spirit of
[25:56] adoption so what is adoption adoption is
[25:59] placing so it's going up the statue of
[26:01] perfect land
[26:02] perfect man you're not adopted at your
[26:04] new birth
[26:06] yes you are but no you're not you're not
[26:08] at full adoption you've been adopted
[26:10] into the family but then you have a
[26:12] growth development
[26:14] or you have to go through a process
[26:17] this whole thing is a process
[26:19] amen
[26:21] for we have received the spirit of
[26:22] adoption whereby we what cry cause we're
[26:24] babies
[26:25] daddy i need this
[26:27] i've said many times before remember
[26:29] when you first got born again it was all
[26:31] just wonderful i mean you know
[26:33] uh roses and and you know you had the
[26:36] the
[26:37] lawrence welt with all the bubbles going
[26:39] up you know and all that stuff and some
[26:41] people the young people go who's
[26:42] lawrence well
[26:44] but all of us older ones remember the
[26:47] bubbles coming up you know it was just
[26:49] so nice yeah that happens at one time
[26:51] and then you ask god for something and
[26:53] he gives it to you now i'm going to read
[26:54] you a quote this afternoon where brother
[26:56] brown says
[26:58] even if god don't give it to you if you
[27:01] come up this statue of a perfect man to
[27:03] a certain place having patience he says
[27:05] have patience with god he said knowing
[27:07] that if you don't get it
[27:10] there's a reason you don't get it and
[27:12] god has that reason and it's your best
[27:14] remember i said the best nose you ever
[27:16] get from god is the best yes as you'll
[27:18] ever get if god says no you don't need
[27:20] to go there then don't go there
[27:22] but you know what you know what he's
[27:23] going to do he's going to stand out of
[27:24] the way and let you go on if you want to
[27:26] do it
[27:27] but you have received the spirit of
[27:29] adoption whereby you cry daddy daddy
[27:32] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[27:34] our spirit what that we are the children
[27:35] of god children yes and if children then
[27:38] heirs heirs of god and joint heirs with
[27:40] christ if so be that we what suffer with
[27:42] him amen
[27:43] that we may also be what glorified
[27:46] together
[27:47] he got a glorified body we were talking
[27:49] about that last night he got a glorified
[27:50] body so we're going to get a glorified
[27:52] body amen so now we looked at baby form
[27:55] justification as we saw on the map and
[27:57] sanctification that is in your soul
[27:59] that's god working inside your soul
[28:01] everybody with me on that where do you
[28:03] sin you sin in your soul
[28:06] you don't sin with your flesh
[28:08] your flesh is just a what it's just a
[28:11] vehicle to manifest what's inside of you
[28:14] all right so in your soul we're looking
[28:16] at justification where your sins where
[28:18] you do as we were talking about you come
[28:20] to the cross
[28:21] you say god forgive me of my sins i'm
[28:23] sorry
[28:25] you died for what you died for me so
[28:27] that we can get rid of those sins that's
[28:30] right
[28:32] but then we turn around though and go
[28:34] back the other way and start doing it
[28:35] again because that's justification
[28:37] we don't have the want to stay at the
[28:40] cross to completely die
[28:43] everybody all right with that
[28:44] all right sanctification's the same way
[28:47] we continue a little bit further what
[28:48] sanctification we were talking about
[28:50] last night
[28:51] brother brown said god did the world the
[28:53] same way does you under justification he
[28:55] took noah got noah god put him in an ark
[28:57] and god destroyed the whole world and
[28:58] baptized this earth
[29:02] all right
[29:03] then he came the next 2000 years jesus
[29:06] came himself
[29:07] to cleanse and claim it sanctify it when
[29:10] his blood dropped on the earth he
[29:11] claimed the earth where were you at the
[29:13] time of the crucifixion your body was in
[29:15] the earth all right
[29:17] your physical body
[29:20] and then we come to the baptism of the
[29:21] holy ghost is where we see that gog and
[29:23] magog is going to be a fire like we were
[29:25] talking about last night the battle of
[29:27] armageddon is man's fire
[29:29] the battle of gog and magog is god's
[29:31] fire
[29:32] we want god's fire to burn us out we
[29:33] don't want a man to stand up in the
[29:35] pulpit and tell us everything's okay
[29:38] that's right
[29:40] that's man's fire
[29:42] you might miss something
[29:44] but with god's fire he's not going to
[29:46] miss a thing
[29:47] he's going to boil you out tear you up
[29:52] separate you from the world separate you
[29:54] from your parents
[29:56] the great prince of peace stood one day
[29:58] and said i didn't come to bring peace
[30:00] that's the bible
[30:02] he said i've come to bring a sword
[30:04] to divide yes
[30:07] listen
[30:09] god's not a mingler
[30:11] jesus christ is not oh well we're all
[30:13] going to make it the baptists are good
[30:15] and the methodists are good and we just
[30:16] all over lump him in one lump now god
[30:18] didn't do that
[30:20] he said unless you what take up your
[30:23] cross we're going to see it just a
[30:24] minute your cr your cross not his and
[30:27] follow me you'll have no part with me
[30:29] unless you forsake father mother sister
[30:32] brother
[30:33] he told the guy one time he said a guy
[30:35] comes up and we think that was pretty
[30:37] good guy walks up and says well jesus i
[30:39] can't come to your in other words i
[30:41] can't come to your feast i've had a
[30:43] death in the family
[30:46] oh now if a preacher
[30:48] brother john if a priest or what if
[30:50] y'all like brother carl said i gotta go
[30:52] to the funeral today i said let the dead
[30:54] bury the dead you need to be in church
[30:57] now that's pretty awful right
[30:59] no it's not it's what he said
[31:02] that's what jesus said not what i said
[31:04] and it's not my interpretation read it
[31:05] in the bible
[31:09] he said let the dead bear the dead come
[31:10] and follow me
[31:13] we've become too wishy-washy
[31:17] that surgical knife will cut you
[31:19] completely if you'll let it sit the
[31:21] surgical knife of the word of god the
[31:23] sword the word of god will cut you and
[31:26] divide
[31:27] what you don't need and what you do need
[31:29] and when we go up the statue of perfect
[31:31] man it might be more like a chainsaw
[31:36] or a serrated edge knife but you know
[31:38] what it's going to help us
[31:41] i want us to be the most powerful church
[31:44] on the face of the earth not just
[31:46] building not just lula georgia but the
[31:48] bride is going to have to be
[31:51] the final voice of the final age she's
[31:52] going to have to be the one that
[31:54] manifests god
[31:56] that when we need something we don't
[31:57] have to call three four people we ask
[32:00] god for it ourselves
[32:02] and you know what he'll back it up
[32:04] all we gotta do is say what that ain't
[32:06] nothing but the truth
[32:08] everything you've listened to for 50
[32:09] years you got to believe it and live it
[32:11] and say that ain't nothing but the truth
[32:13] and then what's god do
[32:15] what he said he would do
[32:17] amen
[32:18] so now look in sanctification he said it
[32:20] give you a new spirit now that spirit
[32:21] isn't god's spirit that's your spirit
[32:23] what's he do he cleans your spirit up
[32:26] all right
[32:26] unclean spirit goes out of your soul
[32:29] can't be two can't be god and the devil
[32:31] in your soul at the same time
[32:33] but there is a time when there's nobody
[32:35] in there
[32:37] unclean spirit goes out walks in dry
[32:40] places seek his threat finest none comes
[32:42] back into his house
[32:44] finds it swept and garnished
[32:47] alcohol's gone cigarette's gone this is
[32:49] gone
[32:51] so i said you cannot there is no way you
[32:53] can base your new birth on quitting
[32:56] these things of the world
[33:01] you can quit drinking and not be you may
[33:04] still be the most ranked center in the
[33:06] world
[33:07] the drink is most smoking cussing
[33:09] running around and all the things we did
[33:10] before bc before christ
[33:13] that should go out of sanctification
[33:15] that's the unclean spirit that goes out
[33:17] but what's going to happen is if you
[33:18] don't get it filled up with god's spirit
[33:20] he's going to satan's going to move in
[33:21] with his religious buddies and they're
[33:23] going to come in put you in a church
[33:24] that's right
[33:27] well
[33:29] if you get to go
[33:33] that's your spirit
[33:35] god gives you a new spirit then he says
[33:36] i'll put my spirit
[33:38] that's what i want
[33:40] i want the spirit of god inside of me
[33:43] i don't even want the spirit of god
[33:44] anointing me
[33:47] not yet
[33:49] i want him in me first and then he
[33:51] anoint me all he wants to
[33:52] amen
[33:54] i want him inside the holy of holies
[33:58] but the thing god has to do is what give
[34:00] you a new spirit make your nature
[34:03] a little more gentle
[34:05] and settled down
[34:07] or he couldn't even live with you
[34:10] under the baptism the holy ghost look
[34:12] seeing that you have purified your souls
[34:14] in obeying what the truth
[34:16] through the spirit under what unfeigned
[34:18] love of the brethren see that you love
[34:21] one another one another with a pure
[34:23] heart
[34:24] fervently
[34:26] being born again not a corruptible seed
[34:28] but of incorruptible by the word of god
[34:30] which liveth in the body forever
[34:32] now how are we going to do that
[34:35] paul tells us he said in hebrews 6 verse
[34:37] 1 he said therefore leaving the
[34:39] principles of the doctrine of christ
[34:41] what is what was the first doctrine of
[34:43] jesus christ brother brown tells us
[34:46] you must be born again he looks at
[34:48] nicodemus and you must be born again
[34:50] that's his first major doctrine kingdom
[34:52] of heaven is the hand which is the new
[34:53] birth but he tells nicodemus you must be
[34:55] born again all right
[34:57] so therefore leaving the principles of
[34:59] the doctrine of christ let us go on into
[35:01] perfection
[35:02] not laying again the foundation look
[35:04] once we lay this foundation of this
[35:06] building why would we want to lay
[35:08] another one on top of it
[35:10] why would we want to lay an extension of
[35:12] one oh yeah we like to extend our house
[35:15] and make it a little bit bigger but we
[35:16] talk about god's house
[35:18] god's house is perfect when he begins
[35:20] and it will stay perfect
[35:22] till the end
[35:24] let us go on into perfection not laying
[35:26] again the foundation of repentance from
[35:28] dead works and of faith toward god
[35:31] please we don't need to waste our time
[35:34] keep asking god for forgiveness for the
[35:36] same thing listen if you're still doing
[35:37] the same thing over and over you need to
[35:39] get born again
[35:42] because under justification that what
[35:44] that chops off your past sin that puts
[35:46] it in the sea of god's forgetfulness you
[35:48] need to put a no fishing sign up do not
[35:50] let anybody go there even yourself
[35:54] throw the fishing pole away
[35:58] because you know what when god put it
[35:59] there he can't remember it
[36:02] that ought to make you happy god can't
[36:05] even remember it
[36:07] who can lay anything a charge to god's
[36:10] elect
[36:11] it's god that what justified
[36:14] about bit my tongue off
[36:18] that'd be disastrous wouldn't it for
[36:19] some of you it would be a blessing of
[36:21] the doctrine of baptism a laying on of
[36:23] hands and resurrection of the dead of
[36:25] eternal joy what basic doctrine
[36:27] and this look and this will we do
[36:30] if god permits
[36:33] then we talked about the tabernacle just
[36:34] for a minute we know that there's three
[36:37] uh uh i wish we could have brought in
[36:40] yesterday's or the bible study from
[36:42] yesterday
[36:43] because that's why the whole thing we
[36:44] talked about that's why that's why i
[36:46] love the future home the future home
[36:48] book gives you the whole plan of
[36:50] redemption from your body all the way to
[36:53] the earth and the new city coming down
[36:55] from heaven
[36:56] so that to me that's the greatest book
[36:58] and he keep he preaches three
[37:00] positions or three stages of grace
[37:02] justification saints kitchen baptism
[37:04] holy ghost just like the tabernacle as
[37:06] we were talking about you got your outer
[37:08] court which is where the laver the altar
[37:10] it's all messy you get sunshine you get
[37:12] rain and then all of a sudden you can
[37:15] walk inside that place right there in
[37:16] the middle and then the world is now
[37:19] beginning to go away from you
[37:21] all right you've got now the shoe bread
[37:23] and you've got the altar of incense
[37:25] which is inside that little place right
[37:26] there but also inside there's what the
[37:29] holy of holies
[37:30] and that's what you've got to get to
[37:32] listen it was death to go in there but
[37:34] it's death did not go in there now
[37:36] we must come boldly to the throne of
[37:38] grace
[37:40] and then we were talking about the ark
[37:41] of the covenant just to just to uh
[37:43] background for some that weren't here
[37:45] what was inside that box there's the box
[37:47] right there that's a replica of the ark
[37:49] of the covenant now remember the mercy
[37:51] seat is what's sitting on top of it
[37:52] where those two angels are
[37:55] everybody with me all right two
[37:56] cherubims
[37:57] but inside that
[38:00] inside that
[38:02] it's something three things
[38:06] kind of interesting three things
[38:09] there's the two tables of stone which is
[38:10] the which is the uh ten commandments
[38:13] that moses got from god
[38:15] then there's a little um
[38:17] basket that's got the manna which in
[38:19] other words that's what god produced
[38:20] also
[38:22] and then also there's that bud there's
[38:24] that there's that uh branch or that old
[38:26] dead stick now it used to be dead now
[38:28] it's got green on it
[38:30] all right
[38:31] but when they put it in there
[38:34] as we were talking the other day why did
[38:36] it go in there well you know why because
[38:38] listen wanted to be a minister and this
[38:40] one to be that this one to be a deacon
[38:42] and this one wasn't qualified but you're
[38:43] willing to do it anyway
[38:44] all right so god just said hey give me
[38:47] 12 sticks
[38:49] all dead
[38:51] i'm going to give them to my prophet
[38:52] moses he's going to put him in that ark
[38:54] right lamb right down in front of the
[38:55] ark and he said whoever's one that buds
[38:58] and grows almonds overnight he said
[39:00] that's the one you need to listen to
[39:02] all right
[39:04] so the ark is what the ark is a symbol
[39:06] of the son of man but it's also a symbol
[39:08] of who you
[39:10] as we said before look where brother
[39:12] brown talks about this in 1955 he said
[39:15] now watch the ark of the covenant now
[39:16] remember the ark of the covenant was not
[39:18] made out of pure gold
[39:22] no it was wood acacia wood
[39:26] overlaid with gold all right everybody
[39:28] with me because what you know why
[39:30] because this right here
[39:31] anyone knows the scripture that gold
[39:34] speaks of deity so the outside of that
[39:36] is deity and wood speaks of humanity
[39:38] that's why it had to be a rod that was
[39:41] put in the ark which symbolizes your
[39:43] humanity it also symbolizes that the
[39:45] great ark of the covenant which hung on
[39:47] calvary he was a mortal man
[39:52] y'all don't get sleepy on me now louise
[39:54] they did a little bit later than didn't
[39:56] you
[39:58] watch the ark of the covenant he said
[40:00] you make it out of a case you would and
[40:01] overlay it with gold
[40:03] anyone who knows the scripture knows
[40:04] that gold speaks of deity and wood
[40:06] speaks of humanity that's why it was
[40:08] hung on
[40:09] a cross that was wood
[40:11] and he said you shall cover it overlay
[40:13] it with gold over the wood that's deity
[40:15] over the wood thank god
[40:17] amen
[40:18] because he stands between the judgment
[40:20] that's inside of that box
[40:22] which was the ten commandments that what
[40:24] that would kill you
[40:27] but you had to go through the goal first
[40:29] to get to that that's deity over the
[40:31] wood christ over the church
[40:33] inside and out deity
[40:36] overlaid you'll have a lid on top of it
[40:38] it'll be a mercy seat and the law will
[40:39] rest in it you sprinkle it over the with
[40:42] the blood the law speaks of judgment but
[40:44] between the law and the congregation
[40:46] there was something for deity stood in
[40:48] its place atop of christ
[40:50] between the wrath of god the judgment in
[40:52] hell between that and the believer
[40:53] stands deity himself christ standing in
[40:56] the way with an atonement made to save
[40:59] us from our sins it wasn't bloodables it
[41:01] goes to the blood of a human man amen
[41:03] all right but it was the life in the
[41:05] blood that could come back inside of me
[41:06] and you
[41:08] to save us from our sins to heal us from
[41:09] our sicknesses deity stands in the way
[41:13] between judgment
[41:14] and what is it what is this talking
[41:16] about it's talking about our daily walk
[41:18] your daily talk your daily behavior your
[41:21] heart your soul he's talking about the
[41:22] priest going behind saying holy holy he
[41:24] had to walk a certain way because there
[41:26] was bells and pomegranates and they were
[41:27] ding ding ding all right
[41:32] as we began to approach on behalf of our
[41:33] brother in other words we're approaching
[41:34] for somebody whosoever will may come
[41:36] anointed blood in front of him
[41:41] and we know we talk about moses just for
[41:42] a minute we'll talk about just for a
[41:44] second where moses what he laid the rods
[41:46] up before the lord and then the next day
[41:48] moses went back in the tabernacle and
[41:50] guess what that old dead stick
[41:53] everybody raise your hand that will keep
[41:55] you from being asleep
[41:57] and wake the person up that don't raise
[41:58] the ham
[42:01] you're a stick
[42:04] you're a stick
[42:05] you ever heard the old saying you're
[42:06] sticking to mud
[42:08] well then
[42:11] but we're an old dead stick
[42:13] we were cut off of a tree we were
[42:16] supposed to come from the tree of life
[42:19] but we got cut off
[42:21] we got cut off like jesus did from the
[42:24] land of the living according to isaiah
[42:25] 53
[42:28] he was cut off but what did he promise
[42:30] he promised us that he would plant us
[42:32] yes
[42:33] he would plant us by the river of rivers
[42:36] of living water
[42:37] that he would put us somewhere that our
[42:39] roots would what get inside but now
[42:41] remember what happens to a tree i watch
[42:43] my big pecan trees every once in a while
[42:46] outside and you see the wind blowing and
[42:48] you can barely i mean the leaves are
[42:49] wind is doing this but that big old tree
[42:51] is just barely moving
[42:53] you know why
[42:55] you know what the prophet said why
[42:57] because what's happening is it's pulling
[42:59] them roots back and forth and what it's
[43:00] doing it's loosening the dirt up so the
[43:01] roots can go deeper
[43:03] so your trials and tribulations and your
[43:05] wind of what your wind of the devil
[43:09] all it's doing is if you're a christian
[43:11] he's already planted you if you're a
[43:13] christian he's just making you stronger
[43:16] it can't make you weaker folks
[43:20] if you're a child of god that's why i
[43:21] said you say well i've got all these
[43:22] problems make sure you're born again how
[43:24] many times am i gonna have to say that
[43:26] make sure you're born again of the
[43:27] spirit of god
[43:28] then if you have trials you know how to
[43:30] handle it
[43:35] and it came to pass it on tomorrow moses
[43:37] walked in and brought those rods out and
[43:39] there was errands and it didn't just it
[43:40] didn't just uh
[43:42] put leaves on it but
[43:43] it took a process of several months to
[43:45] make an almond it did it overnight
[43:48] that's why god said tell them shut up
[43:50] aaron's going to be your spokesman
[43:52] aaron's going to be your preacher shut
[43:54] the rest of them up this is where i'm
[43:56] going to speak i'm going to speak to
[43:57] this person right here
[43:59] i'm going to speak to william branham
[44:00] that's my almond tree rod i'm going to
[44:02] speak through him and you're going to
[44:03] hear him
[44:04] and what's going to come forth from that
[44:06] he's going to plant us he planted you in
[44:09] the message of the hour didn't he
[44:10] planted you in this church he planted
[44:11] you wherever you've been planted
[44:15] romans 6 verse 4 says therefore we are
[44:17] buried with him by baptism into death
[44:19] that like as christ was raised from the
[44:20] dead by the glory of the father even so
[44:22] we also should walk in newness of life
[44:24] for if we have been planted now here see
[44:26] planted together in the likeness of his
[44:29] death we shall be also in the likeness
[44:32] of his resurrection knowing this that
[44:34] our what old man is crucified now listen
[44:36] when they put you on a cross we read
[44:38] that we'll read it again when they put
[44:40] you on a cross it wasn't for you to come
[44:42] back out it went for joy right it wasn't
[44:44] for christmas show
[44:45] it was to die
[44:49] you died
[44:50] and most of the time they left you
[44:52] hanging there
[44:53] and you can understand what happened to
[44:55] three months later in a dry area
[44:56] condition
[44:58] what happened to your body
[45:00] but our old man that's what's got to
[45:01] happen to the devil that's what's going
[45:03] to happen to the demons that's bothering
[45:05] us we got to nail them to that cross
[45:09] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[45:13] those things are going to make you happy
[45:15] destroyed
[45:17] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[45:20] i'm tired of serving sin aren't you
[45:22] tired of serving sin even the little
[45:23] sins that we have
[45:25] as christians we sin every day
[45:29] for he that is
[45:30] dead is freed from sin
[45:34] for he that is dead
[45:37] that dead old stick
[45:40] but in god
[45:42] you need to start burning almonds
[45:45] fruits of the spirit
[45:46] right watch list this but aaron's
[45:48] rotting in there an old dead almond tree
[45:50] but as it went under the shekinah glory
[45:52] everything it was was restored again in
[45:55] other words that did grow on an almond
[45:57] tree somewhere had life in it had water
[45:59] in it had sap in it in other words and
[46:02] had the ability to become
[46:04] a
[46:05] have the green leaves and have the
[46:06] almonds but somebody
[46:08] the devil got involved and cut it down
[46:12] but
[46:13] everything it was was restored again
[46:15] that's the way a sinner is when he goes
[46:17] under the shekinah glory of the holy
[46:18] spirit
[46:19] the veil drops behind him everything
[46:21] that he ought to have been a son of god
[46:23] what blooms out in him again
[46:28] think about that
[46:30] we've had hundreds of thousands of
[46:33] of um
[46:35] we've got two big pecan trees out in the
[46:36] yard that produce
[46:38] one in the front one in the back that
[46:39] produce a lot there's no telling how
[46:41] many millions of
[46:42] pecans that thing produces every year
[46:45] it came from one
[46:47] plant
[46:49] and every once in a while bro luis you
[46:50] look out in the yard and you go that's
[46:51] not grass an old squirrel has went out
[46:54] there and dug him a hole stuck him up
[46:57] stuck him a pecan nut down in the ground
[46:59] and forgot it
[47:02] or either the dogs run it off or killed
[47:03] it or something but
[47:05] and then what does it happen it starts
[47:06] growing
[47:07] well every pecan that'll ever be on that
[47:10] tree is inside of that fruit that's why
[47:12] jesus said unless a corn of wheat be put
[47:15] in the ground
[47:17] and die
[47:18] it'll bite us alone
[47:20] but if it's planted it brings forth what
[47:23] much fruit
[47:24] much fruit
[47:26] so look remember overnight it budded
[47:28] blossomed and grown almost on it fruits
[47:30] of the spirit love joy long suffering
[47:31] goodness gentleness patience that's what
[47:33] we need to get in that third step get
[47:35] over into the shekinah glory where that
[47:37] little sacred light was hanging over the
[47:40] mercy seat why are my people so tossed
[47:41] about they took aaron's rod and laid
[47:43] aaron's rod in the presence of this holy
[47:45] place and when they did and one night's
[47:47] time it budded blossom and yielded
[47:49] almonds so don't tell me god can't do a
[47:50] work in your life overnight
[47:53] amen
[47:55] don't tell me god can't do a work in
[47:56] your life overnight
[47:58] he can and he will if you let's ask him
[48:00] to
[48:00] and one night's time think of it in the
[48:02] presence of god this old dead rod lying
[48:04] there in the presence of god but it
[48:06] blossomed yielded almonds and one night
[48:08] what was it then what kind of rod was it
[48:10] it was an almond tree rod that's what
[48:12] he'd taken it from the stick was off of
[48:13] an almond rod and you are a stick of
[48:16] some kind
[48:18] and you were taken off the branch of
[48:19] humanity
[48:21] which was god created son in the
[48:22] beginning
[48:23] you may be fallen dead alienated from
[48:26] god but by that in creation you were
[48:28] created to be a son of god
[48:30] you may bounce around and be respected
[48:32] and honored in other words out in the
[48:34] world
[48:35] but if you ever get into that glorious
[48:37] place and hide away with god you'll
[48:38] yield
[48:39] what you're supposed to do
[48:42] i'm telling you
[48:43] this is manifest in time we've seen that
[48:45] song manifest in time manifest time
[48:47] you're going to manifest what you've got
[48:49] inside of you
[48:51] can't hide it no more
[48:53] it will manifest itself and it is i mean
[48:55] it's just continuing to manifest itself
[48:58] and the only person that can do anything
[48:59] about is you like i said before you
[49:01] can't blame brother dale for not making
[49:02] it you are the one that will not make it
[49:05] if you don't make it all right
[49:07] so let's just put that finger back on us
[49:09] now every year the high priest entered
[49:11] into that place the congregation
[49:12] followed him up and when he went into
[49:14] this great place where the veil dropped
[49:15] behind him the inner courts the holiest
[49:17] of holies no one dared to go in after
[49:19] him he was alone with god
[49:21] what a beautiful picture it is today of
[49:23] a consecrated life who once enters into
[49:26] the with christ
[49:28] dead to the things of the world hid away
[49:30] with god and the veils dropped down
[49:32] around all the world shut off
[49:35] look then christianity and religion
[49:37] becomes a pleasure
[49:40] becomes a pleasure to every believer
[49:45] if it's drudgery and not a pleasure to
[49:47] come to church you need to get how many
[49:49] times i need to say that you need to get
[49:51] born again
[49:53] yeah but i
[49:55] talked to god i'm telling you what he
[49:56] said
[50:02] that's why if you'll read that book that
[50:04] brother dale preached a long time ago
[50:05] about the hidden life in christ if you
[50:07] read that book
[50:08] why my people are so tossed about he'll
[50:10] tell you why are you so tossed about
[50:12] he'll tell you what we're so tossed
[50:14] about
[50:17] christianity and religion becomes a
[50:19] pleasure
[50:20] to every believer
[50:22] you don't feel uncomfortable to go to
[50:24] church if you feel uncomfortable today
[50:26] get born again
[50:29] i used to feel uncomfortable mama called

[50:45] why i wasn't born again now you can't
[50:48] get me out of this place
[50:50] if it weren't for brother anderson i'd
[50:52] be the first one here a lot of times so
[50:54] what brother now for years and years and
[50:55] years and years and years and years
[50:57] and years he was the first one here

[51:02] becomes a pleasure

[53:24] that's why folks is listen it's only
[53:26] human nature let's just talk for men is
[53:28] that okay
[53:29] it's only human nature that when 9 11
[53:32] happened what happened
[53:34] church
[53:35] churches filled up
[53:38] they had a day of prayer
[53:41] and you're not even supposed to be
[53:42] praying in school
[53:44] they had a national
[53:46] day of prayer
[53:47] because three thousand some people got
[53:49] killed i understand that and i they're
[53:51] human they were they had a family
[53:53] but then now what's happened 20
[53:55] something years later
[53:58] those same churches that were full or
[53:59] empty
[54:03] let me give you another example this
[54:05] one's going to hit home and i hope it
[54:06] does
[54:08] a year ago when brother dale had a
[54:09] stroke standing in this pulpit
[54:12] a lot of people feel the church spews up
[54:14] after that
[54:16] they ain't here no more
[54:19] what'd they get an emotion
[54:22] they got an emotion they just gotta well
[54:24] i need to do something
[54:27] i hope you're quiet i hope that hit home
[54:31] listen white wait to a disaster happens
[54:35] to get in church
[54:37] why wait till a disaster happens to try
[54:39] to get right
[54:41] it's much easier to be right now and you
[54:43] say well praise god
[54:45] whatever happens happens
[54:48] everything's all right everything works
[54:49] for the good of them that love the lord
[54:51] we appreciate that
[54:54] but today people have enough religion
[54:56] just to make them miserable
[54:58] they're trying to escape hell
[55:01] how about a prophet of god standing one
[55:02] day and he said
[55:03] if i walk by
[55:05] the lord and he sends me to hell he said
[55:08] i'll look at him and say i love you
[55:10] anyway can you do that
[55:12] can you do that
[55:14] i love you anyway
[55:16] now we know for a fact if he said that
[55:18] brother larry he's going to heaven he
[55:20] ain't going to hell
[55:22] because he loved god so much
[55:24] didn't love god because now see because
[55:26] see you'll get under conviction and and
[55:30] here we go again i'm just going to head
[55:31] home
[55:32] we start all of our preachers start
[55:34] preaching that you need to come to
[55:35] church well more people start coming to
[55:36] church
[55:37] now that now that they've come eight or
[55:39] ten services they just start dwindling
[55:42] off
[55:43] why are my people so tossed about
[55:52] stable
[55:54] well if that's the way i felt about it
[55:56] brother i don't know what i would do
[55:59] oh get in with christ shut off from the
[56:01] things of the world to commune with him
[56:04] is a pleasure
[56:06] it's something that fills and satisfies
[56:08] your soul do you remember in the world
[56:10] what satisfied your soul
[56:12] drinking alcohol watching movies going
[56:15] out partying yeah
[56:18] that's what was inside of us
[56:20] but now that we have god inside of us
[56:22] that same emotion
[56:25] that same feeling you had for the world
[56:28] my heavens it ought to be a million
[56:30] times more for something eternal
[56:34] it ought to be something that satisfies
[56:36] your soul now listen it didn't same
[56:38] memory reason conscious affects your
[56:39] imagination
[56:42] because i feel a little rough right now
[56:43] okay everybody feels a little rough i
[56:46] got a little smacking on my head and
[56:47] somebody's preaching unsmacked my toes
[56:49] and then step on my toes
[56:53] i don't see how in the world you can
[56:55] read that hand right
[56:57] she writes in letters about like that
[56:58] she handed it to me yet last night i i
[57:01] read it though but it was hard
[57:03] write a little bigger
[57:05] but get into christ
[57:07] it's beautiful
[57:09] it's something that fills and satisfies
[57:12] your soul
[57:14] something that gives you peace that
[57:16] passes all understanding
[57:20] all the crosses become
[57:22] wings
[57:28] all the burdens
[57:30] are chariot wheels
[57:32] thanks god
[57:34] if you look at it that way brother
[57:35] johnny we're having a pretty good day
[57:39] all the burdens of chariot wheels oh you
[57:40] can fly away
[57:42] now he can let that spirit grow now look
[57:45] he can let that spirit grow and take all
[57:48] the roots of bitterness
[57:49] grow
[57:50] that's what we're talking about growing
[57:52] grow and take out all the root of
[57:54] bitterness and press god's way through
[57:56] him again
[57:58] he can become back in the same condition
[58:02] wow
[58:04] that he was when he was in the garden of
[58:06] eden you remember what happened in the
[58:08] garden after adam sinned
[58:11] he didn't want to go to church no more
[58:14] he didn't want to come in with god face
[58:16] to face anymore why he was ashamed
[58:18] he said i fear
[58:20] so they had to go back in the bushes and
[58:21] hide yes
[58:23] where where whatever before time
[58:25] millenniums before that brother john god
[58:27] would come down to cool today and said
[58:28] hey adam how you doing son you doing
[58:30] okay everything all right we good and
[58:32] adam's going we're good
[58:34] me and eve were one we're loving it
[58:36] we're enjoying all the fruits of the
[58:38] tree now we're not eating on that one
[58:39] you said not to eat us
[58:42] but his wife didn't get that revelation
[58:45] so when she did they did what they did
[58:47] remember he sold us out she didn't
[58:52] amen
[58:53] he sold us out
[58:55] right
[58:59] but he said you get you back in the same
[59:00] condition
[59:02] he was
[59:03] in the garden of eden
[59:05] how are we going to get an eden back
[59:06] here if we don't bring some of it with
[59:08] us already
[59:10] jesus said that mark 11 24
[59:13] statue of a perfect man
[59:15] now we put the blood of jesus christ in
[59:17] see and that brings the faith of jesus
[59:18] christ the virtue of jesus christ the
[59:21] knowledge of jesus christ not wade
[59:22] dale's knowledge
[59:24] not bob black or whoever
[59:27] the temperance of jesus christ not mine
[59:29] not yours
[59:30] his
[59:31] the patience of jesus christ the
[59:33] godliness of jesus christ the
[59:34] brotherhood brother the kindness of
[59:36] jesus christ listen these are these are
[59:38] heirs and joint heirs this is what he
[59:40] got
[59:41] so now he's giving it to us yes we're
[59:43] heirs and joint heirs according to
[59:44] romans 8 i read that to you heirs and
[59:46] join airs with christ
[59:48] that's the nature of christ
[59:51] there you are there is the perfect man
[59:54] of god when he possesses
[59:56] these virtues and now that's the chart
[59:58] we're looking at we not even got to the
[59:59] son of man anymore we're back down here
[1:00:01] in the son of god
[1:00:03] where the disciples were we're down here
[1:00:05] where
[1:00:07] the first three church ages
[1:00:09] had these virtues working in their life
[1:00:12] they had everything common
[1:00:15] but there was people crept in
[1:00:18] and started tearing the word of god up
[1:00:21] started putting their own ideas jesus
[1:00:22] said your own traditions you've made the
[1:00:24] word of god of no effect to the people
[1:00:27] but now we're right down here right
[1:00:28] where it says
[1:00:29] new birth justification sanctification
[1:00:31] the baptism of the holy ghost all right
[1:00:33] then that's before we got two wings
[1:00:35] tonight
[1:00:36] there's three types of crosses there's
[1:00:37] an enemy of a cross there's people that
[1:00:39] get to the cross and then there's people
[1:00:40] that carry the cross all right now jesus
[1:00:43] is the one that carried his cross one
[1:00:44] time
[1:00:46] he didn't have to carry it again he
[1:00:47] carried it one time he died once for all
[1:00:50] that's right amen so then there's
[1:00:52] enemies of the cross that they just
[1:00:54] don't even like the cross at all they
[1:00:56] don't care anything about religion or
[1:00:57] anything about uh worshiping god they
[1:01:00] worship their own god
[1:01:02] but and we'll read that where the bible
[1:01:04] tells us about enemies of the cross and
[1:01:06] then like i said wednesday there's
[1:01:07] people that get to the cross and they
[1:01:09] say god forgive me in my sins i am so
[1:01:10] sorry for what i did look at the thief
[1:01:12] on the cross remember listen the thief
[1:01:14] on the cross never asked jesus to
[1:01:16] forgive his sins
[1:01:21] the thief on the cross never asked jesus
[1:01:24] to forgive him of his sins he said will
[1:01:27] you remember me
[1:01:30] when you come into your kingdom
[1:01:34] will you just remember me
[1:01:36] it humbled that man so much and jesus
[1:01:38] turned around he said this day
[1:01:40] in other words i'm going to die and then
[1:01:42] you're going to die
[1:01:44] because he died first and they broke his
[1:01:45] leg and he died he said you'll be with
[1:01:47] me in paradise in other words he stepped
[1:01:48] over into paradise and like i said
[1:01:50] before he's one he's one of the ones
[1:01:51] that stayed there just a very small
[1:01:53] amount of time because remember paradise
[1:01:55] was emptied out when jesus came back
[1:01:57] but he made it
[1:01:59] remember me just remember me lord
[1:02:02] but you and i have an opportunity to say
[1:02:04] forgive me lord and then he won't put
[1:02:07] you in paradise he'll put you in the
[1:02:08] sixth dimension and then we'll go to the
[1:02:10] future home that makes bride yes sir
[1:02:13] brad don't just get to the cross they
[1:02:15] carry their own cross
[1:02:19] the cross was made out of wood overlaid
[1:02:20] with gold deity jesus hung on a cross
[1:02:23] there was wood behind him deity and then
[1:02:26] the people he stood in the way he stood
[1:02:28] the judgment
[1:02:30] oh if that don't make you happy then
[1:02:32] y'all don't need to get born again
[1:02:34] based on roman literature as well as
[1:02:36] descriptions in the province's
[1:02:37] crucifixion was an established routine
[1:02:39] they were special military teams led by
[1:02:41] centurion and then the provinces the
[1:02:43] soldiers were selected from local
[1:02:45] auxiliaries
[1:02:46] natives who had joined the roman army
[1:02:48] the victim was stripped and then lashed
[1:02:50] or scourged as part of the public
[1:02:51] humiliation as i said before not in this
[1:02:54] article but another article if you'll
[1:02:56] remember what i was telling you and it
[1:02:57] makes sense if if brother darty you're
[1:03:00] sitting there and i'm picking on you if
[1:03:02] brother doherty was a murderer and he
[1:03:03] killed somebody like barabbas
[1:03:06] that's not going to incite a riot
[1:03:08] he just killed another man we'll just do
[1:03:09] away with him but oh when somebody
[1:03:12] stands up and said
[1:03:14] destroy this temple
[1:03:16] i'll raise it up
[1:03:18] then he gets a rally around him he gets
[1:03:20] some people around him then you get the
[1:03:22] political guy that stands up and says
[1:03:23] follow me i'll make everything right
[1:03:26] yeah right
[1:03:29] that's who they killed they wanted to
[1:03:31] publicly humiliate those people to keep
[1:03:34] other people from saying oh we'll follow
[1:03:37] him
[1:03:38] no they're going to throw him on the
[1:03:39] cross and then we're going to forget him
[1:03:42] so it's part of the public humiliation
[1:03:44] he or she was led through the streets
[1:03:45] and remained naked christian art
[1:03:47] portrays jesus with a decent lawn cloth
[1:03:49] on the cross but the nakedness was
[1:03:50] maintained as a part of his humiliation
[1:03:53] there was a public plaque remember there
[1:03:55] was a plaque put over him by
[1:03:56] by uh who was the pilot the shedding of
[1:03:59] blood and the concept of corpse
[1:04:00] contamination meant that the execution
[1:04:02] took place outside the city walls the
[1:04:04] most popular spot was along one of the
[1:04:06] main roads leading into the city they
[1:04:08] also served as propaganda purposes to
[1:04:10] demonstrate roman law and order now look
[1:04:12] the victim did not carry the whole cross
[1:04:15] and that's true because that cross
[1:04:17] weighed almost 400 pounds
[1:04:19] big beam i mean had to hold the weight
[1:04:21] of a 200 pound man
[1:04:23] but they carried the crossbeam
[1:04:27] the pole was already in the ground
[1:04:30] but they carried the crossbeam which
[1:04:32] there's our first beam
[1:04:34] so we're talking about winning tonight i
[1:04:36] hope you got that that's there's your
[1:04:37] beam faith you got to have that you got
[1:04:39] to carry it
[1:04:41] take up your cross
[1:04:42] and follow jesus what take up your cross
[1:04:45] every day
[1:04:46] all right
[1:04:47] by the baptism of the holy ghost we
[1:04:49] don't just come to the cross we pick up
[1:04:51] our cross
[1:04:52] and we follow him and we don't pick up
[1:04:54] his cross
[1:04:56] we don't have to die
[1:04:58] he died already
[1:05:00] now we know what all this other was was
[1:05:03] that's why the
[1:05:04] assignment of cyrene picked up
[1:05:07] the beam of jesus and carried him
[1:05:09] and then the victim was either tied or
[1:05:11] nailed to the cross we know jesus was
[1:05:12] nailed to the cross because
[1:05:15] he showed nail prints in his hands
[1:05:17] so now philippians 3 verse 18. we'll
[1:05:19] stop we'll stop right here for many walk
[1:05:21] of whom i have told you often and now
[1:05:23] tell you even weeping look weeping
[1:05:26] paul was serious that they are the
[1:05:27] enemies of the cross of christ who so
[1:05:30] end is destruction whose god is their
[1:05:32] belly
[1:05:33] and whose glory is in their shame who
[1:05:35] mind
[1:05:37] earthly
[1:05:38] things
[1:05:40] wow
[1:05:41] colossians 2 verse 14 says blotting out
[1:05:43] the handwriting of ordinances that was
[1:05:44] against us which was contrary to us and
[1:05:48] took it out of the way nailing it what
[1:05:51] nailing that gold to the cross
[1:05:54] nailing deity dedicated unto death
[1:05:58] nailing him to the cross showed that we
[1:06:00] were forgiven
[1:06:03] wow
[1:06:04] first corinthians 1 17 for christ sent
[1:06:06] me not to baptize but to preach the
[1:06:08] gospel not with wisdom of words lest the
[1:06:11] cross of christ should be made of none
[1:06:13] effect that's what the people done
[1:06:15] that's why brother branham that's why
[1:06:17] paul's talking here and brother brown
[1:06:19] stands in this age and he turns and he
[1:06:21] points and he says i indict this
[1:06:22] generation
[1:06:24] for the second crucifixion of jesus
[1:06:26] christ they put him back on the cross
[1:06:28] and put him to an open shame
[1:06:30] for the preaching of the cross is to
[1:06:31] them that perish foolishly but unto us
[1:06:34] which are saved it is the power of god
[1:06:37] amen matthew 10 verse 37 he that loveth
[1:06:40] father and mother more than me everybody
[1:06:41] go
[1:06:43] he that loveth father and mother more
[1:06:45] than me is not worthy
[1:06:47] of me
[1:06:51] i was talking to somebody the other day
[1:06:54] i told him i said
[1:06:55] and i preached it from the pulpit so his
[1:06:57] brother dale

[1:07:02] your wayward family or your wife or
[1:07:05] somebody that's not a believer are
[1:07:06] watching you

[1:07:09] they're gonna do they're gonna say oh
[1:07:11] okay
[1:07:12] they really just don't have what they
[1:07:14] what they think they have
[1:07:16] and believe you me
[1:07:20] if your kids live out of town they gonna
[1:07:22] get there on saturday night or they
[1:07:23] gonna fly in on sunday morning so you
[1:07:25] can go pick them up hello somebody just
[1:07:27] don't get quiet on me
[1:07:31] i tell them to take an uber i'm not
[1:07:32] going to get them on sunday i'm coming
[1:07:34] to church would you no it's my cuz i
[1:07:36] haven't seen my baby in so long
[1:07:40] they're watching you to see what you'll
[1:07:42] do
[1:07:44] how many times the brother dale told us
[1:07:46] that 50 years he said your
[1:07:49] kids are watching you
[1:07:53] and it happens all the
[1:07:54] time happens all the time well my kids
[1:07:57] are coming in town this weekend this
[1:07:58] weekend why can't they get here on
[1:08:00] friday and leave on sunday jim's dad
[1:08:02] used to do that so much
[1:08:04] what'd we tell him it's okay gene you
[1:08:06] can come whenever you want to but sunday
[1:08:07] you'll be there by yourself or you can
[1:08:09] come go to church with us
[1:08:11] and he'd come to church most of the time
[1:08:12] but he would sit at home sometime
[1:08:13] because i'm not compromising
[1:08:16] because it you know in his mind he's
[1:08:17] going well
[1:08:20] is he or is he not
[1:08:22] is he or is he not
[1:08:28] he that loveth father mother more than
[1:08:30] me is not worthy i'm reading bible this
[1:08:34] is red letter i didn't make this it's
[1:08:35] red letter that comes out of the king
[1:08:37] james version okay
[1:08:39] it's not worthy of me and he that loveth
[1:08:41] son or daughter more than me
[1:08:44] is not worthy of me
[1:08:47] i told my kids josh is not here they're
[1:08:48] on vacation over actually they're over
[1:08:51] jim's dad's house
[1:08:53] but i told my kids i said look i love
[1:08:55] you i'll take a bullet for you i'll die
[1:08:57] for you
[1:08:58] but i'm not compromising my religion
[1:09:02] not for you
[1:09:03] ain't gonna happen
[1:09:05] because this scripture right here and
[1:09:06] what inside of me tells me this is my
[1:09:08] first obligation
[1:09:09] all right
[1:09:12] more than me is not worthy of me and he
[1:09:14] that taketh not his cross
[1:09:17] his cross
[1:09:18] and followeth after me
[1:09:21] is not worthy of me
[1:09:23] he that findeth his life shall lose it
[1:09:26] and he that loses his life for my sake
[1:09:30] shall find it
[1:09:31] matthew 16 says then jesus said unto his
[1:09:33] disciples holy this is jesus talking
[1:09:35] okay hold up everybody
[1:09:37] if any man will come after me let him
[1:09:39] deny himself
[1:09:41] and take up his cross
[1:09:43] and follow me for whosoever shall save
[1:09:45] his life shall lose it who's referred i
[1:09:47] lose shall
[1:09:48] for my sake shall find it mark 8 34 he
[1:09:52] called his people together with his
[1:09:53] disciples he said unto them whoso will
[1:09:55] come after me let him deny himself and
[1:09:57] take up his cross and follow me now this
[1:09:59] is one i like luke brings it in just
[1:10:01] really
[1:10:03] really
[1:10:05] daily
[1:10:08] and he's saying to them all if any man
[1:10:10] will come after me let him deny himself
[1:10:12] and take up his cross

[1:10:38] and listen there's something in all our
[1:10:39] lives that we can't get rid of
[1:10:41] am i in the wrong church there's things
[1:10:44] that we have that just bothers us all
[1:10:46] the time
[1:10:47] work on them
[1:10:49] give them to god
[1:10:51] whosoever does not bear his cross
[1:10:54] and come after me cannot be
[1:10:56] my disciple
[1:10:58] we'll start i think i got
[1:11:01] let me read this right here
[1:11:05] i'm gonna read this and i'll come back
[1:11:06] and read it this afternoon let's stand
[1:11:07] our feed blasphemous names brother brown
[1:11:09] says look
[1:11:10] so now you say brother brother do we
[1:11:12] should we speak with tongues absolutely
[1:11:14] now he's talking on the statue of
[1:11:15] perfect man because he preached famous
[1:11:17] names a week later
[1:11:18] but he basically preaches the whole
[1:11:20] sermon about the statue of perfect man a
[1:11:22] little bit about black famous names he's
[1:11:24] he's reiterating what he said that's
[1:11:26] gifts of god what speaking in tongues
[1:11:28] we're not talking about speaking in
[1:11:29] tongues in this there's not that on
[1:11:31] there
[1:11:33] right
[1:11:34] that's gifts of god but those gifts of
[1:11:37] god
[1:11:39] they're speaking in tongues without
[1:11:41] these virtues in them
[1:11:44] makes a stumble block to the unbeliever
[1:11:47] look it's not accepted by god
[1:11:50] now do we want anything that's not
[1:11:51] accepted by god
[1:11:53] no we do not
[1:11:55] this has to be first what this
[1:11:58] and when you have faith virtue knowledge
[1:11:59] tempers faces guidelines and brotherly
[1:12:01] love then the holy ghost comes down and
[1:12:03] what seals you as a unit
[1:12:06] we'll get into that a little bit later
[1:12:08] the same as he seals the church ages as
[1:12:10] a unit the way he makes his bride is the
[1:12:13] way he makes his individual
[1:12:15] made out of the same material like eve
[1:12:17] was made out of adam a rip from his side
[1:12:20] here is the thing that you have to have
[1:12:22] first
[1:12:23] you can't impersonate them
[1:12:26] you can't imitate them
[1:12:29] you've got to be god sent and god born
[1:12:32] look imitation only causes confusion
[1:12:38] you know why you act one way here and
[1:12:40] then you act another way somewhere else
[1:12:43] that virtue doesn't follow you out that
[1:12:45] door
[1:12:46] you pretend here and then you lose it
[1:12:48] out there
[1:12:49] wow wow wow wow
[1:12:53] listen i'm gonna read this one more then
[1:12:54] we'll sing a song
[1:12:56] if what is purposed to the church
[1:12:59] the life that was in christ isn't
[1:13:01] reflecting in you
[1:13:03] don't you stand still if you haven't got
[1:13:05] patience virtue and all these things
[1:13:07] temperance and these things and
[1:13:08] godliness brother kindness and all these
[1:13:10] things that's what
[1:13:12] required
[1:13:14] of you
[1:13:16] required and i'm going to read three
[1:13:17] more quotes this afternoon where brother
[1:13:18] brown says this is god's requirement is
[1:13:21] to have these virtues to be now does not
[1:13:24] look you say well am i i'm i'm i can i
[1:13:26] be a child of god and i'll have the
[1:13:27] virtues yes
[1:13:31] justification sanitification back to the
[1:13:33] holy ghost put you right here at face
[1:13:35] you may have parts of these but you're
[1:13:36] not going to be what god's not going to
[1:13:38] let a baby drive his car
[1:13:42] you got to be a fully matured adult
[1:13:43] before you can drive a car
[1:13:45] so god's not going to give you the word
[1:13:47] of god because look i will read this
[1:13:49] later on where brother brown says power
[1:13:51] without character listen you have that
[1:13:53] dunamis power when you're born again but
[1:13:56] you can't let it all out because you
[1:13:57] don't know how to use it
[1:14:00] but once you get these virtues you know
[1:14:02] how to use it in other words zapping
[1:14:04] your boss out of existence you pray for
[1:14:05] him that's right or her
[1:14:09] these things that's required
[1:14:12] of you let's sing a song god bless you
[1:14:17] we find many people who can't understand
[1:14:22] why i am so happy and free
[1:14:28] for jordan to canaan's fatherland and
[1:14:32] this is like heaven to me
[1:14:36] heavenly places
[1:14:39] heavenly
[1:14:40] places do you feel comfortable talking
[1:14:43] about god
[1:14:45] do you feel comfortable coming to church
[1:14:48] do you feel comfortable
[1:14:51] witnessing to people
[1:14:54] if you don't feel comfortable then you
[1:14:55] need to get the comforter inside of you
[1:15:03] i see
[1:15:06] but i'm filled with the spirit there
[1:15:09] isn't a doubt
[1:15:11] and that's what's the matter with me
[1:15:15] oh this is like heaven to me
[1:15:20] oh this is like heaven to me
[1:15:25] i've crossed over jordan to canaan's
[1:15:28] fatherland and this is like heaven to me
[1:15:35] this is like heaven to me and by heaven
[1:15:39] oh this is like heaven to me
[1:15:44] i've crossed over jordan to cadence fire
[1:15:48] land and this is like heaven to me
[1:15:53] can you say today
[1:15:55] that ain't nothing but the truth
[1:15:58] i've tried to tell you the truth this
[1:16:00] ain't nothing but the truth it's what
[1:16:01] god's already said it's not something he
[1:16:03] developed it's not something brother
[1:16:05] brown came and brought us a new bible
[1:16:07] no he came to magnify the bible is
[1:16:09] already here
[1:16:12] and to tell us why all these pieces have
[1:16:14] to fit together
[1:16:16] nobody down through the ages luther
[1:16:18] wesley and even pentecost ever i'm sure
[1:16:21] they preached on ii peter but they
[1:16:23] didn't know how to get virtue
[1:16:25] they just said peter said to get it
[1:16:27] but when brother rhino comes and tells
[1:16:29] us look that virtue is not being a
[1:16:31] virgin
[1:16:32] that virtue is having the power of god
[1:16:35] inside of you to be able to give it to
[1:16:37] somebody else
[1:16:40] that's virtue that strength like i said
[1:16:42] before if i'm sick sure i pray to god
[1:16:45] but if i'm sick i call brother dale i
[1:16:47] don't call the neighbor they're gay
[1:16:50] sorry
[1:16:52] would you no i call somebody's men to
[1:16:54] the fountain
[1:16:56] i call somebody i got confidence in that
[1:16:58] i know that i can draw strength from him
[1:17:01] that's what each and every one of us
[1:17:03] i draw strength from brother ryan
[1:17:05] standing up here preaching the word of
[1:17:06] god and all the different ones sunday
[1:17:08] school teacher you should draw strength
[1:17:10] off of that
[1:17:12] folks if this is a drudgery you need to
[1:17:15] get born again or quit
[1:17:17] one of the two if you hang around you're
[1:17:20] gonna drown like the millions and
[1:17:22] billions drowned in the days of noah
[1:17:24] i'll promise you that pitch had a lot of
[1:17:27] fingernails on it as that water kept
[1:17:29] getting higher and higher because
[1:17:32] brother brown said i read it last night
[1:17:35] they hung around the door
[1:17:40] well i wonder
[1:17:43] and then guess what one day
[1:17:46] noah didn't shut the door
[1:17:49] god shut the door
[1:17:51] noah was probably on the inside saying
[1:17:53] lord
[1:17:54] it's not raining one more day give me
[1:17:57] just one more day god said i've given
[1:17:59] 120 years
[1:18:01] as i told you all the other day sister
[1:18:02] gail may heard me she's always said
[1:18:04] guard's arm is long it is but it's got
[1:18:05] an end to it amen
[1:18:08] you might be filthy rich but there's a
[1:18:09] bottom of that barrel
[1:18:11] amen
[1:18:12] so god's arm's long no doubt he's got a
[1:18:14] lot of grace in it but there's the time
[1:18:15] when he said that's enough i'm done with
[1:18:17] it so god shut the door did it rain the
[1:18:19] first day knew it it rained the second
[1:18:21] day no
[1:18:22] rain the third day no fourth day
[1:18:26] he said miss noah come up and said honey
[1:18:28] are you it will rain
[1:18:31] he said how do you know he
[1:18:33] he said cause god said so
[1:18:37] seven days they stayed in that ark but
[1:18:39] you know what on that seventh day
[1:18:41] brother brown said out in the distance
[1:18:43] there came a cloud
[1:18:46] that never been there before
[1:18:48] and that cloud started swirling
[1:18:50] he said it started pouring down rain
[1:18:52] and he said then people knew on the
[1:18:54] outside of that boat
[1:18:56] what was fixing to happen
[1:18:57] because they had been told 120 years
[1:19:00] that it was going to rain and flood the
[1:19:02] earth with water this bower heads

[1:19:21] minute sermon
[1:19:22] and they were pricked in their hearts
[1:19:23] and they said many brethren what must we
[1:19:25] do to be saved
[1:19:27] peter said repent
[1:19:29] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:19:30] christ for the remission of your sins
[1:19:32] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:19:33] holy ghost and right there 3 000
