TRANSCRIPT
========================================
jim just said allen anna was downstairs so god bless them good to have out sister sister ann and brother al willis watching in downstairs that is wonderful that's good so if you would we're going to start on continue on grace today i was going um finish this up anyway today on on grace grace and then we'll let under current situation let bob start doing sunday school next start next sunday and brother richard height will be with us next sunday to do our services but brother bob will be doing the sunday school class um in the morning so if you would let's start talking again about grace and i was thinking yesterday grace was only mentioned a few times in the old testament just very few times because according to man there was not any grace in the new in the old testament according to what they saw now there was grace all the way from that when adam did what he did and eve did what she did that we know there was grace way before but god gave him the law and then brother brown you know he preached the sermon taking law for they took law should have took grace but they took law they took the law and what did the law do the law condemned you the law put you in jail the law said if you do this don't do that if you were caught committing adultery you got stoned and you were killed there was no uh court of appeal there was no because the law said you know remember the guy that picked up sticks on on the sabbath just picked up sticks and they stoned him god said stone him he's he's he's doing something on the sabbath day so there wasn't a lot of grace to that but now we know what who brought grace jesus christ is the only person that can bring grace and have grace for the people so that's where we're gonna if you would let's look at the uh the two definitions of uh of grace number one in the hebrew lexicon it's favor or as i was saying last sunday now listen god is not a respecter of persons but he does have his favorites he has his favorites because he sees a bride that's going to do what he says so according to that we have found favor as we saw that noah found grace our favor in the eyes of the lord and we also know that the world you know the world calls it grace when you walk down the aisle gracefully and you're you're flowing and elegant and all that so we're not going to worry about that we're just going to worry about the one in the bible where it is favor and then we see that the definition of grace in the uh webster's dictionary is where brother branham talks about unmerited now look divine assistance because i don't care how perfect you are and how perfect i am you still have your favorites and you lean towards your favoritism you show favoritism i don't care it doesn't matter who you are all right just admit it we we do show favoritism and the way god shows favoritism though is by grace by grace he saw a group of people and by election or go back to for knowledge he knew that there would be a group of people that he was going to have to give grace for but they would stay under that that's why the prophet god says we are now misgrace amen if we stay under that then we are fine but if we get out from under that then we'll miss disgrace because there is disgrace that we're not going to talk about we going to talk about grace all right but it's unmerited so and i'm going to read the scripture here because there's always the contention or the warring of the james says it's by works and paul says it's by faith or by grace and then you know you look at and brother branham took a prophet come works is what faith expressed so he put both scriptures together and made it work made it just a beautiful picture works is faith expressed well that's what james was really trying to say he wasn't trying to say it's just by works and paul wasn't saying it's just by grace it's by both because under grace you will do you came to church this morning under grace amen you came to church under grace unmerited divine look assistance see in the old testament like the prophet of god said he said i thought jehovah hated me and god love or yeah all right and jesus loved me said found out they was the same people and what he was talking about is is they were under the law in the old testament but they were under grace in the new testament that we see now like i said before don't forget grace wasn't developed in the new testament grace was before the foundation of the world when god saw you and me down here doing what we're doing there had to be grace already there or we would have not made it to here's everybody got that we would not have made it here without grace that's why that god give a grace of marriage and divorce he give a grace not only of human marriage and divorce but spiritual marriage and divorce that you and i were married to the wrong person and then by grace we were married to christ but our old husband had to be dead we couldn't have a living husband or we couldn't be married to christ amen so unmerited divine assistance given to humans for their regeneration or sanctification i like this one a virtue coming from god so it didn't come from man like i said before as as close as we can get to being impartial we're still partial because we got family we got situations blood's thicker than water you know you go through all that things and you know my family before yours okay but we see though that under christianity though because of the brotherly kindness that we haven't got to because of brotherly kindness though you look at you've got to extend grace back just like jesus did that's right right regardless of what you think about who's your favorite preacher and who's your favorite person who's your favorite this if you're under brotherly kindness it's supposed to be just like this that's right right exactly right no big eyes no little use no i'm going to prefer this one over this one or that one over that one i was reading last night in the conduct order and doctrine book brother brown was talking about if you have a true pastor he's a he's a servant he's not a master or an overlord or or someone that beats you to death and you know brother dale's been a servant he's given his self amen he's give himself you know what so that you can make it right not so much that we can make it that you can make it right it's pretty profound see that's a true that's a true preacher that's a true servant not to put your you know let god put you up here right right if god puts you up here no man can take you down but you put yourself up here first person is going to take you down as god that's that's the first person that's going to take you down is god amen right right all right so let's get on with that because that's another another subject a state of sanctification enjoyed through divine see how many times it says divine so it has to come from god grace has to be developed from god is god and will always be god because look even when we leave here where does the grace go that we're here where does that grace go to it goes to the jews to take out 144 000 according to the bible not 150 or 244 000 according to the bible grace is extended to them and then grace leaves the earth we'll talk about that this afternoon because that's when the battle of armageddon happens it's when grace is gone from the earth there is no grace left even for the foolish virgin they're going to be given eternal life grace is going to be extended back or into the um to the i was i tell you what folks i was something was on youtube and it showed them it was mount carmel baptist church we were talk we've been talking about doctrines i'll stop here just a minute but it's mount carmel it's not the one down here i thought it was so i was going to see what the little pastor were talking about but it's mount carmel up here in denver's well this guy is preaching i'm talking about grace for us now because he's standing behind a pulpit he's a baptist preacher and he's talking about things that can be discussed and things that can't be discussed he said you cannot discus the trinity is not discussable it's a fact he went over here just like this he said now what he was talking about was speaking in tongues and the gifts he said those can be debatable that's what he said debatable he said in other words he looked did this right and he said it's not debatable every one of you are going to stand before the white throne judgment wow that's their doctrine that's what they're built i'm telling you i tell you this in the sermon brother they've been telling you for years just go listen that's exactly what they build their doctrine on they're gonna have to stand before the white grown judgment and give an account of everything he said right right that's right then he said now now the tongues and interpretations and prophets that's debatable but the trinity is not debatable and you got to go see what i mean not debatable maybe not to them but but to us see it's great grace grace grace grace give to us we know it's false we know it's not true there's no truth to what he's saying here and there's no truth to what he's saying here so i'm telling you that there's only the grace extended now listen there is grace for them maybe at the whites on judgment right but when he stands and denies the word of god what's he going to take to the white throne judgment lord lord have i not and see he even brought that scripture in talking about prophets he even read that exact scripture he said lord lord have i not prophesied have i not done these great mighty things he said depart for me i never knew you he even read that scripture itself grace folks grace it's grace to know this message of the hour not just know it but to live it it's grace and look approval right we have been approved noah was approved and found grace under the old testament moses found grace and god actually did what moses said moses said if you're gonna kill them you're gonna have to kill me amen portraying christ are part of grace but remember that was looking toward mr grace that was coming and then now that mr grace come jesus christ there is a misgrace which is us that's right because in zechariah 4 as as somebody was talking about the other night it's going to be double grace grace grace unto it because it's going to be grace listen it's grace that you got the new birth that god came to give you the new birth not the birth like they have out there but a new birth according to malachi 4 according to luke 17 30 that we are born again the correct way through justification sanctification the baptism of the holy ghost amen that we know these things and this grace that's extended but not only that but we're talking about this afternoon which we talked before that malachi 4 does two things the second thing he does is we're going to reveal the seals which will give grace to this guy because listen without the grace on it i'm not preaching i'm saying grace grace to your soul it's one thing but the problem and the mystery that man that guy that was there mount carmel church i hope they're not listening i shouldn't have said that but look this has got to die this is so unholy this is it ain't gonna make it so we gotta get a brand new i guess when we stand before the white throne judgment they're gonna give it god's gonna give us a brand new one because this one was worthless you see what i mean now listen god didn't preach that sermon satan preached that sermon i'm just saying the way it is folks any false doctrine couldn't come from god so we know that we get grace for the soul and that we get grace for the soul even if we have to go by the way of the grave we're going to come up in this body made new full redemption full grace great he says what the headstone coming crying grace grace unto it zechariah 4 verse 7. oh great mountain what statue of a perfect man no man's ever retained to that with the full headstone with with christ coming and revealing the seals except this end time also we look trying to cut this short real quick let's go to john 1 verse 14. john 1 verse 14 we're going to skip down a few from proverbs and all that so john 1 14 the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we behold his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father look full of grace and truth john bear witness of him and cried saying this is he that whom i spake he that cometh to me is preferred before me for he was before me and of his fullness have all we received and grace for grace amen for the law was given by moses but grace and truth came by jesus christ now remember he christ came under the law to not eradicate or do away with the law but to make it what honorable jesus lived under the law even when we were talking about the book of luke the bible says jesus went to church such as the custom was that synagogue was open the word had to be in the synagogue right hey man he didn't he didn't uh you know he didn't say well bless god i'm god i don't have to go in there no he wanted to go i believe he was compelled to go because he had work to do but grace and truth came by jesus christ and we see now that truly ruth i'm trying to skip through and get to the last one ruth and esther we see grace but let's go all the way over to romans 3 verse 24. yeah okay that's fine just stay right there romans 4 15 because the law worketh wrath for where no law is there is no transgression so the law had to be given for transgression because you would not know that you're an adulterer if they had not been a law saying you don't need to you don't need to have somebody else's wife and all the other things that the law was given but remember therefore it is of faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to only that which is of the law but that also which is of the faith of abraham who is the father of us all let's go to romans 5 verse 19 for as by one man's disobedience many were made sinners now who was that that was adam so by the obedience of one shall many be made righteous moreover the law entered that the offense might abound all right there had to be something to judge by all right right but remember you walk in and the judgment is done and you you they took you out and stoned you there was no there was no court of appeal you you had no court of appeal in the old testament you did you did the crime you did the time all right but look but where sin abounded grace did much more abound why that grace was already there before adam even did what he did or god would have had to kill adam and eve that's right all right but he saw himself and adam trying to save eve as much as he could we know adam couldn't save me but he tried grace did much more abound all right so you got sin and then you got grace grace is always above sin but listen you can't what happens with us i say us what happens with the world is they take and do it like this grace over sin they sin and try to get grace and that makes it disgrace because listen folks i'm telling you when you pray and you ask god to forgive you the prophet that god tells me and the bible tells me that's put in the sea of god's forgetfulness never to be remembered by god again whether the world remembers it whether your neighbor remembers it whether your family remembers it god cannot remember that because of grace because listen folks you and i got to come to a spot i thought in this message of the hour that the real you didn't do it anyway and you that's a revelation of grace that was extended before the foundation of the world not just when you got saved not when you just got on your knees and asked god to forgive you but it was covered before the foundation of the world right amen but now let's don't make it disgrace and say well it doesn't matter then what i do because well you know what god saw you say that and you're under disgrace that as sin hath reigned unto death even so my grace reigned through righteousness look unto eternal life eternal life by jesus christ our lord we've been talking on eternal redemption and see grace is part of that eternal redemption so let's go to i've developed a cough look romans 11 5 says even so then at this present time also there's a remnant according to the election of grace and if by grace then is there's no more of works you're talking about here otherwise grace is no more grace remember do's and don'ts do's and don'ts won't get you into heaven right and i want us to see that we we've we've got a lot of new people coming in and a lot of people asking questions about the message of the hour and i don't want them to see that that we're living outside the bible i just want them to see that we're trying to live as close to the bible because my question to many people is they say well see they make excuse they say well that hair and address things in the old testament well no it's in the new too well so it's the ten commandments are you gonna take the ten commandments out of the oh no we love those ten commandments but now that wearing the garment playing the man that's just old testament when i want to ask them i want to say look who told you you could do what you do because it wasn't the bible right who told you sisters you could cut your hair had to be a man standing in a pulpit disgracing the word of god now brother brown said what was it the weakness of the pulpit it's what allowed those people to do what they did it allowed those pentecostal people right amen so it is of works that we do after grace once i see grace i don't want long hair i don't want to drink a beer i don't want to smoke a well i don't want to smoke cigarettes i want to come to church i want to do these things and you look at me and you say well that's just words it's not works when it comes from the heart that's right amen because i'll promise you if you don't have the new birth on down the line just like we're seeing now they're going to drop off like flies because there's nothing to hold them because you can't continue by words look at the catholic church they built everything they got on works and look what it's getting them nothing they're called the mother of in the bible but if it be of works then there's no more grace doesn't understand what paul's saying if it by grace then it is no more works otherwise grace is no more grace what is grace grace is for what you did in your past that was wrong you're wrongful things no you don't you don't get grace for doing things right you get grace for doing things wrong amen and it's not for something you're going to do it's for something you already did right but if it be of works then it's no more grace if i live the ten commandments look at the rich young ruler he met grace himself and the rich young ruler said i've done every commandment since my birth that's right now by works he made it right but he didn't get grace because because grace was standing there and grace told him what to do and he didn't do it that one little thing he didn't do otherwise work is no more work what then israel has not obtained that which it seeketh for but the election has obtained it and the rest were blinded in other words the gentiles got it the jews were blinded by god now let's go to uh ephesians 2 verse 7 will be finished a couple of scriptures here then in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are you saved through faith you got to have faith because how you're going to get grace if you don't have faith because it's nothing tangible there's nothing that i can say okay i've bought your freedom here's your here's your key to freedom no it's by faith right right faith is unseen i'm sorry i don't have this turned on for my grace are you saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of god and not that you were born under the right family and you were born in the right church and you watched the prophet and you you got you know they you got uh um dedicated by the prophet and you understand what it means so it's not of that it's not it works thank god because that wasn't there i could have been dedicated by brother brown he died in 65 i was born in safety that could have happened but it did not and most of you here didn't either not of works lest any man should boast all right so let's go to second timothy 1 verse 9 who hath saved us and called us with a holy calling not according to our works listen you can't get good enough to be saved get saved and then god will make you good enough amen you do then you'll do your works afterwards in a work of love not a work of have to right right yeah see if you think this morning you had to get up come to church because brother way to preach against you if you didn't then you're you're in trouble you need a new birth that's right that's right because that would put it under works but according to his own purpose and grace which was given us what in christ before the world began there's your answer right there before the world became look but it's now made manifest it didn't stay in the mind of god it didn't stay in the beginning it unfolded itself down right here but now it's made manifest by the appearing of our savior jesus christ look who has to abolish death i thought that might make you happy and hath brought life and immortality to light what through the gospel let's go to hebrews 4 16 musicians get ready to come let us therefore come what boldly unto the throne of grace you don't have to put on the right epod you don't have to wash yourself with oil you don't have to do all these things do's and don'ts to get into the holy of holies you come boldly to the throne of grace that we may what obtain mercy and find grace to help i'm not going to interject that but to help others to help others in time of need why do you get grace to give it right amen you get grace to give it to somebody now look this is the very last scripture in the bible revelations 22 21 the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all amen the last scripture in the bible musicians come the last scripture in the bible the grace of our lord jesus christ be with you all god bless you we'll see in a
