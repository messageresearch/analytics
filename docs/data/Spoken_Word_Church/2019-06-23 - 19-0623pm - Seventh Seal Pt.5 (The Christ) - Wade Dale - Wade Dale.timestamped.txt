[17:22] started continuing with the Seventh Seal
[17:25] part five we're gonna talk a little bit
[17:26] about the Christ we were talking about
[17:29] the voice last Sunday and that's
[17:31] something just kind of struck me this
[17:32] week I think maybe why we were standing
[17:37] up sitting up there and
[17:38] in the cabin just kind of meditating a
[17:40] little bit so let's bow our heads before
[17:42] we get started the Lord Jesus thank you
[17:44] for this day thank you for these that
[17:48] are standing in front of me today Lord
[17:51] there's a purchase of your blood and
[17:54] they have been for Dane and
[17:56] predestinated to be here today to listen
[17:59] and to respond to you speaking your word
[18:05] about them father you said you would
[18:09] never leave us or forsake us and you
[18:10] have not you have filled us with the
[18:13] Holy Ghost or that you can be right
[18:15] there with us the whole time and father
[18:17] I pray that you would anoint us all
[18:19] today Lord the hearer and the speaker

[18:41] you'd never leave us or forsake us you'd

[18:49] have faith Lord we pray that you'd just
[18:51] be brother Joel Forney wherever he is
[18:53] Lord if he's continued on to Canada Lord
[18:56] we pray that you'd give him supernatural
[18:58] strength
[18:58] it's just Satan trying to stop a soldier
[19:03] from completing his mission and father
[19:06] we pray that you'd just be with him in
[19:08] an anointing keep him strong father we
[19:10] need somebody like brother Jewell was
[19:12] with the way that he goes and the way

[19:40] today in Jesus Christ's name we pray
[19:42] amen
[19:43] revelations 8 verse 1 and when he had
[19:45] opened the Seventh Seal There was
[19:47] silence in heaven about the space of a
[19:50] half an hour also
[19:51] John 19 when Jesus therefore had
[19:54] received the vinegar he said it is
[19:56] finished and he bowed his head and gave
[19:58] up the ghost we're gonna finally get to
[19:59] that scripture one these days Ephesians
[20:01] 4:30 and grieve not the Holy Spirit of
[20:05] God whereby ye are sealed unto not until
[20:11] unto the day of redemption you may be
[20:15] seated in the Lord I just blessing to
[20:17] the reading his word well that was a
[20:19] good song that saying that
[20:20] brother-sister scene that was really
[20:22] good
[20:23] good to see sister Esther playing the
[20:25] piano and pray for other sister Esther
[20:28] because other sister Esther is on her
[20:29] way somebody forget to turn one off okay
[20:32] and thanks to brother Richard and
[20:36] brother Josh give them a pen clap right
[20:40] now
[20:44] this place if you didn't see the picture
[20:47] there was nothing on this stage last
[20:49] night or yesterday except that PN that
[20:52] was it nothing else
[20:53] they put ever this all this back
[20:55] together after the wedding and you know
[20:58] worked Richard did it all work yeah okay
[21:02] you wouldn't tell me if you did anyway
[21:05] yeah Richard back there doing this going
[21:10] to the bathroom wherever you go and
[21:11] going caught him in mid-stride but thank
[21:16] God that we have people that can take
[21:17] things apart and put them back together
[21:18] and they work you know sometimes men
[21:22] they put things together and there's a
[21:24] few parts missing or or like daddy
[21:28] always said where do these go after it's
[21:30] already been put together so read the
[21:33] instructions hey ma'am here we are in
[21:37] the seventh seal part five and we're
[21:40] gonna talk about the Christ now brother
[21:41] Dale has been doing an outstanding job
[21:43] he is he's just yep
[21:49] and lo and behold I tell you you talk
[21:52] about God working we went to brother Tim
[21:55] hems and brother Keith preached
[21:56] basically the same service that he did
[21:58] here but we were we took a little time
[22:02] of fellowship that evening went gone
[22:03] Waffle House and had some pie discussed
[22:06] the word of the Lord and brother Tim he
[22:09] said you know what he said I believe
[22:10] we're not preaching Christ to the people
[22:13] he said I think we need to go back and
[22:16] go through the plan of salvation and I
[22:18] said well guess what
[22:20] slowly brother Dale preaching the plan
[22:24] of salvation
[22:25] Amen so it must be needful because
[22:28] remember God doesn't do something and it
[22:30] has no effect now you say well it may
[22:33] not be affecting me well it's affecting
[22:35] somebody all right maybe it's not your
[22:37] turn but it is affecting somebody and I
[22:39] want you to realize that even in
[22:41] teaching the seals that you're teaching
[22:43] the plan of redemption it's just it's
[22:46] just maybe two more not like the baby
[22:48] form but maybe on into the mature form
[22:50] that we all need the baptism of the Holy
[22:54] Ghost and then we need a refilling and
[22:56] then we need a refilling but it's
[22:57] remember it's not it's not Christ in the
[23:01] beginning and not Christ in the end it's
[23:02] Christ in the beginning cost in the end
[23:04] that's why that that's why that brother
[23:05] Branham says and we'll read it right
[23:07] here what is the opening of the seals
[23:08] revealing Christ okay so let's just read
[23:12] a couple of quotes here and then we're
[23:14] going to read some scripture about the
[23:16] Christ and make some comments on that if
[23:18] you don't mind I want to give a
[23:20] definition of the Christ so here we come
[23:23] to a place as number 1 says remember
[23:26] revelations chapter 5 says he breaks the
[23:28] seals reveals gives us his inheritance
[23:31] to his people that we were member other
[23:34] teeth were discussing this the other
[23:35] night and and sometimes people don't see
[23:39] that they really don't go on through and
[23:41] see that that Christ had got an
[23:43] inheritance inherit eternal life in his
[23:47] body he didn't have eternal life in his
[23:49] body when he walked on the earth but he
[23:51] inherited eternal life by being the
[23:54] Christ but being that that body died and
[23:57] he could come back into that body and
[23:59] raise him from the day
[24:01] then that made him eternal in body
[24:06] spirit and soul alright so but now he
[24:10] who did he do that for he didn't do it
[24:12] for herself he did it for me in you
[24:14] alright so he did it he inherited
[24:17] becoming kinsman redeemer so he had to
[24:20] become kinsman redeemer and freely gives
[24:22] it out to us it all belong to him that's
[24:28] why that that's why that you see that
[24:31] Satan Satan can't do that Satan cannot
[24:33] do this he can't he wants to keep it all
[24:39] itself he's a selfish person but God as
[24:42] soon as he gets soon as he became
[24:44] kinsman redeemer he came for a purpose
[24:46] he came to get you but he didn't just
[24:48] come to get you so you could go pass
[24:49] away and God could raise you back up he
[24:52] came to give it back to the people the
[24:55] inheritance that he inherited alright he
[24:58] inherited eternal life in his body so
[25:00] being inherited then we're gonna talk
[25:02] about it here in Romans Romans 8 says
[25:04] we're heirs and joint heirs with Christ
[25:07] all right
[25:08] so whatever he gets we get you really
[25:11] try to I want to explain something here
[25:14] but let's go and read number 2 the
[25:17] breech preach one of these seals the
[25:20] whole thing together the whole mystery
[25:22] lays right here in these seals see every
[25:25] mystery of the Bible lays in these seals
[25:28] now brother branham said if you can't
[25:30] see wide in every verse Christ not Jesus
[25:33] Christ Christ we're gonna see what
[25:35] Christ is if you can't see Christ in
[25:37] every verse every mystery of the Bible
[25:41] lays in these seals so when you talk
[25:42] about a demeaning with garden you're
[25:43] talking about seals when you talk about
[25:45] Abraham you're talking about the seals
[25:46] when you talk about Isaac and Jacob and
[25:49] Joseph and Isaiah not your talk why
[25:51] because there's Christ on those people
[25:52] and knowing those people to do a job so
[25:55] you're talking about the seals but it
[25:57] was so sealed up till the seals cannot
[26:00] be broken until that time what the time
[26:02] of the seventh angel message which is
[26:05] what it's very specific it's now it's
[26:08] now like I said before many many
[26:12] mysteries even Paul talked
[26:14] about the mystery of the gentiles which
[26:17] is christ in you the hope of glory but
[26:18] he never heard anything about a seal but
[26:20] he was preaching about him while he was
[26:22] on earth but he was already dead and
[26:24] gone home when John got two seals in
[26:28] what was it ad whatever it was 90
[26:31] something Paul had already passed on
[26:33] Paul never heard about a first seal
[26:35] second seal third seal fourth seal fifth
[26:36] seal sixth seal seven seven and then but
[26:39] he knew about one man Christ he knew
[26:43] about Christ he knew where he had come
[26:45] from now if there's one man that could
[26:47] take you through justification and
[26:49] sanctification in the baptismal oligos
[26:51] it was the Apostle Paul hey man Paul
[26:54] knew that when he got justified if God
[26:56] didn't forgive him for holding the coats
[26:58] come on somebody if God didn't forgive
[27:02] him for holding the coats of the people
[27:04] that stoned the very people he started
[27:08] preaching to if he didn't get forgiven
[27:12] for that there was no justification
[27:14] that's why Paul says those who had he
[27:16] has justified
[27:17] he is already glorified amen but there's
[27:22] a journey in there you know you thought
[27:25] about a journey you take in there and
[27:27] the Bible says those who he has
[27:28] justified he's already glorified now God
[27:31] says that about us and he's already seen
[27:33] us at the end but you and I didn't you
[27:37] can't see you're in from the beginning
[27:39] but you want you have a journey you have
[27:41] a daily journey a daily walk I told him
[27:43] downstairs if we were to be able to see
[27:46] from here to the body change we might
[27:49] not like that right we might not like
[27:53] that we might not like what's gonna
[27:55] happen but God knows and then we just
[27:58] live day by day that's why we live in
[28:00] Christ and we'll read some of that in
[28:02] just a few minutes because I want you to
[28:04] realize one thing it's a book of
[28:07] redemption it's a mysterious part of all
[28:10] the Bible that man has never been able
[28:13] to put together sure man has read it man
[28:16] has looked at it many people today will
[28:18] open this Bible and say those who he's
[28:21] justified he's already glorified and
[28:22] they point it to another day or to a
[28:26] happening to somebody else
[28:28] our grandma you know our great-great
[28:32] grandpa name never seen it well we're
[28:34] not gonna see it but we're gonna so push
[28:35] it no it's now yes today is the day of
[28:39] redemption today is the day of full
[28:41] redemption because the seven seals have
[28:43] been open and I want to make that real
[28:45] clear point that camera right here my
[28:47] face I want you all appoint them all
[28:49] right here whoever said that we didn't
[28:52] believe the Seventh Seal is opened as a
[28:53] liar a liar I listen I would not be go
[29:00] ahead I would not be standing here today
[29:04] if I know it was already open brother
[29:08] Dale wouldn't be standing in this pulpit
[29:10] if we didn't think the Seventh Seal was
[29:12] open you can't preach this message
[29:14] without the seventh seal being open now
[29:17] if you doesn't say it's not open it's
[29:20] not right you go next door deck but
[29:25] Donnie said don't be so hard yeah you
[29:35] got that right we'll be then just a
[29:36] little while but yeah I know I mean
[29:38] y'all offense I mean you you can't even
[29:40] preach even if you never preached about
[29:43] the seals in a specific you know like
[29:48] I'm doing in a series if the Seventh
[29:50] Seal which is Christ that's what we're
[29:52] fixing the day if the Seventh Seal is
[29:54] crossing you don't say if it's not open
[29:55] then you're not boarding in right I just
[29:58] let me put a period on that you're not
[30:00] boarding in so I don't know where
[30:03] anybody got that but but you know you
[30:05] can you know what you can preach your
[30:06] heart out and people say he said someone
[30:08] zone you said no incident so god bless
[30:10] you whoever said that and don't ever say
[30:13] it again it wasn't anybody in this
[30:16] church so let's give I hope it was if it
[30:19] was then anyway let's go to number three
[30:24] I just want to clear that up though
[30:26] because look the state wait we're we
[30:27] aren't in the part of the open book to
[30:29] say what is the opening of say opening
[30:32] it's revealing Christ listen you think
[30:35] we stand up being preached to reveal us
[30:37] me brother they are
[30:38] barbra Leone no but Louise no if they
[30:44] stand that's what a problem if a lot of
[30:46] problem is they stand up here and tell
[30:47] them about their self and they point
[30:49] what they put them to you you got a
[30:51] point across if you're not getting
[30:53] Christ then I don't know
[30:57] you're just not born again that's why
[30:59] brother Dale is preaching this maybe
[31:00] there is a question in somebody's mind
[31:02] whether you're born again or not all
[31:04] right because and it's just like brother
[31:06] you know you get you sat down with
[31:08] brother Tim him a brother that's you
[31:10] know three hours from here and he's
[31:12] totally told us specifically he didn't
[31:14] listen to nobody else on the internet
[31:15] and which is fine that's okay that's his
[31:18] prerogative but what I'm saying is if he
[31:20] would have heard what brother Dale was
[31:21] preaching then you could think well he
[31:22] you know compared to that B&E Perry said
[31:24] we're just not preaching Christ enough
[31:26] to the people I said well after brother
[31:28] Dale's preaching he said he said you
[31:32] really believe in justification saying I
[31:34] said yeah that's great
[31:35] cuz there's a lot of people don't listen
[31:37] you go around the list and people in
[31:38] this mess you just believe you just it's
[31:40] just like this water you just go and you
[31:43] got it dudes into a you believe the
[31:48] Prophet I mean so you're so you're
[31:52] boarding in you know but you don't cut
[31:57] your hair do you you don't wear pants do
[31:58] you do you do you don't you do you don't
[32:03] you forget that business it's all about
[32:05] Christ but look he's the one who opened
[32:09] those seals he is those seal now look
[32:14] let me be real clear if there are
[32:19] preachers that preach the Seventh Seal
[32:23] is not open they should be behind the
[32:26] pulpit number one cuz they're not born
[32:28] again and they're not gonna help their
[32:30] people we are a people of open book we
[32:33] are the people that have been shown
[32:34] everything everything that God had in
[32:39] his mind he holds nothing back from you
[32:43] and me okay nothing you and I are the
[32:47] recipients of the whole book
[32:50] John was a top of the bride right now
[32:53] the Bible says he ate the book now
[32:55] remember they what in the page or two or
[32:57] a chapter or two laying on the floor
[32:59] when he got finished he ate the whole
[33:01] book all right if he ate the whole book
[33:04] then it was open it became what John and
[33:08] John became the book he is the one who
[33:12] opened those seals he is those seals for
[33:15] the whole Word of God is Christ and
[33:18] Christ is the seals that was open
[33:21] what is the opening of seals in
[33:23] revealing Christ so who is Christ let's
[33:28] go to the Greek lexicon and see what
[33:30] says about Christ I looked this up from
[33:32] from Genesis all the way in but do you
[33:35] know what the word Christ is not spoken
[33:37] in the Old Testament the first word
[33:41] Christ is in Matthew 1 that says
[33:46] something about Jesus Christ
[33:48] here's the generations of Christ Jesus
[33:50] generations Jesus Christ so Christ was
[33:52] it wasn't that he wasn't in the Old
[33:54] Testament but remember Christ is of what
[33:59] anointed christ meaning anointed was the
[34:03] messiah the son of god now remember he
[34:06] was in the old testament but he was not
[34:08] in a person in the old testament he was
[34:11] not in an individual in the old
[34:15] testament all right now excluding atom
[34:18] we know Adam had the Holy Ghost but he
[34:20] was given to him it wasn't a birth right
[34:24] Adam was not born he was a full-grown
[34:27] man when God created him all right and
[34:29] breed to his his nostrils the breath of
[34:31] eternal life and became an eternal
[34:34] person so what did he do but remember
[34:36] when he gave that book back to Christ or
[34:41] I love it when brother Branham told us
[34:43] he said Christ the Lamb Holy Ghost all
[34:45] the same person so you take all these
[34:47] things and you look at them in in in the
[34:50] not really in the message but - in the
[34:52] message some where you have two Lords
[34:54] and all these other things yeah we were
[34:57] talking somewhere we were talking
[34:58] something out of juice somebody meted
[35:00] you and was talking about it but it was
[35:01] Keith well Keith Reed was talking to you
[35:03] he said now you remembered that the
[35:05] juice stood up and say hey you remember
[35:08] he's only one God well see they got that
[35:11] right
[35:12] there's only one God brother branham
[35:14] occult talk to that Jewish guy says says
[35:16] you cut him up in three pieces and he
[35:18] said no no he said who be Messiah he's
[35:20] the Messiah
[35:21] we'll be gone alright even Paul when he
[35:25] was struck down on the road I was
[35:26] reading it just this morning I think it
[35:28] was when Paul was struck down he said
[35:31] who are you lord now he knew something
[35:34] was different
[35:35] he knew that wasn't just some kind of
[35:40] fog or light no it was a person because
[35:44] that person spoke back to him I am Jesus
[35:47] whom you persecute it alright so but so
[35:51] Paul had that and I love it we were
[35:54] downstairs you know doing in the book of
[35:55] Hebrews you see Paul remember Paul you
[35:58] and I are so fortunate to have all this
[36:01] background Paul had no background set in
[36:05] the Old Testament he took the Old
[36:06] Testament and made Christ a live person
[36:09] and preached in eighty percent of the
[36:13] New Testament is written by Paul about
[36:16] this man Jesus Christ who was not in the
[36:19] Old Testament per se you know he came in
[36:21] under the law we know that but he wasn't
[36:23] there with Abraham with Isaac with Jacob
[36:26] there wasn't a man called Jesus Christ
[36:28] right it was an anointing it was the
[36:31] anointing that anointed Moses so that
[36:35] Moses could watch speak in the first
[36:37] person but then when we were talking
[36:39] about this downstairs in the Old
[36:43] Testament you can type a lot of things
[36:46] but you cannot go all the way with your
[36:48] types because you can't have a prophet
[36:51] marrying the prostitute not in the New
[36:53] Testament okay right you can't have
[36:58] David being the apple of God's eye born
[37:02] again
[37:02] here listen born again and then look at
[37:05] a woman and commit adultery with her and
[37:07] then by premeditated murder which is
[37:10] capital punishment in the United States
[37:13] if you don't mind that's premeditated
[37:15] murder he
[37:16] had his friend killed his friend to
[37:20] cover up see that's not a born-again
[37:21] person that's that's what that's a man
[37:24] living through the Old Testament with an
[37:26] anointing on him but now remember like I
[37:30] said before we can't kick all them Old
[37:32] Testament people out and just say well
[37:33] they were just they were just filler
[37:35] just waste no that paradise was full of
[37:38] them and Jesus Christ went to them and
[37:41] it's theophany he went to them and
[37:44] brought them out of paradise and took
[37:46] them somewhere so he thought enough for
[37:48] them what they lived what brother Brown
[37:50] say brother Brown said why do we bark it
[37:54] flies fleas and frogs why do we bulk as
[37:59] believers as Christ being in us and
[38:02] here's Moses which also had a rap sheet
[38:07] hey man hey he all he had a rap sheet he
[38:10] was a murderer okay he murdered an
[38:13] Egyptian okay so here you got Moses but
[38:17] you got to remember when God comes over
[38:19] here it's kind of like with Abraham when
[38:20] Abraham was over here and he's the
[38:22] father of our faith he gives his wife
[38:24] away how many times sister Anna thank
[38:26] you twice she said it this morning twice
[38:29] yes he did he laughed at God there was a
[38:33] lot of times it looked like he doubted
[38:35] but when you bring him through into the
[38:38] New Testament what does Paul say about
[38:39] him strong in faith never wavered
[38:42] why because you looked back this way of
[38:45] you know what Paul was pulling him he
[38:46] was pulling him through the filter he
[38:49] was pulling him through the blood filter
[38:50] that says Abraham was a friend of God a
[38:53] perfect man an upright man but why did
[38:56] brother Brown say why do we bulk it at
[38:58] creating squirrels in other words and
[39:02] here Moses only had an anointing and
[39:04] create flies fleas and frogs say that 10
[39:08] times flies for fleas and frogs and then
[39:11] you and I say well I don't know about
[39:12] this quit creating of squirrels we're
[39:14] already creators anyway we don't have to
[39:16] have listen we don't have to go find
[39:18] Christ he's right here he's in us he's
[39:20] talking to you today
[39:22] Christ is listening to his own self talk
[39:26] listen folks we can't fail if you have
[39:29] Christ inside of you and I have Christ
[39:32] inside of me and brother Dale with all
[39:33] these other ministers brother Bob always
[39:34] have crying you have Christ Christ is
[39:38] talking back and forth to itself right
[39:43] these are that are you're another person
[39:50] Christ meaning anointed was the Messiah
[39:53] the son of God
[39:55] now also it goes back to it goat it's
[39:59] Christos then it goes to Creole which
[40:03] means annoying - annoying you know what
[40:06] annoy means I know it means to smear own
[40:16] the smear own right to smear own because
[40:22] an anointing can be smeared on you like
[40:25] what brother Dale tell about this
[40:26] morning an anointing can be smeared on
[40:28] you but you can't have Christ inside of
[40:31] you and do the things people do but you
[40:33] can be annoying it or smear don't cuz
[40:34] that's what I know it means you look up
[40:36] the word I know it just keep looking it
[40:37] up it means to smear on because what
[40:39] does it only do when you anoint somebody
[40:40] you put oil or and it just runs all over
[40:43] them
[40:43] that means no anoint alright but it said
[40:47] but it also comes in here with Christ
[40:49] now watch consecrating Jesus to the
[40:51] Masonic office and furnishing him with
[40:55] the necessary powers for its
[40:58] administration and what did Christ do
[41:01] for you brother Brown called us little
[41:06] Messiah not a separate person and
[41:11] furnished us with the necessary powers
[41:14] for us administer what administration
[41:16] what of the Masonic
[41:18] office in doing and doing Christians
[41:22] with the gifts of the Holy Spirit
[41:25] alright so but anoint right really I
[41:27] know it means to smear on it just means
[41:29] to put on something all right put on
[41:31] something all right that's why you can
[41:33] be you
[41:34] I'm an anointing to preach and you have
[41:36] an anointing to pray for the sick and
[41:38] you have an anointing for gifts and you
[41:39] have anointing for this indifferent
[41:41] anointings that could be owned anointed
[41:43] ones but you can't have Christ inside of
[41:47] you and be an anointed one you can't
[41:51] have Christ in your soul brother tell
[41:52] something like this morning you can't
[41:53] Christ in your soul and being an only
[41:55] one you can be an anointed one but it's
[41:59] a good anointing one it's not a false
[42:01] anointed one right so you can be
[42:05] anointing for a lot of things listen
[42:06] folks we've seen a lot of people get
[42:08] anointed for a lot of things and then
[42:10] what happens to them you see them drift
[42:11] away or you see something happening in
[42:14] their life and they just disappear why
[42:15] they had an anointing on them they had
[42:18] something smeared on them but there was
[42:20] nothing inside of them to keep them all
[42:23] right so what we're looking at these
[42:25] seals when we look at these seals I want
[42:27] to tell you something though when we
[42:29] look at these seals listen to me just a
[42:31] minute we're talking about if you see
[42:33] the opening of the seal you're already
[42:36] born again this is a special anointing
[42:38] on top of that this is not I mean
[42:44] something like brother Brahim said he
[42:45] said he said your new birth and
[42:48] adoptions two different things so you
[42:51] get born again Dinos I mean you're
[42:53] automatically adopted no you're adopted
[42:55] into the family under tutors and
[42:58] governors until the time appointed of
[43:00] who the father who decides when to
[43:03] release the schoolmaster the father
[43:06] decides not the schoolmaster the
[43:09] schoolmaster tells the Father will the
[43:11] father can say well just keeping up the
[43:12] folly because they know we're done
[43:13] that's it
[43:14] but you you're under tutors and
[43:16] governors until the time appointed the
[43:18] father which is to me I say if you're
[43:21] born again have you been in this message
[43:22] and you've tried your best to grow up
[43:24] that statue of a perfect man mm-hmm
[43:26] you're not under tutors and governors
[43:27] anymore you saw what about preaching I
[43:31] ain't talking about that I'm talking
[43:34] about that I've know much you come to
[43:36] maturity to where you can understand you
[43:39] know like brother Tim and I were talking
[43:40] Thursday or Wednesday night and I've
[43:45] agreed with him for a while because we
[43:48] had this discussion
[43:48] a year ago why do we have to make a
[43:51] quote for everything that's right why do
[43:58] we have to make a quote I'm going to
[44:01] read you something here anyway but and I
[44:03] already read you some but that quote is
[44:05] to help the ones listen to me that quote
[44:08] is to help the ones that's not fully
[44:09] matured yet because fully matured
[44:12] Christians don't need a quote that hurts
[44:18] your feelings good thank you because if
[44:21] it did then you need it look if you have
[44:25] to have a quote then you're propping up
[44:29] something you're having to have enough
[44:31] no I mean I'm going to tell you today
[44:35] you and I are the closest to Christ
[44:40] anybody on this earth has ever been
[44:42] except Christ himself besides brother
[44:44] branham unless in iron and not even
[44:47] there not not in our knowledge of just
[44:49] knowing what page number what year it
[44:51] was preached in one paragraph no I'm
[44:54] talking about what you have inside of
[44:56] you that when somebody says something
[44:58] the wheels go turning and you can pull
[45:01] quotes but you pull them out of your
[45:03] head cuz you've got the essence of the
[45:07] message how many times have I ever told
[45:09] you that this letter will kill you the
[45:12] pages of this Bible will kill you
[45:15] but once that page that Bible comes
[45:18] inside of you and becomes an alive word
[45:21] when it becomes an alive word then
[45:24] you're the walking Bible and no one can
[45:26] take that from you no one let's read
[45:32] this mystery real quick on here now
[45:35] watch the seals revealing crops what is
[45:37] the Seventh Seal it is Christ we've come
[45:40] through this journey of justification
[45:42] sanctification of baptism Holy Ghost
[45:44] we've come to justification
[45:45] sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost in
[45:47] the pyramid my brother Dale said then
[45:49] now is a mysterious part of
[45:51] justification what is the mysterious
[45:53] efficient the baby form of justification
[45:56] is you did it you did it
[46:01] but it's gone well points you then don't
[46:06] you laughs no you did it and the
[46:09] preachers preaching to you and you know
[46:11] you did it
[46:12] amen but when you get that chopped off
[46:16] hallelujah amen but now you talk about
[46:20] justification in the form we're talking
[46:22] about in that part where the real you
[46:25] never done it we've got to be able to
[46:27] see that that in our born-again
[46:31] experience oh yeah Nord have mercy Satan
[46:35] can throw it in your memory what you did
[46:38] but how listen how can we believe what
[46:43] we believe and see that God he's forgot
[46:48] that you bring things up the Guardian
[46:55] even know hello you do God will never
[47:05] accuse you for something he's forgive
[47:07] you for ever
[47:09] he'll never bring it back up Lord I wish
[47:13] that with having us he'll never bring it
[47:15] back up
[47:16] he'll never rehash it he has moved on
[47:20] and he's took you with him if you'll go
[47:24] that salvation that's repentance that's
[47:27] true repentance it's done it's finished
[47:30] the light not alone Lord I don't want to
[47:38] knock the light out perfect it no it was
[47:43] Richard Gilder my going them never mind
[47:49] anyway blue devil I just noticed it was
[47:52] dark right there when I look back so I
[47:55] did it
[47:57] we need a work order Richard man yeah oh
[48:01] that one did it duly see what you did
[48:07] yeah we're all family that's okay but
[48:15] risk but listen when we talk about we're
[48:19] talk about these things we remember when
[48:22] when the Bible tells that it will he
[48:25] will bring to your remembrance
[48:26] whatsoever now look you cannot remember
[48:30] something that you don't know anything
[48:32] about you can only remember what you've
[48:36] read you can only remember what you went
[48:38] through but you got to remember God
[48:40] doesn't remember your past sins they're
[48:43] gone
[48:44] they're done they're finished what sins
[48:47] are you talking about some way I'll
[48:49] write a song about that Jim to explain
[48:54] to her after church okay anyway bless
[49:00] your heart okay who are we yet nope no
[49:07] really I mean what sins are you talking
[49:09] about you listen why listen that our
[49:11] problem is we rehash all this stuff I'm
[49:15] a little bit off here but I'm kind of
[49:18] helping you a little bit with what
[49:19] brother dad let's talk about in your
[49:21] journey what you've done yeah Satan is
[49:23] gonna absolutely every time you drive by
[49:25] the place you did something he's gonna
[49:27] go you remember that yes that be
[49:31] remember you got drunk that night and
[49:32] you God don't remember none of that and
[49:36] he'll never see that and he'll never
[49:38] bring that up so listen if it ever is
[49:42] brought up you know who it is
[49:44] you know who's come knocking at your
[49:46] door the devil and he's a liar he can
[49:51] remember it but God can't so you just
[49:54] tell him say look my daddy done forgot
[49:55] that my father's done forgot that I
[49:58] don't have to worry about it listen if

[50:02] halfway Lord I'm sorry no if you truly
[50:06] repented though at justification though
[50:08] when you truly repent you know you know
[50:11] something happen you've got to know

[50:15] what happened he is obligated cuz he
[50:18] your daddy he's your daddy in your
[50:21] journey and as you go through your
[50:22] journey he's the one that's gonna point
[50:24] out all the positive things sure he may
[50:26] give you a little stimulation in the in
[50:29] there in the backside every once in a
[50:31] while or back of the head you know he

[50:36] not gonna kill you with it and he's not
[50:38] gonna say tomorrow you remember
[50:41] yesterday we're not no that's not God
[50:43] God forgives you of all that you say
[50:46] brother way what about that these sales
[50:48] these sales is telling you how pure you
[50:50] are now that there's a work already been
[50:53] done it's already finished and you've
[50:55] got to move into that and then that's
[50:58] where you'll see that the book is open
[51:00] because you become an open book a man
[51:03] you become an open book God begins to
[51:05] talk to you like brother Keith was
[51:07] preaching the other night about the non
[51:08] spiritual gifts hey it's for all of us
[51:11] and it's not just speaking in tongues
[51:14] and interpretation that's what we're
[51:15] talking about this morning everybody
[51:16] goes well you don't have any gifts in
[51:18] your church and nobody speaking in
[51:19] tongues and interpretation Billy Brown
[51:22] said that's the least of the nine one
[51:24] two three four five six seven are very
[51:27] important wisdom knowledge prophecy what
[51:29] else
[51:29] miracles faith we've seen that we got
[51:33] gifts working in our church why question
[51:36] yourself you have gifts working in the
[51:38] church you just might not have speaking
[51:41] in tongues and interpretation we will
[51:43] get to that or brother Brown said if you
[51:45] lay under the spout long enough you
[51:46] you'll be able to do that but we got to
[51:49] do it in order we can't do it out of
[51:51] order we do all these other things in
[51:52] order we might as well do that in order
[51:53] all right so that's to help the body of
[51:58] believers but let's not hone in on the
[52:00] life's too we have plenty of gifts of
[52:05] wisdom here Holy Ghost wisdom knowledge
[52:09] faith prophecy healing my heavens that
[52:15] means been healed in this building well
[52:17] good grief
[52:18] we got a miracle working group a bunch
[52:20] of people we got all kind of gifts
[52:22] working and yeah actually one gift is
[52:24] you stay awake long enough to hold your
[52:25] hand up
[52:26] I get to sleep the cloud remember I run
[52:33] them off and put them to sleep faster
[52:34] than anybody you ever seen Colossians
[52:37] 1:26 says even the mystery which has
[52:41] been hidden from ages and from
[52:43] generations but now it's made for
[52:46] manifest to the world any what that said
[52:54] that ain't what that said I want him to
[52:58] put it on the strain even the mystery
[53:04] Colossians 1:26 even the mystery which
[53:07] has been hidden from ages this must be a
[53:09] mystery thank you but now it's made
[53:13] manifest to his Saints to his Saints
[53:17] to me and you not everybody else to men
[53:21] you remember folks this is a secret
[53:25] coming of Christ it's so secret the
[53:28] world will never know we're here and
[53:30] never know when we leave to whom god
[53:36] would make known what is the riches of
[53:38] the glory of this mystery among the
[53:40] gentiles what is this mystery Paul which
[53:43] is Christ in you the hope of glory the
[53:46] hope of glory is in you the whole hope
[53:52] why because you know what if we are if
[53:54] there was not one if Christ died walked
[53:57] out of the tomb went ascended and come
[53:59] back and nobody wanted or come back and
[54:03] everyone in nobody you got take 90% of
[54:07] the Bible and throw in the trash but he
[54:09] did come back we do believe he came on
[54:11] the Pentecost we do believe he came in
[54:13] 120 and out of that 120 you see the
[54:16] millions that you have today spiritual
[54:18] multiplication which is Christ in you
[54:20] not on you because remember we're going
[54:22] to read a couple now where it talks
[54:24] about false Christ which is crossing you
[54:28] the hope of glory whom we preach that's
[54:31] what I said if you're not preaching
[54:32] Christ or the Seventh Seal you know you
[54:34] can't preach without it being open oh
[54:37] yeah wait a minute let me put this way
[54:39] you preach on hand
[54:40] in dress and the do's and the don'ts you
[54:44] preach on that but you can't preach the
[54:48] mysteries of God to where somebody says
[54:50] Amen that's right and growing grace and
[54:51] knowledge you can do that that's what
[54:54] the problems being we spent 50 something
[54:56] years beating on the flesh and not
[54:58] getting down into the soul you get down
[55:01] in the soul of that individual I'll
[55:03] guarantee you we're gonna take a body
[55:04] change but it's gonna come from that
[55:06] soul it's not gonna come from you it's
[55:08] not gonna come from you wearing long
[55:09] sleeves and know this and that and you
[55:11] need to do this and you can't do it and
[55:13] they do it and won't doing what ant got
[55:15] to do and three inches above your knees
[55:17] below your knees you can't have higher
[55:18] than that you understand what I mean
[55:22] somebody preaching on tenth dress now
[55:24] that's a waste of time why would you
[55:27] assemble yourself to hear that but you
[55:30] know what that's what you had to come
[55:31] through I guess but what is that doing
[55:33] to edify the body it's all well it to me
[55:37] it just beats the people whom we preach
[55:41] warning every man and teaching every man
[55:43] and all wisdom that we may present every
[55:47] man perfect in Christ Jesus every man
[55:52] perfect in Christ Jesus that's what
[55:55] we're working toward we're working
[55:57] toward you're never gonna have a perfect
[55:59] church but you can have perfect people
[56:00] in assert I'm just saying Matthew 24 and
[56:07] except those days should be shortened
[56:09] there should be no flesh should no flesh
[56:11] be saved before the elects sake those
[56:13] days shall be shortened
[56:16] thank the Lord they're getting shorter
[56:18] anyway this is the middle of the year
[56:22] 2019 the middle of the year grief then
[56:27] If any man shall say unto you now look
[56:30] let's break this down because I went
[56:32] through this lifestyle 94 laughs a life
[56:35] sunny whatever it was and just kind of
[56:38] run through it but let's let's piece it
[56:40] out here then if any man shall saying so
[56:42] look that man doesn't know where Christ
[56:46] is that man if any man shall say unto
[56:52] you
[56:53] lo here is Christ believe it not so that
[56:58] man right there is a false messenger
[57:01] yeah a false preacher shall say unto you
[57:05] lo here is Christ or there believe it
[57:08] not for there shall arise false Christ's
[57:13] while false anointed and false prophets
[57:22] you know we we also will discussing some
[57:26] things and I'm just going to tell like
[57:27] it is you know everybody's saying
[57:29] so-and-so is a prophet and this one's
[57:30] the Prophet not was a prophet you know
[57:32] they could be false there was a school
[57:40] of the prophets in the Old Testament
[57:41] that followed Elijah around the whole
[57:43] time and they were never right except
[57:45] for one time they said we know your we
[57:47] know the life is Gor Elijah is going up
[57:49] today going to heaven but remember they
[57:51] had all this other stuff they made wild
[57:53] gourds and made the pot was full of
[57:56] death thank you and you understand one
[58:00] thing so if you say so and so's a
[58:03] prophet or his he said - he said his son
[58:06] was a prophet be careful he could be
[58:10] false I'm just saying cuz I will promise
[58:14] you one thing if a prophet says
[58:16] something and it's not right he's fault
[58:18] if you got in a word in plain black and
[58:22] white and he says something besides that
[58:25] he's false he might be a prophet but
[58:28] he's a false prophet all right you
[58:30] understand what I'm saying because the
[58:32] false prophet would never take you to
[58:34] the word a true prophet will always take
[58:36] you the word all right man
[58:40] and show great signs and wonders
[58:42] insomuch that if it were possible they
[58:45] shall deceive the very elect listen this
[58:50] is so important jesus said behold I have
[58:52] told you before in other words verily
[58:54] verily I've told you before wherefore if
[58:58] they shall say unto you behold he is in
[59:02] the desert go not forth behold he is in
[59:06] secret chamber believe it not do you
[59:09] know why you can call these people false
[59:11] prophets because the word in use is that
[59:16] ain't right
[59:17] so where's Christ in you that's the
[59:22] great mystery is that Christ can be in
[59:24] you looking at somebody that's false and
[59:27] saying what do you mean I got to go to
[59:29] so-and-so or I got to go over here and
[59:31] there the other the Christ inside of me
[59:34] tells me the word and if it's anything
[59:37] contrary to that it's false may be able
[59:41] to discern may be able to do all things
[59:43] but if he can't take you to the word
[59:45] he's false all right
[59:48] so for as the Lightning cometh out of
[59:52] the east and Shina Stevens in the West
[59:54] so shall also the coming of Son of Man
[59:56] be everybody got that let's go to
[1:00:02] Matthew 16 so how is the only way you're
[1:00:05] gonna know where Christ is how is the
[1:00:08] only way you are gonna know where Christ
[1:00:11] is he's right here I don't have to go to
[1:00:16] the desert I don't have to go over to
[1:00:18] this one I don't have to take that
[1:00:20] person's doctrine I run it through my
[1:00:22] filter and if my filter said it's wrong
[1:00:25] and it's according to the Bible then
[1:00:27] it's wrong what I've got the court of
[1:00:29] the Bible and read more Simon Peter
[1:00:32] answered and said we're gonna read
[1:00:33] something about Christ and will then
[1:00:34] will dismiss won't be too long cause
[1:00:36] they want to cover something else in a
[1:00:38] couple weeks and Simon Peter answered
[1:00:39] and said thou art the Christ the Son of
[1:00:42] the Living God now remember that's where
[1:00:44] Peter I mean Jesus said who the men say
[1:00:47] that I the Son of Man am and he says
[1:00:48] thou art the Christ in other words
[1:00:50] you're lis anointed but look what he
[1:00:51] done he could be a false anointed but
[1:00:55] you can't be the Son of the Living God
[1:00:56] and be false you cannot be a son of God
[1:01:00] and be false all right that's not of the
[1:01:04] Living God
[1:01:04] so see Simon told him thou art the
[1:01:07] Christ and haven't gotten in Jesus said
[1:01:08] hey that's right and I'm gonna build my
[1:01:12] church on that what the church on the
[1:01:15] day of Pentecost was birthed by Christ
[1:01:17] if you got born again yesterday you were
[1:01:20] by Christ all right so we didn't deviate
[1:01:23] from that at all you can't if you if you
[1:01:26] can hold that point watch this
[1:01:28] mark 941 boy so ever shall give you a
[1:01:32] cup of water to drink in my name we
[1:01:36] quote that scripture a lot but we don't
[1:01:38] quote this part now listen not just ever
[1:01:42] I want to be real strong with this if if
[1:01:47] I'm not born again and somebody gives me
[1:01:51] a cup of water that don't mean they're
[1:01:52] going to heaven but if I belong to
[1:01:59] Christ amen whosoever shall give you a
[1:02:04] cup of water to drink in my name because
[1:02:05] you belong to Christ verily I say unto
[1:02:10] you he shall not lose his reward listen
[1:02:18] we use an example often about somebody
[1:02:21] helping you on the side of the road and
[1:02:23] different things it's not because of you
[1:02:26] come on it's not because of you it's not
[1:02:28] because you're some great person Christ
[1:02:30] is in you right what did what did what
[1:02:36] did brother Keith was talking about what
[1:02:38] did when Peter was sitting there and a
[1:02:40] nice come in he sat down and eyes he
[1:02:42] said you have what you have lied to the
[1:02:45] Holy Ghost you have lied to the Christ
[1:02:48] that's inside of me and you will not
[1:02:51] leave this plate when we know why
[1:02:52] brother Brian said we're coming back to
[1:02:54] that right so it's not just may you
[1:02:59] whoever brother Larry anybody know it's
[1:03:01] Christ in you the mystery is Christ in
[1:03:03] you the hope of glory
[1:03:04] alright but if you belong to Christ
[1:03:06] barely on seeing you he shalt not lose
[1:03:09] his reward Romans 1 verse 16 for I am
[1:03:13] not ashamed of the gospel of Christ for
[1:03:16] it is the power of God or the salvation
[1:03:18] to everyone that believeth not that you
[1:03:22] believe brother Branham was a prophet
[1:03:23] that will not send you to heaven
[1:03:31] they might send you somewhere else but
[1:03:36] you know why I know brother Brown was a
[1:03:38] prophet because he was a word prophet
[1:03:41] and every time he opens his mouth its
[1:03:44] Christ speaking to me and with a Christ
[1:03:46] in me says that ain't nothing but truth
[1:03:48] that was the Christ and sister had it
[1:03:50] right they said don't eat nothing but
[1:03:51] the crew but the truth right
[1:03:55] why do you say man why do you say men
[1:03:58] just cousin take the guy beside you does
[1:04:02] do you say man you're Amen in the word
[1:04:05] and it's because the word has agreed
[1:04:07] with what's being spoke to me that's
[1:04:11] very simple with you hear the word you
[1:04:14] got to be able to respond if you got the
[1:04:16] word inside of you you have to respond
[1:04:19] now you might respond by Barry you know
[1:04:22] a nod or you can you know get up and
[1:04:24] we're yet Bob you can get up and oh I
[1:04:27] told Bob he's gonna have to find a new
[1:04:29] job he can't do my water anymore because
[1:04:31] we take it out of the refrigerator so
[1:04:33] he's gonna be the the he's gonna keep
[1:04:36] you all awake no he's gonna be the
[1:04:40] worship way he's gonna be the one it's
[1:04:41] gonna get runny islands one of these
[1:04:42] days we're gonna get old Bob going and
[1:04:44] we'll just fall right in behind him but
[1:04:47] look now look watch the whole thing you
[1:04:49] got to take these two scriptures
[1:04:50] together from I'm not ashamed of the
[1:04:51] gospel Christ where is the pound
[1:04:52] regarding the salvation to everyone that
[1:04:54] believeth to the Jew first and also to
[1:04:57] the Greek for their in for their II and
[1:05:01] what the gospel of Christ for in the
[1:05:02] gospel of Christ is the righteousness of
[1:05:05] God revealed from faith to faith as it
[1:05:08] is written the just shall live by faith
[1:05:09] you know you have to believe I like what
[1:05:13] they put up here this morning where it
[1:05:16] had the sin and then it had faith we're
[1:05:18] brothers brother Joel I think that you
[1:05:20] have to have faith that that happened
[1:05:21] folks you have to be a believer to just
[1:05:25] believe that your past sins got listen
[1:05:31] it's got to be revealed to you
[1:05:35] and even a ranked center that comes in
[1:05:37] off the street and he gets up he can be
[1:05:40] justified because God sends you to
[1:05:41] believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:05:42] thou shalt be saved
[1:05:43] odds are just shall live by faith if you
[1:05:45] believe that God's chopped off your past
[1:05:47] sins but you got to remember like
[1:05:49] brother Dale's preaching you got to be
[1:05:51] careful because that snakes still in
[1:05:53] there most people don't see it see most
[1:05:56] people I say most people live
[1:05:57] denominations you just come up shake a
[1:05:59] hand cry
[1:06:00] turn around whatever do ever whatever
[1:06:02] they say and then you're alright but see
[1:06:05] we had a prophet come along and says
[1:06:06] well you know that might be a good
[1:06:08] deathbed confession or or if you get
[1:06:10] justified and you die real quick you
[1:06:12] know you'll go to heaven go to heaven he
[1:06:14] didn't say Brian he said you go to
[1:06:15] heaven all right because your past sins
[1:06:17] been chopped off what do you think
[1:06:19] happened to the thief on the cross he
[1:06:22] was a thief they put him on a cross as a
[1:06:26] thief he was dying as a thief that's why
[1:06:30] he was on the cross he was a thief up
[1:06:33] until the moment he turned and said will
[1:06:35] you please just remember me when you get
[1:06:38] into your kingdom and Jesus said you
[1:06:43] come in with me I told him I said he's
[1:06:47] one of the he didn't spend the six free
[1:06:48] to here and spend with just a few
[1:06:49] minutes in paradise cuz when he died and
[1:06:52] went to paradise Christ died and went to
[1:06:53] paradise I mean went to hell and preach
[1:06:55] them will come pick him up and took him
[1:06:57] somewhere so he was not there very long
[1:06:59] but you know what we're gonna get to
[1:07:02] meet that guy yes we're gonna meet that
[1:07:05] guy
[1:07:07] [Applause]
[1:07:08] but be careful let's don't be all the
[1:07:11] thief on the cross and wait till the
[1:07:13] final moments trying to get can getting
[1:07:15] you know try to get saved because if you
[1:07:18] and I live another day that same root of
[1:07:21] evil still there if you just if you just
[1:07:23] get justified like what brother Dale was
[1:07:25] talking about but you still gotta have
[1:07:26] faith that God's chopped that because
[1:07:28] you have nothing except believing you
[1:07:33] have nothing else but you start reading
[1:07:37] the Bible than what you do brother
[1:07:39] Dale's won't get into this I hope about
[1:07:41] sanctification sanctification brother
[1:07:44] Brown said you become into a religious
[1:07:46] order your name goes on the book its
[1:07:49] scientific ation a lot of things happen
[1:07:50] to sanctification what to drive that
[1:07:53] unclean spirit out you got to be
[1:07:54] listening to something you got to be
[1:07:57] listening to something alright that
[1:08:00] drives that unclean spirit out now what
[1:08:02] happens is though he's you're not real
[1:08:05] serious and he comes back and he comes
[1:08:10] back religious and you'll set in a
[1:08:11] message pew and die and not even be born
[1:08:15] again but when somebody tells you that
[1:08:17] though like ability L said you know it
[1:08:18] now
[1:08:20] it's checking up time folks this is
[1:08:23] pencil sharpening time this is the time
[1:08:26] when you need to check on yourself you
[1:08:29] need to check on your household a man
[1:08:33] Bible says if you'll be serious he God
[1:08:36] saved that jailer in his whole house he
[1:08:40] said you and your household will be
[1:08:41] saved if you believe a man so what are
[1:08:44] we doing let's believe Romans 3 verse 22
[1:08:47] even the righteousness of God which is
[1:08:49] by faith of Jesus Christ unto all and
[1:08:52] upon all them that believe for there is
[1:08:57] no difference for all have sinned and
[1:08:59] come short of the glory of God amen
[1:09:02] we're all in wouldn't be Paulo being
[1:09:04] justified freely by His grace through
[1:09:07] the redemption that is in Christ Jesus
[1:09:09] it took Jesus Christ to start this
[1:09:12] Redemption ball rolling he man and then
[1:09:15] it took Jesus Christ to do that not just
[1:09:18] the Christ and not
[1:09:20] Jesus they were plenty of Jesus's back
[1:09:22] then thou art the Christ he identified
[1:09:26] who he was alright let's go to Roman's 6
[1:09:30] hmm
[1:09:32] Romans is just full of Paul talking
[1:09:36] about Christ now if we be dead with
[1:09:38] Christ we believe that we shall also
[1:09:42] live with him if we'd be dead with
[1:09:46] Christ now look you can't be married to
[1:09:49] two at the same time we're gonna read
[1:09:54] that maybe a couple of Sunday's there's
[1:09:55] more about this in Corinthians but right
[1:09:57] here if we be dead with Christ we
[1:10:00] believe that we shall also live with him
[1:10:03] knowing that Christ being raised from
[1:10:06] the dead dies no more now where is
[1:10:10] Christ where is Christ in you yes in
[1:10:16] your soul well then what death hath no
[1:10:19] more dominion over you for in that he
[1:10:22] died he died unto sin one time but in
[1:10:26] that he liveth he liveth unto God
[1:10:31] believe us now this Romans seven
[1:10:35] wherefore my brethren he also are become
[1:10:39] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[1:10:41] that you should be married to another
[1:10:44] dead can't be married to two husbands
[1:10:47] it's the same two living husbands at the
[1:10:48] same time but if you have to be dead you
[1:10:50] can marry again all right that you
[1:10:53] should be married to another even to him
[1:10:55] who is raised from the dead that we
[1:10:58] should bring forth fruit unto God the
[1:11:00] body of Christ
[1:11:02] dead to the law by the body of Christ
[1:11:05] you know why because the law said you
[1:11:07] can't have two husbands living you have
[1:11:11] one dead you marry another Amen alright
[1:11:15] so you can't be married to Christ in the
[1:11:17] devil at the same time Romans 8 this
[1:11:22] kind of sums it all up but ye are not in
[1:11:25] the flesh but in the spirit now what's
[1:11:29] he saying
[1:11:31] that we just everything's took out in
[1:11:33] the flat no you're still in your flesh
[1:11:36] okay but you're not in the flesh while
[1:11:39] we're not leaning toward the fleshly
[1:11:41] things but in the spirit if so be that's
[1:11:46] the Spirit of God dwell in you if so be
[1:11:48] now if any man have not the Spirit of
[1:11:51] Christ he is none of his and if Christ
[1:11:55] be in you the body is dead because of
[1:11:58] sin but the Spirit is life because of
[1:12:01] righteousness but if the spirit of him
[1:12:06] who Christ that raised up Jesus from the
[1:12:10] dead dwell in you he that raised up
[1:12:13] Christ from the dead shall also quicken
[1:12:15] your mortal bodies by his Spirit that
[1:12:19] dwelleth in you so where's your body
[1:12:21] changed coming from it's gonna come from
[1:12:23] you but you gotta but remember if the
[1:12:25] Seventh Seal is revealing Christ he's
[1:12:29] got to be revealed to you in such a way
[1:12:31] that it's already been took care of I
[1:12:34] read to you a long time ago brother Bram
[1:12:36] said when Christ died on the cross you
[1:12:39] died with him when he rose you rose with
[1:12:42] him when he got a body change you got a
[1:12:45] body change potentially so it's already
[1:12:47] done that's why Paul could you know what
[1:12:49] Paul's looking at then he said oh my
[1:12:51] those who is justified he is already
[1:12:54] glorified there's a journey in there but
[1:12:58] who he who has started a good work Paul
[1:13:01] said we'll finish it so it is a good
[1:13:04] work well me and you come up and we're
[1:13:06] born again and we're baptized in the
[1:13:07] name of Lord Jesus Christ God baptizes
[1:13:09] us into the body guess what happens
[1:13:11] we're good work we might be a WIP
[1:13:16] working progress but we're working
[1:13:19] progress with Christ Christ is the one
[1:13:22] that's doing the work if we've what
[1:13:25] yield our members that's why I said you
[1:13:28] you're not in the flesh yeah you're in
[1:13:30] the flesh but you don't do the things
[1:13:33] that the flesh you do the things of the
[1:13:34] Spirit just what I said before about
[1:13:35] David David will not have done the
[1:13:37] things in the flesh that he did if he'd
[1:13:38] have been born again he wasn't murdered
[1:13:41] that best friend of his and had his wife
[1:13:44] in adultery he wouldn't do that amen
[1:13:47] that was when this that was when the
[1:13:50] anointing was on him but remember when
[1:13:51] you and I the anointing comes in us
[1:13:54] guess what that's it we're doing now
[1:13:59] next time do you what we'll do is we'll
[1:14:01] cover
[1:14:01] I don't want cover anymore we'll stop
[1:14:03] stop right there and I won't read that
[1:14:10] one more time break it back up again
[1:14:14] bring it up again listen let's read it
[1:14:16] one more time but you're not in the
[1:14:21] flesh but in the spirit if so be if
[1:14:24] there's a big word if if so be that the
[1:14:28] Spirit of God dwell in you who is that
[1:14:30] Christ now if any man have not the
[1:14:32] Spirit of Christ he is none of this and
[1:14:35] if Christ be in you the body is dead
[1:14:39] because of sin we know we were born in
[1:14:41] sin shaping and Nikoli all these things
[1:14:43] but the Spirit is life because of
[1:14:45] righteousness now if you stop right
[1:14:47] there
[1:14:47] then Paul has separated it and said your
[1:14:50] body is dead because of sin but your
[1:14:52] spirit of life because of righteousness
[1:14:53] there's no way for you to take a body
[1:14:55] change he separated them but watch Paul
[1:15:00] but if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:15:05] Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that
[1:15:10] raised up Christ from the dead you know
[1:15:12] what that day we talked about the
[1:15:15] resurrection day as the greatest day
[1:15:16] ever a man that was dead
[1:15:22] got a body change stepped out of a tomb
[1:15:25] and said all power and heavily nurse
[1:15:27] been given unto me that same person is
[1:15:31] dwelling in you that same person is
[1:15:34] dwelling in each and every one of you
[1:15:36] that have the new birth your
[1:15:37] resurrection lays inside of you
[1:15:39] the ones that have gone on brother Tatom
[1:15:41] brother tom sister hazel I don't brother
[1:15:45] Gary all the different ones and some
[1:15:47] brother Richard Marlo that's why you'll
[1:15:51] see them again that right there that
[1:15:55] scriptures why you'll see them again
[1:15:57] if that same spirit of him that raised
[1:15:59] up Christ from the dead dwell in you he
[1:16:02] that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:16:03] shall also quicken your mortal body by
[1:16:08] the spirit that dwelleth in you so what
[1:16:13] is the seventh seal you Christ in you
[1:16:17] it's the greatest mystery Satan cannot
[1:16:20] understand how that God is gonna do
[1:16:23] anything through you because he's always
[1:16:27] beating you telling you what you did do
[1:16:29] telling you what you should do and
[1:16:31] shouldn't do telling you do's and don'ts
[1:16:33] and do's and don'ts and Christ just said
[1:16:35] look I love you and if you'll just let
[1:16:38] me live inside of you all I'm doing is
[1:16:40] responding to myself that's what we
[1:16:43] really got to do we got to let Christ
[1:16:44] respond to himself why do you respond in
[1:16:47] a sanctuary now because you got a spark
[1:16:51] in you the same spark that's talking to
[1:16:53] you you got the same connection you've
[1:16:55] got a you got a you know you got the
[1:16:57] same one same person we hope it's the
[1:16:59] same person but why do we in also listen
[1:17:03] to another thing what what about you
[1:17:06] sitting in a service and you hear false
[1:17:08] doctrine how many have you done that
[1:17:12] and something goes off inside of you
[1:17:15] that says some things not exactly right
[1:17:20] now you want to listen you don't want to
[1:17:22] be sitting there be a critic but you
[1:17:25] want to let God lead you and if you're
[1:17:26] if you're listening you go I mean how
[1:17:29] many times that ever happened to you the
[1:17:31] very reason you raised your hand knowing
[1:17:33] the false doctrine was preached to you
[1:17:35] is because you saw because maybe the
[1:17:38] other people said besides every was like
[1:17:41] this God been in the message for 45
[1:17:44] years hey fish with the Prophet he
[1:17:49] walked with a bra mm-hmm if Cosby in you
[1:17:57] he's gonna respond to his self every
[1:18:00] time there is no time Christ is gonna
[1:18:03] say no to his self so what is the
[1:18:06] Seventh Seal brother wait is she
[1:18:09] it's Christ and you hidden and
[1:18:11] simplicity but revealed in the same
[1:18:15] revealed in simplicity now that you and
[1:18:18] I were speaking a couple of seconds ago
[1:18:21] about the voice any man's word is boys
[1:18:24] is a word why do you think we took why
[1:18:29] do you think God allowed brother Branham
[1:18:31] in 1947 musicians come in 1947 brother
[1:18:35] Brian my first tape he says they're
[1:18:38] working on some electronic new
[1:18:40] electronic equipment here remember the
[1:18:44] first sermon was recorded on a wire and
[1:18:46] then they were on LP records boy hugs
[1:18:50] like to carry 1100 of them around well
[1:18:54] then they had him on the what why am I
[1:18:58] saying reel-to-reel 7-inch reels when I
[1:19:00] said if you were here before I don't
[1:19:02] know if Reda remembers it or not but
[1:19:04] this whole wall the first church we had
[1:19:06] this whole wall was nothing but shelves
[1:19:09] from the top to the bottom with brother
[1:19:12] Browns messages in in 7-inch reels all
[1:19:16] up and down
[1:19:21] where they at now if I had my phone I
[1:19:25] got him in my phone the whole message
[1:19:27] it's in my phone if I want to hear the
[1:19:30] voice all I got ahead is hit the hit the
[1:19:32] play and and I can hear brother Browns
[1:19:34] voice I can remember sitting there and
[1:19:37] and they break they twist the tape
[1:19:44] record they'll get fast because I
[1:19:45] remember daddy taking those belts and
[1:19:47] replacing the belts remember replacing
[1:19:49] them little rubber belts because that
[1:19:50] would wear out so much and it's slipping
[1:19:52] you know it well because he'd be
[1:19:53] preaching Whitney because you're well
[1:19:57] you know but you see where we come from
[1:19:59] what I'm telling you is to see where
[1:20:01] we've come from now we have all this
[1:20:02] information so as if God if man has
[1:20:05] invest that much in technology so has
[1:20:07] God advanced in the spiritual technology
[1:20:09] he's given us more and more a day by day
[1:20:12] more and more than anybody's ever had
[1:20:14] before and it's all one thing what
[1:20:16] Christ in you to get you to believe who
[1:20:20] you already are not who you
[1:20:21] gonna be who you already are let's table
[1:20:24] its Christ in you and I'm trying to look
[1:20:30] up a quote now maybe somebody can help
[1:20:31] me with it but brother Brian said
[1:20:32] crossing you the hope of glory the only
[1:20:34] hope glory has this you cross has
[1:20:38] already done his work folks Christ does
[1:20:41] not have to get on the cross again
[1:20:42] Christ does not have to come back down
[1:20:43] here in human flesh and die again he did
[1:20:46] that one time he just wants us to die
[1:20:49] daily and let Christ live
[1:20:52] that's the seals the seals is revealing
[1:20:55] Christ
[1:20:56] to who and through who you were the
[1:21:02] recipients of all this and and we like I
[1:21:07] said before man has made the seventh
[1:21:10] seal everything but you I believe it's
[1:21:16] time to debunk all the myths it's not
[1:21:23] brother branham he's not the seventh
[1:21:24] seal he's part of it cause he's crying
[1:21:28] I mean he's got Christ in it but now
[1:21:30] he's going on so it's got to be the
[1:21:34] voice of the resurrection to bring those
[1:21:39] dead Saints out of the ground and it
[1:21:42] will be the same spirit that raised up
[1:21:45] Christ from the dead will quicken your
[1:21:47] mortal body and will be changed it's
[1:21:50] just that's just so simple then you you
[1:21:52] know you just say really yeah really
[1:21:55] it's not this all these doctrines that's
[1:21:57] been started and all these different
[1:21:58] man's got to raise up and oh we got to
[1:22:01] follow this guy because let me read this
[1:22:05] one more time except these days be
[1:22:10] shortened there should be no flesh save
[1:22:11] then if any man's are saying to you lo
[1:22:14] here is Christ or there believe it not
[1:22:19] for there shall arise false Christ's and
[1:22:21] false prophets and shall show sign great
[1:22:23] signs and wonders insomuch that if it
[1:22:25] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:22:27] very elect behold I have told you before
[1:22:32] wherefore if they shall say unto you
[1:22:34] behold he is in
[1:22:35] desert doesn't that sound familiar don't
[1:22:42] go out there right here
[1:22:45] well the Tim hems made a good point the
[1:22:48] other day he said I'm not born again by
[1:22:49] relics I'm not I'm born again by Jesus
[1:22:54] Christ dying on a cross then I give
[1:22:57] honor to who honors do but I got born
[1:22:59] again not by relic I didn't get born
[1:23:02] again by this message I got born again
[1:23:08] by Christ died on the cross and then
[1:23:11] absolutely Christ is this message and he
[1:23:13] took me right straight to it same way
[1:23:16] with you he took you right straight to
[1:23:18] it because it's Christ working on both
[1:23:21] ends we are the seventh seal there is
[1:23:26] nothing else coming nothing else behind
[1:23:28] us we are the current revelation you and
[1:23:32] I are the seventh seal it's what God
[1:23:36] member what brother Bram's he says is
[1:23:37] one thing I wondered about all my life
[1:23:40] what do you wonder about all this life
[1:23:42] what his job was his job was to bring us
[1:23:45] to Christ not to a person we've lost

[1:27:59] believing believing what's already been
[1:28:03] said there's no new doctrine there's no
[1:28:05] new Bible there's nothing you know we
[1:28:09] spent 50 and 60 years studying the
[1:28:11] prophets message I'm glad there's not
[1:28:13] another prophet coming that we got to
[1:28:14] study another 50 60 years you know to
[1:28:16] know something else we got it all we got
[1:28:19] it all right here
[1:28:20] I believe that prophet when he spoke
[1:28:23] that was God speaking to me not you he's
[1:28:25] speaking to me okay
[1:28:27] y'all are mm-hmm no he's speaking to me
[1:28:31] well that's good you believe that you
[1:28:34] believe he spoke to you you know why cuz
[1:28:37] you responded to it and responding to it
[1:28:40] how many times have you shared the
[1:28:42] message with people and they go no okay
[1:28:44] that sounds good that's alright and then
[1:28:47] you never see them again but you might
[1:28:49] get one out of a million that comes back
[1:28:51] and says tell me a little bit more about
[1:28:53] that you know dad down at GM you got all
[1:28:56] these brothers and all that we're here
[1:28:57] you know he just starts on Michael Lord
[1:28:59] you know all of a sudden something
[1:29:01] responded to something and then you see
[1:29:05] all the ones that are here so god bless
[1:29:06] you
[1:29:07] it's cops doing the work not us but
[1:29:10] we've yielded ourselves to Christ if
[1:29:12] when you go home today you're taking
[1:29:13] Christ home with you when you go to work
[1:29:16] tomorrow you're taking Christ with when
[1:29:17] you do your job do your duty and all the
[1:29:19] different things you do you're doing it
[1:29:21] for what you're doing it for cross cuz
[1:29:22] it's costing you the hope of glory it's
[1:29:23] not Christ and you just don't Sunday and
[1:29:25] Wednesday I hope not
[1:29:27] then it's not Christ in you if it's just
[1:29:30] home Sunday Wednesday but it's Christ in
[1:29:32] you you are a living walking Messiah you
[1:29:36] have come to this earth Lord to save the
[1:29:39] world is that too strong you come to
[1:29:45] this world because if Christ in you the
[1:29:46] hope of glory the only way we're gonna
[1:29:48] get back to glory is through you Adams
[1:29:52] not here to do it
[1:29:54] Jesus Christ is not hearing human flesh
[1:29:56] to do it he's already done it but he's
[1:29:59] give it to me in you
[1:30:00] that's the secret he's give it out to me
[1:30:03] and you he didn't keep it I read that
[1:30:05] first quote he didn't keep it he gave it
[1:30:06] out to me and you so there what we can
[1:30:08] do
[1:30:09] the works of Christ call this Christ in
[1:30:12] you the hope of glory let's bow him to
[1:30:17] Heavenly Father we thank you today for

[1:30:27] be have a temporary resurrection of the
[1:30:31] of the things of God every time we open
[1:30:34] a book and every time we read the Bible
[1:30:37] and every time we even say anything
[1:30:38] about you Lord that it will be Lord
[1:30:41] rejuvenating in our in our bodies and we
[1:30:44] know we're all getting older and things
