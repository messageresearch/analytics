I've been excited about this ever since he's uh just brought it to me that morning y'all sort of kind of there Psalm Solomon 1 verse 4. it's gonna be a real short verse to my whole point this morning yeah everybody ready draw me now I'm saying Lord draw me okay that's what this is draw me we will run after thee the king hath brought me unto his Chambers we will be glad and rejoice indeed we will remember thy love more than one the upright love thee I wanted to speak on that this morning who's growing who's drawing me and uh of course if I asked anybody in here that y'all would say Well it better be word better be the Lord but that's what I'm going to talk about this morning I would like to say that a lot of people and we're talking about people in the in the world out there because I'm not sent to preach I know that I enjoy being here I enjoy being with my family fellowshipping with each and every one of y'all if I could I'd surround myself with you every day seven days a week well all of you good or bad would all work it out he'd work it out and uh I would do that if I could because I had heard a man the other day was talking about a gentleman at oding some money a little old trailer and he's always running him down trying to get his money and this Baptist comes in there and said well what can you say it's just Cannon father that's all it is so now the word he struck the Earth brother Branham the Lord come through that profit and when he struck the errors with it it wasn't a secret no more to those people that can hear and understand some of these take it and understand it by intellectual Concepts it's very very dangerous because taking the word like that will take you straight to death it will kill you or if you take it by the grace it's going to take you to eternal life and that's what I want uh I would like to go and use there's a lot of times during the day and and I've had these situations here lately for some reason brother Dale been preaching on perfect Perfection uh really kind of want to make me do a backflip when he when he read what brother Brown said about who's doing all this the Perfecter see and I mean all of that's there so but we still have something to do with it y'all don't think we we just got to step in this little red wagon he's going to pull us on through this thing it ain't gonna happen we got to get out and push that wagon fill it up with his water we got to put on a whole armor of God's word okay and so I want to go to uh Hebrews the Hebrew Book I don't know brother now that said read Hebrews what five six and seven five and six okay well I got into that last night again I tell you what I enjoyed it uh I'm gonna go to Hebrews book y'all I don't know if any of you got Hebrews but here but this is the Hebrews book y'all won't have that much got the book but I just want to read a couple of a couple of things in here um I'm gonna go to chapter five page 190. and what the prophet had to say about this come on here we go uh chapter 5 190 and I'm gonna read uh verse 41 47 through verse 150. you say well I saw God I saw God no you never saw God that's the way it was in the beginning it wasn't Adam saying no father oh Father I've sinned where are you it was father saying oh Abraham oh Adam oh Adam I'm sorry oh Adamo Adam where are you that's the nature of man that's the strain of man that's what he's made of and no man can come to me except the father draws him and all that the father gives me Hallelujah all that come I'll give them eternal life I'll raise them up at the last day what a blast what a blast promise of God Of Heaven where we get tonight uh where he swore by himself that none greater you take an oath by someone greater than you there's no one greater so God took an oath to himself we're getting into it now how he did it and when he did it and took an oath to himself and he would raise up us to make us his own Heritage his own children in other words anyway I'm gonna go to uh page 193 the same book it's kind of kind of give you an idea of how strongly he felt and about what he's doing because he's coming he's here as a brother Dallas said and the prophet he said to come means this is present he's here uh Heavenly Father seeing that we are compassed about such a great cloud of witness let us lay aside every word everything every wrong evil word every bad spoken word every thought and let us run with patience the race that set before us looking to the author and the finisher of Faith the Lord Jesus Christ oh blessed be his most matchless and holy name now that he came to Earth to redeem Fallen man and to bring them back into the Fellowship of the Lord God and we thank could be for this and now by his grace it's his grace we never chose him but he chose us he said you have not chosen me and I chose you when before the foundation of the world kind of answers all of that don't it um I wanted to to go on to that because once you see where you're at as a Christian and in your journey I think all of us kind of look back and I know I have doubts y'all I'm sorry I do but I do I have one riding down the road Satan to jump in the truck women say hey Tom where you going what are you doing I remember what you done back there today is talking to this person they got it all tangled up had a little girl was talking to about work and brother Mark had talked to her about no eternal hell and he had spoke to her and spoke to her and spoke to her now this is a child that don't know any better really um she's trying to get by in the world just like all of us do this is a this is a place where you gotta fight stay alive um her brother sometime Baptist preacher her daddy was a Baptist preacher so you start talking to him about eternal hell and they had two one long and brother Mark said brother Diane you talk to her so I was talking to her and she was standing there puffing cigarette talking to me and uh I said let me ask you a question sister just to show you where sincerity really lies and I don't want to hurt your feelings you're talking to a person that was an ex-smoker I heard this message a long time and was condemned by it but you get to a place where condemnation really wears you out and it almost a lot of times would hinder me but on the other hand it made me seek him stronger to battle that because every time I tried to quit I couldn't right couldn't do it I'm telling you out a lot rather jumped off a cliff than give up a cigarette it was that strong on me and you know I grew up with that as kids babies imagine riding down the road with your babies puffing them cigarettes well the winners rolled up in the winter time guess what's going to get in their lungs the next thing is going to go to the little brain and tranquilize that little thing up there I'm not saying it's my mom and dad's fault I did it I remember the night he said put it down it don't taste good the last one I smoked put it down it don't taste good same thing but we go down the road with this and I was talking to this little girl about it and I said well let me ask you a question I saw I wasn't getting no word with this Everlasting she didn't understand what Everlasting was she said show me in the Bible show me the Bible I said well I'll find the exact scripture for you the LED out there Lord willing well she was talking to me I said now take your smoking for example I smoke and I tell you that's just a sign of where you're at you would not though sat in your daddy's Church on the front Pew and smoke cigarette right she said well right I said well then why wouldn't you I mean if you you don't believe no more than that why wouldn't you what's telling you so don't don't claim that I'm stupid here you know it's wrong so I'm inside you is telling me is wrong but you can't handle it that's the problem the only one that can take away that stuff truly takes away is the Lord he's got to he's the only one this is his body his his restoration his vehicle he's restoring and all we got to do is carry him something to work with his word we have to put that word on it's our Shield it's our armor it's all in all it's our only way out of here it's our ticket it's our token and well that message that came and struck this Earth y'all all know that this out there for anybody yes and a lot of them get it confused I've never seen anything as confusing in my life thank God did I God knew when to bring me into it because if I'd have got into some of the things I heard y'all talking about in in past history days I said them people right there they need to go fishing and just leave this thing alone to understanding comes because that ain't the same God I know the God I know is love he starts out with love everything he does with love and he makes it right um he forgets he forgets anyway uh let me see here I wanted to go to a point where this girl once I told her that she went in and later on how their little spirits will do to kind of reinvent themselves to re-establish to prop it up with the crutches you know the Tiny Tim thing I can't get by she tells brother Mark that I told her she was going to hell love you know him brought it out I said little sister I never told you that I smoke I ain't going to hell he's already climbed on that cross and died for me he died so that I might be standing here telling you this and you're standing here they don't lie about it come on and go read Matthew 25 46 it will tell you the difference if it don't lay it out there for you I mean it's just plain and simple the Everlasting go one place those with eternal life go to another place they are two different words and the mouse went and she left but at least you'll understand you're going to talk about God we got to get his word that's the whole thing never understood it took me a long time you hear word word at this church from Brother Dale and all the other people here words well you know what that's him Gotta Have It All that's right uh and so and moving on down the road when Satan jumps in my truck tells me I ain't got nothing I ain't got this and I ain't got that and I'm gonna tell you I don't know if he does y'all that way but he does me that way there's a lot of things that won't life there's a lot of pressures that that Satan he kind of ties you down over here and he tightens you down over here and he gets you here and he gets you there and uh you know I'm just sitting there going okay what do I do he's calling me a hot dog here and you know he's going to roast me and I'm going to know you ain't because there is one thing between me and you old son and it's his word okay so just happen to have a little book laying around the house it was collecting dust y'all everybody ought to get one of these because it's a good little reader I love having it it's questions and answers volume one and I want to go in here just to show you and it's really inspirational to me to read it because if you ever have any doubts you can ask God and go back and just pick up his Bible and say Lord put me where you want me right here because this listen this is all him front to back okay everybody agrees with that right yes it's him right so anyway you go back to his word and if you don't turn that flame back up in you just stay there a little while he will because once you set the atmosphere and you ask for his help he's not just going to come in there and push you over sister Glenn and say listen I want to tell you something you got to ask him we know that I'm gonna go to a questions and answer uh this is volume one page 157. uh he said right here now we take the wrong in the word of conversation today we say that a man that's converted is a man that's stopped drinking and everything and goes to church or joins the church he might join the church but that's no sign he's converted oh no bad I don't that just means you believe in unto he isn't converted until his old life is dead and he is buried in Christ and risen with him in the resurrection of newness of life when the Holy Spirit has created now the Holy Spirit here's the dog in him a Living Hope of eternal life which comes through the Holy Ghost see to me that just lights me up because you get down to the little tiny morsel of our vocabulary of understanding that little four-letter word Nations have been saved because of that little word hope it's the Hope from the right one the hope of eternal life all of you I for me that's it's what I hang on to and I want that little friend to be a big rope and have a bucket in the bottom of where I can stand in it as he's growing I want to go to uh First Corinthians y'all can turn that if you want to if you don't it's okay uh because I got to reading in the Bible last night and I just got the I don't know sometimes I just kind of get to go a little bit everywhere I get a little scattered uh uh about God's word and I just I tell you what it's such a wonderful thing that we have what's really wonderful is that God sent a prophet to tell Don faulbush you wasn't wrong This Thing Called Life and that one that you know is believe as the Jews do is one God it is the completion of the circle of life and him coming and bringing this word right down to the perfect end that there'll be a human being standing on this Earth one day so fail with the Holy Ghost that God will come down and say I'm going to draw him right up and put the anointing and the dead in Christ arise then we'll start talking to people that's the main is that's what this whole thing is about is getting to that place I'm gonna go to First Corinthians 12 . y'all all should know it 13 and 14. he said for by one Spirit now remember he said he had seen his holy spirit for the hope of eternal life okay so now four by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body whether we be Jews or Gentiles whether we whether we be Bond or free and have all made to drink into one spirit for the body is not one member but many that kind of takes out respecter of persons down the creek don't it you're just as important this Papa Dale in this message I don't understand that when when when you when you're when you're talking to the Lord and and you're wanting to to get his help and things sometimes you know I'll be talking to him and I know all of us have the same dispensions you have to have because he's the person he's an individual he's got one way works and when you're calling on him and that that Spirit comes that anointing comes to you it's like he reaches inside your heart and he starts pulling these words and they start coming out of your mouth and you just start talking and a hundred thousand times I wish that I had a tight recorder where I could get this but it's not for that it's for me to strengthen me see it's a personal thing that's what's personal thank you I just got that and so you know if you're ever getting downtrodden and feel like you know though Devil's gonna beat you up and win all that and unless we're human we make mistakes I do uh there's times that I first come in this message I'm talking to people and I just got flocked by these Baptist preachers and they could literally eat me alive with scripture but when he come on the scene I'd stand there A lot of times I'd listen to them listen to them listen to them listen to them and they'd be rambling on with all these quotes and stuff and I'd start a word and then finish it I'd start something over here they'd finish it the scripture you know but when the Lord come on the scene no did that to him and I said two or three things to them and they back up like this and stand there and look at me some of them one of them really it brought something very special to me so my wife has cancer would you please pray for her right here he brought her that shot that's Lord he's drawing me that's right he's drawing all of us he's got the same pressure on you and you and you and you and all of us because we're all his children he's collecting okay it's not collecting antiques that's right we're gonna be better than we ever was foreign I kind of got off my word here a little bit but I wanted to to go on in some things that that we can see God in his word and to see him in his word so we'll recognize and understand who he is and uh not get fooled by that old silver tongue impersonator we have to back everything up by his word and uh so the only way we'll ever know him is through his word and seeing his word come from Sister June Sister Lisa sister tree my wife oh yes I said my wife she's my conscience most of the time if I could not lied on something trust me she don't have no problem telling me about it and that's a good thing because you know you have a atmosphere last night I want to say this because we're getting kind of close and uh and I probably I wanted to read some of the Ephesians but I want to get to my point um I'm gonna go ahead and turn over to Ephesians 5 right quick um why do I do this oh here we go I I could not uh I'm gonna go to uh Ephesians 4 29 through five two y'all ready uh 429 let no corrupt communication proceed out of your mouth but that which is good to use of edifying that it may Minister grace to the years now for me this makes a big thing because uh like I said I'm not called a preach so I know that my place and my Pulpit is out in the world dealing with people he said go out there call them turn the Rocks over see what's under them I ain't afraid of no serpents tell me I'm not there's nothing there except the boo and grieve not the Holy Spirit whereby we are sealed unto the day of redemption let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be ye kind I love this be kind to one another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God forgave Christ's sake hath forgiven us be therefore followers of God as dear children and walk into love as Christ also have loved us and have given himself for us an offering and a sacrifice to God for a sweet smelling savior folks if you don't feel special reading that I don't know what to tell you I really don't take that take this take the part take take one part of it and hold on to it mine is by Stripes I'm Healed I want the whole thing healed I want to be walking again in that 20 year old body I remembered I could just knock out five miles real quick didn't worry about no cars I could get there just about as fast without a car no insurance no gas I enjoyed it uh and I wanted to stand up to one more thing here in order to talk to you and then we're going to go uh I want to ask y'all a question you don't hear a lot about it but we hear it when the only one we preach ourselves but do you realize that all of us here where have got to be the manifestation of those those combat beasts understand we got to be the lion of the private Judah that says there is one God one true and living God his name is Jesus Christ and then we got to be like that Ox that says yes I'm a sinner saved by the blood of grace through faith and then we got to have that of the man that says be as wise as a serpent and as harmless as a dove when we deal with other people but yet we have to have a knowledge of our environment before we live and what day we're in the prophet has already said it uh brother Mark and I was talking and I want to Lord willing if he don't do it I am but he had nine things that he said what happened I want to try to touch into those sometimes because I've got a little pamphlet up there's an old pamphlet that I got from daddy's stuff that shows the prophecies from 1933 and they're always good to go back and read them because you can see listen what's going to happen all right we're close folks that's right very close you know why I know we're close because I'm getting close I feel close to God I want to get closer right I ain't near as close as I should be okay just like that lady said I ain't where I used to be right and I ain't where I want to be but I'm glad I'm where I'm at that's right but then when we speak to others about him we must remember that if we're talking to people outside it's good to talk to them brother Brown was very specific about certain things that he talked about walking into that that bar that morning well that scene that was going on there and it just said he was saying the Lord last this wipe them all out of course y'all know the story a little spear coming in front of him started throwing that blood around and covering everything that he done and he wound up praying for that little lady that sister right there in that flow got down on his knees and had a prayer session he said and that's what we got to be that's what a combat base would be and also number four it's part I love is a the prophecy fulfilling the prophecy that we all got to walk into we cannot just reach out there and say we're in the message it's too far gone for this church too many things have been preached and said reality is knowing who you are that you have you know what perfect is you know what it is to go through that process of perfection and now we know who draws us and for me I say Amen because they don't get any better than that let's just keep walking in the word y'all already go up and have dinner I hope you all enjoyed it thank you I enjoyed doing it thank you Lord amen amen
