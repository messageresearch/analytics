[0:00] good to be in the house of the
[0:03] Lord I don't have any slides this
[0:05] morning but we'll just look at 1
[0:06] Corinthians chapter 7 kind of where we
[0:08] left off last time and just a read
[0:10] through so if you want to turn in your
[0:11] Bible to 1 Corinthians chapter 7 and
[0:14] we'll we'll turn down to about verse 17
[0:17] and just read
[0:18] through Lord God we're so grateful to be
[0:20] able to gather together in around your
[0:22] word this morning Lord so thank you Lord
[0:24] for sending us a a messenger in this
[0:27] last day to to patch up all the Loose
[0:29] Ends and and and to give us something to
[0:32] defeat the enemy with Lord I pray God
[0:34] that you'll just help us this morning
[0:36] Lord as we walk through these scriptures
[0:37] Lord that you'll give us strength and
[0:39] encouragement Lord be with us today Lord
[0:41] God that you'll be in the house of God
[0:44] be with us to give us light on on these
[0:46] words that we read we ask now in your
[0:49] precious name
[0:51] [Music]
[0:53] amen now Paul so in in verse 17 he says
[0:58] But as God has hath distributed to every
[1:03] man as the Lord hath called everyone so
[1:07] let him walk and so ordain I in all
[1:11] churches now you think everybody in in
[1:14] the building this morning has come from
[1:16] different backgrounds and has has a
[1:18] different you know different vocations
[1:20] and and you know when you really start
[1:23] to meditate on it it's it's so odd that
[1:25] even sometimes even when you're when you
[1:28] are a sinner that God can begin to frame
[1:30] it up your life so that the the things
[1:33] that you like you know somebody might be
[1:35] in a club playing a piano or something
[1:37] but then when they get saved now God can
[1:40] use that that uh what they've learned to
[1:43] play in the piano now he's moving it
[1:46] into uh using it for the for God's glory
[1:49] so he what what what he's saying is
[1:51] don't abandon your vocation don't uh you
[1:55] know if you're a teacher don't try to
[1:56] change that if you're a a a uh you know
[1:59] what whatever God has called you to be
[2:01] in life then don't because now you're a
[2:04] Christian don't don't change things up
[2:05] just because that now you're uh now
[2:08] you're a Christian to try to be try to
[2:10] be different every person has been given
[2:12] a unique calling and a set of
[2:14] circumstances by God so regardless of
[2:17] your situation your background or the
[2:20] specific abilities you've received just
[2:22] walk in the role that God has
[2:23] specifically assigned to you now I like
[2:26] you know if you go read that the little
[2:28] strange book in the Bible I might not
[2:30] pronounce it right some say fimon and
[2:33] fimon and it's a story about a little
[2:36] slave named onesimus that that uh that
[2:39] he he's he's a slave and he runs away to
[2:42] try to get get away from his slave owner
[2:44] and and while he's away he gets he runs
[2:47] into Paul and Paul uh tells him about
[2:49] the gospel and he gets saved and Paul
[2:51] tells him well go on back home and and
[2:54] just keep get being a witness go back
[2:56] home to your slave master what a strange
[2:58] thing for somebody to do go don't don't
[3:00] try to change things you go back home
[3:03] and and now you'll be a witness and and
[3:05] you can so he wrote that letter uh to to
[3:08] filimon fimon and and uh kind of shaming
[3:12] him and and and he's sending back the
[3:14] one that ran away from him and so Paul's
[3:17] saying what you everybody's got their
[3:19] own little role in in life and things
[3:21] and you don't have to change things up
[3:23] to be a Christian but you can be you can
[3:24] be a Christian at work you you don't
[3:26] have to get another job you don't have
[3:28] to change things like of course now now
[3:31] let's let's be real if your job is
[3:33] something that a Christian would not do
[3:35] then you would you would have to change
[3:37] things up but look in 1 Corinthians
[3:39] chapter 12 if you jump ahead he saying
[3:41] now you are the body of Christ and
[3:43] members in
[3:44] particular and God has set some in the
[3:47] church first apostles second ear
[3:49] prophets thirdly teachers after that
[3:51] Miracles then Gifts of healing helps and
[3:54] I love how he's framing this up cuz
[3:56] normally we we'll we'll we'll jump to
[3:58] you got a roll in the church and and we
[4:01] we automatically jump to the five-fold
[4:03] ministry and if you're not a minister
[4:05] then well you know you're going to have
[4:07] to you know just but look he's he's
[4:09] saying people in the church have gifts
[4:11] of healings and helps and there's Gifts
[4:13] of government and diversities of tongue
[4:16] tongues and are all Apostles are are all
[4:19] prophets are all teachers are all
[4:20] workers of Miracles no he's saying he's
[4:23] saying everybody has their own role to
[4:25] do and and and you God will put you in
[4:28] your role in life to a homemaker or uh
[4:32] or or just somebody that can make bake
[4:35] cakes for somebody and and and give a
[4:37] word of encouragement and everybody's
[4:38] got their role to do and he he's saying
[4:40] have have all the gifts of healing do
[4:42] all speak with tongues do all interpret
[4:44] but cover earnestly the best gifts and
[4:47] then he's then of course he's framing it
[4:49] up as he goes into 1 Corinthians 13 that
[4:51] we'll get to a little bit later yet I
[4:54] show you unto you a more excellent way
[4:56] so despite all our jobs all our roles
[4:58] all our activities all the things that
[5:00] we can do now let let's look at love in
[5:03] 1 Corinthians 13 you you think you you
[5:05] know you got a good job or whatever but
[5:07] do you do you love do you think you know
[5:09] everything you think if you've got all
[5:12] knowledge all these things but what
[5:13] about love now so back to 1 Corinthians
[5:17] 7 God has distributed to every man so if
[5:20] if we look at that really what he's
[5:22] framing up is is is is be content with
[5:24] what you are don't compare yourself to
[5:26] others don't try to change your
[5:28] situation and then the attempt to be a
[5:30] better Christian like in 2 Corinthians
[5:33] 10:2 he says for we dare not make
[5:37] ourselves of the number or compare
[5:39] ourselves with some that commend
[5:42] themselves but they measuring themselves
[5:44] by themselves and comparing themselves
[5:47] among themselves are not Wise It's not
[5:51] wise to compare yourself with one
[5:53] another or or to you know that one of
[5:57] the one of the greatest examples in the
[5:58] Bible was
[6:00] is where you've got the 12 Hebrew
[6:02] children Simeon and Judah and so forth
[6:06] and they've all you think about when
[6:08] they were born their mother actually
[6:10] prophesied where they would be placed in
[6:12] the promised land and each of them had
[6:14] their own particular role that they were
[6:16] going to do but then Here Comes Joseph
[6:19] and he got a coat of many colors and
[6:21] they all got jealous and envious because
[6:23] he had a different role that he was
[6:25] going to play even though each of them
[6:27] had their own part to play they got
[6:30] jealous and tossed him in a whale and
[6:33] and so that's why in Galatians chap 6:4
[6:36] it says but let every man prove his own
[6:38] work and then shall he have rejoicing in
[6:41] himself alone and not in
[6:44] another in Proverbs 14:30 says a sound
[6:47] heart is the life of the flesh but Envy
[6:50] the rotness of the bones what what's
[6:53] Paul saying God has distributed to every
[6:56] man as the Lord ha called everyone so
[6:59] let him walk and so ordain I in all
[7:01] churches just walk in the way that God
[7:03] has called you and be
[7:05] content in the life story brother Ry
[7:08] said they sent me a milliion 500,000 and
[7:10] a b Bank draft two agents brought
[7:13] it me living in a two room Shanty at the
[7:16] time but it's not money what makes
[7:19] happiness happiness doesn't consist of
[7:21] how much of the world's Goods you own
[7:24] but how contented you are with the
[7:26] portion that has been lotted to you just
[7:28] make your self contented as long as one
[7:31] thing that brings contentment and that
[7:33] alone is Jesus Christ Now isn't that
[7:37] something that if you got Jesus Christ
[7:38] it don't matter if you're a doormat in
[7:40] the church it don't matter if nobody
[7:42] else likes you that if you really lock
[7:44] into that that secret that Jesus Christ
[7:47] is the secret to that secret inward joy
[7:50] that when nobody else likes you when
[7:52] everybody's talking bad about you if you
[7:54] got Jesus that's all that matters really
[7:56] to a Christian and the patmas vision he
[7:59] said have you ever noticed how sweet and
[8:02] relaxing the sound of water can be he
[8:05] said I like to fish and I like to find a
[8:07] spot where the water is whispering in
[8:08] ripples I can just lie back and hear it
[8:11] speaking peace and joy and contentment
[8:14] to my heart now that's what's happening
[8:16] when you when you look at lock into
[8:18] these scriptures or just sit back and
[8:20] listen to like what we're just listening
[8:22] to brother brandom it it speaks joy and
[8:24] contentment just like a Rippling water
[8:27] and that's that's all you need to be
[8:29] Happ happy how glad I am to be anchored
[8:31] in the Haven of Rest where the voice of
[8:33] the Lord speaks peace as the word of the
[8:36] Waters of Separation hath declared just
[8:39] be content in Christ now Verse 18 says
[8:44] is any man called being
[8:48] circumcised let him not become
[8:51] uncircumcised now now if we really
[8:53] meditate on this this is this is a
[8:55] little bit strange what Paul is saying
[8:57] here all this time the the the Jews or
[9:00] or you know the people that he's
[9:01] speaking to had framed up their view of
[9:03] of coming to God is based on these Old
[9:06] Testament laws and the outward work and
[9:09] that's the same way that many people
[9:12] come to church with this Viewpoint that
[9:14] I've got to work something up I've got
[9:16] to do something on the outside I've got
[9:17] to please God by the only way I can be
[9:20] justified is by doing something on the
[9:22] outside washing up the outside and they
[9:25] don't worry about the inside so this is
[9:28] what Paul is speaking to
[9:30] is any man called being circumcised let
[9:31] him not become UNC
[9:33] uncircumcised is any called an
[9:35] uncircumcision let him not be
[9:37] circumcised circumcision is nothing and
[9:40] uncircumcision is nothing but the
[9:43] keeping of The Commandments of God let
[9:46] every man abide in the same calling
[9:49] wherein he was called you know he what
[9:52] he what he's doing is he's framing up
[9:54] that what counts is not your and this is
[9:57] maybe contrary to the way that many even
[9:59] message Believers might look is what
[10:02] counts is not your external appearance
[10:05] or your ritual compliance your keeping
[10:08] of some like a bullet list of rules and
[10:11] things but your obedience to keeping of
[10:13] God's Commandments because of an inward
[10:16] change it's your inner
[10:19] transformation and your continued
[10:21] faithful living your fruits that Define
[10:23] your Christian life now now Paul would
[10:25] Echo that in Romans chapter 2 verse 28
[10:30] if if you're writing scriptures down
[10:32] Romans 2:28 where he says for he is not
[10:35] a
[10:36] Jew which is one
[10:40] outwardly now this we could say the same
[10:42] thing today about a Christian you're not
[10:43] a Christian that's just outwardly you're
[10:47] not a Christian because you come to
[10:48] church and you wear long hair and and
[10:51] you wear a dress sisters or because a
[10:53] man changes his appearance to fit in
[10:57] that's not what what makes you a
[10:58] Christian where now you got your your
[11:01] check box where you can check off well
[11:02] I've done this I've done that I've done
[11:04] this it's not a Christ you're not a Jew
[11:08] which outwardly neither is that
[11:10] circumcision which is outward in the
[11:12] flesh but he is a Jew which is one
[11:16] inwardly and circumcision is that of the
[11:20] heart and the spirit and not in the
[11:23] letter not just learning some rules and
[11:27] some things that you're going to follow
[11:29] it's not it's not in that whose praise
[11:32] is not of men but of God you see you
[11:35] outwardly circumcision of the flesh you
[11:39] you can get a lot of praise and pats on
[11:41] the back from men but what about praise
[11:44] from God God is looking at the heart
[11:47] like when when he selected David and
[11:50] bypassed to all the others because he's
[11:52] looking at the heart the little little
[11:53] scrawny fellow that everybody would
[11:55] bypass where where the men of Israel
[11:58] chose Saul that that was a head and
[11:59] shoulders above everybody else it looks
[12:01] good on the outside but on the inside
[12:03] what is it now now this is the this is
[12:06] the thing that stumbles it stumbled
[12:07] people for for for years that people
[12:09] even today critics of the message think
[12:12] well you're you're just keeping a lot of
[12:14] book rules and you're kind of like a
[12:16] cult or something where you got a lot of
[12:18] Rules and Things and if you don't keep
[12:20] the rules that you're out it's because
[12:22] of fundamental misunderstanding of what
[12:24] the message is the gospel is not to give
[12:27] us a list of rules that we keep
[12:29] outwardly and then in inside we can just
[12:31] act whatever or inside we can hate our
[12:33] brother and inside we we don't forgive
[12:35] but it's an inward
[12:37] transformation when when God gets a hold
[12:39] of your life and the power of the Gospel
[12:41] begins to change you you're changed
[12:43] inwardly and then that begins to
[12:44] manifest
[12:46] outwardly now that's what's caused a lot
[12:49] of stumbling over scriptures like in in
[12:51] in Deuteronomy 225 the scripture that
[12:54] says talk tells women how to how how
[12:58] we're supposed to supposed to dress and
[13:00] and that that scripture says now now
[13:02] let's frame it up what we're talking
[13:04] about are we just keeping rules or or
[13:07] are we talking about an inward
[13:10] transformation in Deuteronomy 22:5 it
[13:13] says the woman shall not wear that which
[13:15] pertaineth unto a
[13:17] man neither shall a man put on a woman's
[13:20] garment for all that do so are
[13:22] Abomination unto the Lord thy God
[13:26] now excuse me what does this have to do
[13:30] with what Paul's talking about
[13:31] circumcision it's the it's exactly the
[13:34] same thing the the Jews thought as long
[13:36] as I can keep this outward demonstration
[13:38] and don't change anything on the inside
[13:40] then I'm I'm all right now so PA Paul's
[13:44] in the Old Testament what we the
[13:47] question comes up sometimes why why why
[13:51] are there some Old Testament scriptures
[13:55] that are still applicable
[13:57] today and others that are not now let's
[14:01] think about that for a
[14:02] second why why do we not still sacrifice
[14:05] bulls and goats and you don't have to
[14:07] why do we not have to sacri sacrifice a
[14:09] bulock it's because those things were
[14:12] fulfilled in Christ right why do we not
[14:16] why do we not have to uh have a high
[14:18] priest and have have have a priest in
[14:21] that role that are doing all the temple
[14:23] things and you have to bring some turtle
[14:24] doves every time you you you you do
[14:27] something wrong that requires the
[14:29] sacrifice of a turtle of is because
[14:31] there are the Old Testament law could be
[14:34] divided into three different areas
[14:35] ceremonial that's fulfilled in Christ
[14:38] the the ritualistic sacrifices and the
[14:41] garments of the high priest and the
[14:42] priest and so forth civil that the laws
[14:45] that kind of govern how the the Jewish
[14:48] Nation the Israelite nation was governed
[14:51] of course the Israelite Nation we're not
[14:53] part of that Nation anymore so those
[14:54] things we can kind of lay over to the
[14:56] side but then the moral law that tells
[15:00] how the inward nature of a person is
[15:02] supposed to act you got the Ten
[15:04] Commandments honor thy father and thy
[15:05] mother and and uh Worship the Lord thy
[15:08] God with all thy heart and all thy soul
[15:09] and those things are th those you
[15:12] because they illustrate the nature of
[15:15] God and God is unchanging he's the same
[15:19] yesterday today and forever those things
[15:22] are consistent and run all the way
[15:24] through the Bible and so when it says
[15:26] that all that do so all that all that
[15:30] crossdress are an Abomination unto the
[15:33] Lord thy God that illustrates the
[15:37] unchanging nature of God that God always
[15:40] and forever will regard a crossdresser
[15:44] as an
[15:45] Abomination whether it was 6,000 years
[15:48] ago 5,000 4,000 or whether it was 10
[15:52] minutes ago God will always regard a
[15:55] crossdresser as an Abomination unto the
[15:57] Lord and so to fix that though it's not
[16:01] an outward well I I got to I got to meet
[16:03] this requirement on the outside that's
[16:06] not satisfactory you got to be changed
[16:09] and transformed by the blood of the Lamb
[16:12] applied to you where his life is
[16:14] actually applied to your life and
[16:15] changes your desires because if you're
[16:18] doing it unwillingly or you're just
[16:20] coerced into it well that will never
[16:22] work but if you're doing it because God
[16:24] has changed you to to love him and and
[16:26] to desire to follow him and to to to to
[16:29] line up with his word then that's a
[16:31] totally different
[16:33] matter you know and I'm going to sit on
[16:36] this for a little
[16:37] bit crossdressing is when a person wears
[16:41] clothing and adopts Styles or
[16:43] appearances traditionally associated
[16:45] with the opposite sex for example a man
[16:48] wearing women's dresses and makeup or a
[16:51] woman dressing in traditionally
[16:53] masculine clothing to intentionally
[16:55] present as male you remember the story
[16:57] brother Ram told about how he was on the
[16:59] on the bus and he he was joking around
[17:02] with an old minor or what a construction
[17:04] worker or whatever slapped him on the
[17:07] knee and then realized that it wasn't a
[17:10] man it was a woman and he said I'm so
[17:14] sorry because you look the the frame
[17:17] that God has put together is that you
[17:19] should be able to tell the difference
[17:22] there is a difference and when he was
[17:24] slapping the ma the the knee of that man
[17:27] it's because he thought it was a man
[17:29] he couldn't tell the difference and and
[17:31] and real
[17:33] Holiness the real Godly pattern is to
[17:36] tell a difference and and the reason why
[17:38] we should be able to tell the difference
[17:40] is because there is a difference and the
[17:43] modern world wants us to think that
[17:45] there's no difference between a man and
[17:47] a woman well a woman can be a marine but
[17:50] but fact of the matter is a woman just
[17:52] is not going to be able to do push-ups
[17:54] and pull-ups and run and and so forth
[17:56] like a man and she might be able to do a
[17:59] job but she'll never because there's a
[18:00] difference she will never be able to do
[18:03] in the same capacity as a man she'll
[18:05] never have the strength in her body and
[18:07] and and and and many things that a man
[18:09] cannot do that a woman can because
[18:11] they're just different and so there's
[18:14] that's the pattern that God set up from
[18:16] the beginning is there's a difference
[18:18] and when when the devil wants to lap
[18:20] them things over and and and and cross
[18:22] them over so that you can't tell the
[18:24] difference you know I've been on the
[18:27] subway in Atlanta and I've seen
[18:28] everything thing in the world of say men
[18:29] wearing dresses and and all the other
[18:32] thing and and it it creates a chaos cu
[18:35] the Devils that Au through chaos it
[18:36] creates this this this situation where
[18:39] you're there's just a bunch of
[18:40] confusion so this prohibition against
[18:44] crossdressing isn't just about following
[18:46] a set of arbitrary rules it reflects a
[18:49] divinely inspired principle that the
[18:52] roles the character and the appearance
[18:56] of men and women are meant to be
[19:02] distinct men and women are
[19:05] different boy y'all should be really
[19:07] pulling on this this morning y'all
[19:09] praise God brother Bob this is this is
[19:11] what I believe it is what you believe is
[19:14] it so you know you look at all the
[19:17] different the ways that men men and
[19:19] women are different men men have higher
[19:21] levels of testosterone so they're going
[19:22] to have more muscle mass broader
[19:24] shoulders thicker skin facial and body
[19:28] hair uh who was it preaching recently
[19:30] said if if I look at a woman and she's
[19:32] got an Adam's apple it's it's because
[19:35] it's something's something's something
[19:36] strange something's off a deeper voice
[19:38] cuz you got those larger vocal cords and
[19:41] women have higher levels of estrogen and
[19:43] progesterone so they're going to have
[19:45] they're going to be made for for child
[19:47] rearing and child birth and they're
[19:48] going to be designed so that they can
[19:50] love up on those children and raise them
[19:52] and things and they're going to have
[19:54] it's just different and Men even in
[19:56] their brain we are brains we got more
[19:58] Gra matter and and women and of course I
[20:00] don't really know what that means but
[20:02] all I know is that women women have more
[20:05] white matter and they you know they say
[20:07] that's connect link to connectivity
[20:09] between brain regions and so maybe you
[20:11] could dive into that and and and figure
[20:13] out what that means and everything but
[20:15] but men men are designed biologically
[20:17] for strength and provision and
[20:19] Leadership roles and women are designed
[20:22] for nurturing and childbearing and and
[20:24] relational bonding and and God aren't
[20:27] you glad God made us that way so that we
[20:29] ain't all the same and that's what
[20:31] Paul's speaking to we all have our own
[20:33] roles in life and we're all have our our
[20:35] differences that God made us this way
[20:37] and and there's a difference between men
[20:39] and women and that's why we dress
[20:40] different that's why we look different
[20:42] and that's why our women have got to
[20:44] look
[20:45] modest and so in 1 Timothy chap
[20:48] 2:9 Paul tells us that New Testament
[20:52] scripture he says in like manner also
[20:55] that women Adorn themselves in modest
[20:59] apparel now let's think about what he
[21:02] say modest apparel with
[21:05] shamefacedness and soety not with
[21:09] broaded hair now he's he's contrasting
[21:13] how women of the world W want to doll
[21:16] themselves up but a real Christian woman
[21:19] all she needs is her character and and
[21:22] and any young man that's looking for a
[21:24] wife or something will realize that's
[21:26] what I'm really looking for I ain't
[21:28] looking for somebody that's all doled up
[21:29] with a bunch of fake makeup on her face
[21:31] or that's that's that's trying to
[21:33] present herself in a way that represents
[21:35] the values of the world but I want
[21:37] somebody like Esther that all she come
[21:39] out to when she come before the king all
[21:41] she have was her character and that was
[21:43] enough to be queen of all Persia that
[21:46] was enough her character in like manner
[21:48] also that women Adorn themselves in
[21:50] modest apparel with shamefacedness and
[21:52] sobriety not with broided hair or gold
[21:56] or pearls or costly array
[21:59] but which becometh women professing
[22:03] godliness with good works that's all a
[22:06] Christian woman wants now what what is
[22:09] Modesty though modesty is the practice
[22:12] of dressing acting and speaking in a way
[22:16] that is humble decent and not intended
[22:21] to draw improper or excessive attention
[22:25] to oneself now now look you you go I I
[22:29] ride the subway in Atlanta and and there
[22:31] there wasn't a modest person on the
[22:33] subway everybody's wanting to draw
[22:35] attention to themselves and in this
[22:38] modern world it's it's like we I was
[22:40] sitting in the car with my wife and my
[22:42] family yesterday as we were just riding
[22:44] around and we were looking at people
[22:45] going in and out of Walmart and we're
[22:47] just like the world has gone insane
[22:50] because the all sense of modesty has
[22:53] totally been just tossed into the bin
[22:56] the the world it's like how you would
[22:58] have to be insane to put on the clothes
[23:00] that people are wearing where you can
[23:02] see well just you can see everything and
[23:05] to go into Walmart like that in your
[23:07] pajamas every just fly on an airplane in
[23:10] your pajamas with everything out so now
[23:13] now that's that's the opposite of
[23:15] modesty modesty is not trying to attract
[23:18] attention to yourself and and and the
[23:21] definition of it
[23:22] especially in terms of sexual attraction
[23:27] or vanity
[23:29] now there's modest when Paul says
[23:32] dress Adorn yourself in modest apparel
[23:35] that is the definition of how a real
[23:38] Christian woman should dress that when a
[23:41] man when a carnal man with that beastly
[23:43] nature that has not been changed by the
[23:46] Holy Ghost when he looks on you he's not
[23:48] he you're covered up and you cover up
[23:51] because out in the world that there's
[23:54] all these carnal beastly men that are
[23:57] going to look look at you that way if
[24:00] you don't cover up and so the point of
[24:03] all these things is that the gospel the
[24:05] gospel is not just a book of rules that
[24:07] we're following it's not just a list a
[24:10] bullet list you know when I'm at work
[24:11] I'm in a meeting we make a list of stuff
[24:13] I got to do action items and it ain't it
[24:16] ain't action items that we're trying to
[24:18] check off but it's God coming and
[24:20] transforming our heart to changes now in
[24:24] Matthew chap 23: 25-28 Jesus said woe
[24:27] unto you scribes and Pharisees
[24:29] Hypocrites for you make clean the
[24:32] outside of the cup and of the platter
[24:33] but within they are full of extortion
[24:35] and
[24:36] excess now blind
[24:39] Pharisee it you're you're blind if
[24:41] you're just doing it by a book of rules
[24:43] and you're blind if you think that's
[24:45] what other people are
[24:47] doing you ever you ever see the critic
[24:49] they'll come in come in church and they
[24:51] think because the that's the way they're
[24:53] doing it that's the way everybody else
[24:54] is doing it too this was this is M must
[24:58] be the way that everybody else thinks
[24:59] about things no Thou blind Pharisee
[25:03] cleanse first that which is within the
[25:05] cup and platter that the outside of them
[25:07] may be clean also woe unto you scribes
[25:10] and Pharisees Hypocrites for ye are like
[25:13] unto whed supplers which indeed appear
[25:16] beautiful outward but are within full of
[25:21] dead men's bones and of all
[25:24] uncleanness even so ye also outwardly
[25:27] appear righteous unto me men but within
[25:29] ye are full of hypocrisy and
[25:36] iniquity it's the holy spirit that
[25:38] changes us brother Rand would tell the
[25:41] story and and I'm going to close here in
[25:43] just a
[25:44] moment of of of uh he he he talked about
[25:48] how when he was preaching over in Africa
[25:49] he'd said young ladies standing there
[25:51] just in the bloom of life and and they'd
[25:54] be
[25:55] naked imagine a prophet preaching in
[25:57] Africa
[25:59] to people sitting there that were like
[26:02] legit
[26:03] naked but what what reaction would
[26:06] happen when the Holy Ghost get a hold of
[26:07] them he said they didn't know it that
[26:09] was more no more shame to them than
[26:11] looking at your
[26:13] hand now what he's framing up is they
[26:15] didn't know they were naked and if you
[26:18] told them they were naked they would not
[26:20] believe you but when the Holy Ghost got
[26:23] a hold of them it changed
[26:25] everything you could even tell them they
[26:28] were naked and they were
[26:30] no but the Holy Ghost changes
[26:34] everything that was no more shame to
[26:36] them than looking at your hand young 16
[26:37] 18 20 year old girls mothers with their
[26:40] babies nursing and not 20 ft from where
[26:42] I was sitting a mother give birth to a
[26:45] baby while I was talking another lady
[26:48] just helped it she just picked the baby
[26:50] up and started nursing the baby another
[26:52] lady next to him started this lady's
[26:54] given birth this lady jumps in to help
[26:57] picks up the baby start started nursing
[26:58] it right there in the
[27:01] meeting went on listening to me preach
[27:04] and those young ladies standing there
[27:07] fully formed and developed women and
[27:09] when the Holy Spirit came no sooner than
[27:12] he struck them they cover themselves
[27:15] with their arms the Holy Spirit brings a
[27:20] realization of
[27:23] nakedness and I'll read this other quote
[27:26] and then we'll uh the musicians go ahead
[27:28] and come forward he said now how can we
[27:29] sisters how can we in this nation where
[27:32] we claim to believe and be Christians
[27:34] and every year they take more off when
[27:36] that person never even heard the name of
[27:38] Christ but just accepted him in their
[27:40] heart no you couldn't tell them they
[27:41] were naked they didn't know it but they
[27:43] covered themselves up like this to walk
[27:45] away the next day or two you would find
[27:48] them with clothes on of some
[27:51] kind now that's Africa and then he
[27:54] brings it home to America there is
[27:57] something wrong
[27:59] somewhere it's a twisting up of theology
[28:02] the power of the resurrection of Jesus
[28:05] Christ like he did to the man who called
[28:07] Legion we found him clothed and in his
[28:10] right mind and I begin to believe that
[28:13] it's a spirit upon the people that
[28:14] drives them into that americanism and
[28:17] frenchis and all kinds of worldism and
[28:19] churchism but let them once come to the
[28:22] master and they feel that knock at the
[28:25] door they'll put clothes on and act like
[28:28] like women and men and they'll be born
[28:31] again Christians let me ask you this
[28:33] question why is a Christian modest well
[28:36] we're checking things off our list and
[28:38] we got to do it or else we'll get
[28:39] scolded at church like like a good pH
[28:42] the Pharisees would go around coning
[28:44] people upside the head in the day that
[28:46] they lived and if you didn't match up to
[28:48] their uh the the way that they thought
[28:50] that you should be living but that's not
[28:52] why a Christian modest is modest a
[28:53] Christian is modest because the Holy
[28:56] Ghost has a nature and when you receive
[28:59] the Holy Ghost you receive that nature
[29:02] and the nature now is living in you and
[29:05] your desires and your wants and the way
[29:08] that you are changes because the Holy
[29:11] Ghost is in the business of changing
[29:13] things God bless you Saints
[29:17] [Applause]
