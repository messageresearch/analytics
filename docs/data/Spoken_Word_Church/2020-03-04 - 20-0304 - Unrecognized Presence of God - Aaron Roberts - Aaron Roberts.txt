I'm gonna read from the book of Job chapter 14 very familiar scripture here so before we read the scripture let's just bow our heads and speak to the author our gracious Heavenly Father Lord Jesus we

and Lord we just commit it all to you tonight we'll just lead us and guide us and all things Lord in the name of Jesus Christ we could commit it to you amen amen god bless you and from job chapter 14 very firm very familiar Scripture and my title is unrecognized presence of God and I want to look at unrecognized growth and and you know I thought about the spiritual growth and you know we look at things in our in our lives and we see situations happening and we don't see God moving and even even you know the natural types of spiritual we you know even in the natural we see things and we we look at things a certain way and we don't even realize what God's actually doing something even in the even in the natural world and you know it's the same way in the spiritual we don't see these things but he said for there is hope of a tree if it be cut down that it will sprout again and that the tender branch Darrell will not cease though the root thereof wax old and the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water it will bud and bring forth bowels like a plant but am and I've been wasted the way yeh man giveth up the ghost and where he is he as the water spell from the sea and the flood to camp and drive so man left down and rises not till the heavens be no more they shall they shall not awake nor be raised out of their sleep o that thou would would hide me in the grave and thou wouldest keep me secret until their wrath be passed and thou wouldest appoint me a set time and remember me said if a man die shall he live again all the days of my appointed time will I wait too much change come amen god bless you tonight y'all gotta pray for me sometimes oh I don't know me and brother Bob have leaky heads sometimes brother snap one time that leaky heads rarely swell but uh you know sometimes you just get stirred up sometimes you don't know you don't know what to do you just it just stirs you up sometimes and y'all just pray for me not I don't know how this is gonna go but I you know I just want to I just want to look at one thought is the presence of God being unrecognized God wants us to recognize what's going on and what God has a plan and a purpose in our life and you know I wanted to go back to the scripture because we look at this and it says for there is a hope of a tree though it be cut down and you know you look at a tree and if it dies or if he gets kind of down if there's still life in the and the roots of that tree poppin it may be mean but if but if that tree is in the if there's real life in that we're in the root of that tree no matter what happens to it it'll live again and it talks about even if it goes away and it says you know in order to look at this point that job's talking about it being though it said just the scent of water that's all it takes is just the scent of water and you know I want to get into some things I was reading the article sometime back and it just it just it just struck me and you know what we look at some of these things that just that scent of water and it'll sprout it'll move and you know that's the way things are in the spiritual but you know we're waiting but you know God's moving but you know we miss God moving and we fail to see that he's here we said we fail to see that God's presence is in our midst and you know the scripture tells us in Matthew 6 you know you know what God says is eternal it's--yeah amen and whatever he says you don't have to doubt it you don't have you don't have to worry about what he says because if it's if he says it he backs it it because there's two immutable things that he can't lie and he's gotten him and he swore an oath that he would fulfill his word so the thing is is you and our beneficiaries tonight of what he has said so you know what the thing is we don't have to worry we don't have to fret because the same God that created created all things created you brought you had you had you in the end the baton the foreknowledge of his mind that knew all these things that brought you here tonight and knew all about you he knows your needs before you even asked him and and I just wonder I just want to read this scripture here Matthew 6 verse 24 says no man can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will hold to the one and despise the other he cannot sir you cannot serve God and Mammon therefore I say unto you take no thought for your life what you shall eat or what shall drink nor yet for your body what ye shall put on is not the life more than meat and the body more than raiment behold the fowls of the air for they sow not neither do they reap nor do they nor gather into barns yet your heavenly Father feedeth them are ye not much better than they which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto your stature and why take ye thought for raiment consider the lilies of the field how they grow they told not neither do they spin and yet I say that even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these therefore if God so clothe the grass of the field which today is and tomorrow is cast into the oven shall he not much more clothe you O ye of faith now read what he said ain't some about all these things he says even if you have little faith even if you're weakened and your faith he said all these things are still he still do these things for you he said therefore take no Thought saying what shall we eat or what shall we drink or wherewithal for all these things do the Gentiles seek for your heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things but seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things shall be added unto you take therefore no thought for the morrow for the morrow shall take thought for the things of itself suffice unto the day is the evil thereof well if it pops too much I'll just use a handheld will that work okay if it pops too much I'll let me know I can get a it will work better this way well if it pops too much I don't mind I'll use I had my old or whatever all right bridge all right but no I don't want to bail the element if it's if it's problem okay just let me know I'm easy to get along with they say sometimes but yo yeah don't ask her don't ask her or your study buddy in the waters doing anyway but you know if you have a need then then he said it doesn't matter what you have neither and whether whether its food or drink of the natural things of life whatever you have need of your he knows that you have need of those things and he said you don't have to worry about those things because you know he said how much are you better than all these things that he said look what God has done and the beauty of nature the beauty of things and he was some about the lilies of the field and the fowls of the air and all these different things that God has done and he said are you not better than these there's you not think that he if he if he knows every time a sparrow falls brother branham said he he said he knows every time and that would bat its eye or he knows how much Tyler would make every little thing that he knows he knows you know the scripture tells all the hairs of our head are numbered all the things that we have need everything everything about you he knows about and you know what he cares about you he's concerned about you he's interested in your and your needs and your problems and your despairs and all these things he wants you to know that he cares for you and he said not only that he cares but he wants you to cast your cares upon him he wants you to bring your cares to him because he wants to bear your burdens he wants to take care of all your needs and yet sometimes we fail to realize that God's in our midst God is there to help us you know what no but that doesn't mean that we're not void of problems that we're not we're a boy of circumstances that we don't want to have to go through we don't have to face these things trials and temptations and problems but you know he said in all those things he'll make a way that we can escape these things he'll take us through these things but to desire do you want to go through them do you have have that desire to make it through those things you know the the person that I was you know I look at in the scripture is Gideon you know Gideon was was a man and you know by his birth he was he was a it was an air of God because he was because he was a part of the children of Israel because of who he was because of what he was more than he had though he had a birthright he had because you know he had that that sale of circumcision he had all those things that that made him who he was that he had that gift and you know what God called him and in the midst of all of these things and get an A and they stood there and and he was he was speaking and you know the angel come and spoke to him and you know he run from the Philistines and everything that was going wrong and all he could think about was all the problems and I recall a situation that he was in and yet when the angel Lord came to him and Tony said you know thou art a mild you man of Valor here he was you're a mighty man and and you and the thing is this he stood there and he said he said if God is for us if we are who we say we are if we're a part of the blessed of God if we're if we're the children of Abraham and these blessings rest on us he said why is all this be following us why are we in the condition that we're in and they stand and he's speaking to the angel of the Lord and he's asking him why is all this become to us why are we facing these things and he don't realize and when Gideon is standing there speaking to the angel God is in his midst god Braun said that was at the often extend another angel Lord that was God standing in his meds standing before him speaking to him and he wants to know where God he is God standing right in front of him speaking to it and he's telling him who he is think of him you're gonna be an overcomer there's a battle that has to be fought but you'll overcome but you know he don't even realize that he's been called to the battle and he's already been given the victory the victory was he is any stander why is all this befallen us why because you can overcome that's what that's what's be given to us I don't know why we go through the battles we go through why because God knows that we can overcome God knows we can overcome we have to fight these things we don't know why we have to fight particular ones but you know God knows we can overcome them what we'd like to we'd like to be able to pick and choose our battles we'd like to pick and choose our problems we'd like to pick and choose our temptations because you know what I'd like to pick the things that we don't have word we don't have a problem with the things that we don't have to you know well they don't bother me that don't bother me you know what the devil's not going to come at you with things that don't bother you he knows exactly which one of us he knows every aspect of our lives he knows he knows everything how you how you come in and everything that you inherited from your mama and your and all the other things that you had to deal with and all the things that's happened in your life and he knows that one punch he knows exactly how to get to you but the thing is as greater is He that's in me that he that's in the world greater is he that has come to me and given me the victory but do I have but you know the thing is is did you claim the victory do you claim that victory do you believe that you have the victory do we recognize that we have the victory because if if if Gideon was was a it was received the promise and he was a seed of Abraham and he was a son of Abraham and had to had the blessing how much more is the spiritual seed of Abraham have the blessings how much more do we have through because we actually have the life of God living inside of an episode that actually have been born again have actually been born of incorruptible seed how much more does that belong to us oh but you know we see we have things in our lives and things that happen to come our way and you know going back and speaking of this look tree as we were speaking of you know this time of year you know we look and see this this time of year that we're living in and and it's it's in the winter time and you know everything is is everything out there so dead and dried and you know there's no life and it's also gloomy and and all these different things that you know everybody has so many problems this time of year and you know they actually have people that actually have they don't I believe it serotonin I can't remember the name of the the chemical that they have but you know it it lifts you up you know if you get in sunshine you know and people are because in the wintertime there's not enough sunlight and people get in this gloomy condition because they're not living in the sunlight and so there's people that actually go and sit in front of ultraviolet and everything just to have this does it like creates a vitamin D or whatever in their body and so you know they they get so gloomy they get depressed but you know they go sit in this artificial sunlight to get better and in you know it's a psychological addition because people are depressed because of the darkness and everything and they live in this in this condition so they go get in this light because that's what makes them better you know and it's and so they live in this light it is so gloomy and it's so dark and everything and you know and it's the same way in our lives many times you know because things come our ways and everything looks so gloomy everything looks so dark everything looks so bad and we just like you know there's there's no there's no light anywhere it's just so dark and everything every time you know maybe that goes wrong and then there's another problem and it just never just can't ever get anything right and everything just like nothing goes our way and we just can't get a foothold on nothing it just goes all against us and we sit there and you know and we just worry ourselves to death and we just get all depressed about things that we just in this gloomy condition and you know and then you know the thing is that sometimes you can God's trying to speak to us to tell us who we are and what we can do and what we have in our possession but yet we live in the darkness that the devil puts upon us and we just listen to his lies and we walk in him in the in the path that he said for us and we just oh just listen and just go real devil you're right yeah yeah yeah and we just you know we just talk it we just talked the devil's language as brother Forney always says you got talking the devil's language you know work with a I work with a lady and if and and if there's anybody in this whole wide world that's a worrier she's a warrior not a warrior a warrior she's a warrior and she's got it down to a science she is an expert at worrying she worries about everything and every time she comes every time she comes she I see her the plant every now and then and and she'll have she's got something to tell me and it's just like all the time is something and and your energy and she tells mail time she says Aaron she said I pray and I read the Bible and I read the Bible and I pray and she says every time there's something that she comes to me and I said because she said she's so concerned about this and that no and I was like did you read that in the Bible did you find that in the Bible I said the Bible tells me that God didn't give me a spirit of fear he didn't give me it he didn't give me that but he gave me a spirit of a sound mind he said he gave me peace he gave me love he gave me joy you know I know I don't live it I don't live in worry I don't live in these things and you know I always asked her I said where did where did you find that in the bottle well I didn't find that in the Bible I've told her I've told her what brother Ernie said so many times all I have to Go's she'll say something to me I say you'll pay the toll twice now I got to say that and she knows exactly what I don't what the rest of the story is you're paying the toll twice if you worry about something before you get there you got to pay the toll twice brother he always says you're worrying about something and it won't come to pass but y'all well I'm worried about this and I'm worried about that and you know and I tell her I said Kathy not okay her name's Kathy but you know her sister had cancer and she was really bad off they didn't give her a lot of Hope she had to go she had to have surgery in Atlanta and she had to go through chemotherapy she had to be isolated she had to go through a lot of different things channel 4 - it was quite a large mess well I told her I said well I'm gonna bring you a prayer cloth so I brought her a prayer cloth and her her brother had cancer also so I brought both of them prayer cloths well then after that her son ended up having a tumor and it his optical nerve on his in his eye and he had to have surgery to remove that so you know I just here you go there's no prayer call there's no protocol and I was like and then and then she's like I'm so worried I'm so work and then one day she just stood the plant she just cried she right now I said like listen I understand that but you know what he said by stripes you're healed I said oh you can psyche you can't say nothing else well you know she'll get so worked up on stuff and I hear her she get so worried about I don't know what I'm gonna do I'm gonna do oh I was like do you believe in God well yeah you mean the same one to touch your sister that the doctor said that she wouldn't live and she's living now and they say that she's a miracle you know because we believed and we give her a prayer cloth and that we committed her to God and all of a sudden now she's still living and she's like you know my sister she they didn't think she'd ever make it what she's doing so good she's only you know she can just almost go back to work and I was like why are you worrying it's like you're your brother that you said he had cancer next thing you know he's in remission now it's like why are you worrying and your son he had he had that tumor on the optical nerve and in which he end up losing his eye but other than that everything is good I was like why are you worrying it I said because every time you come in there and you say what I'm worried about this and I'm worried about that and I was like the same God that you talk about I pray every day and and she's and she gets so worked up and I was like you're talking the devil's language it's like well I know that I was like well quit you just need to you just need to quit talking the devil's language hey cuz you know what as long as you're entertaining him he's gonna be there talking here you know he's like you know it's like he comes to your house and you roll out the red carpet and put all the snacks on the table and say here you go here's the recliner prop your feet up and he just pops down and he just goes to town it's like well I don't know why this is happening why because you're invited a man well if you just glowed you know kick him out the door so I listen I ain't got time for you get rid of him but you know she gets she get so worked up and everything every time she comes by we start this same song and dance but you know after a while she's like you know you're she said I just I just gotta quit doing this huh what you know and it's like she'll come to me and then the first thing she wants today you're in this like what God say what's the Bible say okay but you know what some people get so worked up in there because then that's just their makeup that's just who they are inside they're so wrapped up and they just gotta have something to worry about and she's like you know and she told me so wait what my mama was a worrier she just worried about everything and she's like you know this person my family they're just worried this one worried and I was like what do you know what it's time for you put into it I said you need to put an end to this just get over this cause you know and she's like well you know what my daughter starts worrying that's like well you know what that's where you need putting into it cuz you letting that you letting that spirit of fear of worry just pass from one generation to the next and you said well my mama worried well you know what just because your mama worry doesn't mean you have to live that way he knows no matter what it is and whatever whatever disease or problem or circumstance that come through your family you know what you're the one you can put an end to it you know what you can put it under the blood it never has to be remembered anymore and you never have to face it anymore cut that thing off we worry about thanks too much we get so worked up on these things we get into such a gloomy time and now all these all these problems and everything gets so dark and and everything but you know what there's there's a time that God is trying to speak to us to let us know there's a greater light there's a greater time coming and you know what if we can see that it's right in front of us that it's there you know as the Song of Solomon you know because you know we talked about it being dark you know I think about that you know he said it's the Song of Solomon 2:10 says my beloved spoke spake and said unto me rise up My Love My Fair one and come away for lo the winter is past the rain is over and gone the flowers appear on the earth the time of the singing of birds is come the voice of the turtle is heard in our land the fig tree putteth forth her green figs and the vines with the tender grape give a good smell arise my love my fair one and come away so you know you know we say all these things that are gloomy and dark and everything but you know he's warning us to come because you know what there's a the winter is over you know he's speaking come come there's greater things look look the things that are past you know because if we dwell in these things but you know he's there to speak to us you know what it doesn't have to be that way that we can come and you don't you just walk right out of that well put that behind you come into this great life the beautiful scenery that that he speaks of the flowers of blooming and all these different things while the winters pass the darkness the gloom enos the coldness all let's pass there's a beautiful time ahead if you'll just come he said come away from all that if we can just come and get away from all this gloom enos this darkness and we can if we can see what God is wanting to do this unrecognized presence of God this spiritual happening that God has for us that he can quicken us you know and one of the things that we must do is is we must stay in the word we you know because you know if you want to grow as he talks about the tree he said you know tree all they have to do is drink in and push out all they have to do is drink and push out God wants us to stay in his presence you know and when we look and we say well you know we see things and it just doesn't look right and you know it's not the way we want it to be but you know what you just get in the presence of God you know you just put everything else aside just put all of the all the things of the world aside you know you set aside time for God and God sets a time for you because you know there's a time you see you you get along with God and God will get along with you and go come and speak to you and God will do things for you I know doesn't matter how long you have to sit because you know what God knows whether we're honest or not God knows whether we're sincere God knows whether we're desperate or not but you know what you getting desperate before God he'll get desperate with you he'll come meet your need he'll come speak to you you know the scripture tells us in the book of numbers you know it talks about when when they when the children of Israel you know that they murmured and complained against Moses and Aaron and and all these different things and you know here they were comparing complaining about about them and you know not realizing they were God's instruments that was God's prophet and that was God's mouthpiece speaking to them speaking to them and you know they wanted to a murmur and complain and argue with them and you know what God told him said well you know what he said just to show you he said we're going to take each man a rod and you know he put each man's run and he wrote an Aaron's name on the tribe of Levi and he put it in the in the holy place and you know it's set in there and this dead stick this dead thing there laid in the presence of God all of a sudden it bloom and brought forth almonds and you know here was in the midst of all this you know and so he shows us that that no matter what condition that we're in even though we're alienated and cut off from God or no matter how dark and gloomy things get in your life you get in the presence of God and see if God doesn't do a miracle because brother bill talks about he is a spiritual God is a supernatural God and he said if we get in that same realm I've been in the supernatural that will see miracles take place but the thing is is you've got to get in that same realm the hazy and that he'll come on the scene and you can see the supernatural take place he said he said house hitting house the god of miracles ever gonna work miracles if you don't believe in miracles maybe you don't trust God to do a miracle that how's he ever going to do it for you but he can stand right there and speak to you and show you and no matter how dark and gloomy it gets to know how many darkness it is you know that as Gideon was tender the angel of the Lord was stood before him and spoke to him and you know it Darren was his answer that he needed they was looking for speaking right to him and we you know sometimes it's like well he didn't come through the right person who didn't didn't come the right way you know and but you know what we still need to pray and say God where where he comes however it comes you know you know I just want to see you and you let me know this is for me appreciate any button sister Esther singing that song you know there was a woman she had a need you know and she stood there you know she cuz she could have you know she could have just stood there but you know what she decided that she was gonna fight her way through the crowd she was going to press her way in you know there's no scripture that says that if you touch the hem of His garment that you be made whole but you know what her faith was that if I can but touch the hem of His garment she said I'll be a made whole you know she had faith to reach out in that and she believed what she said she would indeed and brother brother said that's what God does and everything that was created he believed in his own word he spoke it and he believed it and it came to pass and here's a woman walks out there and she just goes in man believes it and didn't even have a word it wasn't was it something that the law of Moses said if you touch the hem of the of the Messiah or whoever some holy man and you'll get healed there's no scripture for that but you know what she had faith to believe that she could touch him and you know what he didn't even he didn't even know physically that she touched him but there was something that came from him because virtue left him and he turned and said who touched me why because she knew how to reach into our supernatural realm to touching and then she received exactly what she had need of if you can do the same thing we can reach in into a surfer natural realm and touch God and we can receive exactly what we have Nita he's there to meet your need he said he's there too for you to reach out and touch him many times we get so wrapped up in the gloom and the darkness and the sadness and all these different things and don't realize that gods in our midst we missed we missed the things of God going on but Wade's been preaching on revival you know you can be in a revival and nobody else know that you're in a revival God can stir your soul nobody else know what's going on because there is like well it's so dead it's so gloomy but you know what there's things that happen and and before us and we don't even see them take place you know as speaking I was I was reading the article some time back and it really it really stirred something inside of me you know it was it was speaking of and I didn't know this learn something but you know in the wintertime we look out here in the wintertime when we say well you know all this is dead brother brems said you know tree the tree knows that God tells that tree before anything happens any cold spell anything happens you know all of a sudden those leaves start turning and that SAP starts going back into the the root of that tree and he said you know he said you can see that root you know the SAP going back down into room you know when he was speaking to that infidel you know he was talking to the infidel and he asked himself why is that he said why I said it was that SAP going out of that tree going into the ground he said we had a cold spell there's nothing happening he said he said well that's just nature he said but what calls nature to do that he said there's guy you got to know that there's some kind of intelligence that done that and he said that's what brother Graham told him he said he said if you can tell me what what intelligence told that SAP to go into the root of that tree he said I'll tell you the intelligence that told me about that woman that was in that meeting that had she had a handkerchief in her and her purse and her sister was dying so you know we say you know what why don't one of these things take place like that and you know everybody says well it's you know it's dead it's this dead time of year we we can't see anything but you know I was reading this article and and this this man he's a forester he's an arborist and you know I learned something that I didn't realize and I thought you know what it's exactly this way he said you know tree roots there's life in the tree roots but you know what they don't stop growing you know they are growing right now dead winter cold as long as the ground he said long as the ground stays between 36 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit those treatments are over they said no most tree roots are within 6 to 24 inches of the bottom of the tree so most of them or sometimes we get 4 foot some areas got 4 foot of frost got the frost barrier you know it goes down 4 feet sometimes it's 2 feet whatever area is well you know some of those roots are beyond that and you know what those things are digging sometimes he says sometimes they're just like little hairs little tiny hairs and you know what they're moving and let me tell you something else I learned that I didn't know I didn't know I thought was real fascinating do you know when you end up with roots in your sewer line is in the wintertime yeah but you didn't know that I didn't know that I learned something new every day man but you know I thought well they grow all the time you know in the wood in the summer but but he's like no he said they grow more in the winter and you sir and your sewer lines your septic tank then in the summertime they said you know why number one there's air because though there's the Silver Line don't always stay full of water there's there's moisture there's air and I didn't tell you nothing like that as fertilizer fertilizer fertilizer fertilizer he said it he said it was nutrients I'm reading I'm reading my new notes here nutrients but the other thing he said was interesting was you know they want warmth you know brother Graham tells that story about him camping out there and had fired all of a sudden seen that little flower bloom and that flower sitting there he's like where did you come from well you know what life was already in the ground he was just waiting for the right atmosphere and when that fire was there that that flower came to life and he said you know he said the water that you goes down your drain is warmer than the ground is so you know what they like warm warmth they like water they got nutrients everything is right there you know then things are just going along and all it takes is just one tiny hairs just little tiny teeny tiny thing and it finds a crack it goes all around you sewer lines he finds a little opening slides right in there and all of a sudden that little little root starts having a Jubilee and he starts going to town and then you know what not only does he have a Jubilee but all of a sudden he lets everybody else know I found it and all said you know what there's headlights crawling over too and they start going in next are crawling around all saying hey you know what if I got one in there and there's another one going in and there's another one all of a sudden all of a sudden next thing you know you've got a problem because your sewer lines missed it but you know what we think what God's not doing anything we say well we don't see anything taking place but you know what there's all kinds of things taking place and we don't we don't see them and here and you know it struck me when I was reading that that here here's all this root growth going on and just because it's got cold outside all of a sudden the life of that tree is went down into the end of the root and it's in the ground well you know what it may be cold it may be freezing it may be gloomy it may be all kinds of problem but you know what if those roots get deep enough you know what that frost don't touch them and you know what as job said he said at the scent of water that tree go bloom and he said at the scent of water that's always looking for it doesn't need a lot it all it needs is just a little bit of water and then roots are girl one down and they start growing and growing and growing trying to get to that water and you know what else happens not only them roots just growing but you know what it knows that there's another part of that tree it's in the fall that's in the frost it's it's froze up but you know what it's all one and you know what it starts doing it starts pulling that water back into the end of the end of the whole root system and it starts bringing nutrients into that whole root system and it's a it's not just from one it may be one tap root but you know what all of a sudden this whole winter it's pulling all those nutrients it's pulling all that moisture it's pulling that oxygen right up into the that route and that roots just sitting there and they said he said that roots just sitting there like just like this and it's like well you know what I can't move right now I'm pros but you know what he said there's something on the inside of me just full full of moisture full of nutrients and all of a sudden one day the Sun comes and all of a sudden the warmth of the Sun starts hitting the ground and then roots sitting there you know what they've been froze all winter long and it don't look like there's anything going on but all of us said all that stuff that's been built up all winter long you know because there's one that's been digging because there's one that's been active there's one that's been moving and it all of a sudden there's another one starts doing and you know what in that whole root system when the Sun comes up in the spring then all of a sudden you know what then that whole thing starts to just comes on life and you know what it starts digging and it starts pushing and then all of a sudden it starts pushing out it starts pushing out all of a sudden you know what all of a sudden then you've got trees that are blooming and all of a sudden you've got things that are taking place but you know what it takes it takes something to reach y'all we said well we don't we don't see these things and he said you know he said just because people say well you know I don't want to don't feel like it's time to fertilize the trees or anything like this you know he said you know you know what because it's the winter time and you know everybody wants to put it off no now it's the time to do it you know as it's starting to get cold in the fall and everybody you know sometimes people get coldness in their life and they think well you know you you got the excuse to they know that's the time that you need to get in the Word of God you need to get before God's presence because you know here maybe you may go through the dry time you may go through a cold time you may go feel like God's a million miles away but you know what you stay in the presence of God and you feed on the word and you feed on the word you say well I don't see nothing taking place you stay there until late because you know what it's milling filled up inside it's been it's metal build up its building build up and then you spend packed in there all of a sudden there's a time with because when the Holy Ghost is going to come and it's going to quicken that word it's gonna come and it's going to come to life why because there's one of them one of these days the Esso winds gonna strike what you have the scripture brother man up said you know he said you you knew because if you bring him the word the Holy Ghost feeds on the word the Holy Ghost will quicken the word that you bring to and if you become the word as you as you feed on the word but you've got to bring in the word you know because you said well it's easy to it's easy to pray when everything's going good it's the more it's more important to pray when just not going good is more important to stay in the word when things don't go well when things have when you have more problems and all these things and instead of sitting around thinking you know where is God in all of this well you know what God made me standing in front of you speaking to you and telling you I'm giving you your answer right now but you know what we may we just may miss go and honey recognize that God is in our midst and we don't we think well we don't see any we don't see any growth but you know what you don't know that just because you said well I don't see anything taking place I don't feel like I'm growing up the statue of a perfect man I don't I don't feel like I'm going to get away you stay in the word because you know one of these days God's gonna show you where you are he's going to show you because you know because you may have one little tap root that's digging through there and he's like well you know this is so hard it's such a struggle it's just a you know I just can't don't seem like I'm gonna make it well you just keep going because you know what now that's the one that's going to bring you through and all of a sudden you get full and then all of a sudden you know then that light illuminates the word that you've gotten off some man you said men it's just you know you're just over over there over the heels well you know what God wanted want to show you you stay in the word you feed on the word no matter what it comes or goes just stay with the word and it'll bring it it'll bring to pass whatever you have need of scripture tells us says blessed is the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly nor standeth in the way of sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful but his delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and bringeth forth his fruit in his season his leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper so you know it's in it and it's in that season so whatever whatever seasoning that you're in if you stay there and you and you stay faithful to that in that season God will bring it to pass whatever that season is God's going to quick in it to you you faith if you're faithful to the word that he's faithful to you he's gonna be faithful to you to bring exactly what you have need of we worry about things and we don't see things taking place did you know what God's moving I got one one other cool demo I want to share with you and Brad Brad was speaking of this is what hereis tell Elijah new brother Brad was speaking of he said that he said that's what churches try to do they try to pattern mark join something run after this or that or the other he said wait on the Lord he will provide for you he said what do you hear can you hear the voice he and he speaking of the Bears in the wintertime he says the Bears hear the voice of God that bear and he goes on he talks about the mother bear said that mother bear is bred in October she goes and lays down she doesn't wake up anymore to the middle of May said them little Cubs are born in February so what if the little mother would say no wait a minute my little Cubs is going to be born there'll be three months before I ever see them the little fellers are born just like a little rat a little bitty things naked just like a little young rat well how would these little fellas ever find a place and well how will they ever be taken care of said she don't worry about that she knows that something speaks to her that God will take care of that when them little rats fellows are born in February and all that cold weather down under the snowdrift something makes the little fella stand on his feet walks around his mother right to the utter and goes and goes to nursing ladies right there and nurses three months and when mammy wakes up she says good morning children takes the stroll and goes out said she ain't flustered by about going down south she ain't flustered she's got to have a doctor there to take care of all these children and things when they're born she just sleeps it off amen said if the church could only find bare sense to wait on God if we could find and realize that all that you have need of God is given to you he supplied your every need before you ever have the need of that and you know what if you just wait just like that that mama bear just lays there and we think well nothing's going on well you know what there's some new births taking place there's some people that are actually being born again there's actually some that are growing up and you know we don't we don't see that because you know what we know well nothing's going on we're you know it's just the same church service it's just the same people you know we're just going here brother Dale for the weight or whoever but you know what there's a time and all of a sudden you know if we start looking they said look to the unseen if we can look into that other realm and see what's taking place you know many times we fail my brother Bram said we fail to realize the angels of God are encamped about us we are we're we fail to realize that the angels of God are here they're here when you when you when you come to the house of God they're here they meet with us they follow us they're leading us and they're here to meet your needs well god bless you gnight let's stand while have musicians come I'm so glad that I am a child of God that I can recognize Who I am and Lord let me be mindful in the Lord wake me up sometimes when I don't realize that you're there trying to speak to me I think about brother Dale where he says you know when you wake up sometimes you wake up in the middle or not sometimes it's early in the morning when you wake up and you know sometimes like Lord you want talk to me you know sometimes things come to your mind in the early in the morning and you know I've had I've had people come on my heart wake up early in the morning to pray for somebody it's like well I don't know why this is but you know I and I had a years ago I told you I had a sister she come home I heard and kind of grew up together know I knew her for many years and you know there was something that I just couldn't get away from it up you know and so I just prayed as a lord you know I don't know what's going on this has probably been 20-something years ago but as well comes like Lord I don't know why this is but I'm just I'm just I don't know what the situation is but at that time when I talked to her later on she told me she said Aaron you don't realize that she said I've been dating a boy that was Pentecostal and having been raised in this message she said I was dating a Pentecostal boy and he had asked me to marry him and she said I was really going through a struggle at that time because she said she said because her dad was an unbeliever her mom was a believer her dad put so much pressure I was like he's got a good job he's got a good family look I mean everything everything that you is right there he's a good Christian boy he's got a college degree got money everything Hey I mean I worked with I worked with Glenn he was an awesome guy but you know what she's like I can't do this and her dad just and you know and I I prayed you know I didn't understand any of that at the time but later on she told me she said you know she said I appreciate you praying out she said I thank God that somebody was interceding for me because she said I was battling and she said you know only me and mama knew really what was going on you know you wake up in the middle of the night and you know when you hear somebody speak like that right and years later I let brother I let brother Dale she wrote me she wrote me a letter number of years ago I thought brother Dale read it and everybody that had something to do with her Christian experience she wrote a letter to all of us and she wrote an every portion of that every person that had something to do with her Christian walk that had something and and she actually included me in that and to this day is one of the greatest honors that I've had in my life that you know you can reach out and touch somebody and somebody write and tell you what what you've meant to them you know you you think you think you're insignificant you don't think what you know I can change anybody I don't I don't think I can do anything you don't know how much you can change you know there's so many times that people have been put in the scripture that were insignificant people and their lifetime but you know what they're in the pages of God's eternal word - you and I are four examples of who somebody that stood and took the word and overcame took God at His Word hey man god bless you rapture and our blessing when the redeemed are gathering here whether it ain't our gathering here they'll wash like snow and free from all sin how
