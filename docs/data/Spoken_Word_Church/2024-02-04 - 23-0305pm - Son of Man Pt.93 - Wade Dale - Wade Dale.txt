good see each and every one of you with us just make these announcements real quick and we'll get started we got communion today in foot washing so just keep that in your prayer brother Lis will be speaking for us Wednesday night um the coming 18th that will be a couple of Saturdays from now that'll be the youth service brother Jack Duff will be with us at 3:00 and then we'll have have a meal afterwards probably pizza or something like that we'll work on that when June gets back we'll have one service on the 19th that would be Sunday at normal regular time regular service all right just remember that also remember March the 24th we some of us are going to the wedding over in bufor that'll be Friday and Saturday but we'll be back on the 25th brother Samuel Rees will be speaking for us on the 26th I spoke to him this morning um going through a little rough time rough spot but you know what God's proud of him God allowed that to happen so that his character same way with me and you he allows these things to happen so our character can be made manifest and we can see what what if we didn't know what to work on he gives us that for us to realize what we need to work on what our strengths are and what our weaknesses are to me that's his plan he planned to do that cuz he knew we'd need it am and so we need to just take that plan and use it um and looking forward brother Dutch Scott will be here on East on uh Good Friday that'll be a 7 o00 Service April the 8th will be a Saturday service we'll probably have a fellowship meeting I'm going call Brother Homer we had this same thing last year but that same time I'll call Brother Homer and see if they want to do that and then on the that'll be the eth brother Chris long on tonight he'll be here also with us one service so just keep that in your prayer then we got other stuff coming but uh we'll be announcing that later on uh we sure miss everybody that's not here we um we praying for them sister Smallwood different ones Lord it just they just don't ever miss you know they they're here even when they're sick and uh we sure miss them and if they're not here they're sick yeah they can't say say that to all of us but when if they're sick and they're not here but it's a fight you have to fight your way you have to fight your way here and you fight your way back is that right sister Rebecca I heard you say that uhhuh mhm she said it is it's a fight it's a struggle but you know what I'd rather do that and gain eternal life than to lose my soul and go to hell all right gain the whole world but Lose My Soul brother Louise you know it's 10,000 worlds that to me that's an awesome statement when it took a prophet to be able to go back in the mind of God to even know there was 10,000 worlds but your soul is worth 10,000 worlds 10,000 of these oh we think it's great because of of bzo and Amazon and uh and all those people like that if they're not born again they'll just vaporize into nothing their money their Bank account they're I saw where somebody the other day with Bill Gates was over hundred billion dollar now he was worth I can't fathom that I could spend it but I couldn't fathom that but without God you got way more than he does way more 10,000 worlds worth than he does but the people like that that put on this world to prove one thing is for sure God's in control this whole thing and if you don't if you don't uh do what God says then it doesn't matter if you're rich cuz even even Jesus he loved that rich guy he loved that rich that Rich Young Ruler he loved him he said man come on Rich Young Ruler couldn't give and then Jesus turned around and said it's really hard for a for a rich man to enter the Kingdom of Heaven because he'll always fall to his riches first and depend on that when you depend on God if you depend on God with zero dollar I'd rather do that and depend on myself with 101 billion doll all right everybody with me on that that's what we got to look at we got to see that God is God's in control he's the one that's doing it and we just going to have to let go and let God all right so let's bow our heads I know we all have um things on our heart that we need to uh pray about and uh we appreciate each and every one of you being here and we love you with the love of the Lord thank you for all the support that you've give us and the support that you give the church and the cleaning of the church and getting everything uh keeping everything up and and we're working on a few other things to do and uh we just want to be uh ever in the will of God not in the will of oursel so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day that you give us Lord we now know that you are in control as the song says you've got it all in control and I pray Lord that you'd be with us in the furth of this service you take control you speak to the people you go down their aisle Lord you you get into their life father not me you Lord teach them how to live better Lord how to be a better Christian Lord teach them how to pray teach them how to seek you father Lord just be with us now as we pray Lord for the sick and The Afflicted Lord the ones ones that are not with us and the ones that are here today we pray that you would give them a supernatural touch Lord be with us Lord in the furth of this service we give it all to you in the name of Jesus Christ amen all right in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh what kind of word is it it's a Living Word not a dead word not a dead letter it's a Living Word of God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can be seated in the Lord as his Blessing to the reading of the word second Peter 1 ver5 says besides this giving all diligence add to your faith virtue and The Virtue knowledge knowledge temp Temperance Temperance patience patience godliness we're going to try to get to Temperance and patience we'll try to get to that uh sorry I probably preached a little bit this morning but I think we'll just kind of drop back and teach a little bit this afternoon slow down a little bit so that that's all right with you Amen in your patience possess you your souls we're going to when we get to patience you going to have to see that that that patience brother brownan what do you say the first thing we had to have patience with not our not neighbor not our somebody sitting beside you in church he said have patience with God so you got to have patience with God that he'll do what he said he will do all right so that's what we've got to do because I read you a quote where brother R said if you go out beyond the program of God you're just going to Heap up on the side of the road he says scrap scrap peaps of ministers that go out past the program of God and we've seen it you've seen it we've all seen it we've seen them take a message and and brother Brian preach even you know like running with a message and all those things you know running from the presence of the Lord you got to be in the right season at the right time and you've got to catch the mind of God and I believe that we have caught the mind of God cuz we know what time that we're living in we know what day I don't say we I say we every of all of us sitting in here that we know what is coming we actually know who's going to do it but we know where we're going all right just as I said God knew everything from the beginning he's now taught us from the beginning what it is that we're looking for where we come from what we're doing here and where we're going right and to me that's the as as brother Dale's always said the opening of the seals is knowing where you came from what you're doing here and where you going well that's the whole Plan of Redemption the full plan not just to get your soul redeemed the soul redeemed started on the day of Pentecost that's and don't get me wrong but that's a 2,000 year old Doctrine that's a 2,000 year old Doctrine all right and it never gets any any any worse it gets better but add to your new birth so we're going to add to that what happened on the day of Pentecost back 2,000 years ago in 8030 back in that in that time where they were in the upper room so we're going to add to that because what happened to Peter when Peter came out of that upper room he was the spokesman but remember he didn't write first Peter and second Peter until a little bit later cuz he wasn't filled with the Holy Ghost until then he didn't know how to get virtue and knowledge and Temperance and patience and godliness and brotherly kindness but then he realized what God was doing in his life same way with brother Bron brother Brandon was born again I think he's back in the 20s I think he got the new birth back somewhere in that way in his 20s he said he's born in 1909 I believe it was and and but he didn't preach statute of perfect man till 1960 whatever it was 6162 why he hadn't come to that stage yet he had to grow in Grace and knowledge just like me and you have to grow in Grace and knowledge he had to come from a baby listen you know what happened let me tell you what happened to brother Brandon remember his first sermon he said I preached and and remember he preached and and and hope he was a literate hope had to read the Bible hope read the scripture and then he preached well the first term when he preached you know remember he thought man this is good I did a good job everybody enjoyed it and he goes behind he goes into pastor's study and Pastor Dr Davis looked at him and he said worst sermon I've ever heard brother Brown said what but they cried what brother what Dr Davis say they cried at funerals right so it wasn't an emotion so hey you know what that tells me if brother Bram can bomb in his first sermon so can we that's right so don't worry about when some of you get old get you know start preaching and you bomb don't worry the bombed his first sermon all right I'm sorry that's what he said I love it when brother brand he's so honest honest to tell us his his mistakes and honest to tell us even what he was thinking that he didn't have to tell you in me but praise God what was in his mind came out of his mouth now you and I may have a problem with that but if you're a prophet and let and let God take control it's all right all right so add to your new birth so so when brother Ram got born again he had to add to brother Ram's new birth brother M brother R had to take a walk through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost as we were talking about this morning water to the ankles water to the knees water to the loins and then a river that you couldn't even you had to swim in it you had to learn how to swim all right now with the ankles you don't have to learn how to swim with the knees you don't have to learn how to swim even at the loins you can just walk through the water but buddy when it gets up about 10t deep you going to either drown or learn how to swim one of the two all right so we're going to learn how to swim in this word of God all right is everybody with me we're going to minister nourishment look Minister nourishment to each one of us this ought to not be this ought to be the this ought to be the happiest time of our life to be able to sit in a congregation and hear the word of God and be able to sing the words of God they were the uh young adults were downstairs give them a hand clap these young adults I'm telling you these young adults I see too many sitting out there on on the on the street corners doing their stuff and they're enjoying it but I walked in that room and there was a song i' been playing on the radio that I enjoyed it doesn't matter who's singing it you've heard me say that before I don't care who sings it they're all lost if I ain't got the new birth Toby ma or anybody right but it's the anointing behind the words that were that's that's spoken that's true if they're singing about God that's true so this song Gyra I know you probably all a lot of you Maverick city news or Maverick City whatever it is not news I may be M news what is it what is it I M anyway so this this this these they sing it anyway it doesn't matter but they're getting together and they sing and they have a choir and they have this guy playing the the organ and or the piano and he's a black guy and I come to find out somebody says well he's a rapper I don't care the anointing to that song saying that Gyra Jehovah Gyra my provider and they sang that song and I walked in there and I told the young adults I said you've heard this song and they said yes I said I'd like you to sing it um April for the uh y'all don't know this but I I try to uh um volun told when you hear these songs up here usually it's me asking them to do it either getting Sister Christine and and uh they're getting old now and can tanker us they're not doing it anymore so I went straight to the kids I didn't say you sister Trudy oh I'm sorry but I told them and I said go tell the youth so I walk in there and I said hey guys you heard this song yep laid it down played it for him they said yep well they could have sung it today so much talent and a nine-year-old kid was leading them zo way be led by a child I'm sorry she's 10 Lord Mercy forgive me goodness gracious but they jumped right in what you saying these youth they get they get into that anointing and they know how to use it so I appreciate them singing those songs like that and I said you don't take it by that anointing out there you take it by your anointing and you sing it to the people and if you sing it by that anointing by the anointing of the Holy Ghost it will always turn out right always turn out right so man they practiced just a few times and they was they was comfortable with singing it so um I thank God that we've got a group of people that'll come together and sing those songs cuz I believe God's in song too you know all right now let's jump through this let's jump through this real quick so what was the fourth thing the fourth part of life is what the word we we looked at the dry bones we looked at the going into the water I'm going to try to get to these virtues if you don't mind so what is it it's that Holy Ghost Bunch us Bunch us people being honed out so that it can fit the same kind of ministry he had when he went away that when he comes back it'll catch the whole thing who's the whole thing I'm looking at the whole thing it's not going to Rapture cars and airplanes and it's not going to Rapture your message book either it's not going to Rapture your computer it's going to Rapture human beings that are born again by the Breath of God that have took the word of God and then there's going to be a a group inside of a group come on somebody there's going to be a group brother rown said there's been Brides brides churches Brides he said but they'll come one this is the one there's not another one we didn't we didn't have a we didn't have a preview of the bride and then a second preview of the bride and then a third preview of the bride and then a fourth no brother Brown said there was two previews Alpha bride Omega bride the Omega bride got out of line it took a prophet to get her back in line well you know what I believe we're back in line I just believe we're back in line so if we're back in line then this can happen it'll catch the whole thing in the Rapture with the Justified Sanctified baptism of the Holy Ghost that pyramid will stand again the house of God will live again the Tree of Life where is that tree of life it's inside of you that's right brother B said Christianity versus idolatry look he says we are made partakers of his Holiness we In His Image we are living images of a living God he don't want dead people he wants live people he wants you dead to yourself look then dead to self raised with him now listen his word made flesh again in us oh brother Neville look what is is it not the mythical imaginary God sitting out there but the Living God what is the Living God there's your answer the word in you makes it real glory to God oh I know you think I'm a Holy Roller maybe I am maybe I thought I hollered a little bit too much this morning but you know what get used to it but old brother do you see it triumph over every denomination triumph over all paganism and I'm going to say over all your issues over all your problems he will help you because look the word of God which is God is made flesh in you cuz look the word of God and the word of the devil like I said before you take a high priest that high priest could only take the confession of the people back before God same way with God and and and Jesus Christ being our mediator there not three different gods but it's a position did not Jesus pray he said father I pray that as you and I are one that the bride and me are one amen so we've had that prayer prayed over us in John 17 we've had that that that he wouldn't take you out of the world right right Lord I'm not praying to take them out of the world in other words I don't want him to just have a flowery bed of Eve I want them to be in the world but not of the world Lord he said father protect them so where's our protection come from our protection comes from our father every one of you that are fathers you are the protect her you're your daughter's Holy Ghost until she gets it in the natural form and the word of God which is God is made flesh in you why you're seated in Heavenly places Trump over all things in Christ Jesus that's why I was telling them when they were singing you raise yourself up into a Heavenly atmosphere they may sing it and be a bunch of prostitutes and be a bunch of hor mongers but that song's anointed and when we catch the true anointing of that guess what that's what God wanted to start with that's what puts us in Heavenly places that's what puts me to be able to listen to that song and not have to worry about the past life of whoever singing it but I want them to sing it I want to hear it from their voice I want to hear from somebody knows who Jehovah Gyra is that knows he's your provider amen all right I'm preaching now stop tell me my brother tell me my sister when was the time that the sons of God was ever to be manifested outside this time right now we are now Sons and Daughters of God we're not going to be right when was ever a time in history listen we talk about Lincoln and we talk about Washington and we talk about all these great people that we read about in history they're going to all if they're not not born again they're going to vanish they're not even going to be in your memory but there'll be a William brandom in your memory there'll be a Ron Spencer in your in your memory there'll be a Donnie Reagan a Samuel Dale a bob black that'll be in your memory that'll be what this world is waiting on it's not waiting on some great Jeff bezo or some great somebody else it's waiting on you right and your name's written in H your name's written in the palm of his hand what is the time to deliver all nature God deliver my nature first deliver this guy waiting for the time of manifestation while before the atonement was made before the Holy Ghost was ever poured out in the Old Testament on down there couldn't have been manifestation so who's making history you and I today are making history amen amen when we go through a testimony when we go through and we get healed or we get delivered from something you're making history you're making history that nobody else is going to make sure Abraham Lincoln was a good president but he'll never be anymore I believe he was a Christian because brother Ram said he was a Christian so we'll get to see Abraham Lincoln but if he's not born again don't give me the presidency give me being the bride amen that's the manifestation of God that he wants he don't want you to be a good person God has never wanted you to be a good person amen there's a lot of good people that's going to be in hell right right but he wants you to be him he wants you to understand what he's saying he wants you he wants you like I said this morning that deep part of you that calls what's it calling for it's calling for him to come here cuz the coming of the Lord is what to to the wall to the to the to the recorder to the to the you know no the coming of the Lord is to be in you the coming of the Lord is the revealing of his word is how many times have you heard that quote well who's it being revealed to the wall you it's being revealed to you you're making history amen shaping up to a headstone to the manifestation of the sons of God coming back and the spirit of God coming into these men look so perfectly until their ministry will be so close like Christ to join him and his church together how's that going to happen Ephesians 4:12 Apostles prophets pastors teachers and evangelists for what our Perfection for the perfecting of of the Saints if you're a saint then you're going to get perfected by that way and no other way or you going to get perfected then we talk about then we were talking about the two prophets they're all waiting on us folks that whole anointing that whole Malachi uh four anointing to them is waiting right here that Revelations what is it seven or so where the two prophets go to Israel is waiting right here it's barred there's no way it's going to go over there brother George until we're out of the way until he the bride be taken out of the way there's no way that scripture is going to be fulfilled we got to fulfill our part first listen Luther fulfilled his part God put him away he F Wesley fulfilled his part put him away they all had a part listen they had a part in that plan I was about talking about this was God's method of achieving an End Amen how many of you heard brother Dale say many many times he said what is the coming of the Lord what is the seventh seal brother R said it's the end of all things well it's none then we're finished there's nothing else no it's the end of the struggling world he said it's the end of this Cosmos it's the end of your issues whatever it is well well when we get over there we we'll get delivered from it right this is where we going to get delivered from it or we are not going to get delivered from it and whose choice is that don't point at me I got to point it myself look watch they uncover and open it up he's talking about the six seal so the six seal has got to in the spiritual form open with us on Earth not in the natural form it opens when the two witnesses appear to Israel and the Gentile church has got to be gone so by that we know that the seals were open to the Gentiles and that we're not here anymore the raptures took place actually the dead in christes Rose first and then we'll be changed so the body changed there's glorified people walking all over the all over the world yes prise because why because they've captured listen man has tried to capture nature clouds tornadoes man has tried to figure out a way to control all that right so what are they figured out now they're controlling Me and You by the things that we do or don't do that covid-19 you believe whatever you want to it was a control Factor it was something to see how much you'll take and how much you'll not take see how much you'll do and how much you'll not do cuz listen we were talking about it yesterday me and somebody oh was talking at the the Baptist friend this first cousin of ours what one item I want to ask you something what one item that you can ever think of since you were a kid till now what one item took only about maybe two weeks to shut this whole world down oh we've had eoli over here we've had the Spanish Flu over here we've had this that we hear that happens over here we hear that this happened we had some small poox at one time you know each and you had aou but what in two weeks it spread all over the world it was just like it just like a it was is a demon but it just spread all over the world in a matter of two weeks right right control control that's right but what do we got to do as uh we'll get into patience in a minute because in Bible says in patience like I said possess you your soul you've got to you've got to pull that thing down and say hey we got to believe God we got to believe God for everything we make mistakes we make we got issues and problems that's okay we're going to have them till the day we get out of here but we're going to have to know how to handle them and you don't handle them by disappearing do you brother George thank you you do not hand and me too I run from this thing I'm looking at a bunch of people that run from God in their life amen I got one amen and one that's it so the rest of y'all are Saints I'm preaching to these two right here me and me and these two right here are going to get it thank you very much go ahead but it is it's something we got to go through but we're going to come out on the other side but you can't be separated from God Amen that's Satan that wants to separate this thing so let's continue on Psalms 42:7 says deep calleth into the deep at the noise of thy water spout all thy waves and thy Billows are gone over me what happened brother B he walks through the he walks through the uh forest and he looks down and he and I see it on my right route I've got a a place on my route that two Springs come together and they just come out of nowhere I mean it's just Woods everywhere it's right on the side of the road right where the mailboxes are basically one up here or one down here and one up there and you watch them even if it's not rain to drop back in the summertime here's this little bitty trickle of water running all the time now buddy the last few weeks it's been like a flood but where did it come from it come from that spring called the there's nothing above it but just a big old slope going up to a couple houses but there's couple indentions in that in that hill and that's where what that pressurized water from way down deep inside is pushing between something a rock or a root or something is pushing right through between that and it's running through there doesn't take anybody you don't have to have a pump right it just runs by itself and that's why brother B looked at that stream he said why you do that you feed so you can cool the deer down so I can take a drink NOP no he said if the spring could have spoke what would it say there's something down inside of me that's pushing that water up out of the ground that's my question to you is there something inside of you pushing this word out of this ground listen folks we can't be dilatory anymore we played around with this thing long enough you either got to get excited are you going to get left and I don't mean excited like shouting and running up and all the aisles you got to get excited about the word of God Amen you know what people will know if you get excited especially some of you that hadn't moved in years yeah I believe in Emotion sorry what's a baby do when it comes out of the womb no screams let that where's the oh she's asleep your KN she'll scream for you if you need it she ain't been quiet a day in her life Ain that right under and that's okay listen I'd rather her scream and keep everybody awake praise the Lord anyhow now before when the Deep calls to the Deep look before they can be a deep call there had to be a deep respond in other words there had to be water right there had to be water under pressure before that could be pushed out of the ground and then it just flow and be the prettiest white I mean not white but the purest Clear Water you ever seen comes from a spring there's a River of Life flowing out a pure stream of water are the word of God before there can be a deep call there has to be a deep to respond to it as brother R said many times and you hear him he said there's got which one came first the fish or the water if the fish came first he just flops and dies but the water came first cuz God knew the fish would need the water so he knew we'd need the word of God he didn't just throw us out there and say here fight for yourself no he's right there fighting with us every time every day we just deny come on we just deny we need help we're in denial and denial is a river think about that for a minute it is there was something in there called out for more of God you might have been living in a Justified State before God but you want the baptism of the Holy Spirit and you hungered for it the very reason that there is a holy spirit is because you're hunging for it the very reason that Peter stood up and said add to your faith virtue knowledge temper patience he wanted to us to be as brother Ram said a Powerhouse a Powerhouse in this world in this dark world I read it to you he put us in the darkest place that he could put us you me cuz he knew somebody would overcome somebody would make it I'm just dumb enough to believe it's me and y'all amen let's go down a little bit further and as I said this morning there's nothing of such prevailing power as a revelation of the word like I said this morning there's been enough Revelation preached in this building for us to take a Rapture what are we doing with it though oh we lay out of church we sleep during church we we have issues we all going to have issues we all going to have problems but when are we going to realize that this is better than anything out there there this is going to sustain you where that out there want if you think your job is God's going to take it away from you you know what that's if you're a child of God ain't that what brother R said and I'll tell you in my own words you think so much of your job and your car and your whatever it is God's going to take it away from you if you're a child of God cuz he's not going to put anything in your way for you to become a child of God all right but if not we'll just die where we're at so there's nothing of such prevailing power as the revelation of the word of God Ephesians 1:17 the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation and the knowledge of him that just kind of puts all that together look the eyes of your understanding not the eyes of your body right my eyes are going bad some of y'all wear glasses that you didn't wear them before some of you are going up here going not them eyes but the eyes of your understanding Open the Eyes of My Heart Lord not the eyes of my physical the eyes of my physical will get me in trouble but not the eyes of your understanding being enlightened look that you may know I want to ask you a question ask yourself during the week do I know who I am do I know what I'm doing here do I know why I'm a preacher do I know why I'm a do I know why I'm a late person do I know why why do I come to church why do I take communion why do I live above what everybody else lives right I'll tell you something everybody thinks this is rules and regulations and I harp on coming to church well I'm not tell I'm just telling you what the Bible says and I'm telling you what brother B says see that's what I mean y'all got your your favorite quotes Oh Glory to God brother said he also said you can't wait till them doors get open see we don't want them that cuts but it don't cut me you know about what about 20 years ago I guess when I quit drinking yeah I did sorry 22 years ago when we were out in the world brother George the law of um if you blew if you you know you had one of those breathalyzer things if you blew it started out a long time ago they wouldn't even have one of them they just take you home well then they said no there's too many people dying of drinking alcohol and car wrecks so we going to put a lmon on it and it's 1.0 if you blow in this little thing and it's 1.0 you're going to jail all the people screamed then come up to about 10 years later from that they said no needs to be 008 all the people were screaming about that then it got to point and it's 006 or something now don't even don't even know but if it went to 006 are we going to have a sermon about this are we going to set it home and go oh my God I don't know how I can live it don't matter if it's 0 if you don't drink that love does not apply to you that's the same way with sin if you don't do it the law doesn't apply to you there's not a day I don't want to come to church now listen there's time when we have jobs I know that there's time when we have things that we have to do take a vacation that's fine but not 50 of 52 corre maybe two of 52 but not 50 of 52 see what I mean so I don't I want to be so dogmatic if you miss a Sunday if you want to go on vacation if that's your travel day I've done it before okay but then two Sundays later and then the third Sunday after that and then the fourth Sunday after that you'd be surprised if we kept it on the calendar how many times you got here and how many times you didn't but see I don't have to worry about that I do not have a calendar it says the days I go to church and the days I don't cuz I go to church that make me better than you no that law that God set not forsaking assembling yourself together that don't apply to me cuz I do it because I love him you ought to think about that sometime I do it because I love him I don't do it because I have what brother Dale listen there's been times he's my daddy I've known him longer than y'all have yeah but there's been days he has not wanted to come to church there's days he did not want to preach a sermon in this pull pit right because of sickness because of heartaches because of y'all and US me I'm talking about y'all I'm talking about all of us but did he ever Miss Heavenly days no he didn't miss right like the old the old joke about the you know the wife said honey we need to get them go to church he said I ain't going to church today she said you got to go to church he said I ain't nothing a bunch of Hypocrites go to that church he said I ain't going she said honey you got to get them go to church he said I ain't going none of them people they they I don't like none of them they don't like me either she said honey you got to go you're the pastor but you think every day's roses puffy clouds No but he that overcometh will I grant yeah now see there's a promise the promise in the Bible not that I'm going to dump you in here but you're going to overcome whatever it is out there in the world well here I go again but I want us to be the true church I don't want us to be somebody they just halfway does stuff correct amen none of us I don't want to believe that quote brother R said there's mate Believers unbelievers and True Believers in every crowd especially when he gets on Wednesday night where they ain't but about 20 of y'all here we got to looking around praise the Lord anyhow there's another one of them quotes we don't like especially when the congregation gets lower and lower and lower now it doesn't matter with several hundred people's here why it's like well it's them no it's probably you but Christ in the true church now look true church so there's a false church right remember we talk about the two vines or the two church we talk about the the the knowledge of Good and Evil and the tree of life but brother Brown said their their Vines were intertwined you couldn't really tell the difference because well listen the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a religious tree that's right it come from Satan who is way more anointed than some of us are he was anointed for we was on Earth I didn't say in heaven I said on Earth but there's a true church and I'm going to contend I'm going to fight for that to find that true church you need to fight for that true you need to find that true church not just a Hey listen not walls not walls not walls and ceilings you got to find a true church in here you said well then brother I set it home you've not found that true church cuz you got to put all the scriptures together can't do away with these over here okay just because that law is in is infor force of the drinking alcohol it's still there in case you slip up hello somebody all right but for us that don't drink what does it matter you see what I mean that's the way I look at the word of God if you do what the word of God says the best you can I mean the best you can the best you can then that do and don't stuff doesn't apply to you and me right if you do it out of a heart that loves him that that deep is a Love That No One Ever Knows listen I love J with all my heart but if she decide to leave this message and go somewhere else standing right here right cuz this is where the Deep calls from we see the people leaving the message like crazy now why there was no deep there was no new birth to respond to the preaching oh way he wanted to find find this over here and they wasn't this over here brother Brown missed it here this one missed it here this one missed it here well you can pick all you want to but Christ in the true church is what a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit now that's what we're dealing with now and let me tell you let me make a point here reason I've been reading this and I hadn't said what this was but the reason I've been reading this one quote is that Antichrist spirit is right there the opposite of that amen oh god listen the devil wants you to have virtue he wants you to have a little bit of power that he gives you oh he surely wants you to have knowledge sure he does but you got to be able to discern whether it's his knowledge or God's knowledge you got to discern whether it's the temperance that God give you where God himself could walk into a sanctuary and he could plat a rope and he could can make a plan of what he's fixing to do and he drives them jokers out of that Temple but he did one thing me and you can't do he went and died for him even though he drove them out he went and died for him can you do that no bless God they anyway the Antichrist is going to what come into the church make it lukewarm formal and Powerless it exposes Satan Reveals His work that's what we're doing now that's why a lot of times you don't need discernment in a church service daddy will tell you and all the other ministers to tell you you don't need discernment cuz you can see the demon in your face mine too demons bother you right now right right now listen if he can look right there if he can discredit God's word where does he need to start at right here amen he needs to start right here if he's going to discredit the word of God if he discredits this ministry then he's got all of you just one big he's got 100 people or 80 people that's why money women and popularity brother Brown said the three things that'll do a that'll do a a preacher in money women and popularity would to stay away from it but the discrediting of God's word right down to the time he's cast into the Lake of Fire he fights it he's fighting now he knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church all right you got to know there's a false and a true and they're sitting in every congregation and what she is and what she stands for you got to make a public announcement I am standing for the word of God and that public statement is made know because you don't drink you don't smoke you don't chew you don't curse your sisters don't cut your hair there's your declaration that God's word's right right what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern that's why knowledge is discernment you got to know that's why Brothers tell you they'll tell me many many times they love preaching here some don't some do most do because it it's there's not a push back when they make a statement listen you go to another church well some of you are not preachers but if we go to another church and we preach we hit a point and when we hit that point you just put it in Brackets they're all Shak in their head you put that point right here it's just soon you read the headlines of the newspaper and the Atlanta Journal Constitution cuz you got to back up and explain what you just said cuz you feel that right push back or you preach something like that's Daniel 70 weeks something a little controversial something a little deep you really get a you get a real you know you get a push back you kind of hit a wall well that that's the spirit of God Discerning I'm sorry Discerning that they don't know what they think they know and not that you're some you know don't let our head swell but like I said before we've been taught in this church taught and when you try to take teaching to another place and they're not used to it it really shuts them down amen a bob right Louise Dad yeah true all of you we know that for a fact and I'm not making anything out of it as far as us but it's it's a discernment that we go through it's a knowledge of God that we know what we're talking about I'm sorry we do cuz we've been taught well and we can discern you can discern and withstand the Antichrist spirit because what is an antichrist spirit it's not out there anything against the word of God is anti right anything against the word of God is anti so it's Antichrist anti- anointed Spirit but look if we can see that and overcome it Satan will be powerless do you believe what brother M says she'll be he'll be powerless before her listen in the Garden of Eden Satan walks up in the form of the Beast and by his subtility he overpowers the Bride of Adam he overpowers her with his influence with his spirit with his his with his uh lust and his and all the things and she falls for it right she falls for it and Adam couldn't save her cuz he's not a savior so he took her and said I'll take her sin we're going to live this way God said I'll put emoy I'm going to put a division here but I'm going to come back and I'll make sure that this next bride is not going to fall we read it this morning I'll read it again Satan hates Revelation but we love it amen with true Revelation in our lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against it not Revelation just what we get in this building right if it's really revealed to you it's like brother dev's always said how can you talk somebody out of a revelation if it's a real one it it becomes a part of you just like your hand your finger you can't deny once you get a revelation how do World somebody going to talk you out of water baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ how they can't but they'll try but look the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against us the bride but we will prevail over them here's right here why why would God call a people out of this evil age for his name the reason it is it's a tri his bride when she is made manifest been tried been proven prove to who not to the world to the Devil Himself like it was at the beginning so shall it be at the end as a seed starts in the ground it comes up through carrier's life but it ends up the same seed as it was when it went in the ground and the same way the seed now who's he talking about Jesus Christ said I got to go in the ground I got to die alone that I can bring up more fruit then what do we do we don't bring up we bring up stock yes we bring up tassel we bring up shuck but there's seed coming back because the seed is the multiplier everybody with me the seed is the multiplier the sh's not the multiplier you can't plant a stalk and get another ear of corn you got to plant corn seed to get an ear corn but it's got to go through those stages but it's got to be seed formed that's why brother brand the spoken word is the Original Seed amen seed shall not be air with the Shu oh my seed of discrepancy I know a lot of people talk about seed being this and that and the other but I believe that's true seed and it's been planted all right you didn't get it when you had the baby your wife wasn't pregnant when she was born she had to receive seed the same way the seed of deceit fell in the ground in Eden is the same way it ends up in the last days just as the gospel was when it fell to a denomination at NAA it ends up in a super organization just as the seed of the church fell back there with signs wonders and living Christ among them it ends up in the last days under the ministry of Malachi 4 and restores back again what's brother R talking about that those first three Church agents they had all the gifts working in their life they didn't have any denomination they didn't have any um trinitarian they have a first Trinity Church on every corner they didn't have a Baptist on every corner Presbyterian no it was a true word of God but they lost it they fell back there had signs and wonders so the ministry of Maliki for had to restore that back the original face that was faith that was once given we find now this evil age is to prove to Satan she's not like Eve that she's not that kind type of a woman amen and she will be Tried by his word the Bride As Adam's bride was Tried by the word remember she missed it on one phrase he's the same yesterday today and forever but she failed on One Promise under the temptation of the enemy face to face and now the people that's called for his name of course is his bride she is to come in contact oh praise God how many's glad they come in contact with the word of God ien I am glad we come contact with the word of God and this message which is the word of God not by just denominational truth but every word and as we were talking this morning I want God to be proud of us I want our father to be proud of us amen how's he going to be proud of you if you don't do what he says ain't going to happen so we got to go through virtue knowledge and get into Temperance besides this giving all diligence add to your fa Faith virtue and virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and patience godliness the Greek Lexicon for temperance is what self-control the virtue of one who Masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetite strong or robust having power over possessed of now look what was virtue virtue was having power now you got to learn to control it that's right see every one of these virtues are exactly where they're supposed to be you got to have virtue before you can give it so you got to have power but Power without character is satanic the prophet said so now we come up to knowledge the knowledge to know where to find out how to get rid of whatever we need to get rid of and then Temperance to have power over not using that power in the wrong way I mean how many of you no I'm not going to ask if you could get rid of somebody in your life you would I ain't talking about killing them and murder them I'm talking about just get rid of them just never have to deal with them again well then you ain't got the temperance yet you need some work cuz what does temperance do it Masters brother M I'm going to read you in a few minutes it Masters all circumstances curbing restraining controlling oneself temperate continent didn't the Bible tell us we'd be Inc continent you know what continent incontinent is don't you being able to hold yourself continent incontinent you can't hold yourself as we get older we should know that yeah Temperance doesn't mean stop drinking alcohol either no no Temperance doesn't mean alcohol it's cured not in this case this is Bible Temperance Holy Spirit Temperance so he's connecting the two together Holy Spirit Temperance not Temperance out there in the world to quit drinking listen if you're not drinking you don't need that kind of temperance right I do not have to control myself with a drinking problem you know having a drinking problem I'm over that I'm done with that all right so what's that Temperance talking about controlling me in every other way that's just one of the lust of the flesh but we're talking about Holy Spirit Temperance that means how to control your T I'm going to stop and drink some water right here right now let's read that again how to control your tongue not be a Tattler everybody's got to know everything just put it on Facebook how to control your temper not fly off every time somebody speaks cross to you help me Lord boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started now brother Brandon must know something about that aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church oh no it's because Joyce won't get right how many times brother D's many me it's just because now if brother Dale would get back right if everything's right we'd be out of here now let's work on us first amen I ain't as right as I want to be but I'm more right than I used to be same way with each one of us I believe we've grown this past year I believe a lot of people have really really grown and showed that they want to like I said before that Deep's got a called to want to go up that statue of perfect man that deep wants to make that we get better not better people better Christians boy a lot of us going to fall off before we get started aren't we then we wonder why God is not in his church so how important is these virtues then we wonder why God is not in his church doing Miracles and things that they used to do that's why we lost those virtues from the first church Church to right now that's why it took a prophet to preach in 1962 in October the stature of a perfect man why didn't he preach it in 1957 why didn't he preach it in 1947 why didn't he preach it in 1960 wasn't ready for it didn't have all the virtues in line maybe I know he didn't when he was a kid remember he would have been a murderer and he would have been he'd have committed suicide twice we can go on and on everybody with me okay and I'm telling you not stories I'm telling you stories he told it's on tape and it's his voice amen he told us he was going to commit suicide he told us he was going to grab that wire he right he told us he loaded that gun to shoot them boys with he told us he was going to take that whoever killed his dog and he's going to kill them right right that's right wow and we follow this man yeah cuz he's human and he had a gift add Temperance to it oh Temperance how to answer look and kindness when wrath is spoke to you somebody says you bunch of Holy Rollers down there don't jump up and run and pull your sleep roll your sleeve up see not that remember brother Brown did the same thing remember the the teacher told him to put the little string around his tie 10 knots or count to 10 or whatever it was said he got to about three throwed it down rolled his sleeves up and went to whipping them boys or they went to whipping him one of the two oh the prophet yep but later on he told that guy was fixing to break his face in he said no that ain't happening tonight what'd he say he said something right something deep came up and he said I felt sorry for that person I didn't want to kill him two people up in the up in the balcony a man and a woman a boy and a girl making love in the in the congregation during the service brother Brown told him stop stop that stop that well what would me and you have done yeah the holy spirit said whatever you say that's what'll happen and with eyes that may have looked like a little bit maybe he was mad at one time cuz they were desecrating the house of God he said I forgive you he said they could have carried them out in the stretcher dead if I'd have said it he said but I prayed for their soul I looked at the soul of those people and knew they need to be saved that's same way brother D's looked at all of us we go through all this chunk that we go through he's looking at at your soul he's not looking at you all right praise God don't jump out and roll up your sleeve now not that that talk with Godly love Temperance kindness is that the way you want to be congregation says amen when you're riled up now it didn't say you'll never get riled up see how that's written when you're riled up R not back let him be your example I don't think brother R knew anything about road rage but the devil of that road rage was there at that time it's just manifest itself now because every time we people think somebody passed me the other day I mean he was flying past on a double yellow line and praise God for stop signs the great equalizer is the traffic light right cuz he's like got caught in the light going up here in rabbit town he got caught in that light he couldn't get under it he got caught in that light and I pulled it right behind him I just smiled away I said you just wasted $20 worth of gas just to get 22 feet in front of me so anyway if thou be the Son of God turn these stones into bread he could have done it see there's there's a power inside of us that can do these things everybody with me there's a power inside of you to create a world and go live on it but why would we want to do that now we're here to save get Soul saved we're here to we're here to manifest the word of God oh it'd be real easy listen brother Randon was full of these of these uh quirks and all he he said Lord I just want to go up on the up in the highest mountain remember storm down like Elijah and just and go right back up and they said no you're a people person you're a people Prophet the people you have to live with your people and I love what uh uh one brother was saying the other day a shepherd's got to smell like a sheep the good and the bad think about that that's right if a new Shepherd comes in the Sheep are like that ain't Our Shepherd no cuz he had live with them you got to live with your people so you know what Jesus Christ took on our smell yeah the odor of death the odor of sin he took that on us on him from us now he's the great Shepherd that though you may stink like sin every once in a while even after you're born again he's still the shepherd standing right there with you with a with one of those Shepherd hooks of love not a fish hook a Shepherd hook that's it when they called him Bells above he said I'll forgive you for that they pulled handful of beard out of his face and spit in his face said come down off the cross he said father forgive them they don't even know what they're doing when he had the gift he knowed all things for in him was the fullness of the godhead bodily they had seen him perform Miracles by telling people what was wrong with him and so forth they put a rag around his head and around his eyes and hit him on the head and said prophesy tell us who hit you we'll believe you see he had Temperance now if you got it like that add that to your faith if you still blow up in SASS and fuss and stew and carry on uhhuh you ain't got no you can't add that cuz it won't add it won't vulcanize you couldn't take a piece of rubber you know and vulcanize it to a piece of iron it just won't work no it's got to be flexible didn't didn't didn't God tell us he put a heart of Flesh inside of us and take the Heart of Stone out cuz Stone hard flesh is pliable rubber's pable you know vulcanize it to a piece of iron you can't do that it just won't work now it's got to be flexible just like the rubber is and when your faith and your Temperance looks becomes the same kind of Holy Ghost Temperance that he had then it will vulcanize with him you're added to it let's keep reading just for a second then we'll we'll um take communion when your knowledge is like his knowledge I come to do thy will oh God see with the father's word he defeated every devil right with the father's word he defeated every devil heavens and earth will pass away but the word will not see when you got that kind of knowledge it'll vulcanize ize with your faith when you get the right kind of temperance like he had it'll vulcanize if you hadn't just a man-made halfway sou up most of y'all know what that means you're from the south you should know it sou up belief or Temperance oh I to slap him down but maybe better not cuz they might put my name in the paper or Facebook our Instagram our Twitter those of you that don't know that Louise does ask him Netflix no they won't put you on Netflix I guess do that you're not that famous cuz they might put your name in the paper about it that ain't the kind of temperance he's talking about cuz you know one time back in the Old Testament there was a prophet of God he was walking down a road and a bunch of children came up to him and started harassing him start calling him names see we hate to you can do a lot of things but don't call me a name cuz I take that personal you're talking to me don't do that to me you talking about me you talking about me yeah I'm talking about you but what happened there was no love in that prophet's eyes as far as AG goty love he turned and looked at him and he said in other words curse you and two bears two she Bears two big grizzly bears ate those or killed those 40 kids he didn't have Temperance he didn't have Holy Ghost Temperance because he didn't have the Holy Ghost but me and you got what would we do if somebody kept harassing us and telling us just same way with with with all of us if we keep hammering on something like coming to church and different things if y'all could call two she Bears out of the wood you would I know what most people do they want you to shut up if you start digging into their demons you say all that's never happened how many times you got people if Donnie was here his dad brother Tom blessed his heart he tried his best but sometimes he was he was the two she bears and he was a little over y'all know we all we if everybody knows him they chuckle and they laugh that's just the way brother Tom was but he didn't have a lot of temperance for people that didn't like the word of God okay he just he didn't he'll tell you if he's sitting here today he'll tell you but you know what he's on the other side he ain't got to worry about that no more cuz remember that has an end that had an expiration date the day he passed from this life into the other life he ain't got to worry about that no more he ain't got to worry about hurting people's feelings but brother Tom buddy I'm telling you if he if he started digging into you it was like them claws were going and it was done with love okay but you didn't want to be around him Anna sister me either me either he'd come at you I mean with a if he had a if it's such thing as a four barrel gun he would had all four of them pointed at you I mean it's like and it wasn't pointed at you you had him right here but he was doing it out of love he was trying his best to get you to see the word of God like he could see it his Zeal was overwhelming and you know what I happened I didn't want to be around him I see him over there how many people you come never mind I ain't going to jump in y'all life you ever seen somebody you did not want to be around that's why that's why when you look at somebody that's got Temperance like brother brandham did he didn't avoid nobody he knew they hated him he knew they wanted to destroy him uh um religiously or or or in that realm discredit him they're doing it now but he knew they were discrediting him and he didn't know you didn't know as an outsider you never knew knew who he liked and didn't like is know what is that what Billy Paul said he said that was one great thing my daddy had you couldn't tell who was his enemies and who was his friends he just brought them all drew the circle bigger and just grabbed big old bear hugs and started pulling them in we don't do that we got our favorites and you let it know I like that person I like that person I like that person I like that I don't like that person I like that person over there I like that one now I like him now I like her but I don't like that one over there do you like that no I don't like that one but when you can really with the sweetness from your heart forgive every man we still believe brother Brown was the prophet right I'm reading a quote hold your peace let it be gone see then it'll vulcanize you can add that to your faith amen then I remember I read you this I'm going to read it again for those of you that weren't here the impact of vulcanization on rubber science direct it must be true some from the internet explains that vulcanization changes the physical properties of rubber by forcing it to retract today we are rubber right of course there are mechanical methods that can force rubber to retract as well the difference with vulcanization however is that it retains the original shape of the rubber right when vulcanization is performed on rubber the rubber shrinks while retaining its original shape may I shrink and let God raise up vulcanization essentially scales down rubber to a smaller size make me small Lord all without deforming or altering its shape in addition to altering its size while retaining its shape vulcanization also protects rubber from future deformation praise God praise God I don't want to be deformed in the future if it's done right it won't as it shrinks rubber hardens and becomes less vulnerable to deformation it may still deform when exposed to enough stress can everybody raise a hand on that one yep we had stress we got it okay but remember when you put stress on rubber what does it do it just when you let go of it it just snaps right back in place again you ought to try that sometime let some of your stress go and let it snap back in place but vulcanized rubber won't deform as easily as conventional non vulcanized rubber rubber also becomes harder when vulcanized which substantially subsequently increases its tensil strength as we receive these virtues God's Vulcanizing them to us if we do it right and we become what weaker we become stronger amen that's what it says we become stronger by the vulcanization process its tensil strength and reduces the risk of physical damage un likee with thermoplastic chemical process the effects of vulcanization are permanent praise God after a rubber object or material has been vulcanized it can't be reversed amen once you get Temperance and that vulcanized to your soul and it's Godly Temperance you cannot lose that just like you cannot you lose your new birth it can't be reversed so no devil no Spirit evil can go in there and play with it and then pull it apart if it's been vulcanized and how what is the vulcanization process heat heat it'll heat and meld together and be twice as strong may God do that to each and every one of us may he put us in that fiery furnace oh I don't want to go in the fiery furnace Lord put me in there put me in that fiery furnace cuz you know what I know what's going to happen there going to be a Fourth Man stand up there going to be somebody appear that's going to help me into that in that fiery furnace and I'm going to come out not smelling like smoke but

prophet of God preached a sermon running from the presence of the Lord and many prophets have done that in the past many men many great men have tried to hide theirself Gideon and all the different ones have tried to hide from the presence of the Lord because there's a there's a reverence there there's an anointing but Lord God you told us that we need to come boldly to that Throne we need to

bush but Lord You're our father and as the Bible says what father would not give a son that's hungry a piece of bread but give him a rock Lord you're not not that way Satan is but you're not Lord we

mistakes that we make and the many little edoc secrecies that we we have issues with Lord I pray that you'd take those out of the way Lord that we might not be bound by by all not be bound by by by the as we was talking about the the laws of of the alcohol and different thing we're free we're free from the law of sin and death Lord but we bind ourself and I pray that you'd bring us out from under that Lord let the Deep call to the Deep let us hear from you Lord let us take you Lord and not the world let us take make you and not our negative thoughts and our negative ideas we don't like this one and we don't like that one we don't like this way and we don't like that way Lord I pray that you'd take the eyes have of the Holy Ghost and that you would soothe us with that ointment Lord May the oil has run down Aaron's head to his neck his face shoulders all the way down his body he was just totally Anointed with with that oil of the natural Lord I pray that you'd anoint us with the oil of the spiritual father that you would give us spiritual Revelation spiritual Insight Lord let us become more spiritual people from the front to the back lord just bless us now as we get ready to take this communion father we ask your blessings Lord on the people that are sick the ones that are sin sick Lord the ones that are backslid lord they're all they're all here and now we pray Lord that you would just be with them Lord raise them up for your honor and glory Lord let them be manifestations of sons of God not manifestations of the devil father let us Lord be in your control as the song says you've got it all in control father I pray that you'd be with us now in the furth of this service bless each one that's here Lord may as we take this communion that we remember that one evening when you took the Bread and Wine and you said this is a new testament the testator has to die to make a new testament and Lord we live under that New Testament in your blood and we take your body as the stripes were laid for us to be healed Lord we thank you for that thank you for salvation thank you for Redemption thank you for placing your own life inside of us there's many people billions of people in this world that need that Lord there's people in this congregation that needs it Lord Lord I pray that you would Minister to them Lord not just here in this building but everywhere they go let it not leave them let it just gnaw at them let it let let them Lord not sleep at night until they hear from you Lord until they find the real peace the real peac maker the real Joy maker the real Jehovah Gyra our provider and all the other compound names of Jehovah Lord we appreciate all those titles but we know you as husband we're Mrs Jesus Christ and I pray that we begin to act like that Lord and will not make you ashamed that you'll be proud of us I believe in John 17 you were proud of a group of people because you asked the father to protect us while we were here and Lord that protection comes from an eternal God that created the whole world and I thank you for that Lord I Thank you for the eyes of our of our spiritual realm have been enlightened we see Revelation that others cannot see it's become a mystery to the world but it's as the the prophet said the mystery is now history we don't need the revelation of the serpent seed we have it we don't need the Revelation to water baptism we have it and Lord may we use it now Lord may we take these things that we preached and Lord may it go to each one of our hearts and that you'll settle us and ground Us in the word of God it's tough Lord you know that you were here there were many times you had such an anointing on you but the people didn't believe in you so you had to leave the room or you had to tell the people to leave so that you could heal and raise Jar's daughter so Lord let that those people not be here those Spirits Lord may we not be bound may we be able to preach freely may we be able to receive freely freely receive from the word of God freely receive all the promises of God all the things that you've give us already in the Bible there has not to be another Bible be written it's already here we just got to do what it says father just bless us now in the furtherment of this service as we take communion bind our hearts together in you Lord let there not be any root of bitterness or G or anything like that Lord that'll separate us from you or even from each other may we bind together Lord as a church around our pastor Lord and pray for him as every day we pray for heal healing of his body Lord but we also pray for Spiritual healing of all of our bodies that we become to that statue of perfect man somebody that that you're proud of somebody that you can be so proud of you can say hey devil have you considered Spoken Word Church oh you got got a hedge around them you man they've been given the word well that's okay go ahead do what you want to but don't take their don't you can't take their life and when job came out of the end of this thing guess what he was twice the man he was before I pray that we become twice the man because you restored everything to him twice is what you said Lord I pray that you'll give us Lord a blessing from Heaven that we can't contain may this year be a supernatural year for us Lord may it be a time that we learn more from you we learn how to be like you we learn how to act like you act we learn how to do the things that you did I believe if we are believing that we are Christians that that's got to happen because that deep calls into my heart for every person to be able to stand on their own and have their own experience with God and their own virtue and their own knowledge their own Temperance and go through trials Lord and and not be that they have to run and cry and try to find the the preacher or the pastor that Lord you'll you'll help them to grow into individuals with God and that they can speak the word just like any of us speak the word Lord and that Satan will have to back up you're defeated devil you just don't know it yet these people know that and Lord we're going to thrive on that because it's a revelation that you can't get father I pray that you'd be with us now as we take communion bless us in Jesus name amen anybody have a a need or anything before we before we head into the the U communion and foot washing we appreciate appreciate each and every one of you we appreciate the Lord giving us strength and giving us an opportunity to speak or this of God or not you got to decide where this worth it or not some people it's not worth it some people would rather drink a beer and go to church I was one of them okay okay I was one of them so don't tell me that Spirit don't get on us all but if you're born again that spirit's gone you want to be here in church or be around the bride I like being around the bride I don't like being around the world do you I'll be glad when this thing is over I'll be glad when I talking about when this all has an expiration date this part has an expiration date God does not have one and this world won't have one either if you'll realize what the Bible says that it's just going to burn it over it's going to still be here just like he burnt you over and you're still going to be here then we're going to come and live right here you know why cuz we weren't born on the moon we weren't born on Mars well somebody may say we were but where are you from I was born on this Earth I was born on this Earth from this earth right so we have that connection and God so much thought of that he said okay I'll put you back down there cuz remember what when brother Bron went across the curtain of time he was just astonished when they said we don't eat over here we don't have our regular bodies uh uh we got to go back to Earth what he looks back and sees his he said he sees his old decrepit body laying there he said I don't want to go back to that in other words they said look we don't eat or drink here in other words they're not complete humans they knew they had to come back amen and pick up their Earthly bodies that's how much God thinks of me and you he preserves this Earth Burns it off takes care of all the sin Burns it off and lets us live here for an eternity and just enjoy boy God there's no way we can do it because we're creatures of time we're creatures of of of heartaches and trials and tribulations but folks it'll be over not too long let's read for I have received of the Lord that which I delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the same night in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me in other words a new testament was coming and when he had given sa he break it and said take eat this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me after the same manner he took the cup and he sued it saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this do you as often as you drink it in remembrance of me for as often as you eat the bread and drink the cup you do show the Lord's death till he come that's why brother Brown says only Christians should take communion right if you have an ought against somebody say God I'll take care of it but I'm going to take communion I feel good taking it now I'm okay but you better go take care of what you need to take care of because you're going to eat and drink damnation if you don't have a revelation about what's going on here all right for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup you do show the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body who is the Lord's body me and you for this cause many are weak and sickly among you now Jesus Jesus has made his statement and Paul is now interpolating if you'll look at your Bible what Jesus said is in red the rest of it is Paul explaining why Jesus said what he did all right for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep could observe that that people were taking communion that weren't supposed to and they were dying or they were getting sick or there was problems I'm just reading the Bible CU that was his observation it wasn't that he got this Revelation it was going to happen it was happening right then all right said for he that eateth and drinketh un worly eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this caused many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged but when we are judged we are chasen to the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat tarry one for another and if any man hunger let him eat at home that you come not together under condemnation and the rest of I set in order when I come he he he gets up to a group of of people in carinth and they're they're drinking they're drinking their meat and all that stuff and getting drunk at the Lord's table that's why he had to come and set that down so no no no this is the Lord's Supper this is not your regular meal you need to keep that separate this is what we're doing here this is Discerning the body and blood of the Lord right here it's not that we're just sitting down and and calling for a meal you know let's just go to you know Golden Corral and that'll be our Lord's Supper that's kind of what they were doing in Corinthians but Paul being a prophet he comes in now he doesn't you know bless God you're all going to hell no he just told him what to do and you know what I believe they did it cuz I some of them got a real good Revelation when he said that some of you will sleep and some of you get sick and some of you going to die that really I mean well you know that went right here that went right to their soul but they believe if they believe what Paul said so if you believe what the prophet said and you believe what I'm telling you same way happened in here you got discern the body of the and blood of the Lord why do we have issues and problems because we don't do things right Amen brother Dell come up here and pray for the for the uh communion today everybody all right we we good with that I am so we're going to do it anyway I miss brother Dale standing here going he took bread and blessed it yep there you go you know what to do father we thank you thank you Lord for the opportunity Lord able to take this communion yes Lord make it in your honor and your glory make it in your ways Lord we just committed to you in Jesus name amen that's coming a day when we'll understand this more and more cuz that's what we going to do at the marriage supper we're going to take communion and Jesus so told us he told us that night right there he said I won't do this until I come I won't do this until I come back I'll not drink of the food of the vine so he's not up in heaven drinking wine are eating unleaving bread no you know what he done he transferred that to us see there's so many times that that Jesus Sanctified himself for me and you not for yourself go ahead father we thank you Lord for an opportunity to partake of this wine and the bread Lord we know that it has symbolic meanings to it amen but they are true meanings we just ask you to commit everything to you in your your ways we love you we honor you in Jesus name amen amen yes amen come morning how walk by the river how rest neath the Ever Green Tree I'll carry my cross through the midnight come morning there's glory for me sometimes s I'm despised and rejected you're going to be and I question oh Father how long you get a little bit of patience at Mount Calvary and what it gives me the strength to go on gives me the strength to go on come morning it'll be over with won't have to worry about it no more brother Brown said 6:00 to 9:00 in the morning sometime when the Sun starts coming up we're going to leave this place the resurrection is going to happen and we're going to be out of here the world will just keep on going never know a thing about it maybe your neighbor will think maybe you went on a vacation or something maybe the neighbor thought maybe you got crazy and went up in a mountain somewhere you know they think you crazy anyway so you know you disappeared in one of them camps one of them one of them um Fellowship meetings or or one of them special meetings that we go to a lot that's all right it'll be a special meeting I'll promise you that it'll be one like you never had here before morning at Mount Calvary and it gives me the strength to go on come morning oh that'll be a reality we sing it now but it'll be a reality one day and when it becomes a reality you'll understand and listen to yourself singing this song today you'll hear it and you'll say oh the TOs of Life are going to be over we've come to the end you love the Lord this was made with holy hands and this was made with holy hands so we're doing exactly what the Bible tells us to do we didn't buy this and it's not going to be held over it's going to be burnt the Wine's going to be put back together and it's just going to keep getting better and better just keeps working all the way through for years oh they think they got vintage wine several hundred, a bottle not like this wine this wine is fixing to go into an eternal vessel and it's going to become part of us and then the Lord's going to smile down and said hey they're doing what I told them to do let's just give them a special blessing today let's take communion you know I was thinking the other day while they take that up um well while they was taking while they're taking this up um you know sometimes we stand around and we talk about uh uh Brother Gary Atkins and the one just went on and I was uh just kind of trying to remember everybody you know the tatums and and brother Mo and I'm not finished with my Bible I need to never put my sword down and um I was thinking about that the other day now whether you think I'm crazy or not that's all right but the thought came to me he said well when you call their name said I just reach over and nudge them and say hey they're talking about you hey they're talking about you cuz they're over there in a just a bliss you know they're in just you know they're in just a a state of Euphoria they're not here going I think we might get to the house today I got to work tomorrow no they're waiting on us they're over there with all the ones that's went on with brother brandham and all the different ones and we say their name over here that's all I was doing I was s trying to remember the Nam T different ones all of us has got somebody that's passed on that we're connected to all of us and the thought came to me he said well said when you call their name said we just nudge them over there on the other side and say hey they're talking about you you say that's crazy I don't think it is how many times brother Brown said you know Lord let them look over the banister of time and look down and see what's going on I think they do that especially when we say talk about Gary talk about different ones Brother Richard Marlo different ones see they're doing it now hey they're talking about you they haven't forgot you but you know what I think they're telling they're telling the angel to tell back to us hurry up we want to see you again we want to pick up our bodies and we want to be humans again supper being ended the devil now having part in the put in the heart of Judas this car at Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the that the father had given all things into his hand and he was come from God and went to God he rises from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he pth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel where withth he was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto him Lord are you going to wash my feet Jesus said um what I do thou knowest not now but probably in just about 11 days you're going to understand what's going on day of Pentecost but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt never washed my feet Jesus answered and said if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me Simon Peter said unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needeth not to save to wash his feet but is clean ever with and you are clean but not all talking about Judas for he knew who should betray him therefore he said you are not all clean so after he had washed their feet he took his garment laid it down he just he's the buddy you know he just went over there brother Jordan just sat down beside of him probably in one of those chairs like that after it got finished cuz they're all probably going what' he do that for why' you do that's our Master that's our that's our teacher uh Peter says Thou Art the Son of God why are you doing this and I'm sure that was all in their minds and he discerned it so after he had washed their feet and taken His Garment was set down down he said know you what I've done to you you call me master and Lord and you say well for so I am if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet you also ought to wash one another's feet for I have given you an example that you should do as I have done to you verely verily in other words listen listen I say unto you the servant is not greater than his Lord neither he that is sent greater than he that sent him if you know these things happy happy are you if you do them let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this day you've give us I pray as we go and and wash our brothers and sisters feet Lord I pray that you would give us Lord a supernatural charge Lord that that we're doing as you told us to do we're every the instructions of what you told us to do Lord we're going to do today father I pray I pray that you just bless now and be with the ones that
