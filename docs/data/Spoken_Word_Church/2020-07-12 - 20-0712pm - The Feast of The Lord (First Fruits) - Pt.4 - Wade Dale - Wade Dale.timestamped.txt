[34:37] week the day of the resurrection we
[34:41] actually every Sunday we celebrate the
[34:45] feast of firstfruits

[36:30] as brother Dale was talking this morning
[36:32] you know foreknowledge is what God saw
[36:36] predestination is the predetermined
[36:38] journey that he saw the journey is what
[36:41] sent right now on the journeys what's in
[36:43] between this is your journey this is
[36:44] your overcoming this is your blessing
[36:46] party this is your part to do
[36:49] hey man this is your part to do
[36:52] God knows who's gonna make it who's not
[36:55] you just don't yet but if you'll do I
[36:57] was telling brother Bob a few minutes
[36:59] ago I've been reading in chronicles and
[37:02] you reading chronicles that that goddess
[37:05] that God will tell this king he said
[37:06] I'll bless you as long as you do this
[37:09] this and this
[37:10] and he would bless like even Hezekiah he
[37:14] blessed blessed blessed blessed but all
[37:15] of a sudden one day they decided to go
[37:17] after another God you know what the
[37:19] first thing God did he sent some
[37:21] Amalekites he sent some Gebbie sites and
[37:25] he sent some websites and he sent some
[37:27] Palestinians and and he would send two
[37:29] men to remind him to
[37:33] remind him who they were then they will
[37:36] get on her knees and say God forgive us
[37:38] and then he would turn around and give
[37:39] them the Bible and drive him right back
[37:40] out so that you know what that's a
[37:42] that's a type of me and you that's our
[37:44] struggles every day we we get these
[37:47] little ice in us and then we we have to
[37:49] get God to come and say
[37:51] you're not part of that
[37:53] come back and do what I'm do what I'm
[37:55] asking you to do and everything will be
[37:57] fine so we thank God the hand of the
[38:00] Lord is upon us in our journey so here's
[38:03] the Feast of the Lord firstfruits part 4
[38:05] Leviticus 23 it's kind of a long read
[38:07] but we're going to read it anyway it's
[38:09] the word of the Lord hey if people can
[38:10] stand for six hours and listen to the
[38:12] Word of God being spoken in Ezra's time
[38:14] then why can't we stand for four five
[38:16] minutes for this so and the Lord spake
[38:19] unto Moses saying speaking to the
[38:21] children of Israel and saying to them
[38:22] concerning the Feast of the Lord which
[38:23] you shall proclaim to be holy
[38:24] convocations
[38:26] even these are my feasts so they're not
[38:28] Israel's feasts they're God's feast six
[38:31] days shall work be done but on the
[38:33] seventh day is the Sabbath of rest on
[38:35] holy convocation you shall do no work
[38:37] therein and this the Sabbath of the Lord
[38:39] and all your dwellings now that has
[38:41] nothing to do physically with the
[38:43] seventh feast days he has given an
[38:45] ordinance - they gonna work six days and
[38:47] take one day off which is the Sabbath
[38:49] which would be Saturday all right
[38:51] everybody got that saying man all right
[38:53] these are the Feast of the Lord even
[38:55] holy convocations which you shall
[38:56] proclaim in their seasons now he's
[38:58] fixing to tell them what the Feast are
[39:00] in the fourteenth day of the first month
[39:02] what is the first month
[39:05] Apryl Arneson are march/april ok Nissen
[39:08] are a bit in the fourteenth day of the
[39:10] first month and even is the Lord's
[39:12] Passover and on the fifteenth day of the
[39:15] same month is the feast of unleavened
[39:16] bread we've done been through those two
[39:18] we'll go over them just for a second to
[39:20] stir up your mind seven days you must
[39:23] eat unleavened bread and the first day
[39:26] you shall have a holy convocation you
[39:27] shall do no servile work therein so the
[39:29] first day the holy convocation but you
[39:32] shall offer an offering made by fire
[39:33] into the Lord seven days in the seventh
[39:36] day as another holy convocation you
[39:38] shall do no servile work therein in
[39:40] other words no service work all right
[39:42] because you can cook and do other things
[39:44] but you can't work physically labor for
[39:47] money and the Lord spake unto Moses
[39:49] saying now here's one we're getting to
[39:51] know speaking of the children of Israel
[39:53] and say unto them when ye be coming to
[39:55] the land which I give unto you and shall
[39:59] reap the harvest thereof then you shall
[40:03] bring a sheath now so remember they
[40:06] didn't do this during the journey
[40:09] they only did this when they went into
[40:12] got into the Promised Land
[40:13] that's when they held this feast he just
[40:16] said that speaking of the children when
[40:17] ye be coming to the land which I give
[40:20] unto thee now the wilderness wasn't a
[40:21] land that God give them that was a
[40:24] wilderness of sin all right so when they
[40:27] come into the land brother Dale talks
[40:29] about many times the old corner of the
[40:31] land they they didn't they didn't plant
[40:33] this they just harvested and shall reap
[40:35] the harvest thereof then you shall bring
[40:37] a sheaf of the first fruits in other
[40:39] words the first part of the harvest unto
[40:42] the priest and he shall wave the sheaf
[40:45] before the Lord to be accepted for you
[40:48] on the morrow after the Sabbath so now
[40:51] this has a specific date it is done on
[40:54] the day after the Sabbath so that would
[40:57] be Monday the first day of the week kind
[41:01] of strange Jesus rose when everyone and
[41:03] you shall offer that day
[41:05] when you we wave the sheaf and he lamb
[41:10] without blemish of the first year for a
[41:11] burnt offering unto the Lord the meat
[41:14] offering there shall be two tents deal
[41:16] there's going to be three different
[41:16] offerings a lamb two tense deal the fine
[41:20] flower an offering made by fire for a
[41:22] sweet savor and a drink offering so
[41:24] there's three different offerings in
[41:25] this and a drink offering thereof shall
[41:27] be of wine the fourth part of it him and
[41:29] you shall eat now this is important and
[41:32] you shall eat neither bread nor parts
[41:35] corn not green ears until the self-same
[41:39] day that you have brought an offering
[41:40] into unto your God it shall be a statute
[41:43] forever throughout your generations and
[41:45] all your dwellings in other words you
[41:48] can't eat it until the priest way--but a
[41:50] man so the priest had to take it and
[41:54] wave it and then you could eat let's be
[41:56] seated and let's eat for a little while
[42:02] so the first feast we we're going to go
[42:04] over this real quick let's pass over now
[42:06] we know what Passover was so let's go to
[42:08] Exodus 12 and look real quick
[42:11] the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in
[42:14] the land of Egypt this month shall being
[42:16] you the beginning of month so God told
[42:18] them what was the first day of their
[42:20] year this wasn't man thinking it up God
[42:23] told them this month shall be unto you
[42:25] the beginning of months it shall be the
[42:27] first month of the year to you speaking
[42:30] to the congregation of Israel saying in
[42:32] the tenth day of this month you shall
[42:34] take a mat every man a lamb according to
[42:37] the house of their father a lamb for a
[42:39] house so on the tenth day of the month
[42:41] you took a lamb you had to put it up for
[42:43] the four days and then you made the
[42:45] sacrifice if the household be too little
[42:47] for the lamb let him and his neighbor
[42:48] next to his house take it according to
[42:50] the number of the souls every man
[42:52] according to the eating shall make your
[42:53] count for the lamb your lamb shall be
[42:55] without blemish you had four days to
[42:58] check it out
[42:59] justification sanctification baptism the
[43:01] Holy Ghost in the word you had four days
[43:03] to check this lamb out
[43:06] it can't be blink can't be wrong can't
[43:09] have a blemish a male of the first year
[43:12] there's your first fruits coz we're
[43:14] going to get into this there was an
[43:15] offering that everybody had to make ever
[43:18] certain a certain period of time you
[43:20] even brought you your first son and
[43:24] offered them to the priests now not as
[43:26] an offering but you did bring them
[43:29] before the priest and the priest was
[43:30] sanctified firstfruits and firstborn
[43:33] always meant something to God why
[43:34] because he sent His only Son the first
[43:37] begotten of the Father your lamb shall
[43:40] be without blemish a male of the first
[43:41] year you shall take it out from the
[43:43] Sheep or from the goat and you shall
[43:45] keep it up until the fourteenth day of
[43:47] the same month and the whole Assembly of
[43:49] the congregation of Israel shall kill it
[43:51] in the evening time all right there
[43:53] buddy got that say a man and they shall
[43:56] take up the blood and strike it on the
[43:58] side of the door so you had the doorpost
[44:00] all right sign of the Cross and the
[44:02] upper doorpost of the house wherein they
[44:04] shall eat it every house had to have a
[44:07] lamb
[44:07] every house had to show the blood over
[44:10] the doorpost so we showed that that was
[44:13] a personal relationship with God you
[44:15] have to have your own lamp God had to
[44:18] die for you not for me
[44:20] but no God died for me no you
[44:23] but you had to have a part you had to
[44:25] know that he died for you but most
[44:27] people in the world and I hate to say
[44:29] this but they keep Jesus on the cross
[44:31] and they say oh he died for he died for
[44:34] my sins or he died for the sin of the
[44:35] world no it's personal to me I
[44:38] love that song when he was on the cross
[44:40] you need to sing that for me
[44:42] please do that when because you've sung
[44:45] it before when he was on the cross what
[44:47] I was on his mind if the Bible tells us
[44:51] that we were engraved in the palm of the
[44:53] hand when that nail went through that
[44:55] palm it went right through my name
[44:56] Amen I believe that you believe that if
[44:59] you want to but I believe he died for me
[45:01] you got to make sure that you believe he
[45:03] died for you same way with this lamb
[45:06] this lamb especially the firstborn kids
[45:09] did dad have we've done this thing right
[45:11] you killed it rice you put the blood
[45:12] over the doorpost why because your life
[45:15] depends on it
[45:17] the first guy that was born hit because
[45:19] the first people that were going to die
[45:22] were the first the firstfruits are the
[45:25] first people of the the firstborn was
[45:27] going down that night
[45:29] that's how serious it was they shall
[45:32] take the blood and strike it on this
[45:33] post and the doorpost of the house
[45:35] wherein they shall eat it they shall eat
[45:36] who eat the flesh in that night roast
[45:40] with fire and unleavened bread and with
[45:41] bitter herbs so this is where you begin
[45:43] with unleavened bread and with bitter
[45:44] herbs they shall eat it
[45:46] ain't not a bit wrong or sudden at all
[45:48] with water wife's got a burnt with fire
[45:50] gotta have burnt with fire his head with
[45:54] his legs and with the pertinence thereof
[45:55] and you shall let nothing of it remain
[45:57] until the morning and we explain that we
[45:59] burned the communion bread every night
[46:01] before the next day because you don't
[46:03] want to hold over type of the manna type
[46:06] of the Word of God we love what brother
[46:08] Andrew said last Sunday but we're not
[46:10] going to go back
[46:12] sure we're going to remember what he
[46:14] said and we're going to roll that around
[46:15] in our head and we're going to let the
[46:17] Holy Ghost take it but we're gonna move
[46:19] on we're not going keep that's why I'm I
[46:22] hate to say this but there's a lot of
[46:24] people living like brother Browne said
[46:25] looking in a rearview mirror God sent a
[46:28] prophet God sent a prophet God sent a
[46:30] prophet we already know that
[46:33] the devil knew it before you did
[46:36] but what are we doing with it we got to
[46:39] move on
[46:40] not going past him no we just got to get
[46:43] fueled up with what he's already saying
[46:46] and you shall let nothing of it remain
[46:49] until the morning and that which
[46:51] remaineth you shall burn with fire and
[46:53] thus shall you eat it with your loins
[46:55] girded your shoes on your feet why told
[46:58] you God it's fixing to put these
[46:59] Israelites in motion all right and your
[47:03] shoes on your feet your staffing your
[47:04] hand and you shall eat it in haste it is
[47:07] the Lord's Passover for I will pass
[47:10] through the land of Egypt this night and
[47:11] I will smite all the firstborn in the
[47:13] land of Egypt both man and beast and
[47:15] against all the gods of Egypt I will
[47:17] execute judgment I am the Lord
[47:20] Harrison you'd be in trouble
[47:24] you're the firstborn buddy you better
[47:27] make sure that blood is over the
[47:28] doorpost and the blood shall be for you
[47:31] for a token upon the house you know why
[47:34] because the death angel went by and he
[47:36] would looked at the house and if there
[47:39] was no blood over it he can enter but if
[47:43] there was a blood if there was a blood
[47:45] sacrifice there was something died
[47:48] something died
[47:50] to take his place
[47:53] Jesus Christ died to take our place so
[47:57] that we can't die or we may physically
[47:59] die but you can't die a Christian cannot
[48:01] die we only sleep
[48:03] amen and that's because of the same
[48:07] curse because what we got caught into
[48:08] what like brother Dale said garden you
[48:10] all this I mean this is not a surprise
[48:11] nothing is a surprise to God and all
[48:15] this virus and I that's not surprised
[48:16] you know what he wants to know what
[48:18] you're gonna do about it
[48:21] you can swivel up and die if you want to
[48:23] but I'm still gonna be kicking and going
[48:25] as we keep going kicking and going and
[48:27] the blood shall be for your token upon
[48:29] the houses where you are
[48:32] houses God don't live in brick mortar he
[48:37] lives in houses and the blood shall be
[48:40] for your token upon the houses where you
[48:42] are when I see the Blood I will pass
[48:45] over you and the plague shall not be
[48:47] upon you to destroy you when I smite the
[48:50] land of Egypt and this day shall be unto
[48:52] you for a memorial and you shall keep it
[48:54] as a feast to the Lord throughout your
[48:56] generations you shall keep it as a feast
[48:58] by an ordinance forever
[49:01] amen I
[49:04] love that scripture even more and more
[49:06] so now let's look at the the bullet
[49:09] points that we came up with on that one
[49:11] and we'll just keep on going
[49:12] pull that one up if you don't mind the
[49:14] first month which was a bitter lesson
[49:16] which is March April and if you'll
[49:18] understand
[49:19] what we were talking about a couple of
[49:21] Sundays ago
[49:23] the priest literally he didn't just have
[49:26] a job preaching to the people the priest
[49:29] most time was the doctor and all the
[49:32] other different things and during that
[49:34] time he was a lot more than just a
[49:36] preacher but the priest had to go out on
[49:39] the last day of the year the last day of
[49:41] the month and he had to look up in the
[49:43] sky and he had to see how much of the
[49:46] Moon was left over so that he could say
[49:49] okay let's go to the next month or less
[49:51] add another month or go back and have
[49:53] the same month over again thereby
[49:55] understand it cuz it's a moon cycle it's
[49:57] not it's not we have just a set calendar
[49:59] that's why we have to have a leap year
[50:02] okay we have to have a leap year to keep
[50:04] everything coming back because the feast
[50:06] were starting to be in the summer and in
[50:08] the winter and there's no when they're
[50:09] supposed to be they're supposed to be in
[50:11] the spring and in the fall their buddy
[50:14] got that say ma'am because in the
[50:16] wintertime everything's dead the
[50:18] summertime was everything's hot like
[50:21] right now
[50:22] so on the tenth day of the month they
[50:24] put the lamb up they killed it in the
[50:27] evening each home had to have a lamb
[50:31] you had to eat unleavened bread it had
[50:35] to do with the firstborn
[50:37] they had to be ready to go and the blood
[50:40] had to be over the door but I love these
[50:42] streets I want you to meditate a little
[50:44] bit on these three things here and look
[50:47] how it
[50:48] shows us that
[50:51] could we be in the same spot and need
[50:56] these three things
[50:58] right and then we need these three
[51:01] things we needed a prophet to come in
[51:04] the last day to give us correct
[51:06] instruction amen let's don't have a
[51:10] problem with prophets
[51:12] God sent them all since the beginning of
[51:14] time why did he wait and so he didn't
[51:17] quit sending them in the end time no
[51:18] there's still more prophets to come
[51:22] the two witnesses these two more
[51:25] prophets got to go to Israel in the
[51:27] Bible
[51:28] so we shouldn't stubble at Malachi 4 and
[51:32] he didn't come to bring us another God
[51:35] he didn't come to bring us another Bible
[51:36] he came to bring us instruction of
[51:38] what's already been said amen same way
[51:41] now then God sends them this is what he
[51:44] sent the children of Israel sent him a
[51:46] prophet Moses for instruction sent him
[51:50] an angel to guide them a pillar of fire
[51:52] and a cloud and then gave them right
[51:56] from the get-go
[51:58] that's kind of a southern expression I
[52:00] guess is it that's not wouldn't be in
[52:03] Minnesota okay all right get from the
[52:05] get-go
[52:06] okay so that means from the start he'd
[52:10] give him a lamb he gave him a sacrifice
[52:13] he gave him a sin covering same way with
[52:16] you and I even though as brother Dale's
[52:18] telling us we we definitely walked in a
[52:20] world of sin
[52:22] everybody in the building
[52:26] this is including everyone
[52:29] we walked in the world of sin but God
[52:32] gave us a lamb
[52:34] for protection and then when we accept
[52:38] that blood that's when our sins get
[52:41] washed away and we become the sinless
[52:44] bride of Jesus Christ the Bible says
[52:47] without spot or wrinkle now you say oh
[52:48] now you can't be perfect I don't say I
[52:52] don't say hate I don't like when you
[52:54] talk to people about you know getting
[52:56] bet doing better and and you know doing
[52:59] what the Bible says and the first thing
[53:01] they do is they go you're not perfect no
[53:03] I'm not perfect I said well that's not
[53:06] why my Bible says I
[53:08] don't know why my Bible says I thought
[53:11] my Bible says B therefore perfect even
[53:13] as my father in heaven is perfect and
[53:15] that we are to be without spot or
[53:18] wrinkle
[53:19] white robes
[53:22] so I'm just gonna look what God said I'm
[53:25] not gonna worry about what man said I'm
[53:27] gonna look at what God said amen because
[53:30] you know what
[53:31] inside that house
[53:34] at the Passover night inside that house
[53:37] they might have been some sinners in
[53:39] there
[53:42] but they were still in a part of the
[53:44] family and what did the death angel now
[53:48] that knows like the death angel didn't
[53:49] come up and say I know what you did some
[53:53] will kill you nope that blood was there
[53:55] he couldn't go past it there was a
[53:58] barrier there and there's still a
[54:00] barrier there when Jesus Christ shed his
[54:02] blood at Calvary there is still a
[54:04] barrier there that Satan cannot touch
[54:07] you
[54:10] so I said thank God for these feasts
[54:13] that we can look at this and see that
[54:15] God's already done this took a group of
[54:17] people that kept sinning even down
[54:20] through
[54:22] the wilderness was even scald the
[54:24] wilderness of sin right it was called
[54:28] the wilderness of sin for a purpose
[54:29] because they were kept on sinning but
[54:31] you know what
[54:32] 5-10 times those Israelites end in the
[54:35] in the way and you know what God Act
[54:37] even brother Paul after even they would
[54:40] do some awful stuff the next verse he
[54:43] say when you get in the promised land
[54:45] this is what I want you to do he never
[54:48] even paid attention to that he knew they
[54:50] wasn't but to gonna make it of the
[54:53] original Bunch but he knew there was
[54:56] that young group that was going to come
[54:57] up that was going to listen to what God
[55:00] said that was gonna listen to what the
[55:03] Prophet said and do what the angel told
[55:05] them to do let the angel guide them
[55:09] but we must not walk through this world
[55:12] condemned
[55:13] we must not because if we do then we
[55:17] lose the battle the battle is won by us
[55:21] believing what God's already done for us
[55:24] as brother Dale was preaching chosen not
[55:27] chosen by him
[55:31] the Bible doesn't say chosen by him
[55:34] because Satan was chosen by God to be
[55:38] the anointed cherub
[55:40] Judas was chosen by him by God but they
[55:45] weren't chosen in him
[55:47] go see the lamb the lamb is what the
[55:51] sacrifice that's what that death angel
[55:52] looked at he and look at this situation
[55:54] inside the house he looked at that
[55:56] covering and they were covered he
[55:59] couldn't the angel could not penetrate
[56:01] that blood
[56:03] so he cannot get to you
[56:07] god only allows him in every once in a
[56:09] while just to kind of peek over and give
[56:11] us a little problem
[56:13] to see how we'll handle it
[56:16] but thank God that he sent us a prophet
[56:19] he sent us an angel the baptism of the
[56:21] Holy Ghost to goddess and a sin covering
[56:25] that even as Christians we sin
[56:30] right
[56:32] even the thoughts the very the very
[56:34] reason you're standing here listening to
[56:36] me today and you got to go eat after we
[56:38] get finished and you got to sleep
[56:39] tonight means that you have a sin body
[56:42] that you're living in
[56:44] amen but what about that guy inside
[56:46] that guy inside is not covered by the
[56:49] blood he is the life that was in that
[56:53] blood
[56:55] that was totally weak
[56:58] if if there would have been a touchdown
[57:01] scored right then y'all would have been
[57:03] screaming and hollering and shouting and
[57:05] I told you that you covered the by the
[57:07] blood and you just sit there and go
[57:09] heavy
[57:10] okay
[57:13] yeah but what good is that I had to make
[57:15] you do it
[57:18] Luke 22 verse 1 says now the feast of
[57:21] unleavened bread drew nigh which is
[57:24] called the Passover so we were talking
[57:26] about last Sunday don't be confused
[57:29] there is a day of Passover
[57:32] everybody got that that's on the 14th
[57:35] day of the month but that is also
[57:37] included in unleavened bread because you
[57:41] eat unleavened bread and the Bible even
[57:44] tells us now the feast of unleavened
[57:45] bread room now which is called the
[57:48] Passover so it's included in if you'll
[57:50] bring the chart back up if you don't
[57:52] mind brother Anderson he's doing double
[57:54] duty but I'm glad he's about six eight
[57:55] with about a ten-foot wingspan so he can
[57:58] get over here on this computer he can go
[57:59] over here on this computer in the same
[58:01] room so thank God for brother Anderson
[58:04] being a toll call fella so the
[58:08] fourteenth is to Passover and then the
[58:11] very next day you start unleavened bread
[58:14] but now remember I told you that some
[58:17] some people over there include it and
[58:21] make it an eight-day thief
[58:23] because unleavened bread starts at
[58:26] Passover but Passover separate because
[58:28] you don't kill the lamb on the 15th you
[58:30] kill the lamb on the 14th you don't kill
[58:32] another one on the 15th not for that
[58:35] Passover okay everybody got that all
[58:38] right so it's a seven-day feast
[58:41] of unleavened bread and we were talking
[58:43] about it or matzo we were talking about
[58:46] last time that might some
[58:49] what Shortino minute don't bring it for
[58:52] now but the Feast of Unleavened drew
[58:54] nigh which is called the Passover now
[58:56] what happened is Jesus was killed on
[58:59] Passover right and
[59:01] then the very next day which was
[59:05] Saturday what happened was now remember
[59:08] Friday he was killed on Friday everybody
[59:11] got that same man before 6 o'clock
[59:14] because remember and Jewish time even
[59:16] now the days are not midnight to
[59:19] midnight the days are 6 p.m. until 6
[59:23] p.m. the next day so in a couple of
[59:26] hours from now Israel would be you would
[59:29] be you would be at 6 o'clock p.m. today
[59:32] if it was the same time you would
[59:34] already be into Monday there buddy got
[59:36] that so that's why that Jesus was
[59:39] crucified on Friday but he had to be
[59:41] taken off the cross before 6 o'clock
[59:44] because it was not only a regular
[59:46] Sabbath the seventh day Sabbath Saturday
[59:50] it was a high Sabbath because she
[59:52] brought in unleavened bread
[59:54] started on that day and you do no
[59:57] servile work on the first day everybody
[59:59] got that
[1:00:00] and listen
[1:00:03] he stayed in the grave his body did that
[1:00:06] whole day on Saturday
[1:00:08] but now remember he was still working
[1:00:11] those remember where he went he went to
[1:00:13] hell to preach to the souls in prison
[1:00:16] while his body his dead body laid in the
[1:00:19] grave on that day
[1:00:22] because he had to didn't have to he
[1:00:24] couldn't do no servile work
[1:00:27] hey bad hello
[1:00:31] this is perfect this thing is so perfect
[1:00:36] well I mean why would we expect anything
[1:00:39] different Jesus had to come and fulfill
[1:00:41] the Old Testament brother branham told
[1:00:43] us that right so he fulfilled it to the
[1:00:46] day
[1:00:47] because remember we're going to talk
[1:00:49] about in a few minutes we're going to
[1:00:51] talk about first fruits which happens on
[1:00:53] the day after the Sabbath
[1:00:56] but remember
[1:00:58] remember this and we'll get to it
[1:01:00] keeping your back you're mine Passover
[1:01:02] can be on any day that falls on the 14th
[1:01:07] but firstfruits
[1:01:09] always happens the day after the Sabbath
[1:01:14] and it just so happens during that time
[1:01:18] a t30 that Jesus when he was crucified
[1:01:22] they all fell
[1:01:23] coincided within the three days but that
[1:01:26] happened not coincidence brother and
[1:01:28] sister and wasn't coincidence at fifty
[1:01:31] days later on the day of Pentecost that
[1:01:33] same man came back
[1:01:34] right here exactly the Bible says when
[1:01:37] the day of Pentecost was fully come
[1:01:41] hey men let's read a quote here real
[1:01:44] quick before we get into unleavened
[1:01:46] bread brother I'm standing witness
[1:01:49] 19:56 many was witness of his day and
[1:01:52] that is cross when he was dying the
[1:01:53] Pharisees they should have known what
[1:01:55] the word said the word gave witness when
[1:01:58] he was killed on he was a Passover lamb
[1:02:00] killed at the Passover time he gave
[1:02:03] witness the word spoke of him when He
[1:02:05] healed the sick when he raised the dead
[1:02:07] when the lame leap like a heart it was
[1:02:09] the word can you receive it so he was
[1:02:13] killed on Passover then the very next
[1:02:15] day was unleavened bread so let's go to
[1:02:17] unleavened bread which is the next day
[1:02:18] Exodus 12 verse 15
[1:02:21] God tells Moses seven days shall you eat
[1:02:24] unleavened bread now what is unleavened
[1:02:27] bread that is bread that has nothing in
[1:02:29] it to make it rise right even the first
[1:02:33] day you shall put away leaven out of
[1:02:35] your houses on the first day you got to
[1:02:38] get all the leaven out of your house for
[1:02:40] those who ever either flemming bread
[1:02:42] that's another word something added to
[1:02:44] it
[1:02:46] just look what's gonna happen this is
[1:02:49] how serious God was with the people
[1:02:51] we're talking about just a handful of
[1:02:53] yeast or a handful of flour and God said
[1:02:56] if I find that in your house
[1:03:00] if I find that leaven in your house your
[1:03:03] soul will be cut off from Israel that's
[1:03:06] why we must realize that when we receive
[1:03:09] the baptism of the Holy Ghost that in
[1:03:11] our soul it cannot sin
[1:03:15] and will not sin because this god it's
[1:03:19] the unleavened bread of the word
[1:03:25] seven days
[1:03:28] seven Church ages
[1:03:31] God sent us unleavened bread through
[1:03:34] paul i rainiest martin Columba luther
[1:03:38] wesley brother branham
[1:03:42] seven days shall you eat unleavened
[1:03:45] bread and now look as we were talking
[1:03:47] about last Sunday the first day you can
[1:03:50] put away leaven whosoever eateth
[1:03:51] leavened bread from the first day into
[1:03:53] the seventh day that soul shall be cut
[1:03:54] off from Israel if you don't have the
[1:03:56] baptism my Holy Ghost in those seven
[1:03:57] Church ages you're not gonna make it
[1:04:00] they didn't make it but they had to take
[1:04:03] the unleavened bread of the word
[1:04:05] and in the first day there should be a
[1:04:09] holy convocation and in the seventh day
[1:04:11] a holy convocation in the first churches
[1:04:14] in the last churches why did God talk
[1:04:16] about an alpha bride and Omega bride
[1:04:18] that in each one now that doesn't do
[1:04:21] away with everybody else but it makes
[1:04:23] that this first one got it started and
[1:04:26] the last one had to turn us back to
[1:04:29] the first
[1:04:31] back to the faith of the fathers that
[1:04:34] was back in the first church age
[1:04:37] so there was a holy convocation on the
[1:04:39] first day and on the seventh day first
[1:04:42] church age in the last church age seven
[1:04:44] churches there was holy convocation we
[1:04:46] had to be what the two bookends there
[1:04:49] shall be a holy convocation to you no
[1:04:51] matter of work shall be done in them
[1:04:53] excuse me save that which every man must
[1:04:56] eat
[1:04:57] eat
[1:04:59] eat
[1:05:01] eat
[1:05:04] carcass wheat the word
[1:05:12] but it's not of works lest
[1:05:14] any man should boast
[1:05:17] no matter of work shall be done in them
[1:05:20] say that whichever man must eat that
[1:05:23] only may be done of you and you shall
[1:05:25] observe the feast of unleavened bread
[1:05:27] for in this self same day I brought your
[1:05:29] armies out of the land of Egypt
[1:05:32] therefore show you observe this day in
[1:05:34] your generation by an ordinance for ever
[1:05:36] in the first month on the fourteenth day
[1:05:40] of the month that evening you shall eat
[1:05:41] unleavened bread see just went to the
[1:05:42] fourteenth day so you see what I'm
[1:05:44] talking about now until the one in 20th
[1:05:46] or 21st day of the month that evening
[1:05:48] seven days shall there be no leaven
[1:05:51] found in your houses realize that when
[1:05:54] when even in the first church age when
[1:05:56] they received the baptism my Holy Ghost
[1:05:58] leaven was taken out of their house you
[1:06:02] know why because they're standing in a
[1:06:03] dimension now in another dimension and
[1:06:05] they have no leaven
[1:06:07] the unleavened bread of the word that
[1:06:10] they received under Paul and I rhiness
[1:06:11] and Martin and Columba that's what put
[1:06:13] them in another dimension and that's
[1:06:15] what put them over there totally sinless
[1:06:18] white robes
[1:06:20] waiting to come back here to pick up
[1:06:22] their
[1:06:23] leaven
[1:06:27] because we gotta listen we gotta cover
[1:06:30] eleven here in just a few minutes well
[1:06:32] next Wednesday we're gonna cover eleven
[1:06:34] because when you come back to the Feast
[1:06:36] of Pentecost you have to take oh and let
[1:06:39] me give you this little key
[1:06:41] and my wake
[1:06:43] okay
[1:06:46] this harvest of this time that we're
[1:06:50] fixing to talk about the firstfruits
[1:06:52] it's not a wheat harvest
[1:06:55] it's not a fruit harvest it's a barley
[1:06:58] harvest all right so there's this
[1:07:01] harvest coming up we're gonna talk about
[1:07:02] is a barley harvest greeneires
[1:07:06] the next harvest we're going to talk
[1:07:08] about is the Feast of Pentecost
[1:07:10] that's a wheat harvest and then the next
[1:07:13] harvest we're gonna talk about
[1:07:16] it's a fruit harvest
[1:07:19] grapes and all those different things oh
[1:07:23] yeah so we got three different things
[1:07:25] that are that pertain to harvest so the
[1:07:28] first one we're fixing to talk about is
[1:07:30] a barley harvest it's the first thing to
[1:07:32] come to maturity is barley in March and
[1:07:34] April alright wheat does not do that
[1:07:36] wheat has to wait several of
[1:07:39] weeks or so after that we'll get into
[1:07:42] that
[1:07:42] seven day 7-eleven found in your house
[1:07:44] whose forever if that which is eleven
[1:07:46] even that soul shall be cut off from the
[1:07:47] congregation of Israel whether he be a
[1:07:49] stranger born in the land you shall eat
[1:07:51] nothing leaven and all your habitation
[1:07:55] shall you eat unleavened bread and
[1:07:58] unleavened bread is what we were talking
[1:08:00] about its that matzah and it's just a
[1:08:03] cracker that they roll across it's
[1:08:05] really flat what we take for communion
[1:08:08] and it has stripes and holes in it
[1:08:11] they don't even know what they're eating
[1:08:14] they're eating a type of Christ that
[1:08:17] took stripes for them and then we'll
[1:08:18] head holes put in his hands in his feet
[1:08:20] they don't even realize that they're
[1:08:22] sitting there eating matzah and they
[1:08:24] don't have a clue why well they do think
[1:08:26] that the holes punched in the matzah is
[1:08:28] to keep it from bubbling up you know you
[1:08:29] see if you see a saltine cracker
[1:08:31] everyone swallow a bubble in it that's
[1:08:33] what they said they roll this thing
[1:08:35] across it but if you look at it when I
[1:08:37] look at it I see Jesus Christ I don't
[1:08:41] see a cracker I see Jesus Christ because
[1:08:43] there is the unleavened bread there is
[1:08:46] the man that had holes punched in him
[1:08:48] that had stripes on his back for me I
[1:08:53] see that in the cracker I don't see just
[1:08:55] a cracker so look there's seven ages the
[1:08:59] unleavened bread
[1:09:01] but now also remember we were talking
[1:09:03] about last Sunday you got to remember
[1:09:06] that
[1:09:07] the Passover is a type of what the
[1:09:12] baptism of the Holy Ghost right
[1:09:14] when I see the blood okay everybody got
[1:09:17] that now we know that's gonna happen in
[1:09:19] Pentecost but you got had you got to
[1:09:21] start right here to accept that
[1:09:22] sacrifice
[1:09:24] so then you've got the very next the
[1:09:28] very next
[1:09:30] feast it's seven days
[1:09:38] born-again it faith
[1:09:40] faith is not an ADD faith is your
[1:09:44] Passover
[1:09:45] and then you got seven ads one two three
[1:09:49] four five six seven if I got that say
[1:09:52] man
[1:09:54] you don't get born again
[1:09:56] up here you get born again at faith a
[1:10:00] man so there's the Passover lamb being
[1:10:03] killed and then you've got seven days to
[1:10:05] eat what the unleavened bread of the
[1:10:08] word
[1:10:10] everybody got that pretty simple we go
[1:10:12] up the statue of a perfect man I told
[1:10:14] you that's one of the most ill taught
[1:10:15] subjects in the message there are seven
[1:10:18] ads that we are required
[1:10:22] we are required to have these ads as
[1:10:27] brother day I was talking about going on
[1:10:28] to what adoption going on to placing
[1:10:32] going on to the fullness of the word not
[1:10:36] just one piece of the cracker
[1:10:38] hey one piece of the crackers okay but
[1:10:40] if you're really hungry
[1:10:42] one piece of the cracker is not gonna do
[1:10:45] you any good you want the whole thing
[1:10:48] amen so now let's start with firstfruits
[1:10:51] pull it back up to firstfruits Leviticus
[1:10:53] 23 9
[1:10:59] don't we'll show you how perfect this is
[1:11:02] brother Bob and I were talking like this
[1:11:04] and I asked him I said did you know
[1:11:05] there was a difference in bar the
[1:11:06] harvest of wheat harvest he said yeah
[1:11:08] but
[1:11:10] we're gonna get into something in just a
[1:11:12] minute and I had to look it up on the
[1:11:14] internet it must be true
[1:11:18] and the Lord spake
[1:11:22] pause like wait a minute well what am I
[1:11:24] getting myself into and the Lord spake
[1:11:26] unto Moses saying speaking of the
[1:11:27] children of Israel saying to them when
[1:11:29] you'd be coming to the land which I give
[1:11:31] unto you all right everybody got that
[1:11:34] when I shall come and when you shall
[1:11:37] come into the land which I give you and
[1:11:39] shall reap the harvest thereof then you
[1:11:42] shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits
[1:11:44] of your harvest unto the priest if I got
[1:11:49] that and he shall wave
[1:11:55] he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord
[1:11:58] to be accepted for you
[1:12:02] on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[1:12:06] priest shall wave it
[1:12:11] the morrow
[1:12:14] after
[1:12:15] Saturday
[1:12:17] Jesus had to resurrect on Sunday to
[1:12:20] fulfill the firstfruits
[1:12:25] but you're gonna see something just a
[1:12:27] minute I found on the Internet
[1:12:30] but you're gonna see the timing of this
[1:12:33] thing the timing is so perfect to get
[1:12:36] all three of them in the same slot
[1:12:39] Passover unleavened bread to hit because
[1:12:42] you know what Passover can be on any day
[1:12:44] everybody understand what I'm saying how
[1:12:47] this is not a coincidence because it's
[1:12:49] on the 14th day of the first month that
[1:12:54] may follow Monday Tuesday Wednesday
[1:12:56] Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday
[1:13:00] but it didn't on that when Jesus was
[1:13:03] crucified it fell on Friday
[1:13:05] then the feast of unleavened bread the
[1:13:07] first day started Saturday and then that
[1:13:10] was the first
[1:13:12] Monday first day of the week after the
[1:13:17] Sabbath
[1:13:18] that's why they all three fell in the
[1:13:21] same boom boom boom and that hardly ever
[1:13:23] happens hardly ever happens but it
[1:13:26] happened when Jesus was crucified
[1:13:28] because you've got to be accepted on the
[1:13:31] morrow after the Sabbath so what are we
[1:13:33] saying by the way well if the Passover
[1:13:35] was on Tuesday
[1:13:39] we've got it
[1:13:41] if it was on TV now unleavened bread
[1:13:44] would start the next day not a big deal
[1:13:48] but your firstfruits couldn't have been
[1:13:51] the next day cuz it's tomorrow after the
[1:13:53] Sabbath you gotta wait till the day
[1:13:55] after Saturday there's a gap in there
[1:13:58] God don't have gaps
[1:14:00] he was perfect when he came and died
[1:14:04] stayed in the grave and came up on the
[1:14:07] day of firstfruits the day after the
[1:14:10] Sabbath what a mighty God we serve
[1:14:13] now watch mm-hmm and you shall offer
[1:14:15] that day now watch to be accepted for
[1:14:19] you on the morrow after the Sabbath the
[1:14:22] priests shall waive it so the priest on
[1:14:25] Monday morning
[1:14:29] Monday morning the day after the Sabbath
[1:14:32] he gets that group of firstfruits and he
[1:14:35] waves it but what this is what's
[1:14:38] important and you shall offer that day
[1:14:42] when you wave the sheaf and he lamb
[1:14:45] without blemish of the first year for a
[1:14:46] burnt offering and the meat offering
[1:14:49] shall be two tents deal of fine flour
[1:14:51] now this is offering this is not what
[1:14:53] you eat because you can't eat until the
[1:14:55] firstfruits has been accepted
[1:14:57] and you shall eat neither bread nor
[1:15:00] parts corn there's a green dark green
[1:15:03] ears until the self-same day that you
[1:15:06] have brought an offering unto your God
[1:15:09] it shall be a statute forever throughout
[1:15:11] your generations and all your dwellings
[1:15:13] in other words you couldn't just go in
[1:15:16] there and bring the first fruits to the
[1:15:19] priest and then go eat
[1:15:22] you had to wait till he waived it you
[1:15:26] gotta wait till the preacher preaches it
[1:15:28] sorry
[1:15:31] you gotta wait til the preacher preaches
[1:15:33] it
[1:15:35] then you can eat
[1:15:38] then you can eat what you got in your
[1:15:41] field but you gotta wait for God to do
[1:15:44] the work first and
[1:15:46] let that priest
[1:15:49] waive it before the Lord and be accepted
[1:15:53] when it is
[1:15:54] then you can eat proverbs proverbs 3
[1:15:58] verse 9 says honor the Lord with thy
[1:16:00] substance because we're gonna get into
[1:16:01] something here it's listen tears don't
[1:16:04] let nobody to door
[1:16:05] hold it or right there we're gonna talk
[1:16:08] about tithing
[1:16:10] well let's see the letter marriage and
[1:16:12] divorce one of the two so we'll pick
[1:16:14] tithing

[1:16:23] just now but it gives you time to just
[1:16:26] continue sleeping or we can talk about
[1:16:28] it proverbs 3 verse 9 says honor the
[1:16:31] Lord with thy substance because look let
[1:16:33] me tell you something God Almighty
[1:16:35] himself offered his own body
[1:16:39] say it again brother Amen God himself
[1:16:44] offered his own body
[1:16:46] so that you and I can have eternal life
[1:16:49] he offered himself as the Passover lamb
[1:16:53] literally the blood was over the
[1:16:55] doorpost and
[1:16:59] he took that leaven that he was living
[1:17:02] in because it was corrupting right he
[1:17:04] wasn't living in a perfect body and he
[1:17:07] put it in the ground
[1:17:10] he put it in the ground but he raised on
[1:17:13] that one scripture that that bread was
[1:17:15] not going to corrupt and he rose on the
[1:17:19] first fruits and he gave everything that
[1:17:22] was the day remember brother Brown said
[1:17:24] he proved who he was when he came out of
[1:17:26] the grave hey man he proved who he was
[1:17:29] when he said destroy this body and I'll
[1:17:33] raise it up in three days destroy this
[1:17:36] temple now raised up in three days if he
[1:17:37] hadn't come up in that time he'd have
[1:17:39] been a liar hey man but he did
[1:17:43] so as he did that we can enjoy
[1:17:46] everything after that but somebody had
[1:17:49] to get this thing started
[1:17:51] and thank God it was God Almighty that
[1:17:54] started it if God Almighty starts it it
[1:17:57] cannot go wrong

[1:18:30] for that no no he just wants enough
[1:18:35] to where he can wave it before the

[1:21:48] unto the house of the Lord also the
[1:21:51] firstborn of our sons we must take them
[1:21:54] to the
[1:21:56] remember what Samuel remember what Hanna

[1:22:29] to pay all this but these people got
[1:22:31] blessed okay and we've always said if
[1:22:36] you don't pay your tithe
[1:22:38] well we can tell who don't pay tithe
[1:22:40] than he does I'm just telling you that
[1:22:41] you can see because God promised he even
[1:22:45] promised the center if he pay his ties
[1:22:47] he'd give him a blessing
[1:22:50] but you're willing to pay what I'm
[1:22:53] fixing to tell you though according to
[1:22:55] the Bible and that we should bring the
[1:22:59] first fruits of our dough
[1:23:01] well you get ready to make your cookies

[1:23:11] offerings and the fruit of all manner of
[1:23:14] trees and of wine where you get wine
[1:23:17] from grapes
[1:23:19] wine and of oil unto the priest

[1:23:28] and let me let me just get this real
[1:23:30] quick before we start on tithes and
[1:23:31] thereby shuts off and go sleep
[1:23:34] it's not meaning it's meaning that
[1:23:38] you're giving this unto the Lord listen
[1:23:40] if you tithe the brother Dale you're
[1:23:42] wrong
[1:23:47] but him being the head priest he gets
[1:23:50] the fruit of that but you're giving it
[1:23:52] to the Lord if you're not giving it to
[1:23:54] the Lord then you're just you're just
[1:23:55] not say I don't know if you give it if
[1:23:58] you give a 10% of your tithe and you say
[1:24:00] well I got to do this

[1:24:05] God knows your heart because I'm gonna
[1:24:07] fixing to tell you in a minute that's

[1:24:43] dollar check those in the mail first
[1:24:45] fruit first thing not wait to the very
[1:24:47] end no no come on people you're robbing
[1:24:51] yourself and we can tell I mean you say
[1:24:54] we me and brother Dale we can tell we I
[1:24:57] may be a joker but you know what God
[1:24:58] doesn't like Jokers every once in a
[1:25:00] while to really realize what thieves are
[1:25:05] sorry you can get quite if you want to
[1:25:07] don't care he put us in this place for
[1:25:10] something
[1:25:11] I'm talking about all of us not just me
[1:25:13] and brother Dalyan but you trust us I
[1:25:16] trust him to do anything with money I
[1:25:18] give him I but I'm not giving it to him
[1:25:20] and give it a guard you
[1:25:23] know what the Bible tells you you'll be
[1:25:26] blessed if you pay tithe now you say
[1:25:28] well brother Dale took it and burn it
[1:25:29] you've took the burden off for you
[1:25:32] your run John your blessings operate
[1:25:35] you've done what the Bible says you've
[1:25:36] done you've took your tithing and you
[1:25:38] put it right here and God's gonna bless
[1:25:41] you now what brother Dale does with it
[1:25:43] he's got to either get a blessing or
[1:25:45] curse from it right amen so it's just
[1:25:48] real simple
[1:25:50] well if I play my tire bro Dale's gonna
[1:25:52] get him and you just
[1:25:55] forget it you paying your tithe to God
[1:25:59] and the ties of our ground
[1:26:03] unto the Levites that the same Levi's
[1:26:06] might have the tithe and all the cities
[1:26:09] of our tillage or where we raise our
[1:26:12] crops all right here we go you ready
[1:26:16] hang on
[1:26:18] thank you brother dirty I will just
[1:26:21] because you said go ahead I'm gonna go
[1:26:22] ahead
[1:26:24] here we go all right this is first
[1:26:27] fruits if you don't desire to pay your
[1:26:31] first fruits to God
[1:26:34] where's the Christianity part where's
[1:26:36] the part that were not believing
[1:26:40] I'm just believing that God said he
[1:26:42] would pour out the windows of heaven and
[1:26:44] give us a blessing if we do it so now
[1:26:48] watch this let's go I got this from the
[1:26:49] Greek lexicon in Strong's number 11 81
[1:26:52] so this is not my deal
[1:26:54] this is telling you what to do now watch
[1:26:57] a tenth part of anything a tithe in the
[1:27:00] Old Testament there were three times
[1:27:03] most you didn't know that
[1:27:07] three times one was used to support two
[1:27:11] Levi's
[1:27:12] the minister
[1:27:14] this freed the Levites to provide civil
[1:27:17] and religious leadership
[1:27:19] and and you know why just to make a
[1:27:23] statement here we have some small
[1:27:26] churches around the message but but a
[1:27:28] pastor ought to not be tied up with
[1:27:30] three jobs and then be a pastor
[1:27:32] this is just me I'm just telling you but
[1:27:35] look and see that though if brother
[1:27:37] Colley needed something I believe
[1:27:38] brother Dale goes right there and he's
[1:27:40] been doing that for years God has
[1:27:41] allowed him to do that but there's many
[1:27:43] preachers that are many pastors that has
[1:27:45] to work two or three jobs if people will
[1:27:47] pay their time right you shouldn't have
[1:27:50] to do that he should be free this freed
[1:27:53] the Levites to provide civil and
[1:27:56] religious leadership
[1:27:59] essentially this ties supported the
[1:28:02] government of ancient Israel
[1:28:04] now a tithe of
[1:28:08] this tithe
[1:28:13] brother Dale pays tithes y'all didn't
[1:28:15] know that didn't
[1:28:16] you've been here long enough you ought
[1:28:18] to know who's you pay tithe to he pays
[1:28:20] tied to the preachers that come and
[1:28:21] preach he pays tithe by 10 percent puts
[1:28:24] it back into the kitty why a tithe of
[1:28:27] this tithe went to support the high
[1:28:29] priest
[1:28:31] let me get out of the way so you see
[1:28:34] the next tithe was the tithes of the
[1:28:38] produce of the land and the firstfruits
[1:28:40] if you want to read Deuteronomy 12 verse
[1:28:42] 5 through 18 this tithe was the worship
[1:28:45] offering the Israelites gave to God and
[1:28:48] was used to support the religious
[1:28:50] festivals of the day
[1:28:54] and I would say to a degree you'll do
[1:28:58] the same thing because when we have a
[1:28:59] dinner
[1:29:00] y'all bring y'all bring food right but
[1:29:05] now look lastly every third year now
[1:29:07] this is the one
[1:29:08] that people don't like but you're
[1:29:12] supposed to tithe again every three
[1:29:14] years there's no there's another time
[1:29:16] lastly every third year an additional
[1:29:18] tide was gathered to support the state
[1:29:21] welfare system but watch this went to
[1:29:25] the fatherless the widows
[1:29:27] now we do have a fund here that does
[1:29:29] that and the strangers in the land
[1:29:32] tithing in the Old Testament represented
[1:29:34] twenty three and a half percent of the
[1:29:36] average annual income and corresponds
[1:29:39] with our modern tax code
[1:29:43] our modern tax system both John's
[1:29:46] account that's pretty close twenty three
[1:29:50] percent that's that I mean that's way
[1:29:52] back 3,000 years ago twenty three nine
[1:29:54] third percent of the average annual
[1:29:56] income and corresponds to our modern tax
[1:29:59] system both are used to support the
[1:30:01] government for the good of the people
[1:30:04] this government
[1:30:06] the good of our people
[1:30:09] so how about that
[1:30:11] so the next time the times were the type
[1:30:13] of produce is when I was looking at or
[1:30:15] the first fruits
[1:30:16] because remember they didn't have
[1:30:18] Walmart they didn't have Dollar General
[1:30:22] they might had a Dollar General cuz
[1:30:24] they're everywhere now
[1:30:25] but they didn't have a place to where
[1:30:27] they could go buy produce
[1:30:29] do you know they literally depended on
[1:30:32] the people
[1:30:33] raising a garden and bringing say they
[1:30:38] had a hundred pounds of tomato I'm loud
[1:30:40] and I'm sorry you okay okay some people
[1:30:44] lean back when I especially Russian yeah
[1:30:46] yeah if you got a hundred pounds of
[1:30:49] tomatoes you took ten pounds and you
[1:30:52] took it to the to the priest if you had
[1:30:55] ten pounds of corn I'm a 100 pounds of
[1:30:57] corn you took ten pounds of corn and
[1:30:58] that fed them all year
[1:31:02] bring
[1:31:04] into the white storehouse
[1:31:08] your tithing into the storehouse and I
[1:31:12] just soon have your time
[1:31:18] you ever took ten percent of a
[1:31:21] seven-day week how many hours that is
[1:31:24] that you're supposed to give the duck
[1:31:27] hmm but I just want to throw that in
[1:31:30] there so
[1:31:32] let's go to Romans eight I know you're
[1:31:34] real quiet cuz everybody's like oh my
[1:31:36] lord what am I doing here
[1:31:38] but to bring the first fruits of
[1:31:40] the ground so let's go right here romans
[1:31:43] 8:4 we know that the whole creation
[1:31:45] groaneth and travaileth now this is what
[1:31:47] I was talking about here like going up
[1:31:49] the Statue of a perfect man because
[1:31:50] remember
[1:31:51] we're waiting for the adoption to wit
[1:31:53] the redemption of the body now you and I
[1:31:55] are not going to be stuck right here
[1:31:59] some might
[1:32:02] be here now but the firstfruits have
[1:32:05] gotten to bring us all the way up a
[1:32:07] man the unleavened bread we got to eat
[1:32:10] the pure this is not your godliness or
[1:32:12] your patience that brother Dale said
[1:32:14] there's two different meanings to all
[1:32:15] these
[1:32:17] there's a godly meaning to lose a godly
[1:32:21] knowledge of godly temperance and godly
[1:32:22] patience a
[1:32:25] godly brotherly kindness sure will you
[1:32:27] be nice to people but can you be nice to
[1:32:28] somebody hey sure
[1:32:30] there's the deal
[1:32:33] yeah that again and men on that I heard
[1:32:37] you the first time but we know that the
[1:32:39] whole creation groaneth and travaileth
[1:32:40] in pain waiting until now for what us
[1:32:43] they have the firstfruits and we'll read
[1:32:46] it in a minute not only they but
[1:32:47] ourselves also which have the first Paul
[1:32:51] is telling us we've got the firstfruits
[1:32:53] of the Spirit
[1:32:55] in other words we've got the mature part
[1:32:58] first
[1:33:01] this is our age our age is the Eagle
[1:33:04] ages up here
[1:33:07] we have the firstfruits of the Spirit
[1:33:09] even when we ourselves groan within
[1:33:11] ourselves waiting for the adoption to
[1:33:13] wit the redemption of our body let's go
[1:33:19] to the next scripture let's go to first
[1:33:21] Corinthians
[1:33:24] 15 verse 20 I love this scripture right
[1:33:28] here and if you just read over it's so
[1:33:29] confusing
[1:33:30] says if in this life only we have hope
[1:33:34] and crops now our only hope is in Christ
[1:33:36] but if it's only in this life
[1:33:40] then we just gonna die and go by the
[1:33:42] grave and they ain't going nowhere
[1:33:44] that's what he's saying if in this life
[1:33:46] only we have hope in Christ hope we
[1:33:49] don't have a hope we have a shirt
[1:33:52] we have a surety we are of all men most
[1:33:56] miserable but now is Christ risen from
[1:34:00] the dead hallelu and become the
[1:34:02] firstfruits of them that slept now
[1:34:05] everybody can come out of the grave when
[1:34:07] he took his feet and he stepped out on
[1:34:09] the outside he said all power in heaven
[1:34:11] earth been given unto me he meant what
[1:34:13] he said
[1:34:15] for since by man came death
[1:34:18] for it since by man came death
[1:34:21] whoa now
[1:34:23] what's that saying now my man came also
[1:34:26] the resurrection of the Dead Jesus
[1:34:29] Christ raised a man
[1:34:33] because he was the first fruit
[1:34:35] he couldn't die something else and
[1:34:38] raised something else no he died in that
[1:34:40] body he raised in the same body
[1:34:44] for his in Adam all die even so in
[1:34:47] Christ shall all be made alive but every
[1:34:51] man in his own order
[1:34:53] we're not in the order of to church ages
[1:34:56] ago or three churches ago or four church
[1:34:58] days ago we're in this church age right
[1:35:00] here every man in his own order Christ
[1:35:03] the firstfruits
[1:35:05] afterwards us
[1:35:08] because you know what
[1:35:10] firstfruits
[1:35:12] literally means there's more to come
[1:35:16] because you got a first fruit that means
[1:35:20] that that's the only one that's the
[1:35:21] first one that come to maturity we got
[1:35:23] some corn in it we got a harvest
[1:35:24] tomorrow there's something that's not
[1:35:26] ready
[1:35:27] but there's some that is there's some
[1:35:30] that got the site a perfect sunlight
[1:35:32] that got the perfect fertilizer
[1:35:37] heard the perfect Word of God and they
[1:35:40] come to maturity first
[1:35:42] listen you can't put a seed in a soil
[1:35:46] that has no nutrition and expected to
[1:35:48] grow
[1:35:50] look at your seed that God planted by
[1:35:53] the son of man the difference the
[1:35:54] different places they fell the last one
[1:35:56] it says good ground I
[1:35:59] believe God put it in some good ground
[1:36:01] and when he put it in some good ground
[1:36:03] the first one to mature but that doesn't
[1:36:05] mean you take that and wave it and then
[1:36:08] the priest says well I'm gonna eat this
[1:36:09] and y'all gonna die no he's waving it
[1:36:13] saying hey I accept what you planted and
[1:36:17] it has come up and it's going to keep
[1:36:20] coming up and it's going to come to
[1:36:22] maturity because this is only the first
[1:36:25] fruits listen if we don't have a
[1:36:30] resurrection then Jesus Christ died in
[1:36:32] vain
[1:36:34] him being though the first one up we're
[1:36:38] going to see a resurrection brother Paul
[1:36:40] saw the people downstairs and he was
[1:36:41] taking pictures of some of the ones that
[1:36:43] have gone on that we've got pictures of
[1:36:45] downstairs
[1:36:46] we're looking for them
[1:36:49] they're not coming back old either
[1:36:51] young man young woman
[1:36:54] Robert items not gonna be with the way I
[1:36:57] saw him last to hump over like this with
[1:37:01] his fingers turned sideways because of
[1:37:02] arthritis no that's gone that's done
[1:37:06] that's done
[1:37:08] never will you see that again but in
[1:37:12] every man in his own order Christ the
[1:37:14] firstfruits had to have one do it first
[1:37:17] so we had to have a profit in the end
[1:37:19] time to go to maturity
[1:37:20] go to maturity first so that he can
[1:37:23] proclaim that there's more to come
[1:37:27] you can decide whether it's you or not
[1:37:30] but I'm gonna decide that it's me Christ
[1:37:34] the firstfruits afterwards they that are
[1:37:37] Christ's at his coming
[1:37:40] everybody okay with that saying man
[1:37:43] [Music]
[1:37:45] now let's go right here now they don't I
[1:37:47] don't think they have this so I'm just
[1:37:49] gonna give you what's what the
[1:37:51] commentator said that really blessed my
[1:37:53] heart because look it says traditionally
[1:37:55] in Temple times the first-fruit portion
[1:37:58] now remember this is now going just I'm
[1:38:01] gonna be a little bit longer today I'll
[1:38:02] usually keep it about an hour so I'm
[1:38:03] gonna go over a little bit extra mm just
[1:38:06] for Leah and
[1:38:09] Paul
[1:38:11] traditionally in Temple times the
[1:38:13] first-fruit portion of barley was cut at
[1:38:16] the going down of the Sun
[1:38:21] on the weekly Sabbath and
[1:38:24] presented at 9:00 a.m. the next morning
[1:38:29] in the temple
[1:38:34] what Casta
[1:38:37] early in the morning the Bible says the
[1:38:41] first day of the week
[1:38:42] there was a first fruit waved
[1:38:45] and when that grave came open
[1:38:49] they didn't have to take two or three
[1:38:51] hundred Centurions to roll that rock all
[1:38:53] all Jesus did was went and that thing
[1:38:56] just flipped out of the way
[1:38:58] because there was nothing gonna hold him
[1:39:00] down
[1:39:01] the term firstfruits means that there
[1:39:04] are more to come when the priest waved
[1:39:06] the sheaves of the barley harvest before
[1:39:08] the Lord as the firstfruits he was
[1:39:10] thanking God for the abundant harvest
[1:39:13] that they were about to have
[1:39:16] the firstfruits were the first the very
[1:39:19] first of the harvest as it was only the
[1:39:22] beginning of the abundance of the
[1:39:25] harvest that was about to come
[1:39:28] when Jesus resurrected that started
[1:39:33] that started the rapture we know that
[1:39:37] but that started the ability for me and
[1:39:41] you to grow to maturity
[1:39:43] amen
[1:39:45] Messiah the firstfruits of the
[1:39:47] resurrection meant that he was the first
[1:39:49] of the Resurrection that would never see
[1:39:51] death again the abundance of the harvest
[1:39:55] of the resurrection means that there
[1:39:56] will be an abundance of resurrection in
[1:40:00] the future
[1:40:02] and we are recipients of that
[1:40:06] a
[1:40:06] couple more things right here the timing
[1:40:09] of the feast it was observed once they
[1:40:11] entered the land so you you can't you
[1:40:14] can't be the first one up if you haven't
[1:40:18] went through Passover if you have a went
[1:40:21] through unleavened bread and went
[1:40:23] through that wilderness journey and come
[1:40:25] to what the Promised Land see when you
[1:40:27] get born again that's your Promised Land
[1:40:28] right
[1:40:29] all right so look the day of the feast
[1:40:32] on the day of the feast there would be
[1:40:33] no servile work it was also observed on
[1:40:36] the first day of the week after Passover
[1:40:40] which could be on any day of the week
[1:40:42] the Passover could be only needed a of
[1:40:44] the week but firstfruits had to be
[1:40:47] Sunday the day after the Sabbath all
[1:40:51] right that's why
[1:40:54] we celebrate the feast of firstfruits
[1:40:58] every Sunday every Sunday there has been
[1:41:02] a sheaf waved over the people as the
[1:41:04] prophet of God told us there's been a
[1:41:06] sheaf wave that has given us an
[1:41:08] opportunity
[1:41:09] to have a resurrection even those that
[1:41:12] have gone on even those that are down
[1:41:14] there in the in the room there with
[1:41:17] their with their pictures
[1:41:19] they've went on
[1:41:22] but guess what they're gonna be they're
[1:41:25] gonna be first fruit coming back this
[1:41:26] way hey man
[1:41:29] Passover could be any day of the week
[1:41:31] but as the Lord gave the feast of
[1:41:32] firstfruits it was only to be the one
[1:41:35] day which was the first day of the week
[1:41:37] after the Passover now a couple more
[1:41:42] things first fruit pertained to barley
[1:41:45] harvest now here's the difference in
[1:41:47] barley and wheat there buddy awake
[1:41:48] because this is very important
[1:41:50] and
[1:41:52] listen to this in
[1:41:54] revelation 6 verse 6 I just got this
[1:41:57] sitting back here and I heard a voice in
[1:41:59] the midst of the four beasts say a
[1:42:00] measure of wheat for a penny and
[1:42:05] you get three measures of barley for a
[1:42:08] penny and see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:42:11] one
[1:42:13] barley was the poor people's bread
[1:42:17] mr. Cletus Sagan ahead she's before
[1:42:20] barley is cheaper the common people I
[1:42:24] wrote myself a note the common people
[1:42:27] heard him gladly
[1:42:29] and barley you say oh now what he's got
[1:42:33] to be worth more than that the Bible
[1:42:35] says Jesus who made himself a little
[1:42:37] lower than the Angels for the suffering
[1:42:40] of death crowned with glory you know why
[1:42:41] he resurrected he didn't resurrect so
[1:42:43] that he could be number one guy
[1:42:46] now he was barley
[1:42:48] he came up during the barley harvest but
[1:42:52] he came up on the barley harvest
[1:42:54] so that there would be a wheat harvest
[1:42:57] and the weed is more important than the
[1:43:00] barley
[1:43:01] he said oh my momma no God has bestowed
[1:43:05] all of his gift on herself
[1:43:09] no he's bestowed all the gifts on you
[1:43:13] he became barley so that we can become
[1:43:17] wheat
[1:43:19] and wheat is harvested at the feast of
[1:43:23] Pentecost
[1:43:28] Aaron
[1:43:29] what will that do for you if that don't
[1:43:32] stir your soul what your spoon fell out
[1:43:34] of the boat or your boat think about
[1:43:37] that for a little while
[1:43:39] so firstfruits pertains to barley
[1:43:41] harvest but it is the first crop to come
[1:43:44] to maturity in April March and April
[1:43:47] then the feast of Pentecost which is
[1:43:50] called another first fruit it pertains
[1:43:52] to wheat it matures second so Christ had
[1:43:55] to come to maturity first during the
[1:43:58] barley harvest and then remember what
[1:44:01] happened in the Book of Ruth what was
[1:44:02] she gleaning
[1:44:08] and actually if you go back in the Bible
[1:44:10] we'll stop right there musicians come in
[1:44:12] the Bible look at your lows that Jesus
[1:44:16] turned into
[1:44:18] multiplying lows it was barley loaves a
[1:44:21] man so there's a difference there in the
[1:44:24] barn let that down one more time I got a
[1:44:25] quote right here let's read this right
[1:44:26] here when your eyes are open nineteen
[1:44:29] sixty four but go ahead and come on I'll
[1:44:30] do it I'll do it I can handle it now
[1:44:32] let's Gloria scene when we have before
[1:44:34] us tonight it's Jesus up from the dead
[1:44:37] in the springtime walking around up from
[1:44:41] the spring the resurrection the first
[1:44:43] flower to rise from the dead our Lord
[1:44:47] Jesus he was the firstfruits of them
[1:44:49] that slept the Easter flower that came
[1:44:51] up the first one that struck it stuck
[1:44:53] his head up after the cold midnight of
[1:44:55] darkness and saith he had paid the sin
[1:44:58] pricing God raised him up on the third
[1:45:00] day we believe that with all our hearts
[1:45:02] that God raised him up on the third day
[1:45:04] according to his promise and we believe
[1:45:07] it according to the scripture that he
[1:45:08] raised him up the third day he was the
[1:45:10] first one that raised from the dead the
[1:45:12] firstfruits of the ones that slept
[1:45:17] well I got excited when I saw that
[1:45:19] barley I thought well when you first
[1:45:20] look at that you it was considered the
[1:45:23] poor people's bread
[1:45:25] but when Jesus came he made his staff
[1:45:27] lower than the Angels he made himself
[1:45:29] lower than us because you know what he
[1:45:31] done he took on your sin he took on your
[1:45:34] sin and my sin we didn't brother brother
[1:45:37] John we didn't have to go on a cross and
[1:45:38] have stripes put on her back right we
[1:45:42] didn't have nails put in our hand but
[1:45:45] the barley did the barley had to be the
[1:45:48] first one so that he could come to
[1:45:50] maturity and then he could look down the
[1:45:53] line and say I got some wheat that's
[1:45:54] coming
[1:45:55] because he told him he said tarry in
[1:45:58] Jerusalem
[1:46:00] you wheat you're not ready yet but I'm
[1:46:03] gonna go off the thing
[1:46:05] but in a few days I'll be back and the
[1:46:09] Bible said and we'll get to it wins
[1:46:10] tonight when the day of Pentecost
[1:46:13] was fully come
[1:46:15] that was a sound from heaven
[1:46:18] like a rushing mighty wind and you could
[1:46:21] see that wheat
[1:46:23] you can see that wheat and all of a
[1:46:26] sudden they was a charge in that wheat
[1:46:28] and that wheat stood straight up
[1:46:30] and said man brother
[1:46:35] this is that it was spoken of enjoy
[1:46:42] we've had enough of those bugs eaten i
[1:46:44] got bugs eating my plants at home and
[1:46:47] i'm gonna take care of them suckers
[1:46:50] [Music]
[1:46:52] well they're eating my food don't let
[1:46:55] bugs eat your food i'm talking
[1:46:57] spiritually let's stand to our feet
[1:47:00] get rid of those things
[1:47:05] but the first fruit
[1:47:08] he came and made himself us
[1:47:13] so that he by his graves may make us him
[1:47:17] he took stripes on his back brother John
[1:47:20] that you'll never have to take
[1:47:22] he had holes put in his hand brother
[1:47:25] Paul that you never have to have
[1:47:27] he'll walk to an eternity with a body
[1:47:30] with his hands that are scarred all the
[1:47:31] pieces for me and you but you and I are
[1:47:33] gonna walk in a perfect body that has
[1:47:36] not a spot or wrinkle and as old people
[1:47:39] say hallelujah
[1:47:41] no wrinkles
[1:47:44] I'm just telling you what I'm just
[1:47:46] telling you what the barley told me
[1:47:48] I'm just telling you what that common
[1:47:51] barley that the people eat though bill
[1:47:53] poor people heard him gladly because he
[1:47:56] was barley he wasn't anything that's
[1:47:58] great something but he was the greatest
[1:48:01] thing that ever came on the face of this
[1:48:02] earth and man didn't realize it but
[1:48:05] buddy on the day of Pentecost when the
[1:48:07] day of Pentecost came they knew who that
[1:48:10] was they knew who that was because Peter
[1:48:13] says this is that that was spoken of in
[1:48:17] Joel and all he preached a sermon
[1:48:20] brother and he said
[1:48:23] just for about 30 minutes what a
[1:48:26] powerful sermon he walked outside and he
[1:48:28] said
[1:48:30] this is that
[1:48:32] we've crucified the Lord of glory
[1:48:36] and that three thousand congregation
[1:48:39] downstairs that little wheel was moving
[1:48:42] back and forth
[1:48:43] they said what must we do to have what
[1:48:46] you got
[1:48:48] what must I do brother Dale to have what
[1:48:53] you got
[1:48:54] to have what you got
[1:48:57] Peter said repent
[1:49:00] repent and be baptized in the name of
[1:49:04] Jesus Christ that puts you in the field
[1:49:09] let's sing a song god bless you from the
[1:49:14] dead and he is
[1:49:20] all people
