[0:56] because
[0:58] amen you want to see him turn around and
[1:01] shake his hands
[1:02] may the Lord bless you you'll be in the
[1:06] house of the Lord good to see each and
[1:08] every one of you here brother Collins
[1:09] his wife and two daughters with us
[1:12] brother thank God to have each
[1:16] one of them here right
[1:19] all here happy and Minnie's here happy
[1:24] happy
[1:30] he's happy
[1:32] we're all happy happy to be in the house
[1:35] of the Lord all right amen and um
[1:38] good to be back good to be back with you
[1:41] let's just get these announcements out
[1:43] of the way while everybody's coming in
[1:44] and out and kind of getting settled in
[1:46] the ass brother riches we have just a
[1:48] few extra minutes because it takes a
[1:49] little while for everybody to get
[1:50] settled down and everybody to get all
[1:52] the announcements out of the way and for
[1:54] the kids to go to the bathroom and all
[1:56] that stuff but I want to
[1:58] if you reiterate what daddy said because
[2:00] I've had to mention to some of you
[2:04] that at about 9 45 that place downstairs
[2:07] needs to be quiet and empty if you want
[2:09] to come in and out there's a door out
[2:11] here that you can come in and out not
[2:12] disturb the Sunday school class but not
[2:15] in the place where the coffee is and
[2:17] like I said you shouldn't be making
[2:18] coffee at 9 45 right the coffee is more
[2:20] important than the service than uh than
[2:23] their altar is always open
[2:25] for you to repent right because you need
[2:28] to but uh I think that I was trying to
[2:32] look the quote up where brother Brown
[2:33] said we're missing it in the walk the
[2:35] things that we're doing that the little
[2:37] things the little misbehaviors that we
[2:39] do right we'll handle our service and
[2:41] we'll hinder we'll hinder us from
[2:43] getting anything and I you know I'm not
[2:45] any different than you guys are I I
[2:47] can't just walk into a service and sit
[2:49] down five minutes before and and have my
[2:52] mind on on spiritual things and and
[2:54] having communion with uh with the Lord I
[2:57] know sometimes as deacons and as as
[3:00] preachers and all we have to do things
[3:01] we have to you know uphold laws and
[3:04] stuff but uh you should be in here 15
[3:06] minutes tell right you should be in here
[3:08] you know you know if you go to a
[3:10] football game here we go again you go to
[3:11] a Georgia game you're going to get there
[3:12] at halftime
[3:14] no you gonna make sure you're there four
[3:17] hours in advance
[3:19] because you want party
[3:22] think about it
[3:24] that's right
[3:25] doctor's visit you don't get that one
[3:28] you make sure you're there because you
[3:30] don't want to miss getting see what that
[3:31] doctor has to say to him
[3:34] and uh
[3:35] this is more important than any of that
[3:38] there's nothing as important as the word
[3:41] of God not one thing so by the way of
[3:43] announcement just remember that we will
[3:44] be enforcing that you need to be out of
[3:47] the fellowship part of the hall at least
[3:48] 9 45. all right
[3:51] if you do have to go out there is a door
[3:52] that you won't disturb anybody to go in
[3:54] and out but
[3:56] um we need to be focused on what we're
[3:57] doing children are
[3:59] are vitally important uh we need to get
[4:02] them started right and to get them
[4:04] started right they don't need all these
[4:05] other
[4:06] distractions voices and things people
[4:09] laughing and talking same thing with
[4:11] some of you sisters need to make sure
[4:14] you be quiet when others are foot
[4:16] washing when we wash feet up here as men
[4:19] we Weddle the foot washing services over
[4:21] before we do any talking we leave the
[4:24] sanctuary there's no need for any
[4:26] talking to be going on downstairs or
[4:28] giggling or laughing or even discussing
[4:30] anything it's uh it's to me it's a holy
[4:33] thing I really I enjoy the foot washing
[4:35] part of the service because you're doing
[4:37] the service part so let's keep that
[4:39] quiet too but this listen this Thursday

[8:00] you know but God's give us a brain I
[8:04] like what brother
[8:05] oh Brady always said he said you know
[8:07] what you can be super spiritual and you
[8:09] can be all what you want to say but not
[8:11] give you five senses to contact this
[8:13] Earth with
[8:13] right and he give them to you to use
[8:16] all right
[8:18] just try sometime stay home psychologist
[8:21] pay my bills for me
[8:24] if you do it without attitude
[8:28] you'll be meeting him at the bank and
[8:31] then you'll be meeting him at the
[8:32] courthouse and then you'll be meeting
[8:33] him at the jailhouse
[8:34] because God's not going to pay your
[8:36] bills for you he's gonna he'll help you
[8:37] and he'll take you where you need to be
[8:39] but we don't need to be sluggered we
[8:42] remember that in the Book of Proverbs if
[8:44] you're a slugger then uh then you're not
[8:47] you're an Infidel all right so let's bow
[8:49] our heads as we get started here we're
[8:51] going to uh we're going to do all this
[8:53] in Reverse we started last time with a
[8:56] marriage and went down from the marriage
[8:57] and the role of the male and the role of
[8:59] the female down through the dating part
[9:01] well now we're going to start on the
[9:02] dating part and go backwards because
[9:04] that's what's fresh on your mind and
[9:06] we'll get that back fresh on your mind
[9:07] and then come back to this afternoon and
[9:10] this afternoon uh at least you could all
[9:12] make sure you be here especially the
[9:14] ones with children because I'm going to
[9:16] talk a little bit about more about the
[9:18] children and your role with the children
[9:20] than I did last time so let's just go to
[9:23] the Lord in prayer and pray that we get
[9:25] this finished today
[9:27] dear heavenly father we pray Lord as you
[9:28] be with us Lord one more time
[9:31] rather we ask you to forgive us of our
[9:33] sins and our many mistakes that we make
[9:34] do we make them Lord
[9:36] sometimes Lord we feel so insufficient
[9:39] but father you told us that this is the
[9:41] way we're going to have to get it
[9:42] through Apostles prophets pastors
[9:44] teachers and evangelists that you've
[9:46] given Lord to fulfill your gift and
[9:48] fulfill your word to get a people ready
[9:50] to perfect the Saints to get us ready
[9:53] for a Rapture father and to help us live
[9:55] our daily lives by the way I ask you to
[9:57] be with the sick ones that are Among Us
[9:59] Lord and also the sick ones that are not
[10:00] among us that should heal Him Father and
[10:02] touch them be with them Lord you said
[10:04] you sent your word and healed them and
[10:06] delivered them from their destruction so
[10:07] as the word Goes Forth we pray Lord that
[10:09] you would just touch him and being here
[10:11] that's the Lost Lord I pray that you
[10:13] save the soul father that's the most
[10:15] important thing is getting getting that
[10:17] Soul saved Lord and getting filled with
[10:19] the Holy Ghost and being a a vital part
[10:22] of the congregation Lord a part of your
[10:25] economy father we know we have to live
[10:26] in this economy and we have to do the
[10:29] things that Caesar tells us to do but
[10:30] father you have a greater economy the
[10:33] one that will take care of all things it
[10:34] doesn't need money to run Lord
[10:36] just need people to yield to you father
[10:39] we pray that you should be with us now
[10:41] take care of us keep us strengthen Us in
[10:43] Jesus name amen
[10:45] all right first Peter three that's where
[10:47] we started and we're going to read that
[10:49] today
[10:51] hold them up brother Richards last
[10:54] weekend I love those screens because it
[10:55] sure does make things go faster
[10:58] you can cover a lot more ground but
[11:00] first Peter 3 verse one through seven
[11:02] for those of you that haven't been here
[11:04] or that had forgot this is pretty much
[11:06] telling you the whole walk of a husband
[11:09] a wife and what they're supposed to do
[11:12] but it also brings them together as a
[11:14] couple and and it also shows us to me
[11:17] this verse one through seven shows how
[11:20] that God is restoring Fellowship back
[11:22] that we lost in the Garden of Eden right
[11:25] because we lost it in the garden and
[11:28] God's going to bring it back that's the
[11:29] whole Redemptive process exactly husband
[11:31] and wife family uh we can go to the
[11:34] spiritual part of it but we may do that
[11:36] later on I've been thinking about that a
[11:38] little bit uh yesterday and even this
[11:40] morning think about maybe going back to
[11:41] the spiritual part and doing a series of
[11:43] of how that that we you know that God
[11:46] courts us and and God gives us little
[11:48] things and God's our father but God's
[11:50] also our husband all right so courtship
[11:53] and dating is what we're going to begin
[11:54] with this morning but let's read first
[11:56] Peter verse
[11:59] first Peter 3 verse one through seven
[12:00] likewise he wives being subjection to
[12:03] your own husbands and if any obey not
[12:05] the word they also May without the word
[12:07] be won by the conversation of the wise
[12:09] now that's very powerful we'll get into
[12:11] that this afternoon
[12:13] while they behold your Chase
[12:14] conversation coupled with fear right
[12:16] who's adorning let it not be that
[12:18] outward adorning of planning the hair
[12:20] and wearing of gold or putting on of
[12:22] apparel but let it be the hidden man of
[12:24] the heart and that which is not
[12:26] corruptable even the ornament of a Meek
[12:28] and quiet Spirit which in the sight of
[12:30] God of great price you read that one
[12:31] more time even the ornament of a meek
[12:34] and quiet Spirit which is in the sight
[12:36] of God of great price right
[12:38] all right
[12:40] after this manner in the old time the
[12:42] holy women also who trusted in God
[12:44] adorned themselves being in subjection
[12:46] unto their own husbands even as Sarah
[12:48] obeyed Abraham calling him Lord whose
[12:51] daughters ye are not period comma
[12:55] as long as you do well right not
[12:58] everybody's Sarah
[13:00] not everybody's Abraham but you are
[13:03] Sarah as long as you do well daughters
[13:05] they're up and are not afraid with any
[13:08] amazement likewise
[13:10] he husbands dwell with them according to
[13:12] knowledge giving honor unto the wife as
[13:15] into the weaker vessel and it's being
[13:17] heirs together right of the grace of
[13:20] Life listen to this that your prayers be
[13:23] not hindered amen you do this wrong from
[13:25] one to six you do something wrong and
[13:27] there it hinders your prayer with God it
[13:29] hears your prayer life now let's go to
[13:31] Matthew 19 4-6
[13:35] and he answered and said unto them have
[13:37] you not read that he which made them at
[13:39] the beginning made them male and female
[13:42] so there is no surprise that we are now
[13:45] male and female huh and said for this
[13:48] cause shall a man leave father and
[13:50] mother and shall cleave to his wife
[13:52] and they twain shall be one flesh right
[13:55] wherefore they are not no more Twain but
[13:59] one flesh what therefore God hath joined
[14:02] together
[14:03] read that with me here what therefore
[14:06] God hath joined together let not man put
[14:10] asunder you may be seated in that Lord
[14:12] had his Blessing now that was the that
[14:14] was the god of Glory telling us that
[14:16] right that was in red letter we just
[14:18] don't have the red layer part up here on
[14:20] the screen but that's where Jesus was
[14:21] telling them he answers and said unto
[14:23] him have you not read right neither
[14:25] which made them at the beginning made
[14:26] them male and female all right so now I
[14:29] told Brother Anderson he's got long
[14:31] fingers so he's gonna have to really
[14:32] punch buttons back there to get these
[14:34] quotes and all up on the screen because
[14:36] we're brother Collins we preach 12
[14:37] sermons on this and we're gonna have to
[14:39] do it in two so we've got to listen real
[14:40] quick okay
[14:42] all right we're finished let's go home
[14:45] did you get that now listen I want to
[14:48] tell you too brother Joe said he's got
[14:49] all this together compiled this is a
[14:51] compilation of all 12 sermons today so
[14:54] you can get it online if you want to and
[14:57] I'm going to just hit the high points
[14:59] all right now brother random quote
[15:01] number one
[15:02] do you think I'm a brown let's let the
[15:04] prophet tell us
[15:06] and then let's go through this
[15:09] process yeah
[15:10] there's another choice that we have in
[15:12] life that's a life companion a young man
[15:16] or young woman stepping out on life has
[15:18] been given a right
[15:20] to make a choice right the young man
[15:23] chooses
[15:25] the young woman has a right to accept or
[15:28] reject
[15:29] the young man chooses
[15:32] the young lady has the opportunity to
[15:34] say yes or no right but it's still a
[15:37] choice on both sides
[15:40] both man and woman they have a right to
[15:43] Choice also you have a choice also as a
[15:47] Christian now number two
[15:50] and this is where we're going to get the
[15:51] basis of what we're doing today and I
[15:53] know some of you know what you know
[15:55] where we've been but
[15:57] I believe it works if we would have all
[16:00] done this older ones if we would have
[16:02] all done this we would have not been in
[16:04] the shape we're in or would not have had
[16:06] the problems that we had before right
[16:08] all right so we got another generation
[16:11] you know they asked brother Brown they
[16:12] said brother Brown what if you knew God
[16:14] was coming tomorrow he said
[16:15] he's building a house building a house
[16:17] right
[16:18] now he said he's getting married get
[16:20] married you know College we thought 1977
[16:22] was it
[16:23] well my that's what 40 something years
[16:26] now
[16:28] so that's going to be ignorant
[16:30] that's gonna be ignorant and say well
[16:32] our children are never going to grow up
[16:33] brother Brown said if you knew God was
[16:35] coming in the morning right not if you
[16:37] didn't know he said if you knew he was
[16:38] coming in the morning and you were
[16:40] building a house he should continue to
[16:41] build a house right if you were planting
[16:43] potatoes continue to plant potatoes he
[16:45] even told him he said if you're planning
[16:46] on getting married he said get married
[16:49] but we can't be we can't wait in fear a
[16:52] lot of people did that in the 70s the
[16:54] fear was 77 was it so but you know I
[16:57] didn't have a chance and you know Daddy
[16:59] was ridiculed for letting us go to
[17:00] college because number one again
[17:03] education was of the devil you know and
[17:05] number two we weren't going to be around
[17:06] here long enough yeah well I've got
[17:08] grandkids now
[17:16] oh Jesus comes tomorrow
[17:18] but I don't mind having a few grandkids
[17:20] amen you know I mean I know
[17:23] but we're going to we're going to preach
[17:26] what brother Brown said he said preach
[17:27] like everybody saved and preach like
[17:31] everybody's lost yeah right and that's
[17:33] what you got to do you got to preach you
[17:34] got to sing so that's what we're doing
[17:36] we're saying it right we've got a lot of
[17:38] young people sitting in the auditorium
[17:39] tonight or this morning that that if you
[17:43] will listen to some of us older ones
[17:45] it'll take care of a lot of your
[17:47] problems right later on in life you're
[17:49] going to have enough problems if you
[17:51] live almost perfect with God you're
[17:53] still going to have problems because you
[17:55] still got the devil standing there in
[17:57] the in this old flesh beating on you
[17:59] right all right but look let's see what
[18:01] a prophet tells us of the shooting of a
[18:03] bride
[18:04] which you know you have to plan
[18:07] look
[18:09] Pray when you're choosing yeah three
[18:12] things we're going to break them down
[18:14] plan look and pray when you're choosing
[18:18] but we see by this the Word of Promise
[18:21] he's a bride that a man would choose is
[18:23] going to reflect his character it
[18:27] reflects what's in him
[18:29] now could you imagine a man filled with
[18:30] the Holy Ghost take something like that
[18:32] to be a wife now what he's talking about
[18:34] is Jazzy about
[18:36] all right
[18:38] the congregation says no I I just don't
[18:40] see it brother now maybe I'm just an old
[18:42] crank but you know I just can't
[18:44] understand that see notice where it's
[18:46] going to reflect what's in him she is
[18:48] going to help him make his future home
[18:52] so the first thing we're going to talk
[18:53] about is planning planning looking and
[18:56] praying remember what we talked about a
[18:59] plan
[19:01] a method of arranging and I wrote that
[19:04] in capital letters at the end in advance
[19:07] you don't plan as you go
[19:09] you adjust as you go but you don't plan
[19:12] as you go you make a plan you have a
[19:14] business plan you go buy a business plan
[19:17] yeah sure there's bumps in the road and
[19:19] there's things you got to you got to
[19:21] adjust but at least you have a plan same
[19:24] thing with choosing a mate same thing
[19:26] with choosing a uh you know in finances
[19:29] or in business or whatever you know
[19:31] let's don't be so narrow-minded right
[19:35] how many of you got to get up go to work
[19:38] in the morning
[19:39] ninety percent of you eighty percent of
[19:41] you right
[19:43] so that's something part of my life
[19:45] man
[19:46] because Paul's playing First Corinthians
[19:48] 9 26 I therefore still run not as
[19:52] uncertainly
[19:54] relicans he knew where he was going yeah
[19:56] not as uncertainly same thing with you
[19:59] and I not as uncertainly so if I I'm not
[20:03] as one that beat at the air right
[20:05] so he made a plan
[20:07] he had a plan
[20:09] you and I brother Randleman uh in uh
[20:12] Christ Mission Garden real he said God
[20:13] had a what plan and a purpose
[20:17] so God had a plan probably man I know
[20:19] there was a lot of you thought I was
[20:21] cuckoo talked about a plant made no you
[20:23] need to make plans everybody needs to
[20:25] make a plane if you're playing better
[20:27] you'd get here before shirt starts right
[20:33] now praise the Lord in him
[20:37] and remember I always told you if you
[20:39] failed a plan
[20:40] your plan will always fail
[20:43] if I understand what I'm saying right if
[20:45] you fail to make a plan that plan will
[20:48] always fail right because you failed to
[20:50] make it same thing with choosing a
[20:52] spouse this is a lifelong commitment
[20:54] this is not like the world this is not
[20:56] something that we just oh I made a
[20:58] mistake you can't hit reverse on this
[21:00] one you can't hit rewind on this one
[21:02] right
[21:04] supposed to be so death do you part
[21:06] right that's right pretty serious a lot
[21:08] of other things you got to do to death
[21:10] to your part but that one you got to do
[21:11] from Death to you part so the planning
[21:13] part is very very important find out
[21:16] what you want to do your choice reveals
[21:18] your goal this is the list do you think
[21:21] of a brine now you can't have all things
[21:23] there might be one girl that's really
[21:24] pretty
[21:25] and the other girl maybe her statue
[21:27] looks better than this one and you might
[21:29] have to sacrifice one for the other
[21:31] but
[21:33] if you snuck the stature of the lady of
[21:35] a woman
[21:36] and she I don't care whether she's
[21:38] pretty or not you better look at her
[21:40] character right whether she's pretty or
[21:42] not pretty now for it is becoming if a
[21:45] Christian would choose a wife he ought
[21:47] to choose a genuine born-again woman
[21:49] amen
[21:50] regardless of what she looks like right
[21:52] we think different
[21:55] we'll get into in a few minutes we think
[21:56] we can change people
[21:58] it's what she is what makes her
[22:01] and then again that reflects his own
[22:03] Godly character and reflects what's in
[22:05] his mind
[22:06] and what's going to be in the future for
[22:08] his family will be raised by such a
[22:10] woman right for the future plans for his
[22:13] home
[22:14] if he managed one of these little modern
[22:15] Ricketts sex Queens what could he expect
[22:18] what kind of a home could a man expect
[22:20] to have a female is a girl that ain't
[22:22] got enough morals about her to stay home
[22:23] take care of the house and wants to work
[22:25] out in somebody's office what kind of a
[22:27] housekeeper will she be yeah you'll have
[22:29] babysitters and everything else true
[22:31] that's the prophet all right
[22:34] not my words after Prophet so there we
[22:37] go we need to plan pick out a character
[22:39] no I've told you sit down you young
[22:42] people and and make a plan I asked Tyler
[22:45] the other day I said what are you going
[22:46] to do and he said I'm going to college
[22:47] I'm going to do this and that's okay we
[22:49] started the plan
[22:51] most people when you get out of school
[22:53] they don't want to go down I don't know
[22:55] and you know why five years later I
[22:58] don't know
[23:00] because you ain't got a plan
[23:02] for something right
[23:05] if you fail
[23:07] get up and start again
[23:10] but at least do something
[23:12] what did Jesus tell the parable about
[23:14] the man that he gave the coins to
[23:17] yeah once at all I'm not going to use it
[23:18] I'm going to hide it
[23:20] the other ones took it out and what made
[23:22] money with it right
[23:24] the one that was the parable he said you
[23:26] take away from that man that held his
[23:28] and give it to the others right because
[23:30] he took his money and shoved it under a
[23:32] place and didn't let it work
[23:34] all right same thing with the plan you
[23:36] gotta make this thing work
[23:38] now number two the looking stage we got
[23:40] to get through this we got about 26 pays
[23:43] in here
[23:44] looking to turn one's eyes towards
[23:47] something
[23:48] but look don't look too naturalized look
[23:51] through spiritualized right
[23:54] because when you look it's not bad to
[23:56] look
[23:57] especially young people you gotta look
[23:59] you got eyes
[24:00] all right but look with a purpose
[24:04] look where they planned look through
[24:06] spiritual eyes listen to this
[24:09] that's always stuck with me of how that
[24:11] was remember he did the wedding ceremony
[24:13] of the people on the hill the real rich
[24:16] people and then they did the ceremony of
[24:17] the people down alley that was that was
[24:20] living in a box car sisters
[24:24] how many of you would live in a boxcar
[24:26] yeah
[24:27] didn't think so there that's always
[24:30] something nobody said anything
[24:32] that's always stuck with me now you
[24:34] might live in a box car but may not be
[24:36] the one you went right now
[24:40] one chose a beautiful girl the other one
[24:43] chose character now that's the only way
[24:48] that's the only way you could chew right
[24:51] first look for character and then if you
[24:53] love her fine notice God first Adam
[24:55] didn't have a choice for his wife he
[24:58] didn't get a choice God just made him
[25:00] one and he didn't get to choose her so
[25:02] we find out that she let him astray from
[25:04] God's word he didn't get to pray over
[25:07] the matter
[25:09] he isn't like you and I he didn't get a
[25:13] choice but you and I got a choice
[25:16] to look at character right so there's a
[25:18] looking part but as we're looking you
[25:20] listen to what we're saying let's go to
[25:22] the next one
[25:25] see everybody would have thought and
[25:26] when we did this this came along later
[25:28] on in the in the uh in the sermon you
[25:32] think well the first thing you got to do
[25:33] is look for love
[25:36] I don't
[25:38] I don't think so
[25:41] because you got a plan you know what you
[25:42] don't know who's gonna fit that plan
[25:44] right you know you and then you go to
[25:46] look and then you may have to look
[25:47] around you know you might have to shop a
[25:49] little bit
[25:50] but that's okay as long as you're doing
[25:52] it with spiritual lives exactly all
[25:54] right not just Western after everything
[25:56] but see looking for Real Love see this
[25:59] is what most of us thought was the only
[26:00] thing to look for and it's not
[26:04] the first thing to look for but it is
[26:06] important
[26:07] do not look for what the world calls
[26:09] love because it's selfish and
[26:10] self-centered I I mean me look at me
[26:13] everybody say amen amen
[26:16] you look at the world today
[26:19] what you gonna do for me that's not love
[26:23] that is not love
[26:25] no love is not selfish and self-centered
[26:29] it's what it's a servant right we'll
[26:32] talk about that in a minute real love
[26:33] gives of itself you really can't explain
[26:36] true love you have to just work your way
[26:38] into it yeah isn't that right come on
[26:40] people have been married over 30 years
[26:42] 20 years I'll be 32 years coming up 30
[26:46] dude green
[26:50] Lord I was going to remember that 33.
[26:53] y'all should be 29 in a couple of days
[26:55] so we were married for four years before
[26:58] that so 33.
[27:01] and have faith on that one didn't I
[27:03] faith is the key but Jen and I learned
[27:07] to love each other right
[27:08] you that have been married a while you
[27:10] had to learn to love your partner you
[27:12] had to work but you're not a clue what
[27:13] love is that's why I want you to look at
[27:15] the at the planning part plan and say
[27:18] hey this is what I want to do in my my
[27:20] life I told you many times before
[27:22] you men
[27:23] if you want to plan after your life that
[27:26] you don't want your wife to ever work
[27:27] you better get a good job
[27:31] but if you're not
[27:33] talk to the person you're gonna look at
[27:36] and say hey you're gonna have to work
[27:39] so I can go hunting yeah
[27:42] that's selfish in south standard we
[27:43] don't need to do that
[27:46] nobody ain't in that would you please
[27:49] but you see what true love is though
[27:51] true love is not selfish
[27:53] that's right what get what gets people
[27:55] in divorce situations is selfishness
[27:57] right self-centered right some of you
[28:00] that's been divorced I don't want you to
[28:02] raise your hand but you know that's true
[28:04] self-centered selfish and we still have
[28:07] a little bit of that anyway yeah
[28:09] but you really can't explain true love
[28:11] but faith is a key because brother
[28:13] random we're going to look at in just a
[28:14] little while her brother Brown said
[28:16] you've got to have faith in her right
[28:17] she's got to have faith in you all right
[28:20] hey we're living life here okay all
[28:22] right now 5A
[28:24] the absolute you when you get married
[28:27] they're had to wind back through your
[28:29] mind I love them
[28:31] when you got married there had to wind
[28:33] back through your mind
[28:36] so this was during the dating and the
[28:38] courting and all that right anybody
[28:40] understand what brother Brown
[28:42] when you got married there had to wind
[28:45] back through your mind
[28:47] something till you hit that pie pose
[28:50] because somewhere you're gonna say
[28:51] that's the one
[28:52] right
[28:53] and it should have been love for your
[28:55] wife or your husband well maybe she
[28:58] ain't as pretty as John's wife oh well
[29:01] she's not done this or that but there's
[29:03] something about her that you it strikes
[29:06] you
[29:07] right see when I first met Jim she was
[29:09] not a straight-ass student she didn't
[29:11] care about school
[29:13] right
[29:15] he care about any of that
[29:17] but I saw
[29:20] that if somebody would give her a little
[29:22] Direction
[29:23] that she could be good in school right
[29:27] you're the only one who needs to say
[29:28] right that's right
[29:31] so she turned from
[29:36] come back and helped her until she was
[29:38] making A's and B's when she got out of
[29:40] school and she enjoyed going to school
[29:42] it wasn't like she you know school to
[29:44] her was like a babysitter you know she
[29:45] just went to school and then she went
[29:46] home you know somewhere in between there
[29:49] were some teachers yeah but I saw
[29:51] something in her that that was different
[29:52] than what anybody else saw thank God I
[29:55] did you know but that's the something
[29:57] about her that it strikes you you say
[30:00] she might not be as pretty as the other
[30:02] or he might not be as handsome as the
[30:03] other but there has to be an absolute
[30:06] there so when you're planning and
[30:07] looking you're looking for an absolute
[30:09] we know that Jesus Christ is our
[30:11] absolute and our soul right right but we
[30:13] got to look at a character that'll fit
[30:15] our character right right an absolute
[30:19] are you gonna stay married all right
[30:23] that that person is different
[30:26] and there is where you hold on to right
[30:30] if that isn't there
[30:32] you better not get married yeah that
[30:35] typo
[30:36] absolutely let's go to find B questions
[30:39] and answers
[30:40] on the Holy Ghost I've got to know
[30:43] listen this is a prophet
[30:45] this is the prophets Mr Collins listen
[30:47] to this I've got to know what I'm doing
[30:50] before I can have faith in what I'm
[30:53] doing right
[30:54] told you many times before talking about
[30:57] a body changer getting off subject a
[30:59] little bit but we got to understand that
[31:01] body change there's the fear
[31:03] the fear that I know is and I don't know
[31:05] how electricity works so I don't go over
[31:08] there and pull that panel off of that
[31:09] box I know better because I'm I'm scared
[31:11] I'm I have fear but now some of you
[31:13] there's a master electrician all you see
[31:15] that is just like me you know putting up
[31:18] putting a gun together or something that
[31:20] I can do but I'm fear I'm fearful of
[31:22] that because why I don't know how to do
[31:24] it yeah but once I know how to do it
[31:26] just become second nature I just walk
[31:28] over there put the wires where they need
[31:29] to go my same thing brother Brown I got
[31:31] to know what I'm doing before I can have
[31:33] faith in what I'm doing
[31:35] it why don't you marry your wife
[31:37] you had faith in them no no look at this
[31:40] you had tried her
[31:43] watched her
[31:46] looking watch Turner
[31:49] seeing what seeing what she come from
[31:54] who she was that's the way with a
[31:56] scripture with God and then he's talking
[31:58] about us in the in the spiritual same
[32:00] way
[32:01] because God tries us God watches us
[32:04] because I see what God sees what's going
[32:06] to call what kind of qualities we have
[32:07] therefore then he can entrust you
[32:09] certain things like the statue of a
[32:11] perfect man he's not going to give me
[32:12] these virtues because
[32:14] they're just there
[32:15] that's right power without character is
[32:18] what satanic
[32:19] but Power with character power able to
[32:22] handle these gifts expect to rule God's
[32:25] not going to give him all this We're Not
[32:27] Gonna I hope that when Jim and I fly
[32:29] back in a couple of weeks but I don't
[32:31] see a 14 year old kid at the front of
[32:33] the airplane yeah well the captain's
[32:35] thing on yeah
[32:37] doing bubble gum and throwing spit wands
[32:40] and then we're gonna get this plane up
[32:42] somehow no you're gonna have somebody
[32:44] there that's had what experience right
[32:46] somebody knows how to do it and that's
[32:48] the same way with you and I that's why I
[32:50] wished it I wish that I would have
[32:52] listened to my parents I you know I told
[32:54] my kids
[32:55] the kids get any of you kids want to be
[32:57] famous I know you want to be people that
[32:59] know you and be famous just how you
[33:01] gonna be famous
[33:02] yeah yeah you do you know how you want
[33:06] to be you know how you're going to be
[33:07] famous if you'll do everything your
[33:10] parents tell you right
[33:12] and do it all right you'll be the only
[33:15] kid in the world ever do that they'll
[33:17] have you on Time Magazine they'll have
[33:18] you in People magazine they'll have you
[33:20] on Oprah Winfrey they'll have to have
[33:22] you on all kinds of things right
[33:24] that's right because you did exactly
[33:25] what your parents said so we're not
[33:26] talking a bunch of people that's done
[33:28] all this to the Perfection right
[33:30] right you're not all done this to
[33:33] Perfection but we hope that what little
[33:35] bit we can do will help us because
[33:37] remember what brother Brown said and I
[33:39] didn't put it in here he said it's the
[33:41] primer of things what primary yeah you
[33:44] don't jump to high school you go to
[33:45] primary school he said these primer
[33:48] things is where we're missing it at all
[33:50] right same way with husband and wife we
[33:53] still
[33:54] you gotta have hits yet all right right
[33:58] next one
[33:59] praying
[34:01] now what does praying do to make Earnest
[34:04] petition that's what praying means to
[34:06] make Earnest petition
[34:10] God give me a good wife
[34:13] God give me somebody that can help me
[34:17] because June June is an accessory she
[34:20] enhances me she she's and I believe she
[34:23] does I mean she doesn't sometimes but I
[34:25] believe she really does same way with
[34:27] you you accessorize your your mate and I
[34:30] will get into that with the uh male and
[34:33] female tonight or this afternoon in
[34:35] Hebrews chapter 7
[34:37] part two I'll remember
[34:41] sister Esther
[34:45] God's knows are the best yeses you can
[34:47] have yeah yeah so if God tells you no
[34:50] then you say thank God man amen Tyler
[34:54] all you Brothers
[34:55] and God says no if you feel checked no
[34:58] that's right that's the best yes you'll
[35:00] ever get because he knows if you make
[35:02] this Choice with your free moral agent
[35:04] you make any choice you want if you make
[35:06] this choice this is what's going to
[35:07] happen down the road right right so his
[35:09] nose are the best yeses that you can
[35:11] have right marriage is Honorable but it
[35:13] should be entered prayerfully and
[35:15] reverently praying and genuine love for
[35:18] that woman will bind you together
[35:19] forever what you bind on Earth I'll buy
[35:21] it in heaven when you walk down the
[35:23] street you notice you may get old and
[35:25] gray and wrinkled but that same love you
[35:26] had for her when she was a young
[35:28] beautiful woman you'll still have it
[35:31] right you may get stoop shouldered bald
[35:33] headed wrinkled face and everything else
[35:35] but she'll love you just like you did
[35:37] when you stood when you stand with wide
[35:40] shoulders and curly hair if it's really
[35:43] good right for you're looking to the
[35:45] time when you've crossed the river
[35:46] Yonder when you'll spring back again to
[35:48] young men and women to live together
[35:50] forever that's God's Eternal promise he
[35:55] said he would do it he not only that
[35:57] we'll get to in a man he swore he would
[35:59] do it man so husbands and wives that are
[36:02] getting older and you're getting you
[36:03] know you're getting where things don't
[36:05] work like they used to you know your
[36:07] joints get aching and all that stuff
[36:08] just remember one thing
[36:10] you're going to be in the youth the
[36:12] prime of your youth with your mate for
[36:14] an eternity so what are we heading to
[36:17] Glory we're heading to what we should
[36:19] have had had there not been a fall right
[36:22] right and it includes husband and wife
[36:24] and children right right it includes
[36:27] husband and wife and children we're not
[36:28] going to be all separated all over
[36:29] Heaven I'll read that to you when we get
[36:32] to the mother part
[36:34] brother Brown says you'll be there with
[36:35] your family for an eternity right right
[36:37] that's why the promise
[36:41] that I look at is is and Isaiah says
[36:43] you'll be there with your Offspring well
[36:45] who is that that's your children right
[36:46] and your children's children that's your
[36:48] grandkids all right so you're there with
[36:50] your family that's why I went downstairs
[36:52] we have that list of people
[36:54] which is your family my family written
[36:57] down here that we pray for every day I
[36:59] keep them on my desk every day and it
[37:01] reminds me to pray for these people
[37:03] every day to pray for them to come back
[37:06] to the Lord all right let's go to the
[37:08] next one number seven
[37:10] Prophet Elijah now that's what we do
[37:13] sometimes we often go off on a tantrum
[37:15] somewhere and not think about God and
[37:17] not pray over it I ask the Lord whether
[37:20] we should do it or not we find out that
[37:23] our supply of blessings it's cut off
[37:25] yeah
[37:30] you read that
[37:32] we find out that our supply of blessings
[37:35] is cut off then we wonder sometimes well
[37:38] wonder why I can't have no more blessing
[37:41] you don't watch
[37:43] you let down on your prayer life
[37:45] you said well I'm a Christian well
[37:47] that's the more sign you should pray
[37:48] more than ever read the Bible every day
[37:51] pray every day
[37:53] do we do this
[37:55] do we do this
[37:57] read the Bible every day pray every day
[38:02] don't make any decision too harshly or
[38:04] too quickly this is the prophet
[38:07] this man knew how to live life and face
[38:09] nobody in the world knew how to live
[38:10] life this man knew how to live life all
[38:12] right in the natural and in the
[38:14] spiritual right read the Bible every day
[38:16] pray every day don't make any decisions
[38:18] too harshly or too quickly without first
[38:20] considering God about it ask him shall I
[38:23] do this father ask him is this your will
[38:25] for me to do this
[38:26] and see what the holy spirit will speak
[38:28] to you he might not give you a vision
[38:30] but he will speak in some way to you to
[38:32] let you know if you'll be sincere
[38:35] be sincere
[38:36] and ask him right all right now there's
[38:39] a few things we need to look at right
[38:40] here when we're dating I'm either
[38:42] getting into the dating stage listen to
[38:44] this
[38:46] note before we enter the dating phase
[38:48] let's look at some clear do's and don'ts
[38:51] these things should be discussed before
[38:54] a serious relationship begins do not do
[38:57] not date an unbeliever
[38:59] do not be unequally yoked
[39:02] that's right
[39:04] don't
[39:06] now listen some of us did
[39:10] no one's dead so I can't I can't say I
[39:13] did that
[39:15] but you know what I was an unbeliever
[39:17] too
[39:18] right so let's go back to the typos be a
[39:21] believer first and then don't date an
[39:23] unbeliever you know
[39:25] that's right because an unbeliever is
[39:26] going to date an unbeliever every time
[39:29] yeah right I believe we're gonna date an
[39:33] unbeliever every time yeah
[39:35] yeah because most of the time you can't
[39:37] get a believer in unbeliever hardly
[39:38] together especially during the dating
[39:39] part because One's Gonna want something
[39:41] and the other one's not you understand
[39:42] what I'm saying
[39:44] do not date a divorced person with a
[39:46] living spouse now that ought to be
[39:47] self-explanatory brother Devil's been
[39:48] through all that these are some things
[39:50] that you don't even get involved with
[39:53] don't start a relationship that's why I
[39:55] said
[39:56] pray plan pray look and pray talk to the
[40:00] person
[40:01] talk to the person you told me hey
[40:04] you never know remember I told you the
[40:06] story about the brother that that was uh
[40:09] marrying a lady and they got to the they
[40:11] got to the wedding night and he found
[40:13] out she had been
[40:14] when somebody had a child
[40:16] she forgot to tell him I guess
[40:19] yeah but I if he would have asked that
[40:22] question it's not bad to ask that
[40:24] question not bad to ask these questions
[40:26] right you ever been engaged before right
[40:28] you've been engaged brother now like I
[40:30] said before it's a vow do not date
[40:32] someone that's been previously engaged
[40:33] if you've ever said yes
[40:35] if you say no don't worry about it but
[40:37] if you've ever said yes
[40:39] to another person don't date them
[40:41] because you can't marry him in God's
[40:43] eyes they're married to that person they
[40:44] were engaged to man right that's right
[40:47] right according to the vows in the Book
[40:49] of Numbers right you vile vile brother
[40:51] Brown said it's a vowel that marries you
[40:53] correct do not date thinking you will
[40:55] change them after marriage this is the
[40:58] devil's trap yeah dating is not a
[41:02] witnessing opportunity right well if I'm
[41:04] just getting to come to church
[41:06] yeah okay yeah
[41:10] or her
[41:11] become the church were they not going to
[41:13] want you to go to church for them then
[41:14] they're going to want you to do this
[41:16] because you know what
[41:18] I'm Believers going to want you to do
[41:19] something with them so I don't date an
[41:21] unbeliever yeah if you date a believer
[41:25] right here's the place to be yeah
[41:28] do not Date spoiled or selfish people
[41:30] well knocks a lot of us down huh
[41:39] remember what we said about that though
[41:40] brother Brown talked about spoiling
[41:41] selfish people I cut out all these
[41:43] quotes remember this is 12 sermons and
[41:45] two
[41:45] all right
[41:46] so do not Date spoiled or selfish people
[41:49] you can find out real quick
[41:51] he was spoiled and selfish
[41:54] number six remember this one is very
[41:57] important do not flirt
[41:59] do not flirt with anybody brother Brown
[42:01] said don't you even make eyes
[42:03] I didn't bring the quote with that but
[42:05] don't you even make eyes
[42:07] you know it's all about Lincoln and
[42:09] whistling and flirting and see it's fake
[42:12] it's a put on that's that's not the
[42:13] person you want to be with it hurts both
[42:15] parties yeah so don't flirt with people
[42:17] giving them a false hope yeah like
[42:20] brothers that we flirt with
[42:21] denominations and we flirt with this one
[42:23] and flirt with that one same thing
[42:24] remember brother Brown when he when he
[42:26] uh discerned that brother Spirit he
[42:28] thought he was running around his wife
[42:30] but he said what he was flirting with
[42:31] organized religion right that's what it
[42:33] was don't flirt with organized religion
[42:35] don't flirt with something that you
[42:36] can't have right
[42:38] because they'll only harm both
[42:41] parties so now as we come to this of the
[42:44] do not I'll show you what to do in this
[42:47] dating phase now it's not the planning
[42:49] and looking and searching look the
[42:51] dating stage of your journey to find a
[42:53] spouse is not the searching stage yeah
[42:56] that's over with you found her you found
[43:00] him
[43:02] not that he smells so good or his hair's
[43:05] slick remember when we read about where
[43:07] he said his mama did the boy had so much
[43:09] grease on his hair he couldn't close his
[43:10] mouth you know
[43:14] that's brother Brown telling you those
[43:15] stories so you know what he saw it he
[43:17] saw the people he saw it happen
[43:20] remember that little girl he dated her
[43:22] Nat was like a swan and all that stuff
[43:24] yeah she was smoking a cigarette and he
[43:26] got away from her pretty quick
[43:27] now the dating stage is not the
[43:30] searching stage that is the planning
[43:32] looking and praying stage planting
[43:33] looking and praying is kind of like a
[43:35] shotgun you know
[43:37] and you're looking
[43:38] you're praying you're planning but the
[43:40] dating stage comes down to one person
[43:43] dating is the time to find one person
[43:46] and start telling about what each of you
[43:49] really think and believe about various
[43:50] puppets that are important in America
[43:51] because you're moving toward a Mary's
[43:54] relationship you're not using the dating
[43:56] system while I'm dating this one and
[43:58] didn't know I'm gonna go and date this
[43:59] one dating should lead straight to
[44:01] marriage yeah
[44:03] right dating should lead straight to
[44:06] marriage all right
[44:08] goes right in here you can really get
[44:11] yourself messed up let's go to the next
[44:13] this is a this is a note here today the
[44:16] world is made dating a cheap
[44:18] relationship based purely on flexially
[44:20] motive that's right while I'm dating
[44:21] this one while I'm dating that one while
[44:23] I'm dating this and that's nothing but a
[44:24] cheap relationship
[44:26] days should be when two people finally
[44:28] get together yeah
[44:30] and say
[44:32] like nobody else I I don't see nobody
[44:35] else
[44:36] get kind of narrow-minded
[44:38] that's okay if you narrow-minded towards
[44:41] her or him yeah but dating is not
[44:43] intended to be a recreational activity
[44:45] you don't go on a date just to get to go
[44:47] to Six Flags that's not a date
[44:49] right that's just being social and it's
[44:53] just being social going but no dating is
[44:55] not intended to be recreational activity
[44:57] or something we do to hang out or have
[44:59] fun
[45:00] do not use dating as a way to get away
[45:02] from hype from the home
[45:04] the dating stage of your journey to find
[45:06] a spouse is not the searching stage
[45:07] that's in the planning looking and
[45:09] praying
[45:10] dating is the time to find out what each
[45:12] of them wanted you to really think and
[45:14] believe about marriage topics you can go
[45:16] ahead and start talking about things
[45:17] that you don't just throw out to
[45:19] everybody but the fact is going to be
[45:20] your bride that's your secret bride you
[45:22] talk to her secret things not and listen
[45:24] keep your conversation clean yeah we'll
[45:26] talk about that amen keep the
[45:28] conversation clean but there are things
[45:30] that you can talk about in the dating
[45:32] stage that you don't talk about the
[45:33] planning and looking and searching and
[45:35] getting ready and this is putting you
[45:37] towards something
[45:39] so wonderful but yet remember
[45:42] at this point
[45:43] it's where the young man that wants to
[45:44] date a girl now girls you don't have to
[45:46] go ask your daddy
[45:48] if you can date Johnny
[45:50] 's responsibility is to ask Daddy
[45:54] at this point is what a young man that
[45:55] wants to date a girl remember brother
[45:57] Brown he won't he remember he drive up
[45:59] to Mr Miss Brown's house he said I knew
[46:01] better than the horn
[46:03] he said I got out of my car and walked
[46:06] up to the front porch and I spoke to Mrs
[46:09] Brum and whoever you know uh hopes of
[46:12] bromback
[46:14] um he said I spoke to both of them
[46:16] all right didn't honk the horn right
[46:19] okay let's go at this point is where the
[46:21] young man wants a day girl that's still
[46:22] under her father's headship she seek her
[46:25] father's blessing
[46:26] before
[46:28] he asked her to date him yeah
[46:30] the parents are now involved in the
[46:32] process looking for warning signs that
[46:34] the two dating cannot see because you do
[46:36] get narrow-minded during this part of
[46:37] the state all right you need to be like
[46:39] brother Keith Reed when he sees two
[46:41] people and getting ready to start dating
[46:42] and get serious he brings them before
[46:44] the church
[46:45] he says okay we as a family
[46:47] are going to watch these two
[46:50] now you got 250 eyes looking at these
[46:54] people they won't be able to breathe
[46:56] if their hair touches each other
[46:58] somebody's gonna go ah
[47:02] but you know what it's for their purity
[47:05] and they're good because we still got
[47:07] this boy right here to deal with woman
[47:09] and man you guys still got this right
[47:11] here this Lux devil right here is what
[47:13] hits you right there all right so if
[47:16] enough eyes get to washing you
[47:18] you'll be careful yeah remember this is
[47:21] a stage where there will be
[47:22] opportunities and temptations to bring
[47:24] guilt and shame to the relationship why
[47:26] because you're getting closer together
[47:28] this will be the time that you will be
[47:30] tested the most this is where you will
[47:33] know if you are a True Believer or not
[47:36] and that's exactly the truth all right
[47:38] now let's go to number eight life
[47:42] brother Brown says how about you man
[47:44] you boys with your girlfriends you girls
[47:46] with your boyfriends
[47:48] if you're God's children conduct
[47:50] yourself like God's children
[47:52] be different
[47:54] I've always told you be different
[47:58] be different if you're different than
[48:00] than
[48:00] you're a testimony and God will protect
[48:04] you but if you want to be like everybody
[48:05] else in the world
[48:08] come on people same thing in our
[48:11] Christian Life right
[48:13] don't walk up against the line we know
[48:16] where the line is right
[48:17] right we've been taught for years where
[48:19] that line is you're supposed to quit
[48:22] not see how close to it you can get amen
[48:26] the world wants you to see that right
[48:30] watch to see that's in you in other
[48:32] words what's inside you that's what the
[48:34] world wants to see because you'll
[48:35] manifest yourself I promise you
[48:37] and I think so remember when you start
[48:39] dating
[48:40] this one is very powerful but we have to
[48:42] cut a lot of this out but she will be
[48:45] someone's wife you remember that
[48:48] number two Sean the very appearance of
[48:50] evil like I said don't get yourself in a
[48:52] position to where something could go
[48:54] wrong
[48:55] don't go and be alone somewhere you're
[48:57] not supposed to be alone right because
[48:59] you know what there's always going to be
[49:00] three of you there
[49:03] you and him and the devil yeah always
[49:07] so be careful bring God in there and let
[49:10] him run the devil out
[49:11] all right number three be a virgin be
[49:13] pure first Timothy 4 12 let no man
[49:15] despise thy youth
[49:17] but these are an example of the
[49:19] Believers
[49:21] in word in conversation in charity in
[49:25] spirit in faith and impurity
[49:28] look impurity be a virgin
[49:31] same way with us as Christians we're
[49:33] supposed to be virgins right
[49:35] virtuous sinless brought of Jesus Christ
[49:37] right well if we can't live it in the
[49:39] natural
[49:40] how are we going to live it in the
[49:42] spiritual
[49:43] all right number four it's good not to
[49:45] touch First Corinthians 7 verse 1 2. now
[49:48] concerning the things there of you
[49:49] writing to me it is good for a man not
[49:51] to touch a woman
[49:52] nevertheless to avoid fornication let
[49:54] every man have his own wife
[49:57] my girlfriend
[49:59] why I let every woman have her own
[50:03] husband
[50:04] now just don't touch
[50:06] you don't have plenty of time to do that
[50:08] when you're married amen plenty
[50:11] number five holding hands look what
[50:13] James says verse James 1 12-16
[50:17] blessed is the man that endures
[50:19] Temptation so you're going to be tempted
[50:22] you're gonna be tempted
[50:25] but when he has tried he shall receive
[50:27] the Crown of Life which the Lord has
[50:28] promised to them that love him let no
[50:30] man say when he's tempted I am tempted
[50:32] of God for God cannot be tempted with
[50:34] evil neither tempted to any man but
[50:37] every man is tempted when he is drawn
[50:39] away of his own lust and in Christ
[50:45] let me stop right here it's not bad for
[50:47] that to happen
[50:48] yeah if you cut it off right because
[50:52] you're going to be that it's just
[50:53] telling you that's what's going to
[50:54] happen right you're going to endure
[50:57] Temptation in other words it's not going
[50:58] to be one trial
[51:00] right it's going to be several
[51:03] all right
[51:04] and in price then when left unless have
[51:07] conceived
[51:08] it reinforced sin look at the stages
[51:10] that it's going through
[51:12] and sin when it is finished bringing
[51:14] forth death right do not air my beloved
[51:17] brethren we know that's in the spiritual
[51:19] but it's also in the natural also man
[51:21] you're going to be tempted girls and
[51:24] boys
[51:24] we're even tempted as male as older
[51:27] people yeah
[51:28] yeah but every man is tempted when he
[51:31] has drawn away of his own lust and it
[51:32] nice cut the thing off
[51:34] showing the very appearance of evil all
[51:36] right
[51:36] so now let's go to number nine
[51:39] let's see what brother Brown says about
[51:40] this women young women coming in and
[51:43] these men kissing these women don't you
[51:44] do that don't you you keep away from
[51:46] there you remember that if she's young
[51:49] single or whatever she is she'll be
[51:51] somebody's wife someday and you haven't
[51:53] gotten no business doing that stay away
[51:55] from her you want to greet her then be a
[51:57] Son of God shake her hand and say how do
[51:58] you do sister and let that settle it
[52:00] right there see right stay away from
[52:02] these things it's filth
[52:03] and it'll soon get you in trouble when
[52:05] lust is conceived it brings forth Sin
[52:07] Sin when it's finished brings forth what
[52:09] death all right if you want a greeter
[52:12] Shake Your Hand
[52:14] and it'll soon get you into trouble you
[52:15] just oh that's just sin is so easy it's
[52:18] so appetizing so pleasant
[52:20] listen folks this is the most appetizing
[52:23] and pleasure seeking world has ever been
[52:25] since a dawn of time
[52:27] you say well I can't help it God's put
[52:30] you here for a purpose he puts you here
[52:33] to help it amen he puts you here to have
[52:36] somebody stand In a Pulpit or somebody
[52:37] raise you as a child to tell you these
[52:40] things that you can overcome you can't
[52:43] you look out and have those people slop
[52:45] around with each other Lord we see it
[52:46] every day women don't care they have
[52:48] kids with anybody that want to and the
[52:50] man sleeps in anybody it's just Dog Eat
[52:53] Dog brother I'm said that I left that
[52:54] cold out but brother I remember he said
[52:55] dog eat dog but not a Christian right
[52:58] we're supposed to be separate it's so
[53:01] easy to fall right into it the best
[53:03] thing to do
[53:04] the very even appearance of it stay away
[53:06] from it get back
[53:08] be a real Christian of it all right
[53:10] number six
[53:11] in hugging remember what we said we
[53:14] pulled up the article in 2008 for those
[53:16] of you that weren't here in 2008 they
[53:18] ran an article in a paper showing that
[53:21] how the even the saliva and the man's
[53:23] lip in the glands in the lips and
[53:25] brother Brown we thought he was crazy
[53:26] when he said the sex glands was in the
[53:28] lips because we all knew they were
[53:31] somewhere else you know we all knew that
[53:33] but science has proven that kissing
[53:36] releases hormones we read the article we
[53:38] won't read it now but we read the
[53:40] article there where the kissing releases
[53:41] hormones and the hormone starts an
[53:43] aphrodisiac and for those of you that
[53:45] are older you know what that is those of
[53:47] you that's younger you'll learn about it
[53:48] when you get older and yeah ask your mom
[53:51] and Danny
[53:54] hey these things are not supposed to be
[53:55] only talked about in church you're
[53:57] supposed to be doing it at home right
[53:58] right
[54:00] amen let's be doing that at home don't
[54:03] depend on your pastor that's the problem
[54:04] with teachers people depend on teachers
[54:06] and schools to be the to be the parent
[54:09] and this and that and the other and the
[54:11] babysitter no
[54:13] I knew one thing's for sure brother
[54:15] Collins if I got a weapon at school I
[54:17] got one at home
[54:19] and I told them
[54:22] we didn't live under the Constitution
[54:23] United States in my house the
[54:25] Constitution said you were innocent
[54:27] until proven guilty in my house you are
[54:30] guilty until proven innocent and then
[54:31] they'd even usually get to the innocent
[54:33] party
[54:36] because we knew we needed it anyway but
[54:38] we did get a few maybe that we didn't
[54:40] need but
[54:41] it all equals out but we knew one thing
[54:45] for sure that if we misbehave in school
[54:46] we were going to get it at home

[54:50] start all right questions and answers

[56:41] all right so you know you can get all
[56:43] that going when you get married all
[56:45] right number seven
[56:47] on occasion well this is pretty
[56:48] self-explanatory brother Dale's been
[56:50] through this talking to us about
[56:52] marriage and divorce this kind of all
[56:54] fits together
[56:55] First Corinthians 6 18 flee fornication
[56:57] ever seen that a man doeth is without
[56:59] the body but he that commits fornication
[57:01] sent us against his own body
[57:04] what no you're not that your body is the
[57:06] Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you
[57:08] which you have of God and you are not
[57:10] your own for your Bot with a prize
[57:12] therefore glorify God in your body
[57:14] and your spirit which is God your body
[57:18] yeah God owns this body right amen right
[57:22] and in spirit which regards first
[57:24] Thessalonians 4 3-5 for this is the will
[57:27] of God
[57:29] this is the will of God you want to be
[57:31] in the will of God do this right even
[57:33] your sanctification that you should
[57:35] abstain from fornication
[57:37] that every one of you should know how to
[57:40] possess his vessel in sanctification and
[57:43] honor not in the lust of concupences
[57:46] even as the Gentiles which no not God
[57:49] and just like president was talking
[57:51] about when when
[57:53] um Paul was talking to the Gentiles
[57:55] trying to bring him over into
[57:55] Christianity
[57:57] they didn't know that's right five four
[57:59] or five wives and one guy was living
[58:01] with his mother-in-law and you know
[58:03] things like that were going I mean
[58:04] living with his stepmother and things
[58:06] going on like that Paul had to come in
[58:08] and bring this down and tell them in
[58:10] Thessalonians hey I'm staying from that
[58:13] stop it right
[58:14] don't you know your body's a temple of
[58:16] the Holy Ghost so you're not yeah you're
[58:18] defiling things that that well we'll
[58:21] read it next one
[58:23] invisible Union
[58:27] listen sisters and brothers too that
[58:29] brother Brown talks about sisters
[58:33] let's read it marriage is the oldest
[58:35] institution in the world marriage was
[58:36] performed first and instituted in the
[58:38] Garden of Eden a woman is interested
[58:40] with certain characters that she must
[58:42] not defile
[58:43] a woman is trusted to that there's not a
[58:45] creation creature on earth like a woman
[58:48] there's no female dog no female of any
[58:50] kind interested with the character that
[58:52] a woman is does everybody understand
[58:53] what he's talking about amen a female
[58:55] dog a couple of times a year she goes
[58:58] into her cycle she gets pregnant she has
[59:00] babies
[59:02] right a human woman anytime reading
[59:06] marriage and divorce she can be had any
[59:08] time or she can give herself away at any
[59:10] moment she doesn't have to wait to the
[59:12] cycle just for her children as everybody
[59:13] understand what I'm talking about
[59:15] right okay
[59:18] all right look but a woman was not even
[59:20] in the beginning of the creation because
[59:22] God knows that she would fall all other
[59:24] females could not commit adultery she's
[59:27] the only one that can commit adultery
[59:28] why because she can say yes and no right
[59:32] she is the only one who can commit
[59:34] adulthood if she had been made like the
[59:35] original that would have been this
[59:36] complementary to God's great wisdom see
[59:38] he was made a byproduct of a man but
[59:41] because she was cast over on that side
[59:42] she has also been given a sacred charge
[59:44] from God for Redemption right
[59:49] for Redemption amen
[59:52] because you got to get us here before we
[59:53] can be redeemed amen just to be honest
[59:57] right we had to come through the womb of
[59:59] a woman born in sin Champion he lost
[1:00:02] so to make we can be redeemed how we
[1:00:05] redeem then we become The Virtuous
[1:00:07] sinless bride of Jesus Christ we'll talk
[1:00:09] about that in a minute for Redemption
[1:00:10] she's got characters that she must not
[1:00:12] defile if she would more than she'd
[1:00:15] defiled for a lifetime know how much no
[1:00:17] matter how much she's forgiven she can't
[1:00:19] be justified I'll strike that in a
[1:00:22] little bit not a scripture in a few
[1:00:23] minutes she can be forgiven for her
[1:00:25] defilement but she cannot be justified
[1:00:27] in this life you understand what I'm
[1:00:28] talking about you cannot turn a virgin
[1:00:30] back
[1:00:32] if she was a virgin she went out and had
[1:00:34] an act
[1:00:35] she can't be restored and ever say she
[1:00:37] was a virgin again does everybody
[1:00:38] understand that
[1:00:39] right same way with the male male's the
[1:00:42] same way male's got a virgin emergency
[1:00:43] too
[1:00:45] but she's entrusted with one because
[1:00:46] she's got to bring human life through
[1:00:48] through that vessel everybody understand
[1:00:51] her body is giving her it's not wait got
[1:00:53] a scripture on that but she cannot be
[1:00:55] justified in this life it's always
[1:00:56] weather notice now she's been given this
[1:00:59] she may be forgiven so he can be
[1:01:01] forgiven but you can't be justified in
[1:01:03] other words you can't come up to a man
[1:01:05] after you've been defiled you can't come
[1:01:07] up to a man that you really want to
[1:01:09] marry and say honey I'm a virgin
[1:01:11] and you're not you can't that can't be
[1:01:13] restored back that's what he's talking
[1:01:14] about this is all in the natural he's
[1:01:16] come back she can be forgiven but not be
[1:01:18] justified in what she's doing her body's
[1:01:21] giving her a sacred Trust From God no
[1:01:22] female dog no bird no other animal no
[1:01:24] other creature like that no she is the
[1:01:26] only one buy it she is the reason it's
[1:01:29] so sacred she is to bring forth life
[1:01:31] into the Earth her body is abandoned
[1:01:35] ground of life right
[1:01:38] Banning ground of life
[1:01:40] therefore that's the reason she is given
[1:01:42] this sacred trust and here's where you
[1:01:44] may disagree with theologians but that's
[1:01:46] what defiled the whole human race is
[1:01:47] that adultery in the beginning her
[1:01:50] bedding ground was smart she brought
[1:01:52] fourth twins came the name but one act
[1:01:54] two children search the scripture all
[1:01:56] right now
[1:01:57] let's go to Galatians 6 be not deceived
[1:02:01] God is Not mocked whatsoever a man
[1:02:03] sowing
[1:02:04] not showing also read for he to soweth
[1:02:07] to his flesh shall of the flesh reap
[1:02:10] corruption always
[1:02:13] I'm not trying to change scripture but
[1:02:15] always right you reap to the flesh
[1:02:17] you'll always going to read correction
[1:02:19] because what this flesh is corruption
[1:02:21] but he that saw it to the spirit shall
[1:02:23] of the spirit re life
[1:02:25] Everlasting I love that scripture some
[1:02:27] of you children you may want to keep
[1:02:29] these things and keep them in your keep
[1:02:31] them in your Bible or keep them
[1:02:33] um if I was a young guy growing up now
[1:02:35] and I was in church I would post these
[1:02:38] all over my uh car and and all over my
[1:02:42] uh bedroom and wherever just to remind
[1:02:44] me
[1:02:46] and God's telling us something here
[1:02:48] because once we're defiled we're defiled
[1:02:51] you can be forgiven there is Grace
[1:02:52] that's what we're going to talk about
[1:02:53] right here there is Grace
[1:02:56] so any of you males or females that's
[1:02:59] been in here that that have that have
[1:03:01] not done right and been defiled there is
[1:03:03] Grace but there's certain things that
[1:03:04] you can and cannot do right right Isaiah
[1:03:07] 118 says come down and let us reason
[1:03:09] together saith the Lord though your sins
[1:03:11] be a Scarlet there's only one sin that
[1:03:13] can't be forgiven and that's blasphemy
[1:03:15] right yeah brother Brown said many times
[1:03:17] the prostitute had been turned into a
[1:03:19] Christian woman but now remember she
[1:03:21] can't walk up to a man and say I'm a
[1:03:22] virgin
[1:03:23] she can't marry a preacher
[1:03:26] yeah surf like that but she can be a
[1:03:29] Christian woman or a Christian man don't
[1:03:31] let it be so shameful that you can't be
[1:03:34] saved or Satan will say ah you you're
[1:03:36] all ready to fall yeah it might be
[1:03:37] defiled because of you buddy
[1:03:40] Satan
[1:03:41] but I got that scripture right there
[1:03:43] though your sins be a Scarlet they
[1:03:45] should be as wide as snow don't they be
[1:03:47] red like Crimson they shall be as well
[1:03:49] that's what God says about us
[1:03:51] if you're truly forgiven you're forgiven
[1:03:54] all right man but I can't remember it
[1:03:56] but you're going to remember and you're
[1:03:57] going to live with it that's why I say
[1:03:59] children
[1:04:00] don't go in this the way that some of us
[1:04:02] have went because you're going to
[1:04:04] remember and it's going to haunt you for
[1:04:05] the rest of your life
[1:04:11] Satan has that one little thing he can
[1:04:13] sit there and he pound you with don't do
[1:04:16] it and you know what you can walk up and
[1:04:17] say
[1:04:18] Neville I might do a lot of other things
[1:04:20] but that's not I'm not going to follow
[1:04:22] my body my body's going to stay yes a
[1:04:24] temple of the Holy Ghost right all right
[1:04:26] if we confess our sins he is faithful
[1:04:30] and just
[1:04:32] to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us
[1:04:36] from anything that we did that went
[1:04:38] right is that what he says and cleanse
[1:04:40] us from all
[1:04:42] all means all in God
[1:04:44] he heals all of our diseases brother
[1:04:46] Eddie there's none of disease God can't
[1:04:47] I can't heal from there's not a sin that
[1:04:49] God can't make us righteous except for
[1:04:52] blasphemy we're not talking about that
[1:04:54] we're talking about the grace of
[1:04:56] almighty God we know about the grace of
[1:04:58] marriage and divorce but you know what I
[1:04:59] like what daddy said the other Sunday
[1:05:01] when we were gone I was listening to
[1:05:02] that the other day it's not the grace of
[1:05:04] marriage and divorce it's the Grace from
[1:05:05] marriage and divorce yeah from it yeah
[1:05:10] the grace run
[1:05:12] marriage and divorce because some people
[1:05:15] don't have a natural marriage and
[1:05:17] divorce problems right
[1:05:18] if you've never even defend divorced you
[1:05:20] can just say I never had a marriage
[1:05:21] problem you understand
[1:05:23] if y'all if your husband's dead you
[1:05:25] marry again
[1:05:26] if you've never been married to anybody
[1:05:29] you don't have you you don't have to
[1:05:31] have the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:05:33] for a lot of the human things you do or
[1:05:35] if your wife went out and committed
[1:05:36] adultery you put her away and marry
[1:05:38] again right amen and be not covered
[1:05:41] under the grace of marriage and divorce
[1:05:43] that's covered I don't know what the
[1:05:44] Bible tells you to be good right
[1:05:45] gracious marriage and divorces for
[1:05:47] something you've already done wrong
[1:05:50] and God gives you Grace for that all
[1:05:52] right Grace from the what the law of
[1:05:56] marriage and divorce all right everybody
[1:05:58] understand I hope you got that that was
[1:05:59] really good a couple Sundays ago of
[1:06:02] course good every Sunday but that was a
[1:06:04] good one right just one little word
[1:06:05] Grace from
[1:06:07] Grace from marriage in divorce
[1:06:09] you take that Grace from that and then
[1:06:11] you go on as you are don't do it anymore

[1:06:15] we can do on don't on dudes

[1:10:48] this is where I should be do make church
[1:10:52] Sunday school and bible study priority
[1:10:53] not an option amen right right not an
[1:10:56] option make it a priority that we stay
[1:10:59] in church we stayed in Sunday school we
[1:11:03] stay in Bible study we do these things
[1:11:05] together
[1:11:07] um you know I just
[1:11:08] uh Gabby and and Ryan just
[1:11:12] to me they make I don't know I can't
[1:11:14] explain it I just enjoy them seeing them
[1:11:17] together
[1:11:18] I enjoyed seeing them together remember
[1:11:20] you I have a hard time seeing us
[1:11:23] Ryan and Gabby they come to uh they come
[1:11:26] Sunday still they're there whether their
[1:11:29] kids are screaming or not
[1:11:31] you know they don't make an excuse you
[1:11:33] understand what I'm saying they don't
[1:11:34] make an excuse to be a bible study on on
[1:11:36] Saturday night one Saturday night a
[1:11:38] month one Saturday night a month they're
[1:11:41] always saying even when they first got
[1:11:43] married and didn't have children all the
[1:11:45] way up
[1:11:46] right yeah you know why because it's a
[1:11:49] priority to them not an option right
[1:11:53] same way with you and I should be a
[1:11:55] priority not an option right
[1:11:58] because I need you know the Bible said I
[1:12:00] was telling about Richard now
[1:12:02] in Tennessee last weekend the Bible says
[1:12:05] for sake not the symbol of himself
[1:12:07] together well now we say well you need
[1:12:08] to be in church that's right but read
[1:12:09] the rest of it he says and more
[1:12:12] right right
[1:12:13] we must not be looking for the day to
[1:12:15] approach
[1:12:17] the way we miss church around here and
[1:12:19] everywhere else they haven't every it's
[1:12:20] not in this church it's in every other
[1:12:21] church too
[1:12:24] and more the Bible says as the day
[1:12:26] approaches
[1:12:29] so in other words if you missed
[1:12:32] Church 30 times last year you ought to
[1:12:36] just miss it 20 this year do you want to
[1:12:38] miss
[1:12:38] right I mean let's just be human about
[1:12:40] this thing he says and more
[1:12:43] the Bible says and more as the day
[1:12:45] approach it right come together right
[1:12:47] come in because hey what did I read you
[1:12:50] what brother Brown said the other day we
[1:12:52] were talking about um who shall declare
[1:12:54] his generation brother Brown said
[1:12:56] you can't get stronger in miss church
[1:12:59] remember the prophet said that now if
[1:13:02] you're if you're that way you can just
[1:13:04] get mad at him not me all right all
[1:13:06] right because brother Brown said you
[1:13:08] miss church you will get weaker right
[1:13:10] right right you will get weaker so
[1:13:13] you're getting weaker if you miss church
[1:13:14] don't even look around nobody else Lose
[1:13:16] Yourself right I am getting weaker
[1:13:18] that's what you probably said so we'll
[1:13:21] just you know y'all don't talk to him
[1:13:22] about it
[1:13:23] all right
[1:13:25] all right let's go now to marriage we've
[1:13:28] got about 15 minutes and 32 pages left
[1:13:32] now when we get married listen first
[1:13:34] Peter 3 1 7 likewise you wise being
[1:13:37] subjecting to your own husbands
[1:13:39] if any obey not the word they also may
[1:13:41] be without the word being won by the
[1:13:43] conversation of the wives right let's
[1:13:45] just stop right there and save time
[1:13:47] let's go to number 30.
[1:13:50] and we'll talk about the Battle here
[1:13:52] just for a second
[1:13:54] go to the next one brother Anderson
[1:13:56] thank you numbers 30 verse 2-5 the man
[1:13:59] battle to the Lord and swearing oath to
[1:14:01] bind his soul with a bind he shall not
[1:14:04] break his word he shall do according to
[1:14:05] all that proceedeth out of his mouth if
[1:14:08] a woman also bow bow into the Lord and
[1:14:10] bind herself by a bond being in her
[1:14:12] father's house in her Youth and her
[1:14:14] father hear her vow and her bond for
[1:14:16] which she has bound her soul her father
[1:14:17] shall hold his peace in her
[1:14:20] then all her vows shall stand and Never
[1:14:22] Bound for when she was bound her soul
[1:14:24] she'll stand we'll explain this in just
[1:14:26] a second but if her father disallows her
[1:14:28] and the day that he hear it not any of
[1:14:31] her vows or any of her bonds for which
[1:14:33] she has bound her soul shall stand and
[1:14:36] the Lord shall forgive her because her
[1:14:38] father disallowed
[1:14:41] reason being
[1:14:43] just like brother Brown did with his
[1:14:44] child
[1:14:46] the two sisters a few vowels and say yes
[1:14:48] I'll marry that boy and and the father
[1:14:51] you come and tell the father that day
[1:14:54] if he see something wrong with this
[1:14:56] situation he can say uh
[1:14:58] no that that won't happen because
[1:15:00] remember your father is your Holy Ghost
[1:15:02] until you get the Holy Ghost right your
[1:15:04] father's your head until you become
[1:15:06] under the headship of your natural
[1:15:08] husband everybody understand that right
[1:15:10] so you fathers you can you can look at
[1:15:13] this situation and you can say no
[1:15:17] and that would make her where her vowel
[1:15:19] wouldn't stand and she's okay because
[1:15:20] she's protected by you right right if
[1:15:24] you say no you can't marry that boy and
[1:15:26] she's already said it
[1:15:28] now she may go on and do it but you've
[1:15:31] told him no right because of a certain
[1:15:33] situation if you disallowed in the day
[1:15:35] now not six months later when you find
[1:15:37] out he might have a problem all right or
[1:15:39] he sorry and can't work and all these
[1:15:41] other things you can't say no no you
[1:15:43] gotta you gotta look that have spiritual
[1:15:45] eyes and you know what to me that to me
[1:15:48] that's Grace
[1:15:49] that's the grace of God that you can do
[1:15:52] that right and be clean because look and
[1:15:55] the Lord shall forgive her right
[1:15:58] right in other words like it never
[1:16:00] happened right
[1:16:03] right take this into spiritual
[1:16:05] there's a lot of battles we made in this
[1:16:07] in our spiritual life right
[1:16:09] God hears it and disallows it that's the
[1:16:12] only way we can be forgiven is our
[1:16:13] father Our Father
[1:16:16] our vows right there's a lot of things
[1:16:19] we bound to do out in the world that's
[1:16:20] right that we've got real bad shape over
[1:16:23] yeah but God disallowed when he give you
[1:16:27] the baptism of the Holy Ghost he
[1:16:28] disallowed along their mouths right okay
[1:16:31] so we can go spiritual with that too but
[1:16:33] let's say in our natural because that's
[1:16:34] a good thing for for the for the girls
[1:16:36] to know that that uh if the father says
[1:16:39] no Then You're not bound to that guy
[1:16:42] right because he makes you something you
[1:16:43] don't see
[1:16:44] right right he may see something you
[1:16:47] don't see and then if you take
[1:16:49] correction and say hey I'm sorry then
[1:16:51] you're not bound to that guy it's not
[1:16:53] that you vowed that you're going to
[1:16:54] marry him and you're stuck
[1:16:56] I think that's great right I think
[1:16:58] that's wonderful that God put that in
[1:17:00] there Deuteronomy 23 21.
[1:17:04] when thou shalt bow into the Lord thy
[1:17:06] God Thou shalt not slack to pay it for
[1:17:08] the Lord thy God will surely require it
[1:17:10] of thee and it would be sin in me so if
[1:17:13] you vow vow into the Lord and you're
[1:17:15] gonna stick to it you better not be
[1:17:17] slack about it you pay that amount
[1:17:20] you're going to marry that boy you're
[1:17:21] going to marry that girl you better do
[1:17:23] it Genesis two and the Lord God formed
[1:17:25] man of the Dust of the ground and
[1:17:26] breathing in his Knoxville is the breath
[1:17:28] of life and Man became a living soul
[1:17:31] now why did he just keep doing that
[1:17:34] we'll get to that in the family part
[1:17:35] brother Brown asked that question why
[1:17:37] didn't God just keep doing that why'd he
[1:17:39] just keep making it Out of the Dust of
[1:17:41] the Earth
[1:17:42] he was a father
[1:17:45] he wanted Adam to be a father
[1:17:48] he wanted a family
[1:17:50] Adam and Eve made the family we'll get
[1:17:53] into that in just a second or maybe this
[1:17:55] afternoon
[1:17:56] Genesis 2 18. listen this and Lord God
[1:17:58] said it is not good that man should be
[1:18:00] alone I will make him and help meat for
[1:18:03] him now we'll get into that in just a
[1:18:05] second we got a definition for that
[1:18:06] remember
[1:18:07] laughs
[1:18:08] and out of the ground the Lord formed
[1:18:10] every beast of the field every foul
[1:18:12] there and brought him unto Adam to see
[1:18:13] what he would call him whatsoever Adam
[1:18:15] called every living creature that was
[1:18:17] the name thereof
[1:18:19] and Adam gave names to all the cattle
[1:18:20] now remember he made male and female
[1:18:22] cows he made male and female horses male
[1:18:24] and female dogs right Adam give them you
[1:18:27] know give them their name
[1:18:28] and Adam gave names for all cattle for
[1:18:30] all the air never beast of the field but
[1:18:32] for Adam
[1:18:33] it was not fail to help me for him and
[1:18:36] the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall
[1:18:38] upon Adam and he slept and he took one
[1:18:39] of his ribs and closed the flesh instead
[1:18:41] thereof and the rib which the Lord God
[1:18:43] had taken from man made he a woman and
[1:18:45] brought her unto the man and Adam said
[1:18:47] this is now bone of my bones
[1:18:49] and Flesh of My Flesh and she shall be
[1:18:52] called woman
[1:18:53] because she was taken out a man what is
[1:18:55] what is the word woman it's man with a
[1:18:57] womb right right woman Whoa man
[1:19:02] all right she was a woman she was a man
[1:19:04] with a womb because she was taken out of
[1:19:06] Adam therefore shall a man leave his
[1:19:08] father and mother and shall cleave unto
[1:19:10] his wife and they shall be one flesh now
[1:19:13] listen that's what I said before in the
[1:19:15] end time sister Collins now they're
[1:19:17] leaving their life and cleaving to their
[1:19:20] father and mother they're all moving
[1:19:21] back home now yeah
[1:19:23] now you're married until you die right
[1:19:26] you leave your father and mother and
[1:19:28] cleave be your wife don't leave your
[1:19:30] wife and cleave your parents again all
[1:19:32] right
[1:19:33] that's not what God intended all right
[1:19:35] now
[1:19:37] next
[1:19:39] with God through reconciliation
[1:19:41] the prophet said but God laid down a
[1:19:43] program in the oh God had a plan
[1:19:46] wow God had a plan but God laid down a
[1:19:51] program in the beginning how that man
[1:19:52] can have Fellowship one with another
[1:19:54] yeah
[1:19:55] and we'll have to come to God's terms on
[1:19:58] that that's all
[1:19:59] you got to come to God's term that's
[1:20:00] what he wanted AI in the beginning when
[1:20:03] man used to walk in the early ages with
[1:20:04] God in the Garden of Eden when the first
[1:20:06] Man was created in the great Cathedral
[1:20:08] Cathedrals Under The Palms he and his
[1:20:10] wife went in the cool of the evening
[1:20:12] come along they came out and worshiped
[1:20:13] God had a perfect Fellowship God Longs
[1:20:16] for Fellowship he yearns he wants people
[1:20:19] to speak with him to talk with him all
[1:20:21] right let's go to the next one now
[1:20:23] you'll never be able to have too much
[1:20:25] fellowship with God and God Longs for
[1:20:27] his creature who he created in His image
[1:20:30] to fellowship with him wouldn't you
[1:20:32] loved and lived in that time when the
[1:20:34] Great Fellowship
[1:20:35] God had with Adam and Eve in the Garden
[1:20:37] of Eden could come down in the cool
[1:20:38] evening and talk with him and fellowship
[1:20:40] with him wouldn't that be marvelous we
[1:20:42] all would like to have that time now I
[1:20:45] Believe by God's word I can prove to you
[1:20:46] that we can come right back let me read
[1:20:49] this again
[1:20:50] now I Believe by God's word I can prove
[1:20:53] to you that we can come right back on
[1:20:55] them terms again with God
[1:20:58] tonight tonight
[1:21:01] he brought it from Adam and Eve to the
[1:21:04] very present day he was preaching
[1:21:05] tonight right straight back to that kind
[1:21:09] of Fellowship amen right now here's the
[1:21:14] first Covenant we'll get into that and
[1:21:16] just right here because the first
[1:21:17] Covenant God made was what
[1:21:19] God said Genesis 2 15 18. the Lord God
[1:21:22] took the man
[1:21:23] and put him in the garden of Eden's
[1:21:25] address and keep it and the Lord God
[1:21:26] commanded the man saying of every tree
[1:21:28] of the garden thou mayest free to eat
[1:21:30] now where was he
[1:21:32] where was woman inside of Adam when God
[1:21:34] told him this right
[1:21:36] he hadn't separated them yet she was
[1:21:38] still inside of him right and the Lord
[1:21:41] God commanded the man saying of every
[1:21:43] tree in the garden thy man is freely eat
[1:21:44] but of the tree of the knowledge of Good
[1:21:46] and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in
[1:21:48] the day that thou eat us thereof Thou
[1:21:50] shalt surely die
[1:21:52] and then what God say and then God said
[1:21:54] it's not good that a man should be alone
[1:21:56] I will make him and help me for him he
[1:21:58] goes on and tells him here's the
[1:21:59] Covenant you do this
[1:22:01] you'll live you don't do this you'll die
[1:22:04] right that's the first Covenant right
[1:22:06] we'll end right here on this one where
[1:22:10] the fellowship was broken
[1:22:12] remember what happened we know what
[1:22:14] happened in the garden I don't have to
[1:22:15] read now Genesis 3 14 and the Lord God
[1:22:17] said unto the serpent
[1:22:20] cursed above all cattle
[1:22:22] and above every beast of the field upon
[1:22:24] thy belly shalt thou on go and thus
[1:22:26] shall they eat all the Days of Our Lives
[1:22:27] now here's where the fellowship was
[1:22:29] broken and now we'll put enmity between
[1:22:31] thee and the woman
[1:22:33] enmity is division
[1:22:35] God was separating us from him right
[1:22:39] no Fellowship like it used to be God
[1:22:40] couldn't come down in the cool of the
[1:22:42] evening
[1:22:42] and fellowship with him anymore because
[1:22:44] we're reading just a few minutes
[1:22:46] what this new covenant contains and I
[1:22:50] will put enmity between thee and the
[1:22:51] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:22:53] he shall breathe thy head and thou shalt
[1:22:55] bruises heal see that covers the whole
[1:22:57] Plan of Redemption there but that's what
[1:22:59] he done for man he stopped the
[1:23:01] fellowship
[1:23:02] that they used to have
[1:23:04] before this fall now Genesis 3 16.
[1:23:09] here's where the New Covenant comes in
[1:23:11] all right until the woman he said I
[1:23:13] would greatly multiply I sorrow my
[1:23:15] conception see because we have to cover
[1:23:17] this
[1:23:19] for those of you that were here before
[1:23:23] we've always heard brother Brown talk
[1:23:24] about what the woman did and what the
[1:23:26] man did and why the woman was this part
[1:23:28] and a man with this part right
[1:23:30] but I've always been somebody remember
[1:23:32] what what did I tell you I've always
[1:23:33] been the kind of person I want to know
[1:23:35] the why
[1:23:37] why
[1:23:39] has a woman got to be under suggestion
[1:23:41] to a man why is a man gonna act like he
[1:23:43] acts why is a woman gonna act why is
[1:23:45] that electricity work like he does you
[1:23:47] understand from back what we're talking
[1:23:49] about why because I'll have no fear and
[1:23:52] I'll know how to handle things if I
[1:23:53] understand it better all right I just
[1:23:55] don't want and don't get me wrong I just
[1:23:57] don't want the profit to tell me do's
[1:24:00] and don'ts
[1:24:02] right right right
[1:24:03] this message is not do's and don'ts amen
[1:24:07] right right this message was Grace it
[1:24:10] was brought there are things inside
[1:24:12] there that we shouldn't do and he tells
[1:24:15] us what we should do and shouldn't do
[1:24:16] just like I'm telling you that but I
[1:24:17] want to know the wine
[1:24:19] because the why is the revelation
[1:24:22] there's Seven Seals broke right I want
[1:24:25] to know why not that they well they just
[1:24:28] broke it was time for it well why why
[1:24:30] why did it break what's the purpose
[1:24:33] behind it breaking what's the purpose
[1:24:35] what has it got to do with me right all
[1:24:37] right same thing with this until the
[1:24:40] woman he said I would greatly multiply
[1:24:41] that I sorrow my conception and sorrow
[1:24:43] Thou shalt bring forth children so here
[1:24:45] children is going to be brought in in
[1:24:48] this way in sorrow and in conception and
[1:24:51] thy desire shall be to thy husband and
[1:24:53] he shall rule over thee
[1:25:01] the voice of my life
[1:25:03] and after eating of the three of which I
[1:25:05] commanded thee saying Thou shalt not eat
[1:25:06] cursed is the ground for thy sake right
[1:25:09] right sorrow thou shall eat of it all
[1:25:11] the days of thy lives Thorns also in
[1:25:13] thistle shall they bring forth to thee
[1:25:15] and thou shalt eat the herds of the
[1:25:16] field
[1:25:17] in a sweat of my face shall thou eat
[1:25:19] bread till thou return us to the ground
[1:25:21] for out of it was now taken for dust
[1:25:23] Thou Art
[1:25:25] yes
[1:25:26] Thou shalt return
[1:25:28] all right
[1:25:31] let's go to number 12. we'll kind of
[1:25:34] stuff right here and pick us up this
[1:25:35] afternoon
[1:25:37] imagine divorce here we see brother
[1:25:40] Brown says two Covenants
[1:25:41] now that closes the beginning of what
[1:25:44] Jesus said it wasn't so at the beginning
[1:25:46] when Jesus told those those Pharisees it
[1:25:48] wasn't so from the beginning he's
[1:25:50] talking about the beginning
[1:25:52] before there was a fall right right when
[1:25:55] man and woman one man one woman right
[1:25:59] right but now we have two Covenants
[1:26:02] the Covenant that they broke and now
[1:26:04] second Covenant that they come under
[1:26:06] that God's telling them what to do we
[1:26:08] got another Covenant now notice it's
[1:26:10] another Covenant and there's a covenant
[1:26:12] for the product
[1:26:13] and the byproduct because remember they
[1:26:16] were the same under the first Covenant
[1:26:17] right
[1:26:18] so why does a woman have well she was in
[1:26:21] the fall she had she did
[1:26:23] I gotta know a little more than that
[1:26:26] the fall brought trouble death to every
[1:26:28] creature of the creation making a
[1:26:31] difference in all nature
[1:26:33] now let us notice what Jesus said about
[1:26:35] it from the beginning it was the soul
[1:26:36] now it is not so from
[1:26:40] and it's now it is after the beginning
[1:26:42] see that it is now it is after the
[1:26:45] beginning and there is a double Covenant
[1:26:47] first was just the Covenant Adam and Eve
[1:26:50] was co-lequal does everybody understand
[1:26:51] that Adam and Eve before the fall there
[1:26:53] was no this and then they were co-equal
[1:26:57] co-equal because that's what we're
[1:26:58] coming back to co-equal
[1:27:01] remember the Bible says word heirs and
[1:27:03] join heirs with Christ right right all
[1:27:06] right so now now the world first first
[1:27:09] was just the Covenant Adam and Eve of
[1:27:10] co-equal one man one woman now the woman
[1:27:13] sinned and what does she do that threw
[1:27:15] them all to death because remember Adam
[1:27:18] could have said no
[1:27:19] he took on her sin right
[1:27:23] all right we'll talk about that a little
[1:27:25] later now the woman's saying that throw
[1:27:28] them all to death and God had to make a
[1:27:29] covenant buy that another Covenant here
[1:27:32] it is here in Genesis 3 16 he made
[1:27:33] another Covenant now the world is to be
[1:27:36] repopulated not by the regional creation
[1:27:38] of God like in the beginning not by the
[1:27:41] original creation but by sex desire now
[1:27:43] that takes care of the beginning doesn't
[1:27:45] it because we were all supposed to be
[1:27:46] word-born children right yeah right
[1:27:50] right spoken word children
[1:27:52] not sex never was supposed to be sex
[1:27:55] right folks have been spoken word all
[1:27:57] right
[1:27:58] Michael that's the way we're being born
[1:28:00] now spiritually we we're being born by
[1:28:03] the spoken word of God right
[1:28:05] amen the seed is not a natural seed of
[1:28:08] of sperm now it's it's the word is the
[1:28:11] seed
[1:28:12] that's right all right right here the
[1:28:14] word is the seed that will repopulate
[1:28:15] the Whirlwind now we're repopulating the
[1:28:18] World by sex desire out here
[1:28:21] but God's repopulating his world
[1:28:25] his people his children by the spoken
[1:28:28] word right man don't understand that
[1:28:30] right
[1:28:32] that's right men don't understand that
[1:28:34] they don't and they'd be born again
[1:28:35] because that's what it is right right
[1:28:38] please sample now the world is being
[1:28:41] repopulated not by the original creation
[1:28:42] of God like in the beginning not by the
[1:28:44] original creation but by sex desire now
[1:28:46] that takes care of the beginning doesn't
[1:28:48] it in the beginning there was only one
[1:28:50] man one woman one male one female and
[1:28:53] when she crossed that line and brought
[1:28:54] this sin now the world is being
[1:28:56] repopulated Again by sex not by creation
[1:28:59] my sex see where the woman is at now but
[1:29:02] that's the way the world is populated
[1:29:03] today through women that's the reason
[1:29:06] Jesus had to come through the woman
[1:29:07] right right to bring it back to its
[1:29:09] original beginning again without sex
[1:29:11] desire he is Virgin born but Hallelujah
[1:29:14] there will come a time where it won't be
[1:29:16] no more sex but God shall call his
[1:29:18] children from the dust of the Earth
[1:29:20] back like they was in the original not
[1:29:23] through any woman
[1:29:24] but through the molding of the clan the
[1:29:26] cosmic light and petroleum he will
[1:29:28] create again
[1:29:29] like he did Adam at the first time
[1:29:31] Jesus made this possible by giving God
[1:29:34] himself a man by God making himself a
[1:29:36] man and coming to the world so we could
[1:29:38] die through this woman now it's the
[1:29:40] testing Time by saying this is our
[1:29:42] testing time right here look at this all
[1:29:44] right number 13.
[1:29:46] now notice now after the beginning after
[1:29:48] the beginning After Time began back in
[1:29:50] that was The Eternity is is over in
[1:29:53] other words we're in time now notice
[1:29:55] after that fall was made by Eve after
[1:29:57] the fall there was need to be another
[1:29:58] covenant made now this is going to Stone
[1:30:01] with you but I'm going to give you
[1:30:02] scripture to prove that this is true now
[1:30:04] notice after the fall Jesus said God at
[1:30:06] the beginning made one of a kind but now
[1:30:08] after the fall now we're going beyond
[1:30:10] that the Covenant was co-equal but now
[1:30:13] after the fall there's another coming up
[1:30:14] made now she was no longer ruler with
[1:30:17] him
[1:30:19] each must have a separate Covenant right
[1:30:22] everybody understand that man now we're
[1:30:25] going to stop right there
[1:30:27] and that way I'll pick back up right
[1:30:29] here but what happens is now it's right
[1:30:31] at 12 o'clock now what you had Adam and
[1:30:34] Eve coequal
[1:30:37] now you've got what you've got Adam
[1:30:39] we're gonna read in Ephesians where what
[1:30:41] Christ is the head of the man man is the
[1:30:45] head of the woman right
[1:30:47] right
[1:30:49] but we're going to see that that's why
[1:30:51] it had to be that to bring us back to
[1:30:53] Redemption because it had to come
[1:30:55] through the woman
[1:30:57] that's how we all got here
[1:30:59] Jesus hadn't even come to a woman
[1:31:02] but it wasn't my Sexes all right was
[1:31:04] what be it unto me according to Thy Word
[1:31:08] the egg and The Germ was planted the
[1:31:10] baby came with no sex desire what
[1:31:12] creation spoken word remember he's the
[1:31:14] beginning of the creation of God right
[1:31:16] Jesus Christ was the beginning of the
[1:31:18] creation of God what the beginning is
[1:31:20] how it should have been had they not
[1:31:22] been a fall right my son
[1:31:25] we'll pick up right there this afternoon
[1:31:27] and go on to the man and the woman in
[1:31:29] the family does everybody understand now
[1:31:31] we're under the double Covenant the
[1:31:33] double Covenant you say well that puts a
[1:31:36] woman in a lower place no one puts her
[1:31:38] in a good place
[1:31:40] stay in your position
[1:31:42] hey where you're supposed to be yeah
[1:31:44] let's sing one song and then we'll then
[1:31:46] we will
[1:31:47] dismissed for for a little time and come
[1:31:50] back
[1:31:52] our second service
[1:31:54] you love the Lord amen I know this is
[1:31:56] kind of redundant but maybe kind of help
[1:31:58] I know I forget things so
[1:32:00] I have to get somebody to tell me that
[1:32:01] over again
[1:32:05] because some of you probably forgot some
[1:32:06] of these quotes because I did too
[1:32:08] looking back over and we're only human
[1:32:09] we only get so much that's why it took
[1:32:12] so long for God to get us where we're at
[1:32:14] because we have to hear things over and
[1:32:17] over again because we're human right
[1:32:18] there's nothing wrong with that
[1:32:21] you know what the problem is sometimes
[1:32:22] we don't make ourselves available for
[1:32:25] God to give us what he's already getting
[1:32:26] but he's already got it laid out there
[1:32:28] right the plan's already late the plan's
[1:32:30] done the plans finished
[1:32:32] we just got to come under that plan just
[1:32:34] like the woman had to come under the
[1:32:35] headship of the man we have to come
[1:32:37] under the headship of Christ's problem
[1:32:39] is
[1:32:40] probably is
[1:32:42] we still got a lot of females wanting to
[1:32:44] be males you know
[1:32:48] not a male's acting acting a female
[1:32:52] that's the way it is because brother
[1:32:53] Brown I'm gonna find it this afternoon
[1:32:55] I'm gonna find it back there but we miss
[1:32:57] it in the walk our walk right that's
[1:32:59] where we're missing it
[1:33:01] I've told you many times before and I'm
[1:33:03] going to tell you again forget about the
[1:33:05] seal if you're not born again right
[1:33:07] right forget about marriage and divorce
[1:33:09] and I'm telling Brother Richard Brother
[1:33:10] Richard Wilson now let me tell you this
[1:33:11] one thing let me tell you
[1:33:14] dad and I were talking about it there's
[1:33:16] not one period
[1:33:18] there's not one letter
[1:33:20] there's not one number
[1:33:22] of marriage and divorce should ever be
[1:33:24] spoken to anybody but born again
[1:33:25] Christian right ever never
[1:33:29] talk to nobody about it never it's not
[1:33:32] for those people right
[1:33:35] is for believers only
[1:33:39] like I said there's not a period
[1:33:42] and I'm and I'm saying this you know but
[1:33:44] the Bible says don't cast your pearls
[1:33:46] before swines all right why they'll eat
[1:33:49] them it doesn't no good
[1:33:52] you think you're being so spiritual
[1:33:53] forget it
[1:33:55] stop it
[1:33:57] it's only for born-again people
[1:34:01] only Brother Ray is that right that's
[1:34:05] strong enough don't talk about marriage
[1:34:08] and divorce to anybody
[1:34:11] they don't understand it you're just a
[1:34:13] stumbling block
[1:34:15] right what brother Dale's preaching
[1:34:17] shouldn't go out to the world
[1:34:19] they don't understand it amen he said
[1:34:22] this is to my people only right
[1:34:26] the people that believe this message so
[1:34:30] forget about it you're not doing anybody
[1:34:33] any good that's right by talking about
[1:34:35] marriage and divorce that's right you
[1:34:38] know don't ask me a question about ain't
[1:34:40] Sally is she all right no she's not
[1:34:43] because she ain't born again yeah
[1:34:45] that's what makes her not right right
[1:34:47] get born again then we talk about all
[1:34:49] these other things right I mean get born
[1:34:52] again let's do the primer thing let's
[1:34:55] walk into a building and people know
[1:34:57] that we're a Christian amen let's walk
[1:34:59] into our office and people know that
[1:35:00] you're a Christian right right walk into
[1:35:02] your everyday Walk of Life they say
[1:35:04] that's a Christian right
[1:35:06] right praise God they may not like my
[1:35:09] father as him as other siblings but they
[1:35:12] know he's a Christian that's right right
[1:35:14] and they'll tell you that he practices
[1:35:16] what he believes now they may not can
[1:35:20] say that about his other brother that's
[1:35:21] a preacher his other brothers it profess
[1:35:23] Christianity but they say it about that
[1:35:24] man why because he's walked in front of
[1:35:26] them
[1:35:29] to me that's the most that's more
[1:35:31] powerful than than knowing what seal
[1:35:34] number four is yeah
[1:35:35] right right exactly because it's it's
[1:35:38] what we project right the only God
[1:35:42] they're ever going to see is us
[1:35:46] so quit walking the line
[1:35:49] all of us stay away
[1:35:51] let our conversation be clean right
[1:35:54] always not just every once in a while
[1:35:56] yeah
[1:35:57] not just every once in a while right
[1:36:00] always
[1:36:01] we come down to the time where
[1:36:04] I know we get we have to be forgiven
[1:36:07] every day yeah
[1:36:08] but there should be some little things
[1:36:09] that we're still doing
[1:36:11] that ought to be done
[1:36:13] buried you know what the problem is
[1:36:15] they're not dead that's right
[1:36:18] you're not dead you just divorced them
[1:36:21] you just left one church and come to
[1:36:23] this one yeah you just divorced it put
[1:36:25] it over here somewhere
[1:36:26] but remember
[1:36:28] somewhere down the line
[1:36:30] it'll raise us ugly head up right sure
[1:36:33] but if you kill it
[1:36:36] it don't resurrect don't think
[1:36:38] resurrections Christians right not
[1:36:40] Sinners sure they'll resurrect later on
