father you have a father so either way happy Father's Day to somebody even though you're not a father okay I don't do that no more I don't read comic books that's of the devil but anyway now they come in our paper now and they're so distorted you can't read them so I don't know whether they're don't think I mean you can't hardly read you look at them you think man if I drunk something before are the papers moving you know cuz it's all double so I just forget it I don't worry about I figure if I need to know something something like don't tell me later on but I can't read that but happy Father's Day to all the to all the fathers a few announcements number ones like June sister June said the sisters who's happily going camping fishes are having a pity party they're having salad and a pizza and they're going to drown in their sorrow but most of them are gonna be happy that we're leaving I think this is like some kind of a hidden revelation hmm where they have a sad countenance until we leave huh no you didn't but you don't have to honey I agree between your line I bet made you almost 40 years I know what this is all about this is the happy time the farewell wave will signal our pitiful commencement Terence didn't read that part the farewell wave will signal our pitiful commencement I think that means the less party when they are gone okay all right yeah so anyway but we're gonna go have some hey listen there's 22 of us leaving today and eight coming to Mars like 30 people that's coming so that's just wonderful I I am tickled pink if two more comes we're going to find another place to put everybody because with 32 peoples all we reserve for space for us though good to be in the House of Lords we would turn to book of revelation 6 also I didn't know abut know about Olivia taking pictures but as soon as the service is over we have to get all this food and supplies in the church van or in dad's truck or in somebody's car so would everybody please help so we can get it done we've got to be up there by 4:15 so we got to hurry it'll be 45 minutes from here does anybody need directions you should have got your packet if not Jose can you still got one does anybody need one nobody needs one okay don't worry about them all right so remember now those of you that are coming tomorrow night it's cabin number seven you remember that that's a good number cabin number seven at 6:30 now I'm gonna explain one more time I explained what the Lowcountry ball was several weeks ago but obviously some don't listen a Low Country boil is we take and boil Low Country boil we take and boil shrimp crawfish crab legs andouille or those of you that don't know what I'm doing is that sausage hot sausage we didn't get the hot sausage we got the mild red potatoes corn on the cob onions and we put a little bit of lemon juice in there but anyway we boil it and cook it all together and then all you do is just scoop it out of the scoop it out of the pot pour it out on the table and eat that's a Lowcountry ball not a London brawl London broil is good but like Richard Robert said run London broil is good for one thing that's make beef jerky on it that's about it and also remember what the ones that are going up we need to get in our cars and get out of here as quick as we can but I'm gonna go get the tents I mean get the things rented some of you gonna stop and get license if you're over 16 you've got to have a Georgia fishing license 16 and older yes if you are 16 you have to have a fishing license don't embarrass us by not having fishing license you don't embarrass yourself you embarrass all of us but there is a store once you turn to go to to glow state park there is a store right there that sells fishing license and supplies and all that other stuff so remember that also remember we're going to do something little bit different this year I'm announcing that real early camp meeting we used to go up on Friday night to the camp meeting at Terrence announced in August we are going up on Thursday men June and mom and brother Dale and brother Danny del mundo is gonna be here Wednesday night we're gonna carry him up and we're gonna spend the night Thursday night and be there Thursday and Friday and come back Friday evening so if you want to go on Friday you'll have to make your own arrangements to go or you can go up over there on Thursday but we got rooms at the Holiday Inn for us if you'd like to come we'd love to have you but it's gonna be a little bit different usually we go up on Friday and come back but we will be going up on Thursday and coming back on Friday so all right all mine's clear I know you remembered every bit of that mmm revelation 6 verse 5 and I titled this one a little I guess it's themed attic but I didn't put Father's Day as the Father's Day that's what we're under now we're in the Father's Day now remember we're going to where Jesus says sit on my throne as I said on my Father's throne that we ain't got to that yet that's coming up but we're on the father's part of of what comes remember what is the prayer our Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be done so we're under that father's day not a 24-hour day or a day to day on Sunday were under H we're under a 2000 year day of the father that this is what he wanted had there not been a fall is that all right the man so let's bow our heads do how many father we praise you be with us today in what we have to say and what we have to hear father you do the speaking you do the hearing Lord you're the only one that can reveal and without you being here today Lord truly it's just time to greet meet but no we're not doing that today we believe that this is eternal life and that you gave it to us freely we pray this should be with us now Lord at this whole time but we're going to take off for the father's day trip Lord we pray that you'd be with the ones that are having to travel to get there Lord that we have a good time in you Lord just be were the ones that are sick the ones that are not with us be with the missionaries give them blessings on the foreign fields be with the missionaries just coming in in July on August Lord just be with them take care of them so I'm going to be here Lord but we'll meet some at the camp Lord father we pray Lord hasten the day that we don't have to leave that we can all just assemble together and all be one in you here Lord and just be able to enjoy each other for millions and millions of years what no time but as we do depart Lord we pray today that you'd be with each one father just take care of us until we meet again Jesus name we pray amen and when he had opened the third seal now look we're talking about a black horse and man we've been talking about a black horse now I told him down in a Sunday School class we hit the ground running this morning buddy I'm telling you I did a they asked me to do a Brotherhood meeting at the Methodist Church this morning at 7:30 so I've been up since 7:00 seven o'clock this morning doing the Brotherhood meeting for some Baptists in some Methodists so they they got a little bit of what I'm gonna talk about today but but I was thinking you know you we're talking about death last Sunday must be dead right must be dead something had to die but in us we see that not something has to die something yes has to die but then there's life after that it's not death death death and death but it is to somebody that doesn't have the word it is to somebody that doesn't have life and not talking about the human life we're talking about the life that God give us and then so we're trying to take this black horse and show that it that there is a blackness in the land no doubt gross darkness the Bible says the people all right gross darkness the people not not just not just you know around the world it's in the people that's what the darkness is because we were talking about if not if that light and you be darkness how great is the darkness you're soakin see I've so deceived until you think what you've got is light but it's not and then I'll be holding the law of black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand and heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny see thou hurt not the oil and the wine you may be seated in the Lord that is blessing to the reading of the word now what kind of background a little bit but I do want to cover something about this seal will not use the not used to drawing today because we just want to talk a little bit about something about the father because remember what did Jesus come to do he said I come to declare the Father okay you've seen me you've seen the father I and my father are one hey we got many scriptures that we're going to go over here all there's 854 times in the Bible that it talks about a father not father's or anything that father just father 854 times and 300 of those I think's in the New Testament so Jesus never spoke of himself remember he always spoke of the father all right so what did he do he come to declare the Father well now what are you and I to do we're not the father we're not the son of Jesus that son of the father right because remember we're heirs and joint heirs whatever he got we got alright so now let's look in see let's go and pull up with talking about Redemption now I was telling the Sunday School class downstairs you know Paul and Romans he concluded everyone dead everyone dead in sin everyone is everyone is on the same level and you know what I like that you saw no I like that because we're all of us on the same playing field we all got the same opportunity Judas me Adolf Hitler same opportunity we're all on the same level and to me that shows then the plan of redemption there is no redemption and realizing that you always was there's no redemptive quality I shout because God took me from being a sinner and made me a saint by the power as we're going to look at a little bit later the power of transformation our metaphor metamorphosis and then well the name we're going to get the name in the minutes Metamorpho that's taking an ugly caterpillar that always had the bug in I always had the butterfly inside you just couldn't see it but it always has the ability by being a caterpillar it always had the ability to be a butterfly if he did one thing eat one thing he had to eat and he eat his way into being a butterfly amen so that's the same way with you and I take an old ugly caterpillar like us a wretched sinner like us but yeah we did everybody that's what I love everybody in the world has the same opportunity everybody no one this born of a woman can get up one day in the white throne judgment and say God you can't do this because of this no way then we can all say that then we can all go up to the throne and have our little copy of all the things you know well you made me do this and you know no like I said before the only thing that they're going to the white throne judgment with is their works and that's it not of not God is not going to have a list of you did this good this day this no you turned me down you are an unbeliever it's believing or unbelieving I told him this morning in - at the men's breakfast I said look we have to believe in something we can't see I'm getting a little ahead of myself but I'll get to it in just a second but jesus said my father my father my father one day Philip I don't know where they had enough but Philip said you're talking about this other person and you know what Philip could say now Jesus I can go take you and show you who my father is I can take you and show you who my father is but now you're talking about a father that he's not anywhere to be seen Jesus said Philip have I been so long with you if you've seen me and that's what I told him at the breakfast him buddy their eyes got big I said you know what I said Jesus was lying if that wasn't the truth he said if you've seen me you have seen the father I said now Jesus is lying if I thought the truth bori their eyes got big cuz you have to be careful I was careful I didn't get into any doctrine but I did him to know that a I the Heavenly Father they cared about them just as much as I cared about us amen it's not us in them we'd be in the shape they're in if we didn't have what God that we moved on a little further and left those denominations and come out of those things but what's worse than them staying in there and living in all the life they can live in and that's leaving them denomination and become a denomination in this message if that lot in you be darkness how great is that darkness hey man so let's get in let's get into it just a little bit and we'll try to be finished here about 3:15 I'm trying to trying to figure out that time but the breaking of the COC is not for the soul the soul is redeemed by the new birth now we've been through that many times the mean times if you'll notice today though when I get to a certain point of the message you'll see this morning if you'll go back and watch brother Dale he come - right to a point stopped and went in another direction well that's where I'm coming to him going in that direction saying I'm een come down - he was getting ready to bring the same thing and then he went off not off on something else but he went to another subject so I swear the Lord works but the soul is redeemed by the new birth the shed blood of Jesus cross at Calvary but we're looking at full fellowship because Jesus and the father were one Jesus and the father never had a disagreement now in our spirit realm we have a disagreement but now in your soul if you're born again you can't disagree with God you can't disagree with the word so if you're continually disagreeing with what the word saying then where's the person if the person of the Holy Ghost is inside of you if the father which is the Holy Ghost it's going to come and dwell in you and he's contrary to the word cuz that's what Jesus said Jesus said you're acting like your father and I'm acting like my father you know what he was saying we have two different daddies that's what bothered him and I'm gonna read you here in the scripture to where they they perceived I don't know if you ever read that before they perceived oh we read it that he was saying he was God that's what made him mad cuz those remember when Jesus came to the Pharisees the Pharisees knew there was a only one God not three persons not a father a son and the Holy Ghost no that was one God one true God called even the one even the the Jew that brother branham was talking to remember the rabbi he said rabbi who will be the Messiah he said he'll we got so they know that see they had one God right before we split him up and they've still got him right they just know don't they just don't know that he's already come come into those different manifestations and left and come back in you and me okay so he hid himself in simplicity how much more simple can the word be amen but we'll bring full fellowship into manifestation and full fellowship is like what brother Dells been talking about your soul has got everything you need okay little Chloe back there she's how nine weeks old she's got every part in her to be a mother but don't put that - don't put that on her right not time she's not grown hey man Jonas where's Jonas Jonas in the back Jonas must have done something bless his heart pray for Jonas but Joe brother Joe Canada today you got little Jonas he's a man he's a man he's got everything he has to be a man but Joseph is not going to give him the keys and let him drive the car up to the to the park why he's not mature enough he had neat enough that's the same thing with being a Christian that's why that that we should not be as brother there was talk about we can't stay babies if you stay babies man what is going on that's not that's not that's not my will sure I would like for Deanna to stay ten years old lock her in right there but see that would be injustice going like this that would be a disservice to Deanna that would not make her a full all person sorry Josh she's gonna grow up you're gonna have heartaches and trials and troubles and bless your heart we'll be right there with you but that's what God you can't understand God without having the Holy Ghost to start with then you got to grow and you go that you get those aha moments I'll that's what you're talking about God oh that's what you're talking about Lord yeah that's what you're talking about that's Revelation see sometimes we think Revelation is just something that God you know one day you know and you know it's just those little things that you come to church either better or worse hello better or worse we come to church and we get some little something some little something from God well that's the father working through you because if you've seen me you've seen the father in our gene in our genetic makeup man I'm telling you I saw Tom Fuller's walk up this aisle you know hundreds of times right he had that certain you know what I can't walk like that because I don't have his genetic marker but Donnie go walk back there and walk up through here yeah you walk just lucky brother he's got that Sam you're doing it you know this is Tom with that foot kicked out like in well watch him same thing now he's he got older he's getting worse yeah exactly but all of us walk like our father in the genetic form of our natural birth so why not when the father comes in the form of the Holy Ghost that our walk is the same as that genetic makeup of that father hey man that's what the Holy Ghost is for so we're gonna skip through all this and get right to it and then we'll stop because remember full manifestation is what God wants in a group of people not just one person in a group of people all right and this and keep going let's going up go ahead and we don't read number one just keep going keep going keep going right there well I will restore or not reformed restore means he's going to actually take our genetic makeup in the gospel and change it because in no offense to the people I was talking to this morning but even the most baby simple things that we talked about what is is baffling to them why because the way they're taught what they eat what they eat and their genetic makeup not saying that they come from the devil no don't get me wrong but the genetic makeup of their denomination the denominational whatever they come through has told them this way to walk this is the way to dress this is a way to talk now is it the Heavenly Father I hope and pray that God shines down and shows them something especially from what I was trying to talk about today I I told him and they looked across out again and I said look I said why did we all do this Heavenly Father no I said the Bible said he'll be with you even in you I said Moses even told us in the Old Testament not to look over yonder look up you under look down here right he's right here I will restore not reformed the lamb is protected this seal which under this seal the black horse something must be dead that's what we were talking about last Sunday all right everybody okay with that say ma'am all right and we're gonna read that because in Romans 7 verse 1 no you're not brethren I speak to you they are they're known to law now that the law have to make over man as long as he liveth for the woman which hath an husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from the law of a husband now remember she is able to be married again so there is a life comes again yep listen if if a natural husband dies the physical wife doesn't die okay right the physical wife doesn't die she's alive but she's loosed from the law of that old husband and she's able to marry who she will only in the Lord only in the Lord but she's free to marry why because her old husband's dead he's not still hanging around he's not got a grip on her hey man but now remember I'm sorry we can't put Christ away we can't kill him why would you want to kill the eternal life and then married is something that's yeah that's what I thought that's why a woman can't marry again she's got a live-in husband she can't get married again but now a husband can't put her wife away for fornication that's what Christ did he put Israel away because of her fornicators Jonas you okay buddy okay mean mummy he put he put Israel away amen you'll grow up son don't worry he put Israel away she's still there and he married another the Gentile Church hey man he can do that we can do that but you sisters can't do that right now I'm not I'm not playing marriage and divorce here I'm just telling you what the Bible says because your type has to be what you are in the new birth because remember we're all feminists in the body of Christ I can't be married to a Methodist or a Baptist or a Pentecostal head and be married to cry cuz I'm a female I can't put him away he's got to be dead once he's dead once something dies then we're free for the woman which has the husband is bound by the law to her husband so long as he liveth but if the husband be dead she is loosed from that law we're loosed from the law when we get born again when we ask God to come in our heart in our life and come in and not just move stuff out of the way no kill it brother Graham said I'll look it up maybe next Sunday God let it die you know what a lot of our problem is is we feed the demons we feed the demons that we want to get rid of you know what you quit feeding that demon watch him die watch him die quit feeding that demon brother Brahim said how you gonna rather Brown them I have a stingy spirit he said now you got to get on your knees and go through the prayer line and have 12 quarts all poured on you he said no he said start giving stuff away he said do the vice versa for those of you that are not from the South by silver sea means do the opposite just for those that don't know what vice versa is but I'm quoting the prophet so did the vice versa t he didn't say good you know well you know what it done you quit feeding that demon and you started letting God control you started doing the opposite of what okay this thing's not complicated it's really not so then if while her husband liveth she be married to another man in other words if I try to put Christ away she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is free from that law so that she is no adulteress though she be married to another man that's dead she can't be married to a living she can't be married and have a living husband that's what the Bible says all right wherefore my brethren you also look Paul's bringing it to you and I you also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him he was raised from the dead now you can't be married to another it just told you something's got to be dead it just told you something's got to be dead so it's not telling you you marry another just whatever you want to know if there's something that has died wait a minute where's Cathy Gable man she give me a pointer they're gone they have to leave okay well she gave me a book pretty neat huh okay it should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God now what does that mean that means you better have a personal relationship with this new husband you got it cuz fruit is children fruit of the Spirit if it's spiritual see that that we should bring forth fruit unto God for when we were in the flesh the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death that thing that brother Nell was talking about from the inside we were born dead we were born dead amen the reason we were born dead is because we were born in sin the motions of sin which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death but but everybody say but those of you that are sleep we're talking about but now I like Paul if Paul was to stop in a certain spot it like you had no hope we're doing that in Romans we're going through them going through and going through and if we stop at a certain place you're like we're dead Paul you ain't got us no way out but now we are delivered from the law that being dead wherein we were held bound by that old husband and remember that old husband was the dark horse the black horse that's what we were being held by amen we're when we were held that we should serve in the newness noon is something new something coming forth a new life a new nurse of spirit and not in the oldest of the letter but because remember Paul said the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life that all right say ma'am all right now let's go to Romans 6 verse 6 knowing this that our old man is crucified now when you put something on the cross it kills it no one ever come off of a cross alive they put you on there to kill you knowing that your old man is crucified with him that the body of sin might be destroyed now he's not talking about this body this was a product of sin but it doesn't sin I hope y'all keep we keep me and brother they'll both keep trying to tell you that forget about the flesh the flesh does not sin in itself it is a man it manifest what's already inside of you that the body of sin might be destroyed that henceforth we should not serve sin for he that is dead it's free from sin it's your dad you're free now if we be dead with Christ we believe that we also we shall also live with him amen dead alright let's go to Colossians and then we'll go we should be doing okay set your affections on things above not on things on the earth for your dad Paul what do you know you're talking about we are killing us amen amen like why Moody said I'll tell you again God will only fill those that are not full of this elf one more time God will fill those who are not full of themself okay because you know what that was Jesus's whole thing I'm dead and the father's alive I don't do anything unless what he tells me now listen it wasn't if the father said you can eat now that's not that's not it we know that his humanity he went through humanity had friends he had conversations and all those things and it wasn't that it sure God was talking but it wasn't like he said I only do what the father shows me the father didn't show him to eat everyday or you know do this no not everything you understand what I'm saying that's why you and I have to live life we have to live life okay for ye are dead and you're a lot wait a minute see this is like an oxymoron you are dead and your life you are dead and now you got a life something must have come up something must have had a resurrection they mate for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God so therefore like I was saying this morning and brother Dale was saying the other day whatever Christ got whatever Jesus got we get he inherited eternal life we inherit eternal life amen 1st Timothy 5 verse 6 but she that liveth in pleasure is dead while she liveth and we know that we're talking and that listen you said ice denomination that's enough that's any idea you got and I got against the Word of God amen anything we have that we think is pleasure is dead well she liveth all right now let's look right here now and let's go this is the point I want to make for today and give me just a few more minutes would be okay is the power of transformation because the power of transformation God in the beginning here's Romans 12 now we're going to read this but I want to taste some of the power transformation listen the Genesis 1:26 man in the beginning does not need to be transformed he's perfect he's God that's the Holy Ghost you got living inside of you now that's the Christ that came on the earth that's the Christ that went through the Old Testament amen that okay there all right Genesis 1:26 man is God in another form let us make man in our image and then our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish and see in fact that's exactly what Adam did amen so the power of transformation means that we did had to have a metamorphose oh it's up in a minute we had to have a metamorphosis happen we had to go from one stage to another state y'all come on in they got visitors today Bob black and his wife and all they little cheering glad y'all could make it today make sure you turn the cameras on his red face for you he had to go get his kids I'm up here I'll talk about they had to go get his kids so that's okay that's fine I'm just kidding but look the power of transformation then there had to be once there's a fall we had to be transformed back something had to happen there had to be a there had to be a transformation and there's only one person look Bob when I got look there had to be what enough power to transform us back to me that's what the seal to me that's what the seals are doing that gives us the power we've got the power but he gives us the ability to use the sword and then we got the sword we got the word we need the power to use it it's what brother branham said brother branham said now it takes a strong hand to faith he had the sword in his hand and it fit perfect but he said it takes the strong hand of faith to go toward the enemy you can have the best you have the best sword in the world but if I never was a swordsman and I walked up to a swordsman he can get a pocketknife and kill me with it and I can have a big long sword this long why because he's got the ability he studied he's went to church he's read the message he's let God revealed things to him so the power of transformation let's look at this real quick and then we'll then we'll close Romans 12 verse 1 I beseech you therefore brethren I smile like Romans you see we're still in Romans we having a good time in the sentence good class for Romans I really see more as the seals come I'm not finished with that yet as back there I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world because remember we were conformed to this world when we came in flesh hello we were conformed to this world when we came into human flesh through the womb of our mother by the act of our mother and father that wasn't what it was supposed to be amen but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God good acceptable and perfect will of God God must be pleased when something happens and then so now let's look at what that word transformed means in the Greek it means Metamorpho our transfigure are to change into another form to transform a transfigure and that's what's happening with us from the inside the butterflies goes to work the old caterpillar excuse me the old caterpillar you see that thing going up a tree it's just as ugly as Bob black it is just ugly Isaiah 53 says no beauty that we should desire him same thing with us no beauty that God would desire us because we're there so caterpillar and we just like like brother Joel says we just go to the next leaf but inside is working the butterfly that's inside is working something that it's the most beautiful thing that I've ever seen flying is the butterfly it's so graceful and it's just so light and it's got so many different colors well it used to be an ugly worm hey you should be an ugly worm same thing with you and I will use me an ugly old worm but inside of us with a Metamorpho are a metamorphosis changing into another form alright so now let's go to the next and let's read John one to watch we know what John 1:1 says in the beginning was word words was the Garden word was gone now look he came into his own and his own received him not but as many as received him there's your choice to them gave he power to become the sons of God even to them that believe on his name which were look which were born not a blood jesus said Nicodemus you must be born again Nicodemus says I got to go back in my mother's blood and my mom in the flesh and be born jesus said no you need a new one that's why they call it an uber you need a new one because your first one wasn't worth anything it just got you here and got you breathing so you can manifest somebody the devil or God one of the two which were born not of blood nor of the will of the flesh your natural birth nor of the will of man but of God which were born take all that out which were born of God and the Word was made flesh oh that was Jesus that wasn't just Jesus and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he had to be the first one - that happened - he was the word that word was made flesh and as brother Branham says he says word becoming flesh flesh becoming the word because we're working back toward this way the flesh is becoming the word now the word was made flesh so that what he can make a way for us to get back and then and the word was made flesh see this is just like brother Dale saying this morning this is really just simple salvation it's got to start that way but taking simple salvation you just keep adding on add known I'd known you keep feeding Jonas and then about how old is he 6 5 ok in 11 years he can drive but he's got 11 years for growing to do jobs none will give him the key tonight let him drive up to the to the park please I'm not gonna be in front or behind him but you see that then God knows that God knows that about me and you he's not gonna dump it all on you at the same time amen but some of us to make ourselves available more than others I say some of us I'm gonna come with me I'm said some of us make herself more available because mama was driving when she was 14 she was able she wasn't supposed to but she was able I would say way back then they didn't have a law for that but I'm not gonna go there and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the Father full of grace and truth no man has seen God at any time that's the Bible got it that's the Bible no man has seen God at any time the only begotten Son which is in the bosom of the Father he hath declared him that's what he's trying to tell Philip so let's go to another scripture John 5 verse 17 but jesus answered and said unto them my father worketh hitherto and I work now look to me excuse me the fellowship that we lost listen to me for saying the fellowship we lost Jesus proved that it could be brought back when he came earth and him and his father were in so much not to people you understand what I'm saying we know that I don't have to explain that wedding to people my father worketh hitherto and I work now see that should be you and I say in that therefore the Jews sought the look Jesus said one thing my father worketh in I work they interpreted exactly right because they said look the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only broke the Sabbath but he all but said also that God was his father making himself equal with God that's what they were trying to kill him for and listen the believability of that is unbelievable that we can do that the believability of that is unbelievable because we got to believe something that we shouldn't have to believe look at that that we are equal with God now he's one who told us that we did he's one told us that then Jesus said then answered Jesus and said unto them verily verily I say unto you the son can do nothing of himself but what he seeth the father do for what things whatsoever he doeth these also doeth the son likewise now that's back to full harmony that's back to where Adam was in the Garden of Eden he's the second atom right and man he was the atom that was supposed to fulfill all this this man right or atom was supposed to fulfil all this this second atom coming full field every bit of it cuz this second atom is going to take us back to the Garden of Eden and then this second atom is going to literally take us back to the Garden of Eden hey man all right now st. John 6 verse 46 not that any man hath seen the father say he which is of God he has seen the father oh that's just Jesus I thought we were children of God I thought we were of God so we've seen the father not that any man has seen the father save he which is of God he hath seen the father you and I have seen the father we know who we're talking to when we talked to that person not a third person talking to a second trying to get to a first John 8 verse 19 then said they unto Him where is the father you know all of them standing around could go on father's day hey I'm gonna go see my father and Jesus is like I am the father I'm the father made benefit then said they unto Him where is my father jesus answered you neither know him know me nor my father if you had known me now Jesus is lying if he's not telling the truth if ye had known me you should have known my father also why because we walked the same yeah we got the same genetic code they just didn't believe that was who that was hey man so it comes back to believe John 10 verse 28 this is where brother Dale was heading to this morning and he diverted or the Lord diverted him because I was going to read all these scriptures right here John 10 verse 28 and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand who's talking Jesus my father which gave them me is greater than all now there is where brother Dale somebody he gave honor because he was in human flesh he gave honor to that that was inside of it amen so Jesus wasn't all over the world he wasn't he was one man standing in one place amen my father which gave them me because remember that was his dispensation that's what he was he was in my father which gave them me is greater than all and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand now there's not two hands he just tells you right here if there's listen here's the love letter listen folks if there's any doubt this is between 29 and 30 if there's any doubt about Who I am I and my father one if there's any doubt I'm gonna tell you it's not a father's hand in my hand I and my father are one how good is that all right let's go to the next one Thomas entered him Lord we don't know whether they going and how can we know the way Jesus sent unto him I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me if you had known me you should have known my father also now look and from henceforth you know him and have seen him now watch Philip didn't get it Philip didn't have the Holy Ghost but what got what's God saying hold on God's saying that right here you're gonna get the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost I'm going to come back and I'm going to give you this revelation that I'm talking about here and you're gonna see him if you've seen me you've seen the father our Philip said Lord now here's the carnal part of man Philip said Lord you're talking about this father where is this man like I said Philip Philip can go back to Philip senior and go hey this is my daddy Jesus is talking about his daddy and everybody's going well where's he going to show up at Philip said unto me Lord show us the father and other words it'll satisfies in other words we got a problem with what you're saying we're not satisfied with what you've been talking about suffice mean satisfied jesus said unto Him have I not been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that hath seen me hath seen the father and how sayest thou show us the father believe it's now not that I am in the father and the father in me wait a minute I am in the father and the father in me they're not going back and forth like this no they're less okay we're gonna move it oh the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the words believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works a very barely I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father what I come from God I go back to God when he went back to God he came down in a mini membered body and started doing his work that's the father's Kingdom thy kingdom come Thy will be done in earth and then and whatsoever you shall ask in my name that will I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you shall ask anything in my name I will do it if you love me keep my Commandments and look and I will pray the father and he shall give you another comforter that he may abide with you forever even the Spirit of Truth no spirit of error I'll give you the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not now that's not physical eyes see means to understand remember a little while in the world see me no more but you'll see me now I've never seen Jesus Christ that walked on the shores of Galilee they hung on cross never saw him before but I believe who he was and the same spirit that was in him than me that means I'm seen understand right see that to me that's the fellowship the fellow the only way that I'm word this right the only way that Jun and I can have true Fellowship is to know each other I don't mean in the nobody wonders what to think conversation talk know each other okay the only way we can have a closeness is to know each other same way with God how you gonna know him if you don't talk to him how you gonna know him if you don't read his word how you gonna know him if you don't study but I've got the Holy Ghost brother yeah you got the Holy Ghost but you got it bound you got it bound because that see of him not neither knoweth him now that part we can talk about that because Jesus said you'll come up today and said said unto cashed out Devils and done all these mighty works and he said Department from me I never knew you what I never had an intimate relationship you know what he's saying and I'm just gonna be frank cuz this is exactly what it is you've never let me in the womb of your mind you've never let me plant the word in the womb of your mind and you bring forth fruit like you're supposed to do that's exactly the truth that's why God has to get in the womb of our mind he doesn't care about the womb of our whatever else but the womb of our mind he doesn't get it but you say no you don't think we'll your brain remember that Satan's territory you think we're heart out of the heart proceed if all things and then even the Spirit of Truth whom the world cannot receive because it seeth him not neither knoweth him but you know me for he dwelleth with you and shall be in you now if the father at least I'm not the father so if the father's in you and Jesus said I'm gonna come in you and now we're gonna bring the Holy Ghost in fill me out Lord let you know what there's no room for nobody else if you got it right I can say it the Father Son Holy Ghost dwells inside of me if you got it right hey man hey man because I'm I'm too full of myself I can't let them in their.what moody said that I think I will not leave you comfortless I will come to you yet a little while in the world see if me nobody eat no more but ye see me because I live you shall live also in other words there was a death now there is a life and that day brother I'm said that's this day you shall know that I am in my father and he and me and I in you he's a man that's four people running around well three people and then you got to add the Holy Ghost in a minute come on ain't but one God there's only one manifestation there's only one you understand what I mean for us and that's the Holy Ghost in our life and then because this is the dispensation of what the Holy Ghost and then the Son of God revelation now we come into son of man we got that that's on the fourth seal cuz a revelation of the Son of Man listen we live under the revelation of the Son of God we've already been through this right we do get the revelation of son of man but that comes to the body change call the Son of man took the body change son of god didn't take a body change it sound of god don't need a body change the son of god is what makes the body change amen alright let's go real quick what's the next one this is the last one right here but the comforter which is the Holy Ghost now he told us before that the father was going to send the comforter so now he's identifying who this comforter is which is the Holy Ghost whom the father will send in my name he shall teach you all things and bring all things to your remembrance whatsoever I have said unto you peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth give I unto you let not your heart be troubled neither let it be afraid I'm talking to you today you have heard how I said unto you I go away and come again unto you if you loved me you would rejoice because I said I go unto the Father for the father is greater not in other words you know what he's saying if I stay here I can't do the work that I'm supposed to do if I stay here now hit last John 14 he was still alive hadn't been to Calvary right so if he stayed in that spot you know if that's what I said if you don't understand what I'm saying I'm gonna tell you if if Satan would have left Jesus alone he would have been trapped in that body and died a natural death but Satan said no I'm gonna kill him well through Caiaphas he said I'm gonna kill him and when he killed him he made him greater did one Jesus then you know 121 Jesus is now the three thousand Jesus is now there's three million Jesus amen so Satan bless his heart everything he touches they just don't turn out good for him but you know what that's all right with as much heartache and trial he's give us he deserves every bit of it amen but we don't have a father today folks that has gone away and it's not here he's right here to do the work he is on his throne doing what he's supposed to do he is not a what was I tell him this morning he's not something that goes on vacation or some you can't get on the phone and say hey Dad I need something well bad cell service no no no listen God's Wi-Fi always works you don't need a wire it always works and it never goes recalculating no at Legion guides and all truth that third seal is so important to me because it proves to me one thing if you don't have the Holy Ghost you're not gonna take a body chain you are not going to understand the full plan of God and you're lost you're black that's what that black horse that black horse though now though bet so deceptive that black horse is riding through the land telling people you're okay you're good you're fine go where you ain't gotta go Church you know what they told me at one church it was an on my excellent church wasn't a message Church but they said we don't have Sunday service we don't have Sunday service even the service anymore so the families can get together I said my family gets together at church service hey man I said my family gets the I said what are y'all gonna do drink beer and watch television you can talk to some of them like that some of them you can't talk to them look I didn't say that today but what is the what's the deal the deal is we're trying to get together as a family you know why we getting you know why you get together as a family because she was born in the family and then you were born that way and then we were when we died in Christ and was Reza brought back alive what did it bring us into the whole new world a whole new world totally contrary to this world that we're living in I mean we're living in two dimensions already hey man our soul is living in a dimension of perfection you know what we you don't excuse me you know what we got to do you got to get the pieces to match somebody preach the sermon on that twenty something years ago but when they see these seals to me it's showing the complete plan of redemption it's the most simple I don't understand why people can't understand that it's so simple but yet it's so deep so that you know why it's deep its deep because they ain't got past one plus one is two they've they've not went on to the algebra class or the and you know what it's there it's at your disposal is at my disposal that's what these seals are for let's stand our feet that's what these seals are for now what are we supposed to do we're supposed to do just like Jesus and declare the Father and then they'd not be to listen did not be to people jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father I and my father are one I come from God I go back to God that's me and you folk that's us there's only one father they can come and give his life and then not come back into just one person but a mini membered body because he knew every one of us before the foundation of the world he knew what we would choose and these sales are bringing us back closer if you listen I'm telling if you don't feel closer to God now than you did before then you're you're falling behind and you say oh I don't know look just like what in Romans the book of Romans we've been in the book of Romans now for a while only on the 3rd chapter but didn't didn't we saw Luis today but we saw the seals right we saw the seal that opened in that book of Romans the 3rd chapter the justified part remember it the justification sanctification about tears of the Holy Ghost has to be interlaced into the in the scripture because that's where we get our doctrine from Scripture we don't get our doctrine from somebody another book our doctrine we do have a doctrine it's in the Bible the doctrine is in that Bible you know what it's what changes us you know what they've also proven I was gonna tell you this before they have proven that godly sent in the outer space that lived in the space station for so long when he came back what happened he changed his DNA right Aaron read the article I read the article he stayed out in space for so long until it started changing his DNA they took another test and it was changing his form I thought we were supposed to be living in heavenly places and I think that's what changes our DNA let's sing a song hey man that's what changes us sing a little medley we always sing starting with he's everything to me hey man page seven I say in just a few minutes and I remember when we finish go take the picture guys okay go take the picture and then let's get this stuff loaded so we can get out of here okay then we need to be going he's everything to me he's he's everything to me he's my father my mother my sister and my mother everything to me easy everything thing to me he's everything to me he's my father my brother my sister and [Music] everything [Music]
