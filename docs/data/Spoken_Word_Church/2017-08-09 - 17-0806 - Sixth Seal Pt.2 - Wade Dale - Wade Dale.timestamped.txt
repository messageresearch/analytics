[0:14] after you female thank you
[0:18] all right I've got slim Biggins the
[0:22] neighbor nicely bit hidden in binoculars
[0:25] what we're slammed but I'm giving you
[0:30] the most vision washed up oh yeah
[0:33] absolutely
[0:35] all right so now we have talked last
[0:37] week about the fifth seal we actually
[0:39] went through a review which oh I believe
[0:44] helton help people more than then we
[0:47] were I think I'll do that I'll go just a
[0:50] little way and we'll buy guzzle yeah and
[0:51] just kind of catch up everybody you know
[0:53] very much yes way it was two several
[0:55] others that make that comment about
[0:58] itself but I want you to get what I was
[1:03] trying to tell you last Sunday and get
[1:05] the essence of the field and I promise
[1:08] you one thing
[1:11] brother brother Bob he's not here today
[1:15] but brother Bob got online and he's kind
[1:18] of talking to somebody in and he's
[1:22] talking about the seal being for
[1:27] redemption
[1:29] and boy if you're not really tall then
[1:31] you know really is people don't see that
[1:34] because they haven't been taught they
[1:36] think it's the revealing of the
[1:37] Antichrist which it is but I thought the
[1:41] Prophet said there was a seventh seal
[1:43] above the redemption okay the Book of
[1:47] Revelations filed was the sealed book
[1:50] that the lamb took out of the hand of
[1:54] the one sitting on the throne and in
[1:55] Revelation 10 7 that book was open and
[1:58] he delivered it to the seventh angel to
[2:01] deliver to you and I which is a seven
[2:03] filled with the redemption not a
[2:05] sentence you look about the devil and
[2:09] you'll understand that because remember
[2:11] the property God says the what was the
[2:14] thunder the thunder whoever I think is
[2:16] so experienced but the thunders is the
[2:18] revelations contained in the seal all
[2:22] right so that's what we're doing here
[2:24] this is to me you say what you want but
[2:27] this is the thunder that route that that
[2:30] ad spoke out through the seals to tell
[2:34] us true and I don't want to say the real
[2:36] revelation because this is a revelation
[2:38] to the anti-skid but knowing who the
[2:41] Antichrist is and all of this tactic
[2:44] that's good
[2:45] but how I'm not going to change your
[2:46] body knuckle change your body is not
[2:48] resent you can't redeem the devil okay
[2:53] so so the mystery brother ended with the
[2:57] mystery contained in the seven seals the
[2:59] world around broke the Seventh Seal
[3:01] which was those seven day or eight days
[3:04] in jeffersonville in 1963 but if the
[3:08] revelations contained in those seven
[3:10] fields which are the Thunder are the
[3:13] voice of God when the seal breaks that's
[3:16] telling you and I was going over right
[3:17] now so if you want to watch the Thunder
[3:20] garden you've been hearing for the past
[3:22] month two months and actually 25 or 30
[3:25] years all right so we're very fortunate
[3:28] my brother Bob said I'd forgotten
[3:31] speaking to that individual he he
[3:33] thanked God that he was living there
[3:35] teaching under their teaching ministry
[3:37] because if not he would be just like the
[3:40] brother but when you mean this is her
[3:42] attention what do you mean what do you
[3:44] do the God was just totally nuts a lost
[3:48] but he was totally ignorant of and
[3:51] that's my whole pretense listen if the
[3:54] seal broke in 1963 now it did as a
[3:58] prophet but now what would everybody
[4:00] around them everybody around him thought
[4:02] and even himself thought it would the
[4:06] end I thought it was going to be over
[4:07] that when he even did it going to be
[4:09] killed right memory stop don't turn what
[4:11] it is from either I'm going to be killed
[4:13] or it's a further part of my ministry
[4:15] will Wendy started preaching Oh sealed
[4:17] they fill up to the cell still thinking
[4:19] that the rapture was going to take place
[4:20] on that Sunday when he preached to sell
[4:22] affiliate and it's been 60 years since
[4:25] then thankfully been 53 73 83 93 2003
[4:31] 2013 amen
[4:36] let's get on his bed yeah in 54 years
[4:40] almost 55 years that we probe that this
[4:43] message and brother Brown says what the
[4:46] greatest message you that were great so
[4:49] not to throw all of them out but to keep
[4:51] all of them right underneath that we see
[4:54] that it has to have like the onion field
[4:58] it's got a layer there's got another
[5:02] layer underneath that and then and then
[5:06] it's going to layer underneath that
[5:09] because if its justification baby form
[5:12] and then there's another level of
[5:13] justification and then there's another
[5:15] level duplicate something got opened up
[5:18] under those seals because they say
[5:21] brother I need to write when third
[5:22] chapter revelations or he said these
[5:24] thunders would be outside the Bible he
[5:26] said no no you can't add one word can
[5:30] take one chord out so what is it what
[5:32] here's the book what is the Bible now in
[5:36] tablet form what is about if the seven
[5:39] sealed book of retention not the seven
[5:42] sealed book of the revelation of the
[5:44] devil
[5:46] I'm sorry but that you see how though
[5:50] that people are blinded by Paul
[5:52] Shepherds or have not had teaching that
[5:55] would at least thus osterlich steer
[6:00] steer you in pride direction after you
[6:03] up three other series you've been
[6:06] stirring steered then you can see that
[6:13] remember the Bible is written what is
[6:16] written on the surface as a commentary
[6:19] of history well I said on the service
[6:22] your first layer is a commentary of
[6:24] history from the garden to the future on
[6:27] a commentary you can how many people
[6:31] most of the stuff we get from
[6:33] civilization and stuff like that comes
[6:35] from the Bible all of our laws of the
[6:37] race according works supposed to be at
[6:40] the first very important to ten
[6:41] commandments all of our judgments are
[6:43] according to them the Old Testament so
[6:46] it's a comic book of culture that man
[6:48] had lived by Emma going what the
[6:49] Christian and even though maybe didn't
[6:51] understand everything was going off
[6:52] right then there's another layer
[6:55] underneath that this brother grams of
[6:57] the Bible written to Christian right
[7:00] we get our food from that we get our
[7:02] energy ancestor it's our source of life
[7:05] past the email I all right because it
[7:08] has a what has it has a natural
[7:10] implication then has a spiritual
[7:13] implication and then to me it has a
[7:15] supernatural implication that this very
[7:19] word that we're reading right here is
[7:21] eternal it was only pen so that you and
[7:25] I could read it and put it above because
[7:28] before the foundation of the world the
[7:31] lamb was slain the Bible was never just
[7:34] written it was already here but what was
[7:38] it was in the mind of God that he had to
[7:40] what bring it down let somebody
[7:42] naturally will go remember all this is
[7:45] about a natural people that live to
[7:46] serve right natural names of people that
[7:50] live on this earth is part of this
[7:52] tria history is not without pleasures
[7:55] and people cuz you know what I want you
[7:59] to do me a favor go and find me a book
[8:02] of a civilization and history find me a
[8:08] history book on a bookmark
[8:10] I mean I'm just way more well you can Y
[8:15] go to nobody enough day because there's
[8:19] no there's nobody to write about there
[8:23] there's no history so you see I just got
[8:26] that thing but you really don't find a
[8:30] book on the history of March you can
[8:33] find a commentary that we wrote about
[8:35] what we see a large but but it is on the
[8:39] earth the only way you can write a book
[8:41] is help somebody here but your hook I
[8:44] can read you like a book you're reading
[8:47] epistle you wrote the Bible that's what
[8:49] I'm telling your wind you know this part
[8:52] of this Bible that you you wrote it
[8:54] whether you believe that or not because
[8:57] the attributes that come from God I
[8:59] never moved
[9:01] and what forms you is the attribute it
[9:04] was written here the like oh they'll
[9:06] tell you last night I mean if we have
[9:08] angel
[9:09] we are predestinated obviously by for
[9:11] knowledge but we are predestined then we
[9:13] have a predetermined journey that we
[9:15] take but it was predetermined by what I
[9:17] saw we would do and the angels cannot
[9:21] find our thinking last night the angel
[9:23] without angel defender brother ground
[9:25] them never gave him a real legend he
[9:29] would give him a suggestion it written
[9:32] in the scripture where it says that
[9:34] you'll read all the things that the
[9:37] angel because the angel just couldn't
[9:39] come out and give you a revelation
[9:40] why revelation has to come human sure
[9:45] they're sparks is that the angel know
[9:46] that there's one thing for sure the
[9:48] angel don't know one thing about
[9:49] redemption right yeah you don't leave
[9:53] out reduction so that's something they
[9:55] don't know that you and the human being
[9:57] because you became a human and you were
[10:00] regenerated you can
[10:03] that's why we will judge the angle think
[10:08] about that that's good food talk so this
[10:12] is the college grade but then there is a
[10:14] what to understand rocket for a history
[10:16] book why would we need to judge angels
[10:18] they never see because they were late so
[10:22] I got to be somewhere for they some of
[10:24] them fell they gotta be aware some of
[10:27] them I don't know what you say make
[10:29] mistakes but I just a lot of what the
[10:31] Bible says the overcome my mom study
[10:33] last night reason grant good time about
[10:35] today that we good we're talking about
[10:36] the very same thing and what about this
[10:39] was your game well we'll judge the
[10:41] Angels that was supposed to help this
[10:44] person or suppose judge those angel and
[10:47] I don't know it's not going to be a part
[10:48] of because one thing's for sure the one
[10:50] we went with the devil they're going to
[10:52] be dogging my god they're going to be
[10:53] killed those spirits are going to be
[10:56] gone
[10:56] they're going to deal them the more they
[10:58] just I felt like by painting the life
[11:00] failure okay but the Bible says we will
[11:03] change and so that's what we will do
[11:06] negative come on your good ever they're
[11:15] back whatever does one way or the other
[11:19] that's correct or not yes that's right
[11:22] that's what Darren I was talking about
[11:24] last night because Ryan let me say this
[11:26] come at your mom about judgment
[11:28] I know we'll be we'll get off this from
[11:29] head but but we'll get back once in a
[11:31] minute but he says don't judge you need
[11:34] to tell your mother she's judged every
[11:36] day she can if she drops 70 miles an
[11:39] hour at 55 mile an hour zone
[11:41] she's judged if she's caught there's a
[11:45] judgment in place that she's going to
[11:47] have to require her just go that judge
[11:51] or the justice system
[11:55] we're judged everything we're good Oh
[11:57] everything we do we're judge right can
[12:01] you go outside Renekton you in New York
[12:03] no one there's a law in place of
[12:06] judgment so everything's judge
[12:10] everything you can
[12:12] but the reason we can judge more like I
[12:15] said last time the reason we judge is
[12:17] because we have the Holy Ghost
[12:19] the Word of God and then we have the
[12:22] true revelation now you can't tell I say
[12:24] your mom but I would tell
[12:26] we've been raptured up we've been taken
[12:28] and put in a place that a lot of people
[12:30] honey we're in a place you know we're in
[12:33] a place that nobody then depends we are
[12:35] not the ones that judge why did you
[12:38] judge your guys you just didn't buy what
[12:40] the Holy Ghost knew was right and wrong
[12:41] what coming from the word diet
[12:44] it's like brother Clarence said about
[12:46] the gay community I'm not judging the
[12:48] gay community the Bible's already
[12:50] judging all right and if we hold the
[12:52] Bible to be the ultimatum then there you
[12:56] go back to the judgment tribe looking
[12:59] for Apollo you see one that you know so
[13:02] what you're doing is you're what we're
[13:03] doing this now is moral warning because
[13:06] program is warning then judgment so till
[13:10] you warn them what I've worn my children
[13:13] what the Word of God said if you're
[13:15] mourning if you're born and you're
[13:16] thought I mean if you're not born again
[13:17] you going to go to hell that's what the
[13:19] Bible is I send you that I'm just
[13:22] referring to what the judge the
[13:27] righteous judge that's why they under
[13:32] then judgment you will not have to stand
[13:35] there for millions and millions of years
[13:37] and judge every person they'll judge
[13:39] yourself in an instant everything he
[13:42] goes do their brand a lifespan or watch
[13:44] their whole life they live they knew
[13:47] where they went wrong they knew where
[13:50] God come to them and he they turn them
[13:52] down they'll know that right they'll
[13:56] know that so they don't have to set
[13:58] there you know you we have billions of
[14:01] people we got to stand there watch every
[14:03] one of them go to the line they're going
[14:05] to instantly know once they go to the
[14:07] line they're up there they come to the
[14:09] judgment bar the whole life is going to
[14:11] be given her the thing your life flashed
[14:14] before you okay though your life went on
[14:17] blast right before you eat so any well
[14:21] that's what happened in judge
[14:23] won't be it will go well now on marked
[14:25] for pain you did is right know they're
[14:29] going to be what the words going to be
[14:31] standing there in flesh Christ
[14:34] Enterprise going to be standing their
[14:35] flesh and with enough of the bride
[14:39] alters all through the ages those people
[14:42] most of them are going to have to have
[14:43] some contact with the people that
[14:45] standing in judgment it's going to be
[14:50] real hard when I told to buy the other
[14:52] day and let's just work a scenario you
[14:54] took them you take a man like that man
[14:56] it was in the Bible
[14:57] now he was committing fornication he was
[14:59] living with his stepmom he took extent
[15:04] homage guard living with her and Paul
[15:06] condemned it now what he done was is he
[15:09] repented and we rarely last not the
[15:11] quote over brother Graham said that man
[15:13] was restored back into the church it's
[15:17] hard for us to see because as humans we
[15:19] won't forget that he's always going to
[15:21] be that rascal that lived with his
[15:23] stepmom but if you know what it got
[15:25] clean here slate same way with all of us
[15:31] if we did something to somebody or
[15:32] somebody done something new in your life
[15:34] and that person becomes a born-again
[15:36] Christian he never did it we know he did
[15:40] but he never did that's what we got to
[15:42] understand the steel digit jokes of
[15:44] protection is that the real you did and
[15:49] you repent and God wipe that away but
[15:54] you kept on sinning again right but this
[15:58] form of justification times to here in
[16:00] the field shows grace that God has wiped
[16:03] your slate clean and if you're born
[16:05] again right if you're born again and
[16:07] then you come under here that what
[16:10] happens is is and I'm just doing it for
[16:12] illustration here you come up and you do
[16:15] something wrong okay
[16:18] I can't get off fast enough don't you
[16:21] say that but you know what you're saying
[16:23] and guess what I got doing it you saying
[16:25] and gods going I've been good at all
[16:31] someone or right you're a Samaritan say
[16:39] when you see what I mean you stand and
[16:43] us forgiveness there's no it's not
[16:47] something that stays like that so I said
[16:50] that's a acts of natural nc so pretty
[16:54] that's a natural occurrence but at you
[16:57] your slate is right here your sleep
[17:02] juices claim them that's what we do you
[17:04] know what we did we go with it we go
[17:08] don't we carry with us like I said
[17:13] before I was asking God to give me
[17:15] something to be a long time ago he said
[17:17] can't find it
[17:19] st. Clements in talking about I like
[17:22] that song but then do you know anymore I
[17:24] thought but see if the realization of
[17:26] that is what not it's not that I didn't
[17:30] do it I know I did this part of me did
[17:33] the service part of me did it but that
[17:36] real we never done it and what we got to
[17:39] see about the two lightest we'll ever
[17:40] text that you'll know one thing's for
[17:43] sure your first birth is going to keep
[17:45] reminding you daily but your second
[17:48] birth on the inside going to come about
[17:51] last night in that soul of man if you're
[17:53] born again it is why cannot have a speck
[17:56] of black in it never have expected lemon
[18:00] never Center that is my never better
[18:04] hard to believe cuz you not believing it
[18:06] now heartily but you guys don't do that
[18:10] then God save the group of people that
[18:13] didn't even want television now that
[18:14] nephew leads use but you know what here
[18:17] we go with the onion field that talk to
[18:18] you you didn't want it
[18:23] you didn't want you were not born and
[18:25] five six years old is your daughter all
[18:28] dogs and all you like you know you know
[18:33] what I'm saying this but right now
[18:34] you're going back to your life and going
[18:36] yeah I know what are you talking about
[18:37] things you're going back through what
[18:39] you did but you got to remember that the
[18:42] times that I stopped my brother Tim he
[18:45] does a good job it with a simple message
[18:47] but it was profound Friday night I mean
[18:49] profound about complexes and natures and
[18:54] and you know getting rid of the old and
[18:57] I really like what he said tell somebody
[19:02] that weren't here last night about it
[19:03] but exams at all you know you get those
[19:06] like a jewel that you get to allows you
[19:07] I love you is always me
[19:09] I wet tired the other day on the
[19:11] interstate so I must be punishing me for
[19:13] something he rained a little before
[19:15] buddies they know you can't is Allah
[19:20] Jesus no you don't have black eye you
[19:23] can't blame the things we deserve all of
[19:26] them crazy something mechanical I mean
[19:29] and I don't believe that God can restore
[19:32] mechanical things I don't get me wrong
[19:34] but there's a time and place the fiscal
[19:37] tear up real change the ladder don't you
[19:40] a word out just like us
[19:42] I mean here we are talking about here we
[19:45] are talking about the soul of man man
[19:47] eternal and here we are you know Aaron's
[19:49] in explain and the money going glasses
[19:52] on both feet no hair no it's those stuff
[19:55] so yeah but you know what
[19:58] that was it so that part of us we got to
[20:00] remember that wasn't a part of what God
[20:02] that wasn't the throne thoughts of God
[20:04] the eternal thought that God will touch
[20:06] you in eight year old or 78 year old
[20:08] body not the thoughts of God the eternal
[20:11] part now he thought of you being that

[21:41] life work family what's going to happen
[21:46] tomorrow will appear will still have
[21:47] tomorrow with my house what's going to
[21:49] tear down they call that if you just do
[21:51] that away from our life is be glorious
[21:53] but let's be eternal in heaven Pop's God
[21:56] you know that would be to me heavenly
[22:00] right
[22:02] it would never marry for the Genesis
[22:07] you can ask me sir
[22:11] well I said about that picture that dad
[22:13] got that showing the Bible in two pages
[22:15] flipping open and then it becomes Jesus
[22:17] Christ well not taking Jesus Christ out
[22:20] but because he became the book you will
[22:24] do this you know you can put your
[22:25] picture at the end of that at the end of
[22:28] that piece where it says in the
[22:29] beginning was worth we've gone over
[22:31] buh-bye so that same way with you or not
[22:33] that's for a problem in we've not come
[22:37] close enough to see that any especially
[22:41] plumber of the realms has been gone I
[22:43] told Bob because the brother was saying
[22:47] we'll give me a quote where brother
[22:48] Brown said that it's the first deal with
[22:50] black horse riders organic crops we know
[22:52] that but where it ties justification
[22:55] like we told you what Saul do a book
[22:58] it's a book of redemption
[23:00] it's a book of it's a book of redemption
[23:02] that you and I have for years it's been
[23:04] sealed up but now it's been over so we
[23:08] know I'm gonna step on out and say we
[23:11] know what the Prophet know what we know
[23:13] what the Prophet you about these sales
[23:14] we know that now we don't know many
[23:18] phonies compete with the problem so
[23:21] being in a prophetic age that's what
[23:23] we're going to talk about this stick
[23:24] sale derivative prophets is going to be
[23:27] a prophetic time they're going to speak
[23:31] they're already on Amanda Bible is full
[23:33] of what the judge what you've got the
[23:36] wrath of God and all this done before
[23:38] out of God what words you going to come
[23:40] through he promised most of their lives
[23:43] are going to the Jews because remember
[23:45] we're gone this is nothing to us as far
[23:47] as the natural happening it's reading
[23:50] then I'm to help me and open the sticks
[23:52] he'll blow it was a great earthquake Sun
[23:55] became black as sackcloth of hair we're
[23:57] fixing to see that in about two weeks
[23:58] old solar eclipse just few days from now
[24:04] here it's going to get a little bit dark
[24:06] but in the mountains I said it's going
[24:08] to get real
[24:08] Sharples in that path of getting real
[24:12] dark so the sun's become black as
[24:14] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[24:16] blood regarding the Woodman see so this
[24:19] is tithing giving us a little idea
[24:22] because it's not this right here this is
[24:25] after we're gone this has been natural
[24:27] happening this is going to happen right
[24:29] but there's a spiritual application
[24:30] behind this okay and the stars of heaven
[24:33] fell unto the earth even as a fig tree
[24:35] casteth her untimely figs when she is
[24:37] shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven
[24:40] departed as a scroll but it was roll
[24:42] when when it was rolled together and
[24:45] every mountain and Island were moved out
[24:47] of their places the king to the earth
[24:50] and great man the rich man and chief
[24:51] captain to the mighty men and every
[24:53] bondman and every free man hid
[24:54] themselves in the dens and in the rocks
[24:56] of the mountains and said to the
[24:58] mountains and rocks following us and
[24:59] hide us from the face of him that
[25:01] sitteth on the throne and from the wrath
[25:03] of the lamb they let their I've done see
[25:05] Jesus it little drum and I will see the
[25:11] lamb but where is the lamb go to bed
[25:17] good problem while lambs listen lamb is
[25:21] always connected to Redemption right
[25:24] when you see a lamb sacrifice you're
[25:27] tying it back to ridiculous
[25:29] here is showing the wrath of the lamb
[25:33] through the two prophets because those
[25:35] you go to prophets the 144,000 are going
[25:40] to be like in Goshen but there it will
[25:43] be calling plays down on everything else
[25:45] on the outside I'm going back to the
[25:47] book of Exodus and reading that that
[25:49] truly God separated the people God is
[25:54] the segregate one he does not want us to
[25:57] miss race I'm not going up I'm talking
[26:00] about this - but see there of your
[26:01] natural application will appear not to
[26:02] miss race Baptist Methodist comes often
[26:07] sure we can be a mom only trying to help
[26:09] but in no way
[26:11] well I'm gonna start going to Baptist
[26:13] Church men y'all please people we've
[26:16] heard that before yeah you go to imagine
[26:19] church try to help somebody
[26:20] no but about the money to let them come
[26:22] to you let them come to you you go out
[26:27] there you go get a track and they have
[26:30] nothing
[26:30] God has separated what God did is go out
[26:33] see dojin if you Moses and you know what
[26:36] this is done where they approach the
[26:38] Bible but I can take and piece it
[26:39] together because remember when he called
[26:42] all those plagues if you'll read a book
[26:45] lessons they keep saying that children
[26:46] of ears were in Goshen and this didn't
[26:48] happen so there was a barrier that they
[26:51] do I put up anyoneís and Cody hall
[26:55] locusts do you can't build a bit Hine
[26:56] upkeep locust out you know and all the
[26:59] other things and it was so dark that
[27:01] time but there was lying noting why God
[27:03] had separated the people right so dr.
[27:06] segregation keeper said that he does not
[27:08] want you to mingle with all right we're
[27:11] into world war that's what brings us out
[27:14] instead of mouthing off followed us and
[27:17] how to prevent him sitting enthroned
[27:19] from there at the lamb for the great day
[27:20] of his wrath is come and who shall be
[27:23] able to stand
[27:25] now there's your opening of your 60th
[27:29] right then next Sunday will remind me 24
[27:33] to learn their book they're supposed
[27:35] order but we've already started our
[27:39] bullet points it's only going to happen
[27:42] through two problems right and it looks
[27:47] like to me that it's not going to only
[27:49] happen in the hearts of 144,000 but even
[27:53] nature is going to be controlled this
[27:55] outside of nature look at Moses man go
[27:58] back replay awesome
[28:01] he turned a whole river in the wood and
[28:05] study and then frogs come up out of that
[28:09] water in this thing
[28:12] love this came in the air it was no
[28:14] limit hey okay we can't miss that one
[28:17] they will hail came and beat everything
[28:18] down and then Pharaoh would let them go
[28:21] so the next week Moses goes back
[28:24] yesterday off even though bears didn't
[28:25] know another little doe he says okay
[28:27] darling god bear call locust and the
[28:30] Bible says whatever the hell didn't beat
[28:32] down the locust he said the land was
[28:34] completely barren other words it was all
[28:36] green and lush and pretty several weeks
[28:38] before that and then you look at in two
[28:40] weeks barren wastelands dry but now the
[28:46] one thing dosha was put through that
[28:49] that's the same way meeting you
[28:50] you are not going to be that goes
[28:53] remember when the children of Israel
[28:55] came out of Egypt they have problem
[28:57] right they died they got to eat the
[29:00] surfer got bit my surface they got there
[29:02] they got that right
[29:03] why because they turns on down but God
[29:05] protected that group of people saying I
[29:08] was you and I why brother camel tone
[29:09] that you know this is his whole message
[29:11] was on suffering you gotta suffer
[29:14] terrain get supper to rule you got
[29:16] through suffering he looked at home out
[29:18] talk about suffering which is great but
[29:21] sometimes we do have P parties you know
[29:24] about this one pound he did eighty
[29:27] difficult Sun shines on you one day that
[29:29] meeting like you friend he did just go
[29:32] - lightning and thunder and the wind's
[29:34] blowing doesn't mean it doesn't turn you
[29:36] down
[29:36] in other words like I'm going to sign up
[29:38] both of them dr. Sankar you know I mean
[29:43] we do that we go to a trial of wheat and
[29:46] listen but now what brother Hamilton is
[29:47] whole point was whatever we go through
[29:51] it were the children of God whatever we
[29:52] go through at that end of that trial we
[29:57] will be better if it was of God because
[30:00] it was chastisement of God to get us
[30:02] back in line now if it was just a Carm
[30:04] it was bald and you wonder why the world
[30:06] the thing look well you need Bob
[30:10] high-class you know it's the same
[30:12] balding up you know or a whole letting
[30:15] go buddy a powder it's not God's fault
[30:17] Paul either yeah I wrote them that easy
[30:22] glare out how does the one I call
[30:25] college go after the garden bland I
[30:28] don't want to let all this fall so
[30:30] anyway we Alto same thing will be sealed
[30:33] if you don't really understand and just
[30:35] try and get the first part get the
[30:38] natural happening that's what I'm trying
[30:40] to do it's going to the natural
[30:41] happening to the fifth seal is going to
[30:43] be to the Jew but it has a spiritual
[30:45] implication for you enough and it will
[30:49] change your body so this one we're going
[30:51] to talk about now it's going to talk
[30:53] about your nature
[30:54] not the nature of the outside world with
[30:56] your nature that will be my been
[30:59] something and we had a good times on the
[31:01] roof and not only that is that that
[31:04] our system and that
[31:06] the second box you know they're related
[31:09] in the restaurant they are real wildly
[31:13] prohibit outside you said they were
[31:17] gonna say Amazing Grace and I thought
[31:25] you guys never get out of that that's
[31:31] right
[31:31] so think about that yeah the bakelite
[31:36] there's an actual happening that's going
[31:38] to happen this is definitely when were
[31:40] gone these two prophets are going to
[31:42] absolutely make this happen because it's
[31:44] going to come right out of their mouths
[31:46] and what more than the spirit of Moses
[31:48] and Elijah that same spirit be called it
[31:51] whatever here the first time Moses just
[31:55] what I told you all the place moving
[31:57] Eliezer same thing like to call down
[32:01] halogen nothing rain and all these
[32:03] things fire came out of heaven there
[32:05] Mount Carmel and all things like that so
[32:08] their nature tells us that they're going
[32:09] to be able to what know what nature can
[32:12] do know what dog's mind is and to my
[32:18] auntie other things that what do you
[32:19] think that filled with the Holy Ghost
[32:20] now the two properties I don't believe
[32:23] that simply because if they're filled
[32:26] only goes right now when we go to wrap
[32:28] so they got to go with oh yeah right
[32:31] they got to go with us so they're going
[32:32] to have to receive it now they may be in
[32:34] the message but remember the brother
[32:37] over there now the intro he started them
[32:40] soma Jacobs tournaments and here man his
[32:43] son gets their permanent
[32:46] travesty say brothers stood right here
[32:48] Church you know it was opening but the
[32:50] messy church up in Israel your every
[32:54] yeah never years ago about yeah it's a
[33:00] whole thing just like what the people
[33:02] can't understand I'm telling you the
[33:03] teaching of the message is not getting
[33:05] to the people so they're being
[33:08] frustrated they're being they're being
[33:10] taught by false shepherds there are
[33:13] questions in the message that people
[33:14] cannot answer so what do they do
[33:17] what brother Brown must be wrong if he
[33:20] said there's they meant that he meant
[33:22] dish instead now to anyway so that
[33:24] brothers not measure so we can't count
[33:25] that message churches being anything
[33:27] where the do property come come on I'll
[33:28] buy they could be sitting in a message
[33:30] to church they could have been sitting
[33:31] at church and got justified sanctified
[33:35] know that but they will be bibble that
[33:38] holy goes into it because remember
[33:40] brother Brian said the Holy Ghost comes
[33:41] off of the Gentiles and turn to come
[33:43] drop back not only do why when it leaves
[33:46] this earth we're leaving with it we're
[33:51] leaving with it so the holy don't stay
[33:53] on is open to the Gentile you here one
[33:55] man to the Jindo and see what that's
[33:57] what's going to happen to I just thought
[34:00] of this it rule it's going to be over
[34:02] there in a laughing ocean relapsed into
[34:07] what the tribulation starts in American
[34:09] works its way to Israel so it's going to
[34:11] have a proud prosperity and actually I
[34:13] believe the whole world going to look to
[34:14] Israel so they're not going to have any
[34:16] problems there's nothing going to happen
[34:18] the prophets are not just going to call
[34:20] fire down in Israel Americans of the
[34:25] size to do something but yeah
[34:30] well you know earthquake over here all I
[34:34] gotta do these two properties just got
[34:35] away you know get a while get the
[34:38] thought of God that something's gonna
[34:39] happen China's getting ready to blow you
[34:40] all away well let's just give them the
[34:43] hailstorm for about three days and see
[34:47] how they survive because that's what
[34:48] they do probably some visitor we said he
[34:50] was so narrow-minded we think well there
[34:52] is going to be and Israel difficult Cole
[34:54] down a little things no no no no you see
[34:56] that right there the kings of the earth
[34:59] and the great men and the rich men and
[35:04] the chief captains and the mighty man
[35:05] ever bottom of every map no one hiding
[35:13] you drop you inherit no I don't not go
[35:16] to be a heaven but man another dimension
[35:19] I'll be an instrument but look at other
[35:23] stages is release the kings of the earth
[35:25] so this whole earth is gonna be
[35:26] tormented that's why the whole earth is
[35:29] going to give gifts when the two
[35:31] problems are killed the Bible says that
[35:32] the whole world started beating each
[35:34] other here won't cancel
[35:36] in other words CNN and Fox News they're
[35:39] all be there with their cameras
[35:40] programmed and all over the world hey
[35:42] these two people that tormented us
[35:44] they're finally dead
[35:45] and then while that cameras still open
[35:47] the bottle says three days they raise it
[35:49] up and they leave so then guess what
[35:54] that's when the wrath really followed on
[35:56] everybody but see integral will be in
[35:58] goshen just like God promised over there
[36:00] while Moses was on the same there was it
[36:02] going while the Elijah was on the scene
[36:05] there was a widow woman there was a
[36:09] widow woman that everybody started to
[36:11] death and every time she went and dipped
[36:13] into the tendons of oil and dipped into
[36:15] the end of the flour
[36:17] another spoke another difficult came
[36:20] back up yeah he's in your crews will
[36:22] never run dry and your flower pot will
[36:25] never run dry
[36:26] so what she'd dip it out make some more
[36:28] she man had a good program going she may
[36:30] give it to the community who knows to
[36:32] keep them huh but remember she was cute
[36:34] what saved from the blade by what
[36:37] property
[36:39] these because they are judgment to the
[36:41] outside world but you know what to
[36:43] integral 144,000
[36:45] salvation comes to those who profits
[36:48] where'd you get those starters the Bible
[36:50] says there I'll read next under thing
[36:51] made Ezekiel says where'd you get those
[36:53] Jeremiah says where'd you get those card
[36:55] well then I'll go see Jesus they don't
[36:57] see Jesus through two products - problem
[37:00] is going to reveal to them that they're
[37:01] the ones until Jesus Christ and this is
[37:03] why this is happening you are going to
[37:06] be 500 44,000 we order to profit and in
[37:11] a 1260 days we're gonna get out of here
[37:14] see they have a time we don't we don't
[37:18] know where but man I'll tell ya I'm just
[37:20] oh yeah twelve hours if you day don't
[37:23] now you know yes I would like to feel
[37:26] any reason any way I was body that
[37:30] you'll be where's that yes will fill a
[37:36] little little tribulation before we get
[37:38] out of here but it won't be tribulation
[37:41] of the wrath of God it will be
[37:43] tribulation it's brought on America
[37:46] because remember all that we know it's
[37:48] going to come to two prophets but what
[37:50] we promised last night so by the arm
[37:52] again but you have posted yet okay until
[37:56] we leave it with but when we leave it
[37:58] went on that's going to be our
[38:01] protection yeah we out goat you it's
[38:04] about building the logo dunark ocean
[38:06] that our land of the ocean we're
[38:08] promised protection go say years over
[38:11] now he did everything else but he can't
[38:13] get to that song thank you yes this
[38:15] message to me is just blended and that's
[38:19] why we need to go but only men

[38:27] we will not be here when those profits
[38:30] in our region and here here did you make
[38:32] Arab brothers
