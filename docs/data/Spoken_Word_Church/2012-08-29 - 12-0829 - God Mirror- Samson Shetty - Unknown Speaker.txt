allowed permitted to die you know right and he helped us in a miraculous way amen a brother i mean a man you're a first uh a guy just running came there and you know he served us that's i believe that's the perfect will of god right and god gave me a chance to see all the precious brothers existed in the country of the united states amen amen praise the lord my dear brothers and sisters uh at the age of 13 i was an atheist i'm not believing any god any devil any spirit in nothing i'm not believing in prayer i'm not believing going to the church because i went i tried to see god i tried to talk to god and i i would like to talk to him and let him talk to me i tried my best and some of my friends said uh you have to go to this temple and worship and god will appear to you and he speak to you so i did that i broken some coconuts and i did some you know prayers to the hindu goddesses in the hindu temples but i didn't find any god right so my christian brothers christian friends told me that let us go to the church and sit and worship the lord and he will appear and he will talk to you no god i went to the church i didn't see any god there and i went to the muslim mosque i tried each religion because we have a multi you know lots of religious people in the country of india so i try my best to go all places and worshipping god and lift i would like to see god but you know i i failed right so then i finally at the age of 13 what i'm thinking there is no god no devil no spirit nothing so this is all i just i was thinking like that this is all the stories you know world schools right and i'm thinking that uh after after i become you know big you know i mean after i become young uh you know then i want to become a movie director that's what's my plans but thanks to

communist thing you know and his intentions and he he always teach the people tell the people there is no god no devil nothing so that was influenced me a lot many times right so so you know i become like uh you know not believing any god so one day i'm trying to find my friend at my area at the same time the same year some of the young ministers all the young brethren 13 15 20 25 30. all the young minister brothers they just left the pentecostal church and just renting you know three rooms building at my place in my area and having services every day and the revival is going on like praising and worshiping and casting out the demons and killing the sick people and there are great miraculous things are happening in that area so everybody you know everybody is you know you know having a great uh you know um you know uh uh feeling about this brother right so uh i thought uh my friend was sitting right there with these people so i went over there with my cousin and my friend

tell me about god my grandma and all i said no way i hated school i threw my bag my books and uh i was so mischievous boy to my parents so disobedient and uh at the age of 13 i'm thinking like a 30 years man yeah praise god hallelujah but that was not right hallelujah so my dear brothers and sisters i went to that place with my cousin and i talked to the brothers they are praising and worshipping the lord and dancing in the spirit and you know clapping hands and playing drums and that was really really wonderful but i am not in that atmosphere right yeah i'm just out of that atmosphere i'm just laughing inside of me you know you said i'm i'm laughing myself that these people are not having any you know any brains you know just breaking you know time pass and doing these things so uh i asked the brother to come and pray for my cousin because you know my cousin always uh afraid of uh demons and devils you know in the darkness in the nighttime so i asked the brother to come and pray for my cousin and the brother he just walked forward and he said heal in the name of jesus christ and my cousin fell down yeah and he stood up again and he said again like that here in the name of jesus christ and again my cousin fell down like that 40 times my cousin fell down and i'm just watching that and i asked the brother what is this amen what is this happening here what's happening here and he said this is the power of almighty god this is the power of jesus christ i said i don't believe that this is i think you are making hypnotizing yeah you are hypnotizing this man so that's why it's failing down and you're doing this and that hallelujah praise lord i don't believe that then he said no sir this is the power of god so then i asked him uh would you pray for me then he said oh yeah and he just lifted hands and praising the lord and he said healing the name of jesus christ i fell down nobody touched me nobody pushed me i fell down and i was so scared to death and when i woke up when i stood up total my body shaking like crazy yeah yeah i thought what happened to me who who pushed me yeah nobody you know the brothers were right there and my cousins standing right there nobody pushed me and he said here in the name of jesus christ again i fell down oh my lord and he said heal in the name of jesus christ fell down oh my god what's happening here yeah and he said this is the power of god amen all the demonic powers devils poses to me right with all kinds of different uh you know uh intentions i got all kinds of devil spirits you know and god is delivering me miraculous way in the name of the lord jesus christ amen glory so when when when when i stood up and i said let's brother what's this and he said this is the power so he prayed i asked him to pray and he prayed i i fell down for five times and i asked him to pray and he prayed and i didn't spoke to anyone i was totally became calm silent i went i left my other place and i went home and uh all the night he couldn't sleep right i'm just thinking of that thinking of that early in the morning i ran to that brother and asked what happened to me brother and he started preaching the gospel of jesus christ from the holy word yes sir and then after you know uh day by day you know daily i'm going there every day i'm going there and one day you know all right they are praying and also i also kneeled down and prayed with them and i gave my heart to the lord i returned from my sister i'm trying to become a movie director i'm trying to become an atheist i'm trying to become a something else but god changed my plans and now i can preach i can tell the people i can testify what is god amen it is not uh like uh uh a substance right it is not a matter right god is not a matter right not a substance right god is a supernatural right he is a power amen i deal with many communist people i i deal with some you know military people in the country of india in our area they don't believe in god sure yeah one day they came to me and they asked me did you show me god i said sir excuse me i want to ask you a question before i show you god uh do you feel hungry he said yes sir do you feel thirsty yes sir can i see you're hungry can i see you're thirsty what color it is how much big how much light what color let me see that and he said no there is no color how i don't believe that so i don't want to if you feel hungry don't ask for food so then my dear brothers and sisters like that god is a supernatural feeling amen it's a personal revelation amen right it's not known by our education not by our power not by our human abilities not by our knowledge not by our own thinking right that is not by any human thing right it's only by supernatural or personal revelation of jesus christ amen hallelujah so my dear brothers and sisters uh i give my heart to the lord by god's grace god who is rich in mercy he didn't allow me to die even i was in my mother's womb right and he all he he brought me to this upon this earth to live and gave me a chance to see all the precious saints and also my dear brothers and sisters i i repented for my sins right and i give my heart to the lord and re-baptized on june 28 wednesday evening at six o'clock in year 1995 by god's grace amen then after that the lord is dealing with me by dreams by scriptures by by by by the prophecies right some of the message people some of the denominational people pentecostal people prophesied about me about my calling and after i prayed and i asked the lord something burning inside of me to preach the gospel to do something for the kingdom of god so i don't know what to do but something is in me that is thriving that is you know i have a burden for the kingdom of god so then i feel to preach i feel to testify about the lord jesus christ but i don't know how to do that some of the brothers told me god is speaking with you well god is speaking to you by prophecies by deservers and also by the scriptures by the dreams and also you have to make sure you're calling an election right right it is not easy to do the ministry right see my plans are different and god's plans are
