TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning everybody good morning good morning um we give thanks for this day you've given us to come together and worship in your preciousness father God just ask that you come on the scene this morning and bless each one here and forgive us of our sins and just touch your heart father God and be with each one of these words that you never leave us a forsake because we believe in Word we asked father God that you bless bride around the world and the bride here at home this morning and bless those that couldn't be here today with them colds and all the pollen that's going on and the fact that in my lives and homesick and the rest of us not here today this bless them and be a little bit whatever's holding them back or hindering father God we know you're worthy we'll move them on and so when it says you touch investment in a special way and especially being with Brother Dean this morning as he uh he went under the surgery we're calling for a good report father God we've asked him we've asked it in your name convey your word with it Lord and we expect to hear a good report from Brother Dean and bless sister Pagan just lift her up and give them your faith and be with Brother Gary and brother Danny and the sister back is there down there with uh sister Peggy and this lesser fellowship with one another and been with the Lord with joyous thoughts on their heart is only the word you can bring and we ask you to be with brother Wade and yeah I had sister June and brother Josh is I don't know if they've made it back or not yet Lord but we've called for them to come back home safely and I believe they'll be here and I just ask you bless this little church here today Father God if you send that in the Holy Spirit to be with us Lord and bless your word as it comes forward there ain't no other place to be today for me on the face of this Earth and right here to hear your precious word and she told me to come here and Lord nothing in this life of mine has ever been anything more to me than this word that you brought me from this little wooden building here my precious brother and I asked Lord that you just bless us here today and bless our fellowship yes don't let us say anything or do anything to harm or hinder anybody you just come home to say now bless your word and we ask these things in heavy way with us father God just take all the weight with us let these vessels be yours that you created father God you disclaim them and I asked in Your Name Lord Jesus Christ amen oh amen uh I had a little thought last night I was cranking about several things and all the things that brother Dale's been preaching on and the wonderful things that brother Wade has been doing here in Sunday school this morning in the mornings about the Brazil's and all and he's taking it so slow and I love that and uh I'm enjoying it it's been the heights of my visitation here at this church in Lewis is what's coming for this day you can see the progression of the word is the same word but the Revelation is greater it's got to be greater Brother Ray because what we got here is not getting it done and so it's just coming more and more before I forget it's on my mind we're going to talk about the six stages or the six raptures in the Bible this morning a little bit I'm not going to keep you alone and uh I I just hope that we all can open up and I would say to all of you here I I've been doing something lately and it's really helping me a lot is to take brother Dale seals the increase in 83 and I've been going over and listening to them and I've tried to listen to him a couple times before and I'm telling you I just really didn't understand them and uh of course what listens brother around sales and and you've got to have a good foundation before you can really understand and then you go back to brother Dale's and listen to what he's brought it's just so simple uh and each of those seals and I would I would say to all of you that if you'll just take the time sit down and just listened to his seals that he preached in 83 will help us a lot brother Wade comes out and gets into the first seal second seat on third seal you'll have a lot better understanding and you'll be more prepared because scripture says we got to study and show ourselves to prove so I mean we can stand here and chat we'll message all day long to take one lady become message people that I know of and that's to get into this right here the little book we gotta eat it right and that's all we can do so let's start with uh the six Raptors that they're talking it's in the Bible this is uh this is actually an article from the message Chronicle that I picked it up last night now I had a thought God woke me up the other morning and give me a little thought uh actually I was doing what my pastor had told me to do said you get woke up in the middle nicely just pray for me that will put you back sleep every time well it's got to worry don't do that you know and that's a good thing because I get to pray for everybody here when that happens I don't I try not to leave a name out and if I do uh forgive me I get it the next time so uh I believe that's what we got to do as brothers and sisters in here because there's a couple of things that's helping the church also to me the way I see it and part of it is our little things that we have our denominations that we have with each other that we shouldn't have we should just totally love each other and be kind of one another and um you know for us to get to that stage we have to be at that stage so the seals can come on and do their job for this place and then we'll be out of here but anyway uh I believe that we also first of all love one another and be kind of one another and that's that's my heart to all of you here this morning because I look at faces I hear that woman looking at me and one of you that I don't love and I can also say it and I don't know you but I know I love you who you are where you come bro but uh anyway let's let me get on into this because I don't want to go that direction I want to get into these these raptures I found it an interesting article so I said well maybe I'll talk about it a little bit and of course I got to the filth Rapture and I got to put my little message back in here that the Lord woke me up the other morning and give me and I sat there and I you know sometimes you know you're sitting there talking and you and the Lord's talking to me he's he'll uh I'll be praying for him one of y'all to hear in the church and all of a sudden I would start going off and I'll start he'll start giving me stuff to talk or this the sermon I guess is I don't know it's not a sermon it just tells me what he wants me to say a lot of times and I'll sit there and I'll I'll think about it and I'll start saying it and then all of a sudden I look up 45 minutes on the clock is gone and I think I'm awake but I know it must be dreaming it or something because it just keeps coming I said well where's my pen and beats paper I need to write that down or I need a uh you know a recorder to catch all that because it's so wonderful how he just comes in and this sews it right up ties it right up and then I try to get up and repeat it and I mess it all up but anyway it's a wonderful thing when that happens and I believe the Lord is here um we had a good time yesterday over there at the uh assisted living home and uh heard some good singing right uh piano was a little bit often when she was in a flat uh finally a brother on the guitar with me he said Donald got to go on down the sea she's she's about that far off with it I'm watching my hands and that was about true so you know but like brother Joe always says Lord will provide and he did we had a wonderful time uh but anyway let me get on into this because I'll be talking all day long about getting to what I'm supposed to be getting to uh first of all I want to go to any Bibles uh go to Genesis 524. in the first Rapture that we know of there is Enoch and we're just going to leave a little scripture there for a few minutes then I'm gonna move on to the other one each one I was gonna pull up some stuff on brother brown but my computer has been down at the house and it's had a lot of little issues and brother Josh has been trying to help me out with it uh but I was not able to pull up any of his quotes So this this one I'm bringing is is from Brother Bama so we're all good with that right because I like to we have an edge of profit coming and told us these things or else we wouldn't understand them so anyway let's go to Genesis 5 24. and let's see I brought my big Letter Bible so I could see a little bit this morning anyway and he got walked with God and he was not for God took him now we know that what happened right there it was someone with God that he just took him out of here and I want to go to the next one which was Elijah number two second Kings 2 11. Enoch the pyramid Builder okay to the marketing a little help me out a little bit uh okay Second Kings 2 11. and it came to pass as they still went on and talked that behold their period of Chariot of fire and Horses of fire and parted them both asunder and Elijah went up the world went into heaven and Elijah saw it and he cried my father my father the chair of Israel and the horsemen thereof and he saw him no more and he took up or he took hold of his own clothes and rent them in two pieces and he took up also the mandal of Elijah that fell from him and he went back and stood by the bank of Jordan and he took the mantle of Elijah that he fell from him and smoked the waters and said where is the Lord God of Elijah and when he had smitten the waters they parted hither and thither and Elijah went over amen we know what that means that was a carrying away that's what the Rapture is is the carrying away of a person to another place or sphere of existence uh the arcade part definition of it is the act of carrying off uh the Third Elijah or the third Rapture I'm sorry uh Matthew 27 50 53 . this is the Old Testament Saints Matthew 27 50 53 I believe is what I'm going to read everybody ready Jesus when he had cried again with a loud voice yielded up The Ghost and behold the veil of the temple was written and planned from the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks ran and the Grays were open and many bodies of the Saints would slap a rose and came out of the Braves after the resurrection and went into the holy city and appeared unto many now last night I was reading that and I didn't know that when the when when he he cried out the earthquake and they're about to Veil being around that's theirs but I never called it that those Graves were cracked and those Saints came out at that time that's right and I I didn't I sat now look at that I said that's that's special right there that's wonderful because that's gonna happen with us that's good it's already been it's already been written so it's going to happen the next one the fourth rapture was Jesus Christ in the book of Acts one man through 11. foreign nine and eleven and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud received him out of their sight and while they looked steadfastly toward heaven as he went up to hold two men stood by by them in white apparel which also said he men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven this same Jesus which is taken up from you into heaven shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven now I don't know about y'all but I I see myself there doing that I know there's many times that my daddy come to me about a lot of things and that's what we're talking about here headship having correct headship I remember a lot of times my daddy telling me a lot of things to go do things and and me not do it and I can see me and my brother Tommy standing there gazing off somewhere not doing what was told and him coming up side the head say go do what I told you just simply go do what I tell you that's what God does with us and sometimes you know I I can testify to myself that uh I am hard-headed and the Lord has got my attention many times and he has a way about you know jerking your chain a little bit it's uh it hasn't always I think that I know a lot of times that he don't just up and say now you need to go on up and do what I told you to he's not going to do that he's going to scream it go do it what I told you to and that's what he's telling us today come give the word supposed to do whatever it is in this church because you never know when you're not here it's a battle getting here every day live what the Lord tells you to do is simple but it's a hard battle because so many times in the mornings now this morning I knew I was going to have to be here and I would have beat the doors down at six o'clock this morning and I'm not an early Rising folks but when I know that I've got to be here you know I've been asked to be here I'm going to be here did my partner and uh hope I don't bore you with none of this I've seen this and I thought to myself I said what a what a wonderful thing just to talk about in the Sunday school class is a rapture um and doing what we're told by his word that's Grace because you can understand Christ I was talking to God the other day about talking to a real hard trinitarian at Theologian this guy's a theologian he's Theologian to the Core and I asked him to explain to me why they had two baptisms in the Bible the difference between being so smart I said you you explained it to me why did Jesus say do it this way here and wanted after the baptism of the Holy Ghost came and the word is done put in had been put in these people for three and a half years why did they come out and say it this way and they also underlined it to me in big letters standing out flashing lights if you don't do it this way you can't get there and they just looked at me he says well this teaches me this way and I'm going to stay there I said okay You've Been Told and that's a good thing when you tell people and they tell you that because you know one day you're gonna see him again and that's being disobedient they're sitting there and taking whatever they throw out there to you I would want to know if something is different in this Bible I I mean you got to know we got to know and like I said thank God he sent us a profit but give us these answers to these things because I pretty much folks I'll tell y'all something I pretty much in my heart I've given up I'm a Baptist in the Methodist at least could look at a Jew and say they believe in one God that's all there is there's other mythical Gods out there in comic books and things but there's only one God it's greater didn't know much didn't know hardly anything about this guy called Jesus Christ but I did understand one God that part of it which was only a part it wasn't all of it by far anyway that's the fourth Rapture the fifth Rapture um I want to start out right here and I wanted to build a little reading on this uh we'll go back actually to the fourth rapture uh I'm gonna go ahead and go to this one I'm gonna read some of this right here uh just for a minute the filth Rapture is that which is spoken of in Thessalonians 1 4 16 and First Corinthians 15 51. and concerns the catching away of a true bride-believing Christians who had received the message that God sent to them for the day of Pentecost through the contents of the seven Church ages of Hill today now that's the body of Believers is composed of the Saints who have died during the Ephesians Smyrna Improvement dietary Philadelphian and The Layover seeing Church ages with the living saints that are still alive in our age all these Saints are bound to meet the Lord I've had my strength a little bit to read this because the writing is so small uh because of the Rapture time these are the dead in Christ which shall first come then which are alive and remain shall be called up together with them in the clouds made him in the air now how do we get there in this field in this filth Rapture which is the Bride of Jesus Christ first of all we already know just like it just said there was a group come through these churches all of them come through the seventh churches all of us did and I want to go back to Malachi 4 . and I'm just going to touch on this minute and move on to the scriptures that uh that's going to bring us the tractor Malachi 4 5. behold I will send you you talk to me Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the Earth with a curse we all know that that's a promise the Old Testament in the New Testament that he's going to do that so that's got to be done now we all know the part that's John the Baptist and where the Prophet fits in the Revelation 10 7 guy you know who he is okay now I want to live up to Revelations 10 7 will this hopeless thought there just for a second all of you read it with me because these are very important but in the days of the voice the seven angels when he shall begin the sound the mystery of God one mystery shall be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets now we know that was brother Brown the Lord working in brother Brown of us fourth Covenant of Elijah I don't know that right okay now the promise was made there in Malachi Revelations 10 7 has happened it's already happened now we get to the other part Luke 17 30. sure you all know it but I still love reading it let's live Luke 17 31 kind of gets your attention but Luke 17 30. actually let's go to Luke 17 29. but the same day that light went out of Sodom it rained and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all even thus shall it be in the days when the son of man is revealed now you can look today if you can't see what's out there I really ain't against those people out there they just don't know any better you know they really don't uh some I it's it's always sat in my heart that just this message is not for everybody it's only for a small catching away with people and it's a sad thing to see that's why we all must be kind of uh and you know to these people because they're not called I mean you can go through Walmart you can sit there and watch them come in our store every day and I sit there and talk to them and I'll say Lord bless them when they walk out the door because they're keeping us going and for whatever reason this is like this I mean he knew that Del wouldn't accept it but it is a very small catch in the way and we're very select left group of people and it really kind of hurts my heart when I sometimes uh get frustrated with the cares of life or being at the shop see things that happen and you see them little Spirits start jumping like little monkeys between trees and one of them lands on your shoulder and you don't brush your mouth right quick feel like you do things and then something will stop you and say hey you get rid of that go right on in there and come back and apologize and that's happened it does happen to me and I'm sitting there and I'm so ashamed one day I walked out there and I said something I shouldn't have said and I knew it I knew it was wrong this wasn't something devil been beating on me about two weeks about and I said why are you being on me I shouldn't be letting this happen I'm a Child of God he's already been whooped I don't know what my problem is my problem is a lack of faith it's a lack of word I got to get rid of this this ain't right it don't fit the shoes too tight blisters on my feet and it's hurting Okay so I mean it happened that quick and it almost as an employee of mine standing there when I did it and as soon as it happened I said something I shouldn't have said and the next thing that happened he was looking at me straight in the eye and he was one of them little doubting demons but he saw something I know he did because I started crying I just my tears started running down my eyes I said I'm so ashamed you forgive me you forgive me for what I just said that was wrong now I'm going to go ask the Lord to forgive me and he told me he said you don't have to ask me I said yes I do that's where your mom and I do have to ask people and I went in and of course I asked the Lord to forgive me and it burned me a while a good while until these things that we have to grow and we have to know not to do these things because we're a special group of people by his grace I mean I know that I was born in sin I know who I am I look this man in the mirror I ain't no goodie two shoes folks but it's his word that says I am amen now I'd rather hold on to God's word than I had to hold on to this vanity thing because God's word I mean if I had a choice of standing on Heaven standing on Earth or standing on God's word for eternity y'all know what I'm gonna stand on that word his word he knows that's the only thing that's going to hold up that's right so I'll take his word he said it about me right and so I'm gonna believe what he said because I know who I am I'm a failure you're waiting to happen every day I wake up that's right so you know we all must just be proud of who we are and the word we've heard if you didn't hear another word today what would you do what would you do what if I come in here and shut this church down that brother down another way and all the other people here and Scattered us around what would you do have you remembered enough no Dolly from California amen that's right I was talking to a brother Mark I mean you stop thinking ain't no accident folks he's seen this before the foundation of the world what he was going to have to do to get us here all of us here this day we're a special group of people amen if God made for you who can be against you that's the that's the way you've got to be okay otherwise we're still going to be going to church I'm from getting out of here and I know I'll tell you all right now I know I'm not ready but I ask Lord whatever it takes you have to drag me down the street to get me ready hook me up right today because nothing else matters okay win the fifth now but Luke 17 30 and this is two scriptures that just make my day I love them I really do is it time let me finish this okay uh first Thessalonians 4 16. so you won't do that on the stable description that I got and finish this y'all forgive me first Thessalonians 4. uh 416. there ain't no point that's right well we'll start at 15. let's go to 14. and then I'm gonna I'm gonna hit this right quick for if we believe that Jesus died rose again do we amen amen here amen even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him for this we say unto you by word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout or the voice of an archangel and the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first then we meet which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air and some shall we ever be with the Lord now that's the filtering that's his promise his word that's my scripture don't ever ask what my scripture that's my scripture I believe that with all my heart he showed me that that brought a circle now the sixth Rapture is the two witnesses which are Moses and Elijah we're not going to have time to read it because that clock set ahead is the two witnesses and there'll be three signs that come in the fifth Rapture first of all it'll be the Lord himself shall shout is one well the voice is two and the the horse on the Archangel and the third is the Trump that he will be so I hope that we've learned something this morning about the raptures there's six of them and we all got a meeting dope uh we're gonna continue the people in Japan in prayer and there's an earthquake and tsunami and a tsunami Trail was so fast like 600 miles an hour in it hit California too yeah and I told him yesterday they probably didn't understand what I'm saying but I said okay all the things happen in the world he said it's legal than you think yeah we're giving a message but I don't know what we're giving them but I'll tell you all this the other morning I told Monday
