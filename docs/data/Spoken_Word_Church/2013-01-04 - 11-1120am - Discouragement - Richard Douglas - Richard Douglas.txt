you have Liberty now father now come and speak to us father for we give it to you for your glory and for your honor for we ask it in Jesus Christ's name amen and amen you may receive amen praise God he said why why are my soul my Souls down so you know every time I believe many of us go through this battle of discouragement and David here being a little discouraged and you know with maybe things not going like he thought they were to go like a lot of times we we think we get in our mind you know we get in our mind this is the way it ought to go this is the way it ought to be this is the way it ought to happen and then you know and it don't happen like we think it ought to happen brother Donnie and and you know sometimes it discourages because you know we're thinking through a carnal mind sometimes and you know I'm glad Paul said that we can let he said let this mind that was in Christ be in you amen and he told us he said cast down every imagination and bring every thought Under The Obedience of Jesus Christ so you know I believe the pride has come to the Ace of where she ought to think like God Walk Like God live like God and be so so close and hit her her attributes and her everything she does should be so much like God that she should be and she should almost be mistaken for God that's right amen because you know the prophet was you know you know he was mistaken for him but he was just a man like me and you but I'm thankful for this one that God wants to live that same life because the prophet left don't mean that lives left don't mean the Holy Ghost is left that life is still here to live live in me and you and to bring me and you to bring forth the fruits that he has need of in this season I'm so thankful that he didn't go by us in curses but he he blessed us because you know he cursed a fig tree and I believe the curses have been upon the church world because of her rejection of the truth you know and she thinks she's walking in truth but yet she's blind but that's another said but we want to talk this morning about discouragement uh I like what my pastor said one time he was talking at the ministers meeting with his dinner and he's talking about how that Satan had this great this great auction he was auctioning the things that he used the weapons that he used against every everybody that that was affected and used and he had all of them sitting out there and he had one covered up and he began to tell him he began to tell the devil the the demons this one here is lust it works on many people but it don't work on a lot of people this was lying it works on many people but it don't work on everybody this one's cheating and they said well you know that we want these but sit we're interested in that one that you've got covered up out here what is this he said oh you can't have this one this is one of my my greatest weapons that I had they said well well you sure want to see what it is we want to know what this weapon you you have that you that he works on you and you say it works on everybody and he said well back and I'll let you see just exactly what it is and he said this is my weapon called discouragement and this morning I would like to talk about discouragement because we see that even even with Jonah when we see that Jonah he wanted to go down he wanted to go down to Tarsus and God wanted him to go down to Nineveh and you know he had to work out the plan of God a lot of people you know Brothers said John was backslidden but no he was he was just he had just got out of the will of God he had a desire to say a lot of times ministers we get out of the will of God in the things we do and you know he God had told him just go down at Nineveh and preach I'm going to be with you I'm going to look out for you I'm gonna I'm gonna be your help I'm gonna be the one that will keep you and help you through this time but little did he know that was it was all God's plan for him to get on that ship go down to tarshas because see God had that plan because he had he had when Jesus come he was going to use Jonah as an illustration see he said as Jonah was in the bed of the whale three days so shall the son of man be in the belly of the earth see Jonah didn't know that God was working that permission will of God into his perfect will and see when he got on that boat you know old Jonah said well you know I don't want to go down there you know I don't want to go down and preaching that crowd and you know there are a bunch of healings and more Gentiles they won't listen to me they'll probably kill me Lord and God you're a merciful god and he's a merciful god but you know he got down there he got on that ship he went on down they told him they said sleep how can you be asleep and they're fixing to destroy him he said I know what's going on I realize it's because me that this trouble has come on you and a lot of times we don't realize because our actions sometimes not only affects us but it affects others and you know a long time we like to say this whole thing uh Ministry loves company you know but we don't want to be we don't want to live a miserable Christian Life we want to live a joyful and a peaceful life in Christ Jesus so here's Jonah here he is uh and they they bring him up there and he says just are you sure because they figured out he was a man of God you sure because he was they respected this man because they seen God was on him God wanted he was gonna he was going to do what God wanted him to do he said so just throw me over just throw me a list of wait a minute you sure it won't stop till you do till you get me out of here gotta tear this ship up he's determined to get it get me over there the name of him and so he throwed him over and here's a great fish prepared for him and here he goes down there and all because of the grace of grace of God and you know Jonah didn't realize that he was in the will of God he began to sit down in there and I believe I believe he got a little discouraged down there in the building that old whale because you know he had nothing to rain but no seaweed and no stomach and all that old acids and seven they're already sitting down in there and he said Lord I do remember what Solomon's praying he said if you're people are in trouble if I'll turn my head toward the temple and cry I'll hear from God so this morning we don't have a certain Temple or a certain church we turn to but we have a greater Temple the temple called Jesus Christ we can turn to him in our time of distress in our time of discouragement and he began to pray and here it was three days later he'd probably he probably didn't know what was always going on he probably didn't understand everything but here's this big old here's this big old fish this comes up on the bank well he didn't know he had a one-way express Ticket I mean look here he already had a bus for him he used his whale to push him right on Overton to Nineveh and so he'd bring him over here Here Comes this great big old well up on the bank holds his mouth and out walks a man a man preaching hell fire and brimstone and they said oh my goodness and you know that that they worshiped a fish God right right and he preached such a message under such an anointing that even they put sackcloth on the on the animals and here they repented and God has sent him down there gonna see that they repented because God is a merciful god he always brings warning before he brings judgment and here Jonah sees that God's merciful and he gets discouraged again you know preachers are probably the moodiest people you've ever I'm not used to these sunglasses but you know preachers are Moody you know they come in and they get another anointing then they come out behind that anointing and they get they get you know Moody and here he was sitting out there and he said he he just got right angry with God he said Lord I know you're merciful I knew you'd be merciful to him why did you send me down here here I am sitting out here in this heat and here I am trying to find a place to rest and so God brought rose up this little door this little garden that come over him and put a little shade on that old prophet's bald head and he thought oh my that's so nice that's so nice you know what he he was trying to get him to the place to realize that everything works for the good to those that fear and love God and this little girl was saying he thought all this is so nice but God was going to show him he's going to give him a revelation and here's this little worm comes and it eats the garden the gourd dies oh here I am again Lord Lord what what are you what are you doing with me well why are you allowing me that this to happen to me oh yeah oh yeah and he said you was more concerned about this door than he was about them he said what's more valuable or so or a plant right you know we got a lot of people as Tree Huggers you know what they're more they're more they they love more than the vegetation more than they do one another you know and they love animals more than they love their brothers and sisters you know you can they'll put you in jail for killing a cat or a dog and we shouldn't do those things but you know the human they say like their life is so invaluable to them you know because they've been polluted by the God of this evil age they don't know the real value of a soul but here here I like how the Lord deal with Jonah Jonah began to get angry and he said hey Johnny to get angry so you know sometimes he lets you lesson says you're good to get that way now straighten up and fly right you know what I like the way God deals with us that way and so you know they went through discouragement here for for and he went for a while but I want to talk about the work I want to look at the work instrument the meaning of discouragement and we see Satan tries to always attack us we're discouragement trying to discourage us when we say the word means to the private courage we should be very courageous in this age we live in this is the time for the bride to shine this is not the time for her to be scared or a coward this is a time for her to take the sword and possess the land right to take to take to take over the gates of our enemy it means to to deprive of confidence to dishearten to hinder by this favoring you know what when you go through a trial brother Donnie sometimes you see that you're going through this trial and Satan will tell you see that God's mad at you you've done something dumb again and I said well probably did but that don't mean he's mad that means he loves me if he wasn't whooping me I mean he didn't love me for he said he chases and rebukes those who you'll ever see Satan tries to manipulate the word he tries to get into the place of work will dislocate the word or misplaced the word he said there's taking the word for what it is and say it and believe it just like it's wrote and he tries to get us to be discouraged turn women to the book of Deuteronomy chapter 31 just for a minute I love the commission of God to his children this wasn't just to the prophets and this wasn't just to the wasn't just to the to uh Joshua but I like what he says here for Moses in Deuteronomy 31 8 he says and the Lord I like that he wasn't Aaron it wasn't nobody else that says in the Lord he is that goat that does go before thee he will be with thee he will not fail thee how can I that's one thing Our God can't do is fail a sister David he can't fail I've never read in the scripture one place where God ever failed what he was trying to do he passed it he possessed everything he said he would do right he said he'll never pray he will not fail thee neither for safety see that's what gate Satan tries to do here taxes oh he's failed you if he really what he tell the prophet you know you preach Divine Healing all these years here's your wife then here's your baby died if he really is God then why ain't he healed him that's right come on you better know you better know you've got the goodies amen he said fear not he said no fear for over in Timothy says God has not given us the spirit of fear but of love and a sound mind we ought to thank God this one that we're setting in this place with a sound mind the world is insane they're calling everything that's bad good and everything that's good is bad see it's the god of the same place he said neither be thou neither be dismayed the word is let's see where I don't write this down listen the word dismayed means to do the same thing means it means a sudden loss of Courage a resolution from alarm or fear a sudden disappointment see that's you know for the believer there's not going to be no disappointments in hell that's right but for the unbeliever and the make-believer there's going to be some disappointments brother said there's going to be a lot of disappointments but the prize is not going to be disappointed she's been appointed to possess this land that's right in a time of recession God has given us the power to possess right we're not in a recession the bride's not in a recession he don't want us to poor mouth and meaning God has given us everything like I was talking to brother Donnie what more can he do he give us eternal life what greater blessing can you give us brother Gabriel go buy me some go down there at Walmart CVS see if he got appeal see if they got a shot you can't get it it's a gift he's give to the believer it's his very life see Satan can't take that away from us but a lot of times we we get discouraged and we doubt in the promises of God when we ought to be encouraged in the promises of God right amen I like what he said what he said to Joshua he gave him a commission too over in Joshua chapter 1. verse 9. see just because he just showing he wasn't a respected person he gave Moses a commission that he promised him he'd do and here he's promising he says the same thing almost the same thing to to Joshua in chapter chapter one verse now he says have not I commanded thee it's not the word of God commanded us this day that we live in it's not this message commanded us what to do that's it now give us the blueprint on how to live a Christian Life he said be strong and of good courage Be not Afraid neither be thou dismayed for the Lord thy God is with thee with orsoever thou knows and David said oh though I make my bed in hell you'll never leave what about the bride yeah let's enlarged herself sure we're walking amongst it now what do you think this is brother says it's Atomic father but I'm so thankful this morning that we can realize who we are and we need to get in our position Amen Let us be strong and of a good courage Don't Be Afraid these things have not come over over on us by surprise of the the world's surprise at this how can this happen everything everything I banked on I put all this and I put all my goodies in this in this account and I I had everything my retirement plan everything here I've lost it all the panicking but we don't have to panic all right we've read them the book God said I'll never leave thee not forsake the hell he'd be with even in the to the end to the end to the end and it can't live no not one place in here have I ever seen him lie not one place in here have I ever seen him not back his word up amen right right he's so sure of his word that he said heavens and earth will pass away but my word will never pass and I like the way David grabbed that hid Thy word in my heart that I sin not against them and look at job you know Joe went through a great try he didn't ask for asked him said now Joe we know you're a secret sinner you've done something you had to the Lord would not allow this see they didn't understand God had to bring God has to get us get our attention sometimes to show us Revelation to show us what we need to do sometimes he just has to get us in a place where we can meet Steve that's right and know that he's gone instead of trying to figure everything out for himself and they all had lots of good words to say but he said God come down said who's man they give me counsel who is man who where were you Joe who told me how to hang those stars who told me where to put them in who told me how to separate the water from the earth who told me what man showed me who did I need to get intelligence from no we all just put all of our confidence in God you realize he's able to keep us able to keep us not like job here he is in verse Chapter 30 verse 16 he said oh now my soul is poured out upon me and the days of my Affliction have taken hold upon me that's what happens to a lot of us our Affliction takes a hold upon us see when I had that when I had that I was like when I had to have a surgery on my foot and that my toe it got such in such a bad shape that Affliction brother and had took a hold on me it took a hold on me but God was saying will you stand on my word Satan was telling me it don't matter what you're gonna wait what you did you suffered for 10 years with it it ain't gonna get better you've had surgery before it didn't work this ain't gonna work either but the Bible said I'm the Lord my God the human thing and he tried to discourage he tried to discourage The credibility of the word that's what he tries to do tries to discourage The credibility of the word the word has a credibility it's the king's word all right what does King saying he means it that's right and here fulfill every bit of it and the prophet God said he'll bankrupt heaven doesn't feel they were promised to his believers in the reflection and they're getting it says well look at how you are you here it is seven weeks later than that that thing hit fell off it was a big old black Ultra thing on my toe about the size of the quarter as thick as a nickel says it still ain't gonna get better I told you I said what the word of God said I am the Lord thy God the healeth thee right amen and I begin to rub that thing before I went back to work and I said Lord I know you're healed because you wouldn't have allowed this and you wouldn't have made a way for me to get the surgical see it's crooked the insurance companies are crooked amen and they try to discourage you oh yes that first thing they told me it was cosmetic I might need one but I'm not getting one I said I'm having to have surgery this thing is causing me to walk out of balance right see we need to walk in the balance of the message that's what's wrong many people have took the message and got it out of balance that's why they can't walk like a Christian they can't think like a Christian they can't live like a Christian right right well so there's no way and then you get to that place and you say Lord look you're slay me and I trust you you're right that's when The Showdown comes that's right this is Showdown my brothers and sisters now begin to rub on that thing one day I began to rub that thing I said Lord I need this thing to come off and you said in your word and that thing just fell off one week 's like a brand new like a brand new toe now some new skin that kind of stroll up look like a tomato I said my goodness Satan see that I'm Gonna Take It I'm gonna take your foot I'm gonna take you see he keeps telling and trying to describe but God said he'd do it I said Lord I know you created an ankle bone what is too hard for you Lord he takes you back the scripture the Lord said then I tell Abraham is anything too hard for God nothing nothing's too hard for God even my head's too big and these glasses are too small amen well I'm so thankful to God and we don't really we don't have to get into it discouragement Elijah here he had the greatest Showdown see he had a great Showdown he defeated all them false prophets and then one woman be running he had crime because that Norton lasting see that Norton brings boldness right it brings boy it brings courage but see we still got to have courage without the anointing right we got to say God we're trusting your word you promised it yes right because we will realize we can't operate through the senses when I feel it I believe it that don't always happen that's right that's what I don't feel and I still believe that amen but I don't seem God move I still believe it but my prayers get all high in this ceiling I still believe it but God said if I'd ask anything according to his will right amen amen here's Elijah run off scare the one little woman I'm gonna kill him he killed all my boss Robin here's this whole loud mouth Jezebel all painted up the prophet of God runs from her eyes down and he said well I'm gonna I'm on a comfort over Elijah I'm gonna send the Ravens I'm going to send the Ravens to feed it because I know he's I know he's hungry I'm gonna let him sit right here at this Brook chair with I'm gonna let him drink till this water runs out see Ahab didn't have that assurance that's right he didn't have that Assurance he was wondering where he was watering his next meeting but God still don't have to worry about that he said I'll provide everything I provided it according to my riches not Obama's right bankrupt and here he began to drink and again that run out I bet Manor said oh my Lord and this Satan probably tried telling wealth Elijah see there are you didn't believe God he's mad at you again the water Creek's dried up Raiders ain't bringing nothing else to eat the Lord spoke into the eyes I have talked to a little woman and she'll sustained me that's right see God works on both ends Right Here Comes this woman walking up here comes him walking up here's this woman he said woman what are you gonna do he said I'm going to make this location me and my son's gonna eat it now right so here I hope was gone too but see God's working on both ends he wanted he said this one was been true to me right she stood on my word she's probably getting a little skirts because she heard her boy crying his stomach hurt he was hungry he was in man a lot of times we see things happen to our families and discourages us see God had a promise I'll never leave it I'll never saved it hey he was four days late but he's still on time right they thought he was late if you'd have been here Lord oh I was here I knew he's gonna die but for his glory I wanted to show you I wanted to get away from all your superstitions so I'm gonna let him lay there four days I was eating the Jews talking about three days it's still the spirit still that didn't come back up in it so he said I'll just break down let you know there's nothing but the power of God so that fourth day he come see but this woman does he look like here you got a little bit of oil additional one he said go get me a drink she said all right what about that guy still had water in it he still had water for her see that but it was hungry still so you can go longer without food and you can't water right this bite is over 90 water in other words remember I said we're not but much matters were all we've been eating I can tell that but then he spoke these words you know why didn't promise amongst them said we really wouldn't know that he you know God had to tell her that this was my my servant this is my private because he said go make me a cake first a lot of women a lot of dads were saying what my boy's dying this is all I got you want me to go make you wanna we ain't gonna eat them they said go make me a cake first see obedience to the word that rhymes never promised okay right that's right and she obeyed what the prophet said dude that's what's happened around the message A lot of people are starting to disobey the prophet's work it's not what he really didn't mean that you didn't why do you say it why do you say it I didn't think the way I see it oh well that's all right I just say it like he said it and you know what I don't even understand it but I believe it but I believe I believe it's the truth see she had to believe she didn't understand I bet she didn't understand go make me a cake you sure I mean she thought maybe a little bit of myself well all right went down there and made him a cake and brung it to him went down there and went back in there that was enough for them again and then every day him and her him she didn't go to provide we don't have to worry about it we don't depend on our brain camp right depend on my heavily account right you know what I got a check I can cash in it's already been signed All I gotta do is fill it out it says Jesus Christ down there yeah it's already been approved all I gotta do is believe it he said wait a minute I didn't get what I asked for today it's coming it's coming it's kind of what I don't feel no better oh it's coming I didn't feel a little better that didn't mean that he said you're going to stick to my word right right are you going to lead to your senses are they going to trust in your senses are you going to believe in my word I'm leaving you worried these senses failed me many times yes you know many people's cried many people shouted many people spoke with tongues but they didn't have the goodies that's right because when the time come in for the test of time they left he said they were judged for a while at your seat he said but when my son came in to bake out the greenness they weren't able to withstanding they withered away because it had no root really Aaron had no heart to receive it thank God we got a heart this morning to received amen we don't need to give in James said here's the key now James chapter 4 verse 7 he says submit yourselves therefore to God he didn't say resistance to submit yourself to no man right submit yourself to no certain Doctrine he said submit yourselves therefore to God he said resist the devil amen and he'll flee we forgot we forgot to read the end of it resist the devil and he'll flee when he comes in with his tool of discouragement resist him say God has given me joy God has given me peace God has given me rest I'm resting as Paul Rayner said I'm riding on it this morning I'm riding on this message I've tried for many times in the flesh we've tried to we've tried to we tried to wrestle that log in and get in the flow with God but he said just roll it in there Paul get on it and ride that's all we have to do says no it's no fleshly thinking we do to gain this within our flesh can we do to gain this Psalms 105 verse 2 says singing to the Lord sing unto him sing songs unto him talk give his wondrous words and see Satan during the time when he puts these things off he tries to get to the place to be discouraged and say well you know Satan tries to single yet well you know he let nobody else go through this oh yeah really really you think you're the only one that's ever done today read the Bible all of them was chasing and repeat right see it's building characters say we want Power without having to go through the trials and the heartaches to get character but Power without character said that you know what I'm thankful for that but he shouldn't power with character Fitzgerald see he's training us to be rulers we're not peasants we're rulers and he said casting down the imaginations and bringing every thought of The Obedience of Jesus Christ imaginations is what gets us in trouble that's what discourages because we look at we look at things and we think well it don't look no better faith is the sums of things hoped for right evidence of Things Not Seen he didn't say when you see it you believe see Thomas said if I see I believe but he said greater's the one that ain't seen and still believe that's right amen and sometimes we get to a place where we need to see it God will do it God will show us something that encourages us amen and I'm thankful for that we need to fight all this negativity around our life we live in a negative world they're all complaining oh murmuring you know what you'll get caught up in it you'll murmur and complain with them I did the Lord told me I said stop it stop it swirl the Lord rebuked me brother died I said all right Lord I'm sorry I did I shouldn't have did that right because he gets you caught up in politics that gets you caught up in this you know where you work at the Murman Murman you complain about not getting enough hours you're complain about this you complain about that and God said you know what I've done to the Israelites when they commemorate and complain they wandered around in the wilderness I think that's why we've teared so long we've murmured and complained too long it's time to just take God this word and say Lord be it unto me according to Thy word Lord I'm gonna quit murdering I'm gonna quit complaining yes I'm gonna quit trying to figure everything out for myself and just let you do it I'm gonna quit trying to accomplish everything and just let your word be bring it to pass we need to bring our thoughts on the obedience you know what that we can say bring ourselves under the announce that's anointing it's discouragement anointing but we can bring others on that and all I've seen it happen you get around people that's like brother Jewel said well how's your housing you know what you know man you can run him you'll be lousy wisely before you left well present I can tell where my kids go stay at oh yeah because the spirit they bring back home right amen so be careful who you who you make company with I mean we don't we're not mean to people we love them and I'm like well I'm not gonna get in there and jump in the boat with it just cause they're both sinking I'm not gonna get in there with them I'll say hey I got a promise Rapture I'm having the body changed hey I'm not gonna I'm not worried about what's happening here on this Earth that's just signs that tell me to look up not look down yeah that's what happened when the boy all the other boys couldn't win the thing for the bicycle the one boy got his eye on the prize and he kept riding the restaurants looking at oh I don't know if we can do it Peter did the same thing yeah when he got his eyes off Jesus that's what happens to us every time when we get our eyes off Jesus yeah Psalms chapter 3 verse 3 says but thou Lord a shield from me my glory and a lifter up of my head and he said when you see these things look up Don't look down your Redemption draws now amen we have to ask God in faith we must have faith in God we ask him for heaven no he'll do it appreciate it when the enemy had come in like a flood he'd raise up a standard the standard's the word it's not these is this right well we don't wrestle against flesh and blood amen against principality is a spiritual wickedness in high places the battlefield right there the man Satan gets in there and they just but you know what I like what the prophet said he said I'm getting to the place to where I'm doubting my doubts glory to God that's where I want to get I don't want to get to the place where I'm at my doubts that's when you know that God is real he said be certain of God and know that he's real right he said you must make you call an election sure oh I'm thankful for that ain't you oh I love him love him for his grace and mercy turn with me to the Book of Romans I think a lot of times when getting discouraged because of the things we think we should we can accomplish because we've been in the message so long we can accomplish it through the flesh I think that's what brings a lot of us discouragement on us just a few minutes I won't keep you much lower amen Romans chapter 10 I'm sorry about that my eyes ain't what they used to be my wife says I need to get my eyes checked but I I'm saying Lord you didn't let Martin Luther's eyes go in there I'm gonna believe anyway so I have to know Romans 10 3 6 4 they being ignorant of God's righteousness I believe a lot of times we're really we don't really understand the righteousness of God right amen this is being ignorant of God's righteousness and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of God and it's not my fleshly works that we can do I like you you know there's above charge this is a very serious charge he charged them with the Israelites had followed after the law of righteousness and they realized they had what they were to keep the law brother they failed it they weren't able to obtain the law they tried their best and it becomes so much trouble to become a do and it don't a lot of people I believe they let this message become dudes and don'ts to them come on now he said we see therefore they had no righteousness brother Donnie we have no righteousness but they were not submitting themselves to receding the gift of righteousness that was being offered they weren't going to submit themselves to this man who called himself Jesus me and my father are one when you've seen me you're seeing the father no way you're an illegitimate all right but oh they wouldn't accept it they as we do so many times do not realize that they were totally and thoroughly deprived creatures by Nature we got to realize that we are the prime creatures by name this name I'm talking about the flesh nature now not the spirit we've got all things through Christ Jesus right but they didn't realize to this nature this the the sin in the garden tonight and implanted himself in there and to give us the wrong nature we see man is in such a condition that he cannot be saved through his struggles to keep the holy standard of God's law no matter that's what they think about this world you know our business I ain't cut my hair I'm still wondering what about the lion the life of God that's right right he'll never attain it by those things that's right right I don't care how long we've been in this message unless we've been born again we'll fail right but before man will submit and Trust in the righteousness of God it has to be proven to him or her that our life in the flesh is a demonstrated failure it's a failure that's right Paul said the life I live now right I live through Christ Jesus amen amen it's a new life I believe many times we as message believers today are not exempt from needing this proof for sometimes for some of us it seems that we have more defeat and lost battles and less Victory than we ever have something to think about brothers and sisters discouragement seems to have come back upon us with a Vengeance that's why we see so many people falling away discouragement has come on them see they failed to be borned again all right that's what happened to me when I was raising the Smith I thought because Mom and Daddy had it I'd be all right but God don't have no grandchildren right he had Sons and Daughters right the source of producing discouragement the producing this discouragement the center around the Fleshlight well this place Paul said when I go to do good he was always present he wasn't talking about you with his brother he wasn't talking about Peter he wasn't talking about John he wasn't talking about Mark he wasn't talking about Silas something like this regret said you'll never perfect him he's a cockleberry all you can do is Bridle him with the Holy Ghost that's the truth it seems that the righteousness we have clothed not all of us we have been clothed with it's being Stripped Away see Satan tearing down trusting in the righteousness of God right let us he's trying to turn us back to the mall back to the keeper of this to be able to keep this message through a flesh really outward thing to do but we can't do it this flesh can't keep it it's felt he said he gives so many covenants and they fail you do this I'll do that he blew it right blew it every time we're blowing it now if we think we can do it that way that's right they've Satan places to thought a lot of us trying to get you to disbelieve in your birth yeah am I really born again you're right come on now you wouldn't have done that been a really bad Christian right see I said Satan you tricked me you tricked me I didn't do that the flesh did this Spirit In Me it's the same Spirit of living me live in Christ Jesus well let me he'll Quicken this Mortal body I said but I have a god in me that condemns me when I make mistakes and I'm able to go to him and I say Lord forgive me they stop by the outward place that we can do the life we live now is through Christ Jesus not through this man am I really elect have I really been born again I tell you how you can answer that question as the prophet said the woman said but Brandon I'm wondering if I have the Holy Ghost he said sister what is your heart's desire see Satan I want to tell you that it says to serve God has been loving with all I he says sister God still got you he said when you lose that desire when we ask that what the problem is a lot of people think well you know they try to justify their sins that goes over like a label there is no justice we broke the law so there's a penalty right right and Jesus had to pay that price or me and you would have paid for it but I'm thankful that God has paid the price for us I'm like what Jesus said in Saint John 6 chapter 30 verse Saint John's chapter 6 verse 37 he says all that the father giveth me shall come to me right and him that cometh to me I will in no wise cast out we must trust him we must believe in that this must become a personal revelation to you amen not just because your pastor said it or the Evangel said it's going to be a personal relationship to you he is proving to us that there is no good thing in our flesh what did Paul say in Romans 8 17 he says and if children then hairs hairs of God John heirs with Christ and show me that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together this Revelation is important because it will keep us from trusting in the flesh and the law and keep us turned to Christ that's the only hope we have in Christ Jesus the only hope we have is in Christ Jesus that's right no other hope that we have right amen not like what the prophet of God said he said in one place he said and even even your members of your family I'm trying to discourage he said they'll try to discourage you more than ever he uses you know what the joke wife say Joe he's give up on you job he don't even love you no more Joe he said now he slay me and I trust him see we got to make our call in an election shortly I like what Paul said in Galatians 5 4 he says Christ has become no effect unto you whosoever of you are justified by the law you're falling from Grace so see we're trying to justify our life as message believed God tell us about what we've done the outward works it's an inwardness right that brings forth that outward manifestation see it's not to help with things we've done it's the inward thing he did amen right it's his blood tag our faith will not and cannot rest fully immigration to entice In the Flesh yes Philippians 3 3 says for a we are the circumcision which worship God in spirit and rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh right no not for this in the flesh what does turning from law and Grace consists of does it mean that when we turn from long grace to the extent that we are no longer concerned about keeping the law no no they don't mean that we must apply all our strength toward keeping it but when we fail we're not to suppose we're falling from Grace see Satan wants you to think that right that's the second we tell you if you was a Christian you wouldn't have done it he just wanted to deny the grace of God the blood the atonement we fall from grace when we suppose that our efforts to keep it justifies us there's the heavy hitter he says keep him below faith in Christ having kept the law is our justification turning from the law to Grace means that we refuse to trust in our ability to keep the law through the flesh when sons and daughters are led by the spirit of God it says our ability to keep the law as a way of Salvation the truth is that law and Grace work together to bring about our Salvation we're not supposed to to one another to be we're supposed to come they're supposed to compliment one another they're not supposed to be opposed to one another they're supposed to compliment one another we see the law says faith says forth God's standard of Holiness and I believe in wholeness brothers and sisters I believe a lot of people in the message that forgot about Holiness we see the skirts and the high-heeled shoes and the the trimming their hairs again the split tails and they said what the Scandal skirts are coming back baby now my wife showed me in the paper the other day they're gonna be a big head again you know the problems talked about it it's kind of experience showing us that same old dad was raise a recycler he cycles that Spirit right back around see it shows forth his righteousness and Perfection it cannot be turned away from its perfection and for that reason it cannot forgive its violators the law convinced Grace forgives right yes Romans 8 3 4 what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh see the flesh was weak they couldn't do it see there had to be a spirit of life to be able to keep the law in there see right that's where the Sadducees and Pharisees messed up they tried to do it without what works we've kept the Sabbath we've done this we wash our hands we do this will not be a fornication he said you're of your father the devil and here's what she'll do he said you blind leaders of the blind don't you know he told naked women she must be born again he says it was weak to the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh glory be to God he condemned mine in your sin in his flesh he showed that it had to be a perfect sacrifice yes that's right I mean he was it failed not through any flaw in it the law fell but though through the weakness of our flesh the law fellow for us we failed the law strive as we made perfectly the Lord declares that if it we're guilty as if we've broken the whole law and we say oh I never did this I never lied I never done this I never done that he was born the wrong way right you lied when your mama caught you in the cookie jar you lied you little white lies you didn't think me nothing they was lies there is no such thing as a white lie they're all black and his sight you know we can't give up Jesus is in Matthew chapter 10 verse 22 he says and ye shall be hated of all men this must come a revelation to us when you stand for the truth you're going to be hating everybody ain't gonna like you that's right what do you think a lot of times we think oh if we stand for them no they don't they say man he's a crazy he said you should be hated for my name say yes see they don't even hate you when you're mention the name of Jesus now they don't mind talking about God anything can be a God but you give it a name right and our God has a name the Lord Jesus Christ thank you we see that this we must understand he said for my name's sake but he that endureth to the end shall be saved let us stand and just thankful to death that God has given this the ability that we can fulfill the law through Christ Jesus Jesus not through this fleshly man that we've tried that Satan tries to put all this all this condemnation on us and all this as you do use this you do that use this and it sees did Jesus the same way if thou be the Son of God Amen turn this Stone in the bread see Satan wants us to put on a show for him right hey we're not in the show business what man we're not in the show business that's the world's the show business we're not here to be a movie star we're stars of Heaven
