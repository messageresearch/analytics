[2:49] something
[2:53] if not then all right romans 8
[2:56] heavenly father we thank you
[3:00] that you are god and you change not
[3:03] and then we can depend upon it
[3:05] we can anchor our hearts our souls or
[3:07] everything into
[3:09] what you say
[3:10] so we believe you and we thank you we
[3:12] ask you to just have your way with us
[3:15] and lord we thank you so much
[3:17] there's just not enough praise in our
[3:19] lips
[3:20] of any way to be able to thank you
[3:23] for saving our souls
[3:25] for guiding us into your love and
[3:27] understanding
[3:29] bringing us into the word of the hour
[3:32] that we may be able to even to hear
[3:35] because it's a blessing just to hear
[3:38] your word
[3:39] but to have an opportunity
[3:41] to be able to believe it
[3:43] talk about it fellowship with it and
[3:46] just let your grace lord be sufficient
[3:48] for every need we love you and we thank
[3:50] you just as we read your word you come
[3:53] and speak to our hearts and our lives on
[3:55] the things that we have need of forgive
[3:57] our sins
[3:59] because that's the main thing lord and
[4:01] keep us in jesus name
[4:03] amen
[4:09] we'll start reading with verse 14
[4:13] romans 8
[4:15] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[4:17] god they are the sons of god
[4:19] for you have not received the spirit of
[4:20] bondage again to fear but you have
[4:22] received the spirit of adoption
[4:24] whereby we cry abby father the spirit
[4:27] itself beareth witness with our spirit
[4:29] that we are the children of god and as
[4:32] children than ours
[4:33] heirs of god and join ours with christ
[4:36] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[4:39] may be also glorified together
[4:42] for i reckon that the sufferings of this
[4:44] present time are not worthy to be
[4:46] compared with the glory which shall be
[4:49] revealed
[4:50] in us now it didn't say
[4:53] in him and in this
[4:56] the little sufferings we have
[4:59] you know
[5:00] that we're going through
[5:02] to be revealed in us something gracious
[5:05] and glorious to be revealed in us what's
[5:08] now freddie earnest expectation of the
[5:10] creature
[5:11] waiteth now that's the whole creation
[5:13] part right
[5:14] for the manifestation of the sons of god
[5:17] for the creature was made subject to
[5:18] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[5:20] him who has subjected the same in hope
[5:23] because the creature itself also shall
[5:25] be delivered from the bondage of
[5:27] corruption
[5:28] into the glorious liberty of the
[5:30] children of god now remember that
[5:33] scripture
[5:34] all creation is going to
[5:37] follow
[5:38] you
[5:40] right
[5:41] wherever we go what we get
[5:44] all that's going to be taken care of all
[5:46] right now that's that's a glorious
[5:48] thing
[5:49] for we know that the whole creation
[5:51] grown us and travaileth and pained
[5:53] together until now
[5:55] and not only they but ourselves also
[5:57] which have the first fruits of the
[5:58] spirit
[6:00] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[6:03] waiting for the adoption
[6:05] to whatnot to wit
[6:07] to understand
[6:09] to understand the redemption
[6:13] of our body you may be seated
[6:15] lord add his blessing
[6:18] to the reading of the word now
[6:21] i was going to continue on into because
[6:23] i wanted to get to
[6:25] uh and talk about it and the lord
[6:27] willing we'll try to do it sunday
[6:29] as to talk about the
[6:31] uh the grace of marriage and divorce
[6:33] and the things you know and uh
[6:35] bringing in a little more of that
[6:38] but
[6:39] i keep coming back to one thing because
[6:42] i know
[6:43] that it's hard to
[6:45] uh
[6:47] um
[6:49] get
[6:50] sometimes our mind our thinking
[6:53] away from what we've been taught
[6:56] you know in our doings
[6:58] and uh you know and we need to
[7:02] you know a lot what we've been taught
[7:03] was good that's no problem to the good
[7:06] part
[7:07] it's just the bad part that took us into
[7:09] the wrong directions
[7:11] and uh you know
[7:13] and then
[7:15] coming to the message of the hour
[7:17] we begin to realize that there is a lot
[7:20] of things
[7:21] that uh
[7:24] you know
[7:26] that you and i are having to deal with
[7:30] uh
[7:32] by being in the message and receiving it
[7:35] and and
[7:36] and i don't mean that wrong because i
[7:38] mean it right it's glorious
[7:40] but uh still
[7:43] we are the only people
[7:46] that i believe in now as much as i can
[7:48] that we're the only people
[7:51] that really know the full plan of
[7:54] redemption
[7:55] all right now you know i believe that
[7:58] i believe that's what it is it's made
[8:00] for this day
[8:02] all right now you can go back into the
[8:04] bible as i say in there the other day
[8:06] and and talk about the things and and
[8:08] you can see there that they believed in
[8:09] one god they believed water baptism they
[8:12] believe predestination they believe no
[8:13] eternal hell they believed all of the of
[8:16] the things and we have to be based upon
[8:18] that
[8:20] and it's not that brother branham come
[8:21] to bring us something different from
[8:24] that
[8:25] all right but to bring what they spoke
[8:28] of right see paul spoke of change in a
[8:31] moment between club and i like trump you
[8:33] know and all
[8:34] he spoke of all of those things but
[8:36] could not
[8:37] see them fulfilled
[8:40] all right
[8:41] but i believe that you and i are the
[8:43] people of god that the end of all things
[8:45] has come upon to worry that
[8:48] somebody's going to see it well why
[8:50] can't we confess we're them you know
[8:52] because you say well it will be one of
[8:54] these days well that means that you
[8:55] don't believe it's here
[8:58] right
[8:59] i mean if you're saying well i believe
[9:00] one of these days but that means you
[9:02] don't believe it's here well let's start
[9:04] saying it's here
[9:05] just like healing we must say that we're
[9:07] healed
[9:08] before we can be healed
[9:11] all right we must say we're saved
[9:13] according to the scriptures before we
[9:15] can be saved all right so then we're
[9:18] going to have to say
[9:19] that we are the bride of christ
[9:22] before we can be that you know one time
[9:24] at the end time the finishing up of all
[9:26] things we're going to have to confess
[9:28] all of the things even to the rapture
[9:32] right
[9:33] and you know and you know how i've
[9:35] always tried to teach that i believe the
[9:37] rapture started on the day of pentecost
[9:40] now you believe what you want to but i
[9:42] believe those people were resurrected
[9:44] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[9:46] jesus raptured up into a height
[9:49] beyond mankind
[9:51] but yet it was still not the sufficient
[9:53] amount to
[9:55] to
[9:56] take the change and bring that to pisces
[9:58] all right because you're gonna have to
[10:00] have a change of the body you're gonna
[10:02] have to have the resurrection and a
[10:03] change according to the scripture before
[10:05] you can talk about a rapture
[10:07] you know going away well i thought we
[10:10] were supposed to be going away in the
[10:13] new birth
[10:14] i thought that removed us
[10:16] from the the world of sin
[10:20] you know and bringing us to a position
[10:23] to word it we can say we've been
[10:25] raptured up well lord i believe the
[10:27] second coming of jesus christ started on
[10:29] the day of pentecost
[10:30] i do i'm just honest i can be because i
[10:33] believe that's why brother branham
[10:34] wouldn't say you know he come along and
[10:36] he said i'm not saying he's coming
[10:39] he's i'm saying he's here
[10:40] well you know what to him
[10:42] might have been the only person in the
[10:43] world
[10:44] but at least it was to him that's right
[10:47] all right but see we're going to have to
[10:49] come to those things that's what i spent
[10:51] all of that series about a positive
[10:52] attitude to get away from the negativism
[10:55] well we don't see nothing going on
[10:57] nobody's got nothing we just sitting
[10:59] around you know just doing this and just
[11:01] dying and that's what we're doing
[11:04] but somebody's gonna have to start
[11:06] confessing it
[11:07] well why can't we say we are
[11:10] right
[11:11] you say well brother dale do you believe
[11:14] that we have the faith of the fathers i
[11:16] confess we do
[11:19] i believe i can prove we do
[11:22] because i believe we have the same
[11:23] revelation that they had
[11:25] not
[11:27] meaning all of us meaning everything but
[11:29] meaning the word of god
[11:32] do you believe the headstone is here i
[11:34] do
[11:35] i believe the headstone was this
[11:36] prophet's message
[11:38] now i say headstone because you gotta
[11:40] have a sold word
[11:41] all right then the word sown into the
[11:44] hearts by the prophet now the quickening
[11:46] power
[11:48] is something else
[11:50] now
[11:51] and it's not my responsibility to try to
[11:53] quicken it
[11:55] i can't do that i wish i could right you
[11:57] know i mean
[11:59] it would be nice if we could do it but
[12:01] we can't do it so god has to quicken it
[12:04] but we're going to have to say it before
[12:07] that it can be done all right
[12:10] now i got just a little part of a
[12:12] thought tonight
[12:14] to cover with you when we get to it in a
[12:16] minute
[12:16] but uh i will i do want to read one
[12:19] thing because the brothers were trying
[12:21] to get it for me sunday and i couldn't
[12:23] pick it up it was the quote that a lot
[12:25] of people you know want to know about
[12:28] and we'll go ahead and just read it
[12:30] right here and then that way uh
[12:34] you know they had it running up and down
[12:35] and i
[12:36] just had to say forget it it was the
[12:38] statement that i had made
[12:41] that i didn't have see i didn't have it
[12:42] in my possession i knew brother branham
[12:44] had made this statement
[12:46] you know but i didn't have it because i
[12:48] had lost it and for some reason i
[12:50] couldn't find it
[12:52] but run up the question on the number
[12:54] one a
[12:56] and uh
[12:58] let's just read what he had to say
[13:01] and then
[13:02] you know let you read it and let you
[13:04] think about what he's saying
[13:06] it was about the uh wrong companion etc
[13:11] all right so let's just let him say it
[13:14] but i want you to read the whole thing
[13:17] because this is what's amazing to me
[13:20] is uh and i don't claim to be
[13:23] uh i just claim to believe what the
[13:25] prophet says
[13:27] because that way we can follow it
[13:30] he said look i'm not asking questions
[13:33] and answers real number 2 64 8 23
[13:36] paragraph 209 all right
[13:38] i'm not advising you
[13:41] now this was before
[13:44] marriage and divorce was priests right
[13:47] all right
[13:48] now you go back through those questions
[13:50] and answers you find a lot of wonderful
[13:52] nuggets
[13:55] but you find that there was a lot of
[13:57] people back there misunderstood because
[13:59] you know i could call the brother's name
[14:02] but he went around the country saying
[14:04] you know and preaching his own
[14:07] marriage in divorce
[14:09] you know and he you know he had it all
[14:12] figured out
[14:13] and then you get into the soul matings
[14:15] you get into all of those things leave
[14:17] this one go with that one and do this
[14:18] and the other and they're just running
[14:20] like crazy and brother branham hadn't
[14:22] even preached the grace yet or anything
[14:24] you know
[14:25] but yet he'll make some amazing
[14:27] statements
[14:28] that i believe we should consider
[14:32] those statements
[14:33] all right and look what he says
[14:35] i'm not advising you please let me just
[14:38] give you a little scripture
[14:40] now remember he's a prophet
[14:43] when he says scripture he's not saying
[14:45] matthew 28 19
[14:48] right you know because you'll be looking
[14:49] for the scripture he you he's giving you
[14:52] the correct understanding i believe of
[14:55] the scriptures
[14:57] right i think that was what he was
[14:59] brought for see not to just figure out
[15:01] well we got to put matthew 28 19 right
[15:03] here you know no no
[15:04] all right please please don't don't
[15:07] don't
[15:08] if you're living happy with your husband
[15:10] living happy with your wife
[15:12] please remain that away
[15:16] were you judged for because i told you
[15:18] that
[15:19] don't don't leave them little children
[15:21] without a home and things like that
[15:24] now from that statement is where i
[15:27] speak from when i say paul was dealing
[15:30] with a guy married five times
[15:34] and what's he going to do in his day
[15:36] you can't leave him living with five and
[15:38] get into the new testament part so what
[15:41] did he do
[15:42] go home with one but raise them other
[15:44] kids don't be a sorry slot and say they
[15:47] ain't mine they belong to the devil
[15:49] that's serpent seed
[15:51] no
[15:52] that's where that comes from for me all
[15:55] right
[15:55] it says please remain that way
[15:58] because i told you don't leave them
[15:59] little children right at home
[16:01] and things like that
[16:03] now what kind of a person would you
[16:05] think of that would come in to church
[16:08] here you know and they'd say brother
[16:09] dale i want to get my life straightened
[16:11] up it's okay this we do the best we can
[16:13] do
[16:15] i ain't raising him other kids because
[16:16] they don't belong to me
[16:18] you know what i'd tell him
[16:21] i said don't let that door hit you
[16:24] as you go out
[16:28] because
[16:29] you'll never be a part of this group
[16:31] with that form of an attitude
[16:34] right because they wouldn't be desiring
[16:38] to be a christian you see what the
[16:39] problem with a lot of things are
[16:41] all right
[16:43] god has made restitutions and places for
[16:45] people that that did things wrong you
[16:48] remember jesus said of david when he was
[16:50] in hungary he entered into the temple of
[16:52] god and ate the shoe bread
[16:54] which
[16:55] was which is only lawful for the priest
[16:59] and is found blameless
[17:01] now
[17:02] it doesn't say david you're going to
[17:03] have to go back you can argue the point
[17:06] david never went behind the veil
[17:09] to get to manna
[17:10] separate that
[17:12] shoe bread is different
[17:14] shoe bread was out where the priest ate
[17:17] but nobody couldn't go in and eat it
[17:19] you see where i have to get in that and
[17:21] i have to study that part out to find
[17:23] don't don't put david behind the veil
[17:24] eating the manna
[17:26] you can't do it it won't work out all
[17:29] right
[17:30] see and he's found blameless priests
[17:31] also blame blaspheme the sabbath
[17:34] uh upon the sabbath day and are found
[17:36] blindly because there's certain things
[17:38] they had to do
[17:39] and the greater than the sabbath is here
[17:41] there let's leave it up to god and go
[17:44] ahead and just live the way
[17:46] just just live for christ now
[17:49] let's see there might be a chance of you
[17:51] getting in right now so let's go
[17:55] i'll take his word about a change
[17:58] better than i will all the theologians
[17:59] about their dust saith the lord
[18:01] you know so i'll go ahead
[18:04] don't make two wrongs will never write
[18:07] in one
[18:08] just go on and live the way you are
[18:11] if you're
[18:13] if you're happy together notice where
[18:15] people say well we're not happy
[18:20] i'm sorry
[18:21] you made the bed hard mom used to say
[18:24] that was her favorite saying boy you
[18:27] make the bed hard you will sleep in it
[18:31] okay
[18:33] see if you're happy together
[18:35] you might have the wrong companion
[18:38] see everybody wants to power up
[18:41] they want to find some kind of a thing
[18:43] and this all leads back to soul mating
[18:47] you know and i'm supposed to leave my
[18:49] wife because i don't think we're soul
[18:50] mate and marry this world over here
[18:52] because that's my soul mate
[18:54] and then i'm always my sick my 72 year
[18:56] old is over here and i'm so mating with
[18:58] an 18 year old
[19:01] that that just don't fit
[19:04] right you never see it the other way
[19:07] unless you're a rich old lady
[19:09] all right
[19:10] well now listen
[19:12] two wrongs never made a ride
[19:14] you might have the wrong companion
[19:18] but let me ask you a question i tried to
[19:20] explain it to her the other day about
[19:22] the brother that we all know about that
[19:24] you know
[19:26] put away his wife after having 10 kids
[19:28] but
[19:29] i understood that she told him about it
[19:31] you know before they married or back
[19:33] there
[19:34] but yet see he come along to find out a
[19:35] way
[19:36] we want to use the word anyway we want
[19:38] to use it
[19:40] well i've got the scripture
[19:42] what do you mean you live with a woman
[19:45] now you live with a woman a man and
[19:46] woman lives together 10 years and they
[19:48] got a couple of kids and
[19:50] you know
[19:52] and then they start i don't think you're
[19:54] my mate
[19:56] well you're going back uh my i put it
[19:59] this way now hush you're back in the
[20:01] garden
[20:03] with eve and the
[20:04] beast do what you want to
[20:07] you interpret what i just said
[20:10] because that's what it is you're going
[20:12] back to some form that you're trying to
[20:13] work out things
[20:16] and why would you want to leave that
[20:17] wife and find another one
[20:20] oh
[20:21] i want to marry susie we work together
[20:24] she always smells good and she's always
[20:26] happy and there's never any down and out
[20:29] we just everything is so wonderful

[20:39] and he might want to swap places with
[20:41] you
[20:44] right
[20:45] my
[20:46] point why would you go along after a
[20:49] while and then want to get rid of a wife
[20:50] or a husband or whatever you're doing
[20:54] do the best you can make the best you
[20:56] can out of it
[20:57] that's right you know
[21:00] come on folks isn't that what he's
[21:02] talking about
[21:04] you might have the wrong companion i'll
[21:06] say this one thing
[21:07] if you got the wrong companion in this
[21:09] wife
[21:11] look
[21:12] in
[21:13] this life
[21:15] i i'm honest you say you're going to
[21:17] take away you're going to interpret i
[21:19] don't believe he was meaning wife
[21:21] i believe he was meaning just like he
[21:23] said one time on the message
[21:26] is your wife worthy of the gospel
[21:31] did you know he said that on the message
[21:33] is your life worthy the gospel
[21:37] go to the message listen he says when is
[21:40] your wife worthy of the gospel
[21:43] all right what's he talking about your
[21:44] life
[21:45] all right come on
[21:46] now listen
[21:47] in this life you'll never have it in the
[21:50] other one
[21:52] all wrongs will be made right oh when i
[21:54] get over i'll find my other half of my
[21:56] soul
[21:59] and oh we can just be joined together
[22:04] let me say it this way
[22:07] all wrongs will be made
[22:10] right when we get over there
[22:13] you remember the whole text of the
[22:15] message we're not going to be concerned
[22:17] about
[22:18] having babies and living in homes and
[22:20] doing things
[22:23] i'll have the right mate when i get
[22:25] there
[22:27] it'll be jesus christ
[22:32] that's my companion and we will prove
[22:35] that in a second by the word but that's
[22:38] my companion
[22:41] that's where people can't get the
[22:42] message in correct order to tie it
[22:44] together
[22:46] all together
[22:48] you know
[22:49] and to make it come out we still got
[22:51] what we've been taught
[22:53] see we've been taught certain things
[22:55] and and we believe those certain things
[22:57] you know
[22:59] well
[23:00] and even after all of the years that we
[23:02] studied about one god you know yourself
[23:04] the devil will still come and put doubts
[23:07] in your mind about this scripture or
[23:08] that scripture or why'd he run around
[23:10] say this or what he said he said one day
[23:11] he said let's all stand together and
[23:13] address the third person in the trinity
[23:16] you remember that
[23:18] now did he ever believe in a trinity
[23:22] no
[23:23] it's your trinity
[23:25] you know
[23:26] let's stand the dress when you want to
[23:28] dress because the trinity you're talking
[23:30] about is one to me would be saying
[23:32] but yet see we we want our ideas and our
[23:36] thoughts
[23:37] to be
[23:39] what we believe mama said grandmama said
[23:42] granddaddy said so-and-so said you know
[23:46] and we want to leave it that
[23:49] because way
[23:49] say well brother dale you just tore down
[23:51] everything i've ever believed
[23:53] no i didn't
[23:57] if anybody tore it down it was a word
[24:00] i didn't have anything to do with it i
[24:01] just stated facts
[24:03] to believe it
[24:05] i believe when we get over there and
[24:06] i'll prove it just in a second with a
[24:08] little illustration i believe when we
[24:10] get over there remember
[24:13] they asked jesus you know about in the
[24:14] resurrection whose wife would this be
[24:17] you know whose husband or what that she
[24:19] would've been married all the time when
[24:20] she gets up there she's gonna have ten
[24:22] husbands
[24:26] or ten wives or what this says or that
[24:28] are you
[24:30] see we're not gonna be concerned he said
[24:31] you do error not knowing the scriptures
[24:35] for in the resurrection is neither male
[24:38] nor female we're all female in the body
[24:41] of christ
[24:43] so when we get there we'll have the
[24:45] right companion
[24:48] but we'll look back and recognize
[24:51] the human
[24:52] life that we lived i play that
[24:56] you know
[24:57] but i don't think i'll be walking down
[24:59] through there with peggy on my arms and
[25:00] walk by you know and we'll be walking
[25:02] along had a wonderful time
[25:04] i could have had that one too
[25:08] i don't think so
[25:11] maybe you do it's all right
[25:13] forgive me for being silly but you'll
[25:15] never forget the illustration i give
[25:17] either all right
[25:19] but now think about it
[25:23] we've been talking about
[25:26] god displaying his attributes
[25:29] or his manifestations
[25:31] you know whatever you want to go through
[25:33] all right
[25:34] the fall
[25:36] brought into being
[25:39] the ability for god to display
[25:42] those attributes those manifestations
[25:44] those things all right
[25:47] he did not make us fall i put these on
[25:50] because people without pharisee
[25:52] you know they've never heard but one
[25:53] message and then they wonder what you're
[25:55] talking about
[25:56] he did not make us fall that would be
[25:58] wrong
[26:00] but he knew if he placed us on free
[26:01] moral agency that we would go wrong all
[26:04] right i mean that's just plain and
[26:06] sensible all right so then by doing that
[26:10] he permitted things to come into being
[26:14] that would allow his attributes to be
[26:18] displayed
[26:19] all right
[26:20] now i told you and i believe it
[26:23] polygamy is not an attribute
[26:27] it is a type
[26:30] be careful
[26:31] using it as an attribute
[26:34] you can say well it goes all the way
[26:35] back up that's right but remember we
[26:38] have some other things to go with it
[26:40] but just keep it in the basis of
[26:42] thinking about that he allowed polygamy
[26:44] to come into being
[26:46] to type
[26:48] christ
[26:49] and the church
[26:51] david with his many wives
[26:53] all right but none of those women could
[26:55] have another man
[26:57] see it was all his wife singular
[27:01] all right
[27:02] and and it would type christ in the
[27:04] church
[27:08] in doing that
[27:10] but here's the point i want you to think
[27:12] on because i got to thinking well i've
[27:14] covered this okay i won't go through
[27:16] that
[27:17] and then when something just keeps
[27:19] coming back okay i'm going to cover it
[27:20] because maybe it's for me
[27:22] all right you just bear with me
[27:24] you remember in the polygamy
[27:27] to show the point
[27:29] that
[27:31] it's not an attribute
[27:33] but it's a type
[27:35] that in polygamy
[27:37] the animals were allowed to go into
[27:38] polygamy
[27:41] all right
[27:44] now the animals see
[27:46] were placed into polygamy
[27:48] all right or permitted whatever your
[27:51] terminologies
[27:53] uh that you'd like to do
[27:55] uh
[27:56] permitted that to happen
[28:00] and uh
[28:03] in the type when it was fulfilled as i
[28:05] was trying to get over sunday
[28:07] when the type back there of of david and
[28:10] many wives et cetera type christ in the
[28:13] church
[28:15] it done away
[28:16] with polygamy because the prophet said
[28:18] polygamy is wrong now
[28:20] all right
[28:21] but you know what it never took away the
[28:23] polygamy in the animal
[28:26] had you ever considered that
[28:28] i tapped it a little bit sunday but
[28:30] if you considered it
[28:33] why did it not take away the animal
[28:35] kingdom because
[28:37] you know
[28:38] we look at the animals and
[28:40] and
[28:40] and we know that they don't have no soul
[28:44] you know
[28:45] and
[28:46] doings
[28:47] but remember
[28:49] that
[28:51] that animal
[28:53] now
[28:56] that animal was used in the fall now i'm
[28:59] quoting from
[29:00] page 102
[29:01] uh church age book
[29:04] ephesians church age huh
[29:06] that animal was used in the fall
[29:11] and by being used
[29:13] see brother brown said then the animal
[29:17] would be the atonement
[29:20] all right
[29:21] so then the animals were killed etc but
[29:24] they could not take away sin
[29:27] so they could only type
[29:29] the coming messiah
[29:31] all right but yet still
[29:33] they could
[29:34] cover sin
[29:37] until a time would come
[29:39] now to me that's a wonderful thing
[29:42] to think about
[29:44] that
[29:47] had the animal not been used
[29:50] he would have not made them
[29:53] involved in the atonement
[29:54] right
[29:56] i mean is that sensible
[29:58] i mean he wouldn't just walk out there
[29:59] and say hey
[30:01] sorry
[30:03] i'm going to take your life
[30:04] no
[30:05] there was a connection between the
[30:07] animal
[30:09] and the mankind
[30:11] which was the beast
[30:13] which was to fall
[30:15] in the natural right
[30:18] so then the connection was there and
[30:20] until this day and until we get into
[30:23] millennium
[30:26] because i went up that far with it
[30:28] you're going to future home that's fine
[30:30] because but i just given the quote where
[30:32] the prophet stop he said in the
[30:33] millennium it'll still be
[30:36] one jesus christ
[30:38] a many member body
[30:41] but that will be one body
[30:46] that's beautiful to me
[30:48] one body
[30:51] to be dealt with
[30:54] made up of millions of millions of
[30:56] millions of people
[30:59] right
[31:01] so then
[31:03] um
[31:04] i search for words and
[31:06] i'm a human
[31:08] so the signs of the polygamy
[31:11] will have to stay with mankind
[31:14] until
[31:16] the time of the finish
[31:19] in and the prophet brought it i said in
[31:21] the millennium
[31:22] he said it would be david with that
[31:24] all right
[31:26] now think about it
[31:29] and i want you to read the scripture
[31:31] with me so go ahead brother
[31:33] i don't know who's on the pole tonight
[31:35] my lord them boys running yourself back
[31:37] out
[31:38] yeah all right pull up number pull up
[31:40] the scripture we read in romans 8.
[31:43] you know i love it when they can they
[31:45] they turning it over these kids back
[31:47] there and letting them run this thing
[31:48] and and man that's wonderful because i
[31:51] want them to get involved
[31:53] and have their part
[31:54] and things like that and it's really a
[31:56] great thing all right
[31:58] now
[31:59] they keep pointing back our wave and hey
[32:01] there oh my that's richard back here now
[32:03] i got the picture of the ugly face i
[32:05] mean
[32:06] i saw him in the mirror
[32:08] uh but look at romans let's let's think
[32:11] about this animal
[32:13] because that's what i want you to think
[32:14] about
[32:16] my point has been for
[32:18] four or five services
[32:20] why is polygamy
[32:23] still
[32:24] after you've come to
[32:28] the fact
[32:29] of polygamy being wrong
[32:33] under the new testament because you've
[32:35] come to christ in the church
[32:37] back to one male one
[32:40] female all right now remember if you're
[32:43] going back to the beginning then you're
[32:45] going to have to go back further than
[32:46] one male and one female
[32:50] you better put them back together as
[32:52] adam was
[32:56] now is that going to be hard to think on
[33:00] because if you don't put them back to
[33:01] where adam and eve was
[33:03] you've got two people
[33:06] and you're going to be hard to deal with
[33:07] some things all right so listen
[33:10] he talks about us and the children the
[33:12] inheritance and glorified together and
[33:15] wrote it on up
[33:18] said it won't be wrecking the suffering
[33:19] you know compared with that to come all
[33:22] right pull back down just to her because
[33:24] we want to see for the earnest
[33:26] expectation of the creature
[33:30] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[33:32] sons of god
[33:33] creatures creation
[33:35] right
[33:36] that's animals
[33:38] and it's the world right the world is a
[33:41] creation
[33:42] all right see now everything's involved
[33:46] all right now
[33:48] since far the creature was made subject
[33:50] to vanity
[33:53] come on
[33:56] he was put under the curse
[33:59] now i i know the message so don't run me
[34:01] off on curse
[34:03] i know what brother brown said he didn't
[34:05] even curse adam he didn't curse he he
[34:06] cursed the earth i know that but just
[34:09] remember the word curse we'll read it in
[34:11] a minute you're still under sin curse
[34:13] all right so then you can argue
[34:15] see that's where people get in their
[34:16] minds and nowadays especially they've
[34:18] got this great computerized systems
[34:20] that whenever you say something they can
[34:22] roll out the quotes
[34:24] well okay
[34:26] but just don't roll too far
[34:29] you have rolled out on the end of your
[34:31] limb a few times and got cut off okay
[34:35] for the creature was made subject to
[34:37] vanity not willingly
[34:40] but by reason of him who has subjected
[34:42] the same in hope
[34:47] do you realize my point
[34:49] this is what i've been trying to find
[34:50] words for quite a while
[34:53] that if you do not hold polygamy
[34:56] in this day
[34:57] not by the human race now everybody
[34:59] understand me
[35:01] i've been through that
[35:03] but the sign of polygamy in the animal
[35:05] kingdom
[35:07] then how are you going to bring christ
[35:08] in his pride over in there to be
[35:11] a many-membered body
[35:14] maybe you never considered that i'm
[35:16] talking about the animal
[35:18] all right
[35:19] see the creature was made subject to man
[35:21] not willingly
[35:22] he didn't want to do that
[35:25] you remember satan entered the beast
[35:28] come on
[35:29] but by reason of him who has subjected
[35:31] to simon hope
[35:34] god put him in there
[35:35] put him into a place
[35:37] and they have to depend upon
[35:40] what he does
[35:42] right because the creature itself
[35:48] also shall be delivered from the bondage
[35:50] of corruption
[35:52] into the glorious liberty
[35:54] of the children of god
[36:00] okay
[36:04] for we know that the whole creation
[36:05] groans and travails in pain together
[36:07] until now
[36:09] but think about that animal
[36:14] satan used that animal
[36:17] to achieve his goal
[36:19] to enter the human race
[36:21] all right
[36:23] and then by using that animal then god
[36:26] said okay animal you'll be the atonement
[36:29] you'll have your part to do
[36:32] and
[36:34] now if i'm not quoting wrong it seemed
[36:35] like it was rabbi richmond was talking
[36:37] about it and it really thrilled my soul
[36:41] to think about the wording that he used
[36:44] whether or not it was
[36:45] you know
[36:46] i believed it
[36:48] but he said when that animal was laid
[36:50] down before god
[36:52] he said it was an act of love
[36:56] being displayed
[36:59] and i thought about that
[37:02] i mean that little lamb it can't do a
[37:04] thing
[37:07] you know
[37:08] no defense
[37:11] but it just lays down and gives us life
[37:14] you know
[37:18] yeah that's something to me
[37:20] that animal is going to be in heaven
[37:23] that's my personal opinion okay
[37:26] i don't say all i'm going to be there
[37:28] but them animals that with a sacrifice
[37:29] is going to be there
[37:32] it's going to be a wonderful place okay
[37:35] but think about it now
[37:36] so the animal
[37:40] was put in a conditional situation
[37:44] never what words you want to use
[37:46] to
[37:48] hold over even after you had come to the
[37:51] new birth
[37:56] you know
[37:57] it would have something to do even after
[37:59] the new birth is achieved
[38:02] you know into the individual
[38:05] because the animal has no soul he can't
[38:07] deal that away so he's not dealing in
[38:09] salvation
[38:14] but he will be dealing in the basis of
[38:16] redemption
[38:23] see he can be brought back
[38:25] in the redemptive plan
[38:28] all right
[38:30] now
[38:32] he says even and went on to that we
[38:34] grown within ourselves
[38:37] so don't forget that
[38:40] you know we're getting older we're
[38:41] getting more limited we're sicker we're
[38:44] problems running our way everything's
[38:46] going wrong and we we come to a basis
[38:51] that we're groaning
[38:53] if you're not groaning wanting to get
[38:55] out of here i'll give you a few more
[38:56] years
[38:58] you'll catch up
[39:00] i feel i i i do peggy my wife gets on to
[39:03] me all the time why the world you go to
[39:04] the doctor so she went the other day she
[39:06] said he won't tell you what's wrong with
[39:08] him
[39:09] and doctor he just looked at her
[39:12] i said because
[39:13] my confession is i'm healed
[39:18] and i hate to say i'm sick
[39:21] you know
[39:22] so i finally developed and say okay doc
[39:24] i'm wonderful i feel good
[39:27] but help is sinus problem that's killing
[39:29] me you know all right
[39:31] but you see i hate to make a negative
[39:33] confession
[39:39] cause i'm healed amen amen
[39:44] i want it to be positive i want it to be
[39:46] something that god can look down and say
[39:47] well at least he's saying it
[39:50] you know
[39:51] now i can say it back
[39:54] but now listen
[39:58] i i thought i'd done a job of doing it
[40:00] sunday to prove that
[40:02] polygamy is wrong today because that we
[40:05] come to the type of christ in the church
[40:08] and we come to the basis of being to
[40:10] work that it would be back again
[40:13] like it was in the garden
[40:15] of the you know
[40:17] one man and one woman
[40:20] and that's why we gave the scriptures
[40:22] where he says you know to
[40:24] uh
[40:25] you know there's neither male or female
[40:28] and and paul said it and they become one
[40:30] flesh
[40:32] all right
[40:34] now
[40:35] in that we should have a conception of
[40:38] knowing that we are not
[40:41] genetic
[40:42] dynamically
[40:45] we don't have the same dna
[40:46] me and my wife don't have the same dna
[40:49] uh in that we're two people
[40:52] but
[40:54] in christ
[40:56] man and his wife becomes
[40:59] the wonderful type paul speaks over the
[41:00] great mystery of christ in his church
[41:03] all right
[41:04] so then a real true wife and husband
[41:07] types christ in the church
[41:09] so you don't need no
[41:11] more typing in mankind
[41:15] now i hope you follow my point
[41:18] see by the new birth that came on the
[41:19] day of pentecost
[41:22] you have it back now i'll read right
[41:24] here what the prophet said
[41:26] back like it
[41:28] should have been
[41:31] all right
[41:33] and now you're not using polygamy as
[41:36] being okay
[41:40] you may have thought in some of the
[41:41] words that i've used to the prophet
[41:42] coming down where it says he she can't
[41:45] he can
[41:46] i made my place made myself plain
[41:50] that
[41:52] he can't unless he has a biblical
[41:55] reason
[42:00] it's not just for any calls
[42:04] that the pharisees had it
[42:06] jesus straightened that out he said you
[42:08] go back to the beginning you find
[42:10] there's one man and one woman now you
[42:11] come back and tell me about it
[42:15] you come and tell me what something is
[42:17] different than what i've told you
[42:19] all right but man and his wife is type
[42:22] of christ in the church since the day of
[42:24] pentecost
[42:26] because that's where you started the
[42:28] multiple member body
[42:31] of the lord jesus christ
[42:34] all right
[42:36] see then typing christ in the church
[42:40] bringing it to a place
[42:42] that it's a wonderful position that you
[42:45] don't need the polygamists
[42:50] see somebody come along you know when
[42:51] you i'm just hear preachers
[42:54] oh that's a wonderful house through i
[42:56] said look at that look i thought if you
[42:58] don't believe in polygamy look out there
[42:59] in the yard there's a
[43:01] rooster and a bunch of hens
[43:03] well now where does that straighten up
[43:05] that
[43:06] prostitution went up last year
[43:10] does that mean it's of god
[43:13] you say who you quoting i'm quoting
[43:14] brother brown
[43:16] right you remember him saying that
[43:18] so you think something's right just
[43:20] because of this way do you matter he
[43:22] said prostitution went up last year
[43:27] see they don't that don't make it come
[43:29] out right
[43:31] the word is what's right
[43:34] all right
[43:35] now but think about it
[43:40] see once you receive that new birth
[43:44] it puts your soul
[43:47] eternal
[43:48] all right
[43:49] right now
[43:51] all right
[43:53] now we know there's growth developments
[43:55] we know that goes on into adoption
[43:57] that's not the point i'm trying to get
[43:59] out tonight
[44:01] it's a point for us to think about
[44:05] that if we can think about that new
[44:07] birth making our soul eternal
[44:12] but here's where our problem is we hold
[44:14] over the old organized religions ways
[44:16] and thoughts
[44:18] that we think that
[44:20] well the new birth took care of that
[44:25] well
[44:28] i got a good hammer in the nail okay
[44:30] why didn't your new birth take care of
[44:32] the polygamy in the animal kingdom
[44:39] scratch your head
[44:43] it didn't take care of it
[44:46] it's still here today
[44:50] so we got to divide between the animal
[44:53] and the human
[44:55] right
[44:57] and see that the animal is still under
[44:59] that conditional situation
[45:03] but the human being by the new birth
[45:06] is not
[45:09] all right
[45:11] see there's no salvation for an animal
[45:15] you know what i mean
[45:17] there's no new birth
[45:18] it's not for him he doesn't have a soul
[45:21] so he's going to have to be brought into
[45:23] being
[45:24] in the correct order as we read
[45:28] some way
[45:29] to restore that animal back like it was
[45:36] because the new bird take care of that
[45:38] polygamy in the human race
[45:42] but it does not take care of the
[45:43] polygamy in the animal rights
[45:46] you've got to admit it's still out there
[45:49] and you've got to admit that god is
[45:50] still using it
[45:52] but he's not using it in the human race
[45:57] right
[45:59] i know i get
[46:00] hard on people and everything else and
[46:02] i'm sorry i've been accused of being
[46:04] aggravated and hateful lately i am i'm
[46:07] aggravated and hateful and upset with
[46:08] you and me
[46:12] i said you and me do i want to start on
[46:15] the front row
[46:17] and name all of you
[46:19] all right
[46:21] good to see folks we either going to get
[46:22] out of here or we go into the
[46:26] grave now i only know one way of getting
[46:29] out of here
[46:33] and i don't think it's running out of
[46:34] time
[46:36] you know
[46:38] i think it's the revealed word that has
[46:40] to be made and brought forth but now
[46:43] remember the animal
[46:45] he is not included
[46:47] in any form of uh
[46:50] uh and i know you got atonements made by
[46:53] animals for animals i know that in the
[46:56] bible so don't run off with me
[46:59] all right
[47:00] but see
[47:01] he has no way to be
[47:03] redeemed
[47:06] you know what he's waiting on
[47:09] you and i
[47:14] oh you can make an atonement for the
[47:16] donkey you can make you got all of those
[47:18] things in the bible that's what i said
[47:19] you know i have read a little bit
[47:22] but i'm just making the point
[47:25] that that animal
[47:28] he's going to have to depend on
[47:30] something else to take place
[47:34] and we are that that has to take place
[47:36] that's right
[47:38] because that's what we just read in the
[47:40] bible
[47:42] he didn't want to be put in that place
[47:44] but he was put in that place because of
[47:47] us right
[47:52] he made the atonement for us
[47:56] until the day of pentecost came the new
[47:58] birth
[48:00] and since then you don't offer the
[48:02] animal
[48:04] right why
[48:08] put another
[48:10] why is this you don't offer the animal
[48:11] today
[48:13] because christ was our atonement
[48:16] all right then christ is my husband
[48:22] in polygamy be wrong today
[48:28] but see we know that that we we're
[48:30] leaving it and let that be
[48:33] but that animal he has no ability
[48:39] no way that he can come back
[48:44] outside of
[48:47] the pride of jesus christ
[48:51] because even the atonement that was made
[48:53] at calvary
[48:54] didn't take away the polygamy in the
[48:55] animals
[48:56] that's right you've got to agree
[48:59] or do you shake head no yes or up and
[49:01] down or what you're going to do you go
[49:02] ahead
[49:04] you got to know it's true
[49:09] all right
[49:11] see then by that new birth
[49:15] we see by the what i've just proven unto
[49:18] you
[49:19] whether you think it's proved or
[49:21] whatever
[49:24] that the new birth
[49:27] cannot do
[49:28] away with your
[49:32] marital problems
[49:39] the new work don't do it
[49:40] because it only deals with the soul
[49:44] all right
[49:47] had that new birth on the day of
[49:48] pentecost come into body spirit soul
[49:53] then it'd all been finished and they'd
[49:55] walked off the earth and we wouldn't be
[49:56] part of it right
[49:59] but you see it had to wait until
[50:02] somebody could come to the right
[50:03] understanding
[50:05] all right
[50:06] but he permitted
[50:10] the polygamy until the time
[50:13] all right
[50:15] now
[50:18] so then when it comes down to the animal
[50:21] the animal
[50:23] is still
[50:24] now listen very carefully
[50:27] the animal is still under the curse
[50:31] remember how you want to say the words
[50:33] you put them together i don't have the
[50:34] education
[50:36] i know what brother brown said he didn't
[50:38] curse even he didn't curse adam he
[50:40] cursed the earth and all i know that but
[50:41] remember the animal come out of the
[50:43] earth
[50:44] are you right with me
[50:46] this body come out of the earth
[50:49] so we're going to have to deal with this
[50:50] earth
[50:52] and until we can bring this earth
[50:55] back into the correct position
[50:58] and according to what i've read
[51:02] of romans 8
[51:04] it would have to be in the days of the
[51:07] manifestation of the sons of god
[51:11] all right
[51:14] and it would have to be in this time
[51:16] that
[51:17] the earth
[51:19] has already we'll read a little while
[51:21] it's done went through justification
[51:23] in the days of noah
[51:25] the earth has went through
[51:26] sanctification in the days of
[51:30] you know the blood
[51:32] but it's to receive a fiery baptism
[51:34] which it hasn't received right
[51:37] right
[51:38] and we'll read over and then we'll come
[51:39] back so then our bodies
[51:44] our bodies
[51:46] justification works in the repentance
[51:49] part but it starts a work back out into
[51:52] the body you agree
[51:54] sanctification works back through the
[51:56] body of the cleansings and the things
[51:59] and the baptism of the holy ghost
[52:01] is the new birth in the soul to make
[52:03] that soul eternal
[52:05] all right
[52:07] now in doing that
[52:09] see you would no longer need polygamy
[52:13] because you've come to the correct order
[52:16] that jesus said in matthew 19 4 where it
[52:19] says made a male and a female
[52:22] as one flesh
[52:26] all right
[52:30] god is the only one that's eternal
[52:34] all right
[52:37] then
[52:40] the new birth
[52:44] makes each and every one of us
[52:47] heirs join ours we read
[52:50] born again christian makes your soul
[52:51] eternal but it doesn't make your body
[52:53] eternal it doesn't make your spirit
[52:55] eternal
[52:57] we got sense enough to know that all
[52:59] right
[53:00] well it don't bother me when you
[53:03] you believe that there was law you won't
[53:04] do i'm looking at you
[53:07] and you're looking at me so we don't
[53:08] have a problem
[53:09] we just know what the whole thing is
[53:12] what
[53:14] the best it is is a new birth inside of
[53:17] a person
[53:19] through justification sanctification the
[53:21] baptism of the holy ghost makes us soul
[53:22] eternal
[53:25] and it did not convert that body
[53:29] it begins to bring the body under
[53:31] subjection
[53:34] to the one that's within
[53:36] oh when i got the new birth i'll just
[53:38] set free from everything yeah
[53:41] we'll see you at the tribulation
[53:44] all right
[53:45] see the new birth places the soul of
[53:47] mankind
[53:51] back like it should have been in the
[53:52] beginning
[53:56] you believe that
[53:59] put it back just like it should have
[54:01] been in the beginning
[54:02] all right now let's just read brother
[54:04] branham
[54:05] it's way on over but i want to make sure
[54:07] to get this work he'll come in line so
[54:09] go ahead and pick up number one there
[54:12] not one a now pick up number one
[54:16] this is from the spoken word is original
[54:18] seed
[54:20] priest in 62 318
[54:23] all of god's sons must be the same yes
[54:25] sir
[54:26] to be born of the word and spirit
[54:29] brings us back to the spoken word again
[54:33] like in john 3.
[54:36] what's that you must be born again right
[54:37] you know word and spirit and
[54:41] see to be born of the water and the
[54:43] spirit what does it do
[54:46] then it brings you right back again unto
[54:49] the place of where you should have been
[54:52] at the beginning
[54:55] now is that straight enough
[54:58] i'll say this one thing excuse me
[55:01] that's the reason christ died
[55:03] to bring us back again to were
[55:05] sons of god
[55:08] the new birth
[55:11] word and spirit
[55:13] brings us back
[55:15] just like we should have been
[55:17] you know or were in the beginning
[55:19] all right
[55:21] now hold on to that point
[55:23] go over to 2 8
[55:27] take an offspring word to regional c
[55:29] and look what your prophet had to cite
[55:31] paragraph 2 16 16-18
[55:34] well that's the same thing from
[55:36] predestination
[55:39] you were supposed to be here in the
[55:40] right way
[55:42] at the beginning
[55:44] but being that you come the way you did
[55:47] you're subject to the fall
[55:50] but being that you're predestinated
[55:54] you hear the word
[55:56] it brings you right back where you were
[55:58] predestinated
[56:00] amen and watch him never saw that before
[56:05] something opened up didn't it
[56:09] from predestination to a prophet
[56:12] of what
[56:14] if we can be born of the word and spirit
[56:16] the new birth
[56:18] it brings our soul back
[56:23] to where we're predestinated
[56:28] brings you right what makes you believe
[56:30] the word of god
[56:32] and turn down these other things is
[56:34] because you
[56:35] were
[56:36] there is something in you way back you
[56:38] under
[56:39] you know
[56:41] you're supposed to live forever
[56:45] are you following me
[56:48] so your prophet says that
[56:50] the new birth makes the soul
[56:54] back in the same position
[56:59] than it was in the beginning what
[57:00] beginning is he affirmed
[57:02] when he made them male and female
[57:08] now we're going to get touchy for a
[57:09] second so
[57:11] swallow and listen
[57:16] but that new birth
[57:19] is not in the body it's not in the
[57:20] spirit
[57:22] it's in the soul
[57:24] all right
[57:28] now there's only one form of eternal
[57:29] life
[57:30] right and that's god's own life right
[57:33] all right so we receive that by the new
[57:36] birth
[57:37] and brother branham says it makes me and
[57:40] god together what did he say one time
[57:41] he'll say it's persons he'll use it like
[57:43] that
[57:44] together as one
[57:46] she realized by the new birth
[57:49] they came on the day of pentecost i go
[57:50] all the way back there see to bring
[57:51] every born-again believer
[57:54] it makes that soul
[57:56] just as eternal
[57:58] as it'll ever be
[58:01] all right
[58:03] now as i said a moment ago if you try to
[58:05] bring adam and eve and stand them side
[58:07] by side
[58:10] be careful
[58:11] you're doing okay but you've got to go
[58:13] one more step
[58:16] because if you leave them side by side
[58:18] you don't have paul's understanding of
[58:22] the man and the wife being one
[58:27] did you follow it
[58:28] you keep them side by side
[58:31] and you do not have paul's understanding
[58:34] of christ in the church
[58:36] because paul's understanding of christ
[58:38] in the church was christ in the church
[58:42] not two people
[58:44] it's christ in you the hope of glory
[58:47] all right
[58:48] so then by that new birth
[58:52] see
[58:54] it put a man in a woman back like it
[58:56] should have been in the beginning
[59:00] which was then when they was in adam
[59:03] see you stopped with me a minute ago so
[59:05] now you're gonna have to get off and
[59:06] unhook and
[59:08] pull back a little more
[59:14] see adam and
[59:16] eve brother branham says would you like
[59:19] to quote
[59:21] that he was in adam and theophany
[59:24] do you need that quote i'd be glad to
[59:26] get it for you
[59:28] eve was in adam and theophany
[59:31] see there's where we gotta lock down and
[59:33] get away from all of that that we've got
[59:34] it so much of yonder all of this is up
[59:37] there and all of these things you know
[59:39] and just sat down and think
[59:41] i know what paul said
[59:43] he said we
[59:45] if this earthly tabernacle were that's
[59:47] right which means the question will part
[59:49] to you and not done until it is we're
[59:52] dissolved we have one waiting
[59:54] i know the quotes from brother branham
[59:56] said right over there we go right over
[59:58] there he went with her and what did he
[59:59] see
[1:00:00] the angel of the lord said souls under
[1:00:02] the altar
[1:00:05] he now no problem saying that he saw
[1:00:06] those people in theophany
[1:00:12] we see we still got that mind thought
[1:00:14] of theophany up yonder well now i want
[1:00:17] to ask you one question
[1:00:20] i know questions gender strife
[1:00:25] all right
[1:00:29] how many eternal lives are they
[1:00:35] if you have the new birth you have
[1:00:36] eternal life right in here right
[1:00:39] and then you have eternal life up there
[1:00:43] because the bible says we haven't won
[1:00:44] eternally in the heavens
[1:00:46] that's the bible
[1:00:49] but now do you have two eternal lives
[1:00:52] simple question
[1:00:58] all right
[1:01:01] so we said on page 80 of the hebrew book
[1:01:02] your soul is your theophany
[1:01:05] and i know he uses the word theophany
[1:01:07] for a sinner
[1:01:08] because the word theophany means a body
[1:01:12] of deity or body for deity whatever you
[1:01:14] want to bring it because that's the the
[1:01:15] word theophany
[1:01:18] all right and he'll refer to a sinner
[1:01:21] and you know he i gave you the quote a
[1:01:23] couple of weeks ago where he went preach
[1:01:25] to those people that were souls in
[1:01:27] prison theophany
[1:01:32] jesus in theophany went to them in
[1:01:34] theophany
[1:01:35] they were sinners that were not able to
[1:01:36] come out right
[1:01:39] because it means a body you you got to
[1:01:41] go somewhere when you leave here
[1:01:46] but now when you use the word eternal
[1:01:49] right
[1:01:50] you got an entirely different then
[1:01:53] they sinner don't have eternal life
[1:01:55] come on we got away from that eternal
[1:01:56] hells
[1:01:58] you know i hope we did we'd listen to it
[1:01:59] last night where brother brown said
[1:02:01] that's one thing i got to drive down he
[1:02:02] said we just don't believe that no more
[1:02:04] you know about hell being eternal
[1:02:07] see you'd have to have eternal life to
[1:02:08] live in hell if you if hell is eternal
[1:02:10] that's sensible
[1:02:12] but those people were in their souls
[1:02:14] amen what were they
[1:02:19] you know
[1:02:20] he could see him
[1:02:22] jesus evidently good he talked to him he
[1:02:24] preached to him
[1:02:26] but he couldn't bring him out
[1:02:30] why because
[1:02:32] they were not born again
[1:02:34] and even the ones he picked up which
[1:02:36] were the old testament saints
[1:02:39] he had to pick them up into a position
[1:02:44] to even speak about
[1:02:46] doing it
[1:02:48] but see what i like is in genesis 1 this
[1:02:51] is wade's favorite topic
[1:02:53] 126-27
[1:02:54] let us make man in our own image
[1:02:59] page 80 of the hebrew book brought
[1:03:00] around said said that what man did he
[1:03:02] make he said he made a spiritual man
[1:03:05] he said now he didn't make
[1:03:08] you know all man in other words i'm
[1:03:10] paraphrasing it
[1:03:12] because you see those that's in hell
[1:03:15] that that has nothing to do with eternal
[1:03:17] life
[1:03:18] now brother brown said we'd all be
[1:03:20] better off
[1:03:22] if we believed
[1:03:23] in predestination
[1:03:26] unto no if i reuse the word wrong
[1:03:28] forgive me but he would say
[1:03:30] predestination under regeneration or he
[1:03:32] said if we believe even in
[1:03:35] predestination under reprobation
[1:03:38] you remember that in the church facebook
[1:03:41] see because there's a lot of people that
[1:03:43] are predestinated by the full knowledge
[1:03:44] of god
[1:03:46] not that he made anything but by the
[1:03:49] foreknowledge of god they will never be
[1:03:50] there
[1:03:53] all right so they predestinated under
[1:03:54] reparation but there are people who will
[1:03:57] be born again and they're predestinated
[1:03:59] under regeneration
[1:04:02] there's people predestinated like the
[1:04:03] jews the fifth seal the different ones
[1:04:05] like that that are not predestinated as
[1:04:07] far as a redemptional form here but will
[1:04:10] receive eternal life somewhere so they
[1:04:12] have a predestination
[1:04:14] but it's all god's foreknowledge
[1:04:17] keep it that way we don't have to worry
[1:04:18] about it we're back to where he said
[1:04:20] said bring us back like it was in the
[1:04:22] beginning where we were predestinated
[1:04:24] right
[1:04:26] all right
[1:04:27] so then being in that place
[1:04:31] see then there's only one
[1:04:34] soul that was created in genesis 1 26-27
[1:04:43] he said not man
[1:04:46] not a man
[1:04:47] let's see
[1:04:49] i didn't give them
[1:04:50] this one
[1:04:52] demonology
[1:04:55] priesthood 53 608
[1:04:58] physical realm
[1:04:59] but your souls were made up before the
[1:05:01] foundation of the world when god created
[1:05:03] man in his own image spirit of man not a
[1:05:07] man in his own image but man
[1:05:10] in his own image
[1:05:15] he didn't make every man in his own
[1:05:16] image
[1:05:18] they are in the bases that they're
[1:05:20] creators there are supernaturals or all
[1:05:23] kinds of things like that
[1:05:24] but
[1:05:25] he didn't make but one man genesis 1 26.
[1:05:31] now you want to argue the point we can
[1:05:33] go through a lot of prophet's message
[1:05:35] because
[1:05:37] he said genesis 1 26
[1:05:39] spiritual man first
[1:05:42] physical man second
[1:05:45] now do you want to believe that there
[1:05:47] was more than one atom created
[1:05:56] in the garden there was one man
[1:05:59] by himself that's right
[1:06:01] inside of him
[1:06:06] was a woman amen
[1:06:10] but they had the same theophany
[1:06:14] eve never had her own being until she
[1:06:16] was removed from adam that's right
[1:06:20] you agree oh yeah
[1:06:23] there wasn't two souls running around in
[1:06:24] there because that's that old doctor in
[1:06:26] backyard a long time ago you know
[1:06:31] see adam and eve was a sign
[1:06:34] now you say well all right
[1:06:36] here comes the nail
[1:06:39] on the day of pentecost
[1:06:40] there was only one soul that came into
[1:06:43] being
[1:06:44] right there was 120 in the upper room
[1:06:47] but every one of them received the same
[1:06:49] soul the soul of god
[1:06:52] which is eternal life
[1:06:54] so now there's only one eternal soul
[1:07:00] only one eternal soul
[1:07:03] can't be many eternal souls
[1:07:05] come on you want to keep it right
[1:07:06] because when we get over there
[1:07:11] it'll be jesus with a many-membered body
[1:07:15] but you know what
[1:07:16] all of that body is one soul
[1:07:20] one eternal life
[1:07:25] that's what he should we should have
[1:07:26] been in the beginning
[1:07:29] but you can only go back as jesus said
[1:07:31] back to the beginning so he says you got
[1:07:32] to go back to a point so he goes back to
[1:07:34] a point jesus does that in the beginning
[1:07:37] he made them male and female
[1:07:41] right
[1:07:43] in the beginning he made them male and
[1:07:44] female but then he made them a man and a
[1:07:48] woman
[1:07:51] right
[1:07:56] but that man and that woman both
[1:07:59] was only one person
[1:08:03] when he failed she got the name eve she
[1:08:06] never got that name to start with that
[1:08:08] was not her original name her name was
[1:08:10] adam
[1:08:15] when she failed she got the name eve
[1:08:16] which means the mother of all living
[1:08:19] all right
[1:08:21] now are you listening
[1:08:24] see your animal could not be involved in
[1:08:26] that
[1:08:33] your animal
[1:08:34] could not be involved in the genesis 1
[1:08:37] 26 and 27 man whatever you want to thank
[1:08:40] would done whatever you want to thank or
[1:08:42] how many million you think was what or
[1:08:43] whatever you want to do with it you
[1:08:45] can't put the animal there
[1:08:46] because you have no soul
[1:08:52] so
[1:08:53] in the animal kingdom polygamy is still
[1:08:55] here
[1:09:01] because we're not through typing christ
[1:09:02] in the church yet
[1:09:08] now hold on
[1:09:10] until that life member comes into the
[1:09:12] body of christ
[1:09:14] your body of christ is not complete
[1:09:21] so if there's one sitting here tonight
[1:09:22] that's not born again
[1:09:24] we're waiting on you
[1:09:28] not sitting down goofing off waiting but
[1:09:30] yeah
[1:09:31] and we're trying to find everybody
[1:09:33] trying to find that life soul right
[1:09:36] well i'm trying to find that nice person
[1:09:38] that would like to die to themselves
[1:09:41] and get born again
[1:09:43] and let jesus christ come and live
[1:09:45] inside of them
[1:09:48] and it'd be you and god together as
[1:09:50] persons
[1:09:51] your prophet would say how else can you
[1:09:53] make statements what else can you do
[1:09:56] you're talking in a human realm of
[1:09:58] languages
[1:10:02] but i hope you understand what i'm
[1:10:03] getting at
[1:10:07] see it was one man and one woman
[1:10:10] right
[1:10:11] but before then it was not one man and
[1:10:14] one woman
[1:10:16] it was one man that was male and female
[1:10:22] now not if they were filming these
[1:10:23] things that's what everybody wants to
[1:10:24] put some kind of adam would he'd walk
[1:10:26] around a little while and he'd say i
[1:10:28] don't know what you're saying and once
[1:10:29] you're straightened yeah you know
[1:10:31] because i'm acting like a woman now
[1:10:32] that's silly
[1:10:34] you say well you're silly i agree with
[1:10:36] you
[1:10:38] it's not feminist like that
[1:10:42] when he took the feminist part out of
[1:10:44] adam
[1:10:46] was adam a
[1:10:49] pervert
[1:10:52] no
[1:10:55] the only thing that was taken out of
[1:10:57] adam
[1:10:59] listen
[1:11:01] was his rib
[1:11:04] to get a flesh
[1:11:06] right right
[1:11:07] to be brought into being right
[1:11:09] and then god put into eve
[1:11:13] the feminist part right
[1:11:16] not having to take it out of adam
[1:11:21] but giving her her own being
[1:11:24] her own doings
[1:11:26] like they say you know they say the
[1:11:28] woman thinks with right-hand side of the
[1:11:29] brain
[1:11:30] so you're always in your right mind
[1:11:35] we mean we use the left-hand side
[1:11:38] that's what science says
[1:11:42] so you're in your right mind we got it
[1:11:43] all messed up
[1:11:46] but just remember
[1:11:49] the only difference between a man and a
[1:11:51] woman
[1:11:53] in the garden
[1:11:56] in the garden
[1:11:59] was when they were separated
[1:12:04] you following me
[1:12:05] then he made two people
[1:12:08] right and i've always taught you
[1:12:11] and i believe it
[1:12:14] adam
[1:12:18] you're gonna have to think a little here
[1:12:20] because when adam was physically created
[1:12:25] he was standing as the prophet said with
[1:12:26] his feet in the dirt that he came from
[1:12:30] and he said and god breathed into his
[1:12:33] nostrils
[1:12:35] and he became a living soul
[1:12:38] why does it stated exactly like that
[1:12:42] because if god put his own soul
[1:12:46] into adam without it being any
[1:12:49] connection to adam that would have been
[1:12:51] jesus
[1:12:55] come on
[1:12:58] so you better give adam a body a spirit
[1:13:02] and a soul
[1:13:06] as a human mortal
[1:13:12] yeah if i'm wrong show me
[1:13:15] because if he'd just been body and
[1:13:17] spirit and god put his own life in there
[1:13:19] that would have been the first adam
[1:13:20] which would have been christ
[1:13:27] i'll give you something to think i'm
[1:13:28] going
[1:13:30] but you see he created him body spirit
[1:13:32] and soul and he's standing there then
[1:13:34] god breathed his own breath of life into
[1:13:37] him
[1:13:38] well all he done is reached over and got
[1:13:39] eve
[1:13:40] and just pulled her out
[1:13:43] of
[1:13:44] adam and made a body
[1:13:48] and he gave her a spirit and a soul
[1:13:54] come on
[1:13:58] so she's
[1:14:00] body spirit and soul just like adam
[1:14:04] then he puts eternal life
[1:14:06] which was his life
[1:14:09] into adam and eve
[1:14:12] you see if i didn't believe it that way
[1:14:13] i preached eve didn't have nothing to
[1:14:14] start with
[1:14:16] i don't believe it
[1:14:18] i'm always wondering why some preachers
[1:14:20] didn't come along preach it that way but
[1:14:22] eve didn't have nothing to start with
[1:14:25] eve was a mortal human being
[1:14:31] that's how she could fall
[1:14:34] she couldn't fault his soul with her
[1:14:36] soul being eternal
[1:14:38] in the basis of
[1:14:40] staying with the theophany that was in
[1:14:41] adam to start with
[1:14:43] so she had to be separated
[1:14:47] give her a body spirit and soul let her
[1:14:49] stand there
[1:14:52] adam's already been body spirit and soul
[1:14:55] god breathed into his nostrils so what
[1:14:56] was the problem with him breathing in
[1:14:58] the aids
[1:14:59] nostrils
[1:15:00] and her becoming a living soul
[1:15:03] but you see that was the beginning of
[1:15:04] the creation remember now
[1:15:07] we got all night
[1:15:09] you remember the beginning of the
[1:15:10] creation is different from the
[1:15:12] everything else
[1:15:13] he don't create nothing wrong to start
[1:15:15] with
[1:15:16] so he's the beginning of the creation of
[1:15:18] god
[1:15:19] so then that's got to be right to start
[1:15:21] with so the beginning has got to be the
[1:15:22] perfect point that's why he won't sit
[1:15:24] back
[1:15:27] not just adam and eve standing one side
[1:15:30] by side that cannot type christ in the
[1:15:32] church
[1:15:35] get you and i out of the way
[1:15:38] and let's see christ
[1:15:40] standing in a body that's right
[1:15:43] that's why i didn't agree with him when
[1:15:44] i brought it out i tried my best to
[1:15:46] explain to the brothers talking about
[1:15:47] the parousia or parasia
[1:15:52] which means the presence of god
[1:15:56] i tried my best to explain that to him
[1:15:58] so listen brother i don't want god's
[1:16:00] tanning was tied to me
[1:16:04] oh you think i i wish he walked with me
[1:16:07] all the time i walk with him and i talk
[1:16:10] with him
[1:16:13] just remember
[1:16:15] he was walking in the garden when adam
[1:16:17] and eve done what they done so now go
[1:16:19] play your games
[1:16:23] i don't want him standing beside of me i
[1:16:26] want him inside of me because if he's
[1:16:28] inside of me i cannot be destroyed
[1:16:34] am i right
[1:16:36] he couldn't even destroy
[1:16:38] sarah
[1:16:39] because he was so much of adam i mean
[1:16:42] abraham right
[1:16:45] why can't we see what redemption is
[1:16:47] that's right
[1:16:49] everybody's always wanted to try to
[1:16:50] prove we back there
[1:16:54] i thought redemption was to take place
[1:16:56] here
[1:16:59] i didn't think it was supposed to take
[1:17:01] me back before the world
[1:17:05] i thought it was supposed to bring me to
[1:17:06] where i should have been
[1:17:09] had there been no fall
[1:17:12] come on you can predestinate yourself
[1:17:14] out of existence and don't even realize
[1:17:16] it
[1:17:18] i want to go back where i was
[1:17:20] well then if you go back where you was
[1:17:22] that was before the foundation of the
[1:17:24] world and you're only in the mind of god
[1:17:28] now that's what your prophet had to say
[1:17:29] so go ahead
[1:17:32] you see that's why i make those planes
[1:17:34] blunt plain
[1:17:36] i'm tired right not tired physically
[1:17:41] i'm tired of the foolishness that satan
[1:17:43] has packed upon the people
[1:17:46] in their minds
[1:17:51] you don't understand what i mean if
[1:17:52] you're going to go back where you come
[1:17:53] from you go clean out of existence as a
[1:17:55] human being
[1:18:00] whatever you would be back there you'd
[1:18:01] have no recognition of a human being
[1:18:04] and that would not be god's plan and
[1:18:06] purpose
[1:18:07] right that would not be his attributes
[1:18:09] on display
[1:18:10] he couldn't display his attributes
[1:18:12] before the world were you agreeing
[1:18:14] he had to let man come into the fall
[1:18:17] to display the attributes
[1:18:19] let me stay over here
[1:18:22] i don't want to go back now
[1:18:24] because i go out of existence
[1:18:29] you say well
[1:18:30] i don't understand you i agree i don't
[1:18:32] understand myself but i know one thing
[1:18:34] for sure if that statement ain't right i
[1:18:35] want you to explain it to me
[1:18:39] well what it was brother there back for
[1:18:41] the world it was just this great big
[1:18:43] thing and we were all up there having a
[1:18:44] wonderful time and we would just all
[1:18:45] shout and glory hallelujah and we
[1:18:47] decided to come to earth
[1:18:48] that is a mormon doctrine
[1:18:54] i don't know against the mormons
[1:18:56] but that's their doctrine
[1:18:58] that we was up in heaven with father
[1:19:03] and we decided to come to earth
[1:19:05] and be
[1:19:06] lost the worst part of it was
[1:19:12] the devil wanted to save us all
[1:19:14] that's the mormon doctrine
[1:19:17] the devil wanted to save every person
[1:19:22] but said jesus come along with the idea
[1:19:23] to save so many
[1:19:25] and father took jesus's idea come on
[1:19:28] i've talked to
[1:19:30] with the high ranks
[1:19:32] because i wouldn't make the statement if
[1:19:34] i didn't
[1:19:36] i talked with the guy that's got the
[1:19:38] little
[1:19:39] drawing things but on his shorts
[1:19:43] if you think i don't know what i'm
[1:19:44] talking about
[1:19:48] ever what that little thing's got to pee
[1:19:49] in the middle and draw the pen around
[1:19:54] signal the eternal life
[1:19:56] but listen
[1:19:58] i don't want to go that way
[1:20:01] and i don't want to go that way
[1:20:05] i want to be
[1:20:07] what i'm supposed to be
[1:20:09] right here now
[1:20:12] and sitting here
[1:20:14] in this situation
[1:20:16] even though it's a falling point
[1:20:20] but yet happy
[1:20:22] because
[1:20:23] of knowing what my father is doing
[1:20:29] do i need to go back and preach again
[1:20:34] the prophet said to be born the word and
[1:20:35] spirit takes you back like you should
[1:20:37] have been in the beginning
[1:20:40] you realize that soul is just as eternal
[1:20:42] tonight if you have eternal life just as
[1:20:44] eternal as god is because it's god's own
[1:20:46] life that's right
[1:20:49] yeah but you just don't leave enough of
[1:20:50] us to be anything
[1:20:55] sorry
[1:20:58] that's our problem
[1:21:02] may i say this
[1:21:04] our problem is we want to be some
[1:21:07] you just don't make us anything
[1:21:12] well
[1:21:16] i think i stand behind
[1:21:19] millions of
[1:21:21] true christians
[1:21:23] to make this statement
[1:21:26] the fox book of martyrs they took them
[1:21:27] out and burned them killed them burn
[1:21:29] them cooked them
[1:21:30] done everything in the book
[1:21:33] and you know all they wanted was for
[1:21:35] christ to live in them
[1:21:38] and not nothing of their own
[1:21:45] not nothing of their own
[1:21:48] i'm gonna say this and then back off
[1:21:51] we'll get to it sunday
[1:21:53] see people want the grace of marriage
[1:21:54] and divorce
[1:21:56] but remember it's only for your past
[1:22:00] why don't you accept what god has given
[1:22:02] you
[1:22:05] and forget about trying to do anything
[1:22:08] else right that's the answer right there
[1:22:11] what's wrong
[1:22:13] what if i'm free i got it right
[1:22:18] okay
[1:22:20] make a little more
[1:22:26] all creation is groaning
[1:22:29] let's go to number seven just for a
[1:22:31] minute because we got to quit
[1:22:34] the god of this evil age
[1:22:36] paragraph 187 through 189
[1:22:40] and look what he says
[1:22:42] but the greatest of all healings they
[1:22:44] talk about healings and deliverance
[1:22:49] if you heal their physical body from
[1:22:51] cancer tb pneumonia except they'll get
[1:22:54] sick again no doubt
[1:22:56] if they live very long for their body is
[1:22:59] still under sin
[1:23:01] the curse
[1:23:06] but let them get the real divine healing
[1:23:08] the healing of the soul
[1:23:09] which makes a new creature passes from
[1:23:11] death into life and then waiting
[1:23:14] in these old tabernacles for the
[1:23:17] redemption of the body after the soul
[1:23:19] has been redeemed right granted lord
[1:23:24] all right read fast
[1:23:26] number eight revelations chapter 5
[1:23:30] 61
[1:23:32] and look where he's reading from he's
[1:23:34] reading from romans 8.
[1:23:37] the whole creation is droning waiting
[1:23:40] for the adoption to it the redemption of
[1:23:42] our bodies to understand the redemption
[1:23:44] of our bodies to it means to understand
[1:23:47] to come to a place do you see it all
[1:23:49] creation is groaning said paul
[1:23:51] everything's groaning look at the trees
[1:23:53] how they struggle look at the flowers
[1:23:54] how they struggle for life just for the
[1:23:57] frost to tear them down look at the
[1:23:59] trees how they struggle to hold their
[1:24:01] branches out to sing glories unto god
[1:24:04] see everything all nature all animals
[1:24:07] all birds how he flies
[1:24:09] from the enemy quickly and gets away
[1:24:11] everything groaning and we ourselves
[1:24:13] said paul we've grown too with them for
[1:24:16] we are waiting for the redemption of our
[1:24:19] body
[1:24:21] but i was took care of when i got born
[1:24:22] again
[1:24:24] well i'm sorry
[1:24:26] i just blowed some bubbles i guess 105.
[1:24:28] but now now they did all those years
[1:24:31] until now now we have the earnest of our
[1:24:34] inheritance look at it
[1:24:35] oh my what do we have we have the
[1:24:38] evidence that god lives
[1:24:41] we have the evidence that god is with us
[1:24:45] we have the evidence that god has not
[1:24:47] forsaken us
[1:24:48] that we are he is and he is ours because
[1:24:51] we
[1:24:52] in our bodies
[1:24:54] we now tabernacle the holy spirit of god
[1:24:57] that cries out now thy father and
[1:24:59] there's nothing can ever take that away
[1:25:02] we are anchored in christ
[1:25:04] now the trees does not have it
[1:25:08] nature
[1:25:09] does not have it
[1:25:11] but yet we are still groaning you
[1:25:12] understand what i mean
[1:25:14] all the time i spent nature can't be
[1:25:16] born again they can't be done
[1:25:17] something's got to happen the trees does
[1:25:19] not have it nature don't have it but yet
[1:25:21] we're still groaning with them because
[1:25:23] with them because as yet we haven't
[1:25:25] received the fullness of our adoption
[1:25:28] but we have the earnest of it
[1:25:31] that we have picked up from the things
[1:25:33] of the world
[1:25:35] and now become sons and daughters of god
[1:25:38] what kind of people should we be oh my
[1:25:40] when we think of that think of it now we
[1:25:42] have the earnest our spirits groaning
[1:25:45] for the full adoption but now we have
[1:25:47] the earnest of it
[1:25:49] and as
[1:25:50] as we receive the holy spirit it is the
[1:25:53] earnest of our complete adoption our
[1:25:55] complete salvation oh how beautiful i
[1:25:59] just love that all right
[1:26:01] we are waiting for the fullness of
[1:26:03] adoption
[1:26:04] this will take place when
[1:26:06] at the first resurrection
[1:26:09] that's when our bodies will be changed
[1:26:11] from these vile creatures that we are
[1:26:13] and we'll have a body like unto his own
[1:26:15] glorious body far we shall see him as he
[1:26:18] is and we will be like him
[1:26:19] when he appears we appear in his
[1:26:21] likeness we will have a body like he is
[1:26:24] a glorious glorified body and all the
[1:26:26] trials and struggles of life will fade
[1:26:29] off into a little mist and blow away
[1:26:32] to never be no more and these earthly
[1:26:34] tabernacles which we have
[1:26:36] which we now grown in we're waiting for
[1:26:39] that earnest that earnest for the
[1:26:42] salvation fully in his fullness
[1:26:44] to come
[1:26:46] but now in these tabernacles of clay we
[1:26:49] have something that tells us that we
[1:26:51] have raised up so far
[1:26:54] amen what is the earnest it's a little
[1:26:56] down payment
[1:26:57] it holds us
[1:27:00] think about him
[1:27:02] think about the great
[1:27:04] understanding
[1:27:07] let me see if i can find one more
[1:27:08] there's one more i wanted to read
[1:27:11] because it's taken from the seal book

[1:27:52] this will take place at the first
[1:27:54] resurrection see nature is groaning we

[1:27:58] because we realize there's something not
[1:28:00] right and the only way you can groan and
[1:28:02] wait for it is to is because that you
[1:28:05] have been
[1:28:06] because there has been new life come in

[1:28:36] by that germ when it was shed at calvary
[1:28:39] dropped back upon the earth what for to
[1:28:41] redeem the earth now it's been justified

[1:29:11] justification case of baptism of the
[1:29:12] holy ghost and redeemed your soul and

[1:29:23] where he says your redemption is already
[1:29:25] paid for everything's paid for

[1:29:29] days there's got to be something come

[1:29:33] calvary okay because i missed that and
[1:29:35] you being part of the earthly redeemed
[1:29:36] you're in the process now it's growing

[1:29:40] your body was justified under noah's
[1:29:42] baptism amen in your flesh when it
[1:29:44] dropped upon there and the earth is to
[1:29:46] be cleansed by fire the place where you
[1:29:48] live with the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:29:50] a dwelling place for christ and his
[1:29:52] bride the new jerusalem
[1:29:55] let's see that on yeah
[1:30:05] your body is being redeemed
[1:30:08] to me that's what this statue of a
[1:30:09] perfect man is about
[1:30:13] it's in the inner man
[1:30:15] but it's working back out through the
[1:30:16] outer man
[1:30:18] to try to bring us to a place of
[1:30:20] full redemption
[1:30:23] you know
[1:30:24] and uh
[1:30:26] in doing it the whole world's waiting
[1:30:29] on you and i
[1:30:32] that can't be
[1:30:35] a world brought into a redemptive form
[1:30:38] unless this world here
[1:30:42] is first brought into that form
[1:30:45] then when this world is brought into
[1:30:47] that form
[1:30:48] i hope you're following me
[1:30:50] the animals will come
[1:30:55] because they also come out of this earth
[1:30:59] and this world will come
[1:31:02] brother branham on the future home he
[1:31:04] talks about he said they're on the river
[1:31:06] jordan
[1:31:07] where it come down on him he said i've
[1:31:09] redeemed this part of the earth and from
[1:31:11] this part of the earth i'll redeem the
[1:31:13] rest of it
[1:31:16] god done it at calvary we know that
[1:31:19] but there was mystery secrets
[1:31:21] that were left and one of those is
[1:31:24] the full
[1:31:27] understanding of adoption
[1:31:30] to finish with the redemption of these
[1:31:32] bodies
[1:31:34] then it'll all be over with
[1:31:36] right
[1:31:38] it'd be a wonderful place a wonderful
[1:31:40] time
[1:31:42] when we all get there in the way we're
[1:31:44] supposed to be
[1:31:45] amen
[1:31:47] there's no disgrace by dying and going
[1:31:49] by the grave
[1:31:52] sister cleda used to say she's i just
[1:31:54] get to beat you up
[1:31:56] yeah
[1:31:57] see because you go by the grave i'm
[1:31:59] going to raise for you too so i'm just
[1:32:01] going to get ahead of you
[1:32:02] and if you'll notice the point
[1:32:04] i try to make it
[1:32:06] but random never went to as much in the
[1:32:08] change of the body
[1:32:12] as he took the adoption
[1:32:14] to the resurrection
[1:32:18] you notice that you follow it
[1:32:20] if you don't read the message
[1:32:22] you know why
[1:32:25] because if they can be a resurrection
[1:32:27] you ain't got to worry about nothing now
[1:32:31] if they can be a resurrection you ain't
[1:32:33] got to worry about these rapture
[1:32:36] change
[1:32:38] i'm interested in the resurrection
[1:32:41] that's why downstairs come on musicians
[1:32:43] downstairs these pictures are the ones
[1:32:44] that are pine stone
[1:32:47] i don't know what to look like
[1:32:49] because when somebody comes in
[1:32:51] and i say yeah there
[1:32:53] well that's brother tatum and a little
[1:32:55] sister tatum you know
[1:33:00] see i don't know what to look like
[1:33:04] because i believe they'll be here
[1:33:06] then the bible says that we which are
[1:33:07] alive and remain shall be what
[1:33:10] changed and then we're caught up
[1:33:13] right everybody wants to caught up
[1:33:15] caught up
[1:33:16] i want the resurrection
[1:33:22] this comes next
[1:33:26] ever how you think it will come or what
[1:33:28] you think about just remember the next
[1:33:31] thing is the resurrection
[1:33:33] but we're so good at quoting brother
[1:33:35] branham until i remember he made the
[1:33:37] statement one time like this and we're
[1:33:38] so carnal he said if i don't see you
[1:33:41] anymore i'll see you in the millennium
[1:33:44] you remember that statement
[1:33:47] well according to that the millennium's
[1:33:48] the next thing
[1:33:52] well that's not exactly right
[1:33:54] because there's got to be a resurrection
[1:33:57] a change
[1:33:58] a tribulation
[1:34:01] you know a lot of things
[1:34:04] we see but i just told you what he said
[1:34:11] um
[1:34:12] judas went and hung himself you go do
[1:34:13] likewise i just told you what he said
[1:34:19] see you can quote all day long
[1:34:22] but i love it and i've got it in my
[1:34:24] bible here somewhere that brother
[1:34:25] branham gives an order and i wrote it
[1:34:27] down i remember this years ago
[1:34:30] he gave an order he said the next is the
[1:34:32] rapture
[1:34:33] tribulation you know to the jews
[1:34:36] in in armageddon
[1:34:38] and he said then the millennium
[1:34:41] and then gog and magog and then future
[1:34:43] home
[1:34:46] well i don't care what he says
[1:34:48] if he says the next time i see you i'll
[1:34:50] see you in the tribulation
[1:34:55] ain't no rapture took place yet
[1:34:58] so that ain't the next thing
[1:35:01] you see what we can do we can quote
[1:35:03] ourselves to death
[1:35:07] that's why those pharisees couldn't
[1:35:09] understand jesus
[1:35:10] especially nicodemus now you tell me
[1:35:12] that man didn't know a lot and you tell
[1:35:14] me like i told you here a few weeks ago
[1:35:16] you think that's a five-minute sermon
[1:35:18] right there i believe
[1:35:20] jesus and nicodemus are probably
[1:35:21] together for half a day or more
[1:35:24] you can argue all you want to watch what
[1:35:26] you believe
[1:35:27] it ain't going to change that part to me
[1:35:29] because he didn't just sit down and say
[1:35:31] you must be born again
[1:35:34] they they probably talked about the
[1:35:35] scriptures the great things that was in
[1:35:38] the scriptures
[1:35:41] and nicodemus would agree with every bit
[1:35:42] of it
[1:35:43] even the coming messiah
[1:35:46] you know on the things
[1:35:48] but then we said okay
[1:35:51] you must be born again oh
[1:35:54] you got in something i never know i
[1:35:55] don't know about him
[1:36:00] but he couldn't understand it
[1:36:02] do we understand it what do we got
[1:36:04] 138 inspirations just hand together
[1:36:08] sorry being just a little bit late
[1:36:10] tonight but uh
[1:36:11] i wanted to get that point about the
[1:36:12] animals oh nothing less it ties into the
[1:36:15] next jesus blood and righteousness why
[1:36:20] don't i trust the sweetest
[1:36:33] anybody have a need
[1:36:35] sinking sin
[1:36:50] i believe in divine healing
[1:36:54] and i believe
[1:36:55] anchor holds within the veil on christ
[1:37:00] the solid rock
[1:37:03] all other grounded
[1:37:31] for adoption
[1:37:40] somebody's gonna do it
[1:37:41] why can't we say we are
[1:37:56] don't let me stand in the way of
[1:37:57] somebody that can you remember that
[1:38:14] i can't stand that if you want to
[1:38:16] aggravate me at all just be down and out
[1:38:23] why can't we be happy and joyous
[1:38:26] jesus
[1:38:28] said brother pray
[1:38:42] why can't we believe that away
[1:38:45] and get away from our petty little
[1:38:47] feelings you know well
[1:38:49] just down and out if you if you had
[1:38:51] everything i had you'd be down and out
[1:38:53] too
[1:38:56] wowsy wowsy woo
[1:38:59] and then what brother forney says
[1:39:01] you never get nowhere with those wowzy
[1:39:11] that is wowzies me
[1:39:14] greater is he that is in me
[1:39:18] than he that is in the world
[1:39:23] satan's like
[1:39:32] seeking whom he may devour
[1:39:37] the bible tells us so
[1:39:41] many souls have been his prayer to fall
[1:39:46] in some wake up
[1:39:50] but god has promised
[1:40:03] jesus
[1:40:08] greater is he that is in me
[1:40:12] than he that is
[1:40:24] um
[1:40:25] sister monica called did the reason they
[1:40:27] wouldn't hear that they were sick
[1:40:29] so let's just believe
[1:40:31] and ask the lord to take care of all
[1:40:32] things aren't
[1:40:33] our little sister standing in for him so
[1:40:35] let's believe
[1:40:36] father
[1:40:39] we know that there'd be something wrong
[1:40:40] with bob and him they'd be here tonight
[1:40:42] lord
[1:40:43] we're just asking now that you honor the
[1:40:44] prayers of your faith and for our little
[1:40:46] sister here that would have the
[1:40:48] faith to come down and believe
[1:40:50] for the family there and that they'd all
[1:40:52] be all right
[1:40:53] we ask you to take away the sicknesses
[1:40:56] we committed to you now in jesus name
[1:41:00] anybody
[1:41:03] he else
[1:41:04] is in me
[1:41:06] then he that is in mercy on the day
[1:41:11] on the day of pentecost
[1:41:15] a rushing mighty
[1:41:25] all of them
[1:41:44] troubles we can go sympathize with him
[1:41:48] lord
[1:41:49] and we we just lay our hands there
[1:41:51] believing
[1:41:52] that by your stripes
[1:41:54] you'll take away this coffin
[1:41:56] from this world of things that's causing
[1:41:58] it
[1:41:59] in jesus name
[1:42:16] don't forget the bible study saturday
[1:42:18] and pray one for another you're
[1:42:19] dismissed greater is he that is in me
[1:42:24] greater is he that is in me
[1:42:28] the greater is he that
[1:42:33] is in the world
[1:42:37] satan's like a roaring lion
[1:42:45] seeking who he may divide
[1:42:49] the bible tells us so
[1:42:54] many souls have been his prey
[1:42:58] to fall in some sweet car
[1:43:02] but god is promised us today
[1:43:06] is overcome
[1:43:13] you
