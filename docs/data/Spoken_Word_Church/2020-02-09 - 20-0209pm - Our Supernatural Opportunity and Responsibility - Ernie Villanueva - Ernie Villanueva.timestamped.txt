[8:31] [Music]
[8:48] they didn't see everybody in the House
[8:53] of Lords we have some back there that
[8:55] look like our visitors but we always
[8:57] call you visitors when you come one time
[8:59] then tone you just part of us
[9:01] so just welcome and all I guess you can
[9:03] be seated for a minute but we got a
[9:06] little testimony that he's promised me
[9:09] the other day that he'd give it today so
[9:11] I guess that's why we got one this one
[9:14] service all right well good afternoon I
[9:36] guess I'll go ahead and start off by
[9:39] saying that uh when I was about 18 I I
[9:46] started going to ung University of North
[9:50] Georgia College and I kind of went with
[9:55] a an open mindset because I wasn't
[9:59] really born again I didn't have
[10:02] something to keep me grounded in the
[10:04] Word of God
[10:07] of course I've been going to youth camps
[10:11] all my life and stuff like that so I've
[10:14] had experiences with God and I've seen
[10:16] him in the services and I felt his
[10:18] presence but I never really had
[10:20] something within me to you know ground
[10:23] and keep me and God so when I started
[10:26] going to college after being
[10:27] homeschooled all my life and you know
[10:29] not really being exposed much of the
[10:33] world that those influences being around
[10:39] the long run people kind of took me out
[10:40] and I started getting involved in things
[10:44] that I should have gotten involved in
[10:45] and you just open yourself up to those
[10:49] spirits and they take hold of you know
[10:51] and so I was oh it wasn't a good place
[10:55] in my life and I kind of fell down into
[10:58] this deep hole that I couldn't get out
[11:02] of on my own and one thing I learned
[11:07] very quickly is once you once you start
[11:12] dabbling in sin sin will always take you
[11:15] farther than you want to go or to go so
[11:19] I learned that very quickly and I tried
[11:23] to bring myself out of that place many
[11:27] times on my own but I couldn't yeah I
[11:34] just you you can't do it on your own
[11:36] it's it's physically impossible I need
[11:39] God to bring you out of that and it took
[11:43] me a while to realize that it took me
[11:45] about one and a half to two years to
[11:47] realize that
[11:48] and um God was dealing with me
[11:52] throughout that entire time but um I
[11:56] just couldn't fully give myself over I
[11:59] couldn't fully surrender and I yeah I
[12:07] just I kind of got stuck in this loop of
[12:11] just just going around and sin over and
[12:17] over like I would be like God just just
[12:20] take this away from me take take these
[12:21] things these desires for the world that
[12:24] I have but I just couldn't fully give
[12:29] myself over I saw I'd be like okay well
[12:33] I have this thing that I can give up but
[12:36] then I have to give up this other thing
[12:38] and I don't quite want to let go of yet
[12:40] and um so it was just as a really bad
[12:45] place to being and it was depressing and
[12:48] and really hard um but then I I started
[12:54] getting really desperate because I
[12:58] started realizing well how is this gonna
[13:01] help me in life
[13:03] as this taking me you know to to a good
[13:05] place a place that's gonna help me in
[13:07] the future is it gonna make me um
[13:11] it's not making me a good son it's not
[13:13] gonna make me a good husband in the
[13:15] future it's not gonna make me a good
[13:17] father so I really started realizing the
[13:26] effect that it was having home and so I
[13:32] really got desperate and started asking
[13:34] God for more of a desperation to read
[13:36] his word and to get closer to him and I
[13:41] just kept praying for that over and over
[13:43] and I just asked him to take the desire
[13:45] for the things of the world and
[13:46] everything that I was dealing with and
[13:49] one day I just I realized that there was
[13:54] this this desire to read the Word of God
[13:57] more and actually get in his word
[14:00] because before that I I didn't even want
[14:02] to read the Bible like I didn't really
[14:04] have the desire at all I didn't think
[14:09] there was a need for it in my life I
[14:11] didn't I thought I even got to the point
[14:12] where I was I was kind of getting or I
[14:15] was thinking to myself that maybe it was
[14:19] too late for me and maybe uh you know
[14:22] God I just gone too far I had let go um
[14:27] I had maybe just that wasn't trying hard
[14:32] enough time to let go of the things of
[14:35] the world but you gotta have God take
[14:38] that from you you gotta have God yeah
[14:40] he's he's the only answer and he's the
[14:42] only thing that can completely transform
[14:45] your life so it just took me a while to
[14:48] realize that on my own so I started
[14:54] reading the Bible I'm just just feeding
[14:57] myself full of the word as much as I
[14:59] could and as much as you know I I just
[15:05] kind of I would read my Bible that night
[15:09] and just whenever I thought about it you
[15:11] know I pick up my Bible and read it in
[15:13] just and just I the more that I did that
[15:16] I realized the desire for a new group
[15:20] and I just kept feeding myself and
[15:23] stuffing myself fool the worried and so
[15:26] I talked to my dad about what I was
[15:28] going through and he knew you know my
[15:31] parents knew that I was going through a
[15:33] time in my life where I needed prayer
[15:36] and I knew that they were praying for me
[15:38] and I think that has a lot to do with
[15:44] coming to the Lord a lot so my dad told
[15:53] me to keep reading the Bible and that
[15:54] God is obligated to keep his word and he
[16:00] said that to me one time long I think
[16:04] was January night of January 6th yeah he
[16:09] came in my room and he told me that that
[16:11] God is obligated to keep his word and
[16:13] when you get born again it's like God
[16:17] stepping out in front of him and saying
[16:19] you're right now for the first time in
[16:21] my life that really like hit me all of a
[16:25] sudden and I realized wow I want that so
[16:29] bad and I just felt like this desire
[16:32] it's so strong to just completely let go
[16:37] of everything and surrender myself fully
[16:41] so um I started crying after he said
[16:44] that and yeah I just said I want that so
[16:48] bad and I just I prayed and I read my
[16:51] Bible that night and I went to sleep and
[16:53] I you know I felt pretty good but I
[16:55] didn't feel like I had what I needed
[16:56] yeah I didn't feel like I had that born
[16:58] again born again experience that I was
[17:00] searching for so um the next day the
[17:06] night of January 7th I'll never forget
[17:09] that day I was reading my Bible and I
[17:14] was I was by myself I was just you know
[17:18] spending time with God and I was reading
[17:22] acts 2 I got to verse 21 and it said
[17:27] initial come to pass that whosoever
[17:28] shall call on the name of the Lord shall
[17:29] be saved
[17:31] and that's when I hit me and that's when
[17:35] I knew that I knew that I knew I felt
[17:48] this this this well I started praying
[17:53] right after that and I was like God you
[17:56] said it in your word that whosoever and
[17:58] that's me calls on the name of the Lord
[18:00] shall be saved
[18:01] and so I just kept praying over and over
[18:04] God fill me with the new birth just give
[18:06] it to me so that I don't have to go in
[18:07] this loop again so that I can be settled
[18:09] and rooted in the word for the rest of
[18:12] my life because you know I don't want to
[18:15] have to go through that again and I just
[18:19] I want to serve you the rest of my life
[18:22] and I laid it all before him completely
[18:26] and I felt this I know you don't have to
[18:30] have a feeling or anything like that
[18:32] but I felt this feeling come over me it
[18:34] wasn't like a strong presence or
[18:36] anything it was a warm feeling of the
[18:38] presence of God and I was just repeating
[18:42] over and over God filming with the new
[18:43] birth filled me with the new birth and
[18:45] this thought was inserted into my mind
[18:47] and I know it was on my own it wasn't an
[18:50] audible voice or anything it was just a
[18:51] thought and it said you only had to ask
[18:53] me one time
[18:56] [Applause]
[19:02] so that was it that settled it and ever
[19:06] since then I've been able to see God
[19:08] directing my life and everything that I
[19:12] desired before completely out of my life
[19:15] I felt like my personalities changed my
[19:19] entire nature the person I was before is
[19:22] just gone I'm dead on the ground
[19:25] and that's an amazing feeling so I'm
[19:30] proud to say that I'm I'm a Christian
[19:32] and I'm bleeding on the ward to go out
[19:33] today Thank You mr. Moni let's stand
[19:51] together
[19:51] everybody knows brother Ernie he doesn't
[19:54] out to be introduced thank you for
[19:57] coming down we thought was gonna be
[19:59] missing all the services our heart but
[20:01] it turned around and we got here this
[20:03] evening so that's why it's all the doing
[20:06] and the Lord will take care of it we had
[20:08] a testimony meeting and I will get to
[20:10] the to the word of the Lord so let's
[20:12] just saying open the eyes of my heart
[20:14] it's better Ernie Villanueva comes to
[20:16] minister unto us opening
[20:20] [Music]
[20:49] [Applause]
[20:53] I want to see
[21:00] [Music]
[22:10] amen and a lesson until God does open
[22:15] the eyes of our heart then we're living
[22:18] beneath our privileges and there's only
[22:21] one thing greater in life than happiness
[22:24] and that's holiness and the thing is you
[22:28] don't get holy in a hurry it takes time
[22:31] to be holy it takes time to recognize
[22:34] that we in this journey down on earth
[22:37] we're just a little a speck of Earth
[22:40] that God has quickened just temporarily
[22:43] with this brilliant light of his gospel
[22:45] to become a part of the family of God
[22:48] and to fulfill the purpose that God had
[22:50] in the beginning and that was to have a
[22:52] bride that would rule and reign with him
[22:55] throughout eternity god bless you
[22:58] you can have your seats for just a
[22:59] moment and I'd like to give a little
[23:01] testimony I want to keep it real short
[23:04] and say if you don't mind if I could
[23:07] speak like a northerner because I came
[23:09] from Rhode Island and I was just back
[23:11] there a couple of months ago and and it
[23:14] was really it was really a unique
[23:15] experience to get around my family and
[23:18] to see how fast they talked they would
[23:19] tell me what an accent that I had so I
[23:22] went to my church and I asked if I would
[23:25] be able to speak like a northerner so I
[23:27] could speak a lot in a little bit of
[23:29] time so they said it was okay so many
[23:32] years ago I had always wanted to find
[23:34] somebody else that was in the message
[23:36] from the state of Rhode Island and for
[23:39] thirty years the answer was no no no
[23:42] never found one person in the entire
[23:44] message from Rhode Island so a few years
[23:47] ago I was in Massachusetts with brother
[23:49] of Simon Peter Sesay and asked that
[23:51] question again it was no and then a
[23:54] couple of years later I was visiting my
[23:56] mom in Rhode Island and from the airport
[23:59] there's a little little airport from
[24:01] there to my mother's house is three
[24:03] miles and in the middle of that that
[24:05] trip I got a phone call from this
[24:08] brother Matthew who was in that meeting
[24:10] in Massachusetts who I had not seen for
[24:13] two years and he said brother Ernie the
[24:15] Lord has led me to start a church in
[24:17] Rhode Island so wow I was that was
[24:20] amazing so we met and we talked
[24:22] so just a few months ago I was there and
[24:25] he asked me to come and so he texted me
[24:27] the address of the church I said what
[24:30] that's a real familiar Street I've been
[24:33] up and down that street thousands of
[24:35] times when I was a young boy because it
[24:36] was the Main Street near my house so
[24:39] anyways I'm going to the church and I
[24:41] went by my old house and I measured from
[24:43] my house to her the churches and it was
[24:46] three tenths of a mile and then I didn't
[24:49] even know it but I looked at the street
[24:51] that I used to live in and it was 26
[24:54] mystic Street so I lived in Providence
[24:57] Rhode Island I had no idea what
[25:00] Providence meant until I got saved in a
[25:02] Baptist Church and and then I had no
[25:05] idea what a mystic was until brother
[25:07] Branham spoke about the mystical body of
[25:09] the Lord Jesus Christ and you look up
[25:12] the word mystic and the definition of a
[25:14] mystic is one who seeks after and
[25:17] attains direct intercourse with God and
[25:21] and that's what the bride has Jesus
[25:24] Christ coming down making love to his
[25:27] bride whispering secrets in her ears and
[25:31] these secrets are only for his bride the
[25:35] rest of the world has no interest in
[25:37] hearing these things and so that's
[25:40] that's my little testimony and the
[25:43] church that started there there's a lot
[25:45] of African brothers that have moved to
[25:47] that part of the of the country and it's
[25:50] a very very thriving it's a it's a real
[25:52] a prosperous church and I was so
[25:55] thankful to see the message starting to
[25:57] take root right near my own house and
[25:59] now my family now when I tell them about
[26:02] the gospel of Jesus Christ I've got a
[26:04] place to be able to send them and one of
[26:07] them that really is going to need a
[26:08] miracle it's my mother's sister is my
[26:12] aunt Jean she's 89 years old a Catholic
[26:15] nun and unwind a Catholic mind when
[26:19] she's 89 years old that's that's a real
[26:22] challenge so if you pray for her and
[26:25] I've got I've got two sisters and
[26:27] brother and and cousins and nephews and
[26:29] nieces and a lot of them that are there
[26:31] and I am holding the token over them
[26:34] like like you're hold
[26:35] the token over your family and your
[26:37] loved ones and you know the token
[26:39] sometimes is not just like well you know
[26:42] it's a little my token and some people
[26:45] think it's like a little magic wand I
[26:47] got the token but sometimes that token
[26:50] is proactive things like sitting down
[26:53] and writing a letter a handwritten
[26:55] letter and then put a stamp on it and
[26:58] mail it snail mail and so they get that
[27:01] letter in their shock davina and then
[27:05] they open it up and it's a handwritten
[27:06] letter and they read it and then the
[27:09] psychologist they say when somebody gets
[27:11] a handwritten letter nowadays they will
[27:14] read that letter like three times what a
[27:16] letter and they they want to read what's
[27:18] the what are they up to what are they
[27:20] saying and they'll read it three times
[27:22] and then put it away and sometimes pick
[27:24] it up again and so sometimes as little
[27:27] things like that as opposed to just a
[27:29] text or an email which are nice and a
[27:32] phone calls nice but something that they
[27:34] know that you have taken some time and
[27:37] and for a husband or wife might be good
[27:39] for you
[27:40] so once in a while to send a love letter
[27:42] maybe like you used to do when your
[27:44] sweethearts when when you were young and
[27:47] husbands wives mothers fathers children
[27:51] you know it goes it goes always and
[27:54] brother branham said without perfect
[27:57] love you're not a candidate for the
[28:00] rapture and so every day when I wake up
[28:02] that is my goal in life it's perfect
[28:05] love now I've got people who are enemies
[28:07] to me because of what I believe in the
[28:11] word and they tell me I'm a nut and I
[28:13] said I might be a nut but I'm screwed to
[28:15] the right boat I am screwed to thus
[28:18] saith the Lord so I have people who are
[28:21] enemies to me but I am NOT an enemy to
[28:23] anybody in the world and I can say that
[28:26] before God but you know to enter into
[28:29] that channel of perfect love when I wake
[28:31] up in the morning I know there's got to
[28:33] be two deaths
[28:34] I gotta die and the devil's got to die
[28:37] first thing in the morning just bind the
[28:40] yapping dog tell him he has no authority
[28:42] over you and your life and
[28:46] live that victorious life now will there
[28:48] be challenges yeah
[28:50] will there be tests will it be
[28:52] disappointments yeah that's that's life
[28:54] but the Bride of Christ she overcomes
[28:57] all those things were made for that
[29:00] we're pressurized for that and the love
[29:04] that that you have in your church I was
[29:06] telling brother Sam
[29:07] this church has a level of agape love
[29:10] that is rare in the message churches
[29:13] around the world and sometimes you may
[29:15] take that for granted because you know
[29:18] it's just my pastor's brother Sam
[29:20] brother Wade and and you know the church
[29:22] but you never ever ever take the grace
[29:25] of God and the love of God and the
[29:28] leadership of God never take those
[29:31] things for granted
[29:32] because they are they are precious in
[29:34] the sight of God and so before I open
[29:37] the word I want to just give you a
[29:39] little exhortation we all know the story
[29:41] of the rich young ruler and so when you
[29:43] think about that title this man he was
[29:46] rich he was young he was a ruler
[29:49] probably had wonderful the the best
[29:51] clothes there was he had lived a
[29:54] lifestyle that most people could have
[29:56] only dreamed of but the greatest thing
[29:58] that the rich young ruler had was the
[30:00] opportunity to come face-to-face with
[30:03] the Lord Jesus Christ because very few
[30:05] people in his day had that opportunity
[30:08] and when he had the opportunity he had
[30:11] the right question he had the most
[30:13] important question any man or any woman
[30:15] could ever ask and that is what must I
[30:19] do to inherit eternal life and he asked
[30:24] only person in the world who could give
[30:26] him the exact answer that he needed and
[30:28] so Jesus loving him he looked into his
[30:32] future and he saw that money was going
[30:35] to become the god of the rich young
[30:37] ruler so he told them go and sell
[30:40] everything that you have give it to the
[30:42] poor and come and follow me now the rich
[30:47] young ruler he's looking at Jesus and
[30:49] he'd heard wonderful things about him
[30:51] and he wanted the audience with him
[30:53] which he got but when Jesus told him go
[30:56] sell everything that you
[30:58] leave your lifestyle of privilege and
[31:01] pleasure and give everything you have to
[31:05] the poor and come and follow me and the
[31:09] rich ruler is looking at him
[31:11] you mean follow a homeless man and this
[31:15] bunch of people has with them that don't
[31:17] know we don't have a home to live in
[31:20] don't know worth you know we're they
[31:21] gonna stay the night or were they gonna
[31:23] feed and so the rich young ruler he did
[31:27] a manifestation of every person one of
[31:30] three this message the gospel it will
[31:34] make you either mad or glad or sad and
[31:38] for the rich young ruler it made him
[31:41] very sad and he walked away but that was
[31:45] not the end of the rich young ruler
[31:46] because through the eye of a prophet we
[31:48] see him in torment but God allows him to
[31:51] see Abraham and Lazarus in his bosom and
[31:54] he cries out he said father Abraham let
[31:59] Lazarus come and drop a couple of drops
[32:01] of water in my tongue Abraham said no I
[32:05] can't do that he said there is a great
[32:07] gulf fixed he cannot come to where you
[32:11] are and you cannot come to her he is and
[32:14] so the rich young ruler he was not done
[32:17] yet because now he said well if he can't
[32:20] come to her I am and then I have another
[32:23] plan let Lazarus mount a great
[32:27] evangelistic crusade and send him to my
[32:31] family and warn them that they don't
[32:35] wind up in this wicked place where I am
[32:38] and Abraham said no I can't do that said
[32:42] they have Moses they have the law they
[32:46] have the prophets and if one rose from
[32:49] the dead still they would not believe so
[32:53] just in just at one moment before we get
[32:55] into the word we can look back as a
[32:58] Monday Morning Quarterback so to speak
[33:00] and we can say how how did that man turn
[33:04] down the greatest opportunity of his
[33:06] life to become a follower of the Lord
[33:09] Jesus Christ and have eternal life
[33:12] so we can look back at him but tonight
[33:15] we have a more up-to-date experience and
[33:19] an invitation to become a follower of
[33:22] Jesus Christ and we have vindication
[33:25] thousands of indications of who God was
[33:29] in this day and it's like a neon strobe
[33:32] light of Revelation and stimulation
[33:34] activation motivation and when you
[33:38] receive that there is an anointing that
[33:41] comes and you're energized and
[33:43] stimulated and quickened and and
[33:45] supercharged
[33:46] with the revelation that you are a child
[33:49] of God and you're down here and God has
[33:52] allowed you to live in the closing
[33:55] moments of time and God has trusted you
[33:58] to overcome the most wicked the most
[34:01] perverted the most despondent age of all
[34:04] time and God has trusted you and I to
[34:07] live in this day and overcome let's
[34:11] stand to our feet I'd like to bring you
[34:16] greetings from our assembly up in
[34:18] Cloverdale from brother Bisco and
[34:20] brother Tom and brother Tim and brother
[34:22] John brother Murphy and all the
[34:24] ministers up there and we still have
[34:27] very very fond memories one of the
[34:29] finest meetings that we've ever had was
[34:32] the meetings that brother Sam sponsored
[34:34] here in in Gainesville years ago and
[34:37] it's a real real it's a real wonderful
[34:40] memory for me you know in in my mind
[34:44] I've named my mind my mind is the
[34:48] village of anything is possible and in
[34:52] and in my memory it's a dream machine of
[34:55] excitement and enchantment and ecstasy
[34:58] and and it's it's it's it's aware of the
[35:02] day that we're living in and and what an
[35:04] excitement that that this message brings
[35:07] to me and I trust it will bring to you
[35:10] so we're going to invite you to open
[35:12] your Bibles to Leviticus in chapter 2
[35:18] and we're going to start reading in
[35:20] verse 1 but before we read let's pray
[35:29] father we've heard wonderful singing
[35:32] this afternoon we've heard a wonderful
[35:35] testimony of a young man that you have
[35:38] gripped his heart so thankful for that
[35:40] father blessed this blessed this brother
[35:43] and lead him and guide him into a deeper
[35:46] and a fuller relationship with you and
[35:49] now Lord what comes to the most
[35:51] important part of our service and that
[35:54] is your sacred word and first of all we
[35:57] want to say that we are aware that in
[36:00] this building even though we cannot see
[36:03] them with our natural eyes we know that
[36:06] there are supernatural beings in this
[36:09] room and I pray that that somebody maybe
[36:13] who is not aware of that at this moment
[36:16] before the end of the service that they
[36:18] would be aware that God is calling them
[36:21] to a supernatural life a supernatural
[36:25] experience that was so far exceed any
[36:28] dream or any plan or any expectation
[36:31] that they have ever had in their life
[36:33] and they would make you the number one
[36:36] priority father we pray that you would
[36:38] bless both speaker and hear and only you
[36:42] would be seen and glorified and we ask
[36:44] this in the wonderful name of our Lord
[36:47] Jesus Christ amen amen
[36:49] I'd like to speak about our supernatural
[36:54] opportunity and responsibility a
[36:58] supernatural opportunity and
[37:00] responsibility so in Leviticus chapter 2
[37:04] and verse 1
[37:11] and when any will offer a meat offering
[37:16] unto the Lord his offering shall be a
[37:18] fine flower and he shall pour oil upon
[37:22] it and put frankincense thereon and he
[37:25] shall bring it to Aaron's sons the
[37:27] priests and he shall take their out his
[37:30] handful of the flour thereof and of the
[37:33] oil thereof with all the frankincense
[37:36] thereof and the priests shall burn the
[37:38] memorial of it upon the altar to be an
[37:41] offering made by fire of a sweet savour
[37:44] unto the Lord you can have your seats
[37:47] now I would challenge you to think
[37:50] sometime later on mark down Leviticus 2
[37:53] and go into it in detail but I'm just
[37:55] going to skim through it but in the
[37:57] ingredients of this this meat offering
[38:00] we're told that there are several
[38:02] ingredients that need to be hidden and
[38:05] several ingredients that need not to be
[38:08] it number one there had to be the flour
[38:11] the fine flour and brother branham
[38:14] speaks about and 28 times he speaks
[38:17] about a little device they had called a
[38:20] bur and this this device would take
[38:23] every piece of that that meal and it
[38:26] would take it and it would grind it down
[38:27] and it would be exactly the same size
[38:30] and then to this fine flour that had to
[38:33] be oil and then there had to be
[38:34] frankincense added to that and later on
[38:37] in the chapter were told that this could
[38:40] be placed upon an altar or it could be
[38:43] in the oven or it could be in the pan or
[38:45] it could be in the frying pan and we're
[38:48] also told that you don't put any leaven
[38:51] in this meat offering and you don't put
[38:55] any honey in the offering and later on
[38:58] we're told near the end of the chapter
[39:00] with every one of these offerings make
[39:03] sure you put the salt in that offering
[39:06] and so in Leviticus it lays down the
[39:09] type now brother Branham said something
[39:12] he said I am a type ologist and any man
[39:15] who truly knows this Bible will be a
[39:19] typology now I had just graduated from
[39:23] Bible School
[39:24] nine months before the message came to
[39:27] me and I did not know what a type was
[39:29] and I didn't know what a shadow was I
[39:31] knew about homiletics I knew about
[39:33] hermeneutics I knew about how to
[39:35] structure a sermon how to get an
[39:37] introduction and get an illustration in
[39:39] point one point two point three and then
[39:42] have a conclusion and then hang the
[39:44] people's souls over the fire and call
[39:46] for an altar call so we were trained how
[39:49] to do that we we're well acquainted but
[39:51] when I heard about topologists I had no
[39:54] idea what brother Branham was speaking
[39:56] about and so I had to begin to search
[39:58] and back in those days that was in 1983
[40:01] we did not have a computer so you could
[40:04] not just put in you know like nowadays
[40:05] you can put a perfect type of or a type
[40:09] if you can do that and like in in
[40:12] seconds you can see all the things
[40:14] brother Branham had to say a perfect
[40:16] type of or a type of and so these are
[40:20] types that are laid out in Leviticus
[40:23] this is a a meal offering and so we'll
[40:26] come back this a little bit later but
[40:28] remember there's the flour and the oil
[40:31] and the frankincense no 11 no honey and
[40:34] salt and it's an altar or the oven or
[40:39] the pan or the frying pan now will turn
[40:42] over to second Kings chapter 16 in verse
[40:47] 23
[40:51] it's a scripture that most people who
[40:53] are acquainted with the message are very
[40:55] familiar with
[40:57] so all Marie slept with his father's and
[41:00] was buried in Samaria and a hab his son
[41:04] reigned in his stead and in the 38th
[41:07] year of the king of ask the king of
[41:10] Judah began a hab the son of Omri to
[41:12] reign over Israel and a hab the son of
[41:15] Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria
[41:17] twenty and two years so that was the
[41:20] length of his reign and a hab the son of
[41:23] Omri now listen to this very striking
[41:27] and a hab the son of Omri did evil in
[41:31] the sight of the Lord above all a ll
[41:37] above all
[41:38] that were before him and it came to pass
[41:41] as if it had been a light thing for him
[41:44] to walk in the sins of jeroboam the sons
[41:46] of nabad that he took to wife Jezebel
[41:49] the daughter of F Bell king of the
[41:51] zidonians and went and sir Bale and
[41:54] worshipped him and he reared up an altar
[41:57] for bail in the house a bail which he
[42:00] had built in Samaria and a have made a
[42:03] grove and Ahab did more to provoke the
[42:07] Lord God of Israel to anger than all the
[42:11] kings of Israel that were before so this
[42:14] was not an ordinary King this was a king
[42:17] of Israel and he went and he married
[42:20] Jezebel which was a heathen a raw pagan
[42:24] and she influenced him and this king of
[42:28] Israel now he disobeys the first
[42:30] commandment which I have no strange gods
[42:33] before you I'm the Lord your God and and
[42:36] so now this altar is is reared up and
[42:39] and it angers the Lord and out of
[42:42] nowhere we don't hear a lot about his
[42:45] history or his background but in in
[42:48] second Kings verse first came 17 and
[42:51] Elijah the Tishbite who was of the
[42:54] inhabitants of Gilead said unto a hab as
[42:57] the Lord God of Israel liveth before
[43:00] whom I stand there shall not be dood nor
[43:04] rain these years but according to my
[43:06] word
[43:07] now Elijah comes out of nowhere but
[43:10] here's a hab and Jezebel and there is
[43:13] sin in the camp and and in the country
[43:16] of Israel the children of God have been
[43:18] seduced and are now intoxicated by false
[43:22] gods and are under the influence of a
[43:24] king who's under the influence of his
[43:27] pagan wife and so God is not pleased
[43:30] with that
[43:31] and Elijah comes said no reigns going to
[43:34] fall until I fall for it now you here in
[43:37] Georgia are familiar with farming you
[43:39] know that where there's no rain that the
[43:42] crops fail and there's famine drought
[43:45] and when those things happen there's
[43:47] hunger and starvation that comes so
[43:51] after
[43:52] Alijah pronounces this this drought
[43:55] that's going to come no rain so he went
[43:58] and did according under the word of the
[43:59] Lord for he went and dwelt by the brook
[44:03] Cherith that is before Jordan brother
[44:06] Branham said this was the driest place
[44:09] in the land and the Ravens brought him
[44:13] bread and flesh in the morning and bread
[44:17] and flesh in the evening now you have
[44:19] got to have an element of the
[44:21] supernatural to believe that Ravens
[44:25] brought Elisha bread and flesh in the
[44:30] morning and bread and flesh in the
[44:33] evening
[44:34] now what bakery did the Ravens go to to
[44:37] get the bread from and where did they
[44:40] get the flesh from and this was the
[44:43] driest place in the land but yet there's
[44:46] a brook that's bubbling there and
[44:48] brother Branham said that God wanted
[44:51] three and a half years of intimate
[44:54] fellowship personal fellowship just him
[44:57] and his prophet now the rest of the
[45:00] world down below they are slowly going
[45:02] into a crazy mode because because now
[45:06] there's no food and there's no water now
[45:10] a hab he says all right we are issuing
[45:13] an APB all-points bulletin
[45:16] we need that man everything was going
[45:20] fine
[45:20] in the kingdom until that guy showed up
[45:23] we don't know where he's at but you find
[45:26] him police military everybody you go and
[45:30] search every inch of land until you find
[45:33] that guy and you bring him here
[45:35] meanwhile here's Elisha imagine with him
[45:39] and him in the Lord
[45:40] having this wonderful time of fellowship
[45:42] and no doubt God is equipping Elisha for
[45:46] the mission that lies ahead of him now I
[45:49] can just imagine and this is my mother I
[45:52] can imagine these soldiers and the
[45:54] military and and don't have a lot of
[45:56] water and don't have a lot of food
[45:58] brother Wade
[45:59] and no doubt their electrolytes are
[46:01] getting a little bit low
[46:02] they're probably walking a little bit
[46:03] slower and they're looking around
[46:05] they've got to find this guy looking
[46:07] everywhere and they probably came to
[46:09] that place where the mountain was were
[46:12] Elijah wa and they said there's nothing
[46:15] up there we know that's the driest place
[46:17] in the whole country we're not gonna
[46:19] waste any energy going up there because
[46:22] of nothing can be up there and so they
[46:24] went and they bypass it and so then the
[46:28] brook dries up and then God tells him
[46:31] the word of the Lord came and him saying
[46:33] arise and get these Zarafa
[46:35] now the word zero path means a place
[46:38] it's a refiner of metals a refiner and
[46:41] so he goes to zero path which belonging
[46:44] to Zion and dwell there behold I have
[46:48] commanded a widow woman to feed thee so
[46:52] this is God's plan God before the
[46:54] foundation of the world he knew and lied
[46:57] you is going to be there he knew he was
[46:59] gonna call for the famine he knew all
[47:01] the things that were going to take place
[47:03] and he knew that was going to be a widow
[47:05] woman that was going to sustain his
[47:08] prophet now I have looked at all the
[47:16] things brother Branham speaks so much
[47:17] about the widow woman and Elijah and all
[47:20] the things that take place and so he
[47:22] says I have commanded this widow woman
[47:25] to sustain thee so he arose and went to
[47:28] Zarephath and when he came to the gate
[47:30] of the city behold the widow woman was
[47:33] there gathering of sticks our brother
[47:36] bran said it was two sticks not three
[47:39] not four not five but two sticks like
[47:42] like a crow and she's gathering the
[47:45] sticks and he called to her and he said
[47:50] fetch me I pray thee a little water in a
[47:53] vessel that I might drink and as she was
[47:58] going to fetch it now think about water
[48:00] was the most precious commodity in the
[48:04] land water and food and here this
[48:07] perfect stranger shows up at the
[48:10] the widow woman's door and he asked her
[48:14] for a drink of water and he says as she
[48:16] was going to get him a drink then he
[48:19] adds to the message she was ready to
[48:21] obey the first part of the message and
[48:25] as she was going to fetch it he called
[48:27] to her and said bring me I pray thee a
[48:30] morsel of bread in thine hand and she
[48:35] said oh she that stopped her right there
[48:38] she said as the Lord liveth I have not a
[48:42] cake but a handful of meal in a barrel
[48:44] and a little oil and a cruse and behold
[48:47] I am gathering two sticks that I may go
[48:49] in and dress it for me and my son that
[48:52] we may eat it and die she knew she was
[48:58] down to the end a little meal and a
[49:01] little bit of oil now as you go through
[49:04] the message brother Branham talks about
[49:06] this this widow woman he says now think
[49:10] about now profit you've got to have an
[49:13] element of life I call it supernatural
[49:16] animation it's like Walt Disney he was
[49:19] able take all the pictures of the
[49:20] cartoons and speed him up and all of a
[49:23] sudden he had Mickey Mouse and Minnie
[49:25] Mouse and Daffy Duck at all all the
[49:27] Disney characters well in Supernatural
[49:30] animation God shows us through the eye
[49:33] of his prophets and God takes his profit
[49:36] like a submarine under the ocean and
[49:38] that submarines got a periscope and if
[49:41] the captain wants to find out what's
[49:43] going on above the ocean
[49:45] he says up scope and the scope goes up
[49:47] and that scope looks all around 360
[49:50] degrees and so the eye of a prophet is
[49:53] God's newsman and God can take that
[49:56] prophet and he can point him backwards
[49:58] he can point him forward he has taken
[50:01] him back before the foundation of the
[50:03] world and shown you what was taking
[50:05] place there he has shown you Lucifer and
[50:08] how he deceived the third of the angels
[50:10] he has shown us in detail what took
[50:13] place in the Garden of Eden he's
[50:15] described the serpent he's described Eve
[50:18] with a beautiful long blonde hair and a
[50:20] bright blue
[50:21] now think about this is a prophet he's
[50:23] no he's not just he's not just thinking
[50:26] about this he's not just you know giving
[50:28] you his idea of it
[50:30] his eyes are right back there and he
[50:33] says I'm just showing you what God
[50:35] showed me and so brother Graham says she
[50:38] was weary unable to sleep all night she
[50:41] was tossed about because of this great
[50:43] tragedy big tears dripping from her eyes
[50:46] for many weeks she had only one meal
[50:51] every three or four days for many weeks
[50:55] one meal every three or four days her
[50:59] husband had been lost in the battle for
[51:01] the Lord he trusted God and gave his
[51:03] life for the cause of Israel he was a
[51:05] Gentile he was a Gentile warrior and she
[51:08] was a Gentile widow her ragged nightgown
[51:12] was just about gone her sleeves were all
[51:14] ragged her arm sticking out of them
[51:16] she lived decent and honorable and met
[51:18] all of God's requirements but still the
[51:21] Lord remains silent he goes deep more
[51:24] detail her shoulders were stooped as she
[51:27] sat in a rocking chair shedding big
[51:29] tears and looking at her starving baby
[51:32] her cheekbones sticking out her arms
[51:36] frail as she sat ringing her bony hands
[51:39] her bones were dwindling away as the
[51:43] flesh goes from them what a vivid
[51:46] picture he said she knew that only a
[51:50] handful of meals stood between her and
[51:52] death she wasn't going to eat of the
[51:54] cake she was going to make it and she
[51:56] was going to feed her little boy and put
[51:59] him in her arms and die now I don't know
[52:03] if any of you have ever been at that
[52:06] point of total desperation this woman
[52:09] was in total desperation there was no
[52:13] hope on the horizon but she lived true
[52:16] and honorable to God and at the right
[52:19] time God had his man to come there
[52:22] brother Graham describes a little boy
[52:24] little boy was 3 or 4 years old he was
[52:26] unable to sleep over 20 minutes at a
[52:28] time because of his hunger he had on a
[52:30] ragged nightshirt he had sinking cheeks
[52:33] his eyes were
[52:34] turning yellow and he was holding his
[52:36] stomach as he asked his mother if she
[52:39] was ready to cook the little cake you
[52:42] mother's think about how you would have
[52:45] felt if your little boy or little girl 3
[52:48] or 4 years old and you knew that you
[52:51] would right down to the end and you were
[52:53] gonna have your last meal and take your
[52:56] little baby in your arms and die that
[52:59] kind of desperation we can only imagine
[53:02] and then he talks about the conditions
[53:06] in the land the whole nation was
[53:08] starving and in a terrible condition the
[53:10] people in the city of Zaire path were
[53:12] starving to death
[53:13] screaming for water it was a reflection
[53:16] of sin and immorality as the woman
[53:19] looked down the street she heard the
[53:20] people cursing and carrying on
[53:23] they were in a tribulation for that day
[53:26] and they were just going insane kind of
[53:30] like the world that we're living in now
[53:32] the world today around outside of this
[53:35] message friends it is insanity there's
[53:39] only one sane mind and that is the mind
[53:42] of Christ outside of that the world has
[53:45] become an insane asylum and the inmates
[53:49] are running the asylum or they're
[53:51] running to try to run the asylum and
[53:54] they are cuckoo they are nuts and so now
[53:59] we see that that God speaks to this
[54:03] little widow woman and he said as the
[54:05] Lord thy God liveth I have not a cake
[54:07] but a handful of meal in a barrel and a
[54:10] little oil and a cruse and behold am
[54:12] gathering two sticks that I may go in
[54:15] and dress it for me and my son that we
[54:17] may eat it and I and Elijah said unto
[54:19] here
[54:20] fear not have you heard in this day fear
[54:24] not
[54:25] have you heard a prophet of God say the
[54:27] message came to take the fear off of the
[54:30] people fear fear fe8 false evidence
[54:35] appearing real
[54:36] false education appearing real Oh what
[54:40] most people do forget everything and run
[54:43] or what the bride does face everything
[54:46] and run
[54:47] that's what we do so he said fear not
[54:51] but go and do as thou has said but make
[54:55] me there up a little cake first and
[54:57] bring it unto me and after make for thee
[55:00] and for thy son for thus saith the Lord
[55:04] you know the day that you really
[55:07] understand what thus saith the Lord
[55:11] means in this day the first day the
[55:16] first day I can say that I really felt
[55:18] like like like I was getting it that I
[55:20] had entered into a supernatural realm
[55:23] and adoption I had just been given the
[55:26] left-foot of fellowship out of an
[55:28] Assembly of God Church because I heard
[55:30] about the oneness of the Godhead and
[55:32] baptism in Jesus name and I was in the
[55:34] UPC church for a while and and so here I
[55:37] am and in my friend brother aren t he's
[55:40] sharing the message with me and I'm
[55:41] listening to a tape and it was I was
[55:44] sitting in a street in Rock Hill South
[55:45] Carolina and I'm listening to brother
[55:48] Branham he's in the discernment line and
[55:50] he said now sister he said I don't know
[55:52] you and you don't know me but there is
[55:55] one here that does know you and does
[55:58] know me now please try to try to catch
[56:01] what he's saying
[56:02] he said now when he and his Spirit comes
[56:07] in me and my spirit goes away and he
[56:13] gives me a temporarily resurrection by
[56:18] my spirit and he wants to use my body
[56:21] and I'm so happy to loan it to him
[56:25] anything he can get out of it and I had
[56:27] heard brother Branham saying a son of
[56:30] man revealing the son of man and I got
[56:33] it and I never got confused about
[56:35] prophet I never got my eyes upon a man
[56:38] it was Christ
[56:39] but I knew Christ was now using his
[56:42] prophet in this day to attract my
[56:45] attention and to equip me for eruption I
[56:49] have been on the religious
[56:50] merry-go-round but that day I can say
[56:53] like you said brother you know that you
[56:56] know that you know
[56:57] but you know that you know because God
[57:00] has sent you and absolute and that
[57:03] absolute is perfect everything God does
[57:07] is perfect
[57:08] the Bible is sixty-six books by 40
[57:12] different authors and everything comes
[57:15] together from perfection from the Jean
[57:17] chapter to Revelation but if a person
[57:21] misses what happened in Genesis 3 they
[57:24] take a detour in the Bible and they
[57:27] never recover from that detour and they
[57:30] will be found worshiping the Beast at
[57:32] the end in a tribulation period where it
[57:36] looks like the Beast is the only hope
[57:38] for the survival of the civilization of
[57:41] the world and without this message and
[57:45] without a token they'll be put into that
[57:47] tribulation and only the foolish virgins
[57:50] who will have to surrender become
[57:52] martyrs and give their life will make it
[57:56] and they will be great they don't have
[57:57] eternal life dwelling in them but they
[58:00] will be granted eternal life at that
[58:02] time so he tells her thus saith the Lord
[58:09] the barrel of meal shall not waste
[58:12] neither shall the cruse of oil fail
[58:13] until the day that the Lord sent his
[58:16] rain upon the earth and she went this is
[58:19] me and I went and did according to the
[58:24] saying of Elijah and she and he and her
[58:29] house did eat many days and the barrel
[58:31] of meal wasted not neither the cruse of
[58:34] oil fail according to the word of the
[58:36] Lord which he spoke by Elijah so now
[58:39] we've gone to Leviticus and now we see
[58:41] God's picking up his story in for in
[58:44] first Kings the meal the oil and the
[58:48] widow woman the sticks everything is is
[58:52] being put into play now we go into the
[58:55] New Testament and we see Jesus Jesus he
[58:58] was the bread of life that came down
[59:01] from heaven no he was the meal and when
[59:05] that fine meal when it was mingle with
[59:07] the spirit when the spirit
[59:10] and the oil were mingled and then there
[59:13] had to be frankincense added to that and
[59:16] what did Jesus say remember we talked
[59:19] about the leaven jesus said beware the
[59:22] leaven of the Pharisees Leviticus said
[59:25] don't put any leaven in there and I'll
[59:27] tell your friends I have seen so much
[59:30] eleven in my life
[59:31] I wish I hadn't seen a lot of the leaven
[59:34] that I've seen in my life
[59:36] I wish that I could unremember a lot of
[59:38] things about my past I wish there's a
[59:40] lot of things I could remember this
[59:42] remember about my religious experience
[59:45] before coming to the message but the
[59:47] leaven has got to be purged out and then
[59:51] no honey Jesus was not a honey Christian
[59:54] he was not one to walk drives whoo I
[59:56] praise the Lord glory to God hallelujah
[59:58] he was the he was a real man he was a
[1:00:02] real man of God a son of God and he was
[1:00:06] a real serious serious man and now we
[1:00:10] look at what they did to him they took
[1:00:13] him and we read in Matthew in 28 I'm
[1:00:18] just gonna speak a little bit fast now
[1:00:19] in Matthew 28
[1:00:38] verse 45 now from the sixth hour there
[1:00:41] was darkness over all the land unto the
[1:00:44] ninth hour and about the ninth hour
[1:00:46] Jesus cried with a loud voice saying Eli
[1:00:48] Eli did a lot of us a baktun I that is
[1:00:51] to say my God my God why has thou
[1:00:53] forsaken me and some of them that stood
[1:00:56] there when they heard the saying this
[1:00:58] man calleth for Elias and straight away
[1:01:01] one of them ran took the sponge and
[1:01:03] filled it with vinegar and put it on a
[1:01:05] reed and gave him the drink the rest
[1:01:07] said let be let us see whether Elias
[1:01:10] will come to save him now think about
[1:01:13] now that what they had done to Jesus
[1:01:15] they had tortured Jesus they had first
[1:01:18] of all they whipped him with 39 lashes
[1:01:21] and those Roman soldiers they were
[1:01:24] masters of torture they would take that
[1:01:26] whip and called it a liqueur and it had
[1:01:29] little LED balls with little sharp nails
[1:01:31] at the end of it and they would take
[1:01:32] that whip and they'd snap that wick back
[1:01:34] and it would hit the flesh and rip the
[1:01:37] flesh out 39 times he got them then they
[1:01:41] took him and they kicked them and they
[1:01:43] punched them put a rag around his head
[1:01:45] and walked her out in the sucker punch
[1:01:47] okay and here here could you imagine you
[1:01:50] got a rag around your head and you don't
[1:01:52] know where the next punch is coming from
[1:01:54] and they're kicking you and screaming
[1:01:56] and cursing at you spitting at you rip
[1:02:00] his beard out of his face and by the
[1:02:02] time they got him to the cross friends
[1:02:05] you could you could hardly recognize who
[1:02:07] he was and hardly recognize there was a
[1:02:10] human being by the time they got him to
[1:02:13] there and those Roman soldiers they had
[1:02:15] crucified many they were desensitized to
[1:02:19] crucifixion they'd had the thieves and
[1:02:21] the murderers and the robbers sometimes
[1:02:23] it took three or four sold you to hold
[1:02:25] that guy down so they could nail him and
[1:02:28] they could and these guys were screaming
[1:02:29] and cursing but they'd never seen one
[1:02:33] come he came and he laid down on the
[1:02:36] cross and he stretched out his hands and
[1:02:40] he waited for the nails that he was the
[1:02:43] Lamb that that opened not his mouth
[1:02:46] and now they lifted him up and two
[1:02:49] thieves crucified left and right and
[1:02:52] both of them they're cursing at him and
[1:02:55] screaming insults at him but something
[1:02:59] happened during that time did a thief on
[1:03:01] the right I believe this my own thought
[1:03:04] it was the first example of the third
[1:03:07] pull that ever took place because that
[1:03:09] man never saw sign never saw wonder but
[1:03:12] he said out of his insanity is screaming
[1:03:15] just a short time from death he
[1:03:18] recognizes who it is he said Lord
[1:03:20] remember me when you come into your
[1:03:22] kingdom and Jesus in his agony he says
[1:03:26] to him this day thou will be with me in
[1:03:30] paradise
[1:03:32] and so then he cried out Eli Eli lama
[1:03:35] sabachthani and behold this is verse 51
[1:03:39] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:03:41] rent and trained from the top to the
[1:03:43] bottom and the earth did quake and the
[1:03:45] rocks friend now here's the scripture
[1:03:47] you won't hear many times if ever in a
[1:03:50] denominational Church and the graves
[1:03:52] were opened and many bodies of the
[1:03:56] saints which slept arose and came out of
[1:04:01] the graves after his resurrection and
[1:04:03] went into the holy city and appeared
[1:04:05] unto many now we have a bird's-eye view
[1:04:09] of what took place brother Branham said
[1:04:12] they came up and Abraham and Sarah came
[1:04:14] over said Lord would it be okay if we
[1:04:17] kind of took a little Whistlestop tour
[1:04:19] around Jerusalem and see how things have
[1:04:22] changed since we been there and Lord
[1:04:24] yeah go ahead
[1:04:25] he knew he's gonna be there for 40 days
[1:04:27] go ahead and they're walkin around
[1:04:29] Jerusalem and then he's all somebody
[1:04:31] might recognize it and they disappeared
[1:04:34] like Jesus could appear and disappear
[1:04:37] Abraham and Sarah and the Saints that
[1:04:39] came out of of the grave now remember
[1:04:43] Jesus said no leaven no honey and he
[1:04:49] said there has to be salt and Jesus in
[1:04:52] the midst of his persecution
[1:04:55] now some people go through a persecution
[1:04:57] it might
[1:04:58] be a little persecution but Jesus went
[1:05:01] through a horrible persecution it was
[1:05:04] not on the altar it was not in the oven
[1:05:07] it was not in the pan
[1:05:08] it was a frying pan experience he was in
[1:05:11] utter humiliation stripped and beaten
[1:05:14] and tortured naked before the whole
[1:05:17] world why for me and for you for our
[1:05:20] sins for our healing so that we could
[1:05:23] receive this and reign throughout all
[1:05:26] eternity with him and so the Saints came
[1:05:30] out of the graves and appeared unto many
[1:05:34] what happened a resurrection and then
[1:05:36] shortly after that there was a rapture
[1:05:38] that took place now we can see this
[1:05:41] clearly from Leviticus the first King
[1:05:44] now Jesus life now we get down to the
[1:05:47] where the rubber meets the road your
[1:05:49] life my life you're a body this body it
[1:05:53] may be young it may be old it was a lot
[1:05:56] of there's a lot of people that are
[1:05:58] young and they're strong and handsome
[1:06:01] and beautiful but their souls are ugly
[1:06:05] before God the most beautiful Hollywood
[1:06:08] starlet the most the most gifted singers
[1:06:11] and in all the politicians in the
[1:06:14] businessman they might be they look like
[1:06:17] they got it all swagger
[1:06:19] look good smell good Walker talk good
[1:06:22] live large but their soul is ugly before
[1:06:27] God and then there are people just a few
[1:06:30] years short of the time they're going to
[1:06:33] leave the earth and maybe we don't walk
[1:06:35] as fast as we used to
[1:06:37] maybe the wrinkles are starting to come
[1:06:39] and the gray hairs are starting to come
[1:06:41] but if you're a son or daughter of God
[1:06:43] in his sight your soul is beautiful it's
[1:06:47] so beautiful in his sight it's an
[1:06:50] eternal soul going to rule with him in
[1:06:54] the splendor of youth and vitality but
[1:07:01] what do you have to do this this body
[1:07:04] this this flesh it has to be anointed
[1:07:07] your meal has to be anointed with the
[1:07:11] Holy Ghost
[1:07:12] there has to be the oil that has to come
[1:07:15] now that when the oil and the meal when
[1:07:19] it's mixed together real good and then
[1:07:22] again what in Leviticus say don't put
[1:07:27] any leaven in there and so we need to be
[1:07:30] strict of every bit of leaven
[1:07:33] denominational leaven the worldly leaven
[1:07:36] you know people say you know oh my son
[1:07:38] Johnny you know he comes to bed early
[1:07:41] he's in bed by 8 o'clock or 9 o'clock
[1:07:43] and he's safe in his bed oh really
[1:07:46] safe he's got the tree of the modern
[1:07:51] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:07:53] in his hands and he's travelling around
[1:07:57] the world traveling to Europe and
[1:07:59] Australia all his so-called friends
[1:08:01] sending pictures receiving pictures
[1:08:04] Satan has put in your hands my hands the
[1:08:08] tree of the knowledge of good and evil
[1:08:11] now we can look back and we can say how
[1:08:14] can Eve have ever done what she did how
[1:08:19] could she had been deceived by that
[1:08:21] slicker the serpent let me ask you are
[1:08:26] you being deceived
[1:08:28] it's Hollywood movies music television
[1:08:34] romance dramas and I can name 20 things
[1:08:39] and Satan has been deceiving man for
[1:08:43] 6,000 years that we have record of and
[1:08:46] he and his demons they are they are
[1:08:50] fine-tuned they know who you are they
[1:08:53] know your email address they know your
[1:08:56] Facebook page if you got snapchat or
[1:08:58] anything he knows who you are
[1:09:01] and the word dasya has been floated for
[1:09:04] the last couple years while satan has
[1:09:06] got a dossier he's got a document of
[1:09:09] your life he knows where you're weak he
[1:09:11] knows where he has deceived you in the
[1:09:13] past and sometimes he will come see me
[1:09:16] like a SWAT team will come and just come
[1:09:19] like a flood and just come and raise up
[1:09:22] some kind of a temptation around you or
[1:09:24] put some put you
[1:09:26] some kind of a circumstance were you
[1:09:28] you're just bound to have to do - just
[1:09:31] deceive yourself and to have to bow to
[1:09:34] the will of Satan you make compromises
[1:09:38] in your life and say that you know he
[1:09:40] doesn't care where he gets worship from
[1:09:42] if it's Hindu worship Buddhist worship
[1:09:46] Muslim worship if it's denominational
[1:09:49] worship if it's agnostic worship if it's
[1:09:52] atheist he does not care as long as you
[1:09:55] don't find this truth you know they
[1:09:58] tried to figure out how many people are
[1:10:00] following the message around the world
[1:10:01] and they come up with some astounding
[1:10:03] figures is it ninety-nine point nine
[1:10:06] nine nine percent of the people in the
[1:10:08] world do not know and follow this
[1:10:11] message and all of its truth think about
[1:10:14] that and you have been selected and
[1:10:18] collected and protected to be ejected
[1:10:21] out of this world one day either by
[1:10:24] rapture or you go the way of the grave
[1:10:26] and brother Branson a Christian can't
[1:10:28] die to be absent from the body is to be
[1:10:31] present with the Lord
[1:10:32] you take your last breath here and your
[1:10:35] neck on the other side you being glory
[1:10:37] and so that is our inheritance but
[1:10:41] there's a responsibility there is an
[1:10:43] opportunity to be a part of the kingdom
[1:10:47] of God to present as Romans 12:1 says
[1:10:50] present your body as a living sacrifice
[1:10:53] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:10:57] reasonable service
[1:11:00] that means this body has to be anointed
[1:11:02] with the true Holy Ghost and the only
[1:11:05] evidence that a person has received the
[1:11:07] true Holy Ghost is they can receive the
[1:11:10] revelation of the message for their day
[1:11:12] and manifest the life that's the only
[1:11:15] evidence that somebody has received the
[1:11:17] true Holy Ghost they might have it on
[1:11:21] their flesh they might have it on their
[1:11:23] spirit they might be a false anointed
[1:11:25] one as sister Peggy was talking about
[1:11:27] she says she had a hard time with that
[1:11:28] one that somebody could be anointed with
[1:11:30] the Holy Ghost and go to hell that's
[1:11:34] some deep swimming waters friends where
[1:11:37] would we be if brother Branham had not
[1:11:38] preached the anointed one
[1:11:40] at the end how many questions would we
[1:11:42] have unanswered so now this body has to
[1:11:45] be anointed with the holy gold
[1:11:47] leaven is purged out and you become a
[1:11:50] real son of God
[1:11:52] a real daughter of God not one of these
[1:11:55] honey Christian praise the Lord glory to
[1:11:57] God Jesus was not that kind of a man and
[1:12:00] I say praise the Lord Allah I say glory
[1:12:03] to God but I mean it when I say I say it
[1:12:06] with the depth of sincerity praise my
[1:12:08] God praise you think about a king or a
[1:12:11] queen of all the ages past and if one of
[1:12:14] their subjects was given an invitation
[1:12:16] to present themselves before the king of
[1:12:18] that day or the queen of that day how
[1:12:21] much time and preparation and planning
[1:12:23] I'm going to see the king I gotta make
[1:12:25] sure my curtsy is right I gotta make
[1:12:27] sure I present my and present myself
[1:12:30] right before the king now they did that
[1:12:33] in the natural realm how much more we in
[1:12:36] the spiritual realm in a supernatural
[1:12:38] realm first of all you have to have a
[1:12:40] revelation of who the king is and you
[1:12:43] have to have a revelation that you are
[1:12:45] kings and priests sons and daughters of
[1:12:48] God here on the earth a supernatural
[1:12:51] civilization on a mystical supernatural
[1:12:54] journey this message is spoken in a
[1:12:56] language it takes a token to understand
[1:12:59] this message without the token you'll
[1:13:01] sit there and I might as well be
[1:13:03] speaking Italian or Greek or French or
[1:13:05] German as one of our sisters here in the
[1:13:08] Church of speaking German now so without
[1:13:12] the Holy Ghost friends you are missing
[1:13:14] it and how do you get it the Bible said
[1:13:17] those who diligently search after me not
[1:13:20] that you could go searching after God
[1:13:22] but God found you first
[1:13:24] God finds you here in this church
[1:13:26] tonight and he calls you then when he
[1:13:29] calls you then he said now go in search
[1:13:32] after me search my word search my
[1:13:34] message search after me with prayer and
[1:13:37] fasting and praise and rejoicing
[1:13:40] recognize who you are and then there's
[1:13:44] got to be salt in there you've got to
[1:13:46] preserve we've seen over the last few
[1:13:49] years friends i've watched men that i've
[1:13:51] walked with for 30
[1:13:53] sometimes over 40 years and see them
[1:13:56] walk away from the message it's like a
[1:13:58] supernatural insanity has struck that
[1:14:01] person and it's like the revelation the
[1:14:04] so-called revelation they said they had
[1:14:06] it seemed like it came supernaturally
[1:14:08] and it seemed like it leaves
[1:14:10] supernaturally it seemed like you look
[1:14:13] I've looked at if I've look right in
[1:14:14] their eyes in a sight looking at a house
[1:14:16] brother dick and all the lights are on
[1:14:18] but nobody's home anymore the person I
[1:14:22] used to think I knew and the person that
[1:14:24] is there now there's no way you can
[1:14:26] reconcile them the Bible said he that
[1:14:29] endures until the end the same shall be
[1:14:33] saved
[1:14:35] salt preservative preservative keep away
[1:14:39] it preserves you it keeps away all the
[1:14:43] stagnation and then finally what do we
[1:14:48] have to do like Jesus Jesus presented
[1:14:53] himself and he took up his cross and he
[1:14:57] laid down and he waited for the nails to
[1:15:01] come now friends that there's nobody
[1:15:04] there's no Christian that I ever know of
[1:15:06] who has not had challenges in their life
[1:15:09] and maybe that challenge has been
[1:15:11] something known only between you and God
[1:15:14] so I call that something maybe it's kind
[1:15:16] of like an oven experience just you and
[1:15:18] God knows about it but then sometimes
[1:15:21] things happen and circumstances happen
[1:15:23] and sicknesses come and things come and
[1:15:26] then it's known by you to your pastor
[1:15:29] and the congregation and everybody knows
[1:15:31] what you're going through everybody know
[1:15:33] you've got this you've got this disease
[1:15:35] you guys need this operation and
[1:15:36] everybody knows this challenge that
[1:15:39] you're going through and that's like a
[1:15:41] that's like a pan experience but then
[1:15:44] there is what they call the frying pan
[1:15:46] experiences and I went through one of
[1:15:49] those a couple of years ago friends and
[1:15:50] it is no picnic and it is it is
[1:15:53] humiliating it is embarrassing
[1:15:56] and you just can't believe that this is
[1:15:58] happening to you and the whole church
[1:16:01] knows about this challenge you're going
[1:16:03] they know you can't go for the bed
[1:16:04] to the bathroom almost and you're not
[1:16:07] able to work and you're not able to
[1:16:09] function and you're reduced to a
[1:16:12] helpless dependence upon God and through
[1:16:15] that challenge brother Branham says
[1:16:16] present your body a living sacrifice
[1:16:18] holy acceptable unto God which is your
[1:16:22] reasonable service I did that over and
[1:16:25] over and over and I was telling brother
[1:16:27] Wade in June last night that God spoke
[1:16:30] to me in simplicity I read the scripture
[1:16:33] and the scripture says and it came to
[1:16:36] pass well it came to pass it didn't come
[1:16:42] to stay brother Sam it came to pass and
[1:16:45] I just thought it could better that yeah
[1:16:47] I'm in a challenge now but this
[1:16:48] challenge it didn't come to stay it came
[1:16:51] to pass and I began confessing that and
[1:16:53] confessing the confessing it and confess
[1:16:55] to you and my faith was increased and
[1:16:58] then out of nowhere brother Gary he sent
[1:17:01] me some cream for my feet and I got a
[1:17:03] little bit of relief and I could walk
[1:17:04] and I could move around a little bit and
[1:17:06] and my face seemed to grow and grow and
[1:17:09] grow and grow and finally just walk
[1:17:11] right out of it the doctor said it was
[1:17:13] impossible I'm sure they're people right
[1:17:15] here and have gone through situations in
[1:17:18] your life maybe you've been diagnosed
[1:17:20] with diseases and the doctor says there
[1:17:23] is no hope there is nothing we can do
[1:17:25] how many times that we heard brother
[1:17:28] Branham had people come before the
[1:17:29] doctors turned you over nothing he can
[1:17:32] do you believe do you believe you
[1:17:34] believe that's the key friends it's your
[1:17:37] faith now in this last day last thing is
[1:17:41] a hab in the land today oh yeah a hab is
[1:17:47] in the land is Jessie Bell in the land

[1:17:53] all around so Ahab and Jezebel and then
[1:17:59] what else happened
[1:18:01] they started worshiping something other
[1:18:04] than the one true Living God and what
[1:18:07] happened Elijah showed up and Elijah
[1:18:10] said there is going to be no rain
[1:18:13] there's going to be a famine

[1:18:18] land for the hearing of the true Word of
[1:18:22] God lots of natural food people are
[1:18:27] buying and selling and giving a marriage
[1:18:29] you know and it's before the end time
[1:18:31] friends when all the earthquakes and the
[1:18:33] volcanoes and the floods everything's
[1:18:36] happening but there's going to be
[1:18:37] prosperity buying and selling jesus said
[1:18:41] as it was in the days of sodom so shall
[1:18:45] it be in the days of the coming of the
[1:18:47] Son of man as it was in the days of Noah

[1:18:53] of man you look back friends not many
[1:18:56] were saved in Noah's day he preached for
[1:19:01] 120 years and only his family entered it
[1:19:05] in Sodom's day only lot and his two
[1:19:10] daughters came out your brother Branham
[1:19:12] talks about what when the angel came and
[1:19:15] the men the men was so perverted and
[1:19:18] they saw these two men walk in there and
[1:19:20] they began screaming give us those men

[1:20:37] on that cross and become a living
[1:20:41] not a dead sacrifice a living sacrifice
[1:20:45] a happy sacrifice you know the the
[1:20:49] balancing act of a Christian friends
[1:20:51] it's a real balancing act you got to be
[1:20:54] holy happy and humble a lot of people if
[1:20:58] you're too happy you're not humble
[1:20:59] enough if you're too humble you're not
[1:21:01] happy enough but we can be holy and
[1:21:03] happy and humble because we know that we
[1:21:06] are a child of God we know that by
[1:21:09] predestination we can look back we know
[1:21:12] we came from God and we're going back to
[1:21:15] God let's stand to our feet friends you
[1:21:20] know a while ago I was on a plane and I
[1:21:23] was flying and I remember how brother
[1:21:25] branham one time he had that little
[1:21:27] track pick up your pen and write so I
[1:21:29] started thinking you know all the things
[1:21:31] I've been through and it's amazing that
[1:21:34] the memory this little this little three
[1:21:37] and a half pound mass that we've got
[1:21:39] enough it can remember in vivid details
[1:21:41] things from our childhood and the good
[1:21:45] and the bad and the ugly all the things
[1:21:47] that have happened to us so I started
[1:21:49] thinking if it had not been for this
[1:21:52] message coming my way I want to speak
[1:21:54] real fast if it hadn't been for the
[1:21:56] message how would you know that Abraham
[1:21:58] and Sarah would change back to young
[1:22:00] again or Noah and the Ark had never
[1:22:04] rained one time before that time how
[1:22:06] would you know King Saul was saved how
[1:22:08] would you know he'll was not eternal the
[1:22:10] truth about baptism godhead Holy Ghost

[1:22:20] future home of the heavenly bride and
[1:22:22] bridegroom this is only for the bride

[1:22:45] statute of a perfect man marriage
