========================================

we won't cover it today but made you read it anyway didn't I yeah that's let's go back to Malachi 4 I used to have a u in college I had a u history professor at keemont he he said well we might have a pop quiz and we might not have a popiz big thing was he'd go over when the bell rang at 8:00 he'd go over and shut the door and he'd either say number one one and start with the quiz or he'd start in his dissertation about what we were talking about in history so that may be what I'm going to do tell you to read Revelation 5 and then not say anything for about 3 weeks and then say what's a first chap what the first verse say let's turn to Malachi 4 I really want to get this in our head because I do not think that most people realize how important it is that we see that the prophet came to do two things and he came to restore back the faith of the fathers and then bring his message now we'll bring some quotes maybe next Sunday but I wanted to get by with this go through this verse just one more time last Sunday all right Malachi 4 verse 5 behold I will send you Elijah the proph before the coming of the great and Dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children now that was who John the Baptist he took the old fathers of the Old Testament and brought them to the New Testament Pentecostal babies babes in Christ and you say well what about the 120 upper room they were still babes in Christ because they had never been born again before but when they were born again they came up to a level like we were talking about of maturity because the word himself had spoke to them and planted that word in their heart and the Bible said they took the word and held it so as they held it they got more than the 3,000 downstairs but John came to introduce the Messiah to bridge that gap between the Old Testament and the New Testament all right now and the Heart of the children to the fathers so we come up through John's time John Dies Jesus comes on the scene Jesus dies Jesus resurrects Jesus sends back his Spirit on the day of Pentecost baptized in 120 and then baptizing 3000 with the Holy Ghost and beginning as we were talking before in I'm going to slow down in Revelation 3 the beginning of the the creation of God all right now and I'm going to make a statement today that probably you'll never hear before but you're going to hear it today and I truly believe it man has never been turned back as far as they have in this end time that's right okay Paul Peter even though they walked down the street and people just looked at them and was in the shadow of the Believers and they were healed that was the power of that lion age l i o n not lion lion age Lion of the tribe of Judah was in forced he was in those people but there was a part of them there was a part of God that they didn't have even though they were we say fully matured people they still only got this Revelation okay that to soak in they only got the Revelation that God came to die it was the Holy Ghost that came on the day of Pentecost that baptized them and made their soul just as Eternal as God is but they continued to die everybody got that this continued through seven seven Church ages they understood who Jesus was but they didn't have the revelation of who they are that's what they understood to a degree that Jesus was God but now the son of man which sure they knew that that was God in human flesh that's what Peter said but inside their s they didn't have the word revealed to them what we're fixing to go into now had never been revealed to these people right because Jesus preached those six seals and even when he resurrected they said oh you're going to restore Jerusalem that's right you're going to rebuild the Temple you're going to do this they were talking still even natural things that's right all right so they got this Revelation that God came down in human flesh and died for their sins Paul says we don't see all things but we see Jesus sure he was the son of man but they didn't get the revelation of the son of man spirit and flesh there was a question in their mind and when there's a question that always causes death because that's the big question that's the last question of man how can we do away with death man has through 2,000 years tried through politics and through science to make us live better but they know we still dying remember brother brandham he said told the doctor he said doc he said when I was young I could eat and get stronger said but now I eat the same and better and I'm dying well that's the sin curse that's the curse that's put on every man but there's one man defeated death that was God in human flesh okay now up until 1963 this was not a revelation to anybody the way it's supposed to be you understand what I'm saying the way it's supposed to be yes all right this was revealed the Bible seven Church ages Revelations 1 through3 the spirit coming and doing the work like daddy's been talking about the the Angels The Messengers coming to deliver a message all right but now and that's what this is right here and the Heart of the children to the fathers brother Brown didn't restore everybody saying son of man son of man son of man son of man brother brandham only restored before 1963 this Revelation but in this revelation the flesh dies sin curs is still here but when this man Rose and this spirit and flesh said I said all power in heaven and earth been given unto me see let's be real let's just talk real I know it's on the internet and I don't care if anybody he Jesus was dying in human flesh right he did not have control over death in his human body that's right right everybody understand that because remember what they say you man not more 50 he was not but 30 right he never made it to 50 so his physical body the blood cells were dying the skin cells when he would wash he was human like me and you he cried he had to eat he of course honestly he did have control over this flesh more than most because he was God in human flesh not a sinless not a sinful body but when that body broke into this domain this first three dimensions he was under Satan's domain right remember we D read scripture about the on being you got to wait until you know he was made a little lower than the What Angels if he was made a little lower than the Angels then what he brought on death on his body so he could what take on death come back up and then he could say all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me he only had power over Heaven he did not have power over Earth you say he was God he limited himself he had to give us an example all right he did not have power over this right here or he would have not come off of that mountain and curse that fig tree because the he was hungry the prophet said and the Fig Tree had not brought forth it fruit yet so he cursed it why the prophet said he was hungry he slept through a storm so he did not have total control he could not say all power until what this man had resurrected and these two had become one where you could not separate them when he was on Earth Earth you could separate him the flesh man right brother B said he was human all right mortal now when you bring the two together what do the Bible say life and immortality has been brought to light through the gospel and only one man has reached it and that was Jesus the flesh was what was limited exactly what he had inside of him was not just like you and I right just like you and I that's we have the Holy Ghost by measure but that measure is the same elements that he had when he was walking on the shes of Galilee heal sick rais the dead that's what happened right here that Spirit could work out okay what I'm looking at today you take this thing right here this is a what microphone now you know it's a microphone I know it's a microphone and we know what it's used for but unless I say anything it's still a microphone that's right we can stand here for 100 years it's still a microphone that's right it's still on and connected that's right but unless someone says something through it it's just a piece of material that's right that's what God did he took a piece of material called flesh and made and spoke through it and that's what he did with this end time Prophet people just can't get it straight and keep the two separated because he was born in sin this man was not all right now so we we see that brother brandham when he started in his early Ministry he had a Healing Ministry just like we we talked here but as he progresses through his ministry he sees that he comes to a point he thinks he's preached at all 1961 spoken words of Original Seed brother Bram said the pure un adulterated words been sewn down in the earth Lord I've got a out on the limb I don't know what to do in other words what's he saying we're still dying we're still dying I'm still putting people in the ground why is my message not having the effect it should on the people if he was the seventh angel messenger which was supposed to do this God showed him he had at least come back to the faith of the fathers when he went across the curtain of time and said did Paul make it he said the angel said what yes Paul made it brother BR said well I will make it too because I preach what Paul preached now that identified where that man was he had preached the word to the faith of the fathers pure and unadulterated just like Paul because remember what did the people say we're resting on that right now this is where it's going to get a little ugly those people were dead humanly that's right that's right we're resting on that right they weren't resting on this that's right they were resting on this right resting on that brother brandham preached a message to them they got the Holy Ghost in their soul they died human death and went across a curtain of time just as Eternal as God is no shame for the people but they were resting on this ministry right here so brother Bram comes back okay say he went there and come back whatever you want to say but he comes back into this Dimension and then he goes 1961 he says he said Lord there's something there's a problem somewhere now what did the prophet what did the prophet say through the prophet as of yet Malachi 4 has not been made manifest so brother randam comes in the church ages and what does he say in the L the see and church age now this messenger of Malachi 4 see if it wasn't for Revelations 10:7 Mal four would just put you in this category here I don't like putting people in categories but we got to put them in categories to show where we're at now that's right okay everyone that is dead from this day back think of all brother Tatum F Tatum all the ones just died Sister Hazel they died under this ministry right here see the people in the message are holling son of man son of man son they don't even know what they're talking about if and I'm saying all of us cuz if all of us knew what we talking about right that's right that's what that brings that's right all power in Heaven and Earth that's what I was preaching the other night all power in that's a powerful statement that's all power in heaven and earth been given unto me personal and if we were in him at that time which we were right in eternal life in representation we were in that man standing there in Matthew whatever it is 20 something says all power in heaven and earth been given unto me problem was there wasn't enough belief or enough word down through the ages to get them from here to here so in this the Son of God Ministry is still going on today the Son of God ministry will not retire cuz they'll never go away it'll not it'll retire at the white Throne judgment cuz this son of God see they'll never get son of man Ministry at the white Throne judgment they'll be given eternal life what what Spirit God will put his Spirit into that person and that person will become Eternal all right this ministry right here is a person standing on Earth that says this but didn't go through death everybody's got brother rown come to bring the son of man Ministry sure he did absolutely but that was 196 through whenever that be understand he started preaching the son of man Ministry really when the seals broke 1963 right the son of man the Lord Jesus Christ he said I'm not a he he said I'm not the son of man a son of man revealing what the son of man cuz the son of man that's why brother bam had to go and time Malachi 4 in Revelation 107 in this quote in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he begins to sound the mystery there's one my there's only one mystery left change of the body how to get out of here without dying that's the only mystery left every other mystery's been made known seals have been broke right right right we in this room at least by head knowledge know more than anybody down through those ages including the Apostle Paul that's right cuz we have this ministry here available you hear what I'm saying I want you to listen to my words it's available that's right it may not be quickened in your life yet but it's available up until 1963 it was not available even up until now to some it's not available that's right cuz they're under this right here shouting about this right here which is okay but this person right here will take a change without death when they get the true revelation of the son of man because the son of man said all power in Heaven and Earth has been given unto me and he never died again his body became Eternal and that's what we're looking at on this side now so brother BR says now this messenger of Malachi 4 Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children to the fathers that's all your church ages like I said even up until now we're still under the Son of God Ministry when when someone goes to the Altar and gets born again they believe in the Son of God the spirit God that brought the word to their life indwelled their soul right right but this is not made known at that time right this is a development because in Revelation 10 1-7 it's a development right Christ has to come down and speak to you right did he came down in 63 and spoke to brother randam that's fine that's what we can take this as a foundation okay and that's what we're heading into we're heading into the foundation to get us to get the book open the book was closed did you read Revelations 5 yep the book was closed brother Brown said what man had known before had only been known of a closed book right sure sure sure the book is open phys open man has preached the word of God for 2,000 years but you can read this book and it be open and read it 100 times and it still be closed in your mind and your heart all right so now one more time to make us to be slow because this is the steps that we go through sister Johnny this is the steps that we go through the Journey okay because when you're born again justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost puts you in the body and he the Son of God carries you up through justification sanctification baptism Holy Ghost up that statue of a perfect man that's right okay but the son of man is a headstone CU remember it was rejected it wasn't here it wasn't it wasn't at the time to the believer we know Jesus was The Headstone right excuse me but to the believer we're still living under the and we are too you and I are still living right today under this ministry right here okay now this is being revealed yes this is being revealed to us that's right but that's got to be left up to you that's right individual Affair all the way through that's right from baby from baby baby born again to fully matured born again that's right individual Affair everybody has a different way of getting there amen there's one New York but there's several ways to get there there and I'm glad sister Johnny coming back this way and we didn't have to go up there and get her never been in New York that's the way I want to be when I get in the Millennium I want to say I've never been in New York maybe we travel like I thought maybe I'll just thought over the top of New York and going by at least I thought of New York anyway nothing against New York but I like it down here all right Revelation 10:7 is going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 turn the hearts of the children to the fathers one two he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thund in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in the Seven Seals it will be these divinely revealed mystery truth that literally remember we preached on this before literally means fig doesn't mean that it's a an allegory or a type literal means that I'm literally standing here right Josh could be standing here in my place as a type of me but literally means I'm literally standing right here he said literally turn the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so not the Pentecostal fathers back then we're talking about the real deal right so now does anybody have any questions there was two parts the message of Jesus Christ when he come a three and A2 year message he preached the message of the son of man nobody understood it he preached the pure word he was the pure word right Son of God Ministry was what when Jesus left what came back the spirit of God came back in the form of the Holy Ghost in the heart of Believers to help them understand this word amen all right pretty simple cuz that's what I hope that's what it's do to you now but this message right here was something that had never been taught by human being before right until that Mighty angel came down Christ cuz he's the one that delivered it the first time cuz remember we read in Matthew 17 about what Jesus said until us tell this Vision what did they see they saw Jesus on a mountain glorified right now we know he came out of that glorification and died at Calvary he had to because he was the what the lamb right but he was glorified the prophet said and we were there with him on that mountain Amen in spirit form not our spirit but in the holy spirit that was in that man we were on that mount Transfiguration that's right we got to believe that everything happened to him happened to us right right all right tell this Vision to no man until the son of man be risen again out of what brother Brown done out of dead Creeds and denomination Jesus is not going to have to come and die again that's right physically that's right he died physically that was the son of man one time dying right he said so the son of man be risen again that's right that's only promised in the end time right now now let me make it a little bit stronger brother brandham comes to the end of the seals and he says you're not getting it so it wasn't that group either and technically everybody that's died up until this day we're standing here didn't get it either that's right that's right no shame people no no on the internet no shame these people are born again Holy Ghost filled people right but they're missing the true message of the hour right this hour that's right the Son of God Ministry is a message of the hour all through the church ages that's right from Revelations 1 to3 all those Messengers brought this message right here to get the spirit of God Into the Heart of unbelievers and make them become Believers that's right but they still die cuz a sin curse has not been taken away right I want to nail these in your head and then as we go through here maybe something will come out we're going to go through it in a simple form just for the children it's not going to be something that's going to be way up in the clouds cuz I think brother Bram said even the most eliberate person could understand this gospel amen right so an illiterate person is somebody that cannot even read that's right amen so if you can hear you can understand right right and that's what I put my Hope on is to be able to understand so brother brandom up until 1962 or 63 he was setting a platform remember he kept saying he said I don't know if I'm the one he said but if I'm not I'm setting a what a stage or what is a stage it's a platform I'm setting a spot that if I'm not the one to step up on it I'm making the way for somebody to step up on okay and he did make a way he just didn't see the two Ministries until here I believe the the Prophet The Prophet Jesus Christ took him to Revelations 10 out there in Tucson and showed him or maybe even in the room cuz he said he didn't know what SEALs was till he till he got there the first day and showed him because he kept saying if you read the seal book he said I hope you're getting something you're supposed to be getting something this week there's something going on this week I hope you're catching it then he comes up to the questions and answers right before he preaches the sealed and he says it's not even for you you're not even supposed to get it who told him that God told him that that's right but the reason I say God told him that is he could see the people didn't wasn't understanding because of the questions they ask on questions and answers he had read those questions that was on the questions and answers right before he preached the questions and answers right before he started in the questions he said you're not getting it it's not for you and he started talking about a receiver like a um radio station he said there's a certain Crystal that'll pick up a certain station what was he telling them that Crystal hadn't got here yet right they were tuned to the wrong station but they were getting the basic of sure that that that um that the white horse rider is now not the Holy Ghost the white horse rider is what Antichrist sure they get all that that's okay that's still not that still didn't change them right right but I believe God's now turning that knob and he's finding a group of people cuz you and I a lot of us weren't even born well y'all weren't even born in 1963 so a lot of us were didn't know nothing so that's right he was saying there's a group to come and that group has got to be us amen cuz everybody else is dead that's right and surely all the ones in 1963 that was sitting in that Tabernacle most of them are dead already anyway I read the New Testament and you'd be surprised how many times it says in the last day or in the latter day or whatever this is coming in the last day after two days yeah what after 2,000 years um and actually in Matthew there and 17 but it was amazing how I think I underlined it how many times it said in the last day or the latter day or whatever this well remember Jesus spoke more of his second coming than he did of why he was there to start with right but now in in re in Matthew 17 the one we're talking about let's read that one time let's just finish it up right here and then next Sunday keep reading re Revelations 5 we'll get to it sooner or later probably more later than sooner but I want you to see everybody's like well what's the big deal about the seal what's this big deal about everybody said 47 to 63 brother R was wrong no from 47 to 63 brother randam was building a platform a firm foundation right zerubabel brother brandham was zerubabel he was the one to do we we'll read that next Sunday in Zachariah if you want to read the book of Zachariah it's only about three chapters but Zachariah said zerubabel will come and clean that Foundation off and begin to build a building right in chapter 17 says after six days after 6,000 years or after six Church ages in the seventh age we're still living in the seventh age we we haven't we're not saying we're in in a different age we're we're still in the seventh Church age brother Brown said lay out a seal it go all the way to the end time all right but he's calling out a group of people after six days so after the six Church ages we know six Church agents is not going to get this right but after 6 days Jesus Took Peter James and John and he was transfigured before them his face did shine as the sun and his rment was white as snow and I didn't write where brother R said it but I wrote here he said we were represented there and behold there appeared to them Moses and El lias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here Jesus didn't want him to be here that's Earthly he wanted him to be in Heavenly places he wanted to be caught up where he was at of course Peter's Revelation was it's good to be here right said unto Jesus lord it's good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make here three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses one for Elijah brother BR said he wasn't building an Earthly temple building a Heavenly Temple while he yet spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were s afraid Jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid Pray when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save Jesus only and as they came down from the mountain Jesus charged them saying tell the vision to no man until the son of man be risen again from the dead that's got to be in the end time he didn't raise twice 2,000 years ago he raised one time right now we didn't physically kill this son of man but what did we do we did away with a revelation the Revelation was hid it was still there even though I'm erasing this I can still see it written in there all right so this is what they got that's all they got cu the son of man hadn't been risen again that Vision could not be fulfilled Transfiguration glorification could not be fulfilled until the son of man be risen again so now that the prophet preached that message and now he's risen again at least he was the brother rown okay and there's some parts there that I could say that that he's dead too so he waiting on a group of people not just one man right but this revelation will get you in the body of Christ but you're still going to die at your appointed time that's right it's appointed under death man wants to die in the Judgment right brother bandam from 47 to 63 he preached this back because what happened after the first church age what happened you remember your church ages you had a lot of light this was gospel a a lot of Darkness a lot of Darkness what happened in that fourth age just a teeny bit of light the son of man was killed any Revelation any way for it to come back was hidden by the Catholic church or Catholicism or let's just say denominationalism all right then what happened you had a Reformation back right right but then at the end time time brother R said he put just a little bit of sorry it went back Dark Again the son of man's got raised in the end time the second time before this Vision can be fulfilled what a glorified body standing on the earth saying all power in heaven Earth been given unto me there's no other power anywhere else and then in Revelations 10 that's what we're reading next Sunday Revelations 10 7 says that that Mighty angel had to come down and then we'll finish that and then we'll get started in the breach actually read the breach that brother jul fory always says the breach produce the bleach the bleach produc
