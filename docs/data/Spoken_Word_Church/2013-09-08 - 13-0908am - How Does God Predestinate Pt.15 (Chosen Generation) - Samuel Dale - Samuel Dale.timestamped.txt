[5:17] us covered by the blood guide us in
[5:19] Jesus name amen
[5:23] Romans
[5:28] 8 and we know that all things work
[5:31] together for good to them that love God
[5:33] to them who are the called according to
[5:35] his purpose for whom he did for know he
[5:39] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[5:42] the image of his son that he might be
[5:44] the firstborn among many Brethren
[5:47] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[5:49] he also called and whom he called them
[5:51] he also Justified and whom he justified
[5:54] them he also glorified I love this part
[5:58] what shall we then say say to these
[6:00] things if all of this up here is true
[6:02] what can we say if God be for us who can
[6:05] be against us all right let's go on over
[6:07] to
[6:08] Ephesians 1 and we'll read
[6:12] 3-14 blessed be the God and father of
[6:15] our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[6:17] with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly
[6:19] places in Christ according as he had
[6:22] chosen Us in him before the foundation
[6:25] of the world that we should be holy and
[6:27] Without Blame before him in love
[6:31] having predestinated us unto the
[6:33] adoption of children by Jesus Christ to
[6:35] himself according to the good pleasure
[6:37] of his will to the praise of the glory
[6:40] of his grace wherein Heath made us
[6:43] accepted in the Beloved let's stop there
[6:45] because we won't get down that far
[6:47] anyway so you may be seated we'll just
[6:49] stop there on that
[6:51] verse main part we were getting is the
[6:54] chosen in him as we'll get to it all
[6:57] right we've been talking about
[7:01] predestination and talking about how
[7:04] does God
[7:06] predestinate and we found that he
[7:08] predestines by for
[7:10] knowledge and being an infinite God he
[7:13] knows all things before they'll take
[7:15] place so he can go ahead and say Jacob
[7:18] have I loved and Esau have I hated as
[7:21] the Bible says even before they were
[7:22] born all right because he knows all
[7:26] things now if that's not the kind of a
[7:29] God your serving I'd sure try to find
[7:31] one that did uh I don't want a God Like
[7:34] a peanut brain like myself that keep
[7:36] keeps changing his mind I I want
[7:39] something I can depend on and you know
[7:42] and believe and then 40 years from now I
[7:45] can still be believing it you know and
[7:48] and not worry about it cuz I want to I I
[7:50] want to keep it that way but
[7:53] now we've been I said talking about it
[7:57] and seeing and and and knowing that by
[8:00] for knowledge he could then actually
[8:04] write the Bible before the world there
[8:07] shouldn't be any problem with that if
[8:08] he's God now if he's not god let's just
[8:11] eat drink and be merry cuz tomorrow we
[8:13] die so what you know we fall off with
[8:15] some glorified monkey tree is that the
[8:18] way we think no we know for assurity
[8:21] that there is a God because by looking
[8:23] around and seeing even the things we see
[8:26] testifies of it and shows you know uh
[8:29] you know you explain to me the human
[8:31] body and how it works how all of those
[8:34] little old Parts in there keeps
[8:35] everything to going now you explain that
[8:38] and I won't have to worry about trying
[8:40] to explain God to you because somebody
[8:43] had to create that he said well it was
[8:45] just a polywog and it rolled up well who
[8:47] got who created the
[8:49] poliwog see you know so we just end the
[8:52] whole thing you know but now thinking
[8:54] about
[8:55] it and we've got up to the point to
[8:57] where that we are talking
[9:00] about God and His
[9:03] thinking and how that we read there in
[9:05] the scriptures you know that those who
[9:08] he justified he's already even glorified
[9:10] but that's in his mind now that's not in
[9:13] reality in you and
[9:15] I
[9:17] right the we're still human beings we're
[9:19] still subject to the world we're still
[9:22] you know uh having to eat drink and
[9:25] everything you know and and doings and
[9:27] and but when when God looks down and
[9:30] sees anything
[9:32] finished then it it is a finished
[9:35] product and we don't have to worry about
[9:36] it so then he sees everything from what
[9:39] he was before the world and as we read
[9:42] there in Romans those who he forn know
[9:45] he could predestinate all right now
[9:48] that's not the old doctrines of
[9:50] predestination that come down to
[9:53] organized religion like your your uh
[9:55] Armenian style of doing is more or less
[9:59] uh uh we got to make sure we work right
[10:00] and do right and this right and that
[10:02] right because we could be predestinated
[10:04] that way and and then the other side is
[10:06] the Calvinism that looks at it as well
[10:09] you know I was always safe so it don't
[10:11] make no difference uh one of these days
[10:13] God will contact me and I get to go to
[10:15] heaven well you know sometimes I wish
[10:17] some of those things were right but it's
[10:20] not so then we just don't worry about it
[10:23] but to see that God fornew what you
[10:26] would
[10:27] do and then he could predestinate which
[10:31] is means Destiny determined
[10:34] beforehand he could look down through
[10:36] time and see that you would want to be
[10:40] saved
[10:41] all so then he could make a plans for
[10:44] that he could come you know and release
[10:46] his life to where it would be ready to
[10:49] come into you and I when we would come
[10:51] into the world all right you know and
[10:53] receive it as not a person back there
[10:56] but come into the world of the basis of
[10:58] growing up and coming to the age of
[11:01] accountability and make a decision and
[11:03] receive the new birth see then we know
[11:06] that God has given us eternal life now
[11:09] uh in no way do I believe in any form of
[11:12] Eternal sunship we've been through that
[11:16] uh a son has a
[11:18] beginning and if a son has a beginning
[11:20] can not be Eternal so we don't believe
[11:22] in that we we'll get to it in a minute
[11:24] we believe in Eternal godship because
[11:27] God is eternal that's right but you and
[11:29] I had a time that we
[11:31] began and we have a time that we will
[11:34] end if we're not born again we will be
[11:37] annihilated somewhere you know in the
[11:39] Lake of Fire and all of that because
[11:41] we're we had a beginning right but if we
[11:44] can receive eternal life into our soul
[11:47] then that eternal life had no beginning
[11:50] that's the main thing I'm trying to get
[11:52] us to see
[11:53] now is to look at it in the bases
[11:57] that if we have eternal
[12:02] life then that eternal
[12:05] life is God's own life there's not two
[12:08] or three Eternal lives right there's
[12:11] only one eternal life and that's God all
[12:14] right God's Own Life coming and living
[12:16] in you and I to make us Eternal giving
[12:19] us what we call the New Birth you know
[12:22] the the the salvation and that's where
[12:24] the Nicodemus he couldn't understand and
[12:27] you know he said you know what do you
[12:29] mean I must be born again well he was
[12:32] simply telling him he needed to die up
[12:33] to his and receive the life that he was
[12:36] going to give but he couldn't understand
[12:39] that do we understand
[12:41] it do understand that what we are as
[12:44] mortal beings you know time doomed
[12:48] people age Factor getting older older
[12:52] and you know wrinkled and gray-headed
[12:55] and Noire and everything else and you
[12:58] know because we're on our way
[13:00] down we're just mortal but God came to
[13:04] make a way and he did through Jesus
[13:07] Christ upon the Earth because we know
[13:09] that Jesus Christ was not a second
[13:11] person or a third person or something
[13:13] like that he was God made manifest in
[13:16] human flesh all right then in being that
[13:19] then we we try to find out by the new
[13:21] birth like the prophet said one day he
[13:24] said God didn't send a son said would
[13:26] you send your child to die or would you
[13:29] go
[13:30] yourself well of course the way it is
[13:32] nowadays most people would send the kid
[13:35] first you know but that's not the way
[13:37] God does things you know all right but
[13:41] getting to the point then and we read
[13:43] there in
[13:45] Ephesians that we were chosen in him
[13:49] amen all before the foundation of the
[13:52] world all right now we're trying to show
[13:56] uh for knowledge and understanding and
[13:58] getting back into the mind of God
[14:00] without having to be that like God will
[14:03] that all be saved he wanted he died for
[14:07] everybody he gave his life to everybody
[14:09] in the world all of the billions of
[14:11] trillions of people that's been in the
[14:12] world that he died to to give his life
[14:15] for everybody but everybody's not going
[14:17] to accept accept it all right so then he
[14:21] gives us a free moral agency to accept
[14:24] or reject or a right to the fact of
[14:26] where we choose if we want to be saved
[14:28] or not not he's not going to make us
[14:30] saved he will not override that and save
[14:33] you when you don't want to be saved but
[14:36] neither will he kick you away if you
[14:38] want to be amen because he lives that up
[14:41] to us as a choice we can receive our
[14:44] reject all right now in doing that then
[14:47] would there be any problem that God
[14:49] could set before the world and look down
[14:51] through time and see who would want to
[14:53] be saved and who wouldn't that shouldn't
[14:56] be any trouble that that should be
[14:57] sensible
[14:59] all right but yet we try to make our
[15:01] things in a great understanding you know
[15:03] but we read it says were chosen in him
[15:07] right now I've emphasized lately a lot
[15:10] on this point and I want to keep doing
[15:13] it if we think we were chosen of
[15:17] him and we're reading the scripture that
[15:19] we were chosen in him but our human mind
[15:22] is Translating that as to be of instead
[15:25] of
[15:27] in because see we think we were chosen
[15:30] of
[15:31] him but there's no scripture say we were
[15:33] chosen of him it said we were chosen in
[15:36] him
[15:38] right in other words when he was chosen
[15:40] I was chosen when he was accepted I was
[15:43] accepted I wasn't back there to receive
[15:46] it but I receive it now because I
[15:48] believe that he died in my place all
[15:51] right so there's a vast difference
[15:52] between chosen in
[15:54] him and chosen of him if you you put it
[15:59] as I said the other day and talking
[16:00] about it a little last night if you put
[16:02] it that we were chosen of him then that
[16:05] means god Stamped Out who he
[16:10] wanted and he's a respector of
[16:13] person he's not
[16:15] just he would be condemning others for
[16:17] dying and going to hell when he'd have
[16:20] no way he can condemn them but if he
[16:23] gives everybody a
[16:25] choice let you decide your own choice
[16:28] then you can't go to judgment and say
[16:31] but I didn't have a chance you say yes
[16:32] you
[16:33] did yes you did you remember when you
[16:36] were that you remember you see then it
[16:38] won't be he won't have to have no great
[16:40] big screen to pull up cuz he can just
[16:43] pull it up in your mind and just you
[16:45] know like that and you'll say okay yeah
[16:47] I know I done it all right like we've
[16:50] always said it won't be the real bad
[16:53] sinner at judgment that will argue with
[16:56] God because they'll know who they were
[16:58] were right right but you take a
[17:02] religious fanatical religious person see
[17:06] the Bible says that they said there you
[17:08] know
[17:09] uh Jesus said depart from me I never
[17:12] knew you right well that didn't mean he
[17:15] didn't know about them right you but he
[17:18] never knew him he never had any
[17:19] relationship into the point with them to
[17:22] where they could become children but he
[17:24] knew all about them because being
[17:26] infinite all right so then when the
[17:29] religious person walks up and they'll
[17:30] say have not I cast out Devils that's
[17:33] what scripture says they'll do and he'll
[17:35] say depart from me he doesn't argue with
[17:38] them when casting out Devils he know
[17:40] they've done it
[17:42] right but yet they never come to an
[17:44] experience of
[17:46] Salvation to a position to where that
[17:49] they could be have something inside of
[17:51] them right instead of just having some
[17:54] knowledge some idea some thought all
[17:57] right so we're going to talk about now a
[17:59] chosen
[18:03] generation and in doing that I didn't
[18:06] give these scriptures to the brothers so
[18:08] I'll just go ahead and read a little bit
[18:10] but in 2
[18:12] Thessalonians 2 and13 it
[18:16] says but we are bound to give thanks
[18:18] always to God for you Brethren beloved
[18:21] of the Lord because God had from the
[18:23] beginning chosen you to Salvation
[18:27] through sanctification of the spirit and
[18:29] belief of the truth now he's chosen
[18:33] you all
[18:35] right see now that goes to the same of
[18:38] choosing chosen in
[18:41] him it's not chosen you like stamping
[18:44] out I'm going to save this one but I'm
[18:47] going to leave that one no he doesn't do
[18:49] his work like that he wouldn't be a just
[18:52] God so you could argue with him at
[18:54] judgment but there'll be no argument
[18:56] with God go is all finished all right so
[19:00] then we're what we're we were
[19:03] chosen what now youed to
[19:08] Salvation through sanctification of the
[19:12] spirit he he made it then that we would
[19:14] come to a basis of Salvation right amen
[19:17] and I believe in
[19:19] that I don't believe and we'll get to it
[19:22] later in the message as a lot of people
[19:24] believe we come into the world with
[19:25] eternal life I don't believe that you
[19:27] said well Prophet said so and so well
[19:29] let's wait and see what he did say
[19:32] amen I
[19:34] Believe by representation of
[19:36] predestination yeah sure we'll get to
[19:39] those things but I believe that you and
[19:42] I have to accept our
[19:45] salvation and I believe Jesus Christ had
[19:47] to die to release that life that was in
[19:49] him where he come back in me and you he
[19:51] didn't have to come to just give us a
[19:53] head knowledge that's right you know an
[19:56] intellectual conception right he come to
[19:58] give us a new birth that's why he said
[20:00] to Nicodemus you must be born again look
[20:02] at a man that spent his whole life
[20:04] serving
[20:05] God living in the temple all he' done
[20:08] all of his life was went to church and
[20:11] serve God prayed so many times a day
[20:14] fasted so much done
[20:17] everything but when he was facing Jesus
[20:19] he said you must be born
[20:22] again well Nicodemus couldn't understand
[20:25] that all right because he thought he had
[20:29] everything but in the face of God he
[20:31] didn't have it all right but now watch
[20:33] see from the beginning he's chosen you
[20:36] let's go over to 1 Peter 2
[20:42] and9 it says but you are a chosen
[20:47] generation what now a royal
[20:52] priesthood and holy
[20:55] nation A peculiar people
[20:59] now that's a whole lot isn't
[21:00] it I mean you think about what it is but
[21:04] you are a chosen
[21:05] generation your royal
[21:08] priesthood you remember the high priest
[21:10] had to make the offerings you know he he
[21:13] made the offering for everybody but see
[21:15] in the New Testament form you are the
[21:18] high priest you're the head of your
[21:19] household you're the the the husband
[21:22] then would be the the the head of the
[21:24] house all and the father you know head
[21:27] of the family and in doing those things
[21:30] see we don't have to go down and offer a
[21:33] sacrifice you know a goat or a lamb or
[21:36] something no but our sacrifice is Jesus
[21:40] Christ but he made us over in the Book
[21:42] of Revelation called us priests and
[21:45] Kings every Born Again
[21:47] believer has a right now to go in the
[21:50] holy of holies where in the Old
[21:52] Testament only the high priest could
[21:55] go and he just went once a year
[21:59] but now you have a right to go straight
[22:01] before God and talk to God about what
[22:03] you have need
[22:05] of because you're a priesthood all right
[22:09] but now you're a holy
[22:13] nation that's not a natural
[22:15] Nation it is the the body of Jesus
[22:18] Christ all
[22:19] right A peculiar people I like that
[22:24] God's people are always peculiar they're
[22:26] odd you know we don't have to do
[22:28] anything to be
[22:29] odd you're just odd
[22:33] you why is it that you walk in a store
[22:36] and you sisters go in with your dresses
[22:38] on and your hair and things and and the
[22:40] world looks at you and they'll walk up
[22:41] to you've never cut your
[22:43] hair see you're just a witness against
[22:46] people
[22:48] right just being a people you're
[22:51] peculiar am you're odd you
[22:54] know and you stand out and the women
[22:57] stand out more than men do us men wein
[22:59] nothing but ugly bunch of mud you know
[23:01] it don't matter because we not need
[23:04] bleed bunch of nothings but the the
[23:07] sisters stand out because of what they
[23:09] represent the church all right the bride
[23:12] of Christ But A peculiar people now
[23:15] watch in a minute as we get to a couple
[23:17] of scriptures but if you ever notice
[23:19] that what it says there it says we're a
[23:21] chosen
[23:24] generation now that word generation from
[23:30] uh bringing it down from the strong
[23:33] concordance is
[23:35] 1085 which means a kind a chosen
[23:40] generation they probably got it they
[23:42] they get faster than I am most of the
[23:43] time oh look what it says about it's
[23:47] roll it back down you too high there you
[23:49] go it means a
[23:51] kind and this word of generation you
[23:55] know a chosen
[23:56] generation it means a kind it means a
[23:59] kindred it means an
[24:01] offspring it means a nation it means a
[24:04] stock it means a born or diversities and
[24:07] and you know miscellaneous thing it's
[24:09] like a race or a a stock or a race or a
[24:12] nation in other words nationality or
[24:15] descent from a
[24:17] particular people
[24:20] see meaning that we're different right
[24:24] we're a chosen Generation generation
[24:27] amen
[24:29] right generation regen right amen but we
[24:32] were gened wrong right amen right Mom
[24:35] and Daddy done the best they could do
[24:36] we're not blaming them don't blame Adam
[24:39] and Eve in the
[24:40] garden but we were were gened that way
[24:43] made that way come down through
[24:45] genealogy as we call it and come out to
[24:48] who we are but see the new birth then
[24:50] makes you a different
[24:54] people a royal
[24:56] priesthood
[24:58] not a nation anality of Nations but the
[25:01] word Gentile we're in the Gentile
[25:03] dispensation as we call it Gentile means
[25:06] Nations see that way anybody can be born
[25:08] again in this day you know you don't
[25:10] have to be a certain Israeli lineage or
[25:13] something because it's it's a genealogy
[25:17] it it's doing it all right now
[25:20] watch then if we look at it and keep it
[25:23] correct in our
[25:25] thinking that we were chosen in
[25:29] him then that's how we can be a
[25:31] different kind of people that's how we
[25:34] can be a different Kindred from what
[25:36] mankind is that's how we can be his
[25:38] offspring as we'll get to it in a minute
[25:40] Paul said to the to them on Mars
[25:42] Hill The Offspring of God the children
[25:45] of God all see because that's what we
[25:48] are right all right we're born we're a
[25:52] family we're
[25:55] race you and I are or a race of people
[25:58] that has never you know the the the
[26:00] world thinks about all these super races
[26:03] that they got you know they they got all
[26:05] this fighting people and doing things
[26:07] you know and they claim it that's what
[26:09] Adolf Hitler was trying to do was was
[26:11] make a super blonde Race To Rule The
[26:14] World all he already his W was telling
[26:17] us he already had a place bought out
[26:19] here in California or somewhere back
[26:22] before he was so he was so dead set on
[26:24] Conquering the world he already had them
[26:26] building place here in America yeah but
[26:28] he wanted to have a super race of people
[26:31] well I I believe in a super race of
[26:33] people am but I believe in a born again
[26:36] believer being part of a super
[26:38] rush that's what he's that's what God
[26:40] has done for you and I by giving us
[26:43] eternal life he has made us to a place
[26:45] that we're different amen as I said we
[26:48] don't have to be
[26:50] right if you have to be different you're
[26:52] not a Christian you're an
[26:55] actor right that's right the word f
[26:59] the word Pharisee look it up it means
[27:01] actor and they were acting
[27:04] religious that's why when Jesus talked
[27:06] to him see and said you're your father
[27:09] the devil well they was decided right
[27:11] then they better get rid of the old boy
[27:13] because he wasn't according to their
[27:14] knowledge all right but now think about
[27:18] it if we were chosen in him now to get
[27:21] to the
[27:22] thought a chosen
[27:25] generation then we must be part of
[27:31] God and being that way we must be as
[27:34] Jesus was almighty God made manifest in
[27:40] flesh amen called a son that was all
[27:43] right because that human flesh did have
[27:47] a
[27:48] beginning it came from a mother it had a
[27:51] time you know of course he never did
[27:53] call her mother showing that it was a
[27:55] virgin birth but looking at Jesus to see
[27:59] how he was not just a part of
[28:03] God he was God made
[28:05] manifest all right now you and I then we
[28:09] will never be all of God by ourself
[28:13] because that's he's got
[28:15] children all right I mean we are his
[28:18] children right and if we are his
[28:20] children then one child is never no
[28:23] different Wade was the first one but DNA
[28:26] wise that made him no difference in
[28:29] Terren and see in Anna even being a girl
[28:33] see it didn't make no difference in the
[28:35] the DNA makeups and things it doesn't
[28:38] make one over the
[28:39] other you said well he's the firstborn
[28:42] well that's fine but everybody in the
[28:45] Kingdom of this one gets the same one
[28:47] because we're all children of the
[28:50] firstborn amen so in this family you and
[28:53] I are his
[28:55] offspring we're his children right amen
[28:58] that's what I've tried to get us to look
[29:00] back there that before the
[29:03] world God was D
[29:06] amen we'll read in a minute he was D
[29:09] with his
[29:10] attributes right and you're the
[29:13] attribute of your mother and
[29:15] father but you couldn't Fellowship until
[29:17] you got here so You' just be a
[29:20] gene back in your great granddaddies and
[29:24] and then as we were saying the other day
[29:25] then even when it come to to my mother
[29:28] and my daddy just because they got
[29:30] married that day didn't mean I was born
[29:31] the next one
[29:33] right I was a 13th so it took a long
[29:36] time to get me here all
[29:40] right so now I had to be a
[29:45] gene not a germ not a sperm those were
[29:49] never made until Mama and Daddy come to
[29:51] the bedroom as we'd call it then it
[29:54] develops into a a a
[29:57] a germ called a sperm and woman produces
[30:02] the egg but just remember the egg and
[30:05] the sperm until they're together there's
[30:07] no
[30:08] seed a seed you got to have the the the
[30:12] the cell and the The Germ the sperm
[30:15] together and then when that contacts you
[30:17] make a seed see then I could come forth
[30:19] from that right right and see that's the
[30:23] way it was with God when you look back
[30:25] to see what were we before the
[30:26] foundation world we were just a part of
[30:28] God
[30:30] Amen if you have eternal life right now
[30:35] if
[30:36] not we're not part of God now that's
[30:40] sensible that's why you got to be born
[30:42] again that's what he was telling
[30:44] Nicodemus he said Nicodemus you need
[30:46] eternal life well he thought he already
[30:48] had
[30:49] everything you and he was a good guy you
[30:54] know lined up real good find anything
[30:57] wrong with a guy back there they just
[30:59] take him out and kill him it didn't
[31:00] matter where his high priest or who he
[31:01] was they' kill him because that was the
[31:04] law
[31:06] right but you see then coming into where
[31:09] we're
[31:10] at we see that Jesus was almighty God
[31:14] manifested in flesh
[31:17] amen he was not a second person he was
[31:20] not a third person he was not even a
[31:22] first person you remember I gave that
[31:23] the other night on the unveiling of God
[31:25] paragraph 74
[31:28] he was the
[31:30] person because if you say Jesus was the
[31:32] first person that means they can be
[31:34] other
[31:35] persons no he was God Almighty in human
[31:39] flesh are the biggest liar the world
[31:41] ever
[31:43] seen I have no problem talking like that
[31:46] got to know who I'm talking
[31:48] about but if he was the second person of
[31:51] the Trinity that we talk
[31:53] about you know that the world believes
[31:55] in God the Father father God the son God
[31:58] the Holy Ghost I want scripture for
[32:01] that I mean I I want a scripture that
[32:04] ever called him God the son they called
[32:07] him Son of God right but never called
[32:10] him God the son because it would mean
[32:12] that he had a beginning and then you go
[32:14] into co-equal and co-eternal that's
[32:16] right
[32:18] right Blessed Trinity co-equal
[32:22] coeternal come on sensible language
[32:26] father son Holy Ghost son had a
[32:29] beginning how can a son be co-equal with
[32:31] his father how can he be of the same age
[32:35] yeah a sensible he all you're just using
[32:38] terminologies well what are you thinking
[32:41] your brain's
[32:42] running your brain's running off the
[32:45] terminologies that you've heard all your
[32:48] life you've been taught all your life
[32:50] that there was three
[32:52] gods and then you've been brought down
[32:55] from that to someone say no there not
[32:57] three Gods Baptist Doctrine I came from
[32:59] there I know it Baptist Doctrine is one
[33:03] God but when you explain it it's God in
[33:05] three persons Blessed Trinity which is
[33:08] the same as any other believing in three
[33:10] Gods right yeah Jesus in you don't go to
[33:14] no Jesus we don't believe in Oneness
[33:17] Oneness went this way Trinity went that
[33:19] way Oneness says he's one like your
[33:21] finger the Old Testament was Jehovah
[33:24] then Jesus now holy ghost
[33:27] all Trinity runs you off into the three
[33:31] neither one of them is correct bring it
[33:32] together in the middle Jesus said unless
[33:35] you believe that I am he amen you will
[33:40] die in your
[33:42] sin no who's the he talking about right
[33:46] he said I and my father are one
[33:49] amen well now what that should have been
[33:52] I and my father are two but we don't
[33:55] know how to explain it that's what Billy
[33:56] Graham said said about it not throwing
[33:58] off on
[33:59] him but I read it in the newspaper one
[34:01] day he said it can't be explained I said
[34:04] what you need is a
[34:08] revelation what you need is a revelation
[34:10] then you need a an
[34:12] experience and then when you do you come
[34:14] down to see that there's just one true
[34:16] and living
[34:19] God are we going to get up to heaven
[34:21] there going to be a God over here it's a
[34:22] pillar of fire and a God over here it's
[34:24] a son and a God over here it's a father
[34:27] or
[34:28] something no take what Jesus said he
[34:31] said if you seen me that's
[34:34] right you've seen the father that's
[34:36] right there in human
[34:40] flesh dwelling on Earth that that flesh
[34:42] had a beginning Hebrews 10:5 a body thou
[34:45] Hast prepared me in that body dwelt the
[34:48] soul and the spirit of almighty
[34:51] God that's
[34:53] right and that's why it was God made
[34:55] manifest in flesh
[34:57] man why did they kill
[35:00] him they said you're a man making
[35:03] yourself
[35:05] God read your scripture no it was God
[35:08] making a man standing in front of
[35:10] him but see we don't see it and we don't
[35:13] try to bring it into the correct
[35:16] understanding because we don't believe
[35:17] in Eternal sunship how could you have an
[35:19] eternal
[35:23] son well don't you believe that we have
[35:25] eternal life right but we're not Eternal
[35:30] Sons right come on we're the children of
[35:34] God which have eternal life and we can
[35:37] be called a son right as I keep
[35:41] referring to it Dar in Daniel where they
[35:43] said Nebuchadnezzar said we throw three
[35:45] in there and there's a fourth man down
[35:48] there and it killed the guys that throw
[35:50] a men and he looked down and he said it
[35:53] must be the Son of God Amen that's right
[35:55] that man at least had sin
[36:00] because he knew that somebody protected
[36:03] them three h children right and if
[36:06] somebody protected him it could only be
[36:09] God and if he could see
[36:12] him it wouldn't be correct see cu the
[36:15] Bible say no man has seen God at any
[36:18] time but the only begotten have declared
[36:20] him or brought him forth
[36:24] right all right dark standing on Earth
[36:26] was almighty God in human flesh
[36:29] right all right and by the new
[36:33] birth that we must receive to have
[36:36] eternal life on Amen I put this in every
[36:41] message we must receive eternal
[36:44] life well uh what about all these let's
[36:47] get to these quotes in a
[36:50] minute it's like Wade said about the
[36:52] brother saying something he said our
[36:55] daddy come along use the same quotes and
[36:56] come it over here and bring it this way
[36:58] this brother bring it over that
[37:00] way you know wouldn't it that way would
[37:03] we done
[37:04] it then we all used to
[37:06] say Lord Jesus Christ father son Holy
[37:12] Ghost bring it together and one of you
[37:14] got amen Father Son and Holy Ghost Lord
[37:18] Jesus Christ we bring it together as the
[37:20] one right all right now in getting to it
[37:24] then we don't believe in an eternal
[37:25] sunship
[37:28] but we believe in an eternal godship you
[37:31] remember I gave you that one thinking uh
[37:33] thirsting for Life paragraph or E12
[37:38] 1957 not
[37:40] Eternal godhead I mean Eternal sunship
[37:44] but it's the Eternal where's it at in
[37:46] the middle all it could be an eternal
[37:50] godship but never an eternal sunship a
[37:53] son is one that's begotten just son has
[37:56] a beginning right
[37:59] right Jesus the body had a
[38:03] beginning and it had to be redeemed not
[38:05] that it was sinful but it had to be made
[38:08] Eternal right in the resurrection all
[38:12] right but see inside of there was the
[38:14] Eternal God that's it well what is the
[38:17] new birth amen same
[38:20] thing no no brother Dale we're the son
[38:23] of
[38:24] Jesus that's the son of God then that
[38:27] makes you a grandchild right
[38:30] right if we don't believe in Eternal
[38:32] sunship for Jesus how did Jesus give us
[38:34] eternal life that's why Paul said it
[38:37] summed it up and he says we're Heirs of
[38:41] God right and join
[38:45] ours with
[38:49] Christ then whatever God is Christ would
[38:52] have to be the
[38:55] same and and if we receive that life
[38:58] come on then we are his children amen
[39:02] all right now and what did he do see God
[39:06] poured
[39:08] himself out on the day of
[39:11] Pentecost out of him came that eternal
[39:14] life right the into thy hands I Comm in
[39:16] my
[39:17] spirit is that what he said on the cross
[39:20] we see that same holy spirit that was
[39:24] dwelling in him that same God came back
[39:27] on the day of Pentecost in the form of
[39:30] the baptism of the Holy
[39:32] Ghost the disciples wasn't sitting up in
[39:35] the upper room and all at once they they
[39:37] got a knowledge that they always
[39:40] was you see where the devil has tried to
[39:43] pull it over on us
[39:45] right I don't fight what's out
[39:49] there he nothing out there to
[39:51] fight ain't no fight for a
[39:55] trinity you you know just you just blow
[39:57] them off and go on I don't mean that
[40:00] wrong I respect people I sit down and
[40:03] listen to them talk but then I just like
[40:05] to ask a few simple
[40:08] questions and that's the way I do now in
[40:10] the message of people
[40:11] right if we came into the world with
[40:13] eternal life then Jesus Christ died in
[40:15] vain that's right that's a simple qu
[40:18] answer to me I mean I don't take a whole
[40:22] theological discussion it just takes
[40:25] common sense
[40:27] Amen to realize that we were lost
[40:31] amen but yet he come to pay the price
[40:35] amen and as far as God is concerned as
[40:36] we read in Romans those he's Justified
[40:39] he's already glorified as far as he's
[40:41] concerned it's over
[40:43] with but we must receive
[40:47] it all right B says the gift of the Holy
[40:51] Ghost which is eternal life
[40:54] now let's start start off on Number Two
[40:57] Brother Anderson and just pick up our
[41:05] thoughts and I want you to get
[41:08] this really good paragraph 153 there
[41:11] roll it on up you read all the other
[41:14] before you get to it but look what he
[41:18] says this life that's within us all
[41:21] right that was in
[41:25] 1963 uh 11 or 117 1963 the life that's
[41:30] in
[41:31] US is not only a creative life now watch
[41:35] hold that
[41:37] point but it's a part of his own
[41:41] life so now really what's he
[41:45] saying he's saying that the part we have
[41:48] in US is not a creative
[41:51] life cuz that would be something
[41:53] different that's right
[41:57] he's saying it's a part of you know part
[41:59] of him that's the reason we have the
[42:01] authority to speak to the devil because
[42:04] it's God's Own creative life now
[42:08] where if you're anointed correctly not
[42:12] you it's not you that speaketh but the
[42:15] father that dwelleth in you see take no
[42:18] thought what you'll say because it'll be
[42:20] added at that time just go on stay with
[42:22] it he said I love it so then we are not
[42:25] a creative being of
[42:28] God we're a part of God that's what he's
[42:32] explaining it's a part of his own life
[42:35] so you isolate a quote you can worry
[42:37] yourself to death on it you can kill
[42:39] yourself trying to just like the Bible I
[42:42] can read you in the Bible where it's
[42:43] said to baptize in the name of the
[42:46] father and of the son and of the Holy
[42:49] Ghost that's in the Bible Matthew 28:19
[42:54] about 10 days later Peter is asked men
[42:58] and Brethren what must we do to be
[43:01] saved you repent everyone and be bapti
[43:04] in the name of Jesus
[43:06] Christ now Peter was supposed to be the
[43:09] spokesman you know the the the guy that
[43:11] was supposed to understand he had the
[43:13] Keys of the
[43:15] Kingdom and he couldn't remember 10
[43:18] days what the Lord Jesus told
[43:21] him now he said exactly what the Lord
[43:24] Jesus said they said Holy Ghost Father
[43:26] Son and Holy Ghost those those are not
[43:30] names what it says in the Bible Matthew
[43:32] 28:19 read it in the name of the father
[43:36] and of the son and of the Holy Ghost
[43:38] what's the name of the father Son and
[43:39] the Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ that's
[43:42] right sensible amen right father son
[43:46] Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ simple
[43:48] language then show me in the Bible where
[43:51] anybody was ever baptized Father Son and
[43:53] Holy Ghost and show me in history until
[43:56] the Catholic Church changed it and I'll
[43:59] show you in history where they changed
[44:01] it I'll give you a list in my office and
[44:04] you go home and read your own
[44:06] encyclopedias and it'll show you the
[44:08] Catholic Church Chang the way of
[44:11] baptizing to Father Son and Holy Ghost
[44:13] right nobody in the Bible was ever
[44:15] baptized that way right that's right
[44:18] it's also about 100 years later or
[44:20] something like that close that they
[44:22] started changing it but yet we believe
[44:25] the Catholic church but no no no I
[44:27] believe the
[44:28] Bible well now you got a
[44:32] contradiction father son Holy Ghost Lord
[44:34] Jesus Christ you got a
[44:35] contradiction and you say you believe in
[44:38] it you say you believe God's word is
[44:40] pure and
[44:42] true amen come
[44:45] on now I'm saying that for one point
[44:47] this way we say we believe a prophet's
[44:50] message amen and yet we're always trying
[44:54] to prove I'm not us now
[44:56] people are trying to prove him
[45:01] wrong you know why because if you can
[45:04] prove somebody wrong you don't have to
[45:05] worry about what he
[45:07] said right if you can prove to me the
[45:10] Bible's wrong then we'll Tire the Bible
[45:11] up throw it away
[45:13] right if God can't keep his word
[45:15] straight out there's no
[45:18] God I got on my study there at the house
[45:21] you know Darwin's theory you
[45:24] know that the
[45:26] monkey well I found this somewhere that
[45:29] we was cleaning out a house with teren
[45:31] and and I brought that thing home I got
[45:34] sitting on my study you know you'd have
[45:37] doing you'd have Darwin if you were
[45:39] looking at you'd have Darwin sitting
[45:40] with the skull of a monkey you know and
[45:43] looking at it and trying to figure out
[45:44] if we come what I've got is a monkey
[45:48] sitting with Darwin's
[45:51] head and I like
[45:54] it yeah
[45:58] he'd take a monkey to figure all that
[46:00] out so I said well to go he saidwell we
[46:03] all come from this who started it that's
[46:06] it right there and I'd like to know how
[46:09] you give an alligator to a bird I never
[46:10] could figure that out I mean that that's
[46:12] beyond me anyway but you know you try to
[46:15] do it but now
[46:17] watch so
[46:19] then it's not that we are a creative
[46:22] life of
[46:23] God right
[46:27] that would mean that that you were
[46:29] saying that we were chosen by
[46:33] him and then he' create
[46:36] us see that would make you something
[46:39] separate from him and you can't create
[46:42] anything
[46:43] Eternal you you got enough sense to know
[46:46] that if you created at a
[46:50] beginning so it's not to say that we are
[46:52] a creative life we are why because we're
[46:57] human Mortals out here this is creative
[47:00] life this what you're looking at is
[47:02] creative life it's not
[47:06] Eternal but see inside of it is a part
[47:09] of God Amen by the new
[47:13] birth all right then being that then
[47:15] that part is not
[47:20] creative see the eternal life you have
[47:23] is not create that's why we we we
[47:25] Baptist and to off on them I just talk
[47:28] plain we'd say well I hope I'm going to
[47:30] heaven I believe I'm going to heaven
[47:31] maybe I'm going to heaven the Methodist
[47:34] come along and said well if you're
[47:35] Sanctified today and you die you're
[47:37] going to heaven but if you're not
[47:38] Sanctified you're not going to make it
[47:39] see everybody's always worried about
[47:41] going to
[47:43] heaven right happy hunting ground for
[47:46] the old Indian you know everybody's
[47:48] concerned about something after this
[47:51] world I'm not concerned about what's
[47:53] after this world that's right that's
[47:55] right right cuz I realize if I don't
[47:57] receive eternal life while I'm in this
[48:00] world I'm going to have to go before the
[48:02] white Throne
[48:04] judgment amen but if I receive eternal
[48:07] life here I don't have to worry about
[48:08] the Judgment because the Bible said I
[48:11] passed from Death un
[48:14] life it's not going to be one of these
[48:16] days we're going up there and decide
[48:17] whether we're going to heaven or not
[48:19] uh-uh somebody's going to get it right
[48:23] here because the Bible says we're
[48:24] changed in a moment twink of an
[48:26] eye and I believe that's what this
[48:28] message came to do
[48:31] I to bring us to a place to see who we
[48:35] are and what we're doing here the
[48:38] prophet said when she realizes that said
[48:40] she'll be gone well I think we're
[48:42] beginning to realize that I ain't
[48:43] worried about Obama and it
[48:45] Obamacare I never did worry about him to
[48:47] start with you know I appreciate uh
[48:51] retiring from General Motors I
[48:53] appreciate that glad to get a check I
[48:56] appreciate that but I don't have to
[48:57] worry about it I can live without it I
[49:00] can go down to Walmart and get me a
[49:01] greeters card on the front and make a
[49:04] living and I will do it if I have to I
[49:09] can't stand this generation of
[49:11] people well you know if I if I go down
[49:14] there and put in that I'll only get uh
[49:17] $7 an
[49:20] hour and I've got this degree and I'm
[49:23] not working for somebody for seven an
[49:26] hour will starve to
[49:28] death amen but now here comes the
[49:31] government to feed all of them sorry
[49:35] Bunch
[49:37] right that's why I'm not against that
[49:39] that's that's just all the governments
[49:40] and everything
[49:43] else well I'm not going to work two jobs
[49:45] to make a living you sorry lazy
[49:48] bum anything else you want me to say I
[49:52] don't have no troubles with it because I
[49:54] work for a living that's
[49:57] right I started pastoring this church
[50:00] right here I was working at gentle
[50:02] Motors that's
[50:04] right and I didn't have nobody to preach
[50:07] with me after brother Mo got sick and
[50:09] the
[50:10] problem I by myself preaching three
[50:12] times a week and working at General
[50:14] Motors and sometimes working 50 60 hours
[50:18] a week CU we work 10 hours a day and 8
[50:21] hours on
[50:23] Saturday so that'd be 50 8 hours we had
[50:26] to
[50:28] do and I was building houses and
[50:30] building on to the church and doing all
[50:32] that and preaching three times a week
[50:34] you lazy bunch of
[50:36] preachers that's what I told a man one
[50:38] time he said you know he said I'm just
[50:39] work to death this week I said what'd
[50:41] you
[50:42] do he told me what he done I said my
[50:45] Lord
[50:47] man if I called his name everybody here
[50:49] know I said I told him how many hours
[50:53] I'd work and how much I'd travel and how
[50:55] much work I'd done at building houses
[50:56] and churches and I and I said besid that
[50:59] I'm preaching three times a week I said
[51:01] you need a
[51:03] job he did he he had too much spare
[51:06] time sorry about that that just get down
[51:09] to show you what I think about life I'm
[51:10] not against Obama it wouldn't have been
[51:12] no different if McCain would have been
[51:14] put in office probably went down quicker
[51:17] I'm not a Republican or a
[51:20] Democrat my Kingdom's not of this world
[51:23] that's what I was saying while IO
[51:25] my kingdom is is from
[51:28] above all this stuff ain't going to be
[51:31] there why because Paul said we are his
[51:37] offspring all right let's get to that
[51:38] scripture go ahead and pull it up
[51:40] brother I get away with my notes sorry
[51:44] about that acts 17 pull up number four
[51:48] CU I want you to look at the scripture
[51:50] there
[51:51] it and I want you to think about
[51:54] it
[51:58] Paul is explaining on Mars Hill to those
[52:00] people you remember they had all kind of
[52:02] gods they had all kind of thing and they
[52:04] had a little cubicle or something made
[52:06] and and they had a little sign there and
[52:07] just in case they forgot one cuz they
[52:10] had you know nobody tell them how many
[52:11] they had but they had a sign that said
[52:14] to the unknown God right just in case
[52:17] they forgot read the book of Acts they
[52:19] can roll it down from there but just in
[52:22] case that they missed one of them
[52:26] Paul said that's the one I want to talk
[52:28] to you about the unknown God now he's
[52:32] quoting
[52:34] them that's a good way to get a fell to
[52:37] listen to
[52:39] you see their Doctrine was that mankind
[52:43] was The Offspring of God they just had
[52:45] many gods many daddies I guess you call
[52:47] so look at it for in him we live and
[52:49] move and have our being as certain also
[52:53] of your own poets you putting it back to
[52:55] them have said for we are also his
[53:02] offspring put it right back in their lap
[53:04] this is the guy I want to talk to you
[53:05] about this unknown God
[53:10] right and you say we are his
[53:13] offspring look up that word
[53:15] Offspring children Kindred Etc the same
[53:18] things I gave you on generation right
[53:20] all right but look at the scripture for
[53:23] as much then as we
[53:26] are The Offspring of
[53:31] God but have you ever thought about the
[53:33] rest of
[53:36] that for as much as we are The Offspring
[53:39] of God we ought not to think that the
[53:43] godhead is liken to gold or silver or
[53:46] stone Graven by Art and man's devices
[53:50] you've ever thought about that what that
[53:54] means
[53:56] you ever just considered that part we
[53:57] quote the first of it we Offspring but
[53:59] have you ever considered what he's
[54:01] saying can I give brother Dale's
[54:05] understanding okay and just talk a
[54:07] little bit about it for as much then as
[54:09] we are The Offspring we are the children
[54:11] of God
[54:13] Amen now if we are the children of
[54:16] God
[54:19] right
[54:21] we ought not to think
[54:25] that the
[54:29] godhead is some kind of an image that
[54:32] you guys have set up over here to your
[54:34] own your gods and left one to the
[54:36] unknown is that what he's saying that's
[54:38] right what right do you and I have with
[54:41] thinking of God being other anything
[54:43] other than a
[54:45] person yet that's been the hardest thing
[54:47] for me to try to preach for 40 something
[54:49] years that God is a being not like the
[54:52] wind blowing about right he has a
[54:55] headquarters he has a heaven to live
[55:00] in come on Earth is foot tool in
[55:04] Heavens he's a person no God is a
[55:11] spirit you're quoting scripture but keep
[55:13] on
[55:14] quoting right God is a being he's a
[55:18] person the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[55:20] a
[55:21] person we'll get down to it later like w
[55:23] was said there hoo
[55:26] or brother Joe one of the two in the
[55:28] office or want to go see we say well
[55:30] that's just a spot that's in
[55:34] you well I don't have a spot in
[55:39] me a spot in my soul is no good that's
[55:43] right because Devil's got a lot of spot
[55:46] there until you're born
[55:50] again but if God is a
[55:54] person
[55:56] now you're just trying to make him some
[55:58] kind of a something
[55:59] tangible hey we come from there so he
[56:03] must be more tangible than we are
[56:07] right right God must more be more real
[56:10] than what you're looking at or I'm
[56:11] beating on why cuz he created
[56:16] it see then we shouldn't in no way think
[56:20] about the godhead is being right some
[56:23] kind of a gold or images or anything we
[56:26] talk about that's right we should think
[56:29] of the godhead as being almighty
[56:32] God not Eternal sunship as we're talking
[56:34] about but Eternal godship I believe in
[56:37] an eternal
[56:39] godhead I gave you the quote from the
[56:41] prophet the other day on that Eternal
[56:42] godhead
[56:45] what not a father son like a son we
[56:48] think
[56:49] of but a father Son and Holy Ghost is a
[56:52] three attributes of God that's right
[56:58] and he's Eternal amen so let's don't
[57:00] think about well I wonder what God
[57:04] is oh he just a spirit he's just
[57:07] floating around see we've had a message
[57:09] to explain those things I'll be glad
[57:12] somebody write and send it to me I'll be
[57:14] glad to give you the quotes where the
[57:15] Prophet said God is a being he is not
[57:18] like the wind that's aoya the African
[57:22] word amoya which means I breathe and you
[57:25] breathe my soul goes to you and your
[57:27] soul goes to me that's what the amoyal
[57:29] word
[57:32] means that's not true that's not God God
[57:35] is a person he's
[57:37] real we're not going to get up to heaven
[57:40] and I goes a Halo oh hi
[57:45] Father no when we get there we'll see
[57:47] Jesus and we'll know who he is cuz he's
[57:51] almighty God
[57:53] Amen and you know how come we'll be able
[57:56] to see
[57:58] him because we'll be like him that's
[58:01] what the Bible said the Bible says as he
[58:04] is in this world so are we amen we'll
[58:07] get to that in a minute I got in the
[58:08] scripture what are you thinking about
[58:11] it see we shouldn't think
[58:15] about anything about the
[58:18] godhead except to believe that there's
[58:20] one true and living God CU if not we're
[58:22] not in idolatry
[58:28] if God is not
[58:30] real then okay let's go home eat drink
[58:33] and be marry cuz we
[58:35] die Darwin had it right we fell off over
[58:37] a glorified monkey tree but I don't
[58:40] believe in
[58:43] that I believe people are
[58:46] real I believe that even when you
[58:49] die and they take your body down they
[58:52] put it in the gray or they burn it
[58:54] that's not all of
[58:57] you you got a place to go to amen right
[59:01] to wait until a judgment day
[59:05] amen and you're called a
[59:08] soul so I believe in eternal life as a
[59:12] person not a thought or a
[59:15] concept if it's just a spec then a spec
[59:18] is not a
[59:22] person I believe the new birth is is the
[59:25] person of Jesus Christ coming in you to
[59:28] give you eternal life
[59:32] amen and that don't make you a second
[59:34] person that's right right amen right it
[59:38] makes you part of him
[59:41] amen all right let's give a couple of
[59:43] quotes CU I know we ain't going to get
[59:45] to we'll finish the season if we don't
[59:46] we'll finish Wednesday who worries we're
[59:48] Eternal
[59:50] people look what he says on the who is
[59:53] God preach the 19
[59:55] uh
[59:56] 50
[59:59] 8:15 well they're getting there he comes
[1:00:01] down he says the Bible says we are Sons
[1:00:03] and Daughters of God he is Offspring
[1:00:07] yeah we got to get on the right one okay
[1:00:08] now we got we are Sons and Daughters of
[1:00:11] God is
[1:00:13] Offspring now when then we're something
[1:00:16] like God
[1:00:18] was and watch Jesus said himself it is
[1:00:23] written your Gods come on that's what
[1:00:26] the Bible says about
[1:00:27] you it don't say your sons are God it
[1:00:30] says you're Gods right written in your
[1:00:33] law we become a part of God a Son of God
[1:00:36] by adoption through Jesus Christ that's
[1:00:39] exactly right because he come to make a
[1:00:40] way where you and I could have eternal
[1:00:42] life that's right and he had to die to
[1:00:45] release that life that's right so then
[1:00:46] we're The Offspring of God Amen all
[1:00:49] right look at the look at we've been
[1:00:51] through the scripture let's see yeah
[1:00:53] we'll skip
[1:00:55] all
[1:00:56] right now watch what he says here and
[1:00:58] let's get these couple of things and
[1:00:59] then then I want to hit something that I
[1:01:02] want you to pay close
[1:01:04] attention and anybody on the internet
[1:01:06] system if you're going to miss this
[1:01:07] evening please come back and get it
[1:01:09] because we're going to get into some
[1:01:11] statements that a lot of people use but
[1:01:14] they're they're using them incorrectly
[1:01:17] you can make brother around say anything
[1:01:18] you want to just like you make the Bible
[1:01:19] say anything you want
[1:01:21] to but you can't take it all
[1:01:25] right you take all the Bible and it'll
[1:01:27] come out a beautiful picture no
[1:01:29] contradictions I want to see
[1:01:33] one oh these theologians say I want to
[1:01:35] see one I mean I'm on the internet come
[1:01:37] on I want to see a contradiction in the
[1:01:40] Bible but don't be
[1:01:42] dumb come up and say David had 40,000
[1:01:47] chariots and then you read over here
[1:01:49] he's only got four over th over at
[1:01:51] Jerusalem man said that to me one time I
[1:01:53] said look he got 30 6,000 scattered
[1:01:55] somewhere else what are you talking
[1:01:58] about it didn't say he had all of them
[1:02:01] there see that's what we we we want to
[1:02:04] make some kind of little bitty silly
[1:02:06] thing you
[1:02:08] know you well brother Dale God is a
[1:02:14] Spirit Well I believe there was a
[1:02:16] certain man one
[1:02:18] day after his
[1:02:20] resurrection did he come walking among
[1:02:22] the
[1:02:23] people
[1:02:25] and they said it's a
[1:02:27] spirit you remember what he
[1:02:30] said he said a spirit hath not flesh and
[1:02:33] bone go get me something to
[1:02:36] eat what he done wasn't he
[1:02:39] he he actually ate some fish right he
[1:02:43] was real all
[1:02:46] right look chosen in him okay let's go
[1:02:50] ahead to number five sardian Church age
[1:02:53] paragraph or page 284 which is 284
[1:02:56] Church age book this is the record God
[1:02:59] has given us eternal life and this life
[1:03:02] is in his son now he's coming bringing
[1:03:04] the scripture right he that hath the son
[1:03:06] ha life eternal and he that hath not the
[1:03:10] son hath not life eternal so if we're
[1:03:12] not born again we don't have eternal
[1:03:14] life sensible and those who have that
[1:03:17] life were in
[1:03:20] him now what he didn't say by him it
[1:03:23] were in him
[1:03:26] before the foundation of the world they
[1:03:28] were chosen in him before the foundation
[1:03:30] of the world that great Royal seed Jesus
[1:03:34] Christ was planted he died and that life
[1:03:38] that was in him came up through the
[1:03:40] wheat plants and is reproducing itself
[1:03:43] again in multitudes of wheat seeds
[1:03:46] having the same life in them and being
[1:03:49] like the original because by Spirit they
[1:03:53] are original oral coming up through the
[1:03:56] church ages coming up through time
[1:03:57] coming out to an end time to understand
[1:04:00] who we
[1:04:05] are what are you understanding you
[1:04:07] following my point
[1:04:10] yes and what I want you to do is I want
[1:04:12] you to read with me you know as we look
[1:04:14] at a few and we'll just have to get a
[1:04:16] few little things and then quit and come
[1:04:17] back this
[1:04:20] evening but I want you to listen very
[1:04:23] carefully
[1:04:24] to the
[1:04:27] reading and then you make up your own
[1:04:29] mind what's
[1:04:31] right the visitors and some you know
[1:04:33] they don't know what we're talking about
[1:04:35] in that basis but there's a lot of
[1:04:36] people in this message believe that we
[1:04:38] come into the world with eternal
[1:04:40] life y always living in US eternal life
[1:04:44] well that's Eternal sunship right that's
[1:04:47] Catholic doctrines that's that's those
[1:04:49] things I believe you must be born again
[1:04:52] to have eternal life but yet God by his
[1:04:55] great Infinite Wisdom knew who would be
[1:04:58] saved and who
[1:05:00] wouldn't so he could go ahead and set
[1:05:03] everything in motion that's right and
[1:05:05] when you come into the world you had to
[1:05:06] receive it I believe you must receive
[1:05:08] eternal life for that soul to be Eternal
[1:05:11] amen sir am amen yeah but I come in the
[1:05:14] world with an eternal Soul now I want
[1:05:16] that I want that in the prophet's
[1:05:19] message I want it in the
[1:05:22] Bible because Jesus died in
[1:05:25] Vine well you're just an intellectual
[1:05:27] smart
[1:05:28] El if my intellect can out preach your
[1:05:31] Holy Ghost I'd
[1:05:34] trade I've said that 40 years ago and I
[1:05:37] don't back up from it now if a man was
[1:05:40] an intellect can out preach a man with
[1:05:41] the Holy Ghost you need to do some
[1:05:42] swapping
[1:05:45] somewhere I had a great Theologian
[1:05:47] telling me he was a Greek scholar
[1:05:49] Theologian told me one day he said I can
[1:05:51] tear you apart with a word I said
[1:05:53] probably can again but he didn't change
[1:05:55] my
[1:05:57] thinking I said we'll still meet you
[1:05:59] anywhere you want to
[1:06:01] meet and give you three months to
[1:06:04] explain what you're talking about I want
[1:06:06] one
[1:06:07] service is all I want that wasn't
[1:06:10] sarcastic it just I knew where I was
[1:06:12] standing you think I was afraid of him
[1:06:14] because he was a Greek scholar no I
[1:06:16] respected him he went to school to learn
[1:06:18] all those things I didn't have the
[1:06:20] ability so I've got to depend on God
[1:06:23] right
[1:06:25] well we ain't never had none of those
[1:06:27] meetings but that's all
[1:06:28] right but now listen to what brother
[1:06:30] randam had to
[1:06:32] say there's a lot of emphasized said we
[1:06:36] we were
[1:06:39] always
[1:06:40] Eternal now I want you to just read with
[1:06:44] common
[1:06:46] sense all right go ahead and pull up
[1:06:49] number
[1:06:53] seven
[1:06:56] all
[1:06:58] right I want you to notice the little
[1:07:00] word
[1:07:02] if if is always a
[1:07:06] question the Bible says if the spirit of
[1:07:11] God be in you it will also Quicken your
[1:07:15] mortal
[1:07:17] body that's the scripture right if so
[1:07:21] that means if means if
[1:07:25] I was life in other day cuz I was
[1:07:27] thinking about it we was watching the a
[1:07:29] video on the president and know and you
[1:07:31] remember uh and I don't thought them cuz
[1:07:33] none of I bus but you remember uh the
[1:07:37] guy that said what is
[1:07:40] is you know I mean he just tra in words
[1:07:43] they could never get him do you
[1:07:45] have relationship I never had no
[1:07:48] relationship with
[1:07:52] her then he come up what what is is I
[1:07:56] laughed then you say to me what if what
[1:07:59] if what is
[1:08:01] if if is a
[1:08:03] question right all right now I got
[1:08:05] another statement to come behind that so
[1:08:07] don't turn me off on the internet the
[1:08:08] rest of people hear it
[1:08:11] okay you say if is a qu I'll go ahead
[1:08:14] and put it here make sure you don't lose
[1:08:16] you say if is is is not a question
[1:08:18] brother
[1:08:19] Dale it's a
[1:08:22] statement
[1:08:25] I'm glad you thought of
[1:08:28] that right cuz see the Holy Spirit
[1:08:31] already said they'll ask
[1:08:33] that they'll say if is not a question
[1:08:37] it's a statement
[1:08:40] amen so either way I'm right if it's a
[1:08:43] question of if or if it's a statement of
[1:08:46] if they're both the
[1:08:49] same now blow
[1:08:52] you see because I sitting in the study
[1:08:55] and I just say well Lord what are they
[1:08:57] going to
[1:08:58] say he says tell them
[1:09:01] this it's never been wrong yet so I
[1:09:04] ain't worried about it now if you've got
[1:09:08] eternal
[1:09:11] life
[1:09:12] tonight if we have eternal life to us
[1:09:17] then we always
[1:09:22] were well what he's saying we always
[1:09:24] were no he's questioning
[1:09:29] it or a statement of
[1:09:33] it if you have eternal life the eternal
[1:09:37] life in you always was
[1:09:41] eternal but that don't mean we
[1:09:44] were come on now if you got eternal
[1:09:48] life tonight if we have eternal life
[1:09:52] then we always work
[1:09:54] because there's only one form of eternal
[1:09:56] life we always were watch now and the
[1:10:00] reason we
[1:10:03] were because we are a part of
[1:10:10] God right because we're part of God if
[1:10:14] we have eternal life right that should
[1:10:16] be no problem with anybody right
[1:10:19] problem if we got it right but if we
[1:10:22] don't have it we
[1:10:25] and you can make all the statements you
[1:10:26] can say I got
[1:10:28] it and leave the if off and you made the
[1:10:30] same
[1:10:32] statement you see yeah but you just
[1:10:34] don't understand because we always
[1:10:39] were we
[1:10:47] who now we'll get back to it this
[1:10:49] evening course anybody misses it that
[1:10:52] statement right there is is made seven
[1:10:55] times eight times in the
[1:11:04] message if
[1:11:08] we two times he says if you have eternal
[1:11:14] life 17
[1:11:18] times he
[1:11:20] said if you've got eternal life
[1:11:25] sound like questions to
[1:11:29] me he said no that's a statement okay
[1:11:31] then the statement and the question is
[1:11:33] the
[1:11:35] same the statement is I have eternal
[1:11:42] life but when did you get it amen well I
[1:11:45] come into the world with it well then
[1:11:48] you don't need Jesus Christ that's right
[1:11:50] right amen do away with your salvation
[1:11:52] course most of them them have most
[1:11:54] everybody's done away with salvation
[1:11:56] they just preach oh that's that old
[1:11:58] simple stuff back under and I keep
[1:12:00] giving that quote to you in the seal
[1:12:02] book he said go on with the same simple
[1:12:05] message cuz if not you'll work your way
[1:12:07] self away from
[1:12:10] it that's what they've done they've
[1:12:12] worked it way that we always we we we
[1:12:14] we're we're
[1:12:17] Eternal and I warned these brothers and
[1:12:19] warned them over and
[1:12:21] over and I keep warning on the internet
[1:12:23] that over and
[1:12:25] over you show me one of those
[1:12:29] doctrines and those people believing
[1:12:31] that they always was eternal and that is
[1:12:33] a two- Soul Doctrine whether you believe
[1:12:35] it or like it and you show me them and
[1:12:38] I'll call the names of them that every
[1:12:40] one of them went into
[1:12:46] polygamy now you know we're against
[1:12:51] that come on and see that's why people
[1:12:54] don't want to say nothing to me because
[1:12:57] I just put it too plain I know it I'm
[1:12:58] sorry but that's just what I
[1:13:02] am see he's saying if you have eternal
[1:13:06] life the eternal life that's in you
[1:13:09] always was eternal right amen
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:16] right roll it on up to the
[1:13:21] other now we are a part of
[1:13:25] God now how do you become a part of
[1:13:28] God the only way a human mortal become
[1:13:31] part of God is get born again how the
[1:13:32] life of God right go now we are a part
[1:13:37] of God you always was that's right you
[1:13:41] don't remember it because you were only
[1:13:43] an
[1:13:44] attribute in God you were only in his
[1:13:52] thinking you were an attribute the
[1:13:54] question was asiz now what is an
[1:13:56] attribute expressed
[1:13:59] on an
[1:14:02] attribute is you are the attribute of
[1:14:04] your
[1:14:08] parents and in God you were an attribute
[1:14:11] there's only three attributes of God
[1:14:12] father son Holy
[1:14:15] Ghost so that means if any way in the
[1:14:17] world we were back there it's you're
[1:14:19] going to have to deal with Father Son
[1:14:20] and Holy
[1:14:22] Ghost as
[1:14:26] attributes an attribute of God is a part
[1:14:28] of
[1:14:31] God you remember the other day when I
[1:14:33] asked you the
[1:14:38] question is this what he thought
[1:14:44] of or is this the point of his thinking
[1:14:48] right which way you
[1:14:51] going come on have my made a statement I
[1:14:54] keep making them for people to listen he
[1:14:56] said well brother D I believe I was a
[1:14:58] predestinated
[1:15:01] seed
[1:15:04] okay that means a
[1:15:11] predetermined and hey we've done
[1:15:13] preached about four messages back on the
[1:15:15] other side of
[1:15:19] predestination going back by his for
[1:15:22] knowledge and now going back into the
[1:15:24] very thoughts
[1:15:25] itself I don't want to be what God
[1:15:28] thought
[1:15:29] of I want to be a part of that God that
[1:15:33] done to thinking then I don't have to
[1:15:35] worry about
[1:15:37] it see because eternal life folks is a
[1:15:40] person to me it's not a concept or a
[1:15:45] thought but yet they'll take these you
[1:15:48] know and they'll say see look at look
[1:15:49] look at that brother Dale you you just
[1:15:51] don't understand you he he he said you
[1:15:53] always
[1:15:54] was is
[1:15:58] yeah so that mean you're always
[1:16:08] Eternal how could you have eternal life
[1:16:12] in your
[1:16:13] soul and the devil being there at the
[1:16:15] same time now you explain that and you
[1:16:18] come and tell me that that ain't
[1:16:20] right you're making yourself an eternal
[1:16:22] sin
[1:16:26] you got to admit the soul had
[1:16:30] problems you got to admit the devil was
[1:16:34] there and then you going to put God
[1:16:41] there it don't even make sense to me and
[1:16:43] I don't have no education I'm
[1:16:45] sorry maybe I'm a dumb I can't
[1:16:49] understand but I'm just dumb enough to
[1:16:52] believe
[1:16:55] in one
[1:16:56] thing that you and I didn't come into
[1:16:59] the world with eternal
[1:17:01] life dwelling in our soul well I the
[1:17:04] prophet said it we're going to get to
[1:17:06] that where he says
[1:17:09] if you have eternal
[1:17:15] life not correcting nobody you're the
[1:17:18] one's correcting him cuz you're leaving
[1:17:20] off what he's
[1:17:21] saying you're coming with some kind of a
[1:17:23] doctrine that just makes you oh I just
[1:17:26] like I said Napoleon he's turn there
[1:17:27] with his hand I believe I was back there
[1:17:30] that's what everybody wants they want
[1:17:31] this thing back
[1:17:33] there I want this thing made Eternal
[1:17:39] amen if I don't believe that eternal
[1:17:41] life is a
[1:17:46] person it's not a thought or a
[1:17:50] concept I didn't get a knowledge
[1:17:53] one day that I
[1:17:56] saved I had met God I'd seen him and
[1:17:59] everything in the
[1:18:00] book Deacon for 5 years in the Baptist
[1:18:03] Church claiming salvation but when I
[1:18:06] heard that Prophet talking about eternal
[1:18:08] life and God being a person I
[1:18:10] immediately knew I didn't have the new
[1:18:13] birth and I didn't claim like everybody
[1:18:15] else that I came into the message so
[1:18:17] that proves I got eternal life I sought
[1:18:20] God for two
[1:18:21] years
[1:18:25] and I've had experiences to tell you
[1:18:27] things that a lot of people think you're
[1:18:29] just trying to make yourself something
[1:18:30] no I'm trying to tell the
[1:18:34] truth I've been in the presence of God
[1:18:36] so much I could smell his
[1:18:38] presence most wonderful smell you've
[1:18:43] ever but yet I don't call that my new
[1:18:49] birth read six books a day and listen to
[1:18:53] two
[1:18:54] tapes I don't call that my new
[1:19:01] birth I call the New Birth exactly what
[1:19:03] I believe it
[1:19:04] is Jesus said you must be born
[1:19:08] again and for you to be able to be born
[1:19:11] again I've got to go
[1:19:14] die you remember he breathed on the
[1:19:16] disciples and said receive you the Holy
[1:19:17] Ghost they didn't receive it right then
[1:19:20] and they'd walk with him for three and
[1:19:21] A2 years
[1:19:23] that was a promise that they had to go
[1:19:25] to the upper
[1:19:30] room well like I
[1:19:32] said come on Brothers like I
[1:19:37] said they was your scared to death in
[1:19:40] the upper room and they said we're not

[1:19:46] right they done seen too much go on and
[1:19:49] them disciples in that upper room that
[1:19:50] 120 they said we're not going going
[1:19:54] out but when that Holy Ghost
[1:19:57] fail that person of Jesus Christ come
[1:20:00] into their soul that's right they walked
[1:20:04] right straight
[1:20:05] out and being begin to declare the
[1:20:10] gospel wouldn't have scared of
[1:20:14] nobody Paul
[1:20:16] what beat three or five times with with
[1:20:21] enough Stripes if they give him one more
[1:20:22] according to the record it would killed
[1:20:23] him on each one and
[1:20:26] he's and yet all he could say
[1:20:29] was the life that I now
[1:20:32] live in this
[1:20:34] flesh I live by the faith of the Son of
[1:20:39] God it's not I that liveth but Christ
[1:20:42] that liveth in
[1:20:45] me he believed in a new
[1:20:51] birth I I don't believe the new birth is
