Romans 8 Genesis 1 remember the announcements that have been made and we just received a word this morning that are uh Charles Sims are which would be my nephew I guess he had a they said he had three heart attacks but I don't know we'll try to find out after the service or something and uh all but remember that and just pray to the Lord would touch him and remember the Bible study coming up this coming Saturday and pray the Lord would bless each one all right that's all announcements are recognize am I missing anything I generally do but anyhow we try to make up for it the heavenly father we thank you this afternoon for a chance to be able to come together that we could just take a little time out of our hustle and bustle and hurriedness of life and all Lord to be able to sit down and let you just speak to us and Lord just open our understanding because that's our desire more than anything else we pray that you'd bless each one remember the sick ones Among Us and the Lord touch each one remember Sister Ruth there Lord you know sister Anna Lord remember her and bring her on through this will be getting good reports that she's doing a whole lot better so we believe you father and we thank you for that and just bless her and nephew Lord Charles Sims and just be with him and help him thou Lord we know in this world there's no hope whatsoever then we are in bad shape we just got each one now Lord as we read your word and just bring your your thoughts onto us as you'd have us to talk about you guide us now forgive our sins keep us Lord in Jesus name we love you and we thank you amen and amen Romans 8. and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose for whom he did for no he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many Brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called in whom he called to me also justified in whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God be for us who can be against us I love that part don't you now let's turn to Genesis one 26. and God said let us make man in our image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fall of the iron over the cattle and over all the Earth and over ever creeping things that creepeth upon the Earth so God created man in his own image in the image of God created he him male and female created he them and God blessed them and God said unto them be fruitful and multiply and replace the Earth and subdue it and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the Earth amen and you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word really enjoyed that song sister Monique that was sitting back there thinking I guess when we first met them was about 19 and 93 I guess I know we did in 95 but I believe it was 93 and she was just a little little bitty thing and and uh I don't know at that time where Danielle was even born or not but I know it wasn't long after the end we got to meet the girls there and we've always enjoyed being with them they're just like our kids go there they were part of our family I got introduced when I was over there one time in the school and they wanted them to meet their their white granddaddy yeah so what you know I've been there when they graduated and things like that and they they introduced me around to everybody to you know who I was and I appreciate that amen now uh as we've done the other day we uh you know we've had company come in and I'm not the kind of a person that just goes right straight on when company comes I want to drop back and try to help them as much as possible and so we did there the other day we had company in so I preached my message and then I read my message the next service so I guess that's what we're going to do this afternoon is we preached this morning uh kind of the message and this afternoon we're going to read it and let brother random say it and that'll uh that'll help us all but I hope we're following a line or a thought and the thought even though it seems like we have moved over into other things but remember the thought is still how does God predestinate he predestinates by foreknowledge all right and then by foreknowledge he knew that you and I would want to be saved Joey would have it for us so he really predestinates according to the desires that you and I have that we desire salvation so he would have it ready for us but we've also gotten into the point now of not just um I want to caution you on this thought that our thoughts are not just running as a haphazard point of coming down um I don't know how to get that point in there but I'm trying to get you and I to look at something from the revealing of the Eternal God in his condescending and not to just see the see God coming down in his condescending and remember we've been over and over it to talk about him revealing himself and by him revealing himself then he would reveal us and what we are so keep the thought in your mind that remember that uh you know sure back before the foundation of world he foresaw all of these things and you know could predestinate by that foreknowledge and know that Jacob have I love but Esau have I hated but he would do that because he would know what they would desire but then now in dealing with the uh offspring of God the children of God because that's what we've been talking about is is the children of God and that way don't just put that as a Jacob and an Esau thought in your mind to hold a point you know that that well he just foresaw it and you know that's the way it's going to be or something you know get it in your mind the thoughts that we've been trying to bring is related to now in the basis of us being a part of God must be in The Offspring of God us being the children of God and we have to receive eternal life to be that we're we don't believe in this these doctrines in the message now that you come in the world with eternal life I believe you come into the World by representation of predestination yeah that God would know who would want eternal life and who wouldn't but just remember we're talking about eternal life in eternal life if we are the children of God we have eternal life all right now not that we would just be born naturally of it because we'll get to it after a while where the Prophet said that he breathed into the nostrils of Adam and he became a living Soul he said especially Adam eternal life he said now not what nature done see then the prophet is covering nature as being the life that you and I receive when we were born as children into the world we by Nature receive the life you know from God God's the only creator of life and bringing it but it's more or less by a nature well it's not just the nature of that nature of a nature no it's the nature that the fact that we would come into the world with Mortal life all right and then we'd have to be made Eternal because that way you wouldn't be coming into coming into the world with eternal life because we don't believe in eternal sonship see then that should annihilate the fact of people thinking that they come in the world with eternal life and I'm sorry the only thing that I'm saying to you is I don't believe that I believe you must be born again and that means you receive eternal life here but that eternal life you receive always was eternal and always was a part of God it's God's own life all right and that would bring it in because Jesus Christ wouldn't have to die if you believe in eternal sonship did you get that if you believe in Eternal sonship Jesus Christ don't have to die because you'd just be an eternal son and I don't believe that I believe you have to come through the stages and we will get to that later when we cover the on down through the message of the fall and and the things and seeing just what happened but just watch the point now that we're talking about not just God creating a family see that's what we we've had that thought in our mind that God just created a people and from that people he picked a family yeah well I don't believe it that way I believe God's family is his children and his children the eternal life that we have now always was eternal that's the children of God the children of God are not me and you right we we are the children of our parents brought into the World by Nature you know from natural act Etc and God's supplying a life to live in that human being until we would come to the basis of where we could receive eternal life and make a choice all right now there's another way we keep it to running into straight order so just don't lose me now in the thought if I don't keep referring to it sometimes the mind will drift off of what I'm trying to bring I'm still trying to bring because you'll see that this point this afternoon that we're talking about of let us make God in our own image that that one that was made there was not made like a creation you know just making something god making something no it's God himself unveiling how he comes into being amen all right see not just god making if God makes you a child then you you see foolish virgins will receive eternal life one day but that will not even make them the children of God that will make them with people with eternal life you could call them to Children Of God yeah because of them receiving it but they're not the bride of Christ the bride of Christ is part of God that's why to me it's so wonderful that we'll get to it later where that even in the message today don't lose the point that Adam and Eve Adam was made male and female all right but he was made that in the spiritual as well as the natural right okay now what it means you lost me well no no no I'm reading Bible the one that we read about is male and female created he them right right so then Eve has to be an atom and that's that's word that we have to hold it why because the bride is in Christ right remember we never come here within him and us he came here with us in him that's what I'm concerned about he he didn't come here in this little filthy garbage and he has to do a lot of work before he can use that okay now to try to pick up the thought then so we use this morning to lay down a reference back to our referring to what we've been talking about of God condescending down until he could be revealed and doing that he would do it in a way that would be marvelous you know and it could bring into being you say well I don't know about all this theophany logos it is that the other well we'll just let brother around him say it and then you'll be talking about him first but and see what I'm trying to get you to follow is a lineup of coming of God coming in to where he can be comprehended and this is the revealing of God this is not the god coming down he goes down here then he goes down here and he goes down here no see you got to express it but it's the condescending or revealing of himself as he comes downward to us for you and I to be able to understand him because how would we understand him as it used to be it's not been for the prophet of God and and God using him to express these things we had what the scholar said they had what they said they knew the wordings but it's just like Scofield he gets all of the things but then he turns out with an eternal sonship and he said he don't believe in and he turned himself you know but he brings it down as to being that see they couldn't get it together it took a profit for God to reveal his word to all right then following his line we can see where we're at and remember my point is it's not you and I coming into being that's only the part that goes with it it's God revealing himself as he comes into um eyesight spiritually speaking then we can comprehend him this is the revealing of God man all right then once you see it then you can see his offspring is a part of him so in this day if God is being revealed he's also going to be revealed in his bride and the prophet said she's the fullness of the godhead bodily like Masterpiece and like what is it the Mighty God unveiled that the bride will be the fullness of the godhead bodily all right but see we want it as trying to say the other night we want it at a point as to we try to make it we can draw out things there's no way to draw out because I told you nothing I'm not against anybody but I told you about the brother that had this drawing and had this thing made and he had lights and fixed and he had gone back here self-existing and then he just moved all of that over into here and he said there was the logos the theophany ETC the Creator and all and then he moved all of that over into Christ and then moved it into the bride well he just erased everything back there I don't see it that way if I'm wrong I'm wrong I'll tell you I just don't see it I see them that God moving over into another form enhances the form that he came from never how you want to say it it just makes that greater one because it's bringing into being this great one that's manifesting himself because like I said if you say oh brother Dale oh God was in Christ I've heard lengthy sermons don't have you and they say see that ain't none left of God because all God's in Christ what are you trying to do you say that sounds real good but now what about the next one when you say oh Christ in the church he doesn't done away with Christ with God and now you only got to church now that ain't what they're doing why you want to race out things have you ever heard him where it would keep increasing no it's always decreasing no I'm going the other way I want to go that way don't you you know how I go that away is for him to come this way if he don't come here we don't go there Rapture is not an automatic process of just we fly through the sky it's a group of people on Earth who realize who they are and what they're doing here and that God himself condescends but see when I make statements people say oh you're just doing it when it says all all of God put into Christ he's just done away with God then well the prophet said all and all means all well I just don't believe that one I believe all that God is going to reveal upon this Earth was in Jesus Christ but I don't believe that was all of God well can I quote the prophet he said he would give us a message of cheer down to the endless ages after this world was over with so evidently all of God is Not revealed down here I'd think about that but you see the all God is going to make known says together is made known Through the Bible to you and I but that doesn't finish God that only puts you and I into a position that we can understand God the veil will be lifted from her eyes and we'll see him as he is but what does the Bible say because we'll be like him that's what the scripture said but you see that's what I'm trying to get us to follow so don't lose that thought so as I said we preached this morning this afternoon let's read a little so the prophet of God brought it through and he told us that out of God he said came the logos the speech he calls it the Holy Spirit he calls it as theophany and he begins to say Let There Be in the world and all of the things are created and all of them are created as we said this morning by Jesus Christ so that must have been the form of God back there amen right was Jesus Christ not Jesus the flesh the Christ that's why when he asked Peter Peter never said you're you're Jesus he said who the man say hi to son of man now he said Thou Art the Christ he didn't say Jesus Thou Art the Christ it's because he knew different from that he knew to look at that flesh he's Nebuchadnezzar did and would say the son of God that would be fine but he wouldn't be looking at him as to see it in him as almighty God in the you know the form that's reflect it was another form so keep that in mind when the prophet of God said it's just God in another form he said it's part of God he said not like an arm going off you know or something like that he said it's a part of God the logos that came out from God was a part of God not a part like well brother Dale uh how much of that part came out was it two-thirds or was it a third or was it three quarters or was it just remember the way your Prophet expresses it he said one Speck of eternal life is just as much God as all as God he said like a spoonful of water out of the ocean is the same as the ocean he said it's just not the volume right all right so we're talking about Jesus Christ Colossians 1 John 1 Hebrews 1. and I say Ephesians 3 and 9 I see the letter James 3 and 9. we're talking about all that was created by Jesus Christ all right so who was that creator that stepped out and said let there be Jesus Christ why would you use Jesus Christ don't run around them dead and the main reason I do is because Jesus is the only name God ever had that is his name so is it any problem will say in his full name Jesus Christ because that's the only name God ever had the only name he has now is Jesus that's why you are not our Miss Jesus well I just don't know his name's god well now you're right back where we started at God is an object of worship right so now you've you went all the way around flocked back to where you was get it down and get it into right order and sometimes God will reveal itself from that because that's the only thing I can do all right now so we see the Halo of the light coming out and seeing to let there be we'll take that as being the Christ we'll take that as be in the Holy Spirit because the prophet will use it in a little bit and we'll talk about it as the theophany we'll talk about it as a logos we'll talk about that as God amorphy changing his form not another God the same God in another form all right you think about it the same God in another form and watch why the prophet will use these and you'll see why it'll come down to us the word theophany means the body of God is a springing this morning well wouldn't that be what came out the body of God step forth from God the logos would be the speech that would be in that body and it would all be the Holy Spirit but but you're just making him too real oh I'm going I wish I could make him so real until you'd scream at seeing how real he is you mean he created us and we think we're something real we're a product of him where did he get as the prophet said the sand and the dust and the stuff to make the world from right we can't make dust or sand we could take a rock and grind it up but you know what I'm talking about we can't create it but he could create he could bring it into being one of these days I might get brave enough to preach a little bit further on some of the things my brother Reynolds said the seed was laying in his Earth from another civilization or something you ever heard that quote and let's don't go into all them pre-existent worlds all right because that's in the doctrines of the land that other worlds was created more than just this and other people were created and all these planets out there has got the same thing going that's going on this one I don't believe it I believe this is the core this is it but just think about it now think about God condescending he comes down see to be the speech the logos and then he's at dire and bringing forth and he can speak he could speak and say Let There Be all right now as he would be coming down you realize that this is what I'm hoping you don't never lose since we got into it see that when he changed his form you started coming toward it was not just bringing itself forward he was bringing you forth amen but just remember the parties bringing you forward now it's not the body spirit so you're looking at it it's the eternal life that's within him that's why John says the seed remaineth in us and he cannot sin the prophet says we sin every day what is it it can't sin the seed that remaineth in us the god that lives within us is the one that cannot sin all right let's see watch it now as it he come down then you'll see we come down but not we as peoples or identities we're in him amen that's what I said did the prophet say that when Jesus Christ walked the shores of Galilee he said within him he said I was here when Moses crossed the Red Sea he said I was with Abraham well did it mean the dirt was off the ground not exactly so Jesus didn't come off of dirt come off the ground you come from the original where God said let there be in the world come into being he said let there be and a baby came into being in the womb of a mother not putting potassium calciums and stuff together a creation yep so then watching him condescending then we can see easily why he would say in Genesis that after it created the world after he created the the uh the things now I'm going to the one it's going to fall this way in this way so follow with me and listen it's odd that it comes over in the sixth day and then he speaks of let us make man but that was the natural man that we'll get to later of Adam this man that's being created here in Genesis 1 26 and 27 is not Adam it's Christ is Christ coming into big it's not Adam had a beginning Adam was a standing the prophet said with his feet tongue into the dirt standing there he said didn't God breathe into his nostril's eternal life into Adam but you remember one thing when you and I come into the world as babies there wasn't no breathing of eternal life the key to that is to understand what I've tried to say God never begins any creation as a baby Adam was a full-grown man the church started on the day of Pentecost as a full-grown Church Jesus Christ came as a baby to show what we were going to come as babies when he come to a full-grown man all right but see now as it comes to Genesis then think about it that the prophet of God said on the who's this Melchizedek will read the minute or maybe and there's about three quotes four that man was created on the sixth day that shouldn't be no argument even though you read it in Genesis and then you jump one and then you jump over to two and chapter two if you'll notice it says in verse 4 of chapter 2 these are the generations of the heavens and the earth when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heavens the generations in other words repeating what he had done it took chapter 1 to bring chapter 2 into being so now keep in mind what you're looking at the physical Man was created on the sixth day God rested the Sabbath that's what the Bible says all right but this man that we're talking about of let us make man in our own image that man had no beginning that man was created before the world ever was created we've been through all of that proving it coming down the Morning Star saying together and the sons of God shouted for joy then this man that we're talking about today in the image of God was not created on the sixth day amen the physical man of Genesis 2 was created on the sixth day Genesis 2 is a recap of what happened in the Genesis 1. all right now so we're going back still before the foundation of the world right we're still back tires you want to call it in the mind of God no we haven't been through that right to be in the mind of God means to be part of God Amen not something God thought of says what we think we think God's sitting there well I think maybe I might have kids no from any time of any thoughts you could have a concept in your mind of a God he had the attributes within him that's what your Prophet said he said he had the attributes of Savior healer before there was anything he never gained attributes coming this way he just displayed those attributes and it would come forth into a being as we call it and we dwelt on creation and being because we we knew that that's a concept in our mind when we see the word being or beginning that we think of nothing and then something in creation we think of whatever is creating it remember that's for the world and all the other things but this man I'm talking about in Genesis 1 26 and 27 they will try to prove from the prophet and no beginning he had no ending it's God himself and we'll get to it worth it we think well he just created Adam he didn't just create Adam in 126. he created Adam into over the second chapter all right that's the physical atom the first man Adam and Eve at no beginning no starting point because we're still talking about eternal life eternal life has no beginning In The Wind into it it can't it can't start so when you come to Christ you can understand we'll get to it it's in the notes here he said he didn't make man hey man if you'll notice in there he's actually really spelling it out that wasn't what he made in Genesis 1. he didn't make amen just like One Singular he made man and to show you that even our terminologies of life is when you say manned or mankind what does it refer to you don't have to say women right man or mankind refers to male and female right so God is right in his understanding he's going to make man not just a man singular he's going to make man all right then as he does then you can see that we we are coming into being at the same time he's coming in to be but the we that's coming in to be into eternal life you know us not us as people get that away from your mind no it's a spiritual creation so we'll let him do it let's go ahead and start now we're going to start about the middle of our notes these brothers had these notes for quite a while and you see what I've done with them but on the message guilty of sin and the penalty that caused to read Sin from our lives 53 403 we start in paragraph 51. all right 50 48 up to there is talking about the little Halo and the things you know and God coming forth we read them the other day and how the icebergs formed and caused Mexico caused the Great Cuts in the earth and the things coming down and how he's creating the world and then he covers it like this right at the lights then he created all creation and after he had made it all the trees come up the plants and so forth what a beautiful setting he had he loved it it was beautiful he thought it was fine all right now he's talking about the natural creation okay so we're starting here with another creation right so he couldn't just leave it in that state he had to leave something with it so he said let us plural make man plural in our own image let us make man in our own image so then God made his first man he was a spirit man what this is before the world now this is not Adam physical right right now not Adam physical not the flesh man this is a spirit man it was something on the order of God or the son of God the logos that was the first man and he gave the man dear jurisdiction over the to lead all the animal life just like the Holy Spirit leads a Believer today go here and do this and only if we could be perfect how much we could do all right now we go over to number six bypassing some of the notes that we used this is a message George the father and it'll satisfy us 53 16 e 65. and when he made everything that looked nice and good to him now he said let us rural make man plural in her own image what was he there is is a supernatural being now what's he doing there's the one that could not be seen come on now describing God describing us I know the same paragraph there's one that could not be seen God the father never was seen never will be seen you're not going to see that spirit you're going to see him like he is right he's all nature and there he is and now here's the son which is the logos that went out of him Made In His Image a supernatural being that went out in the beginning let us make manner our own image after after he'd made a man in his own image he made a supernatural being yes indeed Genesis 1 28. because there's where it comes over they're telling you to multiply and I told you now if you keep that correctly we're right you sisters have a right to carry the gospel the the word seed comes through the body right but you sisters even have a right to carry the gospel talk to your neighbors testify to them you know what you're doing we come into the World by spiritual multiplication right into the body of Christ by spiritual multiplication all right so that's why it goes into Genesis 1 20 8 because 128 goes from a natural from spiritual to a natural all right read it and see if that isn't right and then when he made man in his own image he had rule over the Beast he led the Beast around then like the Holy Spirit supposed to lead to church today that's right he led to church around him and then he said there's no man to till the soil you know he's getting to the next man it's two men so he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth you might give him a hand like a monkey and a foot like a Byron I don't know what he did but he put him into five senses now watch he put this supernatural being which was called man oh the third person of the trinity now we know he went no trinitarian what is it holy spirit into mankind what did he put into his Genesis 2 man what he created in Genesis 1 Man the supernatural being the Holy Spirit the Son of God the Lord gosh the one that was to lead the animals he put that finally into flesh right that's exactly right that man and he made him in his own image all right now he made him we talk about a trinity there might be a reason for him saying that in the third third person of the Trinity might be running to you and I but that's all right go ahead to the next one 6A who is God priest in 1950 815 the paragraph 8 20. and then we're going to make this second man now watch him the first man you can't see him God now I remember the other day when we were using it off of the message of Genesis question answers on Genesis paragraph 21 where he said God was his first creation and see that's kind of froze some of you on God was his first creation well he's not talking about creating something Iran's not talking about creating somebody's talking about something coming into being not a beginning not a doing it some God always was but his first creation was to look at him and see him as God see him at Elohim whatever we call him then he steps forth to become the logos speech speaking to us so now here he's back on it again now we're going to make this second man the first man you can't see him God second man was a Halo that's your logos theophany right going out of God the Holy Spirit and now he takes a third man and makes him like a little white cloud coming over we can see him Holy Spirit coming down right and he's all man that's the soul of man Eternal then first man is God can't be seen second man is the logos theophany Etc of the things we've read about it the third party's bringing man let us make man in our own image or on likeness let them have dominion over the Earth bring it down to what to that's that's the soul of man he says Eternal then that man that came out from God as the Genesis 123 whatever you want to do or argue or fuss about remember it was a spiritual man it was not a physical man it was a spiritual being it was the theophany the logos the Holy Spirit so the first man of the Genesis 1 26 man that man is the Christ amen amen there's only one Christ there's only one logos there's only one theophany he's going to wait just a minute now there's a theophany to the center that's what I'm talking about that's the body of a god he's going his way there's only one eternal there's only one eternal theophany there's only one Genesis 126 man and that's Christ amen there's how he was in God right that's how he was in God then we get marred we won't go through it we'll cover that in the next message but let's go on for just a little let's just think about this man listen to the things the prophet calls him in doing go ahead to the questions and answers on Genesis 53 729 paragraph 13. and they asked him a question what does this Genesis 1 26 have to do with Genesis 2 7. all right God created two men that's their question their thought and that's true and which was the man and which what connection does that have what how does it connect up in the scripture well if you'll notice close now in Genesis 1 26 let's get to first part first God said let us and let us us in is a let us make manner on image of course we realize he's talking to someone he's speaking to another being oh that's Trinity um I can show you where brother random said he's talking to the animals if you want that that's natural well would you ever think about maybe we were wondering how we were going to come it's up to you let us make man in our own image after our likeness and let them have dominion over the cattle to the field if you notice in creation the first thing that was created of course was light you come on down through the creation the last thing was created was what a man and the woman was made after the man all right the first last thing that was created of God's creation is mankind but when God made his first man if you notice he made him in the likeness of himself he was made in the image of God and that's what God is now and what God is now excuse me if you can find out what God is we can find out what kind of a man he made right right because you made a news image image means likeness and likeness there doesn't mean just as I said you take two identical twins June used to take care of two little girls I couldn't tell them apart they said after a while you can find a little bitty thing but I know regardless of the best could be there would be something somewhere that would not be totally identical because they are two different people you know all right but see image doesn't mean the words in your image that's fine but no we don't look exactly alike we're different heights we're different things that's not that word image and then Colossians you'll find out that he's the image of the invisible God all right God changed his form it says they're in Colossians we used the other day in the form of God see Jesus taught it not robbery to be equal to God you know why because he was God that's that's why I never thought robbery to be equal he was God he was in God's image he was in God's likeness you want to know what God looks like look at Jesus all right now so when you're getting down to that what are you doing you're going to come and bring man into being let's go on with this questions and answers on Genesis I got 43. you got all those things together and made all the other things all the animal life the birds the bees the monkeys and whatever it was put them all here on Earth and then he asked this question let us who father and son now that's who he's talking to while ago when he said speaking to another being father and son are you with me father was the great eternal could not be seen we read the quote another form comes forth called a son right oh gosh they offney Holy Spirit God in another form same God it's another form to reveal himself now he's coming to reveal himself in mankind in another form all right let us who Father and Son you want to call it word and spirit that's okay word can be here and spirit over here and they're not one right but when the word is revealed the word in spirit of one right so there's no problem with it there's no Trinity no secret coding so let us who Father and Son make manner their own image if a man was made something like that little sacred light Yonder or something like that it could not be seen all right which is a spiritual being he manifested or unfolded himself a little more to make a trinity of himself a father Son and Holy Spirit and here was God unfolding himself now down into now you probably thought of a long while ago when I was saying I'm talking about the coming forth to God so listen and I was God unfolding himself down into so the unfolding and this man coming forth is God himself no that was man God himself in another form called a man okay unfolding himself down into let us make man which was his son an offspring of him man in our own image he was a supernatural being and let him have dominion over the cattle of the field and so forth now the man LED that let the man led the cattle and everything just like the Holy Spirit leads a True Believer today the voice of God out of there whose voice was leading the animals Adam's voice as the logos theophany speech who spoke to the bull in this day God's voice to a man because the man that said it was brother Branham but the man that said it said if I'd have had my gun I would have shot that bull and went and paid for him you don't read them see the man that was standing there was a scared he'd have shocked above but he left his gun remember laying in the truck but something took over from inside of him and the bull obeyed that from inside right come on now the voice of God I was there the voice of man read it with speaking say call the cattle this way or call the Sheep over this faster call the Fish to this water see he had Dominion everything obeyed him noticed then there was no man to tell the soil Genesis 2 no man to till the soil and then God formed man Genesis 2 7 out of the Earth to the earth now we follow it he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth and put this Supernatural spirit he formed a man and then put that in him which if we have time we'll get down to that and he was laying there he said I got some pictures I can see Adam standing let's take this see him standing like a tree God had made him now he's talking about a physical body right he was dead as he could be he's told like the roots sticking in the ground and God said let there be or breathe the breath of life into him any jump came to life see him came to himself see he was a breather Breath of Life into him he became a living soul now he begins to move now you got the man in the garden that was in glory in the first creation you got him in physical creation and it's the soul of man shoulders a lot more to us than just well brother Dale I remember yeah I don't know what you remember you remember the two Soul Doctrine and I've told you before they couldn't even read I've heard it preached sermon after sermon the soul is just the nature of the spirit I want one quote from Brother random where it said the soul is just the nature of the spirit but around said the soul is the Nature's pure when they put the word just in there they're interpreted it as being something that it wasn't or just making the shoulders well it's just nothing it's just a soldiers to Nature it's just a flopping around it's just a nature soul is what you are amen thank God for Hebrews to divide between Soul and Spirit thank God for a prophet and a man that would even in his early Ministry sometimes interchange Soul and Spirit but when he would come into the life of his ministry he would deal with the soul as the inward part of man he didn't have to correct anything because he wasn't wrong I've been through that with you he always gave what three parts of man right he always gave the outside she takes feel smelling here no matter what he called it he gave the second Rim memory reason conscience Etc he called that Spirit he'd call that soul because that's the interchangeable word even of the Hebrew and Greek understanding of the word Soul and Spirit moved you got to see whether it's talking about the spirit of God or the spirit of man well see he always gave the center part of man one sense Faith or doubt so he was always correct he just had his wording in a different place but yet he was right in what he would be saying a lot of times one because he'd be referring to the real you your soul is more real than your body and your spirit you want scripture it's the soul that sinneth that shall die not the spirit of body the soul that sent us the scripture says shall die soul is what's going to be judged because that's the real you all right deep breath into him he began to move all right put this Supernatural in him all right you don't have to give the next one it's um paragraph 158 who is this Melchizedek Man was created on the sixth day just to where you won't have the the understanding and get lost in it that too is this male Chestnut Zoom down Man was created on the sixth day seven is God's number all right now let's think about something let's think about something he called this man we've read he called him the Holy Spirit he called him the logos he called in the spirit of God call him a son of God all right yep now look at the point of what he's talking about from Hebrews chapter 3 going to number nine somebody stop that clock paragraph 278. now the logos that went out of God which was the logos all this being deformed into a body shape and this body of shape was called in the scholars teaching logos the logos that went out of God in other words a better word for it was what we call it theophany the often is a human body that's glorified not as black or Flesh and Blood like it will be in the glorified state but it's in the form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink but it's it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one all right now in in Corinthians second Corinthians 5 I think it is we're talking of the theophany it says we have one waiting in Heavens eternal now do we have an eternal theophany up in heaven waiting on us to get there that's what everybody preaches everybody preaches I'm going one day to my theophany and they sing in songs you know not throwing off them sounds beautiful don't off on our understanding do we have an eternal theophany in heaven and we have eternal life in our soul what is the soul of man now if we can prove the soul of man is a theophany you go out of time together and remember I wouldn't have went and said it and brother Brandon wouldn't even know what said it the angel of the Lord speaking to him when he was beyond the curtain of time when the people were coming up he said this is what is written in the scripture sold under the altar the angel of the Lord could call them Souls it was there brother Bradham was there not in their physical body he was there in his soul Jesus Christ will read in a minute went to hell in his soul his theophany his logos he's person of his being well come back on the death Pentecost well the Holy Ghost came down amen what was that Holy Ghost we just read some quotes where the Holy Spirit the logos and the Son of God Was the Same so what came onto that Pentecost just remember the anointing came on Jesus on the River Jordan make it in the fullness of the godhead model him okay but remember that anointing left him in the Garden of Gethsemane that's what your Prophet said that was an anointing for his ministry but he still had to die to give up the holy ghost that was inside of him or his soul had to come out of his body to be able to come to you and I am en that's why anointed once can be anointed all right so let's think about it the logos that went out of God a bodily shape we'll call it the logos in other words a better word for it is we call it a theophany which is a human body that's glorified now he has no problem with Son of God logos theophany Holy Spirit do we do we know what the Plan of Salvation really is go ahead with the next one all right remember what he was saying about paragraph 70 at 278 this is 279 that followers to where we're just on 278. now when Man became into that body roll that down brother let's make sure you understand the connection between the two roll it back down just a little bit all right do you have needs a human body that's glorified not exactly reflection blood like we'll be in the glorified state but it is a form of a human body that doesn't eat neither does it drink beyond the curtain of time they did not eat and drink but they were their in bodies he could feel them they could talk to him that was the soul but it's a body a body that's waiting for us as soon as we leave this one now and there we enter into that body that's the kind of body that God was for he said let us make man in our own image and our own likeness and when Man became into that body theophany he had control of the fishes the fowls the beasts of the field and there was no man to till the soil Genesis 2. he done made the male and female but there's no man to fill the soil don't forget that he had done made male and female all right it made God made man out of the dusted the Earth he gave him a hand like a chimpanzee give him foot like a bar he gave him made him on the image and this Earthly body is in the image of animal life and it's made out of the same kind of material okay now look at what he's coming to made out of the same kind of material I'm trying to find it here it's made out of calcium potassium thing how the dusted Earth where it come from now look what he says but the difference between an animal and a man God put a soul in a man you remember this morning we were talking about the animal life couldn't atone for sin it could cover until Christ came but it couldn't eradicate sin when Jesus Christ gave me eradicated never between a man and an animal God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany the soul of man is your theophany he said but if it's up in heaven now the day I got born again I was right here wouldn't you but as far as God is concerned I was up here right yep as far as I was concerned not down here fooling me what is pulling me you get the new birth what is pulling you the positive of God's mind for you so if we have a soul that is eternal that soul is our theophany right right positive in God's mind is what's pulling us because we need Eternal out here and eternal life to Earth is pulling us he said well brother damn why not the Bible says if question number one were meaning something's got to happen to it dissolved meaning it's got to be destroyed if this Earthly Tabernacle be our word is off right death you did right you go right straight into the sixth Dimension right sold under the altar and how do you look amen right don't look 71. I'm glad of that hobbling around when he saw them they were in the prime of life but he calls it Souls on the altar the angel called it sold under the altar why would we have any trouble calling it Souls why would we have any trouble of finding and knowing that the word theophany means a body of God of a God or a deity and until we were born again you and I were serving the devil and we were on our way down he was our God Amen whether you like it or not but then the day he was born again you start an upward into Eternal theophany that theophany of that man is going down it's not eternal you can't make him an eternal sinner come on he's going down you and I were going down until we got born again are born from above in atonement this morning all right but the difference between a man and an animal God put a soul in a man he didn't put it in the animal because the soul that was in the man is that theophany all right now let's think a minute about let's see if we can get this part I don't know where to go this way or the other way we'll go this way look at the next one look at Blasphemous names 1962 1104 the morning service now but here Jehovah Witnesses in their book it says that the breath that you breathe is the soul and that cannot be right the breath that you breathe is not soul if it is you're one time you're one kind of Soul next time you're somebody else has breathed that soul look where you'd be now the breath is the wind and the wind is what you breathe into your nostrils now they take the scripture from God breathes breath into the nostrils and he became a living Soul see they take the scriptures to try to prove their point right now I want to ask you something if he was a man what kind of a breath was he breathing before God breathed and he breathed his breath of life into him see what kind of a breath he was a breathing living man well then if that be so then every animal is a living Soul cause they breathe a human soul see they breathe in and out in and out so it all be so in our soul and and all together then Jesus wouldn't have to had wooden have to die have had to die me the animal sacrifice would have been sufficient if you were just breathing in and out if that's all it is to it but what God did he breathed the breath of eternal life now we're coming to Adam for just a moment because we've got to tell that soul in with Adam and think about him he breathed the breath of eternal life amen then he became a living Soul a soul that cannot die and watch now we're going to get into honey Plum up to around the elbows notice breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils he breathed eternal life into Adam but not another child after then one of course the fall came and remember when he breathed the breath of eternal life into Adam Eve was still in Adam right okay watch what happened to him breathe the breath of eternal life into his nostrils and he became an eternal son or any kind of Soul excuse me because God breathes not what nature done what God did breathe into the breath of life into his nostril and he became a living soul and you say to me Adam died brother Branham no no but remember before Adam died he had a lamb that redeemed him Hallelujah those who before knew he has called he got a lamb to redeem that he was a top Adam fell then the lamb was provided for Adam because already in his nostrils had become the breadth of the Eternal God so there was no way to let him die you know what I mean annihilated there was no way to annihilate Adam he already had eternal life in his soul and when brother random gets in the seal book and he says you fell from eternal life well and just remember he's just explaining here you can't die if you have eternal life that Soul can't die physically we can die so what happened to Adam he died naturally because the prophet said his youth was being renewed in the garden he wasn't Eternal in body he was only Eternal and soul so when the prophet said he fell from eternal life he fell from eternal life eternal life was right there the tree of life I've got the notes written already the Tree of Life was in the garden and Adam and Eve could have ate that tree but instead the head of the tree of knowledge all right now watch an allowance provided for Adam because already in Austin he'd become the breadth of Eternal of the Eternal God and he became a living Soul he was the son of God now his breath is the African word I don't know what the Greek word is for it right now but the African word they called it a Moya which means the wind an unseen Force animal Breeze Memorial Sinners breathe the more you then why would we struggle for eternal life if that's the Eternal Soul breathe into us by breath why would we seek after eternal life if we come into the world with eternal life let me put that there amen if we're like the people in the message teach we come in the world with it eternal life why are we seeking eternal life that only makes sense you see see he said it backfire why would we struggle for eternal life get back for his brother it it just can't do it but God especially upon Adam where the breath of eternal life and he become an eternal person with God he had power with God he was an amateur God he was God of the earth not God Of Heaven now God of the Earth and someday the sons of God will begin become Gods Jesus said so is it is not it written in your law your gods and if you can call these who he called God God visited how can you condemn me saying when I say I'm the son of God how can you condemn Jesus for doing that but into Adam he breathed the breath of eternal life why would we struggle for life if we have it let's read one more then we'll quit I'll pick these up Wednesday go ahead with number 11. I'll get the rest of them Wednesday this is Hebrews chapter 4 57 901 paragraph 229. just think of it as our two eternal life he's asking the question is there two Eternal lives you couldn't answer that could you there is one eternal life so if you have eternal life here and you have eternal life that are be careful if you come into the world with eternal life and you're seeking eternal life be careful you come in the world lost and re seek and eternal life we gotta hope right then Jesus Christ didn't have to die in vain if it's something you breathe in breathe out if that's all a soul is then why struggle for eternal life think on these things you couldn't answer that could you there's one eternal life and that's the life of God this other kind of life no matter what it is it's got an end to it anything had a beginning had an end with anything that had no beginning has no end and God said he would give us eternal life without beginning we were just made a part of him how much have I been on that right and actually the life that in US wasn't brought here by human nature nature gave us a spirit but that Spirit died and we got the spirit of God glory to God was God a man certainly let us make man in our own image what was God a theophany a body and our man was made like that and put over the garden but there was no man to tell the soil in the senses then he created man Out of the Dust of the Earth in the animal and that man till the soil the man fell by transgression correctly and God the theophany come down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem the man all right what about it then what image was the first man that have made an image of God when was he created created there was no creation it was when God began to bring into view his plan of redemption and before he even started the plan on Earth which deals with foreknowledge he already shows what he's going to do just as he already said all names were written in the last book of life before the foundation of the world just as he'd already covered the morning Stars sang together sons of God shouted for joy here's a quote we'll get to I got a little note on it I already have some quotes laying the first thing God created was what angels the first thing human beings Are Not Angels he never created us as we use the word creation see he never created us eternal life is not a creation it can't begin and it came in see where we get tied up in creation and beginnings and things and we lose the whole concept of eternal life man was made in the image of God before the world ever begun then in Genesis 2 he was put that man was put into that human flesh and when he did he breed into Adam's nostrils because it wasn't anybody else there is a doctrine that God created more people than Adam and Eve I don't agree with it but there wasn't nobody there but Adam so now are you going to deal with Eve we've got to bring her into being she's a special being yes amen how are you going to bring her in to be well just make her some kind of slop jar where she can get us all into sin I would hold that quote if I was you until we read a few things brother Branham says about how that Eve came in to be and how that she was like the church the bride all right I wouldn't throw off on Eve too much he finds everybody we know what happened we know what took place but he didn't make her a slop jar to be able to bring this thing of redemption into being if he had he would have made her from a separate piece of soil when he made her from the same piece of soil of Adam and then we'll read where brother random said Eve was in Adam in theophany there's no written record as we would say it in the Bible that God breathed into Eve nostrils she become living soul what had already been said about her while she was in Adam so you know what's going to happen to Eve you know how brother Dale believes it at least that he believes that when Eve come from Adam God just took part of that 126 man and put it right over into Eve in a beautiful creation what do you think about it God created us in His image listening I'm staying closing out with it just like it says in Colossians that Jesus was in the very image of God now what does that mean thought it not robbery to be equal to God he was the image of God what does that mean well he was just like him over here when he was over here just like him with you no it was the same God or your trinitarian and it were the children of God then we're the same God made manifest are you a trinitarian steel and you're hooked up on a doctrine that the denominations got called eternal sonship we don't believe that but we believe in eternal godship but now brother Dale you're just making us too much the prophet of God said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for come on brothers so she'll be gone well while we've been around here so long brother Dale we haven't realized who we are we haven't believed Who We Are and let me just say this way you're going to think I'm exalted anyway go ahead how many have you ever heard it talked from where you come from in the churches you come out of the way it's being taught now oh yeah brother Sean stroke said we was children of God well they talked out in the Baptist Church when we talked out in the Baptist Church because we could read the Bible how many people have ever tried to get you to see what you really are you're not a creation of God your God himself in creation called as children of God Sons and Daughters of a living God as God made manifest in another form called a son think on these things listen what do we got the ring to get unto him anybody have a need yeah three together unto him the Gathering of the Peace we are again three and Praises unto him let us live
