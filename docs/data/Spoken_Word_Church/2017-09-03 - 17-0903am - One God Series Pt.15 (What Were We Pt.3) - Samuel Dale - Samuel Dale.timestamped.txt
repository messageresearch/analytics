[9:17] just have your way in Jesus name we've
[9:23] been on this for quite a while the Lord
[9:27] willing to kidding while ago the Lord
[9:30] willing Aaron will be ministering
[9:32] Foresters coming Wednesday and we may
[9:35] have to put him a shirt on one side he's
[9:38] gonna have a tie told him we'd hold him
[9:40] and put that on him but you know because
[9:43] his arm and all messed up but we'll fix
[9:46] him up some way he may be preaching in a
[9:48] short sleeve shirt but it'll it'll be
[9:51] all right then you know that shouldn't
[9:53] hinder his voice as long as it don't get
[9:55] to twisting his arm okay cuz that'll
[9:58] that'll take care of it okay John 1 in
[10:03] the beginning was the word and the Word
[10:06] was with God and the Word was God the
[10:08] same was in the beginning with God
[10:11] all things were made by him and without
[10:14] him was not anything made that was made
[10:16] in him was life and the life was a lot
[10:20] of men and the light shyness in darkness
[10:22] and the darkness comprehended it not
[10:26] let's go to Genesis because we can we'll
[10:29] try to complete this part not the series
[10:34] but the part that we end of trying to
[10:37] talk about being back tyre and what it
[10:40] was and whatever thing is Genesis 1:26
[10:43] and God said let us make man in our
[10:47] image after our likeness and let them
[10:50] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[10:52] and over the fowl of the air and over
[10:54] the cattle and over all of the earth and
[10:56] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[10:58] upon the earth so God created man in his
[11:01] own image in the image of God created he
[11:04] him male and female created he them you
[11:09] may be seated the Lord at his blessing
[11:12] to the reading of the word now trying as
[11:20] I said to carry that thought home
[11:21] because what have we been talking about
[11:24] we've been talking about before the
[11:27] foundation of the world and what was
[11:30] going on and what was taking place and
[11:32] and all like that come on the end
[11:34] brother
[11:35] did you see come on their seats over our
[11:39] visitors they're with us they're not
[11:42] visitors they've been here before over
[11:47] there it's good to have you brother
[11:49] alright but we've been trying for quite
[11:52] a while now brother Branham speaks a lot
[11:55] about especially in the later part of
[11:58] this ministry about the fact of who we
[12:02] were what we were what was happening
[12:05] before the world because we could read
[12:08] the Bible and we could comprehend some
[12:12] things but we just couldn't follow it
[12:15] and we would read how that job would say
[12:19] where were you when the morning stars
[12:20] sang together and the sons of God
[12:23] shouted for joy
[12:24] we know that that was happening you know
[12:27] back before time began alright and then
[12:30] we would read in the scripture you know
[12:33] how that all names were written in the
[12:36] book of the life with a lamb that was
[12:39] slain before the foundation of the world
[12:41] all right so that's what we've been
[12:44] dealing with now for quite a while is
[12:46] back before the foundation of the world
[12:49] before anything begin to come into being
[12:51] of humanity or life or or anything that
[12:56] there was something going on the said
[13:00] joke says that they were the morning
[13:02] stars were shouting the sons of God
[13:05] morning stars were singing the sons of
[13:07] God were shouting for joy and we know
[13:10] that the stars are the angels and see
[13:15] then we know the Bible says that the
[13:17] angels are ministering spirits made to
[13:21] be to helpers to were the heirs of the
[13:25] kingdom alright so then they would be
[13:28] back down at that point and they would
[13:31] be understanding things and they would
[13:34] be rejoicing and this is not a Jehovah
[13:37] Witness doctrine or a to soul in the
[13:42] message parts or or whatever it's the
[13:45] truth that before the foundation of this
[13:48] world
[13:48] go ahead in his mind and he saw all the
[13:52] things they would ever transpire upon
[13:55] the earth if not what kind of a God do
[13:58] you have see you don't limit your God
[14:01] because if you just put it well he don't
[14:04] know this he don't know that then who
[14:06] are you really you don't realize but
[14:08] that's the devil in you trying to get
[14:11] you the worse of him because you're
[14:14] running your own ideas and opinions
[14:16] well that just don't work too good now
[14:19] you said yeah but I believe the Lord
[14:20] will see the Lord is not going to be
[14:22] contrary to his word now there's no way
[14:25] to for him to be that way all right
[14:28] see then we believe that we were not
[14:32] human beings back there the Mormon
[14:37] doctrine
[14:38] pre-existence was that we were souls
[14:42] they called it and then made us people
[14:45] before the world and they had the idea
[14:48] that we would want to come to earth and
[14:51] serve our Father and things you know and
[14:54] as they would do that they have people
[14:57] back there well we don't believe in
[14:59] something like that
[15:00] now I don't believe in pre existence of
[15:03] those things I believe in pre existence
[15:06] of eternal God right but not pre
[15:09] existence of people as any form of
[15:13] identities that we would be there you
[15:16] know of people running around or
[15:18] whatever it is so I we've been talking
[15:21] about that the Bible said that we were
[15:24] chosen in him before the foundation of
[15:27] the world
[15:28] all right see then the only one back
[15:32] there with him he was self existing he
[15:36] was the word Elohim which means self
[15:38] existing and he existed alone but he
[15:40] existed along with his thoughts his
[15:43] attributes all right and if you're a
[15:46] child of God today you're an attribute
[15:50] of Almighty God which means you're a
[15:52] child of God I've tried to drive that
[15:55] hard to us if you are a child of God
[15:58] then the eternal life you now have
[16:01] always was eternal but there was a time
[16:05] we didn't have it Jesus Christ had it
[16:10] all in him and that's where we were
[16:11] chosen in him all right then he would
[16:14] have to come to earth to give his life
[16:17] to release that part of him that could
[16:20] come into you and I'd make us then
[16:22] eternal all right but we don't believe
[16:25] in sin what I always was eternal well
[16:28] I've got where the Prophet said that
[16:29] well praise God I got where the Bible
[16:32] said he's done good no not one quote -
[16:36] you know you know Jesus don't don't run
[16:40] off with it
[16:41] listen to us say it and think about it
[16:46] if you have eternal life today if you
[16:51] don't have eternal
[16:52] you're not born again you're not a child
[16:55] of God me that's where people don't
[16:57] understand when Jesus was sowing the
[17:00] seed back there in the when he was
[17:04] preaching he was sowing the seed of the
[17:06] kingdom which were the children of God
[17:09] all right but those children had to come
[17:11] into human flesh and then had to receive
[17:15] eternal life to make that into a full
[17:18] manifestation to her that we would be
[17:22] right it's not that we come into the
[17:24] world with eternal life if we did I
[17:27] asked this one simple question I always
[17:29] have you think you come into world with
[17:32] eternal life then why did Jesus have to
[17:33] die what's the purpose of Jesus Christ
[17:37] so you're denying the Scriptures you're
[17:41] getting out of it or the Bible would say
[17:43] you're born in sin shapen in iniquity
[17:47] I know it's two or three Scripture is
[17:49] putting into the thought but you're born
[17:51] in sin shape it in iniquity and the
[17:54] spouse from your mother's womb a liar
[17:57] that don't look like too good of eternal
[18:00] talk doesn't and we don't want to get
[18:02] into those thoughts of mankind that's
[18:05] their business but we do want to talk
[18:08] about us talk about you and me before
[18:17] the foundation of the world we wasn't
[18:21] back there as some form of people so
[18:26] that's out of the way but we were back
[18:28] down in God's mind and I've told you to
[18:35] be in the mind of God it's a wonderful
[18:37] thing but remember at the same time he
[18:40] thought of Jesus he thought of Judas
[18:42] Judas was in his mind everybody in the
[18:47] world was in his mind all right now if
[18:51] that be true then I don't want to just
[18:54] be in his mind so I've conned the phrase
[18:59] apart I don't want to be in his mind I
[19:01] want to be a part of his mind
[19:04] Paul didn't say well I want to be a part
[19:08] of his mind and maybe Paul said it's
[19:12] Christ in you the hope of glory see then
[19:19] to believe in eternal life but to
[19:24] believe it correctly as a mute it's a
[19:26] marvelous thing wonderful
[19:29] Oh situation to me because mankind is
[19:33] always wondered about us where we come
[19:36] from what are we what is this what is
[19:39] that and they've come up with all kind
[19:42] of ideas well see we believe that God
[19:47] sent a prophet to straighten out mankind
[19:50] but mankind ain't gonna listen but it
[19:53] was still sinned they will be judged by
[19:57] what has been taught in this life days
[20:00] and we as a five fold ministry is to
[20:03] take that message and deliver it down to
[20:06] the laity because that's our job in our
[20:09] position and that's all I'm trying to do
[20:11] all right so do you follow me then that
[20:16] we read in the beginning was the word
[20:19] the Word was with God and the Word was
[20:21] God
[20:22] oh look at our with with with takes two
[20:24] or three of them but didn't go and read
[20:26] it and he said in God they said in the
[20:29] word we don't believe in know two or
[20:34] three gods we believe in one true and
[20:38] living God okay then the seeing it
[20:42] you'll have to bring it down as we will
[20:44] the Lord willing
[20:45] maybe next Sunday as to get into the
[20:49] creation and see that Jesus Christ
[20:53] according to the scripture John one
[20:56] closer one Hebrews one James three nine
[20:58] that Jesus Christ created all the time
[21:04] the father didn't create unless you
[21:08] believe it correctly you believe that
[21:10] Jesus was the father made manifest in
[21:13] another form right
[21:16] you believe it Dunaway then you tie it
[21:18] all together all right but getting down
[21:20] to a point to try to understand so we
[21:26] brought these statements out like the
[21:29] profit off of God reaching his mercy he
[21:33] said there was some part of you back
[21:36] there
[21:37] well that's pre-existence not if you
[21:42] think about what was back there if he
[21:45] was self-existing right then the only
[21:51] way you could be a part of it would be a
[21:53] part of him
[21:54] on the way you could ever think about
[21:56] being anything back there would be a
[21:58] part of God not to try to think that
[22:01] we're little people's are we were this
[22:03] or what war-weary back there were we
[22:05] floating around where we spirits were
[22:07] with he said no you were nothing
[22:13] see it's not he said on who's this
[22:16] melchester he said not your being here
[22:19] not of this now he said well we don't
[22:24] believe you don't but I remind you that
[22:26] ever doctrine relates back and will lead
[22:32] you to the flesh that's enough listen
[22:39] not our being here but the part of God
[22:44] if you have eternal life the eternal
[22:48] life you have as a part of God right the
[22:52] truth if you have eternal out the parts
[22:55] you have it's a part of God all right
[22:56] that was before the foundation of the
[22:58] world because he had attributes he never
[23:01] gained attributes coming into the world
[23:03] he displayed attributes he never become
[23:07] a savior he always was a savior there
[23:10] was nothing lost to be saved that
[23:13] doesn't do away with the fact that he
[23:15] was a savior that was what brought it
[23:17] out into the open or brought it forth
[23:20] was the things that was within him no
[23:25] desire to being a healer a savior a
[23:28] redeemer a father
[23:30] son Holy Spirit anything you want to
[23:33] bring was a part of God before the world
[23:36] and he just brought it into this play he
[23:39] said how do you know because he's here
[23:41] right
[23:43] he made his self manifest Jesus Christ
[23:47] come to be the fullness of the Godhead
[23:49] bodily
[23:52] and then he would sow the seed of the
[23:56] kingdom of the children of God and then
[24:00] it would wait till the day of Pentecost
[24:02] where the Holy Ghost to give life to the
[24:04] seed and so is the same with you and I
[24:08] when we receive the new birth it gives
[24:11] life to the seed that you've received
[24:13] cuz remember a seed without moisture
[24:17] there's no good when they dug into the
[24:21] some of those tools and the egypt's and
[24:23] the things like that they found grain in
[24:26] there that had been our four thousand
[24:27] years it didn't have any moisture so it
[24:33] wouldn't live they took it out and put
[24:35] the moisture to it what happened the
[24:38] life was in the grain but it had to have
[24:40] the moisture see all right so then I do
[24:43] not believe the statements that a lot of
[24:45] people are doing in the message today or
[24:47] saying I always was eternal well that's
[24:52] your business
[24:53] alright now in doing that see I believe
[24:59] that the part of God that you are is
[25:03] that new birth all right everybody clear
[25:05] on that I don't want no
[25:07] misunderstandings because it's easy to
[25:10] misunderstand the wording see the
[25:13] eternal life you have now the Prophet
[25:17] said if you have eternal life you always
[25:22] was eternal now what's the point
[25:26] well I just see it right dart said I
[25:28] always was eternal no you're not reading
[25:32] the rest of the message if you have
[25:35] eternal life the you you're not
[25:39] realizing you're making eternal sinners
[25:41] out of it and I thought we're supposed
[25:43] to be against that
[25:44] I thought was supposed to be the
[25:46] believing that we had to be borned again
[25:49] it wasn't something we come up with as I
[25:52] said in the other day then we come up
[25:53] with an idea or our concept that God
[25:56] just give us a little knowledge of who
[25:58] we are no they wouldn't two months
[26:01] giving a little knowledge when he died
[26:03] on the cross who released his life that
[26:06] that life could come back in you and me
[26:08] to give us eternal life see there's no
[26:12] eternal life outside of Jesus Christ
[26:14] without side the new birth is no eternal
[26:17] life even those at the white throne that
[26:20] will be given eternal life will never be
[26:23] part of the body of Christ because
[26:28] that's just an impartation to it you
[26:33] don't realize what it means to be a
[26:34] child of God like I severing the other
[26:37] day see Jesus said I chose you you
[26:41] didn't choose me remember in John but
[26:47] Paul turns around in Ephesians and said
[26:51] that we were chosen in him I asked you a
[26:57] simple question did you choose your
[27:01] children no you just got married and
[27:07] they come right you didn't choose them
[27:12] I've heard people say you know I don't
[27:15] know how though surely cut I'm afraid
[27:16] they might not be a true seat of God
[27:18] well now that says very carnal and very
[27:21] unacceptable to God in His ways why
[27:24] can't we believe and I quote brother
[27:26] around him he said if you don't have
[27:30] enough faith for your children he said I
[27:33] doubt you having enough faith for your
[27:36] self so if you can't believe your
[27:41] children and believe forum then you're
[27:43] not believing for yourself and you're
[27:45] not letting Christ being you remember
[27:47] they said the scripture says their
[27:49] pouted and if these we were chosen in
[27:51] him before the foundation board
[27:58] he didn't pick and choose
[28:02] he didn't just choose his children out
[28:05] of look into the world so I'll take that
[28:06] and I'll take it and I'll take I don't
[28:07] think missing it no he just had children
[28:11] I like to write my own self notes and
[28:15] read them sometime you know God never
[28:20] chose you to be a part of him are you
[28:27] listening he never chose you to be a
[28:29] part of him if we are his children
[28:33] we are him right not just being a part
[28:40] of him they say well you know he chose
[28:46] me I'll agree with you huh but just
[28:50] remember everybody that was ever saved
[28:58] or ever will be saved
[29:00] God knew it before the foundation of the
[29:05] world right okay so he knew the foolish
[29:12] virgins so you can say the food is
[29:14] virgins always was eternal same category
[29:21] puts you him alright now you say I come
[29:26] with it in me what did the foolish
[29:31] virgin come with it in them goes they'll
[29:33] eventually receive eternal life you
[29:36] agree you agree that they're gonna get
[29:38] eternal life somewhere Quattro and be a
[29:41] lot of people giving eternal life at the
[29:43] white throne
[29:43] did they come into the world with it in
[29:45] them no he didn't either
[29:50] we came into the world with one little
[29:51] thing a representation from
[29:54] predestination a representation from
[30:01] predestination alright remember then
[30:05] what comes first for knowledge or
[30:07] predestination according to the Bible
[30:10] those who he for
[30:11] oh and if they knew that I said four no
[30:16] because it's emphatically stating it
[30:18] those who before no he did predestinate
[30:23] so where were you going with it whatever
[30:25] you think about before the world
[30:27] remember you got to back up into his
[30:29] foreknowledge which means you're going
[30:31] to back up into his mind before the
[30:34] world and that's all I've tried to get
[30:37] us to say but yet the Prophet will make
[30:42] statements they sound like this that or
[30:50] the other but remember we used to read
[30:54] Matthew 28:19 and we read acts 2:38 and
[30:58] we said that was a contradiction till we
[31:06] found out the only way you can baptize
[31:09] anybody in the name of the Father and of
[31:12] the Son and the Holy Ghost because
[31:14] there's no name there the only way you
[31:17] can do that is in the name know Jesus
[31:19] said in the night the name of the Lord
[31:22] Jesus Christ now you got it correct
[31:26] there's not a contradiction the prophet
[31:29] or say you always was eternal then you
[31:34] know say you begin eternal out right
[31:35] here at the altar I sound like a
[31:38] contradiction doesn't it but it's not
[31:40] it's explaining the truth right here's
[31:44] where you get it you get eternal life by
[31:48] accepting Jesus Christ okay now to get
[31:53] to the point see then it's not our being
[31:59] it's the part of God that you're dealing
[32:01] with so in I've emphasized it over and
[32:05] over if you're chosen in him it's not
[32:08] the facts of whether I've chosen that's
[32:12] not the point
[32:14] see we want to make it all this way we
[32:16] say well I chose him the prophet of God
[32:19] said what that you say you accepted
[32:23] Jesus Christ as your Savior was
[32:25] has he accepted you you know that a lot
[32:31] of people are still on the basis I ask
[32:34] God to save me
[32:35] he's gotta save me but what if he didn't
[32:40] choose what if he didn't accept you what
[32:43] if he didn't accept your prayer what if
[32:45] your prior was a young a prior of
[32:48] demanding him to do something instead of
[32:52] asking him to do it there's a lot of
[32:55] difference in it right oh we would I can
[32:59] scriptures are where it says commands
[33:01] you me the Bible says that where are you
[33:05] gonna go out and command God to do
[33:06] something help yourself
[33:10] no you're dumb stupid but help yourself
[33:14] you're not gonna do that
[33:16] you're gonna ask him to keep his word
[33:19] and then by him knowing his word is true
[33:22] he'll come on the scene and fulfill his
[33:25] word that's not you demanding him that's
[33:29] you asking him to fulfill his word and
[33:33] he does it
[33:34] let's see well I can quote the scripture
[33:36] says yeah
[33:37] yeah when I said one scripture says none
[33:40] good no not one the other one said be
[33:42] therefore perfect or the contradictory
[33:45] no but our mind sure is alright now
[33:49] listen
[33:50] so we have to be a part of him to talk
[33:54] about anything before the world
[33:57] morado we seven that problem to think of
[34:00] anything about you and me whatsoever in
[34:03] any relationship of anything is to start
[34:08] off by thinking if we're a part of him
[34:15] then you see like I said where Jesus
[34:18] standing there to Mary and he said I go
[34:24] to my father and your father he said I
[34:32] go to my god and your God
[34:37] because we're the children of God the
[34:42] only thing that could be before the
[34:43] foundation of the world was God and his
[34:46] offspring his children well that makes
[34:51] people back garden oh I don't because
[34:54] you're not getting it says you're chosen
[34:55] in him so it's not whether or not he
[34:58] chose me
[34:58] it's where he so Jesus Christ and we
[35:02] know he did that now that solves a
[35:04] problem right we know he accepted him
[35:07] but when did he accept him simple point
[35:14] I keep trying to pull your mind by when
[35:16] did he accept Jesus Christ well they
[35:22] come on the cross not do that that's not
[35:24] according to the Bible according to the
[35:27] Bible he accepted what was happening at
[35:31] Calvary anything before the world ever
[35:34] begun right so now all we got to do is
[35:39] find out if we can be a part of him
[35:42] that's the whole key to salvation it's
[35:47] not philosophies and ideas
[35:49] it's whether we are the children of God
[35:51] or not and how did we become a child of
[35:55] God thank sent in Jesus Christ as our
[36:01] Savior then it proves whether you was
[36:07] before the foundation world not Bakker's
[36:11] people in him I spent years trying to
[36:18] preach to you want Elohim means what
[36:23] self-existing there was a time that the
[36:26] probably said God dwelt alone nothing
[36:30] with him before anything ever happened
[36:32] that he dwelt alone he was self existent
[36:34] within he just slides and a thought and
[36:38] he said he dwelt alone with his
[36:42] attributes
[36:48] so we he didn't he didn't become father
[36:52] he wasn't the father back there my
[36:56] wouldn't if he had that attribute in it
[36:58] he had the attribute as a savior why
[37:01] wasn't he a savior there was just
[37:03] nothing to make it manifest it was not
[37:06] needed at the time you realized then
[37:12] that if we believe that we are the
[37:19] children of God that part of God that
[37:24] lives within us was before the
[37:27] foundation of the world then you got it
[37:31] in the right order see part of him part
[37:37] of his being all right are you sitting
[37:43] on that partner that we were in him or
[37:50] will never be in him so we think he had
[37:54] children as they come forward no no his
[38:02] children were a part of him before the
[38:03] world ever begun or else they never will
[38:06] pay why don't we get that settled but
[38:11] it's like I said to you over and over
[38:12] this is where I I differ with biggest
[38:16] fortunes of people and I differ with it
[38:18] because I know I do it myself but you
[38:21] see we don't read the Bible for what it
[38:24] says we don't read this message for what
[38:28] it says we read it for what we want it
[38:31] to say we want to interpret what is
[38:40] saying well according to my Bible it
[38:43] says the Bible is of no private
[38:45] interpretation
[38:46] now that doesn't even give a prophet a
[38:48] right to interpret the interpretations
[38:50] gotta come from God himself
[38:53] through the profit right okay but he's
[38:56] only on that vessel it's not his ideas
[39:00] it's what God say it try to go back to
[39:03] it when Jesus said repeat every one of
[39:07] you you know or said for you to be
[39:11] baptized of the name of the Father and
[39:13] the Son and the Holy Spirit Catholics
[39:17] say we do that to the letter physically
[39:23] speaking they do the letter but now you
[39:28] mean to tell me that Jesus would say and
[39:35] mean that you're supposed to be baptized
[39:37] father son Holy Ghost and then Peter 10
[39:42] days I think it is from the time those
[39:44] statements was made was a very short
[39:46] time and they asked Peter said well
[39:48] unless we do to be safe now what was
[39:53] your done remember there was 11 of them
[39:56] there that was darned by the time he's
[39:58] happily Matthias was already put in he
[40:01] probably a confident one great a lot but
[40:03] they was tenant Lee standing there and
[40:06] Peter gets up and says repent everyone
[40:09] and be baptized the name of Jesus Christ
[40:11] well now why didn't John say hold it you
[40:16] didn't say what Jesus said Jesus said
[40:22] father son Holy Ghost
[40:25] why didn't want her to disciples correct
[40:28] the other one because they knew they
[40:31] what he was a saying was exactly right
[40:34] the only way you can baptize in the name
[40:37] of the Father and the Son and all ago
[40:39] need to be baptized in the name of the
[40:41] Lord Jesus Christ
[40:43] that's simple plain but it's right right
[40:47] they all right see then we believe that
[40:50] that's why we baptize out of what and
[40:53] you come next Sunday you hear me say
[40:54] this because I believe the prophets
[40:57] message and I like the way he said
[40:59] things so you are known I'll show you
[41:01] where he said it he said the way i
[41:03] baptize is to say to
[41:06] fulfill the great commission of Jesus in
[41:09] Matthew to baptize in the name of the
[41:12] Father and of the Son and the Holy
[41:15] Spirit I now baptize thee my brother and
[41:17] sister in the name of the Lord Jesus
[41:21] Christ he said the devil can't argue
[41:24] with you because you got both scriptures
[41:29] lined up together his reason he can't
[41:32] argue with you
[41:32] you take one by itself the other side of
[41:36] argue one by several other side of argue
[41:39] if you don't believe that's right I'll
[41:41] give you a book unless I take go to work
[41:43] the Godhead explained where they were
[41:45] questioning brother Branham about
[41:46] baptism you can see if he don't tell
[41:49] them people he said you baptized into
[41:52] the name of the Father the Son and the
[41:55] Holy Ghost and he said into your right
[42:03] he said the only way you can do that is
[42:06] to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus
[42:09] Christ he had him closed off because
[42:15] they thought he was bragging on them but
[42:16] they were doing it right and then he
[42:18] goes on what it was see the truth to
[42:21] correct the error right all right so
[42:24] then I've been talking about it
[42:26] especially this makes three services
[42:29] what were we before the foundation of
[42:32] the world not the background a little
[42:35] bit for the company where it doesn't
[42:36] lose them cuz it you know yes I thought
[42:40] using it and wonder what you saying so
[42:42] you know but make the point and get it
[42:47] dark all right what were we before the
[42:54] foundation of the world
[42:58] we were not people I've emphasized and
[43:02] we were not a little identities floating
[43:05] around little bumps little spots or
[43:07] anything you want to make it we was in
[43:10] Jesus Christ if we have eternal life but
[43:15] of those that do not have eternal I was
[43:17] not in Jesus Christ
[43:20] you use every book but they sell those
[43:22] people hadn't received eternal love you
[43:24] that ain't got nothin to do with it
[43:26] the book of the life of the lamb slain
[43:28] was written before the foundation of the
[43:30] world and if your name was not written
[43:32] in that book it never will be in that
[43:34] book they are books that you have to
[43:38] deal with your name can be in the book
[43:42] and be removed but it can't be in the
[43:46] book of the life of the Lamb that was
[43:49] slain before the foundation of the world
[43:50] the eternal part never be removed I said
[43:56] that's it and there's no such thing as
[44:01] we talked about a new name was written
[44:03] in heaven you've heard that you know
[44:06] so-and-so got saved a new name was
[44:08] written in heaven there's no such thing
[44:10] he was either done for the world it
[44:12] would never be done they will be one day
[44:16] those who are given eternal life at the
[44:19] white throne and you can transfer the
[44:21] name if you want to go to the message
[44:25] and there's reunion and you can go to a
[44:29] point of transferring at that time but
[44:32] remember you're not talking about
[44:33] born-again Christians because you don't
[44:35] transfer is either die or it ain't time
[44:39] that solves the problem all right so now
[44:42] what were we back tired we were a part
[44:49] of him when I was asking him this
[44:56] morning a simple point to be Almighty
[45:02] God it takes what you know to be
[45:07] Almighty God what is he father son Holy
[45:09] Spirit raah and when he came on earth he
[45:14] proved what he was to come with Father
[45:16] Son and Holy Spirit he came down as what
[45:20] God Himself tabernacled in a human body
[45:25] that was created and so the soul and the
[45:30] spirit of Almighty God came into a human
[45:33] bomb
[45:33] and very late in the in the cradle the
[45:38] Prophet would call him Jehovah crime
[45:41] Jehovah with no teeth said your god a
[45:45] baby laying in a cradle I don't make no
[45:48] difference he was adamant there was
[45:51] things he couldn't do that he had to
[45:53] wait until aids came you know what I
[45:56] mean is he got older the Bible said he
[45:58] grew in grace and knowledge huh he
[46:02] finally come to a place one day he could
[46:05] speak to the fire season a thing you
[46:07] remember and correct him but he couldn't
[46:10] be your Savior at that moment he was
[46:14] still too young then he entered his
[46:17] ministry he was not your Savior at that
[46:21] time he was your teacher see he grew in
[46:30] one Eon what was might manifest he grew
[46:33] into it
[46:34] Laura now so then thinking about him now
[46:42] what part were we before the world
[46:52] we'll be part of his body no well we
[47:00] part of this spirit raava said we
[47:04] wouldn't spirit Specter I'm still in the
[47:11] Godhead whether y'all believe it or not
[47:14] trying to preach one true Living God
[47:16] been added fifty years and still ain't
[47:19] got it done yet
[47:24] what were we before the world you've got
[47:32] to deal with the fact of God be in the
[47:34] spirit right but do you realize until
[47:38] this message came to express things and
[47:42] the truth no matter who it is they never
[47:47] had it lined up right that's why you can
[47:54] go through the Old Testament you don't
[47:57] find the body of God in the Old
[47:59] Testament right you know what I mean
[48:05] you wouldn't in the Old Testament in a
[48:08] physical form a body you had to wait and
[48:16] the body was provided the prophets had
[48:21] to build the body rah
[48:22] come on oh you're up but you can follow
[48:25] the Spirit of God through the Old
[48:28] Testament right cuz you can see the
[48:31] Spirit of God as it comes upon the
[48:32] people you can see the anointing that
[48:35] would come upon Moses or the prophets
[48:39] and times you can see that spirit as it
[48:42] anoint them will remember that spirit
[48:48] anointed by them Balaam has prophecies
[48:57] in this word Balaam
[49:03] God took baylin's word and put it in the
[49:07] Bible that's why you can find the Spirit
[49:14] of God throughout the Old Testament but
[49:20] can you find the soul of God there oh
[49:27] can you find the soul of God in the Old
[49:30] Testament can you find that the Athenee
[49:41] of God in the Old Testament yeah because
[49:55] he wasn't appeared to milk to Abraham
[50:00] not a spirit but not a human flesh body
[50:07] because he could just step in and out
[50:10] you let the body be learned let it be
[50:12] flesh that's fine you know no problem
[50:14] but you understand what I'm talking
[50:16] about that body of Melchizedek could not
[50:19] die for your sins because he would not
[50:22] kinfolks
[50:25] right you understand what I'm saying the
[50:29] Old Testament you can't follow a line
[50:31] unless you know what you weigh you're
[50:33] going well what about in the Old
[50:39] Testament when he appeared to Moses at
[50:43] the burning bush
[50:50] now I'm not the one that wrote all the
[50:52] books Oh remember that now but Moses
[50:55] said one day he said Lord he said I've
[51:02] talked to you I've seen you do great
[51:04] things
[51:05] I seen you destroy Egypt I've seen you
[51:08] all of these things I'll miss it the
[51:12] burning bush
[51:13] I said Lord I'd like to see you he says
[51:21] you can't do that now
[51:22] ice garden for speaking back to it he
[51:24] said you can't do that Nile he said no
[51:26] man can see my face and live why because
[51:29] it was not time but what did he do
[51:35] I love where he put him he didn't say
[51:39] Moses go over and stand behind the old
[51:40] oak tree I've been there it's wonderful
[51:44] place
[51:44] he didn't say go over here and to pool
[51:48] she'll only been there singing what he
[51:53] do he said Moses he said go stand in the
[51:58] cliff to the rock what rock is he
[52:01] standing in the one he spoke but the
[52:05] water came from was the rock which is
[52:08] Christ he said Moses go stand in that
[52:12] rock that was not a physical rock he
[52:15] went over okay down Lord go ahead it
[52:22] wasn't a physical rock that fathered the
[52:26] children of Israel he would've dug out
[52:28] Rock he kept moving moving water running
[52:30] out up no the water went where they went
[52:33] you're still running for the gusher all
[52:37] right listen so he said go stand in the
[52:40] cleft of the rock and he said I'll go by
[52:44] and said when you do turn around look at
[52:47] me
[52:47] well said you can't see my face and live
[52:53] he saw a man didn't he now I'm quoting
[52:57] brother Branham he said he saw theophany
[52:59] now I'll quote him again and saying what
[53:01] he said that was the very
[53:03] back of the Lord Jesus Christ of the
[53:10] theophany that he was Abraham he
[53:18] appeared Abraham what about when he
[53:23] appeared to the Hebrew children that was
[53:25] in the fiery furnace and wouldn't know
[53:29] corporal physical body was it that was
[53:34] the theophany okay a prophet saying what
[53:41] he said a body kind of like our bodies
[53:44] looking but he said not like it will be
[53:47] in the glorified state but he said it's
[53:51] a body that God dwelt in okay now I ask
[54:00] you a question what part were we a part
[54:06] of before the world
[54:10] what part of God were we a part of
[54:21] he was so real and so personal
[54:25] until when his body laid in her to the
[54:32] earthly body went to hell to preach to
[54:35] the spirits in prison I'm quoting
[54:40] brother Brennan you didn't call it just
[54:47] the Alpha knee he said his soul went to
[54:50] hell now I got a direct quote in here
[54:54] I'll be glad for you to read if I don't
[54:55] get time to read the run said in spirit
[54:57] he never went to hell you ever heard it
[55:01] like that he said in spirit he never
[55:03] went to hell he said he went in his soul
[55:08] which was this theophany now there is
[55:10] where the people don't understand it
[55:12] page 80 of the Hebrew book I've quoted
[55:16] that since 1969 two people indicated as
[55:21] he still don't want to believe we wrote
[55:22] around and said the difference in a man
[55:24] in an animal he said God put her soul in
[55:27] you he said that's all he put in you
[55:29] that's theophany you realized then what
[55:37] he would be saying when he comes on over
[55:39] in the questions and answers and asked
[55:41] him that he said Eve was still in
[55:45] theophany and Adam was put in flesh he
[55:53] said Eve was still in theophany he said
[55:56] she was one in Adam in theophany so now
[56:00] whatever you think about what this is
[56:01] and what you're going to and whatever
[56:03] you do Adam and Eve had to same
[56:05] theophany I know that's all it's a
[56:08] problem there was one in theophany
[56:11] brother Brennan said to show it right
[56:14] then to prove it he said then she was
[56:16] not taken
[56:17] physically from any other dirt and made
[56:20] a part of him she was taken from Adam oh
[56:26] we want to make her a by-product
[56:33] we want to make her a piece of hamburger
[56:35] meat butwe're porterhouse steak you know
[56:37] what men we're great we're you better go
[56:42] on and look up the word by-product if
[56:47] you ever looked it up don't raise your
[56:50] hand if you ever looked up the word
[56:52] by-product I've asked you for it 40
[56:55] years to look it up if you ever looked
[56:57] it up the word by-product means a same
[57:05] value or greater value we want to make
[57:13] it a by-product if something's wrong he
[57:16] never made her wrong
[57:18] putting her in flesh brought the ability
[57:22] to see in night was remember Adam sinned
[57:27] too so in his body he could have sinned
[57:34] he did so how did Jesus go to hell his
[57:45] body didn't know I'll be glad to read
[57:48] where the Prophet City spirit didn't go
[57:50] he said cause the Spirit came to die
[57:52] a spirit came down
[57:59] come on read your Bible when Jesus
[58:02] Christ died what happened the body went
[58:07] to the grave where does the Bible say
[58:10] the spirit went back to God who gave it
[58:15] and then your prophet is one that put it
[58:18] that the soul is what went to hell
[58:20] called we read where it says spirits in
[58:22] prison
[58:23] and we want to use that experience to
[58:25] try to make his spirit go he wasn't his
[58:28] spirit that went to hell the word spirit
[58:36] and soul did it and read it
[58:39] taking concordance and look up the word
[58:41] definition of the word spirit and see if
[58:44] it's it does not
[58:47] in your Strong's Concordance does not
[58:49] distinguish between your spirit that is
[58:52] five senses the spirit of mankind and
[58:55] the spirit of Jesus Christ it does not
[58:57] tell you any difference in it it doesn't
[59:00] tell you one is this and one is that it
[59:02] tells you the same definition we know
[59:06] Jesus is spirit what it was it was the
[59:09] spirit of Almighty God see if his
[59:11] spirited went to hell then he would've
[59:13] been dying so what is it
[59:25] if we were in him where we were at oh
[59:31] yeah if we were in him if we were in the
[59:35] end before the world you had never heard
[59:37] brother Branham make this statement he
[59:39] says he then died by if we're part of
[59:43] him he said I suffered with him he said
[59:49] I hey I was on the earth and went
[59:52] through the thing he said and I died in
[59:55] him and said I went to hell in him and
[59:58] said I rogues in him now what part of
[1:00:06] God could fulfill all of that there's
[1:00:11] one if everybody believe run a random
[1:00:13] they wouldn't be so confused you say so
[1:00:15] theophany mind of the people who go I
[1:00:18] got it the often the up yonder and the
[1:00:20] right songs I'm not against it but they
[1:00:24] write songs I'm I not theophany is
[1:00:27] calling me I agree with that
[1:00:31] we'll remember there's a lot of
[1:00:34] difference in the new birth and God
[1:00:39] calling you to something worthy calling
[1:00:43] you to if they ain't something pulling
[1:00:45] you
[1:00:52] so I ask you the question by thinking
[1:00:56] about that the often in the soul and and
[1:00:58] what we said about the Old Testament
[1:01:00] Saints can you see the very soul of God
[1:01:02] down there with him now murder random he
[1:01:07] said God didn't stay up in heaven he
[1:01:12] said he come down to dwell with man to
[1:01:20] fellowship with us just in spirit
[1:01:26] everybody can fellowship with him in
[1:01:28] spirit words that over where's that soul
[1:01:35] of God throughout that Old Testament now
[1:01:39] if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's got to be
[1:01:40] saying yesterday today and forever okay
[1:01:43] the soul of God was back there what is
[1:01:47] the soul prophets it is you you're a
[1:01:51] soul that's from you must be born again
[1:02:01] where were we act not just a part of a
[1:02:05] spirit up in heaven because that spirit
[1:02:10] can anoint anybody that are doing it by
[1:02:14] him and he's prophesied in the very
[1:02:15] person of Jesus Christ David Solomon not
[1:02:21] a born-again believer but the spirit
[1:02:24] could come upon them so great until they
[1:02:27] could speak in the first person right
[1:02:30] David senator Solomon ones who said they
[1:02:33] pierce my hands in my feet speaking as
[1:02:38] though he was Almighty God but can you
[1:02:45] find this old
[1:02:50] which we say but the soul is is your
[1:02:54] saying brother dealer so I didn't say it
[1:02:56] bred around it but you say you're saying
[1:02:58] it's a soul is the theophany look I got
[1:03:04] a feel from if you under
[1:03:05] I got Bible fart but you ain't reading
[1:03:09] your Bible would you mind reading where
[1:03:13] it says it said if which is a question
[1:03:20] if this earthly Tabernacle were
[1:03:24] dissolved we have one waiting watch now
[1:03:27] eternal in the heavens
[1:03:32] do you have the new birth today you
[1:03:36] claiming you I don't where his hands
[1:03:37] I've asked you to think you have the new
[1:03:41] birth do you have eternal life in your
[1:03:43] soul all right do you have eternal life
[1:03:46] up in heaven buried in you so that
[1:03:52] pulling you up there is you theophany in
[1:03:55] the positive your soul is your Theon
[1:03:58] listen your prophet explains it I didn't
[1:04:01] a sinner has a theophany but the Anthony
[1:04:07] means a body and that body of a sinner
[1:04:13] go somewhere not just a physical body we
[1:04:17] bury it the spirit goes back to God who
[1:04:20] gave it
[1:04:21] but his soul goes to hell that's why you
[1:04:29] don't listen to the prophet he said he
[1:04:32] went beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:04:34] the angel of the Lord and I got it
[1:04:36] laying right here if you don't mean it
[1:04:37] he said the angel of the Lord told him
[1:04:40] this is sold under the altar when he
[1:04:47] went beyond the curtain of time he said
[1:04:49] now listen he's returned I'll be glad
[1:04:51] it's laying on my dad he's referring to
[1:04:53] sinners and he said stop sin he said and
[1:04:57] I saw God in the same type of body
[1:05:04] went beyond the curtain time were our
[1:05:09] who was in hell
[1:05:14] come on who is in hell the souls of the
[1:05:20] people that sinned so you don't see it
[1:05:23] in your spirit you don't sit in your
[1:05:27] body
[1:05:29] those are displays waves you send from
[1:05:33] your soul the soul that sinneth it shall
[1:05:34] die it doesn't say the spirit that
[1:05:36] sinneth see you don't understand that we
[1:05:39] try to make it to her but not the often
[1:05:41] these up you under within what do you
[1:05:45] have inside of you if you have any turn
[1:05:48] a lot why can't you say the eternal life
[1:05:53] you receive according to the profit you
[1:05:55] receive it as a baby right faith as a
[1:05:59] baby what's pulling you if you're born
[1:06:03] again today the pool is not down here to
[1:06:07] pull this from up here you're drawing
[1:06:09] you up we're dry well why don't you see
[1:06:11] it's your soul when you're born again is
[1:06:14] eternal and that starts the process of
[1:06:18] you being drawn upward into a positive
[1:06:21] of God's mind why can't you see that
[1:06:25] about yourself see then that makes it
[1:06:31] easy to understand they tell you this
[1:06:36] ain't something new for me so I don't
[1:06:37] have to worry about it for over nearly
[1:06:40] 50 years I've been preaching this I got
[1:06:45] tapes from 2002 upward to show you
[1:06:48] because when God showed it to me I saw a
[1:06:53] soul of a man named Jesus as it come
[1:06:58] down through the Old Testament he's very
[1:07:02] nice her you tell me it wasn't the
[1:07:06] nature of a man who was it when a
[1:07:13] prophet
[1:07:13] stood before a king what kept God from
[1:07:20] killing David the words of the Prophet
[1:07:26] weird words our prophet come from
[1:07:30] David said bring the man here I'll kill
[1:07:33] him myself
[1:07:35] what the prophets say he said David you
[1:07:38] won't ha Jesus we call that's right for
[1:07:41] you who was praying for him father that
[1:07:49] soul of God through the Old Testament as
[1:07:51] you see him making itself manifest with
[1:07:54] the children of Israel then he
[1:07:57] blindsided his own eyes to him in the
[1:08:00] way they were doing and still took him
[1:08:02] into the Promised Land
[1:08:03] maybe that's a wrong way of saying it
[1:08:05] but it's the truth in it they got to the
[1:08:09] promised land
[1:08:09] why not just because of an anointing of
[1:08:12] the Spirit it was a very nature and
[1:08:17] being in person of Almighty God if you
[1:08:22] can't do that then Hebrews 13:8 don't
[1:08:24] mean a thing to you he's the same
[1:08:26] yesterday today and forever whatever you
[1:08:28] can find here you'd be able to find it
[1:08:29] dark well I never thought about the soul
[1:08:33] of God do you know what word was it app
[1:08:39] if you think the man didn't know what he
[1:08:41] told me David said my soul thirsts just
[1:08:48] after the old guard he cried out in his
[1:08:55] soul and like I said what went down to a
[1:09:01] grave called Hades hell Gahanna show
[1:09:03] whatever the world you the soul of the
[1:09:08] individual was put in a place but you
[1:09:11] know there was another place called
[1:09:13] Paradise they told Old Testament Saints
[1:09:17] not in body was in the gray not in
[1:09:20] spirit he went back to God who gave it
[1:09:22] within their soul they were there and
[1:09:25] what I love is what the
[1:09:27] it would emphasize you ever heard him
[1:09:29] say that he said saver come here they
[1:09:33] come here saver
[1:09:35] remember he's gonna knocked it to go
[1:09:37] where you know they opened the door into
[1:09:40] him and I believe it's right when he
[1:09:45] said saver come here he said this is the
[1:09:51] one we fed the cave to he recognized him
[1:10:00] come he was standing there in history of
[1:10:03] the body he was standing there real
[1:10:16] enough that they could see him you ever
[1:10:25] thought about the soul of God why would
[1:10:28] Jesus get on the cross and say my soul
[1:10:31] is troubled brother branham's when he
[1:10:37] said it he said the anointing left Jesus
[1:10:40] in the Garden of Gethsemane where he
[1:10:42] could die as a man the flesh is what
[1:10:46] died the soul just stepped out of the
[1:10:49] body and went straight down to hell
[1:10:51] first and preached to those that were
[1:10:54] disobedient the long-suffering the days
[1:10:56] of Noah and on his way back up he stops
[1:11:00] at paradise right and you know what a
[1:11:06] lot of those Old Testament Saints raised
[1:11:09] what did they raise up him their
[1:11:14] physical body wasn't in there their
[1:11:16] spirit wasn't done what the prophets say
[1:11:18] about it when you die he said it in time
[1:11:21] comes he said your soul is released
[1:11:25] it'll come to the spirit in spirit to
[1:11:28] the body and he said you stand here I
[1:11:31] would run around them emphasize it why
[1:11:33] would the angel of the Lord tell brother
[1:11:35] Branham two times that those souls under
[1:11:37] the altar
[1:11:41] getting scripture he saw those people he
[1:11:50] held him a sinner has a place to go when
[1:11:57] he dies right a Christian has a place to
[1:12:04] go when he dies where is it sold under
[1:12:08] the older not crying how long how long
[1:12:11] now you got in the wrong way with your
[1:12:13] scripture it's how long how long and
[1:12:16] stop till sealed you I said how long how
[1:12:20] long they'll be in job blood we don't to
[1:12:22] use it because we're afraid of that your
[1:12:24] prophet used it names of the Lord
[1:12:27] referred to the Prophet this is sold
[1:12:29] under the altar he didn't say these his
[1:12:31] spirits under the altar he said this is
[1:12:33] sold under the whole tree so what part
[1:12:38] do you want to be of of God can folks to
[1:12:44] the body
[1:12:45] okay fine that would be wonderful he
[1:12:48] give us a blood transfusion spirit they
[1:12:52] can anoint this to anybody what about
[1:12:55] the soul of God what about it okay
[1:13:08] then they read these Feist I want to get
[1:13:13] off of this but I can't and the message
[1:13:21] God who is rich in mercy he said you
[1:13:24] always were the sons of God and when God
[1:13:31] had you in his thinking at the beginning
[1:13:33] you have to be some part of you your
[1:13:36] life that's in you now that had to be
[1:13:39] with God before though now what was it
[1:13:43] in God being part of him part of his own
[1:13:47] life now watch him
[1:13:49] who is this Melchizedek if you have
[1:13:54] eternal life you always was not your
[1:13:57] being here with the shape and form of
[1:14:00] the infant of God
[1:14:02] what's the shaitaan' form of the
[1:14:04] infinite god what what do you have any
[1:14:07] trouble with a theophany back now you
[1:14:10] know we've read this over and over
[1:14:11] questions and answers on Genesis he said
[1:14:14] some part of you some part when God
[1:14:17] created me William Branham I was before
[1:14:20] the foundation of the world he made my
[1:14:22] being my spirit I wasn't conscious many
[1:14:25] things for and I know it and I was dire
[1:14:27] he said I don't believe you're hitting
[1:14:29] it look there was some part of me Armand
[1:14:34] and use the Armand Neville and part of
[1:14:39] you rest of you there was back there

[1:14:48] part of God

[1:14:59] are part of him each individual in here
[1:15:02] that possesses the this eternal I was
[1:15:05] before the foundation of the world in
[1:15:07] God's thinking well he's just in this
[1:15:13] thinking that's part of him here's where
[1:15:16] we got through the other day and we read
[1:15:18] this one but let's go number 5 which is
[1:15:21] the message Christ revealed in his own
[1:15:22] word he said now the same is if you are
[1:15:26] a son of God and I am a son of God or a
[1:15:28] daughter of God we were in God at the
[1:15:31] beginning and when Jesus became the
[1:15:33] fullness of the word then we were in him
[1:15:36] jerm form gern form means you got the
[1:15:43] germ but it's not totally alive we
[1:15:48] wasn't in him in flesh he said that's
[1:15:53] the type host of the soul now we're
[1:15:57] gonna start and give me just a minute
[1:15:58] that's 20 tails we'll hold on look at
[1:16:01] the next one number seven the Good
[1:16:05] Shepherd of the Sheep you believe that
[1:16:09] in him never dwelt just part of God but
[1:16:14] all of God was in him I mean was in his
[1:16:18] son Christ Jesus
[1:16:19] he was the fullness of the Godhead
[1:16:21] bodily all of God was poured into Christ
[1:16:25] all that Christ was there was was in
[1:16:29] Christ and Christ and the poured into
[1:16:32] out on the church and he said we keep
[1:16:35] refusing it refusing what refusing to
[1:16:39] accept what God's doing
[1:16:41] what is the next one the message taking
[1:16:44] is really not to your own understanding
[1:16:45] God is not complete without you know
[1:16:50] what about that God is not complete
[1:16:53] without you all right you ain't answer
[1:16:56] to get brother there
[1:16:57] okay we'll answer it go to number nine
[1:16:59] spoken word as your regional seat
[1:17:05] if I were in the foreknowledge of God
[1:17:07] then you are becoming a part of God and
[1:17:09] the only way you can be a son of God or
[1:17:11] a daughter of God you had to be a part
[1:17:13] of God and God isn't complete without
[1:17:16] you
[1:17:16] he's had to go through the next week
[1:17:18] that's number nine and go to number 10
[1:17:22] yeah I mean number nine excuse me back
[1:17:24] then I get my numbers I've called it
[1:17:26] I haven't ours number nine it's taken
[1:17:29] spoken word broken sister all right that
[1:17:32] if I had it if I don't know before there
[1:17:35] was world when we were sold now you want
[1:17:43] to answer in the profit
[1:17:44] what were we before the world he just
[1:17:48] answered when we were sold a part of God
[1:17:55] there we are but we were with him before
[1:17:57] the foundation of the world because
[1:17:59] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:18:00] and that's God and we're part of him not
[1:18:04] so much of that you would know when the
[1:18:05] thing I could think or had a be a huh
[1:18:07] we're in stocks you said well that's
[1:18:09] just in his dollars okay so a part of
[1:18:16] God go to number 10 what worry before
[1:18:23] the world number 10 demonology physical
[1:18:26] realm but your souls were made up before
[1:18:29] the foundation of the world when God
[1:18:31] created man in his own image
[1:18:38] when did your soul come into being as a
[1:18:43] part of God he's telling you which your
[1:18:46] souls were made up before the foundation
[1:18:48] of the world when God created man in his
[1:18:52] own image now how many people did he
[1:18:54] create we've done established even Adam
[1:18:57] was one one theophany right the many
[1:19:06] souls that he create before the world
[1:19:08] one
[1:19:13] take it Olivia sleep he's the one that
[1:19:18] said it I did your songs we made up for
[1:19:20] the finest world when God created man in
[1:19:22] his on the image spirit of man not a man
[1:19:24] in his own image but man in his own
[1:19:27] image then he made them male and female
[1:19:29] before he ever had a man of the dust of
[1:19:31] the earth which we had a change in you
[1:19:33] know could do for them and that made man
[1:19:36] in His image and when God turned around
[1:19:41] was made an image of man to redeem him
[1:19:44] right number 11 well mascoutah selling
[1:19:49] out and when God made man in His image
[1:19:52] he was a spirit man and then there was
[1:19:54] no man that tells us all then he created
[1:19:56] man out of the dust so now we know what
[1:19:57] happened Adam was created first spirit
[1:20:02] man that Aaron says theophany so Eve was
[1:20:10] a part of him in theophany she had her
[1:20:14] own being at herself and was herself but
[1:20:17] the one theophany was what God created
[1:20:20] in Genesis going down to number 11 the
[1:20:28] faith of Abraham I wrote it up and you
[1:20:31] begin with a soul before the world was
[1:20:36] ever formed when God created man in his
[1:20:40] own image so the man of Genesis 1:26 and
[1:20:43] 27 there not to be created on the sixth
[1:20:46] day he was created before any day he
[1:20:49] ever come Genesis 1:26 and 27
[1:20:55] if one theophany one soul and that's the
[1:21:00] soul of Almighty God he calls off short
[1:21:02] to even blaspheme his name were God put
[1:21:05] into Adam eternal life you know got him
[1:21:11] right here where he were Eve was dire
[1:21:14] she was still in theophany Adam was down
[1:21:16] here in flesh then when he done it he
[1:21:19] put him in put her into Adam then he
[1:21:21] separated her out of Adam what were you
[1:21:26] before the
[1:21:27] were a part of God part of one part of
[1:21:30] his soul okay let's go to number 13
[1:21:40] trying to skip a few 13 which is the
[1:21:47] message questions and answers in genesis
[1:21:52] - there was no man to till the soil and
[1:21:54] God made man out of the dust of the
[1:21:55] earth not in His image but in the image
[1:21:57] of the animal life he was virtually
[1:21:59] creating the image of God and he put the
[1:22:01] spirit of him in this animal in this
[1:22:04] animal man here and he become a living
[1:22:07] soul now that's the difference between a
[1:22:10] man and an animal the animal don't build
[1:22:13] automobiles etc he's a dumb brute all
[1:22:15] the time with a man in his flesh he's
[1:22:17] like a dumb brute but he's got a soul of
[1:22:20] God in him that makes him immortal now
[1:22:24] don't hook that to everybody be any
[1:22:27] mortal read the rest of the story cuz
[1:22:31] the center is not immortal immortal
[1:22:35] means eternal read the rest of it you
[1:22:39] see and he can invent look what he can
[1:22:44] do he's almost only equal with God
[1:22:48] because he's the son of God now stop
[1:22:52] start your sentence even in his fall in
[1:22:54] the state he's wonderful
[1:22:58] not saying the sinner is immortal read
[1:23:03] it I want to get this one where you read
[1:23:08] it okay go ahead and over 15 and I want
[1:23:10] to do this in anyway where you get dirt
[1:23:16] on the Queen of Sheba reefs in 1960
[1:23:20] brother Branham says the animal died and
[1:23:23] could not come back and he be in the
[1:23:27] spirit with the human beings he couldn't
[1:23:29] come back because it was an animal life
[1:23:32] without a soul
[1:23:33] what's it but Jesus but when Jesus died
[1:23:39] it was a soul of God now watch him you
[1:23:48] said well he didn't die he acted the
[1:23:50] part of death I got it in here okay
[1:23:52] that's the unveiling of God he had to go
[1:23:55] through an active part of that where
[1:23:57] Satan wouldn't know what's going on his
[1:23:59] soul didn't die he just went to hell and
[1:24:02] come back up he played the part of death
[1:24:05] or Satan don't know the story that's
[1:24:07] good he could not die
[1:24:09] what's he God failed in Jesus to do the
[1:24:14] work of redemption to crawl God could
[1:24:17] not die as a spirit he's eternal but he
[1:24:21] had to put on a mask and act the part of
[1:24:24] death that was his release in that soul
[1:24:29] out of that body and then boy the soul
[1:24:34] went to hell and he so was its theophany
[1:24:38] we turned back onto their Pentecost as
[1:24:41] the Son of God
[1:24:42] okay come on musicians I get too much
[1:24:45] I'm sorry I pushed in and I leave you
[1:24:48] dangling while they're coming one time
[1:24:51] what part of you was before the world
[1:24:56] it's not your body it's not see spirit
[1:24:59] he said what was my soul back there your
[1:25:02] soul was only a part of God there's only
[1:25:05] one eternal life there's only one
[1:25:08] eternal theophany a sinner brother
[1:25:11] branham I'll give him to you I know two
[1:25:13] times these hawks of a sinner having
[1:25:15] that theophany uh-huh
[1:25:18] but that the often he's not eternal
[1:25:21] that's the body that he goes to but a
[1:25:23] Christian his his soul is its theophany
[1:25:27] page 80 of the Hebrew book he couldn't
[1:25:31] put that into an animal he put it into a
[1:25:36] human being when he made God in His own
[1:25:38] image made him a soul that's why David
[1:25:43] could cry out my soul thirst after the
[1:25:46] old God that's why you cried out in your
[1:25:50] soul we worked on my life's not
[1:25:53] the question was asked literally enjoyed
[1:25:56] the questions and answers life not we
[1:25:58] had a wonderful time the question was
[1:26:00] brought out of what what about you when
[1:26:03] you was just out in the world and born
[1:26:04] you don't remember a conscience of a
[1:26:11] human being
[1:26:12] science says is a moral obligation I
[1:26:15] mean in a world defining a conscience is
[1:26:19] a moral obligation to do good why cause
[1:26:23] you were created by God
[1:26:25] that's good he never made you wrong he
[1:26:28] made you right you went wrong but a
[1:26:33] conscience you remember when your kids
[1:26:37] come on girls boys ladies women be
[1:26:40] sensible without being brother Dale
[1:26:43] being so bad but you remember when you
[1:26:46] girls and boys had never been out with a
[1:26:49] boy or a girl and done anything wrong
[1:26:52] remember the little temptations it would
[1:26:55] come to the to try to get you to go do
[1:26:57] that and you wouldn't do it but then one
[1:27:01] day you slipped and done it and after
[1:27:05] then it was easy for you to do it why
[1:27:08] you seared your conscience but it won't
[1:27:13] stop dealing with you that's what I said
[1:27:15] every word listen the other night what
[1:27:17] brother Ron was talking about that
[1:27:18] little girl that he told her he said God
[1:27:20] is calling you tonight she went outside
[1:27:22] in you're here sometime later she's seen
[1:27:24] him and said you know that day you told
[1:27:28] me that she's yours right she'd be cold
[1:27:30] all of my life said something has guided
[1:27:32] me and tried to bring me to God I said I
[1:27:34] wouldn't do it and said from the night
[1:27:36] you said dad said my conscience got
[1:27:39] seared and said I could see my mama died
[1:27:42] now in life about it but she said God
[1:27:47] dealt with her up to that time that he
[1:27:49] spoke you don't remember God dealing
[1:27:53] with you to try to keep you from doing
[1:27:54] wrong and you just overrode it what was
[1:28:00] the first lie oh the lie detector test
[1:28:02] you put it on somebody and they tell the
[1:28:04] first lied
[1:28:05] but after a while to keep lying it don't
[1:28:08] do too much that's what I'm talking
[1:28:12] about that's what your prophet said so
[1:28:14] don't you remember something different
[1:28:15] about you that you wanted to serve God
[1:28:24] come on you don't like it for people
[1:28:26] that can make statements but I saw God
[1:28:28] when I was 11 years old
[1:28:30] I don't back up from that time I desired
[1:28:35] to find that God but I'll let the world
[1:28:38] take me into the garbage can
[1:28:43] as you know what he never stopped I rode
[1:28:50] by their toes listening I rode by their
[1:28:53] here while here you did last year
