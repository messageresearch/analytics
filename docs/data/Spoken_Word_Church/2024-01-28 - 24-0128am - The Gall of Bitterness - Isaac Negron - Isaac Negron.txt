took that scripture and she applied it to her life and said hey I I need the body of Christ to pray for me and then you think about each other and she going on to she's now going on to be with the Lord last year but what a testimony that a Christian can't die right that we are alive in him and that's just one of those scriptures that it'll always stay in my memory and sometimes I wear that

amen good to be in the house of the Lord you may have your seat we're going to we have the Ohio group I'm oh hey Christian sorry you didn't get to make it buddy but they're watching in so we have another group watching so but I know some of you know about the Ohio group we had a u um we've had a short history with him but we really had a long history with him and he's going to give his testimony God of how he of how he got to this place this is Brother Richard Negron he's the daddy of this guy and the one you're fixing to here and Sister Crystal at home so go ahead I'm little nervous okay so me you're good family bro well I like to say um this was my bucket list um I like to say some great messages came out of this place and there were message that were prophetic message that would really helped me and and the five full ministry you have here is outstanding amen and you got Aaron Brother Louise Amen brother Luis preached the message kingdom of God brother that really helped me out I cried for two weeks when I heard that message you have brother Aaron there he preached a message called discernment and you know you have to discern the body of Christ they could discern the Worden then you have brother um Bob black he preached a message with really helped me out was the lonely Christian cuz when I was in my basement for 4 years I was alone well I was with somebody else in there with Google he was helping me hey Google how you spell this so I had big church like this I was taking notes and everything you know I did this for 4 years you know and brother Ryan the message about the burning bush that really helped me in fact one of the message help my son here Elisha so you know you think that nobody's here but there's somebody so what happened was you know the scripture Jesus had to go to Samaria well he had to go all the way to lorine that's what happened but uh what happened is I Heard a Voice that's what actually happened I I Heard a Voice in 2015 and it led me to the A when the internet system I'm old school I'm pencil and paper so when when I he spoke to me go internet and uh what happened was that I um I know nothing about the internet so I have to learn and what it was that before I went there he gave me a message called taking sit with Jesus I didn't know which side it was okay so what happened was I open this book like this is as far as I got right here I just look at that and I seen this pyramid I said I said Lord I know what that means love covered to a multiple sin but it was not that what it was he was going to descend down and reveal the seals to me right so I went on the internet and uh I seen all these different preachers and and I you know didn't hit me right but when I come to Samuel Dale he was preaching a study on the Book of Revelation and when I see brother Dale I got past them man and I seen Christ in that man and he made that word live yes I never seen anything like that you know I said my where is these guys getting this from so what happened so I was in the basement and I went all the way to the icon I went to 2010 and then I started coming this way with the message you know like going like this and then I come to brother um waywe who's preaching on uh downstairs statue of perfect man and he said that you don't sin and your soul you say in your spirit and I cry for weeks because we were never Tau that you know we were in the cycle 7 7 s we never got out of the cycle you know so so here so what happened I had um wait in the afternoon Samuel in the morning and I'm going to work so I was averaging three videos a day trying to catch up with your group here I'm going like this oh my so I'm catching up catching up catching up and so the message that really got me is I heard a message here preach matching pieces I never heard that message but when brother Dale was preaching on Revelation 5 the throne I think part uh 16 he was preaching a match pieces there I said my we got to match this over here it's got to match here okay so so okay so I'm here you know for uh um getting all these tape hearing him and and you know it went up for days and then what happened was one day I was uh got to had to go to work I work at 6:00 and I heard brother way and I'm fall asleep and I fall asleep and all a sudden I heard somebody say hey wake up said good grief 15 minutes come on oh that's that's and I woke up that's that's your ringtone now that's my ringtone now anyway so now here's here's the thing I just this is how God worked so here I'm coming up with the message coming up with the message I'll come to Bob black and Bob black is freaking here's the daughter of the son of man and I looked at that and I looked at this it was snatching pieces Yen right there right there and I said oh looking I'm coming like this it didn't da on me but when he pointed this and there it is matching peace that's right so I just want to leave that with you guys the whole story to that is he started in 2015 um and we didn't know anything about it he was doing it in secret but he presented it to to his hard-headed I mean his sons amen he says and they're like no we don't see none of that no we don't see none of that and then all of a sudden they saw some of that Dad just kept being persistent Hey listen to this watch that and now they now they watch my color code shirt yeah brother brother Richard say Hey Brother way preached in a red shirt go listen to that one or a blue shirt go listen to that one so but now they're all here and that's kind of why the Ohio group is here because of him because of the Lord there was a desire in a man's heart he wanted to know more right not saying anything about where he came from absolutely he just left that church and just disappeared and but he wanted to know truth not that they weren't preaching truth he wanted more truth he asked God he said and God said I'm going reveal the seals to you well he can't reveal the seals to you just sitting at home so when he got on the internet and saw all people weren't preaching then you know brother Dale has been preaching the seal since 1982 so I mean that's you know to us it's I hate to say this but to us it's just common because we hear it all the time but to somebody from the outside that hears it it's like man we never heard this before so so he he finally got his sons to to pay attention and his and his daughter and uh that's where they're at now so it's good to have uh good to have a daddy that stood with the word of God and and you know what he claimed his kids just like just like all of us are claiming our kids and and he claimed his kids they were out in the world all right yeah they were out in the world and he claimed them and then here they've come in and now his son's a pastor of a church so also now Sister m MSA to fit the puzzle together sister Melissa comes from the outside you know and she comes into this group of people and she just accepts the message with open arms and and she's just a part of the church and and part of the body of Christ and and and come on up here but as you come up here Franklin stand up brother that is Sister Tabitha's brother for those of you that went to Ohio with us remember I baptized his son in the at the in the Lake Erie and then he was standing close by and I could feel it and he could feel it but he just didn't it wasn't the right time and and and then well brother Isaac baptized him not too long ago in the name of the Lord Jesus he drove 10 hours yesterday to get here last night he's turned around driving back home tonight just to be here how am I supposed to follow that you can you're a nurse you've seen wor oh yes uh again I'm sister Melissa I'm Elisha's wife and like he said I was just I married into a wonderful family I really did um uh and yes I've I've just came in uh in 2020 um I was not raised a Christian I was not raised in the message and U like brother Michael was talking about it would have been vital to have a family and be raised in a home and brought up in a Christian home um and you really don't know what you didn't have until you find out what you do have so I tell Elisha every day how great grateful I am that just to be able to see a family that was raising the message and thank Brother Richard every day for that for giving me a husband that was raised the message and he's just so you know in love with Christ and it's really what attracted me to him was his love for Christ and and family and um uh so um so since 2020 I've been you know growing and learning and uh the Lord's been so good to me all my life really just never really not I never really knew that I've been through so much in life and I'm just like how am I here now and I learn it was just through the grace of God he was he was bringing me to a place and uh um so so yeah he mentioned I am a nurse I work for the Cleveland Clinic I don't know if anybody's heard of that it's a major corporation it's a um I even wrote it down here so it's um a 6,665 bed Health System um and they have 22 hospitals uh all over the world mostly in Ohio Vegas Abu Dhabi things like that so it's it's it's major it's a big Corporation it's it's very intimidating to work for a place like this you kind of just you're just a little peon in their system you know you just work for them and um never really feel like you have a voice you're just part of something um but I love my job I'm a nurse in the O and uh a lot of strong personalities in the O I mean surgeons uh staff members things like that so I kind of just you know come in work you know try not to cause any waves or any issues or anything like that um but uh since 2020 you know as my faith has been growing I never really thought to bring you know push your faith on others so you know people have noticed the change at work and it's not been easy I've had some things said to me and you know to try to discourage me or you know I was I was a completely different person before you know I gave my life to the Lord so it's hard to see others and and and I I've battled with you know and I've talked to my husband I've talked to my sisters about how you know I would love for for them to see Christ in me and it's been more recent than not because I've been stepping in faith and and not caring what others think of me and just pushing forward pushing through amen um and this year it it's interesting how they place people in your in your life so I mean I have sister Tabitha who's an amazing amazing uh person to lean on and um our uh her nieces is and nephews as well um but her niece was getting a job and she was really excited about it a care a caregiving job Kina she was I think she came down here before too and um she we were having a conversation with the sisters and you know she looked at me and she's like sister what do you what do you wear to you know what do you wear to work and I never really thought about it I was you know I would just go to work wear my uniform I had at work work it's what they gave us it's what they provided there was no other options and it was a scrub top and scrub pants and she's like oh she thought that I wore you know a scrub skirt cuz she had pulled some out that she had bought and I'm like you know I never really thought to ask my boss about this or anything so it was on my heart and then me and Tabitha talked about it and I said well how could I you know how could I go to a a place like this that nobody is wearing scrub skirts nobody's doing these things and I was really nervous and she kind of helped me um write out a couple of things um um to kind of help my testimony and went to my director and spoke with her about it and she seen how nervous I was and how you know she's like this really means a lot to you and I'm like yeah I said but how could I do this this is not the you know the policy it doesn't say anywhere in the policy I have to wear what you guys provide and she's like well you know we'll find a way we'll talk to our HR department we'll talk to whoever we need to talk to and she was very very helpful she was very um kind to me I the response I got was not what I thought I was going to get um So within like a couple of weeks you know we we waited and I got the response back that I you know that I needed and she came she was so happy for me and she's like as long as you purchase them you know and bring them in and then we'll reimburse you and we'll allow you to wear them we have to have them laundered here because it's a sterile environment so we went through this whole um process and I was able to wear them and not realizing it you know you really don't see things until you're walking and but um walking to the hospital people are just staring you know at my you know at my dress they're like I didn't even think that was a thing and and others and we have a lot of Arabic women who don't know that they can wear you know wear the the skirts and dresses and things and so they had asked me and a lot of them come from other countries so they don't speak English well and you know just ask the question and oh can you help me so I've helped a couple of other women you know so um but yeah so you know we felt it was it was a nice wi to be able to just be able to walk in your faith at work as well you know all around 24/7 so uh so it was great so then um so and then more recently um I think it was like a couple weeks ago that we I received a a message an email I guess it had been something talked about among the different committees and different things in hospital and I got a message for an email from our laundry our director of our laundry services and he says um that there's actually myself and a couple of others who have asked to have their their skirts laundered um so it just perked some interest in some um you know within our management system and so he said well I guess I'm going to be ordering they're going to be providing the the scrub SKS for yeah they found so it's nice I mean we have it's I never really thought that I could help others I just wanted to walk in my I want to choose for myself but it's become you know an awareness that and uh so I guess eventually it's going to be a story for our magnet committee so I'll be able to share my story to the whole Cleveland kic system and it's 77,000 caregivers so thank you ask are you going to testify she's like she must have lost that somewhere between there and here so but what a testimony God didn't just put it on one person now the whole system is affected by it so that's what the that's what the Lord will do if you'll stand for it he'll stand for you am man Sister Rose the same way you know she wears her skirts in there and then sister SAR and uh some of our Amy different ones we got sisters in here you stand for for the Lord he'll stand for you the Bible tells us to do these things all right now we're going to um we're going to bring brother Isaac out here in just a second but y'all stay right here cuz he's they're going to sing a song for us but I really do appreciate them appreciate them coming and appreciate Franklin it was just a surprise we didn't know he's coming he showed up at my house last night so uh uh it was a surprised to see our brother here and we sure pray for him he's like all of us he's going through trials and tribulations and you know the devil he turns every gun remember what brother Brown said you know why am I having these problems cuz I'm a Christian well you know what cuz Satan knows he lost a good guy Satan knows he lost a good soldier so he's going to try his best to get him back he's a good recruiter but we got a greater one it's called the Lord Jesus prise Lord so sister Tabitha thank you for having our brother here your brother here on your birthday you didn't know it either too so but that's uh it was a surprise and we sure appreciate pray for that Mom and Dad um Frank and Sylvia they're they're um they're having their battles too and they don't go to church and they're they're Catholic pretty much so but that doesn't matter we still pray for him still

get the get the nervousness out but uh but I thank God that we connected together there's a lot not a lot of people but some people were you know like why do we have a church up there in Ohio will you see why just we just need to every once in a while just keep our mouth shut and let the Lord work because he knew what he was doing we didn't amen I'm sorry to be so blunt but the best thing to do is be quiet for a minute be still you read that thing right that sign says be still and know that I'm God and he don't make a mistake never has never will so now they got a little group called The Lighthouse of refuge and that's exactly what it is some battered we're all battered and bruised but even in the storm that Lighthouse is on and you can see that Lighthouse and theyve become a lighthouse for the community there and and people that have even that have went away like Franklin different ones that that they're now coming back to the message and and seeing the message sister Melissa didn't know anything about it Franklin you probably threw tab a little bit but but you know out there in the world and now to come in and to sit in a in a in a congregation now they have you

said Melissa would you mind giving that test cuz when she told it there at the church I I just lost it because she left out one detail that I think is very important and that detail was this the man that emailed her said we need you to come up with the length the side like you design it right you make you set it and that's what it'll be and and I just lost it because I yes amen I thought about uh I thought about the queen you know Queen Esther when uh the king he sitting next to his wife and he said you you tell them you decree right so that's what it reminded me of and I said that's a wonderful testimony on top of the fact it was 77,000 people 77 is my favorite number cuz I was born in 77 so but uh yeah just keep me in prayer I'm a little nervous you know it's it's a it's a great honor to be here um you know brother Wade had enough confidence to allow me to come here and speak to you today so um I I don't feel like I have any deep things and stuff like that but I'll just share what I what I can just in my heart you know so um it's a blessing to be here so um let me put this aside hopefully my Bible ain't upside down oh no we're good let me go here all right so we'll uh if you guys don't mind standing as we read the word all right let me get this plugged in here okay so to today a little bit we well let's open to Ephesians 3 Ephesians 3 and we'll be speaking from 17 to 19 today little bit and what I got up here is this um I was telling brother Wade I said uh hopefully none of y'all get offended but it's going to be a little bit about my testimony and how I had to deal with bitterness in my life so but uh pray that's all L of here today right but uh yeah so um and uh just so y'all know uh I was talking to brother Michael uh ear earlier my brother Michael was giving his mother some some roses some flowers you know and I went up to him I said man I I'll be giving my dad some flowers today so so so if you got a love one give him some flowers it don't do no good when they're gone right so uh before we read let's go to the word in prayer the Lord in prayer Heavenly Father Lord we come before you today Lord I I ask Lord that you move me out the way Lord Lord I just love you Lord I just so grateful for everything you've done for me Lord Lord I pray father that I stay right where you want me to be Lord we just love you and thank you Lord in Jesus name amen so here in Ephesians 33 it says here and I pray that you being rooted and established in love may have power together with all the Lord's holy people people to grasp how wide and long and high and deep is the love of Christ and to know this love that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled to the measure of all the fullness of God so you may have your seats um and I didn't even turn in my Bible forgive me I'm a rookie I know it's important to read from the Bible but I'm learning forgive me for that but uh um so what I want to speak about a little bit today I went around and around so I had months to prepare for today brother Wade said a long time ago you going to be coming up and I'm like wait you know what I mean but he he did tell me and so I had a long time to prepare so I probably got about three or four in here that it's like I'mma do this one n you ever had that and then the Lord just you ain't doing none of those you doing something else yeah so so just hopefully it all makes sense but I kind of want to talk about light today and U you know things like that and bitterness how that ties in you'll see here in a little bit but the Lord will tied in hopefully for us but you know bitterness is is sharpness of taste and it means lack of sweetness so think about that lack of sweetness you know so you know how this all started for me was um and I'll give a testimony here about my father but you know I was sitting at a I was getting ready to do an inspection on the house I'm an uh electrician by trade I'm an electrical safety Spectre now cuz I'm lazy now I don't like to work with my tools no more they're Rusty they're sitting in the garage somewhere but um I was sitting at an inspection and what happens is when a house has been down with power for more than so so much time they they pull the meter so there's no electricity there and then the house depletes real quick if there's no life in it it's amazing how when there's no life in a house it just wow it's just so so I was looking at this house and I was thinking about my life when I was young you know you know that's me you know and and and and I had bitterness and why did I have bitterness so I grew up in a chrisan in the message I was about N9 months my dad came in and um you know growing up through it back then one with the parents the way uh Michael you hit it man you was right on it but back then you know the way the parents was raising the kids back then there was uh they they ruled with uh not so much love there wasn't too much love you know what I mean it was more the hammer you know what I mean and just the way it's going to be you know and some people caught soap in their mouths and you know all kinds of stuff we were talking about that last night yeah yeah look at Terence back he all proud of that but anyway so but uh so it a situation to where you know my my my dad was raised a certain way so you know he he only did the best he could at that time right and how he knew the racist so he come to the message and um man he's all ran and raving about things he would talk about things like that didn't even understand it but it's up there on the wall we had it on our wall since I was a baby real real big you know and um they didn't understand it at the time though you know it wasn't this appointed time right we know about the appointed time but so you know we grew up in a home where my dad was in the message he was doing prison Ministries and this and that and but I'll be honest I didn't see Christ in them you know I didn't see the hugs and help me with my homework and tuck me in bed at night and pray with me stuff like that you know so I grew up bitter I'll be honest I grew up bitter and so I says well if that's if that's God I don't I don't really want that you know what I mean so I went out into the world and um funny thing about it is is in high school 94 I met my wife we were dating in high school even though I was out in the world I was still talking to her about serpy the Lord this and that you know what I mean so it was kind of it was a kind of it it was it was amazing it really was but she accepted it very quickly and it's amazing when she gave her life to the Lord all the makeer everything was gone like I'm like wow I I there was no fight just gone I'm like that's good for me I picked the right one you know because she didn't she didn't war with a lot of things she was just very obedient and and that was that's another message I had but I won't go into that one but you know I asked the Lord one time I said what is Faith you know a lot of times preachers and people ministers will will try to express what is Faith and I could never grasp it I could never get it so one day the Lord just gave me another word to pair with it obedience so I said obedience so I started looking and I started seeing a trend was you know when you're obedient there is no laws there's no laws when you're obedient there's no laws so you know it's a situation to where I just needed a new spirit right cuz the spirit I was born with wasn't the right one so you know it was a situation where I started seeing these things and I want to preaching it I'm I got a lot of new people so we went from just the family to I want to say a solid 20 maybe 26 to 28 people right now which we started with about 13 it was just my family so yeah I got people calling me off the streets now like friends that I had I would hang out with the family at the barbecues they're calling me now like and they just dump on me they come to the house and they grown men with big muscles tatted up they sitting there crying then I start crying cuz I'm a I'm Hispanic so Hispanics we like to cry well not the cholos up in Mexico they don't cry too much but the ones up north we cry babies so you know I'm sitting here with you know these uh two there two two men I'm thinking about and they they come to me and and uh I dragged Franklin into it cuz Franklin gave his life to I'm all over the place but Franklin gave his life to the Lord recently and um I would talk to Franklin for years years his eyes are glaze over you can see it just falling right off how about the Browns yall know you guys got the Falcons up down down this way but uh so you know I would talk to Franklin for many years and uh and um it just just to no avail and then one day 2 2 3 2 3 in the morning me and my wife we get a a text and a phone call I love God that's all it said and I'm like confused looking at it and uh the next day I called him he's like the Lord visited me in my room now I want y'all to know we was down our way down here uh was it two years ago or a year ago was it two years AG years two years ago we were on the way down here to visit and my wife got the call he had a heart attack and died on the table twice he Flatline twice on that table and me and my wife we she started crying and know we prayed together in the car on the way here we were wondering it's turn back or not but we just said we'll just keep going but but uh anyways uh he's here today yeah and uh I I like for you to I would if it's a possible maybe the second service it be nice to have him up here and give his little testimony but um so you know now I can't he's always on my front porch now oh man so yeah one of those gentlemen going back to those gentlemen one of those gentlemen was at the house we were talking and uh Franklin just walks in you know it's his house right we love him so he just comes walking in he's like oh is it a bad time I said nope come on over here so I said you going to start working for the Lord too so we've been putting him to work uh his he helps me when when the these men come in he'll come over and we'll pray together with them and you know you know we want to try to get them to see and through this ministry here the most important thing is the new birth right through this ministry that's what we're learning it's not about the Deep things and all this and that it's just no let's get you up here to the Cross you got to realize you need a new spirit because them old skins you got they cracked they dried they ain't going to hold any kind of Revelation right so we got to get you we got to get you some new skins some new Nikes so yeah we uh so Franklin's learning now with me and uh he's he's great to have by my side and he keeps in context there's a lot going I didn't realize how much goes on with when being a pastor it's uh when brother brandom says you the ox of the team you the ox of the team you know what I mean and and it's a great thing it's a good thing the Lord saw fit that I can handle it and she he gave me a good support system with my wife so I always have my wife on my side you know what I mean and and um and things like that so we're learning we're growing together and and um it's nice when we can get away sometimes and and uh you know we get back to it and get in the grind so just keep me in prayer keep us in prayer that way but um so let's see if I can keep on going here y'all should have seen me like the last 24 hours I'm like pacing around I didn't sleep last night I'm up praying I'm like all over the place and and I'm like Lord you know there some great people have stood behind this Pulpit you know so I feel like a a student I was telling brother Wade I'm I'm just a little student but anyways looking at this house you see the lack of warmth no life not inviting dead cold dark and something I want to kind of get into today into today was you know I didn't have light the Bible says here in John in fact let's go to John here John 1 we'll go to it now let's see here in John 1 here it says and uh I know brother Way's been read reading this for a long time now he's been on a a series there but the wonderful series but in here at John 1 Chapter 4 it says in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in the darkness and the Darkness comprehended it not so you know when you look at this house the problem is it doesn't have any life in it and if it it needs life to have light because life in it turns the light you don't commune with somebody in the dark right people come over to the house you invite them in you turn on the lights you know what I mean so so that and and I was thinking about light I've been pondering light lately and and they can't measure it they've tried to measure light but they can't all these scientists Einstein come up with relativity um I can say it this time I can never say that I'm all over the place but um and then um uh what's the other one uh no what's that no um sorry I'm sorry no there was there's another scientist that did um um uh ah well it'll come it'll come when if it needs to but anyway you got different scientists they get most of the puzzle but they don't get all of it God God makes them come up a little short you know what I mean cuz he gets all the glory Glory so but what they're not getting is that light and and what they're trying to measure is sitting in this room right now they're trying to measure it but they can't find it it's right in front of them when they go to the grocery store and they see a sister walking into a Walmart with a long dress on all right that's the light they're trying to measure but they can't find it you know so you know it's a situation to where um you know but but to get there but to get there right in your when you receive the new birth right there you push Satan out your soul the darkness now what I noticed about turning a light on when the light comes on it's effort the lights effortlessly it doesn't have to push it's just effortlessly you see what I'm saying so it it's a situation where the darkness it's like it's like a the best way to explain it to you is like a man floating in space you push him with your finger and he just keep going that's the darkness that light just come in in and the Darkness just have to go you could light a small little candle and that you'll see that light pushed to the Far Corners of the room you understand and so what God's trying to bring us to with with brother Wade's Min uh what he been ministering on the son of man what God's trying to bring us to is now that we have life in our soul we must push that Darkness out of our spirit realm right and so we push it out by what trials and you know I want more patience well you go down I was telling the group uh it's been a little while so I'm good now but I was going down the highway and this guy came up behind me at like 100 mph so I'm like whoa I need to slide over a little bit so then I slid over and then he come in front of me and put his brakes on he brake checked me I'm like this man trying to kill me so I said you know what I'mma to pull up next to him I'm be like hey man let's pull over and talk about it so I was trying to get him to pull over so we could talk about it I said oh I can't do that so now I got to go back to the church and apologize so I went back to the church I this was like 3 months ago maybe so but the Lord was giving me a test on Temperance right and I'm not going I'm not going you know it's not something once you pass it you got it it's a constant right I heard brother Wade say years ago in one of his one of his things he said them lines should be going up and down I believe that I believe that cuz it's a constant you know so yeah so Temperance I'm like oh boy so yeah anyway I I I told my I told the Lord I said Lord if that man ever pulls up next to me I'm come on let's talk about I going to give you a hug I'm sorry you know what I mean but uh anyway so yeah he'll keep testing until you pass it and when he testing he go silent right when they give the test it's silence so you ain't got no help you on your own on this one but anyway so you know you know uh so you know speaking about bitterness and myself with my father when I was young and and just for the record he's my best friend now I love him I wouldn't trade him for nothing I wouldn't trade him for nothing because my dad is uh brother brownon preaches a message called oddballs my dad's an eyeball he really is he you know he'd be in in in congregations and you know never was voted for nothing or you know uh never invited over for nothing you know what I mean we was poor stuff like that but he loved the sing and all the we've gotten stuck Through The Years with all the uh eyeballs all all the Castaways and you see a you see a tread here Jesus he love hanging out with those type doesn't he oh yeah all the unres like brother Louise but uh so you know it's a situation to where you know my uh I had that bitterness in my life and you know holding grudges and resentment but you know the the Lord did put Brothers in the church church he put mentors in the church at the time they kind of seen that and they took me under the wings and they talked to me and and um uh they were pretty rough on me too but it was a different kind of love I guess cuz I remember one time I was up in the club me and my wife we was up in the club and uh we like to dance you know Spanish people love to dance but we was up in there dancing I'm swinging her around you know what I mean stuff like that and and I get a phone call and and I don't know do some of you guys know brother Yvonne he's he's a you know brother yvon okay yeah he come he come from lra but he got a church in in New York City right now so he's got it he's got the rough ones out there New York City but uh so anyway he had called me but I was compelled to answer it like I had to answer it you know knowing this is a brother from church and I'm like Dan looking at the phone but I am I said hello brother Vine he said yeah he said you know what Isaac he's like I've been in my prayer room all day and you've been doing nothing but tormenting me that's how they dealt with me straight up they but I like that that's how the Lord knows how I like I like something straight up if I'm in eror just tell me you don't beat around and and then let's fix it so I'm one of them guys I don't you know the back then I had a grudge from against my father but what I'm going to now is the Lord deliver me from that where where that's where I'm headed but so it was a situation to where um he called me he he was saying these things and I sobered up I sobered up immediately I grabbed her hand we went home and I just pondered but I had situations like that throughout my life people call people text right at the right moments you know and it was the Lord that he just stuck in there for me and and he didn't give up on me you know I had a brother tell me one time he said you know brother Isaac God's only obligated to call you once right and that makes him just think about that but for 38 years of my life he just kept wooing and just kept laying in there and just kept he was so patience and long when I read scriptures like longsuffering I that's my guy right so it's a situation to where you know he's stuck in there so you know it's Our obligation to stick in there for others right that's where I'm headed that's that's where I'm headed you know if I can get there but but here's a picture here this was me you know what I mean the Lord was dealing with me when I was 18 but I had that that bitterness my Foundation was right you know what I'm saying when you're serving the lord you got to get it when that light comes on it it Darkness has to go and what I'm trying to say is you know we're coming up through the spirit realm because we're trying to take a body change right that's the goal the Bible says there will be something that will take a body change that's us I believe that so you know it's a situation where um I had something there I had to go back you know what happens is I'm sorry I'm sorry this is the only one good one I could find the guy I ain't got a shirt on so please forgive me um but you know it's a situation where sometimes God's he's going to take you back you got to go back to that you got to we had a men's meeting recently and um what was on my heart was you know sometimes we as uh brothers and sisters we have hurts right you got hurts you got things that's hurting you well that's going to that's an imped on your growth that's an imped on your growth right think about it Jesus Christ was hurt they beat him spit on him called them names he opened up not his mouth right but we quick to say well you you you gave me Injustice or you did this to me or I'm not you know and then that's the impedance on your growth the best thing to do is free yourself from that yeah you know so that's what I did right that's what I did I said I told Brother wait I going be speaking about bitterness but it's going to be me so I hope your church don't get bitter towards me cuz they thinking it's them no it's not I'm just this is my testimony this is what what happened with me right so you know it's a situation to where uh I was going across the bridge uh when I was 18 and we got a bridge we got a couple Bridges there but we were going the Henderson Bridge and the spirit of the Lord came in the in the vehicle the sh of Glory the light the life right and so I'm just driving and he said go oliz to your father I'm like I'm not apologizing to him I ain't do nothing to him he did everything to me you know what I mean I started saying why this and why that the voice came again go apologize to your father and I said yes Lord I went home I walked in the house I was crying by then I walked in the house and Mom's like what's going on cuz my mom will fight for me my mom she she love her babies we could do no wrong you know my wife suffered for that for a while but I feel bad for my wife cuz I was wrong A lot of times my mom be like don't look at them crosy you know my mom she she she in a better place now we'll see her and she going to be sweet when you meet [Music] her she was sweet she was sweet she just her babies you know she was always about her babies so but it was situational where your mom was like that too Lou yeah yeah I go over there to eat and I was already married oh man that offended my wife but you know let's go don't say nothing just eat it you know but anyway cuz you know in Spanish with the Spanish is uh have respects for your elders right you know what I mean it was always it was but I've learned through the years it ain't really like that you know you have respect for them as long as they're on the word when they get off the word you got to stay with the word so now you got a decision to make what you going to do right right but uh anyway so yeah with my dad it was a situation I went home and apologized to Dad and I said Dad I love you I'm sorry for being the son that I had through the years and I was a knucklehead I was a knucklehead I always went against him my brother my brother was the good son he was a good boy he always worked on the house with them the cars I was always out with my friends causing troubles and stuff but but uh you know I went back and apologized but you know that thing left that day and it's never been B Never Been b now now now it's a situation to where if I'm I'm at odds with someone I can't sleep I can't pray you know um I I'll be honest brother Ebenezer that's your name brother yeah brother Ebenezer so what happened was I was telling brother Wade about it what happened was a year AG was it a year ago we were here for Valentine's we were here and and me and brother Ebenezer we walked past each other we made eye contact but I didn't stop I didn't stop to shake your hand brother and that ate at me this whole year I said I can't wait to get down and shake your hand that's why I shook your hand does it make sense now so but you know we made eye contact and I didn't stop that's not you know that wasn't good so I'm glad I was able to make that right brother um so you know it's a situation to where I was looking at what brother brandom says you know he's talking about The Crow and the Dove and he talks he always Associates G of bitterness you guys notice that when you're in your studies with brother brandom there he always talks about a g of bitterness and you know and I was just pondering it and and I started thinking about it and I'm going all the way down to the end of my message here now but you know Jesus Satan always came to T Jesus Satan's Darkness we know that right and he always came to tempt Jesus but even unto his death he tried to give him a gall of bitterness try to put it in his mouth but he wouldn't accept it you know and that's for us right Satan tries to come against us and we got little schisms in the church right now I'm preaching against schisms in the church that's where I'm at because I want the body change and as long as you got schisms in the church and I don't like the color he got on or I don't like how he did this or that this we ain't going to get there it's not about the secrets and the Deep things it's about me dying to myself and preferring those next to me and so that's where I'm at right now so if y'all want to know where my thoughts are and where we're at with the churches I'm just trying to you know uh we had a situation with uh um gossip coming to church recently just in a little church it got the Sheep all skittish all the Sheep are skittish and you can sense it you know brother Wade and brother Samuel I'm sure they can sense it and I don't I don't know some of these ministers here when when you preach to people can you sense sometimes things just falling flat or or you can sense nervousness or things okay so yeah well I'm learning I'm learning these things but you know it's a situation where I'm like I got to get to the bottom of it cuz this is going to kill the church well we got to the bottom of it you know we got it out and we're moving forward now and um we're just grateful and now I'm not saying it ain't going to try to come back right that Bird's gonna fly over but as long we just keep swatting at it you keep swatting at that thing you hit it with the word and don't let it make Roost but uh you know so yeah that's uh kind of what's going on right now but let me see if I got something here usually what I do at at home is I just read they they get I know they get a little weary on it but I'm just so um there's a little more freedom I guess and you know I'm just I'm trying not to look uh like a rookie but uh no there's uh there's been people praying and fasting for this for this day and I'm just grateful for that you know what I mean and and and and and I'm very appreciate appreciative of those things but you know when I was looking at brother Brown talks about Ravens and and doves and stuff did you know Raven and Crow they can hold a grudge up to 5 years they know faces they know language our language and they can hold a grudge but a dove doesn't imagine that brother brandom talks about us being uh like a dove right now you see why you know brother BR talks about if if if if Jesus was walking and he had the spirit of the wolf that Dove would have never came and sat he needed to have that Spirit of a dove gentle sweet right and so that's where we must come to we got there's there's no way around it we got to get we got to we got to die folks you got to become a sacrificial lamb every day and but but the reward is great cuz he's going to rise you up make you Kings and priest right and you'll and you'll judge the you'll judge the Earth but first of all there's work to be done we must judge ourselves and we got to push that Darkness not only out of our soul but out of our spirit realm once we get that out our spirit realm and we're we're good to go and won't be much time I was telling brother Wade I believe this and and you can correct it if you're if I'm wrong brother way but I was telling him yesterday I honestly believe that the fivefold ministry will be done away with when the dead in Christ rise there'll be nothing else left we done merged the dimensions you know what I mean so and in that and in that I also believe that God's going to show Satan one full moon cycle 30 to 40 days that in time I had a wife a bride that defeated you so you take it for what it is you check in what your pastor but that's what I believe that because I I was I was pondering and questioning why did Jesus say 30 why did why why was it 3040 days well according to the Jewish calendar they're big on moon cycles every 30 days that's their that's their calendar so why what what does the Jewish have to do with us well you know there's types right we know there there's types but yeah I believe that so and then after that it's going home time I was telling brother Wade in there I said man I said as nervous as I am right now I'm so glad I met you I'm so glad that in God's thoughts that he had brother Boyd he had brother brother Wade all the brothers here and uh what's your brother dhy is that brother dhy brother dhy okay brother D with brother Kylie brother Kylie you know what God's thoughts he says is I'm going to have all these Fine Brothers together and we'll be we won't be separated Brother Anderson and brother John brother John man you been you been hitting me with some Financial uh yeah I like it man keep keep hitting us you know we don't think of things like that oh no man before we go home we got to have every we got to have light on everything there can't be no darkness in your wallet you can't be hiding no you know no bills you got to shed light on all I'm paid up all right let's go you know so um what's the time okay all right all right Lord just keep helping me 2 Thessalonians 28 it says for the mystery of iniquity doth already work only he who now lth will let until he be taken out of the way and then shall the wicked be revealed you see that how's the wicked GNA be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming you see that's why it's important for us to shed the light on for for the spirit of God to be in us right through the new birth us working up through the stature up in the spirit realm you know and that's important for us to have that the new spirit you know I I had uh painted a picture for the guys uh there at back at home I had a a high way on the highway I had 50 mph which it probably should be about 75 mph or 70 mph but I said that's the letter see the letter the letter kth right but the spirit gives life and so what I had was I had two cars driving one at 70 M obeying the speed limit right that's the new birth that's the new spirit your obedience in obedience right there's no law to to a person that's in obedience but then I had a guy speeding down with with his nice little red convertible going 100 mph see that man's going to wind up killing somebody killing himself right so we must have a new spirit so it says here uh it says and and brother brandom speaking here says and a dove I want to tell you something a dove does not find water for a bath think about that you don't have to go searching for the Holy Spirit out here somewhere it's in you God gave you everything you need to grow and for cleansing right it says here it says did you ever pick up a little D rub your hand over him he's oily there's something from the inside comes out and keeps him clean oh my his body's oil from from oil from the inside coming out amen I don't want to get started on that I'll get off my subject but he keeps his body his feathers his garments clean inside and out now you know you see here this garments he keeps him clean inside and out he was he's wearing white garments but he's white from the inside out you know we just went through I was telling brother way we just went through the church he just we just finished them up and uh in Le O deia the the sheep from that region Beed black wool and so Leo de sea was very rich so in those times they wore black and and it it's very fitting because it's a situation where I actually know an architect who's very wealthy he all he vers is black because it's a it's a symbol of status you know what I mean and so U that's why God challenges him a white ra a white rment because they wore black back then maybe when you guys get into it I don't know way said he was going to be going through but uh yeah I found it interesting too hopefully I'm not telling too much about it but I found it interesting is you know the the Bible says you're lukewarm right well what happened was they ran out of water they had money cuz they were the banking system they had money but they didn't have water so hopis a city above them hopis had a hot spring and a city below them colasse where the book of Colossians was written they had a Cold Spring and so what they did was they helped Leo de out by pumping water to Leo deia by the time it got there it was lukewarm and and and what happened was calcium were build up so now became toxic so a lukewarm chrisan sitting in the pews is the toxic understand that so I leave that with you you clean that up no but you know but listen we should be we should always be looking at ourselves right or self-reflecting is good the problem is we we look at other people's mirrors what you dressing what you doing you know what I mean look at ourselves now is the time for us to judge ourselves according to the scriptures so that you may be a good judge when the time comes right there'll be nothing you know the Lord he going to be he Lord the Lord going to be he's just going to be so excited and happy he's going to be looking over there you did good look at you oh yeah you judged it just like I judged it Adam named the animals just like he would name them right so he's going to look at you and say that's exactly that you get a A+ on that I didn't see too many A+ is growing up but hopefully I'll get a A+ yeah I was telling somebody I graduated with a 1.8 GPA I did I didn't care about school I slept on the desk like this uh they gave me homework I folded it up put in my back pocket my mom my mom where all this paper coming from you know what I mean all Crum you know how you get crumbled up paper but you know it's a situation where I'll give my wife some more roses we met in um in the 10th grade 11th grade and uh she she seen it you know I was always sleeping didn't really care about much and stuff like that and I just I just grew up late I just sprouted late I guess but you know she said what are you going to do when you when we graduate get married I got I got sobered up like wow she right you know but I started pondering it and I said well if you if you tutor me back you know uh I'll do my best and so she tutored me back and man I graduate like my math teacher gave me like two points so I can graduate but yeah he got me out of they got me out of there and it seemed like wherever I go my wife's always you know you can do it and then she pushed me but uh uh yeah you know become I just had low self-esteem you know grew up poor you know didn't didn't do well with with with grades and and testing and um I was I was like a stick you know I was real skinny I had Buck tape stuff like that always got shoved in carbage can you know things like that you growing up it just kills you it just murders you you know and um but uh you know but I ever since the Lord healed me from that bitterness I was telling you about years later I seen both them bullies that did that to me one was at the I used to have I used to own a business so I had season tickets at the Cavs up there LeBron James y'all know LeBron James yeah but uh so you know I was there at one time and we sat there and uh this gentleman that was one of my bullies he was sitting right over kitty corner right here like that I said David Noble he's like Richard and so we just can't give each other hug was just talking and smiling I gave him I said man I'm glad you was my bully man he just come he was like no come on don't don't say that you know he's all embar I said no man you know it it taught me something it taught me to love harder you know I remember playing football one time and we had a a young man there and he was a big boy he couldn't move fast he was just a big boy but you know the Lord was starting to teach me something and I and and you know back then I was you know wide receiver f ass you know you know the two step burn somebody and go but you know a situation where this this this man would never get the football so I told the quarterback I said let me quarterback so we pulled the huddle together I said look I want all y'all to go this way and then I looked at that gentleman who never got the ball I said and then you go that way so they they drew everybody that way and I hit big man we hit him he started running nobody could tackle him I said why don't we hitting this guy you know what I mean cuz there people just bouncing off him left or right I said man we we got a power here we need to utilize that but you see the good things that come out of what sometimes we perceive like well he's built for that or he's fit for that and God used something totally different you know we just got to have that heart we got to had a heart like Ryan B Ryan uh how you say your last name Bonnie man I told Ryan one time last year I met him I said man I wish I was like you he's just a sweet man you know God bless you brother but uh yeah I told I promise my wife I'm going to be like Ryan one of these days I'm working on it huh I'm working on it I'm be so sweet what' you say wait mirac miracles happen yeah you know we're all built different I'm you know like I said sometimes your life the way your raise forms and shapes you but that's not an excuse right it's not an excuse like you know people come to church the way they you come to church the way you are but you ain't going to stay that way right if you're growing you're going to see growth you know and and that that's something we've been seeing with brother uh brother Franklin he's been he's been right there next to me and and and I just love him having them there and he's got a lot of questions Daniel 70 weeks I'm like I don't know all that yet man give me some time I don't been preaching since Jan or April so you know I'll be honest with you guys I don't know everything I don't but just keep me in prayer that in my studies I've been trying to dedicate well I've been dedicating pretty much every day I get off of work I'm still working and um I get off work and I try to go to the basement for uh two hours a night and and try to get studies in because you know you want to put out a good product be honest with you you don't put out a good product the people will know you know and and I'm not saying a product in in a bad way understand what I'm saying you know um I I owned a business for 14 years I was a contractor electrical but you know when you look back on your life the Lord put you through things and build you certain way because there's something going to happen up here somewhere so you may question those things you know what I mean but don't question them just walk in it just walking it you know if you do anything pray this that you found favor in God Amen and whatever else happens from there let it be he'll work it out so you know uh now that I'm thinking about brother Christian brother Christian went down to the mission Fields with brother Lis recently and he come back with a big old smile on his face and he's like I think I found my calling I said Amen brother we're going to support you as long as we need to and as long as it's on your heart that's another thing don't do something you know if it if you don't have the fire for it you know I I I got to 14 years in business I got I got tired of working out in the cold you know up north it's cold so I got tired of put my car hearts on and the you know the you know what I'm talking about so one day I woke up but my wife's funny because for about 6 years I had complain I come home complain in winter time and she like go be an inspector go be an electrical inspector and I'm like H you don't realize they up here I'm over here they smart they in the books and yeah I can't achieve that and there she go pussing pussing pussing and about 6 years later I woke up one day I said H I think I'm about to let go be an inspector so I started studying yeah I started studying and then uh uh for about nine months I was studying and each test was $200 and there was two-part test uh residential commercial and um I went and took the test and and I remember uh walking into the test and uh the first one I I flunked three hours later I flunked it so I started getting a little weird you know man Hy I told you and go back and take it again so I went back took it again I passed it and then the commercial one came up I went and took that one I flung that one three times so about $1,200 later became an inspector but so but it it's a beautiful it's a beautiful job I do love it it's it's a you know I get to work with the craft still to trade and I get to talk to people I love talking to people meeting people I'm always waiting for an open door you know somebody's always struggling you know recently I had a a a young man at in Toledo Ohio Toledo is a very very rough neighborhood and um I was out there in Toledo and this man was in a wheelchair and uh I was talking to him and he was like we were talking and uh I was like can I ask you a question can I ask you why you in that wheelchair he said yeah man I just got shot three months ago three months ago yeah I was working on the house some guy came up to me to rob me I went like this to pull up he thought I was pulling a pistol out so he shot me young kid and uh it separate his spine and he became paraplegic paraplegic and I said well can I leave you with something I says he I said when you going to court he said I think I was like it was supposed to be like a month or something I said can I leave you with this I says whatever you do find it in your heart to forgive that man I says because if you hold on to a grudge and you hold on to the bitterness that this man shot you you gave him the win but if you can forgive this man and you move forward not only that you're free from that but now you didn't impede your walk with God and so he's looking at me listening like I like I had his attention you know and I said another thing too wear gloves go out get you some gloves because I got a buddy that his hands are gone and his rotator cuffs are gone and he's about giving up on life he's older now he's 60 maybe 65 67 or something oh 60 about 60 yeah it's my dad's best friend but so you know it's a situation where I gave him some advice on those things and and it's nice that when you can wait for opportunities and wait for times you know we should always be instant in season and out of season but you got to be prayed up you got to be your spirit's got to be right cuz people know people know you know and when you're talking to somebody you know you can sense when when uh my brother's won so pretty soon you going to get out of time Elisha you going to get out of time but when my brother's stressed out about time and I get next to him man it's like the magnets that push away from each other cuz I used to the reason why I know I know that is cuz when I was in business I was that way there's not enough time in a day you're trying to always you know you call the customer order materials you're thinking about the job tomorrow your wife's at the table and you're just your mind's gone you know what I I mean so you're stressed up because you care good business owners they don't have much time right good Christians they don't have much time to waste you understand what I'm saying so it's a situation to where yeah so I said we I give them a hug though you all right man yeah and then you start to feel that thing die out a little bit then the magnet turns around and it comes back together all right we in one Spirit again but anyway so I think I'll close on that brother Wade so what do I do next oh musicians all right musicians come on up [Applause] amen oh you may stand I'm sorry you may stand I'm G move out I know I'm going here excuse me that's life that's life and as a Christian you see them even from the couple years we've known them and you see that there's number one is it's it's honesty that way all the time not hiding nothing we ain't better than nobody else we come right through the same situations that everybody else come through maybe a little different way but we all come from somewhere but once you become a Christian you know where you're going yes that world don't know where they going Franklin you know that see see brother Franklin he was in the Army right wh which war was that you Iraq Iraq he was in Iraq saw a lot of his friends get get get blown up he'd go this direction they go that direction they' all get killed or or man you go this way wasn't your fault brother that was God turning that hummer this way to get you here today do you believe that it wasn't your fault these people got blew up got blown up no that's just man that's man's stuff but God turned you in that direction to get you here cuz he knew when you got here you'd want it more than anything in the world to me predestination is so simple God knew you'd want it he had it here for you and you took it you accepted it and if we take all the other Frills out that's true Christianity to know that God got you to a place to where he could talk to you amen many many people he may have talked to them along the way they didn't listen but Frank you listen you just keep going buddy you just keep you just keep plugging on don't if if the devil says something to you you know he's lying okay I just make sure when he moves his mouth he's lying okay all right so you just keep that and this afternoon sister Tabitha is going to speak for us cuz she's the one that's pushing this guy here listen behind every good man is a is is a good wife absolutely a good wife amen so thank God for sister Tabitha that uh helped our brother and uh then we got um sister Melissa helping this guy back here amen I I I appreciate them playing um songs for us and and stepping in while brother Richard's not here and brother Aaron and remember that family keep him in prayer the one that lost lost his brother-in-law real suddenly this past weekend but remember Nicole the wife she's she's going to probably go home today to an empty house so we don't we don't question God but sometimes we wonder but still it's part of our journey it's like you follow your journey I I was hoping you was following your journey when he was following telling you about he you were following your journey how God did the same thing to you we've all had bitterness we've all had things that we've held grudges and held them and held them and held them and if You' have got rid of them first you wouldn't had near as much problem as you do now just get rid of those things just get them out of the way and press on with God and I love that song they saying unto thee Oh Lord do I lift up my soul not the world not the devil I lift up my soul lord cuz listen he's a soul saer he he's a Soul Saver he has saved your soul give you the new birth and then we walk in god so let's sing a song real quick and then we'll we'll come back together 2:00 brother
