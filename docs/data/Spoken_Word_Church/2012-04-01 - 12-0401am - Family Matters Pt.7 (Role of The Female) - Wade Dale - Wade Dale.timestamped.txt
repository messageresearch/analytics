[6:23] you know they're not behind on that
[6:25] stuff they just don't have anything they
[6:26] just they just take their sermons by
[6:28] audio and that's it so it's going to be
[6:30] an undertaking that's that's kind of the
[6:32] way we started so and just remember too
[6:35] that we're going to be speaking now on
[6:37] the role of the female we're going to
[6:38] maybe just for a moment we're going to
[6:40] background for those some of you that
[6:42] are not here
[6:44] um
[6:45] i hope everybody that wasn't here last
[6:46] sunday listen to brother dale sermon
[6:49] if you didn't
[6:52] he was talking about youtube
[6:55] me too all of us and we're going to
[6:57] cover that this afternoon because the
[6:59] bible talks about adorning
[7:03] ornament of great price the bible says
[7:05] here we're going to read it
[7:07] listen
[7:09] let's pray before we get started
[7:11] heavenly father we pray lord that you
[7:12] will just touch us now
[7:14] be with us lord be an active participant
[7:17] in the service father not a bystander
[7:18] not a recorder because
[7:20] lord recording our actions in words lord
[7:23] are not good enough father but if the
[7:24] holy spirit would come and take over the
[7:26] service and say what needs to be said
[7:28] lord
[7:29] and let the hearers hear what needs to
[7:31] be heard and see what needs to be seen
[7:33] and then lord let us take it and apply
[7:35] it to our life and go back home and
[7:38] and use these things that you give us to
[7:39] guide lord you give us a bible the open
[7:41] book lord
[7:42] to guide us and lead us through every
[7:45] aspect of our life we pray now as we
[7:47] speak about the role of the female or
[7:49] the wife in the in the family that you
[7:52] would just lord just do it with eyesight
[7:54] lord just do it with
[7:56] with reverence and meekness that we
[7:58] should lord towards you because we're
[7:59] all feminine in the body of christ so as
[8:02] we speak today lord may we may we
[8:04] realize in the back of our head that
[8:06] that we truly are the bride of jesus
[8:08] christ and we need to act the same way
[8:10] that that we we say that our sister
[8:13] should act from scripture and from the
[8:14] prophet's message lord may that be
[8:17] applied to all of our lives more
[8:19] male and female we're all female in the
[8:21] body of christ being the bride of jesus
[8:23] christ and then you speak very highly
[8:25] over lord so lord i know that there's a
[8:27] group of people that is getting their
[8:29] self ready lord
[8:30] a bride that will adorn herself in
[8:32] meekness and and a wonderful spirit lord
[8:35] and do the right things of god
[8:37] father we pray should forgive us of our
[8:39] sins and many mistakes lord be with the
[8:41] foreign mission field bless them father
[8:43] give them fruit for their labor or be
[8:45] with the ones that are not here that you
[8:46] touch them be with you lord as she
[8:48] travels back tomorrow that you'll give
[8:50] her a blessing father and sister
[8:52] brother benny's wife lord just bless her
[8:54] lord and the ones that are not here or
[8:56] may you bring them back into the full
[8:57] lord and be really in a good safe
[8:59] condition and let them be rested
[9:01] and lord let them be lord a life for you
[9:04] wherever they are
[9:05] father just be with us bless us keep us
[9:07] safe we ask these things in jesus name
[9:10] amen now i'm going to read out the
[9:12] dialogue again so you can just follow
[9:13] along for those of you that are not
[9:15] familiar this the diagonal is the actual
[9:18] writings of scripture straight from the
[9:20] scrolls not the king james version it
[9:22] comes verbatim off of the dead sea
[9:24] scrolls right onto the book
[9:26] and then king james took it and put it
[9:29] into the form that you see now
[9:31] we're not saying this is wrong
[9:33] but
[9:34] and it is it's right it's ordained
[9:36] that's the way it should be but i'm
[9:37] going to read out the dialogue because
[9:39] sometimes the dialogue gives you just a
[9:40] little
[9:41] different not a different meaning but a
[9:43] different angle on the same meaning all
[9:44] right chapter three verse one
[9:47] and like matter let wives be subject to
[9:50] their own husband
[9:52] so that if some are disobedient to the
[9:54] word
[9:55] they may without a word
[9:57] be gained through the conduct of their
[9:59] wives
[10:01] having seen your conduct chaste with
[10:03] fear
[10:04] whose decoration let it not be that
[10:07] external one abrading the hair and
[10:10] putting on gold chains or wearing of
[10:12] apparel
[10:13] but decorate the hidden of the heart you
[10:15] know why because if you decorate the
[10:16] hidden amount of the heart first he'll
[10:18] decorate the outside that's right all
[10:20] right so you got to understand one thing
[10:22] if we're not decorating the outside
[10:24] right something's wrong on the inside
[10:26] all right
[10:28] but decorate the hidden man of the heart
[10:30] with what is incorruptible
[10:33] what is it a meek and quiet spirit which
[10:35] is very precious in the sight of god
[10:38] we're going to cover that this afternoon
[10:39] probably not this morning a meek and
[10:41] quiet spirit which is very precious in
[10:43] the sight of god
[10:45] for thus formally
[10:47] also those holy women
[10:49] man women can be holy too
[10:53] who hoped in god adorned themselves
[10:55] being subject to their own husbands
[10:58] as sarah obeyed abraham calling him lord
[11:01] whose children ye are become
[11:04] doing good and not fearing any terror
[11:06] now here we go verse seven in like
[11:08] matter husbands dwell according to
[11:11] knowledge with the female as the weaker
[11:14] vessel
[11:15] bestowing honor as being also joint
[11:18] heirs of the gracious gift
[11:20] of life in order that your prayers
[11:23] may not be hindered and you may be seen
[11:24] the lord has blessing to the reason of
[11:26] the word that your prayers
[11:28] be not hindered now we're gonna we're
[11:30] gonna do a little
[11:32] background
[11:36] on this
[11:37] with
[11:38] back to genesis 3 16.
[11:42] to pull up genesis 3 16 we've got we got
[11:44] to cover how this all
[11:46] come about
[11:48] genesis 3 16 remember there was what
[11:51] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[11:52] multiply by sorrow
[11:54] and thy conception this is after the
[11:57] fall this is after what happened in the
[11:59] garden of eden
[12:01] excuse me
[12:03] multiply that sort of thy conception in
[12:05] sorrow thou shalt bring four children
[12:06] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[12:09] and he shall rule over there right all
[12:12] right now for our visitors we don't it's
[12:14] not ruling like with an iron fist or a
[12:16] ruling with with a uh with a strong arm
[12:20] rule with love just how you want jesus
[12:22] to treat you that's how you need to
[12:24] treat your wife and just how your wife
[12:26] acts towards you you should act toward
[12:28] god all right so but we're going to try
[12:30] to stay with the natural it's real hard
[12:31] when you get to the female
[12:34] because the female types the bride so
[12:35] much man
[12:36] the spiritual bride
[12:38] that you try to move over sometimes in
[12:40] the spiritual angles but we got to stay
[12:42] here because wives
[12:43] you must be subject to your husband amen
[12:46] and then in genesis 3 16 that brought in
[12:49] what did it bring in it brought in a
[12:50] double covenant right amen the double
[12:53] covenant right
[12:55] man god
[12:58] man
[12:59] female god male female
[13:01] all right used to be god and
[13:04] looking at them and even they were the
[13:05] same right right co-equal joint heirs
[13:08] that's what we're going back to that's
[13:09] what it says right here in in first
[13:11] peter it says we're going back to being
[13:12] joined heir
[13:13] man with god so the double covenant
[13:16] though is that the female
[13:18] the actor that was in the garden of eden
[13:19] the female comes under the mail and
[13:21] according to scripture she is to obey
[13:24] her husband all right and he is to be
[13:26] her headship or her head all right then
[13:29] we come down and show them the
[13:31] three-dimensional love which was body
[13:33] spirit and soul i just want to kind of
[13:35] go over these a little bit
[13:37] body spirit and soul that in body and
[13:40] spirit you can you can
[13:42] um many things can happen between a man
[13:44] and a woman in the body and spirit
[13:46] but if you're one and soul you both have
[13:48] to be born again by the incorruptible
[13:50] word of god
[13:52] to truly be one
[13:54] in body and spirit you can just like
[13:56] each other you can just you can get
[13:58] along with each other you can just be
[14:00] happy with each other you see people out
[14:02] in the world that are just sinners and
[14:05] be mad 60 years and be just as happy why
[14:08] because they've got that filial love in
[14:09] their body and spirit but to have a
[14:11] godly love to have the love of god you
[14:14] must have the love of jesus christ
[14:15] inside your heart right you must have
[14:17] something inside on the inside
[14:19] that truly when adam and eve were one
[14:24] remember he she was inside of him she
[14:26] was truly one right because she was
[14:29] flesh from his flesh and bone of his
[14:30] bone because god took a piece of his
[14:32] flesh and made a female now you and i if
[14:36] you're married today that's not true
[14:38] when you and i
[14:39] but we become that amen right by the
[14:42] word of god the fall took us away
[14:45] but by the grace of god and by the
[14:47] baptism of the holy ghost in our soul it
[14:49] brings us back together as one so truly
[14:52] you can't be husband and wife
[14:57] without both of you having the new birth
[14:58] right that's right in christ i said you
[15:00] can be one you be all right in the world
[15:02] and you can do this you can tolerate
[15:04] each other but the reason a lot of
[15:06] divorces happen is they get it in the
[15:08] body they get in the spirit together but
[15:12] they never get it in the soul
[15:13] man
[15:14] because two people with the baptism of
[15:16] the holy ghost you might not get along
[15:17] with each other but there won't be any
[15:19] divorce in your mind
[15:22] god don't god's not going to divorce why
[15:24] what if god just divorced us because one
[15:25] day we did something wrong
[15:30] come on people proud of him
[15:32] same way with your wife
[15:34] but if she's a godly woman you're godly
[15:36] man
[15:38] things will work out even the bible says
[15:40] you can separate for a time
[15:42] right we're not going to cover that
[15:44] right now that's in the family part but
[15:45] it's you can separate
[15:48] bible says separate stay away from each
[15:50] other for a little while but come back
[15:52] together amen all right so we'll cover
[15:54] that a little bit later but i just want
[15:56] you to realize that that it's not that
[15:58] we're so much of this great high person
[16:00] with a lot of mentality like daddy said
[16:02] there's a lot of you women and i i want
[16:04] to share this with you that sister
[16:06] collins told us there was a brother
[16:08] arnett i don't know if you remember him
[16:10] or not but he had a uh she was telling
[16:12] us that the last time we went down the
[16:13] preach forum
[16:15] she said brother arnett got a personal
[16:17] interview with brother brown him and his
[16:19] wife
[16:20] went into the room with brother brown
[16:22] and brother arnett and his wife and
[16:24] brother brown started bringing things
[16:26] out in his life
[16:27] and said brother did you need to let go
[16:30] of the finances and let her handle them
[16:32] said you can't handle money
[16:34] yep and she told this that he said that
[16:37] this is true
[16:38] brother you can't have money and said
[16:40] you will never be successful if you keep
[16:42] handling the money
[16:43] you need to let her handle the money do
[16:44] you know the man walked out
[16:47] never let his wife
[16:49] handled the money
[16:50] and died broke yeah
[16:53] yeah i wouldn't even went to the
[16:54] interview if i wasn't going to listen
[16:56] to what somebody says and i i'm going to
[16:58] cover it a little bit this afternoon
[16:59] maybe a little harsh but i'm going to
[17:00] give you a little part of it there's a
[17:02] southern spirit in this church oh yeah
[17:05] yeah there's a stubborn spirit in this
[17:07] church
[17:08] there's also a spirit of incontinence in
[17:10] this church
[17:11] where people do this while the
[17:12] preacher's preaching it's not that's not
[17:14] part of god's word i don't care how
[17:16] spiritual you think you are
[17:17] you don't have to preach and preach
[17:21] what somebody say man
[17:23] you don't have to preach and preach
[17:25] that's according to god's word and
[17:27] according to the prophet so you can deal
[17:28] with him not me that's why we're gonna
[17:30] read a lot of quotes you can deal with
[17:31] him not me right all right you'll have
[17:34] to give account for your actions
[17:36] remember last sunday amen all right now
[17:39] listen headship of the man ephesians 5
[17:41] and 23
[17:43] where the husband is the head of the
[17:44] wife even as christ is the head of the
[17:46] church and he is the savior
[17:49] of the body
[17:52] people this is why
[17:54] i wanted to do this amen
[17:58] because
[17:58] we have a stubborn spirit in his church
[18:02] you're not going to change
[18:04] god's the only person who's going to
[18:05] change it
[18:06] brother dale's preached this for 40
[18:08] years
[18:10] and we get worse
[18:11] and worse
[18:13] and worse
[18:16] talk about adorning i was standing with
[18:17] one of you that's in this sanctuary
[18:19] today at a fellowship meet down here
[18:21] downstairs
[18:22] turn around look at your wife bent down
[18:24] in the refrigerator and this much of her
[18:27] skin was showing from her top to her
[18:29] dress
[18:31] and you just sit there and looked at it
[18:32] and i don't think he did anything about
[18:34] it last sunday this pulpit should have
[18:35] been so packed with people
[18:38] asking forgiveness but no we're so far
[18:41] up in the headstone so we don't have to
[18:42] give forgiveness anymore
[18:44] no if i have to act like some of the way
[18:46] y'all people act
[18:48] i don't want it
[18:49] i don't want it man
[18:51] i do not want it man
[18:55] our actions speak louder than our words
[18:59] all right
[19:00] i'm not mad i'm just i just want us to
[19:02] get this stubborn spirit out of the way
[19:05] out of here
[19:06] all right
[19:08] initiate remember we we watched the the
[19:11] five things that we that we showed we'll
[19:14] get started on the woman in a minute
[19:15] but the the male is to initiate or have
[19:18] the initiative in other words be the
[19:20] forerunner be the one that not has the
[19:22] better idea
[19:24] not has the first idea
[19:26] but has the last say right man you know
[19:29] i've always said you know
[19:31] in joking that you i mean
[19:33] you men should always have the final
[19:35] voice in them
[19:37] in an argument yes ma'am yeah yes dear
[19:40] but that's just in joking yeah no when
[19:42] you come together right you need to
[19:44] decide as one man
[19:47] if you decide is one you you know what
[19:48] happens if you decide is one you can't
[19:51] later two weeks later and say
[19:53] you said this was your fault
[19:55] well
[19:57] initiate
[19:59] you take the initiative right
[20:01] govern means to rule direct or strongly
[20:04] influence the action of another we're
[20:06] supposed to govern over our house govern
[20:08] over our
[20:09] children and govern over even you
[20:11] sisters should come down into this place
[20:14] to govern over the children that god
[20:16] gave you all right the house
[20:18] and be responsible
[20:20] today you should take as many notes as
[20:23] the sister sitting beside of you
[20:26] because she won't ever have to give an
[20:28] account for what you do right but you're
[20:30] going to give an account for everything
[20:32] that she does man
[20:34] so you need to be paying attention to
[20:36] this thing where you can go fishing or
[20:37] something yeah
[20:39] right brother here
[20:41] cranch where are you at you fall over
[20:44] okay way back in the
[20:46] bag responsible for your actions and
[20:49] hurt both male and female should listen
[20:51] to this
[20:53] then what was he to rule by rule by the
[20:55] word because the word is our headship
[20:58] if your husband tells you not to go to
[21:00] church if he tells you you got to start
[21:03] doing this that's not according to the
[21:05] word of god he then it's not your head
[21:08] amen
[21:09] the word is the ultimate head and what
[21:11] we're talking about today is going to be
[21:14] straight from the word of god in the
[21:15] prophet's message all right
[21:17] rule by the word of god if he's not if
[21:20] he's not a born-again christian
[21:22] if he allows you to go into church the
[21:23] bible says hey
[21:26] go on yeah because you will be the one
[21:29] that probably will get him
[21:32] to start coming to church man not a
[21:34] bunch of other people going around
[21:35] because you're the closest to him
[21:37] right
[21:38] remember the the example about the
[21:40] sister that
[21:41] the husband was a drunk and had
[21:43] tried to stop drinking and he was trying
[21:45] to get converted but he still had his
[21:47] old drinking buddy and they came back
[21:49] home and he said my wife's a real
[21:51] christian another guy said i she'll
[21:53] she'll break somewhere you know we will
[21:55] break and my husband said you just
[21:56] watched this so they went in like they
[21:58] were drunk you know and sat down and the
[22:00] wife fixed them dinner and said the
[22:02] husband slapped it off into the floor
[22:04] and and said woman you can't fix nothing
[22:06] and walks out you know when they run
[22:08] around the house and look into the
[22:09] window
[22:11] and she's cleaning the floor
[22:14] singing much jesus may of the cross
[22:16] alone
[22:17] and all the world go free she didn't
[22:19] just save her husband the boy the boy
[22:21] that was with her husband got saved
[22:23] all right so see there you sisters have
[22:25] a real big part in this amen and then
[22:28] also we as males should be the servant
[22:30] leader
[22:31] what sir
[22:33] she's not a doormat
[22:36] servant leader
[22:38] right amen all right now look
[22:41] let's read this comment first and then
[22:43] we'll start on a few close the woman
[22:45] female or wife
[22:46] all interchangeable except if you don't
[22:48] have a husband take the wife part out
[22:51] all right needs to know what god expects
[22:53] of her her husband needs to understand
[22:55] her role also because it says you gotta
[22:57] dwell with what wisdom and understanding
[23:00] in other words you gotta dwell with
[23:01] knowledge right
[23:03] we gotta have knowledge
[23:05] of your position right because remember
[23:09] you're responsible she's not right
[23:12] needs to understand her role also
[23:14] the male is told to dwell with her
[23:16] according to knowledge and that's what
[23:18] we're going to try today to try to give
[23:21] some of us men i'm talking about me too
[23:23] that needs to be a little more
[23:26] in tune with what our wife's supposed to
[23:27] do
[23:28] the men should take as many notes as the
[23:30] female because the man is responsible
[23:31] for her actions and as a leader ahead it
[23:34] is your role to help her correct her
[23:37] action
[23:38] don't do this don't do this bless god
[23:40] you hear him you go get straightened out
[23:42] no no
[23:43] that puts it as one right
[23:46] this is a
[23:48] one like this man
[23:49] exactly
[23:51] you see something in your your wife's
[23:53] life
[23:54] gina always asked me when she put
[23:56] something on for the first time she says
[23:58] how does this look
[24:00] that's the first thing she does how does
[24:01] this look and i've told her many times
[24:03] that maybe she needs to put a
[24:05] something white under like sister went
[24:06] you know put something on underneath
[24:08] because they're always stuff cut low but
[24:10] you can always wear something underneath
[24:13] or does this match or you know not match
[24:15] but does my slip show or or
[24:18] thank god
[24:21] women you ought to put you
[24:23] down in here
[24:25] tuck it in
[24:27] if you don't it's going to tuck out yeah
[24:30] and i don't want to see that part
[24:35] remember you will answer for your wife's
[24:36] actions right she won't have to answer
[24:39] for yours
[24:40] exactly right
[24:41] but that will be okay
[24:44] now let's go to genesis
[24:46] 2-18
[24:48] and the lord god said it is not good
[24:50] that the man should be alone i will make
[24:52] him and help meet
[24:54] for him
[24:57] do you realize who did that god
[25:01] give adam i helped me
[25:05] adam i know i didn't have a choice to
[25:07] choose who she was
[25:09] but god's give you a help me right right
[25:12] if you really believe it
[25:15] you don't believe you just like you know
[25:16] body and spirit running around here you
[25:18] know with no uh
[25:20] um new birth then you know get born
[25:23] again right i know we all started out
[25:25] most of us started out without the new
[25:26] birth when we were married amen that's
[25:28] where our problems begin
[25:30] all right but our problems will end
[25:32] if we get the new birth while we're born
[25:35] right right
[25:36] isn't that right amen right
[25:38] isn't that right
[25:39] i like that smiling that's right because
[25:41] it will
[25:42] will it take care of every problem no
[25:46] i'm sorry am i too loud
[25:48] what are you doing sitting up here
[25:50] no space back there okay all right
[25:53] mr milk i'm gonna blow her away sitting
[25:55] up here
[25:57] sister sitting on the front row in the
[25:58] role of the woman
[26:03] you love the lord
[26:05] man go to first corinthians 11.
[26:12] now this is we're not going to cover
[26:14] your sisters ought to know you shouldn't
[26:15] cut your hair because the bible tells
[26:17] you not to
[26:18] but let's cover the aspect of what's
[26:20] inside all this
[26:22] every man praying or prophesying having
[26:24] his head covered dishonest his head
[26:27] that's why you look around
[26:30] brothers don't have long hair amen okay
[26:33] but every woman that prays or prophesies
[26:35] with her head uncovered that doesn't
[26:38] mean wearing a hat right
[26:40] because you'll see them down here a
[26:41] little bit further
[26:43] uncovered dishonest her head not her
[26:46] natural head
[26:49] she dishonors her husband
[26:52] not her natural head she doesn't
[26:54] dishonor her natural head she dishonors
[26:56] her natural her husband all right
[26:59] for that is even all one as she we're
[27:01] shaving
[27:02] she's going to cut her hair you might as
[27:04] well shave it
[27:05] for if the woman be not covered
[27:07] let her also be shorn but if it be a
[27:09] shame
[27:10] it be a shame for a woman to be shorn or
[27:12] shaven
[27:13] let her be covered right for a man
[27:16] indeed ought not to cover his head for
[27:18] as much as he is the image and glory of
[27:20] god
[27:21] but the woman is the glory of the man
[27:25] we're going to look into adorning what
[27:26] do we do adorning means putting things
[27:28] on right problem is with this age people
[27:31] are taking things
[27:32] off not putting things on right right
[27:36] but a man is not of the woman
[27:39] but the woman of the man amen
[27:41] neither was the man created for the
[27:43] woman
[27:45] but the woman was created for the man
[27:48] right listen to this for this cause and
[27:51] we're going to get into this in just a
[27:52] little bit
[27:53] for this cause all the woman to have
[27:56] power on her head now natural not power
[27:59] over
[28:01] us
[28:02] power on her head this is talking
[28:04] natural because the power comes from us
[28:06] showing what like brother dale said what
[28:08] are you showing the world right all
[28:10] right this calls out the woman have
[28:12] power on her head because of the angels
[28:14] and we'll get into that in just a little
[28:15] bit brother brown covers that now we're
[28:16] going to read some quotes for those of
[28:18] you that are new here i'm not going to
[28:19] try to explain this too much but
[28:22] you know there was prophets and there
[28:23] was
[28:24] uh in the old testament and prophets in
[28:26] the new testament well i believe there
[28:28] was a prophet in the end time we all
[28:29] believe that that a man named william
[28:31] branham was vindicated of god
[28:34] vindicated messenger right he didn't
[28:36] just have a healing campaign he had a
[28:38] message behind it
[28:40] and this message we believe was not
[28:42] another interpretation of the bible but
[28:44] it was a clear interpretation of what
[28:46] the bible already said
[28:48] because he didn't say anything outside
[28:50] the bible all right amen
[28:52] all right
[28:53] so we're going to read a couple of
[28:54] quotes here number one
[28:56] now this kind of just sets the stage for
[28:58] it right here
[28:59] now a woman is not meant this is from a
[29:01] phantom church age now woman is not
[29:03] meant to have an iron disposition
[29:06] she is according to the holy scripture
[29:09] to be submissive to the male that is
[29:12] commanded of her woman who is truly
[29:14] female all film female will be of that
[29:17] disposition
[29:19] not a doormat
[29:20] no real male makes a female a doormat
[29:24] but she will want
[29:27] circle that want
[29:30] she will want to be under authority
[29:33] right
[29:34] and not rule over the mail
[29:37] for he is the head of the house
[29:39] if she breaks that image
[29:41] that god made for her she's perverted
[29:43] right
[29:45] he's perverted right email that lets the
[29:48] woman take authority he's also broken
[29:51] that image what the devil covenant right
[29:55] and he is perverted right
[29:59] that's why a woman cannot wear that
[30:00] which pertaining to the man or cut her
[30:02] hair right you say well
[30:04] let me ask you a
[30:06] question i know most of you know this
[30:09] but
[30:09] when you walk up to a bathroom
[30:13] a woman's not supposed to wear pants
[30:15] and she's the way you tell a male from a
[30:18] female
[30:20] should be the way they direct right
[30:22] what the bible says
[30:24] now if you walk into a bat into a
[30:26] mcdonald's
[30:27] and you look over here and you look on
[30:29] this little thing about this big it
[30:30] doesn't say a word
[30:32] it's an image
[30:34] of a round little thing with with arms
[30:37] and with a shirt and a pair of pants now
[30:40] you women do you go in that one
[30:42] that's for the male right over here on
[30:44] this side don't say a word to nobody
[30:48] there's a what there's a woman there
[30:49] with long hair
[30:52] and a what
[30:54] a dress
[30:57] the world still testifies i don't care
[30:59] if they
[31:00] they got it all perverted out there
[31:02] the world still testifies that a
[31:04] female's supposed to look like this and
[31:06] a male supposed to look like this
[31:08] all right so you know god
[31:11] i don't know he just he's tolerating a
[31:13] lot so
[31:14] that's why a woman cannot wear that
[31:16] which pertains to the man why because
[31:17] she then urged her authority above
[31:21] the man or puts her equal you're going
[31:22] to be equal with man don't worry when
[31:24] everything comes back but during the
[31:26] fall during the double covenant that
[31:28] we're under down here
[31:29] you're not to do that right or to cut
[31:32] your hair why
[31:33] because you cut your hair you take
[31:35] yourself out from under the headship of
[31:37] the male right she is never to wear
[31:39] garments that pertain to a male or cut
[31:40] her hair when she does she is intruding
[31:43] into the male domain right taking
[31:45] authority and perverting herself and
[31:47] when a woman invades a pulpit which is
[31:49] commanded she must not do
[31:51] she shows what spirit she's up
[31:54] being a dominating female is antichrist
[31:56] and the seeds of the roman catholic
[31:58] church are in her though she may deny
[32:00] this ever so vehemently but when it
[32:03] comes to the word let god be true
[32:05] and every man's word be alive all right
[32:08] now number two
[32:10] mark of the beast
[32:12] 1956.
[32:15] now listen before we get started in this
[32:18] my wife works three days a week
[32:21] all right
[32:21] she don't work in a public job but if
[32:23] you work in a public job you just listen
[32:26] to what brother brown said to do and you
[32:27] make your decision
[32:29] um i'm not
[32:31] saying yes or no some of you have to
[32:33] work because you don't have a spouse
[32:35] that's different
[32:37] somebody's got to make a living amen
[32:38] okay
[32:39] but let's let the prophet tell you what
[32:41] a woman's supposed to do
[32:43] when a woman gets out of the kitchen
[32:44] she's out of her place
[32:46] whether she's preaching the gospel or
[32:48] whatever she's doing she's out of her
[32:49] place
[32:50] man was not made for woman but woman was
[32:52] made for man man it's not a byproduct of
[32:55] a woman but the woman is a byproduct of
[32:57] the man i know that scorches but it's
[32:59] gospel pill that'll open up your
[33:00] spiritual digesting tract and let the
[33:03] holy ghost sweep through and make you a
[33:04] different person if you'll believe it
[33:07] has that big word if if you'll believe
[33:09] it amen well it's the bible it's the
[33:12] bible said
[33:13] now can you hear or has your ear already
[33:15] stopped up
[33:16] now if you doubt this read first
[33:18] corinthians 11 chapter when you go out
[33:20] find out if it's not find out if that's
[33:22] not true other scriptures isaiah 6
[33:24] isaiah 5. oh my all through the
[33:26] scriptures colossians galatians paul
[33:28] speaking saying you obey
[33:31] your husband amen all right
[33:34] now we're going to cover this because of
[33:36] the angel because she was made for man
[33:39] and because of the angels
[33:41] the woman is to have long hair it is
[33:42] assigned to god
[33:45] and man
[33:46] right
[33:47] she is under man's authority outside of
[33:49] that they're both perverted if you allow
[33:52] that to happen amen i'm sorry that's
[33:53] what the prophet said okay
[33:56] you got to deal with it people we got a
[33:57] lot of things we did in our past life
[33:59] that
[34:00] that you can't erase but you can do
[34:02] something about it
[34:05] you can make better you understand what
[34:07] i'm saying you can't erase what happened
[34:08] back here
[34:09] but you sure can get on your knees and
[34:11] that be the first thing you pray about
[34:12] you and your spouse
[34:14] get right with god both of you right is
[34:16] that right
[34:18] i thought you were asleep
[34:21] number three choosing over bride i got
[34:23] 37 quotes today so we gotta hurry
[34:26] that's for both services
[34:28] giving up a bride now notice again how
[34:30] the natural bride types the spiritual
[34:32] the word says that she was made for man
[34:34] and not man made for woman or her
[34:37] now i'm going to speak and why in a few
[34:38] minutes on the bride of christ but i'm
[34:40] trying to show you the background of it
[34:43] woman was made for man and not man for
[34:46] woman that's the reason under the old
[34:49] law now look that's the old law
[34:51] polygamy was legal polygamy is not legal
[34:54] anymore we don't believe in polygamy i
[34:57] don't need but one man
[35:00] neither do you
[35:03] boy think what your gas bill would be
[35:04] then if you had two or three of them
[35:06] running around
[35:10] for all those of you that don't know it
[35:12] were
[35:13] teaching that course dave ramsey's
[35:15] financial piece and
[35:17] and boyd's got an issue with some gas
[35:21] got some gas issues not getting on him
[35:23] but
[35:25] that didn't come out right give me back
[35:27] the tape and start over
[35:28] again petrol
[35:31] issues
[35:32] so
[35:33] just pray for all of us we're doing it
[35:35] we're everybody's doing a real good job
[35:36] we got about uh
[35:39] 18 of you that are sitting here in the
[35:42] class
[35:42] and in five weeks this is for the glory
[35:44] of god in five weeks
[35:46] in those 23 people that are there which
[35:48] some of them are from keller williams
[35:50] we say they they have saved a cumulative
[35:53] of 24 000 dollars
[35:55] and paid off
[35:58] no save twenty almost twenty nine
[36:00] thousand dollars and paid off twenty
[36:01] four thousand dollars in debt in five
[36:03] weeks
[36:05] and they didn't nobody get an inherent
[36:06] inheritance during that five weeks
[36:08] either
[36:08] that was all taking your money and
[36:10] letting god help you put your money
[36:12] where you need where it needs to be a
[36:13] woman was made for man and not man for
[36:15] woman that's the reason under the old
[36:16] law that polygamy was legal because you
[36:18] had david with 500 wives well they
[36:20] couldn't have no other husband
[36:22] they had one husband just like this type
[36:24] of jesus christ right gloria because
[36:27] jesus christ is one man
[36:29] but he's going to have a mini-membered
[36:30] bride amen that's a type
[36:33] you're not jesus christ
[36:36] so you don't need 500 wives
[36:38] man all right or david eager
[36:40] that was for populating the world and
[36:42] and doing all that god allowed that to
[36:44] happen but it was a type to show us that
[36:47] there's one jesus christ one god
[36:48] almighty amen and a mini-membered bride
[36:51] but we only have one husband glory
[36:54] he has many member brides but we only
[36:56] have one husband that's who christ our
[36:58] head that's why we get out from under
[37:00] that
[37:01] look what happened
[37:03] we've left our spouse
[37:05] we've left all of his protection we've
[37:08] left all the things because he's
[37:10] responsible for us
[37:13] exactly that's why he whips us like last
[37:15] sunday to get back in line
[37:18] right
[37:19] that's why he does it with with but not
[37:21] with um an iron fist
[37:25] he does it with grace thank god
[37:29] most of us
[37:31] most of us i'm saying need to have a
[37:33] real bad beating
[37:34] all right now look
[37:37] next one
[37:39] brother anderson's doing a really good
[37:41] job keeping up with me
[37:43] oh he's he should be
[37:45] he should be patted on the back because
[37:46] he's pretty wrung out he's preaching the
[37:48] same sermon i am but he's doing it back
[37:49] there in that in that room him brother
[37:51] joe and brother joe is the one writing
[37:53] all this down hey if you want to get
[37:54] copies of this they're on the internet
[37:56] you can pull them right off the internet
[37:58] and download them
[37:59] and you can read right along except for
[38:00] the comments that we make
[38:04] which are a few which i wanted the
[38:06] prophet to do all this
[38:07] unless the woman sees or understands
[38:11] that she is made for the woman is more
[38:13] difficult for the wife now these remains
[38:14] are my thoughts
[38:16] it is more difficult for the wife to
[38:18] truly be happy in her submissive role do
[38:20] you understand what that means
[38:22] unless you understand that you're going
[38:24] to have hard feelings about your spouse
[38:27] being under submission to him right
[38:30] exactly right it's going to be hard
[38:33] but if you understand
[38:35] and and then the male understands with
[38:38] knowledge that you're supposed to be at
[38:40] this position
[38:41] it makes it much better
[38:44] for the wife is truly to be ha for her
[38:46] to truly be happy you must in other
[38:48] words you must what we're trying to
[38:50] explain today you must realize the
[38:52] submissive role now we're going to look
[38:54] up that word in just a minute or submit
[38:56] or submissive
[38:57] and show you what it means right hey man
[39:00] not being you know like we've seen them
[39:02] in the message you know they walk around
[39:04] like this
[39:05] you know what more like this
[39:08] you know barefooting pregnant
[39:11] but that's okay
[39:14] let's go to the next one
[39:18] okay here we go yeah we got to get to
[39:19] the
[39:20] to the help
[39:21] meet now remember
[39:23] go back here again the lord god said
[39:24] it's not good for the man to be alone i
[39:26] will make him and help me not help me
[39:28] right
[39:28] anybody can be a mate right
[39:31] two boys can be a mate two girls can be
[39:33] a mate right but help me i help me help
[39:36] me mean suitable helper amen
[39:39] suitable
[39:40] helper that's a help me not a help mate
[39:44] but the word help mate come from the
[39:46] word help me right when they took it out
[39:48] of the original they they put it in to
[39:50] help mate
[39:52] and that's what brother brown talks
[39:54] about help mate and you see other people
[39:55] talking about help me hardly anybody
[39:57] says the actual word help me right that
[40:00] is a helper me or what suitable for him
[40:03] so put the word suitable where it says
[40:06] me you're a helper suitable for him amen
[40:09] if you've got a god fear in life
[40:12] she's full of the holy ghost
[40:15] like brother brown said outside of the
[40:17] love of jesus christ that you have in
[40:18] your heart the new birth there's nothing
[40:21] nothing in this world right more more
[40:24] pleasurable more
[40:26] to make you happy to make you more rich
[40:29] and your life be more full than than a
[40:31] wife that's full of the holy ghost amen
[40:33] right
[40:34] so now let's go to
[40:35] ephesians five
[40:37] wives
[40:38] submit yourselves unto your own husbands
[40:41] as unto the lord
[40:45] right
[40:46] all right now let's go to number four
[40:49] laos and churches
[40:52] a good woman is a jewel in a man's crown
[40:55] said the wisest man on earth who was
[40:57] asked
[40:59] you ought to know he had a thousand of
[41:00] them
[41:01] and that many
[41:04] a man ought to honor a good woman see
[41:07] but an evil one is water in his blood
[41:09] and his blood is his life
[41:11] right you man that's got good wives you
[41:14] don't now know how you want to thank god
[41:17] for a good life
[41:18] for if god could have given a man
[41:20] anything better for a helpmate he'd have
[41:22] done it right but a woman is the best
[41:25] help mate that god could give a man
[41:28] but in other words he starts but when
[41:29] they turn away or when they're watering
[41:31] the blood i didn't want to read that
[41:32] part so you can read it later on all
[41:34] right now let's go to a note
[41:42] the time today
[41:44] i just made a good cut there you go
[41:47] the wife is given the responsibility to
[41:50] carry out god's plan as a suitable help
[41:52] mate so that's your responsibility
[41:55] don't shun that that is your
[41:56] responsibility
[41:57] to be a suitable help mate her
[42:00] responsibility is to com is to
[42:02] complement or be complementary
[42:05] to her mate man now listen
[42:09] you don't always have to agree with what
[42:12] he says and you can make your own
[42:13] comments it don't mean you have to be
[42:15] quiet right
[42:16] but you must be complimentary
[42:20] and i don't like to say this it's like
[42:22] an accessory you know a good looking
[42:24] pocketbook with but but you are you
[42:26] accessorize your your your spouse
[42:28] because he's not really one without you
[42:30] right amen
[42:32] he's not really one without you
[42:34] right all right so and i don't like this
[42:36] i tried to look at the word accessory
[42:38] but that's not really but let's read
[42:39] these
[42:40] submit to give over to yield the power
[42:43] of a star or authority of another to
[42:46] yield yourself to the power and
[42:47] authority of another you need to know
[42:49] when you get married remember the veils
[42:50] over your head in the old country they
[42:52] lifted the veil remember took it off and
[42:54] she put her head
[42:56] right in the veil on the man's shoulder
[42:59] showing that she was submitting herself
[43:02] to her spouse
[43:03] and that he was the one that was going
[43:05] to help her through life they were going
[43:07] to be helpers together suitable the word
[43:10] suitable means appropriate
[43:12] fitting
[43:14] or becoming
[43:15] the word complementary
[43:18] is an expression of praise
[43:21] commendation which is an award
[43:23] or admiration
[43:25] you should be complimentary you should
[43:27] be amen where you can praise your spouse
[43:31] and you spouses of praise your
[43:35] wife
[43:37] but look a commendation or an award
[43:41] because brother branham said the
[43:42] greatest thing you could get
[43:45] outside of salvation is that good wife
[43:48] you got what that's your reward for an
[43:50] award
[43:53] it's really an award for you doing the
[43:54] right thing
[43:56] right
[43:57] it's an award she's an award for you
[43:59] doing the right thing
[44:02] you know what
[44:03] we're we're the award that jesus christ
[44:06] gets amen let's go spiritual for a
[44:08] second we're the award or reward that
[44:11] jesus gets amen that we can sit down
[44:14] with him on his throne glory
[44:16] because we what we have become submitted
[44:20] suitable there's nobody going to be in
[44:22] that city that's not suitable to the
[44:24] lord jesus christ
[44:25] there's not anybody going to be in the
[44:26] new city who's not submissive
[44:30] because remember
[44:32] stubbornness is as witchcraft amen
[44:40] submit yeah
[44:42] that will be in heaven
[44:44] suitable that will be in heaven
[44:46] complimentary that's what we are right
[44:49] we're going to read later on today that
[44:51] god so thought of us
[44:53] he typed us as the city coming down out
[44:55] of heaven man the very future home that
[44:58] we're going to live in in eternity he
[45:00] said it was as a bride what
[45:02] adorned for her husband
[45:06] he thought so much of it that in the
[45:08] last of the book
[45:09] we
[45:10] look we didn't look so good in the first
[45:12] book
[45:13] as far as looking at the natural part of
[45:15] it in genesis the woman the female but
[45:17] when we get towards in revelation that's
[45:19] all he does he just just loads us up
[45:22] with all kind of praise and glory and
[45:24] and of course it all come from him but
[45:26] the wife in revelations 19 we'll get to
[45:28] that this afternoon has made herself
[45:30] ready amen
[45:32] all right
[45:33] so you must be submissive suitable and
[45:36] complementary to your spouse amen
[45:38] correct
[45:39] right man
[45:41] i remember we all come from the old
[45:43] school message you know
[45:45] and the woman said and did nothing and i
[45:47] mean you're not saying that nothing but
[45:48] had no say so or not you know
[45:52] i think you're going to sit down amen
[45:54] because like i said same way with this
[45:56] course that we're teaching i don't want
[45:58] y'all i don't want anybody to get filthy
[45:59] rich i just want a male and a female to
[46:01] get together and talk about something
[46:03] besides grumbling and arguing and
[46:05] fighting
[46:06] but if you two can sit down and work on
[46:08] a budget
[46:09] say this is what we're gonna do just
[46:11] like you two ought to do
[46:14] you'll get a lot more done that's right
[46:16] man
[46:16] there's too much of this i'm going in
[46:18] this direction i'm going in this
[46:19] direction
[46:20] if you're married
[46:22] you better sit down with that spouse
[46:27] we'll read in just a minute it's either
[46:29] tonight either this afternoon
[46:31] or this evening where brother brown
[46:32] really puts that together so let's go
[46:35] complimentary watch how sarah
[46:38] did with abraham yeah
[46:40] let's pull that one up
[46:45] i'm telling you people we there's too
[46:46] much
[46:48] we got to get together i want people to
[46:49] sit down
[46:51] talk about things
[46:53] you know if you can't do that now how
[46:55] are you going to do it in glory how is
[46:56] she going to be your eternal mate right
[46:58] how's she going to be your eternal mate
[47:00] in glory and you can't sit down and talk
[47:01] to her about
[47:04] buying a washing machine
[47:09] i'm glad it's quiet
[47:13] i set something up brother ron spencer's
[47:15] about
[47:16] um
[47:17] i was preaching on something on on the
[47:19] uh
[47:20] adoption and we were talking about uh
[47:22] certain things and they got real quiet
[47:24] especially when i told them that the new
[47:25] testament didn't begin for the book of
[47:27] acts and then i had to explain that
[47:28] because nobody said amen
[47:31] and uh
[47:32] that was about 230 people sitting in the
[47:34] in the sanctuary you know they all were
[47:36] like
[47:39] so i explained it and brother ron came
[47:42] back and said it takes a teacher
[47:45] takes a teacher
[47:48] he didn't make a comment this is the
[47:49] glory of the lord not mine he said if my
[47:51] teachers in school
[47:53] were as interesting as that man i'd
[47:55] still be in school
[47:59] i like to make it interesting i like man
[48:01] i like to make it where it's not just
[48:03] you know it's like i told brother mo you
[48:04] should come out here with a sack of
[48:05] books right brother richard i'm sister
[48:08] charlotte your dad you'd come out with a
[48:09] sack this behind it'd be three hours
[48:12] you'd come out with a stack this height
[48:14] still be three ounces
[48:16] he'd come out with just a few still
[48:17] you're gonna get three hours
[48:19] but he broke it down and he took it
[48:20] right out from under your fingernails
[48:22] right exactly and he run it all the way
[48:24] through your body right i mean that's
[48:26] where you get your foundation you get
[48:28] your teaching is your foundation
[48:30] because it tells you that why for so
[48:32] many years we had preachers say don't do
[48:34] this do this don't do that do this don't
[48:37] tell me why right right if you'll tell
[48:39] me why amen tell me why we don't do this
[48:42] right tell me why the sisters don't cut
[48:44] their hair right because you're
[48:46] urshipping authority over the man amen
[48:49] and god won't hear your prayers right
[48:51] except for repentance amen
[48:53] sorry you know everything ties together
[48:55] this has been the last thing we ought to
[48:57] think about christ in the church but we
[48:59] got to be able to go home and live
[49:01] together
[49:03] in harmony
[49:06] time of decision here's sarah now sarah
[49:09] brother brown always used sarah
[49:12] as a type of of the true wife right
[49:14] because she could call abraham lord and
[49:17] mean it
[49:18] amen and you know what he acted like one
[49:22] right i don't want you to call me lord
[49:24] if i don't act like one amen all right
[49:27] and the time had come for abraham the
[49:28] great patriarch and servant of god to
[49:30] make a decision
[49:31] this decision was that he was to decide
[49:34] just on who his son isaac that he'd
[49:36] waited 25 years for and received him as
[49:38] one from the dead
[49:39] and know that he was a called and
[49:41] separated messenger of god abraham knew
[49:43] who he was right
[49:45] brothers we need to know who we are what
[49:47] our position is all right
[49:50] man
[49:50] you know what if you'll find yours
[49:53] it'll be easy for her to find her
[49:56] right you find yours and she knows what
[49:58] your position is a lot easier for her
[50:00] right
[50:01] all right
[50:02] and there was a time come when he had to
[50:04] make the decision
[50:06] who would be his help mate to carry on
[50:08] the plan of god i think he's talking
[50:10] about like hagar and sarah and you know
[50:12] back and forth abraham back and forth
[50:14] you see god didn't make all don't make
[50:16] all our decisions right
[50:18] i love what brother brady told me one
[50:20] time he said god is in control i know
[50:23] that but he give you five senses right
[50:26] to you
[50:28] yeah
[50:29] i've always said why did god put deacons
[50:31] in the church if the holy ghost took
[50:33] care of everything right right
[50:35] amen why did i put nature in the church
[50:38] because he knew we were still human
[50:40] beings right and we still needed
[50:42] guidance
[50:44] all right
[50:45] that's my husband should be a guide
[50:47] instead of a instead of a
[50:48] controlling hard person you should be
[50:50] god right
[50:53] because remember we are supposed to be
[50:55] first protectors
[50:56] remember jesus was first partakers we're
[50:59] supposed to be first protectors as an
[51:00] example look at him amen all right makes
[51:03] it easier for our job right you see god
[51:05] don't make all of our decisions
[51:07] and there's many times that god doesn't
[51:08] tell his prophets just what to do
[51:10] because they have to make the decision
[51:14] if there is no decision
[51:17] that we have to make just wait every
[51:19] move on god then there is no overcoming
[51:22] on our party man
[51:24] and sometimes they make the wrong
[51:25] decision
[51:26] god's anointed prophets make the wrong
[51:28] decision and many times are deceived
[51:30] remember abraham went to hagar instead
[51:33] of to sarah all right right
[51:36] so there's where you though and i put
[51:38] that in there to show you
[51:40] that god see there was a time come when
[51:42] he had to make a decision who would be
[51:43] as hell made to carry out the plan of
[51:44] god he saw it in sarah he didn't see it
[51:47] hey guard he saw it in south america
[51:48] okay he saw it in sarah so so brothers
[51:53] look at your wife hey man
[51:55] if she's not going down on something
[51:56] that's right
[51:58] tell her about it don't go in and jerk
[52:00] it off of her right just tell her say
[52:02] look stand back and say look
[52:04] your top don't meet your bottom and i
[52:06] don't want people to see the part that i
[52:08] see
[52:09] i don't want anybody looking at my wife
[52:10] seeing the parts that i see right let's
[52:12] just be honest as human beings
[52:15] i hate that
[52:17] it makes you sick
[52:19] number six
[52:24] but the words original seed but the word
[52:25] was with that anointed prophet because
[52:27] the word of the lord came to the
[52:28] prophets
[52:30] joe we may not get to number 16. i told
[52:32] him he's going to stop on quote 16 we
[52:33] may not get there now god doesn't change
[52:35] his system so remember god doesn't
[52:38] change his word god doesn't change what
[52:40] he's doing you and i have to change
[52:43] that's what being born again means your
[52:46] first birth
[52:47] was wrong right why you had to have a
[52:50] new verse
[52:52] born from where jesus said above
[52:55] right that's why it's easier to be to
[52:58] is when you both have the same goals
[53:00] objective same holy ghost the same the
[53:02] same outlook
[53:04] sure you might like pink and i might
[53:05] like blue they ain't gotta do it right
[53:08] all right
[53:10] you god doesn't change the system no no
[53:12] he never changed his system now what was
[53:15] it there stood three again there went
[53:17] janice and jammers performing miracles
[53:19] like went down sodom done one little
[53:21] miracle and blind the people see
[53:22] there stood abraham the anointed one
[53:24] with god and his helpmate sarah right
[53:27] that's right here's to janice and james
[53:30] and that's all about moses
[53:33] performing miracles anything that moses
[53:34] could do in the sign of miracles
[53:36] miracles and signs
[53:37] there stood the anointing word the
[53:39] prophet with his helper his assistant
[53:41] always i can preach on that now for just
[53:43] about a good
[53:44] two hours we know that moses had an
[53:46] assistant which was
[53:48] aaron but he also had a support right
[53:51] amen
[53:53] that was his choice that was his wife
[53:56] bob said he was the meekest most humble
[53:58] man in the world
[54:02] that's what the bible said amen all
[54:04] right nope
[54:14] you see this man
[54:16] man needed a help mate we couldn't do
[54:18] without a help me
[54:20] we had to have one to fulfill the plan
[54:23] and commission of god which is what
[54:25] multiply and replenish the earth and
[54:27] have fellowship
[54:29] now we know when god said that in
[54:31] genesis 1 26 and 27 for us to replenish
[54:34] the earth was right now that's what
[54:35] we're doing spiritual multiplication
[54:37] exactly the spoken word not through the
[54:39] loins of man
[54:40] but when the fall happened which that's
[54:42] what we believe happened in the fall
[54:43] that that the beast and eve got together
[54:46] in a sexual relationship and had you had
[54:48] twins which was adam and and the beast
[54:50] had twins cain and abel and it's pretty
[54:53] clear in the bible right
[54:55] because kane's not part of adam glennis
[54:58] all right cain's not part of adam's
[55:00] lineage anywhere in the bible that's
[55:02] right bob said kane was of that wicked
[55:04] one so we know what happened in the
[55:05] garden
[55:06] the missing link has been
[55:09] exposed hey man exactly
[55:12] i always wondered about that in school
[55:13] but when the prophet brought it out so
[55:15] plain
[55:16] and have to worry about it no more then
[55:19] when god took that
[55:20] upright beast which was a
[55:23] the beast or
[55:24] or an upright creature that was between
[55:26] man and the monkey when he took that and
[55:28] made it a snake
[55:29] he took every bone structure that
[55:31] anything that would compare with us
[55:33] right and just obliterated it sent right
[55:36] back down the line into the state into
[55:38] the snake linens
[55:40] man needed to help me to carry out the
[55:42] plan and commission of god
[55:44] which was what there's two things god
[55:45] wanted what fellowship right and
[55:48] relationship right now god wants us to
[55:50] have relationship with him not like we
[55:52] have with our spouse
[55:54] but a spiritual relationship through the
[55:56] word of god amen that we communicate
[55:59] back and forth with the almighty right
[56:01] that's what he wanted to fellowship in
[56:02] relationship same way with you and i
[56:05] amen he wants you and i to have
[56:07] fellowship and relationship
[56:09] down here on the earth
[56:11] fellowship with your spouse and have
[56:12] relationship in other words replenish
[56:15] the earth now naturally right because
[56:17] you're on the west side and god's son
[56:18] and daughter of god is going to get here
[56:20] right now is by
[56:22] sex
[56:24] but
[56:25] in the eternal plan of god he knew that
[56:28] but we're going right back to the place
[56:30] to where had they not been a fault we
[56:32] have all come sons and daughters of god
[56:33] amen and been made eternal well guess
[56:35] what that's what's happening right now
[56:36] we're heading right back right because
[56:38] remember redemption is not putting this
[56:40] down and picking up a pencil it's this
[56:43] paper went down so the paper's got to
[56:44] come back up right so if man fell by by
[56:47] sexual relationship then we must have it
[56:49] not a sexual relationship with jesus
[56:51] christ but a spiritual relationship with
[56:53] jesus christ to get us back to this
[56:55] place that's why jesus came born of a
[56:57] woman but no sex
[56:59] no egg no germ was given by man it was
[57:02] god almighty himself
[57:04] put the egg and the germ in the womb of
[57:06] mary she was just an oven you take a
[57:07] pile make it anywhere you want to you
[57:09] put it in an oven right
[57:13] and then he cleans the womb as he came
[57:15] out almighty god jesus christ
[57:18] the very god not another not a second
[57:20] person he was god almighty right
[57:23] made in the human flesh
[57:25] what so he could take this flesh back
[57:27] right man he wants us to live right here
[57:29] we're going to live in this thing right
[57:30] here
[57:31] for eternity we're going to live in this
[57:33] flesh right here
[57:34] we're not going to be spooked
[57:36] we're not going to be casper the
[57:37] friendly ghost
[57:38] we're going to be human beings
[57:40] right and he wants us to have a help
[57:43] meet there with us amen
[57:46] so if you're truly born again and you're
[57:48] you're married to a born-again christian
[57:51] spouse
[57:52] they'll be in glory with you for
[57:53] eternity eternity never to be separated
[57:56] remember we read that last night all
[57:57] right let's go number seven
[58:02] in the garden of eden there were two
[58:04] trees one of them was the tree of life
[58:06] the other was the tree treated out now
[58:07] people you know what wasn't two trees
[58:10] what two physical trees
[58:12] remember the bible talks about you being
[58:14] the fruit
[58:15] of your mother you're the fruit of your
[58:18] mother's womb right so you're not to
[58:20] partake of that
[58:21] fruit
[58:23] it wasn't eating an apple if it was they
[58:25] should have covered their mouth and
[58:26] their hands when it came out to meet god
[58:27] but when they cover
[58:29] right
[58:30] where the act happened
[58:31] one of them was the tree of life the
[58:33] other was the tree of death a man
[58:35] refused the tree of life and accepted
[58:36] the tree of death and that's what the
[58:38] world's done today it's refused the tree
[58:39] of life which is christ and made a woman
[58:41] their god right she's american goddess
[58:44] that sounds hard i'm stripping
[58:46] down the women and i want to tell you
[58:48] after all a woman let me burn
[58:50] up on this and men you're coming next
[58:54] look a woman is not even so low she's
[58:55] not even a creation in god she's a
[58:57] byproduct why she come out of god right
[58:59] how she come out of man to be
[59:01] a help me right she's a byproduct after
[59:04] god made the whole creation he took a
[59:05] piece off of a man and made a woman she
[59:07] wasn't even considered an original
[59:09] creation correctly she became a helpmate
[59:11] two man
[59:12] and through there
[59:15] and through there she's supposed to live
[59:17] for that
[59:19] what to be a helpmate
[59:21] help me
[59:22] but today men has turned around and made
[59:25] her what took her out from under
[59:27] and put her to god
[59:30] instead of jesus christ the woman is the
[59:31] god of this country right that's right
[59:33] anybody with any common sense would know
[59:35] that much less holy ghost saints would
[59:37] know that
[59:38] that a woman is what this whole world
[59:41] falls down to
[59:42] number eight
[59:45] does god ever change his mind about his
[59:46] word let's just read it he's talking
[59:47] about this brother carol but scroll it
[59:49] on up
[59:51] he wanted to ordain some about roy davis
[59:53] when he left the church when brother roy
[59:54] davis wanted to ordain some women
[59:56] preachers he said no sir as an elder i
[59:59] said i cannot do that consciously it's
[1:00:01] against the word of god i don't know you
[1:00:03] brother carol but upon the basis of your
[1:00:05] testimony and that truth that you stand
[1:00:06] for we have nothing against these women
[1:00:09] they are sisters we love them
[1:00:11] we believe that they got their place and
[1:00:13] that they must stay
[1:00:14] see and we believe that they are a
[1:00:16] darling to a man a helpmate and by no
[1:00:18] means we think they're the greatest gift
[1:00:21] outside of salvation that god ever gave
[1:00:22] a man
[1:00:24] but she's got no place in the pulpit
[1:00:25] according to the word of god upon that
[1:00:28] basis and your faith in god we lay hands
[1:00:30] on you as fellowship to come go with us
[1:00:32] what he's doing he's ordaining his
[1:00:33] brother to go with him right to a place
[1:00:36] or ordinating him into into the church
[1:00:38] let us lay hands on him right so he's
[1:00:40] real common about he's give god
[1:00:43] the glory
[1:00:45] man has given the wife for his glory
[1:00:48] all right let's go to the next one
[1:00:54] now listen to this
[1:00:57] this is where
[1:00:59] you're supposed to help
[1:01:01] your spouse
[1:01:02] help me is to be involved
[1:01:05] with whatever
[1:01:08] god has called her husband to do right
[1:01:10] brother
[1:01:11] if god's called your husband to play the
[1:01:12] piano or the guitar or the or the or the
[1:01:15] doe bro or the whatever it is instrument
[1:01:18] you know what if that's his position god
[1:01:21] wants him in that position you'd be
[1:01:22] happy with him in that position and
[1:01:24] support him in that position
[1:01:26] all right same way with the minister
[1:01:28] minister's wife
[1:01:29] we'll read it in just a few minutes
[1:01:33] because once you start something
[1:01:36] in a row
[1:01:39] you sisters must be involved with that
[1:01:43] because look involved with whatever god
[1:01:45] has called her husband to do
[1:01:47] here is where i think the importance of
[1:01:48] the role of the wife comes into view
[1:01:50] that's my opinion all right these are my
[1:01:52] notes
[1:01:53] to do two things
[1:01:55] support
[1:01:56] and to understand support means to bear
[1:01:59] or hold up to maintain
[1:02:02] sustain
[1:02:03] under trial
[1:02:05] if your husband's going through the
[1:02:06] trial at work or at
[1:02:09] the church here or anything
[1:02:12] sustain him
[1:02:14] you're the sustaining factor right
[1:02:16] you're not supposed to throw
[1:02:18] rocks at him
[1:02:19] you're supposed to
[1:02:20] bring him in and say hey let's talk
[1:02:22] about this thing to bear to hold up to
[1:02:25] maintain to sustain under trial
[1:02:28] that's the support your sister should
[1:02:30] give to your husband
[1:02:32] and to understand them means to perceive
[1:02:34] the meaning of
[1:02:37] now listen to this to be thoroughly
[1:02:39] familiar with right
[1:02:41] you say well i'm not supposed to jim's
[1:02:42] not supposed to preach no
[1:02:44] but she used to be thoroughly familiar
[1:02:45] with what goes on under that man
[1:02:49] part of ministering right leave me alone
[1:02:51] when i need to be left alone i said
[1:02:53] something to her the other day and i
[1:02:54] gotta apologize to her when she get when
[1:02:55] she gets back
[1:02:56] i was doing some of this and i
[1:02:59] i just looked at her i didn't say
[1:03:00] anything i just looked at her and she
[1:03:02] knew that she'd kind of when i get into
[1:03:04] a zone and start pulling all this
[1:03:06] together you know somebody said well i
[1:03:07] don't understand that you know how you
[1:03:09] know how you do things you get in a zone
[1:03:11] and then somebody comes in and just asks
[1:03:12] you a question and it just
[1:03:14] kind of runs you off and you can't get
[1:03:15] your thought back quick enough so i just
[1:03:17] kind of looked there a little bit also i
[1:03:19] got to apologize to her when you get
[1:03:20] back and i don't mind that
[1:03:21] but she knows when i'm doing something
[1:03:23] she's to support that
[1:03:24] yeah you know not come in and let the
[1:03:26] kids run around grand baby was playing
[1:03:28] in the room and she actually did take
[1:03:30] diana out of the room
[1:03:31] when where she was playing she of course
[1:03:33] she wanted to be with all she didn't
[1:03:34] understand but see june understood
[1:03:37] so the one that did understand took the
[1:03:39] one that didn't understand out right if
[1:03:41] i hit you don't worry about it
[1:03:45] we'll pray for you
[1:03:48] just be a little just be a little low
[1:03:50] like
[1:03:51] uh benjamin there
[1:03:53] i'm not used to anybody sitting on his
[1:03:54] front row set brother dick he's over
[1:03:56] here a little bit so i can't get to him
[1:03:59] but to understand to perceive the
[1:04:01] meaning of be thoroughly familiar right
[1:04:04] if if your spouse plays the piano or the
[1:04:07] guitar be supportive
[1:04:10] sustain them under trial
[1:04:13] perceive the meaning of what they're
[1:04:15] doing
[1:04:16] because they have a very important role
[1:04:18] yeah
[1:04:19] you're supposed to be that
[1:04:21] right not here
[1:04:24] no supportive
[1:04:27] right
[1:04:28] i'm like i'm one of the same barking
[1:04:30] chihuahua dog around your ankle yeah
[1:04:32] don't want to be that
[1:04:33] right now too let's see
[1:04:36] if you'll go this far with me
[1:04:38] your sisters have got to have
[1:04:39] discernment to realize that that man's
[1:04:41] not carrying you off in a different
[1:04:42] direction right
[1:04:43] right
[1:04:44] that's where the holy ghost inside of
[1:04:45] you
[1:04:47] is going to have to take over and say
[1:04:49] hold on you say you yeah
[1:04:51] yeah exactly that's not a problem with
[1:04:53] that
[1:04:54] don't do it in public
[1:04:57] remember you you fight in the backyard
[1:04:58] with your family but don't fight my
[1:05:00] family in the front yard when you're
[1:05:01] gonna fight all of us
[1:05:02] all right
[1:05:04] so do inside your home if you have a
[1:05:06] problem work on it but remember if he
[1:05:08] starts taking you off in another
[1:05:10] direction that's not scriptural or
[1:05:11] that's not moral
[1:05:14] then you have the responsibility of
[1:05:16] saying hey
[1:05:18] let's take a look at this thing
[1:05:20] let's go talk to our pastor or or if
[1:05:23] you're not you know if you're not if
[1:05:25] you're not going to church here if you
[1:05:26] look listen on the internet or something
[1:05:28] go find a third party that has some
[1:05:30] wisdom
[1:05:31] that's like dave ramsey said he said
[1:05:33] don't go talk to your bro brother-in-law
[1:05:35] about finances and don't go talk to
[1:05:37] somebody's been divorced 14 times about
[1:05:39] marriage right
[1:05:40] he said find somebody that's been
[1:05:41] married for 65 years take them out to
[1:05:44] lunch and say how did you do it yeah all
[1:05:47] right so that's what you got to do
[1:05:48] there's a lot of there's a lot of things
[1:05:50] that we got to apply to our regular
[1:05:52] family life i told you when we started
[1:05:54] this thing we live more
[1:05:58] in humanity
[1:06:00] than we live in the heavenly right
[1:06:03] amen right oh some of you may not
[1:06:06] but you're just lying
[1:06:08] cause we're humans we have human
[1:06:10] thoughts we have human ideas we have to
[1:06:11] live in life we have bills
[1:06:14] we got cars that break down
[1:06:16] we got
[1:06:17] carpets got to be replaced in the house
[1:06:18] we got kids that need this
[1:06:20] in that human life that's human life
[1:06:22] okay a humanity but you know what this
[1:06:25] didn't surprise god
[1:06:27] all right he's not up there saying well
[1:06:29] i gotta change something remember the
[1:06:30] problem said he doesn't change
[1:06:32] right so he knows and has made
[1:06:34] provisions for everything that goes on
[1:06:36] in our life he's already made provisions
[1:06:38] for it
[1:06:39] okay
[1:06:40] keep raising your hand now just i'm
[1:06:41] gonna hit you i'll remember your left
[1:06:46] all right let's go to number
[1:06:48] number nine
[1:06:50] possessing all things
[1:06:53] now we know the story of abraham what
[1:06:54] had happened he had been called to a
[1:06:55] place of duty he'd been called out of
[1:06:57] his land the land of the challenge the
[1:06:59] city of earth where he had been there
[1:07:01] with his father and his people and
[1:07:02] that's down in the shiner valley
[1:07:03] probably reached for the land and
[1:07:05] abraham as we understand wasn't any
[1:07:07] special person inside of the world
[1:07:12] right
[1:07:14] ryan just fulfilled his role he just
[1:07:16] walked out the back door with a diaper
[1:07:17] in his hand and one of the kids
[1:07:20] he's helping his mate right back and
[1:07:22] forth
[1:07:24] a lot of you wouldn't done that
[1:07:34] you gotta understand your role
[1:07:36] i am not changing the diaper he said
[1:07:39] and abraham as we understand
[1:07:41] wasn't any special person the reason i
[1:07:43] picked this quote because remember
[1:07:45] we're not any special person in the
[1:07:47] world
[1:07:48] in the world but in the sight of god
[1:07:50] we're the most precious people on the
[1:07:51] face of the earth all right in other
[1:07:53] words he wasn't a king or a monarch or a
[1:07:55] publication in other words he wanted
[1:07:56] some of this but now god made him that
[1:07:58] right
[1:07:59] give him all kind of cattle give him all
[1:08:00] kind of land told him he was the chosen
[1:08:02] one for the age and he was just a man
[1:08:05] and he married his half sister which was
[1:08:06] sarah and probably married her when she
[1:08:08] was a young woman and god had called him
[1:08:10] at the age of 75
[1:08:15] 75 to a life of service and it also
[1:08:19] included his help mate
[1:08:21] and right here we could start i believe
[1:08:23] when god calls a man to service if he's
[1:08:25] a married man and has a help mate he
[1:08:27] calls his wife with him
[1:08:29] because they two are one
[1:08:31] that's the fastest baby change i've ever
[1:08:32] seen in my life
[1:08:34] that's a world record brother
[1:08:38] i think he just switched i think he just
[1:08:40] switched kids but you change the number
[1:08:42] good job man he's doing great
[1:08:46] put a timer on him
[1:08:48] and he calls his wife whitney because
[1:08:49] day two are one and so wherever
[1:08:52] we find later on that god possibly would
[1:08:54] have killed sarah when she doubted the
[1:08:56] angel's message
[1:08:57] 25 years later
[1:09:00] when they were sitting under the oak
[1:09:02] tree that day
[1:09:03] but when she laughed when the angel told
[1:09:05] her or told abraham that she was going
[1:09:07] to be mother and sarah laughed within
[1:09:08] herself and said how could i old 90
[1:09:10] years old her husband 100
[1:09:12] her womb had dried up for years and his
[1:09:14] body's good is dead and how could she
[1:09:15] ever have pleasure with her husband
[1:09:17] again and she laughed to herself
[1:09:19] and the angel with his back turned to
[1:09:20] the tendency why does there left
[1:09:22] and she denied it now that's telling god
[1:09:25] this face that he's wrong because
[1:09:26] remember melchizedek was jesus christ
[1:09:29] the theophany of jesus christ not the
[1:09:30] land jesus christ not the flesh jesus
[1:09:32] christ but theophany of god was that man
[1:09:35] because he abraham called him lord amen
[1:09:38] right and she denied now that's telling
[1:09:40] god his face that he's wrong see and
[1:09:42] that would have took her life but god
[1:09:44] could not take sarah because she was a
[1:09:46] part of abraham see and she was in the
[1:09:50] covenant with him
[1:09:52] so she had to go with him so she could
[1:09:55] not take abraham or take sarah without
[1:09:57] taking apart abraham for those two
[1:10:01] are one right hey man when you get
[1:10:03] called
[1:10:04] it calls two not just one calls two all
[1:10:07] right let's go to number ten
[1:10:10] let's just read the
[1:10:12] underlying part perseverance i guess
[1:10:14] your sweetheart came too i know you feel
[1:10:16] that way about her you talk about some
[1:10:17] other brother she's still your
[1:10:18] sweetheart and that's the way we i know
[1:10:20] we all of us christians feel that way
[1:10:22] about our wives and they're still our
[1:10:24] sweetheart
[1:10:25] i hope it never changes in my family and
[1:10:27] never changes in your family that we can
[1:10:28] always feel that way about our wives
[1:10:31] after all they stand side by side with
[1:10:33] us
[1:10:35] to help us fight these battles and we
[1:10:37] need them amen
[1:10:38] although i've said many scorching things
[1:10:40] to them but it wasn't in such a way to
[1:10:42] make them feel bad it was such a way to
[1:10:45] keep them in line with the gospel and
[1:10:47] see that's satan's tool where he works
[1:10:49] the hardest that was his first
[1:10:51] instrument
[1:10:52] is that right
[1:10:53] he knew he couldn't go directly to
[1:10:55] abraham i mean to adam in the garden of
[1:10:57] eden right right
[1:10:59] so he went to the weaker vessel he went
[1:11:01] to eve
[1:11:03] preached her sermon and her problem was
[1:11:05] she didn't say let's go talk to adam
[1:11:06] about this she started preaching back to
[1:11:08] him that's why women shouldn't preach
[1:11:10] right they get their feelings and
[1:11:12] emotions and all these things you know
[1:11:14] going and boy he really preached for a
[1:11:17] good sermon and then that's what
[1:11:19] happened in the garden that's why a
[1:11:20] woman shouldn't do that because now
[1:11:22] she's under the covenant where man is
[1:11:23] through over her
[1:11:25] that was his first instrument he's never
[1:11:27] changed
[1:11:29] what he hit the woman in the beginning
[1:11:32] he's hitting her in the end right
[1:11:35] that's where we fell as women look at
[1:11:37] all the women in politics and look at
[1:11:39] all the women that are doing things with
[1:11:42] people that are in politics
[1:11:44] and all the what it's always a woman
[1:11:47] look at herman cain and all them you
[1:11:48] know whether he did it or not a woman
[1:11:50] was involved somewhere
[1:11:53] that's why
[1:11:54] let me caution you brothers some of
[1:11:56] young brothers and even some of us old
[1:11:58] brothers do not
[1:12:00] go anywhere with another woman that
[1:12:02] ain't your wife unless it's your
[1:12:04] daughter or your grandkid all right
[1:12:07] don't go no way
[1:12:08] don't go in a room with a woman by
[1:12:10] yourself it's not your spouse if you
[1:12:13] have to counsel with a female you take
[1:12:15] either another brother which is not good
[1:12:17] but you need to take your wife
[1:12:19] right yeah and go counsel with that
[1:12:21] person if they want to have a private
[1:12:22] conversation i don't like being in a
[1:12:24] room with a woman by myself i just don't
[1:12:26] that
[1:12:29] you say well
[1:12:30] is it me may not be me i can maybe
[1:12:33] control myself
[1:12:34] but she may not or somebody around may
[1:12:37] see us going down the road and say
[1:12:39] that's not his wife right
[1:12:41] what's going on we know what's happening
[1:12:44] now see you just keep those things away
[1:12:46] because that's what satan does satan got
[1:12:48] eve separated from adam
[1:12:50] and when she got eve separated from adam
[1:12:53] that's when he did his job amen that's
[1:12:55] what he's saying right here he's never
[1:12:56] changed he stays right there
[1:12:59] we just have to pray for our sisters
[1:13:01] constantly of course they pray for us
[1:13:03] too and together with one unit
[1:13:06] we march forward like an undefeated army
[1:13:08] with our great chief captain christ
[1:13:10] jesus and his word going before us
[1:13:12] making
[1:13:13] a way for us number eleven
[1:13:18] my wife i guess they introduced her here
[1:13:19] tonight they was going to she's 34 years
[1:13:22] old and almost completely gray as you
[1:13:23] noticed if there's any credit to be
[1:13:25] given to the branham family
[1:13:28] it doesn't come to me
[1:13:30] give it to her she's the one who stood
[1:13:33] between me and the door helping the
[1:13:34] people doing all that we can
[1:13:36] bless your heart may god give her a
[1:13:38] peace in the kingdom of god
[1:13:40] and he will
[1:13:42] as god showed the prophet what he would
[1:13:43] get in heaven his wife was there right
[1:13:46] only a preacher can hardly realize what
[1:13:48] a preacher's wife goes through
[1:13:51] you know it brothers i'm glad god gave
[1:13:53] us a help mate aren't you yes sir a man
[1:13:55] that's got a good loyal wife ought to be
[1:13:57] so true and loyal to her and she she
[1:14:00] that's got a good husband ought to be
[1:14:02] the same way look at the world today and
[1:14:04] how it is
[1:14:06] in chaos
[1:14:07] that's right
[1:14:08] right
[1:14:09] number 12.
[1:14:11] i ain't faced
[1:14:12] jezebel here's the only thing you do
[1:14:16] now when you leave the church tonight
[1:14:17] you say you know i kind of believe
[1:14:18] brother branham right yeah now that is
[1:14:20] the truth but tomorrow you go right back
[1:14:22] into the office where you are to go
[1:14:24] that's the next thing we're going to
[1:14:26] talk about
[1:14:28] right back into the office where you
[1:14:29] ought to go if your husband's sick you
[1:14:31] need to do it but if it isn't listen
[1:14:33] dear sister beer god made you for one
[1:14:35] place the kitchen when you get out of
[1:14:37] there you're out of the hell of his will
[1:14:39] remember that women that was made to be
[1:14:41] a helpmate at the house she never was
[1:14:43] made for office work and it caused more
[1:14:45] disgrace and divorces
[1:14:47] and things now remember i told you that
[1:14:49] we're
[1:14:52] can't deny what he said amen okay
[1:14:55] now you sisters like i said that have to
[1:14:57] make a living on your own because your
[1:14:58] spouse is not with you or are deceased
[1:15:01] or or
[1:15:03] you know not good or not good to you or
[1:15:05] whatever you know you
[1:15:06] that's something you own on a
[1:15:08] case-by-case basis
[1:15:12] i'm just reading to you what the prophet
[1:15:13] said because in my
[1:15:15] dealings of being a business owner for
[1:15:16] years ago and dealing with business and
[1:15:19] higher management all my life
[1:15:21] since about 1980s
[1:15:23] three
[1:15:25] i've seen it
[1:15:28] woman
[1:15:30] listen i'm just giving this example and
[1:15:31] then we made it stop right here
[1:15:34] yeah we'll just brother joe we'll just
[1:15:36] have to we'll just maybe stop here this
[1:15:38] 15th tail but you watch
[1:15:41] like i said i've seen it happen
[1:15:45] my sister goes to work
[1:15:47] when her husband comes home
[1:15:50] she comes home
[1:15:52] y'all see y'all see each other at the
[1:15:54] worst time
[1:15:57] curlers
[1:16:00] house gown
[1:16:03] hey took a bath male and female yeah but
[1:16:06] now when you go to work what happens
[1:16:08] you put on your best
[1:16:10] you dress up your best
[1:16:12] right
[1:16:12] and then when you get to work you spend
[1:16:14] more time talking i'm not mean yeah i
[1:16:17] mean just everyday conversation
[1:16:19] at work
[1:16:20] than you do talking to your spouse right
[1:16:23] so be careful because that's the devil's
[1:16:26] trap amen
[1:16:27] because he'll if the guy that you're
[1:16:29] working for doesn't have the holy ghost
[1:16:30] the first thing he's going to start
[1:16:31] doing is saying oh
[1:16:33] you having problems today
[1:16:35] yeah yeah this and that and the other
[1:16:39] well the whole end of it is divorce
[1:16:42] or an adulterous affair or something and
[1:16:45] that's what brother bran was talking
[1:16:46] about you got to go to work to help your
[1:16:48] family help your spouse now i'm going to
[1:16:50] tell you this he said if you have a debt
[1:16:52] we'll read it tonight if you have a debt
[1:16:55] try to pay the debt off not a problem
[1:16:58] but if you're just doing it he says to
[1:16:59] have a bigger car or have a bigger house
[1:17:02] he'll tell you i'll read in just a
[1:17:03] little bit that's not what it's supposed
[1:17:04] to do
[1:17:06] now you know find something june was a
[1:17:08] date she had daycare in our home for 12
[1:17:10] 14 years that was okay we had an income
[1:17:13] coming home she stayed at home now she
[1:17:14] works with sister pam i'm not saying
[1:17:16] that's exactly right
[1:17:18] i'm trying to work my way through to
[1:17:19] where she don't have to work that's my
[1:17:21] goal to work to that
[1:17:23] okay
[1:17:24] you're working just three days a week
[1:17:25] but if you have to work you have to work
[1:17:26] i'm not condemning work
[1:17:29] but what i'm saying is you are the
[1:17:31] weaker vessel right
[1:17:33] and you can be trapped
[1:17:35] by some slick head
[1:17:37] in an office setting because you look
[1:17:39] your best at that time you've just took
[1:17:42] a good bath you put all good clothes on
[1:17:44] and you go to work
[1:17:45] then the toils of life follows you
[1:17:48] and what's the first thing you do you
[1:17:50] start opening up and start talking
[1:17:52] and then you start getting closer
[1:17:55] closer
[1:17:57] and closer to that person because you
[1:17:58] spend more time with them than you are
[1:17:59] your own husband right they see then you
[1:18:01] go home
[1:18:03] supper's not on the table
[1:18:08] house is not clean
[1:18:11] and then your husband walks in from
[1:18:14] a 10-hour job or an eight-hour job
[1:18:17] and he sees that
[1:18:18] and what's the first thing he's going to
[1:18:20] say
[1:18:20] why isn't this done why isn't this done
[1:18:22] some of us jump in and help i do a lot
[1:18:24] to help jim with that that's okay that's
[1:18:26] my business i want to i don't want it i
[1:18:28] don't i like cooking right i just don't
[1:18:29] like cleaning up i like cooking
[1:18:33] if i cook she'll clean up sometimes so
[1:18:35] that's okay but see but if you had to
[1:18:37] come in from an office environment and
[1:18:39] then you gotta come into the
[1:18:41] reality of a home life
[1:18:43] kids running around you know changing
[1:18:46] diapers and and then you're tired she's
[1:18:48] tired but what's gonna happen is you're
[1:18:50] gonna if you're gonna if you don't talk
[1:18:51] to each other you're gonna start doing
[1:18:53] this
[1:18:54] you're just going to come home and exist
[1:18:58] you're going to put your curlers back in
[1:18:59] your hair
[1:19:00] you're going to not look your best to
[1:19:02] your spouse
[1:19:04] and then
[1:19:05] he's going to start maybe looking
[1:19:06] elsewhere i'm just being honest
[1:19:08] you understand if you're not born again
[1:19:10] i'm talking about if you're born again
[1:19:11] and do that you're not well you're not
[1:19:12] working
[1:19:14] you start running around your wife and
[1:19:15] you think you're born again you forget
[1:19:17] you're not right all right that's just
[1:19:20] you say well no
[1:19:23] that's right
[1:19:25] i thought that little thing on the
[1:19:26] inside
[1:19:28] was eternal life and it's supposed to
[1:19:29] keep you
[1:19:32] when this won't keep you
[1:19:34] and all the other parts of your body
[1:19:36] don't keep you that inside's supposed to
[1:19:38] keep you
[1:19:39] right
[1:19:40] that's what i depend on i depend on that
[1:19:42] to keep me right because i know what i
[1:19:44] need to shield myself from
[1:19:46] i don't know about you but i know what
[1:19:47] my weak spots are
[1:19:49] you know why because i live in them
[1:19:50] right
[1:19:51] all right before we get let's go ahead
[1:19:52] and do let's go ahead and reach
[1:19:54] scripture and then we'll
[1:19:56] it'll be a basis for this afternoon
[1:20:03] titus 2 verse 3 and 4 the aged woman
[1:20:05] likewise that they be in behavior as
[1:20:08] becoming holiness
[1:20:10] not false accusers accusers not given to
[1:20:13] much wine teachers of good things that's
[1:20:15] the age woman aged woman now
[1:20:18] like daddy said last sunday somebody is
[1:20:21] always watching you
[1:20:24] somebody's always watching you
[1:20:26] and it's every little thing they'll pull
[1:20:27] it apart quicker than you than you will
[1:20:30] right but they'll pick it's just hard
[1:20:33] sometimes to
[1:20:34] get people to realize we we need to
[1:20:37] change you know people can people tell
[1:20:39] me more about your life
[1:20:41] then i see what your life is yeah
[1:20:44] all right so the people
[1:20:45] being a minister all i got to do is just
[1:20:47] walk in a room and shut up
[1:20:51] somebody's going to start talking yeah
[1:20:54] because that's just the gift that we
[1:20:55] have that's the same way just shut up
[1:20:58] you just start listening they'll just
[1:21:00] pour their heart out yeah that's just a
[1:21:02] gift that i have i'm not
[1:21:04] and you know what the reason many
[1:21:06] preachers fail they don't have the holy
[1:21:07] ghost for one and number two they left
[1:21:10] that overtake into the woman's part and
[1:21:14] adultery
[1:21:16] fornication all the things like that you
[1:21:17] can use your gift to get whatever you
[1:21:19] want can't you right you can use your
[1:21:21] gift to get whatever you want if you're
[1:21:22] a minister right
[1:21:24] you better keep that thing under control
[1:21:26] amen
[1:21:26] that they may teach the young women to
[1:21:28] be sober to love their husbands so you
[1:21:31] older sisters you see the younger
[1:21:33] sisters doing stuff
[1:21:35] i thank god for gary atkins which is not
[1:21:37] here today they got a business trip down
[1:21:40] in florida or in alabama
[1:21:42] but he took a brother
[1:21:44] that we had been talking to about
[1:21:46] cutting his hair he just took the
[1:21:47] brother went hey his hair cut
[1:21:49] you people get involved it don't have to
[1:21:51] come from here
[1:21:53] a lot of times people don't want it to
[1:21:54] come from here right yeah
[1:21:56] you know michael you can't take hate
[1:21:58] somebody can
[1:21:59] but that's okay but if some of you like
[1:22:01] look it says teach the younger women in
[1:22:03] other words i shouldn't have to come to
[1:22:05] um
[1:22:07] hope
[1:22:08] and say something if she's dressing
[1:22:10] unappropriately some of you sisters go
[1:22:12] to her
[1:22:13] and i'm just using for an example it's
[1:22:15] okay you don't mind
[1:22:16] but do that don't wait till daddy has to
[1:22:19] get up here and pour it all out an hour
[1:22:24] i thought we were members together amen
[1:22:28] daddy and i and the ministers in this
[1:22:30] church are not up here and y'all down
[1:22:32] here
[1:22:34] i don't want that i don't want up here
[1:22:36] god's up here that see when you do that
[1:22:38] you urship authority above your head
[1:22:40] right
[1:22:41] that you may teach the young woman to be
[1:22:43] women to be sober to love their husbands
[1:22:46] to love their children some of you older
[1:22:47] sisters
[1:22:49] teach the younger
[1:22:51] sisters how to do things and your
[1:22:52] younger sisters you know what if you
[1:22:54] rebel
[1:22:56] then you go back to witchcraft again
[1:22:58] there you go back to being a bastard
[1:22:59] child right that's what the bible says
[1:23:01] not me that's what the bible says
[1:23:03] to be discreet
[1:23:05] chase
[1:23:06] keepers at
[1:23:08] home
[1:23:10] good
[1:23:11] obedient to their own husbands
[1:23:14] look at that last statement right
[1:23:17] that the word of god be not blasphemed
[1:23:20] amen amen
[1:23:22] let's read it one more time
[1:23:24] the age women likewise that they be in
[1:23:26] behavior as becometh holiness
[1:23:28] not false accusers not given to much
[1:23:30] wine teachers are good things
[1:23:32] that they may teach the young women to
[1:23:34] be sober to love their husbands love
[1:23:36] their children to be discreet
[1:23:39] chaste which means pure
[1:23:42] keepers at home amen good obedient to
[1:23:45] their own husbands in other words all
[1:23:48] that
[1:23:49] you can't blaspheme if you do all that
[1:23:51] above that right right but if you don't
[1:23:53] you could because says that the word of
[1:23:55] god
[1:23:56] be not
[1:23:57] blessed thing pretty powerful all right
[1:24:00] let's go to proverbs who can find a
[1:24:02] virtuous woman for her price is far
[1:24:04] above rubies
[1:24:08] proverbs 31 27 she look as well to the
[1:24:11] ways of her household and eateth not the
[1:24:14] bread of idleness right
[1:24:20] i could say something there but i don't
[1:24:21] have time we'll wait first timothy let's
[1:24:23] read some of these we may read them this
[1:24:25] afternoon when we get back i will
[1:24:26] therefore i will therefore that the
[1:24:28] young women married their children
[1:24:31] guide the house how many times do we
[1:24:33] look at this three scriptures that says
[1:24:35] house household
[1:24:38] keepers of the home
[1:24:40] give none occasion
[1:24:44] give none occasion to the adversary
[1:24:46] who's that the devil
[1:24:48] to speak reproachfully right don't give
[1:24:51] me something to talk about
[1:24:53] because the devil's going to find
[1:24:54] something to talk about oh yeah all
[1:24:55] right quote number 13.
[1:24:57] forgive me we'll just stand and sing a
[1:24:59] song
[1:25:00] and dismiss but i need to get this down
[1:25:01] right here because i need to give the
[1:25:03] quotes to back this up
[1:25:05] brother brown's life story i said i
[1:25:06] don't know
[1:25:08] home is not the house
[1:25:09] listen this quote very popular it's the
[1:25:12] order of the house
[1:25:14] that makes the home
[1:25:15] it's the order of the house that makes
[1:25:17] the home
[1:25:18] that's what makes home no matter if it's
[1:25:20] a shanty
[1:25:21] whatever it is
[1:25:23] if the order is right on the inside and
[1:25:25] godly it's more of a home than if you
[1:25:28] had a palace somewhere remember he
[1:25:29] married those two groups of people
[1:25:31] everybody remember the story he married
[1:25:33] a group of people that he married a
[1:25:34] husband and wife that were
[1:25:36] alcoa can or some some kind of great
[1:25:38] company and they went and lived in the
[1:25:40] castle and they fought the whole time
[1:25:42] you know but he went down there and a
[1:25:44] married a a little boy and girl that she
[1:25:47] didn't have any shoes on
[1:25:49] they were so poor
[1:25:50] they had to they lived in a box car
[1:25:52] remember he went down there and cut a
[1:25:54] door out in a box car had a little um
[1:25:58] like an orange crate to sit on that's
[1:26:00] all it had well he goes and he sees this
[1:26:02] group sitting on the hill and they're
[1:26:04] fighting and fussing but he goes down
[1:26:05] and he kind of goes around and and
[1:26:08] listens to these before he comes up to
[1:26:10] the to the thing and she's sitting on
[1:26:11] his lap and they're worried about a
[1:26:12] 15-cent dress
[1:26:15] he said i'd rather have that
[1:26:18] a million times and have that one on the
[1:26:19] hill that's where this is all coming
[1:26:20] from exactly if the order is right on
[1:26:23] the inside and godly it's more of a home
[1:26:26] than if you had a palace somewhere
[1:26:28] and i would probably venture to say
[1:26:30] without knowing anything that happened
[1:26:32] with these people that were on the hill
[1:26:33] that were born to a rich family that had
[1:26:35] rich they probably divorced
[1:26:37] they probably never made it but i
[1:26:39] believe these people down here if they
[1:26:40] did what they're supposed to do and
[1:26:42] godly people they didn't stay in that
[1:26:44] boxcar very long
[1:26:46] they moved up because the order of the
[1:26:48] house was correct amen i'd rather live
[1:26:50] in a shanty and be happy than to live in
[1:26:52] a palace and be unhappy
[1:26:54] that's right all right let's go on to
[1:26:55] the next one

[1:37:35] before the greatest people that god ever
[1:37:37] put on the face of the area right

[1:37:42] man standing up here trying to tell you
[1:37:44] what to do
[1:37:45] but you'll see that gods give us leaders
[1:37:48] he's given us the holy ghost
[1:37:50] to to confer with what we're hearing
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:54] see that's the conversation you should
[1:37:56] have
[1:37:57] right
[1:37:57] it's the spiritual conversation between
[1:37:59] you and god you should reflect back
[1:38:02] you know the only way the only way that
[1:38:05] you're going to make my daddy happy you
[1:38:07] could buy him a mansion and 14 cars and
[1:38:10] send him on 45
[1:38:12] trips around the world
[1:38:15] wouldn't be too bad
[1:38:18] but if you people would do what the word
[1:38:20] says
[1:38:22] line up to the word of god glory get
[1:38:24] this stubborn stupidness off of us that
[1:38:27] we can't take correction
[1:38:29] well either take it or leave one of the
[1:38:31] two
[1:38:33] because i don't and if god gives me if
[1:38:35] i'm the stubborn one
[1:38:37] get me out of the way
[1:38:39] like my old high school football coach
[1:38:40] said lead follow or get out of the way
[1:38:43] because there's somebody coming up
[1:38:44] behind you
[1:38:46] is pushing you
[1:38:47] i want us to stop this
[1:38:50] be willing to change we're supposed to
[1:38:52] be pliable remember
[1:38:54] the potter once he gets finished and
[1:38:56] puts you in the oven and trials you
[1:38:59] harden
[1:39:00] he can't mold you anymore right but when
[1:39:02] he can see you up on that shelf before
[1:39:04] that happens and get you down and
[1:39:07] remold you i watch him do it all the
[1:39:08] time over craving party when i was
[1:39:10] little
[1:39:11] but he had a little more water because
[1:39:13] you get a little bit hard
[1:39:15] water of the word
[1:39:17] made it pliable and he would make they'd
[1:39:18] make this beautiful little pot
[1:39:21] and if it was off to one side guess what
[1:39:24] start over again
[1:39:27] so he molded into what he wanted it to
[1:39:29] be amen and he's the great potter and
[1:39:31] we're the clay and clay is pliable
[1:39:34] until you put it in an oven right and
[1:39:36] bake it all right you love the lord you
[1:39:39] know it's a little bit late i'm sorry
[1:39:40] but come back at two o'clock if you're
[1:39:42] not mad at me you can come back at two
[1:39:43] o'clock
