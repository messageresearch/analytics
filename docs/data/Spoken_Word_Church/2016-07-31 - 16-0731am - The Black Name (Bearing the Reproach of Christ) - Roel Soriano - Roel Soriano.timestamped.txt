[17:25] to do something for because I'm not I
[17:28] I'm not a I'm having some problems about
[17:31] 12:30 in the morning that a certain
[17:33] brother is calling me and uh I've asked
[17:38] him if he would have call me a little
[17:39] earlier but the reason I'm saying that
[17:41] is is he told me finally his name this
[17:44] morning and somebody needs if we can
[17:46] find out we've got his phone number and
[17:48] where he lives but uh if anybody knows
[17:51] anything about him I wish you let me
[17:53] know his name is Bruce
[17:55] Lee right good name to remember in it I
[17:59] don't think he's a body guy I think he's
[18:01] dead okay I hope it's not him all right
[18:04] but uh he's kind of kind of making some
[18:07] inroads talking and I'm making a few too
[18:09] so I said this morning to him I said
[18:11] well you know just what do you got to do
[18:13] with all this well he let me know he was
[18:15] a prophet he thought so that's all right
[18:18] and we believe in the five-fold ministry
[18:20] Prophet that's all right am we believe
[18:22] in it you know praise the Lord for it
[18:25] and you know but uh just pray that the
[18:27] Lord would help us to to uh find out
[18:29] what it all is and what's going on
[18:31] because he may show up Among Us
[18:33] sometimes and that's fine too cuz I
[18:35] believe in a five full ministry amen and
[18:37] praising the Lord for that okay all
[18:39] right but just remember that remember
[18:41] praying for brother Serano today as he
[18:44] ministers to us and true we've got an
[18:46] announcement to make we'll be making it
[18:47] a good many times and I'll just start it
[18:49] off by saying it uh little uh Thomas has
[18:53] made the inroad into the family now and
[18:56] you know been kind of got the intent to
[18:59] adopt and that'll be a while but what
[19:01] we're going to do is is we're going to
[19:03] have a not a baby shower cuz he not a
[19:06] baby he's 7 years old so we're going to
[19:09] have a tree foot downstairs and call it
[19:12] a money tree and instead of you trying
[19:14] to buy gifts for him as presents and
[19:17] things you just clip the money on the
[19:19] money tree and then on the
[19:22] 28th we will be having a kind of a
[19:25] welcome to him you know and all and be
[19:27] having cake and ice cream after the
[19:30] evening service so remember that now on

[19:35] a money tree there you can just clip it
[19:37] on whatever you want to do that'll be
[19:38] fine CU it'll just be uh instead of

[19:43] boy
[19:44] shower so just remember that okay all
[19:47] mind's clear everything's great so let's

[23:47] um and my subtitle will be bearing the

[24:04] all of us that uh we bear the reproach
[24:07] of
[24:09] christen and for a scripture reading I
[24:11] would like to turn to the Book of Mark
[24:15] chapter 4 verse
[24:22] 1-6 a share main
[24:25] standing we with it
[24:29] verse one
[24:30] reads and he went out from
[24:34] then and came into his own country
[24:37] that's right and his disciples follow
[24:40] him right and when the Sabbath day has
[24:44] come he began to teach in the
[24:47] synagogue and many hearing him were
[24:51] astonished saying from whence has this
[24:55] man these things yeah
[24:58] and what wisdom is this which is given
[25:02] unto him that even such Mighty works are
[25:06] wrought by his hands amen is this not
[25:10] the
[25:11] carpenter the son of
[25:13] Mary the brother of James and Joseph and
[25:18] Judah and Simon and are not this right
[25:22] here his his sisters here with us right
[25:27] in other words they know him in that
[25:29] place it's his own
[25:31] country uh later on I'll tell you what's
[25:34] wrong with this uh uh description of the
[25:37] Lord
[25:41] Jesus and the Bible said and they were
[25:45] offended at him yeah but Jesus said unto
[25:49] them a prophet is not without honor
[25:53] right but in his own country right and
[25:56] among his own King in and in his own
[26:00] house right and he could do here no
[26:04] Mighty
[26:05] work save that he laid his hands upon a
[26:08] few sick folk and healed
[26:11] them and he marveled because of their
[26:17] unbelief and he went round about the
[26:20] village
[26:22] teaching these are the words of the Lord
[26:24] may he add his Blessing to the reading
[26:26] of his word let's all pray father once
[26:29] again we come to you humbly uh believing
[26:33] that uh you are able to open our
[26:36] understanding oh God and uh allow us to
[26:39] see the light of the scriptures that
[26:42] we've just read amen we thank you Lord I
[26:44] pray for every person that has
[26:47] come uh our hearts are heavy with
[26:51] burdens that we bring before you and I I
[26:54] just trust that you understand them more
[26:57] you know all about it Lord and you're
[26:59] you're willing to stretch forth your
[27:01] hand and uh meet every need this
[27:05] morning we thank you and praise you may
[27:07] your name be glorified in Jesus name
[27:10] amen amen amen may be
[27:16] seated hallelujah amen amen
[27:24] amen so going back to our scripture
[27:27] scripture you're reading in Mark chapter
[27:30] 4 uh it's interesting that
[27:35] uh they mentioned the name of the mother
[27:38] of
[27:39] Jesus even mentioned the name of his
[27:43] brothers and the people say we know we
[27:46] even know his sisters I mean uh we know
[27:50] this guy how how come he's he's able to
[27:53] say these things you know how can he say
[27:55] these things how can he do these Mighty
[27:58] Works
[28:00] Hallelujah and uh uh uh you would think
[28:05] uh uh this is a compliment to the Lord
[28:07] Jesus but no they were actually debasing
[28:10] him that's right because you see they
[28:14] mentioned the name of his mother yeah
[28:18] but no mention about his
[28:21] father right and uh uh to to a Jewish
[28:25] mind you know this is this is an
[28:28] insult this is this could be the gravest
[28:32] way to demean a
[28:35] person it's not to name to mention the
[28:38] name of the father and and just mention
[28:41] the name of the of the
[28:45] mother
[28:54] Hallelujah you know in Jewish uh culture
[28:59] talk of SC uh Scandal or sexual scandal
[29:04] in parentage is a big
[29:08] insult and you know uh those Jewish
[29:12] people they could count you know they
[29:15] they knew that uh Mar Mary gave birth
[29:19] just a a few a few months after he after
[29:23] Mary after Joseph married him yeah right
[29:28] you know uh and there are talks that
[29:32] uh Jesus was actually consed when they
[29:37] were
[29:38] still yeah they were still single you
[29:41] know it was a premarital
[29:44] Affair but worse than that there are
[29:47] thoughts that somebody else father Jesus
[29:51] yeah yeah that Jesus was a bustard
[29:56] bustard child
[29:58] yeah and you know uh when they want to
[30:02] take out uh Saddam Hussein the the
[30:06] American soldiers they went over there
[30:09] and of course the uh Saddam Hussein's
[30:12] soldiers
[30:14] were um killing all killing all the
[30:17] Americans that that were coming and so
[30:20] what they did they attached a big loud
[30:24] speaker in one of the uh armored
[30:28] vehicles and they play the tape you know
[30:32] repeatedly telling the uh Iraqi soldiers
[30:37] that their mothers were born
[30:39] illegitimately
[30:41] yeah and the Iraqi soldiers were they
[30:44] got so
[30:46] mad that uh they came out of their
[30:49] secret bunkers and started firing
[30:52] wildly sure at the at the speaker
[30:58] they they wanted to shoot down the
[30:59] speaker because they didn't want to hear
[31:01] it that their mothers were born
[31:04] illegitimately but that made them
[31:07] sitting sitting du targets you know for
[31:10] the Americans and they took them out
[31:14] Hallelujah I kind of like that
[31:19] strategy because out there in the Middle
[31:21] East you know it's it's a big insult
[31:25] yeah if you try to say that the parents
[31:28] have committed sexual Scandal scandals
[31:32] you know they can't take
[31:35] it and we see in the Bible that even
[31:38] Jesus disciple disciples were identified
[31:42] by their father's name yeah let's read
[31:46] it in Matthew chapter
[31:48] 10 verse 2- 4 it reads now the names of
[31:54] the 12 apostles are this
[31:57] the first Simon son of Jonas see who is
[32:03] called Peter and Andrew his brother yeah
[32:07] and then James and the son of seede see
[32:10] the fathers are always mentioned right
[32:14] because it's an honor to take the name
[32:17] of the father right and Jesus was
[32:20] supposed to be a firstborn child right
[32:23] he was supposed to be associated with
[32:25] the name of the father yeah he should
[32:28] carry the name of the father but no the
[32:30] biblical account calls him the son of
[32:35] Mary
[32:38] Hallelujah and then philli and barom
[32:42] Thomas and Matthew the Publican James
[32:45] the son of alus there he goes again and
[32:49] leus whose soname was Theus Simon the
[32:52] Canaanite and Judah es scariot who who
[32:56] had betrayed him
[32:57] him you see what I
[33:01] mean brother Bam put it in this way he
[33:04] explained it in this
[33:05] way he said that's how
[33:09] someone uh got it the other day I've got
[33:13] a lot of letters on
[33:15] that on hybrid
[33:18] religion that I made a remark over in
[33:21] the Bible said that the illegit
[33:24] illegitimate child or a bastard child
[33:28] could not enter the congregation of the
[33:30] Lord for 10 Generations how about that
[33:34] which would be 400 years right that
[33:39] illegitimate child could not come into
[33:42] the congregation of the Lord hallelujah
[33:46] right that's how
[33:48] bad that hybriding was right and that
[33:52] was a woman that let another man live
[33:55] with her in order to bring forth a child
[34:00] right that that child was
[34:03] hybrid not by its father but but by some
[34:07] other man see and that was so evil
[34:12] before God it taken 10 generations to
[34:16] ever breath them out again before God
[34:19] Amen right you see God uh looked at it
[34:23] uh that this was the sin was so evil
[34:27] that it would take 10 Generations right
[34:31] or 400 years right before a bastard
[34:35] child can come in and and uh uh be a
[34:38] part of the worship in the temple amen
[34:42] right
[34:46] Hallelujah but I believe this is so
[34:48] classic what we read in Matthew chapter
[34:50] 16 verse 17 you know the discourse
[34:53] between the Lord Jesus and Peter yeah
[34:57] Hallelujah because you know the Lord uh
[35:00] was telling was asking the disciples who
[35:02] do you think that I
[35:04] am who do you think the sign of the son
[35:07] of man is and and and and and to these
[35:12] Peter
[35:14] said Thou Art the Christ the son of the
[35:17] Living
[35:18] God hallelujah and uh Jesus
[35:24] was um impressed with what Peter had to
[35:30] say and so he made this comment he said
[35:32] Jesus answered and said unto him blessed
[35:35] art thou Simon B Jonah see the name of
[35:40] the father is mentioned again right
[35:44] meaning Jesus was saying Simon your
[35:46] father's name is Jonah yeah but Flesh
[35:50] and Blood did not reveal it to you flesh
[35:53] and blood has not revealed it unto you
[35:56] but my My
[35:58] Father which is in
[36:00] heaven you got a human father but human
[36:04] fathers cannot give you this
[36:07] Revelation matter of fact no man no
[36:10] human being can give you a revelation of
[36:13] who Jesus really was but he said my
[36:17] Father in
[36:18] Heaven Hallelujah the one that people
[36:22] did not recognize that's right amen
[36:24] because they're they're they're St you
[36:26] know know she she I mean Joseph was not
[36:31] his real father amen and uh something
[36:35] must must happened there uh uh somebody
[36:39] some somebody else could have been
[36:42] involved
[36:46] Hallelujah but I like this you
[36:49] know flesh and blood cannot reveal who
[36:53] Jesus Isen that's right amen no no no no
[36:59] great
[37:00] preacher no Bible scholar right none of
[37:04] the uh none of the Bible School teachers
[37:08] none of the
[37:09] theologians can can tell you who Jesus
[37:12] really is right
[37:14] right CU you know they all have their
[37:17] opinion of who Jesus is right yeah some
[37:20] people have him to be just a man yeah
[37:23] you know some people have him to be a
[37:26] special man and some people have him to
[37:29] be a
[37:31] prophet but Peter got it right he said
[37:34] you are the
[37:35] Christ you are the one that was has been
[37:39] prophesied to us the Messiah right amen
[37:42] hallelujah Moses told them there was
[37:45] going coming a there was uh God would
[37:48] send them a prophet like unto him and
[37:52] when this Prophet comes on the scene
[37:53] that they have to hear him or they would
[37:57] be cut off from the people right amen
[38:01] hallelujah thank you Jesus amen and amen
[38:04] but but Peter said you are the Christ
[38:07] you are that one the son of the Living
[38:11] God and so the Lord said you're blessed
[38:14] Peter and Upon This Rock Amen of course
[38:18] we know what what that rock is it is the
[38:21] rock of revelation of who Jesus Christ
[38:24] is wasn't Peter wasn't even Jesus but it
[38:29] was the rock of revelation of who Jesus
[38:32] is
[38:37] hallelujah
[38:39] so we remember that U no Jew was named
[38:44] after his mother like
[38:47] Jesus it's a great dishonor yeah to name
[38:51] a d a Jew after his
[38:54] mother because it should be the father
[38:57] amen
[39:00] right did you know that Jesus was also
[39:03] called amongst the
[39:05] Jews the son of
[39:10] panta
[39:12] Jesus was known as the son of
[39:14] panta I I read this article about about
[39:19] him written by uh one Robin Robin
[39:23] Hellwig R Larson a a ger
[39:27] author which says about 177
[39:31] ad the Greek philosopher celsus in his
[39:35] book The True word express what appears
[39:39] to have been the consensus Jewish
[39:41] opinion about Jesus that his father was
[39:46] a Roman Roman soldier called
[39:49] panta Pantera means
[39:52] Panther and was fairly common name name
[39:56] among Roman
[39:58] soldiers the rumor is repeated in the
[40:01] talmud and in medieval Jewish medial
[40:05] Jewish writings where Jesus is referred
[40:08] to as yesu
[40:10] panta think about
[40:13] that and in 19 in 1859 a gravestone
[40:19] actually surfaced in
[40:21] Germany for a Roman soldier called
[40:24] Tiberius Tiberius Julius abdes
[40:29] panta whose unit cohort I sagit sorum
[40:35] had served in Judea before moving to
[40:38] Germany so they found a grave of this
[40:41] man and the Romantic historians have
[40:45] hypothesized this to be Jesus
[40:48] father especially as the word abdes
[40:53] which means Servants of God s just a
[40:57] Jewish background yeah
[41:00] Hallelujah so can you imagine this the
[41:03] Jewish people even up to now 2,000 years
[41:09] after Jesus was born there're still
[41:12] talking about it
[41:14] yeah the and giving him a black name
[41:18] right that he was truly a uh son of a
[41:22] Roman soldier named panta and they call
[41:26] him Jesus
[41:28] panta yesu
[41:36] panta that gave us
[41:39] a serious problem that uh we had to uh
[41:44] uh contend with you know we had to
[41:46] confront the problem because you know in
[41:49] in one message brother bandam spoke
[41:52] about illegitimate children uh they're
[41:55] not going to make it to the Rapture yeah
[41:57] you know and so there were illegitimate
[42:02] people in my
[42:04] church and they heard
[42:06] me uh quote better random say that you
[42:09] know illegitimate children are not
[42:11] predestinated you know they're not going
[42:13] to make it to the rap they can be saved
[42:15] but not make it to the
[42:16] Rapture Hallelujah and and so this was a
[42:21] problem I mean some of the Believers
[42:25] say I mean what's the use of staying in
[42:27] this church if I won't make it in the
[42:29] Rapture
[42:31] anyway so I pray to the Lord for an
[42:34] answer you know how can I confront this
[42:38] problem Lord and the lord gave me this
[42:43] quotation about illegitimate
[42:46] children not allowed not not being
[42:49] allowed to enter the temple for 10
[42:52] Generations brother R made this
[42:55] explanation
[42:56] he said but that doesn't apply to this
[43:02] age and it really gave me a sigh of
[43:06] relief it really liberated a lot of
[43:09] people in the Philippines right amen I
[43:12] guess in the US too more so in the
[43:17] US this doesn't apply to this age
[43:21] exactly you have a birth now oh my amen
[43:26] right there had just one birth back
[43:29] there that was the actual sexual
[43:32] breeding amen but we have this new birth

[44:04] amen amen it breeds all the the call out
[44:09] and we are new creatures in Christ Jesus
[44:13] born again of the spirit of God Amen it
[44:18] says new creatures amen oh the word
[44:21] creature if some of you good Scholars
[44:24] here that understand if you don't you
[44:26] might look it up the creature comes from
[44:29] the Greek word a new
[44:32] creation right amen hallelujah I'm
[44:35] thankful for the new birth amen sir amen
[44:40] it made us not new creatures but a new
[44:44] creation GL Hallelujah that's right a
[44:47] new
[44:48] breed of people hallelujah what kind of
[44:51] people human beings with God inside

[45:22] God's new creation of a new
[45:26] am right New Creation at Birth but it
[45:30] has to be a birth just the same as the
[45:34] natural birth is necessary the spiritual
[45:37] birth is just as necessary as the
[45:40] natural
[45:42] birth
[45:47] amen it's not an option Jesus said you
[45:51] must be born
[45:53] again hallelujah amen and and I thank
[45:56] God that that he has allowed us the
[45:59] privilege of uh having this experience

[46:35] Earthly father amen right but we were
[46:39] born the second time by our heavenly
[46:42] father born into the family of
[46:45] God
[46:47] hallelujah and uh you know God only has
[46:50] one family
[46:53] right half of them part of them is in
[46:56] heaven already right and one part is
[47:00] still here on Earth amen and the Bible
[47:02] tells us that the family in Heaven and
[47:06] Earth is named after amen amen exactly
[47:10] amen the Lord Jesus Christ and that's
[47:13] the name we
[47:15] carry
[47:17] Hallelujah there's a there's
[47:20] a dirtiness and a shadow and a blackness
[47:26] that hangs about that name right but you
[47:30] can't get away from it right you have to
[47:33] carry it
[47:35] amen you're a Christian you carry it
[47:38] Glory you're married to Christ you have
[47:41] to carry his
[47:42] name Hallelujah
[47:49] exactly look at this verse this
[47:54] quotation but said the devil has always
[47:58] been after the
[48:00] church right oh yeah he was after Christ
[48:05] and now he's after the
[48:09] church the Church of the Living God is
[48:12] that right and it's always had a black
[48:17] name right see what I'm talking about
[48:20] it's always had a black
[48:23] name Jesus was born in this world with a
[48:28] black
[48:31] name as a legitimate child did you know
[48:35] that supposed to be a child out of holy
[48:39] redlock either a child of Joseph before
[48:43] they got married or somebody else's
[48:45] child Jesus had that hang that hanging
[48:50] on him but in his heart he knew he was
[48:55] the son of God God Amen you see that's
[48:57] the main thing right you know Jesus
[49:00] didn't care what people thought about
[49:03] him n amen the main thing was Jesus knew
[49:08] who he was amen he said I came from God
[49:12] I go back to God when he was asked by
[49:15] pontious pilate are you the king it's
[49:18] for this purpose that I came to this
[49:21] world I came I was born to reain
[49:24] Hallelujah he knew who he
[49:28] was Hallelujah am he knew that he was
[49:31] the Fulfillment of the prophecy in
[49:35] Revelation uh in Genesis chapter 3 right
[49:38] amen you know he was the seed of the
[49:40] woman amen right that was to crush the
[49:43] head of the seed of the
[49:45] serpent
[49:54] Hallelujah
[50:02] and uh brother bman
[50:06] said that's the reason why Jesus was so
[50:09] confident you know that whatever he says
[50:13] will come to pass right you know this
[50:16] man's sight will be restored it came to
[50:19] pass stand up and be
[50:22] healed your sins are forgiven you know
[50:25] it came to pass whatever he says comes
[50:28] to pass he's so confident butam said
[50:31] that's because he knew who he was
[50:36] Glory this is what I'm trying to drive
[50:38] to you am brothers and sisters it's
[50:41] important that you know who you are
[50:44] right amen because people will not will
[50:47] never probably never change their
[50:49] opinion about
[50:50] you like they never changed the opinion
[50:53] about Jesus they're still talking about
[50:55] it
[50:57] and trying to prove that Jesus was an
[50:59] illegitimate uh son of Mary Hallelujah
[51:03] so what would they think about you yeah
[51:08] Hallelujah so they can say all manner of
[51:11] negative things yeah they can see all
[51:14] the call in you yeah Hallelujah but but
[51:17] doesn't matter as long as you know who
[51:20] you
[51:21] are Hallelujah and I thank God
[51:24] Hallelujah the Heavenly Father showed us
[51:27] revealed to us who we are amen amen we
[51:32] were a part of God Amen Hallelujah
[51:36] chosen by God before the foundation of
[51:38] the world we are offsprings of the
[51:41] Living God that's right Hallelujah by
[51:45] virtue of the second birth amen right
[51:50] Hallelujah you see John the
[51:53] Baptist first it was Jesus
[51:57] Jesus he could do no Miracles the Bible
[52:01] said because of the people's unbelief
[52:04] right they knew him too well oh we know
[52:07] this man he's just a carpenter this is
[52:10] Mary's Mar's a uh uh boy and we know all
[52:14] his brothers and
[52:16] sisters and so the power of Jesus to do
[52:21] something great for them was actually
[52:23] limited right think about it amen you
[52:27] limit God right in what he can do in
[52:31] your life by your own
[52:34] unbelief you limit God's omnipotence
[52:38] think about it amen
[52:41] hallelujah and the Bible said Jesus
[52:44] marveled at their
[52:47] unbelief
[52:49] hallelujah how come these people don't
[52:52] believe right I mean I go to all places
[52:56] and uh and people believe but in my own
[53:01] Homeland they don't believe right
[53:10] Hallelujah and John the
[53:12] Baptist we come to John the Baptist
[53:14] ministry now and he was uh fairly
[53:17] accepted by the Jewish
[53:19] people and brother bam explains it this
[53:22] way in John the Baptist is that after he
[53:25] being recognized as a prophet among the
[53:28] people so he he was actually
[53:30] recognized as a prophet among his people
[53:34] oh you know they thought John was a good
[53:37] Prophet too
[53:40] yeah until he recognized Jesus and said
[53:45] that that legitimate born of
[53:48] illegitimate born child so believe among
[53:51] the people that that that fellow was the
[53:54] Messiah
[53:56] you he was popular amongst the people
[53:59] until right he started introducing the
[54:02] Lord Jesus as the Messiah when he
[54:06] started preaching about
[54:08] Jesus then his popularity went down
[54:11] right and the people began to reject
[54:15] him and
[54:18] uh think that is not a true Prophet from
[54:22] God yeah Hallelujah the first first
[54:25] thing B said when he was born he was
[54:29] born with a dirty name that's the reason
[54:31] why to begin with amongst the people as
[54:35] a illegitimate child yeah he fought
[54:39] himself right on through that oh my I
[54:44] like that Jesus fought himself through
[54:48] all of that right
[54:50] amen I hope you can do the same amen you
[54:54] know uh not limit what you can do with
[54:59] what people say about you the negative
[55:03] things they say about you oh you're not

[55:09] you're you're not uh you're not pretty
[55:12] enough yeah you don't have enough
[55:14] education you will amount to you will
[55:17] not amount to
[55:18] anything uh but you see if you entertain
[55:21] these thoughts in your
[55:23] mind well
[55:25] it will really H really happen to you
[55:27] what they say will really happen to you
[55:30] because it has created unbelief in your
[55:32] mind and your unbelief is actually
[55:35] limiting your destiny amen hallelujah
[55:40] what's going to happen to what's
[55:41] happening uh uh and what what what will
[55:45] come come out of you in this life
[55:47] Hallelujah is is limited by how you
[55:50] think about
[55:52] yourself and how easy it is mhm for us
[55:56] to have a low
[55:57] esteem of our own person because of what
[56:01] people say about us amen hallelujah
[56:05] aren't you thankful for the new
[56:07] birth Hallelujah aren't you thankful for
[56:12] justification Hallelujah the the things
[56:14] that they said about us are probably
[56:17] true we did all those things but thank
[56:21] God for the New
[56:23] Birth when God looks at me this morning

[57:15] daddy Hallelujah but in his heart he
[57:19] know he was the son of God see he fought
[57:23] through that
[57:26] amen that's
[57:29] right Jesus came the same
[57:32] way
[57:33] dressed Immortal God dressed in human
[57:37] flesh that's right and because he was
[57:39] born in a manger in a t stable full of
[57:43] manure and not a place to lay his head

[58:27] could
[58:28] die so much human that he could
[58:31] cry so much human that he could hunger
[58:35] right he was in one sense human right
[58:38] because he was the creative Son of God
[58:42] God dwelt in him right now but he was
[58:46] human and he was human and God together
[58:51] right I like that exactly right that's
[58:53] that that puts it very very clearly he
[58:55] was human and God together amen God
[58:59] created a blood cell in the womb of
[59:04] Mary
[59:08] hallelujah what
[59:12] for so he can bleed right right so that
[59:17] his blood can be a sacrifice right amen
[59:22] an
[59:23] offering so God can take us back into
[59:27] fellowship with him right Amen brother
[59:30] talks about the blood coming back upon
[59:33] the worshipper yes sir you know he had
[59:36] to be a human being to be to be akin to
[59:39] human beings that's correct
[59:42] Hallelujah and in order for him to have
[59:46] blood he must Veil himself with human
[59:50] flesh notice God
[59:53] promised
[59:56] God is obligated to take care of it
[59:59] right and this blood
[1:00:01] cell where he formed he moved into this
[1:00:06] womb covered himself with his own
[1:00:09] creative blood think about it
[1:00:11] amen brought forth the son Christ Jesus
[1:00:16] yes sir the blood cell was broken at
[1:00:19] Calvary and the blood run out of his
[1:00:21] body in order that he could bring back
[1:00:24] to himself Fellowship exactly it oh I
[1:00:29] think this is so
[1:00:31] beautiful the only way he can bring us
[1:00:33] back into his presence is for him to
[1:00:37] bleed amen
[1:00:39] right his own son to bleed that's why he
[1:00:42] had to become a human being God had to
[1:00:45] Veil himself in human flesh he was both
[1:00:48] human and divine at the same time
[1:00:51] Hallelujah that's right and a lot of
[1:00:54] people are not able to comprehend that
[1:00:56] right amen hallelujah that's right
[1:00:59] including the Jews I guess PE better
[1:01:03] said uh he was talking to a Jew one time
[1:01:07] and and the Jew said you cannot Chop God
[1:01:10] in three pieces and hand them to hand
[1:01:13] him to a
[1:01:14] Jew and because uh he was always
[1:01:17] bragging about the name of Jesus when

[1:01:23] restored brother M said it was the name
[1:01:26] of Jesus he did it in jesus' name amen
[1:01:29] hallelujah it was the resurrected Christ
[1:01:32] that did the work amen and his sight was
[1:01:35] restored amen and the Jewish rabbi
[1:01:38] witnessed all this and he couldn't take
[1:01:42] that brother B was bragging about the
[1:01:44] name of Jesus that uh he did it in the
[1:01:47] name of Jesus Christ
[1:01:49] Hallelujah and so that conversation
[1:01:52] ensued yeah you can't chop three gods in
[1:01:56] into threee and hand them to a Jew and B

[1:14:38] wrong
[1:14:40] Spirit Hallelujah this was exactly what

[1:15:31] it Hallelujah you have a way of doing it
[1:15:36] B said so has God got a way of doing
[1:15:39] it it's God's church but God's church
[1:15:44] will move on and the pillar of Fire
[1:15:47] won't stand for that hallelujah amen
[1:15:51] that's right what a rebuke yes I take
[1:15:55] this as a rebuke of the prophet of God
[1:15:57] for this age to me amen as a message
[1:16:01] believer amen hallelujah you know we we
[1:16:04] we don't we don't make a document that
[1:16:06] says these people are not true
[1:16:09] believers no we don't we don't we don't
[1:16:12] write it down and make it official but
[1:16:14] in Our
[1:16:16] Minds come on brother we have a way of
[1:16:18] doing it
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] hallelujah h you have a tendency to
[1:16:24] classify s certain
[1:16:26] groups this group belongs to this camp
[1:16:29] and this camp and that
[1:16:31] camp won't have anything to do with them
[1:16:34] because they don't believe what we
[1:16:35] believe in this
[1:16:38] church and vam said the pillar of fire
[1:16:42] will never stand for that Hallelujah
[1:16:45] that's why he sent the prophet messenger
[1:16:48] am to set us free from the bondage of
[1:16:51] Egypt amen amen that's right
[1:16:54] denominational bondage yes sir that's
[1:16:56] right denominational
[1:16:59] Spirit you know we say we we got out of
[1:17:02] denominations many years ago the
[1:17:04] question is has the denomination got out
[1:17:08] of
[1:17:09] you you know brother said before you can
[1:17:12] take the water out of a man first you
[1:17:15] need to take him out of the
[1:17:17] water so we've been taken out of the
[1:17:19] water of
[1:17:21] denomination but some of us still
[1:17:23] has to take the water out of us our
[1:17:26] system you know we come to the message
[1:17:29] and we bring
[1:17:30] our beliefs into the message we try to
[1:17:34] mix our conception
[1:17:37] right into what the prophet of God
[1:17:42] taught that's why we have all kinds of
[1:17:44] problems in this message that's right
[1:17:48] amen but brother bandam he knew exactly
[1:17:52] what he was yes am let me read to
[1:17:56] you the m is letting off the pressure he
[1:17:59] said and I wouldn't come here to be
[1:18:03] heard said this I wouldn't come here to
[1:18:05] be
[1:18:06] heard because I'm not much to listen
[1:18:10] to he
[1:18:12] knew he said bad
[1:18:16] voice not an educated
[1:18:19] man and never stay in my text oh my I I
[1:18:23] hate that about about preachers you know
[1:18:26] they they wonder and
[1:18:28] they but but said that about himself he
[1:18:32] said I never stay with my text and Skip
[1:18:36] all over from Genesis to
[1:18:38] Revelation and he said and I'm not an
[1:18:41] eloquent speaker
[1:18:43] right but he said I do love the Lord
[1:18:47] that's the main thing right I do love
[1:18:50] the Lord and I can't love Christ until
[1:18:53] first I love his people amen see I've
[1:18:57] got to love his people so if I love his
[1:19:00] people then I can say I love him right
[1:19:04] Hallelujah I like that don't you
[1:19:11] amen so now like John the
[1:19:15] Baptist he was the third Elijah amen
[1:19:20] right and he was reproached for
[1:19:22] preaching
[1:19:23] Christ
[1:19:25] right and brother
[1:19:29] brandham all he did was preach Christ am
[1:19:32] yes sir hallelujah amen and he being
[1:19:34] reproached for doing
[1:19:36] so right he said Christ is the word amen
[1:19:41] and God help me if I preach outside of
[1:19:44] the word of
[1:19:48] God but today people magnify his
[1:19:51] mistakes and Mal educ ation and poor
[1:19:54] family
[1:19:56] background people call him poor and
[1:20:00] ignorant can't even pronounce his words
[1:20:03] right he
[1:20:05] says uh Empire for
[1:20:09] Empire and and he says duter for
[1:20:15] Deuteronomy he says nuclear for
[1:20:19] nuclear you know can't even pronounce
[1:20:21] this right it shows is education is not
[1:20:25] sufficient
[1:20:27] right and there's there's talks that he
[1:20:30] learned which scra and budo budo when he
[1:20:33] went to Africa and India that's why he
[1:20:36] could read the minds of people
[1:20:41] W and then the cloud controversy oh
[1:20:45] yeah can you believe a lot of people are
[1:20:47] believing now that it never
[1:20:50] happened Hallelujah
[1:20:53] H and then somebody featured him in a
[1:20:58] book it's called God's generals yeah at
[1:21:01] first they introduced brother random as
[1:21:03] a mighty man of God you know and then
[1:21:06] towards the end he trayed yeah he began
[1:21:10] to call himself the Elijah of our
[1:21:12] day and God didn't like that they say
[1:21:16] thus his tragic death yeah can you
[1:21:20] imagine but this was the reproach that's
[1:21:23] right of William
[1:21:25] brandom
[1:21:27] Hallelujah he too had a black
[1:21:31] name he's called false
[1:21:34] prophet and if if follow we follow the
[1:21:38] message
[1:21:39] and they accuse us of following a man of
[1:21:43] course we do because the man followed
[1:21:46] Christ hallelujah amen that's right
[1:21:49] we're nothing but an oldfashioned cult
[1:21:53] yeah I would rather be that than the
[1:21:55] mega churches of
[1:21:57] today
[1:22:00] hallelujah oh
[1:22:02] my he's a poor man not well
[1:22:06] known in this age of
[1:22:10] knowledge
[1:22:12] Hallelujah you know the Bible talks
[1:22:14] about clouded Minds the minds of the
[1:22:17] people will be clouded in SEC 2
[1:22:20] Thessalonians chap 2:1 even said and for
[1:22:23] this cause God shall send them strong
[1:22:27] delusion that they should believe a lie

[1:22:34] believe it right tell them a
[1:22:37] lie they say Amen to
[1:22:42] that
[1:22:45] Hallelujah you'll be surprised you'll be

[1:22:50] the history and say that the Jewish
[1:22:53] Holocaust did not actually happen what
[1:22:55] they're
[1:22:56] saying they won't teach it they won't
[1:22:59] they won't teach it that's
[1:23:02] right and and and what do our schools

[1:23:06] about about the creation
[1:23:10] account they don't teach it they teach
[1:23:13] the Darwin Theory Hallelujah and that's
[1:23:17] a lie but people would rather believe
[1:23:20] that than the truth of the word of God
[1:23:26] Amen would you believe 14 million
[1:23:30] Filipinos actually believe that our
[1:23:33] former dictator fergin
[1:23:35] Marcus who who looted our country robbed

[1:23:49] act he's actually the greatest president
[1:23:51] we've ever had

[1:23:59] that
[1:24:01] Hallelujah well they can say whatever
[1:24:03] they want about brother brandom about
[1:24:05] this message
[1:24:07] Hallelujah but what's important is that

[1:24:12] are right what's important is that you
[1:24:15] know who Christ
[1:24:18] is hallelujah I may have um many calls
[1:24:23] so to speak about my being about my
[1:24:27] personality Hallelujah but all that has
[1:24:30] been
[1:24:31] overshadowed by the image of
[1:24:34] Christ
[1:24:37] Hallelujah I stand here today you don't
[1:24:39] see roel Serano you see
[1:24:43] Christ because I died a long time ago

[1:24:54] that lives there Christ living within me
[1:24:59] amen
[1:25:01] hallelujah so what am I
[1:25:03] saying you have to esteem it
[1:25:08] right lift the name of the of Jesus on
[1:25:13] high it's a judaist Christians
[1:25:16] Hallelujah to preserve the dignity and
[1:25:19] honor of that name am that's right
[1:25:21] Hallelujah
[1:25:23] amen we need to be proud of it amen not
[1:25:26] to be
[1:25:28] ashamed Hallelujah of the name of
[1:25:32] Jesus in an age where they turned the
[1:25:35] name of Jesus into a
[1:25:38] curse in movies they they only they only
[1:25:42] say the name of Jesus when they're
[1:25:45] cursing
[1:25:46] Hallelujah but you see that's part of
[1:25:48] the reproach too amen and you have to
[1:25:52] beg the reproach of Christ am
[1:25:58] Hallelujah you see the prophet's
[1:26:01] stubbornness his uncompromising nature
[1:26:05] he says it like it is you know he he he
[1:26:08] didn't want to he didn't mince his word
[1:26:11] so to speak that's right Hallelujah I'm
[1:26:14] proud of it amen I'm thankful to God
[1:26:17] that he he sent a man he sent as a
[1:26:19] prophet like that amen who would not not
[1:26:22] compromise Hallelujah that's right who
[1:26:24] would only believe what the word of God
[1:26:31] says he's very
[1:26:34] undenominational he has no association
[1:26:36] with any organized
[1:26:39] religion thank God that he has preserved
[1:26:41] the purity of this messag amen
[1:26:45] hallelujah so I really like that
[1:26:48] song must Jesus bear his cross alone Al
[1:26:53] it says must Jesus bear the cross alone
[1:26:57] and all the world go
[1:26:59] free no there's a cross for everyone and
[1:27:04] there's a cross for
[1:27:09] me the Lord said you want to follow me
[1:27:11] take up your
[1:27:14] cross follow
[1:27:17] me Acts chapter
[1:27:21] 2:38
[1:27:22] Peter was the one
[1:27:24] Speaking therefore let all the house of
[1:27:28] Israel see the C Peter who denied Jesus
[1:27:31] three times something happened to
[1:27:35] him he's bold now amen he has no fear
[1:27:39] now Hallelujah and he was addressing the
[1:27:42] house of Israel the great leaders that
[1:27:44] were
[1:27:45] there I'm saying let all the house of
[1:27:48] Israel know assuredly that God has made
[1:27:52] made that same
[1:27:55] Jesus the one they debased the one they
[1:27:58] put to shame the one they talk about as
[1:28:01] being illegitimate Hallelujah they made
[1:28:04] Jesus the One They Crucified whom you
[1:28:07] have crucified both Lord and Christ
[1:28:13] right that's why it's Lord Jesus
[1:28:16] Christ hallelujah amen what Peter was
[1:28:20] saying is you debase the man but God
[1:28:24] lifted his lifted him up right you put
[1:28:27] him to shame but God gave him a name
[1:28:30] that is above every name
[1:28:33] Hallelujah yes sir Philippians chapter 2
[1:28:38] let's read it verse 6 to
[1:28:41] 11 quoting Isaiah
[1:28:45] 45:23 this is a quotation of the Old
[1:28:49] Testament Paul said who being in the
[1:28:51] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[1:28:56] equal with
[1:28:58] God he didn't think it was something
[1:29:01] that he would be accountable for to say
[1:29:03] that he is God or that he is equal with
[1:29:06] God why because he is
[1:29:09] God but he made himself of no
[1:29:13] reputation we all want to have a good
[1:29:17] reputation but Christ made himself of no
[1:29:21] reputation yes and took upon him the
[1:29:24] form of a servant amen that's right
[1:29:27] that's right you were talking about
[1:29:29] races last night you know how people can
[1:29:31] be prejudiced over certain uh uh certain
[1:29:35] people
[1:29:37] hallelujah look at look look about the
[1:29:39] Lord Jesus look look at the Lord Jesus
[1:29:42] he took upon himself the form of a slave
[1:29:47] yeah and was made in the likeness of men
[1:29:51] exactly right
[1:29:52] right y I probably have the skin color
[1:29:56] of the Lord
[1:29:59] Jesus whether you agree or
[1:30:09] disagree and being found in a fashion as
[1:30:12] a man humbled himself and became
[1:30:16] obedient unto death even the death of
[1:30:20] the Cross where for God also had highly
[1:30:24] exalted him and given him a name which
[1:30:28] is above every
[1:30:32] name exactly right not just any godlings
[1:30:35] that they uh used to have the Greeks and
[1:30:38] the Roman mythology
[1:30:41] gods Hallelujah not just one of the
[1:30:44] Gods but he was he was given a name that
[1:30:48] is above every name amen right this is
[1:30:51] is the very name of
[1:30:53] God hallelujah amen and amen and at the
[1:30:57] name of
[1:30:59] Jesus look at Isaiah 45 and verse 23 you
[1:31:03] know it applies that prophecy to the
[1:31:07] name of Jesus At The Name of Jesus every
[1:31:11] knee should bow of things in heaven and
[1:31:14] things on earth and things under there
[1:31:16] Earth and and that every tongue should
[1:31:18] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[1:31:22] glory of God the Father Hallelujah
[1:31:25] that's
[1:31:26] right the Greek
[1:31:29] tetraman speaks about it YH W so sacred
[1:31:34] for the Jewish people to even utter it
[1:31:36] with their lips human lips cannot utter
[1:31:39] this name because this is the name of
[1:31:42] God Amen right
[1:31:45] Hallelujah the name of God himself
[1:31:50] amen that's
[1:31:54] why that Jewish RAB Rabbi
[1:31:59] understood I mean he knew it that Jesus
[1:32:03] was the Messiah he was the promised Pro
[1:32:06] Prophet Moses promised a prophet to come
[1:32:09] like unto him he was the child that was
[1:32:13] supposed to be given who whose name will
[1:32:16] be called wonderful Mighty God counselor
[1:32:20] Everlasting father amen he knew it well
[1:32:23] amen that that uh this was the the
[1:32:28] Messiah the prophet amen so what what
[1:32:32] Peter was
[1:32:33] saying is that the man's point of view
[1:32:37] was God was going to set as a
[1:32:40] prophet and the prophet is going to be a
[1:32:44] man and this
[1:32:46] man came to being and he fulfilled the
[1:32:50] scriptures and he was known to be the
[1:32:53] Lord Jesus Christ in the book of book of
[1:32:56] Acts it explicitly explains that it was
[1:32:59] the Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah
[1:33:02] that's why in The Book of Psalms I think
[1:33:04] it was in 110 um uh David said the Lord
[1:33:09] said unto my
[1:33:11] Lord hallelujah the Lord Yahweh said
[1:33:15] unto my Lord the prophet the son of man
[1:33:18] the Messiah
[1:33:20] Hallelujah so he was better better asked
[1:33:23] the the the rabbi what would be the
[1:33:26] relationship of the Prophet to
[1:33:30] yah and the rabbi said he would be
[1:33:35] yve Hallelujah let's no such thing as
[1:33:39] two persons in the
[1:33:43] godhead some group they're saying
[1:33:46] trinitarian is wrong because they
[1:33:47] believe in three Oneness in is wrong
[1:33:50] because they believe in one was Tess
[1:33:52] must be
[1:33:53] right now they're teaching two two
[1:33:56] Lords Hallelujah I don't find that in
[1:34:00] the
[1:34:04] message instead the brother brother BR
[1:34:06] said this in Hebrews chapter 4 then that
[1:34:10] theophany had to be made flesh he was
[1:34:14] first theophany before he became flesh
[1:34:17] amen yes sir and brother said not
[1:34:19] another person
[1:34:23] but the same person has to become flesh
[1:34:27] to take the sting out of death oh
[1:34:29] my so there goes your two person's
[1:34:33] Doctrine two
[1:34:35] Lords and then he goes on to say now
[1:34:38] when it said here that he emptied
[1:34:41] himself or who poured he poured out now
[1:34:45] we would think like this that he vomit
[1:34:49] up the English word emptied or poured
[1:34:52] out from him see something went out of
[1:34:55] him that was different from him this was
[1:34:59] the English word yeah it means that but
[1:35:02] the word kenas in the Greek does not
[1:35:05] mean that righten it does not mean he
[1:35:08] vomit up or some his arm went off and
[1:35:13] his eye went out another person yeah
[1:35:18] doesn't mean that no but the very same
[1:35:21] person of God glory changed into
[1:35:24] something else he poured himself into a
[1:35:28] mask behind the mask Hallelujah not
[1:35:30] another person but it's the very person
[1:35:33] of God oh my I like this godhead
[1:35:40] teaching
[1:35:42] Hallelujah tells us there's only one God
[1:35:46] Amen tells us and we can
[1:35:49] worship we can we can pour out our
