[17:23] me on Monday afternoon I couldn't tell

[17:54] large the hot dog but anyhow you don't
[17:58] know
[17:59] you know it was just insignificant
[18:01] sometimes about the different people we
[18:04] deal with during the day but let me tell
[18:06] you what
[18:08] uh almighty God
[18:10] might have sent them by
[18:12] another man
[18:14] that they give him three months to live
[18:16] five years ago
[18:20] young man's looking at me as a caregiver
[18:23] and the young man he took him to a to
[18:27] his doctor the other day and he told him
[18:29] it's his uncle to it and he said Bob he
[18:32] says you doing so well he said you can
[18:34] go in there by yourself
[18:36] yeah so he went in there and the doctor
[18:38] checked him over and everything he said
[18:40] well we'll see you next year like that
[18:41] you know and he's still on that three
[18:44] three month thing like that you know and
[18:47] I got to thinking about that and I told
[18:49] Stanley that's young man's looking after
[18:51] him I said you know
[18:53] uh major gods
[18:57] he is out
[19:00] waiting on him to tell him to stop
[19:04] you know we predestinated
[19:06] that's right if you ain't going out of
[19:09] here do you get in the position you're
[19:11] supposed to be
[19:13] yeah and he was given three mostly at
[19:15] five years ago
[19:16] and same thing with this man with this
[19:19] so you know I don't what the deal was

[30:08] down to his brothers and we forgot to
[30:10] announce this morning brother Aaron has
[30:12] gone up to brother Sparks to preach for
[30:15] him today so that's why he was missing
[30:17] you know today but we we thank the Lord
[30:20] for all things amen Matthew 5
[30:24] in Romans 10.
[30:26] Matthew 5 Romans 10
[30:29] . Lord Jesus
[30:31] we thank you
[30:33] thank you for everything father
[30:36] because we love you
[30:38] and truly when we hear that song about I
[30:40] love you Lord
[30:42] it rings deep into our heart
[30:45] and we just want you this day
[30:48] to realize that we love you
[30:51] and mother then if nothing else could be
[30:54] said we could just say that and go home
[30:56] Say I Love You Lord
[30:58] because you know from the depth of our
[31:00] hearts we mean that
[31:02] we're trying to talk about what you're
[31:03] trying to get to us
[31:05] yes why wouldn't we want to love you
[31:08] just have your way now lead us by thy
[31:11] Grace and understanding
[31:13] let your light shine in each one of our
[31:15] hearts forgive our sins
[31:17] leaders in that understanding years
[31:21] keep us in Jesus name
[31:26] Matthew 5.
[31:29] begin with verse 17.
[31:41] scripture turned on the wrong place
[31:53] I didn't want to read from there let's
[31:54] just go to Romans 10.
[31:56] we got from Matthew 5 we've been reading
[31:59] for for a while
[32:04] for some reason my
[32:06] Piper moved over so we was going
[32:10] to Romans
[32:12] because this is the main thing I want to
[32:14] get this afternoon
[32:16] Romans 10.
[32:20] let me just read verse
[32:25] 8 through 10.
[32:30] but what sayeth the the word is not thee
[32:32] even in thy mouth and thy heart that is
[32:35] the word of faith which we preach that
[32:37] if Thou shalt confess with thy mouth the
[32:39] Lord Jesus You Shall Believe in thine
[32:41] heart that God hath raised him from the
[32:43] dead
[32:44] thy shalt be saved for when the heart
[32:47] man believeth unto righteousness
[32:50] and with a mouth confession is made
[32:51] under salvation all right then we know
[32:54] that Matthew 5 48 says be therefore
[32:57] perfect right
[32:58] even as your father in Heaven is perfect
[33:02] and that's required you may be seated
[33:04] the Lord had his Blessing to the reading
[33:06] of the word but I just want to continue
[33:08] on the thought
[33:12] that we were trying to bring this
[33:13] morning but what I want to do is
[33:18] I told you we I go through stages so we
[33:21] were taking
[33:22] about three services there to spit stick
[33:24] with the Old Testament Saints
[33:27] and then this morning we brought it up
[33:29] to Jesus Christ that's right all right
[33:31] and we brought it up to the point of
[33:33] what
[33:34] thou Hast the words
[33:38] of eternal life
[33:41] yeah and as I've ending up the point
[33:43] this morning saying
[33:46] see nobody had the words of eternal life
[33:50] sure they did in the bases that they
[33:52] were speaking of Christ coming
[33:54] right
[33:56] I mean it's all a foundation coming up
[33:58] but then a man walked on this Earth one
[34:00] day that had the words in his kind of
[34:02] life right
[34:04] had he not spoke there in The Parables
[34:10] you know
[34:11] showing the sower and the things
[34:14] we would have never known
[34:16] about eternal life all right that's
[34:18] right
[34:19] we would have never known about a savior
[34:22] and what are you doing
[34:24] I would invite you to read those
[34:26] scriptures Matthew Mark Luke and John
[34:30] because to me that is the Keystone to
[34:33] bring us to a place to understand that's
[34:35] right
[34:37] what happened
[34:39] it tells us what happened
[34:44] man was doing great
[34:47] and Jesus said you would have had a
[34:49] cloak for your sins have thou not come
[34:51] right
[34:52] that's it now you have no covering right
[34:56] all right amen
[34:58] he brought it out in the open he
[34:59] expounded upon it he magnified it
[35:03] brought it out the word that even our
[35:04] thoughts we were saying this morning
[35:08] would condemn us
[35:11] how can the human moral
[35:13] start the thoughts
[35:16] of perfection right
[35:18] all right
[35:20] now how would it be then that we could
[35:25] no wonder it's always been no way
[35:30] that Mankind's always said
[35:33] Nobody's Perfect
[35:37] oh yes we love to quote there's none
[35:39] good no not one
[35:44] have you ever looked at who said that
[35:49] the Lord Jesus
[35:52] there is none good no not one
[35:55] because there's nothing within any of us
[36:00] that we could ever think about the point
[36:02] of being perfect
[36:07] but God said we must be perfect right
[36:10] and we were saying this morning that our
[36:12] righteousness must exceed the
[36:14] righteousness of the scribes and
[36:15] Pharisees
[36:18] are we will in no wise
[36:22] inner heaven
[36:25] no that's a great thing to think about
[36:27] right when you're talking about people
[36:29] that never committed sin that's right as
[36:32] far as what would be known in their day
[36:34] of sin
[36:37] if you could they would be killed
[36:43] see then that way we look at it of what
[36:45] is perfection
[36:48] now this is what I want to point to stay
[36:50] in your mind today
[36:51] I just mentioned it this morning
[36:56] we'll read it in a minute the prophet
[36:58] said you're either perfect
[37:00] are you lost
[37:03] now do you understand that
[37:06] okay
[37:08] see
[37:09] we want to get into the great
[37:11] explanations
[37:15] of
[37:17] but not really brother Dale oh
[37:22] you're leaving out and you've always
[37:25] taught us that
[37:27] that you begin your salvation with
[37:30] justification that's right
[37:34] and then you must come through
[37:35] sanctification that's right
[37:41] we see that neither one of those are the
[37:43] new birth
[37:46] so then the prophet is we'll read it in
[37:48] a minute you'll see he's right right
[37:52] but your mind and your mentality will
[37:54] run that
[37:57] you mean if I know how the baptism of
[38:00] the Holy Ghost is I'm lost that's
[38:02] exactly right
[38:04] he said but I've come through
[38:06] justification
[38:07] I've come through sanctification
[38:10] that's true
[38:12] but neither one of them will give you
[38:14] eternal life right that's right
[38:18] not in this day now there was a day
[38:20] under Luther justification brought them
[38:23] to Newburgh
[38:24] under Wesley sanctification brought them
[38:27] to demand
[38:28] but he won't bring it to us today
[38:30] all right
[38:31] he said but I'm believing them too
[38:34] okay sure right if you're believing unto
[38:38] that's fine but believing unto
[38:42] literally means what you're saying
[38:44] you're believing unto right
[38:47] it means you're looking forward to
[38:49] something else
[38:51] it means like in the Old Testament that
[38:54] when they made an offering they were
[38:56] looking unto all right
[39:01] see thank God for the truth that's what
[39:03] I said
[39:04] when I hear that song I Love You Lord
[39:06] you know I told you years ago
[39:09] I raised my hands when I say I love you
[39:11] because that's the sign that I mean
[39:15] I'm telling him I love you if you don't
[39:18] know I love you you're in bad shape
[39:21] but I'm telling him I love you
[39:23] because see salvation is of the Lord
[39:27] amen now I want that in your mind before
[39:30] we read the quotes of the prophet
[39:32] that to think about see unless you are
[39:36] born again
[39:41] see then
[39:43] you are not
[39:44] saved you're not perfect
[39:48] he said well you just got through
[39:49] preaching to us that repentance made us
[39:52] perfect it does go to chops It Off
[39:55] now we're going to require something
[39:57] else see
[39:58] we're coming into a situation now that
[40:02] repentance can be perfect
[40:05] and you're perfect because you repented
[40:07] exactly right right amen that's wiped
[40:10] away that's right but that won't give
[40:13] you the new birth no right now listen
[40:16] what I'm saying that won't cover you
[40:20] all right come on go to Future home
[40:23] because you repent doesn't cover your
[40:26] future that's all right amen
[40:29] are you listening that's right amen
[40:31] that's why I want to cover just pick up
[40:33] this to go on with it see
[40:37] if you repent that drops off you buy sin
[40:39] the prophet said that has nothing to do
[40:41] with the future read it page 14 15 16
[40:45] get your home
[40:47] that has nothing to do with the future
[40:51] because your sins are shut up
[40:54] because you're sanctified
[40:56] cleansing you
[40:58] that has nothing to do with future
[41:03] it's where you're at West Banks is gone
[41:06] right
[41:07] but when you receive the baptism of the
[41:09] Holy Ghost
[41:11] who's just as much that away no just as
[41:14] much by the way right right that's right
[41:16] because that's where you come to eternal
[41:18] life
[41:19] and that's where you come to really what
[41:21] you want to talk about
[41:24] being perfect
[41:25] right
[41:28] I was laying the foundation through the
[41:31] two matches you know
[41:33] to show you
[41:35] that God says
[41:38] under the atonement
[41:41] if you really offer that atonement
[41:43] sincerely
[41:46] not haphazardly we covered that right
[41:49] now just cause you throw the lamb down
[41:51] no but if you were really sincere
[42:00] God Chuck's healthy sins right right you
[42:02] stand perfect
[42:07] same thing then
[42:09] the animation in this day now right
[42:10] we're not talking about down in the ages
[42:12] now everybody with me yes so you you get
[42:15] something and you you've got to cover it
[42:17] because people's minds will run back and
[42:20] reverse that's right
[42:23] justification in the days of Martin
[42:25] Luther was the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[42:27] the new birth right right sanctification
[42:31] in the days of Wesley but it required in
[42:34] Wesley's day for you to be justified
[42:37] right right and then to be Sanctified
[42:40] right all right
[42:42] that was the new birth
[42:45] that gave them eternal life
[42:48] but neither one of them will give us
[42:50] eternal life today
[42:54] he would only be like an Old Testament
[42:56] just covered right
[43:00] you can't divorce sin you can't put it
[43:02] away
[43:03] it can because you won't answer that no
[43:06] more
[43:06] but the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:10] the new birth today
[43:14] all right
[43:15] it gives you eternal life yes like the
[43:19] words of eternal life
[43:23] have been made alive
[43:25] Jesus had the words of eternal life we
[43:28] read that this morning right right Peter
[43:30] said that
[43:31] it's because he said dark to Christ the
[43:34] son of the Living God that was a
[43:35] revelation unto it amen
[43:38] I didn't get into the new birth
[43:43] that did not give Peter the new birth
[43:45] just because he said that because you're
[43:47] going over you'll find out at Murray or
[43:49] not the one said
[43:51] the dark the Christ the son of the
[43:53] Living God also one of them even said
[43:55] the Christ of God
[43:57] I didn't give him the new birth
[44:01] see those were the days when it was just
[44:04] the words of eternal life
[44:08] but then it had to be revealed right and
[44:11] that's what happened on the day
[44:12] Pentecost
[44:15] the words of eternal life become Eternal
[44:18] right
[44:20] but I believe the new birth is the birth
[44:22] of the word all right
[44:25] see eternal life
[44:29] is not just a
[44:31] call or an idea
[44:35] he's eternal life right the word has
[44:38] been made alive
[44:40] in you
[44:43] right
[44:45] see then we went from this morning and
[44:48] said brought it up to Jesus
[44:49] he had the words of eternal life
[44:54] but that's all he could do was slow it
[44:56] down
[44:57] he could not give eternal life to it
[45:01] right the father's only revealer of the
[45:03] word so he couldn't reveal it run around
[45:06] and said Jesus said even my own life
[45:09] did not reveal that unto you
[45:13] now then see when with the death
[45:16] Pentecost Kenny
[45:20] he didn't make that word eternal yep
[45:23] that was so down in their heart right
[45:25] right that's why the scripture said
[45:27] Faith cometh by hearing
[45:30] and what and hearing by the word amen in
[45:34] other words the hearing of the word
[45:36] brings you to a recognition brings you
[45:40] to a state of understanding brings you
[45:42] to a place of saying I'm lost that's
[45:44] right
[45:45] brings you to a condition to where
[45:47] things can happen unto you
[45:49] but it doesn't give you eternal life
[45:51] right
[45:53] you can quote all the Bible you can
[45:55] quote all the message that doesn't give
[45:56] you eternal life
[45:58] it has to be the experience of eternal
[46:00] life all right the word has to be made
[46:04] alive
[46:06] like I was trying to say this morning at
[46:08] the end of it see for two years I
[46:10] studied the message
[46:14] and people were telling me you know this
[46:16] one brother's specialist one day said
[46:17] well what do you mean you're not born
[46:19] again
[46:21] did you believe the message
[46:26] well that that wasn't it
[46:29] that's why I believe there's not too
[46:30] many the prophet said new verse today
[46:33] right right you know why
[46:36] if people are taking a concept a thought
[46:39] or an idea
[46:40] instead of doing just what I told the
[46:43] brother this morning go confess yourself
[46:45] into it all right that's right if you
[46:49] need eternal life go confess yourself
[46:52] into it you need healing confess
[46:54] yourself into it all right
[46:57] say what God says because that's why we
[46:59] read Romans
[47:01] you believe in your heart that's
[47:03] wonderful right
[47:04] but you got to confess with your mouth
[47:06] it's a combination that's right see your
[47:10] mouth must say what your heart believes
[47:13] you say one thing with your with your
[47:15] mouth oh yes I believe Jesus I believe
[47:17] in being saved but it really don't
[47:19] matter how I live that's right now you
[47:21] can fashion drunk that's right
[47:25] don't come out of your mouth it wouldn't
[47:26] have compared to what was in your heart
[47:31] see then perfection
[47:34] then in this day when you're talking
[47:36] about perfection
[47:38] you're not just trying to talk about
[47:40] justification
[47:42] yeah that does Chop It Off
[47:45] and you don't have to repent no more of
[47:47] that that's our problem right how many
[47:49] of you would admit don't raise your hand
[47:51] you don't have to
[47:52] but that many of you would admit that
[47:54] you're still repenting what you've done
[47:56] 20 years ago
[47:57] 40 years ago 50 years ago right
[48:01] right that's right right
[48:04] Satan still brings up things you've done
[48:06] 30 years ago and you're repenting of it
[48:11] well I like that song
[48:13] what sins are you talking about
[48:16] if you repented
[48:19] God don't remember that that's right
[48:21] right we need to work on what we do now
[48:25] you know amen right because if you truly
[48:29] said I'm sorry
[48:31] for what you've done and you really mean
[48:33] it then God cleansed it right all right
[48:37] that's a form of perfection
[48:41] but that's not the Old Testament
[48:42] perfection
[48:44] all right those that put you not guilty
[48:50] right right yes that makes you not
[48:53] guilty
[48:55] but it doesn't make you eternal
[48:58] it didn't make them Eternal right right
[49:02] you see why we could spend months and
[49:04] much more on the point of trying to get
[49:06] it to you I wanted you to see that those
[49:08] Old Testament saints were perfect
[49:12] God said they were
[49:14] well because they were forgiven yes
[49:19] all right
[49:21] but then now
[49:24] to be as they were will not give you the
[49:27] new birth that's right that's right amen
[49:29] for sure Amen to be where Luther was
[49:32] won't give you the new birth to be where
[49:34] Wesley was won't give you the new bird
[49:39] but to be worthless this is the street
[49:41] Pentecost
[49:42] which was the New Birth that came
[49:46] do that makes you then perfect
[49:49] all right
[49:51] see then we'll go into it another
[49:53] message going down the line we'll go
[49:55] into the statue of a perfect man
[49:57] and we'll go
[49:59] into
[50:01] things you know
[50:04] I'm covering it how did that word does
[50:07] perfect does mean a full age right
[50:11] Etc
[50:12] but it meant the same in the Old
[50:13] Testament right
[50:16] it meant the same of
[50:18] Satan
[50:20] the same definition just a little
[50:22] different wording from the Old Testament
[50:24] perfect to the New Testament Word
[50:25] Perfect
[50:27] Satan was perfect yep
[50:30] because God created him perfect and
[50:33] that's right
[50:34] he can't create anything imperfect
[50:37] same word for you and I to get the new
[50:41] birth on you
[50:45] all right my father with me because I'm
[50:47] just trying to hit a point this is the
[50:48] finish of this morning
[50:52] see then Jesus had the words of eternal
[50:54] life amen right but there was no one at
[50:59] that place
[51:00] could comprehend what he was just saying
[51:03] that's right that's right they finally
[51:05] got down to the lies and said something
[51:07] he said you mean you now believe right
[51:10] all right
[51:12] the best they could do was what we were
[51:14] read during the scripture that we
[51:16] believe
[51:17] right that thou Hast the words of
[51:20] eternal life right you know that was the
[51:23] best they could do because you couldn't
[51:24] be born again
[51:26] Jesus came under the law to redeemed
[51:29] them or under the law Matthew Mark Luke
[51:31] and John is not the New Testament
[51:34] Jesus Christ came in the Old Testament
[51:39] yep dude that's what's real hard to get
[51:41] drilled into our minds because we've
[51:43] been taught all our life turned the
[51:45] first book of the New Testament
[51:46] everybody turn the Matthews
[51:48] has been instilled into your mind that
[51:51] Matthew is the New Testament and it's
[51:54] hard for me to convince you that it's
[51:56] not
[51:59] and then when I get you convinced to
[52:01] where I say turn to the first book of
[52:03] the New Testament
[52:04] you'll finally turn to the book of Acts
[52:08] why cause I'll beat you over the head
[52:10] too much with it until now you remember
[52:12] it
[52:13] but is it a reality
[52:15] that's it right
[52:17] amen see Jesus had the words of eternal
[52:20] life
[52:21] right and like I preached to you before
[52:23] if he had not have shown in us into the
[52:26] Earth
[52:27] right not in that ground
[52:30] he showed us
[52:33] the word
[52:35] and not a bride ready he said well she
[52:37] wouldn't even matter
[52:39] no
[52:41] but the word was saying right
[52:44] the word for sir
[52:47] but see the Holy Ghost couldn't fall on
[52:49] that word right that's right because the
[52:51] Holy Ghost has not been given the Bible
[52:52] says
[52:54] go Jesus had not been glorified right
[52:57] see they went away he could be glorified
[52:59] would it be crucified
[53:02] all right
[53:04] see then
[53:06] bringing it then to the New Testament
[53:08] under the word perfect
[53:14] with all of this in the background
[53:18] does somebody understand what I mean
[53:21] I know that that seems to be a a dry
[53:23] spot
[53:25] do you understand what I'm trying to get
[53:26] at the Old Testament Saints did not have
[53:30] eternal life in their soul because there
[53:33] was no way really animal life to be able
[53:35] to get back into the believer right
[53:37] right amen right
[53:39] right so there was no way for them to
[53:42] have eternal life in their soul right
[53:44] that doesn't mean that you're lost
[53:47] that doesn't mean that there are you
[53:48] know no hopes
[53:50] that means they were covered
[53:52] yeah and that's why they couldn't come
[53:54] up
[53:56] but when Jesus raised
[53:59] some of them could come up
[54:01] but not all of them
[54:04] right because there's a lot of them
[54:05] didn't have the faith
[54:08] it's like Jesus was seen a 500 Brethren
[54:10] after the Rapture the Bible called
[54:13] that on the 120 number huh
[54:16] what happened to 380. let's saw him
[54:21] oh if I had just been back there if I
[54:23] had just been back there I could have
[54:24] seen you might believe it you liar you
[54:26] got the devil on your mind instead of
[54:28] God's word
[54:31] we are what we would have been there if
[54:34] we are here with the word we would have
[54:36] been with the word then but if we're not
[54:37] on the word here we wouldn't have been
[54:39] with a word back there
[54:41] that's right it won't change us we are
[54:44] what we are that's right
[54:46] if you won't stand up for the word now
[54:48] you wouldn't have stood up for the word
[54:49] if he seems that night I want to love to
[54:52] sing brother Branham I would
[54:53] I would have loved to see him and been
[54:55] in the ministry there so you was that's
[54:58] wonderful
[55:00] but that don't give you eternal life
[55:03] all right I don't give you eternal life
[55:05] don't you solve the profit that's right
[55:07] I don't give you eternal life cause a
[55:08] prophet get you thus saith the Lord
[55:11] you're healed or whatever you know
[55:12] things happen I don't give you right
[55:15] is when you receive eternal life right
[55:19] all right so you're not sure we have to
[55:21] pick up in the New Testament
[55:23] you're trying to work bring the word
[55:25] perfect
[55:28] but let's don't take it so high
[55:31] that was the purpose of using the Old
[55:34] Testament as examples right that you
[55:37] could look back there and see them
[55:40] but a man like Noah
[55:43] yeah
[55:44] you know
[55:46] good
[55:48] be called perfect
[55:51] and die of drunk
[55:54] right right
[55:58] well he got on perfect
[56:03] there ain't no thing being we'll get to
[56:05] it the minute bro said you're either a
[56:07] saint or you're not he said there's no
[56:09] such thing as a black white bird
[56:11] right so God is not going to say about
[56:13] Noah in one verse and he's perfect in
[56:15] the next verse say he's a bad guy right
[56:19] right and next verse he'll tell you what
[56:20] he done all right
[56:22] Don't Call Him a bad guy right amen
[56:25] that's my point
[56:28] moved in into the New Testament keep the
[56:30] same shouting your channel of mine
[56:34] that
[56:35] did
[56:37] repentance today
[56:39] won't bring you the new birth right
[56:42] right man
[56:45] it takes the person of Jesus Christ to
[56:47] come amen now I'm not saying that you
[56:50] can't come right up here
[56:51] and say right here and go through
[56:53] justification say in case the baptism it
[56:55] all goes at one time I'm not going to
[56:57] tell you that because it can happen
[56:58] right but it would be a very very very
[57:01] very very very very very how many more
[57:04] varies do I need
[57:05] rare occasion
[57:07] right right right amen
[57:12] it would be something that would be can
[57:14] be done but
[57:16] probably call them Paradox is that the
[57:18] word for him to use or something
[57:20] you know can be done
[57:22] right that's why you can't tell them say
[57:24] well come up here and be justified then
[57:26] go back come back and do something no
[57:28] because it might come up and go through
[57:29] it all at one time right
[57:31] that's left to the person
[57:33] all right
[57:35] but on the biggest percentage then
[57:38] I know people even tell you they'll say
[57:40] you're not supposed to tarry for the
[57:42] Holy Ghost well the Bible said he did
[57:43] right
[57:45] yeah
[57:48] you don't have to try and just take it
[57:50] well where you gonna take it
[57:53] what are you gonna do
[57:56] we'll just receive it
[58:00] yeah I'm sorry to not have a good memory
[58:04] and that's what gets me about some of
[58:06] you
[58:07] you know we'd be talking and you'll say
[58:10] I seen that right off
[58:12] when I heard it the first time I
[58:14] believed it
[58:15] and I'm thinking
[58:19] I wish I didn't think
[58:21] I'm thinking it took me about three
[58:24] years to get that one thing drilled into
[58:26] that person
[58:27] thank you
[58:30] they're saying I just got an old one why
[58:32] don't you get it one time why you know
[58:34] just just receive it I received it just
[58:36] like that in anything
[58:40] you know you want to take them and say
[58:42] don't pray for the person you're telling
[58:44] them a lie yeah
[58:47] but that ain't nice
[58:49] I try not to be that away you know
[58:52] but I'm just telling you the truth
[58:55] I never told nothing I thought was the
[58:57] lie I said I just try to tell you the
[58:58] truth about it all right
[59:00] it was two years and I was confessing
[59:03] before God gave me the new birth
[59:06] well you sure I agree with you
[59:10] um but I'm a bad guy it just takes a
[59:12] long time to get through to me but you
[59:14] know what he does get through all right
[59:15] he has been able to get through and
[59:18] bring me through all of it you know it's
[59:20] all right
[59:22] brother Mo had a dream about me one time
[59:25] and he told me
[59:27] and in his dream
[59:29] he he seen me
[59:31] and you know he we're going somewhere
[59:34] and I don't remember what he said he was
[59:36] in like a car or something he's got
[59:37] there
[59:38] he said look around like a message here
[59:40] I come ride the bicycle
[59:43] but you know what I got there
[59:47] I might have been a whole lot slower
[59:50] or according to his dream you know all
[59:52] right but I'm just telling you that part
[59:53] because listen
[59:57] but when you come into receiving Jesus
[1:00:01] Christ as your savior
[1:00:05] have you received the person of the word
[1:00:08] right
[1:00:09] you've heard the word you've talked
[1:00:11] about the word you sung about it you
[1:00:14] confessed it but have you really
[1:00:15] received the person and the word right
[1:00:17] right that's it and then what I'm saying
[1:00:21] this morning right at the end where the
[1:00:23] prophet of God said that those great
[1:00:25] things to him was a revelation
[1:00:28] right
[1:00:31] did he see a vision
[1:00:34] so you're going to run a ground after a
[1:00:35] while you can run okay with it but then
[1:00:37] somebody comes along like me to say oh
[1:00:39] but what about brother run said when you
[1:00:40] come to the third bullet with no vision
[1:00:42] then we know nothing
[1:00:44] he said something just told him
[1:00:47] whatever you have need of
[1:00:50] he didn't see a vision of squirrels
[1:00:55] he said whatever you have need of you
[1:00:57] say it and it'll be to her
[1:01:02] it was a revelation
[1:01:06] the new birth is a revelation
[1:01:10] of Jesus Christ
[1:01:12] Mr God revealed personally to you I
[1:01:15] think it's Faith 45 personally to you
[1:01:20] where he spoke right to you all right
[1:01:24] yeah I've heard people say well I think
[1:01:26] I got the Holy Ghost because the
[1:01:27] preacher said I did
[1:01:29] well put that
[1:01:33] what if the preacher back for you
[1:01:36] Nia wondered what he was saying it right
[1:01:39] why he was getting it or not you know
[1:01:41] right right
[1:01:43] but you see that way we're building up
[1:01:45] on something we want somebody to tell us
[1:01:47] something
[1:01:50] we want somebody to tell us what this
[1:01:52] message is
[1:01:53] the brother asked me to write down
[1:01:54] Daniel 70 weeks I said brother
[1:01:57] don't know me making me right that you
[1:01:59] can hear the tape
[1:02:00] if I wrote it down you wouldn't be
[1:02:02] because you couldn't rule down first no
[1:02:04] leave it all life and yesterday when we
[1:02:05] said the notes back there for the for
[1:02:07] the wedding you know because we I was
[1:02:09] trying to get it back to work keep it
[1:02:10] inside my Bible where it looks odd you
[1:02:12] know it's like downsizing it and writing
[1:02:14] it real small thing and they looked at
[1:02:16] it and I said you think you can read
[1:02:18] that and they said no I said I can't eat
[1:02:21] it when it gets cold but if it's true
[1:02:24] you know but listen
[1:02:28] I believe then the new birth is a birth
[1:02:30] of the word
[1:02:33] the words you've heard that's why you've
[1:02:36] always got to hear that's right
[1:02:39] how here we you know and how is it that
[1:02:42] you can't hear you can't hear without a
[1:02:43] preacher
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:46] we'll bless God I didn't hear no
[1:02:48] preacher I was listening to the prophet
[1:02:50] what do you think he wouldn't appreciate
[1:02:52] it
[1:02:53] I was just reading the Bible what Paul
[1:02:56] said will you think Paul wasn't a
[1:02:58] preacher yeah amen you see it sounds
[1:03:00] good don't it
[1:03:02] but when you analyze it
[1:03:08] do you have eternal life
[1:03:11] man
[1:03:13] if you do you don't have to worry about
[1:03:14] doctrines your ideas right sure
[1:03:18] we can have problems yeah okay how's
[1:03:20] your healing that's right
[1:03:23] but how can the Holy Ghost agree
[1:03:25] with a false Doctrine
[1:03:28] that's right
[1:03:30] I told the sister that one time and I
[1:03:32] said if I had no other thing
[1:03:34] as an Evidence of the Holy Ghost
[1:03:37] than the fact that he's kept me away
[1:03:39] from everything
[1:03:41] I said I would shout like glory and say
[1:03:43] I've got the new birth
[1:03:48] because something killed me
[1:03:52] why don't you think that away right
[1:03:56] yeah but I want to do that
[1:03:59] sorry
[1:04:00] God allows you run around and said he
[1:04:03] said you lay under the spout long enough
[1:04:04] then you'll come through speaking in
[1:04:06] tongues that's right well you know I've
[1:04:08] been on this about 40 something years
[1:04:10] and ain't never spoken tons yet
[1:04:13] I'm Amish
[1:04:15] do you think you come along and say well
[1:04:17] we spoke in Newtons because you changed
[1:04:18] your language well that's okay but
[1:04:19] that's still not what I wasn't talking
[1:04:21] about I ain't smoking trouble right
[1:04:26] what am I going to put into the house
[1:04:28] that smoking talk to me because I'm not
[1:04:29] born again I'm not gonna put a cat away
[1:04:31] right how
[1:04:33] amen look coach of Pentecostal he said
[1:04:35] you ain't got it you remember what
[1:04:37] running around run into the two guys you
[1:04:40] know in his first Minister it to Jesus
[1:04:42] name you know
[1:04:44] when I was speaking Tom's other
[1:04:45] interpret she's come up on one of them
[1:04:47] said he's genuine Christian
[1:04:49] dope on the other one said he's a
[1:04:51] hypocrite
[1:04:52] he said one of them said if you ever
[1:04:55] spoke in tongues he said no city grew
[1:04:56] with it you ain't got it you can Bank on
[1:04:58] one thing that was the hypocrite
[1:05:03] that wasn't the guy
[1:05:05] that really had it right right right
[1:05:07] because that's what's so hard to try to
[1:05:10] say now to you
[1:05:12] the the point I'm trying to get across
[1:05:14] right
[1:05:16] when we read where the Prophet says
[1:05:18] you're either
[1:05:20] a Christian or you're lost
[1:05:24] all right now A lot of people are in the
[1:05:27] stages of justification it's just
[1:05:29] repented amen right
[1:05:31] is the prophet saying they're lost like
[1:05:35] the word lost
[1:05:36] totally gone
[1:05:38] no but he's saying you're not born again
[1:05:40] yet right right
[1:05:43] and he'll even says it's your
[1:05:46] if you die in that state you're going to
[1:05:48] heaven
[1:05:50] you want them close right
[1:05:53] so you said it said you were going to
[1:05:55] heaven if you die in that state
[1:05:58] because you're believing unto amen
[1:06:01] but he didn't say he was in The Bride
[1:06:02] that's right he didn't say he was born
[1:06:04] again that's right so that's why it's so
[1:06:07] hard is to try to tell you now to get to
[1:06:09] a point and say hold it now
[1:06:12] the prophet of God has got to be right
[1:06:16] amen because you're either lost or
[1:06:18] you're saved all right that's right
[1:06:21] when I'm in between no they ain't going
[1:06:24] to win between
[1:06:26] you may be in between all right but
[1:06:29] there is no in between
[1:06:31] God don't count the in between he counts
[1:06:34] it that he could even send you to heaven
[1:06:36] as a foolish virgin right
[1:06:39] but you're not listening what he's
[1:06:41] saying
[1:06:43] you're either born again or you're not
[1:06:46] in Black right amen
[1:06:49] amen he says in one of these quotes
[1:06:50] we'll get to it in a minute he said
[1:06:52] you're either born again or you're not
[1:06:54] going to heaven
[1:06:58] now Analyze That
[1:07:00] we're supposed to go then brother Dale
[1:07:04] they don't want to happen right
[1:07:07] yeah but you conjured out a prophet
[1:07:09] because he said if you're not born again
[1:07:10] and you said the food is burned is not
[1:07:12] born again
[1:07:15] because there's going to be a lot of
[1:07:16] people in heaven you have any trouble
[1:07:21] so then when he's saying you're either
[1:07:24] lost or you're saved
[1:07:26] he's not making gray areas
[1:07:30] he's telling it like the Bible says
[1:07:32] right
[1:07:34] but now there might be a lot of us in
[1:07:36] Gray areas
[1:07:38] Lewisburg is going to heaven one day
[1:07:41] right right because they're going to be
[1:07:42] giving eternal life
[1:07:44] but you know what
[1:07:46] now let me say it brother Dave's
[1:07:48] language
[1:07:48] the foolish version is not going to
[1:07:51] heaven without eternal life
[1:07:53] fun all right okay
[1:07:59] wait a minute what do you mean I mean
[1:08:01] they're going to the white Throne
[1:08:03] judgment to receive eternal life and
[1:08:05] then they go to heaven right they can't
[1:08:07] go to heaven without eternal life that's
[1:08:09] right right
[1:08:10] they ain't going to heaven and get
[1:08:12] eternal life that's right
[1:08:15] so now we're right right see people hear
[1:08:19] me say something make a statement Lord
[1:08:21] look what he's saying all right
[1:08:24] I'm trying to express what the prophet
[1:08:27] had said to us
[1:08:28] and doing my job and he said the
[1:08:30] preacher's supposed to take it break it
[1:08:32] down all right like I said this morning
[1:08:34] about to run across there what run
[1:08:36] around and said run it across without
[1:08:38] stopping to emphasize for a long period
[1:08:40] of time or putting in for instance and
[1:08:43] it looked just like he's saying
[1:08:45] something wrong
[1:08:47] I'd have been doing that I'd put it in
[1:08:49] princess
[1:08:52] but they're just trying to translate
[1:08:54] words
[1:08:57] around and say let's band and address
[1:08:59] the third person of the trinity
[1:09:02] oh my that's a direct quote
[1:09:07] really random I didn't think you
[1:09:09] believed in the Trinity I don't
[1:09:12] well why did you say that
[1:09:16] well I said word confuse everybody else
[1:09:19] I guess the best way you did that
[1:09:21] but are you listening and then we get on
[1:09:23] to what we're trying to talk about
[1:09:26] so then when you're coming into the New
[1:09:28] Testament now
[1:09:29] remember
[1:09:32] on the day of Pentecost
[1:09:37] anybody with me not a sister Street
[1:09:39] it'll be your son but on the day of
[1:09:41] Pentecost in the Bible
[1:09:43] you had to be justified
[1:09:45] Sanctified before you could be filled
[1:09:48] with the Holy Ghost
[1:09:50] there wasn't nobody in the upper room
[1:09:53] that wasn't Justified and Sanctified
[1:09:55] that received the baptism of the Holy
[1:09:57] Ghost
[1:10:00] now see that's where when I start
[1:10:02] talking people they dry up only because
[1:10:05] they know that what I just said right
[1:10:07] they just don't agree with it
[1:10:10] but just explain it some other way
[1:10:13] well how did them people go through that
[1:10:15] don't ask me
[1:10:18] I know they were three years in Mountain
[1:10:20] High walking with the Lord Jesus and
[1:10:22] brother Brown said that made them
[1:10:23] Justified and Sanctified and listen I
[1:10:26] even know how to quote
[1:10:28] he said that was only potential
[1:10:32] do you want that one
[1:10:34] Peter and them were only potentially
[1:10:36] Justified to Sanctified
[1:10:39] oh really
[1:10:40] right
[1:10:41] sure but they got the baptism of the
[1:10:44] Holy Ghost
[1:10:47] yeah
[1:10:49] because the reason it was potential is
[1:10:52] because Jesus Christ hadn't made a way
[1:10:54] yet
[1:10:56] the way wasn't made perfect so it was
[1:10:59] potential right that's right
[1:11:01] Earnest if you want to call it right
[1:11:03] right
[1:11:05] they were Justified and Sanctified come
[1:11:07] on but your Prophet said it was only
[1:11:09] potential
[1:11:11] because Jesus Christ did not die
[1:11:15] only after the death of Jesus Christ can
[1:11:18] you come through justificated the same
[1:11:19] case the baptism I'm gonna hold up
[1:11:20] that's right when Jesus Christ died that
[1:11:23] place them that was potential
[1:11:26] okay
[1:11:28] potentially Justified and Sanctified
[1:11:30] when he died and they believed it went
[1:11:32] in that upper room that was no longer
[1:11:34] potential right
[1:11:36] the way was made
[1:11:38] the Holy Ghost could fall
[1:11:40] they fell on them that believed the word
[1:11:42] the 100 380 didn't make it
[1:11:45] right I ain't saying they didn't make it
[1:11:46] later
[1:11:47] never I said you didn't make it later
[1:11:49] right because they were called Brethren
[1:11:50] right
[1:11:52] that's what it says in the Bible it was
[1:11:54] three up 300 500 Brethren maybe they
[1:11:57] went on they didn't received the
[1:11:58] Holocaust they didn't get enough room
[1:11:59] right right
[1:12:01] me
[1:12:02] all right
[1:12:04] that new birth in the upper room
[1:12:07] didn't make a bunch of blabbering babies
[1:12:09] as everybody thinks that's right it made
[1:12:12] them with a statue of a perfect man
[1:12:15] to right here and I point to it where it
[1:12:17] says the Holy Spirit
[1:12:20] because they didn't get to Hitch them
[1:12:21] right right that's what your Prophet
[1:12:24] said
[1:12:25] well if it didn't get the headphones it
[1:12:27] didn't get the Holy Ghost well that's
[1:12:28] why he put right there Holy Spirit
[1:12:31] right here
[1:12:33] man it's The Headstone of love amen he
[1:12:37] said The Headstone did not come yet and
[1:12:39] but it was enough to bring them into the
[1:12:41] body of Christ amen
[1:12:44] all right
[1:12:46] it may then
[1:12:49] them sealed in as the faith of the
[1:12:52] father
[1:12:54] right but the five thousand or three
[1:12:55] thousand that received it in just a
[1:12:57] little while after them that's right
[1:12:59] they didn't make it up here
[1:13:03] they didn't make it up here
[1:13:05] they made it right here right right they
[1:13:08] were born again in faith how could they
[1:13:09] be born again even higher than that
[1:13:13] because they only heard one sermon
[1:13:17] but you know what that one sermon done
[1:13:20] it put them through justification
[1:13:23] sanctification and the baptism of the
[1:13:26] Holy Ghost
[1:13:27] under one sermon so I said I'm not going
[1:13:30] to tell somebody that you can't do it
[1:13:32] you know now come on don't you you get
[1:13:34] in with me it didn't this when when the
[1:13:36] Holy Ghost fell on the death Pentagon it
[1:13:38] didn't just justify the people
[1:13:41] and then they might have to go they
[1:13:42] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:45] Peter says to Peter that says the house
[1:13:48] forbid we've been by sin they receive
[1:13:50] the Holy Ghost like we
[1:13:53] they received a new birth right that's
[1:13:56] where people can't follow brother Run's
[1:13:57] message and he'll say I met people that
[1:13:59] had to Holy Ghost 50 years before I did
[1:14:01] he said exactly like the book of Acts
[1:14:05] later now the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:14:07] the same as the upper room experience
[1:14:08] right go to that and heard the word
[1:14:10] right right
[1:14:12] see the Holy Ghost can only quick and
[1:14:14] what's in you
[1:14:17] and that's why there's not so many new
[1:14:18] births
[1:14:20] why
[1:14:21] gonna happen you bring a New Birth by
[1:14:23] preaching false Doctrine
[1:14:25] right
[1:14:27] right
[1:14:29] just one that we need the words of
[1:14:32] eternal life
[1:14:34] we need to realize this message
[1:14:36] now I can preach to people about the new
[1:14:39] birth right where in Brazil we all got
[1:14:42] it we're just waiting on you to get it
[1:14:43] well okay one of these days I'll get it
[1:14:45] we'll all happen
[1:14:47] blessing I just don't believe it that
[1:14:49] way or I wouldn't be preaching this to
[1:14:51] me I'd just be at home studied myself
[1:14:54] right
[1:14:55] I'll be sitting down listening to
[1:14:56] somebody else
[1:14:57] that's what I've always said it took a
[1:14:59] good old Baptist
[1:15:01] I've talked to Pentecostal preachers
[1:15:04] they knew no more about the New Birth
[1:15:06] then when you in the Baptist Church
[1:15:10] the only difference was we believe they
[1:15:13] shouted we believe they spoke in tongues
[1:15:18] right
[1:15:19] listen church I'm just trying to get
[1:15:21] something to cross but if I don't get
[1:15:23] into these notes I don't worry about
[1:15:24] nothing I got plenty of time
[1:15:28] but
[1:15:30] you're either perfect or you're lost all
[1:15:33] right
[1:15:34] then when we read these things don't get
[1:15:36] all tangled up with it that's right
[1:15:39] that's right well I don't I don't know
[1:15:40] whether I'm saying or not within you're
[1:15:43] lost
[1:15:43] right
[1:15:46] yeah because we just read that's right
[1:15:49] you believe in your heart
[1:15:52] and your mouth says what's in your heart
[1:15:56] it's not believing your heart
[1:15:58] I think I'm saved right maybe I am I
[1:16:02] read the message of the hours so that
[1:16:03] means I got to that's not the evidence
[1:16:04] okay that's right
[1:16:07] no move the only evidence you're
[1:16:08] probably never put yourself on was one
[1:16:10] thing right whether or not the spirit in
[1:16:12] you agrees with the word right amen
[1:16:15] right
[1:16:17] right now if the spirit in me will keep
[1:16:19] on agreeing with the word I know for
[1:16:20] certain it's not the Holy Ghost all
[1:16:22] right
[1:16:23] you don't have to tell me I know myself
[1:16:27] but I'm trying to get to point to you
[1:16:31] to where you won't be confused later and
[1:16:34] then we read it
[1:16:36] and then you're you're fumbling
[1:16:38] backwards and forth in your mind
[1:16:40] and I thought the prophet said she went
[1:16:42] to lie I thought it was this way I
[1:16:43] thought it was anyway well get up tell
[1:16:45] me your thoughts
[1:16:48] tell me what eternal life is
[1:16:53] I'll be glad to sit and listen to you
[1:16:56] my brother Davis just believe the
[1:16:58] message let's Baptist right well I shot
[1:17:01] it that's meant to this
[1:17:03] costume
[1:17:08] I said Hail Mary that's happening right
[1:17:14] I believe everything the prophet said
[1:17:16] that's all of them put together amen
[1:17:20] right but you know yourself
[1:17:24] because a lot of you have been around at
[1:17:26] least 20 years
[1:17:29] and you know yourself even in the past
[1:17:31] 20 years you've seen a lot of these old
[1:17:33] heads that was in the message fall off
[1:17:36] after Doctrine that's right oh yeah I'm
[1:17:38] sure you know that right
[1:17:42] well evidently they didn't know the Holy
[1:17:43] Ghost
[1:17:45] well who are you to be judging I'm me
[1:17:47] who are you
[1:17:48] I get away from that saying who are you
[1:17:51] Jr and I'm Sue Ellen or whatever you
[1:17:52] know so that was an old statement made
[1:17:54] years ago off of a movie
[1:17:57] goat it simply means who you think you
[1:17:59] are
[1:18:00] you're judging my my one rotten apple by
[1:18:02] your whole bushel it's rotten
[1:18:04] you want another languages or whatever
[1:18:08] I'm just trying to get down this
[1:18:09] honestly talk to you
[1:18:13] do you really see that under the New
[1:18:15] Testament then where we're at today
[1:18:17] we're back to the Pentecost
[1:18:19] Lutheran M could be justified and be
[1:18:22] born again
[1:18:24] of this day that's right we are to
[1:18:27] return to Pentecost Azusa Street where
[1:18:30] the people likes it or not Azusa Street
[1:18:32] run around said was the baptism of the
[1:18:35] Holy Ghost
[1:18:37] even calls it be profit amen 464 single
[1:18:41] book
[1:18:42] the prophet came himself in the fullness
[1:18:46] in the baptism he said that's right
[1:18:49] see we don't want to quote them
[1:18:52] when I just can't sing well I don't care
[1:18:53] what you can't see I don't care what I
[1:18:55] can't see what does God say
[1:19:00] amen if he says I'm perfect I'm perfect
[1:19:03] you argue the point with it
[1:19:09] but if he says that I'm not perfect I'm
[1:19:11] not perfect
[1:19:13] I have no argument right man I've got
[1:19:17] his word right what do you see what I'm
[1:19:19] talking about so now when we read these
[1:19:22] get your mind into this state of what
[1:19:24] I'm talking about
[1:19:27] now when the prophet says you're either
[1:19:29] a sinner or a
[1:19:30] Saint you're either saved or you're lost
[1:19:34] and if you're not saved you ain't going
[1:19:36] to heaven right get all of that foolish
[1:19:39] virgins and all of those things out here
[1:19:42] die behind you
[1:19:43] get it down to what he said Is Right
[1:19:46] the Bible don't Define foolish virgins
[1:19:53] it does work it puts it in the scripture
[1:19:55] you understand what I mean but it
[1:19:57] doesn't break it down
[1:19:59] the Bible don't make one thing putting
[1:20:01] us to heaven in another law what I told
[1:20:03] you every foolish version that ever goes
[1:20:06] to heaven is one day going to receive
[1:20:08] eternal life and to watch your own
[1:20:10] judgment right
[1:20:13] so then nobody's going to heaven without
[1:20:15] eternal life
[1:20:18] is that Central right yes
[1:20:20] yes what else would be said
[1:20:25] that's why I love him
[1:20:27] because he can show it to us and he
[1:20:30] shows it to me to be able to break it
[1:20:31] down to keep you from being confused
[1:20:33] about it I'm sorry that I take a long
[1:20:36] time
[1:20:36] and some of you get all hooked up and
[1:20:39] everything else because you don't like
[1:20:40] it cause I take a long time
[1:20:43] but you don't remember
[1:20:45] when I was taking a long time
[1:20:48] to try to help you
[1:20:52] is that plain enough
[1:20:57] why can't you battle with somebody else
[1:21:02] if you have eternal life you can bear
[1:21:04] with anybody
[1:21:07] do if you get what you well okay let's
[1:21:10] go
[1:21:11] let's read some of them all right
[1:21:14] brother Joe go ahead and put it up
[1:21:17] laughs
[1:21:21] look what he said
[1:21:23] haven't you heard this is from the Mason
[1:21:25] the Lamb's Book of Life 1956.
[1:21:29] haven't you heard many times that people
[1:21:31] say
[1:21:32] oh that was none perfect
[1:21:36] that's right
[1:21:39] oh wait a minute
[1:21:43] you just said that there's none perfect
[1:21:46] this is what he said
[1:21:48] you've heard people say many times that
[1:21:50] people say
[1:21:51] there's nothing perfect
[1:21:54] you want to race that out where's that
[1:21:56] that's right
[1:21:57] now
[1:21:58] because that's what he say that's right
[1:22:00] you can't be perfect in the side of your
[1:22:03] fellow man
[1:22:05] but you've got to be perfect or you'll
[1:22:08] never go to heaven
[1:22:10] that's right
[1:22:13] the Bible said Jesus speaking into
[1:22:14] beatitude Matthew said be therefore
[1:22:16] perfect even if your father in Heaven is
[1:22:18] perfect I'm gonna get back there while I
[1:22:19] realize and find out why I wrote that in
[1:22:21] Matthew 5
[1:22:23] 13-24 I'll read that later see when I
[1:22:25] wrote it down because that's what I had
[1:22:27] on my notes read
[1:22:30] all right
[1:22:32] then you've got to be just as perfect as
[1:22:34] God is
[1:22:35] are you lost now how are you going to do
[1:22:38] it
[1:22:40] see now one little mistake
[1:22:43] and you're lost
[1:22:49] one little flap of the eye
[1:22:52] and you're gone
[1:22:53] cause nothing
[1:22:55] can enter into have to to those places
[1:22:59] but perfect
[1:23:02] so you can't go to heaven unless you're
[1:23:04] perfect
[1:23:06] and we don't realize and establishes
[1:23:09] everybody never gets to have it's going
[1:23:10] to be perfect that's right
[1:23:15] oh the problem going to the next one the
[1:23:17] queen of sheep in 1958 I don't agree
[1:23:22] now this is doing what he's saying he's
[1:23:23] talking about unbelief
[1:23:25] is one of the most hideous things that
[1:23:27] can strike a person
[1:23:29] and there's only two faculties that can
[1:23:31] never can govern you that's either face
[1:23:34] or unbelief
[1:23:36] you cannot be halfway between there's no
[1:23:39] black white birds
[1:23:41] or drunks over men Center Saints you're
[1:23:44] either a Believer or not a believer I'm
[1:23:48] the only sin that there is is unbelief
[1:23:49] that's right see now we're going to stop
[1:23:51] okay
[1:23:53] you're a believer in unbeliever
[1:23:55] I might there's a lot of people in the
[1:23:57] world it's between those two
[1:23:59] right
[1:24:02] they're not a Believer enough to be born
[1:24:04] again
[1:24:06] but they're religious enough to not be a
[1:24:09] sinner
[1:24:11] right
[1:24:15] right I want to listen that's why I see
[1:24:17] these things need to be explained to
[1:24:18] your mind that's right right
[1:24:22] because there isn't a lot of people that
[1:24:25] fits between being a Believer or not a
[1:24:28] Believer you said well brother damn I
[1:24:29] heard this message I believed it
[1:24:33] how much do it
[1:24:36] but don't you believe a whole lot more
[1:24:38] today yes amen
[1:24:40] yes
[1:24:41] you see then you say well then people
[1:24:44] are unbelievers you never heard me say
[1:24:45] this unbelievable you never heard me say
[1:24:47] people leave this church in an
[1:24:48] unbeliever right right are they left the
[1:24:50] word no that's for their decision to
[1:24:53] make it ain't mine that's right
[1:25:00] no you're an either believer or an
[1:25:02] unbeliever right
[1:25:05] now remember this is what God is looking
[1:25:07] at
[1:25:14] he makes no difference
[1:25:17] because he's looking at it as there is
[1:25:20] no white bird
[1:25:22] there is no drunk sober man that's right
[1:25:27] there is no
[1:25:28] believer that's an unbeliever
[1:25:35] so we're either Believers or unbelievers
[1:25:39] the only sin there isn't unbelief that's
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:44] you see what I'm talking about see you
[1:25:47] just say well brother so-and-so preach
[1:25:48] tonight it's really enjoy the more glad
[1:25:50] I just shouted young he read around on
[1:25:51] top of some of these things and you
[1:25:53] never heard a word to say it
[1:25:55] yeah
[1:25:56] tell me what he said I don't know but it
[1:25:59] was good
[1:26:04] all right

[1:26:13] like that
[1:26:14] now you are gay
[1:26:16] I said ain't a bit of Truth on the page
[1:26:19] but it's a pretty picture
[1:26:23] you want me to draw you a pretty pitch
[1:26:28] he didn't even think to look at it
[1:26:31] to see what it was saying right
[1:26:34] it was just beautiful to him you seen
[1:26:36] the one where the guy you know that we
[1:26:38] talked about where he got this Pillar of
[1:26:40] Fire up here and then you got everything
[1:26:41] jumped over here and this jumps over
[1:26:42] here and that jumps over there
[1:26:43] everybody's looking at her
[1:26:46] oh look at that it's wonderful ain't a
[1:26:49] bit of truth to it
[1:26:50] amen we get everybody just glories in
[1:26:54] the pictures
[1:26:57] come on folks right be sensible
[1:27:01] me you see their faith or unbelief
[1:27:06] you cannot be Highway between
[1:27:11] all right
[1:27:13] you can't be
[1:27:15] well I really don't know
[1:27:18] you know I really don't know a lot well
[1:27:20] that's okay
[1:27:22] if it's been revealed one time in your
[1:27:25] saved you're saying
[1:27:28] one little thing right because that way
[1:27:30] the most illiterate person
[1:27:34] and I love that right amen most
[1:27:37] illiterate person can receive the
[1:27:39] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:27:40] they don't even know what their names
[1:27:42] are
[1:27:45] but God could drop down in their heart
[1:27:47] and give them the new birth
[1:27:49] take that person through justification
[1:27:51] of baptism in my Holy Ghost right amen
[1:27:55] and give them the new birth
[1:28:02] look what he said leave that in that
[1:28:04] brother Joe just to me
[1:28:07] is that the same one I wonder if this
[1:28:09] quote the last one
[1:28:10] you might be ever so religious
[1:28:13] you can never tell a lie
[1:28:15] you might be such a church member
[1:28:19] did all the neighborhood would say
[1:28:21] that's a renowned person and still be a
[1:28:24] sinner in the Son of God you're not
[1:28:26] judged by that it's by your faith not
[1:28:30] judged by your life you see what he's
[1:28:31] saying it's your faith he didn't believe
[1:28:33] it none is condemned already
[1:28:36] wonderful people out there that go to
[1:28:39] church every day and love God
[1:28:41] and would do a whole lot more than we do
[1:28:43] for God
[1:28:48] now brother Dale you're telling me about
[1:28:50] I've explained it yes they can be
[1:28:53] foolish virgin right
[1:28:54] but as far as right now they're lost
[1:28:57] now that's what you don't like
[1:29:01] because you don't like for me to say
[1:29:03] that like one brother told one time he
[1:29:05] said brother Dale said I didn't have the
[1:29:06] Holy Ghost I didn't say didn't I
[1:29:09] never did that come out of my mind
[1:29:11] I said the way you act
[1:29:13] shows you don't have it right
[1:29:18] he went away from your left his place
[1:29:20] said the brother Dale said I didn't have
[1:29:22] the Holy Ghost well if he'd had it he
[1:29:23] wouldn't have left
[1:29:24] right you'd say well you didn't never
[1:29:26] did say no I'm just saying it
[1:29:30] you didn't have to Holy Ghost he'd still
[1:29:31] be here because he'd know what I said
[1:29:33] was right right
[1:29:35] if you got the Holy Ghost today these
[1:29:37] quotes won't make you get upset
[1:29:44] you'll say Amen to what the Bible and
[1:29:46] the prophet had to say about it
[1:29:48] amen it won't change it that way look at
[1:29:51] the next one debate on tongues
[1:29:56] there's no
[1:29:57] black white bird no drunks over man
[1:30:01] did you see the right where's wrong
[1:30:04] I really disappointed carefully
[1:30:06] it it you can't have error and Truth
[1:30:10] together
[1:30:13] now let that soak in a minute
[1:30:15] you can't have error or truth together
[1:30:19] it's either truth
[1:30:21] or it's era
[1:30:24] when I wrote it down I don't know do you
[1:30:26] play it you think you know everything
[1:30:30] no
[1:30:32] but what I know as far as I understand
[1:30:35] is true
[1:30:39] did you see what I said what I know
[1:30:42] is true right amen
[1:30:45] so it's not neither it's whether you got
[1:30:48] it or not because people want people
[1:30:50] don't know the mansion
[1:30:51] you can't ever ever you see the truth do
[1:30:55] you believe that don't you brother and
[1:30:56] certainly if the spirit is Right a
[1:30:58] scripture is right then let's stay with
[1:31:01] the scripture
[1:31:02] you're going to understand after church
[1:31:04] you're trying to stay with the church
[1:31:05] you know
[1:31:07] bye what do you see what he's saying
[1:31:11] how can you be born again
[1:31:13] by somebody preaching era
[1:31:19] now come on I know God can winking
[1:31:21] ignorance and do what he wants to say
[1:31:22] right we know that
[1:31:26] but it's all in him look at the next one
[1:31:29] ten verges which is 144 000.
[1:31:32] 1960 12 11.
[1:31:36] and remember we're going to deal on that
[1:31:39] shark limb this morning
[1:31:41] you're either in that body or out of
[1:31:43] that body
[1:31:46] there's no pretty good Christian that's
[1:31:49] right and and dire you're either
[1:31:53] Christian or you're not Christian

[1:31:57] over man you can't have it you're either
[1:32:00] a Christian or not a Christian you're
[1:32:02] either in Christ or out of Christ
[1:32:07] I'm not de-christianizing anybody is
[1:32:10] that what you think
[1:32:13] he's not gonna be christianizing people
[1:32:16] all right
[1:32:20] why can't you read what he says to say
[1:32:25] what he said on that one you know
[1:32:28] where are we then
[1:32:30] like I said this morning oh yes I've
[1:32:32] never heard of anybody that said right
[1:32:34] around was wrong on marriage and divorce
[1:32:35] yeah yeah I'm talking about when he gave
[1:32:37] the grace
[1:32:39] you ever heard anybody just walk up
[1:32:41] since he was wrong right there nope boy
[1:32:44] they want to believe that
[1:32:47] yeah it didn't say he was wrong on the
[1:32:48] other look at the next one
[1:32:52] 6-03-63 323
[1:32:56] and you remember the whole thing is
[1:32:58] based on two things
[1:33:00] one is and one and Antichrist
[1:33:04] the other one crashed
[1:33:07] so now we're sitting here today we're
[1:33:09] either Christ by the new birth or
[1:33:11] Antichrist
[1:33:14] I'm blessed God I'm not an antichrist
[1:33:16] well that's what your Prophet had to say
[1:33:18] so argue with him
[1:33:22] well he didn't mean it that way I just
[1:33:25] read it
[1:33:27] it's still the same thing okay there is
[1:33:31] no Highway Christian there's no drugs
[1:33:32] over none man no black white bird no no
[1:33:34] no Senator Saints no you're either a
[1:33:37] sinner or a saint see there's just no in
[1:33:41] between
[1:33:42] you're either born again or you're not
[1:33:44] born again you're ready to filled with
[1:33:46] the Holy Spirit are you not filled with
[1:33:48] the Holy Spirit no matter how many
[1:33:50] Sensations you had if you ain't filled
[1:33:52] with the Holy Spirit you're not filled
[1:33:54] with it see and if you had been filled
[1:33:58] with it
[1:33:59] your life shows it
[1:34:01] goes right up to it see nobody has to
[1:34:04] tell anybody about it they see it amen
[1:34:06] no just
[1:34:08] gorgeous
[1:34:12] look at the nature
[1:34:13] go away Jesus 63 1103.
[1:34:20] but when we're condemned with unbelief
[1:34:24] sin of any type
[1:34:26] sin is unbelief
[1:34:29] there's only two types
[1:34:30] two things that every person in the
[1:34:32] world is living by
[1:34:35] did you hear that one every person in
[1:34:38] the world is living by one of these two
[1:34:42] maybe it's either Faith or unbelief
[1:34:45] there is no hide way between there are
[1:34:48] no drug trouble man tonight there's no
[1:34:49] black white birds tonight and there's no
[1:34:51] sooner saying he's either born again or
[1:34:54] not born again where you believe and we
[1:34:57] don't believe
[1:34:59] right
[1:35:00] amen amen bless God you think you know
[1:35:03] everything you think is not it I'm just
[1:35:06] saying that where I'm standing in the
[1:35:07] Lord that's perfect
[1:35:09] that's all I'm saying
[1:35:13] I'm saying the new birth makes you
[1:35:14] perfect amen
[1:35:18] because you're not a sinner
[1:35:21] if you are what are you well you mean
[1:35:23] every day
[1:35:26] all right
[1:35:29] did you say it or say he disbelieved
[1:35:30] God's word
[1:35:36] a lot got to be said about Sin man
[1:35:41] Jesus said
[1:35:43] show me one thing that I didn't fulfill
[1:35:45] the word
[1:35:47] you want me to find them we brought
[1:35:49] around
[1:35:51] he said show me where I ever missed the
[1:35:53] word
[1:35:54] all right
[1:35:56] what was he talking about seeing then
[1:35:58] natural life and things we do every day
[1:36:01] because in God's eyes that's sin
[1:36:04] because my Bible says anything's not a
[1:36:06] faith it's sin right
[1:36:10] whether it be eating too much or
[1:36:12] whatever
[1:36:14] all right spiritual amnesia
[1:36:18] 1964 411.
[1:36:21] you must be identified
[1:36:24] somewhere you must show
[1:36:26] your live shows tonight where you're
[1:36:28] identified you're identified either in
[1:36:31] Christ or out of Christ right you are
[1:36:33] not high not halfway there is no such
[1:36:36] thing as a drunk sober man there's no
[1:36:37] black white bird you're either saved or
[1:36:40] you're not saved
[1:36:42] you're either a saint or a sinner one or
[1:36:45] the other and your spiritual attitude
[1:36:48] towards God's word identifies you
[1:36:51] exactly where you're standing
[1:36:57] what is it
[1:36:59] look at the next one
[1:37:01] I normally read a lot today but I want
[1:37:03] you to see these things right around and
[1:37:05] said
[1:37:07] you people don't want to hear these
[1:37:08] things
[1:37:11] now watch it
[1:37:14] be therefore perfect there's one
[1:37:16] scripture
[1:37:17] and wrote around and said they were
[1:37:19] perfect back there
[1:37:21] and the other day remember I was
[1:37:23] bringing out the scripture where we
[1:37:24] think that we got well I got you trapped
[1:37:26] number of them because the Bible says
[1:37:29] that the worshiper was not made perfect
[1:37:33] you remember that one
[1:37:36] I brought around and puts them both
[1:37:38] together
[1:37:42] come on
[1:37:44] no sacrifices which are offered year by
[1:37:46] year never made to Comer unto perfect
[1:37:52] now he's using that scripture
[1:37:54] then he turned around and he says Jesus
[1:37:57] in Matthew Saint Matthew's gospel said
[1:37:59] be there for perfect evening your father
[1:38:01] in Heaven is prayer how are you going to
[1:38:03] do it how can you do it how can you be
[1:38:05] perfect as god is perfect
[1:38:07] be as perfect as God is prayer
[1:38:10] but that was a commission
[1:38:12] or a commandment made
[1:38:15] a commandment by Jesus Christ to be as
[1:38:18] perfect as God is in heaven Mercy do you
[1:38:22] say
[1:38:24] looking beside
[1:38:27] listen to it hold it just a minute
[1:38:30] let's find out how that Perfection is
[1:38:33] made
[1:38:36] now God back there in the beginning when
[1:38:38] he forced all down through this streak
[1:38:40] of time
[1:38:42] and he knew they would have to have a
[1:38:44] remedy to save those which were designed
[1:38:47] to be saved
[1:38:49] those who hungered to be up there in
[1:38:53] that realm he had to make a way
[1:38:55] to redeemed those people back again
[1:38:59] and we read one this morning where he
[1:39:01] made the way to his own blood right
[1:39:06] I think this is the one yeah the next
[1:39:08] one is one that gay this morning on
[1:39:10] perfection
[1:39:15] come on up with the next one
[1:39:19] it's the same one we gave this morning
[1:39:21] but anyways
[1:39:23] he predestined the name of the church to
[1:39:25] me give me under without a spider rim
[1:39:26] and if a garage required a church
[1:39:28] without smarter wrinkle he had to have
[1:39:30] something to make it that way he could
[1:39:32] not require his Justice his judgment
[1:39:34] could not let him ask such a thing
[1:39:38] if there wasn't a way to make it
[1:39:43] he made it to his blood
[1:39:49] how did he make it that day on Calvary
[1:39:52] it's in 1969-25
[1:39:57] hungry he made a way
[1:40:00] he gave us the spirit the holy spirit
[1:40:02] that sent it back to the Earth for you
[1:40:04] and I to live by that's what Calvary
[1:40:07] means to us to follow him
[1:40:10] and we're going down looking at the
[1:40:12] lives
[1:40:13] you either accepted or rejected
[1:40:16] therefore there is no sin Shackled
[1:40:18] hanging on us at all
[1:40:21] God just like we had never seen
[1:40:27] what about the psalmist David
[1:40:31] that would say under the blood of bulls
[1:40:33] and ghosts right blessed is a man to
[1:40:36] whom God will not impute sin
[1:40:39] think about that not scripture
[1:40:43] you know if he said it must be somebody
[1:40:45] that's right
[1:40:46] you sure was a bad egg now with me an
[1:40:50] adulteress a murderer or what all kind
[1:40:51] of things you could say about it
[1:40:54] it's an iPhone but he was once said
[1:40:58] because he was standing under the
[1:41:00] atonement
[1:41:03] there's no shackles or nothing the
[1:41:06] perfect sacrifice made us perfect
[1:41:08] for Jesus said be therefore perfect even
[1:41:10] as your father in Heaven is perfect then
[1:41:12] there is no more to be done
[1:41:16] but we're made perfect in the presence
[1:41:18] of God
[1:41:20] what do I do
[1:41:21] go down to the next in the last book of
[1:41:24] life
[1:41:32] now you got to be perfect you said being
[1:41:34] there for perfect even as your father
[1:41:36] name and it's perfect now how are you
[1:41:38] going to be when you're continually
[1:41:40] sinning
[1:41:41] when you're continually doing what's
[1:41:43] wrong
[1:41:45] oh you wouldn't denying
[1:41:48] our problems of doing things he said how
[1:41:51] are you going to do it when we're doing
[1:41:52] it
[1:41:54] now this will kind of put a little kink
[1:41:56] in the legalism but notice it isn't what
[1:41:58] you do
[1:42:00] if what God has done
[1:42:03] it's not what you do it's what he done
[1:42:05] see you can't be perfect
[1:42:09] you can't be in yourself but in Christ
[1:42:11] you are perfected you're not trusting in
[1:42:14] your own good works right or your own
[1:42:16] church you belong to but you're crushing
[1:42:18] into shed blood of the Lord Jesus
[1:42:21] there you are that's what makes you
[1:42:23] perfect that's what anchors you in faith
[1:42:27] being in Jesus Christ
[1:42:30] bypass the next one number 12 God is
[1:42:32] just a token and the worshiper
[1:42:34] underneath the sacrifices the token that
[1:42:37] you know and that's what it's believed
[1:42:38] but Iran says you can't not on this
[1:42:40] quote here but he said you can't impute
[1:42:42] sin over the token well it's my face
[1:42:44] happened I'm trying to hurry look at the
[1:42:46] next one which is 19 and number 13.
[1:42:49] law or Grace preach 1954.
[1:42:53] 1005.
[1:42:55] well I hope you see it it is whether
[1:42:57] you're going to be a Christian or not
[1:43:01] listen
[1:43:04] it's whether he was good enough
[1:43:09] it's whether he was good enough
[1:43:13] I love the way your your Prophet talks
[1:43:15] you know he talks about English just
[1:43:17] like we do right
[1:43:21] right if God accepted him and his blood
[1:43:24] makes an atonement God don't see you
[1:43:28] he sees the lamb he talked about the
[1:43:30] little me you know going out and dancing
[1:43:31] around
[1:43:33] I remember his mama told him he said God
[1:43:35] ain't looking at you you're looking at
[1:43:36] your sacrifice he's going to live but
[1:43:40] one person had to die for the imperfect
[1:43:43] that was me William Brown no good not
[1:43:47] fit to live where did it go to hell
[1:43:49] born and sinful family raised a sinner
[1:43:52] no good at all not one sound part about
[1:43:55] me
[1:43:57] that's right but one day I accepted
[1:44:00] Hallelujah when God looked down on
[1:44:02] Christ and Christ took my place then God
[1:44:05] don't see me he said the perfect one
[1:44:07] then as long as I'm in here in him
[1:44:11] that I am perfected not in myself in him
[1:44:14] not my perfection I don't have any you
[1:44:18] don't have any it's it but it's his
[1:44:20] Perfection right amen I'm looking at me
[1:44:23] looking at him let's get the last one
[1:44:26] like in the infallible word of God 56
[1:44:30] 406.
[1:44:35] and you can't be perfect
[1:44:38] but as long as you're in Christ
[1:44:41] you're perfected by his vicarious
[1:44:44] suffering and death of the cross
[1:44:47] God doesn't see your sins he sees
[1:44:50] nothing but one perfect person the body
[1:44:53] of Jesus Christ he came that's the
[1:44:56] reason they love the hard prophet
[1:44:58] thought surely God would curse Israel
[1:45:01] but look at the things they had done
[1:45:03] wrong
[1:45:06] but he failed to see the smitten Rock
[1:45:09] in the right serpent going before him
[1:45:11] make an atonement God couldn't see
[1:45:14] through the atonement his blood the
[1:45:16] answer is flesh
[1:45:19] what do you think about it
[1:45:25] are you perfect
[1:45:27] or just forgiven
[1:45:35] God says we're perfect that's right
[1:45:39] by the new birth
[1:45:42] the prophet says in other words just
[1:45:45] paraphrase it even with the new birth
[1:45:49] you and I every day do wrong
[1:45:54] and remember this morning when I was
[1:45:55] trying to explain about job
[1:45:59] knew he'd done what God told him to do
[1:46:01] but he didn't see Christ
[1:46:04] right
[1:46:06] so when is whenever you came to him and
[1:46:08] condemned him for being self-righteous
[1:46:15] he ain't condemning for the fact that he
[1:46:17] was saying what was right he condemned
[1:46:19] me for being self-righteous because he
[1:46:21] thought he could do it and had done it
[1:46:25] in himself right
[1:46:27] isn't that self-righteousness
[1:46:31] but when he seen Jesus
[1:46:33] Glory
[1:46:35] when he seen the Redeemer you realize
[1:46:38] what a sinner he was
[1:46:41] I've tried my best to explain Paul
[1:46:44] oh man
[1:46:47] imagine I thought what was I thought
[1:46:49] this was life
[1:46:51] he said I found it to be death that's
[1:46:54] right
[1:46:56] what was he talking about keeping the
[1:46:58] law to the perfect letter
[1:47:01] a Pharisee the Pharisee a Hebrew the
[1:47:04] Hebrews
[1:47:07] blameless he said
[1:47:09] read it
[1:47:12] concerning the law blameless
[1:47:15] but he said what I thought was life I
[1:47:17] found to be dead
[1:47:21] see he couldn't see Jesus right
[1:47:24] that's right
[1:47:26] come on don't you see what I'm talking
[1:47:27] about Doreen I keep bringing it up he
[1:47:29] was like job
[1:47:32] he was like Joe
[1:47:34] he couldn't see the retainer because he
[1:47:38] didn't think he needed me
[1:47:40] run around the birthday and said it was
[1:47:41] hard to get those Pharisees to realize
[1:47:43] they're Sinners where he could die for
[1:47:45] them
[1:47:46] amen
[1:47:48] what about it
[1:47:52] Paul walking in a perfect state
[1:47:57] could not be condemned by the law
[1:48:02] perfect blindness
[1:48:06] but one day he said I thought this was
[1:48:08] life
[1:48:09] he said I now see it's death
[1:48:14] I don't want to be found in him
[1:48:16] not having my own righteousness but the
[1:48:19] righteousness as he said that comes by
[1:48:21] faith
[1:48:24] that's right see when he seen Jesus he
[1:48:27] realized what it was to be a sinner
[1:48:29] and he made a statement that's
[1:48:31] outstanding
[1:48:33] brother Connie condemned me years ago
[1:48:34] for saving it
[1:48:38] I said I'm the chiefest of Sinners he
[1:48:40] said brother Dale ain't never been out
[1:48:41] there to live like we did in the world I
[1:48:43] sit down here
[1:48:45] brother Dave was walking close
[1:48:48] there's the guy that could say he's the
[1:48:49] chiefest right
[1:48:51] when you're walking very close and alive
[1:48:54] until I received this new birth until I
[1:48:57] seen Christ
[1:49:00] I thought I had it
[1:49:06] or you listening yes
[1:49:09] I thought I had it
[1:49:12] I thought my life proved ahead
[1:49:16] I didn't drink I didn't smoke I didn't
[1:49:18] curse I didn't do anything
[1:49:24] concerning the Bible blameless
[1:49:26] right you can say oh you're putting your
[1:49:28] own horn and I'll just telling the truth
[1:49:34] respected looked up to my people because
[1:49:36] 23 years old I was an ordained Deacon in
[1:49:39] a matter that never puts a deacon into a
[1:49:42] 40.
[1:49:44] but they don't want them young Hot Heads
[1:49:45] in there
[1:49:51] teaching their adult Sunday school class
[1:49:54] the deacons and the elders and their
[1:49:55] wives
[1:50:00] let's see one day
[1:50:03] I like Paul yeah it's all that what I
[1:50:07] thought was life
[1:50:11] going to church being good paying my
[1:50:14] time and we never got up on Sunday or we
[1:50:17] going to church well the kids got a
[1:50:20] sniffly no
[1:50:22] let's all stay home happy boy
[1:50:29] you know what I'm telling you God's
[1:50:31] honest truth
[1:50:35] money
[1:50:36] how do you feel today well I still feel
[1:50:37] like going
[1:50:39] well let's just don't go
[1:50:43] I had more than that and I was in the
[1:50:46] Baptist Church now you can condemn me
[1:50:47] you can scream and holler at me and say
[1:50:49] brother Dale's hateful old guy you just
[1:50:52] don't understand my problems
[1:50:55] this order's made for praying for the
[1:50:57] sick your home is not made for praying
[1:51:00] for the sick
[1:51:01] do you understand that statement yes I
[1:51:05] never read in the Bible call the Elders
[1:51:07] to come to your home
[1:51:12] that's fine if your chicken can't come
[1:51:17] but you know yourself this man's been
[1:51:19] here for years and you've seen me
[1:51:21] through many sicknesses and many my
[1:51:23] trials and trouble but it's never been a
[1:51:25] day that I didn't come to church
[1:51:29] well you just went as sick as I am
[1:51:36] I told you years ago
[1:51:40] still stand on
[1:51:42] it the reason a lot of people are never
[1:51:43] healed they don't want to be healed
[1:51:46] they'd rather be sick where they can go
[1:51:48] out
[1:51:49] there
[1:51:52] I'm not going around jumping like this
[1:51:54] my knees killing me my back hurting I
[1:51:57] need to send praise the Lord how you
[1:51:58] doing I'm doing wonderful foreign
[1:52:05] the people out there might not
[1:52:07] understand that but you know it's true
[1:52:09] there's ever been a time I missed
[1:52:11] Services because of being sick
[1:52:14] church is where you're supposed to be
[1:52:16] when you're sick
[1:52:18] right now you come up here with some
[1:52:20] quarantined disease will put you
[1:52:21] downstairs
[1:52:23] but we'll give you
[1:52:24] if you can watch your services
[1:52:26] but I wouldn't care if you come shut the
[1:52:28] side of me
[1:52:30] all right amen I wouldn't care if you
[1:52:32] come here and stood on the platform with
[1:52:34] me with a deadless disease it could be I
[1:52:36] wouldn't be afraid
[1:52:38] that's right right you're a dummy I
[1:52:40] agree with you
[1:52:41] but I wouldn't be afraid okay
[1:52:46] yeah that's where you say brother they
[1:52:47] don't know
[1:52:50] I've been in them places and you've seen
[1:52:51] me walk out of them
[1:52:57] listen to church
[1:53:00] I can say like Paul
[1:53:01] fun the thing I thought was life
[1:53:05] going to church being good paying my
[1:53:07] time working myself to death
[1:53:13] I thought that would laugh
[1:53:17] because you see
[1:53:19] I could quote Paul
[1:53:21] and say poor old Paul he just didn't
[1:53:23] know that he needed to be born again all
[1:53:26] he had to do was believe
[1:53:28] I believe and he didn't
[1:53:31] Oh Heaven help you
[1:53:35] but you see I seen one day what I was
[1:53:38] doing was death
[1:53:40] and I started crying out to God for life
[1:53:45] but how many of you have ever thought of
[1:53:47] it even in that form
[1:53:49] that where you come from was death
[1:53:52] that's right
[1:53:56] so then I have to explain
[1:53:58] those are wonderful people
[1:54:01] those were good people
[1:54:03] thank God for them
[1:54:05] and Annette Brown never condemned them
[1:54:07] he said there's a place for him
[1:54:10] but that's not for you and me
[1:54:13] the law was fine for the other people
[1:54:16] but Paul said it on it for me
[1:54:19] he said now I take my ways
[1:54:23] five times and all the stripes in the
[1:54:25] deep and all these other things can't
[1:54:27] you look back at him and see the old Old
[1:54:29] Testament prophets and what they went
[1:54:30] through
[1:54:33] the only to speak of what was in their
[1:54:35] life
[1:54:36] with Paul trying to get the people to
[1:54:37] see Jesus
[1:54:43] he said
[1:54:44] they said oh even God warned Paul
[1:54:46] through the holy spirit said don't go
[1:54:48] right he said because they'll kill you
[1:54:51] read your Bible in the book of Acts
[1:54:54] Paul was warned by the Holy Spirit not
[1:54:56] to go he said I'm not only we'll let you
[1:54:58] go I'll go it
[1:55:00] I'm going to roll
[1:55:04] to give our life
[1:55:07] the man like Peter said
[1:55:10] don't hate me the way they did my master
[1:55:12] hang me upside down
[1:55:17] why because he had a more sure word
[1:55:20] that's right thank you I said Peter
[1:55:23] there he said I have more sure word I
[1:55:25] saw Jesus on the mountain I saw all
[1:55:27] these things when I got a more sure word
[1:55:29] of Prophecy that's right I've got the
[1:55:31] new birth now
[1:55:34] can't you see it
[1:55:39] you see why I love it
[1:55:44] I don't but I saw it was right
[1:55:47] till I come in this message
[1:55:50] and I've seen I didn't have
[1:55:52] what the Bible said
[1:55:55] what everybody else is I come in this
[1:55:57] magic to prove I got the Holy Ghost
[1:55:58] going to come to the message
[1:56:02] I'm sorry maybe I'm the only one in the
[1:56:05] world that's messed up like it would
[1:56:07] I don't mean that sarcastically I mean
[1:56:09] this is true
[1:56:11] but thank God he got a hold of
[1:56:15] it thank God he was able to contact me
[1:56:19] to tell me he said you wasn't born again
[1:56:22] all right
[1:56:23] I told you I saw God when I was 11 years
[1:56:26] old but that didn't mean I'd want it
[1:56:27] again
[1:56:30] I've seen things in my life that would
[1:56:32] that most people would put on there to
[1:56:34] say you had to have a new birth but I
[1:56:36] never claimed it
[1:56:42] you see that's why I'm trying to preach
[1:56:44] to you what the new birth is
[1:56:48] it's not your shot who's speaking in
[1:56:50] tongues all of that comes after babies
[1:56:52] born yep right
[1:56:55] it's not the baby
[1:56:57] the baby got to be born for a cries
[1:57:01] we agree with all of those things we
[1:57:03] believe in all of the gifts
[1:57:05] I encourage you to use your guilt that
[1:57:07] you have within you and you'll answer to
[1:57:10] God for not using your guilt
[1:57:13] see I'll have to answer for not allowing
[1:57:15] you to use them and no one year has ever
[1:57:16] done it one man here started doing
[1:57:18] something one time and some of them guys
[1:57:20] said something about it I said they
[1:57:22] ain't doing nothing but speaking in
[1:57:23] Spanish
[1:57:24] and I never knew a word of Spanish
[1:57:27] you got mad at me
[1:57:30] but you know what it proved later that's
[1:57:31] right
[1:57:39] what about a jerk
[1:57:41] you're either a Christian or you're lost
[1:57:45] you're either saved or you're lost
[1:57:47] you're either born again or you lost
[1:57:50] there is no gray area
[1:57:53] well brother Dale I just come in today
[1:57:54] and heard it what can I do thank God and
[1:57:57] get justified by everything and then
[1:58:00] leave on sanctification right and then
[1:58:02] come to the baptism when the Holy Ghost
[1:58:08] deep because that's what you need to do
[1:58:12] I got an extra stand together we'll just
[1:58:14] go right on the end of the community I'm
[1:58:16] sorry
[1:58:19] for being a little late
[1:58:25] maybe one of these days I'll learn to
[1:58:27] preach slower advice or something and
[1:58:30] quit you know
[1:58:31] something anyway but
[1:58:33] I just want you to see
[1:58:36] what the New Birth really is
[1:58:39] and you must be born again
[1:58:42] and just believing is not enough
[1:58:48] even sanctification is not enough
[1:58:52] the new bird
[1:58:55] when we went to so-and-so and and the
[1:58:58] more they when they were praying for
[1:59:00] somebody to receive the Holy Ghost they
[1:59:01] just shouting all over the place well
[1:59:02] why wouldn't you shouting this morning
[1:59:04] while I was praying for the brother
[1:59:06] you want to condemn me what's the matter
[1:59:09] you know like it that way do you
[1:59:12] if the people were shouting all over the
[1:59:14] church or people were shopping all over
[1:59:15] the church
[1:59:16] I've been in many places where people
[1:59:18] were shouting all over the church and I
[1:59:19] pray the same prayer and I pray right
[1:59:20] here
[1:59:23] and that's starting to feel that person
[1:59:25] with a bad kid while ago
[1:59:30] you don't have to you don't have to beat
[1:59:32] people over the head and Hammer them
[1:59:34] around for another season anyway
[1:59:36] just tell them it's for her all they got
[1:59:39] to do is accept it that's right may take
[1:59:41] a while to accept it brother Dale do you
[1:59:43] mean you encourage people to no I didn't
[1:59:45] I don't encourage you to wait two years
[1:59:47] to get the Holy Ghost I ain't never said
[1:59:48] that I said that is me because I'm kind
[1:59:50] of slow
[1:59:54] but I'll tell you one thing
[1:59:57] according to the Bible and according to
[1:59:59] the prophet
[2:00:00] we're either Christians or we're lost
[2:00:04] we're either saved or lost
[2:00:07] we're either born again or not born
[2:00:09] again
[2:00:10] we're either perfect
[2:00:12] or we're not perfect
[2:00:17] I just got through reading all of the
[2:00:19] quotes the prophet didn't say
[2:00:22] surely he knew what the new birth was
[2:00:24] surely he knew the situation of mankind
[2:00:29] what do we think about
[2:00:32] well I know somebody who's a real good
[2:00:34] Christian but they don't believe it's
[2:00:35] naked
[2:00:38] I just can't do telling you it's
[2:00:39] wonderful people Lori Hallelujah thank
[2:00:42] God for him
[2:00:46] but if they don't believe this message
[2:00:47] you know there's something wrong that's
[2:00:48] right that's right because the Holy
[2:00:50] Ghost I believe this last year right
[2:00:52] absolutely
[2:00:54] I don't you tell me president you
[2:00:56] believe everything right around said I
[2:00:57] believe all that I know he said
[2:01:01] but I ain't heard everything he said
[2:01:04] and you know what if one of these days I
[2:01:06] find something that the spirit in me
[2:01:07] don't agree with what he said you know
[2:01:09] what I'm gonna come out here and tell
[2:01:10] you
[2:01:12] I don't believe this that's what means
[2:01:14] I've been lost all this time
[2:01:16] right I have no problems with saying
[2:01:19] that
[2:01:22] but if he agrees with his word
[2:01:25] I have no problems I'm telling you
[2:01:27] that's why I believe that's right
[2:01:30] because that way you heard me say it how
[2:01:33] do you check if people is Doctrine by my
[2:01:36] new birth
[2:01:37] who are you for me
[2:01:40] okay you want to do I check it to see
[2:01:43] whether it's according to my newborn
[2:01:46] and you know
[2:01:49] it must have done pretty good because my
[2:01:52] batting average is pretty good about all
[2:01:55] these Doctrine just went around the
[2:01:56] message that's right that's not bragging
[2:01:59] that's facts
[2:02:02] don't have to brag if you stand on
[2:02:04] something like I've always said now
[2:02:05] we've got in trouble trying to explain
[2:02:06] it but I said when you got an old nag of
[2:02:10] a horse you have to brag on it
[2:02:12] if you've got a good one you don't have
[2:02:13] to and I always saying about my wife I
[2:02:15] said I got a wonderful wife
[2:02:18] I don't have to brag on her
[2:02:21] debruce what she
[2:02:24] never was calling her a horse
[2:02:29] telling the truth about it
[2:02:36] that's the problem if you don't
[2:02:37] understand me I guess mine shouldn't
[2:02:39] talk like that
[2:02:40] let's get into the community Paul said
[2:02:42] for I have received of the Lord that
[2:02:43] which also I delivered unto you that the
[2:02:45] Lord Jesus the same night in which he
[2:02:47] was betrayed took bread and when he had
[2:02:49] given thanks he break it and said take
[2:02:51] eat this is my body which is broken for
[2:02:53] you this doing remembrance of me after
[2:02:55] the same manner also he took the cup
[2:02:57] when he had something this cup is the
[2:02:59] New Testament in my blood let's do ye as
[2:03:02] often as you drink it in remembrance of
[2:03:04] me for as often as you eat this bread
[2:03:06] and drink this cup you do shoes the
[2:03:08] Lord's death till I come wherefore
[2:03:10] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[2:03:12] this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be
[2:03:14] guilty of the body and blood of the Lord
[2:03:16] but let a man examine himself and shall
[2:03:19] leading me to that bread and drink of
[2:03:20] that cup or he that eat it and drinketh
[2:03:22] unworthily eateth and drink a damnation
[2:03:24] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:03:26] body for this cause many are weak and
[2:03:28] sickness among you in many sleep where
[2:03:31] we would judge for if we would judge
[2:03:33] ourselves we should not be judged
[2:03:36] but when we are judged we are chastened
[2:03:38] of the Lord that we should not be
[2:03:40] condemned with the world we're for my
[2:03:42] brethren when you come together to eat
[2:03:44] Terry one for another and if any man
[2:03:46] hunger let him eat at home
[2:03:48] that you come out to come not together
[2:03:50] in the condemnation and the wrestle I
[2:03:52] said in order
[2:03:53] I'm not good let's just have a few
[2:03:56] moments of Silent prayer to pray one for
[2:03:58] another the Lord would be with each and
[2:03:59] every one of us you pray for me I pray
[2:04:01] for you all right

[2:04:24] one of us forgive us of our sins make us
[2:04:26] worthy to be Protectors of these things
[2:04:29] and if we ask it in Jesus name
[2:04:34] the Bible said he took bread and blessed
[2:04:36] it
[2:04:37] father we thank you for this bread has
[2:04:38] been made for this purpose today here we
[2:04:41] come to the time of being able to be to
[2:04:43] be partakers
[2:04:44] we ask you that you would sanctify it
[2:04:46] represents thy body which was given for
[2:04:49] each and every one of us it represents
[2:04:51] Thy word Lord all the things and we know

[2:05:18] a little round wafer to keep over
[2:05:21] hang on to it try to act like we're
[2:05:24] religious
[2:05:26] didn't have a lot of good meaning to it
[2:05:28] a lot of good things to take place by
[2:05:31] taking the communion
[2:05:34] if we just believe it
[2:05:37] thank the Lord for it
[2:05:45] that's where I like to break it
[2:05:50] didn't say no way for it or nothing
[2:05:55] that's all you believed and go ahead

[2:06:03] the word
[2:06:04] they took it and they ate the bread
[2:06:08] they drank the wine
[2:06:10] but see then we become so righteous
[2:06:13] that we
[2:06:15] wouldn't take wine
[2:06:18] you mean y'all take wine up there
[2:06:23] make it mistake
[2:06:26] we don't run by I don't agree with that
[2:06:28] that's right
[2:06:30] we get to where we can't do it and have
[2:06:31] to buy it I'll just we just won't have
[2:06:32] it that time we will get something
[2:06:35] because I don't want no attitude foot to
[2:06:37] it or nothing
[2:06:38] father we thank you for this wine just
[2:06:40] went through the process now Lord
[2:06:42] it's better every day

[2:06:46] was shed for each and every one of us we
[2:06:48] love you and we thank you we ask you to
[2:06:49] sanctify the wine sanctify the bread and
[2:06:52] the partakers that we may be together as
[2:06:54] one in you in Jesus name

[2:14:19] first thing I'm doing we got here real
[2:14:20] early
[2:14:21] and I wanted it deliberately turned I
[2:14:24] turned the tape on and I came up here
[2:14:26] and I asked God
[2:14:28] forgive us
[2:14:29] because of having to do what we've done
[2:14:32] but yet to sanctify the building amen
[2:14:35] the prophet of God said one child
[2:14:36] running through the building
[2:14:38] would disrupt the next service
[2:14:43] you want that quote the next service

[2:15:36] them now you may think that your little
[2:15:38] angels are little angels you won't do
[2:15:40] nothing
[2:15:42] I never did think that
[2:15:44] I always told you that my kids my
[2:15:48] grandkids and my great grandkids her
[2:15:51] Halo is held up by horns
[2:15:54] meaning they're human

[2:16:04] adults getting upset
[2:16:07] and can ruin everything in the building

[2:16:17] Spirit that's right that's right that's
[2:16:20] right what if it's you that's grieving
[2:16:23] the Holy Spirit
[2:16:26] in the Bible they call that out

[2:16:34] out
[2:16:36] thank you
[2:16:38] you start let's just be Christians
[2:16:42] you don't like what's going on just go
[2:16:44] to sleep while it's going on
[2:16:46] you know
[2:16:48] and they do respectable either but
[2:16:51] you know what I'm saying
[2:16:54] let around see it if
[2:16:57] the brown Tabernacle voted
[2:17:00] Brother Brad a brother now would have
[2:17:01] preached Jehovah Witness Doctrine
[2:17:05] you know what he said
[2:17:07] he said I would say
[2:17:10] that that was the leadership of the Holy
[2:17:12] Spirit now that may be perforation that
[2:17:14] Mr it's very clever
[2:17:18] he said God if that's what they want
[2:17:23] God will let him have
[2:17:27] he never bragged on the Tabernacle my
[2:17:29] whole life
[2:17:30] he'd always say we got our troubles here
[2:17:34] it's like anywhere
[2:17:37] you know why because he was honest since
[2:17:38] you're sincere man right
[2:17:42] yeah that's right you're staying on
[2:17:43] these things all right let's read the
[2:17:45] scripture go into the footwork
[2:17:48] supper being the end of the devil having
[2:17:49] now put into the heart of Judah sister
[2:17:51] Simon's son to betray him Jesus knowing
[2:17:53] that the father had given all things
[2:17:55] into his hands and he was coming from
[2:17:56] God and went to God he rises on supper
[2:17:59] and laid aside his garments and took a
[2:18:00] towel and guarded himself after that he
[2:18:03] poured water into a basin to begin to
[2:18:04] Washington Southwest feet and wipe them
[2:18:06] with the towel were with he was dirty
[2:18:08] then cometh either Simon Peter and Peter
[2:18:10] said unto him Lord thus that I wash my
[2:18:12] feet Jesus answered and said unto them
[2:18:14] what I do what I do that I know it's not
[2:18:17] now but I shall know Hereafter
[2:18:21] leadership unto him Thou shalt never
[2:18:23] wash my feet Jesus answered him if I
[2:18:26] worse thee not thy is no part with me
[2:18:28] Simon Peterson to him Lord not my feet
[2:18:31] only but also my hands in my head Jesus
[2:18:34] said unto him he that is worse knee
[2:18:36] that's not saved to wash his feet but
[2:18:38] it's clean everywhere and you're clean
[2:18:40] but not all where he knew who should
[2:18:42] betray him therefore said he you're not
[2:18:44] all clean so after he had washed their
[2:18:46] feet and had taken his garments and was
[2:18:48] set down again he said unto them know
[2:18:51] you what happened unto you you call me
[2:18:52] master and Lord and you say well for so
[2:18:55] I am if I then your Lord and Master I
[2:18:57] washed your feet you also ought to wash
[2:18:59] one another's feet but I've given you an
[2:19:01] example that you should that ye should
[2:19:03] do as I have done to you
[2:19:05] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[2:19:08] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[2:19:10] that is sent greater than he that sent
[2:19:12] him if you know these things happy are
[2:19:14] you if you
[2:19:16] if you let's stand and be dismissed and
[2:19:18] ladies can go downstairs
[2:19:20] Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[2:19:22] day we pray Lord
[2:19:24] we've tried to get across the things to
[2:19:27] look at things in the right order
[2:19:29] and to see that your Prophet was right
[2:19:33] the Bible is right when it says we're
[2:19:35] either a Christian or we're lost
[2:19:37] there's no middle area but yet a lot of
[2:19:40] people Lord dwell in the middle area
[2:19:42] that are trying to be one thing and
[2:19:44] trying to be another but you don't look
[2:19:45] at them like that you look at them as
[2:19:48] the bases if they don't have the new
[2:19:49] birth they don't have it
[2:19:51] so then you just say that it's all lost
[2:19:53] without it
[2:19:54] and father those things are so clear but
[2:19:57] yet we can get our minds muddled up into
[2:19:59] trying to Define things
[2:20:02] until we see and find it being in the
[2:20:04] air in ourselves we love you and we
[2:20:06] thank you blessing as we go on into the
[2:20:08] foot worship and then be with the people
[2:20:10] on the way home give everybody a safe
[2:20:12] journey may your love be with each one
[2:20:14] of us in Jesus name amen amen you're
[2:20:17] dismissal
[2:20:19] thank you
