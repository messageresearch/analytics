[0:00] they
[0:01] are an impact on your
[0:04] life
[0:06] okay um like we were talking about in
[0:09] the Bible Study last
[0:11] night each of the
[0:14] dispensations had a word there was a
[0:16] word for every dispensation m u Martin
[0:19] Luther had a word Wesley had a word
[0:21] Pentecost had a
[0:23] word Paul had a word irus all they all
[0:26] had a word to
[0:27] bring and it was the word of God it
[0:29] didn't come from somewhere else it came
[0:31] from it came from God's own mind it was
[0:32] God's mind projected to the
[0:35] people but now in the end time we
[0:39] brought all that up from there to
[0:42] here with an understanding of the
[0:44] justification the sanctification the
[0:46] baptism of Holy Ghost what irenius went
[0:47] through what Paul went through all the
[0:49] all the faith of the fathers has been
[0:51] brought back and not only the faith of
[0:54] the fathers has been brought back but
[0:56] these three sons Nam has something
[0:58] definitely to do in your your life not
[1:01] that it was just the Son of God before
[1:03] the foundation of the world and the son
[1:05] of man was Jesus and the son of David's
[1:07] going to be in the Millennium yeah sure
[1:10] that's a dispensation that's but to the
[1:13] Bride of Jesus Christ if we don't get
[1:14] them all in order and know what they are
[1:18] to begin with
[1:22] then I always wondered how the Catholic
[1:26] church I'm trying to word this right I
[1:28] always wonder how the Catholic Church
[1:30] brought things in like that well what it
[1:34] does
[1:35] is the Son of
[1:38] God has characteristics right right the
[1:41] son of man has characteristics son of
[1:44] David had they have different
[1:46] characteristic same person but different
[1:48] characteristics right that's right all
[1:50] right now what the Catholic Church does
[1:52] is they take them and they twist them a
[1:54] little
[1:57] bit yeah then they may marry the mother
[2:00] God then they make this saint this and
[2:01] they make this saint that well now as we
[2:04] come over here on this side follow me
[2:05] now as we come over here on this side we
[2:07] know exactly
[2:09] why these saints were on the earth MH
[2:14] okay yeah there's no doubt
[2:15] Columba he was a saint of the Catholic
[2:18] church at one time but he was a church
[2:22] age messenger then you got all these
[2:24] Saints cilas and all these other people
[2:26] the Catholic Church there what I'm
[2:27] saying is the Catholic Church knows
[2:29] about dispensations they have to because
[2:31] there's a dispensation of this one and
[2:32] this one and this one and this one but
[2:34] what they're saying is is you got to
[2:35] pray to that person right okay yeah they
[2:39] they bypass going to the the son the
[2:41] real son the Son of God they put all
[2:44] these intercessors in
[2:46] between and the Bible says there's no
[2:48] intercessor but one and that's Christ
[2:50] Jesus right but what the Catholic church
[2:53] is they they say well we got this
[2:56] dispensation of of St Patrick or whoever
[2:58] you know well would you pray to him for
[3:01] whatever we were in Colorado one time
[3:03] and I had never I never dealt with a
[3:06] Catholic not a real true Catholic you
[3:09] know you you see these people says I'm
[3:10] Catholic and that's a good easy religion
[3:13] you know CU you can do what you want to
[3:14] and get by with it just go talk to the
[3:16] priest that's right but this lady was a
[3:19] devout Catholic I told somebody the
[3:21] story but she said do you mind if I pray
[3:23] for you before you leave cuz we stayed
[3:25] at her house and our little uh off
[3:28] building and we Hunted mu there on her
[3:30] property and and she said do you mind if
[3:33] I pray for you I said sure I don't care
[3:35] pray pray for your travel so she gets
[3:38] this book out she turns to the patron
[3:41] saint of travel which I can't remember
[3:43] his name but let's just say it's St
[3:47] Patrick she shows the picture of the guy
[3:50] standing there you know it's a
[3:51] caricature or a picture of them and then
[3:54] up underneath there's a prayer for
[3:57] travel so she reads that prayer to me
[3:59] you know so I I said can I see the book
[4:01] so I'm flipping through and I mean
[4:03] there's prayers for
[4:05] everything I mean there's prayers for
[4:07] when you're going through trouble you
[4:08] lose a there's a saint there that you
[4:11] pray to to make
[4:13] intercession you we she was praying she
[4:15] wasn't praying to God she's praying to
[4:16] that Saint in that book she was praying
[4:19] that prayer to that Saint that he will
[4:22] help us on our
[4:24] travel so there's the Catholic Church
[4:26] taking what I mean by the three sons
[4:28] names let's not get it to where it it's
[4:31] it's uh Catholicism yeah well today I'm
[4:33] going to pray to the Son of God because
[4:35] I need but tomorrow I need something in
[4:37] my flesh and I'm going to pray to the
[4:39] son of man and let's pray to the son of
[4:41] David when we pray for Israel no it's
[4:43] not that it's one God one intercessor
[4:47] Christ
[4:48] Jesus and leave it at that okay but we
[4:51] must understand these dispensations
[4:53] because the Son of God did have a work
[4:57] still does I don't say did still has a
[4:59] work cuz he these these these uh forms
[5:02] of God are Eternal that's right remember
[5:05] he gains no new attributes right right
[5:07] he just displays them I was reading uh
[5:10] yesterday brother brandham said he said
[5:12] now that kid there's 15 years old
[5:17] somebody in the audience he said now he
[5:19] has the potential to be a father that's
[5:22] right but he's not
[5:23] one he has the potential to be a
[5:26] grandfather but he's not one the
[5:28] manifestation of him
[5:30] not having a son yet so he can't be a
[5:32] father right but he can be a husband you
[5:35] understand he can be a husband he's a
[5:36] human he works he does all these things
[5:39] I I never heard brother Brown explain it
[5:41] like that but I can't it was may be in
[5:43] here but I'll look it up and read it to
[5:46] you because he was really bringing it
[5:47] out he said now he said I'm a
[5:49] grandfather right he said because I can
[5:52] show you my grandkids and the
[5:54] manifestation of me being the
[5:55] grandfather is I can show you my
[5:57] children watch the same way with God
[6:00] of course God's not a granddaddy but
[6:01] God's a father and for him to have a
[6:04] father for him to be a father he had to
[6:05] have children amen so we're the children
[6:08] of God so let's don't look to him and
[6:10] say well I want to pray that
[6:13] no the Holy Ghost the Father the Son all
[6:17] same person right it's the same one
[6:20] that's right God's our father right
[6:22] there's only one intercessor and that's
[6:24] Jesus Christ and we were reading it last
[6:25] night in Romans why to bringing a
[6:27] thought the thought coming down is heir
[6:29] of
[6:30] God Spirit heir of God that's eternal
[6:34] life heir of God and join HS with Christ
[6:37] will Christ come down in the flesh right
[6:40] cuz verse 14 whatever this was here was
[6:43] made flesh in verse 14 the same person
[6:46] right that's right and the Word was made
[6:49] flesh right so it's not another person
[6:52] it's not even another uh
[6:55] identity it's the same
[6:58] person with another
[7:01] manifestation all right so watch here we
[7:04] see in the beginning was the word now we
[7:06] look that up we talking about Loos we
[7:08] we're not get off of that we're going to
[7:09] go back on a little bit more today in
[7:12] the beginning was the logos and the Loos
[7:14] was with God and the logos was God
[7:16] that's right okay the same was in the
[7:18] beginning with God all things were made
[7:21] by him and without him was not anything
[7:24] made that was made verse 14 and that
[7:27] same logos was made flesh
[7:30] okay now of course this is the son of
[7:32] man that's right right this is the son
[7:35] of man when the word's made flesh that's
[7:37] the son of man dispensation right yes so
[7:39] we're we're SK we're going ahead just a
[7:41] little bit but I want you to see that
[7:42] that same logos that's why last night I
[7:45] was hoping that you know for those of
[7:47] you that didn't make it listen
[7:50] because we we've got this mentality that
[7:53] we're a separate person from God mhm if
[7:56] you got the new
[7:58] birth
[7:59] yeah you're verse 14 that's right that's
[8:02] right right H right that's right right H
[8:07] that's the son of man at the end time
[8:09] that's exactly right yes that's what we
[8:11] got to get
[8:13] to take no take no you know we don't say
[8:17] well the Son of God was here and then we
[8:19] did away with him and now we're in the
[8:20] son of man dispensation no no no he's
[8:24] remember he's the son of God now we're
[8:26] going to read next next Sunday for
[8:29] brother talks about eternal sunship now
[8:31] remember one thing see we got into this
[8:33] discussion with the people that said
[8:35] Jesus wasn't God to the River
[8:37] Jordan they said well brother Brown
[8:39] didn't believe in Eternal sunship well I
[8:40] don't either but watch what he's saying
[8:42] he says the way the Catholics put him as
[8:46] an eternal
[8:47] sunship what father Eternal son Eternal
[8:51] Holy Ghost Eternal they're taking three
[8:53] separate
[8:55] personalities three gods and are making
[8:57] that son eternal
[8:59] uhuh can't be but the Son of God always
[9:03] was he don't gain these
[9:05] titles right right before the foundation
[9:08] of the world he was the son of man
[9:10] that's right corre he just hadn't come
[9:12] to that part yet that's right y right
[9:16] now
[9:17] remember God never
[9:20] developed
[9:22] anything he always was yes that's right
[9:25] he never developed a new thought that's
[9:27] right the only the only reason that
[9:30] we're going through this down here on
[9:32] Earth is to understand that
[9:35] man and the only way for us to
[9:37] understand that man he knows that is to
[9:40] come this way okay all right so that's
[9:42] the way to understand that man that's
[9:44] right because he didn't go up there and
[9:46] say well I think I'll go this route and
[9:48] maybe they'll understand me no he knew
[9:50] see because remember he knows your
[9:51] thoughts he knew your thoughts before he
[9:53] come before you come on Earth he knew
[9:55] what you were going to think your whole
[9:56] entire life that's true yes all your
[9:59] problems all your heartaches and your
[10:01] your problems with understanding him yes
[10:03] right right right right see we got to
[10:06] understand that that God knew that we
[10:08] would struggle
[10:09] with put it in there whatever
[10:12] XYZ but he knew though that this word
[10:15] was perfect and if we ever look to
[10:18] that through dumb
[10:21] donkeys
[10:22] teachers lay people whoever doesn't
[10:25] matter but remember like Daddy said last
[10:27] night the seed had to come through the
[10:28] body and the seed is the word so the
[10:30] word has to come through you can't get
[10:33] it yourself that's right nobody can you
[10:36] can't get it yourself you have somebody
[10:38] has to teach you right and you know want
[10:41] you say well I don't know about remember
[10:44] that's what he thought before the
[10:45] foundation of the world that that's what
[10:46] you need and that's why you're going
[10:48] this Direction that's right see
[10:50] sometimes we don't think about that God
[10:52] already knew what you would struggle
[10:54] about before you got here that's right
[10:56] and he put that provision in this
[10:58] written that's why that logos is that
[11:01] logo it's that one that comes and says
[11:03] hey this is who I am and this is what's
[11:07] going
[11:08] on in my mind this is what's going on
[11:11] like we talked about last Sunday uh you
[11:14] take a logo McDonald's well now that's
[11:17] just a an M says McDonald's right but
[11:20] now you and I know when we drive by that
[11:23] logo what's behind that logo they serve
[11:26] hamburgers french fries not hot dog
[11:28] hamburgers french fries biscuit you see
[11:30] what I'm talking about but now that's
[11:31] not written on the logo why it take it
[11:34] take a billboard as big as this church
[11:36] to describe but they've done such a good
[11:39] job promoting their
[11:41] logo logos they they promoted put it to
[11:45] the Forefront they don't put the menu
[11:47] out on the on the board they put the
[11:51] attraction right you can understand
[11:53] McDonald's by the logo mhm you everybody
[11:57] getting what I'm saying yeah yeah same
[11:59] way with God God there's no way you can
[12:02] understand he can't write he the
[12:05] billions and billions of words needed to
[12:09] describe
[12:10] him look the song says we were in the
[12:13] ocean F Sky partment made every stalk on
[12:17] earth a quill and every man 6 billion
[12:21] people ascribed by trade could never
[12:22] write the love of God so what' God do he
[12:25] brought the logos something we can
[12:27] understand that is somebody that's going
[12:29] to step to the forr say man when I say
[12:31] somebody I don't mean somebody else I
[12:33] didn't say somebody else I said somebody
[12:36] that will step up and promote or
[12:39] show what he's all about well what was
[12:42] the long God the word right right amen
[12:45] now physically it wasn't written before
[12:47] the foundation of the world but this is
[12:49] literally the mind of God Amen yes
[12:52] that's right if it's not we need to find
[12:54] something else this is literally and and
[12:57] you know what it's not everything God
[12:59] thought of
[13:01] right cuz he thought of all your
[13:03] thoughts and they're not written in here
[13:05] he thought of all so and so's thoughts
[13:07] but what he done was he narrowed it down
[13:10] to a logo or a logos he narrowed it down
[13:13] to one where we can understand that he
[13:16] is the word so whatever this written
[13:19] word is now look this word has so many
[13:23] layers to it yes it does cuz remember
[13:25] this is the Eternal Word of God yes
[13:27] we're going to be talking about this
[13:29] 10 billion billion years from now that's
[13:32] right come on people this is this is
[13:34] this is life this is what God but what
[13:37] he done
[13:38] was your Bible would be what 8,000 mil
[13:42] thick and 2,000 Mi wide if you put every
[13:45] thought that God had God narrowed it
[13:47] down to the
[13:48] logos this is what I'm going to do I'm
[13:50] going to speak this part of me and then
[13:53] through this part of me you're going to
[13:55] understand the rest of it mhm everybody
[13:57] got that good amen like McDonald's like
[14:00] the logo we're going to put this arch up
[14:03] right we're going to promote McDonald's
[14:05] but behind it you're going to find all
[14:07] the things building employees what they
[14:10] want you know I mean when you see that
[14:13] what goes through your mind cherol you
[14:16] don't go do what cholesterol yeah NY
[14:22] right well see see what you're doing
[14:24] each of you have a different thought of
[14:26] McDonald M but you can't have different
[14:29] thought of this that's right see you can
[14:30] only use the example so far you can
[14:33] there's only one thought of God now
[14:35] there's a lot of things we can think of
[14:37] him but it's not right but when you come
[14:39] down to that logos and you see that in
[14:41] the beginning was the word and the Word
[14:43] was with God and the Word was God that
[14:45] was his part of him to promote what he's
[14:48] going to
[14:49] do cuz he cuz he he created the world
[14:52] through this amen
[14:56] right all things were made by him and
[14:59] without him was not anything made that
[15:02] was made right so the logos is the one
[15:06] that promoted the creation of everything
[15:10] right the Locos did the creating right
[15:14] right so the Bible says so brother Brown
[15:15] said that the logos is one he said like
[15:18] a he said now it's like a child playing
[15:20] before the father's door well now to me
[15:22] that's an example there wasn't a little
[15:24] bitty kid in heaven playing in front of
[15:28] another man
[15:29] right but it is an
[15:32] analogy to where you're standing and
[15:34] you're looking and you're seeing that
[15:35] somebody's out there saying let there be
[15:37] and he's just he he's playing he's not
[15:39] playing God don't play yeah but it is
[15:42] would be like a kid going well I think I
[15:44] want Jupiter right over there and I want
[15:46] you know I mean you're just standing
[15:47] there and you're going the Earth is a
[15:49] little too far bring it back this way
[15:51] just a little bit I mean you're sitting
[15:52] there and this this person I want to say
[15:55] guy but he's a person this person is
[15:57] standing there knowing where that star
[16:00] needs to be for 10 billion years from
[16:02] now that they don't run into each other
[16:05] that's right and how in the world can
[16:07] people see that there's a a a a ball
[16:09] just called
[16:10] Earth staying in the same rotation yeah
[16:14] for hundreds of millions of years and
[16:15] never jump you know never falling over
[16:17] this away or or you know moving up this
[16:20] away or or you know sure the Earth
[16:22] wobbles because of what man did but the
[16:25] Perfection of God's going to bring that
[16:27] thing right back the sin's what took
[16:28] tilted it off to the side God's going to
[16:31] bring it back when he brings everything
[16:33] back but I want you to understand that
[16:36] that in the beginning was the word the
[16:37] logo the speech that's when God began to
[16:41] take what he was thinking and speak it
[16:45] okay not another person he didn't create
[16:47] another person to do this it was the
[16:50] father made manifest in what in a form
[16:53] that you can
[16:55] see that's what brother R said form you
[16:57] can see like a father play I mean like a
[17:00] child playing before the father's door
[17:01] he set a sacred light now now to me he's
[17:05] making an
[17:07] illustration because to me if you were
[17:10] to look at the pillar of fire if you
[17:12] were Moses if you were standing with
[17:13] Moses with your
[17:16] revelation of the end time the full
[17:20] Revelation you might have saw a pillar
[17:22] of fire but you have sent Jesus standing
[17:24] in that Pillar of Fire Moses Revelation
[17:27] was Pillar of Fire cuz that Pillar of
[17:29] Fire was going to lead him all the way
[17:31] through but now remember brother Bram
[17:33] said that same Pillar of Fire walked by
[17:35] him in the form of a man when Moses said
[17:38] I want to see you right well just for a
[17:40] second he could see him but he couldn't
[17:41] see his
[17:42] face that's right right because Jesus
[17:46] hadn't come yet that theophany was the
[17:49] same man though same man that walked
[17:51] shorts of Galilee same one that walked
[17:53] in front of Moses same one that talked
[17:55] with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden
[17:57] right amen all right so that's that's
[17:59] where the the logos is not another
[18:02] person and it is called the Son of God
[18:05] because it's not a lower form of God
[18:07] it's another form of God all right you
[18:10] understand that it's another form a
[18:13] different form it's I like to say
[18:15] another I don't like to have different
[18:16] in there that makes it sound like if you
[18:19] say different that's two no it's the
[18:21] same man in another form same man in
[18:24] another form all right he stepped over
[18:27] and manifested it hisself coming from
[18:30] the like brother R said the great
[18:31] Eternal that covered everything he's
[18:33] coming down now and he's going to
[18:36] present his logo to the world his logos
[18:38] M cuz see even the scholars know what
[18:41] the logos is it was the creator it was
[18:43] the one that did the Crea well even in
[18:44] the Bible it says you're the Creator
[18:46] talking about Jesus Christ well they had
[18:47] to know that those two link
[18:50] together see that's what I mean the
[18:52] whole Bible if you look at the Bible the
[18:54] way we see the Bible you got to see one
[18:56] true and living God I don't see how they
[18:58] bring a trinity out all that that's
[18:59] right but they do they know that Jesus
[19:01] created the world but he's a second
[19:02] person of the Trinity
[19:04] yeah a son another something yeah and
[19:09] even the people in the message even the
[19:11] people in the message you know they said
[19:12] well he was another identity I don't
[19:14] even like
[19:15] that no he was just another form I'm the
[19:18] same person but now I have the form of a
[19:21] grandfather didn't change one thing
[19:24] except my
[19:25] thoughts right cuz I have a grandchild
[19:29] that's right but now somebody that
[19:30] doesn't know me I'm just a man I like a
[19:33] man I'm not two people my grandpa's not
[19:36] going to walk in the door the meest to
[19:38] Grandpa no I'm here when my wife walks
[19:42] up I have a manifestation for my wife
[19:45] when my mom walks up I have another
[19:47] manifestation for my mother not the same
[19:50] one as my wife that's why you got to see
[19:51] these
[19:52] dispensations where God is the Son of
[19:55] God then he comes down as the son of man
[19:58] and see son of man is where we really
[20:00] have to understand who he is cu it's God
[20:03] made flesh all right cuz remember the
[20:06] Son of God is what Spirit God that's the
[20:08] spirit that's right amen the Son of God
[20:11] is the spirit that's right amen so that
[20:14] spirit that that Loos was not a flesh
[20:16] man that we know flesh standing
[20:21] creating he was in theophany form right
[20:24] right he was a theophany which is a word
[20:26] body right all right he wasn't this
[20:29] light and then come to that it's just
[20:31] like I said about Moses the Revelation
[20:33] that brother brandham had was sure he
[20:36] was this great thing you couldn't
[20:38] understand but if he was a
[20:40] light and then he become a man he
[20:43] changed his form or he changed his he
[20:45] changed his whole being he can't do that
[20:48] if we were made in His image we were
[20:50] made Spirit man not Spirit Bott of light
[20:55] right we were made Spirit man cuz he was
[20:58] a man right that's right he's been a man
[21:00] the whole time he's never not been a man
[21:02] right if he was then he changed when he
[21:05] said let us make man in our own image
[21:06] all right so in the beginning was the
[21:09] word that's right word was with God and
[21:13] the Word was God right the same was in
[21:16] the beginning with God all things were
[21:19] made by him and without him was not
[21:21] anything
[21:22] made that was made and then he talk
[21:25] about he was the light shining in
[21:27] darkness and he talks about John then
[21:28] we'll go down to verse 14 but that logos
[21:32] when he stepped forth and when I say
[21:34] step forth what I'm talking about
[21:36] is I kind of use this analogy if you
[21:39] turn the lights down real low and you
[21:42] and you have this huge
[21:43] Auditorium eternity have this huge
[21:46] Auditorium and it's dark it's
[21:48] black and somebody turns on just a
[21:50] little bit of
[21:52] light well you can see across the
[21:54] auditorium and you notice there's a
[21:55] there's something in the corner you
[21:58] don't know really what it is cuz you
[21:59] can't see it now remember see means to
[22:02] understand okay I'm not talking about
[22:04] physically see it I'm talking about
[22:05] spiritually by the eye of Faith
[22:07] spiritually seeing so there there you
[22:09] notice there's something in the corner
[22:11] well you turn the light up just a little
[22:13] bit more you notice you said well it's
[22:15] not an animal because it's
[22:17] upright you see what I'm talking about
[22:20] as the light comes on more and more
[22:22] you're seeing more but now remember
[22:26] we're going to see this full grown man
[22:28] after a while once the light comes on
[22:29] but he never was not the full grown man
[22:31] that's right right he always was you
[22:34] just couldn't see him that's right or
[22:36] understanding that's right because the
[22:38] light had not shown because see look the
[22:41] light shineth in darkness and the
[22:43] Darkness comprehended it not you can't
[22:45] comprehend when things are dark that's
[22:47] right so he was in that corner of the
[22:48] building see but then as you turn the
[22:50] light on you say well it's a man not a
[22:53] woman so you give it you narrowing it
[22:55] more down okay characteristic then you
[22:58] look in you go more light comes on you
[23:00] go he's got a
[23:02] beard then you got to turn a little more
[23:04] light on so and tell what color his eyes
[23:06] are you see what I'm saying down Through
[23:07] the Ages that's the way God that's the
[23:08] way God brought himself from great
[23:11] Eternal you couldn't understand down to
[23:14] flesh what' he
[23:16] do he turned on more
[23:21] light more understanding that's right so
[23:23] you could see him better that's true
[23:26] amen I want to see you you know yes Open
[23:29] the Eyes of My Heart your heart don't
[23:31] have
[23:32] eyes but that's where you see from
[23:35] that's right that's where you understand
[23:37] you understand from there right all
[23:39] right so let's go let's go to u a couple
[23:41] of quotes here and
[23:45] U cuz I want to really strike this home
[23:48] about this son of God or the logos and I
[23:52] got a problem today I'm leaking I'm
[23:53] spitting
[23:55] everywhere where yesterday to
[23:59] yeah showers a blessing showers a
[24:02] blessing right on the front row yeah
[24:10] Glory all right right here this is on
[24:13] questions and answers we read this last
[24:15] week we're going to read it
[24:21] again now see Jesus was telling God is a
[24:24] spirit and they that worship Him must
[24:25] worship Him in spirit and in truth see
[24:31] God God had to start the way he did
[24:34] remember cuz that's the only way we can
[24:36] understand
[24:37] it that's why we say well we got a plan
[24:42] well our plans change all the time
[24:45] remember God's plan can't change so
[24:47] whatever he is was or ever going to be
[24:50] he was before we were here amen so what
[24:53] he's doing is is he's you say
[24:56] well it should shouldn't happen that way
[24:59] and then you come to the realization
[25:00] that that's the only way it could happen
[25:02] right that's right like we were talking
[25:04] about Martin Luther you couldn't have
[25:06] brought Martin Luther on the scene and
[25:07] then brother brown right the people
[25:09] wouldn't understood him that's right but
[25:12] you had to bring Martin Luther John
[25:15] Wesley little bit more sanctification
[25:17] the Pentecostals with the gifts the
[25:19] speaking in tongues the healing and all
[25:21] that he had to bring that campaign in
[25:23] then brother Bam could step forth from
[25:25] that and the people would easily accept
[25:27] him at first obviously but not when he
[25:29] started preaching this Doctrine but he
[25:31] was more easily acceptable than he would
[25:33] be just coming from justification to
[25:35] that right God knew that that's why he
[25:37] sent these that's why brother brandham
[25:39] had to come being a prophet he had to
[25:42] show us the characteristics of every
[25:43] Church age some people say well the
[25:45] church age is not that important to me
[25:46] it's very important very important to
[25:50] understand the basic doctrines of this
[25:51] message the correct doctrines of this
[25:54] message you have to understand the
[25:55] church ages the messenger what was
[25:57] brought and why it was brought during
[25:59] that time that's right cuz see if it
[26:02] would if that if we if we say well that
[26:04] was God then that's the only way it
[26:07] could come right cuz see you anything
[26:09] you do you look back and if you say well
[26:10] that come from God you say why' it come
[26:13] that way that's the only way God saw
[26:15] that somebody can understand it may not
[26:17] be
[26:17] you right but that's the way God could
[26:20] be understood by somebody in this world
[26:22] he came that way all right and also
[26:26] remember he came to confuse the wise and
[26:28] prudent that's right what the Bible says
[26:29] all right but you know why because he
[26:32] knew what their thoughts would
[26:34] be he knew they never would come to a
[26:37] realization but he came the way he was
[26:39] supposed to come so that his children
[26:42] the ones he thought knew that was going
[26:44] to accept him would come that's the only
[26:45] way he could come so he had to come to
[26:47] logos the Creator and come all the way
[26:49] down through we'll go through the Old
[26:51] Testament um in a couple of weeks with
[26:54] that logos cuz remember he never never
[26:58] changes he always was a Son of God
[27:00] that's what let me go back to that just
[27:02] a second because the Catholic Church
[27:04] believes in the Son of God second person
[27:05] of the Trinity well that's what brother
[27:06] brand was saying cuz
[27:09] remember he can't ever lose that
[27:13] title right he never can lose the title
[27:16] of Son of God but it's the Son of God in
[27:18] a
[27:19] manifestation of the same God not a
[27:22] separate God or a separate identity as
[27:25] some people in the message say they say
[27:27] well got Eternal sunship they don't even
[27:29] understand what brother R's talking
[27:30] about he's talking about the Catholic
[27:32] form of Eternal sunship which makes that
[27:34] second person of a
[27:36] trinity Jesus the second person of the
[27:39] Trinity he's not the second person of
[27:41] Trinity that's right the Son of God was
[27:43] before the foundation of the world
[27:44] always was and always will be amen amen
[27:48] now God is a spirit now if God created
[27:50] man in his own image his own likeness
[27:52] what kind of man did he create Spirit
[27:55] man right so now this is remember
[27:57] remember this is this is watch what
[28:00] brother Bown saying cuz he's going to
[28:01] back up right here cuz see he says he
[28:03] was in other
[28:04] words but he's explaining something here
[28:06] now if you'll notice after he had made
[28:08] all the creation and Creator Spirit man
[28:10] close reading of this now to the one
[28:11] that asked the question we'll find this
[28:13] that God gave the mean of the cattle
[28:15] fish and everything to the
[28:17] man but in his making up there he made
[28:20] him in his own image to lead the cattle
[28:22] lead the Beast of the field just like
[28:25] the Holy Spirit leads a Believer today
[28:27] now what is is the Holy Spirit the Son
[28:29] of
[28:30] God everybody got that amen the holy
[28:33] spirit is the Son of God because brother
[28:35] BR said the Holy Ghost dispensation down
[28:37] through the church Ages was the son of
[28:39] God dispensation because the holy spirit
[28:41] is not
[28:43] a human man right you understand what
[28:46] I'm saying he anoints or inhabits a
[28:49] human man that's right because God is a
[28:51] spirit he's never going to change from
[28:52] that amen that's why I said you've never
[28:54] seen the father at any time you've seen
[28:56] the manifestation of the father through
[28:58] Jesus yes all right start with the Loos
[29:01] though the Loos had to be the same man
[29:03] that hung on Calvary right so he looked
[29:06] the same all the way through remember
[29:10] God's not some
[29:12] gray-headed Gray beard right with a cane
[29:15] That's Right you've never seen anybody
[29:18] Pro portray it in this world ever of God
[29:22] being a young vibrant man they've always
[29:25] portrayed God as being some old the
[29:28] father yeah the Father Figure Grandpa
[29:31] more than that but you want you know you
[29:33] stand up with a state and he's like this
[29:35] you know understanding
[29:38] God I really don't want a god like that
[29:42] I want one that's always been young and
[29:44] vibrant cuz I believe that's what we're
[29:46] going to go we're not going to be old
[29:48] we're going to be young again right
[29:50] that's right but that's the
[29:52] world looking at the father figure
[29:55] that's right cuz then they see they they
[29:58] can bring Jesus as a separate person see
[30:00] what I'm talking about with the Trinity
[30:01] he bring him as a separate person well
[30:03] he's the young guy that you you know
[30:05] he's the one you're going to
[30:07] see I'm thank God for
[30:10] Revelation to lead just like the Holy
[30:12] Spirit leads the believer today so
[30:14] that's the Son of God because remember
[30:16] the son of man is the Son of God
[30:20] inhabiting human flesh right not a
[30:22] separate person same person come down
[30:24] into human flesh to gain the title the
[30:28] son of man all right we'll get to that
[30:30] all right I keep W to scroll with
[30:33] that he was in other words we'll stop
[30:36] right here Adam the first man in the
[30:37] lorder creation of God the first
[30:39] creation was God himself what the logos
[30:42] right the logos stepping forth to where
[30:44] you can understand him not him remember
[30:46] he don't gain anything he gains no new
[30:48] knowledge zero so when that logos stood
[30:52] he knew what he was going to do all the
[30:54] way to the Future home and past the
[30:56] future home and they there was only one
[30:57] path to do it and this is the way it was
[30:59] going to be amen amazing what a mighty
[31:02] God we serve that's why you can't
[31:03] understand the the great Eternal God but
[31:05] you can bring him down into
[31:07] words word I don't even like to say
[31:10] words cuz to me the Bible is one word
[31:12] it's the word it's the Loos amen all
[31:15] right he was in other words the first
[31:16] creation was God himself then out of God
[31:19] comes the Loos oh well that's something
[31:21] coming out well it is when I'm a grandpa
[31:24] that part comes out of me but I don't
[31:26] step over in another form
[31:29] even over here into something else no
[31:32] it's the manifestation of me that part
[31:34] of me comes
[31:36] out right so it's not another person
[31:39] comes out of God and he's standing there
[31:42] right then out of God came the Loos
[31:46] which was the son of God then out of the
[31:49] Loos which was the word in the beginning
[31:52] was the word we read it Word was God
[31:53] word was made flesh and dwelt among out
[31:55] of the lust came forth the
[31:58] man Genesis 1:26 and
[32:01] 27 and God
[32:03] said okay we can say and L God
[32:07] said let us make man in our own image
[32:10] because remember he had
[32:12] children that's right he had
[32:15] children cuz he's already seen them but
[32:19] he had to bring it down to where he can
[32:20] get them out you had to bring it down to
[32:22] where the manifestation had to come out
[32:23] of him which was the word came forth the
[32:28] man oh I get a beautiful picture of my
[32:30] mind if you can take a little
[32:32] trip let's skip go back 100 million
[32:34] years for there was a star moon or
[32:36] anything there was time there wasn't
[32:37] nothing all forever eternity all and
[32:40] every eternity was God and he was there
[32:42] in the beginning now he's looking at a
[32:45] picture no man can see the father at any
[32:47] time no man can see God in the bodily
[32:49] form because God is not in body form now
[32:51] you say oh boy God is not in body form
[32:55] like we see this body form form flesh
[32:57] he's talking about you understand that
[32:59] he's not saying he's not a body form
[33:03] yes because God is not in body form God
[33:05] is a spirit what's he saying he's not
[33:08] saying he's this light floating around
[33:10] no he's in a body form but it's not a
[33:11] body like me and you are looking at a
[33:13] body all right flesh body he's not
[33:15] looking at a flesh body cuz God is not
[33:18] in body form God is the spirit all right
[33:19] no man is seing the father but the only
[33:21] begotten of the father hath declared him
[33:23] first John but notice there's nothing no
[33:25] space No Light No dark no nothing just
[33:28] seems nothing but there's a great but in
[33:30] there in there in all that there's a
[33:34] great supernatural being Jehovah God
[33:36] covered all space of all places of all
[33:38] times now
[33:39] remember this is the prophet going back
[33:41] in the very mind of God and explaining
[33:43] what the mind of God
[33:45] is we got to believe that we got to
[33:47] believe that he is he has gone back God
[33:50] has allowed him to go back as far as man
[33:52] has ever went and F and further to show
[33:56] exactly what God trying to present to
[33:58] the
[33:59] people he's the beginning of creation
[34:02] that's God can't see nothing can't hear
[34:03] nothing not a move an Adam not nothing
[34:05] no air no nothing but yet God was there
[34:07] that was God let's watch for a few
[34:09] minutes no man has seen that now that's
[34:11] the father that's God the Father after a
[34:13] while began to see a little sacred light
[34:15] begin to form like a Halo you can only
[34:19] see it by spiritual eyes to look now
[34:21] while we're looking the whole church now
[34:23] we're standing a great Bast watching
[34:25] what God's doing we'll get right to the
[34:27] question here and you'll see how he
[34:28] brings it in no one has seen God now the
[34:30] next thing we begin to see by eyes of
[34:32] Supernatural looking a little white
[34:34] light for me what is it called by the
[34:37] Bible readers logos or the anointing or
[34:39] the anointing or as I was going to say
[34:41] the part of be God begin to develop in
[34:44] something so human beings could have
[34:47] some type of an idea what it is so he's
[34:50] bringing this down he's he's bringing it
[34:52] to where Moses is at The Burning Bush
[34:54] Moses sees the burning bush but Jesus
[34:57] Christ is the one standing in that
[34:58] burning bush right same thing with this
[35:01] light we see this sacred Halo of light
[35:04] but in that secret Halo of light is that
[35:06] man standing there right but you got to
[35:09] start somewhere so that God can or that
[35:11] man can understand what God is that was
[35:14] a word of God now God gave himself birth
[35:17] to this son which was before there was
[35:19] ever an Adam or heir to make an Adam
[35:22] that will see Jesus said glorify me
[35:23] father with the glory that we had before
[35:24] the foundation World way back y
[35:33] now see look what she
[35:36] says but just by eyes of just
[35:38] Supernatural we see a Halo standing
[35:40] there well that Halo don't
[35:42] stand so see what he's he's describing
[35:45] is a man standing there right there's a
[35:47] man standing there cuz we weren't made
[35:49] in the image of a cloud right but he's
[35:52] standing there now that's the Son of God
[35:54] the logos and also we can bring a word
[35:56] Christ in there Thou Art the Christ the
[35:59] son of the Living God Christ is the
[36:01] creator so Son of God and we'll list
[36:04] these later WR the logos now I can see
[36:07] him playing around like a little child
[36:09] so it's not a light it's a form it's
[36:12] it's a form but but you have to bring
[36:15] the light in to bring it
[36:17] down great this big and then coming down
[36:20] coming down not for his pleasure but for
[36:22] what our pleasure for us to for us to
[36:25] know what he was I can see him playing
[36:27] around like a little child before the
[36:28] father's door with all
[36:30] eternity now then in his imaginary
[36:33] makeup he began to think of what things
[36:35] would be and I can hear him say let
[36:36] there be light so that's the logos
[36:40] explaining and beginning to
[36:43] show a physical
[36:46] creation remember everything was created
[36:48] up here in God's mind first that's
[36:52] right but this for us for us to be human
[36:56] for us being humans to understand God we
[36:58] had to understand that that God had a
[37:00] mouth and he could speak that's and what
[37:02] he spoke came into existence amen so
[37:05] that's why he's coming into this he's
[37:07] coming down to this logos where he can
[37:08] speak or be the
[37:10] logo of this eternal destination that
[37:13] we're all going through so that when we
[37:16] look back we see it was Christ amen amen
[37:21] we see it was the son of God we see it
[37:22] was the anointing all these different
[37:24] things we see that by the eye of faith
[37:26] we'll stop right there and continue on
[37:29] down a little bit further so Lord bless
[37:36] you
