[25:14] but christ being coming high priest
[25:16] through good things to come by a greater
[25:17] and more perfect tabernacle
[25:18] not made with hands that is to say not
[25:20] of this building
[25:22] neither by the blood of goats and calves
[25:24] but by his own blood
[25:26] he entered in once until the holy place
[25:28] having obtained
[25:30] eternal redemption for us you may be
[25:33] seated in the lord as blessing to the
[25:34] reading of the word we're gonna
[25:36] uh if anybody needs one of these charts
[25:37] we're gonna be uh
[25:39] um looking at the chart today and and
[25:42] hopefully not be too
[25:44] too long we got a few things we got to
[25:45] do this afternoon so let's go to first
[25:47] john 4 and read that
[25:49] we were talking last sunday and i want
[25:52] you to understand something we
[25:54] we know that in the end time
[25:59] there's a special group of people
[26:02] because if we continue on like we do
[26:06] and the denominational world uh they're
[26:09] doing an adequate job
[26:11] of of getting people to christ and
[26:14] but you know as well as i do the reason
[26:16] we congregate is not only that
[26:18] it's just as we were talking at brother
[26:19] ray's memorial service
[26:21] we know john 3 16 for god so loved the
[26:24] world that he gave his only begotten
[26:25] begotten son that who should believe in
[26:26] him shall not perish but have
[26:28] everlasting life
[26:29] but now remember that makes you a
[26:30] spirit-born babe in christ you've got to
[26:32] continue on with god
[26:34] you've not got to you can't stay a baby
[26:36] jesus christ didn't stay a baby and he
[26:38] doesn't want you to stay a baby
[26:40] or he wants you to grow up and then then
[26:42] all of a sudden
[26:43] he sends you in malachi 4 he says behold
[26:46] i send you
[26:47] elijah the prophet before the great and
[26:49] dreadful day of the lord so he
[26:50] he saved god almighty in human form
[26:54] saved your soul
[26:55] and then he sent you a prophet one of
[26:57] the seven stars that we were taught as
[26:59] we were talking about last night in a
[27:00] bible study one of the seven stars
[27:03] in the hand of god remember in
[27:04] revelations there one two and three
[27:07] he sent a messenger to each church age
[27:10] a lot of people don't have problems with
[27:11] paul because paul wrote 80
[27:13] of the bible they don't have a problem
[27:14] with john wesley being a great prophet
[27:16] or
[27:16] or or martin luther being a great
[27:19] prophet but when you talk about a
[27:20] prophet in the end time and we call his
[27:22] name
[27:22] and we say william branham everybody
[27:24] just goes haywire well i don't
[27:25] understand why they do that because it's
[27:26] in the bible
[27:27] we're we were needed we needed a prophet
[27:31] to turn us back
[27:32] to the original faith or we're just
[27:35] going to continue going on as we are
[27:36] we're just going to live we're going to
[27:38] die
[27:38] we're going to do this you know you
[27:39] understand what i'm saying
[27:41] but there is an afterlife to this amen
[27:45] and we by the eye of being in the eagle
[27:48] age and being the prophetic
[27:50] people that we are god sent us a prophet
[27:52] not only just to send us somebody to
[27:55] tell us
[27:56] what to do but he gave us a gift and
[27:59] left that with us
[28:00] as brother dale's talking about this
[28:02] morning we all have a prophetic gift if
[28:04] we're under this
[28:05] age of prophetic gift all right we had
[28:09] an age in
[28:10] in uh columbus day that age was an ox
[28:12] age it was an
[28:13] age that labored in burdening just to
[28:16] say that jesus was your savior meant
[28:18] death
[28:19] right amen so we're not into that yet we
[28:22] we don't think but maybe maybe we'll
[28:23] come to that but that was the spirit of
[28:25] the age so each spirit had
[28:28] each spirit was connected to a certain
[28:29] age and this age was in
[28:32] revelations 3 14 which said at the
[28:34] beginning of the creation of god it
[28:36] talks about what i'll give you i
[28:38] sav in other words you're not seeing
[28:39] right you're naked and don't know it
[28:43] being neck is one thing but being naked
[28:45] and don't know it that's a deception
[28:47] and that's most of the world now if you
[28:49] walk outside
[28:52] they're naked and obviously they don't
[28:56] know it
[28:56] or they don't care
[29:00] but what it you know why because they
[29:02] got a familiar spirit and that familiar
[29:03] spirit is not familiar with the spirit
[29:05] that you got that makes you put your
[29:06] clothes on it's really interesting
[29:08] how that uh when jesus comes to gadara
[29:12] and he sees this man named legion that
[29:14] has thousands of demons in him and he's
[29:16] naked
[29:18] but when jesus pronounces the demons has
[29:20] left his body he put clothes on
[29:24] he didn't stay naked he put clothes on
[29:26] anywhere you see that somebody has been
[29:28] made whole they put their clothes on
[29:30] right man so you see now the day and
[29:32] time that we're living there must not be
[29:33] anybody being made whole because they're
[29:35] taking theirs off
[29:37] man so but we know we know that's going
[29:39] to be this because of revelations 3 14.
[29:41] they're naked and don't know it
[29:43] blind wretched miserable naked that's
[29:45] pretty rough all those
[29:46] all those blind rich and miserable and
[29:49] naked and don't know it that's the whole
[29:50] problem
[29:52] so that's why that we are a little
[29:54] different we are
[29:55] as i was telling the people at brother
[29:57] ray's funeral there were some
[29:58] uh unbelievers there and and others it's
[30:02] just
[30:04] there's more to god than just going to
[30:06] church there's more to god than
[30:08] just saying i was i was baptized there's
[30:10] more to god than just saying
[30:12] i was i was saved back in 19 and
[30:16] whatever it is and i'm just here
[30:20] no you got a purpose you're part of this
[30:22] plan
[30:23] and purpose that we're talking about and
[30:25] because of
[30:26] agape love god so loved the world now
[30:29] that love is not
[30:30] filial love that's agape love amen it
[30:33] wasn't
[30:34] filial love and filial love remember
[30:37] as our prophet went across the curtain
[30:39] of time and went into the place that
[30:41] the christians were being held there
[30:43] after their death here on earth because
[30:45] the christian can't die
[30:46] he just moved from one place to the
[30:48] other amen the dead in christ you were
[30:51] you died in christ when you got born
[30:52] again
[30:53] amen so we see that that filio love
[30:56] though doesn't go across the curtain of
[30:58] time
[30:58] because he met his first wife and she
[31:00] said my precious brother
[31:01] all right so that feel your love doesn't
[31:03] go over there but it's agape love
[31:05] and if you're born again today you have
[31:06] that agape love because watch what first
[31:08] john tells us
[31:10] that we have known and believed the love
[31:11] that god hath to us god is love
[31:14] and he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in
[31:16] god now in
[31:17] not around him are known of god
[31:21] god knows everybody in this whole world
[31:24] but those only a few people
[31:26] that are in christ that we're going to
[31:27] read here in ephesians
[31:29] that we were we were accepted in christ
[31:32] or chosen in christ not of christ
[31:36] herein is our love made perfect that we
[31:38] may have boldness in the day of judgment
[31:40] because as he is so are we in this world
[31:43] there's no fear in love but perfect love
[31:46] cast without fear
[31:47] because fear has torment he that feareth
[31:50] is not made perfect in love how many
[31:52] times have you seen the angels
[31:54] appear or even jesus appeared to the
[31:56] disciples what's the first thing he said
[31:58] fear not fear not
[32:01] why because something supernatural is
[32:03] fixing to happen that you're and that's
[32:05] why they call it supernatural
[32:07] it's not natural it's supernatural and
[32:10] when supernat when the supernatural
[32:12] happens
[32:13] people get all jittery right right
[32:16] especially if you don't have the same
[32:17] spirit of the person that you that
[32:19] approaches you
[32:20] hey man you get a little uncomfortable
[32:22] you get a little uh
[32:24] i don't i don't know that you know the
[32:27] spirits are not familiar
[32:28] uh you watch brother branham on the
[32:30] prayer lines he'll walk up and he said
[32:32] oh your spirit is familiar
[32:34] why because they both got the holy ghost
[32:36] and the holy ghost is connected to the
[32:38] holy ghost because there's only one god
[32:40] there's only one holy ghost amen but
[32:42] when he but when he doesn't say anything
[32:44] he and then he'll look at the person and
[32:46] say you need to get right with god
[32:48] well you know that they don't have the
[32:49] baptism of the holy ghost
[32:51] and he discerned that because that's
[32:53] where they were fit their fear
[32:55] how many times did he tell the the
[32:57] people in the prayer line he said oh
[32:58] don't fear that or don't fear the
[33:00] you're going through the change you're
[33:01] just nervous you're doing these things
[33:03] like that
[33:04] but look there's no fear and love but
[33:06] perfect love cat this out fear because
[33:08] fear has torment
[33:10] he that feareth is not made perfect in
[33:12] love
[33:13] we love him because he first loved us
[33:15] now see we couldn't love him
[33:17] if he had not first loved us everybody
[33:21] got that say amen
[33:22] there is no way that we know how to love
[33:25] god unless he loved us first
[33:28] then what he done he projected that love
[33:30] into our soul by the baptism of the holy
[33:33] ghost
[33:33] so soul to soul we are jesus christ made
[33:36] manifest in another form and
[33:38] john says we love him because he first
[33:40] loved us
[33:41] in other words he taught he taught us
[33:43] how to love right
[33:45] and how did he do that he died on a
[33:46] cross and then came back on the day of
[33:48] pentecost and put his soul inside of me
[33:49] and you
[33:50] by the baptism of the holy ghost if man
[33:53] if a man says
[33:54] i love god and hateth his brother he's a
[33:56] liar but he that loveth not his brother
[33:58] whom he has seen
[34:00] how can he love god whom he has not seen
[34:03] now that's pretty uh elementary so let's
[34:05] go to ephesians one
[34:07] and let's read this real quick this is a
[34:10] favorite scripture of mine it should be
[34:12] yours because we've read it
[34:13] 17 times let's go to number verse four
[34:18] according as he has chosen us in him not
[34:20] of him
[34:22] judas was chosen of god adolf hitler was
[34:25] chosen of god
[34:27] anybody was is anybody in the world is
[34:29] chosen of god because they had to be
[34:31] before knowledge
[34:32] chosen to come to this earth as brother
[34:34] dale said because everybody's got a gift
[34:37] look at what he said about elvis presley
[34:39] and all the different ones that
[34:40] came up pentecostal and and was was
[34:43] great in the pentecostal realm and then
[34:45] sold his soul the prophet said for a
[34:46] fleet of cadillacs
[34:48] what he had an anointing that could just
[34:50] bring a whole house
[34:52] into just complete submission
[34:55] but what do you do he did it by twisting
[34:57] and turning and singing love songs and
[34:59] all that he took that gift that god gave
[35:01] him
[35:01] and he perverted it satan took the gift
[35:04] that god gave him
[35:07] god's right hand man he took that gift
[35:10] and perverted it same thing with me and
[35:12] you we've all been given a gift
[35:14] that's why we're going to talk about
[35:15] like said special singing and stuff that
[35:18] those gifts need to be exercised as we
[35:20] were talking about last night in a bible
[35:22] study
[35:23] exercise bodily exercise doesn't profit
[35:25] much but you need to exercise your gift
[35:28] right if you've got a gift and god's
[35:29] trying to get that gift
[35:31] he's going to use it through you he's
[35:34] going to use it through you
[35:35] he's not you don't want to use it
[35:36] through if you give it to donny you
[35:37] don't want to use it through brother
[35:38] dale he wants to use it through brother
[35:39] donnie
[35:40] because there's a certain
[35:42] characteristics of yourself
[35:44] that nobody else has
[35:47] sister alicia sang that song a few
[35:49] minutes ago and i've heard it 500 times
[35:51] on the radio
[35:52] i have never heard it like that
[35:55] but that had some meaning to it
[35:58] the girl that sings it she's a
[36:00] professional singer on the radio and she
[36:02] sings it different and i'd rather hear
[36:04] it that way
[36:05] amen
[36:08] because what it's a gift used with the
[36:09] spirit behind it the right spirit behind
[36:12] it elvis presley was a spirit but it
[36:14] wasn't the right one
[36:15] that he used to do what he used to
[36:17] totally mesmerize the beatles and all
[36:19] the different ones were given a gift
[36:21] and they totally mesmerized the people
[36:23] and the people fell under an anointing
[36:25] that should have been of god and should
[36:27] have been used of god that's why we tell
[36:29] our young people
[36:30] when we try to get our young people
[36:31] involved to get them involved in what
[36:33] we're doing
[36:34] that way that god can use the gift and
[36:36] not satan because satan's going to want
[36:38] to use it first
[36:40] because remember satan is right there
[36:41] with god he's not off somewhere on
[36:43] vacation
[36:44] he's right there with god and as soon as
[36:46] an anointing or god gets ready to give
[36:48] you a gift
[36:49] there's old diablo right there beside of
[36:51] him he's going to say okay i'll take
[36:53] that and i'll pervert it
[36:55] i'll make it for me me me me i
[36:58] eyes oh devil but according as he has
[37:01] chosen us in him
[37:03] before the foundation of the world so we
[37:05] go back to romans 8 and we see that
[37:06] we're heirs and joint heirs with god
[37:09] join heirs with christ or whatever
[37:10] christ gets we get and that's
[37:12] that's the whole issue that i have with
[37:14] the world they want to say yes jesus
[37:15] died on the cross 2000 years ago
[37:18] and then he's my savior
[37:22] but they leave him on the cross
[37:26] or either they put him back on the cross
[37:28] remember what brother branham had to
[37:30] indict this generation for the second
[37:32] crucifixion of christ what
[37:33] they took christ and put it back on the
[37:34] cross they couldn't get him and put him
[37:37] in the heart
[37:39] you and i have got that same god that
[37:41] died on calvary we have him in our heart
[37:44] he came back on the day of pentecost to
[37:46] prove that he was god
[37:48] that he came back on the day of
[37:50] pentecost
[37:51] to what to get into the chosen ones the
[37:54] ones he had chosen before the foundation
[37:56] of the world right here it says
[37:58] before the foundation of the world that
[38:00] we should be holy and without blame
[38:01] before him in love
[38:03] having predestinated us into the
[38:04] adoption of children
[38:06] by jesus christ to himself listen you
[38:08] can't adopt yourself
[38:13] someone has to do the adopting amen you
[38:15] can't walk up even in a court of law
[38:17] right now and you say look i want to
[38:18] adopt somebody they say
[38:19] you won't adopt me you can't do that
[38:22] it's funny but it makes a point you
[38:24] can't adopt yourself you have to be
[38:26] adopted what
[38:27] so satan doesn't want to adopt you he
[38:30] wants you to just be his
[38:33] but you got to transfer that adoption
[38:34] papers has got to transfer over into
[38:36] another family
[38:39] a different family has got to be brought
[38:41] into view
[38:42] so that other family is god almighty and
[38:45] he
[38:46] wants to adopt us right here look having
[38:48] predestinated us
[38:49] unto adoption of children by jesus
[38:52] christ to himself
[38:53] according to the good pleasure of his
[38:55] will now let's go down to verse 11.
[38:58] also we have obtained an inheritance
[39:01] being predestinated according to the
[39:03] purpose of him that worketh all things
[39:04] after the council
[39:06] of his own will i'm just going to skip
[39:08] through some to be short today
[39:11] we obtained an inheritance how did we
[39:13] obtain inheritance there was a plan
[39:16] there was a plan and a purpose of god
[39:17] before the foundation of the world
[39:19] and the reason he did it before the
[39:21] foundation of the world is because being
[39:22] god almighty
[39:24] he knows all things he knew what was
[39:26] going to happen
[39:27] beforehand he knew adam was going to
[39:30] fall he knew eve was going to fall he
[39:32] knew satan was going to do what he did
[39:34] there has been no surprises ever in
[39:37] god's realm
[39:39] never in god's house never in god's
[39:41] dimension has there been a crisis
[39:45] i said his his dimension there's never
[39:48] been a crisis because god don't have
[39:50] crisis he knows what's going to happen
[39:53] he knew what was going to happen before
[39:54] he made satan and knew what was going to
[39:55] happen before he put adam and eve on
[39:57] earth
[39:57] right but now to be god he had to put
[40:00] him on earth and let them make a choice
[40:02] satan made a choice you make a choice
[40:04] adam made choice even made a choice
[40:07] we make choices every day right is that
[40:09] all right
[40:10] we make choices trying to back up a
[40:12] little bit for the
[40:13] for the ones that are here but we have
[40:17] obtained an
[40:17] inheritance now remember jesus didn't
[40:20] come to bring us that inheritance
[40:22] he didn't develop an inheritance when he
[40:24] was on earth
[40:25] now the inheritance was already before
[40:27] the foundation of the world
[40:29] the inheritance was in the father's mind
[40:31] because the father is the only one who
[40:33] can have children
[40:38] if you thought of that the father's the
[40:40] only one who can have children you say
[40:41] no no why
[40:42] well i think if you put the wife and the
[40:46] and the husband together
[40:48] they bring death
[40:51] man that's born of a woman is full of
[40:53] trouble dead
[40:54] born dead if you're born we all we all
[40:56] sitting here today we all were born the
[40:57] same way
[41:00] but see father god doesn't it doesn't
[41:02] take a sexual act for him to bring forth
[41:04] children
[41:05] it's the spoken word of god that brings
[41:07] forth children
[41:08] into like the genesis 1 26 man that we
[41:10] love so much
[41:11] that was a what a spoken word seed that
[41:14] was spoken
[41:16] cannot ever be done away with that is a
[41:19] part of god that satan can't touch
[41:23] he never has touched it and he never
[41:25] will touch it now listen
[41:26] god has not been able to use it like he
[41:29] wanted to use it
[41:31] because of satan bringing us into this
[41:34] domain bisexual desire instead of by the
[41:36] spoken word of god
[41:37] because how was jesus born jesus wasn't
[41:41] born by sex
[41:41] is our jesus wasn't born by no egg of a
[41:43] woman or no sperm of a man
[41:46] god i read you the other sunday god
[41:48] created the egg and
[41:50] created the germ that is god's own blood
[41:53] there was no dna
[41:54] of no man or no woman in the earth
[41:58] ever could trace yourself back to jesus
[42:00] christ so me and you listen
[42:02] that's why paul says we're not known by
[42:04] the flesh
[42:05] now we know jesus had to die but
[42:06] remember the soul is what he give the
[42:09] ransom
[42:10] right his body was a sacrifice reading
[42:13] uh what is it isaiah 52 he gave his soul
[42:17] a ransom so he could see his seed
[42:20] not his body his body his body was the
[42:22] healing part he took stripes on his body
[42:25] for me and you but that soul
[42:26] was where you and i were contacted at
[42:29] because if you're born again today you
[42:31] will have that same soul of god
[42:34] not a second person not a third person
[42:36] not a part of trinity it's one god
[42:40] and jesus christ is his name but you and
[42:43] i are part of that because of romans 8
[42:45] tells us we're heirs and joint heirs
[42:47] listen whatever jesus has got you got
[42:52] do you believe that amen you better
[42:55] start believing it a lot more because
[42:56] that's what's going to change your body
[42:59] because it took him out of a grave now
[43:02] we know he had to die but he died for me
[43:04] and you but when he resurrected out of
[43:05] that tomb
[43:06] he had a glorified body and he's still
[43:09] in that glorified body
[43:11] amen so by foreign knowledge he knew all
[43:13] this so he made this plan and this plan
[43:15] never has
[43:16] you know god's pencil never has an
[43:17] eraser on it
[43:20] mine and yours we have white out by the
[43:22] gallons
[43:24] we have spell check we have all these
[43:26] other things to keep us lined up and
[43:27] keep us straight
[43:28] but god never had he never had white out
[43:31] he never had a
[43:32] a an eraser to say no i don't want to do
[43:34] it that way he knew what to do and he
[43:36] set this plan in motion
[43:38] now the whole situation is is he had to
[43:42] make it where you and i could accept
[43:44] that
[43:45] plan and it'd be the simplest thing
[43:49] as brother joe and i were talking this
[43:51] morning you take
[43:52] brother random you know he's all about
[43:53] he's a he's kentucky
[43:56] no but he don't he don't talk country
[43:58] like i thought country he said just no
[44:00] country boy
[44:01] but his dialect that he used
[44:05] think about it the dialect he used of
[44:07] course he said hate and tote and tater
[44:08] and all that other stuff
[44:09] but you could understand what he was
[44:11] saying because that was god talking to
[44:14] us through that language of that man
[44:15] that was a kentuckian or
[44:17] or what i believe you know he's born in
[44:19] like north kentucky so he was close to
[44:21] being in indiana so he
[44:22] he wasn't a complete southerner like we
[44:24] are but but
[44:26] god needed somebody like that because
[44:28] you know when god walked on the earth
[44:30] the bible says the common people heard
[44:32] him gladly
[44:34] common people the the the the commentary
[44:37] and
[44:37] all that you read about jesus is
[44:39] language it was a common language
[44:41] that was spoken by street people in
[44:43] other words it wasn't a high
[44:44] language that you couldn't understand
[44:46] like you know we have kings english and
[44:47] all
[44:48] you go to jamaica and you swear they're
[44:49] speaking in tongues but they're talking
[44:51] irregular english like me and you
[44:54] you just tell them slow down
[44:57] but they're speaking english but we're
[44:58] not understanding it because we don't
[45:00] speak like that but it is king's english
[45:02] so god spoke to us in the end time by a
[45:04] plain
[45:05] and common language but that was part of
[45:08] the plan this plan that we're going to
[45:09] look at today on it
[45:10] it's a common plan sure it has
[45:13] supernatural content
[45:14] in it but it's it's very simple it used
[45:18] people
[45:20] it used human fallen people to get this
[45:23] plan
[45:24] started and ended if you want to say
[45:27] ended to an eternal plan but not ended
[45:29] because remember a gentile i said the
[45:31] other day that the gentile
[45:33] plan of redemption ends it really does
[45:35] end for the gentiles but see remember it
[45:37] continues on to the jews
[45:39] continues on to the 144 000 i mean
[45:42] continues on to the
[45:44] fifth sealed jew continues on to the
[45:46] white throne judgment where
[45:48] the foolish virgin be given eternal life
[45:50] and a cup of water my name and then when
[45:52] we go
[45:52] live in a new city we're going to see
[45:54] nail scars in his hand we're going to
[45:56] know that
[45:57] there was a price paid
[46:00] for redemption amen but we had to be
[46:04] caught into this dimension we were
[46:05] caught into the first three light time
[46:07] and matter
[46:08] we went through and talked about the
[46:10] fourth dimension which is science
[46:11] or the tree of life or wi-fi or
[46:15] websites or whatever heights you want to
[46:17] call it
[46:20] and satan works through that realm and
[46:21] so does god oh yeah
[46:23] but now the fifth dimension is the place
[46:25] of holding
[46:27] and i want to clear something up too we
[46:29] had spoke it before but
[46:31] remember i read the quote where the
[46:32] prophet of god tells us and it's not
[46:34] it's not a burning hell hell is not
[46:37] burning at this time
[46:38] right if you look up the word hell
[46:42] show kahana whatever you want to call it
[46:45] it is a place
[46:47] of the damned or a place of holding it
[46:49] is a place where
[46:51] if you look in the bible and you read
[46:53] that lazarus
[46:55] was had died and went in the bosom of
[46:57] abraham and the rich young ruler had
[46:58] died and went to hell
[47:00] now he was in a place of torment and he
[47:02] said i wish somebody would come and put
[47:03] water on my tongue
[47:05] but in other words it wasn't a burning
[47:07] place because it doesn't burn
[47:08] up and it's not a place of judgment yet
[47:11] because
[47:12] that's reserved for the white throne
[47:14] judgment right
[47:15] everybody got that but now the bible
[47:17] tells us of a lake of fire
[47:20] now that lake of fire is where you're
[47:22] going if you're not born again you're
[47:23] going to that lake of fire
[47:25] and i don't care how long you're you're
[47:27] in that
[47:28] dimension or in that lake of fire you're
[47:30] going to one day just disappear
[47:33] you're going to just go out of existence
[47:35] because you came here for a temporary
[47:37] time
[47:38] to fill time and the prophet of god
[47:40] tells you
[47:41] that this cannon fodder
[47:44] ashes let's don't be ashes folks if you
[47:47] get the baptism by the holy ghost you
[47:49] won't be ashes
[47:51] you'll be an eternal being with god and
[47:53] that's what the sixth dimension is
[47:55] we know the sixth dimension is christ
[47:57] the saints the dead saints of the
[47:58] resting saints we read that the other
[48:00] day
[48:00] because we talked about paradise i'm
[48:02] trying to get to the place here we'll
[48:04] look at the chart for a minute let
[48:06] sister julie
[48:08] gonna come and do this for for me oh you
[48:10] got it all right oh well gary wasn't
[48:11] laughing for
[48:15] what you hiding for i wouldn't call you
[48:19] up here for nothing i'd have to call
[48:20] 9-1-1
[48:25] but we know that paradise was a place
[48:28] that was made
[48:29] in this plan of redemption see god in
[48:32] this plan of redemption knew that
[48:33] everybody couldn't go into the sixth
[48:35] dimension because they're not born again
[48:36] in the old testament
[48:38] their their sins were covered or capoed
[48:40] by the blood or covered over
[48:42] because an animal blood can't save you
[48:47] actually the blood of jesus christ
[48:49] doesn't save you
[48:52] nope it keeps you safe
[48:56] the life that's in the blood is what
[48:58] came back on you on the day of pentecost
[48:59] the life that was in that blood
[49:02] but that life see i could give my life
[49:04] for my dad or he could give his life for
[49:05] me
[49:06] being son and father but there's no way
[49:08] that if i pass on that my
[49:10] spirit could subdivide myself
[49:14] and go back into him and make him a
[49:16] better person
[49:19] nobody got that right but now jesus
[49:22] christ
[49:24] the soul of souls the eternal one
[49:27] he can do that right he died on the
[49:30] cross one time
[49:32] went to hell went to paradise put him
[49:35] somewhere
[49:36] came back here stayed for a few days
[49:39] left come back on the day of pentecost
[49:42] into the believers the ones that were
[49:44] chosen in him before the foundation of
[49:46] the world
[49:47] and now he's living in the believer and
[49:48] he's the same in me as he is brother
[49:50] dale or brother donny any of you that's
[49:52] got the baptism of the holy ghost
[49:54] you don't have a different god in you
[49:55] than i do or we've got all kind of
[49:57] healing gods running around here
[49:59] amen so he can subdivide his soul like a
[50:02] piece of pie but it's not like a piece
[50:04] of pie that runs out
[50:09] is that one piece of pie you know is
[50:10] that widow woman reached down in that
[50:12] cruise
[50:13] and reached down in that flower after
[50:15] elijah said it won't run dry
[50:17] she dug that thing in with a cup and as
[50:19] soon as she pulled it up the cup just
[50:20] felt the
[50:21] spot just filled right back up that spot
[50:24] just filled right back up in the crew
[50:26] she would reach down and get a little
[50:27] cruiser all and she'd say
[50:28] oh i don't know i better not use a lot
[50:30] of them and she'll look back and it'll
[50:31] be full
[50:32] that's the way god is with me and you
[50:35] he's never going to run out
[50:38] but he's only going to have a certain
[50:39] amount of people in this plan because
[50:40] you know he knows how many people are
[50:42] going to accept him
[50:43] and how many people are not that's why i
[50:45] told you a long time i always wondered
[50:47] about predestination about people like
[50:49] adolf hitler and different ones i even
[50:50] think about
[50:52] uh you know kids and all that are that
[50:54] are um
[50:55] their life has been shortened and you
[50:57] know they were without god you wonder
[50:59] lord why but that's not a cruel god
[51:03] he just knows that that person is not
[51:04] gonna ever accept him see god knows that
[51:07] he knew adolf hitler if he give adolf
[51:09] hitler a million years that adolf hitler
[51:11] would never accept jesus christ
[51:13] so therefore he could let him live his
[51:15] life die commit suicide ever what it was
[51:17] be the
[51:18] be the heathen that he was and god tried
[51:22] to save him
[51:22] and he didn't want salvation same thing
[51:24] with all of us
[51:25] same way he gives all of us a chance and
[51:28] if we turn that chance down guess what
[51:32] we're lost we're done for him but there
[51:35] is grace
[51:36] glory there is the grace of god that
[51:38] continues on and on and on i know that
[51:40] god called me at 14 years old in
[51:42] different times and
[51:44] i gave my heart to the lord but i didn't
[51:45] give it all to him right
[51:47] anybody want to admit that i didn't give
[51:50] it all to him
[51:52] i kept some old husbands
[51:56] i didn't ask him to kill them all i just
[51:58] wanted to act a little religious every
[51:59] once in a while
[52:01] but you know come to find out is you
[52:03] stay in what we were talking the other
[52:05] day about
[52:05] the bible saying that a sinner will not
[52:07] be able to sit in the congregation of
[52:08] the righteous because
[52:10] once the word goes forth you see people
[52:12] fidgeting
[52:14] they get all fidgety you know why
[52:15] they're uncomfortable
[52:17] we used to see it a lot in the youth
[52:19] camps that when we were in alabama june
[52:20] and i were there for eight years so we
[52:22] watched a group of people
[52:24] grow up from youngins all the way up to
[52:26] the to you know
[52:27] teenagers and on up into getting married
[52:29] and you could just sit in the back of
[52:30] the congregation of course it'd be three
[52:32] four five hundred young people in there
[52:34] and you'd be sitting in the back and all
[52:36] of a sudden you didn't have to have
[52:37] discernment
[52:39] right aaron you really didn't you just
[52:41] watched them start fidgeting
[52:43] right you watch them start getting
[52:44] convicted and you watch them start
[52:46] trying to fight that thing and they're
[52:48] not really doing this fighting it
[52:49] they're fighting it on the inside
[52:51] all right and that's why that the
[52:54] brother gary always told us he said let
[52:55] him go the bathroom one time because
[52:57] what they were doing the first part of
[52:59] of the youth camp when we first started
[53:00] them in alabama
[53:02] you know we'd let people go in and out
[53:03] and well they would disappear well what
[53:05] would happen either they'd be out with a
[53:06] girl somewhere
[53:07] that happens and youth camp they'd be
[53:11] outside
[53:12] talking to a girl while the service is
[53:13] going on or they'd be walking back to
[53:15] their dorm to smoke them a cigarette or
[53:16] whatever they're going to do
[53:18] yeah it happens it still does because
[53:20] there's a devil there
[53:22] the devil gets there before you do and
[53:24] then he anoints the people so then all
[53:26] of a sudden gary said brother
[53:28] gary said no don't let him out he said
[53:30] if they go to the bathroom you go with
[53:31] them we had to escort jim where you at
[53:33] we had to escort if you went to the
[53:35] bathroom at a youth camp in alabama
[53:37] you had to literally escort that person
[53:39] to the bathroom
[53:42] why because like brother gary said and i
[53:44] love what what he said he said you know
[53:45] what he said
[53:46] we trust you it's the devil we don't
[53:48] trust
[53:50] so but you see what i mean about that
[53:53] you
[53:54] you look and see the familia familiar
[53:56] spirits and you see the unfamiliar
[53:58] spirit
[53:58] right and you don't have to have a lot
[54:00] of discernment
[54:01] because watch this let's read quote
[54:03] number 13 real quick and then we'll
[54:05] make a few comments at the end of new
[54:08] ones we've read all these before talking
[54:10] about perfect love but
[54:11] watching number 13 and brother branham
[54:14] says look
[54:15] you cannot love with your body you love
[54:18] with your spirit
[54:20] and see that's what when you have filial
[54:22] love for your wife or for your friends
[54:24] or for your
[54:26] children and even under that there's
[54:28] different types of love
[54:30] but that's not the love of god it says
[54:32] you can love even love
[54:34] god and still not be right because you
[54:36] love god with your outside emotion and
[54:39] feelings and
[54:40] all the different things that you let
[54:41] get these anointings get on you
[54:44] and you can love god but you can't love
[54:46] god with your body
[54:47] you love him with your spirit now
[54:48] remember you have a spirit and you have
[54:50] a soul
[54:51] your spirit is memory reason conscious
[54:53] effects and imagination your soul is
[54:54] either faith or doubt there is no
[54:56] emotion
[54:58] come on because it's either god or the
[55:01] devil
[55:02] that's the other that's the only emotion
[55:04] there is right
[55:06] so it's the anointed anointed with the
[55:08] real spirit the holy spirit can fall
[55:09] upon a man
[55:10] in his spirit but his soul is his germs
[55:13] his
[55:13] your soul is where you live that's the
[55:16] firing mechanism when your soul leaves
[55:18] your body
[55:19] your body quits functioning right there
[55:22] is no lights on there's nobody at the
[55:24] house
[55:25] your soul is either going to go in the
[55:26] fifth dimension of the sixth dimension
[55:28] and you're going to go one of the two
[55:29] places and you're going to wait till the
[55:30] judgment amen
[55:32] there is no in between there is no
[55:34] praying you out of purgatory there is no
[55:36] uh halfway house right not in god
[55:39] the holy spirit can fall upon a man in
[55:41] his spirit but his soul is his germ that
[55:43] german's the word
[55:44] and how i don't care how much you can
[55:45] preach how well you do this and how much
[55:48] you love
[55:49] that's just one in other words that's
[55:50] one of the inlets to the spirit
[55:52] you can't love with your body like i
[55:55] said before you don't sin with your body
[55:59] your body is the vehicle that the sin
[56:02] travels through
[56:03] because this same body that you see
[56:05] today drained beer said bad words and
[56:07] did a lot of things that he shouldn't
[56:08] have done
[56:09] but now i didn't have to replace this
[56:10] body and get me another one
[56:13] what the motivator inside is what left
[56:17] so it was this same guy right here but
[56:20] see
[56:20] and i still have the same memories and
[56:22] conscious effects and imagination but
[56:24] paul says turn your affections
[56:27] to christ because my affection was to
[56:30] other things whatever you want to you
[56:31] know you fill out your card i've done
[56:32] filled out mine i told you what it was
[56:34] so you fill out your laundry list or
[56:36] your card of whatever you did
[56:39] but you can even love god because you
[56:40] know it constrains us when you come to
[56:42] church
[56:43] you say oh man i just love god because i
[56:45] can feel it now that has nothing to do
[56:46] with it
[56:50] there's nothing to do with it but do you
[56:53] love god enough to come to church read
[56:55] your bible study
[56:56] pray get revelation from god
[56:59] and be happy about it and you really
[57:02] never
[57:02] run the owls you really never have to
[57:05] speak in tongues
[57:07] because i as brother dale's talking
[57:08] about those nine spiritual gifts
[57:10] those nine spiritual gifts they have to
[57:13] be
[57:13] judged as he said this morning by
[57:17] three witness two or three witnesses so
[57:19] all that has to be judged
[57:21] right but now like i said apostle
[57:24] prophet pastor of teaching evangelist
[57:25] that's not judged
[57:26] god judges those you don't judge them
[57:29] but we have to
[57:30] judge because why why do you why do you
[57:32] say that by the way because seeing nine
[57:34] spiritual gifts
[57:34] they can be imitated wisdom god
[57:38] satan's one of the most wisdom people in
[57:40] the world
[57:42] he's the most knowledgeable person in
[57:43] the world he's just eating off the wrong
[57:44] tree
[57:45] and he makes you and mead off the wrong
[57:47] tree right and all he was speaking in
[57:49] tongues brother brown said you know
[57:51] he said i've seen heathen speak in
[57:52] tongues and take a knife or
[57:54] a blade or something and slice this
[57:56] their skin and nothing come out
[57:58] or hang hooks on their why because see
[58:00] that's a spiritual
[58:02] part but it's not of god right it's a
[58:06] filial love and that word love we say it
[58:09] all the time
[58:10] but it's the most unused word
[58:15] because you know i love to deer hunt
[58:17] well
[58:18] connect that with any other love for any
[58:20] you know your wife or your family or
[58:21] anything
[58:22] no it doesn't work everybody got that
[58:25] and man i'm kind of backing up and kind
[58:26] of slowing down a little bit so we can
[58:28] uh get a point here but so god
[58:35] see where oh you can't love with your
[58:36] body you can love
[58:38] god and still not be right you can cast
[58:40] out devils and preach and do these
[58:42] things and still not be right
[58:44] jesus said so said many would come in
[58:47] that day remember we talked about
[58:49] the last part the word settles it
[58:51] because remember in the bible jesus told
[58:53] us i believe it's in matthew
[58:54] 12 or somewhere he said they'll come to
[58:57] me in that day and said lord lord have i
[58:59] not cast out devils
[59:01] have i not spoken tongues have i not
[59:03] done many mighty great works
[59:05] and jesus is going to say depart from me
[59:08] i never knew you in other words i never
[59:10] had i never had an intimate relationship
[59:13] with you as a person
[59:21] so they mixed filial love with agape
[59:23] love and it's two totally separate loves
[59:26] you can't you can't intertwine them
[59:28] filio love was given for you down here
[59:30] agape love is what you cannot like john
[59:33] said
[59:34] we can't love him until he loved us
[59:36] first
[59:37] so this great plan of redemption is that
[59:39] he loved us first he knew how many
[59:41] people were going to be saved
[59:42] he knew how many people were going to
[59:44] want him he knew who would use their
[59:46] gift in the right way and who wouldn't
[59:47] use their gift in the right way
[59:49] but he lets you continue on because you
[59:51] know what he's a good god
[59:53] but he's not greasy grace either i
[59:56] believe in grace
[59:58] but i don't believe in greasy grace you
[1:00:00] can't go past what the bible says
[1:00:04] amen now there's different things that
[1:00:07] you can
[1:00:08] in different levels that you you talk
[1:00:10] about
[1:00:11] as far as things that happen that go on
[1:00:13] in life
[1:00:15] but you have to go back to what the
[1:00:16] bible says you cannot deviate from this
[1:00:19] bible
[1:00:20] all right because see look this bible is
[1:00:22] full of grace already
[1:00:24] you don't have to manufacture another
[1:00:26] set of it's right here in the bible
[1:00:28] right but like i said before it's not
[1:00:30] greasy grace it's not going to allow
[1:00:32] judas to do what he did and be a
[1:00:35] believer
[1:00:36] right no no way
[1:00:39] judas was not judas was a believer
[1:00:42] but he was an unbeliever he was
[1:00:45] believing in something
[1:00:48] even the bible tells us that
[1:00:51] that the devil and the devil's angels
[1:00:52] believe in one god in tremble why
[1:00:54] because they've never seen but one
[1:00:56] there's not three people walking around
[1:00:58] in heaven there's one
[1:01:00] there's one god not two or three
[1:01:05] all right look let's read this number 15
[1:01:07] because we've got to get it to jesus
[1:01:08] christ and then we'll look at the chart
[1:01:10] for a minute
[1:01:10] so i'll go to number 15 if you don't
[1:01:12] mind brothers
[1:01:14] under the law under the shadow they
[1:01:15] entered in under the shedding of the
[1:01:17] blood of goats and bulls
[1:01:18] which we went through which could not
[1:01:20] take away sin it was a life of an animal
[1:01:22] we just explained that i don't have to
[1:01:23] explain
[1:01:24] it again let's read the red that's why
[1:01:27] it never returns back and having
[1:01:29] anything to do with a human being it
[1:01:30] could not
[1:01:31] but god before the foundation of the
[1:01:33] world for ordained that jesus would come
[1:01:36] the perfect lamb of god into a perfect
[1:01:38] cell that god himself
[1:01:39] created to bring blood into the world to
[1:01:43] offer that blood so you can
[1:01:44] all the other blood had been offered as
[1:01:46] a substitute
[1:01:48] blood of bulls and goats blood of
[1:01:50] animals but listen there was no other
[1:01:52] human being that shed blood to give it
[1:01:53] back to another human being
[1:01:55] when you died you just went somewhere
[1:01:57] else but this man
[1:01:59] the perfect man jesus christ brought his
[1:02:02] own blood into the world
[1:02:04] because if it would not have been he
[1:02:07] wouldn't have been god
[1:02:08] he wouldn't have been virgin born
[1:02:10] because there would have been another
[1:02:11] blood injected in
[1:02:12] even with uh may you know some people
[1:02:14] believe that that mary produced the egg
[1:02:16] well see that you can't that's a
[1:02:18] connection to
[1:02:20] to the sexual part amen so god had to
[1:02:23] create egg and sperm and put it in the
[1:02:25] womb so she was an incubator
[1:02:27] to bring god into the world to bring
[1:02:30] blood into the world to what to offer
[1:02:32] that blood he died i mean he
[1:02:34] was born to die but he didn't was born
[1:02:38] he wasn't born to die for himself
[1:02:40] he was born to die for me and you amen
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:46] so let's keep reading and if you can
[1:02:48] turn him down in this
[1:02:51] hour i love that the sinner that was in
[1:02:52] that blood cell with his love and the
[1:02:54] holy ghost himself
[1:02:55] after that offering of that man can come
[1:02:57] back and possess a believer
[1:02:59] he bought eternal redemption right now
[1:03:01] did you get that then how see it through
[1:03:03] the blood
[1:03:04] washing of the blood taking away
[1:03:06] separating of sin
[1:03:08] that the holy spirit would've the
[1:03:09] believer through the blood
[1:03:11] cleansing of the soul into the
[1:03:13] fellowship
[1:03:14] into this spirit life inside with christ
[1:03:18] shut out the world
[1:03:20] and the very nature of god is in you
[1:03:24] still subject to mistakes but god can't
[1:03:27] see it
[1:03:28] because it's covered by the blood god
[1:03:31] can't see through the blood every time
[1:03:33] he looks through the blood it looks
[1:03:35] white
[1:03:35] he looks through the blood it looks
[1:03:39] white now in number 16 in hebrews
[1:03:41] chapter
[1:03:42] 5 the prophet tells us look not to be
[1:03:45] redeemed today and then next week
[1:03:47] when the revival is over your
[1:03:48] redemption's over no we're talking about
[1:03:50] eternal redemption it goes all the way
[1:03:51] through
[1:03:52] now we have our problems we have our
[1:03:54] backslidings but watch
[1:03:56] go to the next one
[1:04:00] number 16. there you go got it not to be
[1:04:03] redeemed today and then next week when
[1:04:05] the revival starts be redeemed again
[1:04:07] and then oh we backslide and be redeemed
[1:04:09] again
[1:04:10] you're redeemed once forever but you
[1:04:13] better make sure that that is sure and
[1:04:15] right the first time
[1:04:17] because you can't be and i'm sure our
[1:04:19] lives do like this but your spirituality
[1:04:21] listen
[1:04:22] if you stand still in god you've
[1:04:24] backslid
[1:04:26] that's right if you just stand still you
[1:04:29] don't have to go backwards
[1:04:32] because all the other wave of
[1:04:33] christianity is going forward in front
[1:04:35] of you
[1:04:36] that makes you backslid
[1:04:39] are you not born again one other thing
[1:04:43] see you can't you look you can't
[1:04:45] backslide
[1:04:48] you can backslide and be born again but
[1:04:51] you can't
[1:04:53] it's not called backslid if you're not
[1:04:54] if you're lost
[1:04:56] because what are you sliding back from
[1:04:58] right
[1:05:00] if you're born again you can backslide
[1:05:02] brother brown said it backslides every
[1:05:03] day
[1:05:03] we do we do little things that's not
[1:05:05] that's contrary to god
[1:05:07] but we're talking about not you know go
[1:05:09] don't go back and and smoke and cuss and
[1:05:11] drink and
[1:05:12] i want to do this right right and i do a
[1:05:15] horrible job of it when i say this i
[1:05:17] want to preach the gospel i want to meet
[1:05:19] people i want to have a congregation
[1:05:21] that that we all
[1:05:22] are filled full of the holy ghost but i
[1:05:25] backslide from that because i forget
[1:05:27] about you sometimes
[1:05:29] i'm human so are you
[1:05:32] but that doesn't mean that i've that i'm
[1:05:34] lost
[1:05:36] because backslid means you had to come
[1:05:38] that you did come back but you can still
[1:05:39] go forward
[1:05:40] but listen if you just keep going
[1:05:41] backwards and keep doing the same thing
[1:05:43] over and over again
[1:05:45] you need to check your your new birth
[1:05:48] first
[1:05:49] find out you're born again
[1:05:53] you might can do that in denominational
[1:05:55] world you know you can go to church
[1:05:56] three or four times a year and
[1:05:58] and you know some people you know say a
[1:06:01] couple of hail marys and you're fine
[1:06:02] not in this not not the way we see god
[1:06:06] god is a moving god and god moves you
[1:06:08] need to move with him
[1:06:10] and that's the same way with all of us
[1:06:11] we need to do what the bible says for
[1:06:13] satan not assembling itself together and
[1:06:14] all those different things
[1:06:16] sometimes we forget that but not to be
[1:06:18] redeemed today this plan of redemption
[1:06:21] let me just put it simple this plan of
[1:06:23] redemption cannot be broken
[1:06:25] right right there's
[1:06:28] it can't be broken because it's an
[1:06:30] eternal plan of redemption how you gonna
[1:06:31] break something
[1:06:32] that's eternal it's gonna happen you've
[1:06:34] gotta make the choice though whether you
[1:06:36] want to attach yourself to it or not
[1:06:39] to where you wanna be that one that's
[1:06:40] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:06:42] the world
[1:06:43] that god did send you a seventh church
[1:06:45] aged messenger
[1:06:46] to to take all the scruples and all the
[1:06:49] loose ends and put them together
[1:06:50] to where you can look and say aha
[1:06:54] that's what he meant not the 900
[1:06:57] different ways the world thinks it's
[1:06:58] meant
[1:06:59] that's the way it meant that's the way
[1:07:01] it was supposed to be and when you look
[1:07:03] at it
[1:07:03] it's so plain of english and it's so
[1:07:06] plain
[1:07:07] you say how did i miss that well it
[1:07:09] wasn't your time yet
[1:07:11] maybe you were black backslid maybe you
[1:07:13] didn't have god in your life at all but
[1:07:14] you know once you get
[1:07:15] this eternal redemption no more redeem
[1:07:18] redeem redeem
[1:07:19] eternal redemption he that heareth my
[1:07:21] words and believeth on him that sent me
[1:07:23] has everlasting light or eternal life
[1:07:25] and shall never come into the judgment
[1:07:27] but hath passed
[1:07:28] pass from death and to life because he
[1:07:31] is shook
[1:07:32] no because he was baptized a certain way
[1:07:35] question mark
[1:07:36] because he had blood in his hand because
[1:07:38] he had believed on the only begotten son
[1:07:40] of god
[1:07:41] that's how we have eternal redemption
[1:07:44] right all right let's look at number 17
[1:07:46] who is this guy that we're going to talk
[1:07:48] about here in just a few minutes and
[1:07:49] then we'll close
[1:07:51] we've got a lot to do today
[1:07:54] prophet of god says look talk about a
[1:07:56] super sign see a lot of people think
[1:07:58] jesus just came on earth because he's
[1:07:59] the second person trinity and god
[1:08:01] god was up there talking to jesus and
[1:08:03] hey go down there and
[1:08:04] go down there and uh maybe somebody will
[1:08:07] feel sorry for you and
[1:08:08] and believe on you and and they'll get
[1:08:11] uh baptized and
[1:08:13] and they'll we'll take them to heaven
[1:08:15] now boy that sounds like a good plan
[1:08:17] doesn't it
[1:08:18] no that ain't an eternal plan of
[1:08:20] redemption now listen for god so loved
[1:08:22] the world he knew the world though
[1:08:24] was not all gonna love him but the part
[1:08:26] of the world that did love him god sent
[1:08:28] him for that and he didn't send a second
[1:08:30] person he went his south
[1:08:32] that's right amen god died
[1:08:35] in flesh you say oh god can't die i
[1:08:38] didn't say god died i said god died in
[1:08:40] flesh
[1:08:41] amen he gave up actually no man killed
[1:08:45] him
[1:08:47] read your bible the bible says he gave
[1:08:49] up the ghost
[1:08:51] he could have died anytime he was in
[1:08:53] full control everybody in the whole
[1:08:54] world thought
[1:08:55] that guy was so out of control man he's
[1:08:57] up there naked he's got
[1:08:59] yes jesus was naked on the cross we put
[1:09:00] a little thing around him just to make
[1:09:02] it modest in
[1:09:03] this time but he was they said he
[1:09:05] stripped the bible said they stripped
[1:09:06] his clothes off
[1:09:07] and he was hanging there naked before
[1:09:09] the world and
[1:09:10] had spit all over him but you know what
[1:09:12] he was in complete control
[1:09:14] he said into my hands thy hands i
[1:09:17] commend
[1:09:18] my spirit and the bible says he gave up
[1:09:21] the ghost
[1:09:22] no man killed him what a god
[1:09:26] but where did this guy start talk about
[1:09:28] a super sign
[1:09:30] he could have come an angel if he wanted
[1:09:34] to
[1:09:35] he could have come a full grown matured
[1:09:36] man but a baby
[1:09:38] over a pile of manure crying talk about
[1:09:41] a super son
[1:09:42] that's a real super sign a baby jehovah
[1:09:45] crying as a baby a super sign oh my
[1:09:48] then people say he's just a prophet oh
[1:09:50] my the super sign
[1:09:52] jehovah is a boy playing jehovah a man
[1:09:54] toiling in the comforter shop
[1:09:56] jehovah himself made flesh and dwelt
[1:09:59] among us
[1:10:00] stretched his tent right stretched his
[1:10:03] tent down here
[1:10:05] made himself a body to live in
[1:10:08] to have a blood cell that that blood
[1:10:10] cell could be broken hallelujah
[1:10:12] that was the lamb of god that was slain
[1:10:14] from the foundation of the world that
[1:10:15] brings
[1:10:16] us eternal redemption the bible said so
[1:10:19] here
[1:10:19] now he's referring to revelations 13 8
[1:10:23] where the lamb was slain before the
[1:10:24] foundation of the world now that was in
[1:10:26] the mind of god but there had to be a
[1:10:27] literal happening down here listen
[1:10:29] we were all in the mind of god before
[1:10:30] the foundation world but not his people
[1:10:33] so we had to come down here as people to
[1:10:35] develop now
[1:10:36] jesus was before that right
[1:10:41] go to who's this melchizedek brother
[1:10:42] brown says look he knew all things now
[1:10:44] we know he
[1:10:45] there's a question in there but listen
[1:10:48] when jesus said before abraham was i am
[1:10:50] he wasn't talking about the flesh it was
[1:10:51] standing there at 30 something years old
[1:10:53] he was talking about that same person
[1:10:55] that was inside of him
[1:10:56] it's the same person that spoke to
[1:10:58] abraham it's the same
[1:11:00] person that walked in the garden with
[1:11:03] with adam and the same person it said
[1:11:06] let us make man in our own image
[1:11:09] or you've got two or three different
[1:11:10] gods running around it's the same god
[1:11:12] listen that's why he can keep his plan
[1:11:14] straight
[1:11:16] he didn't have a secretary that might
[1:11:18] have messed up something
[1:11:23] he came himself he's done all this by
[1:11:26] himself
[1:11:30] and where's he at today he's in you
[1:11:34] trying to get you to see the same thing
[1:11:37] it brought us eternal redemption we are
[1:11:40] purchased
[1:11:40] by the precious blood of jesus christ
[1:11:43] which has given us
[1:11:45] eternal life now we're going to look at
[1:11:47] the chart real quick but let's read
[1:11:48] these two scriptures and then we'll go
[1:11:49] to the chart
[1:11:50] isaiah 7 14. continue on
[1:11:54] therefore the lord himself shall give
[1:11:55] you a sign behold a virgin shall
[1:11:58] conceive and bear a son
[1:12:00] and shall call his name emmanuel
[1:12:03] now we watch now we that's that's over
[1:12:05] there in isaiah but now let's go to
[1:12:06] matthew 1 verse 19.
[1:12:08] then joseph her husband being a just man
[1:12:10] and not willing to make her a public
[1:12:12] example remember they got married and
[1:12:13] she was pregnant
[1:12:15] back then that meant death amen
[1:12:19] but thank god if you've ever thought of
[1:12:21] this before remember joseph was a
[1:12:22] widower
[1:12:24] joseph was an older man because he
[1:12:27] didn't touch her for nine months after
[1:12:29] they got married which he lawfully could
[1:12:30] have because it was his wife
[1:12:32] if everybody understands what i'm saying
[1:12:34] but while he thought on these things
[1:12:36] behold the angel of the lord appeared
[1:12:38] unto him in a dream saying joseph
[1:12:39] thou son of david fear not
[1:12:43] to take unto thee mary thy wife for that
[1:12:45] which is conceived in her
[1:12:47] is of the holy ghost
[1:12:50] so jesus daddy was who
[1:12:54] the holy ghost i thought he said the
[1:12:56] father was
[1:12:57] his daddy it must be the same people
[1:13:01] hmm pretty simple huh and she shall
[1:13:04] bring forth a son and thou shalt call
[1:13:06] his name
[1:13:06] jesus for he shall save his people from
[1:13:09] their sins
[1:13:10] now all this was done that it might be
[1:13:12] fulfilled which was spoken of the lord
[1:13:14] by the prophet saying behold a virgin
[1:13:15] shall be with child
[1:13:17] and shall bring forth a son and they
[1:13:18] shall call his name emmanuel
[1:13:21] which being interpreted is god
[1:13:24] with us not a second person god
[1:13:28] with us it had to be god
[1:13:31] it couldn't have been somebody else so
[1:13:34] that's where we're gonna and he is the
[1:13:36] let's just talk about that for a second
[1:13:37] and go and bring the chart up if you
[1:13:38] want to
[1:13:39] but in this eternal plan of redemption
[1:13:41] it all hinged on the plan
[1:13:44] number one being perfect which we know
[1:13:45] it was because he's the one that made it
[1:13:47] but it also required that he participate
[1:13:50] in it
[1:13:52] everybody got that because it says right
[1:13:55] here a virgin shall conceive somebody's
[1:13:56] going to come down here in human flesh
[1:13:58] and going to be almighty god and he's
[1:14:00] going to die and give his life for the
[1:14:02] human race
[1:14:03] so there has to be what a man that can
[1:14:06] do it
[1:14:07] and some people that'll be there that'll
[1:14:09] receive it so there's your plan i said
[1:14:11] before
[1:14:12] you can have the best football
[1:14:14] basketball you can have the best plan on
[1:14:16] your
[1:14:16] uh whatever you got going on in your
[1:14:18] life you can have a wonderful plan but
[1:14:20] if you don't number one execute it
[1:14:21] number two
[1:14:22] if there's nobody there to do it you got
[1:14:25] to have 11 people on the football field
[1:14:27] you can grow you can have a play that'll
[1:14:28] score a touchdown every time but you got
[1:14:31] 11 players that you've got to get that
[1:14:33] to
[1:14:33] first then you got to remember there's
[1:14:36] 11 players in opposition trying to keep
[1:14:38] you from doing that
[1:14:40] so that's the devil he's got a plan too
[1:14:42] to keep us from doing all this
[1:14:45] but thank god it's an eternal plan and
[1:14:48] it came from an eternal god
[1:14:50] the devil's not eternal hell is not
[1:14:52] eternal thank god luis did a wonderful
[1:14:54] job doing that
[1:14:56] the other night because that you know a
[1:14:58] lot of people hinge on hell being
[1:14:59] eternal well if hell is eternal
[1:15:01] then there's got to be eternal life in
[1:15:02] hell
[1:15:04] i just that's just really one plus one
[1:15:06] is two
[1:15:08] if you've got to have eternal if you're
[1:15:09] going to have an eternal place and
[1:15:11] there's only one form of eternal life
[1:15:13] there's only one eternal
[1:15:14] anything and that's god then he's going
[1:15:16] to have to be stuck in hell the whole
[1:15:17] time
[1:15:18] i don't think so no it's going to be
[1:15:21] done away with the devil and his angels
[1:15:22] are going to be put in the lake of
[1:15:24] fire all the other imps and all the
[1:15:26] other spirits and all the other people
[1:15:27] are going to be putting that lake of
[1:15:28] fire
[1:15:29] done away with right but remember too
[1:15:32] though watch
[1:15:34] that's way over here at the white throne
[1:15:37] judgment
[1:15:38] they've still those who turn god down
[1:15:41] this is the fifth dimension
[1:15:43] they're still there they still got a
[1:15:46] chance
[1:15:48] they still have an opportunity even
[1:15:51] though being right here in this fifth
[1:15:52] dimension they have an opportunity
[1:15:54] to state their case right over here amen
[1:15:58] the people in paradise they were put in
[1:15:59] a certain spot but when you come right
[1:16:01] here
[1:16:01] and we see that paradise was emptied up
[1:16:03] and it became the sixth dimension
[1:16:05] and that six dimension is only going to
[1:16:07] last until
[1:16:09] cathy what do you got on the back of
[1:16:10] your go in the back of your heart there
[1:16:13] sweetie
[1:16:13] first thessalonians what four
[1:16:17] well man i got it up here too
[1:16:22] mr kathy's got a little heart that says
[1:16:27] first thessalonians 4 16 what the dead
[1:16:29] in christ
[1:16:30] she'll rise first she's got a little bit
[1:16:33] of brother ray around her neck
[1:16:36] oh well that that was his mom and
[1:16:39] daddy's product the real brother raised
[1:16:40] over here under somewhere in another
[1:16:42] dimension
[1:16:42] waiting on us to get our work done
[1:16:46] but his life we know it is life light
[1:16:48] and matter this is the first three
[1:16:49] dimensions
[1:16:51] genesis 1 26 and 27 was not created
[1:16:54] it was not created on earth genesis 1 26
[1:16:57] man was
[1:16:58] in glory genesis 1 26 man was back in
[1:17:01] eternity but we come down to genesis 2
[1:17:03] 16 and 17
[1:17:04] adam and eve were put into flesh and
[1:17:07] according to genesis 3 1-10 that's where
[1:17:09] the fall happened and put us down into
[1:17:11] what
[1:17:12] time so this is the timeline
[1:17:15] right here this is time time started at
[1:17:18] the fall
[1:17:19] we have the quotes we know that and then
[1:17:21] time is going to
[1:17:22] end over here where it blends into
[1:17:24] eternity on the other side but we got to
[1:17:26] get to there first
[1:17:28] all right so god in the old testament
[1:17:31] he gave us as brother dale was talking
[1:17:33] about the two tables of stone we were
[1:17:35] talking about this last night somebody
[1:17:36] was talking about the ark
[1:17:39] the ark of the covenant was given in the
[1:17:42] old testament
[1:17:43] and the two tables of stone were put in
[1:17:45] that's all the word they had
[1:17:47] they didn't have seven church ages they
[1:17:49] didn't have jesus christ in human flesh
[1:17:51] to preach to them
[1:17:52] and for apostles prophets pastors
[1:17:54] teachers and evangelists to come and
[1:17:56] preach to them
[1:17:56] they had prophets moses
[1:18:00] brought the word to aaron aaron gave it
[1:18:02] to the people but god gave him two
[1:18:04] tables of stone
[1:18:05] and those two tables of stone were put
[1:18:07] inside that ark
[1:18:09] right there's one right here behind here
[1:18:11] that an art brother joe got
[1:18:13] and it's got the two tables of stone
[1:18:14] it's got the butt of aaron's
[1:18:16] rod too doesn't it if you want to look
[1:18:18] at it i mean it's back here behind
[1:18:19] but anyway it's a replica of that but as
[1:18:22] somebody asked a question last night
[1:18:24] and see look at the dispensational
[1:18:26] change
[1:18:28] everybody with me look at the
[1:18:31] dispensational change
[1:18:33] because right here this is the ark of
[1:18:35] the covenant this is what they
[1:18:37] depended on the high priest every year
[1:18:41] to go in behind the holy of holies the
[1:18:43] veil was shut
[1:18:44] he would take the blood of a bull and he
[1:18:47] would offer
[1:18:48] one time for all the sin of israel he
[1:18:51] would sprinkle it
[1:18:52] on the different corners and all the
[1:18:54] different things he had to go through
[1:18:56] right but he couldn't touch it
[1:18:59] he couldn't touch it it was untouchable
[1:19:03] because remember the ark was taken away
[1:19:07] and put over into some and i love the
[1:19:08] have you ever read the scripture where
[1:19:10] it the the ark of the covenant was taken
[1:19:12] to another country
[1:19:13] and was put into the same room where
[1:19:16] their god dagon or whatever it was was
[1:19:18] there
[1:19:18] and every time they'd walk in every
[1:19:20] morning that they got the their god
[1:19:22] would be laying face down on the ground
[1:19:24] and they'd pick the god back up and set
[1:19:25] it back up the next day they'd come back
[1:19:27] and god would be stuck
[1:19:28] and then finally the king of that
[1:19:29] country said get that thing out of here
[1:19:33] get that thing out of here so david
[1:19:36] brought it back and the question was
[1:19:37] last night is why
[1:19:40] in other words kind of what why was
[1:19:42] there was a boy remember they were
[1:19:43] bringing the art back
[1:19:46] on oxen which was
[1:19:49] wrong to begin with but this the thing's
[1:19:52] getting ready to fall and this man comes
[1:19:54] out of the crowd and puts his hands up
[1:19:56] on the ark
[1:19:57] to steady it to keep it from falling off
[1:19:59] and god kills him why because god can't
[1:20:02] change his word he said if you touch it
[1:20:03] you die he even said if i'm on this
[1:20:06] mountain and you touch it you die so he
[1:20:08] can't go
[1:20:09] and it was really david's fault
[1:20:13] yeah it never was told to put it on an
[1:20:16] ox cart and bring it anywhere
[1:20:18] it was to be carried by the priest it
[1:20:20] was to be carried by the fivefold
[1:20:22] ministry
[1:20:24] it was the word was to be carried by
[1:20:26] human beings and if they would have been
[1:20:28] carrying it
[1:20:29] that poor boy wouldn't have died
[1:20:32] see how serious this word is now you
[1:20:35] play with this word now it's the same
[1:20:36] thing that happened you'll spiritually
[1:20:38] die that's what we're talking about last
[1:20:39] night
[1:20:40] you'll spiritually die but now what does
[1:20:42] the bible tell us
[1:20:43] now because of him we're to go
[1:20:46] boldly behind this veil and just
[1:20:50] this thing right here is not over here
[1:20:52] anymore it's inside here
[1:20:55] that ark of the covenant yeah there's an
[1:20:57] a there's an actual ark
[1:21:00] because listen it was touchable
[1:21:04] after this man left right
[1:21:08] let me explain that real quick you
[1:21:11] couldn't touch this this was so holy
[1:21:14] and they had this ark of the covenant
[1:21:16] set in the holy of holies in the temple
[1:21:17] even when jesus was there remember
[1:21:19] the bible says when jesus was crucified
[1:21:22] that the the veil was rent from top to
[1:21:24] bottom showing that no man could do it
[1:21:26] because it's ever how many 40 or 50
[1:21:28] feet high it was rent to show the veil
[1:21:31] and they had to walk backwards because
[1:21:33] you can't look at it they had to shut
[1:21:34] the thing back
[1:21:36] but that was god showing them that that
[1:21:38] veil that was not anymore
[1:21:41] god wasn't right here anymore he was
[1:21:43] right there
[1:21:44] and then on the day of pentecost 40 days
[1:21:46] later the book of acts
[1:21:48] he comes down he ascends and then comes
[1:21:50] back 10 days later with the baptism of
[1:21:52] the holy ghost
[1:21:53] according to acts 2 verse 1 and this
[1:21:56] thing sure
[1:21:56] it's over there somewhere because
[1:21:59] remember
[1:22:00] in 1870 titus destroyed the temple and
[1:22:03] took the ark the menorah and every piece
[1:22:06] of that
[1:22:06] of that tabernacle he was able to reach
[1:22:09] and get it with his
[1:22:10] with his unholy hands why because god
[1:22:13] wasn't there
[1:22:15] and they carried it back to rome it's
[1:22:18] sitting under the vatican somewhere
[1:22:20] because titus was a roman general and
[1:22:23] you carried all your booty or whatever
[1:22:25] you got you carried it back to wherever
[1:22:27] your country was
[1:22:28] so this thing is naturally there but at
[1:22:30] a time though
[1:22:31] there was a time and a dispensation that
[1:22:34] that meant something
[1:22:38] look to the ark who was the one in the
[1:22:41] belly of the whale
[1:22:42] jonah he turned god told him said if
[1:22:45] you'll just
[1:22:45] turn and look in that direction he said
[1:22:48] i'll save you
[1:22:50] but now what's he doing now he said if
[1:22:51] you turn and look in this direction
[1:22:54] i'll save you not no more wood and
[1:22:56] mortar not no more of a box i read that
[1:22:58] in the first scripture we read
[1:23:00] but he this was not eternal
[1:23:04] that's temporary you can have a hundred
[1:23:07] thousand of them sit in your house and
[1:23:08] be just as lost as adolf hitler
[1:23:11] but you can't have that man in your
[1:23:12] house and be lost
[1:23:15] amen so look this is a more sure the
[1:23:18] bible says a more sure
[1:23:19] word of testimony than this was this was
[1:23:22] a testimony there were many many
[1:23:24] many people were put in paradise because
[1:23:27] of this little box
[1:23:28] and then believing that that was jehovah
[1:23:31] god
[1:23:31] and that the blood of that animal
[1:23:33] covered their sin
[1:23:34] but there had to be one that took the
[1:23:36] sin away because the plan of redemption
[1:23:39] would have stopped right here
[1:23:42] because this thing got old oh yeah
[1:23:46] i mean it's a piece of wood it's not
[1:23:49] eternal
[1:23:50] but an eternal god had to come down here
[1:23:53] down across
[1:23:56] raise that back up a little bit if you
[1:23:57] don't mind now remember the seventh
[1:23:59] dimension goes continually across that
[1:24:01] way everybody got that
[1:24:03] that's the abode of god listen uh
[1:24:07] it's really not heaven you know the
[1:24:09] bible says heaven and earth will pass
[1:24:11] away so let's don't put all of our
[1:24:14] eggs in one basket and say i want to go
[1:24:15] to heaven
[1:24:17] i thought the bible said we're going to
[1:24:19] live here right right
[1:24:21] okay so there's the seventh dimension
[1:24:24] though that's where god is
[1:24:25] and that god had to come down and be
[1:24:27] birthed as a baby
[1:24:29] birth of jesus luke 2 7. he preached for
[1:24:32] 33 years he preached six seals we're
[1:24:34] going to
[1:24:35] you can put the dates in if you want to
[1:24:36] now go back down to here i mean up or
[1:24:38] down
[1:24:39] go that way there you go so you see able
[1:24:41] died was put in paradise all the
[1:24:43] different ones were put in paradise
[1:24:45] now when jesus died where'd he go he
[1:24:47] went all the way to hell
[1:24:50] man jesus went to hell and preached to
[1:24:52] the souls that were imprisoned and the
[1:24:53] long suffering of the days of noah
[1:24:55] what's the scripture there i read it the
[1:24:56] other day
[1:24:57] but remember death couldn't hold him
[1:25:00] he came back up we've already read these
[1:25:03] quotes that's where we're going to stop
[1:25:04] right here and start again on the
[1:25:06] dispensation of the gentiles in the
[1:25:08] seven church ages
[1:25:09] but all this paradise all this blood of
[1:25:11] animals covered these people's sin but
[1:25:13] when christ died
[1:25:14] he went down here picked up got a set of
[1:25:18] keys
[1:25:20] god said keys let's don't forget that he
[1:25:22] got a set of keys down here
[1:25:23] remember the keys of death and hell he
[1:25:26] comes back
[1:25:27] up here to paradise picks them up and
[1:25:29] takes them up
[1:25:31] some of them resurrected on the day that
[1:25:32] jesus resurrected took them on up into a
[1:25:35] place to hold there's no more paradise
[1:25:38] because that was people were older they
[1:25:40] stayed the same age remember we read
[1:25:41] that where
[1:25:42] samuel was an old man but in the sixth
[1:25:44] dimension there's no old people now
[1:25:47] they're all 20 years old brother joe's
[1:25:49] working on a thing and i'm just
[1:25:51] tickled to death to see that
[1:25:55] with all the people that's went on that
[1:25:57] we'll see that the dead in christ shall
[1:25:59] rise
[1:25:59] we'll never see we'll never see
[1:26:02] them old again ever
[1:26:06] what color was richard's hair when he
[1:26:07] was younger
[1:26:09] huh brown it was lighter brown though
[1:26:12] right
[1:26:13] okay but you see his picture downstairs
[1:26:15] well he had a hair anyway
[1:26:18] people that have hair on the head i know
[1:26:21] people have hair on their head i guess
[1:26:23] that's where it goes doesn't it
[1:26:25] i reckon but you'll never see
[1:26:29] now because of what christ did he died
[1:26:33] for the sin of the whole world
[1:26:34] but only a certain group of people is
[1:26:36] going to accept him we know the old
[1:26:38] testament has closed off
[1:26:40] there's no more old testament there's no
[1:26:41] more see that's what the problem is
[1:26:43] now is the problem is that israel
[1:26:46] believes
[1:26:47] the jews believe that jesus christ has
[1:26:50] not come yet
[1:26:51] right because they're trying to put this
[1:26:55] thing back together
[1:26:56] they're trying to get the temple they're
[1:26:58] trying to get the menorah they're trying
[1:27:00] to get all the
[1:27:00] and the sacrifice the red heifer and all
[1:27:02] that they're trying
[1:27:04] to get something back and we read it and
[1:27:07] we'll read it again in ezekiel because
[1:27:08] we're going to cover daniel 70 weeks
[1:27:10] again because
[1:27:11] in ezekiel or not ezekiel but jeremiah i
[1:27:15] believe it was or
[1:27:15] zechariah says that they'll mourn
[1:27:19] because they think that they're
[1:27:22] this is not come and then there's going
[1:27:24] to be 144 000 that's going to say
[1:27:26] where'd you get those scars in your
[1:27:27] hands
[1:27:28] he said in the house of my friends
[1:27:32] because he died right here but israel
[1:27:35] doesn't believe
[1:27:36] that he's the messiah so they're trying
[1:27:38] to go back into bible days
[1:27:40] and pick up all the blood of animals oh
[1:27:43] yeah
[1:27:44] but you know what they're looking for
[1:27:45] right they're looking for elijah to come
[1:27:50] because see they take hold behold i send
[1:27:52] you elijah before the great and dreadful
[1:27:53] day of the lord they think that hasn't
[1:27:55] come yet
[1:27:59] they missed that coming of elijah but i
[1:28:02] believe through the two prophets which
[1:28:03] one of them is the fifth coming of
[1:28:05] elijah
[1:28:05] is going to explain to them you missed
[1:28:08] that first coming
[1:28:09] you missed that coming of elijah in this
[1:28:11] seventh church age right here
[1:28:14] you missed that coming of elijah
[1:28:17] but god still has grace
[1:28:22] to save 144 000 of them
[1:28:27] and then continue on into the uh fifth
[1:28:29] seal jew and all those different ones
[1:28:31] so everybody kind of got what we're
[1:28:33] we're at jesus christ right now the plan
[1:28:35] of redemption is went through the old
[1:28:36] testament
[1:28:38] it didn't eradicate sin it only covered
[1:28:40] sin and pushed it to calvary
[1:28:42] right it pushed sin to calvary because
[1:28:44] the blood of animals only covers sin
[1:28:47] but when the blood of jesus christ when
[1:28:48] he died at calvary
[1:28:50] like i said before you could have pints
[1:28:52] of his blood and not be saved
[1:28:56] but you can have one speck of a speck of
[1:28:58] his spirit
[1:28:59] of his soul and you're you're saved amen
[1:29:03] but they're looking for natural things
[1:29:04] and here we are we you know and don't
[1:29:06] laugh at them listen
[1:29:08] they were blinded intentionally
[1:29:12] for me and you intentionally blinded
[1:29:14] because you know what
[1:29:15] they believe in one god they look over
[1:29:19] here and look at all these gentiles that
[1:29:20] believe all these different things and
[1:29:22] they go
[1:29:23] crazy people westerners
[1:29:27] they don't they don't know nothing about
[1:29:29] one god they don't know nothing about
[1:29:31] all this
[1:29:32] you know they're they're expecting
[1:29:34] something to come
[1:29:35] because what god done is god blinded
[1:29:37] their eyes right here
[1:29:39] to bring a gentile bride in that's all
[1:29:42] gentile in the bride church age and
[1:29:44] we'll get to it later
[1:29:47] he blinded it a whole nation
[1:29:51] for me and you
[1:29:54] he blinded a whole generation
[1:29:58] right for me and you he let them
[1:30:02] go through a dispersion
[1:30:06] and six and a half million of them were
[1:30:09] killed by eichmann and hitler
[1:30:11] just because their eyes were blinded
[1:30:13] from me and you
[1:30:15] so don't ever look down on those jews
[1:30:18] they paid a price for them rejecting the
[1:30:22] just like me and you gonna pay a price
[1:30:24] if we reject them but they're pl
[1:30:26] they're paying a literal price because
[1:30:28] remember this same man stood over here
[1:30:31] in eternity and he said i'll never
[1:30:32] forget israel
[1:30:34] i may have had to divorce her i know
[1:30:36] she's going to do this i know she's
[1:30:38] going to go after other gods
[1:30:39] i know she's going to be this i know
[1:30:41] she's going to do that
[1:30:43] but i can't she was my first love she
[1:30:48] was my first love i can't do away with
[1:30:49] her because you know what
[1:30:51] they tried david
[1:30:54] tried they all tried the best they could
[1:30:57] do
[1:30:57] but they never could by being covered by
[1:31:00] this animal blood
[1:31:03] take away what that man took away on the
[1:31:06] day of pentecost
[1:31:07] he took an old man named peter that
[1:31:09] cussed in all these different things
[1:31:10] and he took peter and he used him as a
[1:31:12] spokesman
[1:31:14] peter was his spokesman paul
[1:31:18] paul was a vile man folks saul sorry
[1:31:21] saul saul would make christians
[1:31:24] blaspheme
[1:31:25] he would go in and tear churches up
[1:31:29] but god said got a plan for that boy
[1:31:33] because i know when i give him my
[1:31:37] soul when i give him eternal life i know
[1:31:40] what he's going to do with it
[1:31:42] he's going to write 80 of the bible he's
[1:31:44] going to be my prophet for the first
[1:31:45] church age
[1:31:46] he's going to be the man that we're
[1:31:47] going to go to he's even going to be the
[1:31:49] man
[1:31:50] that the 7th angel messenger is going to
[1:31:51] look back and he said i preached exactly
[1:31:53] what that man preached
[1:32:02] if we'd have looked at paul saul we
[1:32:05] wouldn't have let him in the building
[1:32:10] he wouldn't let him in the building i
[1:32:12] mean he was well known
[1:32:14] he was so well known that when ananias
[1:32:16] god spoke down nights and said hey
[1:32:18] there's a man coming to see you whose
[1:32:20] name is saul
[1:32:21] and as soon as he said saul i'm sure
[1:32:23] ananias wouldn't lock yourself in the
[1:32:24] bathroom
[1:32:26] he said you kidding me that man that's
[1:32:29] destroying
[1:32:30] christianity making the people blaspheme
[1:32:34] lord we're hiding from this man and what
[1:32:37] god's saying
[1:32:38] he said oh don't worry he said in other
[1:32:40] words
[1:32:41] i've struck him down right i took him
[1:32:43] down a notch or two
[1:32:45] he's going to have a little different
[1:32:46] spirit when he walks in here but i want
[1:32:47] you to lay hands on him
[1:32:48] that he'll receive the baptism of the
[1:32:50] holy ghost so ann and i said okay
[1:32:53] since you said it that way i think i'll
[1:32:55] do it and i'm sure he probably watched
[1:32:57] paul
[1:32:58] saw the whole time he was there for
[1:32:59] three days he was kind of watching him
[1:33:00] to make sure he didn't
[1:33:02] but remember saul was incapacitated god
[1:33:04] had to make that
[1:33:05] jew incapacitated he couldn't see
[1:33:09] because he knew he was a staunch jew he
[1:33:11] knew he had he
[1:33:12] wanted to do what he wanted to do but
[1:33:14] when his eyes were open
[1:33:18] he opened them in a different world he
[1:33:21] looked at those
[1:33:22] people then as brothers and sisters
[1:33:25] not as the adversary same way with me
[1:33:28] and you let's stand to our feet
[1:33:32] we'll continue on with the plan of
[1:33:34] redemption
[1:33:37] i want to use some of jesus's life
[1:33:41] and show you some of the things that
[1:33:43] that he did that
[1:33:44] maybe the world kind of looked strange
[1:33:47] upon but
[1:33:48] i believe the more we understand this
[1:33:50] man the more we'll understand ourself
[1:33:53] right because being a christian you've
[1:33:55] got to be christ-like so you got to be
[1:33:57] what he was
[1:33:58] and what he still is so we won't sing a
[1:34:01] song if you don't mind we'll go ahead on
[1:34:03] the communion if you need
[1:34:04] listen we have literally seen people
[1:34:08] healed taking communion because it was a
[1:34:11] reverent time
[1:34:12] it was a prayerful time it was a time of
[1:34:15] reflection and a time of us
[1:34:18] coming to a place to where you're
[1:34:20] supposed to get these things out of your
[1:34:22] life
[1:34:23] uh talked to a preacher one time and a
[1:34:25] long time ago and
[1:34:26] he said i said how long how often do you
[1:34:28] take communion he said
[1:34:30] he said well we take communion when we
[1:34:31] think the people's ready i said well
[1:34:32] then we'd never take communion
[1:34:36] when we think we're ready
[1:34:40] i said we take it every month brother
[1:34:41] they'll make sure we're ready
[1:34:43] because we know we're gonna take every
[1:34:45] month so we need to be prayerful get
[1:34:46] these things out of the way
[1:34:48] because it's a solemn time and we have
[1:34:50] literally seen people speak in tongues
[1:34:52] and we've seen people now i've not seen
[1:34:54] speaking tones brother dale did
[1:34:56] with brother dean or one of you did but
[1:34:58] we've seen people heal literally by just
[1:35:00] taking communion
[1:35:01] right and it healed their body so if
[1:35:03] you've got a need today
[1:35:05] you take this communion and you take it
[1:35:08] in the order you're supposed to
[1:35:10] then you know what ask god to heal what
[1:35:12] you got
[1:35:14] take away anything that's in your life
[1:35:17] so let's read first corinthians 11 verse
[1:35:20] 23.
[1:35:22] wine and everything is ready for i have
[1:35:25] received of the lord that's what's also
[1:35:27] i delivered unto you that the lord jesus
[1:35:28] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:35:30] took bread
[1:35:31] and when he had given thanks he break it
[1:35:33] and said take eat
[1:35:35] this is my body which is broken for you
[1:35:37] that's due in remembrance of me
[1:35:39] now we know many people think that
[1:35:41] that's a literal body and all these
[1:35:43] different things we know it's
[1:35:44] this is symbolic that's why we don't
[1:35:46] hold the bread over i will burn it
[1:35:48] before in the morning
[1:35:49] i'll burn it almost to a crisp where you
[1:35:51] can't ever use it again
[1:35:53] because we don't want to hold over as
[1:35:55] they did in the
[1:35:56] um going through the wilderness they
[1:35:59] held that manna over
[1:36:00] and it had it rotted the next day and
[1:36:03] had we had already got
[1:36:05] in other words there were worms in it
[1:36:06] all right so and same way with jesus
[1:36:08] christ we don't hold jesus christ's body
[1:36:10] over it's all fresh it's new manna
[1:36:12] every day it's a new revelation it's a
[1:36:15] new thing that we see so we take bread
[1:36:17] that's that's not
[1:36:18] bought in a store it's produced sister
[1:36:21] lisa makes it a godly sister makes it
[1:36:23] and it's made by holy hands
[1:36:25] and then the wine that we take is not
[1:36:27] grape juice watered down
[1:36:29] it is wine that my daddy makes and
[1:36:31] because
[1:36:32] wine is a stimulant and wine is never
[1:36:34] goes bad
[1:36:35] grape juice and all anything else would
[1:36:37] go bad but wine just gets better with
[1:36:38] age amen
[1:36:39] so now what the the body and blood of
[1:36:42] the lord gets better with age
[1:36:44] that's why i see that we don't do as
[1:36:46] other people do because
[1:36:48] sure it's a symbol but how close to that
[1:36:51] symbol we need to get
[1:36:52] because there's that body you're the
[1:36:54] body of god now
[1:36:57] and then we're covered by his blood
[1:37:00] amen so we're going to partake of this
[1:37:02] communion not just as
[1:37:04] as bread and wine we're going to take it
[1:37:06] because he said take eat this
[1:37:08] is my body which is broken for you
[1:37:09] that's due in remembrance of me
[1:37:11] after the same manner also he took the
[1:37:13] cup which he had stopped saying
[1:37:15] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:37:17] blood so the bible tells us that without
[1:37:19] a new
[1:37:20] testament there has to be a death of a
[1:37:21] testator he's going to die the next day
[1:37:25] which made a new testament in my blood
[1:37:28] because the old testament was covered
[1:37:29] like we said under the blood of bulls
[1:37:31] and goats it wasn't you couldn't drink
[1:37:32] that kind of
[1:37:33] wine or anything to make a symbolics of
[1:37:35] that so he said
[1:37:36] this cup is the new testament in my
[1:37:38] blood this do ye as often as you drink
[1:37:40] it
[1:37:41] in remembrance of me for as often as you
[1:37:43] eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:37:44] you do show the lord's death till he
[1:37:46] comes wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:37:49] bread and drink this cup of the lord
[1:37:51] unworthily now you see that are in
[1:37:54] unworthy manner the bible says shall be
[1:37:57] guilty of the body and blood of the lord
[1:37:59] so we need to clear everything out
[1:38:01] but let a man examine himself and so let
[1:38:03] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[1:38:04] cup it didn't
[1:38:05] say you didn't not take it he said get
[1:38:07] right to take it
[1:38:09] all right but let a man examine himself
[1:38:12] and so let him eat of that bread and
[1:38:14] drink of that cup for he that eateth and
[1:38:15] drinketh unworthily
[1:38:17] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:38:19] not discerning
[1:38:20] the lord's body now who is the lord's
[1:38:22] body we are the lord's body
[1:38:24] for this cause many are weak and sickly
[1:38:25] among you in many sleep
[1:38:27] so that's pretty serious for if we would
[1:38:30] judge ourselves we should not be jud
[1:38:32] if we if for if we would judge ourselves
[1:38:35] we should not be judged but when we are
[1:38:37] judged we are chastened of the lord
[1:38:39] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:38:41] world in other words our judgment's not
[1:38:43] the world judgment if we do the things
[1:38:45] we're supposed to do
[1:38:46] wherefore my brethren when you come
[1:38:47] together to eat terry one for another
[1:38:49] and if any man hunger lady meet at home
[1:38:52] that you come not together in the
[1:38:53] condemnation and the rest will i set an
[1:38:55] order
[1:38:56] when i come let's take about a minute
[1:38:59] you pray the prophet of god says you
[1:39:00] pray for your pastor but you pray for
[1:39:02] yourself to get yourself out of the way
[1:39:05] so that we can take this communion and
[1:39:06] it'll do something for us
[1:39:19] lord i pray that this would be
[1:39:22] not just an event but be an experience
[1:39:26] that will experience you more lord by
[1:39:28] taking this communion because it's
[1:39:29] really communing with you father
[1:39:32] and now we pray that you sanctify us for
[1:39:34] this journey
[1:39:35] bless us in the further melissa service
[1:39:37] in jesus name we pray
[1:39:39] amen the bible said he took bread and
[1:39:41] blessed it
[1:39:43] the heavenly father we ask that you
[1:39:45] bless this bread lord that's been made
[1:39:47] by holy hands
[1:39:49] and lord that it will be to each one
[1:39:51] person here lord knowing that your body
[1:39:53] was broken for us
[1:39:55] and that now by your stripes we are
[1:39:56] healed and if there be any infirmary or
[1:39:59] anything going on in the building or
[1:40:00] anybody that we even have a thought of
[1:40:02] lord may you heal them father
[1:40:04] because by your stripes we're healed
[1:40:06] lord by your broken body
[1:40:08] father we ask these things in jesus name
[1:40:11] amen
[1:40:16] how many people downstairs don't know
[1:40:36] you know the catholic church takes this
[1:40:38] and i don't know who they may buy it
[1:40:39] from somebody i don't know
[1:40:41] but they lay it on your tongue and said
[1:40:42] it's they turn it into the literal
[1:40:45] body of jesus and i just you see how
[1:40:48] people believe stuff like that
[1:40:50] why they've been taught they've never
[1:40:53] been taught any different they've been
[1:40:54] taught from their youth
[1:40:57] but we know different we know better
[1:41:01] this is symbolics this is to let number
[1:41:04] one
[1:41:04] let us know that this has been
[1:41:08] instituted by god
[1:41:10] and it's something we're supposed to do
[1:41:12] if we don't take
[1:41:14] if we don't take it it shows we got
[1:41:16] something wrong right
[1:41:19] and if you're not born again you
[1:41:20] shouldn't take it because if you take it
[1:41:22] unworthily
[1:41:24] you eat and drink damnation to yourself
[1:41:26] so the bible says
[1:41:28] that's why the bible says examine
[1:41:30] yourself
[1:41:34] because in our own humanity listen folks
[1:41:35] we're not worthy
[1:41:38] but i'm worthy because he's worthy
[1:41:40] because i was chosen in him whatever he
[1:41:42] had that's what i get
[1:41:43] right the heavenly father we pray lord
[1:41:45] that you would bless this wine lord
[1:41:49] as we partake of it lord may it just be
[1:41:51] something lord it stimulates
[1:41:53] not only our inside human self but lord
[1:41:56] that will stimulate our spirit father
[1:41:57] that during this week lord
[1:41:59] we'll come closer to you lord by this
[1:42:01] communion that we're about to take
[1:42:03] father forgive us of our sins and bless
[1:42:05] the congregation in jesus name amen
[1:42:16] you know some of you see brother mark
[1:42:18] used to do it brother donnie does it if
[1:42:19] these pieces of it
[1:42:21] flip out of the um the bread container
[1:42:25] when you're snapping it
[1:42:26] it falls out in different places we
[1:42:28] believe in making sure all of it gets
[1:42:30] burnt
[1:42:31] and there's none held over so that's why
[1:42:33] that they do what they're doing we
[1:42:34] appreciate what they do
[1:42:36] brother mark used to do it now brother
[1:42:37] donnie's doing it
[1:42:40] and that's why that we do it because we
[1:42:42] want to make sure it's all
[1:42:44] none of it's held over it's all burnt
[1:42:47] and it's all done away with
[1:42:48] because you know what tomorrow's a new
[1:42:50] day tomorrow's new
[1:42:53] a new opportunity to understand god a
[1:42:56] new opportunity to understand
[1:42:58] what god is to you if it's a journey
[1:43:02] then in a journey what is a journey a
[1:43:05] journey is an opportunity to learn
[1:43:06] something every day
[1:43:07] you're going on a journey since
[1:43:10] charlotte just got back from sedona in
[1:43:11] the grand canyon
[1:43:12] that was a journey and it's places
[1:43:15] you've never seen before right
[1:43:16] you can't say that now she's seen sedona
[1:43:20] she's seen the grand canyon i've been to
[1:43:21] sedona i've been to the grand canyon um
[1:43:25] i've been there part of my experience
[1:43:30] can't never say now that i've never been
[1:43:33] but it's a beautiful place so what more
[1:43:35] of god
[1:43:37] that we're going to take this communion
[1:43:38] and tomorrow
[1:43:40] we're going to continue on with god
[1:43:41] wednesday we're going to continue on
[1:43:42] with god
[1:43:43] next sunday we're going to continue on
[1:43:44] with god every day that we come
[1:43:47] closer that's why he's talking to sister
[1:43:50] trudy mcmillan she said
[1:43:52] you just turned 83 last saturday
[1:43:56] last saturday 24th whatever 24th is
[1:43:59] she turned 83 years young i told us
[1:44:03] you closer that new body than i am
[1:44:09] brother ray just graduated he is
[1:44:13] and it's not a new body we know that his
[1:44:15] ashes are
[1:44:16] here but his newness
[1:44:19] of life when he got born again that's
[1:44:21] what's over there in another dimension
[1:44:25] thank god for this plan folks i'm
[1:44:27] telling you there's no man can make this
[1:44:29] plan and make it work
[1:44:31] no human man there had to be a flaw
[1:44:33] somewhere
[1:44:35] there'd have to be a change that'd have
[1:44:36] to be an oops moment because you don't
[1:44:38] know all things but thank god we had a
[1:44:39] god that knows all things
[1:44:41] knew which way it was going to go which
[1:44:43] way as we say in sports which way the
[1:44:45] ball is going to bounce
[1:44:46] before you even threw the ball so you
[1:44:48] could be prepared and be ready and so
[1:44:50] god was prepared and ready before the
[1:44:51] foundation of the world
[1:44:53] for us to go through this
[1:44:56] and you know what fear not do i have no
[1:44:59] fear amen
[1:45:00] please don't fear let's don't fear this
[1:45:02] thing we call
[1:45:14] life
[1:45:22] now remember as soon as we get finished
[1:45:24] the
[1:45:26] uh song leaders ministers and deacons
[1:45:29] need to meet in my son's
[1:45:30] class please just for
[1:45:34] go over some things that we're going to
[1:45:35] change
[1:45:37] and try
[1:45:42] i'm trying to get everything back it's
[1:45:44] kind of normal again
[1:45:50] just keep praying for the ones we do
[1:45:51] have brothers and sisters in india that
[1:45:53] are that are having a hard time with it
[1:45:54] so
[1:45:56] and nepal talked to a brother from nepal
[1:45:59] the other night aaron had him on on
[1:46:02] facebook live and he
[1:46:03] he watches our sermons and he's what 10
[1:46:05] hours
[1:46:07] 10 hours ahead of us so he's already
[1:46:09] into monday but he guarantee you
[1:46:11] wednesday night he'd watch service
[1:46:12] didn't he when's your last sunday
[1:46:14] wednesday
[1:46:16] 10 hours ahead of us he was already into
[1:46:19] the next
[1:46:20] day and he was watching the services so
[1:46:22] we don't know
[1:46:23] brother keith iii told us a long time
[1:46:25] ago he said brother dale he said
[1:46:27] you're not only preaching to your
[1:46:28] congregation right
[1:46:30] he said you're preaching to people all
[1:46:32] over the world and he's telling the
[1:46:34] truth
[1:46:34] so we just don't know how much how this
[1:46:36] little church impacts all over the world
[1:46:38] because that brother sure don't fall
[1:46:40] asleep during service i promise you that
[1:46:42] my goodness that guy was like a fireball
[1:46:45] but that's just the way they are when
[1:46:46] they
[1:46:46] when you know when the when the lord
[1:46:49] gets a hold of you
[1:46:50] you'll know it let's protect the
[1:46:52] communion
[1:47:05] thank you lord
[1:47:12] maybe we'll we'll um assess the
[1:47:15] situation
[1:47:16] and maybe next month we can get back to
[1:47:19] foot washing that'll put us all
[1:47:22] instituted everything back the bible
[1:47:24] study we got back again we were like i
[1:47:26] said there were 30 people there
[1:47:29] uh my room was full still wore a mask
[1:47:33] but we were good and we had a good time
[1:47:35] we were there for two hours usually we
[1:47:37] can't
[1:47:37] usually we're not sitting around not
[1:47:39] saying anything
[1:47:40] somebody's asking a question somebody's
[1:47:42] got a concern
[1:47:44] and we're able to air those out and
[1:47:47] and in an environment where you can say
[1:47:50] hold on
[1:47:51] what'd you just say what are you talking
[1:47:52] about will you say that one more time
[1:47:55] i wouldn't mind you do that here but it
[1:47:56] caused a lot of confusion maybe
[1:47:57] sometimes when
[1:47:58] people didn't understand then you'd have
[1:48:00] to hold the service up for a minute so
[1:48:02] let's let's set aside that time of bible
[1:48:04] study the first saturday of every month
[1:48:05] to do that between six and eight o'clock
[1:48:07] so
[1:48:07] god bless you we love you with the love
[1:48:09] of the lord thank you for all the
[1:48:11] smiling faces and and all the people
[1:48:13] that you prepared yourself for this day
[1:48:15] now we're gonna go
[1:48:17] um meet the devil
[1:48:21] monday
