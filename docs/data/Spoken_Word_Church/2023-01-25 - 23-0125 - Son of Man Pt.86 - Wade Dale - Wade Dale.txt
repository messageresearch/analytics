86 if you are following this online or something that you're going to see two numbers of mine I got a header number so I'm backing up so the the number now will be the same number as the YouTube um video I guess you might say it'd be part 86 all right so I know we all got needs we've been thinking up to about two o'clock this morning thinking about things and and uh and remembering people and people that are sick struggling going through stuff and uh sometimes we think we have it bad no we don't have it bad no we don't have it bad no there are people that do though that Satan has got them all twisted up and tied up and we want to pray for them that he'll unbind them in the name of the Lord Jesus so let's pray together dear Lord thank you for this day that you give us thank you for this evening and we can come and after we have worked all day Lord in the middle of the week and and Lord we've come Lord to just now Fellowship around the word of God you say whether two or three are gathered in my name there you will be in the midst so father I pray that you would just be with the ones Lord that are sick here in the building sin sick or otherwise Lord I pray that you would anoint them today with the Holy Ghost so much until they overflow and Lord I pray for the ones that are not here Lord brother sister Dale sitting at home him still coughing and all Lord I I in the name of the Lord Jesus we we pray that you just touch his body and and Mom too Lord thank you for keeping covert away from Mama and and Daddy to get over it I pray that you'd just be with him now though and strengthen them Lord so he can come back together with the bride and sister Freda and all the different ones sister Johnny talked to her yesterday well she talked to me and um so she's excited that the Lord's doing a great work and she appreciates everybody and she loves them and she watches in but Lord her legs need a healing they need a touch the nerve or whatever that is they're stopping her Lord we pray in the name of the Lord that you will touch her now go all the way down there in the living room where she's sitting watching now on the on the uh live streaming Lord that you would just touch her body uh Sister Mary Doherty the different ones we were thinking about lordy we hadn't seen in a while since Gene different ones lord they're part of us and when part of the body's gone that's when Luis and Christine and and the girls and brother Bob was gone Lord there was a piece of the puzzle missing there was a piece of the body missing and Lord now that they're back together we feel Lord that that we'll be strengthened by what they went through and the experiences they had and the things they had to say thank you for a church that stands behind Lord people that can go to the Foreign Fields and do your work Lord we don't know on this side but on the other side we'll know how much this church has impacted the places in the world the United States even we'll know it on the other side because somebody will walk up to us one day and say hey I got born again when you preached that service right there praise God ten thousand worlds Lord I pray that you'd be with us in affirmative service bless us and lead us guide us by the holy spirit let us sit and listen to you now Lord move me Lord out of the way and you use this vessel for your honor and your glory in Jesus name we pray amen Son of Man part 86 in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory the only begotten of the father fall somebody say fall fall of Grace and Truth not just part full Genesis 2 9 and out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the site and good for food now stop there's that little uh whatever that is I can't remember what the semicolon thank you all you that are smarter than me semicolon I was not good in English math tear you up English barely made it so and you can tell it now and but then it says stop because that's trees with roots these two trees that he's fixing to talk about are not that's an allegory or that's a revelation that you've got to have to know that that tree of life is a person that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil is a person and there's only two people with power and that's God and the devil and devil don't have any power God allows him to have power all right but they are two trees though to make your choice that's where the chores comes from tree of life treating all is good to know there's no other tree that you've got that you live by you either live by the tree of life or the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil so you may be seated in the Lord as blessing to the reading of the word Isaiah 53 says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he hath put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul he gave his soul we're going to talk about that just for a second because I got a little extra Revelation the other day that I want you to to look at it with me uh when we pull the chart up well Thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin why his soul that's the most important part that's the person of God that's the theophany of God that's the Eternal person of God inside of that vessel and if you're born again tonight you've got a piece of that inside of your soul we're soul to soul Faith or doubt that's it Tree of Life tree of knowledge all right he shall see his seed what his progeny are his bride he shall prolong his days in the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he shall see the travail of his soul listen Jesus didn't live a nice beautiful perfect life yeah he was perfect but he wasn't perfect around him people hated him because why he was the son of man they never had handled a man like that before they never have what the Bible says never have we heard a man like this before him how many of you can say when you get a revelation doesn't matter what man it comes from you said I've never heard a man speak like that before amen amen I hope you experienced that one day he shall see the travail of his soul and shall be what satisfied by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many who us for he shall bear who there our iniquity all right then Jesus said to those Jews which believed on him if you continue see if you continue up the statue of perfect man if you continue up the ladder then you are my disciples indeed because there's many of those which believed on him if you'll read later on they left him a lot of them didn't stay all the way they left him listen when he was at the cross they all left him they didn't understand they got what they got nervous in their in their Spirit realm and they didn't want to get put on that cross I mean it's bold as Peter was he he didn't want to do that he didn't want to go there but he did later so that's the same way you and I got across the bear maybe later but we do have a cross to bear what about a man Peter could stand up and say it's hard it's enough to crucify me straight up but how about upside down have you ever stood on your head upside down for a few minutes yeah don't try it now if you get our age but he was nailed to a cross upside down because he didn't want to be done like his Lord amen so if you continue in my word then are you my disciples indeed listen this is not like we said before this is not a microwave religion this is crock pot slow everything's slow in learning and look and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free if you pull that chart up I sure would appreciate it we appreciate everybody in the back working Aaron it is a little can you get us some cool up here please it's hot back there and it's really hot up here while they're getting that chart up I want to ask you a question and your soul when when when God gives you a soul it comes from God right we understand that correct All Souls are mine so think with me here All Souls are mine all right so if all souls are mine then God is the only one that can give you assault now the soul that he gives you is perfect but not eternal that's why all babies go to heaven that's why he'll give you from baby till the age of accountability which is where you know don't do that anymore then you've known right then if you do it then you're a sinner about with me you're a sinner right and then being that that position that you're in then you continue on and and brother Bynum even talks about your your soul becomes black because there's a nature that's attached to that that's like this world it's this it's the devil because you know why you were born in sin shaping an iniquity so you had to come the way you did your soul had to come the way it did lost doomed and on its way to hell as brothers always said take a little bitty beautiful young little sweet darling baby did you eat that cookie cookie all over their face cook it all over their hands cookie all over their shirt nope I didn't do that they're Liars them sweet little babies are liars that's why the Bible tells us to cry at the birth of a child and rejoice at the death of a saint we get it right backwards so the soul inside of that soul is either what now Faith or doubt that's your two trees that's your that's your free moral agency your choice to make in life we don't get anything else we want to nail this down so your soul is at Faith or doubt everybody with me all right then you've got you say well you're doing this all over again and all that listen there's these little extra part I want to throw in here in that Spirit Realm God gives you a spirit everybody with me remember reading the concert now that Soul has favored out so if it's doubtful it's of the devil it's black it'll make you do black things dark things sinful things right now when that unclean spirit's driven out cleaned set aside for service and then what filled up with the Holy Ghost that is God almighty now let me ask you a question you see that outside that Spirit realm is Imagination conscious memory reasoning and affection brother Brown says you do not love with your soul only agape love you don't love your wife because you know what there'd be no divorce come on somebody there'd be no divorce there'd be no fights because when we get over there that's the copy of what we brought here it's gonna go there now if it goes there and you're you're a jerk then you're gonna be a jerk over there I don't think dirt's gonna make it but you understand what I'm saying so the characteristics of your soul is God if you're born again now I want to ask you a question what's holding you accountable right now it's the memory that you have of what you did in the past be quiet listen to what I'm saying because if you'll see this you'll see why your body's spirit and soul how it works together because brother Brown says the soul is the nature of the spirit and people get that all twisted up and convoluted that's this and back in the other the Bible tells us that God had to send us a prophet to what discerned the difference between the soul spirit and body and I know that brother round did that he he was the only one scientists couldn't pull it apart now you can't cut your body in half and that's what it looks like okay there's not a center realm of you it don't look like a tree okay roof seen the inside of a body I'm pretty sure they don't look like that no it's a pile of mess but your soul is your firing mechanism that's what makes you work because when your soul leaves your body you're dead but now what makes your soul untouchable if you're born again what makes your soul untouchable it's God and there's no memory of what you did before how do you guys think we're going to make it to the body change and our soul remember what we did in the past think a little bit brother Brown never said that memories and conscious infection imagination was here he said that was Faith or doubt here is where we think if you're born again right here listen the Bible even tells us we're sending heaven in places that thing is eternal so there's no bad memory in your soul there's no human infection in your soul that's Agape period there's no reasoning your memory's been cut off in your soul because what happens when we take a body change or when we step over in another dimension the Bible says behold all things are made new where's that come from well it's just something God just throw no you got it in you right now we've not we've not known the soul like we should know what that is inside of us that's why I said let that part of you out though we've got it so hugged up in sin and our memory our reasoning our affection our Consciousness our imagination till we're not letting that man inside work but if you're born again that is God that is the PowerHouse I've been telling that's why brother around said he had to come Build Me Up Lord so I can teach others what teach you who's talking to you it's your soul talking to you from the inside and then Satan's talking to you from the spirit Realm then we have knowledge of who that guy is but when you're not born again you have no discernment you have no discernment it's just all together we did what we wanted to do there was no oh yeah that was a little something in there said hey you don't really don't need it you don't need to do that all right but you know what we did it anyway why did why did we do it anyway when we don't do it now the Soul's been changed the soul has been cleaned up the soul is God doesn't make a mistake never did it wrong I was thinking back in that Genesis 1 26 of course you know that's my favorite scripture I love to preach on it that thing that was made there in the beginning was the theophany of God it was the soul of God which is now inside of you by the new birth never did have a beginning never did have an end that's why brother Brown said the new birth is the most important thing that you could ever have is to realize your soul is now God with no memory of your past there's your C of God's forgetfulness now we remember in our spirit Realm it just works I don't know about you works on me all the time but down inside that guy's not remembering the bad things you did it can't if it's God can it there's no way it can there's no way it has a bad memory there's no way I had a bad thought there's no way to imagine stuff oh come on somebody see what I'm talking about see what you got when you got the new birth you got God the perfect part that's why he said be there for perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect that's where you came from everybody with me so the soul there's your remember that's your that's your key faith it out all right but now when you die and you go across the curtain of time all right let's say you're not born again your soul is still there not the sixth Dimension your soul is still here there here here you have the memories and conscious face and Imagination you take what you remember there because you're a sinner you've not been clean you've not been wiped out that's right brother Brown said a sinner is resurrected in the body they send in and we'll have to give an account of what they did but you and I hey I only got to give an account of what he did that's all I got to give a count up brother Danny is what he did I put everything I got on what he did he took my sin he took my shame and he's inside of you tonight so that's what goes to the sixth Dimension and then in that sixth Dimension you don't just have you don't have past memory you have all the memory remember brother Brown comes across the curtain of time his body's still there so he's still got a connection he's not dead he's just moved over into a faster Dimension and it saw with me their memory says if you had not come we would not have been here now where'd that come from that come from what they took over there their soul and their Spirit went over here in a faster dimension and it not only enhanced what you it just made you God all over perfect love is God's love perfect love is Perfect Memory perfect conscious perfect affection oh listen what you got tonight if it's a piece of God it's all of God but we're not complete those people have got to come back and get their body because you're a unit and that unit is not why did why didn't why didn't those people in the curtain of time say well we're fine here brother we don't want to go by it remember he said he didn't want to go back right he said I gotta go get back in that they said yeah you got to go back said but we'll be judged with you we've got to come back to earth with you to get our what to get our mortal bodies because we're human beings we're not fully human here right we're theophany we're eternal but why wouldn't they want to stay if I if you ever got me an eternal state why would you want to go back there what really why would you want to go back but see their Revelation showed them that when they got back over there according to the prophet's message when they got back into their body it became glorified then you don't have to worry about the sin curse anymore you don't have to worry about my Lord I'll be 63 tomorrow yeah I know I'm not going to go there everybody wish me happy birthday today I know what y'all doing just in case you forget tomorrow I have a way of reminding you but I've got these little spots that come up that wasn't there three or four years ago all you older ones are laughing younger ones are going what are they talking about I got hair where I don't need it I don't have it where I need it that's because that's because of the sin curse but that's all going to be brother Brown you you're bald-headed he said I got a theophany had not lost one of them that 18 year old kid never lost a hair you love the Lord I mean he'd give us a revelation of Who We Are and what we're doing here and what peace and part of us by knowledge that's why I'm coming to this knowledge part by by knowledge we understand and we can divide rightly divide the word of Truth know that Satan is talking to us only in our spirit realm that God is talking us to those to us though through our Center realm which is the soul man all right Chief which one wins one I feed the most feed the outside man you'll get what the outside man is you feed that inside man if it's born again if it's by the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's God talking then brother I'm saying now deity resides in man deity resided in Jesus Christ at one time but now deity resides in The Bride of Jesus Christ that's what the world is not going to ever see and if they thought he was the devil they're going to think you one too because you're not normal you do things different what you think different your control tower is different I think Paul says talk about yielding your members well that's not these they're not yielding these it's yielding those memory reason conscious defection those members you're going to put towards what God's affection not the affection of this world listen this world will love you to hell come on somebody this world will love you to hell I ain't never used one of these before but it well like what a brother said the other day look how close Judas was to the Gates of Heaven he kissed it he literally kissed the Gates of Heaven that's how close he was to heaven he hugged the Lord Jesus and said Jesus said friend would in other words Jim Fran what are you doing and he kissed him that's how close he was to the Gates of Heaven and he wound up in hell same way with me and you how close I don't want to know how close I can get to the gates of hell I want somebody to say enter in praise the Lord made for you when before the foundation of the world before you messed up in your Humanity before you made a mistake in your human being in your human body before all that and then right here I will restore to you the years that all that was beat down Fellowship revelation faith that was eat down folks that was prevalent in the first church age it was okay in the second Church age then he really started eating brother Brown said like at nicaea he eat it down to a stump but he said I will restore you and I are in that part of this not it's not restoring we're not shook this age is not Shock this age is wheat seed what went in the ground sure all that had to come back up life had to come through it but remember when you harvest corn when you harvest that corn that stop dies there's no life in it there's no way it can there's no way it can reproduce itself Michael just went to seed but praise God his seed put in the ground it'll grow something else I will restore to you the years of locusty canker worm caterpillar Palm worm my great Army I sit among you you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God I hope we get to it we're going to talk a little bit about teaching and what teaching does for us if we get to it if we don't we'll do it a couple weeks and praise the name of the Lord that hath dealt wondrously with you and my people shall never be ashamed you should never be ashamed to be a Christian if you're ashamed to be a Christian you ain't one hello well I might might what you might let your light shine and let somebody see it because this world is like really dark if y'all have not noticed that look at all that happened in California a six-year-old kid gets the gun off of Daddy's he should have been well I don't say he shouldn't be shot but the daddy should have never left that there but that six-year-old kid he watches movies he watches video games oh I'm just gonna go to my teacher well she did or he did whichever one I can't remember where we got a little boy I guess six years old six what were you doing at six I couldn't hardly walk and they're picking up guns now and the parents were letting them it's all parental delinquency folks once you see what's going on it is the parent's fault Prophets for man when I took out prayer and they took out the Bible and they took out punishment in the schools look what happened a bunch of a bunch of intellectual idiots when it comes to here when it comes even to the world just to live listen you didn't hear none of that when we were growing up the worst you had was maybe two girls got mad at each other for dating the same boy and they whacked each other around and pulled each other hair and then it was done worst fight I ever seen was two women two girls the Bible said something about a woman's scorn so anyway praise the Lord anyway Whom Shall he teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine who's us them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast no where your soul is I don't mean is with God where your spirit is with God because if your soul is born again one more time you're just as Eternal as God is you've just got a human being attached to it and we have to because we fail because of Eve what happened between even the beast that's where we came from but you know what you can't blame it on Eve now you have the tree of knowledge and the Tree of Life in front of you tonight you're going to eat one or you're going to eat the other one of the two and the Bible said we'll read in just a minute God told them if you eat of that tree you're going to die if you eat of this tree that's why it's called a tree of life and we're heading toward adoption I hope you'll see that that we're not it's not an adoption like you adopt a kid we talked about last week about how you it say a girl can't have a sister can't have a kid and she goes and adopts the kid from a foster home or that's not what this is talking about this in the Bible is talking about taking your own son your own son and seeing how he grows and how he listens to the tutor or the teacher and how good that he obeys his teacher and obeys his parents then God will adopt you into the family of God not adopt you into the family like you never was he's going to give you more power that's what brother Branham really the whole the whole message sums up in one thing he he come to open the book to give us power that we lost in the church ages because of that bug eating everything down we lost it because he shut the door we couldn't get to what we couldn't get to the door I am the door he said to the Sheepfold all right let's look at this real quick knowledge add to Virtue knowledge no cease which is science knowledge I want to read this one right here we've been reading it before but such as belongs to the more advanced you say well I don't know anything an excuse listen God does not mind that you didn't go through the seventh grade sixth grade 10th grade brother Brown was seventh grade but he was an intellectual Einstein as far as the scripture he was an intellectual Einstein he was a supernatural Einstein that could look into the mind of God where where Einstein with his own human brain that I would assume I'm not trying to put him to hell but if he didn't get born again that's where he's ending up he could be the smartest man in the world give us all kind of Technology if you're not born again doesn't matter about all that but such as belong to the more advanced especially if things lawful and unlawful for Christians moral wisdom such as seen in right living then Genesis 2 9 we talked about this again out of the ground made the Lord to grow every tree the Tree of Life where in the midst of the garden the Bible says in the midst of the paradises of God in the midst and [Music] completely crazy and be born again in your soul you can let a demon get on you and you can do things that you really didn't want anyone come on somebody look at that preacher brother Brown said he was a believer he was a preacher of the gospel for his time he said I ain't preaching no more he got a spirit on him and that Spirit drove him to drinking well God just went ahead and just took him on home his life got real short at that point in time because he couldn't get that thing off of him we need to get that off of us not that drinking Spirit but any Spirit we got attached to us it's in that Spirit Realm and it's it's trying to affect your soul it can't move your soul it can't take your soul away from you but it can affect it that's what these that's what these virtues do because remember they would come the Satan would come to Jesus it is written he had knowledge to tell him the right thing at the right time look at the Pharisees they give him all this all these questions and he said let me ask you one did David say when he said to the Lord and said unto my Lord is he talking to this Lord of that Lord what the Bible tell you they never ask you another question after that why it confounded them by the knowledge of God that was in that man that same knowledge can be in you that's why we can confound the scholars that's why we can confound the people of this world that thinks that we're you know we're we're so bound and we're so do's and don'ts and we got to do this and we got no they just don't understand they're the most bound people we are free in Liberty in Jesus Christ and they are so Bound by the devil until they don't realize it now lest he put forth his hand now the Lord drove him out of the garden because if he had left them in the garden they'd become one of us knowing all tree of life and eat and live forever so they had to drive him out and where'd they drive it to they drove us out of the Garden of Eden so we could be born of a man but then what happened when Jesus came Jesus said I am the way the truth of the life to go back to the Garden of Eden right brother Brown said the threefold purpose of God was what all God was he poured into Christ Christ in the church and do what take her back to the Garden of Eden because in Revelations 20 or 21 or 22 we see this tree of life pop back up in the new city and it is a tree then that we take the leaves off the Nations and they go outside and do all the things but that tree of life is me and you and the world is eating off of that how do you think people listen the seed life comes to the body even and lies even Paul the great prophet had to go to ananas and and nice pray for him to get the Holy Ghost why didn't he just say oh it just that thing just came alive inside of me and I'm I'm good to go no God said you're not going to see for about three days I'm gonna blind you naturally you're going to need some help it's all because you didn't think you needed any help for that sent him to a place and sent ananias to pray for him to get the Holy Ghost and the scales come off of his eyes a prophet of God yeah a proper to God Prophet at one time was lost we good I want to read you something I got in a um texted me today let me read you this quote let me tell you how how much knowledge people have direct quote from headquarters the bride is making herself ready by pressing play direct quote the bride is making herself ready by pressing play my knowledge doesn't go with that that don't ring a bell I can't shout about that that actually makes me really really sad is how many people are falling for that you might get born again under that but you're not stay Born Again under that I promise you that you won't grow I promise you that because without a Firefall Ministry you can't grow that's why the Bible when you take knowledge and teaching they go together all right without teaching there's no knowledge and you have no knowledge if you don't if you're not taught but am I with me all right I can get it on my own please try that's why we're a congregation we're sheep we need Shepherd we need somebody to run the thing we we're just that way I'm sorry that's what God Said and the Lord God look commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden you'll eat freely but of the tree of the knowledge of Good and Evil Thou shalt not eat of it for in the day you eat thereof thou the day thou surely shall die man-made gunpowder so we can deer hunt with it also kills about 25 or a million people all over the world every year cars are the biggest killer in the United States there is and we made them not counting cigarettes and beer and all that other stuff that kills us everybody with me all right knowledge my knowledge my man's knowledge we die but we eat off that tree of life and just say God you said you'd feed me you said you'd do this for me you said oh that's kind of bold no that's not bold enough he said come boldly to the throne of grace ask what you will brother Brown said ask for big things well I don't know about that I I that's one thing gets under my skin is somebody tries to be humble that's not but y'all got to listen to me today press play under the angel of Church of Ephesus right these things saith who hold us the seven spiers in his right hand who walks Us in the midst of seven golden candlesticks I Know Thy works and labor in thy patience look look how the holy spirit is going through the church in the first church age Ephesus he's going through the church and he's Discerning what they're seeing and what they're not seeing ain't that what's happening now he's a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart I Know Thy Works in thy labor and thy patience and how thou cast not bear them which are evil and thou has tried them which say they are Apostles and are not and has found them liars and that's born as patience for my name's sake has labored and has not fainted nevertheless here we go to the human part here we go to the spirit Realm we know they were born again in the in the first church age amen there was a born-again powerful group of people but they fell from their first love they fell away from the love that they had in the beginning nevertheless I have somewhat against it because thou has to left thy First Love remember therefore from which thou are falling and repent and do the first words or else I will come quickly and remove your Candlestick out of its place except thou repent but their style has that thou haters to Deeds of the Nicolaitans hate us the Deeds of Nicholas God hates you after he just said he did God hates those deeds he hates for the laity to be conquered by one head person I'm reading the Bible you can argue with it if you want to he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit says to the church now listen that's not your natural ear that's not that well there's a ear up here somewhere I thought there was seed field up here I think yeah right there that's not that ear right there thank you brother Joe that's not that ear right there you can sit here and listen to the message for 50 years and die and go to hell but if you'll ever hear what the spirit says to you you'll not die you'll go to heaven he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirit saith to the church to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life was in the midst of the paradise of God here we go teach it Whom Shall he teach knowledge that's what we were saying a minute ago and Whom Shall he make understand Doctrine them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast I know that I I know I know I know for a fact from the 20-something years I've been back um serving the lord that you see people that just struggle over the little stuff the little stuff but the Bible said it's the little foxes listen just like I stumbled just now it was that little leg I wasn't looking at that stumbled me if it hadn't been a big brick there I'd have probably seen it I said probably but you see what I mean that's why I stumbled over because I didn't see it how many times you've been walking in the yard and you stumbled over a rock and it didn't stick up but about that high thank you brother all the time you need to be careful Lord of Mercy brother get you a cane or something but that's what you stumble over you still if you see a girl that's what we're looking at now everybody's got to start small though everybody's going to get those little things out of the way all of us do we need to be wise in God not wise in the world knowledge the fact or condition of knowing something with familiarity do you is there is this message familiar to you but now I ask you another question can you live it it can be familiar I've seen a lot of people know the message read the message and they walk out that door and their hair is just straight across and your hair don't usually grow that way ain't it happening so don't fool me and don't fool God all right don't take this armor to see stuff like that but we're familiar look with something with familiarity gained what through experience our association I come to this church because I believe it's preaching the truth not just me everybody all the all the ministry we have here is preaching the truth amen that's why I come here and that tells me I'm going to associate with this group of people I'm not going to associate with that group now I I'm going to go out there I got to go in the world and let your light shine but I'm not going to say well well now what did Brother Brown say one time he said he said don't you let some little Ricky tell you you go to my church one Sunday and I'll go to your church next Sunday I'm quoting brother Branham he said don't you do that you're on the Devil's Ground now how many I've heard people in the message well I think I'll just go over here for a little while let my light shine yeah buddy you didn't see them no more either I must either got put out or something happen but I can walk I feel if you're a mature Christian you can walk into a Baptist Church and sit there when they're having a meeting get something out of it but let your light shine and not get caught up in it now I want to ask you a question though can you go to another message Church and discern what they're preaching and be able to sit there and fellowship with them that's a question I ask you the circumstance or condition of what apprehending truth go get truth apprehending truth or fact through reasoning come let us reason together John 8 4 8 31 says then then said Jesus to those Jews which we already read this but I'm gonna give you the no part if you continue my word then you are my disciples indeed and you shall know the truth not know of it listen zillions of people's read this Bible but there's only going to be a small group of people that really knows what it says amen all right and you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free now listen if we know the truth and it's in the Bible what's written in the Bible if we know that's truth and we do it then it promised us to set us free not bind us set us free and that word no means to perceive or understand get a knowledge of feel understand perceive have knowledge you have to understand it's a Jewish idiom for sexual intercourse between a man and a woman a woman knows a man I know no man she said Jesus said depart from me I never knew you that word knew is exactly right there I never had a personal relationship now Jesus Christ does not have nothing to do with sex act so so for those that are new I want you to understand one thing that is a that is an example that the Lord does Make Love To Us through agape love not filial love amen and it's not in the womb anywhere else but in mind your mind the womb of our mind is where we have our relationship with Jesus Christ with the control tower is where we have that relationship to become acquainted with to know to the Greeks it's meant to know facts but these facts may or may not affect one's conduct now this one will the one I know the person I know it will impact my conduct or affect my conduct to the Jew true knowledge always manifested itself in one's conduct one did not know something until that fact had a practical out working in his life Proverbs 3 verse 13 says happy is the man that findeth wisdom and the man that geteth understanding for the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver and the gain therefore then find gold wow now see that's totally opposite we're we we would I'm sorry we're humans if it says silver and gold we'd want it just go ahead and I'm gonna just say it for you yeah the Bible says to try for wisdom and understanding and it will be greater or better than having silver and gold in your hand because you know what with wisdom and understanding of God you can't go to hell but with a handful of silver and a handful of gold you can right and you will remember the Rich Young Ruler he said I lived all Ten Commandments Lord and in another place I Built Barns because I didn't have enough Barns and I put stuff over here and I put stuff over here where'd he end up in hell she she is more precious now now you see what you see what the writer is telling us in Proverbs we know it's Solomon he takes that wisdom to understanding and makes it into a she now who is she she's him she's the bride she is more precious the bride is more precious than rubies and all the things thou cast desire not to be compared to this bride Length of days is in her right hand and her left hand riches an honor her ways are ways of pleasantness and all her pastor peace she is a tree of life what a promise she is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her and happy as everyone that retaineth her Philippians 1 9. you know I read that scripture and I think you remember when when the the ark was stolen and the Philistines took it and put it over in their um Tabernacle or whatever you want to call it Dagon or whatever it was they put the thing there and the next day they come back and Dagon was you know knocked down on the ground and they picked that great big statue up they say well maybe somebody knocked it over or maybe a mule come through here or a bull and they pushed it up well after about the third time they you know what they do what they say get this thing out of here get this thing out of here and that's what people you'll do to people right remember my little thing that brother dick gave me my spirit irritates your demons only brother dick could come up with that and this I practice your love may abound age and then what all judgment and then we come to Corinthians we talked about it Sunday where the Saints will judge the world and then the Saints will judge Angels how much more are things that pertaining to this life we shouldn't have to go outside these walls to settle a legal dispute between two brothers or two sisters or whatever we you know it should be done right here we should be able to be able to judge that if then you have Judgment of things pertaining to this life set them to judge who are at least sustained in church he's even telling Paul said look don't let the don't let the guy that you know don't let the deacon do it take it to the guy that don't know much just start it and let him do it that's what he says right here set them to judge who are least esteemed in the church wow that's putting God on display is what it's doing God's proven who he is if you've got a born-again Christian he's proven who he is brother Brown said knowledge now that don't mean worldly knowledge because that's foolishness to God but knowledge to judge everything has to do with judge with judging all right but when you can see the scripture is not contradictory that you can say that and conceive by the revelation of God the whole word is wrote in Mysteries and only the knowledge of God can reveal it that's why the Bible says you can't understand who Jesus Christ is without the Holy Ghost because that's that guy in your control tower that's gonna what he's going to bring you back to that Center to that tie post because listen we fail every day we backslide we go out brother white brother Brown Say the only way Satan can get to you is what you go out to his ground you stay hid behind the word of God he can't get to you let's try that sometime really we we've come to a place let's think about this the other day we've come to a place that and we do have a lot of knowledge and we do have a lot of and it has to be head knowledge first all right it's got to come ahead of knowledge first all right you got to run it through the filter you got to run it through the gray matter you got to run it through all them firing mechanisms and all that stuff that's going off you know and stuff putting over here and moving over here you got to remember what God Said in the word of God you got to be able to see it um but to discern we'll talk about in just a minute to discern a Christian is just born again not more than you know a month or two they start discerning from the spirit and the soul because what happens is you've got it all together then what happens is the word is a discerner of the thoughts and Tents of the intents of the heart it starts pulling it apart and were you never in your life thought things so different you're at awe when God gives you a revelation how many how many of you were trinitarians before you came to the message okay he was almost well sister Anna was so sorry you're not now I said was was is a good word she was but you had that ingrained in your Spirit Realm and if you weren't born again at the time your soul was happy with that I was happy to sit in the Baptist Church I was happy to sit in the Presbyterian Church I was happy to sit in my own church most of the time that's where I was the Churchill weighed down well praise God I'm just the only one that's been the center of my life I guess but the knowledge of God reveals starts pulling that thing apart don't you remember the day when you first saw water baptism when you first saw there was no eternal hell when you first saw there was one God not three when you saw that now what did you have in your mind before in your human mind in the spirit realm you had this three gods right but when God revealed it to you it took that part of your memory listen you can still remember why you were in the Baptist Church and I still remember the things I did and all the uh in the world and all that but it's beginning to dull it's beginning to dull away time is beginning to move I think by the word of Lord of the Lord too it's it's starting to wash us because we're supposed to be washed by the word of the word we're supposed to have the mind of Christ and we're supposed to be yeah we can't help the thoughts come but we can what not let it Nest well we used to let it Nest we used to let build a condominium everybody with me well I mean it built condominium had flowers and trees and all that stuff yeah that's how our yeah that's how them thoughts were but now they come as a breeze and they blow away you say a sinner can't see that a center cannot you couldn't fathom that when somebody was doing top fire bush bless his heart he'd say boy Jenny you know who you he said boy we waiting on you I ain't going if you're not going and I can't go till you go he said so hurry up well you know what that didn't to me that just went after a while I mean the impact of his great big hand doing that and point that finger about that big around at you foreign that was an impact but after a while though Jenny it was like you know weeks or so later I just went right back it didn't bother me and you know it just but he did that one time when I was born again had a different impact my firing mechanism had changed a little bit my spiritual eye had been opened my spiritual ear had been opened to know that that was God been speaking to me the whole time through that man the whole time speaking to me through that person but it took what the eyes of our understanding have been what enlightened so that we can understand these things now brother Brown said look then when you get and say and punctuate every word of God with an amen then add that to your faith then here's the prayer I love this prayer Build Me Up O Lord into this let Christ be my head that works through me on my Foundation my faith is in him let virtue in all his temper's places Godless brotherly kind of working Me O Lord is my prayer I don't care live or die how many you can say that live or die sneak or Swim I'm gonna make a rapture man I don't care you're not gonna stop me there ain't nobody gonna stop me but me so then what you know look if look if nobody can stop me but me where's the devil in that picture for God has set in a church apostle Paul Angeles to press play all for the Lord all for the perfecting and bringing all this prayer now that was quoted by their higher up that was quoted by their number one guy okay so we'll just leave them alone but I'm going to tell you something that's of the devil you can't do that and stay in the word of God you can't you just pray for them and just you leave them people alone all right each one of these stones are Material off of that one this is Material off of this each one of these virtues belong into him and they're pouring out of him where and do you down through them 70 weeks of Daniel I love this and I and I've been uh honing in on this Spirit of wisdom because it takes the spirit of wisdom to do all kinds of things takes the spirit of wisdom to get a sermon that that y'all won't it's not the one I want one y'all want you operate the gift you make the gift work I don't you do so the spirit of wisdom comes look it didn't say it comes into the preacher it said comes into the church to make known to the church or the bride by the revelation of the Holy Ghost bringing the church in and revealing what they were living in just the same as Gabriel came to Daniel the Holy Spirit comes to the what comes to the church in the last days to reveal these great deep secret things praise God we can understand them if you want to because when we say deep people just go don't do that don't do that when we say deep God told us through a prophet and in the Bible it even tells us that we can know even the Deep things of God because the Deep things of God is so shallow if you're a Christian if you'll get taught if you'll learn if you'll sit and do what God Said to do remember to get these virtues is one thing that's doing what God Said do be an obedience to what God Said to do right there shall come forth it Rod out of the stem of Jesse talking about Jesus Christ and the spirit of the Lord shall rest upon Him Spirit of wisdom and understanding in the spirit of counsel that's why that spirit's come back into the church to get us out of here you know what Spirit of wisdom we have now we have the spirit of wisdom of the son of man we don't have partial truth we have full truth we don't have to worry about being right or wrong I hope you all know that if you're sitting here today worried whether this is the right message or the wrong message go go find you a tree somewhere and get under it and stay there until God brings you a revelation because there's nothing like this message of the hour nothing it lights you up it'll turn your refrigerator into a stove some of y'all still got icicles let the god of our Lord Jesus the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom for him the eyes are look there here it is the eyes of your understanding yours being enlightened that you may know what is that word know that you may have an intimate relationship with Jesus Christ what is the hope of his calling what the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the Saints I'm not going to get finished so I'm going to skip through just close your eyes because some of these people may make you sick when I start scrolling there's nothing of such prevailing power is a revelation of the word of God listen we want power in this church get a revelation of the word of God get a revelation of where you at give a revelation get a revelation of why you're doing here why are you here why are we here why are in the things we're doing why are you doing this why are we doing that there's nothing of such what is prevailing power now you can have power but what is prevailing power see you can have a lightning bolt and that's power but prevailing power is this is prevailing power as long as you keep them up that power will prevail over everything else and stay on so listen let's get our switch flipped right that's already the power's running through them lines right now it's just not got the right connection yet and you know where it's at it's not back there it's right here right here this is where it's at watch oh look at there that's why God wants to make it so simple when we make it so hard so simple as flipping a light switch power's already there revelation of Jesus Christ listen but the prevailing overcoming church is built on Revelation so we can expect God look we can expect God to reveal his truth to us that's a prophet telling us it he expects God to do this and so do we because it's the word of God any promise in the word of God Is Ours so we can expect God to reveal his truth to us however you actually don't need a revelation on water baptism it's right there staring you in the face I bet you let me see when that was that was in when he preached those 60 or 61 because I don't have a dog I cut it off it was the revelation of Jesus Christ of little bitty books there was a lot of trinitarians sitting in that congregation at that time a lot and he just burnt her hide right in front of him he said this is right here staring you in the face no man knows the things of God save the spirit of God and He To Whom the spirit of God reveals them brother Ryan said we need to call on God for Revelation more than anything else in the world or Brother Ray by the way I need this I need this pray for revelation if you have a problem pray for revelation if you have an issue pray for revelation more than anything else in the world you have accepted the Bible we have accepted the great truths of it we got all the truths down but it still is not real to most people because the Revelation by the spirit is not there it's words on a page we're a message believer well what message do you believe well I don't believe brother Ram was right over here but he was right over here I don't believe this is right over here I don't believe brother so and so right and it's not right and that's a boy it's like Paul Harvey said one time I was talking about brother about this message being a cult he said he said no I said the message is not a cult a cult they follow their leader just saying look what God's I mean look what God's give us in the end time and what Satan's doing he's going right to the top he's going to tear it down make us make us doubt whether the 12 people fell off the bridge I don't care yeah but he was supposed to be I don't care he has brought me a Clarity to the word of God more than any other man James Dobson all them people included and that's what I'll put my soul on on that because that man can make a mistake but that God can't somebody said one time said I'll believe I I would believe brother branham's opinion rather than most people's Revelation right that's about true but look we'll close right here I don't have time to get any further but this is talking about you he says because the Revelation this layer the word has weakened mechanics Dynamics all right the Bible says in second Corinthians 5 21 that we have become the righteousness of God by our Union with Jesus Christ now that's that Center guy right there that Union is in that middle realm called the soul it's did you get it it says that we are the very righteousness of God himself by being in Christ it says that he Jesus became sin for us it does not say he became sinful but he became sin for us that by our Union with him by what by knowing him by knowing him the people that know their God will do exploit if we accept the fact and we must that he literally became sin for us by his substitution for us then we must also accept the fact that we buy our Union with him have become the very righteousness of God to reject one is to reject the other to accept one is to accept the other which one do you want to accept tonight amen you think about it now we know the Bible says that it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing that's the prophet it is not real to the majority look it's not real to the majority of God's children not the devil's kids you know what he's talking about he's talking about a further walk with God he's talking about okay you're born again you're in the family of God you're in the line of adoption you're just not going anywhere you're malnourished you quit eating you quit fellowshipping you don't come to church you don't do you don't read your Bible you don't study how you gonna get something from God okay it can't be denied but the revelation of it is missing it is not real to the majority of God's children it is just a good verse in the Bible are a good quote but we need to have it made alive to us that will take revelation what is a revelation somebody you know what's your idea of a revelation to me it's like that aha moment you have you you just didn't see something all of a sudden it was there all the time you know I love math and man I mean you could there was there would be a piece left out or something and you couldn't understand it but once that piece of the puzzle or once you've got to your A's and B's and C's and and uh I know shake your head it's okay yeah no we're not no boy boys wanted to play an instrument he said oh that's not it when you get to a plus b and then all the squares and somebody told me the other day what I was missing who was that told me that Adam was it you or or Levi when I was talking about a number that just kept repeating itself that it never wasn't it didn't have a definition it's pi what is it and it just keeps going there's no end to it well that's not God in that aspect because they just using that is you know it fits but it don't fit everything so now it's your confused we'll move right along for everyone that uses milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he's a baby can't understand a plus b equals c but once I got to that part of a I told you many times what helped me was my uh college football I mean baseball coach he would give us the answer and we had to back it into we had to make the not the question but we had to put all the numbers in to get to that and that was hard it's hard enough getting everything together and then getting the answer but when he wrote The Answer up on the board and you had to create the problem that was a problem that's why it was called that but strong meat belongs to them that are of what a full age even those who by look by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both Good and Evil to discern means to separate make a distinction discriminate or to prefer we're Discerning right now you're Discerning God's Discerning your thoughts and intents he's taken me down one road that you need and he's taking me down another road somebody else needs he's taken you to when the brother comes up here and preaches that you've never met before and he preaches like you swear he was in your house last night how'd you know that well it wasn't him it was the discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart brother Branham had it in a great gift worldwide we have it in little bitty gift discernment has not left the church but now that part of the discernment one gift to one generation brother Brown said when you can bring that person up here discern it 100 and do it not two or three times do it hundreds of thousands of times see now it happens hundreds of thousands of times all over the world it's not in one person it's all over the world that discernment and I wrote myself a note teach us because watch this preach the word be instant in season out of season magicians get ready to come reprove rebuke it start with all go ahead and actually come on with long all long-suffering and Doctrine for the time will come when they will tell you to press play when they will not endure sound Doctrine but after their own lust shall they Heap to themselves look Heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from what the truth and shall be turned into Fables II Peter 2 1 but there were false prophets among the people even as there shall be false teachers among you who privately shall bring indomitable heresies even denying the Lord that bought them and brought unto them Swift destruction and many shall follow their pernicious ways pernicious is the same word as prediction Judas was the son of what Perdition confusion destruction all right so it will follow in their destructive Ways by reason of whom the way of truth shall be evil spoken of wow be in the message and talk evil of the messenger how in the world can you do that let's stand our feet Hebrews 5 11 says of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing you are dull of hearing that word dull is slothful slow sluggish indolent dull and languid it's just like for a win for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God you know what the first principle of the Oracle of God is the Ten Commandments that's what the Jews had you know what Paul's saying Paul's saying please get up here in the in the New Testament but it looks like all you need is you need to be taught the simple things of the Ten Commandments first that's a good place to start but let's don't stay there you do not have to tell anybody in this building I hope not that thou shalt not kill okay our commit adultery are all the other one of The Commandments we shouldn't have to preach about that all the time but he said Paul said you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the Oracles of God and our become such as have need of milk and not of strong meat let me read this real quick having a form of godliness so there's people going to have a form of godliness but deny what deny what I was talking about not deny that there's a Bible not deny the tears of God not deny that there's a prophet not deny that there's a message but you deny the power of it you deny the power of it from such I'm gonna I'm gonna interject or interplay from such run away not turn away run away it will do you no good look for this sort are they which creep in the houses leading captive silly churches women in the churches right Laden with sins LED away with many lust ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth last one let us hold fast to profession of our faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised him and let us consider one another to provoke and to love and good works not for say who put that in there again not forsaking the ascending of ourselves together as a matter of some is but look exhorting one another and so much more as you see the day approaching for if we sin willfully now look and we'll say this one more time when if a preacher preaches something and it's the truth and he preaches it and presents it to you in ABC like this right here you need to be in church every time the door is open for if you sin willfully after you have received that knowledge there's no more sacrifice for your sins I'm just reading you the Bible we wonder why we're tossed about it's because we're going to do everything God says instead of brother brother they'll preached matching pieces years ago we got missing pieces not me too that's why he preached matching pieces because when what matches down here matches up there they're going to connect remember it vulcanized but he can't be Rubber and Bricks it's got to be rubber to rubber vulcanized together now remember this Christ in the true church is a continuation of the book of Acts but the Book of Revelation shows how that the Antichrist Spirit would come into the church look defile it make it lukewarm formal and Powerless that doesn't sound like the word I'm used to it exposes Satan revealing his work the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word and let me interject something and God's people and God's prophet right down to the time he is casting the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army if they get a true Revelation what of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church not that church out there this church right here within the framework of the Christian church and by God's spirit discern by knowledge knowledge that's why that knowledge is sold down at the bottom here at the pyramid we've got to have that we've got to have knowledge and we stand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be what say that with me powerless before her one more time powerless before her he will be as definitely thwarted today is when Christ withstood his every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it with a true Revelation in our lives the gates of hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them let's sing a song [Music] oh to Jesus I Surrender to hear my freely give and trust him in his
