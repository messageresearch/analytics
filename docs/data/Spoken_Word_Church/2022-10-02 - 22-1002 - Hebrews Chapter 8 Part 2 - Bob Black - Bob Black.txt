========================================

house of the Lord amen you love going to church this morning come expect it we're going through Hebrews eight let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we get into our studies Lord we're so grateful to be able to gather together this morning Lord and we just ask the Lord that you'll fill our fill our bowls full today Lord and we just Lord as we meditate upon your scriptures Lord we come Lord with needy hearts and we just ask Lord that you'll give us what we have need of granted Lord as we impact these words the the words of Paul orders we're studying these things out Lord that you'll help us to understand in your name amen so Paul was saying uh after he and you know Hebrews chapter 7 he was laying out who Melchizedek was and and uh and talking about those things and so he begins in Hebrews chapter 8. as we kind of looked at a little bit last last Sunday he says now of the things which we have spoke spoken this is the sum we have such an high priest who has said on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens a minister of the sanctuary and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man and in Hebrews 9 just to compare with that scripture he said for Christ has not entered into the holy places made with hands which are the figures of the true but into heaven itself now to appear in the presence of God for us and you think about after Christ died on the cross that he was able to go to go past the veil of his flesh into heaven to present the the atonement that he had made to say it everything that everything that was typed on Earth in the Old Testament now has been accomplished when the high priest and the Old Testament would go once a year to sprinkle the blood on the on the uh The Mercy Seat all of those things were signifying that something was going to come the true atonement that would be once for all that our our spiritual high priest Melchizedek God come down in flesh would come once for all to pay the price and so he entered in and entered into heaven itself to prove that the price was paid so if we if we kind of examine that and I and I apologize I'm trying to get better about my small font but uh so I know this was a lot crammed in but just just listen on this slide and then we'll some of the other slides uh Lord willing will be a better a better sized font oh so his blood you think about what his blood did for us his blood that that he entered into heaven itself to prove that the price was paid for us his blood was the entrance fee to Heaven his blood paid the price for us to go to heaven his blood was the cleansing agent it cleaned cleaned us out so that so that you think we were um on the way to church this morning uh sometimes my wife will read a scripture and she was just reading through the book of Acts about all the things that Paul had done and you think about a man like that that had actually gone into people's houses and Drug them out grabbed them by their coat and Drug them to be and and and and and said I want these people to be killed but yet the blood of Jesus Christ was sufficient to clean all of that and you saw the blood his blood was the cleaning agent to clean all of our past stuff are passed off his blood sealed and ratified the New Covenant what's the New Covenant that the Life of Christ would pay for our sins so that his life could come and dwell on the new in the believer's heart his blood took care of the sin issue once for all and that's in Hebrews 10 and and uh all these different verses in Hebrews 10 his blood brought bought us Eternal Redemption it was the exchange that took our sin and bestowed on us his righteousness his blood made peace with God and that's really what the if the point Paul is trying to make that he's the mediator of this New Covenant the me what is a mediator or somebody that's that's to to bridge the gap and to also say that all these things that have been promised are going to be fulfilled so Christ came to say to to say that all these things that are written about in the Old Testament are going to be fulfilled in in in Christ and into the life of the believer his blood made peace with God his blood undid everything that sin and death ever took ruined or stained his blood gives us confidence to approach God boldly by faith if you have if you if you recognize by faith what God did for you then you it gives you confidence to come to him boldly for whatever your petition is whatever his word says that you have access to his his blood paid the price for that so Paul goes on to say then verse 3 he said for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest seeing that there are priests that offer gifts according to the law who serve unto the example and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle foresee saith he that thou make all things according to the pattern show to thee and the mouth so what what gifts did this man give he gave his blood he gave his life he gives his life in you and the gift of the Holy Ghost that's the gift that this man gives but uh uh an Earthly priest would would have gifts of things to to offer but this man had his blood to offer in verse six he said but now hath he obtained a more excellent Ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better Covenant which was established upon better promises for if that first Covenant had been faultlessed then that then should no place have been sought for the second for finding fault with him he saith behold the days come saith the Lord when I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah and we've kind of been examining what that New Covenant that that God's life that he would give his life for us that his life could be could be could live in The Believer the rest of the the rest of of Chapter eight he's actually quoting Jeremiah and we kind of read that last last Sunday said for finding fault with him he saith behold the days come saith the Lord of all my I will I will make a New Covenant with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah not according to the Covenant that I made with their fathers in the day when I took them out of hand to lead them out of the land of Egypt because they continue not in my Covenant and I regarded them not saith the Lord for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days saith the Lord I will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people you know that's kind of something I kind of wanted to sit on for a little bit in this in this lesson because we think you know Christ Christ paid the price for us and he made a way for us but the way the the way that he made is for us to be changed there's going to be an effect in our lives if you if you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ he died to put all those Old Testament laws to put the effect the essence of those laws Into the Heart of the believer so that they could be lived out so he said to Jeremiah he's quoting Jeremiah and they shall not teach every man his neighbor and every man his brother is saying know the Lord For All Shall know me from the least to the greatest for I will be merciful to their unrighteousness and their sins and iniquities will I remember no more so what Christ did when he died on the cross was he fulfilled the law what fulfilled fulfilled means is is if we could just think about that there's a lot of things that were prophesied and spoken of in the Old Testament there the fulfilled in a lot of different ways there's there's there's things in the Old Testament that um we're looking forward to the day that we're living in like Ezekiel 36 that I'll give you I'll soften up your heart and give you a new spirit and and then give you my spirit that's that's looking to our day there's things that were speaking of Jesus that a virgin shall conceive and how he was going to come and where he would be born in Bethlehem and those kind of things that the atonement will be made so Christ he fulfilled he fulfilled that that there was an atonement going to be made but yet there's there's part of that there's there's things left for you and I to fulfill as well that's why we were we were speaking on as you see the revelation of Jesus Christ unfold you can't help but see the Revelation you're part of that Revelation unfold as well because if you're part of him you got you've got something to do as well that's what you know really what the new test the Old and New Testament is the Old Testament taking that that law the law written on stones and the New Testament put it in the believer's heart so what what it looks like is if you really under get the true understanding of the Old Testament the Old Testament was fulfilled in Jesus Christ and the New Testament is fulfilled in his bride so now you got a picture of the Old Testament as as the groom and the New Testament is the bride and you've got that now you've got a picture a love story coming together so so what uh you know what we were kind of getting in last last time about how the the law the really to really fulfill the law it's it's fulfilled in love well you've got a love story that's being unfolded here you got a love story where Christ died on the cross so that he's bright so that he could be married to his bride so that he could call his bride to himself two two Wings two wings that are are kind of spread out what what really is a picture of a of a bride and a a bride in his in his groom so you think about what the law the Law's got to be fulfilled everything's got to be fulfilled and so now let's take a little quick detour let's go on a rabbit Trail like we did last Sunday and talk about Jesus fulfilled the law but now the bride's going to fulfill the law too how she's going to how she's going to fulfill the law by becoming what the essence of what God wanted us to be how to love your neighbor and to forgive others and to to to be able to love people the way that God wanted to love somebody that hates you so uh and when Jesus was preaching The Sermon on the Mount he said let your light so shine before men that they may see your good works and glorify your father which is in heaven think not that I am come to destroy the law of the prophets I am not come to destroy but to fulfill he's not coming to just scrap it to do away with it but to actually manifest what the law was speaking of for verily I say unto you till Heaven and Earth pass one jot or one Tittle shell and no wise past from the law till all be fulfilled so the whole body of text has to be fulfilled in somebody somebody's going to live it now Jesus Christ was the living when he when he opened up the scroll and read there in Isaiah and identified himself with the scripture he was the living manifestation of what he was reading there so when you read in the Bible and you're you're you also are the living manifestation of the words that you're reading on the page come off the page into living reality so it's all going to be fulfilled and you're fulfilling it as well to fulfill means if you look in Strong's Concordance it says to cause God's will as made known in the law to be obeyed as it should be I see you in the Old Testament they couldn't they couldn't live out the law they I mean they tried to but but the difference is when you got God inside of you God actually living it out it in the essence of what the law means it can can be fulfilled in the way it should be that's that's what it means to fulfill and the Oxford languages it says to bring to completion or reality to achieve or realize something desired promised or predicted you see how there's this idea that um called antinomialism that Martin Luther that's a big word but Martin Luther and John Wesley and all them fought against this idea that when Christ died on the cross that we don't have to live out like the Ten Commandments that there's this idea that people down Through the Ages have have have kind of they've they've thought that well when I since I'm a Christian I don't have to live according to the law anymore I don't have to I can just throw away Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal I have a right maybe to do things in secret but the blood is Jesus Christ just covers it over but you see you don't have to do anything to come to Christ but when you do come to Christ that law will take effect in your members and it will begin to change your thinking and change your doing and change change the way that you work so that you you won't steal and you won't you won't uh do those things there's going to be an effect of coming to Christ that's why Romans says for what the law could not do and that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemn sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit that's what the Holy Ghost was sent for to fulfill the law in you for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for it is not subject to the law of God you mean we got to be subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his now you think about being subject to the law of God but if you go back and read what what the law this is the this just a sample of the 16 613 uh laws that are that are in the mid-site that the probably not pronouncing that right but to know there is a God to have no other gods to know that God is one to love God thank you to fear God and these are all the all the things that are in The Loft they just they just scroll up not not to profane his name see you when you're baptized with the Holy Ghost and this becomes real that you can really do these things to listen and stop scrolling on me to listen to the true prophet well we'll just keep going but see I was just trying to highlight an example that that God he wrote all these things down and in the New Testament the essence of those things in the Old Testament are being fulfilled in US he said and Paul said in in in verse 13 He said in that he saith a New Covenant he hath made the first old now that now that which to caith and waxeth old is ready to vanish away so Paul said in second Corinthians who also have made us able Ministers of the New Testament not of the letter not like the letter of the things that we read all these things that we have to adhere to like washing pots and things but of the spirit the essence of the things that are in the Old Testament the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life but if the ministration of death written and Engraving in Stones was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was to be done away how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious so all of those things that were typed in the old tester are now being fulfilled in Us by the Holy Ghost so Christ's sacrifice met every requirement of the law with the Life of Christ and the believer will be a living manifestation of the essence of the law in Mark chapter 12 Jesus said the first of all the Commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and the second is like this namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these in Romans chapter 13 He said oh no man anything but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law now you think that if true love is Manifest in the life of a Believer then the whole law is is can be summed up in the Fulfillment of that for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law that's a weighty statement that love fulfills the whole law in Galatians chapter 5 he said for Brethren you have been called into Liberty only used not Liberty for an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another for all the law is fulfilled in one word even in this Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself and in James chapter 2 if ye fulfill the Royal law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well you see we're living in the age though where love has been redefined into something that doesn't match what the scripture is we think we use we use when you start talking about love we use it as an occasion to say well I'm not being treated right but if we'll take what the Bible says and examine ourselves and try to match up with that then we can really we'll really see what the essence of What Love Is Love Is Love is to not put yourself above somebody else to always be looking for the other person's benefit to try to reach out to try to be to try to be a to be inclined to see the other person come to Salvation because that's that's where our goal is to to give others eternal life and this age that we're living in has Twisted love around to where you know either even children they don't When Love is being shown to your children you know sometimes they'll say well you don't love me but love is the definition of what love is has been twisted around so that when you try to show love it's well you don't really love me but love love is love is like a where the Bible talks about the prophets would rise up early in the morning and and try to tell people the truth and rebuke rebuke with long suffering because love love wants the best for you love I I maybe maybe just meditate on these things as we as we go through these scriptures and think about what love is hereby we perceive the love of God because he laid down his life for us and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren but we need when he died on the cross for for all the Israelites and back then they didn't recognize his love that he was showing to him whoso had this world's good and see if his brother have need and shoveth up his bowels of compassion from him how dwelleth the love of God in him my little children let us not love and word neither in tongue but in deed in truth and then first John chapter 5 he said whosoever believeth that Jesus is the Christ is born of God and everyone that loveth him that begat loveth him also that is begotten of him and by this we know that the love of children of God that we love the children of God when we love God and keep his Commandments for this is the love of God that we keep his Commandments and his Commandments are not Grievous so there's how you know if you love God if you love his word if you love God you'll keep his Commandments because if you love God and that then you're if the love of Christ is in you then you will have a desire to fulfill the law to fulfill the essence of God's word to walk in his word foreign so what some examples of love in the Bible in First Corinthians chapter 10 Paul said let no man seek his own but every man another's wealth everybody when you want to seek seek the the benefit of others instead of your own Hebrews chapter 13 says be not forgetful to entertain strangers for thereby some of entertained angels unaware so so there's love is being expressed in hospitality why because you're trying to get people to Christ remember them that are in bonds as bound with them that's why we have the prayer requests every morning because we're remembering those that are that that are in you know have infirmities and and uh in in bonds of their mind and suffering because the devil's got them in prison in a prison house and them which suffer adversity as being yourselves also in the body marriage is Honorable and all in the bed undefiled but whoremongers and adulterers God will judge let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things as you have love is just being content and not comparing yourselves with others and I I you know I like to quote that that say in it comparison is the thief of Joy because when you start when you're not content and you can't start comparing yourself with other than others and that's the devil will take your joy away but just just just be happy with what you've got Philippians chapter 2 says let nothing be done through Strife or vainglory but in lowliness of Mind Let each esteem other better than themselves look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others because we want to help one another help one another to to grow up the stature of a perfect man so Lo Romans Romans 13 said that love is the fulfilling of the law brother Ram said in the brass serpent he said God has a law and that law is love then if I love God correctly that I'm going to testify the truth about God if I'm in love with him I've got a wife's here in this building now see what what is it what's this got to do with Hebrews because I was as I talked about in the beginning the Old Testament is the groom and the New Testament it's his wife so it's really a love story so if you love God in the right way God God doesn't have like he's he's trying to make this paint this picture of you don't have to his his wife didn't have to tell him you better not you know sleep around with some women when you're overseas you better not do all this kind of stuff when when it's a picture of love then that everything works in Harmony when you really love one another then you don't have to worry brother said I've got a wife's here in this building God knows how I love her well you know everything good and everything good and everything is going to be for my wife you know that sure just like your husband would be to you now well now if we love God then my confidence becomes perfect in him as I love him and so if you love God and you know that he loves you because you because you can see in his word all these promises that are laying there waiting to be fulfilled then you can have confidence to come boldly to his throne knowing that we've got a high priest and all these promises that Paul laid out for us because we're in love with him and that gives us confidence that he's going to be there for you whatever whatever life throws at you whatever the devil throws at you because it's love love is what gives confidence now he can't break that law of Love see because it's in my heart so now that means that even when you fall and make mistakes you've got a love relationship you you're in love with God and you know he loves you you have confidence that he'll forgive you of your sins so Paul goes on in verse in verse 1 of of chapter nine he said then verily the first Covenant had also ordinances of divine service and a worldly sanctuary for there was a tabernacle maybe the first wearing was the Candlestick and the table and the showbread which is called the sanctuary and after the second Veil The Tabernacle which is called the holiest of all which had the golden sensor in the heart of the Covenant Ark of the Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold wherein was the golden pop it had Manna and Aaron's raw that budded and the tables of the Covenant and over at the cherubims of Glory Shadow and The Mercy Seat of which we cannot now speak particularly he's talking about all these things where shadow of the reality that we have access to now that is being fulfilled in our lives all of these things the golden sensor and the pot of manna and Aaron's raw that budded were symbols of the Christ Living in us to fulfill his word because in verse 8 he said the Holy Ghost is signifying that the way into the all of those things are represented the Holy Ghost that the way into the holy holiest was not yet made manifest while as the first Tabernacle was yet standing which was a figure for the time then present in which we're offered both gifts and sacrifices that could not make him that did the service perfect as pertaining to the conscience but Christ being coming high priest of good things to come by greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us this is blood that paid the price for the blood of bulls and ghosts and the ashes of an heifer sprinkling the unclean sanctify to the purifying of the of the flesh how much more shall the blood of Christ who Purge who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead works to serve the Living God to serve the Living God he wanted he wants to change us from you know what dead Works dead works is looking at those Old Testament rules Old Testament laws is like rules and regulations you have to follow without your heart being changed something that you look at and say well if I can just act this out and and just be a good pharisaical actor then you met the requirements and we'll we'll we'll we'll close on this in Mark chapter 7 he said he answered and said unto them well I thought well hath Isaiah prophesied of you Hypocrites and as as it is written this people honored me with their lips but their heart is far from me I'll be it in vain do they worship me they were worshiping according to what they thought the law required by you know doing things just with an outwardly appearance and washing pots and you know he said teaching for Doctrine is the Commandments of men for laying aside the Commandment of God you hold the tradition of men as the washing of pots and cups and many other such things like you do and he said unto them full well you reject the Commandment of God that you may keep your own tradition and in Matthew chapter 23 as the musicians come forward he said woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make clean the outside of the coupling of the platter but within they are full of extortion and excess without blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cuff and platter that the outside of them may be clean also God wants to change our conscience our thinking from dead Works to a living reality filled by the Holy Ghost quickened so that the law is actually being manifest in our members and how is it may manifest through love because love is the fulfilling of the law when you love God through the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you love one another you're actually fulfilling all the old things that were prophesied in the New Testament and you become a living walking Testament of those things that they can only probe a little stop there God bless you [Applause] [Music]
