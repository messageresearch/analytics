[3:30] amen God bless you let's see Revel see
[3:34] Revelations now we got it back to the
[3:36] white we got white screen now so
[3:39] Revelations 1:10 says I was in the
[3:41] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[3:42] behind me a great voice as of a trumpet
[3:44] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[3:46] and the last what thou seest right in
[3:48] the book and send it to the seven
[3:50] churches which are in Asia ephus Mna
[3:52] pergamus th Sardis Philadelphia latosa
[3:56] now what John toped the bride
[3:58] right so God told him to write this in
[4:01] the book and send it to the bride yes so
[4:03] he sent this to me and you this is ours
[4:06] this and you say well I wasn't in
[4:08] Ephesus or yeah you were the same Holy
[4:11] Spirit you got inside of you is the same
[4:12] one that's inside of those people in
[4:14] Ephesus smrna perus Tara it just that
[4:17] that was a different word not a
[4:19] different different word but a different
[4:21] part of the word that they fulfill
[4:23] versus what you're fulfilling but today
[4:25] we got to fulfill it all seven course
[4:28] meal you've heard many times before
[4:29] seven we've got all Seven Ages we've got
[4:32] all the all the accolades and all the
[4:35] all the bad stuff too so um you know God
[4:38] hates as he he hates this this last age
[4:41] he hates the people that are uh lukewarm
[4:44] that that are not as brother Ryan was
[4:46] saying that don't have a passion to uh
[4:48] to come to church anymore it's just like
[4:50] well if I get here one time then I'm all
[4:52] right I don't have to come back again
[4:54] but I don't know brother Claud always
[4:56] told me one time and I agree you preach
[4:59] to everybody on Sunday morning people
[5:00] come in they think they come to church
[5:02] you know just because they're going to
[5:03] church but you're really preaching to
[5:04] the real true ones that want to hear the
[5:07] second service so we going to hear
[5:08] something today CU you came back praise
[5:10] the Lord I glad you didn't come to see
[5:12] me
[5:13] but you didn't have to say
[5:16] Amen who said
[5:19] that sister Trudy the one that's got the
[5:21] head her head
[5:25] down and y'all laughed you should have
[5:28] rebuked her and you're laughing that's
[5:31] all right sister you just said what
[5:33] everybody else was thinking in their
[5:34] mind and I turned to see the voice that
[5:36] SP to me and behold I turned and saw
[5:38] seven golden candlesticks and in the
[5:40] midst of those candlesticks I saw one
[5:41] liken the son of man now look son of
[5:44] man that Revelation had not been given
[5:47] yet all right like Brother Richard was
[5:49] talking about Sunday that Revelation is
[5:52] only to the first age and the last age
[5:55] the son of man himself stood in the
[5:57] first part of the first age all right
[5:59] are the end of the Old Testament here we
[6:02] are standing at the end of the New
[6:04] Testament and that same son of man but
[6:06] he decided he was going to come as one
[6:08] person there but he decided down here he
[6:10] going to come in a many membered body
[6:12] all right in the fullness of the word
[6:14] and that's what we're that's why I love
[6:15] these last three ages and we'll read it
[6:18] not today but brother rown said these
[6:19] last three ages completes the birth see
[6:22] it starts with justification
[6:23] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[6:25] and then what and then the word coming
[6:28] forth at the Eagle age at to end time
[6:30] taking us out of here so he was clothed
[6:33] with a garment down to the foot and GED
[6:34] about the PS with a golden girdle which
[6:35] is feminis let's read this and then
[6:38] we'll sit down to the angel of the
[6:39] church in Sardis write these things
[6:41] sayith he that have the seven spirits of
[6:42] God God wants to reiterate he still got
[6:45] these things in control all right he's
[6:48] still in control of all these things and
[6:49] the Seven Stars I know the works that
[6:51] thou has a name that thou livest and art
[6:54] dead Be watchful and strengthen the
[6:56] things which remain that are ready to
[6:58] die for I have not found thy works
[6:59] perfect before God all right remember
[7:02] therefore how thou Hast received and
[7:04] heard and hold fast and repent if
[7:06] therefore Thou shalt not watch I will
[7:08] come as a thief in the night and thou
[7:11] shalt know not know what hour I will
[7:14] come upon thee remember all 10 virgins
[7:16] heard the
[7:18] voice to wake up all 10 right five did
[7:23] something different than the other five
[7:25] did though they all heard one voice
[7:27] we've all heard let's just put it this
[7:29] we've always we've all heard the voice
[7:31] of the seventh angel
[7:32] messenger but have he re have we really
[7:35] trimmed our lamp yes we have but have we
[7:38] really got the oil of the Holy Ghost to
[7:40] take us out of here that's something for
[7:42] you to think about cuz we'll talk about
[7:44] the outer Court in just a minute that's
[7:47] why I like these last three ages you can
[7:49] put it in the birth of of you and put it
[7:52] in the the birth of the of the world and
[7:54] all the different things so we'll look
[7:56] at in just a minute that's why brother B
[7:57] said the last three completes the birth
[7:59] it wasn't that they didn't listen one
[8:01] more time I'm not saying they did not
[8:03] have the new birth they had the new
[8:04] birth in every age every age had a dip
[8:08] in the Holy Ghost every age we're born
[8:11] again Christians going to be resurrected
[8:14] when we call them out of the Grave
[8:16] they're going to come right here and
[8:18] then we're going to go to Glory together
[8:20] and they're going to live in the city
[8:21] all seven Church ages but there was some
[8:23] that looked really bad and there was
[8:25] something that looked really good well
[8:26] this age is the worst it looked really
[8:29] really bad watch remember what brother R
[8:32] said about the if that second preview of
[8:34] The Bride had to
[8:35] come blind wretched miserable naked and
[8:38] don't know it but praise God he's
[8:40] brought us back to a place he said I
[8:44] will restore and he's restoring now he's
[8:46] continuing to restore he's bringing the
[8:48] word of God back I don't care if you
[8:50] don't see it that don't
[8:52] matter it's coming back it is
[8:56] back remember therefore how thou Hast
[8:59] received D and heard and hold fast and
[9:02] repent if therefore Thou shalt not watch
[9:04] I will come as a thief and thou shalt
[9:06] not know what hour I will come upon thee
[9:09] thou Hast a few names even in Sardis
[9:11] which have not defiled their garments
[9:12] and they shall walk with me in white for
[9:14] they are worthy he that overcometh the
[9:16] same shall be clothed in white rment and
[9:18] I will not blot out his name out of the
[9:20] book of life you know that we had a
[9:22] group that's blotted out of the book of
[9:23] life amen Judas Judas brother Bri his
[9:27] name was written on the book what not
[9:29] wasn't the Lamb's Book but it written in
[9:31] the Book of Life or Lamb's Book of Life
[9:32] but not the Eternal section but it was
[9:34] erased we don't want to go that far and
[9:37] get erased I don't like being erased I
[9:40] like me being erased but I don't I don't
[9:42] want to be erased in
[9:45] God I will not blot out his name out of
[9:47] the book of life but I will confess his
[9:49] name before my father can you confess
[9:51] that you're a Believer can you confess
[9:53] today that you're part of this message
[9:55] of the hour you're part of the bride and
[9:57] that brother random was the prophet
[9:58] messenger that were supposed to listen
[9:59] to not somebody else he that hath an ear
[10:03] let him hear what the spirit saith unto
[10:05] the churches you can be seated the Lord
[10:06] His blessings to the reading of the
[10:08] word now as we were talking this morning
[10:10] we'll we'll skip through a bunch as
[10:12] we're almost to the we're at the fifth
[10:14] Church age and we'll go back when we do
[10:17] the seals and talk about a little bit
[10:19] more but if you'll see that Paul irenius
[10:22] Martin Columba if you'll see the
[10:23] darkness continuing to creep through and
[10:26] then Columba then Luther is a little
[10:28] more coming out out a little more coming
[10:30] out Wesley and then remember though in
[10:32] this last
[10:34] age it's gross
[10:36] Darkness brother brandom said I put a
[10:38] little bit of that light in there he
[10:39] said the angel blacked it all the way
[10:42] out all right so guess what that little
[10:44] part of light is me and you all right
[10:47] that's why I identify every people like
[10:49] there was a brother the other day was we
[10:51] were talking about the church in Daniel
[10:52] 70 weeks and he said all that some man's
[10:54] CH I said praise
[10:56] God that some man was William brand he
[10:59] was a prophet of the end time that's all
[11:01] right with me that that he drew that and
[11:03] then the angel backed it up by drawing
[11:05] it on the Black by drawing it on the
[11:07] wall behind the Tabernacle all right so
[11:09] we know that it's been what it's been
[11:11] Vindicated this message has been
[11:13] Vindicated that it's true all right I
[11:16] don't need I don't need somebody else to
[11:18] tell me that it's been
[11:20] Vindicated and if it's been Vindicated
[11:22] guess what it's the word of God for the
[11:23] day and hour that I'm living in yes
[11:29] technology I don't know so
[11:33] much I'm
[11:37] stuck wait a minute I got
[11:40] it so we know all those churches every
[11:44] church that's why when when we look at
[11:47] the end at the beginning of the all of
[11:49] time in Adam and Eve Eve was what Eve
[11:52] was submissive she was supposed to be
[11:54] under her head but she began to come out
[11:57] from under her head and she became as a
[12:00] spirit of a dominating female because
[12:03] she wanted to know what the beasts
[12:05] wanted with her rather than what the
[12:08] headship of God did all right so that
[12:11] that and that if that's what killed us
[12:13] then the headship of the church is
[12:15] what's got to bring us back getting back
[12:17] under that headship of Christ knowing
[12:21] who he is knowing what he wants his we
[12:23] are his potentials as brother Randon was
[12:25] telling us but that dominating female
[12:27] that church is dominated listen we don't
[12:30] want a church to dominate us we want our
[12:33] headship Christ to dominate us and not
[12:36] dominate us with with a fist of iron but
[12:39] with what nail scarred hands right all
[12:41] right but that's what killed all those
[12:44] Church ages the dominating female took
[12:46] over and dominated the whole thing the
[12:47] church especially in the fourth Church
[12:49] age when she took over and she said this
[12:52] is it and that became informed the
[12:55] Catholic church and you had to listen or
[12:57] you die or you had to conform or you
[12:58] died all
[13:00] right but she that liveth in pleasure
[13:02] now watch well I've read this 10 times
[13:05] but listen she that liveth in
[13:09] pleasure not she this liveth in darkness
[13:12] and and you know uh homeless and under a
[13:15] under a um a
[13:17] bridge no she's living in pleasure she
[13:20] thinks she's building the best churches
[13:22] she's building the best organization
[13:24] she's she's you know writing the best
[13:26] books and she's giving the best TV
[13:29] programs and she's given all her best
[13:32] but she's dead without the word of God
[13:34] why brother R said many times I'd rather
[13:36] have the word of God eat soda crackers
[13:38] and drink water can you say that
[13:41] really that you'd rather have the word
[13:43] of God than the meal you're getting
[13:45] ready to eat in a few minutes or an hour
[13:46] or
[13:47] so I didn't think so you're know amen
[13:50] opening the first two
[13:53] seals it looses a Ministry so if if God
[13:56] looses a Ministry then Satan looses one
[13:58] right by behind him all right everybody
[14:00] with me on that so the what he loosed
[14:03] what God loosed in that first church age
[14:04] Satan looked and said man they're
[14:07] good I'm G to have to really be sharp I
[14:11] can't just act like I've been acting
[14:12] before I got to be real sharp I got to
[14:15] get in that church and not just look at
[14:17] it I got to get in it I got to get
[14:20] involved in that church in that in the
[14:22] in the Church of God the Church of
[14:24] Christ not the Church of Christ
[14:25] denomination but the church that Christ
[14:27] set up on the day of Pentecost I got to
[14:29] be a part of that don't you think listen
[14:31] Satan didn't take a vacation when them
[14:32] 120 in the upper room receive the Holy
[14:34] Ghost he wasn't going off somewhere he
[14:36] was standing right there the problem was
[14:38] brother Kylie he couldn't get what they
[14:40] got he said I got need that I feel that
[14:43] power I
[14:45] can I just can't get a hold of it I hate
[14:49] that thing now so I'm going to get as
[14:51] close as I can to it and as if if God
[14:53] loes something I'm gonna lose something
[14:55] right behind
[14:56] him because remember Satan's not an
[14:58] originator right Satan perverts what's
[15:01] already been spoken so if God hadn't
[15:03] given us a real white righteous Church a
[15:06] real one that first church age was white
[15:09] they had no denomination behind it sure
[15:11] they had little sayings and that's what
[15:12] we'll get to a little bit there was a
[15:14] saying went out then it was a deed and
[15:16] then it was a Doctrine and then they
[15:17] crowned that Doctrine into a pope that's
[15:21] how it starts when one of my other
[15:22] favorite scriptures is in James where it
[15:24] says when lust is conceived it brings
[15:26] forth sin When sin is finished
[15:29] finished it brings forth death so you
[15:31] got four stages there we know we're all
[15:34] born in
[15:35] sin
[15:36] amen but when it's finished when when we
[15:39] become a part of that it becomes death
[15:42] right sure it's death to begin with but
[15:45] when lust is conceived it brings forth
[15:48] sin when sin's finished in other words
[15:51] you continue into it yes it brings forth
[15:54] death absolutely we're all born in sin
[15:56] we're all born dead but we don't have to
[15:58] continue in it we can come out of her my
[16:01] people as we're going to read here in
[16:02] just a few
[16:04] minutes Revelation 6 verse1 so God's
[16:07] going to the Lamb's going to stand and
[16:09] open a seal a white horse rider goes out
[16:12] but remember one of the four beasts the
[16:14] lion first thing he said was was come
[16:17] and see when what was the lion the lion
[16:19] was the spirit in the first three Church
[16:21] ages that was bold and it was pure and
[16:24] it was good and it was powerful and it
[16:27] roared through Three Ages
[16:30] but God sent a a lion out but Satan
[16:34] sends a horse
[16:37] out a white
[16:40] horse you watch him though he started
[16:42] out white went to black red black and
[16:46] pale he didn't start out black he's
[16:49] shrewd he's shrewd with me and you he's
[16:52] shrewd he's a
[16:54] bluffer he had a bow but no arrows and
[16:58] was Crown was given to him and he went
[16:59] forth conquering what did he do he
[17:01] conquered all those first three Church
[17:03] ages he conquered every one of those
[17:05] doctrines that were true he made a false
[17:07] one out of it or he took man and state
[17:09] and put or church and state and put them
[17:11] together and made instead of making
[17:13] mythology Greek mythology has been
[17:15] around for a long time Zeus and Thor and
[17:18] all the different things if you read up
[17:19] in the history man the Roman Catholic
[17:21] Church they just said hey everybody
[17:23] everybody likes
[17:25] that they love Diana remember they they
[17:28] stood for six some of y'all try that for
[17:30] God they stood six hours one day and
[17:32] said hail Diana hail di for 6 hours to a
[17:37] pagan
[17:38] God we can't sit for an hour and listen
[17:42] to God we ought to be
[17:44] ashamed why they had you know why cuz
[17:47] maybe sometime somewhere somebody got
[17:50] lucky and looked at Diana and and and
[17:52] God give them some money or something or
[17:54] not God but their God give him some
[17:55] money or or done something they want to
[17:57] put listen they want to put her up there
[17:58] if they went something went on hadn't
[18:00] went on each one of them if there that
[18:02] God put up there it's because somewhere
[18:05] in the line they got something from that
[18:07] God or something happened when that God
[18:09] was there or they wouldn't be the God
[18:11] right but we know it's all false and we
[18:13] know that the Catholic Church all they
[18:15] done was they said hey that's
[18:17] popular let's pull it in here and let's
[18:20] let's make it Paul Peter and all the
[18:23] different ones so he bluffed his way
[18:25] into the true
[18:26] church just a saying though had no power
[18:29] to it cuz he only had a bow he
[18:32] said well maybe maybe you know Jesus was
[18:36] was I think he had to go to the bathroom
[18:38] and the Bible said he cried he can't be
[18:41] God he's got to be another person see
[18:44] how simple that
[18:46] is but it's very simple to realize that
[18:50] the Bible in the Old Testament said
[18:52] behold oh Israel the Lord our God is one
[18:56] and that's it I don't need explaining
[18:58] anymore he's one God with many
[19:01] manifestations but they're like no he
[19:03] can't be that and be this or this and
[19:05] this and this let's put him in three
[19:07] three three personalities let's split
[19:09] him
[19:10] up that was a
[19:13] saying and you know what that saying did
[19:16] that saying was preached in church
[19:18] services until somebody caught that and
[19:22] it wasn't a revelation from God that's
[19:24] why I say Satan sits in this
[19:26] congregation just like y'all do amen and
[19:29] he don't
[19:30] sleep Revelation 6:3 and when he had
[19:33] opened the second seal I heard the
[19:35] second beast or what another Ministry
[19:37] another power right another Ministry was
[19:41] loosed cuz they they needed it to get
[19:44] through that dark Church age to get
[19:45] through that long Church age they needed
[19:47] an ox Spirit
[19:50] to work just a little bit back and forth
[19:52] work work
[19:54] work cuz it was a long Church age and
[19:56] they were going to all die and they went
[19:59] out another horse another Ministry that
[20:01] was red and power was giving him set
[20:04] there to take peace from the earth look
[20:05] what happened look at all the wars if
[20:08] you take from from about 600
[20:11] AD to even to now look how many wars
[20:14] there's been how many hundreds of
[20:15] thousands of millions of people been
[20:17] killed because of wars that red horse is
[20:19] still riding folks it's still riding now
[20:22] that's what's taking peace from the your
[20:23] Earth yes right that's taking peace from
[20:26] your Earth you're letting that red horse
[20:28] Rider ride through your life get him out
[20:31] of there you don't need him anymore you
[20:33] don't need you don't need that kind of
[20:37] horse and there was given unto him a
[20:39] great sword or a great wor so now that
[20:41] that saying now has become a
[20:45] deed let's get together and let's start
[20:47] doing these
[20:49] things now let's go to the second seal
[20:52] when the slain risen lamb opened in the
[20:54] second cathot beast said come and see
[20:56] what that seal mystery is now we get it
[20:59] the lamb you remember has to open every
[21:01] seal we'll get to that later on when we
[21:03] get to the seals if you notice in the
[21:05] routine of where we just went through in
[21:07] other words every age the routine first
[21:09] was a lion the next was a ox you see and
[21:12] this Beast said come see now when the
[21:14] lamb opened to seal then what John went
[21:16] to sea so listen if John went to sea and
[21:19] he types A bride guess what we're
[21:21] supposed to be able to see the seals
[21:23] that
[21:24] open I the only time you're blind is
[21:27] because you blind yourself the only time
[21:28] you're blind is you let Satan put his
[21:30] hands in front of your eyes all right
[21:32] because the Bible tells us there was a
[21:34] group of people that saw what was going
[21:36] on and
[21:38] withstood that pressure withstood
[21:45] Satan to what happened let's see what he
[21:47] found out come see there's a
[21:50] mystery what was the mystery the mystery
[21:52] was that the world thought that
[21:54] Constantine was a wonderful guy he
[21:56] brought two things together and look how
[21:59] it flourished and and they got rid of
[22:01] them old people that that that believe
[22:03] different than they did yeah 68 million
[22:05] true Christians died though look at your
[22:08] look at your read your history I
[22:10] remember about studying about
[22:11] Constantine where church and state was
[22:12] brought together how it was a wonderful
[22:14] guy and he wanted to get everybody
[22:15] together he wanted everybody to be
[22:19] one well he was the worst thing that
[22:21] ever happened he was just like Jezebel
[22:22] and
[22:23] Ahab that's what brother rer said so a
[22:27] red horse goes out
[22:29] now notice that they should kill one
[22:30] another they should kill each other his
[22:33] bow had no arrows at first but his great
[22:35] sword did he done his killing later and
[22:38] changed from a white horse to a red
[22:39] horse the same exact Devil with a
[22:43] sword he's going forth with a sword in
[22:46] his hand or a word now listen that word
[22:48] hadn't stopped either that word
[22:49] developed into a doctrine that Doctrine
[22:52] developed into a pope sitting over there
[22:53] in Rome all right everybody with
[22:55] me waiting through the blood of
[22:58] everybody that disagrees with
[23:02] him you think we have little little
[23:05] spats when people don't agree with you
[23:07] it meant death in that
[23:09] age it's real death they killed
[23:13] you now do you understand it how many
[23:16] understand what that seal is now what it
[23:18] was the opening of the of the red horse
[23:19] rider going through the church age of
[23:22] the tharan church age and who did it the
[23:25] Catholic church but it was Satan sitting
[23:27] on the on the horse but he was doing it
[23:29] through the
[23:30] people this Rider and all his kingdom
[23:33] subjects that are slain down through the
[23:34] age that's draw all this Blood Of
[23:36] Martyrs of the Saints will be slain By
[23:37] The Sword of Jesus Christ when he
[23:41] comes we'll talk later on about the vs
[23:44] but the vs is what God the vows is a
[23:46] wrath of God you don't believe there's a
[23:48] wrath of God don't hang around but read
[23:51] your Bible don't hang around for the
[23:53] wrath of God to be poured out cuz I
[23:55] promise you he's an Angry God when you
[23:57] don't do what he say say all
[24:00] right that's why I want to be sealed
[24:02] away in him if you're sealed away in him
[24:05] and judged in him then you can't he
[24:07] can't judge yourself wrong amen he's a
[24:10] righteous judge but he can't judge
[24:12] yourself wrong but he can judge you
[24:14] wrong if you're not in him that's right
[24:16] right they took the sword of dogma and
[24:18] Antichrist and cut down the real true
[24:20] worshipper all down Through the Ages by
[24:21] the millions and when Christ comes with
[24:24] a sword in other words go over in the
[24:25] Book of Daniel he's going to stand and
[24:27] fight for is he's going to destroy this
[24:29] place and level it he will slay every
[24:31] enemy before him kill the
[24:34] enemy now first he had a bow no arrows
[24:37] he's got a mighty sword in his hand now
[24:39] he can do anything now so he jumps off
[24:41] his White Horse now he straddles a red
[24:43] horse blood blood red he really rides
[24:47] that one why for 900 years he rode that
[24:50] and he developed during that time he
[24:52] develop
[24:53] doctrines that people still go by now
[24:56] amen I mean that n see en couns so they
[24:58] wrote all that stuff down and that's
[25:00] what they go
[25:01] by the Apostles Creed that people read
[25:04] the the worship of
[25:06] Mary uh that Jesus wasn't God that he
[25:09] was a like substance and maybe a second
[25:11] person and and they really didn't know
[25:13] who the Holy Ghost was so they made it a
[25:14] third
[25:16] person listen it's more hard to explain
[25:21] the Trinity than it is just say God's
[25:26] one if you keep reading in history and I
[25:28] read about that one the man in
[25:31] N that was the one the book about NAA
[25:33] and naan counsil he said it was hard for
[25:36] them to explain that the theologians
[25:39] during the time didn't understand it
[25:41] they just took it as as Doctrine and
[25:42] they said oh must be a trinity he's
[25:45] three he's got three personalities they
[25:48] even had one picture of him one God with
[25:50] three heads on it one looking that way
[25:51] one looking that way one looking that
[25:53] way with one
[25:55] body and people accepted it though
[25:59] that's the whole thing if you accept the
[26:01] doctrine you become that Doctrine right
[26:03] amen listen I want the doctrine of
[26:06] Christ that way I can be Christ if I
[26:09] accept that Doctrine the real Doctrine
[26:11] the true Doctrine which we have in this
[26:13] end time then you are
[26:15] Christ and you are under his Doctrine
[26:18] listen brother Brown said a church
[26:19] without a Doctrine is not a church so we
[26:22] got a
[26:25] Doctrine this Doctrine in this church
[26:27] has been that the word is prevalent
[26:29] above all amen prevalent above
[26:32] everything the word of God and the truth
[26:35] of the word of God over everything the
[26:37] word of God is true it will stand true
[26:39] is true going to be true and will never
[26:42] [Applause]
[26:43] fail if I stand here long enough it'll
[26:46] be the same way we're going to put the
[26:48] word first the word of God is going to
[26:50] be taught you can you can like those
[26:53] preachers that jump up and down and
[26:54] shout and all that other stuff that's
[26:56] okay that's why they call special
[26:58] meetings and I appreciate them and I
[27:00] like
[27:02] them but the teaching of the word the
[27:06] teaching of the word is
[27:07] done how many of you been in a school
[27:10] room and the teacher teaching you and
[27:12] you're shouting and running all over the
[27:13] place no you sit and listen you sit and
[27:17] listen and then as brother Joe and I
[27:19] were talking a few minutes ago he said
[27:20] there's things that I heard you know 30
[27:22] years ago in other words somebody say
[27:26] something else though and God was Park
[27:28] that right back it's like you maybe not
[27:29] even listen to it subliminally listen
[27:31] the Holy Ghost Inside of You never
[27:33] missed a lick put it in in U southern
[27:37] English he never listen the Holy Ghost
[27:39] is not doesn't have gaps in his mind he
[27:41] don't have dementia that's right he said
[27:44] he'd bring it back to your remembrance
[27:45] and teach you things to come so we may
[27:48] not get it today but tomorrow we may get
[27:50] it we may get it in two weeks we may get
[27:52] in the year amen that's why like a
[27:55] fivefold Ministry it comes out from five
[27:57] different angles
[27:58] five different angles of the same story
[28:00] though it's like Matthew Mark Luke and
[28:02] John was four commentaries of the same
[28:04] thing that's going on one saw two Blind
[28:06] Men the other saw one doesn't make the
[28:09] word wrong it just makes it at a
[28:12] different angle that you can see it so
[28:16] it started out it become a it was a
[28:18] saying and now it's going to be a deed
[28:20] in this fourth Church age the fifth
[28:23] Church age coming in it's going to be a
[28:24] Doctrine it's going to be something that
[28:26] they're going to do
[28:28] and it's going to be something they do
[28:29] in a church because a Doctrine without a
[28:31] church is not a church so a they have a
[28:33] Doctrine out
[28:34] there every Church there Baptists have a
[28:37] Doctrine methodists have a Doctrine
[28:39] we're fixing to leave here in a little
[28:41] while and go to a Methodist Church and
[28:43] come out of the United Methodist but
[28:44] there's a old football coach of mine is
[28:46] preaching there so he they asked us some
[28:48] of the old football players to come so
[28:50] we're going to go and listen to him
[28:52] speak at the U Methodist Church down in
[28:55] Homer and um or New Salem and and um you
[28:59] know
[29:01] what I wouldn't go to that denomination
[29:04] of
[29:07] Church you went to a denomination of
[29:09] horor church to
[29:11] yourself you come out of something
[29:15] amen so maybe we can go in there and get
[29:17] somebody
[29:19] out amen amen I'm not going to go in
[29:21] there and say oh I believe in a trinity
[29:23] now
[29:24] folks now if they ask me I'm say I
[29:27] believe in one God
[29:29] but they came out of that Methodist
[29:30] movement so they don't have pastors
[29:32] anymore the pastors that believed in
[29:34] that um you know all
[29:37] that women preachers and and homosexuals
[29:40] and all that they've left and they this
[29:42] this church has come out and separated
[29:44] their s you know what God honor that
[29:47] whether they're in that system or not
[29:49] he's going to honor them for not going
[29:50] into that system and be that United
[29:52] Methodist so now what they're doing is
[29:54] they're looking for preachers cuz all
[29:55] the preachers left cuz you know what
[29:57] because of money
[29:58] amen the United Methodist Church is huge
[30:00] they got a lot of money so they can pay
[30:02] the people that's the same thing a
[30:04] Catholic Church set up thousands of
[30:05] years ago we'll pay you better if you'll
[30:08] just say what we
[30:11] say Matthew 6 ver 23 if therefore the
[30:14] light that's in you be Darkness how
[30:15] great is that Darkness we read that this
[30:17] morning so let let's go to the sardian
[30:19] church AG just for a minute let's get
[30:21] into something right here because
[30:22] remember this church age Begins the age
[30:27] of of
[30:29] reformation all right now to reform
[30:33] somebody you send somebody kid to a
[30:35] reformed
[30:36] school it really don't do them any good
[30:40] until they get
[30:42] restored
[30:44] okay so a Reformation sure it's part way
[30:48] out but if you reform an alcoholic an
[30:51] alcoholic goes through a 12-step
[30:53] process but they always tell you we're
[30:56] going to teach you how to become formed
[30:59] but you're always an alcoholic you
[31:01] always going to not need to be around
[31:03] alcohol you always this and that and the
[31:05] other no no no you get the born you get
[31:07] the Born Again experience you get the
[31:10] new birth you've been restored that
[31:12] thing's gone sir you can set a 100 beers
[31:14] in front of you if you want to doesn't
[31:16] matter not going to hurt you but but so
[31:18] Reformation is then some of it came out
[31:21] some of it stayed in or the people that
[31:23] came out took some of it with them okay
[31:26] but not in this age
[31:29] m not in this age cuz it's required what
[31:33] full
[31:34] Revelation in this age so God said I
[31:37] Know Thy Works thou Hast a name that
[31:38] thou livest and our dead so they came
[31:40] out of that that they came out of that
[31:42] middle Church age and they started
[31:43] saying I'm
[31:45] Baptist I'm Methodist not Methodist but
[31:48] I'm this and I'm that and I'm this and
[31:49] it developed on up into
[31:53] Wesley you got the lutherans and then
[31:55] you got the Wesleyan and then the wesle
[31:56] of the methodists and you
[31:58] you got a name that you're living by but
[32:00] you're dead amen I just want to be bride
[32:04] bride is it m Jesus Christ
[32:08] amen Be watchful and strengthen the
[32:11] things which remain in other words you
[32:13] got a little hope you got a little
[32:15] strength use
[32:17] it that are ready to die for I have not
[32:20] found thy works perfect before God other
[32:22] words Luther brought out a
[32:23] denominational idea called the Trinity
[32:26] because he believed in the trinity
[32:28] but he didn't believe in justification
[32:30] like they did he believed in
[32:32] justification by faith not by Penance
[32:34] that you did so that one little work of
[32:36] God he was pleased with it just like I
[32:38] said this morning brother Brown said God
[32:39] was pleased with that all right they'll
[32:42] have some few names in stst which have
[32:44] not defiled their garments they shall
[32:46] walk with me in white for they are
[32:47] worthy so there's a worthy group in
[32:49] every age even in this bad old church
[32:52] age called leosa so now the combat Beast
[32:55] we're we're getting out of the the Ox
[32:58] age and we're coming into the age of man
[32:59] or
[33:00] intelligence where that you don't just
[33:03] work the ox works the ox works the ox
[33:06] works well now you come to the man age
[33:08] he makes a car or a tractor or where you
[33:11] don't have to plow with a mule you plow
[33:13] with a tractor all right so the
[33:15] intelligence of man but what came first
[33:18] the intelligence of God yes God is going
[33:21] to now start using man again not not
[33:23] that he didn't use them before but I'm
[33:25] talking about to restore cuz remember
[33:28] this is Reformation but it is the
[33:31] beginning of
[33:34] restoration I will restore I'll read it
[33:36] to you in just a
[33:38] minute all right so we see the age
[33:40] coming up we'll go back through that
[33:42] they were the escaped
[33:43] ones they were the first people that
[33:46] really broke away cuz Hey listen during
[33:48] that 900 years you said one thing
[33:50] against the Catholic Church you died but
[33:52] there was a group of people somewhere
[33:55] that met in houses met in caves met in
[33:58] different places that kept the word of
[34:00] God alive same way with us there's all
[34:02] kind of denominations on every on every
[34:05] corner but God's going to keep his word
[34:07] alive and I'm just going to say we're
[34:09] part of that
[34:13] word that broke with Papa Rome that
[34:15] actually flourished it didn't die you
[34:18] know why cuz God had a purpose
[34:21] amen no doubt caused the Jezebel
[34:24] propheus to consolidate and emphasize
[34:27] her doct
[34:28] of marry or
[34:30] mariology in deciding decided opposition
[34:33] to the Protestants who denied her any
[34:35] part whatsoever in the Plan of Salvation
[34:37] thank God they had a group of people
[34:39] said no Mary ain't God she ain't the
[34:41] mother of
[34:42] God she didn't have sin she's dead she
[34:46] had to go to Pentecost to get the Holy
[34:50] Ghost as Luther crystallized the
[34:52] doctrine of justification by faith they
[34:54] held to works there's always opposition
[34:57] Penance prayers and other unscriptural
[34:59] means and as the freed Christians
[35:01] glorified the son the Roman Catholics
[35:03] they glor what took the took the vision
[35:06] off the son and put it on the
[35:08] mother well that was nothing more than
[35:10] what I said before they put it on a
[35:12] dominating female spirit that Mary now
[35:14] is above Jesus cuz she's nicer or more
[35:18] nice yeah me too Lord have mercy you got
[35:20] that right but they believe that they do
[35:22] it all the time they pray to Mary they
[35:25] don't even pray to Jesus anymore they
[35:26] pray to Mary
[35:28] pop P literally exalted married the
[35:30] glorification in a resurrected body now
[35:33] that and if you'll read that Nia book he
[35:36] he calls
[35:38] it Bible Acts because it ain't in the
[35:42] Bible but it's extra part of the Bible
[35:44] That's Roman Catholics there's nowh that
[35:46] Mary was glorified and and had a
[35:48] resurrected body but the Catholic Church
[35:51] put it in the X part of the Bible that
[35:53] she did there's no foundation for a lot
[35:55] of this
[35:57] that's why they took the Bibles out of
[36:00] the people's hand that's why they took
[36:03] and put everything in Latin and says hey
[36:05] you just believe that priest you just
[36:08] believe that Pope don't let somebody
[36:11] study this thing out cuz you ain't going
[36:13] to find it in the Bible let's take this
[36:16] away what Nicko ISM take the power away
[36:18] from the people and put it in a pope
[36:22] yeah the doctrine is absolutely the
[36:24] Babylonia want of the son carrying the
[36:26] mother bodily and to Heaven Martin
[36:28] Luther was the man we saw what he did he
[36:31] had some problems but he was the church
[36:32] age messenger for that age and I love
[36:36] this letter because he wrote this letter
[36:38] to the pope this is like this is like
[36:40] writing it to God that they saw because
[36:43] they thought he was God they thought
[36:45] listen a Pope's infallible according to
[36:47] the Catholic
[36:48] church if he says start a war you start
[36:50] a war there is no question that's right
[36:52] if he says we're going to change
[36:53] Doctrine we're going to change Doctrine
[36:56] if he says we're going to do this we're
[36:58] going to stop War we're going to start
[36:59] War we're going to do this that's why
[37:01] when he stands up over there when we're
[37:03] gone he stands up over there incarnate
[37:05] he says I'm God and he shows signs and
[37:08] wonders to where the world's going to
[37:09] believe him
[37:11] yes believe him and the Holy Ghost is
[37:14] going to be nowhere to be found but it's
[37:17] a spirit that he
[37:20] takes so you think about a man that was
[37:23] brought up in the Catholic Church
[37:24] brought up in this system God gives him
[37:27] a revel ation and he comes out and he
[37:29] writes this to supposedly to his head
[37:32] guy or to God the first and chief
[37:36] article is this Jesus Christ Our Lord
[37:37] and God died for our sins and was raised
[37:39] again for our
[37:40] justification he alone is the Lamb of
[37:43] God who takes away the sins of the world
[37:44] well right there see he's pulled apart
[37:46] yes sir cuz the Pope's one that's
[37:49] supposed to be one that forgives and
[37:50] okay he alone is the Lamb of God look he
[37:53] alone he wrote it specifically he alone
[37:56] is the Lamb of God takes away the son of
[37:58] the world and God has laid on him the
[38:00] iniquity of us all all have sinned and
[38:03] are Justified freely there's another one
[38:06] he pulled he pulled Roots out without
[38:08] their own works and merits by his grace
[38:11] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[38:13] in his blood this is necessary to
[38:16] believe this cannot be otherwise
[38:19] acquired or grasped by any work law
[38:21] Merit or no
[38:24] venius therefore it is clear and certain
[38:27] that this faith alone justifies us alone
[38:31] now he's writing this to the Pope the
[38:32] Pope's reading
[38:33] it he's mad cuz somebody has bucked the
[38:37] system somebody has come out of the
[38:40] normal and and without the grace of God
[38:43] though all that Pope would had to say he
[38:45] did he they tried to kill Martin Luther
[38:47] but God wouldn't let him he had a
[38:48] message praise God he's not done with us
[38:51] until he's done with us and they send
[38:53] the FBI CIA Messiah whatever they want
[38:56] to send that's okay that's
[38:58] right but Martin Luther stood there and
[39:01] said the just shall live by faith and
[39:03] this right here watch nothing of this
[39:06] article can be yielded or surrendered in
[39:09] other words I'm not going to write you
[39:10] you're not going to write me one and
[39:12] scare me and then I'm going to write one
[39:14] back and
[39:15] recant this is it this is written in
[39:18] stone it's it can be it can be yielded
[39:22] or surrendered nothing of this article
[39:24] even though Heaven and Earth and
[39:26] everything else
[39:27] Falls how about that and we know what he
[39:31] wrote to the followers so let's get
[39:32] right here this where we ended this
[39:36] morning let's talk about the Reformation
[39:39] he was against works as a means of
[39:41] Salvation and baptism as a means of
[39:43] regeneration in other words now what's
[39:45] you doing the the now what do the
[39:46] Catholics tell you you take the baby I
[39:49] saw those when we were working with them
[39:51] into plant soon as they had a baby they
[39:53] had to get that baby um
[39:55] sprinkled baptized or he was going to
[39:59] hell so that was means of regeneration
[40:02] didn't matter if the kid grew up and
[40:03] became Adolf Hitler he was baptized by
[40:06] the Catholic church so that put him in
[40:09] heaven well that's not what water
[40:11] baptism does right but see that's the ex
[40:14] Bible That's the ex Bible part of the
[40:17] part outside the Bible that the Catholic
[40:19] Church
[40:20] wrote he taught the mediation of Christ
[40:22] apart from man as was the original and
[40:25] Pentecostal concept and we read read
[40:27] what he did let's just continue through
[40:31] here
[40:33] now now what stirred his heart by the
[40:35] Holy Ghost and which was the little
[40:37] green shoot that signified that truth
[40:39] watch was coming back to the church as
[40:44] it was known at Pentecost was the
[40:46] doctrine of justification salvation by
[40:49] grace apart from
[40:51] works and he realized he didn't just
[40:53] preach that we know he didn't but that
[40:55] was what that was what I believe that
[40:57] the people caught they caught that and
[41:00] they come out said hey I don't have to
[41:01] do Penance I don't have to do all this
[41:03] all I got to do is believe in Jesus
[41:05] Christ and there was a big group of
[41:07] people came
[41:08] out he will be forever known as the
[41:10] instrument in the hand of God who
[41:11] revived this truth he was the fifth
[41:13] messenger and his message was the just
[41:16] shall live by
[41:17] faith now he preached and knew and did
[41:19] preach that we are to go from Faith to
[41:21] Faith so in other words he did preach a
[41:22] progressive revelation but it was just
[41:25] under his ministry just live by faith
[41:28] all right he didn't have to know the
[41:29] seals or the plagues or the vials or he
[41:32] still drank beer and He Still Smoked the
[41:35] pipe but he was a great man in the word
[41:37] for the day and hour that he lived in
[41:40] all right and he's listen he's one of
[41:43] those stars that God held in his
[41:46] hand now that can't be unworthy if God
[41:50] held those seven men and Luther was one
[41:52] of them he was happily pleased in what
[41:55] Martin Luther did not the things Martin
[41:58] Luther failed in listen if he it same
[42:02] with us if he took all our failures we
[42:05] just might as well go to the
[42:07] house but he looks inside of you and he
[42:09] sees the desire of your heart yes if the
[42:13] desire in your heart's there it'll come
[42:16] out he was a reformer not a prophet so
[42:19] he was not able to lead the church back
[42:21] to the whole truth as would a man like
[42:24] Paul or brother brandham who was both a
[42:28] and Prophet everybody with me some are
[42:31] not go don't go to nod that's where Cain
[42:35] went the word does not call it a
[42:38] restoration but certainly calls it
[42:39] Reformation had it been a restoration
[42:41] that age would have been what what's
[42:43] brother R saying if it was a a
[42:45] Pentecostal age back to Restoration
[42:49] Martin Luther would have said the just
[42:51] shall live by faith the father son Holy
[42:54] Ghost baptism is wrong no ET etal hell
[42:57] or eternal hell is wrong Purgatory is
[42:59] wrong all this is wrong that's what
[43:01] brother vom did this is wrong this is
[43:03] wrong this is wrong we're coming back
[43:05] we're coming back to this even the
[43:07] Pentecostals in 1906 they were
[43:10] trinitarians that thing was so
[43:13] strong God had to wink at their
[43:15] ignorance he had to wink at all
[43:19] that had it been a restoration that age
[43:22] would have been another Pentecostal but
[43:23] it was not the best they could say was
[43:25] strengthen that way which remains that
[43:28] is ready to die there was something
[43:30] missing oh yeah my there was something
[43:32] missing this age had justification but
[43:35] it Miss sanctification what's he
[43:37] saying that was for John
[43:39] Wesley Martin Luther was the just shall
[43:42] live by
[43:43] faith and we'll read it in just a minute
[43:45] you got to put that in your journey
[43:48] these last three ages is your journey in
[43:51] your birth all
[43:55] right that was God original plan what
[43:58] was like it was at Pentecost they were
[44:00] Justified Sanctified filled with the
[44:02] Holy Ghost listen to me the reason for
[44:04] being justified and Sanctified is to the
[44:07] end that you might be baptized with the
[44:10] Holy Ghost that's the reason there is a
[44:12] church it's the temple of God filled
[44:15] with God even the Holy Ghost The Same
[44:17] Spirit that was in Jesus while he was
[44:19] here on Earth causing him to do those
[44:20] Mighty Works came back on the day of
[44:22] Pentecost and I say today it's in you
[44:25] and I
[44:27] this age did not have those words or
[44:29] they had the written word but not the
[44:30] revealed word that was a Reformation
[44:33] period but fear not little flock God
[44:35] said what I will
[44:38] restore now pay attention to that
[44:41] remember it was an unfulfilled AG let's
[44:43] go down where it's right here it says I
[44:46] will restore we'll start start right
[44:51] there oh let's read this right
[44:55] here watch Revelations 18 and after
[44:58] these things I saw another Angel come
[45:00] down from heaven having great power and
[45:02] the Earth was lightened with his glory
[45:04] now think about Luther Luther is
[45:06] preaching his message he's bringing
[45:08] light back the True Light Of God he's
[45:10] bringing it
[45:12] back but Babylon didn't come out Babylon
[45:18] is in bad shape Babylon the greatest
[45:21] Fallen become the habitation of devils
[45:24] and the hold of every foul Spirit what
[45:27] what started in
[45:28] nah it incarnates a group of people in
[45:31] the end
[45:33] time for all nations look they got drunk
[45:37] with the wrath of her fornication they
[45:39] loved it they love this Catholic thing
[45:42] Hey listen that's that's why the Mafia
[45:45] likeed the Catholic
[45:47] Church they could go and do
[45:50] indulgences or get forgiven for the
[45:53] murders they were going to commit three
[45:55] days from now right
[45:58] confess to the priest the priest do
[46:00] whatever he does and then he says okay
[46:01] you're you're you you don't have to
[46:03] worry about that your sins are
[46:05] forgiven and of course they paid him a
[46:08] little cash to go with that that
[46:11] confession of Booth had probably had a
[46:12] little square in it like that where it
[46:14] could slide the money in it had to be
[46:16] pretty high CU it was a lot of money for
[46:19] all nations have drunk of the wine of
[46:21] the wrath of her fornication and the
[46:22] kings of the Earth the kings of the
[46:25] Earth the Great Men that committed
[46:27] fornication with her and the merchants
[46:29] in the Earth are waxed Rich to the
[46:30] abundance of her Delicacies and I heard
[46:33] another voice from Heaven saying come
[46:35] out of her my
[46:37] people look come out of her my people my
[46:41] people was in there brother John my
[46:44] people God said you're in that system
[46:46] but I'm going to send you
[46:48] somebody that's going to shout loud
[46:51] enough to say come out of her sir and
[46:53] I'm going to give you a reason to come
[46:55] out I'm going to give you something to
[46:56] lie not something
[46:58] dead that you be not partakers of her
[47:01] sins and that you receive not of her
[47:03] plagues for her sins reached all the way
[47:06] into
[47:07] heaven and God hath remembered her
[47:12] iniquities reward her even as she
[47:14] rewarded you double listen if they
[47:18] killed 68
[47:20] million God's going to kill twice that
[47:22] many listen to what I'm saying reward
[47:25] her even as she reward Ed
[47:28] you and double unto her double according
[47:32] to her
[47:33] Works God's going to destroy this whole
[47:35] world folks that's s billion people 8
[47:38] billion now in the cup which she hath
[47:41] filled filled to her
[47:45] double how much she hath glorified
[47:47] herself and lived deliciously so much
[47:50] torment and sorrow give her for she
[47:53] saith in her heart I sit a queen and I'm
[47:55] no Widow and shall shall see no sorrow
[47:58] therefore shall her plagues come in one
[48:00] day death mourning famine she shall be
[48:02] utterly burned with fire for strong is a
[48:04] lord god what who judgeth the great
[48:08] so look in the Feast of the
[48:10] trumpets
[48:11] watch here's brother random explaining
[48:13] the ages and explaining now listen real
[48:16] quick Shake
[48:20] Yourself the Holy Spirit has been bound
[48:22] by the
[48:23] denominations all these 2,000 years all
[48:27] right we find out it has now notice the
[48:31] sabbaths seven sabbaths now what's he
[48:34] talking about seven Church ages seven
[48:37] sevens is 49 all right you didn't come
[48:39] all the way out on a 49 you came out as
[48:41] Brother Richard was talking about on a
[48:43] 50 last Sunday 50 is a jubilee that
[48:46] everything goes free listen Luther came
[48:48] out but didn't get all the way free
[48:50] Wesley came out but didn't get all the
[48:52] way free Pentecost came out and didn't
[48:54] get all the way free but Hallelujah this
[48:56] age comes out and we have a 50 Jubilee
[48:59] we go all free this guy right here goes
[49:02] Hallelujah this out of court goes with
[49:05] it they couldn't get all the way out
[49:08] what do you mean they couldn't get all
[49:09] the doctrines out of their self they had
[49:13] to bring some of the doctrine with them
[49:16] the Bible said there'll be a day that
[49:17] will be neither night or day what the
[49:19] evening time it shall be light all
[49:22] scripture Jesus said must be fulfilled
[49:24] is that right congregation says amen the
[49:26] proph said there will be a day that
[49:27] can't be called day and night but in the
[49:29] evening time it shall be light I'll
[49:32] promise you one thing the light in you
[49:34] today is not Darkness the light in you
[49:37] today is the light of God it's the light
[49:39] of what he wanted before the foundation
[49:40] of the world this is what he's been
[49:42] looking for this is the day he's been
[49:44] looking for this is the people he's been
[49:45] looking for he took this one to this one
[49:48] bred that one to that one to that one to
[49:49] that one to get you
[49:50] here to get you here
[49:57] I will
[49:58] restore John
[50:00] 12:23 this is the whole reason listen to
[50:03] me just for a minute this is the whole
[50:06] reason God brought Luther and Wesley and
[50:10] Pentecost on that side of that Dark Age
[50:13] this side see we're on this side of the
[50:15] Dark Age
[50:16] Now Jesus answered said the hour has
[50:18] come that the son of man should be
[50:21] glorified now watch verely verely I say
[50:24] unto you except a corner of wheat now
[50:27] he's talking about himself but scripture
[50:29] has dual meaning right everybody with me
[50:32] scripture has dual
[50:34] meaning except the corn of wheat fall in
[50:37] the ground and die it abideth alone if
[50:40] Jesus had not had died like he did or
[50:42] was killed he would have been
[50:45] alone but if it die it bringeth forth
[50:48] much fruit so it had to go in the ground
[50:50] at n it had to go into the ground the
[50:52] true seed and but remember it wasn't
[50:55] dead though you just couldn't see it it
[50:58] was covered by so much denominational
[51:00] Darkness but that seed was still there
[51:03] amen and God promised I'll restore
[51:06] whatever that seed that went in the
[51:07] ground is going to come back up yes sir
[51:10] Joel 2:23 be glad then you children of
[51:12] Zion and rejoice in the Lord your God
[51:14] for he hath given you the former rain
[51:16] moderately and he will cause to come
[51:18] down for you the rain what is rain a
[51:21] message it's a message it's coming down
[51:24] from God what a message is supposed to
[51:26] ref
[51:28] precious this is not
[51:34] refreshing he will cause to come down
[51:37] for you the rain the former rain and the
[51:39] latter rain in the first month both
[51:41] together former rains of what planting
[51:43] rain what's the last one the Harvest
[51:46] rain all right and the floor shall be
[51:48] full of Wheat and the fat shall overflow
[51:50] with wine and oil
[51:53] overflow and I will restore to you the
[51:56] years that the Locust had eaten the
[51:59] canker worm the caterpillar the Palmer
[52:00] worm my great Army which I sent among
[52:03] you and you shall just barely get by no
[52:06] that says you shall eat in
[52:08] plenty and look and be
[52:12] satisfied and praise the name of the
[52:14] Lord your God why cuz you see that
[52:16] restoration coming back you see that
[52:19] seed that went in the ground it's now
[52:21] made to be
[52:23] mature and praise the name of the Lord
[52:25] your God that hath dealt wondrously with
[52:27] you amen you yes and my people shall
[52:33] never be
[52:35] ashamed don't be ashamed to be called a
[52:37] Christian don't be ashamed to be
[52:39] different from the
[52:40] world it's God's way yes and you shall
[52:43] know that I am in the midst of Israel
[52:45] and I am the Lord your God and none
[52:49] else and my people shall never be
[52:53] ashamed now look at we see it says right
[52:56] here and I will restore to you all right
[53:00] now I looked in the um Bible that had 26
[53:04] translations I got it from Dad's library

[53:22] Pentecost but I'm going to make it up to
[53:24] you what all these the Locust a the
[53:27] Locust lopping swarming leaping

[53:37] hard in the end time but there's only a
[53:40] small group of people going to get it
[53:42] The New American Bible says look I will
[53:44] repay you now look God said a few
[53:48] minutes ago in Revelations 18 I'm going
[53:50] to repay
[53:52] her did you not hear that I'm going to
[53:55] repay her all the years that she
[53:57] fornicated and did all those things
[53:58] against God and killed my
[54:01] people but praise God he's going to
[54:03] repay us for the years that we fought
[54:06] and fought and fought and fought we
[54:08] fought for this thing it's a fight it's
[54:10] not a
[54:11] picnic a battleship not a cruise
[54:15] ship I will repay you God promised I'm
[54:18] going to not just restore I'm going to
[54:19] repay you yes for the years which the
[54:22] Locust has eaten the grasshopper the
[54:23] devour and the cutter we know it's the
[54:25] same bug different stages my great Army
[54:28] which I sent among you Ezekiel 47:2 says
[54:32] then brought he me out of the way of the
[54:34] gate northward and led me about the way
[54:36] without into the utter gate by the way
[54:38] that lookth Eastward oh who's coming
[54:41] from the
[54:43] East God's coming from the
[54:45] East and behold there ran out waters on
[54:49] the right
[54:50] side and when the man that had the line
[54:53] in his hand went forth Eastward he
[54:55] measured a th cubics and he brought me
[54:57] through the water and the waters were to
[55:00] the
[55:02] ankle again he measured a th000 and
[55:05] brought me through the water in other
[55:06] words he went another thousand furlongs
[55:08] or another thousand feet can you
[55:12] say another church age or two again he
[55:17] measured a thousand and brought me
[55:19] through he brought me
[55:22] through Ezekiel son of man prophesy okay
[55:26] I am the son of man for the end
[55:30] time you are too we're the son of man
[55:33] for the end time he's not coming in any
[55:36] other flesh but our flesh you can
[55:38] swallow hard if you want to but that's
[55:40] exactly what God wants us to
[55:42] be so he brought me through the waters
[55:45] now to the
[55:47] loins oh we're getting in some deep
[55:50] water afterwards he measured another
[55:52] thousand in other words we went on in
[55:54] our journey sister Rebecca we went
[55:56] further into our journey and we're still
[55:58] in the
[56:00] water we're still in the water I don't
[56:02] want to go I went to
[56:04] swim I didn't go to Wade I am Wade I
[56:08] didn't go let's go back
[56:11] again praise the
[56:13] Lord afterwards he measured a thousand
[56:16] look at the progression he went on out
[56:19] further he took me out
[56:23] further oh praise God I didn't see that
[56:26] to just now he took me out further
[56:30] Ezekiel but yeah me who's Ezekiel
[56:32] talking to he talking to
[56:34] me and afterwards he measured a thousand
[56:36] and it was a river that I couldn't pass
[56:39] over for the waters were risen Waters to
[56:42] swim
[56:43] in a river that could not be passed over
[56:47] and he said unto me me yes son of man
[56:52] hast thou seen this nobody's ever seen
[56:55] this
[56:58] before then he brought me and caused me
[57:00] to return to the brink of the river in
[57:02] other words he took me
[57:05] back I'm sorry that's what he said he
[57:08] took me back in my memory to remember
[57:11] the journey that I
[57:13] had and how God brought me to my ankles
[57:16] he brought me to my loins he brought me
[57:18] to what a river that you what swim
[57:22] in you believe that that's three stages
[57:25] in the four St age he takes me back by
[57:27] the word of God and tells me this is
[57:30] your
[57:31] journey this is what you got to go
[57:35] through but you
[57:37] notice did you notice something in that
[57:41] passage azekel didn't
[57:43] drown he
[57:45] swam he swam back the angel took him
[57:47] back so he can swim in other words by
[57:50] that
[57:51] time you know how daddy taught us how to
[57:54] swim he took us out in the Martin hole
[57:57] throw us in the middle of it and said
[57:58] swim
[58:01] back you either do that or
[58:04] die so there's something comes up inside
[58:06] of you that says
[58:08] paddle swing your
[58:11] arms don't breathe into the water and
[58:14] you made it
[58:16] back maybe that's what God needs to do
[58:19] with us throw us out in the middle of
[58:20] the swimming hole no he didn't though
[58:22] you know what he done he took Ezekiel
[58:26] to the ankles said hey get used to
[58:30] this he took it to the loins he said hey
[58:32] get used to
[58:35] this
[58:36] right then he said hey now you know how
[58:39] to swim in other words you're acclimated
[58:41] to what I brought you here for you and I
[58:44] have a
[58:45] purpose and if you want to stay in the
[58:47] ankles that's okay but you're not going
[58:48] to get all of God you're not going to
[58:50] get all of that
[58:54] blessing huj
[58:58] this is Brother brand I'm explaining to
[58:59] the lutherans of this
[59:01] age in the sardian church age somebody
[59:04] asked him said brother R said we want
[59:05] the Holy Ghost this is Lutheran do you
[59:08] think we've got it I said potentially
[59:10] you are believing unto it he said what
[59:14] do you mean potentially we are hungry
[59:16] for God we read a book on Pentecost and
[59:18] the gifts of the Spirit so some of us
[59:20] flew to California to see the author and
[59:23] when we got there he told us that though
[59:25] he had written the book he did not have
[59:27] the
[59:28] gifts now when we saw the operation of
[59:30] the gifts in your ministry we wanted to
[59:32] talk to you for you must know something
[59:35] about them now this brother's Seminary
[59:38] is out in the country and surrounded by
[59:39] many acres of Farmland on which the
[59:42] students can work and thereby pay their
[59:44] way through
[59:46] college if we live in this day in time
[59:48] the government's just going to take care
[59:49] of
[59:53] you he also has factories that go along
[59:57] with the farm to give added employment
[59:58] so using his field to illustrate my case
[1:00:01] I said once there was a man who went
[1:00:03] forth on his own ground to plant a field
[1:00:05] of
[1:00:06] corn he pulled up the stumps cleared off
[1:00:08] the rocks in other words prepared ground
[1:00:11] plowed and disc it and then planted his
[1:00:13] corn each morning he looked out across
[1:00:15] the field but one morning instead of
[1:00:17] bearing ground he saw myriads of little
[1:00:24] blades coming up he said praise God for
[1:00:26] my Field of Corn I then asked the man I
[1:00:29] said now did the man have
[1:00:32] corn the man said to him well in one way
[1:00:35] he
[1:00:36] did I said potentially yes that was you
[1:00:39] lutherans in the
[1:00:41] Reformation putting forth your blad see
[1:00:44] the corn began to grow now listen the
[1:00:46] life that was in the corn was in those
[1:00:48] two
[1:00:49] shoots whether it was just didn't look
[1:00:52] like it at all cuz they still had
[1:00:54] doctrines and different things wasn't
[1:00:56] like the wheat that went in the ground
[1:00:57] or the of the Corn the
[1:01:01] kernel but that life had to
[1:01:04] push and then through that life came a
[1:01:06] stalk that come up and it went all the
[1:01:08] way to tassel but remember you and I are
[1:01:10] not
[1:01:11] tassel you and I are full same corn that
[1:01:15] went in the ground right now watch the
[1:01:18] corn began to grow after it had rotted
[1:01:20] in the ground during the Dark
[1:01:22] Ages right so let's read here real quick
[1:01:26] what is justification and then we'll
[1:01:28] take communion justification is what
[1:01:30] that's the outer Court remember brother
[1:01:32] R explained the court the three courts
[1:01:35] that are in the Tabernacle in the
[1:01:37] wilderness there was an outer Court you
[1:01:39] went behind a veil there was an inner
[1:01:41] Court you went behind another veil was a
[1:01:44] holy of holies all right what was the
[1:01:46] outer Court the outer Court was called
[1:01:48] actually the court of the Gentiles cuz
[1:01:50] anybody could come in Mill around do the
[1:01:53] things you need to do cuz it was outside
[1:01:57] but now you had to be a special person
[1:01:59] though to get into the next level you
[1:02:02] had to be
[1:02:04] Sanctified all right and then to get
[1:02:07] into the holy of holies only one
[1:02:09] person okay but remember that one person
[1:02:12] had to start out here walk
[1:02:15] through walk through into the holy of
[1:02:18] holies all right everybody with me now
[1:02:21] what happened in the second Veil there
[1:02:24] was a cover over it
[1:02:26] everybody with me just a
[1:02:28] minute that second veil was veiled no
[1:02:31] the outer Court anybody could see
[1:02:33] it I'll read it to you in just a minute
[1:02:35] anybody could see it walk in it it was
[1:02:37] free to come any way you wanted to
[1:02:39] that's
[1:02:40] justification you're just to be there
[1:02:43] you've been invited you've walked into
[1:02:46] the court but now to be
[1:02:49] Sanctified when you go behind that Veil
[1:02:52] only a certain member of priesthood can
[1:02:54] go into that Veil and it was artificial
[1:02:57] light but if it rained one day you
[1:03:00] didn't get wet if it thundered and
[1:03:02] lightning you didn't get wet you were
[1:03:05] covered you were
[1:03:08] Sanctified everybody with me but then
[1:03:11] outou of court if it rained you got wet
[1:03:13] if you had a bad day you had a bad
[1:03:16] day then the holy of holies was nothing
[1:03:18] but the Ark of the Covenant and that was
[1:03:21] it that's the holy of holies that's
[1:03:23] where you and God are there as person
[1:03:26] by the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said
[1:03:28] now we need to boldly enter into that
[1:03:30] Veil but we got to go through the outer
[1:03:32] Court let's listen to what brother rown
[1:03:34] says real quick a hidden life in Christ
[1:03:37] that is a real good there's about three
[1:03:38] sermons he preaches on a hidden life in
[1:03:40] Christ you ought to read them all or
[1:03:42] listen to them now that's a sign or a
[1:03:44] type of the people look the regenerated
[1:03:47] man who comes to
[1:03:50] Christ now watch gives his life in but
[1:03:54] never became get away into the Holy
[1:03:58] Spirit he lives a life that he knows
[1:04:01] he's eating Mana remember everybody ate
[1:04:02] Mana in the
[1:04:04] wilderness all right and that was a type
[1:04:06] of the what the Holy Ghost but how many
[1:04:08] made it to the promised land two out of
[1:04:10] two
[1:04:11] million all right more people did but
[1:04:14] that generation didn't make it there's
[1:04:16] many people now listen to me real quick
[1:04:18] there's many people today that's never
[1:04:20] went any further than the outer Court
[1:04:28] yet they're
[1:04:30] Christians uh by the
[1:04:33] millions you see that by the
[1:04:36] millions they enjoy Christ in an outward
[1:04:41] form they go to church with a
[1:04:43] consolation of knowing they belong to
[1:04:45] church some people don't even have that
[1:04:47] Revelation but they have never become
[1:04:50] hid away with him in the inner
[1:04:53] courts h
[1:04:57] same same
[1:04:58] message another thing we'll call your
[1:05:00] attention just before we close look at
[1:05:02] the light on the outside in the courts
[1:05:04] that was the firmament that L it up now
[1:05:06] remember this is Luther's
[1:05:09] age all
[1:05:12] right got it
[1:05:14] justification look at the light on the
[1:05:16] outside of the Court it was the
[1:05:18] firmament that Lit it up sunlight and so
[1:05:20] forth some days was
[1:05:22] cloudy some days the sun didn't shine at
[1:05:25] all
[1:05:26] some days it was dark now that's in the
[1:05:28] outer
[1:05:32] Court everybody remember outter Court
[1:05:35] inner Court holy of holies the outter
[1:05:36] Court Martin Luther justification you
[1:05:39] were just to be there but now remember
[1:05:41] if you stayed out there you didn't get
[1:05:44] Sanctified if you stayed out here I mean
[1:05:47] we have bad days and good days but
[1:05:49] that's on the outward person that inward
[1:05:51] person inside of you should be
[1:05:54] absolutely
[1:05:56] I'm
[1:05:58] Overjoyed with being a Christian not
[1:06:01] just going through and making it barely
[1:06:04] getting
[1:06:08] by you got to go in that next
[1:06:11] Veil cuz that's getting you closer to
[1:06:13] God the outer Court the inner Court
[1:06:17] which will be John
[1:06:19] Wesley all right then the holy of holies
[1:06:22] will be Pentecost or receiving the
[1:06:24] baptism of the ho ghost all right we'll
[1:06:27] get into that a little bit later when we
[1:06:28] get back to the next one but in the
[1:06:30] outer Court that's what Luther was the
[1:06:32] outer
[1:06:33] Court you know he could drink a beer and
[1:06:36] smoke a pipe he could he could believe
[1:06:38] in a trinitarian Doctrine but God winked
[1:06:40] at that ignorance and he said that's my
[1:06:43] man for the day that's my man that I
[1:06:46] need in that court for the time you and
[1:06:51] I have to go if you're a Christian today
[1:06:53] you got to go through that Court
[1:06:56] you got to believe that you've left
[1:06:59] whatever you did you've left behind yes
[1:07:02] sir but remember if you stay in that
[1:07:04] Court you're going to get it
[1:07:11] again you got to go into the next court
[1:07:14] in there where you're what got some
[1:07:20] cover so now let's read just real quick
[1:07:23] Revelation 6 ver5 now when he had opened
[1:07:25] the Third third seal now we're into the
[1:07:27] fifth Church age everybody with me for a
[1:07:29] minute all right when he had opened the
[1:07:32] third seal I heard the third Beast which
[1:07:33] was what the man lion ox man we got one
[1:07:37] more to go the eagle come and see and I
[1:07:40] beheld in L Black Horse and he that sat
[1:07:42] on him had a pair of balances in in his
[1:07:44] hand and I heard the voice in the midst
[1:07:46] of the four beast and I want you to
[1:07:48] realize something this is not a beast
[1:07:51] talking
[1:07:56] all right hold
[1:07:57] on and when he had opened the third seal
[1:08:00] I heard the third
[1:08:02] Beast say come and see everybody with me
[1:08:06] all right now beheld in L black horse
[1:08:08] this is John he that s on him had a pair
[1:08:10] of balances and I Heard a Voice in the
[1:08:13] midst of the four
[1:08:15] beasts not one of the
[1:08:19] four this was Jesus Christ
[1:08:22] himself telling you this journey is
[1:08:25] getting ready to be now a fulfilled age
[1:08:29] not an unfulfilled age I'm going to give
[1:08:31] you power that I've never give you power
[1:08:34] before CU what does he say do a measure
[1:08:36] of wheat for a penny and three measures
[1:08:38] of barley for a penny and look and see
[1:08:41] thou hurt not the oil and the wine my
[1:08:46] Holy Ghost is going to make you get you
[1:08:51] through see thou hurt not the oil and
[1:08:54] the wine this was Jesus himself if
[1:08:56] you'll read in the church ages or in the
[1:08:58] seal book brother Brown I'm tell you
[1:09:00] that's what who that was I that's not a
[1:09:01] revelation I got it's already in Seal
[1:09:03] book he said that was a different voice
[1:09:06] he said that was the voice of Jesus
[1:09:07] Christ or the voice of the
[1:09:09] Lord what saying hey I'm going to get
[1:09:13] you through
[1:09:14] this you're going to make it don't hurt
[1:09:17] my oil and
[1:09:19] wine to the third seal now the lamb got
[1:09:22] the book in his hand breaking the seal
[1:09:24] broke the first one second and now he
[1:09:25] breaks the third one and as he breaks it
[1:09:27] the lamb breaks it the third seal the
[1:09:29] third Beast now who was the third Beast
[1:09:31] that was the man how many knows what the
[1:09:33] third Beast look like look like a man
[1:09:35] first one look a line second one a calf
[1:09:38] or an ox the third one look like a man
[1:09:40] as a man and he heard the living
[1:09:42] creatures the Beast living creatures
[1:09:43] like a man say to John come and see what
[1:09:45] it is the mystery that's been HIIT all
[1:09:47] down through the years of look of
[1:09:50] redemption he's fixing to bring back the
[1:09:53] full picture of redemption how we come
[1:09:56] from a sinner to a saint he's going to
[1:10:00] show that to us in the seals all down
[1:10:03] through the years of redemption since
[1:10:04] the foundation of the world it's been
[1:10:06] hid under this seal what's going to
[1:10:09] happen now come look what it is and so
[1:10:11] he opens it up a thunder blast and the
[1:10:13] lamb opens a seal now John walked up to
[1:10:16] see what it would be what' he see he
[1:10:18] seen a black horse and his rider had a
[1:10:20] balance or scales in his hand now that's
[1:10:22] the first thing he saw when the lamb
[1:10:24] announced it broke the to seal the other
[1:10:26] Beast see them other beasts are taking
[1:10:28] turns about announcing turns about lion
[1:10:31] ox man Eagle Eagle not come yet but the
[1:10:34] man is announcing now and John where
[1:10:36] he's standing maybe like this he walks
[1:10:38] over when the lamb opens it walks over
[1:10:41] and usually the Thunder strikes as we
[1:10:42] seen in the first seal what the Thunder
[1:10:45] is a Ministry it's something that's
[1:10:47] never before been been spoken it's
[1:10:49] spoken now usually the Thunder strikes
[1:10:52] as we see in the first seal and we watch
[1:10:54] and he watched just to see what takes
[1:10:56] place he's seen a man coming first on a
[1:10:57] white horse watch him ride down and
[1:11:00] through John sees him Plumb to the end
[1:11:02] he sees him come down his White Horse
[1:11:03] got a bow the rider he has no arrows and
[1:11:06] the next thing he sees he gets a crown
[1:11:08] rides on through then we find out then
[1:11:10] the lamb here he comes and he opens
[1:11:12] another one now here comes a red horse
[1:11:14] all right we've already been through
[1:11:16] this and this man has a sword in his
[1:11:17] hand he rides right on down through the
[1:11:19] scriptures see with a sword and was to
[1:11:21] kill and take peace from the earth now
[1:11:24] the lamb opens another seal another one
[1:11:27] of the living creatures like a man said
[1:11:28] come and see now he walks up to see what
[1:11:31] this is and when he does there comes a
[1:11:33] rider on a black horse now last night we
[1:11:36] find out that the same Rider that rode
[1:11:38] the White Horse on the red one and he's
[1:11:40] going to be on the black one so it's the
[1:11:42] same devil right all right the voice in
[1:11:45] the midst of the beast called out you
[1:11:46] see to come see what it was he was in
[1:11:48] this living creature and he saw this
[1:11:50] black horse and when the voice in the
[1:11:52] midst of the four beast called out a
[1:11:53] measure of wheat for pinning a measure
[1:11:55] of or barley for a penny but see thou
[1:11:56] hurt not the oil and the wine this
[1:11:59] writer let's discuss him if you notice
[1:12:02] the first out a riter who he was the
[1:12:05] second riter we found out who he was he
[1:12:07] was same
[1:12:08] man what happened he changed his
[1:12:12] ministry same devil but what happens see
[1:12:15] when God changes he doesn't change his
[1:12:16] word but he develops more remember
[1:12:19] ankles knees
[1:12:20] thins he's moving you through to higher
[1:12:24] Revelation well guess what Satan's right
[1:12:26] there
[1:12:27] behind he changed his ministry we found
[1:12:31] out he was an antichrist and he changed
[1:12:33] his position we found out that when he
[1:12:36] first just was a white horse he became a
[1:12:39] Doctrine now we're taking everyone right
[1:12:41] back to the scriptures all right now
[1:12:43] those four seal now remember now in the
[1:12:45] first age was line that was a line of
[1:12:47] trib of Judah Christ his own influence
[1:12:49] of life was taken in that age that's the
[1:12:52] first piece which means power that
[1:12:54] answered by human voice oh had to come
[1:12:57] to a human being the next age was the ox
[1:13:01] or the dark horse riders age now the
[1:13:03] reason this first age was a white
[1:13:05] age I've always heard people say that
[1:13:08] the writer white was the power of the
[1:13:09] church that went forth to conquer we
[1:13:11] find out he was given a crown what it
[1:13:13] was now remember everybody's explaining
[1:13:15] it but brother brandom comes back and
[1:13:17] says uh that's not the church that's the
[1:13:19] demon that's the devil all right now the
[1:13:21] second age was a red horse which was a
[1:13:24] dark age age or dark times the Dark Ages
[1:13:26] all
[1:13:28] right now the black horse rider that was
[1:13:30] the Antichrist but the one that was
[1:13:32] speaking in that age was represented as
[1:13:35] a
[1:13:36] man and that's the wisdom smart and
[1:13:40] shrewdness of a man let's go back to the
[1:13:42] fourth
[1:13:44] seal I'm going to sum it all up right
[1:13:46] here and then we'll take
[1:13:48] communion now brother rown comes and he
[1:13:50] puts every this together this is in the
[1:13:52] fourth seal now notice the last part of
[1:13:55] verse eight while we're closing power
[1:13:56] was given unto them who is them all
[1:13:59] right Antichrist called death and Hell
[1:14:01] Followed watch his four point scheme
[1:14:04] then we'll back up again in this age of
[1:14:07] sardian church age the Antichrist White
[1:14:09] Horse kills by spirit being Antichrist
[1:14:13] spiritual kill right he spiritually
[1:14:16] started killing the people by the
[1:14:17] doctrine but he's going to physically
[1:14:19] kill them in the in the fourth Church
[1:14:21] age all right number two red horse kills
[1:14:24] by sword iCal power when church and
[1:14:26] state United just like I told you before
[1:14:29] black horse Souls when he gave out his
[1:14:31] Doctrine and she did there with her
[1:14:33] fornications he weighed out the food
[1:14:35] sold them listen that black
[1:14:40] horse started in the Dark Ages we know
[1:14:43] they lapped over everybody with me real
[1:14:46] quick all right but what happened you
[1:14:49] say well black horse should have been in
[1:14:50] the Dark Ages like I said before God
[1:14:52] didn't ask you your opinion that black
[1:14:55] horse is when they started calling
[1:14:56] theirself Baptist and thinking they were
[1:15:00] bride Lutheran not him Luther but
[1:15:03] Lutheran and they call theirself bride
[1:15:05] that's the darkness that's if the light
[1:15:07] in you be Darkness how great is that
[1:15:09] darkness that black horse was telling
[1:15:12] the people you're
[1:15:14] good just pay the no venas just do the
[1:15:17] right thing food what is food food is
[1:15:20] Ministry food is stored up food brother
[1:15:22] R said eat this food well Satan said e
[1:15:25] this food

[1:15:29] balance and the pennies and so forth and
[1:15:31] then the fourth we'll read him in in the
[1:15:34] last Church age a Pale Horse Eternal
[1:15:37] separation from
[1:15:39] God when lust is
[1:15:42] conceived it brings forth sin When sin
[1:15:46] is
[1:15:47] finished it brings forth Eternal
[1:15:49] separation from God anytime listen but
[1:15:52] listen listen listen real quick
[1:15:55] anytime in between that you can say you
[1:15:57] can stop and say God forgive
[1:16:00] me I
[1:16:02] Repent I don't want to go any further on
[1:16:04] that
[1:16:06] anymore but when lust is conceived it
[1:16:08] brings forth sin when sin's
[1:16:12] finished it brings forth
[1:16:15] death Eternal separation from
[1:16:18] god let's stay in
[1:16:21] God God forgive me if I'm in the outer
[1:16:24] Court
[1:16:25] please lead me into the inner
[1:16:28] Court let's stand let's get ready to
[1:16:30] take
[1:16:32] commune that fifth Church age was so
[1:16:35] important God poured out all this
[1:16:37] information from the prophet that said
[1:16:39] this is one of the most important men
[1:16:42] because if there had not been a
[1:16:44] Reformation there would have never been
[1:16:47] a restoration had to start somewhere
[1:16:51] sometime everybody with me all right so
[1:16:54] God was pleased to dwell in that little
[1:16:56] two shoots listen that's the same life
[1:17:00] it come out of the
[1:17:02] Corn it just wasn't
[1:17:05] mature but it was a corn
[1:17:08] plant it had life in it but it wasn't to
[1:17:12] full
[1:17:13] maturity we've come to now to where it's
[1:17:15] not even the tassel the tassel looked
[1:17:18] somewhat like the corn of wheat but
[1:17:22] brother brand says it's a protector but
[1:17:25] when you take and do this right here go
[1:17:26] in the field of wheat it looks like
[1:17:28] wheat growing that's not the wheat the
[1:17:30] wheat's inside of it we put it together
[1:17:32] and do like that and you've got wheat
[1:17:33] the chaff goes
[1:17:36] away that's what God done through First
[1:17:38] Church age he took it all the way
[1:17:40] through and he and they died in the Dark
[1:17:42] Ages but he said I will
[1:17:45] restore I'm going to bring it back not
[1:17:48] now what went in the
[1:17:50] ground the son of man went in the
[1:17:53] ground the revelation of the son Jesus
[1:17:56] was the son of man come on somebody
[1:17:57] somebody say Amen okay you fix it open
[1:18:00] your mouth and take communion you open
[1:18:01] your mouth and say
[1:18:02] Amen or owe me whichever one you want to
[1:18:05] do but that was Jesus Christ he got put
[1:18:07] in the ground that was the son of man
[1:18:09] right all right well he rose back up
[1:18:12] come on the day of Pentecost though as a
[1:18:15] spirit God the Son of God the flesh God
[1:18:17] is still somewhere up in another
[1:18:18] dimension is everybody with me this is
[1:18:20] the message so he walks through the
[1:18:23] church ages allows things like this to
[1:18:27] happen to prove that he's God and he's
[1:18:30] gracious he's got more grace than you
[1:18:32] and I
[1:18:34] got he's gracious to these people to let
[1:18:36] them not get
[1:18:39] by but for them to lit a piece of the
[1:18:42] word a piece of the word a piece of the
[1:18:44] word a piece of the word but remember
[1:18:47] whatever went in the ground if it got
[1:18:49] put in the ground it's got to come back
[1:18:51] up all right so it hit went in the
[1:18:53] ground in isah it in the ground in the
[1:18:55] Dark Ages all right that Revelation was
[1:19:00] gone but when you come back you got to
[1:19:03] go back to the corn what was it that was
[1:19:05] the son of man they put in the ground so
[1:19:07] it's got to be the son of man Revelation
[1:19:09] while we're here in the end time right
[1:19:11] back to the same he said I will restore
[1:19:13] or in other words I will repay you
[1:19:16] that's why this journey this journey is
[1:19:19] hard but look at the end results eternal
[1:19:23] life nothing on this Earth is eternal is
[1:19:27] that me and
[1:19:28] you nothing on the outside I was
[1:19:31] thinking
[1:19:32] yesterday you know how much trouble and
[1:19:34] trials we got and all the aches and
[1:19:35] pains and all the stuff the Bible says
[1:19:38] all things will be made
[1:19:41] new brother random even says one time he
[1:19:44] says all wrongs will be made
[1:19:47] right could you imagine walking through
[1:19:49] a
[1:19:53] day with no worries at
[1:19:56] all
[1:19:59] none not an
[1:20:02] ache not a
[1:20:04] pain there won't be no grunting in
[1:20:07] heaven when we get up we grunt
[1:20:11] oh we Danny we oh there won't be any of
[1:20:15] that think about you can't fathom
[1:20:18] that but that thing inside of you has
[1:20:20] already made it to that
[1:20:23] point that thing inside of you is
[1:20:25] already Eternal it doesn't GRT when it
[1:20:27] gets up it's 20 years old it doesn't
[1:20:30] even sleep now explain that to me I
[1:20:32] don't understand it but your your
[1:20:34] theophany your soul doesn't go to sleep
[1:20:37] to prove that is you have dreams and I
[1:20:38] don't know where all them goofy things I
[1:20:40] have come from but uh it comes from that
[1:20:42] subconscious somewhere but there's an
[1:20:44] inside down on the inside that may one
[1:20:46] night tell you at 2:00 in the morning
[1:20:49] pray for so and
[1:20:50] so wake you right up and sit you right
[1:20:53] up out of the bed and say pray for so
[1:20:54] and so so listen that ain't the devil
[1:20:57] the devil will never wake you up and ask
[1:20:59] you to pray for somebody I'll promise
[1:21:00] you that I you can be a sure that's not
[1:21:03] going to happen so if something happens
[1:21:05] in your life and you have to get up and
[1:21:07] something says pray for brother kerna
[1:21:09] you you better start
[1:21:11] praying pray for him cuz like I said the

[1:21:15] put you in a he'll put you in a coma he
[1:21:18] keep you from getting up to pray God
[1:21:20] hates it when we pray I mean Satan hates
[1:21:22] it when we pray God loves it when we
[1:21:24] pray amen let's take communion
[1:21:27] let's excuse me let's read our
[1:21:31] scripture they get pulled up for me or I
[1:21:33] can get it about lost my
[1:21:40] voice 1 Corinthians
[1:21:42] 11 we come to a time
[1:21:45] that I know I talked to a man not long
[1:21:48] ago
[1:21:49] and and he said oh I don't take
[1:21:51] communion anymore he
[1:21:53] said he said
[1:21:55] the Lord's already
[1:21:59] come I said
[1:22:02] okay I said well he said he drink it
[1:22:04] with us in in his father's Kingdom and I
[1:22:07] thought this was the father's
[1:22:09] Kingdom and he said on the he said
[1:22:11] before that he said I'm not going to
[1:22:13] drink of this until I get to that place
[1:22:17] well is he walking around here today is
[1:22:19] he literally drinking no he's not
[1:22:22] here the brother said oh I said a death
[1:22:25] ordinance I said so is salvation so is
[1:22:28] water baptism so is this and so is that
[1:22:33] this whole thing's got to do with death
[1:22:35] but from death comes
[1:22:37] life and we do these ordinances because
[1:22:40] God I I told him I said brother if you
[1:22:42] can tell me where they got took
[1:22:44] out I can tell you where they got put in
[1:22:47] right there in Corinthians but tell me
[1:22:49] where God took them out that we're not
[1:22:50] supposed to do it we're supposed to come
[1:22:52] to this great you know he thought we
[1:22:53] were this great level up here that we
[1:22:55] didn't need
[1:22:56] it I need a cleansing those listen the
[1:23:00] the
[1:23:02] apostles it says in here sometimes they
[1:23:04] took communion
[1:23:06] daily they believed in it they believed
[1:23:09] in communion and they were there and
[1:23:10] they heard what he said they knew they
[1:23:13] needed
[1:23:14] it so do we for I received of the Lord
[1:23:18] that which also I delivered unto you
[1:23:19] that the Lord Jesus the same night in
[1:23:21] which he was betrayed took bread and
[1:23:23] when he had given thanks he break it and
[1:23:24] said take eat this is my body which is
[1:23:26] broken for you this do you in
[1:23:28] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:23:31] also he took the cup when he had up
[1:23:33] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[1:23:35] my blood we've been through that
[1:23:37] before the New Testament death of the
[1:23:40] testator he was getting ready to die and
[1:23:41] there was a New Covenant coming there
[1:23:43] was a new testament coming this do you
[1:23:45] as often as you drink it in remembrance
[1:23:47] of me for as often as you eat this bread
[1:23:49] and drink this cup you do show the
[1:23:50] Lord's death till he comes well amen
[1:23:54] amen man I wanted somebody to die for me
[1:23:56] I needed somebody to die for me but not
[1:23:59] just a regular man brother John I need
[1:24:00] somebody to die that had eternal life
[1:24:03] that can come back inside of me and make
[1:24:04] me
[1:24:07] eternal wherefore whosoever shall eat
[1:24:09] this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:24:11] Lord listen it's just people get lazy in
[1:24:13] the end time they think they're so high
[1:24:15] revelated they don't even have to come
[1:24:16] to church they don't have to have this I
[1:24:18] don't know where anywhere where God told
[1:24:20] us to when we become Christians to quit
[1:24:22] doing stuff that he told us to do
[1:24:24] amen he even told us I told the brother
[1:24:26] I said what about foot washing he said
[1:24:28] you don't have no part with me if you
[1:24:29] don't wash feet oh that's all just
[1:24:31] that's that's all uh you know
[1:24:35] they it's like the Bible says they
[1:24:38] counted of none effect they don't think
[1:24:40] it they need
[1:24:42] it I need it wherefore whosoever shall
[1:24:46] eat this bread and drink this cup of the
[1:24:47] Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the
[1:24:49] body and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:24:51] examine himself we're going to stop a
[1:24:53] moment and we're we're going to take a
[1:24:54] moment of Silent prayer you examine
[1:24:58] yourself and you know what there's a
[1:25:00] there's a guy inside of you beside of
[1:25:02] you
[1:25:03] easy that that's going to say you're not
[1:25:08] worthy you you said something to your
[1:25:10] neighbor you wasn't supposed to you you
[1:25:13] talked about the preacher you that's the
[1:25:18] devil but if it is God say God forgive
[1:25:20] me I'm sorry for what I did I'll make it
[1:25:22] all right right
[1:25:25] and forget about the devil cuz he's
[1:25:26] going to keep coming at
[1:25:28] you it's like somebody told us one time
[1:25:31] said um if you have to wait till you can
[1:25:35] afford to have kids you'll never have
[1:25:37] kids right if you say I'm going to wait
[1:25:39] till this point well same way with
[1:25:41] taking communion if you're going to wait
[1:25:42] till you're good enough you'll never
[1:25:44] take
[1:25:45] it
[1:25:48] am but there is a way to get here to
[1:25:51] take
[1:25:52] it let a man examine himself and so let
[1:25:56] him eat of that bread he didn't say
[1:25:58] examine yourself and then no sorry can't
[1:26:00] do it he said and so let him eat of that
[1:26:03] bread and drink of that
[1:26:05] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[1:26:08] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[1:26:10] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[1:26:12] body but for this cause many are weak
[1:26:14] and sickly among you and many sleep for
[1:26:16] if we would judge ourselves we should
[1:26:18] not be judged but when we are judged we
[1:26:21] are chasen to the Lord that we should
[1:26:22] not be condemned with the world I see he
[1:26:25] separated us from that wherefore my
[1:26:27] brethren when you come together to eat t
[1:26:29] one for another and if any man hunger
[1:26:32] let him eat at home in other words those
[1:26:33] Corinthians they were making a feast out
[1:26:35] of it they were getting drunk at the
[1:26:37] table saying this is the Lord's supper
[1:26:39] and we're eating you know beans and
[1:26:40] potatoes and corn and mutton and and
[1:26:43] lamb and all this stuff and we just
[1:26:45] getting drunk that's what they that was
[1:26:46] their interpretation of what Paul said
[1:26:48] well Paul had to come back and said no
[1:26:50] that's not it if you want to eat
[1:26:51] somewhere go eat at home
[1:26:54] this is not
[1:26:55] eating this is communing this is
[1:26:58] fellowshipping with God and if any man
[1:27:00] hungry let him meet at home that you
[1:27:01] come not into condemnation and the rest
[1:27:03] will I set in order when I come Paul
[1:27:06] said he'd do that this do in remembrance
[1:27:08] of me let's take a
[1:27:11] moment a silent
[1:27:14] prayer get slate
[1:27:16] clean say God from this day forward I'm
[1:27:18] going to be better I'm going to do

[1:34:15] father had given all things into his
[1:34:16] hands and he was come from God and he
[1:34:18] went to
[1:34:20] God he rises from supper and laid aside
[1:34:22] His Garment and took a towel towel and
[1:34:24] girded himself after that he poured
[1:34:26] water into a basin began to wash the
[1:34:28] disciples feet and to wipe them with a
[1:34:30] towel for with he was girded then cometh
[1:34:33] he to Simon Peter and Peter said unto
[1:34:35] him Lord does thou wash my feet question
[1:34:37] mark he's asking him Jesus said what I
[1:34:39] do thou knowest not now but Thou shalt
[1:34:41] know
[1:34:43] Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt
[1:34:45] never wash my feet Jesus answered and
[1:34:47] said if I wash thee not thou Hast no
[1:34:49] part with me Simon Peter said Lord not
[1:34:52] only my feet but also my my hands and my

[1:35:10] feet so after he had washed their feet
[1:35:13] and had taken His Garment and was sat
[1:35:14] down again he said unto

[1:35:28] was many times he said don't worship me
[1:35:29] worship God but right here he knew it

[1:36:52] Bride Satan's going to do all he can to
