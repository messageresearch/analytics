[8:50] the son of sh sh shtiel says the Lord

[9:04] so our title tonight is the signate out
[9:07] of babyon you may have your
[9:10] seats let me start my
[9:15] clock all because I said it for like
[9:18] three hours so the the early the early I
[9:23] start the better it
[9:25] is I'm not going to mention names but
[9:28] God bless you all really appreciate you
[9:30] I really appreciate all the brothers and
[9:33] the ministers that come out of this
[9:34] church amen I I was back there back
[9:37] there I was calling him the beer he
[9:39] backs all these good
[9:40] ministers from his hands so um I said
[9:46] bring you greetings from my pastor
[9:47] brother Barry coffee uh he says I should
[9:49] greet the church and my family I came
[9:52] with my wife today but she had a
[9:54] headache and you know with two kids long
[9:57] drive so I had she had to stay at the
[9:59] hotel but she really wanted to be here
[10:01] tonight so she I believe she's streaming
[10:04] and send you greetings so we we just go
[10:07] straight to the word of God so from the
[10:09] scripture that we read the Bible here is
[10:12] the prophet Hagi and I like these uh
[10:15] minor they call them Minor
[10:17] Prophets but that's just it's something
[10:20] that you know the scholars use in in
[10:24] order to distinguish between the 12 uh
[10:27] small books and the other large ones
[10:30] like Ezekiel but you don't find anything
[10:33] in the Bible that says major prophet or
[10:35] minor Prophet that is just for our
[10:39] reference just so that you know it's
[10:41] easy to explain but before God a prophet
[10:44] is a prophet in Israel you know they say
[10:48] Zechariah was a prophet Hagi was a
[10:51] prophet they don't like to the Jewish
[10:53] rabis they don't like to say minor and
[10:55] major but we just use it and it's it's
[10:57] fine you know but
[10:59] it's it's so so so these most of these
[11:02] Minor Prophets they prophesied during
[11:04] the time of the rebuilding of the of
[11:07] Jerusalem and the rebuilding of the
[11:09] temple amen and one of the scriptures
[11:12] says all Israel believe God trust in him
[11:15] and you shall be established believe His
[11:18] prophets and you shall prosper in other
[11:21] words God was saying for the work that
[11:23] you need to do of rebuilding the temple
[11:26] you need to trust God and you need to
[11:28] believe his prophets in other words they
[11:31] were not they were not going to be able
[11:33] to do the work of rebuilding without the
[11:36] blessing of the prophets without the
[11:38] supervision of the prophets because it
[11:41] was the prophets because the prophets
[11:43] are the eyes praise the Lord am the last
[11:46] time we were here remember we were
[11:47] talking about it was the Lord's doing
[11:49] and it is marvelous in our eyes so today
[11:52] it's kind of like in a similar
[11:53] inspiration has been you know laid upon
[11:55] my heart to study a little bit on
[11:57] zerubba Bell and and the real building
[11:59] and now now this character of zerubabel
[12:02] who is zerubabel now zerubabel means
[12:06] zerubabel which means one that is born
[12:09] out of Babylon praise the name of the
[12:11] Lord so zerubabel is born out of Babylon
[12:14] because remember when they went into
[12:16] Babylon because they disobeyed the word
[12:19] of the Lord they went into Babylon and
[12:21] some of them they got these Babylonian
[12:23] names and you know and and it took the
[12:26] Holy Ghost to to help them I remember
[12:29] who they were they had lost some of them
[12:32] were losing their identity you know they
[12:35] thought they were Babylonian some of
[12:36] them they thought they were they were
[12:38] just Americans or Africans they forgot
[12:40] that they were sons of of God they
[12:43] forgot that they were God's elect and
[12:46] many times the devil does that you know
[12:49] the first thing when when he took the
[12:51] that the wise children from from Judah
[12:54] he changed their names and he said You
[12:56] shall be called Baza you shall be called
[13:00] Shadrach mishek and abedo but those were
[13:02] not their names it was the devil who was
[13:06] trying to erase their identity because
[13:09] that's what the devil does you know he
[13:11] will take your eyes like Samson because
[13:13] you know remember Samson you know they
[13:16] took out his eyes when they took the
[13:18] eyes of Samson he began to entertain
[13:21] them so whenever a prophet is removed
[13:24] whenever a people they lose you know a
[13:27] prophet sometimes you know religion
[13:29] becomes entertainment they lose their
[13:32] identity so but Daniel he made sure that
[13:35] he does not lose his identity because he
[13:38] was reading the words of Jeremiah the
[13:41] prophet Hallelujah because it's very
[13:45] easy to be comfortable in Babylon yes so
[13:48] zerubabel was born out of Babylon
[13:51] because he was a symbol of a prophet
[13:54] that comes out of a gentile out of the
[13:56] Gentiles how many knows that amen
[13:58] because we have the Bible is written
[14:01] it's a prophetic book amen it's not you
[14:04] know a literal book that you read like a
[14:05] novel that's right like Daniel David
[14:08] could be going up the mountains and he
[14:10] would say my Lord my Lord why has Thou
[14:12] forsaken me it was David saying those
[14:15] words but it was a prophecy of Christ
[14:18] that was going to come amen hallelujah
[14:21] and David you know you would say things
[14:23] in the Psalms but then those things were
[14:26] prophesying of things that were going to
[14:28] come so you look at these characters in
[14:30] The Bible you know they were playing a
[14:33] drama because it's a God's you know it's
[14:35] it's it's a it's a it's a it's a story
[14:37] of redemption amen you know so so when
[14:40] we read these characters remember the
[14:42] scriptures they repeat themselves the
[14:44] scriptures have compound meaning so
[14:47] zerubabel was from the tribe of Judah
[14:51] and zerubabel they call him a prince
[14:53] because he was born from the tribe of
[14:55] Judah and really he could have been you
[14:57] know the best the next person to be in
[14:59] line to be the king and if you read the
[15:02] Gen the genealogy of Jesus Christ you'll
[15:05] find that in the Book of Luke it traces
[15:08] Christ through Mary through Nathan the
[15:11] son of David right and in the Book of
[15:13] Matthew it it traces Christ through
[15:16] Joseph the father through the through
[15:18] through Solomon the son of David is that
[15:21] correct so these are different by but
[15:23] they merge at zerubabel amen so
[15:26] zerubabel is a very interesting
[15:29] character because there were different
[15:31] people that were sent to re to rebuild
[15:34] Jerusalem and the temple I believe we
[15:36] spoke about that there was Ezra who went
[15:38] with with with a group there was
[15:40] Nehemiah that went with another group
[15:42] and then there was there was zerubabel
[15:45] who went with Joshua the high
[15:47] priest and Joshua how many remembers the
[15:50] story he has his clothes were filthy and
[15:53] he was not even qualified and the devil
[15:55] was there to accuse him and God says I
[15:57] have cleansed him
[15:59] he's a branch that is snatched from the
[16:01] fire Hallelujah so zerubabel then he
[16:05] goes and and God is saying here through
[16:08] hagay the prophet he says I'm going to
[16:10] take you zerubabel my
[16:13] servant but though you are my servant
[16:16] I'm going to make you as a
[16:19] Signet now what is a Signet a Signet is
[16:23] a ring how many knows
[16:26] that when the president of the United
[16:29] States President Donald Trump is
[16:30] speaking or he's writing letters or he's
[16:33] you know issuing you know his uh
[16:35] proclamations or is they call them
[16:37] executive orders he has to write them
[16:40] with the Seal of the United States so
[16:43] what what he says then it's no longer
[16:45] him saying it but it's we say it's the
[16:48] United States saying this we say
[16:51] Washington is saying this because that
[16:53] letter is the Seal of the United States
[16:57] back then you know the Kings and the
[16:59] Nobles they would they would seal
[17:02] documents with a with a with a with with
[17:04] a seal with with a signature with a
[17:05] stamp but then for East they would put
[17:08] it into a ring that will show you the
[17:11] ring and then they would put hot waxs
[17:14] and then they would what they would put
[17:16] the stamp and then that becomes the seal
[17:19] amen so each family has its seal each
[17:22] tribe has it's it's seal amen and I
[17:24] would be interested to see the Wade seal
[17:29] you know hallelujah praise the Lord so
[17:32] so zerubabel God is saying so now a seal
[17:35] then becomes a symbol of
[17:37] authority a seal a seal or a signate
[17:41] becomes a symbol of ownership that's
[17:44] what the prophet says the prophet says a
[17:46] seal is a symbol of ownership if you
[17:49] break the seal you you you have that
[17:52] that becomes something that becomes
[17:54] yours Hallelujah so the the seal becomes
[17:57] the symbol of of or finality when God is
[18:00] saying I have sent this man this is what
[18:03] I want he is saying I am making him my
[18:06] signant am hallelujah amen because he is
[18:10] a servant but he's also a signant now
[18:13] that's a very delicate balance to
[18:15] understand because some people may think
[18:17] he's God he's not God but some people
[18:19] may think he's just like any other
[18:21] person no he's not he's a servant but
[18:23] he's a signant amen hallelujah amen it's
[18:26] like God saying you know there was a man
[18:29] sent from God his name was John amen he
[18:32] was a man but he was sent from God so
[18:35] you got to have the balance if you lean
[18:36] on one side you've got a problem if you
[18:39] lean On The Other Extreme you've got a
[18:41] problem Hallelujah so if you lean on one
[18:44] side and you say oh the brother Bram is
[18:47] a is is God you're wrong come on brother
[18:49] if you lean on this other extreme and
[18:51] you say it's just like any other gift in
[18:52] the fivefold ministry that's also wrong
[18:55] because a prophet is called above the
[18:58] other ministers because the word of the
[19:00] Lord comes to a
[19:03] prophet Hallelujah can you say amen amen
[19:06] so we have three Babylons in the Bible
[19:09] so this zerubabel now before we get to
[19:12] you know this zerubabel is a type of the
[19:15] end time Prophet now the prophet tells
[19:17] us this in the message called the
[19:19] message of Grace right because zerubabel
[19:22] was a builder M Ezra was a builder
[19:26] Nehemiah was a builder and they were
[19:28] building different things some were
[19:30] building the Temple some were building
[19:32] the walls some it was a restoration of
[19:34] worship come on Brother come on just
[19:36] like you know so there were four
[19:39] four there were four stages of the
[19:41] Locust that came to destroy so God send
[19:45] different stages right Ezra neiah Zer
[19:49] Joshua it was not one person doing the
[19:51] work it was it was done in different
[19:54] stages and you find that even when they
[19:56] went it was different decrees that send
[19:59] them back to build and the prophet when
[20:01] he preached the 70 weeks of Daniel he
[20:04] had to be very specific of the decree by
[20:07] which we started to calculate the 70
[20:09] weeks because there were multiple
[20:11] decrees because there were different
[20:13] stages Hallelujah so the story of
[20:16] restoration the caterpillar the canker
[20:19] worm the Palmer worm and the lockers the
[20:21] four horses how many knows that amen and
[20:23] then the restoration comes with Martin
[20:25] Luther he does one part and then John
[20:28] Wesley comes it does another part he
[20:30] restores Holiness in the church he
[20:32] restores sanctification in the church
[20:35] Martin Luther restores grace through
[20:38] faith Hallelujah and then the
[20:40] Pentecostals they come they restore the
[20:42] gifts in the church and when the gifts
[20:45] are restored the Church is not yet
[20:47] complete then you need the seed which is
[20:50] the spoken word then for you to have the
[20:52] word you need to have a prophet am then
[20:55] God sends Elijah to restore the fullness
[20:58] of the word back in the church so we
[21:01] can't go back to gifts because if we if
[21:04] gifts was the climax then God did not
[21:07] need to send a prophet after
[21:09] Aza the prophet was sent after Aza
[21:12] because Aza was not the final stage
[21:16] because the prophet says that you see it
[21:18] says the Pentecost is a type of Mary
[21:22] y because remember Mary left Jesus at
[21:26] the Feast of Pentecost right when he she
[21:29] denied the supernatural birth amen when
[21:31] she says I and your father were looking
[21:33] for you and the word corrects the error
[21:36] amen amen he never said my mother he
[21:40] says woman I have to be at my father's
[21:42] business Hallelujah so the Pentecostals
[21:45] they were hugging the seed but it was
[21:48] not the true seed because the gifts are
[21:51] not everything because remember Abraham
[21:54] had other Sons like ishma and other sons
[21:56] from from with with k how many knows
[21:59] that and the Bible says that he gave
[22:01] them gifts and he sent them away but
[22:04] unto Isaac he gave him everything that
[22:07] he had so the love of God to the church
[22:10] is not on gifts but it's through
[22:12] election amen amen that's why the Bible
[22:16] says to the elect lady amen the love of
[22:19] God the prophet says in the church ages
[22:21] is elective
[22:23] love how great The Father's Love how
[22:27] vast Beyond his
[22:29] measure John says behold what manner of
[22:31] love the father has bestowed upon us
[22:34] that we must be called the Sons of the
[22:36] Living God God's love is not it's not
[22:39] it's not manifest by billions of dollars
[22:42] it's not manifest by by cars and houses
[22:45] it's manifested by his election amen
[22:48] because God is very specific amen when
[22:51] he was here upon the Earth he was
[22:53] choosing the disciples he never sent he
[22:55] went never went to zip recruiter and
[22:57] said
[22:59] you know send me a resumes and and and
[23:02] and Linked In I'm looking for disciples
[23:05] no the Bible says he prayed all night
[23:08] and in the morning he went and he he
[23:10] chose the disciples and he knew exactly
[23:14] whom he wanted and he called them by
[23:16] name Peter bomo Andrew and the different
[23:21] ones how many how many can say Amen that
[23:24] was the election of God and Judas was
[23:28] specifically for the work that you are
[23:30] supposed to do so for you to be in the
[23:33] Church of God it's not by your
[23:35] choice it's by God's election because
[23:38] Jesus Christ said you did not choose me
[23:40] but I chose you he chose us before the
[23:43] foundation of the world and David says
[23:46] what is man that thou art mindful of him
[23:48] what is the son of men that you should
[23:50] visit him he says even if I make my bed
[23:53] in hell thou art with me for before my
[23:56] substance was formed amen you you saw my
[23:59] name you saw my members and you wrote
[24:01] them in the book of life amen when I was
[24:04] yet unperfect yet you wrote my members
[24:06] in the book of life
[24:08] right
[24:10] Hallelujah so we have three Babylons in
[24:13] the Bible the first babon Babylon is
[24:17] called Babel it's the same word it was
[24:20] the bab of nimrod and the second Babylon
[24:23] is the Babylon of
[24:25] Nebuchadnezzar and the last Babylon is
[24:27] in the Book of Revelation
[24:29] which is called mystery Babylon it's
[24:31] called mystery Babylon because it's
[24:33] still the same Babylon but it's now
[24:36] hidden amen it's not as apparent as the
[24:39] first two because the first two they're
[24:41] pretty easy to know that you know this
[24:42] is Nebuchadnezzar he comes from Babylon
[24:45] which I think they call Modern Day Iraq
[24:47] right and he had you know he tried to
[24:48] impersonate God he had the river flowing
[24:50] through the throne that was Babylon in
[24:53] the middle of the Bible amen but now we
[24:55] have got mystery Babylon now what does
[24:57] Babylon mean
[24:59] the prophet says it means
[25:01] confusion Babylon is confusion and we
[25:04] live in a time of
[25:06] confusion we live the confusion is so
[25:09] much so until people have to
[25:14] debate I don't know if I can say this
[25:16] online I don't want your page to be
[25:18] taken down people have to debate what a
[25:21] man is what a woman is Amen in Africa we
[25:24] only have two right men and a woman
[25:26] that's it but I come here they say it's
[25:28] a spectrum what do you mean it's a
[25:30] spectrum the Bible says male and female
[25:33] created ye
[25:35] them that's what God did but because we
[25:38] are in Babylon there's confusion until
[25:41] people can't even tell if there is a
[25:43] there a man or a woman it's a spirit of
[25:46] confusion upon the people and Isaiah
[25:48] said I saw the Earth staggering that's
[25:51] right like a drunken
[25:53] man amen it says Darkness shall be upon
[25:56] the Earth and gross Darkness shall be
[25:59] upon the people am but I like that he
[26:02] says but but they shall be what amen
[26:06] hallelujah
[26:07] amen so because there's confusion God
[26:11] has to do something for his people there
[26:14] has to be an absolute amen there has to
[26:17] be a standard amen then God sends
[26:20] zerubabel amen and he comes out of
[26:23] Babylon because when they were in
[26:24] Babylon they were confused they had lost
[26:27] their identity they had lost their
[26:28] worship they had lost everything they
[26:30] had lost their land they had lost some
[26:32] of them were born there they had raised
[26:34] up there they had lost their language
[26:36] they were in
[26:37] confusion some were Methodist some were
[26:40] Presbyterians some were Baptist some
[26:42] were different Pentecostals there was a
[26:44] lot of confusion right everyone had an
[26:47] interpretation of the of their own of
[26:50] the Bible That's Right amen but then God
[26:52] sent zerubabel Amen to rebuild the house
[26:55] to restore worship amen because remember
[26:58] remember restoration without the word is
[27:01] just a Reformation amen Joshua was a
[27:04] wonderful reformer but you know what
[27:06] they had a Revival when they found the
[27:08] book of the law amen before they the
[27:10] book of the law they did not have a
[27:12] Revival right so the Revival comes when
[27:15] the word comes amen so the real Revival
[27:18] is in the bride amen it's not in drums
[27:21] and music and guitars that's fine but
[27:24] the real Revival comes when people find
[27:27] the word
[27:29] and they come back to the word then you
[27:31] have a Revival that's why the prophet
[27:33] says you have never seen a
[27:36] Revival we had a Reformation but now we
[27:39] are having a bride Revival and it's not
[27:42] like our kind of way of looking at
[27:44] things where there's 5,000 people in a
[27:46] stadium no sir no it's an individual
[27:49] Affair hallelujah it's an individual
[27:52] work amen because God is not a
[27:55] politician politicians they love group
[27:58] groups of people but they're not very
[28:00] good with
[28:01] individuals if you write a letter to
[28:04] your to to your
[28:06] Congressman as an individual he may the
[28:09] chances that he's going to respond to
[28:10] you it's like
[28:12] 1% but if you say we are a group of a
[28:16] million people out of Georgia and we've
[28:18] got this concern he's going to come down
[28:20] yeah because he Li they love people but
[28:22] they are not very good with individuals
[28:24] but God does not deal with groups he
[28:28] deals with individuals he knows your
[28:30] name He Knows My Name he knows how many
[28:33] teeth you have he knows he has numbered
[28:36] your hair he has not counted it he has
[28:39] numbered it he knows number
[28:41] 658 is
[28:46] missing
[28:48] hallelujah
[28:50] amen back in Genesis we realize and I've
[28:53] got many calls the reason why I'm not
[28:55] reading a lot of them is because I'm
[28:56] trying to you know mind my time right
[29:00] but those who read the message they know
[29:02] the things that I'm talking about back
[29:04] in Genesis we realized that different
[29:06] things happened back then look here for
[29:08] instance Babylon appeared first in
[29:10] Genesis because remember everything
[29:12] starts in Genesis Genesis is Gen it's
[29:15] the seed chapter now we have we have to
[29:17] watch Babylon it appears over here in
[29:19] the Bible again about the middle of the
[29:21] Bible and then comes all over into
[29:23] Revelation for the last days Babylon it
[29:26] begin first was the Gate of God
[29:28] it was then it was called then it was
[29:31] called Babylon and it says confusion and
[29:34] you will notice in the spoken many times
[29:36] the prophet would say Babylon confusion
[29:38] Babylon confusion because Babylon means
[29:41] confusion because when they spoke in in
[29:43] in many different tongues when they were
[29:45] trying to build that Tower they became
[29:48] confused that's where the word comes
[29:50] it's called the Tower of bab it's now a
[29:53] symbol of confusion just like the modern
[29:55] day Pentecostal Church everybody's
[29:58] speaking in a tongue there's no one to
[30:00] interpret there's no order it has become
[30:03] confusion Hallelujah so so so zerubabel
[30:07] becomes the signant now the prophet says
[30:09] now remember over in the Bible that
[30:11] tells us way back where we go to to many
[30:14] scriptures and prove what the Bible
[30:15] claims that there is a day that will not
[30:17] be night nor day just a dismal day
[30:21] organizations and church and enough to
[30:24] be saved but in the evening time it
[30:26] shall be light
[30:28] so the prophet is talking about a
[30:30] prophecy I believe it's in Zechariah I
[30:31] can't remember the book where the Bible
[30:33] says that you know there shall be a
[30:35] dismal day but in the evening time it
[30:37] shall be light amen now this is a day
[30:41] that is called dismal because it's a day
[30:43] of confusion so God sends a light
[30:46] because there is confusion amen because
[30:48] confusion is coming from a dismal day
[30:51] and the prophet says the most dangerous
[30:53] time to drive is when the S the Sun is
[30:56] setting it's it's not day it's not night
[30:59] it's a dismal time that is the worst
[31:02] time to be driving because you can't
[31:04] turn on your lights the sun is not there
[31:06] even if you turn them on they're not
[31:08] very effective it's not way dark it's
[31:09] not it's a very we the prophet called it
[31:12] a dismal day right and I would like to
[31:15] call it a
[31:16] nightmare the prophet says I'll tell you
[31:19] what where the a lost person goes when
[31:21] they die that's right the prophet says
[31:23] he goes into a nightmare they can't go
[31:26] in the presence of God because they are
[31:28] not saved but they come they can't come
[31:31] back here because their time is up and
[31:33] the prophet says they are lost in a
[31:35] nightmare it's like you're not awake
[31:37] you're not asleep it's a nightmare it's
[31:40] like a dismal day hallelujah it's like a
[31:43] state of being lukewarm right amen it's
[31:46] it's the same thing friends you're not
[31:48] cold you're not hot and that's the
[31:50] spirit of the day amen for you to
[31:52] overcome you have to understand your
[31:54] enemy if you go for for a boxing match
[31:57] they have what they call
[31:58] enemy profiling you have to know your
[32:00] enemy my enemy weighs uh uh
[32:03] 600b he likes to eat bacon you know he
[32:06] he this is how he works out if you know
[32:09] your enemy like America they spend
[32:11] millions and billions of just studying
[32:13] what does China have they've got these
[32:15] types of sheep they've got these types
[32:17] of of drones because if you don't know
[32:19] your enemy you're not going to win the
[32:20] fight that's right so the enemy for this
[32:23] age is lukewarmness amen the devil is
[32:26] not going to stop you from coming to
[32:27] church the devil is not going to stop
[32:29] you from coming to a coup meeting or a
[32:31] youth meeting the devil will make you do
[32:33] all those things but he will keep you
[32:35] look warm because it's the spirit of the
[32:38] age Hallelujah until people can't even
[32:41] say Amen in church anymore people can't
[32:44] even sing during song service people
[32:46] can't even show up for church they want
[32:48] everything delivered door Dash Uber Eats
[32:52] their religion it has to be done online
[32:54] on but let me tell you something the
[32:56] Rapture cannot be ubber
[32:59] the Rapture you have to be in
[33:01] person Hallelujah you can't you can't do
[33:05] it digitally no sir you have to be there
[33:09] physically you have to show up and you
[33:11] have to be changed because the Bible
[33:13] says in a moment in the twinkle of an
[33:16] eye we shall be
[33:19] changed a thisal day amen and this
[33:23] dismal day requires a signant amen now
[33:26] this is a signant ring that I was
[33:28] talking
[33:30] about now the prophet says
[33:33] here and he took me in he clothed me
[33:36] like the father with the prodal son put
[33:38] a new garment upon me the Garment was
[33:40] not mine His Garment of his
[33:41] righteousness he put upon me and a
[33:43] wedding ring upon my finger now this
[33:46] ring represented Authority if you're an
[33:49] adopted son God gives you a ring in
[33:52] other words you can sign checkes in in
[33:54] your father's name so God gives you the
[33:56] authority when he adopts you so that's
[33:59] what God that's what this prodal son you
[34:01] know was he was given a robe of
[34:03] righteousness he was given a ring upon
[34:05] the finger because why would a father
[34:08] give his son a ring it's not like he's
[34:09] getting married to him it's a it's a
[34:12] it's a ring if you read other other
[34:14] message the prophet explains it's it's a
[34:16] ring of authority it's a it's a ring of
[34:19] sunship amen
[34:22] amen now the the Bible says here the
[34:25] hands of zerubabel have laid the found
[34:27] Foundation of this house his hands shall
[34:30] also finish it and thou sh know that the
[34:33] Lord of host has sent me unto you in
[34:35] other words zerubabel was to bring the
[34:37] foundation he was to lay the foundation
[34:40] and bring the headstone now what does it
[34:42] mean in our day of course Paul laid the
[34:45] foundation but for the church to be
[34:48] completely restored because remember the
[34:51] church is a
[34:52] building because in in the Book of
[34:54] Revelations you have got a new Jerusalem
[34:56] coming out of heaven right there is a
[34:58] physical City and there there is also a
[35:01] symbol of the Bride so when you read
[35:04] about Jerusalem in the Bible sometimes
[35:07] it talks about the Physical City but
[35:09] sometimes it's talking about the bride
[35:11] amen that's why Paul says in Hebrews and
[35:13] in Galatians that our mother is
[35:17] Jerusalem but Mount Si belongs unto
[35:21] ishma is the mother of of those that are
[35:23] under the law that's what that's what
[35:25] Paul says so so so when talk about
[35:28] Jerusalem it's it's it's a woman it's a
[35:30] church like like the Bible says in my
[35:33] father's house are many mansions and
[35:36] when Jesus Christ said behold I go and
[35:38] prepare a place for you amen the prophet
[35:40] explains that he's talking about
[35:42] theophanies the body that you will go
[35:44] into because Paul says this if if if
[35:47] this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we
[35:50] have another one waiting for us and
[35:54] Jesus looked at the temple and he says
[35:56] destroy this Temple after 3 days I raise
[35:59] it up and the people were very slow to
[36:01] catch it said what do you mean it took
[36:03] our fathers 40 years to build this and
[36:06] you are saying you're going to rebuild
[36:08] it in 3 days they were thinking about
[36:10] the physical Temple but he was talking
[36:12] about the real Temple which is the body
[36:14] of Christ and that's what we are talking
[36:17] about today when we're talking about Zer
[36:19] real building just like the Bible the
[36:21] Bible says the the glory of the later
[36:22] house shall be greater than the glory of
[36:25] the former House people heard that and
[36:27] they thought oh the Temple of J is going
[36:29] to be so greater than the Temple of
[36:31] Solomon nor when the temple was finished
[36:34] the the ones that saw the Temple of
[36:36] Solomon the Bible says they
[36:38] wept because that's not what they were
[36:40] expecting but those prophecies they were
[36:43] referring to the Future Temple that
[36:46] Christ was going to build
[36:48] amen hallelujah amen so the the book of
[36:52] Zechariah is very prophetic like if you
[36:54] want to understand what's happening in
[36:55] Israel you read Zechariah you know go
[36:58] Israel is the apple of my eye who
[37:00] touches Israel you know those things you
[37:02] find them in Zechariah it talks about
[37:04] the the two Olive branches it talks
[37:06] about the seven candlesticks the eyes of
[37:08] the lord it's in the the book of
[37:10] Zechariah is an end time book just like
[37:13] the book of of of of Daniel because
[37:16] because zerubabel and in Zechariah they
[37:18] were they were rebuilding and they've
[37:20] got Daniel who was also kind of like
[37:23] another Gentile prophet in a way not
[37:26] that he was Gentile but he prophesied a
[37:28] lot on the Gentile
[37:30] kingdoms if you read the spoken word
[37:32] called the beginning and the end of the
[37:34] Gentile dispensation the prophet was
[37:36] talking about
[37:37] Daniel so so so the Bible says that he
[37:40] shall his hands shall lay the foundation
[37:43] and His Hands shall finish it in other
[37:46] words he shall bring the former Reign
[37:48] and he shall bring the later rain
[37:50] amen So when you say he shall lay the
[37:53] foundation Paul says this Foundation can
[37:57] no other men lay another Foundation it
[38:00] has to be the same foundation so the
[38:02] prophet comes he lays the foundation how
[38:05] does he laid the foundation he takes
[38:06] people back to the teaching of Paul amen
[38:10] he's not bringing something new he's
[38:12] bringing the same Foundation that was
[38:14] laid by Paul amen and he says I preach
[38:17] what Paul preached I baptized the way
[38:20] Paul baptized so he is laying the
[38:23] foundation but not a New Foundation but
[38:26] he is restoring us back to the
[38:28] foundation of the P Apostolic
[38:30] fathers and he preaches the the message
[38:33] the spoken word is the Original Seed
[38:34] amen and he says I have planted the seed
[38:37] I have laid the foundation and Billy
[38:39] Graham has planted a seed or Rob has
[38:42] planted the seed and that's why he had
[38:44] problem with the lat rain Brethren
[38:46] because they were trying to bring a lat
[38:48] rain before the seed was
[38:50] planted but he planted the seed and he
[38:53] called it a
[38:54] teaching a Revival which which he called
[38:57] Mur in Hebrew the teaching rain how many
[39:00] knows
[39:01] that the the restoration of the Bride
[39:03] tree you can read about that so
[39:06] zerubabel is a type of the end time
[39:07] prophet and zerubabel is also a type of
[39:11] Christ amen scriptures have compound
[39:15] meanings so he lays the foundation and
[39:18] the Bible says that with his hands amen
[39:22] hallelujah amen now the prophet says we
[39:25] have gone by experience not by the word
[39:27] away with measuring as your measuring
[39:30] line there's only one plump line only
[39:32] one rod that is the word of God now
[39:35] watch carefully and get
[39:38] this now if you read this scripture in
[39:40] Zechariah it says that we shall rejoice
[39:44] when we when they shall see the plummet
[39:46] in the hands of
[39:47] zerubabel and when he brings the
[39:49] headstone there shall be shoutings of
[39:51] Grace Grace unto it how many knows that
[39:53] amen now what is a a plummet it's a plum
[39:56] line so the prophet says it's not an
[40:00] experience it says we have gone by
[40:02] experiences oh brother I was praying and
[40:04] I saw a vision that's good but we cannot
[40:06] build the church based on that because I
[40:10] have my own experience you have your own
[40:12] experience maybe when you received the
[40:14] Holy Ghost you did you know certain
[40:16] things you know there something happened
[40:18] to you when I received the Holy Ghost I
[40:20] had my but we cannot build on
[40:24] experiences and you know I'm afraid that
[40:26] we we are going we are now going back
[40:27] back to experiences right we are going
[40:29] back to
[40:30] personalities we are going back to
[40:32] following people instead of the word of
[40:34] God and the prophet says there's only
[40:37] one Plum line amen because
[40:39] Z hag said he shall be a signate
[40:43] Zechariah says he shall have the plumet
[40:46] in other words he shall have the the the
[40:48] level he shall have the
[40:50] standard so the prophet has the standard
[40:54] now in the message the absolute the
[40:55] prophet says the Constitution of the
[40:58] United States is the
[41:01] absolute how many knows that amen and we
[41:05] know that the Bible is the what is the
[41:07] absolute
[41:08] amen but now if we have a
[41:12] dispute we
[41:14] say the absolute is the Constitution
[41:17] amen now is the Constitution going to
[41:20] interpret itself it's just a piece of
[41:25] paper so if you have a cult tional
[41:27] dispute you you have to consult the
[41:30] Constitution but you can't consult a
[41:33] piece of paper right there has to be
[41:37] someone who interpret the Constitution
[41:40] for you am and that person is called a
[41:43] Justice amen so you can say the
[41:46] Constitution is the absolute but it does
[41:49] not speak without a Justice
[41:52] amen without a Justice is just a piece
[41:55] of paper right good
[41:57] because everyone has their own
[41:59] interpretation of the
[42:02] Constitution but you have to go before a
[42:05] quot and a man will say I am chief
[42:08] justice
[42:10] Roberts this is what the Constitution
[42:13] says not everyone is qualified to
[42:16] interpret the
[42:17] Constitution you may interpret but your
[42:20] interpretation is no
[42:23] Authority because it is not given by the
[42:27] laws of the land righten so every
[42:30] Theologian can have their own
[42:32] interpretation everyone can have their
[42:34] own interpretation of the Bible amen but
[42:36] when it comes to authoritative guidance
[42:39] there's a
[42:41] Justice and the justice is a prophet
[42:44] because the word of the Lord comes to a
[42:49] prophet everyone is a Bible friends yeah
[42:52] right so who is right how do we know
[42:54] right how will God judge the Earth y
[42:56] right right it's a confusion amen this
[42:59] one say according to my Bible women can
[43:01] preach fine according to my Bible I can
[43:04] do this according to my Bible drinking
[43:06] is fine according to to the Bible some
[43:08] people believe polygamy is all right how
[43:11] then are we going to come out of this
[43:12] confusion God sends a
[43:15] signant and it says in the evening time
[43:18] there shall be light and the path of
[43:20] Glory you shall surely
[43:22] find we were not going to be able to
[43:25] find the PATH yeah
[43:27] amen so we're not following amen We are
[43:29] following the word amen because remember
[43:32] hor the Bible says in in Malachi before
[43:34] it talks about before he talks about
[43:36] Elijah he says remember horb what
[43:40] happened is horb God said I'm going to
[43:42] talk to you directly and the people said
[43:44] no no no no no we are we are afraid
[43:47] don't talk to us directly send a prophet
[43:51] right you speak to Moses Moses will
[43:53] speak to us so because of Horeb there is
[43:56] a a principle that God says he will not
[43:59] do anything the Lord thy God sh will not
[44:03] do anything except he declares it by his
[44:06] servants the prophets amen it became a
[44:09] principle because of Horeb
[44:17] amen and remember they a dispute with
[44:19] Aaron and and and
[44:22] deliverance oh who are you to rle over
[44:25] us who are you to tell us what to do God
[44:27] says oh you know what I'm going to
[44:28] settle this issue bring me your roads Y
[44:32] and they brought 12 roads and they put
[44:34] them in the ark y everyone had a claim
[44:38] oh I'm I'm Reuben I'm the oldest yeah oh
[44:40] I'm I'm I'm Isa I'm a very Z tribe oh
[44:42] I'm I'm Joseph you know we are the tribe
[44:44] of Joseph we the perfect people you know
[44:48] and God says bring me your your your
[44:50] roads and the road that BDS is the one
[44:54] that I've chosen in other words the one
[44:56] that is Vindicated right amen so Aaron
[44:59] and his family they were Vindicated to
[45:02] become Levites amen right so a prophet
[45:05] is also Vindicated by God Amen a prophet
[45:09] is not Vindicated on the internet he is
[45:12] not Vindicated on television he's vind
[45:16] Vindicated by God at his own time in his
[45:19] own way and it's not subject to
[45:22] debate just like you can debate whether
[45:24] gender is a spectrum that's up to you
[45:26] but before God it's it's it's
[45:30] finished and you could win an
[45:34] argument you could win the argument in
[45:37] this day and age yeah but that doesn't
[45:39] mean you are right
[45:41] amen they're doing it in colleges right
[45:44] they are proving I can prove to you they
[45:46] are 15 genders okay
[45:48] good but is that true it's
[45:52] not Revelation CH 21 verse 16 the Bible
[45:56] says and the city lith four square and
[45:58] the length is as large as the breath and
[46:01] he measured the city with the read
[46:02] 12,000 follows the length and the breath
[46:04] and the height of it are equal and he
[46:07] measured the W thereof 140 and4 cubits
[46:11] according to the measure of a men that
[46:13] is the
[46:15] Angel so the angel measured the
[46:19] city and the measurements are according
[46:22] to the measurements of the Angel which
[46:24] is a man that's what the Bible says
[46:26] right it
[46:27] right so he measured and and and he
[46:30] physically measured the prophet says
[46:32] it's 1500 this way it's 1500 that this
[46:35] way it's like from here from Georgia to
[46:37] to Maine and so on that's what he says
[46:39] right but he also measured the spiritual
[46:43] the bride amen says I saw a vision the
[46:46] preview of the Bride says stay in line
[46:48] stay in line so the the prophet he is
[46:50] called The Plum line because you cannot
[46:52] be a builder without a plum Lind that's
[46:55] why zerubabel the Bible says he shall
[46:58] have the plumet
[47:01] amen it shall come by Grace but the Z
[47:04] shall have the plummet because there's
[47:06] no Builder without a plummet right
[47:09] that's why many some of the houses they
[47:10] looking like this yeah right anyone can
[47:14] build
[47:15] friends but the question is is it going
[47:18] to pass the inspection of the
[47:21] state some of the houses they have no
[47:23] windows some of the houses Jesus Christ
[47:26] is spoke and he says he
[47:29] says be careful how you
[47:32] build says some will build upon a rock
[47:35] some will build upon dirt some will
[47:38] build you know it says you know it gives
[47:40] different scenarios it says the flood
[47:42] came and it it ran over the house the
[47:46] winds came it ran over the house but
[47:48] some built upon the Solid Rock Amen so
[47:52] Zer measured the city so for the
[47:55] building to pass it has to be we have
[47:57] the right
[47:58] measurements Zer has to tell you how
[48:02] long what does uncut here means Z is to
[48:06] tell you the qualification of a minister
[48:09] Z because you cannot build a you cannot
[48:12] build the temple without God's
[48:15] measurements right amen and the
[48:17] measurements they come from a prophet
[48:19] right amen and the prophet Moses he gave
[48:22] those measurements to a man called baso
[48:25] baso was a type of the fivefold Ministry
[48:28] though he was not only a prophet but God
[48:30] gave him the spirit to take from the
[48:33] prophet and to build and to bring the
[48:35] house of the Lord amen and because baso
[48:39] had the same spirit that was upon Moses
[48:41] amen but he took the measurements of
[48:45] Moses and he put them in order and he
[48:48] brought the house of the Lord amen but
[48:51] today people they don't want
[48:53] measurements that's why we are dying you
[48:56] know amen
[48:57] because even our food portions it's not
[48:59] measured I I say give me extra extra
[49:02] extra large
[49:04] fries and two extra sides of
[49:10] guacamole and sprinkle some honey
[49:12] drizzle on top of
[49:14] it there's no measurements it's as as
[49:18] much as you can afford that's where we
[49:20] are dying right
[49:22] amen that's why we perishing people
[49:25] right you you are what you
[49:28] eat and that's why the people they also
[49:31] dying spiritually because they don't
[49:33] want God's measurements they want to
[49:35] wear whatever they want they want to say
[49:38] whatever they want they want to do
[49:39] whatever they want they want to you know
[49:42] it's called self worship that's right
[49:44] brother amen when you worship God you
[49:46] ask him God what you would want me to do
[49:48] yeah but when you worship yourself you
[49:51] do whatever you want and you don't
[49:53] listen to
[49:54] anybody because you you do you can I
[49:56] tell you something even God cannot go
[49:59] above his word yeah right that's what
[50:03] the Bible says amen God is the only King
[50:06] who abides by his word that's why he
[50:09] could have sent thousands of angels to
[50:12] die upon the cross but he could not do
[50:14] it because it was contrary to his
[50:16] principles because the Angels could not
[50:18] redeem men because they are not kings
[50:20] men to
[50:22] men so God here to fulfill all
[50:25] righteousness so God is a king that
[50:28] exists in his word
[50:30] amen so if God is not above his word who
[50:34] who are we to be above the word who are
[50:37] we Jesus Christ himself he fulfilled the
[50:40] word to the dot and he says Lord I come
[50:43] in the volume of the book to do thy will
[50:46] oh Lord he did not come with one
[50:48] quotation he did not come with one
[50:50] scripture he came in the volume of the
[50:53] book he fulfilled every scripture that
[50:55] was concerning him amen and it says who
[50:58] shall who shall who shall condemn me of
[51:00] sin search the scriptures they are they
[51:03] that testify of me set your Bible what
[51:07] I'm doing is exactly what is written
[51:10] am but today people want to worship
[51:13] themselves y they don't want to be told
[51:15] what to
[51:17] do because we are living in confusion y
[51:20] people want to follow Tik Tok they want
[51:22] to follow Instagram no one wants to
[51:23] follow the Bible yeah come on brother no
[51:25] one wants to follow they want no nobody
[51:28] ask God what can I what you think about
[51:30] this should I get this job should I do
[51:32] this should I go people don't want that
[51:35] we think that's Liberty that is not
[51:37] liberty no that is rebellion right amen
[51:41] it's a spirit of the age you know they
[51:44] don't want a prophet they don't want a
[51:45] Bible they want they I want to be free
[51:47] free from what brother imagine if people
[51:50] were driving down the road anybody there
[51:52] was no stop signs there's no traffic
[51:54] lights anyone can drive whatever they
[51:56] want that is not Freedom that is called
[51:58] chaos and
[52:01] Anarchy and I could be a pilot and I
[52:04] could say I I could fly people you know
[52:06] would you get in that flight when I'm
[52:12] flying no brother I'm free I can do
[52:14] whatever I want yeah you know things
[52:17] don't work like that right right
[52:22] amen and he says who that who art thou
[52:25] great Mountain before Z rubel thou shall
[52:28] become plain and he shall bring forth
[52:29] The Headstone thereof with shoutings
[52:31] crying Grace Grace unto unto it moreover
[52:34] the word of the Lord came unto me saying
[52:37] the hands have laid this Foundation
[52:39] verse 10 for who has despised the day of
[52:41] small things for they shall rejoice and
[52:43] shall see the what the plummet in the
[52:46] hands of what of zerubabel and it says
[52:50] with those seven they are the eyes of
[52:53] the Lord amen which run to and from go
[52:56] has seven eyes seven Messengers it's not

[53:02] half or seven eyes and a
[53:05] quarter oh brother I went hunting with
[53:07] the prophet brother I can tell you what
[53:08] the message means no no no it's only
[53:10] seven eyes all of us are brothers amen
[53:13] there's no one who is higher than the
[53:15] other who's closer we are all brothers
[53:17] that's right there's no one who has got
[53:18] a special Ministry which is almost
[53:21] brother we are all the same we are
[53:23] brothers some are teachers some are
[53:25] evangelists some are pastors but we all
[53:29] Brothers am but but people are not
[53:32] satisfied with that that's right it's a
[53:34] trap it's a
[53:37] trap you always feel like the spirit of
[53:40] Lucifer he always wanted to be a little
[53:42] special a little high God has already
[53:44] given you something special but you
[53:47] people are not I feel like I always you
[53:49] know talk about this Lucifer I thought
[53:51] he had a pretty good deal was right hand
[53:53] man of God he was beautiful he could
[53:55] sing I thought he had a good
[53:59] package but he was not happy the guy was
[54:01] not
[54:03] happy and that's the spirit of the age
[54:05] people are not happy that's right oh if
[54:07] the government can do this for me of
[54:09] this of this of if only this brother can
[54:11] do this if this sister if my wife can do
[54:13] this why doesn't my husband buy me
[54:15] flowers every day why can't he
[54:17] just it's a
[54:20] spirit why did the deacons move me to
[54:22] the backseat why can't they let me sing
[54:24] why can't they it's a spirit of
[54:25] entitlement
[54:27] that is come upon the
[54:29] Earth and it takes Joy from people's
[54:32] hearts because you always see negative
[54:35] everywhere amen why did they allow this
[54:37] brother to preach yeah why is his accent
[54:47] different why does why does the pastor
[54:49] get get all these
[54:51] brothers these random Brothers they just
[54:53] come to church and they blast and they
[54:55] leave
[55:02] amen now if you would if we would think
[55:05] for a minute that the seventh Church
[55:07] messenger was to restore the faith of
[55:10] the children back to the fathers in
[55:12] other words rebuild the church again
[55:14] under the power of the spirit not by
[55:16] Mighty nor by power but by my spirit
[55:18] says the Lord not by organization or
[55:21] denomination by the by the Holy Spirit
[55:23] God will bring forth the church in the L
[55:26] last days amen so for us to be in the
[55:29] Rapture is going to be the grace of God
[55:31] that's right because God is the one that
[55:33] started the work he's the one that shall
[55:35] complete it he laid the foundation he
[55:38] shall bring the headstone amen I don't
[55:40] know about you but I wasn't looking for
[55:42] God when he when he came to me when the
[55:45] message came to me I wasn't looking for
[55:47] the message I wasn't looking for the
[55:50] Rapture I was not looking to be a
[55:52] minister I was going the God was going
[55:55] this way I was going this way amen but
[55:59] God by his Mercy amen he found me and he
[56:03] took me and he changed my life around so
[56:06] why should I being saved by grace now
[56:09] start to want to use my own works and
[56:11] try to figure things out how am I going
[56:13] to make it the one that took me is going
[56:16] to keep me is going to sustain me and he
[56:19] will see me through it's not for me to
[56:22] figure out things no sir
[56:28] it's a message of Grace friends amen
[56:30] he's the Good Shepherd the Bible says he
[56:32] will live 99 and you will go and find
[56:35] one that's exactly this
[56:38] message people would criticize brother
[56:40] Bram says or Roberts preaches pray for
[56:43] many people what about you say I have to
[56:45] go where God leads me am because he was
[56:48] looking for the seed amen he was sent to
[56:51] the lost sheep of the house amen Jesus
[56:54] left a Revival
[56:57] where many people were coming and
[56:58] rejoicing he left a
[57:00] Revival and he crossed a very dangerous
[57:03] sea where his boat almost sunk because
[57:07] he had to go on the other side because
[57:10] there was a man there who was full of
[57:12] demons he was backslid yeah people had
[57:17] written him off people were using him in
[57:20] Sunday school lessons yeah oh little
[57:23] children this is what what happens to
[57:25] you when when you take drugs
[57:27] this is what happens to you when you
[57:28] leave the
[57:30] message the guy was in the tombs he was
[57:32] not looking for God he was not fasting
[57:36] he was not
[57:37] praying he was not he did not have a
[57:40] spoken word he was in the
[57:43] Tomb that he was away from civilization
[57:46] he was away from
[57:48] evangelists nobody wanted to associate
[57:51] himself with that guy but Jesus left the
[57:55] Revival amen he left the 99 amen crossed
[57:59] a dangerous
[58:01] sea to find one man who was not looking
[58:04] for him amen because his name was
[58:07] written in the Lamb's Book of
[58:09] Life Hallelujah am I was like that man I
[58:13] was not looking for him I was not
[58:15] somewhere close to the message I wasn't
[58:18] born in Jeffersonville my father never
[58:20] went hunting with the prophet I depend
[58:23] upon him he called me in the ministry by
[58:25] his Gra gra I don't have a great story
[58:28] to talk about yeah my family is not a
[58:31] big name in the message I'm not known I
[58:34] Rely 100% upon the
[58:36] Lord he's the one that called me in the
[58:38] ministry right he's the one that knows
[58:40] where I should go right I don't have a
[58:43] great big story to to share with the
[58:45] people say my grandmother attended the
[58:47] meetings of the Prophet no sir I was
[58:50] like that man in the tombs amen and
[58:53] Jesus came and says would you be made
[58:55] whole I said yes Lord I want to be made
[58:58] whole would you be part of the Bride I
[59:00] said yes Lord I want to be part of the
[59:03] Bride what is my qualification what
[59:06] should I do you don't have to do
[59:08] anything you just have to agree you just
[59:11] have to agree amen
[59:15] amenl one day he went through the ship
[59:17] gate there were many different gates in
[59:20] the temple of Jerusalem but there was
[59:23] one particular gate where sheep would go
[59:26] into the slaughter so Jesus he goes
[59:29] through the ship gate I don't have time
[59:31] to read John and when he goes through
[59:33] the ship gate he is going like the Lamb
[59:35] of God and he comes to a pool this is a
[59:38] pool where they wash they used to wash
[59:41] Lambs to be
[59:42] sacrificed and the ship gate was made by
[59:46] the priests if you read the book of
[59:48] Ezra it was a type of
[59:50] Salvation and it had no bowls it had no
[59:53] nuts because salvation is without
[59:55] condition come it's a
[59:58] free whoever is thirsty come and
[1:00:01] drink it goes through the ship gate as
[1:00:03] the Lamb of God and there are multitudes
[1:00:06] of people who are trying to get into the
[1:00:08] pool of
[1:00:09] Bethesda but what did he do he goes to
[1:00:11] one man because that man's name was
[1:00:14] written in the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:00:18] amen many there were many people who who
[1:00:21] are in your family but you are the only
[1:00:23] one who saw the message that was
[1:00:26] coincidence God knew exactly what he's
[1:00:29] doing amen I can prove to you that by
[1:00:32] the scripture that everyone who is in
[1:00:34] this message is by predestination amen
[1:00:37] you cannot just hophazardly say I'm I'm
[1:00:40] I'm part of it no God is a very jealous
[1:00:43] God and he's a very specific God Amen if
[1:00:46] you're not part of it it will throw you
[1:00:48] out people say oh he left the message no
[1:00:50] sorry you cannot leave the message
[1:00:52] that's right the message will leave you
[1:00:54] yeah right come on brother the prophet
[1:00:58] one time he was in in Africa he went to
[1:01:00] a country called
[1:01:01] mmek if you have been to mosic it's it's
[1:01:05] like the Amazon in terms of like chaos
[1:01:08] right I've been there you the grass some
[1:01:11] of the place it's this tall they are not
[1:01:13] wide rows there's not zip code Google
[1:01:16] doesn't work Siri doesn't
[1:01:18] work if you use Siri you get lost but
[1:01:22] the prophet was there and the Holy Ghost
[1:01:24] would tell him turn right right turn
[1:01:27] left go this way and you go to a little
[1:01:29] heart and these little hearts they all
[1:01:32] look the same but the Holy Ghost would
[1:01:34] direct him said I want to go to that
[1:01:36] heart there's a man that is sick and he
[1:01:38] will go there say are you a Christian no
[1:01:40] would you want to be a belief I said yes
[1:01:43] God knew where that man was amen you
[1:01:47] might have been in a jungle you might
[1:01:48] have been somewhere but God knew that I
[1:01:50] have got a seed somewhere in mosm
[1:01:54] Beek and looking for that last one
[1:01:57] that's why we are here until that last
[1:01:59] one comes we're going to be here we'll
[1:02:01] pay our mortgages we'll pay our bills we
[1:02:05] we will come to church we'll do all
[1:02:07] these things until we find the last one
[1:02:09] all the missionary efforts printing
[1:02:10] books is because we looking for that one
[1:02:13] person as soon as he comes in then the
[1:02:15] door closes amen it's different from
[1:02:17] flying in flying if you if you come when
[1:02:20] the gate is closed if you miss the final
[1:02:23] boarding call that's it but but when it
[1:02:26] comes to the Lord there's no final
[1:02:27] barding call The Rapture will not happen
[1:02:31] until you are ready until the last one
[1:02:34] comes it's not there's no final board in
[1:02:36] cor where God is saying God will make
[1:02:38] sure that those whom he has
[1:02:41] predestinated they will make it for the
[1:02:45] Rapture one time the prophet he he was
[1:02:47] in a vision I'll close in about 10
[1:02:50] minutes and he had a bleeding lamp blah
[1:02:53] blah blah and then as he as he listened
[1:02:57] in the vision he turned to a voice and
[1:03:00] the voice started saying mil Town M Town
[1:03:04] mtown how many knows that there was a
[1:03:06] little girl called gei Kata she was sick
[1:03:09] for many years and the prophet left a
[1:03:12] Revival to go to
[1:03:15] geata because geata was a lamp like
[1:03:19] David says God he helped me to take to
[1:03:22] snitch the lamp from the mouth of the
[1:03:24] Lions some of you when God took you you
[1:03:27] were in the mouth of the lion you might
[1:03:30] be you might have scars but at least
[1:03:32] you're not in the belly of the lion amen
[1:03:35] you might have deep scars but I'm
[1:03:39] thankful for those scars because every
[1:03:41] scar has a lesson behind it every scar
[1:03:45] makes you remember where God took you
[1:03:47] from a I'd rather be scarred and saved
[1:03:51] come on brother than to be in the belly
[1:03:53] of the lionen
[1:03:55] hallelujah amen and go David would not
[1:03:58] give up on the lamp I can give up the
[1:04:01] pastor can give up we as people can give
[1:04:03] up but God does not give up he will
[1:04:06] never give up on his own amen I don't
[1:04:08] care how many tattoos they have I don't
[1:04:10] care how many how many whiskey they
[1:04:12] drink if you are a son of God God will
[1:04:15] bring you back anyhow amen
[1:04:19] hallelujah
[1:04:20] brother the prophet would tell God would
[1:04:23] tell the prophet go to South Africa
[1:04:25] shall meet a man called Sydney Jackson
[1:04:28] you shall do this go to Derber in South
[1:04:30] Africa God is very
[1:04:33] specific one time there was a colored
[1:04:35] man he was riding in a chariot he was
[1:04:39] reading the Bible he did not understand
[1:04:41] what he was reading about right
[1:04:43] amen just like me he was reading all
[1:04:46] these things biscuits and gravy Like
[1:04:49] Biscuits to me biscuits are
[1:04:52] cookies how can you have biscuits with
[1:04:54] gravy
[1:04:59] oh my M my mom used to make kung grease
[1:05:01] what is co grease I don't have what is
[1:05:04] you know we don't have where I
[1:05:07] come
[1:05:08] from so this color man was reading all
[1:05:10] these things not understand then there
[1:05:13] was a man who was having a Revival
[1:05:15] somewhere in Georgia and God says leave
[1:05:17] the Revival I have a lost lamp that
[1:05:21] needs help yeah and what happens he
[1:05:23] disappeared and he appeared in a chariot
[1:05:27] Y and he says sir do you understand what
[1:05:29] you are reading he says no sir and he
[1:05:33] was honest and many times we lose we
[1:05:36] miss the day of our Vis visitation amen
[1:05:39] because we are not
[1:05:41] honest but the unac was
[1:05:43] honest he says I don't understand one
[1:05:47] time the prophet asked bipo after
[1:05:49] preaching the future home he says do you
[1:05:50] understand he says yes sir he says Paul
[1:05:54] do you understand he says no I don't
[1:05:57] understand say you don't have to
[1:06:00] understand you have to believe it so
[1:06:02] Philip shows up to the unach and he
[1:06:05] explained to him what the Isaiah meant
[1:06:08] maybe he was reading Isaiah 53 says
[1:06:11] Isaiah 53 it's talking about a man
[1:06:13] called Jesus he came and he
[1:06:16] died maybe he was reading Malachi 4 it
[1:06:18] says God s shall send a Prophet Elijah
[1:06:21] the Prophet this Prophet came and the
[1:06:24] man was bap ized there and after he was
[1:06:28] baptized Philip
[1:06:30] disappeared it that that that that never
[1:06:33] made it on CNN or Fox News but it's
[1:06:36] there in the Bible it's not what people
[1:06:39] can see on the outside it's what God
[1:06:41] sees amen it's a story that did not make
[1:06:44] it on Christian networks yeah or on
[1:06:47] Facebook or Instagram it was just a
[1:06:50] private conversation between philli and
[1:06:54] the Uno amen
[1:06:56] and that's what the third pool is about
[1:06:59] it's not a public
[1:07:00] show when the prophet raised the fish to
[1:07:05] life he was not in a public setting he
[1:07:09] was not in church he was going about his
[1:07:12] business amen when the prophet shot the
[1:07:15] squ he was not in church he was not in
[1:07:18] front of 5,000 people he was going about
[1:07:21] his business when the tumor was healed
[1:07:25] of sister meeting that was not a public
[1:07:27] show it was just a need a regular need
[1:07:32] Lord help my
[1:07:34] wife friends that's why where we are God
[1:07:38] is not interested with our religious F
[1:07:41] and groups and camps those things are
[1:07:44] fine it's what happens out there that's
[1:07:47] where the rubber meets the road when you
[1:07:50] are alone at work when you are doing
[1:07:52] your plumbing job and just feel a sweet
[1:07:55] spirit and you say let me just pray and
[1:07:57] God does something maybe you can't find
[1:08:00] something you're wondering how can I fix
[1:08:02] this say Lord please help me then God
[1:08:04] just helps you things just change and
[1:08:07] you can't explain it to anyone but you
[1:08:09] know that there's something that's right
[1:08:13] Hallelujah so Zer was the sign I'm going
[1:08:16] to close if the musicians want to come
[1:08:18] the prophet
[1:08:20] says let me close my laptop cuz if I
[1:08:23] don't close it I won't finish
[1:08:26] the prophet talks about the seventh
[1:08:29] seal because remember we said a Signet
[1:08:32] is a
[1:08:35] seal now the prophet is not the seventh
[1:08:39] seal but he has got a lot to do with the
[1:08:42] seventh
[1:08:43] seal because he says there was an angel
[1:08:47] on my right who meant more to me more
[1:08:51] than the other angels and he kept
[1:08:53] talking about that angel
[1:08:57] because the seventh seal is the coming
[1:08:59] of the Lord amen and the prophet
[1:09:01] preached a message called The
[1:09:03] Rapture in the message there after the
[1:09:05] prophet reads Thessalonians in
[1:09:07] Thessalonians
[1:09:09] says the Lord himself shall descend
[1:09:12] that's right shall descend how does he
[1:09:16] descend he descend he descends with a
[1:09:19] voice with a shout with a trumpet and
[1:09:22] the prophet says you know he does all
[1:09:24] these three things
[1:09:25] as his descending and we know that the
[1:09:28] shout you know it's a it's a message
[1:09:30] going forth to gather the
[1:09:32] people so the seventh still is the
[1:09:34] coming of the Lord but there's a
[1:09:37] forerunner to forun the coming of the
[1:09:39] Lord amen there's a man who is
[1:09:42] sent to reveal to people the mystery of
[1:09:45] his coming Amen to reveal to people the
[1:09:49] mysteries of the Bible amen so that
[1:09:51] people can see Christ in the word in its
[1:09:54] fullness
[1:09:56] so zerubabel is a
[1:09:59] Signet he's a seal and he is also
[1:10:02] connected with the seventh seal he is
[1:10:05] not the seventh seal but he is so much
[1:10:08] connected to the seventh seal if you can
[1:10:10] read between the lines what I'm talking
[1:10:12] about Amen Let Us bow our hearts if we
[1:10:16] can stand upon our feet

[1:18:58] talking about the seventh seal and we're
[1:19:00] we're beginning to study some on that
[1:19:01] too and I remember brother ver said the
[1:19:03] seventh seal is what the end of all
[1:19:05] things all right the end of all things
[1:19:07] now remember you and I are end time
[1:19:10] people right right we are the ones who's
[1:19:13] the end who the end of the world the
[1:19:15] Bible tells us amen that's right who the
[1:19:17] end of the world's come upon so who's
[1:19:19] the seventh seal oh we know it's Christ
[1:19:21] but where's Christ he's in his bride we
[1:19:24] are the seventh SE that's right that's
[1:19:27] right brother Brown come and brought
[1:19:28] zable he put everything together but
[1:19:30] there had to be
[1:19:32] somebody come to that headstone that's
[1:19:34] right somebody's got to come to it here
[1:19:36] for us to get out of here he got to come
[1:19:38] here so we can leave right brother Brown
[1:19:41] started it he gave us everything we
[1:19:43] needed now it's my job and your job to
[1:19:47] be the end of all things that's right
[1:19:51] brother B he said the end of the strugg
[1:19:52] in the world he gave us a bunch of
[1:19:55] of but when I was we were singing that
[1:19:57] song I won't need any rest anymore
[1:20:00] that's right right we'll be at total
[1:20:02] rest am for an eternity am that's right
[1:20:05] but we going to start on this
[1:20:08] side having a little bit of rest that's
[1:20:11] right get along with God sometime do it
[1:20:14] more than ever before get along with God
[1:20:16] and let him talk to you amen it's like a
[1:20:18] brother said the other day he said quit
[1:20:19] talking let the Lord talk to us
[1:20:22] sometimes maybe we talk too much maybe
[1:20:23] we need to sit down and listen listen
[1:20:25] brother R said he was sit and waiting he
[1:20:27] said he hear it coming what was it he
[1:20:29] was sitting listening for it to come you
[1:20:32] said oh that was for a prophet well
[1:20:33] that's kind of that's for me and you too
[1:20:35] we're prophetic people that's right amen
[1:20:38] we're to get it in the same line that he
[1:20:40] got it in right come on he's got the
[1:20:43] first fruits but we've got to get it in
[1:20:45] the same line he got it in that's right
[1:20:48] cuz when we he talks about creating
[1:20:50] squirrels we're talking about creating
[1:20:52] atmospheres we're talking about creating
[1:20:53] Eternal people here that's right here
[1:20:56] amen not a little squirrel a person
[1:20:59] right so that's what he's looking for
[1:21:00] he's looking for people to be the end of
[1:21:04] all things that was good that brought
[1:21:06] that brought a good a Clarity to me on
[1:21:08] that about brother Brown said the
[1:21:10] seventh seal was the end of all things
[1:21:11] well what who is the end of all things
[1:21:13] we're the end of all things amen amen
[1:21:16] read the Bible it's very very adamant it
[1:21:18] says to whom the ends of the world have
[1:21:21] come that's us to whom what must be it
[1:21:25] must be humans that's right to whom it
[1:21:27] didn't say to Chevrolet or or Ford or or
[1:21:31] house it said to whom that's a person to
[1:21:34] whom the end of the world have come to
[1:21:35] we are the seventh seal and we'll get
[1:21:38] into that a little bit more because if
[1:21:39] you're not
[1:21:41] unfolded the devil's still there that's
[1:21:44] right amen but if you'll unfold who you
[1:21:48] going to unfold Christ right and
[1:21:51] remember he wasn't confused Christ never
[1:21:54] was confused that's right he never did
[1:21:56] anything wrong never never had anything
[1:21:58] that he had to say I'm sorry I did that
