he'll be there good to see everybody in the house of the lord glad to have our visitors with us glad to have one with us it's been away for a while good to see you back and just appreciate you and always say to the visitors you come one time you're part of us or not that way but you're a visitor then you come two times you're part of us so it don't take much to be because we don't have anything here to join we're just part of the body of jesus christ and that way you're you're part of it if you come and claim it to be that that way all right by way of announcements the lord willing wade will be ministering this morning this evening and then brother aaron will be ministering on wednesday i guess see downstairs okay all right and he'll be interested and then uh this coming next sunday will be brother chris long will be with us ministering both services for us so remember to pray for them all right we've got a lot of announcements to make so that's that gets the announcements of the the time terrence says i told you that the sign up sheet is downstairs uh next sunday the 24th will be the cut-off date because we've got to have to get the food et cetera et cetera so if you don't pass don't do after then don't come to us in the next week say well i decided cause we done decided we decided it cuts off next sunday on the 24th okay so that's that'll take care of that part so you know but just remember the sign up sheets all right welcome i got to welcome visitor wrote me a whole bunch of notes this morning and everything trying to get it uh right uh we've all you've had the voting and everything's in order see we are set up that we have to vote on the things because the way our church is set up with the government you say well what are you voting for a pastor said brother brown said there for life well that's true but in the state of georgia we have to vote to be able to keep our our church running in the order that we do and all of having it in that order so we vote and it's technically really just for the pastor but it has to be a vote situation i wanted some time to explain that because people say well what are they voting for brother dale is he you know he just we have to do things according to that all right so remember those things uh we have an order starting this year and things are getting we are going to make a few little not changes but we're going to put in order kind of a little situation to work that things can be handled a little better all right brother joe handles the computer in he's tops on the computer line up and we're going to tell brother anderson we haven't talked to him but he's hearing it on internet he will be an aide to brother joe and they'll be working the computer end of everything and handling that part then richard and josh they are in on the basis of keeping up the computers built up doing doing wiring et cetera et cetera and doing that and we're putting richard into the basis of one thing that he will be uh in charge of or in other words would be the purchasing agent for what is needed for the computer end et cetera et cetera all that's into that order terrence will be in charge of like outside because he does a lot of the the work and the things but the building uh doing and what will be handled by terrence so we're seeing see what we're doing we're putting in two purchasing agents that are not overflowing each other and to do but we're saying it this way now if you come up to anything it was you just come up and you could go to one or do that from now on you have to go through if it's something out of not a not a piece of paper not of things there is points that lisa takes care of all of the buying of you know necessities etc and doing those things but terrence and then will be in charge of the building and in charge of the computer system in other words we need a new computer uh you have to go to richard and richard says okay we've got to go and we've got to contact the trustees to let them know what we're doing on to that because we're trying to put some things in order to where that it won't be just left well we don't know who's in charge of what well see now if you're thinking about something in the computer inn your purchasing agent is richard you're thinking about something well we need a new window we need a new door then you go to terrence because that purchasing agent is on to that point so you don't go to lisa and tell her about it you you go to these and they will take care of that and transfer it on and everything so uh you know uh okay uh i believe that's all of it i hope it is anyway if isn't it we'll take care of it later and come up and announce it somewhere but we're trying to put everything to the basis that somebody's in charge then if you get what you want you've got to go to the person in charge because the way it is now it just slides in and out and goes backwards and forth and then and two while we're at it we will be going in this year we wind up a lot of times in having uh special meetings for the church and when we have a special meeting for the church like the valentine that's coming up see then nobody else is invited to come because that's the church but you must be a tithe-paying member of the church to be qualified for those situations you know because that's the prophet said the the tithe payers is what in other words they're the ones that's doing it it ought to go through them so then you won't be able to just come up and say well i want to come to this or i want to invite my uncle to come no when it's for the church now like christmas valentine things which will be the valentine is for the couples of the church husbands and wives see valentine couples of the church that are tithe payers let's see that way then it's up to you whether or not you're a taxpayer that's the one thing i've always because i don't like to talk about tithing i remember that i laughed about it but i had never preached on tithing and boyd helm uh invited his daddy to come and he told his daddy he said one thing brother dale don't never do is preach on money he don't preach on tithing or nothing like that well that very service that his daddy came i preached on tithing for the first time in my life i guess but i preached on tithing of your time your talents your money your everything you know priesthood in one thing and uh boyd said he went out and said oh he don't never preach on money huh well see then we put everything in order to try to do it if you don't understand then ask us and we will try to explain it because that's what we're trying to do see we wind up giving a lot of money away a lot of times and in doing that people just come up and stick their hand out well if you're not a title player don't expect to get anything back now we're not talking about kids we're talking about adults that are capable of working and tithe players kids you don't want to come up and say well okay uh you know lily back there how much time does she get but i do like to know that times that some of the kids i've known this for years you know some of the kids they get paid for something they'll come up and pay their tithe you know i like that because that means that they're concerned all right i hope everybody gets if you don't get it and i didn't put it plain enough we'll make it again my life one time we had a situation here and this old baptist preacher used to come in every once in a while and see us you know and visit with us really want to come preach but anyhow he'd come down every once in a while live right up here and uh he came in and we had a situation well he was so sure enough he missed about two months well you know what some people thought i wasn't plain enough about what i said so that day i picked that day and i brought the things up and uh and went right back through the same thing word for word that i had done the two or three weeks or months or before and there he's setting i bet he had a wonderful idea as a matter of fact i don't think he ever came back he probably thought man that guy's mean is a rattlesnake and all of that but but that's doing okay all right if you'd like turn in your scriptures i hope we got everything playing on that part for the day brother danny is sick back always back okay all right too did you i didn't hear it in there uh how many of you remember betty cunningham she was our piano player for probably 10 years i guess i don't know really in the beginning and she passed away yesterday is that right today two weeks ago well y'all late getting me the message that's uh there you go because we always thought to world of sister betty and bill and all and they was with us for years and then but they went back she went to a nursing on assisted living you know and was there doing that but she passed away so remember to pray for the you know i don't know how many's in the family or whatever but she was they were with us they were actually ones of the first ones that started this building in the services you know and coming here with daddy and bill okay but we just pray the lord would bless the families on each side all right lord jesus we thank you for your grace and your love we thank you for all things and we just ask you now to help us lord and let what little bit we've said be enough to help us understand how that we have to operate sometimes according to different things by the the laws and the situations and all we have to do those things because they're not taking anything away from us we'll just be do that ourselves we we thank you father and we ask you to just be with us now bless the the families that are of the of betty and all we don't know how many of them would still be living or whatever but just bless all of the relatives we ask you to be with us here in the service today have your way that your love may be with each one in jesus name all right our scriptures is second corinthians 5 16 through 19 and colossians 2 6 through 9. okay we've changed our topic if you noticed we haven't announced you know and we've been on one topic for 10 services so we're going now into further look so let's go to second corinthians 5 16. wherefore henceforth know we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ now remember this is this is paul talking but he's relating to the rest of them because he never probably ever met christ but anyhow what he's saying no we know man after the flesh yea though we have known christ after the flesh yet now henceforth no we him no more what if to the flesh we know him no more after the flesh all right because we know him in spirit right because that's what it's saying here therefore if any man be in christ he's a new creature old things are passed away behold all things are become new and all things are of god who hath reconciled us to himself by jesus christ and watched now and hath given to us the ministry of reconciliation it's given to the church what you buying what you lose all right are we in the scripture all right given to us the ministry of reconciliation to wit to understand i know you can you witness you can do that but to understand that god was in christ reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation to the bride see for us now then we are ambassadors of christ as though god did beseech you by us we pray you in christ said be ye reconciled to god okay let's go over to colossians 2. we'll pick up verse 6 through 9 as you have therefore receive christ jesus the lord so walk ye in him rooted and built up in him and established in the faith as ye have been taught abounding therein with thanksgiving be wireless any man spoil you through philosophy and vain deceit after the traditions of men after the rudiments of the world and not after christ just beware that man is trying to take you away from christ which is the word is that what he's saying okay for in him dwelleth all the fullness of the godhead bodily you may be seated the lord had his blessing to the reading of the word now i'm trying to start another i guess it'll be another but i said when we were in the series back there of the the revelation of jesus christ that we would pick up some topics along the way but i think this is a very good time i tried to cover in some things into the message about uh you know uh the godhead and things because that's one of my favorite topics and i wanted to uh pick up some things to uh just talk about them a little bit some things that we view along the way in doing it uh now we know that there's just one true and living god all right now we can say well we believe this we believe that there's just one true and living god but you know what i like to look at things a lot of times to the bases that uh you can take what is said here and what is said here and put them together they will come together to express god in his ways and things like that so we're going to be talking about the godhead maybe a couple of services or whatever but it'll be really the godhead made plain are clear to us because i think after all of these years of studying 50 years in the message that i think we ought to be able to comprehend the things the prophet has said to us and how he would explain things and that's what we will be doing is going with what he said you know to express it but maybe take some thoughts of ourself and just place it within it to try to click the mind because that to me is is um you know you uh you say well i understand but a lot of times you know you can understand to a point but not see it clearly and it just keeps unveiling that's what i said i've been studying this message for 50 years well you know what it's more clearer today than it was then a whole lot more because it just keeps unfolding i read it then i could preach it then i preached on the godhead in the in the in the uh late 60s early 70s and preached a lot of services about those things that you know you can go into the computer and pick them up and see that i was preaching it back there and preaching it and believing now i believe in one true and living god but we you have to be careful the way you place things because you can be misunderstood and people can think that you're a oneness because that's very close you know it's very close to the truth it was closer than the trinity see because you had three and like a man told me it worked one day and i was trying to explain it to him you know that there was just one god and father son and holy ghost and and he said well you know well i see that that god in jesus is the same and said uh you know i said well then you've done away with one of your gods why don't you just do away with one of the others and you'll be right you know and put it in one god because if you can say you see this now we'll just do away with one more well if that's the way you think let's just do one more see we know that the trinity is a uh point that was brought through from the catholic church back from 325 a.d and things coming down and coming into the situation of where we're at but yet to think about it see then you don't want to go to the trinity but it takes father son and holy ghost to make one god now god is not complete without those three offices uh attributes etc of father son and holy ghost you leave out one then your understanding is not complete you say well i can see it as far as hearing god in the spirit and the thing but i just can't see what see then you've got a problem with understanding that you need to have some help to pull that together but not to do away with anything uh you know i'll be making some statements as i go along like i believe and this is where i've always believed because if you it would be the only way you can keep your one god correctly see i believe that one day when this world is over with we'll be on the other side right all right and when you get there are you going to see as the catholic said it are you going to see a little altar over here for the father and a little something over here for the sun and a little something over here for the holy ghost you know now you're going to see jesus and know who he is see once that body came into being statement listen once that body came into being see two thousand years ago birth etc once that body came into being and god entered that body he will never leave that body he will not go make another body to live in the millennium or another one to go to the future home see jesus said if you've seen me you've seen the father well see it never will be that he'll do away with anything see that's where the people that do and you start with doctrines and start talking with people and you'll see them immediately start doing away with this and doing away with this and you know right in there talking if you'll watch them and then just stop and say hold it a minute now like i told a man at work one day he said i'm going to explain the trinity to you i said well go right ahead but only problem that i have i want to make sure i understand you i said now i mean that's the main thing and i said when you say something i want to say uh what do you mean i said because i want to understand what you're saying well he said i just popped my hand up he said this ain't going to work you know he was saying the word because he knew you know that that that was a problem i talked to brother in this message and he said if you ever see me off of anything raise your hand well two words i'm sorry you're the one who said it you know all right but listen see when we get there do you expect to see three things sitting nothing or you expect to see one god which is the lord jesus christ in a human flesh called a son not him as a son as a second person no but him as a son because remember if you have one god you've got to have to have one god you've got to have a father son and holy ghost okay that makes one god leave one out try to add in something else release it to the point that you're missing it and see your trinity would follow it up okay now you can't fall onto the side of the oneness in an easy way to illustrate brother dick addison used to we used to talk about this a lot uh about it uh you know when you talk about one god and people just run you over into a oneness well uh the oneness doctrine is at the point that jesus was the liest form of god now go go study your oneness doctrine and you'll come to that end of understanding that they believe that jesus was the final immorphy or form of god well i mean i'm sorry myself now you go you're uh the i believe the bride is the final voice to the final age i believe the bride is the last in morphy of god all right so then now your oneness is gone there's another way of seeing it the oneness believe he's one like your finger and see you say father son holy ghost one like your finger that won't work you've got to have the manifestations of father son and holy ghost to have one god so then those things i'm saying those things should be taken out of our understanding as to doing it because you know but to me one main thing is the what i just said the bride is the final voice now we're talking about to the gentile dispensation because we know that he goes to the jews once we leave out of here in a rapture et cetera he'll go to the jews but when he goes to the jews he takes this message that we have so it won't be god in another form you know another form of him it'd be the same form that it is to you and i because we are here at the age of where everything is coming up and finalizing it and seeing it as right here i'm not preaching about what was sometimes you have to do that to bring it down to get your understanding and i'm not looking as to what will be and that's fine but i i like to see about what's living right now you know i'm i'm a present tense person i guess you'd call me i like to see things where i'm at and seeing it from my understanding and and you know let's see see then watch this statement this there's a point that i like i thought about this the other day you'll see me up here a lot of times i know the preachers think i'm writing notes maybe to jump on to them but i don't on i write notes and put them in my pocket well nanny's here but why she won't never throw away them little piece of notes because she knows there's some writing on it but she doesn't understand it because she'd have to translate it and and uh yeah so she won't throw it away she'll keep it but see i like to write down little notes all right now if it's true and we've read here that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily all right now if that's true where's your trinity because whatever you got would have to be in him the fullness of the godhead bodily would have to be in him all right see then if it's there where would where would your other persons or personalities or whatever you want to bring for your trinity and doctrine where would you get to with it you got it all in jesus christ that's just like the lord jesus and matthew there he said you know um all powers given unto me in heaven and in earth but around him one day said it like this he said where then is the power of the father did you do away with something to come down to that situation or do you incorporate i don't know that may not be the correct way but i i just got enough english to talk but you know when you to me god is trying to bring things down to a situation to where that you can look at it and see it as complete finished you know and complete and can you bring your can you bring your ideas through the bible and come out at the place to where you can see it then and follow it can you do that see if you can all right then you lined up for something anyway but if you say well i just don't understand that i don't understand how that jesus could be there on earth and talking to a father in heaven well you got the baptism of the holy ghost i'm quoting brother branham or you believe it or not you got the baptism in the holy ghost who do you pray to well i pray to the one inside of me be careful now that you've got some good truth but remember you're praying to the father that's what a man said one time he said that's the funniest way you people are said you start off with prayer you ask the father to help you and to heal you and you close it in jesus name well okay that's true because jesus is the name of the father his name is jesus but not a oneness point see that's what i've been trying to bring up through the series of uh getting you to see that even though you you look back and wonder what started or worded everything brother branham explained it so we went through it he said god's first creation was himself well he wasn't talking about creating something mold it up and making it you know that that's not the word that's the word we use but that tricks us mind and our mind goes haywire and we start talking about well what did he do here and how did he make it he takes so much calcium potassium to pile it together now we created by his word see then the prophet could easily say it even the scholars the scholars if you'll read scofi i mean uh you know scofield if you'll read back there with those guys they will explain that the son was back there he said well how can he be back there when he was the father see that's where you're not seeing it correctly that's where he started condescending when he started condescending he was the first to be unfolded or revealed he's revealing himself all right then he changed her form and then morphing change over to making it that he the word comes into view all right see then you can see that the word is right and the word creates all things so the father didn't create it's the word but it was the father in another form so don't misunderstand that the father he would change his form and come forth as being the the creator because the bible said talking about jesus the bible said all things were created by him and without him there was not anything made that was made all right so then it comes forth and clarity to understand that what you're seeing is you're seeing god unveiling in the acts of a play that one person plays many parts the difference in the natural acts of a play is that person has to to eventually go out of existence somewhere down the road trying to do but god doesn't do it he just unfolds one stage he steps over in another stage he's the word that creates all things then you can call him the logos the theophany the things that the prophet began to use that we think we know a whole lot about it because we can quote it but if we don't know it by heart then we don't if we don't have the logos within us then don't worry about knowing what the logos is because it won't work all right but see that god comes in you because we're going to make a statement in a minute of like this see god is not complete without father son and holy god let me back up i can get like weight i get to walking you can always you can always tell the difference in me and wade he walked this way i walk that away so that's that's the difference in they're doing all right but you see god now follow me he was unveiling himself which is an increase each unveiling from coming from the first creation then into the creation of to what we would talk about the word being there that's a deeper depth or more understanding of that god than when you say the son of god see the son of god is exactly what it was back there he was back there the son of god was back there all right but not back there as another personality that's where you get you wrong ever what you're doing like what i was doing see i'm stepping down to real to illustrate going from one part to another part but not persons it's the same person that's being revealed but it takes all of these uh may i use the word personality or identities because that's the one thing the prophet said god was trying to do was to show us his identity right through the opening of the word all right it keeps unveiling and he just keeps unveiling and he unveiled itself down to the point till it comes to genesis 1 26-27 all right let us make man and there was a spirit man come into being which is not another person with the same person in another form all right see at the end of you go on for a little while and and and and here comes adam as a human being that brother brother said god just took that 126 put it into 2-7 and he said you've got god standing in human flesh on the earth breathe into his nostrils according to blasphemous names that he breathed into his nostrils and adam became a living soul said especially into adam eternal life he put 126 into 2 7 and that was putting eternal life god's own life all right then who was adam he was the first adam but then i was hoping you'd listen to the things that i was trying to express because you see then that puts it looks like an odd situation but you've got genesis 1 26-27 then you got 2-7 and you've got adam standing on the earth he said first he's standing with his feet in the earth where he molded up from and made him and he said then he breathed into his nostrils well see then breathing into his nostrils the breath of eternal life all right but the thing that never made it very far because brother brown said god said adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden that's a seal book all right i don't agree with that water but he didn't fall to hell get all those things out of the way well where did he go when he died he never got to it see that's taking brother branham and just changing a few words and what he's saying and it comes down to clearly adam fell from eternal life to death in the garden where'd he fall what'd he do what went on no he never felt that way he never got there so he fell from in other words the tree of life was there right and what does the bible say when sin had entered the picture let us put the man out of the garden lest he partake of the tree of life and live forever he had already sinned in body he had sin involved in spirit but in soul he was a child of god [Music] i hope you never get the point to think that you can't do wrong that's one thing i've drove over and over and over you say well i'm a child of god i can't do wrong you you're already done wrong right then cause you let the devil tell you a lie that's why you need a savior all right but see there was adam coming into being as a natural being before jesus even come into being the natural flesh right adam comes into being yes jesus the natural flesh never come into being the flex man jesus didn't come into being back there it was four thousand years later before that adam i mean before that the lord jesus became the second adam and took the place in the creation line all right well see believing then keeping it to one true and living god then god is not complete without father son and holy ghost that enough to where we've got the point there god is not complete without father son and holy ghost so then it's not going to get up to heaven and we're going to find this one over here and there's over here and there's no over here and they finally caught back up together and we got three now like one feller said said what are you going to do when you go there and you don't find three he said i'll leave well i'm the other way if i get there and find three i'm going to leave now you do what you want to i'm getting out of there because it'd be the wrong place all right i'm not making a joke but just telling it like it is all right but see he's not complete without father-son old you're not complete without body spirit and soul right that don't make you three but out of that body spirit and soul man that you are you can be us a father a grandfather you've got many attributes that can come forth but you're not bringing no more personalities into view just leave that out that's what brought him up when he hit me that day so hard you know how do you believe it i said well i believe in one truth living god because baptist doctrine there's one god you've never been there you go back and check on it baptist doctrine is one true and living god they'll explain it that way but then you say well explain it that's the way i explained to brother mode i said he's gotten three persons he said would you mind explaining that i said well you know the father was a person and the holy ghost was a person and i said i knew he had me nailed to the wall boy he was sitting there grinning i was sitting there crying because i knew i nailed the wall somebody done took me apart he said a person is a personality right i said yes sir he said then are you saying there's a personality of the father personality of the son the personality of the holy ghost i said i don't believe that no more that's what i said because i knew there was no argument i said i i don't believe that no more explain a lot of these things to me but i don't believe that one at least i've got this personality strength thing straight because he said you're a father you're a human you're you're a child you're but there's only one of you we hear brother branham say those things and we think oh those little silly illustrations that he's making they ain't too silly to me they're wonderful because they're expressing to me as a human being something i can understand a theologian try to build it up with all these other big words and i can't get it but i can listen to a prophet and he can just explain it all right do you agree then i don't mean you gotta vote on it or hold your hand up do you agree then that all is pointing down that looks like three personalities but it's not personalities it's all the manifestation of one person but that one person is coming forth see i agree wholeheartedly that jesus never become the fullness of the godhead bodily until the river jordan i do because he couldn't die for your sins as a as a two-year-old baby so he couldn't manifest he couldn't make manifest until he come forth into a man of time to manifest so then there he was but that's the problem when you try to make it the other way and see then it'll go wrong but now think about it you realize that uh god is not complete without you i didn't say that your prophet did okay let's just read it okay go ahead to number number two brothers and then we'll get to number three or i love to where they can bring up things so listen to the message on christ the mystery of god reveal just read on it you read before and after and come back and tell me whether i miss it you know when i got the paper here god expressed in jesus who was both father son and holy ghost the fullness of the godhead bodily the complete fullness of the godhead bodily dwells in his church the preeminence all that god was he poured into christ and all christ was he poured into the church to believers all right go to the next one which should lean out to your understanding and understand it so we see if you were in the foreknowledge of god then you are becoming a part of god and the only way you can be a son of god or a daughter of god you have to be a part of god now that's sensible in it okay you had to be a part of god and god isn't complete without you like i said if if it's true that the bible says it and we talk about that in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily so then if there was never a time that you and i were in him then he ain't complete but when he manifests itself through you he's gaining one more uh one more little speck of eternity that keeps on until all of it comes together and then you got to complete fullness of the godhead bodily how many do you want because you know it's there where brother brown said the bride is the fullness of the godhead bodily well i just i just can't see that well see that's what i mean that's what i do a lot of times i say things and then i i say well you know well i just can't see that we'll see go back and study something go back and think about it if he's not complete without you then who's he waiting on he's waiting on you and me to come to a place right you had to be a part of god and god isn't complete without you has to be that's right because dire is one only one resource of eternal life so you can't have the father with eternal life and the son with eternal life i'm talking about different personalities now and the holy ghost see as a personality separate from the others and try to have eternal life because like brother brown said it who created who the bible said all things were created by jesus christ well did he create the father no the father created him but you see that's word that we don't think about what's being said in the simplicity and listen to the prophet in simplicity as he expresses scriptures and things and see that he's not complete without you you realize the eternal life that you have within your soul is a part of god amen right he's imparted himself into you does that make us anything no because he done all of it that makes him something that makes him a father that makes him a healer a savior etc etc because you've got to come over into the human elements of flesh and things to be able to understand those things just like i was trying to explain to you during that series how that adam come into being before the lord jesus did i'm talking about the flesh man the flesh man adam came into being before the flesh man jesus came in to be you know why you ever thought about it why because in adam then would be the capability of falling the capability of falling god didn't make him fall but the capability came into being through adam and eve then god can what not throw him down brother branham explain it he said god did not curse adam he said god did not curse eve he said he cursed the snake he cursed the earth and the thing but he never cursed adam and eve why how could he curse them if they had eternal life in their soul right how could you curse them if they had eternal life in their soul see when we listen to a prophet explain things and we talk about abraham and sarah and think about what he's talking about a lot of times we just take it away there and it goes out but you realize that the reason god could not destroy sarah the reason that he couldn't destroy eve was because they were apart right eve was a part of adam all right sarah was a part of abraham he couldn't destroy him that's wonderful come on church i've tried my best to express things to not get into deep too far with it of understanding you realize your children are a part of you and who's going to claim them if you don't who's going to claim those children if you don't yeah but look how bad they're getting come on let's just don't get off on that i'm talking about bad too because i don't worry about it i'll just bring up me and you you think about how bad things are the least little thing before god is death i had adam and eve you remember that had they not been an atonement before adam sinned he would have been cast out he said wait a minute wait a minute now where was the atonement before the foundation of the world he stood as a lamb slain so when adam come forth and done what he'd done god couldn't destroy him because there was eternal life in adam he'd have been destroying his own self just trying to talk to you about something on god and the godhead to understand to get it to a basis that we can see things for ourselves right see there's only one resource of eternal life and that is god and him alone has eternal life now and you were a part of him now watch in so much that you are an attribute are in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning it gives that little tug towards him that's what has to be quickened some of them will never be quickened they just don't have it they don't get that i love that right there the little tug and that was the prayer brother moat would pray when somebody was receiving her praying for the holy ghost he said lord said just give them a little tug on their heart see we like that beat them on the back and jerk them up down scream and holler i ain't against none of that that's your business but i do like i did one time we was praying in a prayer line and this brother he was that he was there and boy he was and i ain't throwing off on him now i'm just saying what happened he was shouting and glory hallelujah and everything and praying for the people and i was right next to him when he come to me i said let's hold it just a minute let's settle down and let's think this thing over we're talking about something that's salvation i was trying to get that little tug in the heart to him see well that brother he was and i ain't joking now that brother he was over here and he was praying to them people and he started seeing that these same people that was coming by here were dried-eyed and standing you know okay you prayed for me but when they passed where i was at trying to get that little point you'd see at least tears in their eyes and he'd go i ain't kidding you next night we lined up same prayer line you know what he was saying because i got right outside of him wanting to listen he said now let's be serious about this let's take this thing over i said well okay i'm not against emotions i believe in emotions i believe anything that's that doesn't have emotions is dead but i don't put emotions ahead of god's word i put his word first and then the emotions will come if they don't come then you've got a problem thinking about the word and you need to consider it all right listen so all right we've read that in jesus christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that god was he was poured into christ how many times brought around would make that stone and all christ into the church to take us back to the garden how many times did he make that statement i'd be scared to say less than 100 or 200 times that he said it you know because he meant it all god was he poured into christ and all christ into the church well now i'm asking you see i'm trying to i try to make you think okay i'm asking you if all the wave was put into donny wade's out of the picture right am i right i mean any sister brother whatever if if it's always put over then that's out of order that's not so god it's not exactly opposite all god was was poured into christ that magnified him that brought more into being just like he's not complete without you once you come in then that part of god is complete in that basis why are we looking for the last one all right and we do and it will be but until that last one gets here and comes in let's try to build a body to get it strong so that in a day like this where your viruses and your your your things and all you won't be falling apart i'm going to say this statement and leave it to those if you stop coming to church because you're afraid of the virus what would you do if they came in here with guns to kill us well brother dale i'm scared i'm not telling nobody to go to church heaven help me now you get the wrong thing you say brother dale's beating on us cause we ain't coming no but i'm just asking you the question what would you do if it was any other situation if we can't keep up with the footman what about when the horsemen get here if we can't survive in the what is it in a time of plenty in other words what we do when the swelling of jordan it gets down and we ain't got nothing amen well brother there you just don't say a lot about these things why because we should get into the word and let these things take care of itself god will take care of you and i if we are his bride amen but you didn't hear me come around and say well now uh if you get the virus you ain't of god no i think you're wrong when you say it like that yeah but the bible says that he won't let these things come on he won't let it take you and drive you to hell he may take you to the grave i spent five days in the hospital with double pneumonia they said come out of it and i'm getting my strength back i'm getting everything why because i believe that god is a healer and the people praying for us for me around the world that would bring it to the basis that it would come forth one day all right see let's talk about the healer it's not because you're sick that you're of god or not of god because you're sick let's get on to the healer let's talk about i'm healed amen let me ask you a question how do you get salvation sitting there last night just thinking how do you get salvation well start off god has to call you right no man can come unless god called him god has to call you all right now you've got to believe that he saves you right now what's the other one believeth with his heart and confess with his mouth now those are identically two parts but it's the same thing right if you can't confess that you're healed then you are not healed you are just saying what somebody else says well brother so-and-so said i was healed praise god but when you're gonna say for yourself when you're going to talk about yourself when you're going to say by his stripes i'm healed when you're going to walk up to something to death and look at it in this life and say bye stripes i'm healed i sit in that hospital room five days the greatest comfort i got was the times that i would talk to the family and thing and they'd say everybody is praying for you well if you don't confess you're healed you can't be healed if you don't confess you're saved you can't be saved because it's in the same sozo you know same eternal life or the same doing all right just talking to us about things well brother dale i don't want to say i'm healed when i'm not i may you're making a shame to not say you're healed amen you're in reverse you're in the devil's trap when you say oh well i'm not healed you'll never be healed see people say when i get healed i'll tell you okay you're gonna die am i got no problems you won't get in the scripture with me let's talk about it you're going to die because if you don't confess you're healed you can't be healed if you don't confess you're saved you can't be saved you're saying what somebody else says say it until it comes to fights who was that one that said i'm gonna preach faith until we get faith it was one of the one down through time he said i'm gonna preach fast do we get faith i like what the story is told but it's told about a joke you know about the preacher preaching so much on sin and the deacons got together and said can't you get something else he said let them all repent and they'll get something else see the truth of salvation in things are thought about in the simplicity because if jesus was the fullness of the god-head bodily what happened to the father and the holy ghost now i'm asking you to make a thought in your mind what happened to the father and the holy ghost you're going to make them personalities you got to divide it up then no no no no they're not personalities they're you know all right see then if you get down to one you can find out where you're going think about it oh god was he poured into christ does that mean there is no god well i'm in english i mean we've got school teachers here and things i've heard preachers in this message preach all god was he poured into christ see there all means all i'm not sitting there thinking my lord man wake up if all of god was poured into christ there ain't no god if that's the way you're thinking if you're thinking it that way in the human terminologies then there is god is not in no existence anymore come on make it another step all christ put in the church where's the christ but you see like i've been trying to preach to you i want a whole service about it what the more god unveils himself the more he comes into being the more he comes to a reality of a real person brother said he's not like the wind just blowing here in yonder he said he's a being yes he said well brother the wind blowed in the tree yeah okay see now you think you got smart no you come out to be a smart aleck in that terms because you're trying to destroy instead of thinking about something in the correct terminologies see oh god was he poured into christ that didn't do away with god that meant god stepped over what happened when jesus was brought into being god stepped in to jesus christ that was when he was a baby he was born to emmanuel i like the prophet in the way he said he says yo god with no teeth that gets me i just think about it see him laying there you know go go go go but you see it increases instead of decreasing it's the acts of a play yes but don't do away don't move that actor out that actor stays right exactly where he is because he's playing that part see all god was he poured into christ that didn't do away with god's existence of doing because i'm getting down to ask you some questions about it i'll get back to these in the next message i know but let me ask you a question when jesus was standing here on earth and he could talk to the father right and you know at times the father could talk to him that's why brother branham said it looks like that god has a dual personality you want these i've got almost three times he says it looks like that it's a dual personality no they can't be but one person it's dual in the basis that it's identifying what you're doing to your compared to what you're doing here like i said there are a while ago in it did you notice the river jordan brother branham says it emphatically on the river jordan that was where the fullness of the godhead came into being in jesus christ that's exactly right but where was the fullness before then jesus could not die for your sins at 3 years old 10 years old 20 years older until he came into his ministry or anointing all right see then under river jordan he became the anointed messiah it wasn't that he wasn't god before them he was god but there was something about god that had not come into being i quoted a while ago was you listening matthew 28 18. we like 28-19 we'll try to travel 28-18 sometime and see okay can i do it 28 18. all right i have to find it 28 that'd be better if i'd get over a little further you're not old enough to do that yet i was getting 18 trying to find 28 and that don't work too good and there's no excuse me i'm still off on something you know the scripture somebody can find it there where jesus said who do men say i the son of man now he said dart the christ the son of the living god who was talking who was talking when you're talking who are you talking see what about it in him dwelt the fullness of the godhead bodily well if he is all powers given unto me in heaven and earth what i'm trying was trying to find all power is given unto me in heaven and earth where's the power of the father where's the power of the son but you see that couldn't be said all right i got it up now that couldn't be said until that time you realize you know what that is after his death burial and resurrection right come on it was after his death burial and resurrection and after it he said all power and heaven and earth is given unto me well where was the father's power there stood the father sometimes the father would speak sometimes a son speaks a dual personality you realize that if you're speaking by the anointing of the holy ghost and you say it what's the difference in you saying it and god's saying it if it's the anointing of the holy ghost i said that correct because it didn't matter if judah said it if it was anointing of the holy ghost come on just stay with me of what i'm saying if you say not if i say if you say to this mountain be moved and doubt not in your heart see then you're a dual personality you're a human being that has our quoting brother branham that has a job you go out every day working and you do it that's one side of you you have another one that when god comes in and anoints you there's something else inside of you taking over and speaking that's why that we don't get healed most of the time because we're not saying what the one inside of us is saying we're saying what the one outside is saying the one outside is agreeing with it and saying okay yeah i believe i'm healed sure i'm healed let me say it the way the prophet says it buy stripes i'm healed let me set that brother brown said a prostitute come across the platform and get healed he said a true sign come across it and fail to get it you said well how was that all right that prostitute she got down far enough inside of her to be able to say something in my inner being is saying my drops i'm healed where the other person is standing there saying well if if if brother dale would tell me i'm healed i would go say that i'm healed two brothers in this message we all come up to and two of them we were baptized the same day and this one certain brother i won't call his name but he was well known and he uh he said i believe y'all three of y'all got the baptism of the holy ghost well you know one brother in that crowd he said i believe i got it because he said it i said i didn't get it that's the way i said it i said i didn't get it it was almost two years later before i got it the brother was just stating what he was saying and it's tried to do say bye stripes i'm healed put your name in there donnie farbush is healed what are you trying to do you're trying to contact between the two worlds whatever you'd say i don't know you've got a world of you that's a human being and an element you've got a world that is in a christian is a set aside position and being you got to get that to where that you can bypass that's what this statue of a perfect man is supposed to do bring us to the place that we can get past that natural thing and let him say it is that what the bible says take no thought for what you shall say because it will be given unto you where from what are you going to do brother dale they come in here with a gun in the hand well i'm going to ask him can i buy it first because they're getting to where they ain't you ain't gonna be able to get them very long go try to buy some ammo right now for your gun you'll find out you national rifle association according to the paper your thoughts yesterday filing for bankruptcy that's the only fighter against taking all your weapons away and why they got to take your welcomes away let's take your ammo what good is a gun without ammo tony it don't it don't go bang bang if we don't have no ammo you say well what are you saying what are they going to do i don't know what they're going to do but i ain't going to worry about it they broke in the door when the old door was right here the old building they broke the lock actually prys it apart broke it and if it hadn't been just my eye caught it i came up here and started to unlock the door and when i did it [Music] this thing has been broken i didn't scream and holler i just come in and waited a little while then i told the church because i didn't want to scare nobody i said ain't no telling how many bugs is in this church but back then that's what they're doing they come in bugs you you know put things i said it could be everywhere i said ain't looked at all i ain't trying to look under seats or look nowhere i said because i want them to hear what we're saying i said just let them listen to what we're saying i said because they got in here we're in a day now when they don't need nothing you know what goes with the story of that there was a man came here a little black brother and he'd come to the altar ever service and screaming crying and begging for god to heal him and different things lived right over here in a tent he came for a while and one day i walked up to him and i said brother i said something's telling me that you're a government agent they sent in here to check us out he stone faced me and i knew then i had him he didn't start you know because his nature none of you remember him his nature would have been oh brother no no no he stoned face me look straight at me i said do a good job but i said tell the truth don't lie about us i said that's all i'm asking you i never told a church never you told my wife or family or nothing for three months he had done left and went on went to a church on feather in the south why because i wasn't afraid they don't need bugs now they got telephones it don't matter where it's on or off they're sitting there listening to what you're saying and that's where it's going to be they're going to come up and say did you say this you'll have to say yes i said it because there it is all right but that's that's beyond me i don't care about that i'm caring about getting you and i to a point of thinking about where we are right now if god is not complete without you then you are a part of god made manifest in a human flesh in this earth today and that's exactly what the lord jesus christ was quoting brother branham the difference between jesus and me are you he was virgin born we are not because what's the difference in your flesh what's going to be the difference when it's changed now here's my point of saying while i'm going you've got to say that you're healed to be healed you've got to say that you're saved to be saved what's wrong with saying we're already changed i'm sick well somebody strives i'm healed because the prophet preached a message and one of you brought it in many of them this way no divine healing no resurrection is that what he's saying no divine healing well if you've got to confess you're healed to be healed if you've got to confess you're saved to be saved why don't we start confessing that we're already changed you know i just can't do that well see then you're not talking about what i'm talking about right you're not talking about the god i'm talking about because the god i'm talking about could live in many many many many many positional situations or or whatever you know not personalities or persons but many ways of doing until it would finally come down until he would be made manifest because he's already went through these things is that right did the prophet say i want the doctor that's performed the operations i don't want one today perform no operation to operate on me i want somebody that's had experience well that's what i'm trying my best to do i want somebody that's had experience the experience of the baptism of the holy ghost do you believe today that you're born again what can you put it on come on i shouted i cried i spoke in tongues i've done all these times heal the sick raise the dead and do every bit of that still be lost but what's the one thing that satan cannot impersonate the opening of the word oh he can preach about it but he'll always leave you dangling i like to hear somebody talk about what i believe they know themselves hey come on hey you can't put it on this old boy this oh boy don't quote brother branham now don't start stuff like that with john and see you've got the people in the message that'll do that we ain't we ain't you know we're we we've got the message we're we're we're beyond that prophet no huh come on we're not beyond the prophet he's in the grave we're just walking on top come on things don't happen pretty quick we're going to be in the nursing home whether you've got yours picked out they could actually say our mind's already picked out parents and them has already picked me up one sent me a nanny too huh it wouldn't matter to me if they put me in one this give me a book give me a book give me my bible i can take it with me or i can have something to enjoy reading because i'm coming out one way or the other either they're going to bodily take me out or either god's going to come and change us why because he cannot leave out his bride all god was he poured into christ all christ he pours into the church what is to do to take her back to the garden of eden because they ain't now listen have you ever noticed that i mean this is the way i think i'm sorry all god was reported into christ all christ supported in the church now what are you going to do you ain't got nowhere else to pour it right oh god wasn't poured into christ and all christ reports in the church what comes next but it runs to take her back to the garden of eden all right the change the change comes what are we waiting on the change but somebody start confessing it i've never said anything bro they used two years ago they used to tell us about these brothers that was off the message well you know what we done we get in the car and we would head that away because there would be a lot of brothers that they'd be talking about you know this that and they say they're off the message well i wanted to hear from firsthand what the people had to say we've done a lot of traveling to where other people i'm not going down there and getting messed up them doctrines oh wow you already messed up i'm going down there and find out whether or not i am one of them only way i can find out if i messed up is go listen and compare it with the rest of the word so when they'd say so and throws off the word we go listen to him all right but you see church somebody is going to see it and i believe we're there i'm not throwing off nobody or nothing but i'm just making the point let's start being more positive about who we are now years ago our ideas was like this if they come in here to take you and i out then me and brother motor already had buildings to where we would we would just tell you to gather at that building we'd ride around find buildings brother moat was a brain he knew how back then to take an alternator or it might have been a one of them but you change the diodes and automatically puts out electricity it's either the alternator changed over we'll make it to the generator you know generator one one or the other you can do that you can you can change the diodes in it and make up electricity we already had to figure out how we could have lights in the building and enough food in my house to feed this whole church for a year boy we fattened up god gave terence a hog and that we fattened up that hog and that booger got up to five or six hundred pound i believe because we started feeding that food to it why because i realized hey now come on just don't misunderstand me and think i'm one of those doomsdays this that or the other because i've automatically told you now what you ought to have in your home enough food to last you a few weeks because the power can go off it would be a sensible thing to hold you up a little bit of cornmeal or something where you could have something to cook if the power goes off cause we're on the end of the line the power goes off we're weak getting the power back man we wound up with the benefits out of it because that old hog was so big i know we'll forget him he was so big until he couldn't walk and and eat he would go get at the end of the trough and struggle and get up there and he'd scoop it up well we got our money's worth i mean but still if you go to the house we got canned stuff we got food we got things in the basement i think you ought to have oh no we're gonna wait until god creates it okay go ahead but you know where to go to in case you need some food right the church listen i'm just trying to be sensible to all of us and every line in every form if in him dwelt the fullness of the god ahead bodily then how could there'd be three gods you're going to come up with two you're going to come up mess yourself up so think about it one true and living god see all it took back there was the nicean council coming up with a point of saying and they never come up with a thing of saying that jesus was not god or anything like that they said that he was a lesser form another person so they come up with the trinity and thoughts of persons and personalities they never never in nazi one of the 325 never came up with the fact that there were three gods it was 606 when they developed it go study your history but think about it they thought that jesus was god in another form oh pretty close because i just said a few minutes ago that i believe that the bride is god in another form called a bride but that's not going with their ways their ways is bending down to one man and you're seeing him now he's coming up he's making statements and doing things because he knows he's going to take over all right what are we going to do come on musicians what are we going to do are we going to fold up and they come in here and say the next person that comes in here gets shot what are we going to do we'll just see what happens but you see we can make statements we can do things we can do a lot of things but just remember i've tried to explain it to you and let me say it this way the great eternal god before the foundational world kept condescending downward until he created a world and created man and then he had to stop in his creational form or creating form and went through the four thousand years but when he did here come a man walking out there it was almighty god unless you believe he said i am he you'll die in your sin [Music] you know they killed him because he was saying that he was the son of god now listen listen do you realize what it means when you say you are a son of god see that's why they killed jesus you're a man making yourself god now it was god making himself a man they just didn't have it right when you say you're a son of god you realize you're god in human flesh by the way plain language and you sisters or whatever are you talking about you're god in human flesh well that's just a little bit too strong a little bit too strong for what it's what the word says it's what the bible says it's what the prophet says it's what he's taught to us when are we going to start saying it what we got let's stand a woman in the bible days her last meal almost gone but god sent elijah [Music] what is it don't you worry [Music] i was on the [Music] well way is on the way you have a need it's right here now present tense brother dale i just can't say this but then i'm already changed i got too many problems [Music] well just hold on a little help is on the way troubles of this life come by and burdens get you down you think no one is listening you think no one's around just remember what his word says trust him and obey keep your eyes towards the heavens in the name of jesus christ our brother's having to take these treatments so we ask you to sanctify the treatments and the things and make it in a reverse form to come back and make he says he's weak and you come back you give him strength you touch him because we've asked and we committed lord to you and saying by your stripes our brothers in jesus name help is on the way just hold on a little longer [Music] just remember brother hal thomas he called me yesterday maybe listening now he said brother dale i'm just losing my mind he's like 83 84 years old since i'm losing my mind i can't think right i said well we'll just pray about it we'll just pray about it because that's all we can do we can't go and do this out of there there ain't something you can do so you pray so remember brother hal thomas is just remembering his wife she's you know not doing too good either but you pray every night every day you pray we pray every night and then as i pray i'm asking god to touch each one of you sometimes i go down the aisles calling the names just to be personal [Music] but you see i believe he's the healer i believe we're already healed if you're born again today you're already sealed by the baptism of the holy ghost let's start saying by stripes i'm healed these bodies are changed [Music] he said well i don't want to lie you're lying when you won't say it so just say it father as we end up the service we end up with one point we want to confess your word say by your stripes we're healed by years salvation we get salvation by the healing virtues all of the things are ours because we confess it and lord these bodies are changed because you've made the way now you come on the scene and make it manifest because that's the only thing we're waiting on because we can't do that but we can say that you have done your part guide us now as we go eat a natural meal bring us back together this evening bless weight as he ministers and just be with each one remember brother high on sister aldrin i remember all the other brothers and sisters that are not here and different sicknesses in their bodies al and and our lord and the different
