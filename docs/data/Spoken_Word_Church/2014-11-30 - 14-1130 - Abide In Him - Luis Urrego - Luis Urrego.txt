TRANSCRIPT
========================================
okay I guess that's recording it says R youc so I'm assuming that's recording all right if you uh if you want to turn with me to u to John chapter 15 John chapter 15 we're going to we're going to talk about um about Abiding and purging time amen I believe that we're in an Abiding and purging time we either abide in Christ and that we'll see here in just a moment that if we abide in him he's going to we're going to he's we're going to be purged amen so let's uh let's read from starting from verse one CH uh uh John chapter 15 it says I am the True Vine and my father is the husband man every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he leaves alone doesn't say that does it it says every branch that beareth fruit he what he purges it that it may bring forth more fruit amen so uh you know how a lot of people you know they say that well you know when you become a Christian it's just flowery bread of ease you know flowery bread of ease you know but it but it's not amen why because there's attributes in you that God wants to bring out out of you amen you're going to reflect the image of Christ amen some way or another if you're part of him amen I know brother Wade he's been speaking about the stature of the perfect man and you kind of can see the stature of the perfect man here sort of you know because these attributes abiding in him it's abiding in his word amen a lot of people complicate uh the the the this thing of abiding in Christ and him abiding in you but it's not anything complicated the more you stay in the word of God Amen the more you're abiding in him and the more that his life can flow back into you just like Jesus describes here uh uh as he gives the example of a tree so in verse three it says now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you amen so so it's it's the process of sanctification you Sanctified through the word of God Amen if you want to get things rid of your life you know and uh uh um stay in the word I was listening to brother Dale it was a Bible study the uh couple of years ago and that was one of the things that he had that he had said on there I thought it was really interesting he said just feed on the word you know you want to get R rid of things of your life feed on your word on the word you know stay stay stay in uh stay in the word because why that word amen it'll change you amen you come to a point in your life where where uh where you're going to need that word amen a time of Temptation and that word comes to your mind amen then it'll help you amen overcome whatever you're trying to overcome whether it's lust or whether it's a uh uh uh temper or whatever it is amen that word will help sanctify you yes Lord now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you verse four abide in me and I in you now I like what it says here cuz it says abide in me and I in you period amen it's like when Jesus said amen you must be born again period amen when he told Nicodemus you must be born again amen so you abide in Christ amen and I in you that's the way it's got to be because later on we can't we'll see here we can't do nothing without Christ amen we there's nothing we can do unless he without him amen as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except it abide in the vine no no more can ye except ye abide in me amen so you take a you take a tree for example a tree has branches and if the only way that the branches are going to bear fruit if they're attached to the vine itself and you have to remember that that fruit is not for the for the is not for the tree that fruit is for for us to enjoy when I go up to an apple tree amen that apple tree is giv me apples so that I can enjoy and the fruit amen that we produce in our life whether it's godliness patience you know brotherly kindness these things amen it's not just for yourself it's not for you but it's for others Amen to enjoy Amen to receive the benefit out of those things amen the brotherly kindness that I have with brother Joe amen uh uh or that he has with me you know it's for each other to enjoy off that brotherly kindness amen so God commands us Amen to bear fruit but we've got to be attached to the vine now I believe that that in here we see um we see the makeb believer the non-believer and the True Believer here in these scriptures because why the make believer or the non-believer is the one that that that you see there in verse two where it says every branch in me that beareth not fruit he taketh away yeah so there's going to be branches amen there's going to be people we we're all made in the image of of God right even The Sinner out here in the street they're made in the image of God Amen but there's going to be some people in this life they're not going to bear fruit at all amen uh uh you know and they're just going to live life and and die and unfortunately you know hopefully somebody can be alike to them and and and and uh maybe they receive with the gospel but but not everybody's going to receive the Gospel amen not everybody's going to receive Christ amen then you have others amen that are going to try to live off the life of the vine trying to live off the the the life of the Christian the Christian Life when those are what brother brand call grafted Vine uh uh branches you know they may act and look like Christians and they may scream shout holler and Hallelujah and speak in tongues and all that but that they're not producing any fruit that's changing them amen to the stature of a perfect man and then of course you have the the the the real branches who are producing fruit amen which we'll we'll continue reading here verse five I am Divine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the same bringeth forth much fruit I like what he says he brings forth much fruit not just fruit but much fruit says for without me you can do nothing six if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and man gathered them and cast them into the fire and they are burned so when you cut off a a the branch off a tree the branch if you just leave it sitting around it's just going to get just uh just uh dry up and it's just going to rot and then what is it good for it's good for just firewood it's going to be burnt you know so but a branch that that that's that's thriving amen that's thriving that that I don't know much about gardening I don't know much about those things but um you know you can tell when a tree is thriving you know you can see that it's healthy you can see that that that that that that uh the the branches are green the everything is seems to be working correctly why because the life that's flowing out of the vine into the branches amen the branches is asking for that life amen and if you're attached to Jesus Christ amen the way you should be you should be staying in God's word amen that's right asking for that life amen that is produced amen from the word that that comes from the word of God so Jesus here constantly concentrating on on on on abiding in me and him being the word amen he is the word amen verse six if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and is withered and Men gathered them and cast them into the fire and they are burned verse 7 if ye abide in me now listen to this if ye abide in me and my words abide in you so I like the way he words it there because he says if he abide in me and he didn't say and I abide in you which which when his words are abiding in us he is abiding in US amen he is the word amen the Holy Ghost amen and my words abide in you lost of place here you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you amen amen so that that that Branch that's on that tree every season every year amen it wants to ask amen for that life that's coming out of the Vine amen they ask so that it could produce leaves again so it could produce tree uh I mean uh fruit again and uh uh um and it asks for that life and it's going to produce amen it's going to give it to it's going to give it to it because why it's attached to it you me and you amen as Christians amen we have a right to ask for these promises of God Amen we have a right Amen to ask God whatever we want amen because why we're attached to him amen amen some people some sometimes we feel like uh I'm not worthy to ask the Lord this I'm not worthy to ask the Lord that amen but where are his children I would want my daughters Amen to ask me uh whatever they they need amen I want them to ask me and if they don't ask me I'm not going to know sometimes Bella Bella is is she'll come up to me and then she'll say papy um uh you know and and and then I'm getting ready to listen to her and she says oh never mind what what were you going to tell me oh no never mind tell me if you don't tell me I will not know what you want and then she tells me and then it'll be something simple that I could just go and do you know but we won't know unless you ask now you have a right to ask the father because why you are part of that bind amen you're part of him amen we have we have a right to ask brother Joe what were you going to say uh how any Miss brother says that you got all the promises of God the Holy Ghost yours your healing yours he said even if you had to cut through the Methodist and Baptist it's mine you amen funny way he said cut through the M baptism oh yeah absolutely yes I was just thinking back on the verse seven mhm that you know I've always wonder about that too that if you abide in me and my words abide in you why it didn't say and I but something just I don't know I just thought the way we know him because God is his word and his word is God I mean the way we the only way because it's not based on emotion right the only way we can know like biblical know him is to read his to know his word that word so if my words about you that know I just thought about that yeah no absolutely because when Jesus Jesus was telling his disciples this and they had been already with him for so certain time all he had done to them was just spoken to him and then where it says uh in verse three it says he's telling them now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you now remember all the disciples they went through a process of justif of sanc they were Sanctified you know even Judas was Sanctified but he wasn't able to he didn't go to the upper room Amen to receive the Holy Ghost amen so they were they were Sanctified or they were going through a process of sanctification by just listening to the word like a sister was saying Jesus didn't do anything uh uh uh great and of course they saw the Miracles and they saw the things that Jesus did but the Miracles don't save you miracles do not save you uh uh uh Miracles uh are just it points you to the Savior right amen it it shows proof that there is a savior amen not just that there's a Healer but of course there is a savior I was thinking about a while ago about how many people had been bras meetings and saw and actually received healing but never came to the message yeah I've thought about that too you know and and and God has to respect that law of faith in everybody that's why brother Brandon said uh was talking about people being healed in Beatles concerts things like that it's hard to understand it's hard to understand but I mean that that law of faith God has to respect not the fact that that the Beatles did anything for them but it's just the law of faith that they had I can receive anything from these Beatles I can receive healing people he said people getting up from their Wheelchairs and things uh but uh Catholic people can receive healing for you know by by by the uh faith that they have Amen in a statue Virgin Mary now I don't I can't explain that all and if you tell a denominational person that he he he he'll get I've had them get riled up with me you know what I'm saying how can that be how can that be but God has to honor that law of faith has to that's the reason have faith matter it you know it does matter but it's about faith right it's about faith yes verse seven M I live in New York on this verse this verse brought me through a mighty long way I go through um we had meetings conference and people didn't want to listen to what you say and I'll be standing up talking to her and have that I rememorize this verse it brought me through a whole trial of things in New York this verse was my lifeline amen yeah yeah that's a that's a that's a powerful verse amen and I used to read that verse those verses these scriptures and I would be like well how how in the world you know how can I abide in him what what is he what is he talking about you know how how does he abide in me and I but it's it's simple amen it's just staying in the word the white do that's correct and it makes you go through this verse when you what got me going seven and you want to go above it and below it and then you I had it so I had it on my desk I car it in my bag so I was always coming get and seven took me through a long thing and God know that I want for no I can't say go ahead I'm sorry well I did you used to walk around the streets in New York all the time all the time well I I can see how it helped you we going into another era we going into New York is bad but it's not as bad as people PR to be depending on what bur you're in right absolutely I was meaning the the the the the the temperature when in the winter time I that under control too you you you dress you put enough wear so when something happen you can pick it off happen go back we were just talking about that this morning but it's fine adj it to praise the Lord but in that scripture it doesn't say if ye abide in me so that's me abiding in him right and my word abides in you he didn't say he Abed you correct the word is him the word is him then you know how to ask what will if you're in the word that's right and it shall be done you that's right he didn't say a word about me being in you MH but then later on he says when he says I need to go so that the comforter could come amen and that I will be with you even in you amen and him amen the Holy Ghost the word everything is all the same amen that's the reason why we can see here say what sister Peg was saying that he says and my words abide in you amen you you can receive amen you you can hear this word amen and just have it in an intellectual conception of it that doesn't mean it's changing you amen it doesn't mean it's changing we're so bad even in the message still base it all on emotion yeah believe me sister I the same way when I first came into the message it was in 1999 when I first heard the message that's a that's a whole story maybe another time I give my testimony but um and I thought amen for like the first 2 or 3 years I thought that you know I saw everybody jumping and hollering and and saying amen and barely even heard the preacher preach amen and just and you thought that that was it you know cuz I came straight from like Baptist uh from the Baptist Church and this was the uh the fundamental Baptist Church which fundamental Baptists they they the women they wear skirts they cut their hair but they wear skirts and they're pretty modest people I used to go to Bob Jones University you know uh and so um so of course if you don't know Bob Jones University they have uh they go from kindergarten all the way to University if you didn't know that so but I I only went there in kindergarten uh Middle School in in high school and I was I was kind of bad and I got kicked out in ninth grade but of course my my my mom and my dad they were going to take me out anyways cuz it was getting kind of expensive but I was a bad little kid kid at the time but um you know and then from from going from Baptist to to we went through a little bit of Pentecost but not total not not a lot it was a shocker to us you know coming into a message church and You' see paintings you know stuff like this and you're like what in the world is that you know we're in a we're in a cult or something like that you know but and sometimes we forget those things you know to us isn't it's a you know it's we're we're used to seeing right paintings like that and and and the wheel of God and and things like that but to a Baptist person and to them they that scares them it scares them to see the Hoffman's head of Christ hanging on the wall you know why especially to a Catholic person that's just trying cuz they think it's Catholic you know so we kind of forget those things you know we kind of forget that that that I'm not saying take the Hoffman head of Christ to me it's a precious painting now you know but see but see to any Catholic person you know that wants that's coming into Christianity they think that that's a stumbling block to them so um I don't even know where I was going with this but yeah so so it's a it's a shocker and I thought you know I had to run and and a all those things and then you know later on I say let me just concentrate on the word yeah let me just listen and see what the preacher got to say whatever I can get amen and without any you know sensational in anything which is okay there's people that are emotional and that's fine we have all levels and and and some people amen some sometimes we're made to have emotions amen there's going to be people praising God Amen in in glory and I don't think they're going to be praising God with their hands right next to them you know like this you know and all quiet and stuff like that you know I don't think that and it'd be good for usen to let loose sometimes you know our growth can't be based on emotions correct all right you you mean our experience grow our growth that's that's right yeah but I mean well while you're walking in Christ amen sometimes you're going to have times of emotion you know why why person don't want emotion what I don't understand they want to clap down on the other like me why don't you want to rejoice in the Lord right why you want say like a thump on the law you know what I mean right no I I to know the truth I think there should be balance in those things you know sir not going to one extreme where can't do nothing then not going to The Other Extreme where you just you know that you can't hear the word going forth but I I'm just saying a lot of young people yeah in message churches they go to conventions and stuff and a and you know I mean you want them to hear how to be sav not just emotion you know math alter calls where it's just all emotion yeah I agree and uh that's really responsibility I believe you know the ministers who are there you know to take them aside and really man just like Paul you know Paul he stayed brother said he stayed with them until they received something you know he worked with them and that that's the reason why it's so important to have teaching amen because teaching teaching amen uh uh affirms you you know it sets the thing yeah brother brother Samuel's meeting there some guys were running the ow you know and other lady was screaming so sometimes people good for attention but like you say sometimes you can't listen to the word cuz somebody's screaming and hollering all the time but uh I mean it kind of made me feel bad cuz over here we're just sitting there you know brother D you know I as a minister you know we like to get amens from people and we like to get because why that that that that that U it brings what God has put it brings it out of us more because you're poor see affirmation that's right brother Dale you know he's preached I guess for a long time I guess he he doesn't need to have your amens but but I'm sure it helps him you know and I know it helps me you know to to to um you know to hear but it doesn't mean you know that I've heard people amen as the preacher is preaching and and right even before they God said amen and he didn't even get to finish what he said and you and you don't even know what he said was wrong was going to be wrong or right you know now see that that right there you know it's just people that are just so used to just saying amen amen amen amen and they don't know kind of like a habit yeah it's kind of like a habit amen it's just the truth the Holy Ghost disorder me and he a gentlemen and when people get physical and Destroy things in the sanctuary and hurt themselves or other people that's not God yeah I wouldn't think that's that's that's God no God is a god of order right I I guess we stop now right all right bless you and they they've seen him
