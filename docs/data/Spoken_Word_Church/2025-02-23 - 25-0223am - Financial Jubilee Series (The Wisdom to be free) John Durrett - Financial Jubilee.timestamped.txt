[0:17] of the Lord
[0:18] Jubilee as you can see Financial is off

[0:25] Amen but I certainly hope Financial
[0:28] Jubilee has been a blessing to you all
[0:31] and um let's go a word of prayer as we

[0:52] practical ways in our life father Lord

[0:57] bless me Lord and allow me to get myself
[0:59] out of the way Lord and share this
[1:00] lesson we appreciate you we love you and
[1:03] we thank you in Jesus name amen amen
[1:07] well Financial Jubilee it continues to
[1:09] be a blessing to me as I said in my life
[1:12] uh applying it in my life and um of
[1:15] course encouraging my kids and
[1:18] challenging them as well and I've heard
[1:20] a lot of testimonies from the church a
[1:22] lot of testimonies of people paying off
[1:24] debts uh God blessing with inheritance
[1:28] and different things that allowed people
[1:29] to move move ahead and I thank the Lord
[1:32] for that I've heard of challenges heard
[1:34] of setbacks I heard of this about my
[1:36] last
[1:39] time so I have heard it all and um
[1:43] that's okay you know we're here to
[1:45] encourage one another you know but the
[1:48] financial Jubilee it's a pattern that's
[1:50] what it is it's a pattern for our
[1:51] freedom in all areas of our
[1:54] life you know and I stand Here by the
[1:56] grace of the Lord just uh finances I
[1:58] told you about my experience and God
[2:00] helped me but it's many other areas and
[2:01] we're going to talk about some of those
[2:02] areas that God is continuing to help me
[2:06] it's been his grace that has sustained
[2:08] me and I'm sure each one of you I think
[2:10] of the story of uh Peter walking on
[2:12] water and I heard someone actually giv a
[2:14] testimony about it and they said often
[2:16] when Peter walked on the water you hear
[2:18] two sides you hear about his initiative
[2:20] and taking that faith in him stepping
[2:21] out in the water and you also hear about
[2:24] him getting distracted and started to
[2:26] drown but sometime people don't mention
[2:28] that Jesus stepped forward and saved him
[2:31] kept him from drowning and that's the
[2:34] main thing if it wasn't for the grace of
[2:36] the Lord I know I would not have been
[2:38] able to make it I would have drowned in
[2:40] the circumstances of life but he he is
[2:43] the one that stepped in and kept me from
[2:46] drowning so it's his grace and I know
[2:48] it's the same for each and every one of
[2:50] you so Jubilee the wisdom to be free as
[2:54] we look at Jubilee and the the we hear
[2:57] things we know our prophets preach a
[2:59] message message here recognizing acting
[3:01] but I think all of that is what brings
[3:04] it together and we'll talk a little bit
[3:06] more about it because wisdom is about
[3:08] applying it absolutely applying what you
[3:11] hear in your life right so what when the
[3:15] trumpet sounded every man could go free
[3:17] if he wanted to go free that's why I
[3:19] love Jubilee because it is a trumpet is
[3:21] a sounding it's something it's telling
[3:24] us something we could go free if we want
[3:27] to go free amen why is it important to
[3:30] go free because as we're free we learn
[3:33] to manage these things in our life money
[3:36] is just an example if you've been
[3:38] faithful if therefore if you've not been
[3:40] faithful in the unrighteous man men who
[3:42] will commit to your trust the true
[3:44] riches he that is faithful in that which
[3:47] is least is faithful also in much and he
[3:50] that is unjust in the least is unjust
[3:52] also in much and that is about
[3:55] stewardship our whole journey of Freedom
[3:57] was about being stewards of what we've
[3:59] been given on this life's journey to
[4:01] manage it well so we can learn to manage
[4:04] more
[4:05] responsibilities and that's what God in
[4:07] his word word is about he's trying to
[4:08] bring us more responsibilities true
[4:11] riches that we can manage and this is a
[4:14] special time this is a special age where
[4:16] God has given us everything he's given
[4:20] us all of the knowledge that we need
[4:24] he's given us
[4:26] everything how the problem comes down to
[4:29] this practical side of it how are we
[4:32] going to use all that we've got we have
[4:34] to train we have to fight we have to
[4:37] learn how to apply all of this stuff
[4:39] that we're getting so when we're coming
[4:41] to the house of God and we're hearing
[4:42] we're going to hear knowledge we're
[4:44] going to hear words we're going to hear
[4:45] God's will but we have to walk out here
[4:48] and learn how to apply
[4:50] it and financial Jubilee again that's
[4:52] just a pattern that's showing us and I
[4:55] love it and special to me because again
[4:57] I I teach my children I try to hold them
[4:59] cuz I want them to see I want them to
[5:01] see the blessing in being a financial
[5:04] Steward and if they can see that pattern
[5:07] then I think it's the same pattern they
[5:08] can apply to every area of their life
[5:11] and I thank God for for my children they
[5:13] they have both my son and daughter
[5:15] that's a a small testimony on their side
[5:18] um they've worked hard they all have
[5:20] jobs and they've saved their money and
[5:22] they were able to buy a car without
[5:24] loans so I thank God for that
[5:27] [Applause]
[5:30] and that's what it's about it's about
[5:31] being practical I want them to see it I
[5:34] want them to experience so much for me I
[5:36] can say it but when they start seeing it
[5:39] then it makes all that difference and
[5:41] Anna she is A Savior by the way that
[5:43] girl can save some money my
[5:45] goodness she is a Savor dad put this in
[5:48] the put I'm like okay okay it's going to
[5:51] still be
[5:52] there but she saves really well and it
[5:54] starts out small she thinks well I'm not
[5:57] even making anything and but she keeps
[5:59] putting a little bit away and after a
[6:01] while it's like my goodness wow and
[6:04] she's seeing she's seeing for herself
[6:06] and that's the same thing we want with
[6:08] God's word all of these things that
[6:09] we're talking about in God's word we
[6:11] want it to be real for all ages I don't
[6:14] care how small you are because God is
[6:16] giving us something for all of us to
[6:18] apply it in our lives but we have to
[6:21] train we have to fight Financial Jubilee
[6:25] 10 and 11 you can certainly go back but
[6:26] that was talking about fighting and the
[6:28] fighting words and Joshua how God told
[6:31] Joshua you have to be brave you got to
[6:32] be courageous and that's what we need in
[6:35] this day this day in time we have to
[6:37] fight we got to be courageous we have to
[6:38] be brave all those things are necessary
[6:42] in this hour for us to be effective
[6:47] stewards God's part in all of this and
[6:50] as we get into wisdom you're going to
[6:52] see it's always about God's part and our
[6:55] part God is always faithful with his
[6:58] part he's always prepared he's always on
[7:01] time he's already got it covered it's
[7:04] our part that's the
[7:06] problem God's part here's this quote it
[7:08] says we are free from sin we are free
[7:11] from shackles we are free from Habits we
[7:15] are free from smoking drinking carousing
[7:18] because the Son of God has raised from
[7:22] the grave and has broke every Fetter all
[7:26] condemnation is gone the debt has been
[7:29] paid
[7:30] the penalty is paid the sins are washed
[7:33] away and we are free oh we are free
[7:37] people praise the Lord Jesus we are free
[7:41] amen that's in all areas of our life
[7:44] right we are free people that's what he
[7:47] has done he has broke every
[7:49] Fetter this is his truth this is what
[7:52] he's done he set us free praise the Lord
[7:57] amen
[7:59] but again it has to be real see I can
[8:03] say we're financially free but but are
[8:05] you are you free in your marriage are
[8:07] you free in your relationships are you
[8:09] free in your family situation are you
[8:11] truly free well that's the part and I
[8:15] think that's that's the it's a it's a
[8:18] very thin line I would say even as we
[8:21] preach and as people share the word and
[8:23] as you hear that our ears often will
[8:26] hear what God has done we hear his part
[8:28] him setting us free and we might even
[8:30] claim that there's nothing wrong with
[8:32] that but it's our part that we have to
[8:34] do to match it right and remember that's
[8:38] what he's coming in this day and time
[8:39] he's coming so that that bride would
[8:41] match him when he comes back so that's
[8:44] the whole thing that we're doing we're
[8:45] trying to get our part right he's given
[8:47] us all of the provisions he's given us
[8:49] everything that we need on this journey
[8:51] to reach
[8:53] it that's it God's part our part Prophet
[8:59] said and I'd say come on you got
[9:01] something to do too God just don't poke
[9:04] things down your neck you've got to
[9:06] believe it you've got to do some
[9:09] fighting that's what we have to do that
[9:12] is the hard part that's the hard part it
[9:15] is so hard that and I'm going to tell
[9:19] you that's why you have people who have
[9:21] walked away from the message because
[9:23] they hear God's part and they look at
[9:26] lives they look at their own lives and
[9:27] it's like well it's not matching up up
[9:30] so it gets
[9:31] confusing our kids get confused our
[9:34] families get confused because we have a
[9:36] great message that we're proclaiming
[9:38] we're totally free as you just read that
[9:40] quote before but our lives are not
[9:43] matching all the way right now we know
[9:46] by faith we know we're on a journey and
[9:48] we're going to get there by his grace
[9:51] but it should be something practical in
[9:53] our lives that people can see yes your
[9:56] kids can see our families can see your
[9:58] wife can see your husband can see that
[10:00] we're on a journey and that's the fight
[10:03] we have to fight our way through we have
[10:05] to do some fighting clean your lives up
[10:08] pay your debts oh no man Jesus said get
[10:12] all your things off your hands get
[10:14] everything right Make Ready Get Ready
[10:18] remember in the name of the Lord
[10:20] something is fixing to happen amen that
[10:23] is the Jubilee cry to me it's God has
[10:26] done his part now let's do our part
[10:29] let's clean up our lives let's get
[10:31] everything ready let's make ready let's
[10:34] get ourselves ready because something is
[10:37] fixing to happen amen this has been
[10:39] since the 65 this quote so every day
[10:43] everything we should be doing is putting
[10:45] things in place to make ourselves ready
[10:49] amen that's our part Make
[10:54] Ready Colossians 1 I I want you to focus
[10:57] on this quote because to me this says a
[11:01] whole lot and we're going to take our
[11:03] time and just read it through some of
[11:05] the verses Colossians one verse two it
[11:09] says to the Saints and faithful brethren
[11:12] in Christ which are at
[11:15] Kalise so he's speaking to Saints and
[11:18] faithful Brethren praise the Lord I can
[11:21] say that here in this this group Saints
[11:23] and faithful Brothers and Sisters in
[11:24] Christ that's who he's speaking to he
[11:27] said we give thanks to God and the
[11:28] father of our Lord Jesus Christ praying
[11:30] always for you since we heard of your
[11:33] faith in Christ Jesus and of the love
[11:36] which you have to All Saints my they got
[11:39] faith in Christ they have love for one
[11:41] another praise the Lord for the Hope
[11:43] which is laid up for you in heaven
[11:46] whereof you heard before in the word
[11:48] word of truth of the Gospel which has
[11:50] come unto you as it is in all the world
[11:52] and bringeth forth fruit as it does also
[11:55] in you so they're bringing forth fruit
[11:57] praise the Lord since the day you heard
[11:59] of it and knew of the grace of God in
[12:02] truth praise God we see faith we see
[12:05] love we see fruits being produced in
[12:06] this church praise the Lord for this
[12:09] cause now this is where it's going okay
[12:12] let's take a step back for this cause
[12:14] since the day we heard of it do not
[12:17] cease to pray for you it almost seem
[12:19] like Paul would say y'all pray for me
[12:21] y'all got love Faith you got fruits pray
[12:24] for me Paul said no I'm praying for you
[12:27] I'm and I do not cease to pray for you
[12:29] and desire that you might be filled with
[12:32] the knowledge of his will in all wisdom
[12:36] and spiritual
[12:38] understanding he's saying you need
[12:41] something you need something practical
[12:44] here you need the knowledge of his will
[12:47] you need wisdom and you need spiritual
[12:50] understanding that you might walk worthy
[12:53] of the Lord unto all pleasing being
[12:55] fruitful in every good work and
[12:57] increasing in the knowledge of God
[12:59] strengthen with all might according to
[13:01] his glorious power unto all patience and
[13:04] longsuffering with
[13:06] joyfulness praise the lord we need that
[13:10] we need that knowledge of his will we
[13:13] need his wisdom and we need
[13:15] spiritual understanding praise the Lord
[13:18] Jesus so that's what God is bringing out
[13:21] in this scripture of word letting us
[13:24] know we can have love we can be faithful
[13:25] we can have fruits but we need more and
[13:28] I truly believe that's what we need in
[13:30] this hour our part is to get it and
[13:33] apply it right as we look at knowledge
[13:37] wisdom and understanding knowledge is
[13:39] what God wants it's the facts and the
[13:41] information from God we have his word
[13:44] many people have his word we have the
[13:46] facts we have the information what does
[13:49] God
[13:50] want wisdom is applying what he wants
[13:54] applying what he wants I term it it's
[13:57] the skillful and the practice iCal
[13:59] application of God's will in your life
[14:04] right right that's a mouthful it's the
[14:07] skillful and practical
[14:09] application of God's will in your life
[14:14] yes sir that's what wisdom is about and
[14:18] understanding is why he wants it why
[14:20] does he want it all three of those go
[14:23] hand in hand it's a threefold chord
[14:27] that's powerful
[14:29] knowledge for example if I were to say
[14:31] the church is on
[14:34] fire now some of you can say well God
[14:36] thank you brother John God Bless you
[14:38] that's that's real wonderful I
[14:40] appreciate you sharing that message with
[14:41] me brother John that was
[14:44] wonderful so Lord the church is on fire
[14:48] well we appreciate that that was good
[14:51] you know I hear you well that's what we
[14:54] do when the knowledge of the word comes
[14:56] forth we're hearing a word we're hearing
[14:58] the truth in this day an hour but wisdom
[15:00] is what are you doing about it in the
[15:03] fire situation now some of you might say
[15:05] well where's the fire
[15:07] extinguisher some of you might say I'm
[15:09] getting up out of
[15:11] here some of you may say I'm going to
[15:13] call
[15:15] 911 okay so the wisdom is what is God's
[15:19] will for you with the word that he's
[15:21] giving to
[15:22] you how are you going to practically
[15:25] apply it in your life and then
[15:28] understand it
[15:29] so I'm getting out of here because I
[15:30] want to save my life I understand why I
[15:32] need to move or I need to help someone I
[15:35] want to make sure the kids are out I I
[15:37] want to make sure I'm understanding
[15:38] because I'm trying to save a life that's
[15:41] the understanding would be behind it and
[15:44] we want all of those things when it come
[15:45] down to the word but what I'm focusing
[15:47] on here is the wisdom side the applying
[15:49] what we're hearing applying it because
[15:51] God has a purpose in it see when I
[15:54] started applying Financial Jubilee I I
[15:56] didn't know in my own life that it was
[15:58] going to go so far far um as I could see
[16:00] the pattern and I could see the need as
[16:03] my father has gotten older and he's not
[16:05] the man that he can't work like how he
[16:07] used to and finances and many other
[16:09] things that I didn't even think about
[16:10] has been very necessary and I thank God
[16:13] that he helped me to be free in that
[16:15] area that I can be a better help to my
[16:17] family and help them on their journey
[16:19] and show that pattern to my kids and
[16:21] even share this Jubilee message because
[16:23] of what God did with this small thing so
[16:26] he's given me more understanding of it
[16:28] of the import ordance and that comes
[16:30] together to make it a very powerful
[16:33] pattern that we can apply in all the
[16:35] areas of our
[16:36] life amen so when we're dealing with
[16:38] wisdom it's applying what he wants it's
[16:41] the skillful practical application it's
[16:42] about the choices that we're going to
[16:44] make the Life Choices the actual
[16:47] application of
[16:50] it Proverbs 2:6 it says for the Lord
[16:53] gives wisdom from his mouth come
[16:56] knowledge and understanding
[16:59] it's the Lord that gives wisdom his
[17:02] mouth he comes knowledge and
[17:04] understanding he gives us all of these
[17:06] things wisdom again is the practical
[17:09] application so as we ask the Lord for
[17:11] wisdom he's going to give you
[17:14] experiences he's going to give you
[17:16] experiences so you can apply the
[17:18] knowledge that he's given he has no
[17:20] problem giving you that right the issue
[17:22] are we recognizing it that he's the one
[17:24] that's giving us given it to us okay so
[17:27] we can apply what we're learning
[17:29] amen
[17:33] amen some wisdom keys I'm going to share
[17:35] a couple wisdom Keys as we look at this
[17:38] word as we look at what God has
[17:40] delivered to us and again as you hear
[17:43] this what you want to look is the
[17:44] practical application wisdom key number
[17:47] one it says life is a love
[17:49] story that's what it is if you were go
[17:52] into the word and our message is telling
[17:53] us life is a love story it's God's part
[17:56] and his bride that's what it's all about
[17:59] about okay so you just think of a bride
[18:03] that's the part that we would play now
[18:05] God's part is to express
[18:07] himself Supply your needs now and for
[18:10] eternity that's God's part in this to
[18:13] express himself to express his desires
[18:16] to you so you know Lord this is what God
[18:19] is saying to us in his word this is what
[18:20] I want you to do this is how I want you
[18:22] to work through this situation this is
[18:24] how I want you to live okay and he came
[18:27] down we know he came down expressing
[18:30] himself through Jesus Christ in
[18:31] Colossians it actually says Jesus is the
[18:34] wisdom of God Jesus is the power and the
[18:38] wisdom so you can see how Jesus is the
[18:41] practical application of God right amen
[18:45] that's wisdom and he's expressing
[18:47] himself he's supplying all of our needs
[18:50] now and through eternity our part is to
[18:53] get ready Stay Ready keep the armor of
[18:56] God and fight to do life God's way
[18:59] give him the preeminence first place
[19:01] that's our part get ready Stay Ready
[19:05] many people start out but it's how we
[19:07] finish so we have to stay ready we have
[19:10] to keep the whole armor of God on and we
[19:11] have to fight to do life God's way he
[19:15] needs to have the preeminence first
[19:16] place in every area of our life
[19:19] amen wisdom key it's about you his will
[19:24] in your life seek out your own salvation
[19:27] it's his will in your life the church is
[19:30] on fire what part do you play get the
[19:33] kids get those who are elder get that
[19:36] door open get out get out of the
[19:40] way I hope it's not just a sit
[19:43] there so it's about you what's God will
[19:47] for me in my life this is very important
[19:50] especially and and I've I've experien
[19:53] this as our kids have gotten older and
[19:55] life challenges again the the tests and
[19:57] trials that God allows you to go through
[19:59] the experiences that he gives you so you
[20:01] can apply it practically I've learned to
[20:04] see that that wow I can't get caught up
[20:08] maybe in how my children are feeling how
[20:11] my wife's feeling I got to keep my own
[20:14] Joy I got to keep doing what God wants
[20:17] me to do if I don't what hope do they
[20:20] have right right and that's not easy
[20:23] it's not easy especially when you want
[20:25] everybody to be happy we want everybody
[20:27] to be happy joyful and enjoy the
[20:29] blessings but we got a powerful enemy
[20:31] that's pulling in the other direction
[20:33] that's right so we have to be equipped
[20:36] and realize that we have to seek our own
[20:39] not what the pastor does not what the
[20:41] Deacon does not what this sister or this
[20:43] brother does not what my parents not
[20:44] with my kids it's me and the Lord Lord
[20:47] what do you want me to do with this word
[20:50] that you're giving me and I have to seek
[20:52] out my own salvation with fear and
[20:54] trembling

[23:56] miracle it's a miracle that we're still
[23:59] standing in this day and hour praise God
[24:02] and as we're faithful with these smaller
[24:04] things we will see him in the larger
[24:06] things amen but let your children let
[24:08] your family see these Miracles that he's
[24:11] doing they may seem like oh well no
[24:13] that's what the world wants you to think
[24:14] well God is in it you worked hard you
[24:16] the one you're the one that did this
[24:18] you're the one that saved no it's God
[24:20] that allowed that to happen it's God
[24:23] that allowed that to happen praise the
[24:26] Lord amen
[24:28] and I always tell her she's been paying
[24:30] her tithes Faithfully she see she's been
[24:32] working now we have
[24:34] experiences and um you know one of the
[24:36] experience that we had now I hope she's
[24:40] not embarrassed by this but her car
[24:41] unfortunately she had a small accident
[24:44] in her car but this is where I want to
[24:46] tell you the the grace of the Lord in it
[24:49] we talked about it we said okay here's
[24:50] the type of insurances that you can have
[24:53] you can have full coverage or you can
[24:55] have just U liability
[24:58] and we talked about it and she said you
[25:00] know what I I think I want full coverage
[25:02] said well okay let's let's do it let's
[25:04] do full coverage thank the lord we did
[25:07] it amen but I told her hey see you
[25:11] paying your tithes look how God can
[25:13] bless you okay he can bless you while
[25:16] you're paying you didn't get hurt and
[25:18] you're able to get your car restored
[25:20] think about it so you think you can get
[25:22] AE on God by not paying your tithes huh
[25:24] that could have been messed up all of
[25:26] your hard work and everything but God is
[25:28] watching out when we do things God's way
[25:31] amen praise the Lord so these are the
[25:34] factors of life Faith Family Fitness
[25:36] finances friends future fun yes so when
[25:39] we talk about your future it's it's life
[25:41] you're going to get older it's being a
[25:43] steward of all of those things you know
[25:45] I just found out yesterday the best
[25:46] person to take care of you when you're
[25:50] older yes we thought as the Lord he's
[25:52] certainly there he's taking care of you
[25:54] all through but the best person to take
[25:56] care of you when you're older is the
[25:57] younger you
[26:01] it's you right
[26:02] now I said Lord help
[26:06] me yes the younger you take care of your
[26:11] older self now start saving Fitness it's
[26:15] not just your Fitness but your mental
[26:17] health Amen brother Brenham he doesn't
[26:19] say mental mental health but he says
[26:20] mental condition that was the term back
[26:23] then Google see what he says don't
[26:24] Google look at the the table you'll see
[26:26] him say mental condition he said God can
[26:28] restore a sane mind and this is the hour
[26:31] that Satan is doing everything to mess
[26:33] our mental conditions up so Fitness is
[26:37] very important it's not just exercising
[26:39] and it's having the right mental mind in
[26:41] this hour and that only comes from Jesus
[26:44] Christ and applying his word in your
[26:47] situation practically
[26:51] practically of course family we got all
[26:53] the family relationships we know that
[26:55] faith and we know faith we know in this
[26:57] hour it's building to that Perfection
[27:00] that's the next wisdom key there's more
[27:02] required of the Bride in this age faith
[27:04] is the beginning we have to come to
[27:06] perfection in this hour it's required
[27:08] for us so you can see in this day it's
[27:11] everything because God has given us
[27:13] everything it's not the early stages of
[27:15] Faith it's the end where we have to come
[27:19] it is now required so in all of these
[27:22] areas God wants us to be
[27:25] Overcomers
[27:26] overcome understand what the will of God
[27:29] is next wisdom Keys full of obedience
[27:32] and the bride entitles her to him his
[27:35] token being fully obedient entitles her
[27:38] to
[27:39] him you know I think of the Lord and He
[27:42] is of course he's here in his word he's
[27:43] here in his holy spirit but the literal
[27:45] Body of Christ our our bridegroom he's
[27:47] not here and I said wow I was thinking
[27:50] about this I said he is such a man my
[27:53] he's so mature he's gone to prepare us a
[27:57] kingdom and he's left us a love letter
[28:00] he's left us the word to tell us how to
[28:03] live to tell us everything that we needs
[28:06] to to do while he's away and he's eager
[28:09] to come back just as much as we are to
[28:11] get to him but he has to do what he has
[28:14] to
[28:15] do okay and in the message future home
[28:18] brother B said he's preparing that
[28:19] Kingdom right now for his bride so he's
[28:23] over there working he's over there
[28:25] getting it all ready for us and our job
[28:29] on this life's journey he knows it's
[28:31] going to take our life this entire
[28:33] Journey because he knows what eternity
[28:36] is right so it's not a problem for him
[28:38] just like we would take our little kid
[28:40] to kindergarten and the baby and the
[28:42] young man or young girl they're crying
[28:43] because they're going to be away from
[28:44] you for five hours half day you know and
[28:47] they're like no no it's the
[28:50] end like no it's going to be okay and
[28:52] some of the parents they sit in the
[28:54] classroom and trying to
[28:55] just I got to get this boy going
[28:58] you got to grow up son you know but
[29:01] they're like oh no please no you heard
[29:03] parents taking the kids back home and
[29:05] trying to do it two and three days some
[29:07] of the kids are ready they're
[29:10] bye-bye But ultimately to a mature
[29:13] parent you realize the kid is going to
[29:14] cry you know what but two or three days
[29:17] they're going to be okay and then
[29:18] they're going to be home and that's how
[29:21] God feels he knows it's going to take
[29:23] our life he knows it's going to take an
[29:25] entire life for us to master these
[29:27] things to become stewards of all of
[29:29] these things in our life but we're going
[29:32] to Eternity so for him it's okay it's
[29:34] going to be some tears he understand but
[29:37] in the end he's going to come back to
[29:39] receive us and we will be with him for
[29:42] eternity praise the Lord the bride has
[29:45] to mature to be just like her husband
[29:48] when they when they unite they will be
[29:49] one and go home that's the journey that
[29:52] we're on trying to master all these
[29:54] things I have the musician come my it's
[29:57] just so much around this to share but
[29:59] that that is the key to it all last
[30:02] quote says Godly wisdom the skillful and
[30:06] practical application of God's will in
[30:09] your
[30:09] life Proverbs 3:7 says this it says get
[30:14] wisdom get understanding forget it not
[30:19] neither decline from the words of my
[30:21] mouth forsake her not and she shall
[30:24] preserve thee love her and she shall
[30:28] keep thee wisdom remember what wisdom is
[30:33] is the
[30:35] principle thing it's the main thing it's
[30:41] what we have to do practically we got to
[30:43] apply what we're hearing we got to do it
[30:47] if you're hearing the word today and
[30:48] we're going to hear the word come forth
[30:50] today you should be thinking Lord what
[30:52] are you telling me to do is it pray more
[30:55] is it read more is it to reach out to
[30:56] someone is it talk Lord what do I do
[31:00] practically because Lord I have to apply
[31:03] what I'm hearing the church is on
[31:06] fire it's not sitting still it's moving
[31:10] ahead in the Lord wisdom is the
[31:13] principal thing therefore get wisdom and
[31:17] with all you're getting get
[31:19] understanding why are you then doing
[31:21] what you're doing tie it up God is able
[31:24] to give us that
[31:26] wisdom and that will see us through on
[31:28] this journey God bless you again so much
[31:31] more we can share but we at time God
[31:33] bless you again look for how you can
[31:35] apply these things in your life
[31:37] Financial Jubilee is just a pattern but
[31:40] we have everything we need to apply to
[31:43] get to where we want where God wants us
[31:45] to be in this day and hour God bless you
[31:47] amen amen
