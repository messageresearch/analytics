[0:03] okay bless each and every one of you all
[0:05] of y'all the whole huge mental people we
[0:07] got in here there's a throw back of man
[0:09] be careful six-foot distance thing we
[0:14] got to keep this thing now and keep this
[0:17] thing going in the right direction
[0:19] Yeah right so Lord bless chip we're
[0:22] going to start today again on the book
[0:24] of Revelation thank you all for tuning
[0:28] in and being patient until this thing
[0:30] gets to where they start releasing a
[0:32] little bit of everybody start doing
[0:35] right maybe in another month we can get
[0:37] 50 people in here the way they're
[0:39] talking about something so let's just
[0:42] people with each other prayers keep our
[0:44] jewel and prayer he had a stroke Friday
[0:49] I guess it was and he's doing a whole
[0:52] lot better than I said in the hospital
[0:54] but he's still got to go through therapy
[0:55] and then also colleagues stepbrothers
[1:03] got the virus down in Atlanta so don't
[1:05] even remember there so so now we were we
[1:09] were back here and Sarvis talking about
[1:12] the sardian Church age which would be
[1:14] the church age of Martin Luther and how
[1:19] we come up through justification and we
[1:22] show down each characteristics of each
[1:27] age has to fit the messenger has to fit
[1:34] that page and also the people and the
[1:38] message have to fit what's going on
[1:40] because because God wrote this and for
[1:44] us to read and now the people of
[1:47] Philadelphia Church J's probably around
[1:50] John Wesley's time I don't know that
[1:53] they read the Bible which the Bible was
[1:56] beginning to come out then in Luther's
[1:58] day Wesley the Bible was pretty much
[2:01] already written King James Version and
[2:03] all that and it was distributed for them
[2:06] to read but I don't know that the people
[2:07] sitting in his
[2:08] and only north if John Wesley knew he
[2:12] was that angel but because of the profit
[2:15] cone in the end time in looking back to
[2:17] that and God showing him who eats angel
[2:21] was alright he could say that was John
[2:25] Wesley then when we look at the message
[2:28] that John Wesley preached we see that it
[2:31] fits perfectly
[2:32] same way went back here in the sardian
[2:34] Church age four Luther coming out of the
[2:38] countless churches protesting the
[2:40] Catholic Church starting the Protestant
[2:42] movement and then it moves over into the
[2:47] Wesleyan movement or the Methodist
[2:49] movement and just to give you a little
[2:52] background by John Wesley is the reason
[2:56] they're called Methodist is because they
[2:59] have a method of worship I would say
[3:02] Martin Luther probably brought a little
[3:04] more Catholicism in because he didn't he
[3:08] didn't come all the way out of the
[3:09] Catholic Church but he did come to a
[3:11] place where the just shall live by faith
[3:14] and he was real happy about that so then
[3:20] you can know you can see that when John
[3:27] Wesley comes in John Wesley so you can't
[3:31] be you could be Martin Luther and smoke
[3:32] a pipe and drink a beer hmm of course
[3:35] that sounds horrible with us but you got
[3:38] to remember Germans even now Germans
[3:40] drink beer like we drink tea they drink
[3:43] it with their meal they drink it warm
[3:44] they drink it all the time and it really
[3:46] doesn't make them inebriated because
[3:49] they're so much used to it same with
[3:50] Italy Italy drinks a lot of wine so it's
[3:55] just that we take it to the things that
[3:58] happen to us that we shouldn't do this
[4:00] attached to it so Martin Luther was used
[4:03] to doing these things but now God
[4:05] revealed to him to just shall live by
[4:07] faith
[4:07] and that was what God was happy with it
[4:11] moment he wasn't happy with the drinking
[4:13] in there smoking but he was happy with
[4:15] what he had at the time
[4:17] yeah cut in you Martin Luther had you
[4:19] know this much like then John Wesley's
[4:22] got this much life so when John Wesley
[4:24] comes on the scene God gives him a
[4:27] revelation of holiness all right and I
[4:33] met that of worship if you take if you
[4:36] find you an old Methodist if you go to
[4:38] Methodist Church don't still there but
[4:40] no still there in book but if you'll
[4:42] read in it it'll tell you all about John
[4:45] Wesley and all about the method of
[4:46] worship hounding you're supposed to come
[4:48] in and and you know you do this and then
[4:51] you do this and then you take up the
[4:52] offering just like what brother Brandon
[4:54] would tell us to do basically in this
[4:56] time but he was beginning Andrew John
[5:01] Wesley to show sanctification which is
[5:05] cleaned and set aside for service for us
[5:07] but it was his baptism of the Holy Ghost
[5:10] that he could see that those things were
[5:13] going out of his life nobody nothing
[5:20] and also this movement is going to brand
[5:23] another thing it's going to bring the
[5:24] great missionary age where they go out
[5:26] because Martin Luther what much in
[5:28] missionary they kind of stayed right
[5:30] there in Germany they're done but now
[5:32] you've got John Wesley which is he's in
[5:36] angel and I would assume and then he
[5:40] goes and he actually sails to Georgia if
[5:45] you read your history for over Fork
[5:49] it's where he landed and there was a
[5:51] fort there so being named 404 and he was
[5:56] going to go there to take the Indians
[5:59] the creeks and the Creek Indians and the
[6:02] turkey and all the different Indians he
[6:04] was going to go over there and
[6:05] missionary to them but on his way over
[6:09] there they got caught a storm and all
[6:11] these things happen but he saw a group
[6:14] of people called the Moravians and they
[6:16] were didn't bother them
[6:19] they were like you know they were
[6:20] backing the boat praying and worshiping
[6:23] the Lord and he kind of got attached to
[6:25] that now you don't hear a lot about the
[6:27] Marine Ian's after that because it
[6:29] wasn't that one the movement of God at
[6:30] the time the movement of God was in John
[6:32] Wesley's but he had to come through just
[6:34] like we're talking about upstairs
[6:35] John Wesley had to come through a
[6:36] journey he had to come all the way over
[6:39] here to Georgia to learn that he was
[6:43] born again yeah he had to get back in
[6:47] that boat go back to England and found
[6:49] God over there in England got born again
[6:54] and then he started proclaiming his
[6:57] message so but what happened though look
[6:59] how you moved it was then it was
[7:00] considered the great missionary age
[7:02] there was a lot of missionaries come
[7:05] from John Wesley and the Wesleyan
[7:08] movement or the Methodist movement comes
[7:13] everything back to the worship now you
[7:15] and you come into church and you knew
[7:17] how to worship and that's saying where
[7:18] we met this you go to every Methodist
[7:19] Church and usually they're basically the
[7:23] same but then what happened before we
[7:27] read this what happened what happened in
[7:29] every age God said this is why I want
[7:32] you to do and they said okay we'll do
[7:35] this but now remember God says plus
[7:37] because God keeps moving right so the
[7:41] Methodists in like the Lutheran said
[7:44] this is it we're not going in for the
[7:48] week we don't believe that Methodist
[7:50] movement we're still going to do what
[7:51] our leader said which in part they were
[7:54] true but their attitude was they had it
[7:57] off so the measure that's the same way
[8:00] even when when when John Wesley went off
[8:03] the same therein and the church identity
[8:06] in about 1906 no he died way back before
[8:10] then but that movement continued on and
[8:13] then they became so stomped and so met
[8:19] methodological methodical methodical
[8:22] photographer thank you methodical in
[8:26] their worship then it became
[8:29] the Catholic Church you know you walk in
[8:32] you do your time you do your hell
[8:34] marries you so they walk in they sang
[8:36] three songs they had taken up the
[8:37] offering the preacher preaches a sermon
[8:39] they have an altar call and that's that
[8:43] cigar said there's more to it than this
[8:45] yes so I'm gonna move on you can stay
[8:48] there I am with you to this degree right
[8:52] here right here but now when you move
[8:57] when when I'm moving on to the next
[8:59] phase when I'm moving to the next phase
[9:02] you're not moving but remember don't
[9:06] ever forget God was truly pleased and
[9:09] John Wesley Marlon's and all these
[9:12] people right here had the same baptism
[9:15] of all of those did you know yes excuse
[9:17] me the same baptism Holy Ghost Paul hey
[9:19] it was just degrees that each one took
[9:24] the Word of God and they like I said
[9:26] before you know John Wesley or Martin
[9:29] Luther the just shall live by faith that
[9:31] was a great thing because you know what
[9:32] you got to be the same way you got to
[9:37] adjust or the justified you not have to
[9:39] live by faith when we begin our
[9:41] Christian journey and even to the end of
[9:43] our Christian journey we still gotta
[9:45] have faith still so the faith doesn't
[9:47] leave and then when Martin Luther looked
[9:50] at that and said the just shall live by
[9:52] faith
[9:53] he told his people we gotta start living
[9:56] by faith forget about what the Catholic
[9:58] Church says about penance and doing
[10:01] these novenas and praying the dead
[10:02] Saints we got Jesus Christ we need to
[10:04] pray to and we got all these things that
[10:07] he brought him out of but he didn't
[10:09] bring him when he came out though he
[10:11] brought remember with somebody he got a
[10:12] name that you live in mind but you're
[10:14] dead
[10:14] he continued to bring the Father Son
[10:16] Holy Ghost baptism and all these
[10:18] different things he kept bringing him
[10:19] whipped they all kept bringing him with
[10:23] him God didn't like that but God's got
[10:28] grace knowing that this end time would
[10:31] come and that we could look back and
[10:32] build off of that same way with Abraham
[10:34] Abram made a lot of mistakes Abraham
[10:39] made some mistake
[10:41] and you and I gonna make some mistakes
[10:43] yeah but it's the journey that we're in
[10:46] in the continuation of the journey we'll
[10:48] talk about it at home see afternoon so
[10:51] let's get into this and to the angel and
[10:53] that word angel means messenger and to
[10:56] the messenger the church in Philadelphia
[10:57] right now look this is not Philadelphia
[11:01] Pennsylvania okay this is not
[11:06] Philadelphia Pennsylvania this is the
[11:08] church ik Philip I love our over in Asia
[11:11] there was a place called Philadelphia
[11:14] you'll read your turkey hook you'll know
[11:15] that these things that he that is holy
[11:20] now today remember he's required them
[11:23] how to be holy
[11:24] he's requiring us to be holy he's
[11:29] required in Abraham's journey and
[11:32] sanctification to become more holy than
[11:34] he was when he first started same way
[11:36] with you and I he that is true he even
[11:41] have to qiyam David he that openeth the
[11:43] no man shutteth and shutteth the no man
[11:45] openeth brother ground talks about this
[11:48] being that open door I know that works
[11:50] behold I have set before thee an open
[11:52] door now what is that open door that
[11:54] open door was is that gone open the door
[11:58] to the world because he we got to well
[12:04] let's just be truthful Columba probably
[12:07] spent ninety nine percent of his time on
[12:08] one island in one nation yeah so there
[12:12] wasn't a lot of missionary work going
[12:14] out during this time wasn't here went
[12:16] here maybe a little bit more with Paul
[12:18] but Martin Luther a little bit more with
[12:20] John Wesley you come up you got more
[12:22] horses carriages
[12:23] he's heck we're heading into them to the
[12:26] age of big boats cars airplanes now
[12:33] still one thing so people Commission
[12:36] anymore I mean you can talk about the
[12:38] trip that that Luther took I mean Wesley
[12:41] took to America was it took like a month
[12:44] almost to get there yeah Dave I mean
[12:48] like three weeks to get to America from
[12:50] England on both but
[12:54] god help man make better boats engines
[12:58] became in here engines intro diesel gas
[13:02] powered engines so what he does is he
[13:04] opened the door to the world and I just
[13:09] want to say this not belittling Martin
[13:12] Luther but Martin Luther's message to
[13:14] the world would work yeah because it was
[13:19] real it's kind of loose you know I said
[13:20] okay to do this but when you take jar
[13:22] Leslie when God sent him out John Wesley
[13:25] was looking you've got to be holy we got
[13:26] a dress right we don't need to be
[13:28] drinking alcohol we don't need to be
[13:30] smoking we need just straighten
[13:33] ourselves up and be riding and trying to
[13:35] live the best play with cam because he
[13:37] quotes scripture God won't dwell on an
[13:39] unclean vessel any man that put
[13:41] something in their body your body's a
[13:42] temple of the Holy Ghost and whatever
[13:43] you put in it that's what you get out of
[13:45] it right yes talk to me that would have
[13:51] been better ran out into the world
[13:53] because you're trying to convert and and
[13:55] I starts planning this perfect he knew
[13:58] that that's what is gonna be perfect so
[14:01] I know that works behold that set before
[14:03] thee an open door no man can shut it so
[14:06] no man came in and shut the door
[14:07] except when they started making creeds
[14:09] and dogmas they shut the door yeah they
[14:13] didn't shut gods door to the nation's no
[14:15] and it was still open that has the
[14:18] little strength but a little more
[14:20] holiness a little more closer to walk
[14:22] with God and has kept my word so he's
[14:25] coming more toward the Word of God like
[14:27] I said we're we're John Wesley could
[14:30] read that he even I think it's
[14:35] misrepresented sometimes the people say
[14:37] coffee but if you'll look back he was an
[14:39] Englishman so they drank tea and they
[14:42] said T he had all these different good
[14:44] properties and all that stuff John
[14:46] Wesley's like y'all are spending hours a
[14:48] day sitting around drinking tea when it
[14:51] has no value to it now he didn't say it
[14:54] didn't have any nutritional value they
[14:55] would just sit around drinking their tea
[14:57] in other words they weren't worshipping
[14:59] God they
[15:00] trying to you know trying to have these
[15:03] social events and everybody gets round
[15:07] drinking tea and don't talk about the
[15:08] work of God he wanted to talk about the
[15:09] work of God I don't think it was the
[15:11] physical teeth or the physical coffee
[15:13] it's what time you do with it right yes
[15:18] I drink coffee all day but do I just sit
[15:22] down for an hour and just drink coffee
[15:23] don't think about nothing else you know
[15:25] that
[15:27] that's the way I look at because you
[15:29] have a little strength and have kept my
[15:31] word and that's not denied my name
[15:33] so they still believe it in the Lord
[15:35] Jesus Christ but they are remember they
[15:37] are still they are still baptizing in
[15:42] the name of Father Son Holy Ghost come
[15:43] they don't know any better they're still
[15:46] taking a Trinitarian doctrine to the
[15:49] world but you know what I'm going to say
[15:51] this God's ok with that in that time
[15:53] yeah he's not ok with it now because the
[15:58] full words been over because the memory
[16:01] says has kept my word it has not denied
[16:03] my name behold I will make them of the
[16:07] synagogue of Satan which say they are
[16:09] Jews and are not but do lie or in other
[16:12] words say they are Christians and or 9
[16:15] in do lie I have someone who gets them
[16:18] behold I will make them to come and
[16:21] worship before thy feet because what's
[16:24] going to happen in Martin Luther's time
[16:27] or John Wesley's time here's what we're
[16:30] talking about you see these people now
[16:33] they physically do that but you see when
[16:35] the end time comes and all these people
[16:38] are brought up in judgment there's going
[16:40] to be a group of people in John Wesley's
[16:42] time just gonna reject that head
[16:45] rejected his message and they're gonna
[16:47] have to bow down same way with all of us
[16:49] they're gonna difficult bow down to the
[16:50] bride the brides when it does the
[16:53] judging right and to know that I have
[16:57] loved thee he loved them they could have
[17:00] loved him but he's going to show the
[17:03] separation I love Martin Luther
[17:06] John Wesley I love you people and I gave
[17:09] you the new birth you have faith but
[17:11] there's a group of people that didn't
[17:14] believe it
[17:14] cuz you got all your fanaticism and
[17:17] everything even in the message you got
[17:19] from that material cuz look look he says
[17:21] because now that's kept the word of my
[17:23] patience so John Wesley is bringing a
[17:26] little more of the word to light cuz now
[17:29] you got an imprint form and they can sit
[17:31] and talk about the Bible ain't not just
[17:33] what they were depending on a long time
[17:35] ago journey during the Columbus time if
[17:38] the priests would come up in a Catholic
[17:40] Church and he'd speak Latin he would
[17:42] read out of the Latin Vulgate which was
[17:44] the Bible that you didn't understand and
[17:46] there was no interpretation whatever
[17:48] they said that's what you did so Martin
[17:50] Luther that's when he started pulling
[17:52] the last and now that's not exactly the
[17:54] way it's supposed to be so when the
[17:56] Bible's began to be printed man could
[17:58] look down with their own eyes and read
[18:01] the Bible and keep the word of my
[18:03] patience I also will keep thee from the
[18:06] hour of temptation in other words with
[18:09] an hour of what on the hour of trial
[18:13] which shall come upon all the world to
[18:17] try them that dwell upon the earth now
[18:19] remember as they don't prove this a
[18:23] missionary age then it's not just
[18:25] England not just gobbling it's not just
[18:28] Ireland it's not just Germany it's not
[18:31] just were these three messengers work
[18:34] now God has sent these messengers out
[18:37] into the world yeah so the whole world
[18:40] I'm sorry there's going to be a group of
[18:44] people the great tempter the God
[18:47] attempts you its sample and it tempted
[18:50] them we shall come upon all the world to
[18:53] try them that dwell upon the earth it's
[18:55] gonna try me in you just like it tried
[18:58] them behold I come quickly hold that
[19:01] fast which you got in other words
[19:03] whatever you got hang on to it yes
[19:05] whatever you got hey whom did that no
[19:08] man take thy crown him that overcometh
[19:14] while I'll make a pillar that's not a
[19:16] pillow that's a pillar you know
[19:18] killer if this is the pillar this is
[19:22] help holding the building up so the
[19:25] people were help holding the Word of God
[19:27] are the temple of God where's the temple
[19:30] of God
[19:32] not great mortar and stone right here's
[19:34] the temple of God so in other words the
[19:38] way I see it John Wesley was more
[19:42] staunch in the Word of God and he told
[19:46] the line and as the Bible brother Graham
[19:49] quotes many times about him being a
[19:51] firebrand snack stout over the fire no
[19:54] words he was a hot coal he was a
[19:57] fireball he preached I can't remember
[19:59] you read it there it's phenomenal amount
[20:01] of sermons he preached in his lifetime
[20:02] he would preach six sermons a day
[20:05] because he'd get on his horse and he'd
[20:08] go preaching this town he'd get on his
[20:09] horse to go preach in that town or he
[20:10] could go from that time to another town
[20:13] why because it's the missionary age and
[20:15] remember the one time when the horse
[20:16] broke his leg you you were supposed to
[20:19] kill a horse
[20:20] if it breaks his leg he can't get over
[20:21] cuz there's so much lately but he gets
[20:24] down praise for the horse knows you
[20:25] can't walk where he's going you've done
[20:27] a desperate situation he said God I need
[20:30] you to heal this horse and he just spoke
[20:31] to the horse and horse stood up he
[20:33] jumped on it and rode it for ever and
[20:34] ever again but that was God showing that
[20:39] he was making the first Martin Luther
[20:41] first John Wesley and then everybody
[20:44] behind that he was making them pillars
[20:46] in the temple of my diamond and he
[20:49] showed go a little more out and I will
[20:51] write upon him the name of my god and
[20:53] the name of the city of my god which is
[20:56] New Jerusalem not Jerusalem over them
[20:59] physical Jerusalem overseas the New
[21:03] Jerusalem what is the New Jerusalem is a
[21:05] mother of a solace a new city that we
[21:07] have that Abraham was looking for but
[21:11] not the physical city which coming down
[21:13] out of heaven because though Jerusalem
[21:15] over there didn't come down out of
[21:16] heaven but the new cities gonna come

[22:37] Church age plus because there's a group
[22:39] of people come out because remember
[22:41] brother man said and bride was never in
[22:42] an age right so but they got the
[22:45] characteristics of the age because
[22:47] that's what God wrote about and the
[22:49] messenger but here we go now and we're
[22:52] going to read this and then we'll we'll
[22:54] do that next Sunday we'll go on upstairs
[22:56] into the angel or messenger of the
[22:58] Church of the loudest and write these
[23:01] things saith the Amen hello this is
[23:03] coming to the finality there's no more
[23:04] Church agent right don't want to change
[23:08] that to this one the Amen the faithful
[23:10] and true witness the beginning of the
[23:14] creation of God now just give you a
[23:16] little background on that the begin God
[23:20] never had a beginning God never was a
[23:24] creation he was a creator but the
[23:29] beginning of the creation of God yes if
[23:34] I got that you read it like that the
[23:36] beginning of the creation of God all
[23:40] right now what is that begin
[23:42] the creatives and well that was way back
[23:44] in Derwin that was okay because that was
[23:47] temporary
[23:48] back in Genesis 1 God said let there be
[23:50] light
[23:51] but Genesis 1:26 was the creation of God
[23:55] yes our the unfolding of God men come if
[23:59] you look at that word creation you think
[24:01] creation means and there's a table I
[24:04] mean there's a something standing around
[24:07] here beside me no this table is the
[24:11] creation from a tree that was back in
[24:15] the original creation that's why the
[24:16] Bible says there's nothing new Under the
[24:18] Sun anything you see how care if it's
[24:20] this computer or this phone it comes
[24:23] from the dirt and minerals of this
[24:25] ground yeah so this is a creation of God
[24:30] but now it only developed how many years
[24:34] ago maybe 30 years ago with them at them
[24:36] maybe 20 years ago really and the
[24:39] iPhones only like the thing you're going
[24:42] maybe you're 18 years old from what that
[24:44] it was always here in the dirt somewhere
[24:47] you were always there in the dirt
[24:50] somewhere your house did you live in was
[24:52] always in the trees and in the plastic
[24:53] and all the other things but then what
[24:56] did man do man
[24:57] created an automobile automobile was
[25:01] always here it was just parks laying all
[25:03] over the world and man being a miniature
[25:07] God put all these things together and
[25:10] created an automobile well that's at the
[25:13] beginning of the creation of God why is
[25:15] this to begin in creation God brother
[25:16] Brown said Jesus Christ was the
[25:18] beginning of the creation of God why
[25:22] because God always wanted to be a man
[25:23] but one happened in the Garden of Eden
[25:25] God couldn't become flesh right then
[25:27] that's a baby now eat now we're gonna
[25:29] talk about mail carrier day this
[25:30] afternoon that wasn't the son of man
[25:33] that wasn't Jesus Christ in human flesh
[25:36] at that point yeah that was God getting
[25:40] just some elements of the earth putting
[25:42] it over his theophany but we needed a
[25:45] kinsman we needed somebody to go back to
[25:48] that Genesis 1:26 and save that man yes
[25:52] so we needed God in human flesh to begin
[25:55] the creation of God to do that so just
[25:57] think that in your mind
[25:58] we'll go love genesis 1:26 and that's
[26:01] where it comes up right here in our
[26:03] teaching so it's 9:57 let's go ahead and
[26:05] go upstairs okay
