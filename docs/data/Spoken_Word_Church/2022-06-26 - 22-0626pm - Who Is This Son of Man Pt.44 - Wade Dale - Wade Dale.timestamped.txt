[33:15] here if we could get the hardness of our
[33:18] hearts away

[33:23] is christ in our midst
[33:25] he promised to be
[33:28] how would you know him not by the way he
[33:30] looked but by the works he done
[33:33] that's what he promised and he said he
[33:35] would do god help us tonight
[33:37] that when we leave here my prayer is
[33:39] that i'll just say it with my eyes open

[34:09] that you would just make it more real to
[34:10] our heart lord
[34:12] that you would make us lord to be into
[34:14] your image mold us

[34:18] be conformed
[34:19] and transformed
[34:21] into your image lord we're we're so as
[34:24] people say we're stuck down here in this
[34:25] worldly time but lord we're looking for
[34:28] a heavenly place
[34:29] we're looking for us now as we are
[34:31] sitting in heavenly places in christ
[34:32] jesus to our soul that the rest of us
[34:35] lord will be caught up lord because
[34:36] there's always sicknesses in the body
[34:38] and different things going on lord that
[34:40] we need prayer for that we need faith
[34:42] for today i believe lord if we'll listen
[34:44] just for a few moments to what you've
[34:46] said already that it'll lift our faith
[34:48] lord to a different level father we pray
[34:50] that you should be with the ones that
[34:51] are sick the ones that are not with us
[34:53] the ones on the internet father we pray
[34:55] that you'd be with them be the ones that
[34:56] are traveling brother ryan sister gabby
[34:58] and the kids lord keep them safe as they
[35:00] travel long journey lord and be with
[35:02] them take care of each one lord father
[35:04] just give us today our daily bread be
[35:06] with our pastor and keep him strong lord
[35:08] strengthen him and bless us and keep us
[35:10] in jesus name
[35:12] amen
[35:15] all right
[35:16] in the beginning was the word the word
[35:18] was with god and word was god
[35:20] and the word was made flesh and dwelt
[35:21] among us and we beheld his glory as the
[35:23] glory of the only begotten of the father
[35:25] full of grace and truth now here's we're
[35:27] going to shift the gears here just for a
[35:29] minute listen to this romans 12 verse 2.
[35:31] this is where i kind of got the thought
[35:32] from
[35:33] and be not conformed to this world
[35:36] all right
[35:37] if you're born again you're not
[35:39] if you're not born again you are
[35:42] all right but be transformed by the
[35:44] renewing of your mind now remember
[35:47] god took the heart satan took the mind
[35:50] so there's something we got to overcome
[35:52] it's our mind if we're born again in our
[35:54] heart then our mind is what's going to
[35:56] be playing tricks on us
[35:59] listen your soul if it's born again does
[36:02] not god doesn't play tricks on you
[36:05] the devil's the only person that'll play
[36:06] trick on you amen and it comes from up
[36:09] here not down here
[36:10] okay
[36:12] but be transformed by the renewing of
[36:14] your mind look that you may prove
[36:16] that you may prove god puts you here to
[36:18] do something that you may prove
[36:21] what is that good
[36:22] and acceptable and perfect
[36:25] will of god what's the will of god his
[36:27] word
[36:28] and what are we here to do manifest the
[36:30] word of god for i say through the grace
[36:33] given unto me to every man that is among
[36:34] you not to think of himself more highly
[36:36] than he ought to think
[36:38] amen if you do the lord's going to knock
[36:41] you down i promise you
[36:43] but to think soberly according as god
[36:46] hath dealt this is where i got my
[36:47] thought according as god hath dealt to
[36:50] every man
[36:51] and woman
[36:53] the measure of faith
[36:56] measure
[36:58] of faith all right listen for as we have
[37:00] many members in one body and all members
[37:02] have not the same office
[37:04] so we being many are one body in christ
[37:06] and everyone remembers one of another
[37:08] having then gifts differing according to
[37:10] the grace that is given unto us whether
[37:13] prophecy let us prophesy according to
[37:15] the
[37:16] proportion
[37:19] of faith now there's two things right
[37:21] there you got
[37:22] you got a measure of faith
[37:25] and you've got a proportion of faith
[37:26] what is proportion it comes from the
[37:28] word
[37:29] proportion
[37:30] if you have a proportion you have a
[37:32] a set aside
[37:33] none of you today
[37:35] had to have faith that you could get up
[37:38] here and preach today but me
[37:42] so that was my job but now when i
[37:45] announce someone else is going to preach
[37:46] then that measure of faith goes over to
[37:48] that person that proportion of
[37:50] uh well anxiety to some goes over goes
[37:53] over to that person but you gotta have
[37:54] faith when you stand up here you gotta
[37:56] have faith that you can get it to the
[37:58] people and that you what don't think
[38:00] highly of yourself but you believe that
[38:01] god can use a gift and that he can speak
[38:03] to you now man you may be seated
[38:06] so a measure of faith and a proportion
[38:08] of faith that's what we're going to talk
[38:09] about today
[38:10] if you listen just a little bit it'll
[38:12] kind of help us all because sometimes we
[38:14] have issues where we say well i don't
[38:16] know if i have faith for this and and i
[38:18] see these people this i was just reading
[38:20] a quote and i'll read some wednesday
[38:22] night because i'm going to do part two
[38:23] on wednesday
[38:25] wednesday night but brother brown said
[38:26] faith has hair on his chest
[38:30] big muscles hair on his chest
[38:33] and never should cower to the devil
[38:36] always should be burly he said
[38:39] and we'll read that but you got to
[38:40] remember too he said you can be burly
[38:42] but don't be
[38:43] bullish
[38:45] you remember i think it was not a a
[38:47] allen but jack cole he would if somebody
[38:49] had a back problem and they come up to
[38:51] the altar to be prayed for and they're
[38:53] bent over he'd just take and grab them
[38:54] by the shoulders and you know give them
[38:56] a chiropractic
[38:58] adjustment to build their faith
[39:01] whack them upside the head you know and
[39:03] do all these things to what to try to
[39:04] build their faith but brother brown said
[39:07] you never saw william branham do that
[39:10] he uh so most of the time he had that
[39:12] little finger and that little finger was
[39:14] doing this
[39:16] a lot of times he would pray for him but
[39:18] most of the time he goes sister
[39:20] brother
[39:23] what is that that's gentile we'll talk
[39:24] about in just a minute that's gentile
[39:26] faith
[39:27] jew faith sorry jews faith is laying out
[39:30] of hands
[39:31] you got to touch something you got to
[39:33] make me feel this thing come up and down
[39:36] me
[39:38] like an ice cube
[39:41] this ain't an ice cube faith that we're
[39:43] talking about
[39:45] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[39:46] god they are the sons of god we got to
[39:48] get to into this birth again because
[39:50] when you get look
[39:52] brother brown says have faith and be
[39:53] born again now listen that's not the
[39:55] same faith as being as healing faith
[40:03] have faith and be born again brother
[40:04] brown said a prostitute can come across
[40:06] the pulpit
[40:08] come across come across the audience
[40:11] she's not got born again faith
[40:13] she's a
[40:15] but she believes in faith of that person
[40:18] and she gets her healing the prophet of
[40:20] god said she'd get her healing where
[40:21] somebody else wouldn't get their healing
[40:22] because what you did you're walking up
[40:24] going oh i i did i slided my brother i
[40:26] paid somebody a wrong amount of money i
[40:29] i sped to get to church and you're going
[40:31] through all these things
[40:32] and the prostitute just walks up and
[40:34] says i believe what he says
[40:36] and they get their healing but it's not
[40:38] healing for the new birth
[40:41] not faith for the new birth it's the
[40:43] healing of the body not the healing of
[40:45] the soul we'll talk about in just a
[40:46] minute brother brown said have faith and
[40:47] be born again that's the healing of the
[40:49] soul
[40:51] so that's a measure of faith i hope you
[40:53] can get through this
[40:55] uh terence is talking about people need
[40:57] to sleep
[40:58] to um
[40:59] get their beauty rest i some of y'all
[41:01] ought to be the beautifulest people the
[41:02] most beautiful people in the world
[41:07] preach it brother i believe will
[41:10] for we have not received
[41:13] not received the spirit of bondage again
[41:14] to fear but we have received the spirit
[41:16] of adoption whereby we cry
[41:18] about father the spirit of self-bearing
[41:19] witness with our spirit
[41:21] that we are the children of god
[41:23] and if children of god then heirs what
[41:25] is what do we get we get that faith
[41:28] listen everything you do we'll read in
[41:30] just a few minutes everything you do is
[41:31] built on faith
[41:33] everything you do is built on faith
[41:36] even in the natural world a lot of
[41:37] things but now spiritually you have to
[41:39] have faith in something you've never
[41:41] seen before
[41:42] you got to have faith in somebody you've
[41:44] never seen before
[41:46] you got to have faith that the words on
[41:48] that page are going to come alive
[41:50] so everything's built on faith
[41:54] if children than heirs heirs of god and
[41:56] joint heirs with christ if so be that we
[41:58] suffer with him
[42:00] what does faith tell us to do we're
[42:02] going to have to suffer
[42:04] the trying of our faith
[42:07] is much more precious than gold trying
[42:10] of our faith is more precious than all
[42:11] the roman catholic gold in the world
[42:14] your faith because you know what it does
[42:15] it builds your faith
[42:17] we don't want to ever knock down we want
[42:19] to build amen and man we want to build
[42:21] our faith
[42:24] sister christina and i were talking this
[42:25] just a few minutes ago
[42:27] i think she had a good
[42:28] idea i think what we're going to do is i
[42:31] want everybody before we leave to go to
[42:33] ohio
[42:34] to write down where you think you're at
[42:35] in the pyramid
[42:38] then when we get back
[42:41] see if you're still at that same
[42:46] anyway
[42:49] we were talking about you know idiot
[42:50] secret secrecies of us 40 people
[42:53] traveling together so i said we may have
[42:55] our first split by the time we get back
[42:57] who knows
[42:59] so
[43:01] not going to throw you under the bus i
[43:02] promise
[43:05] if children deniers heirs of god and
[43:07] join heirs with christ if so be that we
[43:08] suffer with him that we may be glorified
[43:11] together and we look at justification we
[43:13] talked about that this morning chopped
[43:14] off your past sins that's baby form
[43:16] justification we know that we have been
[43:19] forgiven now look you've got to have
[43:21] faith for that because you know what in
[43:23] your mind you can remember all those
[43:26] things that you did
[43:28] in your mind but in your heart if you're
[43:30] born again your slate is clean
[43:33] everybody with me you got to believe
[43:35] that your slate is clean
[43:37] god forgive me for what i did
[43:40] all right then we're going to move on up
[43:42] if we maybe by christmas we'll get into
[43:44] the sanctification and justification in
[43:47] the pyramid to where that has to happen
[43:49] all the time
[43:51] god forgive me for what i did i'm sorry
[43:54] i did this to my brother slate's clean
[43:57] slate's clean
[43:59] move on slate's clean
[44:01] keep confessing slate's clean
[44:04] amen
[44:05] then sanctification i die daily there's
[44:07] things that has to die away from me the
[44:09] unclean spirit is in my memories and
[44:11] conscious affection imagination
[44:13] and that's got to be what
[44:16] unclean spirit goes out amen
[44:18] we got to have faith though
[44:21] to believe
[44:22] it can be done
[44:25] you've got to have faith you can have a
[44:27] measure of faith to believe
[44:29] that this is being done your measure of
[44:31] faith may be different from mine we're
[44:32] going to look at it man what is measure
[44:35] it tells you what something can hold
[44:37] it tells you how long something is
[44:39] all right so we'll get to that in just a
[44:40] second if you'll stay awake long enough
[44:43] sanctification remember we're looking at
[44:44] that is we are talking about the unclean
[44:47] spirit going out of your soul
[44:49] that's baby form sanctification down
[44:51] here before you even get in the pyramid
[44:54] all the way down here
[44:57] everybody with me
[44:59] that's getting that unclean spirit out
[45:00] of your soul
[45:01] that old adamic nature is still tied to
[45:04] your spirit but in your soul is either
[45:07] faith
[45:08] that we're talking about today faith or
[45:10] doubt
[45:11] one of the two there's not an in-between
[45:13] all right
[45:14] and if you're if it's faith then it's
[45:16] driven out the unbelief
[45:20] then you come to the sanctification in
[45:22] the pyramid where you have to do the
[45:23] same thing you have to believe or have
[45:26] faith that you're going to go up to that
[45:28] through that pyramid and have faith
[45:31] brother brown said rapturing faith
[45:34] but see rapture and faith
[45:36] is not divine healing faith
[45:38] rapturing faith is not the faith to get
[45:41] born again with
[45:42] oh by the way it's all faith i know that
[45:46] but can you can you go with me here the
[45:48] holy ghost is one holy ghost
[45:50] when you get born again by the baptism
[45:52] of the holy ghost it is the same holy
[45:54] ghost but it's a different anointing
[45:56] when you get up on top of that pyramid
[45:58] amen
[45:59] it's not another it's more of
[46:03] it's more of so you have baby faith you
[46:05] have little faith and then it grows it
[46:07] gets bigger and bigger as brother ryan
[46:09] said it gets muscles and it gets bigger
[46:10] remember they see the
[46:12] what was the vision that he saw that
[46:14] satan was trying to beat him up you know
[46:16] and he kept saying boo
[46:18] boo devil boot devil and the devil
[46:19] started getting smaller and he started
[46:21] getting bigger that's why i said faith
[46:22] got hair on his chest
[46:24] faith is bold
[46:26] we'll get to that in just a second but
[46:27] sanctification we're talking about the
[46:28] sanctification of the soul
[46:30] to get that unclean spirit out then what
[46:32] does god do i've read this a hundred
[46:34] times i'm gonna read it again because he
[46:35] gives you a new spirit he does not give
[46:37] you the holy spirit
[46:39] he gives you a new spirit and you to
[46:41] believe
[46:42] that you went through justification you
[46:44] got to have faith that you went through
[46:45] sanctification listen you've got to have
[46:47] faith that god can do this first
[46:51] there's no other person in this world
[46:53] can wipe your sins out
[46:55] no one
[46:56] not a person not a priest not a preacher
[46:58] no one it's god alone that wipes your
[47:01] slate clean
[47:03] but you got to have faith in that
[47:06] can you can you
[47:07] hold on to that no like i said before
[47:09] can you hold on to the love of your wife
[47:11] no but you can display it
[47:13] you can display that love that you have
[47:15] for your wife you can display it but you
[47:17] cannot take it out and say here i'll
[47:19] give you some of this love
[47:20] nope can't do that
[47:22] but he'll give you a new spirit
[47:25] and what does that new spirit do let me
[47:27] just stop for justice what does that new
[47:28] spirit do that new spirit like he said
[47:31] before
[47:32] it makes you more gentle more settled
[47:34] down
[47:34] or you could he couldn't even live with
[47:36] you so what's he doing brother brown
[47:37] tells us if we dig a little deeper into
[47:39] sanctification
[47:41] that
[47:42] that he puts you in a religious order
[47:45] you're in a religious atmosphere i
[47:46] remember when i first got sanctified
[47:50] in my journey i obviously came to church
[47:53] at justification because that's where i
[47:54] had to come i had to come right here
[47:57] and say god forgive me and my sins i
[47:59] don't want to be the person i was before
[48:02] and i believe he did that see that was
[48:04] my faith
[48:05] in faith but now that faith has got to
[48:07] continue on to the birth
[48:10] amen all right everybody with me
[48:12] but during that time i got a new spirit
[48:15] all that other stuff that cursing and
[48:16] lying and stealing
[48:21] it all left
[48:23] i know it did i'm the one that lives
[48:25] with me
[48:26] but that was only sanctification and i
[48:28] knew that because of the teaching of
[48:30] this church
[48:31] not to stay in that condition not to
[48:33] stay in that well i've quit all this so
[48:36] i must be in the message like i told
[48:38] brother dale they said well you believe
[48:39] brother around was the prophet it was in
[48:40] 1968.
[48:42] you believe brother brown was probably
[48:43] yeah well you're in the message nice
[48:45] lie the
[48:46] devil the devil believes this message to
[48:49] a degree
[48:50] he sure hangs around it enough
[48:53] he's sitting here
[48:53] [Music]
[49:00] today that's your spirit
[49:04] he gives you a new spirit
[49:06] the thing god has to do is give you a
[49:08] new spirit make your nature a little
[49:09] more gentle
[49:10] i'll give you a new spirit then
[49:13] then he takes and put his spirit
[49:16] into you
[49:18] they're right with me that's the new
[49:19] birth is when he takes his part of his
[49:22] soul
[49:24] part of his eternal life
[49:27] part of his eternal being
[49:29] part of the elohim
[49:31] part of the
[49:33] creator
[49:35] and he puts it inside of you
[49:37] because you've come to a place he
[49:38] softens you up he's had you on the
[49:40] potter's wheel he's made a wonderful
[49:42] vessel out of it and then what does he
[49:44] do he puts that vessel into service
[49:48] clean and set aside is sanctification
[49:51] put in service it's when the pot's made
[49:54] and that he knows he's gonna put water
[49:56] in it but it's gotta go through a kill
[49:58] k-i-l-n gotta go through kills gotta be
[50:00] fire it's gotta be fire
[50:02] baptized
[50:03] once it's fire baptized it can hold
[50:05] water
[50:07] it can be used it's a vessel of honor
[50:10] the bible says
[50:13] because if god makes it
[50:15] it's always honorable
[50:17] if god makes it
[50:19] the thing that me and my wife made no
[50:22] that's children to make a choice but
[50:24] when god makes it when god gives you a
[50:26] new birth
[50:28] then he makes it honorable
[50:30] so whatever he puts inside of you is him
[50:33] not a second person of a trinity
[50:36] seeing you have what purified your souls
[50:38] souls we're talking about soul
[50:40] purification here all right
[50:42] not just a good thought as we're going
[50:44] to talk about in faith in just a few
[50:45] minutes
[50:47] in obeying the what the truth
[50:50] through the spirit unto unfeigned love
[50:52] of the brethren see that you love one
[50:53] another
[50:55] with a pure heart fervently
[50:58] being born again not a corruptible seed
[51:00] but of incorruptible by what by the word
[51:02] of god
[51:04] which liveth in the body forever
[51:06] then ephesians tell us that we're being
[51:08] predestinated we've obtained an
[51:10] inheritance being predestinated now each
[51:13] one of us
[51:14] i'm going to we'll talk about in just a
[51:15] minute the measure of faith our measure
[51:18] of faith is what
[51:19] our measure of faith is to go to a body
[51:21] change
[51:22] now the measure of faith of lutheran
[51:24] wesley was not that
[51:27] they got a measure but it wasn't the
[51:28] measure of the fullness
[51:30] all right
[51:31] everybody with me on that so they didn't
[51:33] have to they didn't have it wasn't
[51:35] required that luther say okay we got to
[51:38] have a resurrection before rapture
[51:41] but i'm telling you like i said this
[51:43] morning we've got to have a resurrection
[51:45] before we have a rapture because that's
[51:47] our requirement and you know what if god
[51:49] requires it he doesn't wait and say
[51:53] oh i need to give him something extra
[51:54] because i i miss something no he
[51:56] equipped everything we needed in the
[51:58] word of god and that's why god had to
[52:00] send us a prophet
[52:03] listen this prophet helps build my faith
[52:08] when i listen to the word of god it
[52:09] helps build my faith
[52:11] because you know what i see somebody
[52:13] that believes it
[52:15] amen
[52:17] there's a little kentucky man seventh
[52:18] grade education that god used i believe
[52:21] that god sent him
[52:22] and i believe god spoke through him
[52:25] oh lord and here's the argument that
[52:27] you're hearing now well was it brother
[52:29] branham speaking or was it inspired or
[52:31] was it not i
[52:34] if it does me good
[52:37] it's inspired
[52:39] he got it
[52:40] if it does me good it's inspired
[52:44] if he says i ain't tote and all of it
[52:46] it's inspired
[52:48] okay
[52:51] and him also you trusted
[52:54] after
[52:57] so you put your trust in the world
[52:58] before that right so now you put your
[53:00] trust in god
[53:02] after that you heard the word of truth
[53:04] like i said before faith has got to have
[53:06] something that's why it's a foundation
[53:08] it's got to have something to draw from
[53:10] i can't have faith in something that
[53:14] like what i like to say about car wall
[53:15] linda we'll talk about in just a minute
[53:17] i have no faith for that
[53:19] don't put me on a tight wire
[53:22] 300 feet up in the air
[53:24] just about that big around
[53:26] uh-uh i ain't got faith for that
[53:28] but somebody does
[53:31] i don't have faith for all this other
[53:32] stuff that people do but they do that's
[53:34] natural faith
[53:36] but listen in spiritual faith though
[53:38] there is divisions and there is heights
[53:40] and different things but we all have the
[53:43] measure of that same faith
[53:46] everybody with me you have a measure i
[53:48] always
[53:49] um
[53:51] brother mo different ones you know he
[53:52] always he would build your faith he
[53:54] would he'd give you
[53:55] 10 or 15 scriptures
[53:57] of how god can heal you and all these
[53:59] different things and he builds your
[54:00] faith by what by giving you something
[54:03] by giving you the word of god
[54:06] and you can see different ones and they
[54:07] have different gifts
[54:09] gifts of different parts
[54:11] but we all have the same faith we're all
[54:13] looking at the same thing but there's
[54:15] measure of faith or a proportion and
[54:18] we'll get to that in just a second
[54:20] so he gives us the earnest of our
[54:22] inheritance your new birth is your
[54:23] earnest of your inheritance you must
[54:25] what the prophet of god says have faith
[54:28] and be born again
[54:30] until the redemption of the purchased
[54:31] possession which will be what which will
[54:33] be brother brown said rapturing faith
[54:37] enoch please god with rapture
[54:40] rapturing faith not just faith rapturing
[54:44] faith
[54:45] because without faith you can't please
[54:47] god we'll read that in just a few
[54:48] minutes
[54:50] these things have i spoken unto you john
[54:52] 14
[54:53] being yet present with you but the
[54:54] comforter which is the holy ghost whom
[54:56] the father will send in my name so
[54:58] what's the name of the holy ghost jesus
[54:59] christ
[55:00] so who you got inside of you i got the
[55:02] holy ghost you got jesus christ
[55:04] all right the father will send in my
[55:06] name he shall teach you all things and
[55:08] bring all things to your remembrance
[55:10] whatsoever i have said
[55:11] unto you
[55:13] listen that's one way that's one way
[55:16] that you can tell
[55:18] that you're heading towards something
[55:21] of the new birth and we're going to read
[55:23] in just a minute is that you'll think on
[55:25] these things how many times brother dale
[55:27] said that
[55:28] hundreds of thousands of times and
[55:29] brother louise
[55:30] think on these things what think on what
[55:32] i used to think on
[55:34] i'm not going to tell you what i used to
[55:35] think of
[55:38] oh y'all never did i'm just preaching to
[55:39] a different crowd
[55:43] that's i used to not think i used to not
[55:45] think of bible scripture
[55:52] thank you i kind of finally got the
[55:54] right crowd
[55:57] i didn't think on bible scripture i
[55:58] didn't get up in the morning saying well
[56:00] on sunday i'm going to go to church and
[56:01] i'm going to be with the saints of god
[56:03] and xyz i didn't think of that
[56:06] my conversation as the bible says was of
[56:09] the world
[56:10] because i had that nature and that drew
[56:12] me to that side
[56:15] all right but when faith comes you put
[56:17] your faith in the word of god
[56:20] not in the world
[56:22] and then he will bring things to your
[56:24] remembrance have you not been sitting
[56:26] just somewhere and god drop down and
[56:28] give you a message
[56:32] sisters brothers and he does not drop
[56:34] down and you start thinking about the
[56:36] things of god
[56:37] well you know what
[56:38] that's not the devil
[56:41] especially if he brings you something
[56:43] you go man what a revelation i i can't
[56:45] wait to write that down or i can't wait
[56:47] to tell somebody that that wasn't the
[56:49] devil that was god
[56:51] and he was using you
[56:54] as a portal to get it wrote down or to
[56:56] get it to where you can testify about
[56:58] something
[57:00] so he'll bring all things to your
[57:01] remembrance whatsoever i have said unto
[57:03] you
[57:04] man sometimes you get to thinking about
[57:06] stuff and i know we all do brother dale
[57:07] said it many times
[57:10] and you get think about you anything man
[57:11] if i can start preaching right now
[57:14] i'd save a hundred people
[57:16] if i could just get and then you go okay
[57:18] wait man i'm driving down the road and i
[57:20] you know this was in the age before you
[57:21] had something you could you know you
[57:23] could put it in your
[57:24] notes and you'd forget it by the time
[57:26] you got to church or you forget it by
[57:28] the time you got got home well you know
[57:30] what it wasn't for that time
[57:33] or god would have brought it back to
[57:34] what your remembrance
[57:35] amen
[57:36] but but you know what it's still in this
[57:38] in that computer and it's going around
[57:39] and around just like all that
[57:41] information and this computer is still
[57:42] in there going round and round
[57:44] what i put in there a year ago it's
[57:46] still in there going around in that hard
[57:48] drive and whenever i need it
[57:50] hit the button it'll pop right back up
[57:52] same way with me and you faith for the
[57:54] time we're going to talk about that in
[57:56] just a minute acts 1 verse 4 is being
[57:58] assembled together well let's continue
[57:59] on down we know what jesus said is that
[58:01] you shall receive power
[58:03] after the holy ghost has come upon you
[58:05] you shall be witnesses unto me now why
[58:08] would god need you've got to be born
[58:10] again to be a true witness
[58:12] because other than that what is your
[58:14] witness the world
[58:17] come on somebody the witnesses is the
[58:19] world if you're not born again
[58:21] but if you're born again
[58:23] and let me say this real quick
[58:26] because that is power mighty work we
[58:27] know that strength
[58:29] but you see the people of the world
[58:31] and they go to church they try to do the
[58:33] best they can
[58:35] some will try to do the best they can do
[58:38] but there's a piece missing somewhere
[58:41] you and i have that piece
[58:43] i don't even mean p-i-e-c-e or
[58:45] p-i-c-s-p-a-c-e
[58:48] we've got peace that we know it's that
[58:51] piece of the puzzle that the world does
[58:53] not have
[58:54] i'm sorry but that's that gene of god
[58:57] that talks to you where it doesn't talk
[58:59] to the world
[59:00] he doesn't have to talk to the world the
[59:03] world is not his
[59:05] you know what the world's ours
[59:10] i'm going to live on this world this is
[59:12] my earth
[59:13] my future home is going to sit on this
[59:15] earth
[59:16] when he cleans it off like he's cleaning
[59:19] me and you off
[59:21] everybody with me
[59:23] he told us the evidence or what would
[59:25] happen after being baptized with the
[59:26] holy ghost was that you would have the
[59:28] teacher come and teach you all truth but
[59:31] that teacher was an inside teacher not
[59:32] an outside teacher
[59:34] those who were filled with the holy
[59:35] ghost heard the word received it and
[59:38] look and lived by it
[59:41] see that's where the world the word the
[59:43] peace of the world that they're missing
[59:44] they say oh i believe that jesus died
[59:46] for my sins i believe that he's the
[59:48] savior and go through justification
[59:52] but they won't take the long hair
[59:55] they won't take to wear another dresses
[59:58] they'll get up there and sing
[1:00:00] oh just worship god
[1:00:02] i was watching this morning that same
[1:00:04] song y'all are saying in psalms 34.
[1:00:06] there was a choir singing it the one
[1:00:08] that somebody sent a link for the one at
[1:00:10] new york
[1:00:12] oh yeah i mean look at them
[1:00:14] one lady had on a set of earrings i
[1:00:16] don't know how her ears supported them
[1:00:19] i mean she'd do this and it'd be like
[1:00:22] i've seen them look like fishing lures
[1:00:23] but i never seen a lot like this there's
[1:00:25] like two ten cans on her ears
[1:00:27] but she's just not been taught i thought
[1:00:29] lord they're saying to you but they
[1:00:30] don't know who they're singing to
[1:00:32] they're singing to a piece of you
[1:00:35] they're not saying to all of you they've
[1:00:36] not given their all
[1:00:39] we give our all
[1:00:40] we don't do the things of the world
[1:00:42] because we give our all we it's not
[1:00:43] because of do's and don'ts it's not
[1:00:45] because the prophet of god said so
[1:00:47] listen we've already been through that
[1:00:50] we coming the message in the 60s it was
[1:00:52] do this don't do that and that's what
[1:00:53] the message was
[1:00:56] that was not what the message was sent
[1:00:57] for
[1:01:00] sure it was sent to clean us up amen but
[1:01:02] to clean our soul up first
[1:01:05] to get us to when we raise our hands we
[1:01:07] know who we're raising our hands to to
[1:01:09] know when we come to church we know who
[1:01:11] we're coming to church for to know that
[1:01:13] that man is the man that has an intimate
[1:01:16] relationship with us not just he died on
[1:01:18] the cross 2000 years ago and i'm
[1:01:20] connected to him sure you're connected
[1:01:22] to him by a little bit of faith
[1:01:24] but what is your faith believing what he
[1:01:27] said
[1:01:28] so if it's written in the bible amen
[1:01:34] come on
[1:01:36] those who were filled with the holy
[1:01:37] ghost heard the word
[1:01:39] received it and lived by it
[1:01:41] those who did not have the spirit
[1:01:44] heard it only as carnal men
[1:01:48] put a wrong interpretation on it and
[1:01:50] went into sin we're going to read in
[1:01:52] just a minute that god told us one time
[1:01:54] in the book of jude he said earnestly
[1:01:56] contend for the faith that was once
[1:01:59] delivered
[1:02:01] that was a faith lost
[1:02:06] was a lost faith why are you going to
[1:02:07] try to get it back if you already got it
[1:02:10] it was a lost faith
[1:02:12] you know what that to me that's an end
[1:02:14] time scripture that's what the prophecy
[1:02:16] god did do to he came to restore
[1:02:18] that contention of that faith
[1:02:21] that was once delivered to what
[1:02:23] the early church
[1:02:25] water baptism correct no eternal hell
[1:02:28] one god all that that was the faith they
[1:02:31] had in the first church age
[1:02:34] but it was eroded and man
[1:02:37] got involved
[1:02:38] put a wrong interpretation on it and
[1:02:41] look what he said it did he said and it
[1:02:44] went into
[1:02:46] sin
[1:02:48] listen
[1:02:50] unbelief is sin
[1:02:55] in every age and every age is the age of
[1:02:57] the holy ghost for the true believer
[1:02:59] i say in heaven every age the evidence
[1:03:01] look the evidence was the same
[1:03:04] the evidence was the same
[1:03:06] justification saying case baptism holy
[1:03:08] ghost
[1:03:08] you had to get rid of things there was
[1:03:10] things you had to do but when you come
[1:03:11] up to martin luther
[1:03:14] drink a beer
[1:03:15] smoke pot
[1:03:16] talk about god that's all he required
[1:03:18] though it's all god required
[1:03:21] that was the faith for the time
[1:03:24] those who had the spirit the teacher
[1:03:25] heard the word and that spirit in them
[1:03:27] took the word and taught it to them
[1:03:32] and they were of the group that heard
[1:03:33] the messenger and his message and took
[1:03:37] it
[1:03:38] and lived it and that's what we're doing
[1:03:39] we're taking it and we're living it
[1:03:42] we are the living message of the hour
[1:03:44] the final voice to the final age
[1:03:47] under her messenger is the voice of the
[1:03:50] bride
[1:03:51] i didn't say that god did
[1:03:53] everybody with me
[1:03:55] all right
[1:03:57] second peter says simon peter servant
[1:03:59] apostle of jesus christ to them that
[1:04:00] have obtained obtained
[1:04:03] so there's an obtaining of faith
[1:04:07] of like precious faith
[1:04:11] with us through the righteousness of god
[1:04:13] and our savior jesus christ grace and
[1:04:15] peace be multiplied unto you through the
[1:04:17] knowledge of god and jesus our lord
[1:04:19] according to his divine power or his
[1:04:21] divine dunamis
[1:04:23] has given unto us all things that
[1:04:24] pertain unto what life and godliness
[1:04:27] through the knowledge of him that have
[1:04:28] called us to glory and virtue whereby or
[1:04:31] given unto us exceeding great precious
[1:04:33] promises that by these you might be
[1:04:35] partakers of the divine nature having
[1:04:37] escaped the corruption thank god having
[1:04:40] escaped
[1:04:42] the tribulation
[1:04:44] having escaped
[1:04:46] the white throne judgment
[1:04:49] that is in the world through lust and
[1:04:50] besides this giving all diligence add to
[1:04:53] your faith now it becomes a possession
[1:04:56] it becomes your faith
[1:04:59] add to your faith hebrews 11 verse 1
[1:05:01] says now faith
[1:05:03] all right
[1:05:05] you need a now faith as brother joe
[1:05:07] greene preached here one time before i
[1:05:08] like that it's not just now faith is the
[1:05:11] substance he says now faith
[1:05:13] the faith you need right now is what
[1:05:14] i've been talking about and i'll be
[1:05:15] talking about a little bit more it's a
[1:05:17] measure of faith
[1:05:19] now faith is the substance of things
[1:05:21] hoped for the evidence of things not
[1:05:23] even seen for by the elders obtained
[1:05:26] what they obtained a good report
[1:05:29] they didn't receive rapture in faith
[1:05:30] they obtained a good report because they
[1:05:32] weren't born again
[1:05:34] come on now none of these people listen
[1:05:37] hebrews 11 1 is what it's the hall of
[1:05:41] faith
[1:05:42] everybody with me hebrews 11
[1:05:45] is the hall of is the hall of faith
[1:05:48] not a hall of fame a hall of faith
[1:05:51] not one of them had the new birth
[1:05:53] not one of them had what you have
[1:05:56] not one of them
[1:06:01] think about that
[1:06:03] and their faith put them in the bible
[1:06:09] through faith we understand that the
[1:06:10] worlds were framed by the word of god so
[1:06:12] that things which are seen were not made
[1:06:14] of things which do appear
[1:06:15] by faith abel offered under god a more
[1:06:17] excellent sacrifice than cain by which
[1:06:19] he obtained obtained witness that he was
[1:06:22] righteous god testifying of his gifts
[1:06:25] and by being dead yet speaketh by faith
[1:06:28] enoch here's one we always go to
[1:06:31] this is the only time that god talks
[1:06:32] about he really says look without faith
[1:06:34] it's impossible to please god by faith
[1:06:37] enoch was translated that he should not
[1:06:39] see death and was not found because god
[1:06:41] had translated him what for before his
[1:06:44] translation he had this testimony that
[1:06:47] he pleased god
[1:06:50] all right
[1:06:51] paul
[1:06:52] if we stay right there we're hung
[1:06:56] paul says but
[1:06:57] without faith it's impossible to please
[1:07:00] him
[1:07:01] for he that cometh to god must believe
[1:07:03] that what he is what he is god
[1:07:07] and that he is a rewarder
[1:07:09] of those that come at church every once
[1:07:11] in a while he's a rewarder of those that
[1:07:13] sneak around and wear pants and curse
[1:07:15] and do all that other stuff no
[1:07:19] it's a lie
[1:07:24] we need to stop lying to ourselves
[1:07:26] stop lying but he's a rewarder he'll
[1:07:30] reward you
[1:07:31] if you diligently seek him
[1:07:33] listen this is a fight it's a battle
[1:07:38] the picnic
[1:07:43] you'll fight listen
[1:07:45] when god told the children of israel he
[1:07:47] said that's your land
[1:07:49] did he not
[1:07:50] that's your land told him exactly where
[1:07:52] it was told him exactly where to go took
[1:07:55] them 40 years to do it kind of like us a
[1:07:57] little slow but he said this is your
[1:07:59] land but now when they walked up and
[1:08:01] they caught to the land what they have
[1:08:03] 12 spies
[1:08:04] you've heard my sermon on 10 lion
[1:08:06] preachers well 10 lion preachers 40
[1:08:08] years around around the
[1:08:09] wilderness of sin
[1:08:11] two people said
[1:08:12] we got it what did they do they heard
[1:08:15] what god said and said we believe what
[1:08:16] god said
[1:08:18] no circumstance
[1:08:20] all the other 10 brought the
[1:08:21] circumstances in we're grasshoppers
[1:08:23] they're huge they're annex boys and
[1:08:25] they're they're they're sons of the
[1:08:27] giant
[1:08:29] so they wandered around but you know
[1:08:30] what god told them god said they steal
[1:08:31] your land
[1:08:33] you're still gonna possess these like
[1:08:34] this this land but you know what he said
[1:08:36] he didn't say he didn't say i give it to
[1:08:38] you when i fight
[1:08:42] soon as they crossed over as we were
[1:08:44] talking about several months before
[1:08:47] manasseh and all them they got their
[1:08:48] inheritance on this side but as soon as
[1:08:50] they walked in that promised land here
[1:08:52] comes the battles
[1:08:53] and here come the ones here comes
[1:08:55] manasseh and reuben and all them and
[1:08:57] they come to help and they fought battle
[1:08:58] after battle after battle after battle
[1:09:00] so don't think you're going to get into
[1:09:02] your promised land and eat those big fat
[1:09:04] grapes
[1:09:05] not until you possess the whole land
[1:09:08] all right look so you cannot be saved
[1:09:10] without faith
[1:09:11] faith is something you have to believe
[1:09:13] it's there that's really nothing else
[1:09:15] will declare but faith
[1:09:17] now i'm trying to bring faith to you so
[1:09:19] that you can be ready for the prayer
[1:09:20] line in a few minutes now faith he that
[1:09:22] cometh to god must believe that he is
[1:09:24] what he is god
[1:09:25] and he'll do exactly what he said
[1:09:29] and it's impossible to please god
[1:09:31] without faith
[1:09:36] just because carl wallenda can
[1:09:38] you know walk 200 yards 300 feet tall to
[1:09:41] me that would be a superhuman feat but
[1:09:43] god didn't care one thing about it
[1:09:45] he cared about his soul
[1:09:47] that was it
[1:09:48] he wanted that man's soul he wants you
[1:09:50] he wants your soul
[1:09:52] he loves your talent because your talent
[1:09:54] is connected to that but he wants your
[1:09:56] soul because if your soul's not born
[1:09:58] again that talent's going to the devil
[1:10:01] every time
[1:10:03] and if you say you believe god you've
[1:10:05] never seen him so then you've got to
[1:10:07] believe it by faith and if you could see
[1:10:09] him it would be no more faith
[1:10:11] see when we get into the city when we
[1:10:13] get when we meet him in the air when we
[1:10:15] go to the marriage supper we don't have
[1:10:17] to believe anymore that we're going to
[1:10:19] see jesus that's right he'll be there
[1:10:22] but we've got to have faith in the
[1:10:24] journey to believe believeth
[1:10:27] and is baptized shall be saved
[1:10:30] anything that the senses declares no
[1:10:31] more faith it's a scientific fact it's
[1:10:34] not no more faith but you have to accept
[1:10:36] him by faith he that cometh to god must
[1:10:38] believe god and faith comes by hearing
[1:10:40] the word of god
[1:10:41] you must first believe this is god's
[1:10:43] word
[1:10:45] all right now look you must first
[1:10:46] believe this is god's word
[1:10:49] that's where the world's missing it
[1:10:50] because the faith they have in is part
[1:10:52] of this
[1:10:55] the part that uh some um unregenerated
[1:10:59] preacher
[1:11:01] lion preacher told him it was okay to do
[1:11:03] this it was okay to do that
[1:11:06] then they send then god sends the
[1:11:07] prophet to tell us the divine what
[1:11:09] interpreter of the word
[1:11:12] there's doubt in the world about the
[1:11:14] word of god
[1:11:17] amen
[1:11:19] this message of the hour should take all
[1:11:21] that doubt out
[1:11:23] you say brother white all that all of it
[1:11:26] brother brown said rapturing faith
[1:11:28] that's what we're heading towards lies
[1:11:30] in the books and the tapes
[1:11:35] okay
[1:11:37] but first you got to do what the bible
[1:11:38] says
[1:11:40] yeah you got to act right talk right
[1:11:43] spit white all that other stuff they
[1:11:44] always say
[1:11:45] i don't need that what is that where'd
[1:11:47] that go
[1:11:49] you must come to god by the word
[1:11:58] [Music]
[1:12:03] and said this is your call moses
[1:12:20] the vindicated word and there he went
[1:12:23] anyway it anointed the faith that was in
[1:12:25] him
[1:12:26] 99 and it anoints us when we see that
[1:12:28] we're living in the last days to find
[1:12:30] out that all these signs that we see
[1:12:32] being taken place that spoke of in the
[1:12:34] scripture would take place in the last
[1:12:36] days all the way from heaven to the
[1:12:38] political powers and the nature of the
[1:12:40] people and the demoralization of the
[1:12:41] world and among the women and how they
[1:12:43] would do in the last days and how the
[1:12:45] men would do and how the churches would
[1:12:47] do nothing else that
[1:12:49] that message you got
[1:12:52] well look at y'all you're sitting around
[1:12:55] and you're just as dull and dry hide and
[1:12:58] and look at us we're having a revival
[1:13:03] what are you going to do
[1:13:06] and they literally literally deny
[1:13:09] that brother brown was a prophet
[1:13:12] what are you going to do
[1:13:14] what are you going to do when they say
[1:13:16] you know what i'm going to do i'm going
[1:13:17] to do like
[1:13:18] i think brother dale said if they
[1:13:20] challenged me and said come up here
[1:13:21] we're going to drink this
[1:13:22] drink this you better hold me back
[1:13:24] because i'm going to come up here
[1:13:26] if i can't stand on something if i die
[1:13:27] i'm going to die
[1:13:30] don't ever make a challenge to the bride
[1:13:32] of jesus christ
[1:13:34] god's going to come on the scene and
[1:13:35] make that thing manifest i'll promise
[1:13:37] you there will be a showdown just like
[1:13:39] janice and jamborus there'll be a
[1:13:41] showdown just like and i since the fire
[1:13:43] there's going to be a time when we're
[1:13:45] going to be required to tell and stand
[1:13:48] the ground that we're on
[1:13:51] and you know what
[1:13:53] god said don't worry i'll even put he
[1:13:55] said look god even said look if you're
[1:13:57] sin to send to the magistrates or you're
[1:13:59] sent to the court or you're sent to
[1:14:01] before brothers he said
[1:14:03] you know what he was saying hey come on
[1:14:04] don't study
[1:14:05] don't study three or four days of what
[1:14:07] you're going to say he said i'll give it
[1:14:08] to you
[1:14:10] i'll give you exactly what to say in the
[1:14:12] time you need it
[1:14:14] so let's don't worry about it
[1:14:17] like i said before
[1:14:19] this message takes a worry out of my
[1:14:21] life
[1:14:27] now if you got one foot in one foot out
[1:14:30] no
[1:14:31] he's talking about moses let's get into
[1:14:33] this just for a minute this is your call
[1:14:35] moses i'm sending you i'm going to show
[1:14:37] you my glory now look moses didn't have
[1:14:39] the new birth he was anointed by the
[1:14:41] holy ghost
[1:14:42] everybody with me he was anointed for a
[1:14:44] job
[1:14:46] abraham was anointed for a job each one
[1:14:49] was anointed for a job but you and i are
[1:14:51] not just anointed for a job we're new
[1:14:53] birth believers that are anointed for a
[1:14:56] job
[1:14:56] so we've got double anointing
[1:15:00] we can't we can't lose
[1:15:03] but we can't fake it either
[1:15:05] go down there i'll be with you he didn't
[1:15:07] even need a stick
[1:15:10] had a word the word the vindicated word
[1:15:11] listen it wasn't even wrote down a piece
[1:15:13] of paper
[1:15:14] we've got all this right here we can we
[1:15:16] can look right at it
[1:15:18] moses walked up with what
[1:15:21] i saw bush burn
[1:15:23] and a man talked to me out of that bush
[1:15:26] moses you're kind of crazy you need to
[1:15:28] going over you've been a son too long
[1:15:30] moses said you just waited a little
[1:15:32] while
[1:15:32] if you don't let my people go you're
[1:15:34] fixing to find out who i talk to
[1:15:37] look but look what it done
[1:15:41] he didn't even need a stick he had the
[1:15:43] word the vindicated word and there he
[1:15:45] went
[1:15:46] it anointed
[1:15:48] the faith
[1:15:49] that was in him
[1:15:52] and anointed the faith that was in him
[1:15:55] listen moses believed in himself
[1:15:59] at first he didn't oh no
[1:16:01] then he didn't did he got a little bit
[1:16:03] he got you know god got a little tired
[1:16:05] of this moses saying i can't even talk
[1:16:07] right god he said okay you got a brother
[1:16:11] i'm gonna talk to your brother i'm gonna
[1:16:12] talk to you you're gonna tell your
[1:16:14] brother and your brother's gonna talk to
[1:16:15] the crowd
[1:16:17] [Music]
[1:16:18] it anoints us when we see that we're
[1:16:21] living in the last days to find out that
[1:16:24] all these signs that were taking place
[1:16:27] that spoke of in the scriptures would
[1:16:29] take place in the last days
[1:16:31] all the way from heaven to the political
[1:16:33] power
[1:16:34] the nature of the people
[1:16:36] now this is 1960
[1:16:41] what
[1:16:42] 1963.
[1:16:44] think about it today folks
[1:16:49] and the nature of the people
[1:16:52] and the demoralization of the world
[1:16:54] and among the women and how they would
[1:16:56] do in the last days and how the men
[1:16:58] would do and how the churches would do
[1:16:59] how the nations would do and how god
[1:17:02] would do
[1:17:03] and we see it all laying right here on
[1:17:05] us
[1:17:06] oh it anoints our faith it'll either
[1:17:08] anoint your faith or it'll scare you to
[1:17:10] death
[1:17:15] it moves us out in the great cycle see
[1:17:17] it separates us from other things of the
[1:17:20] world see no matter how little we are
[1:17:23] or how much a minority we are how much
[1:17:26] you're laughed at made fun of
[1:17:28] girls boys you'll be made fun of by the
[1:17:31] world because you're not conforming to
[1:17:33] the world you don't have a tattoo in
[1:17:36] every place of your body you don't have
[1:17:38] piercings where it shouldn't be
[1:17:40] or even in your ears but see the world's
[1:17:43] accepted and they've accepted it so it's
[1:17:44] going to it's acceptable practice now
[1:17:47] all right you you don't have to be you
[1:17:48] know you have to let the kid wait till
[1:17:50] they get up to five or six year old
[1:17:51] decide whether they want to be a boy or
[1:17:52] girl
[1:17:56] insanity insanity sodom and gomorrah
[1:17:59] what nothing will compare to what we got
[1:18:00] going on here
[1:18:04] but god put us here for a purpose
[1:18:07] watch this right here
[1:18:08] that's all we see it there is something
[1:18:10] within us we were predestinated to see
[1:18:14] this hour
[1:18:17] you're supposed to be here
[1:18:19] this is not a fluke
[1:18:21] you were supposed to be in this age
[1:18:24] i was praying last night sitting right
[1:18:25] there i said god thank you for putting
[1:18:26] me in this age
[1:18:29] the whole culmination of the bible
[1:18:32] is laying right here before us
[1:18:36] what isaiah spoke of is now happening
[1:18:38] what ezekiel spoke of is now happening
[1:18:43] right here is happening
[1:18:47] and there's nothing going to stop us
[1:18:49] from seeing it
[1:18:50] here god has spoken it it's already
[1:18:53] happened we see it oh how we thank god
[1:18:55] for this and then it brings out your
[1:18:58] faith when you see these things happen
[1:19:00] now look to the carnal mind when you see
[1:19:03] all this trouble happening what's the
[1:19:05] first thing you're going to do you're
[1:19:06] going to get scared to death
[1:19:11] but perfect love remember cast this out
[1:19:13] for fear
[1:19:14] we have not received the spirit of fear
[1:19:16] again into bondage
[1:19:19] listen
[1:19:20] humanly
[1:19:21] mortally
[1:19:23] we are scared
[1:19:25] because we don't know what tomorrow is
[1:19:27] we don't know about our children we
[1:19:28] don't know about this we got that and
[1:19:30] then um
[1:19:31] uh
[1:19:32] brother suresh all of you all know
[1:19:33] brother shiresh the dark brother that
[1:19:35] goes to brother uh he's an indian that

[1:19:57] you better put your faith listen he
[1:19:59] would go crazy i would go crazy if i
[1:20:01] didn't have jesus christ
[1:20:02] because i know he said he'd take care of
[1:20:04] his own people how many times has the
[1:20:06] door been shut on you and then another
[1:20:07] door had opened it was better
[1:20:09] a better door opened up
[1:20:11] but still there's that little fear
[1:20:13] there's that little bit of fear
[1:20:16] that we don't know what to do because we
[1:20:17] got bills and we got kids growing up we
[1:20:19] got weddings to do we
[1:20:21] we've got things that's coming up

[1:21:08] be transformed by the renewing of your
[1:21:10] mind that you may prove what is the good
[1:21:13] and the good that you may prove
[1:21:16] read that again that you may prove
[1:21:20] what do you put on this earth to do to

[1:21:46] the divine interpretation of what he
[1:21:48] said not man's interpretation be not
[1:21:50] conformed to this world but be
[1:21:52] transformed by the renewing
[1:21:54] of your mind
[1:21:56] listen
[1:21:57] every time you read a message book every
[1:21:59] time you read the bible you are renewing
[1:22:01] in your mind
[1:22:03] and listen that's the devil's workshop
[1:22:05] too right that's the devil's playground
[1:22:07] feel it so full of god till he hates to
[1:22:09] even be in your mind
[1:22:13] feel it so full of god
[1:22:16] feel it so full of even singing
[1:22:19] listen
[1:22:20] if
[1:22:20] if a man if a boy playing a harp
[1:22:26] if a little boy playing a heart
[1:22:29] called david
[1:22:31] saul had enough sense to know
[1:22:33] that when you know what he was doing he
[1:22:35] was walking through there one day i'm
[1:22:36] sure saul was you know he didn't like
[1:22:37] david very well anyway
[1:22:40] and he would listen and he he'd stop and
[1:22:42] he said man
[1:22:44] that just soothes my soul
[1:22:47] that music
[1:22:49] when i was listening to them sing up
[1:22:50] here psalms 34 it was a lot different
[1:22:52] than that psalms 34 i heard on them on
[1:22:54] the youtube
[1:22:55] oh they were singing it and they had
[1:22:57] trained voices and they were all when
[1:22:58] they were supposed to odd ooh when they
[1:23:00] were supposed to ooh but you know what
[1:23:02] no god there
[1:23:05] but when you got children
[1:23:07] that know god
[1:23:09] they're singing to the man that they're
[1:23:11] talking about
[1:23:13] they're saying to that psalms 34
[1:23:16] and that's what that's what um
[1:23:19] saul i'm sure he stopped one day and he
[1:23:20] said who is that
[1:23:23] who's that bring that guy in here and
[1:23:25] the bible said as david was playing
[1:23:28] songs
[1:23:30] the evil spirits went away from saul
[1:23:34] evil spirits hates good gospel music
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:38] evil spirits do not like gospel music
[1:23:41] but you filled your mind up though with
[1:23:44] the things of god
[1:23:46] and not the things of the world so let's
[1:23:49] continue right here be not conformed to
[1:23:51] this world but be transformed by the
[1:23:53] renewing of your mind that you may prove
[1:23:55] what is the good and acceptable and
[1:23:56] perfect will of god for i say through
[1:23:58] grace given unto me that every man that
[1:24:00] is among you not to think of himself
[1:24:01] more highly than any other thing don't
[1:24:03] get a big head
[1:24:04] but to think soberly according as god
[1:24:07] has dealt to every man the measure of
[1:24:09] faith now what does measure mean it's an
[1:24:11] instrument for measuring or a vessel for
[1:24:14] receiving and determining the quantity
[1:24:16] of things everybody with me whether dry
[1:24:18] or liquid a graduated staff for
[1:24:20] measuring we we know what that is right
[1:24:24] what is a measure
[1:24:26] all right if you want to measure liquid
[1:24:28] what do you measure it by
[1:24:30] inches
[1:24:32] you want
[1:24:34] what
[1:24:36] if you want to measure liquid it's not
[1:24:38] by inches and miles and
[1:24:41] oh so there's a measure that you've got
[1:24:42] to separate
[1:24:46] everybody with me
[1:24:49] well how far is that road oh it's 13
[1:24:51] gallons long
[1:24:55] you got the road
[1:24:57] you've got the person you've got the
[1:24:59] question being asked you just told them
[1:25:01] the wrong thing
[1:25:02] that's what happens when man gets
[1:25:04] involved with the word of god and puts
[1:25:06] his own interpretation in he says now
[1:25:08] it's 13 gallons long
[1:25:09] no it's 13 miles
[1:25:11] from here to my house
[1:25:14] now look
[1:25:15] measure of faith
[1:25:17] it's what holds volume which is what we
[1:25:20] know that it's gallons quartz
[1:25:24] hey sister june let's go downstairs and
[1:25:26] let's make a cake
[1:25:28] we're going to use four yards of of of
[1:25:32] four yards of uh flour and we're gonna
[1:25:35] use
[1:25:36] six inches of
[1:25:38] they don't work yet it's a measure
[1:25:42] but it's not what you're doing
[1:25:44] you've misplaced
[1:25:47] come on somebody you've misplaced the
[1:25:50] the word of god
[1:25:52] you've misplaced your measurement so
[1:25:55] your measurement of faith you got to
[1:25:56] know whether you want to do
[1:25:58] what is it aaron length breath height
[1:26:00] and depth
[1:26:01] is measured in what
[1:26:03] ounces
[1:26:05] yards feet and inches miles
[1:26:08] so there we've got it right now
[1:26:11] and if you want to measure gallons of
[1:26:12] milk
[1:26:13] measure it in gallons
[1:26:15] how about with me
[1:26:17] so there's a measure that we look at
[1:26:21] it must be the right measure
[1:26:24] luther and wesley they were looking at
[1:26:27] the right measure
[1:26:29] but some of their doctrines was in a
[1:26:31] different spot
[1:26:33] they were measuring it by the world
[1:26:36] that's what the world's problem is folks
[1:26:37] we measure it by the word of god totally
[1:26:40] whatever that measurement is the world
[1:26:42] says oh okay this measurement looks like
[1:26:44] a mile but we're going to call it a
[1:26:45] gallon
[1:26:47] because we don't have to cut i mean we
[1:26:49] don't we what's this cutting hair
[1:26:51] business and this going to church and
[1:26:52] what's this uh we ain't supposed to cuss
[1:26:54] we ain't supposed to drink oh a little
[1:26:55] bit of drinking water not a little bit
[1:26:56] of cussing ain't gonna hurt nothing
[1:26:57] that's the world
[1:26:59] you're being conformed to that because
[1:27:02] there's nothing to hold you you gonna go
[1:27:04] to that
[1:27:05] but if you get the right measure of
[1:27:07] faith
[1:27:09] right here
[1:27:11] luther had a measure of faith but right
[1:27:13] here it won't work
[1:27:16] pentecost had a measure of faith
[1:27:18] it won't work
[1:27:28] but listen
[1:27:29] they did have faith in the word they saw
[1:27:34] listen it wasn't they were wrong
[1:27:36] they were wrong in places but the birth
[1:27:38] of that day
[1:27:39] was
[1:27:41] the same as the birth today
[1:27:43] same new
[1:27:44] birth
[1:27:46] just shall live by faith is what luther
[1:27:48] brought under that
[1:27:51] but he couldn't measure everything
[1:27:54] so god had to come to wesley and give
[1:27:55] him a revelation
[1:27:57] that was a little bit further than the
[1:27:59] other revelation
[1:28:00] then pentecost had to be given oh well
[1:28:02] now you got to start wesley said all
[1:28:04] right look
[1:28:05] luther said luther said you know west
[1:28:07] has looked back at luther and said
[1:28:09] something about going to that pub
[1:28:12] and smoking a pie they did something
[1:28:14] wrong with that
[1:28:15] you know what that was god
[1:28:18] telling telling wesley
[1:28:20] to step up a little bit further
[1:28:23] have faith in that now our life is going
[1:28:26] to be our life natural life has got to
[1:28:29] change
[1:28:30] we got to stop that
[1:28:32] luther even said that t now he was a he
[1:28:34] was an englishman and they drank tea
[1:28:35] like we drank water
[1:28:37] he said tea doesn't have any value so
[1:28:39] don't drink it remember tea time
[1:28:45] but lutheran wesley they had what faith
[1:28:48] for the time
[1:28:50] so they had a measure of faith a
[1:28:52] proportion of faith
[1:28:53] but you and i let's continue on just a
[1:28:55] little bit everybody okay
[1:28:58] let's read the statue of perfect man now
[1:29:00] here's what we do what's the first thing
[1:29:02] have faith
[1:29:03] and be born again that's laying the
[1:29:05] foundation now like i said before
[1:29:08] that though
[1:29:09] is not faith for rapture it is part of
[1:29:12] it
[1:29:14] nobody with me on this the measure of
[1:29:16] faith is the measure of faith to be born
[1:29:19] again would be a portion remember you
[1:29:22] get
[1:29:24] a piece
[1:29:27] because what is a down payment it's a
[1:29:28] piece
[1:29:30] of the price that you purchased it with
[1:29:34] you said well with the new birth i got
[1:29:36] everything yeah you got everything you
[1:29:37] got you got doors open
[1:29:40] that were never open before
[1:29:42] but remember the prophet of god preached
[1:29:43] doors indoors he's going to step into
[1:29:45] your house
[1:29:46] and then there's more doors
[1:29:49] and some of us
[1:29:50] is a hallway full of doors
[1:29:54] that we gotta let god in
[1:29:57] you know what
[1:29:58] i gotta have faith
[1:30:00] that's why you have to have faith to go
[1:30:01] up at pyramid because when you come to
[1:30:03] virtue you got to have faith that you've
[1:30:05] got virtue
[1:30:07] you've got to have faith that you've got
[1:30:08] knowledge
[1:30:09] you've got to have faith that you've got
[1:30:10] temperance you never lose faith you
[1:30:12] never lose that foundation of faith
[1:30:15] when we leave this world it will because
[1:30:17] of rapturing
[1:30:19] faith
[1:30:23] but the whole
[1:30:25] hebrews 11
[1:30:27] all that hall of faith
[1:30:29] got down to the very last
[1:30:31] scripture and paul said oh
[1:30:34] they without us
[1:30:36] they're not going to be made perfect
[1:30:39] perfect oh man they they they destroyed
[1:30:42] they killed the lions and they destroyed
[1:30:43] this and they they took over kingdoms
[1:30:45] and they they did all this and abel did
[1:30:48] this and and abraham did this and moses
[1:30:50] destroyed a nation bigger than the
[1:30:51] united states all this a pile of known
[1:30:56] cannot be made perfect
[1:30:57] without our faith
[1:31:00] without our faith they had a portion of
[1:31:02] faith
[1:31:03] we have the faith of god not a faith
[1:31:09] so brother brown says have faith and be
[1:31:10] born again that's laying the foundation
[1:31:12] let's go to jude 1 verse 3. beloved when
[1:31:15] i gave all diligence to write unto you
[1:31:16] the common salvation that was needful
[1:31:18] for me to write unto you and exhort you
[1:31:21] that you should earnestly contend
[1:31:27] earnestly contend
[1:31:30] this is not earnestly contending
[1:31:38] well these days i hope god lights a fire
[1:31:40] under your hind end like you did that
[1:31:41] king it wouldn't stand up for irenas
[1:31:44] and some of y'all are going to start for
[1:31:46] the first time in your life you're going
[1:31:47] to shout
[1:31:49] i hope that happens
[1:31:51] i hope god lights your rear end up
[1:31:52] because your head's not getting anything
[1:31:53] i promise you
[1:31:56] that well
[1:31:58] i'm sorry it happens every service
[1:32:03] you can't keep your kids awake you're
[1:32:05] gonna have to be
[1:32:06] dealt with not the kids
[1:32:13] y'all can sit all day with that phone
[1:32:18] i've never seen one of you somebody's
[1:32:19] sitting in here now doing this and i've
[1:32:21] never seen anybody go
[1:32:28] no you know why because you're
[1:32:29] interested
[1:32:31] in what's going on
[1:32:34] what's the next guy gonna say what's the
[1:32:37] next girl gonna do
[1:32:41] that's why folks i'm telling you that's
[1:32:43] why the squeeze is going to have to
[1:32:44] happen
[1:32:46] we are so loud to sin we are so laid
[1:32:48] back lazy that god's going to pull all
[1:32:51] this out from us you look at brother
[1:32:52] suresh now bless his heart
[1:32:55] that man made real good money he was you
[1:32:57] know in the six figures with at that
[1:32:59] what computer place he's working at
[1:33:02] they just walked in one day and said
[1:33:03] we're doing away with your job
[1:33:07] you better have some faith
[1:33:09] if you don't have faith you'll go crazy
[1:33:11] that's what this world's going to do you
[1:33:13] don't you don't you watch
[1:33:16] several months from now
[1:33:18] this world something's going to collapse
[1:33:21] stock market is going to collapse
[1:33:22] something's going to happen in the world
[1:33:24] they've already said that the world is
[1:33:27] already they're treating more patients
[1:33:29] for
[1:33:30] for um depression and suicidal thoughts
[1:33:33] and suicide heart lines up 300 percent
[1:33:35] even this is even after cobia and during
[1:33:37] covert it was way worse than that why
[1:33:38] nobody knows how to handle anything if
[1:33:40] you're not born again you'll not know
[1:33:42] how to handle it
[1:33:43] you'll go crazy slap crazy
[1:33:49] did you earnestly contend for the faith
[1:33:51] how many of you just i mean your claw i
[1:33:53] mean just
[1:33:55] i gotta have it
[1:33:59] i gotta have the next service
[1:34:03] i gotta have the next service
[1:34:06] i prepare myself
[1:34:07] for the next service
[1:34:10] for the faith which was once delivered
[1:34:12] unto the saints so there was a faith
[1:34:15] for the aaron that was delivered to some
[1:34:17] people
[1:34:18] and then they lost him
[1:34:24] there was a certain faith
[1:34:27] if you earnestly contend for the faith
[1:34:29] that was once delivered to the saints
[1:34:31] that means you ain't got it right now
[1:34:34] we've got to get that back
[1:34:36] so there's faith that's lost
[1:34:38] not a lost faith a faith that is lost
[1:34:42] there are certain men crept in other
[1:34:44] ways this is why whoever before of old
[1:34:46] ordained to this condemnation ungodly
[1:34:49] man turning the grace of our god into
[1:34:50] lasciviousness and denying the only lord
[1:34:53] god in our lord
[1:34:54] jesus christ in other words what
[1:34:56] false doctrine
[1:34:58] false doctrine will get you far away
[1:35:00] from god quicker than anything else
[1:35:05] false doctrine
[1:35:07] then you've got a faith for the time
[1:35:09] that's needed let's read this right here
[1:35:12] now the other world the other words i'm
[1:35:14] venturing out he's talking about this in
[1:35:15] perfect faith 1963.
[1:35:17] well i'll go the bible said call the
[1:35:19] elders let them anoint with all pray
[1:35:21] over i know i'll go i'll go up
[1:35:23] you say well i'm going to be healed see
[1:35:25] you're making yourself
[1:35:27] you don't watch now you're going to make
[1:35:29] yourself just worked up
[1:35:31] then when he passes through he says oh i
[1:35:34] still don't see see there you are you
[1:35:36] didn't have faith
[1:35:38] your genuine faith will do it right
[1:35:41] there
[1:35:43] i got another quote i read wednesday
[1:35:45] night brother brown said hope is good
[1:35:46] hope is what starts it hope is a
[1:35:48] long-range vision but faith is now
[1:35:52] your genuine faith will make it so real
[1:35:55] to you that
[1:35:56] look at that little woman with a blood
[1:35:58] issue i was thinking about this the
[1:35:59] other day listen to this
[1:36:02] do you know that woman for 12 years
[1:36:05] couldn't be a wife
[1:36:07] for those you older that know what
[1:36:08] happened she was having a blood issue
[1:36:10] through her in her female problems she
[1:36:11] had female problems 12 years
[1:36:14] couldn't stop the bleeding do you know
[1:36:16] she ever where she sat was unclean
[1:36:19] she could not go into congregation
[1:36:21] because she was unclean
[1:36:23] she hadn't been in church for 12 years
[1:36:24] she was getting desperate
[1:36:26] she couldn't because that's what the law
[1:36:28] said
[1:36:29] the law said if you're on your time of
[1:36:31] the month you there's certain things you
[1:36:32] can't do
[1:36:33] everywhere you sit husband can't touch
[1:36:36] her
[1:36:37] because she's unfit or she's unclean
[1:36:40] so for 12 years she finally said i've
[1:36:42] had enough
[1:36:44] i want to go to church
[1:36:46] i want to be a wife
[1:36:48] i want to be a mother
[1:36:50] there's no recording of what she was but
[1:36:52] she was a woman with an issue
[1:36:57] so she decided if i can only touch the
[1:36:59] border of his garment he don't have to
[1:37:01] pray for me
[1:37:05] he don't even have to look at me
[1:37:08] all i got to do is if i can crawl
[1:37:10] through that crowd
[1:37:13] because i'm sure there was that old
[1:37:15] pharisees going
[1:37:17] i know her
[1:37:19] and you know what that was a perfect
[1:37:21] path to jesus
[1:37:24] the crowd separated because they didn't
[1:37:25] have enough to do with an unclean woman
[1:37:27] especially the more fair season
[1:37:30] but that just that part of the reds i
[1:37:32] never thought about that that's good
[1:37:35] i i i fear she'd be fighting through but
[1:37:37] no they knew who she was for 12 years
[1:37:39] she'd been that way so those old
[1:37:41] pharisees are going i'm not touching
[1:37:42] herself but it just parted the water and
[1:37:44] here she goes right to jesus
[1:37:46] touches his garment and you know what
[1:37:48] it proved it stopped jesus turned and
[1:37:51] said who touched me
[1:37:54] and then old peter bless his heart he
[1:37:55] wasn't he wasn't born again yet he
[1:37:57] hadn't had a statue of a perfect man
[1:37:59] um sermon preached yet remember in the
[1:38:02] other part he says lord everybody's
[1:38:05] touching you what do you mean who
[1:38:06] touched me he said no there's a
[1:38:08] connection somewhere
[1:38:10] something went out of me that was
[1:38:12] different than when you just touching me
[1:38:15] in other words there was a faith
[1:38:17] that went out of this woman and a faith
[1:38:19] that went out of jesus that had
[1:38:20] connected
[1:38:22] look
[1:38:23] and when she touched it to prove that it
[1:38:25] stopped it stopped jesus turned said who
[1:38:27] touched me
[1:38:28] that perfect faith and that same perfect
[1:38:30] faith tonight
[1:38:32] will touch jesus christ just as it is
[1:38:34] then the woman came with a perfect faith
[1:38:36] for that time
[1:38:38] there's a time and god has a timing
[1:38:42] a measure
[1:38:46] now here there's a divine healing faith
[1:38:48] you know what divine healing faith is
[1:38:50] come and get prayed for and you'll get
[1:38:52] better
[1:38:53] you just keep believing
[1:38:56] john ryan
[1:38:57] brother perry was talking about last
[1:38:58] weekend john ryan it was days
[1:39:02] oh john ryan you're not going you said
[1:39:03] you can see
[1:39:07] i can see
[1:39:09] what happened
[1:39:11] getting his hair cut you know what god
[1:39:12] had finally had enough
[1:39:15] god had enough for the hounds of hell
[1:39:17] than the devil saying oh john ryan can
[1:39:18] see john ryan can see god opened his
[1:39:21] eyes
[1:39:23] that was divine healing faith now
[1:39:26] miracle faith would be that his brother
[1:39:28] brown prayed for john ryan and
[1:39:29] immediately his eyes opened
[1:39:31] see that's what we like
[1:39:33] we like miracle faith
[1:39:35] and but you know what only certain
[1:39:37] people have miracle faith
[1:39:39] that's what i'm trying to get to you
[1:39:42] but don't belittle yourself because you
[1:39:44] don't have miracle faith
[1:39:46] have divine healing faith
[1:39:49] divine healing faith you're going to get
[1:39:51] better
[1:39:52] you're going to work your way through
[1:39:53] your situations if it's by the doctor's
[1:39:55] help or by medicine help or by you
[1:39:58] changing your diet or by whatever you
[1:40:00] need to do god's get listen god give you
[1:40:02] a brain you need to use it every once in
[1:40:04] a while
[1:40:05] a human brain
[1:40:07] i like what brother brady said he said
[1:40:09] god give you five senses you need to use
[1:40:11] them
[1:40:13] but miracle faith is divine i mean it's
[1:40:15] like this it's miracle divine healing
[1:40:18] pray for him
[1:40:19] you keep going you know what god is
[1:40:21] testing your faith
[1:40:25] miracle faith has nothing to do with
[1:40:26] your faith in long-term range
[1:40:32] but our long-range faith
[1:40:34] means that the next time something comes
[1:40:36] up
[1:40:37] we know that we're going to be healed
[1:40:39] but we may have to walk a few days we
[1:40:41] may walk a few months we may walk 12
[1:40:44] years
[1:40:46] but there's going to come a time when
[1:40:48] your faith is going to connect to
[1:40:50] something
[1:40:52] how many times have you been sitting
[1:40:53] here and you were sick
[1:40:55] i know sister gayle a couple of times
[1:40:59] sitting there in her back killing her
[1:41:00] couldn't even get up and she just i i
[1:41:02] think i was preaching one time maybe
[1:41:04] brother dale another time she told me
[1:41:05] after the service she said i couldn't
[1:41:06] move she said i just said i believe what
[1:41:08] that man says and boom it left
[1:41:11] you know what that's that resounding
[1:41:13] thing ain't nothing but the truth
[1:41:17] that went out into eternity and got two
[1:41:19] souls
[1:41:20] not two soul doctrine it got the souls
[1:41:22] of hattie wright's two sons
[1:41:27] that ain't nothing
[1:41:29] but the truth
[1:41:31] then we're gonna have to have another
[1:41:33] measure of faith resurrection faith
[1:41:36] it's never been before
[1:41:38] jesus was the only one that had it
[1:41:40] i'm talking about permanent resurrection
[1:41:42] i ain't talking about just praying for
[1:41:43] the sick and they resurrect
[1:41:44] i'm this is the resurrection of the dead
[1:41:46] in christ
[1:41:48] that's coming folks that's what we got
[1:41:50] to have
[1:41:51] we got to have faith that death will be
[1:41:53] destroyed in what we believe in this
[1:41:55] message of the hour
[1:41:57] it will not be destroyed by a
[1:41:59] denominational idea so you can count
[1:42:00] them out i'm sorry they could be good
[1:42:02] foolish virgins they could be given
[1:42:04] eternal life that's fine
[1:42:05] but there's a requirement that me and
[1:42:07] you come to a place
[1:42:09] that when we we look now
[1:42:12] how many of you look at those graves and
[1:42:13] say
[1:42:14] you go by a graveyard
[1:42:16] it makes me feel bad
[1:42:19] you don't even think about that some of
[1:42:20] you do blame them think about grave i
[1:42:23] look at the graves i said man there's
[1:42:24] people in there
[1:42:25] we just cut grass me and jacob did
[1:42:27] at a place and i thought they were
[1:42:28] really old graves and i thought you know
[1:42:30] what lord if they were born again under
[1:42:31] that era not not the prophet of the hour
[1:42:34] or the message of the hour but born
[1:42:35] again under their time
[1:42:37] i said they're laying there
[1:42:39] but their souls in the sixth dimension
[1:42:44] and one day
[1:42:46] one day it doesn't matter if you can
[1:42:48] pile listen satan can pile six feet of
[1:42:50] dirt or six thousand feet of dirt on top
[1:42:52] of you i don't care you're coming out
[1:42:55] they died though but they died with
[1:42:58] faith
[1:42:59] believing there was somebody
[1:43:01] is going to be alive and remain until
[1:43:03] the coming of the lord
[1:43:05] if they're good christians they read
[1:43:07] their bible and they read in
[1:43:08] thessalonians that we which are alive
[1:43:10] and remain shall not prevent or hinder
[1:43:12] those which are asleep for what the
[1:43:13] trumpet of god's sound
[1:43:15] didn't cross your eyes first
[1:43:17] resurrection faith
[1:43:19] and now rapturing faith
[1:43:22] brother brown said enoch please god
[1:43:25] with rapturing faith please god
[1:43:28] with rapturing faith that's what when
[1:43:29] you got to do we got to please god
[1:43:32] listen to this real quick
[1:43:35] god's commission moses 1953. i have a
[1:43:38] great faith to believe that one day
[1:43:40] before the coming of the lord that our
[1:43:41] little differences will be settled
[1:43:45] sometimes that might be a little
[1:43:47] unbelievable
[1:43:49] but it's not we will god may have to let
[1:43:52] communism sweep us together but
[1:43:54] something will take place that'll make
[1:43:56] us all
[1:43:57] one heart and one accord
[1:44:00] now if you take those and put them all
[1:44:01] together that talks about the squeeze
[1:44:05] everybody with me that's the brother i'm
[1:44:07] talking about the squeeze he's calling
[1:44:08] it communism but then what communism and
[1:44:10] what that is
[1:44:12] not by name not that russia is going to
[1:44:14] come over here and take us over i mean
[1:44:15] they will later on but not when we're
[1:44:17] here
[1:44:18] if we can't have faith now for healing
[1:44:20] how are we going to have rapturing faith
[1:44:23] we've got to have faith for the little
[1:44:24] things first
[1:44:27] divine healing
[1:44:29] miracle healing faith to be born again
[1:44:31] first
[1:44:34] then a measure of faith is going to be
[1:44:35] put on top of that it's going to give
[1:44:37] you a place to where you can pray and
[1:44:39] things will happen
[1:44:41] to where you can speak the word and
[1:44:42] things will happen
[1:44:43] that's a measure of faith that we're
[1:44:45] coming to
[1:44:48] and listen don't measure somebody else
[1:44:56] and he writes food millions of people
[1:44:59] had he right food millions of preachers
[1:45:04] oh you got to have a shirt on you got to
[1:45:05] have a town you got to be in the pulpit
[1:45:06] you got a heavy bible open you got to
[1:45:08] say the word of god you got to say the
[1:45:09] name of god she was doing her dishes and
[1:45:11] she probably her hair was all messed up
[1:45:13] she owned an apron she said brother i'm
[1:45:15] laying nothing but the truth
[1:45:18] god pulled back the curtains
[1:45:23] and he didn't say what did you say
[1:45:27] he heard her
[1:45:30] that ain't nothing
[1:45:32] but the truth
[1:45:34] simple faith for what have faith and be
[1:45:37] born again
[1:45:38] then you add to that faith different
[1:45:40] things now watch this
[1:45:42] that's where i want to get to and then
[1:45:43] we'll close
[1:45:44] jesus had perfect faith remember
[1:45:48] he was perfect faith
[1:45:50] jesus had perfect faith he had it and it
[1:45:52] came it come because he was the word
[1:45:56] what i just read you the first scripture
[1:45:58] we read and in the beginning was word
[1:45:59] words with god the word was god
[1:46:01] and the word was made flesh
[1:46:04] and me and you
[1:46:05] and you become the word you become the
[1:46:07] word as you receive the word so he's
[1:46:09] putting us and jesus right there
[1:46:10] together
[1:46:11] with that perfect faith he's oh if you
[1:46:13] if we've got perfect faith then we got
[1:46:16] you start putting adding your junk to it
[1:46:20] whatever you want to add i can't do this
[1:46:22] i didn't do that i can't do this this
[1:46:23] ain't happening to me that ain't
[1:46:24] happening to me jesus walked in the
[1:46:26] world of perfect faith but did that stop
[1:46:28] the problems from coming did that stop
[1:46:30] the heartaches from coming then it
[1:46:32] starts the isolation stop the isolation
[1:46:35] no they hated him they called him
[1:46:37] everything about god
[1:46:38] the devil's one of the only ones smart
[1:46:40] enough to call him god
[1:46:43] but you become the word as you receive
[1:46:45] the word
[1:46:47] if you abide in me and my words in you
[1:46:48] my word switch this word abides in you
[1:46:50] that that's what you will need to be
[1:46:52] done
[1:46:52] if you say to this mountain be moved and
[1:46:54] don't doubt but believe in what you've
[1:46:56] said then you shall have what you said
[1:46:59] when you pray believe that you receive
[1:47:01] what you asked for and you shall have it
[1:47:04] time space
[1:47:06] nothing else will ever change it you
[1:47:08] know it's done it's already over with
[1:47:12] perfect faith 1963 but jesus lived in a
[1:47:15] world that no one knowed about he was an
[1:47:18] odd person
[1:47:20] he lived in a world of perfect faith in
[1:47:23] the perfect god in which he was
[1:47:26] if we lived in a perfect faith of a
[1:47:28] christian to what we are we'd be a
[1:47:31] mystic to the world
[1:47:33] the people wouldn't understand you
[1:47:42] you'd walk in the spirit
[1:47:44] a lot of us walk in the spirit all right
[1:47:46] but it's not the holy spirit
[1:47:49] what the spirit said you would do
[1:47:51] what it forbid you would not do
[1:47:53] then the people began to say you know
[1:47:55] your mystic person to them that's the
[1:47:57] way it is with all believers they're a
[1:47:59] mystic
[1:48:00] the people don't understand because they
[1:48:02] live in a world to themselves
[1:48:04] jesus lived in a world that no one else
[1:48:07] could touch
[1:48:09] the disciples couldn't understand him
[1:48:11] when he spoke to them they say uh you're
[1:48:13] talking riddles
[1:48:15] we don't understand this how can this be
[1:48:18] see they wasn't in the world that he
[1:48:20] lived in
[1:48:21] see they couldn't know why they weren't
[1:48:23] born again now he couldn't say that
[1:48:26] after pentecost
[1:48:28] after the 120 in the upper room got the
[1:48:31] new birth
[1:48:32] jesus couldn't say that again they did
[1:48:35] understand what he was talking about
[1:48:39] hey they didn't have 1100 sermons to
[1:48:41] prove who he was
[1:48:42] they didn't even have stuff written down
[1:48:45] they just listened to what jesus said
[1:48:46] and they kept that in their heart and in
[1:48:48] their in their mind and god brought it
[1:48:50] back to their remembrance
[1:48:53] so now when a man lives by faith and
[1:48:54] walks by faith look i mean substance
[1:48:58] faith
[1:49:01] he is isolated from the entire world
[1:49:06] and becomes a new creature in christ
[1:49:09] there now you're getting into bride
[1:49:12] material
[1:49:14] you know what we're here for
[1:49:16] i'm here to get into bride material
[1:49:20] you're getting into rapturing condition
[1:49:22] now that means for each one of us not
[1:49:25] just a pastor deacon trustee thank you
[1:49:27] brother branham that means for the laity
[1:49:29] every individual walks in a world with
[1:49:31] god alone you're baptized into this
[1:49:33] kingdom there's nobody in there but you
[1:49:35] and god see he gives the orders
[1:49:42] and you do about half of them
[1:49:47] you he gives the orders and you pack
[1:49:49] them out
[1:49:50] whatever he says there's not a shadow of
[1:49:52] doubt nowhere you walk right on if the
[1:49:55] lord says this there's nobody in the
[1:49:56] world can talk you out of it you go
[1:49:58] right on just the same now you're coming
[1:50:00] into perfect faith perfect perfect
[1:50:02] perfection that cannot fail
[1:50:05] that faith never fails yes he was a
[1:50:08] mystic to them with his perfect faith
[1:50:09] and so it is now with those who have
[1:50:11] perfect faith are a mystic
[1:50:14] to others perfect faith 1963 notice now
[1:50:17] another perfect faith look is a master
[1:50:20] of all circumstances that's where he got
[1:50:22] the what's where he got the quote that
[1:50:23] jesus walked in the world of perfect
[1:50:25] faith
[1:50:26] show me one place in the four gospels
[1:50:28] that jesus was ever frustrated
[1:50:33] didn't know what to me
[1:50:35] didn't know what his next move was
[1:50:38] didn't know what to say
[1:50:40] and said oops i didn't mean that i i
[1:50:42] didn't mean to say that
[1:50:43] no he knew who he was
[1:50:46] and he walked in such a world of perfect
[1:50:48] faith he mastered every circumstance
[1:50:50] listen when they came into pharisees
[1:50:52] they were smart
[1:50:54] they were smart in the word too
[1:50:56] they were smart in that old testament
[1:50:58] they could tell you everything about the
[1:51:00] old testament
[1:51:01] but they come up jesus said
[1:51:03] if this woman
[1:51:05] her husband dies and she marries the
[1:51:07] seven other sons and they die and they
[1:51:10] all die and they come up in their
[1:51:12] resurrections whose wife is
[1:51:15] jesus said wasn't so from the beginning
[1:51:17] took him all the way back to adam they
[1:51:19] knew what the fall was they knew it
[1:51:20] wasn't apples and oranges and peaches
[1:51:22] and all the other junk
[1:51:23] they knew what it was
[1:51:25] so he mastered and remember there was
[1:51:27] one time they asked him a question he
[1:51:29] said all right answer me this he said
[1:51:30] john's baptism
[1:51:32] was it a man or was it of god
[1:51:35] boy he put he was checkmate on that one
[1:51:38] there was no other move they could make
[1:51:41] so what did the bible say they didn't
[1:51:42] say nothing they were pretty smart by
[1:51:44] not saying anything because they got
[1:51:46] together and said okay if we say it was
[1:51:47] of john then he's got disciples here we
[1:51:49] might get stoned and said well if it was
[1:51:51] heaven why don't you believe john
[1:51:53] amen
[1:51:54] jesus said well neither i'm going i'm
[1:51:56] not going to answer your question either
[1:51:57] because that was a dumb question that
[1:51:59] you asked but you know what he done he
[1:52:01] mastered all circumstances that's what
[1:52:04] you and i are going to come to i believe
[1:52:05] we're going to come to where we master
[1:52:07] all circumstances listen we make
[1:52:08] mistakes every day humanly we make
[1:52:11] mistakes but when it comes to the word
[1:52:12] of god we shouldn't be making as many
[1:52:14] mistakes as we used to make
[1:52:16] everybody with me on that we shouldn't
[1:52:18] make as many mistakes as we used to make
[1:52:20] we should be led by the spirit of god
[1:52:22] not by that other spirit
[1:52:25] look it masters it now just watch when
[1:52:27] you believe anything do anything you got
[1:52:30] faith in what you're doing no matter
[1:52:31] what the circumstance is that don't have
[1:52:34] one thing to do with it see it masters
[1:52:36] that circumstance
[1:52:38] if it's in a room of sickness and the
[1:52:40] lord revealed that this certain thing is
[1:52:41] going to happen you just speak it and go
[1:52:43] on
[1:52:47] spindle north carolina right off the
[1:52:48] road where brother joe green is
[1:52:50] this is where brother henry green got
[1:52:52] started following the message when
[1:52:54] brother brown came to town there in
[1:52:55] spindale
[1:52:56] 1956. see your faith is not what you
[1:52:59] feel
[1:53:01] your faith is what you believe
[1:53:03] if you really believe it i don't care
[1:53:05] how you feel
[1:53:06] you never never say you wasn't healed
[1:53:08] you'd always believe it
[1:53:11] that's what does it see that's what
[1:53:13] happens here at the platform when i have
[1:53:15] healing services hundreds of people that
[1:53:17] way hundreds he said listen to me
[1:53:19] hundreds of people
[1:53:21] do this right here they come to the
[1:53:23] platform and say oh brother branham i
[1:53:24] got all faith
[1:53:26] if it was ink it wouldn't dot and i
[1:53:31] oh brother branham don't talk like that
[1:53:33] well he's telling the truth
[1:53:35] he's trying to get him to build their
[1:53:36] face not on emotion or not on worked up
[1:53:39] something pinned up but look watch this
[1:53:40] right here
[1:53:42] see you've got hope instead of faith
[1:53:45] faith is positive there's no nothing can
[1:53:47] move it it's positive no matter how sick
[1:53:49] you get
[1:53:51] how everything went nothing now if
[1:53:53] you're trying to bluff it
[1:53:54] it won't take bluffing the devil he's a
[1:53:57] bluff itself
[1:53:59] so you can't bluff a bluffer
[1:54:03] and he knows how to run a bluff
[1:54:06] but when you get the goods
[1:54:09] oh brother tom fall bush that's what he
[1:54:11] always said he said
[1:54:13] brother sam's got the goods
[1:54:16] because dale's got the goods
[1:54:18] well brother tom had the goods too
[1:54:21] if you're born again you got the goods
[1:54:23] it don't take loud hollering oh here we
[1:54:26] go
[1:54:27] here's our feelings going to get hurt it
[1:54:29] don't take loud hollering it don't take
[1:54:31] stomping and screaming it takes faith
[1:54:34] he will recognize it don't worry just
[1:54:37] say the word
[1:54:38] first seal 1963 listen and when there's
[1:54:41] coming forth seven mysterious thunders
[1:54:42] it's not even written at all that's
[1:54:44] right and i believe that those through
[1:54:45] those seven thunders will be revealed in
[1:54:48] the last days in order to get the bride
[1:54:50] together for rapturing faith
[1:54:52] everybody with me
[1:54:54] what is the seven thunders it's the
[1:54:55] revelation contained in the seals we've
[1:54:57] had that we know that we know it's not
[1:54:59] seven men we know it's not some
[1:55:01] mysterious tutu to do or a thunder going
[1:55:03] off
[1:55:04] it's a word of god to me in you
[1:55:06] it's something for you
[1:55:10] because what we got right now we
[1:55:12] wouldn't be able to do it
[1:55:14] there's something we've got to step
[1:55:16] farther
[1:55:18] this is the prophet of god
[1:55:20] we can't have enough faith for divine
[1:55:22] healing hardly we've got to have enough
[1:55:24] faith to be changed in a moment and be
[1:55:26] swept out of this earth and we'll find
[1:55:27] out after a while the lord willing find
[1:55:29] where it's written he's fixing to open
[1:55:30] the seals
[1:55:32] and show us what was in the book statue
[1:55:34] of perfect man will be done in just a
[1:55:35] second
[1:55:36] notice you must be born again and when
[1:55:38] you're born again you can't be born
[1:55:40] again without having faith
[1:55:43] that's right so you see on my chart here
[1:55:45] i got the very foundation faith and it's
[1:55:47] right here behind me
[1:55:48] faith is the foundation of all of it for
[1:55:50] without faith it is impossible to please
[1:55:53] god he that cometh to god must believe
[1:55:55] that he is what is god
[1:55:57] and a rewarder of those that diligently
[1:55:59] seek him see he must be and wherein
[1:56:02] you're a skeptic of the bible
[1:56:06] that's what happened we have a lot of
[1:56:07] skeptics
[1:56:09] and we're skeptics sometimes when we
[1:56:11] don't believe the bible
[1:56:14] when you're skeptic of the word being
[1:56:16] right you might just as well stay back
[1:56:18] until first you believe it
[1:56:21] what is sin unbelief
[1:56:23] there's only two elements that control
[1:56:24] the human being that's either doubt or
[1:56:27] faith
[1:56:28] one or the other you're possessed oh
[1:56:30] brother branham
[1:56:32] you're gonna be possessed the two ghosts
[1:56:35] the holy ghost and the wrong ghost
[1:56:37] you're possessed of one that dominates
[1:56:39] your life
[1:56:41] just depends on how much faith you have
[1:56:43] is how high you can rise
[1:56:46] but first it's got to be faith let me
[1:56:48] stay on that foundation for a while now
[1:56:50] faith is what you must believe faith is
[1:56:52] what the substance of things hoped for
[1:56:54] it's you already have it when you have
[1:56:57] faith because it's revealed in faith
[1:56:59] faith is the substance of things hoped
[1:57:00] for hebrews 11 the evidence what is it
[1:57:02] what kind of an evidence all the
[1:57:04] evidence
[1:57:07] all the evidence
[1:57:08] got it all right listen to this
[1:57:10] owensboro kentucky
[1:57:13] faith knows no defeat
[1:57:16] faith is perfect
[1:57:17] faith brings things when there is no
[1:57:19] things to be brought
[1:57:21] faith
[1:57:22] creates faith takes doubt away
[1:57:26] takes negative and makes positive
[1:57:29] how beautiful
[1:57:30] the whole man had a basis for faith
[1:57:32] faith is not mythical
[1:57:35] something mentally worked up is an
[1:57:37] absolute fundamental result that happens
[1:57:39] in a person's heart what a measure your
[1:57:42] measure of faith when faith is
[1:57:44] appropriated
[1:57:47] given out
[1:57:50] then it's something in the person's
[1:57:51] heart
[1:57:52] but it can't be based on well go touch a
[1:57:54] tree and you'll get well
[1:57:56] pray to the post
[1:57:57] it's got to have a foundation now here
[1:57:59] it is i want you to get it how much more
[1:58:01] foundation could you place your faith on
[1:58:04] any level than the word of god
[1:58:07] what more could you put faith in when he
[1:58:09] said heaven and earth will pass away but
[1:58:11] my word shall never
[1:58:12] pass away see that's what we lose faith
[1:58:14] we lose faith in the word of god
[1:58:20] and and as i continue on and i i keep
[1:58:23] there's only two more left and it will
[1:58:24] be done
[1:58:26] i you think that we harp you know
[1:58:28] brother dale myself and all the
[1:58:29] ministers we harp on things
[1:58:31] but we're just reading the bible
[1:58:37] and i know and i'm not throwing it out
[1:58:39] there when i told you i said if you
[1:58:40] don't come to church or don't want to
[1:58:41] come to church you're not born again the
[1:58:43] bible says that
[1:58:48] i can read it to you
[1:58:50] these things we can read
[1:58:53] we can read in the bible it's not it's
[1:58:55] not a doctrine outside of the bible
[1:58:59] when we're told to do things in the
[1:59:01] bible and we reject it that makes us
[1:59:02] word rejecters
[1:59:04] and word rejecters
[1:59:08] go to hell
[1:59:09] what the prophet said
[1:59:13] listen
[1:59:14] try to live every word you can
[1:59:17] make an effort diligently contend for
[1:59:21] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:59:22] saints listen
[1:59:23] the faith that was once delivered to the
[1:59:25] saints is that faith of the fathers that
[1:59:27] puts this you in this pyramid
[1:59:30] then there's a rapturing faith that
[1:59:32] we've got to come to so it's got to be
[1:59:33] another measure of faith put on top of
[1:59:36] that faith
[1:59:37] everybody with me
[1:59:39] faith does the rest of it look that's a
[1:59:41] perfect man faith does the rest so you
[1:59:44] must have faith for a foundation
[1:59:46] all christianity look all that you are
[1:59:50] when you go home today and go to your
[1:59:51] house
[1:59:53] if you're a christian it's based
[1:59:55] on faith
[1:59:57] it's based on faith that i told you the
[1:59:59] truth today and you're going to build on
[2:00:00] that
[2:00:01] or that another brother or that you
[2:00:02] listen to a tape or that you talk to
[2:00:04] somebody and it builds your faith
[2:00:06] all you are all you ever will be is
[2:00:09] based upon faith in the word
[2:00:11] that's the reason i believe the word
[2:00:16] all right look
[2:00:17] at your perfect man 1963 again 62 first
[2:00:20] you must be born again
[2:00:22] then when you're born again you have
[2:00:24] faith
[2:00:25] you believe the word until you're born
[2:00:27] again you'll argue against it
[2:00:30] what
[2:00:31] excuses excuses
[2:00:34] i don't know the rest of the song but
[2:00:36] them two words is enough for me to stop
[2:00:42] that's why i look
[2:00:45] when you're asked questions
[2:00:48] yes or no answers is the best answers to
[2:00:51] give
[2:00:52] if you're not doing something right just
[2:00:54] say nope not do anything right don't try
[2:00:56] to justify or say but
[2:00:58] but you don't understand oh come on
[2:01:00] people good grief
[2:01:03] you're arguing against the word of god
[2:01:06] you're not arguing against me that's why
[2:01:09] that when i have to deal with something
[2:01:11] it don't bother me one bit
[2:01:13] i'm just telling you what god said
[2:01:15] i'm not giving you my opinion because i
[2:01:17] like white you all need to wear white
[2:01:20] it is in the bible you need to wear
[2:01:22] white robes
[2:01:25] but that's not right
[2:01:28] it's not that i like to hunt and you
[2:01:29] don't so therefore you have no faith
[2:01:32] but if i tell you by the word of god
[2:01:33] that you don't believe the word of god
[2:01:34] because you don't come to church you
[2:01:35] still cut your hair you still put on
[2:01:36] makeup you still curse you still do
[2:01:38] that's what god said the word said that
[2:01:42] you're not filthy because i said you're
[2:01:43] filthy you felt because the bible says
[2:01:45] you're filthy
[2:01:46] but if you'll have faith and be born
[2:01:48] again it'll take that part out
[2:01:52] all right then
[2:01:55] if you're just religiously inclined
[2:01:57] that's our problem in this message we
[2:01:59] have a bunch of religious idiots
[2:02:06] i'm born again because
[2:02:09] i read the message or
[2:02:12] and this what gets me is
[2:02:15] i'm going to say it anyway
[2:02:17] if i were to call brother donnie reagan
[2:02:18] and he'll i'll tell him if he didn't see
[2:02:20] it
[2:02:21] if i called brother donald reagan i said
[2:02:22] brother i need you to come preach the
[2:02:23] service for her
[2:02:24] this place will be packed
[2:02:26] y'all wouldn't miss a service two p
[2:02:28] you'd come to both services and you'd
[2:02:29] want three
[2:02:34] brother biscuit oh we'd have to get a
[2:02:35] big haul for him
[2:02:41] what about samuel dale
[2:02:45] what about aaron roberts
[2:02:48] i mean i can't stand it in this message
[2:02:50] i'm sorry i'm get wait a minute get up
[2:02:51] on the box aaron you give me you left
[2:02:53] that same box right here i'm up on it
[2:02:55] now
[2:02:56] they have the same people in the same
[2:02:58] cycle preaching the same thing all the
[2:02:59] time
[2:03:01] erin
[2:03:04] you some of these brothers has got some
[2:03:06] sense
[2:03:07] [Applause]
[2:03:11] and i don't say they don't have sense
[2:03:12] what i'm saying is is you got your
[2:03:14] favorites and everybody does we all have
[2:03:16] our favorites we do i mean come on
[2:03:18] but you can't make it to where i'm well
[2:03:20] i'm not going to come to church
[2:03:21] until it's communion sunday and then
[2:03:23] i'll come and then i hope that i hope
[2:03:25] brother
[2:03:26] aaron's preaching because i don't want
[2:03:28] to hear that other brother
[2:03:30] or i won't i won't recover when brother
[2:03:32] bob is preaching on wednesday night i
[2:03:33] will fill the house up but when brother
[2:03:35] louise preaches them
[2:03:38] i think i'll just stay home and
[2:03:40] oh i still read the bible
[2:03:43] religiously inclined
[2:03:45] if you're just religiously
[2:03:47] i'm sorry i didn't mean to get on that
[2:03:49] but i did and you got a little human
[2:03:51] knowledge
[2:03:54] that you could should do right
[2:03:57] you'll never be able to agree i just
[2:03:59] want to agree on the word of god i don't
[2:04:00] care whether you agree on me or not i
[2:04:02] want to be agreeable to the word of god
[2:04:04] and i want to be agreeable to me
[2:04:06] amen you'll never do it you've got to be
[2:04:09] born again and born again it produces
[2:04:12] faith
[2:04:14] all right then after you get faith
[2:04:15] that's right here f-a-i-t-h he's
[2:04:17] pointing right down there
[2:04:19] then you're just in position of growing
[2:04:23] just in position of growing
[2:04:26] now a lot of people go up to the altar
[2:04:28] and pray and say lord forgive me and a
[2:04:31] great experience of sanctification
[2:04:33] that's what our problem is we stay there
[2:04:35] we think that's the new birth
[2:04:39] i'm just reading what the prophet said
[2:04:41] if you deny it you're denying him so
[2:04:42] you'll be a word rejecter and i don't
[2:04:44] told you where these people go and a
[2:04:45] great experience of sanctification come
[2:04:47] upon them and things
[2:04:49] and then you have a great time get up to
[2:04:52] the altar shouting you go back say bless
[2:04:54] god i got it
[2:04:55] no you just started to a place where you
[2:04:58] can grow
[2:05:00] you ain't done nothing yet kentucky
[2:05:02] english i love it i can understand what
[2:05:05] he's saying you ain't done nothing yet
[2:05:07] see the only thing you've done is just
[2:05:09] lay the foundation
[2:05:10] now you're going to build a house and
[2:05:12] you pour the foundation and say boy i
[2:05:13] got her see you got the foundation to
[2:05:15] build your house on
[2:05:17] now you got to build a house
[2:05:19] now there's where the thing comes in
[2:05:21] this morning we're going to talk about
[2:05:22] now all right a house this foundation is
[2:05:25] first what is the foundation of
[2:05:26] christianity faith in the word of god
[2:05:30] listen we got to have faith in the word
[2:05:32] of
[2:05:32] god everything else is shifting sands
[2:05:35] even man's ideas
[2:05:37] then you start you begin to add to
[2:05:41] this foundation so we've come to this is
[2:05:43] the last quote
[2:05:46] virtue must be in us until we get virtue
[2:05:48] then when we get true virtue we can add
[2:05:50] it to our faith
[2:05:52] that's the next foundation wall so look
[2:05:54] you can't have virtue and not have faith
[2:05:57] because you add that to your faith if
[2:06:00] you're not born again forget adding
[2:06:02] virtue to anything
[2:06:03] you just have human virtue
[2:06:07] but when you have faith
[2:06:09] you take faith jesus walked in the world
[2:06:12] of perfect faith what did that sister do
[2:06:14] she had faith in what he was
[2:06:18] she might have not even understood he
[2:06:19] was god
[2:06:23] she just knew
[2:06:24] by listening to reports
[2:06:27] that wherever that man was people got up
[2:06:30] and walked
[2:06:31] people got up and could see
[2:06:33] people got up out of their deathbed
[2:06:38] that's all she knew
[2:06:40] that was faith for the time
[2:06:42] get me to that man don't i don't even
[2:06:44] want him to look at me i'm not worthy
[2:06:46] i've been for 12 years i've been unclean
[2:06:49] but just let me touch his garment
[2:06:52] let me just touch his garment
[2:06:54] and i don't think she pulled on it
[2:06:56] either
[2:06:57] she said touch and when she touched it
[2:06:59] you know jesus was walking down through
[2:07:00] the crowd you know how if he got on a
[2:07:02] gown that thing's just going everywhere
[2:07:05] so there's no reason for him to say now
[2:07:07] if she would have grabbed it and jerked
[2:07:08] him backwards
[2:07:09] he'd have said who touched me but he
[2:07:10] just kept going on and finally he
[2:07:12] stopped and turned around he said who
[2:07:13] touched me
[2:07:14] that's when peter was like
[2:07:16] lord there's hundreds of people here
[2:07:18] no she pulled on his face
[2:07:21] she pulled on his face
[2:07:23] the garment was there
[2:07:26] that's why
[2:07:28] i believe that's where you take that
[2:07:31] scripture
[2:07:32] put it with paul's scripture that they
[2:07:34] took
[2:07:35] cloths off of paul that's where we get
[2:07:36] prayer cloths
[2:07:39] prayer cloth
[2:07:42] because it came from the hymn of the
[2:07:43] garment of jesus
[2:07:44] a woman touched his garment
[2:07:47] and then somebody got the revelation
[2:07:48] that hey
[2:07:49] paul is a born-again believer and we see
[2:07:52] he has faith let's take some of his
[2:07:54] garments
[2:07:55] and cut them up
[2:07:57] and evil spirits will leave
[2:07:59] same thing what we do now we do the same
[2:08:00] thing
[2:08:03] it's all biblical
[2:08:05] but it started with jesus didn't start
[2:08:07] with paul started with jesus when that
[2:08:09] woman touched him of his garment what
[2:08:11] did he do it pulled and if you some of
[2:08:13] the brothers i know when you're praying
[2:08:14] for people and i'll just be honest with
[2:08:16] you i'm going to be honest anyway when
[2:08:18] you pray for people sometimes you pray
[2:08:20] for them and it's like you don't get
[2:08:22] anything
[2:08:23] it's like you don't even feel anything
[2:08:24] that's why i don't like to lay my hands
[2:08:26] on
[2:08:27] because i've seen people
[2:08:29] god bless their heart i know they're
[2:08:30] trying to do it they'll you know they
[2:08:31] grab your head and they
[2:08:34] you know i've seen them in jamaica they
[2:08:36] take the sisters and they and i don't
[2:08:38] believe in that you you shouldn't touch
[2:08:39] a sister in that place
[2:08:41] but they're trying to pray for them you
[2:08:42] know they're grabbing them praying
[2:08:44] what i do i say give me your hands
[2:08:48] that's safe
[2:08:49] give me your hands
[2:08:50] we're going to agree we're going to take
[2:08:52] hands we're going to hold our hands and
[2:08:53] we're going to agree
[2:08:54] that what's going to happen is going to
[2:08:55] happen that's just as much you don't
[2:08:57] need to be doing the slapping and
[2:08:58] grabbing and pulling and all that stuff
[2:09:01] listen some people need them
[2:09:05] small faith
[2:09:08] you shouldn't need that
[2:09:11] but virtue must be in us
[2:09:14] then when we get true virtue we can add
[2:09:16] it to our faith
[2:09:17] that's the next foundation wall now
[2:09:19] first you must have faith now here's the
[2:09:21] quote that i've been reading and don't
[2:09:22] let this throw you because we've been
[2:09:24] talking for an hour and a half on faith
[2:09:26] faith alone though won't do it that what
[2:09:29] faith to be born again
[2:09:31] won't do it all right
[2:09:33] you got to have faith and be born again
[2:09:36] then you got to have faith to have
[2:09:37] virtue then you got to have faith to
[2:09:39] have knowledge faith to have temperance
[2:09:42] and then you got to have faith that that
[2:09:43] holy ghost which is the same holy ghost
[2:09:45] down here but it's going to seal you in
[2:09:48] then you will be a manifested son of god
[2:09:50] where you'll speak the word
[2:09:54] listen
[2:09:56] the saints didn't overcome
[2:10:00] what they overcome by read your bible
[2:10:02] we'll read it we'll read it wednesday
[2:10:03] night i didn't didn't get to that
[2:10:07] they were they overcame the saints
[2:10:08] overcame by the blood of the lamb and
[2:10:12] their testimony
[2:10:16] you know what a testimony is
[2:10:19] like i tell somebody before hearsay is
[2:10:21] not admissible evidence
[2:10:24] but a testimony means you've been there
[2:10:27] when you testify that you saw that guy
[2:10:30] run over that kid
[2:10:32] you were there you're testifying a truth
[2:10:35] that is admissible in court
[2:10:38] and in the court of god
[2:10:40] your testimony if it's true is
[2:10:42] admissible nothing else in them is
[2:10:44] admissible because what is hearsay
[2:10:47] so faith alone won't do it you got then
[2:10:49] add virtue to your faith you must have
[2:10:52] virtue in order to add
[2:10:54] to your faith
[2:10:56] now one more thing before we close
[2:10:57] magicians come on you stand
[2:11:00] so your testimony it can be admitted as
[2:11:02] evidence
[2:11:03] we'll talk about wednesday night
[2:11:06] your confession
[2:11:08] and your possession it's not hearsay
[2:11:11] it's yours
[2:11:13] and god is the high priest of your
[2:11:15] feeling
[2:11:16] nope
[2:11:18] he's a high priest of your confession
[2:11:22] he's a high priest of your faith in the
[2:11:24] word of god
[2:11:27] so we come to the gentiles or we come to
[2:11:30] jesus and every time jesus would go
[2:11:31] somewhere they said oh jesus come come
[2:11:33] lay hands on my daughter come come lay
[2:11:34] hands on my son and come lay hands on
[2:11:36] this and come lay hands on that
[2:11:38] but every time he met a gentile what'd
[2:11:40] they say
[2:11:42] you just you just speak with some
[2:11:43] authority we know you have authority i
[2:11:45] have authority you have authority you
[2:11:47] just speak
[2:11:49] how many times you've been called a dog
[2:11:50] and you still want somebody to bless you
[2:11:56] it's our phoenician woman
[2:11:59] jesus told her
[2:12:00] we don't feed dogs
[2:12:04] jesus told her we don't feed dogs
[2:12:08] and she could have said bless god
[2:12:11] i'll not go back to that church again
[2:12:17] it's all in your
[2:12:18] attitude what was her attitude
[2:12:22] yay lord
[2:12:24] but the dogs have got to have some
[2:12:25] crumbs
[2:12:27] the dogs have got to eat
[2:12:29] i want to eat from what falls from your
[2:12:32] table i don't care if it's the main
[2:12:33] course
[2:12:34] i want to eat what fell on the floor
[2:12:38] and what did jesus say he said i have
[2:12:40] found no greater faith in israel
[2:12:45] and that woman's testimony is still
[2:12:47] being talked about
[2:12:48] it was a humility and attitude that you
[2:12:51] have
[2:12:52] if you have that blessed god i'm not
[2:12:54] gonna yeah you go ahead
[2:12:57] but jesus said there's no greater faith
[2:13:00] same way with a centurion
[2:13:01] you know what the century was saying he
[2:13:03] said look i know you're a man of
[2:13:04] authority because i'm a man of authority
[2:13:05] if i tell 100 people to go do this go
[2:13:07] fight this battle over on this certain
[2:13:08] street boom they go you know what he was
[2:13:10] telling jesus
[2:13:11] he said you're a man of authority
[2:13:14] i know that if you speak to a devil it's
[2:13:16] going to leave
[2:13:17] if you speak to a legion of armies of
[2:13:20] angels they're going to go do what you
[2:13:21] tell them to do that's what he was
[2:13:22] saying he called a revelation
[2:13:26] he didn't say lord i got to feel it
[2:13:30] he'll say lord touch me
[2:13:33] even jesus said hey i'll go to your
[2:13:34] house and lay hands on film no
[2:13:38] i'm not worthy
[2:13:40] you just speak the word
[2:13:42] and he said again i have found no
[2:13:44] greater faith
[2:13:46] in israel than what two gentiles
[2:13:48] that were dogs
[2:13:50] that were not even supposed to be
[2:13:52] in the promises of god
[2:13:55] yet he said i found no greater faith
[2:13:59] than just speaking the word of god
[2:14:01] and it being the truth god bless you

[2:18:29] [Applause]
[2:18:31] [Music]
[2:18:36] i was telling you a story a minute ago i
[2:18:38] didn't finish it but
[2:18:39] you know people come up to be prayed for
[2:18:40] and i know some of the ministers know
[2:18:42] what i'm talking about even laithy
[2:18:44] that
[2:18:45] when when that when that thing clicks
[2:18:49] when somebody really gets something
[2:18:52] it makes you weak
[2:18:54] i know brother bob different ones and we
[2:18:56] we've witnessed that now that doesn't
[2:18:58] mean you go by feelings now i don't want
[2:19:00] you pray for everybody the same
[2:19:02] but there is some time when that thing
[2:19:04] when that when the thing lines up and
[2:19:06] then and boom you get what you get the
[2:19:08] miracle healing
[2:19:10] you get the healing right then well it
[2:19:12] draws strength out of you i mean you
[2:19:13] just about buckle your knees sometimes
[2:19:15] when that anointing comes and because
[2:19:17] what they're doing they're drawing
[2:19:18] strength not from you the person they're
[2:19:19] drawing strength from what you said
[2:19:21] the faith they had in the word of god
[2:19:23] that if you preach the true word of god
[2:19:25] to them and preach faith to them then
[2:19:27] they're drawing from that faith then
[2:19:28] that's why brother ryan said do you make
[2:19:30] him make a contact you know hold the
[2:19:32] hands or or put your hands on the head
[2:19:34] but you don't have to
[2:19:36] you don't have to do that
[2:19:38] like i said before brother brown prayed
[2:19:40] for a lot of people but a lot of times
[2:19:41] he took that little finger and he said
[2:19:42] hey
[2:19:44] only believe all things are possible
[2:19:47] whatever you have need of and they walk
[2:19:49] off the platform being healed so it's
[2:19:51] not that you have to touch them but but
[2:19:53] man it's a wonderful thing to know that
[2:19:54] we
[2:19:56] i believe we're in the right measure of
[2:19:58] faith now
[2:20:00] to where god can really move
[2:20:02] in your life
[2:20:04] your family's life
[2:20:06] your children's life
[2:20:07] your husband your your
[2:20:10] your wife anything it's just to me it's
[2:20:12] wide open
[2:20:14] if you'll believe
[2:20:15] if you'll have faith
[2:20:17] make sure you're born again make sure
[2:20:20] that that you've got all that stuff out
[2:20:22] of your life make sure that we come to
[2:20:24] church
[2:20:25] and before we walk in that door
[2:20:27] say god forgive me of all my faults and
[2:20:30] failures
[2:20:31] forgive me of that argument i just had
[2:20:33] with my wife some of us are accused or
[2:20:35] we're not accused of that some of us do
[2:20:36] that
[2:20:37] but you ask the lord because you don't
[2:20:39] want to bring that devil inside this
[2:20:40] inside this room
[2:20:43] amen amen
[2:20:45] it's listen it's a warfare paul said it
[2:20:47] was a warfare not not of human bodies
[2:20:49] y'all listen y'all are not jumping
[2:20:51] across the aisle fighting each other
[2:20:53] but during that whole service the devil
[2:20:55] and god was over there and angels were
[2:20:56] fighting a battle between all of us
[2:20:59] up here too fighting the battle they're
[2:21:01] battling in that other dimension they're
[2:21:03] battling and it ain't pretty
[2:21:05] but we know who wins amen
[2:21:08] god always wins
[2:21:11] listen it's a long-term relationship
[2:21:13] with god
[2:21:14] amen
[2:21:16] you know what he wants us to get us to
[2:21:17] know him more
[2:21:19] that's what he wants he wants to get us
[2:21:21] to know him more that's why he's let us
[2:21:23] have this walk brother john for all
[2:21:25] these years
[2:21:26] and the message of the hour when brother
[2:21:27] brown left the scene they thought it was
[2:21:29] over
[2:21:31] they just didn't know it just began
[2:21:33] and then it still took
[2:21:35] years
[2:21:37] of people
[2:21:39] with false doctrine and and do's and
[2:21:42] don'ts and
[2:21:43] like brother dick said bruised a lot of
[2:21:44] fruit and drove a lot of people away and
[2:21:47] like that girl is on the internet i
[2:21:49] can't remember what her name is but
[2:21:50] she's she's uh
[2:21:52] glad that she got out of the message
[2:21:54] because it was a cause and it was all
[2:21:56] this but she came up in an under strict
[2:21:58] home and
[2:21:59] and she just got she got preached too
[2:22:02] and she there was no love
[2:22:05] there was no love there you could tell
[2:22:07] it there was no love
[2:22:09] that's why you know sure we have to be
[2:22:11] corrective
[2:22:13] but you got to love them
[2:22:15] you got to show love that's what's
[2:22:17] telling susan
[2:22:18] if you got a problem with your kids show
[2:22:19] love
[2:22:20] show love
[2:22:23] well they need to be born again show
[2:22:24] them love
[2:22:26] well they need to get out show them love
[2:22:29] and i listen i'm sorry i'm i'm one of
[2:22:31] the world's worst jim she knows it
[2:22:34] to jump at the jump into you know crack
[2:22:36] of the whip
[2:22:38] but i've learned over the years
[2:22:40] that don't do a whole lot except make
[2:22:42] people angry
[2:22:44] you gotta love them with love
[2:22:46] but you gotta love them with godly love
[2:22:47] you love them with filial love because
[2:22:48] they're yours you'd take a bullet for us
[2:22:51] what i told hannah i said look i'll take
[2:22:53] a bullet for you but i don't like you
[2:22:58] boy i got everybody quiet
[2:23:00] you like what your kids do no you don't
[2:23:02] like what your kids do i love them i
[2:23:05] love them and would take a bullet for
[2:23:07] them with no
[2:23:09] hesitation
[2:23:12] but i'm not going to enter into their
[2:23:13] foolishness
[2:23:16] that's why i said i love them
[2:23:18] but i don't like them
[2:23:20] i you know what it's not them it's the
[2:23:21] devil inside of them i don't like it
[2:23:24] so if you'll show them the love of god
[2:23:26] keep showing them the love of god keep
[2:23:28] just putting little things in and
[2:23:30] they'll see it listen like like like
[2:23:33] brother brown said satan's a bluff he's
[2:23:34] the best bluffer there is and if you're
[2:23:37] bluffing he's already bluffed you
[2:23:40] he's a bluffer of the bluffers
[2:23:42] as laban and and jacob what did brother
[2:23:45] ernie always say he said it was one con
[2:23:47] man kind of another con man
[2:23:49] there were two con men counting each
[2:23:50] other you can't con the devil he either
[2:23:53] knows like brother like brother donnie's
[2:23:55] daddy said you either got the goods or
[2:23:57] you don't
[2:23:58] and satan knows it so you can't bluff
[2:24:01] him
[2:24:01] but listen if you'll just do
[2:24:04] what god said in the bible
[2:24:06] just try our best
[2:24:08] come to church read your bible study
[2:24:11] yeah you go you know what you're gonna
[2:24:12] go home today and you're going to sit
[2:24:13] down in your chair and the devil's going
[2:24:14] to go
[2:24:15] why are you going back for him
[2:24:18] you didn't get nothing out of that
[2:24:20] he preached on you the whole service
[2:24:22] then you know what look over the devil
[2:24:23] and say no he preached on you the whole
[2:24:25] service
[2:24:31] like brother gary longoria said he said
[2:24:33] it's not you we don't talk about the
[2:24:35] kids it's not you that we don't trust
[2:24:36] it's the devil we don't trust
[2:24:38] amen
[2:24:39] so if he starts filling your head full
[2:24:41] of stuff just tell him say look no
[2:24:44] i read over here that there's a lake
[2:24:47] that you're not going to be swimming in
[2:24:51] you're going to die in
[2:24:54] and then i've got this place over here
[2:24:56] that says if i get born again i got
[2:24:57] eternal life where's your scripture to
[2:24:59] say that satan
[2:25:01] where's your scripture that you get
[2:25:02] eternal life
[2:25:04] yeah but you're this bad and you've done
[2:25:05] this and
[2:25:08] don't want to hear it
[2:25:10] blind vanities
[2:25:13] take that take that and use that talk to
[2:25:15] the devil you know what we talk to god
[2:25:17] talk to the devil tell him say hey get
[2:25:18] out of here
[2:25:21] that preacher preached on you buddy he
[2:25:23] didn't preach on me
[2:25:24] you just gotta quit making me do these
[2:25:26] things well i don't make you do these
[2:25:27] things well yes you do no i don't yes
