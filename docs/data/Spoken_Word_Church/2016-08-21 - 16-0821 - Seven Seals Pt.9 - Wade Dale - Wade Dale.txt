TRANSCRIPT
========================================
hello thank you wonderful hope everybody had a good week wonderful okay Lisa me and Lisa had a good week cuz we got to pick on T for a couple of [Music] days we got to pick on little brother for a little while at least just gigg all right the elevation I should have took some the elevation it's about 5000t said spray your nose when you have ear in spray your nose with blow and that go [Applause] down all right we are in our study on the first seal all right so now I think we're uh I mean I want to kind of go a little bit we're going to go a little bit slow but I want you to get this out of scripture first so let's go you don't have to go I'll just take us right to it we kind of ended up on 2 Thessalonians that's where brother R read the scripture second Thessalonians 2 I got it right here so y' he said how convenient you can read this better you read what's on you I can so all right so now he's Paul is writing to the Thessalonians and brother Brown picked this scripture in the first seal so we're going to read this one we're going to read Matthew CU that's where brother Brown went to Matthew 24 now what we were talking about last Sunday everybody remember that we were talking about a mirror all right Mirror Image now with god he's a Creator right so we are created in His image IM we are created in His image we are not we don't look like God we are God in another form so there's a big difference there cuz Satan as we're going to see here Satan is a mirror image of God but he's just an image like like Bob you know you can see Bob in that image right there well well that's the real person but that in there is is it can be distorted let me have you been to a a festival and I know one thing for sure you don't go into one that makes you look big you go into one that makes you look skinny you know you walk into them places and it's all dist well that's a mirror and that's what a mirror does a mirror shows what's in front of it but it doesn't have to always in other words it can lie to you how many times you look in the mirror and go man I look good many lies but you understand what I'm saying so that's why that and I was thinking about this morning and still again it keeps bearing on my heart that that brother R freaks the seal open the seal but yet we've not taken body chain so there's a revelation somewhere that we're not getting that one day it's got to click it's got to click that's right to each one of us individually it's got to click or we're just going to go by the grave we're just going to keep dying that's right right that's right so then it's got to be a person Revelation yes through God I mean from God through a prophet into your soul and then what words you bring in that has to mesh together and that's not a mirror that is actually God himself in another form right residing inside of you right that's why the world wants to that's why I think about you know this week hadn't had a lot of time to study but I just think you know think about things but um the world they always want to mirror somebody else you know this guy comes out with this certain hair do you see millions of people come out with this certain hair do you see this girl come out with a certain dress or undressed and the world come what they want to be the mirror image of that person there's some people have actually had plastic surgery to make them look like their most famous star see you and I don't have to go that's man you know what that is that's Satan perverting what God wants you to do he wants you to change your image but he don't want to change your physical image he likes you just the way you are he wants to change your spiritual image amen if you're born again today you have the spiritual image of Jesus Christ and not just a mirror image it's actually him inside there working his way out okay so what has Satan done he always perverts he never he never is an originator he's never original remember that he never is original he was created secondar so if you see Satan do something God's already put it out there Amen brother Bram comes on the scene and then you get all the Impostors coming well now why didn't imposters come first they didn't have anything to imposter after right in other words brother random walks up to the mirror of Divine Healing just say all right there's an image of brother brand in that in that mirror so they don't all they don't all now some of them were true but some of them he said were false what some of them do just take that image and they say we're going to imitate that's like um Simon in the Bible he saw all them and the Seven Sons of scha they wanted to imitate what they saw without having what they saw inside of them first everybody got that cuz you know Simon's like man I if I could use this and he might had pretty good intentions he said but in in other words Peter said God knows your heart inside your heart you're want to make money off of this or you want to do something and he said get away from us right May said I'll even buy it well see when you start doing that you know that it's false you can't buy salvation it's the freest thing in the world you know people don't want it but you see the people in the Bible that had it though Paul we know Jesus we know the devil seven sons of Kea that what the seven sons got caught up into into something they saw Paul and Peter and them doing Mighty Miracles and they just jump in presuming presumptuously and say we're going to mirror what they did right didn't work did it cuz it was a mirror image right it wasn't the exact image it wasn't the person you we got that's why brother I believe he introduced the person of Jesus Christ more clear than anyone in the since Jesus himself right so if he introduced that person he didn't introduce an image and a mirror he introduced the person of Jesus Christ now an image is not a person an image is an image like I said you could you can mask your image you can do all these things but what's inside of you is what's going to tell so what Satan has done though is when God rides out out God is God is his he he has his own power right he permiss remember we were reading it last Sunday power was given power was given power was given he has to give Satan you know who give Satan the power it's like Brother Gary Atkins used to say you got the man with a bow in Revelation 61 he's harmless he can't shoot you without arrows but we get into situations all the time where we hand him a dozen Arrows with the sharpest tips on them and say here now don't Sho me with it but no we hand him the we hand him the power what brother Brown say when when we come to this certain place that Satan will be powerless Satan's going to be powerless in the Millennium but he's still going to be here yes right he's not going to be walking around he's going to be messing with your head but he's going to be somewhere holding because he has no one to work through that's right and then maybe at the end of the Millennium we see that how he works his way back and tries to get enough people to you know to u to come against God but that's a whole another subject don't start thinking about that but that is what he does he's an imitator remember one thing he is a bluff he's an imitator he has to be given power and when you see a white horse ride out like brother Brown said here stands the Lamb with the book of hand there goes the White Horse writer he said when you got two when you got two subjects one of them is God and one of them has to be the devil not the second person of a trinity okay so now let's read second thoni Thessalonians so remember what he's going to tell you right here word of God's Eternal right so he's not talking to the Thessalonians this morning he's talking to the Lula lonians this morning now we beseech ye Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ and by our gathering together unto him that you be not shaken in mind because we see that happening now people are being shaken by the by different doctrines and ideas right all over the message and then some are turning and leaving right okay and if they left guess what if they leave this message and turn it down then they do not have the Holy Ghost so they are reprobate minded people not saying they can't come back yeah yo yeah look yes they can I mean there's only one thing and that's blaspheme the Holy Ghost right okay you said well turn into work well you turned it down so did you blashe no you a blasing now when they go out and go to a certain point and say you know and start saying things about it yes that is blaspheming but there's only one sin that's what I told y'all we we send people to hell that's going to be in heaven right that's right and God's going to send people to Heaven that's going to be I mean going to send people to hell that we think is going to be in heaven that's right so we got to get out of all this I like what brother roel and some of them were were saying you know it we and I used to do it I used to judge just like that well they're reprobate they're going to hell right there's only one thing you can be married 150,000 times and you can be a axe murderer you want me to read you in the Bible [Music] murderers fornicators adulterers Paul said such were some of you but you are Justified you are washed listen Blas beem in the Holy Ghost is the only thing that'll keep you out of Heaven that's right besides you know you're what you do everybody understand that yes so I'm not picking and choosing I'm not like the U I'm not like the old saying you know you see the the shirt that says kill them all let God sort them out you know no that's what we used to do we used to just kill them all and then well God you put them no leave them alone leave them alone there is a way for people to get back amen if a man in the scripture can marry his mother his stepmother we think that'd be pretty rough around here but he got forgiven he he was actually very sorrowful and forgetful had to be because Paul says he's back in the church now so you know I I quit doing that you noticed me I I don't I'm not I don't condemn people let them condemn their themselves sure you have to talk about things and P stuff but to warn people but you who am I to picking you now what's going to happen though when we go to the other side let me get back into that little bit when we go to the other side and judge then we do the judging but who is it is it really us judging is it really us judging no it's the word of God that's already been preach and God's going to say because you didn't follow like Sister Lisa followed then that is the your condemnation you didn't do what I said what you didn't do what she said you didn't do what I said okay so let let's not be so quick to judge people all right let them judge yourself I'll guarantee you one thing this time from now to the Rapture you're going to show who you are cuz that's what these seals are when that seal broke to that prophet he saw a white righteous Church the first church Age first three ages that had no that had no denomination had no impurity now Grievous wolves have started coming in but the first three ages they didn't have to fight over a trinitarian Doctrine they didn't have to fight over water baptism that was a pure church right but what rode out was was Satan riding out to conquer and conquer the ones that he was supposed to amen right right cuz you got to remember one thing the Bible says those who he has Justified yeah see I weigh heavy on that because you you got to be careful you can ask God to forgive you and it be a justification but it not be that kind of justification go God's just to forgive your sins even in this church over here God's just to forgive their sins if you truly ask God to forgive you he will but now what you continue on doing after that that's what God's going to judge right right but now that's not what this justification is talking about and this what we're getting into the seal is a higher form of when those who he has Justified he's already glorified you say well I'm just Justified yeah but God knows that if that is true justification pure justification in your heart you want to be a different person God's got to forgive you of your past cuz he said he would then you continue on in sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost then you go into a glorified condition but that that see that's what I'm saying your scripture has got meaning to it but remember there's a supernatural element even in scripture like serpent say brother serpent seed was revealed in the seal now he preached serpent seed in 1959 4 years before the seals open but what did he do it made more it made more clear what he was preaching he could look back and see and not that the original sin was sex with the Beast it was Satan entering into Eve's brain first and she accepted what he said and then you come down and watch he seals and you see both of them and you see this going and that's what happened in the in the U uh in Genesis and we'll read it and we'll show you where the the seals are in Genesis right right there in Genesis 1 2 and 3 4 5 right in there the seals opened right there in the book of gen and you can see a white righteous Abel okay the Bible says in Hebrews 11 that that Abel's blood CED out his the the blood of righteous Abel and then you see Cain and going going forward you see the two spirits and and I like what brother um Nester was saying to a point about how everything mingled back together and it did so you don't you can't do like some people in mess and go well we got a straight line from Adam right down to Jesus and we got a straight line cuz you got to remember that line going down to Jesus has way have the Harlot in it it's got Boaz I mean Ruth a moabit when you start interjecting that's not a Pure Line right but in God's eyes that's a Pure Line that's right okay all right same way with you and I but they mingled together they mingled their seed together so you can't figure out what line is where so you don't worry about it then what God God says okay all men needs to come to repentance all men needs to be judged by the law and then judged by Jesus Christ you see how God God moves up just like just like brother been preaching in stages God comes up in stages now not God but God to you and I he reveals himself in stages and there's only one I think about this morning you say well I can't understand all this and why am I this one you're in the age you're supposed to be in or you'd be in another age that's right okay you in the age you're supposed to be in or you would be in another age does everybody understand that God put you in this age because there's something it's not some genetic makeup humanly it's the gene seed of God knew you could take this pressure and you could take this word and apply it to your heart cuz John Wesley honestly Luther and Wesley this would blow their mind for a little while but now with the Holy Ghost that's right you can see them Wheels start turning that's right and then a little while later he'd say got it got it and they' move right up just like cuz the Holy Ghost is not limited right we limit the Holy Ghost right we limit him okay but Martin Luther's age just live by faith then they moved up right but true justification that's the only time in this end time this age we can see true justification how that we truly are Justified that person inside of you if you truly you what I'm saying truly Justified you're on your way to glorification or the Bible's wrong yes those who he justified that's right I think the Bible says right he has he is already he is what he done not what we did what he done okay so this is what we're talking about we're talking about a higher form of justification watching this mystery of iniquity watching something that maybe and and listen you know what iniquity is Right iniquity is knowing to do better and don't or knowing that you're doing something wrong and you continue to do it now we do that every day I'm looking at all of it we do that every single day there's things in our in our daily life that we go I should have done right right that's an iniquity but it's not a mystery to us now because later in the back in the ages you look how justification now what was the age of we're not get into this so we'll just talk about this the age of justification is what Martin Luther right the just shall live by faith now he walks into a pub drinks beer he's a German drinks beer and smokes a pipe and talks about God now God winked at that ignorance you say is that our justification to a degree yes to a degree [Applause] no you got it to a degree yes that's our beginning but that wasn't his that was his beginning and ending got it anybody understand that was his beginning and ending that was his Revelation the beginning and end of his Revelation was that it it doesn't matter what happens the just shall live by faith not by Penance not by pay and no venience not by not by crawling if you watch the movie I think you ought to watch that one where Albert fines or one of Robert fines plays Martin Luther yeah that's good he lays on rocks he's crawling he's trying to do some kind of penance but one day it's just like brother Dale said one day God drops down and says Luther it's not what you do right right you better start having faith in me talk about Jesus Christ and Martin Luther opens that scripture and reads a brand new book showing that the just shall live by faith now now parallel that with our justification see his justification carried him over sure he got the Holy Ghost he went through all the stages but it was justification he understood justification okay that was his beginning and his end right okay everybody okay with that because see you come up to here it's just our beginning right what does justification mean just mhm right just so it's just our beginning it's not our ending that's right cuz if it's our beginning it can't be our ending if it's just like his cuz I'm sure he went to the Grave let's just be honest smoking and drinking cuz he never came you understand he never came on up through the satification process that's right so that was his beginning and his end see now you and I our beginning is justification but if we continue There we can't die smoking a pipe and drinking beer that's true you understand so we have to I'm sorry that was that was just Holy Ghost Absol that's what I mean it was his beginning and his enden that's the Holy Ghost in that age the beginning and the end was justification right right but it was the Holy Ghost for that age that's right okay but now see you come to now your justification is your beginning that's what we're going to talk about right here we're going to talk about let no man deceive you that's our justification but it can't be our end cuz the word's been open more right in other words the devil's been exposed right the devil wasn't exposed in the smoking and the drinking back then that's right mystery of iniquity it is a mystery a mystery is something that's been hidden and now has been made known revealed means to make known all right so what happened is in the down Through the Ages it took brother Bram or a prophet let don't say brother Bram took the prophet to come and be the filter to where that he could tell us I don't think anybody in history looked back at Martin Luther and said Martin Luther was the justification of the age you understand what I'm saying commentaries sure Martin Luther is a wonderful man powerful man but it took a prophet to place him where he need to be right so that what you and I can look back and see that that justification though put him in the body of Christ but that justification in this age does not put you in the body of Christ so it's not your finish right that's right so those who is Justified in this age he's already glorified now hold on a minute you say that's just for us nope go back to Luther Luther's going to get a glorified body from that justification amen so those who is Justified he is already glorified right the next thing Martin Luther is going to get besides the resurrection is a glorified body off of what that justification they talk amen all right but with you and I you we got to move up that's why that when we come to the seals you see opposition see Martin Luther didn't see that as opposition I he didn't see the smoking and the drinking as opposition that's right okay right but in his soul he was born again in his soul God cleaned his soul up but his spirit and body had not come to a place to where God can move on out further and clean the man up he did that with the next guy John Wesley he moved out into sanctification and then Wesley I mean U yeah John Wesley's sanctification that ended his you know he went from sanctification to because the man he was stct stck stct stck okay dadd always he quotes it wrong it's not coffee it was tea you know cuz British drank tea you know they were tea drinkers he said tea it don't have no value it ain't even good for you in other words you know what he's saying you're drinking it because of a tradition Englishman English he was an Englishman they drank tea they don't drink coffee like we do they drink tea they have tree in the middle of the day they have tea in the middle of the day they have an evening they have an afternoon watch what Martin Luther was saying I mean John Wesley was saying you think that's doing you some good it's not doing you any good at all just don't drink it so see because he had to be different you couldn't go you can't each prophet of the age can't go along with the [Music] age right he's got to be like brother R said John Wesley was a f brain snatched out of the fire in other words he went through burning places up not physically but he burnt the soul of people so much to what they wanted to live a better life okay then you come up with the Pentecostal with the baptism of the Holy Ghost higher up being closer to God living holy right letting God use you to speak in tongues let God use you to heal the sick right then we come up to this age which is the word because we got to look in the seals where that four stages complete the birth in this age right not three four M there was four bugs that eat the tree down and four Messengers brother R said four death Messengers eat it four life Messengers brought it back what Mark I'm going just call their name Luther Wesley Pentecost and brother Brown the word the message that brother Brown brought from 63 to 65 was the word of God that literally turn us back what brother they been preach there so p attention to this we and and listen I I was thinking about this this morning in the shower I thought you can't lean so far that way to sinless Perfection we still going to have problems every day we going to have bad thoughts that's right we going to make human mistakes that's right you know and I and and I want to let yall know this that I'm ready for the Rapture you know people say w we doing this and that what you putting it on you put on human condition just cuz I don't like your way of doing something wrong answer I'm ready for the Rapture right I'm ready you better be if you're born again you've been ready for the Rapture right when are we going to start confessing like Brother D said that's well we ain't never going to get away well well you you don't come to church half time well don't worry about that just make sure you come to church more right and I'm tell you you got to start confessing it before you can get to it amen amen and I believe this is going this is the the the last 3 years coming up here I believe that somebody's going to come to a place where they see a body change that's right oh yeah now whether you step into it or not that's right you know that's you but you better start confessing that you're in a place where you can number one it's like a um in deer hunting and and it's a really good analogy because because you know you go and you you go to a place and like behind my house we've seen little deer and little bucks and we saw two or three down below the house the other day real close within a quarter of a mile but then you look on these videos and you see these deer this big walking around well they're not in Georgia they're in Kansas and Ohio and Illinois where they e corn and soybeans all the time well you know what you can go hunting behind my house house for 30 years and you ain't ever going to kill one you know why cuz they're not there that's right are you getting my anality you got to go where they are that's right amen and I ain't talking about lul just Lula church I'm talking about the ministry listen to a Ministry that can take you there why you going to sit somewhere and just shoot little bitty deer you know if you want a big one a little ones are okay but if you want a big one you got to go where it's a proven fact that they live okay it's a proven fact that big deer grow in Kansas cuz they eat corn and soybeans you know and they we got camera pictures of Georgia there's not that much well you going to stay in Georgia and say well I hope I kill one that big you just you know what you're doing you're in that mystery of iniquity you you know better you know better than to be there wanting that kind of a deer knowing that you got to go to Kansas to get it guys everybody understand what I'm saying you get this analogy you got to go where it's at that's right all right so and we got to see that that that God rightly divides a word of truth but you got to rightly divide it in yourself that's right right all these false doctrines you know what I don't even like I was telling Jun the other day people think and I'm kind of quick on the trigger trying to quit if you'll notice I've been a little more quiet I'm not so quick on the trigger but cuz I I heard a lady on the television or the radio the other day she said pray before you say that's right so I kind of stopped a little bit and kind of said okay how would you handle that you know kind of back off a little but anyway we got to come to a place to where we got to quit worrying about all these external thing you know people like U you know you take try to something now she and I can say things to each other that I surely couldn't say to Bow cuz it heard her F but she knows that we we talk that way but I'm going to quit do that cuz I apologize you know for something I said and U and I don't want to do that anymore I don't want to hurt anybody's feelings but what I'm saying is is we got to quit letting the devil stir all this up in our brain tomorrow the next day the next day you know Jun will do something and it just be toly dumb and so do I now we're geared different she'll let it bother her for a month I won't let it bother me for 5 minutes okay and she thinks now really she may think that I'm and I told her I said honestly whatever happened the other day I ain't thought about it never thought about it I'm on to something else I'm on to something else you need to go on to something else and quit like this right here if you keep letting it stay there brother Brandon made astounding statement he said here stands a lamb and there goes something away resist the devil and he will ride off flee from you you said what he's saying brother way listen the seals are nothing more than all the culmination of this message together in one in Seven Seals that's right that's all it is it's not some and it but it is a great mystery that nobody else has understood since the beginning of time Jesus was the only one who knew about it because you read it m i mean he preached him in Matthew all right right so let's read we got about 5 minutes let's read this but I want you to listen be focused on something like I said before you say something to me and then you come back to two three weeks later and go I sure sorry I know you I said what' you say I I just don't let things bother me anymore no I that you know with with even with your wife you shouldn't do that you shouldn't let things bother you should just you know there it go why clamor about it man we're we're head toward you know we we have taken the Baton in that last leg of the race and you know what that last guy does he don't think about nothing but finishing the Finish Line once he grabs that baton from that other [Music] [Applause] age it's kind of strange though that there's four legs to a to a race with the hand of Paton four just in case that in case b ghost didn't work the last one has to take it and you know what you put your fastest one last you put your fastest one last the best one is always last cuz if you're behind you know that joker going to catch up all right so that's the same way you're not saying well we ain't getting nothing we ain't doing forget about it people who's going to get it is going to get it who's not he not you can't help them except in a position to where you can talk to them that's right okay putting them down is not going to help them while now we beseech you Brethren by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ now what that's what we're looking for and our gathering together unto him right not gathering in one place uh geographically but gathering in one place spiritually that you be not shaken in mind or be troubled neither by Spirit nor by word nor by letter as from us as that the day of Christ is in hand let no man deceive you by any means all right for that day shall not come except come and falling away first now we see that happening all right that's what that's what brother Brown said about this scripture Paul was trying to tell him look he did talk about the coming of Christ but it's not coming in my age Paul knew Jesus wasn't coming in his age cuz Paul was a prophet he could see to the very end he knew there had to be an end time come to where these people would receive it but no man de see you that except they comeing the Fall Away first and that man of sin be revealed now that word revealed a watch that word reveal is the same word in the Book of Revelation the apocal you know the the Book of Revelations is that actually called The Apocalypse okay but look take off the cover that is disclosed or revealed to uncover lay open what has been veiled or covered up down to the church ages Satan has veiled himself right along with Christ and when Christ is moveed he go right along with it now you see in the seals what happened in the seals Satan R talk why he's been exposed uncovered okay I like to use that word uncovered I know we say that Satan can't be revealed but the Bible says he was but that word revealed means to uncover he's being uncovered cuz listen Satan's number one thing is is to get a group of people to love him just like they love God right that's his whole thing is to get a group of people to think he's God worship Him think they're going to get eternal life through him think all these things yeah that's what Satan job is not to make you smoke drink run around cuss and no that's an attribute of his presence okay that's an attribute of his presence right okay it's an attribute you smoke drink cuts and run around because you don't have God in your soul that's right okay but what happens to the man the man was born with a desire to worship so they worship football they worship porn stars they worship you you hear what I'm saying drugs alcohol that consumes a person because God's not inside so that's what Satan want to do he wants you to consume yourself with something besides God but you and I have come to the place to where here stands a lamb and there goes something there there's some there's a separation between the two let son of man be revealed a son of predition who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sth in the temple of God Satan's here today making you go to sleep showing himself that he is God not like him is that's how he's come up in this age he's showing himself remember ye not that when I was yet WI you I told you these things and know and now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time for the mystery of iniquity do already work so it already started working back in in Paul's a only he who now leth will let and brother R said that he is God leth will let until he us be taken out of the way cuz the only thing is helping when the only thing that's helping this world right now instead of going into total chaos is you're sitting here right you're sitting here today is taking all the is taking is taking the world from going totally off off the chart you and I and then shall that Wicked one be revealed whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth what word and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming even whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power signs and lying wonders and all excuse me with all deceivable deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish because they received not the didn't say they rece did not receive the truth they didn't receive the Holy Ghost that's not just love for your wife that's that's a go love that's the Holy Ghost receive not the Holy Ghost of the truth that they might be saved right got it cuz if you don't have the Holy Ghost you got Satan
