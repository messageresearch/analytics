i want to see you [Music] amen god bless you could be in the house so lord tonight did anybody else think it was wednesday today i felt like it was all day it was wednesday i kept thinking and then it's like you know what it's with tuesday i was hoping the work would be shorter you know no next week it's shorter but not this week because i keep thinking well you know i got a couple no i don't i've got three days so good to be in the house the lord tonight appreciate the lord and all of his blessings and amen amen good to see each one of you so um tonight we will look into uh first kings chapter 22. and y'all just pray for me tonight and kind of it's kind of something i spoke on at brother matthews church and and i'm going to share it tonight also it's a little different tonight but you know i believe that we're blessed people because you know there's a lot of people that look in the world and you know people spend years and decades studying the bible looking for truth and they have no idea what the bible says there's a lot of sincere people in the world and they have no idea what the bible says we're we're blessed people that he said blessed are your us for you see and that's god's grace to us that we that we're able to see and you know one of the things that it took for us to see was it took a profit so i you know one of the things i want to look at tonight you know we're a blessed people to have a prophet and it's all the way through the scripture that uh and you know one of the things you know prophets don't speak on their own you know prophets that don't speak without the authority of god you know uh all through the scripture we find out they get in trouble and you know so even you and i we're to speak what god says and not speak what we think right and not what we see but we're supposed to speak the things that we don't see right because if if we see by the eye of faith that doesn't necessarily mean that we see it but we see it by faith right if god said it whether that's what we're supposed to say god said let my word be true and every man a liar amen so we don't we don't look at what we see what goes on around us we look in what god says and that's what we're going that's what we speak and so you know god has blessed us that that we can see and you know those you know you you try to share with people what you see and it doesn't it doesn't get uh past your arms you know it's about that far enough sometimes it don't seem like it gets that far but uh before we read the scripture not let's just all bow our heads and remember each one that's i knew uh man many people are sick and i hadn't heard anything else about brother ray montgomery but i certainly won't remember him and all the other ones they've been fighting this covet thing and a co-worker of mine he found out he's got two masses that they say are cancer and so his name's jack and y'all just remember him he's got he's got a long road ahead of him but you know you just got to keep faith right we don't we don't look at what the doctors can tell us and they can do their own thing but you know god takes over after that you know so we we put our trust in and doctors up to a certain point and after that we we look for the great physician to take over so let's just all bow our heads our gracious heavenly father lord jesus we're just so thankful lord to be in your house tonight on on a tuesday night lord father we're just so thankful lord that we can come and gather around your word lord where you said we're two or three are gathered in my name i'm there in the midst father even if we didn't feel you tonight lord we didn't feel your presence and now we know that you'd be here because you honor your word amen and lord i just pray that you come tonight lord and just help us get out of the way you come speak to each one lord father for each one that's listening in tonight lord the ones that listen maybe later lord i just pray that you bless them and lord just touch each one that has a need lord the sick and the afflicted lord we've mentioned the different ones the lord that have been on our hearts lord we continue to look on on facebook and different places and text messages that we give people that are needing a touch from you lord and we just continue to hold them up before you lord father we know that you're the same yesterday today and forever lord amen and lord we're just still as as lord every day lord we're going to continue to plead the blood we're going to continue to speak faith over them lord no matter how bad the circumstance gets yes no matter how dark it gets lord that doesn't mean anything to you lord lord we just believe that the holy ghost will go and touch each one tonight lord and just lord just move us out of the way lord that you can have the preeminence tonight in the service lord and lord for your bride around the world lord the laboring brothers lord i pray that you be with them lord is brother fabian and them to be traveling lord i just pray that you be with them lord watch over keep them and bless them lord we just commit all things to you in the name of jesus christ we pray amen first kings chapter 22 verse ones and it says and they continued three years without war between syria and israel and it came to pass in the third year that jehoshaphat the king of judah came down to the king of israel and the king of israel said unto his servants no he that ramoth in gilead is ours and we be still and take it not out of the hand of the king of syria and he said in jehoshaphat will thou go with me to battle to ramos gilead and jehoshaphat said to the king of israel i am as thou art my people as thy people my horses as thy horses and jehoshaphat said unto the king of israel inquire i pray thee at the word of the lord today then the king of israel gathered the prophets together about 400 men and said unto them shall i go against ramoth gilead to battle or shall i forebear and they said go up for the lord shall deliver it into the hand of the king and jehoshaphat said is there not here a prophet of the lord besides that we may we might inquire of him and that's where i got my title from is there not here a prophet of the lord and the king of israel said unto jehoshaphat there is yet one man micaiah the son of in-law whom we may inquire the lord but i hate him for he does not prophesy good concerning me but evil and jehoshaphat said let not the king say so amen god bless you tonight you may be seated and you know we know that in you know israel did not have a king when they decided you know they wanted to be like everybody else and they just they desired to be like everybody else and just wanted a king and you know samuel told them said listen said god doesn't want you all to be king he wants to be your king he wants to be your ruler and they were like no we want to be like everybody else we want to be we want to have a king we want to we want to look like everybody else we don't want to stand out and be different we want to and you know samuel come and told him said listen this is what's going to happen to you the king's going to take your sons and your daughters he's going to take the best that you have because he's going to take that for himself because that's what kings do and you know and then samuel said have i ever done anything to you that's not has been contrary to the law has been contrary to god contrary to the word it's like no you've done everything you know if you've never taken from us you've never done anything wrong but he said he said but no we want to be we don't we want to be just like everybody else we want to have a king well you know then you know samuel you know he was brokenhearted in the way that the children of israel done but you know god come and told samuel he said listen he said i want you to know they didn't reject you he said they rejected me and and when they done that you know they chose a great man named saul who was a great man you know great head and shoulders above everybody else is a great great looking man but you know what he was a failure because in all that he done he didn't follow the word and you know and we see david we had we had david who was over the the kingdom you know because after saul uh broke the law and didn't follow the word of the lord you know he put david in and then he had solomon but you know they they had good men but after a while you know they started having uh terrible kings which was what god what samuel tried to tell him in the beginning what was going to take place you're going to have these terrible kings these are what's going to happen because you know these men are not because at a certain point these men are going to raise up and and they're going to be drawn to themselves and they're they're going to be drawn by political power they're going to be drawn by money and other influences that have nothing to do with god and you know and then we see ahab what ahab was the scripture tells us was one of the wickedest kings that israel ever had if not the wickedest king that they ever had and you know here we are seeing ahab and ahab this you know he destroyed the altars of god he tore down everything and built up idols to baal and everything and then you know because of political power because of political structure and and uh what what he could see just in his human self then he marries jezebel and then and you know and it absolutely just destroys the morals of israel and you know here and here they are and you know and it was nothing nothing but just chaos and problems from the beginning but you know that's that's what the forefathers wanted and and then the children had to had to live with that and it was just something that they had been taught and they just they just lived in this ungodly world and that's all they'd ever been seen that's all they'd ever known is this ungodly filth but you know as as ahab began to see these these great things and you know all he had was was the lust of his eyes you know he just wanted more things and he just wanted everything to because he felt like everything ought to be his but you know there was a you know he he stood there and he saw his garden one day and he saw these things and you know he saw a man by the name of naboth and he saw naboth's vineyard and he seen it you know he saw how wonderful it was and you know he wanted naboth's vineyard but you know naboth had a had an inheritance that come from his father's and you know he said he said i'm not going to go away from my inheritance this this belongs to me he said i'm not going to give it up he said no he said i want you to sell this and he's like no i'm not going to sell this and he said he said no he said well i'll swap you for something it's even greater than what you have and he's like no he said this is what's been given to me of my father's he said this is my inheritance this is my land he said i'm not giving it up he said that's what belongs to me well you know what ahab was so distraught because naboth wouldn't sell it wasn't a sell-out but you know he wanted to hold on to what he believed well then ahab was so upset that his that his wicked wife jezebel decided to achieve what having killed so that ahab could get what he wanted now in the midst of all this then you know they sent the spies you know the uh the children of uh uh belial i believe but anyway you know they sent them to be a witness to naboth to tell lies that he had blasphemed god and blasphemed the king and they took him out and they and they murdered naboth well at the same time that as soon as ahab found out that naboth had been killed and that he could take that man's land that he could take away his inheritance then as soon as he went to take possession of it the prophet elijah met him on the road and told him he said because you've slain innocent blood because what you've done now he didn't pick up a rock and he didn't just and he didn't throw anything at him but you know what he was an accessory to murder being the king and knew what his wife was going to do you know what he was sanctioned he sanctioned that and he was and his blood was laid upon abs house and jezebel and all of the children when he when elijah come and told ahab he told ahab he said he said god has cursed your house and your posterity he's going to cut you off he said you won't there will never be anything left of you and then then he goes on and he talks about uh uh it was jeroboam because you know jeroboam had killed to take the throne and you know and the and the uh the other man that had done the same thing and he said you'll be the same way why because you slew innocent blood to take something that didn't belong to you because because you didn't real you didn't uh respect this this man's inheritance he said he said so now the curse has been put upon you and he said you'll never you'll never leave you'll never get away from this curse and so when when ahab had this curse upon him everything that he done was cursed he couldn't get away from that curse because everything that he touched was cursed and so when when when later on we see when when he came to uh he saw that ramoff gilead this city when when he saw that the city and they hadn't fought syria but that was that was one of their israel's biggest uh enemies was was syria and they were all a time in war and everything and they never could overcome why because they had sin in the camp and they couldn't ever get rid of the sin so they syria was there to be a thorn in their flesh thorn in their side just to harass them because they never was right with god and so you know he said he said we see that ramos gilead was given to us by the prophet joshua joshua told that was part of our land that was part of the land that was given to us that was our inheritance but you know what you're not ever going to claim the inheritance of god living in the world you're not ever going to claim the inheritance of god being wishy-washy you've got to be sold out to god and live by god's rules and god's law then so he said well i just want to take this land because i see that it belongs to me because they were reading and he saw how good ramoff gilead looked but you know what he still was laying under a curse and so when he went out there and then micaiah he said he said uh what we need in jehoshaphat said inquire of god to find out if this will if we can take this city or not yeah sure and you know what he had he had 400 hebrew prophets you know he just didn't have anybody he didn't just get anybody off the street but he had 400 hebrew prophets stand there and tell him because why because they knew which side the bread was buttered on because they knew exactly what to do to make ahab and jezebel happy and so they could get up there and they could say oh no you just go ahead and take it the lord the lord's with you the lord will bless you the you can take ramoff gilead it's yours go ahead because it was prophesied to you well the problem was when you know that there was something jehoshaphat had just enough god about him to realize there was something problem there was a problem in there he had just enough spirituality about him that that didn't ring right but he didn't have enough spirituality about him to realize the man that he was hanging out with that he was fellowshipping with was cursed that he was that he had no business being there but he stood there and said you and i are just alike my horses are your horses and my chariots are your chariots he didn't even need to be in the same town but you know what he's like oh no no this sounds great this sounds great until he finds then until he hears the word of these 400 prophets and then it's like well this don't sound very good he said is there someone else that we can talk to he said is there someone else that we can inquire of god with is there someone else that might know how to talk to god who get an answer from god he's like well we got this one guy that we don't like he don't like us and we don't we don't really associate with him but he's like here's this one man let's let but he said let's go talk to micaiah well micaiah you know when when it come down to micaiah speaking speaking of of when he said can we uh were you an inquirer of god to if we can uh take ramos gilead well when when mikaya come up there he's like he said you know now now we want you to talk just like the rest of these prophets we we want you to we want you to be in step you know we want you to be just like everybody else just you know all you got to do is give up here and give your stamp of approval just give them a thumbs up and tell them everything's all right well you know micaiah just went up and told them y'all go ahead and go up go ahead but i'm going to tell you something y'all go ahead y'all y'all want to so bad well go ahead let me tell you what's going to happen you're going to get killed it's your death he said i see israel scattered like sheep i see what it's destruction but y'all go ahead i know that's what you want that's what's in your heart to do and then he said oh you know he was so mad that you know because this this is what you know you're just always saying bad things you just you just can't go along with with the program well the thing is is macayah had the word from god that that they shouldn't take that but you know the one thing about micaiah was makaya just didn't speak of his own word micaiah spoke because elijah had already cursed micaiah i'm sorry he'd already cursed ahab so when micaiah got the word of god then he looked back and he looked at what elijah had said and elijah had already cursed ahab so when makaya walked out there micaiah couldn't say anything else but he could only cur say what god had already said through of the prophet elijah and he had already been cursed and there was nothing he could else he could say he said he said your curse and he said there's nothing else you can say he said no matter you know how fundamentally you write you can be and everything looks so good and everything everything's so laid out so everything's so perfect yet you got to look back at what the word says and the word says that they were cursed and so you know then they go well you know they come down on micaiah and told him listen he said you you uh curse us and and say all these things and you know and then the the priest smacked him in the mouth and said you know where did the spirit of god go when it left me you know they locked him up and told him to feed him water and the bread of affliction and bread of sorrow and he said when when i come back i'll deal with him and he said you know if the gods if you come back god didn't speak to me so we understand that you know that that how important it is you know when we look at the word as mccain did makaya look back at what the scripture had said what the prophets had said because if jehoshaphat had actually been spiritual spiritual he'd actually known what had happened he'd already seen what had taken place but micaiah was standing there and then he had told him this is what's going to take place well if if jehoshaphat had been spiritual enough then you know what he should have packed his bags and went home he should have seen the destruction he said but you know what he went on anyway can we can we can we inquire of a prophet is there somebody that we can acquire of what god has to say and when he does then you know what he turns around and walks contrary to what god said and you know and then they wonder why people people wonder why they end up in trouble just like jehoshaphat did why because you know what he felt like he could he could just do whatever he wanted to and people people just want to follow whatever they whatever they believe but it's so important because god has has always from the beginning he's always had prophets right and he's always laid it out and and so you know the the prophets have always spoken by the word and they always dovetailed amen and we know that when you know when god wanted wanted to speak to the children of israel with moses and you know they they he wanted to speak to them and uh have have their own burning bush experience you know there came a time when the children of israel because because they seen the power and and the majesty and everything of the greatness of god you know if it scared the the children of israel and they and they were interfere and it's like glory moses moses you speak for god said we don't want we don't want to have what you have we don't want to have an experience like you have he said oh you go and tell him you go talk to god and you have you come tell us what god wants us to do and that's what we'll do but we don't want to have that experience and so he said fine he said if that's the way you want it he said that's the way it'll always be he said so we'll always have prophets that come and speak and so we know we know that when when moses was speaking and and and deuteronomy and and 18 generally 18 verse 17 says and the lord said unto me they have well spoken that which they have spoken he said i will raise them up a prophet from among their brethren like unto thee and i will put my words in his mouth and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command thee to get that up there and he shall speak unto them all that i shall command him and it shall come to pass that whosoever will not hearken unto my words which he shall speak in my name i will require it of him but the prophet which shall presume to speak a word in my name which i have not commanded him to speak or that shall speak in the name of other gods even that prophet shall die and if thou say in thine heart how shall we know the word which the lord hath not spoken when a prophet speaketh in the name of the lord if the thing fallen not nor come to pass that is the thing which the lord have not spoken but the prophet has spoken it presumptuously thou shalt not be afraid of him and this is from what brother is speaking on this in uh modern events made clear by prophecies he says now notice notice he began to speak with moses the prophet a prophet deuteronomy 18 15. he said i'm watching the scripture here he said see he said drop down and see god spoke to him on top of the mountain oh my the thundering they said let the lord let moses speak not god speak lest we perish he said then he said they said well i won't speak to them no more like this but i'll raise them up a prophet that's that's been his message all the way through that's what's got to settle the whole thing at the end it's just got to because the word of the lord has come has to come to the prophet it's the only thing it can come to if it don't it breaks god's word and makes him tell something wrong see it'll never go to a seminary goes to a prophet and the prophet is sent from god so we know that he sent he sent the word by the prophet and we know that in in the beginning we know that when it became and it was spoken by the prophet you know when god had had a a secret that he wanted to reveal when when he had when he had attributes that he wanted to express you know he had to he had to make that that known and so as he began to express those attributes you know he began to make it known brother brown said he said that great secret mystery that he had before the foundation of the world and he wanted to begin to express himself and so as he began to express himself he began to express it through the prophets and each prophet began to express what god was showing him and each one of them began to express the the portion of christ that was to be manifested in that time and and we know as he began to express these things you know it was hid from hit from the world and people didn't understand what was going on but you know when they went to look back and then other times they they sent prophets and the prophets pointed the people back to what the previous prophet had said because then it became clear to what what was what had been said because there were times that you know they were they were you know um things just like isaiah when isaiah was speaking of you know a a virgin shall conceive well you know there was there was a lot of people out there that was a little confused about all that you know and there was a lot of people that didn't believe him you know it's like you know what wonder word you've been doing isaiah that you even talk like this you know how can these things be well then the other side of that coin is people you know everybody that had they were hoping to have a little girl and they were expecting this girl to be be the one that was going to fulfill the law of my of the word of isaiah you know everyone was looking for something that was going to take place well then you know there you know all of a sudden they hear the eye in the days of isaiah when the word went forth you know there were people that were looking for this to be fulfilled well then you know what after after that generation passed you know it was like well we heard isaiah say and then you know the other ones well it was just another fable and did isaiah actually say that you know did this actually take place or this just words that somebody said and you know it's like well you know we don't know what was going to take place but you know what when when 800 years later when everybody had forgot about it and it was just it was just tall tales and fables and and you know it was just well you know that's what granny said and you know we heard her say this and you know we heard them say that and you know that's what's in these old books and these old scrolls say this but you know there was a there was a lot of people you know they had just they had just glossed over that it didn't mean anything to them but you know there come a time when people began to look into the scripture and you know it wasn't it wasn't just words on a page but it was something that was real to them because you know they actually believed that god was going no matter how many years it had passed that god had had said that they still believed that it was going to come to pass they still believed that that was going to go be in in one of these days that no matter we don't understand how it's going to take place we don't we don't understand that but we know that there's going to be one that's going to fulfill this and you know and so you know how is this going to take place well we don't know but we know that isaiah said it that's right but you know it's not it's not just one thing that isaiah said but it was each prophet that began to speak as brother brown's speaking you know there was it was a a secret that was there that that he was expressing but you know as it began to be expressed then it became a mystery to people and you know that was that was the expression because you know amos amos 3 7 says that the lord god would do nothing except he reveal his secret to his servants the prophets but then revelation 10 7 tells us but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he shall begin to sound the mystery shall be fulfilled so it had to be at first it was a secret that the secret was being made known but people didn't understand that but as the seeker was being made known then it became a mystery to the people but then that's what caught the people's attention was the mystery just like when moses was standing there and he's and he was out there and after all the struggles and the heartaches and the failures that he had went through then he was standing up there watching a bunch of sheep out in the middle of nowhere looking at all this desert and just wondering what was gonna become of his life when one of these days he saw a burning bush he saw a burst that was on fire but the bush wasn't consumed but but at that time see then it became a mystery to him why because it was god revealing himself unveiling himself and that was what the mystery caught his attention then he turned and said well i'm going to inquire why this bush is on fire but it's not being consumed so you know he could as a brother adam said you know moses could have went up there and took a scientific approach to it and you know he wanted to take some of the the bush and he wanted to do testing and all kinds of stuff but you know it was something that caught his attention that he turned and he wanted to find out more about this but then when he turned he had he had a desire to find out something god could speak to him when he turned to inquire then god could speak to moses and tell him he said he said you know because you've always heard your entire life that you're going to be a deliverer well now now you've gotten to the place where you can be a deliverer because all your faults and failures and trying to do it in yourself and all these things that's not that was not my plan my plan is for you to follow me and now it's that was the time that you can do that and so you know all those things that had taken place all through the scripture we see those things where god began to unveil himself and he made him making himself known well there was something that was real to the prophets but that didn't mean it was real to everybody else you know noah spent 120 years in his generation building an ark telling people it was going to do something they'd never seen before but he stood up there and said listen water's going to fall from the sky we're going to all the scientific all the scientific evidence in the world proved and there was no no such thing in the world but you know what he stood up constantly and consistently building an ark and he kept preaching that it was going to rain and all the and all the ridicule that the man faced and all the problems that he faced and yet he kept preaching to these people and trying to show them the grace of god that it was going to reign that judgment was coming and there's a way out but you know what they did they didn't ex they didn't see that they thought well here's another kook you know we just got we just got to deal with this person and you know you know they just want to come by and ridicule him and and you know cause trouble and everything like that but you know he still preached the word of god he was still the grace of god he was still mercy to the people of that day that was standing in leather his shoe leather standing there speaking to the people that it's time to get ready there's a way out but there's destruction coming but they didn't they didn't accept that and every and every one of the prophets as you look through their life you see god was expressing himself in a special way and you know we see even even down we see that joseph was was spoken you know as a perfect type of christ as and the whole life of joseph you know because you know being the one that was spiritual you know he was hated of his brethren but you know god had his hand on joseph and he and all the things that that he had faced in his life but you know he was loved of his father and you know here he wasn't he was he was loved of his brother his father so much that he was given a coat of many colors you know and and brother i'm saying this this coat you know it represents a covenant and you know here he is here is this one you know everybody thought well here's the seer and his brother's hating him so much that they they wanted they contemplated killing him and so you know here he is as a perfect type of of of his christ here you know here he wasn't and he was like well you know they didn't want to kill him but you know they made it look like he was killed and so you know he took you know they threw him into the into the pit and they took that you know they took his coat and they dipped it in blood and you know how all of those things type type the life of christ and in a perfect in a perfect uh story how we see each one of those because you know here here was christ he came and he was spiritual and he and he spoke to his brethren and he and he wanted to tell them that listen he had a prophecy that spoke to the brethren and tell them listen there's going to be things are going to take place he said i'll see all that y'all going to bow down to me and you know that just made him mad but they didn't realize you know he was trying to tell them the future he was trying to to bring these things and you know and he was like well you know we're we're just going to take him and we're going to take his coat and you know they they they took his coat and they dipped it in blood and then they threw him in the pit and they sold him for 30 pieces of silver and all that you know and as you see here this um the the coat you know it was as a type of christ you know being crucified as you know you can see that there was that covenant you know there was dipped in blood you know the flesh had to die he was sacrificed the flesh was sacrificed but then we saw the spirit left and you know went to the right hand of the father which is the right hand of pharaoh and you know we've seen all the things that as he was there you know speaking to the butcher and the baker and and all those type things all the way through the life you know of christ you know being on the on the cross and all these things but you know all of those things went that he went through but all of those things but when it came to the end it was to preserve life you know when he began to speak to his brethren and you know he was so happy to see them and yet they were so fearful when he made itself known to them after all that he had went through because he began to tell them because it was it was he said y'all he said john meant this for for trouble he said y'all meant this for evil he said but god has done this for good he said god has done this to preserve life and you know he wanted to show them the love that that he was wanting to bestow on them and they thought it was because you know they go well this is terrible here we are in this position you know because we're trying to survive this famine and here here's our brother that you know that we've treated so badly and yet he wanted to make himself known and listen he was so blessed he said look what god has done he said because there's such a famine and yet god has called me to save the world the the known world here we are in egypt the greatest nation in the world and we're able to say serve up you know store up food and he said now y'all can partake and he said there's a place for y'all to come that y'all can that y'all can weather out this this famine and you never have to hunger and so and all these things that have taken place you know it's a perfect type of christ because you know the thing is is god makes a way for us because he loves us so much that he's made a way for us but the thing is is do you accept the way of god he said because if you don't accept what god has done for you he's he always makes a way of mercy and grace but the question is will you accept it and then if you accept it then you know what there's a way out but if you don't the only thing is is judgment but god has blessed us so we come through and as he began to speak all the way through the bible we see him speaking through each one of the prophets each one of them began to manifest part of of the word and so when when you know when he began as john was the last one john the baptist was the last one that came and you know as the said that you know the the prophets built the body you know they preached the word that that he stepped out on that you know that he began to this whole time he began to express himself through the prophets and he made himself known so that when john came john was pointing him back to the scripture to tell him that listen he said you've heard all of these things that have been preached you have heard all the prophets you've heard what moses has said all the way from the beginning and you've seen all this been made manifest but now the one that has been meant you know that has been prophesied all this time he said now he's here he said i don't know where he's at but i can tell you that he's here the one he said that i'm unworthy to unloose his lad his shoe latches but i want you to know that he is here to fill you with the holy ghost and fire he said he said he said i can baptize you with water but he said there's one that's coming to bring you into a new relationship to bring you into a new position because all the things that have been prophesied through the old testament now is it is is for here to be fulfilled and so you know only after all these people have studied all this and all the pharisees and and all the all the scribes and all the priests and all the things that they had said all these years and talked about when he stepped out before them you know they couldn't believe that this is this is the one they didn't even they didn't even believe john was the one you know when jesus when jesus was speaking to the scribes and the pharisees that time he asked him he said he said uh they want to know how you know by what authority do you do these miracles he said well let me ask you a question he said by what he said was john's baptism was it a man or was it of god and you know and you know he said they they were afraid now they didn't believe that john was a prophet but the scripture says that they were afraid because the people believed that john was a prophet that's right because they said they said well if it be of man they were going to be in trouble because the people were going to riot they were afraid that they were going to have a mess on their hands but he said he said well they can't say that it's of god because if they told jesus whether the baptism of john was of god well then he would be saying well why didn't you follow it you were you were required to follow the word of god and if you say it's of god well he said well we don't know why because they knew that they were backed into a corner but when when john began to speak of the word then he began to speak and he said the spirit of the lord came to him and told john he said the one whom you see the spirit of god like a dove descend and stay he said then you'll know that's the one and he began to speak and he said this is behold the lamb of god who takes away the sin of the world all the way through the scripture he began to point back to what had been said and here was the manifestation of that word and then when jesus began to speak you know he began to speak then he began to point back the whole time he began to speak of what was said why because they had walked away from the scripture he said so when jesus come jesus didn't bring no anything new to tell he kept telling what the law said he said look back he said he said search the scriptures he said he said and and he did search the scriptures he said in them you think you have eternal life he said they are they that testify of me he said he said where he said show me where i disbelieve the word show them where i've not fulfilled the word right see he kept pointing them back to the word to show them listen this is what this is the fulfillment of the word and he began to show listen but you know they didn't want to believe that right and so you know god you know and we understand that that was that was the grace of god that you know because if it hadn't been for them being blinded and and disallowing and turning over aside the messiah then you know we never would have been able to come in but you know it was grace of god that he called us and he made a way because it was prophesied in the old testament that they would be old gentiles that would come in as in joseph you know we understand that joseph had a had a gentile wife but we know that we know that all the way through the scripture the prophets just as jesus was rejected every one of the prophets was rejected when jesus began to speak he said he said he said you garnished the tombs he said you polished the tombs of the prophets and the spiritual ones that have come and he said he said which one of the if your father's not put there and he said you know he said oh he said if we'd have been if you know we're abraham's seed if we was in abraham's day we'd do we'd follow abraham and if we were in the days of the prophets we'd follow the prophets and he said he said but today is the day of the word and he said now he said i'm pointing you back to the word and he said you he said you don't believe this word he said you of your you are your of your father the devil and he said the works that he do he says what the works that he does you do and so they point them right back to the word and they did not fulfill the word they did not believe the word but you know there was a time but there was a group there was a small group a remnant that believed what was said in the midst of a midst of all that insanity and chaos because brother brown said he said it was a golden time when the people believed the word of god but he said when they rejected the word he said it was a time of chaos he said he said why he said why was solomon's temple and solomon's reign such a such a glorious time it's because the people believe what my what solomon said but you can look back at all the other prophets and the different ones and yet how many of them were sown asunder and murdered and killed and rebuked for what they had said but then when they come to find out that it was true then they turned around and said oh really well you know you know what a wonderful prophet what a wonderful prophet you know and we honor all these people and yet they had turned down and destroyed everything that they had done and the same thing with you and i because when he began to speak and he began to he began to un fulfill itself manifest itself and fulfill the word that was written he began because you know jesus had had a desire had something that he wanted to make manifest and he was and and and all the way brother and i said all the way through the the old testament all through the scripture we see that in types we said we see there was a partial word that was being made manifest but then when he became he became the fulfillment of that but then he wanted he wanted to fulfill another portion of himself and which was the bride there was a bride to be made manifest and brother ram said you know he said it was it was the word of god it was the word of christ it was the body of christ being made manifest in bright form so you know because when he when he came yet he was he was just like when adam came he said because adam came and he was he was the manifestation of god in human flesh and yet there was another portion why because he was lonely there was another portion to be expressed and when he become to when he came to this time then you know when he came on the in the earth as as walking fulfilling the word there was another portion that he wanted to make in which was himself in bride form and so when he came there you know he he was crucified that that that the bride could the spirit the life that could leave him that could go and and redeem the ones that he had called that that so there was a bride that had to be made manifest and then they began to manifest the word the word of their day and so you know you know here they are all all of these ones you know here as brother ram said they were standing in the temple after they had seen him preach for three and a half years and seen the miracles that he had done and all the things that he had done and they stood there in the temple and they stood there singing my god my god why hast thou forsaken me singing the prophecies that david had wrote in the psalms and they were standing there singing those things and he said out there on golgotha was the fulfillment of that word and they let him hang out there naked and rebuked and despised by the world and that was the fulfillment of what they were desiring and you know how beautiful it was but you know that that was that was the grace of god why because it was grace to us because you know it still it came that you and i could come in that he called you and all the way through the scripture you know when when paul came and he stood there and he began to speak to the people when they started to get away from the word of god and he said you've lost your first love and he went back and he started pointing him right back to the scripture and you know here he is here's a here's a great learned man paul standing there speaking and he was pointing him right back to the day and he was like look he said back there in days of moses when they had the tabernacle and they had the shoe bread and they had the altar and he began to express each one of those things and he began to express each one of those things and he showed jesus christ and he walked through he walked with them all the way through the scripture when they were out there in the wilderness and there he was walking he was a cloud by day a pillar of fire by night and he was standing and it was grace manifested in a prophet that was hidden in a prophet and he began to speak to him and he began paul began to bring back all the things that from the old testament and he began to bring it present tense and show this is the fulfillment of that word and see jesus christ has always been on this journey all the way through manifesting himself to his people and he began to express each one of these things and he began to show the same thing that had taken all the way through and people hadn't seen it but that was the day that mo that paul came to show all the things that had taken place in the old testament and we we see that you know as it as all the way went through the as it goes through the uh the church ages you know jesus said unless a quarter a week die and go on the ground and die he said it abideth alone amen amen and how many people they they were so you know they were so you know when people they're they're they're so um blind but you know they see these things and they wonder why why would did god allow these things to take place why why did why because it was it was the plan of god because god was manifesting his attributes as as you know you know because he he he allowed he allowed the devil to do his work bring in bring in a little saying you know begin to mix mix the word with man's word man's ideas begin to begin to work all the way through why because it was fulfilling all the way through the scripture and people say you know it came that that we we see when the when the red horse rider began to ride and and all these this murder and everything it's like what a terrible time but you know that was the fulfillment of god's word he began to manifest the the attributes of god and people don't see that they say well that's you know how can how can a god stand there and and see these things take place and just be quiet when when all these children were being killed when when babies were taken from their mothers when they were removed from their mothers unborn and then here they are being destroyed and how how can that be how can be that that be the uh the will of god for all these things to take place how can all these things and we can't we don't understand but it takes it takes the mind of god to understand these things it takes it takes the life of god and the only way that you understand these things is because god reveals them to you and when he began to reveal these things and he began to express these things then we understand why these things take place the way that they do and as they begin to unfold and and we see these things all the way through and you know why because that the life had to go down in the ground and it had to die and it had to abide alone but you know that's the only way that it was going to come back in multiplied form is that it had to go in the ground because the seed had to go into the ground because you know just like just like all the way through the scripture you know justin justin when we see even natural life shows us that it has to go into the ground so it had to it had to go through those things and and you know uh satan thought he really had something going on where he was able to overcome he thought he was overtaking the kingdom of god and he was able to do something just like he thought he could destroy jesus when he went into the went to calvary and died you know he thought he put him in the grave hey you know he thought he was going to destroy the church he thought he thought he was going to get somewhere but he didn't realize that when that life went in there he was fulfilling the word of god and as that life laid there you know you know what he never couldn't destroy all he never could destroy the roots of that tree he never could destroy all of it but he could do it he could destroy the effects of it and so it looked so dark it was so dark but you know what they became liked that it was a day that the light shone and there was a man who had been looking for something and had searched for something and the lord spoke to him and told him he said the just shall live by faith this and so when that light began to shine and he began to see because the glorious light had shot on the word that it began to express and his life became and it started to grow right you know through the through the shoots and the and the stone and the tassel and all that you know it began to grow back and they began to express each one of those messengers began to bring that word back and you know each one of them had they was there was a wonderful expression that took place but you know what each one of those expressions that god ever had they were rejected each one of them was rejected and so you know but as as all those things took place yet god had something greater and had something greater and you know what and it came to our day and you know there was a lot of a lot of things that people had seen all the way down through the history and they they saw all these things that they were all you know people probed at things and and all these things that had been that satan had entered had put in and you know had scrupled things up amen how people don't understand people don't see that there there was a need in our day for a prophet that there had to be somebody to come and take up all these loose sins and all these things that were hidden in the scripture why because because there had to be one that could come like he said the messenger of this day would would he said it came to do two things he said he said to point us back to the faith of the fathers the ones that came and walked with jesus that he preached to and brought them the word to take us right back to that that same the same uh foundation that fame same doctrine that they had was what was to be preached in our day you know everybody thinks that you know uh acts 2 38 baptism and oneness of the godhead and all these things they think well this is some kind of new things no it's as old as christianity the problem is is people have gotten so blind and and because satan has sown so much so much seed that's in there that has polluted everything that people don't even realize what's truth but you know the thing is it doesn't matter if you're a child of god it doesn't matter how much how much the devil comes in how much forces he brings how much how much everything he tries to sow seeds of discrepancy or whatever it doesn't matter what he does he cannot take away the light from a child of god if you're ordained of a light then guess what then the light will shine on you he will bring you the word it doesn't matter where you're at no matter how far away you get from god people think that you think you're a million miles away from god well that's what god knows where you are and god knows where to bring the word to you right where you're at amen and you know the thing is if you're if you're a child of god and you're you're ordained and god predestinated you to this then you know what then then you are going to come to it hey you know what but you understand that there's there's many people in the world that have been for ordained to condemnation they're not they're not ever going to come to the to the realization of this because you know what god can speak to them and show them and try to speak to them but you know what they will always turn the word down why because that that is that is their desire that they have made and they'll and you can speak to them because no matter you can give them a million years and they'll never accept it but you know what a child of god it doesn't matter you know no matter what how dark the storm is or all the conditions whatever when the light shines on them they will see it and we see that so in our day there was a prophet that had to come sure third day we had to receive a prophet you know a lot of people say you know he's uh i don't under i don't understand why why why why people believe that that we have to have a prophet we were given the scripture we have all the bible god sent sent prophets and he sent scribes and he sent all the apostles and everything and he gave us the word here's all the word right here so why we don't we don't need prophets because we have the bible and like i told them i said well the thing is that when you go back god gave moses the law which was the bible in their day he fulfilled all that everything that they had needed was given to him in the law but you know what he still sent him prophets why because the prophets were said to send a look upon him right back to what the law said and so you know why do we have why do we have to have a prophet in our day why because he pointed us right back to what the scripture said why because you can read and read and read and read just like brother branham said it takes more than just reading and study word for word and line by line but it takes the life of god it takes a supernatural insight it takes a supernatural insight from god for you to say the word it takes it takes so it takes more than just our human ability because we'll never figure it out we'll never be able to see it but it takes god who sent one who was ordained to show us these things you know that people you know you know they they spent all their time trying to tear down the the prophet and they try to tear down what god does well you know what it just the more more things take place the more i realize that it is the fulfillment of god's word there wasn't there's never been a prophet that's ever come that brought the word that wasn't rejected there wasn't one that's never been ridiculed right that's been turned out and you know what and so if it was same thing as it was then if they'd done that to jesus he said if they've done it to the master of the house what will they say to you what will they say about you so they've done exactly the same thing to brother branham but he came to bring us the word to bring us to the place that we need to be that we can see who we are but you know what we're going that he was rejected jesus was rejected and you and i will be rejected this this brother brown said that the world will not have us the world will be we'll be despised and rejected just like jesus was but you know what he said he said we were given the ability god gave us the word that we were the to be the word made manifest in our day just as jesus was made manifest why because it was prophesied that there would be a bride in the last days there would be one that would come and everybody wants to look back just as revelation 10 said you know there would be a days of the voice that when he began to sound but who is going to hear the sound if he was going to begin to speak and to open those mysteries and somebody had to be there to hear it amen and just as just as john stood there and you know the angel was standing there with the open book and he stood there and he said he said you must eat this book and he said so go and take it he said well give me the book and he began to and so john took the book a type of the bride ate the book and he said then you must prophesy again so you know that's the thing we must eat the word we must take the word and we're going to be rejected but you know what we're to eat the word to be manifested to manifest the word and he said he said through the shed blood through through the operation of all these things that god has done in our day all the things that take place the prophecies that has taken place in our day he's he's given us the grace he give us the grace to take this word and make it manifest that we can be born of his bone and flesh of his flesh and life of his life that we can be the word expressed and brother branham said in in the in the church age book he said you know a life lived by the word it would be the word expressed and so that's the way it is so and all these things that have taken place yet in our day we we have been the ones that have been come to fulfill this word brother branham said speaking of here in the in the masterpiece he said he said the word living and in action the bible bride not some man-made bride the bible bride smitten and afflicted of god no beauty we should desire her but yet we did esteem her smitten and afflicted of god that's right she stands alone she is smitten from all the denominations according to revelation 3 she is smitten out of the laodicean church age she was raised up in it she was raised up in see the church was raised up in the lao to see in church age that's the husk but if them other ones went he said can't you pentecostal men see that if that other was husk and died then the other the stalk had to die if the tassel had to die so must the husk die the three stages of organization they begin to talk about see it's just the same as methodist and baptist and presbyterian and all those he said see she stands alone like the bridegroom rejected a man despised and rejected of the churches the bride stands that way what is it see it's his masterpiece see it's the word that he can work through make manifest rejecting right he said now at the harvest time the seed is back to its original life back to the bible malachi 4 said would be brought brought that way must have it all to be this way it must be all of the word and brother bram says here in the ephesian church age he said god's intention for his creation man was to express his words in genesis adam was given the word to live by a life lived by the word would be the word expressed is it true or not but did adam live by the word no because he was because he was to live by every word and he failed to take heed to every word then rose moses and the great men they all failed to live by every word that the prophet the great type of the great prophet to come fell in anger to obey the word and there was david the great king of israel a man after god's own heart he felt by adultery when he was tempted but eventually in the in the fullness of time there came one the head even jesus who also must be tempted to see if he would live by every word that proceeded out of the mouth of god then was satan fooled for here there was one who lived by it it is written and that masterpiece of god overcame by reflecting god's word then was this manifested perfect one given to the cross as the perfect lamb of god for the perfect sacrifice and on the tree he received the wounds unto death that we by him and because of him might eat of the tree of life and then that life freely given would enable us to overcome and express the word of god amen so let's let's all stand this evening and all the things that went through yet he has enabled us to overcome that how do you overcome by the word what he say to overcome is the recognized devil in all of his tactics heidi oh how do you see the devil in all of his tactics yo yo come on how do you see the devil in all of his tactics by the word the word reveals it to you to show you all the things that the devil does so when the enemy comes in like a flood he said he'll raise up a standard against so we we understand that all the way through the scripture you know i as as that song i i don't know the i i only think of one line of it it says i'll take the way what the lord despised few but you know uh i'm going through i think i'll believe the song i'm going through i'm going through but just what i was thinking about you know i'll take the way what the lord's despised you why because each one of them was rejected right all of them walked walked in the way of the word of god and they walked in the way of god you know what they were rejected and you know what you and i will be the same way despised and rejected but i want to walk just like jesus why because that's because if you're if you're the life made manifest then you know what all the things that he went through all the things that he manifested you will too you'll see because if if if he has the life in you if it's god's life it's the life of jesus christ in you then you know when people say well i don't know i don't know if i can do that or not well you know what it you know i i tell i tell everybody i've always told everybody my entire life most most most of you or some of you have seen my dad most of you knew my dad you know i you know i didn't i didn't have to go look in a mirror to try to be dale roberts ever since i was big enough to know anything i've always had people tell me you're dale roberts is boy i didn't have i didn't have to do nothing but all i had to do was people people could see when they saw me they saw g uh they saw dale roberts they saw they saw daddy and me and you know it wasn't something i had to go stand in the mirror and practice i don't know about y'all sometimes i get up in the middle of the night go to the bathroom and i see daddy in the mirror i take a double take like holes and even you know even now as i get older people say you know look there he looks so much like dale he looks so much like that well it wasn't something i had to do one because it was the life that's in me one because i'm a son of dale roberts so everything that i do i just i look like him i have mannerisms i sound like him in some ways but it was a you know so if the life we have the life of god then you know what it's not a struggle lots of times the struggle is we get in the way we get in our own way because you know what the life is there if we allow the life to the the life of god to manifest it you know what then it's just like brother ram said he said the christian life is just as easy to live as any other kind of life one because it's easier if we just yield ourselves to him then he can maybe be man benefits he said the works that i do shall you do also well i don't know if i don't know if i can do that or not well you know what that's what the bible said you could do you can overcome why because you've already because he's overcome because if he's overcome then you'll overcome one because he's made the way for you amen glory hey so the same things so if you if you have children that are lost then you know what he's he's the savior well then you know what you're a child of the savior that you can claim your children you can claim your children you can claim whether or not you have money in the bank account or all your bills paid he said because he said my god shall supply all your needs according to his riches and glory he didn't he didn't stutter on that and he was not an indian giver he didn't make a statement and then just try to back it up because he will back it up he didn't he didn't he wasn't stuttering and he didn't get confused on what he said right so no matter what the devil brings your way and say you can't receive the holy ghost then you know what he's a liar because if the devil comes and says you can't overcome then you know what he's lying amen you can't you can't get healed you can't get delivered you can't get an answer from god well then you know what hey you don't know he because if he's talking to you he's lying so if he's if he's speaking you know what then he's that he's a liar and then we don't well you know what god's gonna speak to us and you just stay there and you wait and see if god don't speak to you right all right we get we get in our own way and we're just like daniel daniel stood there was trying to pray for to get an answer from god well you know what it took three weeks when gabriel came and told him he said he said we fought the prince of the power of ariel prince of persia he said he said we battled him for 21 days he said hey but he said he said but michael came and overcome him he said so that i could come and speak to you well you know if that was if that's what he had to do then you know what he's still going to come and speak to you well you just hold on no matter how long it how dark it gets know how how lonely it gets know how how much depression comes in no matter what it is you stay right there and god's going to bring you an answer why because you keep you stand there because god is obligated to his word he's not obligated to me he's not obligated to you but he is obligated to his word and believe me something brothers sisters if we're born of the word then the word that you and i have inside of us he's obligated to that he's obligated to his word we're the children of the word and he's obligated to that praise the lord word don't have to back up we don't have to slack up we don't have to deal with anybody because we're going to stand on the word of god and then he said he said we we don't know if we have an answer or not he said don't you worry and the day that you need an answer he'll give you the answer he said he just said i'll put the words in your mouth that you need to answer to close the mouth of the critics see the thing is we need to have boldness why because each one of the he's one of those prophets had boldness they didn't they just walked in what they what they saw and what god had given them to speak amen that's right well then we don't have to we don't have to be afraid we don't have to be scared we don't have to be depressed we don't have to be lonely we don't have to be discouraged we don't have to be sad hey brother matthew always says he said i'm too anointed to be disappointed he said he said i'm too blessed to be stressed he said i'm too glad to be sad he said i'm too high to sign cry why because god has given us a position amen why because god god had grace to us to bring us and we've seen the fulfillment of the word amen amen the word because god give us a prophet in our days and so you know you know i could stand on what he said all right that's it and and because when when eleazar came and i'm gonna stop here in a minute i promise when eliezer came and began to speak to rebecca you know it wasn't that hey that she was drawn to eleazar because the word that eliezer began to speak to rebecca she was longing to see isaac but you know he preached it so much he preached that so much to her that when she saw him in the field in the distance she slid off that camel to go run and meet him because she saw him amen a man she had never seen before but yet she recognized him right how will i know him by the word glory what did fanny crosby say she was blind all of her life she said but i'll know him she said i
