[14:42] lord i just pray that you'll be with
[14:43] them
[14:44] bless them in a special way tonight
[14:47] and father we just commit all things to
[14:49] you in the name of jesus christ we pray
[14:51] amen
[14:53] amen hebrews chapter 8
[14:57] and
[14:58] verse 1.
[15:02] it says
[15:05] now the things which we have spoken this
[15:07] is the sum
[15:09] we have such a high priest who is set on
[15:11] the right hand of the throne of the
[15:13] majesty in heaven
[15:15] a minister of the sanctuary and of the
[15:17] true tabernacle which the lord pitched
[15:19] and not man
[15:20] for every high priest is ordained to
[15:22] offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it
[15:25] is of necessity that this man
[15:28] have some what also to offer
[15:31] for if he were on earth he should not
[15:34] be a priest seeing that there are
[15:36] priests that offer gifts according to
[15:38] the law
[15:39] who therefore unto the example and
[15:42] shadow of heavenly things as moses was
[15:44] admonished of god
[15:46] when he was
[15:48] about to make the tabernacle for
[15:50] see saith he that thou make all things
[15:54] according to the pattern shown to thee
[15:56] in the mount but now hath he obtained a
[15:59] more excellent ministry
[16:02] but how much also he is the mediator of
[16:05] a better covenant which was established
[16:07] upon better promises for if that first
[16:11] covenant had been faultless then should
[16:13] no place have been sought for the second
[16:16] for finding fault with them he saith
[16:18] behold the day come the days come saith
[16:21] the lord when i will
[16:23] make a new covenant with the house of
[16:25] israel with the house of judah not
[16:27] according to the covenant that i made
[16:29] with their fathers and the day when i
[16:31] took them by the hand to lead them out
[16:33] of the land of egypt because they
[16:35] continued not in my covenant and i
[16:38] regarded them not saith the lord for
[16:40] this is the covenant that i will make
[16:42] with the house of israel after those
[16:44] days saith the lord i will put my laws
[16:47] in their mind and write
[16:49] them in their hearts and i will be to
[16:51] them a god and they shall be to me a
[16:54] people
[16:56] amen and then we're going to just flip
[16:58] over
[16:59] and read hebrews chapter 4
[17:02] and just a few scriptures here beginning
[17:05] of
[17:06] verse 11
[17:10] and it says let us labor therefore to
[17:12] enter into the rest lest any man fall
[17:15] after the same example of unbelief for
[17:18] the word of god is quick and powerful
[17:19] and sharper than any two-edged sword
[17:21] piercing even to the dividing asunder of
[17:23] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[17:25] marrow and as a discerner
[17:28] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[17:30] neither is there any creature that is
[17:32] not made manifest in his sight but all
[17:34] things are naked and open unto the eyes
[17:36] of him with whom we have to do seeing
[17:38] then that we have
[17:41] a great high priest that is passed into
[17:44] the heavens jesus the son of god let us
[17:46] hold fast our profession for we have not
[17:50] we have not and high priest which cannot
[17:52] be touched with a feeling of our
[17:54] infirmities but was in all points
[17:56] tempted like as we are yet without sin
[17:59] let us
[18:01] let us therefore come boldly unto the
[18:03] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[18:06] and find grace to help in the time of
[18:08] need amen god bless you may be seated
[18:14] is that better
[18:16] is that better
[18:18] we're good
[18:19] okay
[18:21] so uh
[18:22] i'm entitled this let us
[18:26] and
[18:27] the
[18:28] subtitle was a royal priesthood
[18:32] but uh you know paul says
[18:34] there's many scriptures in in in the
[18:36] scripture that paul writes and and he
[18:39] says let us
[18:41] let us and
[18:42] that's what what caught my attention was
[18:45] he was speaking about
[18:46] a royal priesthood
[18:49] but he begins to speak about christ
[18:52] coming
[18:53] and how christ was a high priest
[18:57] and
[18:58] how he said
[19:01] you know when
[19:03] moses had
[19:05] everything in the in the wilderness
[19:08] and the tabernacle set up and had the
[19:10] priesthood and how the priesthood
[19:11] started
[19:12] and all those things but christ was a
[19:15] greater high priest than than what aaron
[19:17] was and all the things that they had
[19:18] done
[19:19] and all the things that had had went
[19:21] through being
[19:23] as a high priest and
[19:25] we know that
[19:27] you know that was a uh just for a time
[19:29] that they would be a high priest
[19:32] or a priesthood but there was an eternal
[19:34] priesthood
[19:35] and and the scripture tell paul tells us
[19:38] that he said and ye
[19:40] are in holy priesthood
[19:42] amen
[19:43] and he said and he says that that we
[19:46] are a
[19:47] royal priesthood
[19:49] and so the the scripture tells us who we
[19:52] are and
[19:53] they're in uh first peter
[19:56] chapter 2
[19:57] and
[19:59] verse 5 and it says ye also as lively
[20:01] stones are built up a spiritual house
[20:04] and holy priesthood to offer up
[20:05] spiritual sacrifices acceptable to god
[20:08] by jesus christ wherefore also it is
[20:11] contained in the scripture behold i lay
[20:13] in zion a chief cornerstone elect
[20:15] precious that he that believeth on him
[20:18] shall not be confound unto you therefore
[20:20] which believe he is precious but unto
[20:23] them which be disobedient the stone
[20:25] which the builders disallowed the same
[20:28] is made the head of the corner and a
[20:29] stone of stumbling a rock of offense
[20:32] even to them which stumble at the word
[20:34] being disobedient whereunto also they
[20:36] were appointed he said but you're a
[20:38] chosen generation a royal priesthood a
[20:41] holy nation a peculiar people that you
[20:43] should show forth the praises of him who
[20:46] hath called you out of darkness into his
[20:48] marvelous light
[20:51] and so
[20:52] i was just looking at this and and and
[20:54] you know we see how the things that were
[20:56] in the in the old testament and the uh
[21:00] the aaronic priesthood and and all the
[21:03] things but you know god had an order and
[21:05] it had said everything in order and god
[21:07] had had brought the things and he called
[21:09] moses up into the mountain and he showed
[21:11] a vision and told him said set
[21:13] everything in order and there was an
[21:15] order to that but yet that was that was
[21:18] something that was going to pass away
[21:20] there was only a limited time in which
[21:22] this would take place but you know he
[21:24] said it but he had one which is speaking
[21:26] of christ coming and christ was a
[21:29] greater high priest than what aaron had
[21:33] but it was a divine order but there was
[21:34] a divine order with what christ and he
[21:36] was a greater high priest that came and
[21:39] it had a and he said it had a better
[21:40] covenant with better promises and so you
[21:44] know we look at the at the old testament
[21:47] at what god had done for them in the old
[21:49] testament
[21:50] and even and we began to look at what
[21:53] god had given them and commanded them
[21:55] and shown them
[21:56] and you know god was not well god was
[21:59] always faithful in the whole journey of
[22:01] the children of israel and everything
[22:02] that they went through and everything
[22:04] that moses had went through all the
[22:06] problems and all the trials and
[22:08] everything he was he was he was perfect
[22:11] and he was faithful in what he had
[22:12] called them to
[22:13] but but the children of israel they were
[22:16] the ones that didn't follow what god
[22:17] wanted them to do
[22:19] but you know it was it was them
[22:21] continuing to
[22:23] have not have faith in what he had
[22:24] called them to believe
[22:26] and he began to show them you know there
[22:28] and you know when
[22:30] abraham had had went into the into
[22:33] egypt there and you know and they had
[22:34] went in and you know he said that you're
[22:36] that your descendants would would
[22:38] sojourn in a strange land there and
[22:41] you know uh joseph had went in and you
[22:43] know and all the things that had taken
[22:45] place but you know he said listen you're
[22:47] only going to be here for a short time
[22:49] but it's it's a time that you're going
[22:50] to have to come out because god god
[22:52] won't bless them outside of the place
[22:54] that god had called them to
[22:56] he couldn't bless them in egypt now they
[22:58] were blessed for a while there but they
[23:00] couldn't stay there because that was not
[23:02] what god had called them to
[23:04] and you know many times in our lives god
[23:06] has called us and we've been blessed by
[23:08] things but you know what god has called
[23:09] us to a greater a greater place a
[23:12] greater higher plane than what we are
[23:14] today but god is wanting us to move on
[23:16] and you know you cannot be blessed where
[23:18] you are today
[23:20] because you can you're going to be
[23:21] either worse or better than off of where
[23:23] you are today we leave this service
[23:25] tonight we'll only be better or we'll be
[23:27] worse
[23:28] but we but we've been called to a place
[23:30] to be higher and and to draw closer to
[23:32] god and receive the benefits in which
[23:34] he's given us because you know he is our
[23:37] high priest and you know in the old
[23:40] testament as it said the old testament
[23:42] you know they were they were there to
[23:44] intercede for the people
[23:46] right and so you know and and one of the
[23:48] things that that that struck me is you
[23:51] know when when we began to speak of the
[23:53] of the royal the priesthood and how you
[23:55] know god god called aaron and his sons
[23:58] and and told them these are these are
[23:59] going to be my people they're going to
[24:00] be sanctified unto me
[24:02] and they're going to do my work
[24:04] and that you would the children of
[24:06] israel would bring their gifts to them
[24:08] but you know and all the things that you
[24:10] see that that they begin to do the
[24:12] things that they set up
[24:15] and you know and you see in the in the
[24:17] tabernacle as as they begin to be set up
[24:20] and everything and then later on as as
[24:22] they begin in their journey
[24:25] and as as they came into the land of
[24:27] promise we know that when they when they
[24:29] came in that god told aaron and and
[24:32] moses to to gather up the manna and put
[24:34] it in the in the r and the in the holy
[24:37] of holies there would put up the owners
[24:39] and that those men that served in the
[24:42] office of the of the priesthood then
[24:44] when they were called to come into that
[24:46] place they were brought into the into
[24:48] the presence of god and was given the
[24:51] manna
[24:52] that had been saved and so they've been
[24:54] tasted of that heavenly man of the
[24:57] heavenly gift and here they are begin to
[24:59] to feed on that
[25:01] and so you know when when they begin to
[25:03] serve outside of outside to serve the
[25:06] people and they begin to serve these
[25:08] things and follow the ordinances of god
[25:11] you know they had an experience to tell
[25:13] people about
[25:14] because they had actually stood in the
[25:16] presence of god and not only did they
[25:18] just think and hear about the manna that
[25:21] failed and the miracles that took place
[25:23] but they actually got to eat that manna
[25:25] they had actually tasted of that manna
[25:28] and then when they began to stand up
[25:29] there and you know no doubt when they
[25:31] stood out there and they were offering
[25:33] the sacrifices and doing
[25:35] doing the work of god yeah there was
[25:37] something that held them
[25:40] because those men as they stood there
[25:42] they were sending one because they had
[25:43] been in the presence of god
[25:45] they had and it wasn't it wasn't just
[25:47] that we were just following the word we
[25:50] were just following a plan we're just
[25:51] following what what the letter of the
[25:54] word but that was an experience that had
[25:55] taken place in them that when they began
[25:58] to walk out there no doubt some of them
[26:00] could see that you know they they did
[26:02] not just do this as a job but they also
[26:05] saw this as a sacrifice this was worship
[26:07] unto jehovah this was what they done for
[26:10] god and so it meant something more than
[26:12] just you know just doing a duty or or
[26:16] something like that but it was something
[26:17] that they realized this was my uh part
[26:19] that i give to god this is this is my
[26:22] sacrifice given to god
[26:24] so i'm doing my part
[26:26] and you know not only is it just you
[26:28] know we're just going through a ritual
[26:30] but no but they see that this this is
[26:32] honoring god amen
[26:34] and so is today you know many times we
[26:36] we felt that when we come to church or
[26:38] do different things you know sometimes
[26:40] we we fail to see the significance of it
[26:43] and we fail to see that you know we're
[26:44] worshiping god and the things that we do
[26:46] every in our lives is is to be an as as
[26:50] romans 12 tells us that you know our
[26:52] lives are supposed to be a living
[26:54] sacrifice acceptable unto god which is
[26:56] our reasonable service so these things
[26:59] that we do we can do just you know we
[27:01] can just get wrapped up sometimes in
[27:02] just living life and not realizing you
[27:04] know we are a royal priesthood a chosen
[27:07] generation to show forth the praises of
[27:10] god so we can we can sometimes just get
[27:12] lost in those things and not realize who
[27:14] we are
[27:15] the things that you are you and i are
[27:17] called to do
[27:20] so those those priests as they begin to
[27:22] do these things you know and
[27:24] you know then it's just as time went on
[27:26] you know it began to they the people
[27:28] began to lose the uh sincerity of it
[27:33] the sacredness of it was gone
[27:37] right
[27:38] even
[27:39] even when we began to read in the
[27:40] scripture
[27:41] even the priest
[27:43] began to walk away from that and it did
[27:46] it didn't have the sacredness it didn't
[27:47] it didn't have there was no sincerity in
[27:50] it anymore
[27:51] it became to be more of a ritual
[27:54] we're just going through the motions
[27:57] but you know all those things god god
[27:59] wrote all those things to pass
[28:02] but that was just that was a a covenant
[28:05] that was to pass away
[28:09] but there was one that came that was to
[28:11] be a greater
[28:13] a greater high priest
[28:15] that brought a greater covenant
[28:18] and so as we see he came and then you
[28:21] know he said he said because paul's
[28:23] speaking here and he's you know he's
[28:25] speaking to the to the hebrews and
[28:27] you know they the the jews had a you
[28:29] know they had an understanding of the
[28:31] old testament and all the types and
[28:32] everything so you know he goes back to
[28:34] the old testament he brings these things
[28:36] out and he's
[28:37] speaking of the law
[28:40] because you know here's these the things
[28:42] that they see in the word and he's like
[28:43] well you know if if that
[28:46] covenant had been had been what god
[28:48] ultimately desired he said we'd have
[28:50] stayed with it
[28:52] but he said he said you know all these
[28:54] things came that would be a to pass away
[28:58] but it was a type of one that was coming
[29:01] christ that had a greater covenant to
[29:03] the people
[29:05] and now we've been able to enter in that
[29:07] we have greater promises than those in
[29:09] the old testament had that he did he
[29:12] began because you know as as they took
[29:14] their sacrifices and offered them you
[29:17] know as the scripture tells us you know
[29:19] that that's not what god ultimately
[29:21] desired
[29:23] i mean because you know they because the
[29:25] scripture tells us you know that's what
[29:27] god required of the people but that's
[29:30] not what he ultimately desired
[29:33] because in in hebrews
[29:36] when he's speaking paul's speaking in
[29:38] hebrews again in chapter 10
[29:41] he says wherefore when he cometh into
[29:43] the world he says sacrifice and
[29:45] offerings thou would has not but a body
[29:47] thou hast prepared me
[29:48] he said in burnt offerings and
[29:50] sacrifices for sin thou hast had no
[29:53] pleasure
[29:54] then said i lo i come in the volume of
[29:57] the book it is written of me to do thy
[29:59] will o god
[30:00] above when he said sacrifice and
[30:02] offerings and burnt offerings and
[30:04] offerings for sin thou would has not
[30:06] neither has pleasure therein which are
[30:09] offered by the law then said he lo i
[30:12] come to do thy will oh god he taketh
[30:14] away the first that he may establish the
[30:16] second
[30:18] by by the which we are sanctified
[30:21] through the offering of the body of
[30:23] jesus christ once for all
[30:25] i the brothers want to find it it's at
[30:27] the end
[30:28] it's all the way to the end brother
[30:30] of the notes if they want to bring that
[30:32] up and every priest standeth daily
[30:35] ministering and offering often times the
[30:37] same sacrifices which can never take
[30:40] away sins
[30:41] but this man after he had offered one
[30:43] sacrifice for friend for sins forever
[30:46] sat down on the right hand of god from
[30:48] henceforth expecting till his enemies be
[30:51] made his footstool
[30:53] whereof the holy ghost also is a witness
[30:55] to us after
[30:57] for after that he
[30:59] said before this is the covenant that i
[31:01] will make with them after those days
[31:03] saith the lord i will put my laws in
[31:06] their hearts and in their minds will i
[31:08] write them and their sins and iniquities
[31:10] i will remember no more
[31:12] now where remission of these is there is
[31:16] no more offering for sin having
[31:18] therefore brethren boldness to enter
[31:20] into the holiness
[31:22] the holiest of the blood of jesus by a
[31:25] new and living way which he hath
[31:27] consecrated for us through the veil
[31:29] which is to say his flesh and having an
[31:31] high priest over the house of god let us
[31:33] draw
[31:34] near
[31:36] with a true heart and full assurance of
[31:37] faith having our hearts sprinkled
[31:39] from an evil conscience and our bodies
[31:42] washed with pure water let us hold fast
[31:44] the profession of faith of our faith
[31:46] without wavering for he is faithful that
[31:48] promised
[31:50] so when we begin to speak of him being
[31:54] the faithful
[31:57] and bringing in a better
[32:00] um
[32:02] covenant
[32:04] see when when the old one passed away
[32:06] then he wanted to bring in a new
[32:07] covenant and he and he come in and he
[32:10] said he was not he was even though he
[32:12] all were required those that was not
[32:14] what he all ultimately wanted
[32:17] but there was one that would come that
[32:19] would fulfill the law
[32:21] that would fulfill the the fullness of
[32:23] the word because as as all of the
[32:26] sacrifices that were offered
[32:29] even even when when you go back and you
[32:31] look about all of the uh sacrifices that
[32:34] solomon offered when when they built the
[32:35] temple and and all the things you think
[32:37] about all of the the thousands of
[32:40] animals that were sacrificing you know
[32:42] and none of that done
[32:44] even though god accepted that worship
[32:46] that was not what god ultimately wanted
[32:49] and and that and then all of all of the
[32:51] animals that were sacrificed never took
[32:54] away that desire it never took away
[32:55] their sin
[32:56] it never fulfilled the law and it never
[32:59] fulfilled the requirement that god had
[33:02] and so and all those things that you
[33:04] know yeah they done what god wanted them
[33:05] to
[33:06] and then it covered them but it wasn't
[33:08] what but god had had a sacrifice that
[33:11] would come that would ultimately fulfill
[33:13] the law and it came and he and so he
[33:16] came as a sacrifice but he was also the
[33:18] high priest that had to come because he
[33:21] had to fulfill the covenant and by him
[33:24] coming and being the sacrifice because
[33:27] he became
[33:29] become the one that would fulfill the
[33:31] law
[33:32] then he become the mediator of that
[33:35] covenant
[33:36] when he become the mediator then he
[33:38] became
[33:39] they took on the role of being the high
[33:41] priest because he become the harvard one
[33:43] because he could intercede in that
[33:45] because he become the mediator of that
[33:47] new covenant that he was the high priest
[33:49] in which that could fulfill the law then
[33:52] then when you and i were able then he
[33:54] could be in our high priest then we had
[33:57] a way to have access into that way into
[34:00] that place because he stepped because he
[34:03] became our high priest and became our
[34:04] intercessor then through him made a way
[34:07] for us to come in
[34:09] then when then when paul tells them he
[34:11] said then come boldly before the throne
[34:13] of grace why because it's been a way
[34:15] that's been made for you the way has the
[34:18] access has been made then you and i we
[34:21] can come boldly that we can we can take
[34:23] and step into that place and we can hold
[34:26] fast to our profession why because he's
[34:28] made the way
[34:29] because the way you know his brother
[34:31] madam said so many times you know he
[34:33] said if he was standing here tonight
[34:35] standing here he said he couldn't heal
[34:37] you he couldn't save you he couldn't do
[34:38] anything for you why because it's
[34:40] already done so when he's already made
[34:42] the way in then who has to have the
[34:44] access
[34:46] then who has to come in then he said
[34:47] it's you and i have to make our way in
[34:50] because the way has been made for us
[34:53] that we have we've had access into his
[34:55] presence
[34:57] so the invitation is ours
[35:02] and so you
[35:03] you see in the in the old testament with
[35:05] the with the priesthood and the way that
[35:07] you know there was a intercession that
[35:09] was made and they had uh covenants that
[35:12] were made that
[35:14] and i was thinking of uh
[35:18] when the
[35:20] in the old testament when
[35:22] god gave the
[35:23] the law
[35:25] you know he he told them that there was
[35:26] a
[35:28] uh there had to be uh he set up cities
[35:31] of refuge
[35:33] and you know when he made those cities
[35:35] of refuge then he had access to those
[35:37] things he said if a man killed somebody
[35:39] unaware
[35:41] he said he said there was a place that
[35:42] they could run to that was to get away
[35:45] from the avenger of blood he said the
[35:47] access was made for them
[35:49] he said that they could run in and plead
[35:52] their case and he said and they were
[35:54] covered
[35:56] and there was a place for them to come
[35:57] into and so the scripture tells us that
[36:00] when they played their case before the
[36:02] uh
[36:03] before the uh
[36:06] the rulers as they made their case and
[36:08] then they they called and said well you
[36:09] have you you've been covered you have
[36:11] access into the city and that you're
[36:14] covered and the avenger of blood can't
[36:16] come and get you as long as you stay
[36:18] fortified here
[36:19] there there's a place for you to stand
[36:22] and come in and you let off the pressure
[36:24] then you then you're saving their safety
[36:27] here
[36:28] but the scripture tells it you know the
[36:30] scripture tells us that they didn't have
[36:31] to stay there forever
[36:35] many you know because there's a time
[36:36] that the scripture tells us that as long
[36:38] as that high priest that was in the it
[36:41] was in the office at that time he said
[36:43] as long as that high priest was there he
[36:46] said that person had to stay in the city
[36:48] and they were covered he said but until
[36:50] the death of the high priest he said
[36:53] then the man was free to go
[36:55] so then what was it he was the high
[36:56] priest that was doing intercessing for
[36:58] him he was his intercessor so as long as
[37:01] the high priest was there he had
[37:02] intercession but when the intercession
[37:04] finished then he could go free
[37:07] and so you know we see we talk about
[37:09] we've we've entered into this this uh
[37:11] place of refuge that paul talks about
[37:14] you know that we have entered in that
[37:16] god made a way that we can come in and
[37:18] we have access into this but you know
[37:20] there's a thing is when there is a time
[37:22] coming and we realize that today that
[37:25] god is still on the throne he is still
[37:27] our intercessor to the world
[37:30] but you know there's a day coming that
[37:32] you know what his intercessor or your
[37:33] work will be done brother bram said the
[37:35] mediatorial work will be finished and
[37:38] when that time is finished then you know
[37:40] what there isn't there is no more mercy
[37:42] there isn't there is no more covering
[37:43] for the world he said but as long as
[37:45] he's still laying there he said yes
[37:47] there is still blood there still is
[37:49] covering for the people are still
[37:51] covering for your sin there's still
[37:52] forgiveness but there's coming a day
[37:53] when that's not going to take place
[37:55] anymore but you know what it's telling
[37:57] us that when that's what that's what
[37:58] it's waiting that there's a time that
[38:00] the bride will be here but when that
[38:02] finishes then you know what we're going
[38:03] home
[38:04] because you know what that's going to be
[38:05] our ultimate freedom one because there's
[38:08] not going to be any more work that he's
[38:10] going to be doing and so he's you know
[38:11] not only is he waiting on us but he's
[38:13] still doing that work because there's
[38:14] still people that have to come in people
[38:16] have to come to that place
[38:18] but when that finishes then you know
[38:20] what then we're going to rapture
[38:22] just as just as that man who said in
[38:24] that city of refuge and he had refuge
[38:27] the whole time and he was safe and
[38:29] secure in that but you know what when
[38:30] the high priest finished his
[38:32] intercessory work that he was able he
[38:34] was free to go there was nothing
[38:36] remembered more no more in his past
[38:40] that what had taken place in the past
[38:42] had been forgotten
[38:43] none of the things that were remembered
[38:45] anymore and he walked out a free man
[38:47] and you know he could walk he could walk
[38:49] in the midst of all of the of the
[38:52] avengers that came and stood there and
[38:55] he said none of y'all can touch me
[38:57] why because i'm free
[39:01] it's and it's the same way with us
[39:03] because you know
[39:06] we know we know that satan is the
[39:08] accuser of of the brethren and we know
[39:10] we know he comes to attack us and he's
[39:13] he goes through like a as a roaring lion
[39:16] and you know they come and you know come
[39:17] and try to attack us but you know what
[39:19] there's coming you know because if we've
[39:21] entered into this into this realm of
[39:23] safety into this place of refuge that we
[39:25] can do we can be free then you know what
[39:28] there no there's nothing that's going to
[39:29] attack us they can't get to us unless
[39:31] god allows it but there's coming a day
[39:34] you know what then all the former things
[39:35] will be passed away you know we're
[39:38] coming to a day that we'll not have to
[39:39] see all these things anymore as
[39:42] moses told the children of israel he
[39:44] said this enemy that you see today he
[39:46] said you'll see no more and see all of
[39:49] the enemies that we see today all the
[39:51] things that we have to face in this life
[39:53] all the problems that we see in this
[39:55] world that are that are coming against
[39:57] us and all the battles that we have to
[39:59] face you know what we're not going to
[40:00] see them anymore there's coming a time
[40:03] why because we are going to be free
[40:07] we're going to be free from all these
[40:09] things
[40:12] what a wonderful thing that we have
[40:16] that we have that we have a high priest
[40:19] to intercede for our on our behalf
[40:22] he said we have we have a high priest
[40:23] that can be touched by the feelings of
[40:25] our infirmities we we have one that can
[40:28] that can reach to us that we can reach
[40:30] out to that he understands what it's
[40:32] like to be a human
[40:35] amen
[40:36] he understands all the the strengths and
[40:38] the problems and the failures that we go
[40:40] through
[40:42] why because he went through him also
[40:45] he came he came in flesh and and and
[40:47] lived
[40:48] and battled all this all the things that
[40:50] we battle as a human all the things that
[40:53] we've been through in our lives all the
[40:54] things that we've had to fight
[40:57] all the failures all the confusion
[41:03] but he's got the answer for it he's he's
[41:06] carried all the way through he knows
[41:09] he's made a way
[41:14] why because he's our
[41:18] intercessor and see he's he's and
[41:22] he's everything to us
[41:25] he's everything
[41:26] this is
[41:28] this is from the message jehovah of
[41:30] miracles
[41:31] it's 1959.

[43:49] but he's called us to be a priesthood
[43:52] also
[43:54] he's called us into a priesthood a royal
[43:56] priesthood and you know the and when you
[43:59] begin to
[44:00] look at these things is you know when
[44:02] when you see the the what god has has
[44:05] done
[44:08] you know what god has done
[44:11] for us amen
[44:13] you know that is what we are to proclaim
[44:15] to the world
[44:18] you know
[44:19] it it i hope i hope i can get this out
[44:22] but you know
[44:23] i
[44:24] you you see what god has given you and
[44:26] you there's a way that god
[44:29] i was i was listening to brother branham
[44:30] the other day and he was talking about
[44:32] he was talking about a
[44:34] housewife or whatever you know he said
[44:36] you know she she's so backwards
[44:37] sometimes she wouldn't she wouldn't
[44:39] answer the door somebody come to the
[44:40] door like so backwards he said but let
[44:42] him get full of the holy ghost
[44:44] he said you know what you can't keep it
[44:46] bottled up why because i got to share it
[44:48] with somebody
[44:49] you know because there's something on
[44:51] the inside that you've got to share
[44:53] there's there's something that's on the
[44:54] inside that's got to come out
[44:56] and so you know if god if god is our
[44:58] high priest and he's and he's brought us
[45:00] to this place
[45:02] and he's brought us into this spiritual
[45:04] this spiritual priesthood
[45:06] then you know what he's made us just
[45:07] like we are we're just like him
[45:11] that we are that we are a priesthood and
[45:13] in the scriptures paul was talking about
[45:15] that he came and you know every priest
[45:18] every priest offers sacrifices amen
[45:22] and and is in his intercessor and so
[45:25] when he's speaking here of him being
[45:27] being the high priest
[45:29] and us entering into this priesthood
[45:31] then god god has called us to a job also
[45:34] god has called us to a place also for us
[45:37] to do something
[45:39] you know not because you know the
[45:41] priesthood the priesthood was a servant
[45:43] to the people you know the priest is not
[45:46] just something that you're that you're
[45:47] in some kind of clique
[45:50] or you're in some kind of uh secret
[45:52] society or you're in some some kind of
[45:54] club or you know you've got you've got
[45:57] this special right or or something like
[45:59] that that has nothing to do with that
[46:01] but god has called us to to be to show
[46:04] forth the praises of god for us to do
[46:07] these things and so when we saw what
[46:10] what jesus come to do
[46:12] jesus became became
[46:15] he as the scripture tells us that that
[46:17] he that he had you know had no form he
[46:19] had no comeliness you know he had no
[46:21] reputation of his own
[46:23] but he come to do exactly what the
[46:25] father had him to do he was it was
[46:28] nothing of himself but he come he said
[46:30] he said whatever you know the son can do
[46:32] nothing of himself except what he saith
[46:34] the father do that do with the son
[46:36] likewise so you know he just come to do
[46:39] the father's will
[46:40] he said not not my will lord but thine
[46:42] be done and so when he began to do these
[46:44] things that what is it that you and i
[46:46] are to be doing is the exact same thing
[46:48] to to be i believe it was brother wade
[46:50] was talking about you know you know we
[46:52] sing the song and we sing the song about
[46:54] uh wanting to be like jesus to be like
[46:56] jesus but you know do we actually take
[46:58] and sit down and take the full account
[47:00] of what that actually entails
[47:03] what does that mean to us to be like
[47:05] jesus
[47:08] because many times you know we it's it's
[47:10] easy
[47:12] to to to do our own try to do our own
[47:14] thing or or you know because you know
[47:16] we're just we're just humans and we we
[47:18] get it wrapped up in and you know just
[47:20] human ideas and human thoughts and we
[47:22] think we can do it and you know the
[47:25] the devil likes to talk to you and put
[47:27] it in your mind and you know we've we we
[47:29] get wrapped up in those things and it's
[47:31] like you know
[47:32] it's it's not that that we try to do
[47:34] anything but it's to do what god wants
[47:36] us to do it's to be led of the spirit
[47:40] to do what god wants us to do
[47:42] but you know and and to understand that
[47:45] to be it to be an intercessor to be a
[47:47] high priest
[47:48] and that's one of the things i want to
[47:50] look at because you know when you see
[47:52] what what has god called you to do
[47:56] what what has god called you to do
[48:00] because you know the world is not going
[48:01] to see jesus christ except in you and
[48:04] i because you know the world is the
[48:07] world is looking for something that's
[48:09] real
[48:10] the world is looking for an answer
[48:12] that's that's that is it goes contrary
[48:15] to what the world talks about today
[48:19] why because the world is so full of
[48:22] people trying to find something that's
[48:23] real
[48:26] people will go out in there all the time
[48:27] digging and searching and trying to find
[48:30] truth and they can't find it
[48:33] you know there's so many people you know
[48:35] they they've spent all of their time and
[48:37] then and
[48:38] uh i was i was reading a thing the other
[48:40] day and they were talking about a man
[48:43] that you know he kept
[48:46] he had money and had fame and and he had
[48:48] all these things but you know he wanted
[48:50] to do he wanted to find something that
[48:52] he could do that would honor god you
[48:54] know to help people
[48:57] and uh
[48:58] and so you know
[48:59] without getting into a whole lot but it
[49:01] was just it was just amazing how you
[49:02] know he had a desire to do something
[49:05] that was that was beyond just just doing
[49:07] because you know he and the man was uh
[49:10] danny thomas
[49:12] you know and you know he had a great
[49:13] desire to help people you know what can
[49:15] i do he's like i've got money i got
[49:18] popularity i've got all these things but
[49:20] he said what but that's not that didn't
[49:22] fulfill me
[49:24] and you know he kept he kept he prayed
[49:26] and he's like you know what can i do
[49:27] that can help somebody
[49:31] and you know and all and all these
[49:32] things it was just it kind of struck me
[49:34] you know because you know people people
[49:36] have found they have found fame and
[49:38] fortune and all these things and but you
[49:41] know what that's emptiness there's
[49:42] nothing there
[49:45] but you know when he when he decided you
[49:46] know he said you know
[49:48] he's you know he was praying and you
[49:49] know something and
[49:51] began to deal with him about starting
[49:53] satan jude's hospital you know but you
[49:55] know you know he began to do something
[49:56] why because it was something and i thank
[49:58] god because you know you know god's
[50:00] works in hospitals and and doctors and
[50:02] thank god for them and all that but you
[50:04] know it's something that you know
[50:05] because god you know i believe god laid
[50:07] something on that man's heart for him to
[50:09] do that
[50:10] but it wasn't it was not just all fame
[50:13] and fortune and all these things and you
[50:15] know people chasing a pot of gold and
[50:17] all these things that's not going to be
[50:18] any fulfillment
[50:20] because you know the man that came to
[50:21] brother branham and you know he said i
[50:23] kept trying to find god and he said well
[50:24] you know if i when i got my ba degree he
[50:26] said i thought i'd have it and he said
[50:28] then i went went to got another degree
[50:30] and he said i got degrees and plastered
[50:31] the wall he said but i'm not even closer
[50:33] to god he said i went to this
[50:35] denomination they told me try this do
[50:37] this do this do this he said he's i
[50:39] haven't found any i've ever gone in any
[50:40] of it he said i've not been satisfied in
[50:42] any of it and he said what is it he said
[50:45] when you come and re it's it's finding
[50:47] god not just a bunch of rules and
[50:48] regulations not just not just
[50:50] imagination but when you find him
[50:54] find god that's right
[50:57] see then the brother began to point him
[50:59] back to the word and see this is where
[51:00] you look
[51:02] why because organizations it's like well
[51:04] you know you you can't know god until
[51:06] you got a t go to college
[51:09] no you need to get down on your knees
[51:10] you need to get an altar and pray
[51:12] through until you find him why because
[51:14] he's not found in a book
[51:18] well because there's many people that
[51:19] have that are intellectually i mean
[51:22] intellectually smart but i mean but
[51:24] devoid of the spirit
[51:26] one because they've they've read they've
[51:28] read the books they know the bible
[51:30] backwards and forth and even people
[51:31] that's read this message they've read
[51:33] every single book they can quote it tell
[51:35] you backwards and forwards and argue
[51:37] about it and not have not have one no
[51:39] one iota of the spirit of god dwelling
[51:42] in them
[51:44] why because that it's not by learning
[51:46] but it's by yielding yourself to the
[51:48] spirit and praying through and letting
[51:51] god
[51:52] lead you
[51:54] it's because he's going to lead you
[51:56] through it's not you trying to find it
[52:01] you know everybody's trying to find
[52:02] rapturing faith well for our afternoon
[52:04] faith lays in the books and the tapes
[52:06] but it's not trying to find a certain
[52:08] message that brother branham preached
[52:10] but it's finding him in the message
[52:14] just like brother branham said he said
[52:15] if you hadn't found christ in every
[52:17] verse then go back and read it again
[52:19] because you've missed it and that's what
[52:21] it is it's it's him in the scripture
[52:24] because he said hello i come in the
[52:25] volume of it so it's not him trying to
[52:27] find one little we got to find one
[52:29] little word we got to find one little
[52:31] phrase
[52:32] one little scripture
[52:34] no it's finally taking all of it
[52:37] it's all that's there
[52:40] all of it in the scripture
[52:42] and then you can find it
[52:48] because you know there's many people
[52:49] that you know they they like their
[52:50] certain quotes and
[52:54] but where is it when you when you take
[52:55] that when you only take certain parts of
[52:57] the word and you read certain quotes but
[52:59] you don't but you look at other parts of
[53:01] the message and it's like when brother
[53:03] branham preached it was it was it just
[53:05] brother random preaching does to be
[53:06] preaching or was there a word there that
[53:09] had to be preached for the people to
[53:11] understand
[53:12] so when people when people don't take
[53:14] the word and actually get into it and
[53:16] say well lord i don't understand this
[53:18] well we're not going to touch that
[53:20] well see that's the problem is is when
[53:22] you get to the places where where the
[53:24] devil can put up scarecrows and you're
[53:25] not going to get into that part of the
[53:26] world then how are you going to find god
[53:29] how are you going to find the fullness
[53:30] of the word when you don't even get into
[53:32] the fullness of the word amen
[53:35] anyway you know many people you know as
[53:37] as many times as
[53:39] by the way different ones brother dale's
[53:40] talked about you know
[53:43] people don't people don't even own
[53:45] you know the 70 weeks of daniel book
[53:46] never read the book
[53:50] how you know how in the world people
[53:51] people have never read the seal book
[53:53] they've never read the church age book
[53:57] and so if you've never read those things
[53:58] how are you going to
[54:00] how is the holy spirit going to lead you
[54:02] into truth to understand these things
[54:05] and people people will not stand up and
[54:07] just stand up and just raise our hands
[54:09] and say listen i don't understand
[54:11] yeah
[54:13] you know people people want to hide
[54:14] behind something and not realize just be
[54:17] real
[54:18] just be honest
[54:22] people people just don't want to be
[54:23] honest with god and stand before god and
[54:25] say listen i'm not where i ought to be
[54:29] you know people people just get up and
[54:30] say listen you know because do you
[54:32] really have the holy ghost
[54:34] do you know who jesus do you really have
[54:37] the indwelling
[54:39] or do you just live under an anointing
[54:42] and just stand up and say lord i don't
[54:44] know
[54:47] why because now's the time now is not
[54:50] the time to be relaxed or wishy-washy or
[54:53] think you got it when you don't
[54:56] but now's the time to be honest and
[54:57] forthright with god and stand up and say
[54:59] lord i don't know if i've got it or not
[55:01] amen
[55:04] we need we need to come to a place where
[55:06] people have droven down a stake when
[55:08] they when they lay down that mark and
[55:10] know that they know that they know that
[55:11] these things are true
[55:15] to know who they are
[55:18] why because this is a late hour we don't
[55:20] know but you know let me tell you what
[55:21] it's not going to be forever
[55:23] and it's going to be very soon but you
[55:25] know you better have you better have
[55:27] your uh papers in order you better have
[55:30] your seal
[55:32] you better be set to go
[55:34] because when it when it comes then you
[55:36] can say well i thought i had it
[55:40] as the scripture tells us they say lord
[55:42] then we preach and we prophesy lord he
[55:43] didn't do mighty wonderful works in your
[55:45] name
[55:46] that's
[55:48] all those things didn't matter
[55:51] didn't amount to anything why because if
[55:53] you hadn't received him
[55:57] that's what that's what really counts
[56:01] have you received the holy ghost since
[56:03] you believed have you received him
[56:06] do you know who what the holy ghost is
[56:11] do we that we need to know these things
[56:13] and it is in its big and it's uh
[56:17] it's beco on us
[56:20] it it behooves us it is it is our
[56:22] commission our uh commandment
[56:26] to make sure that people know these
[56:28] things
[56:29] to stand up and to be the ones that call
[56:32] it and say listen these are the things
[56:34] that you know that you should know to
[56:36] understand these are the things that you
[56:38] need to make sure that you have the holy
[56:39] ghost
[56:41] not just not just some man-made idea or
[56:44] what you think or some sensation but to
[56:46] actually know who jesus christ is
[56:49] when people when people don't even
[56:50] believe that you have to have
[56:52] justification sanctification and the
[56:54] baptism of the holy ghost to be born
[56:56] again well people don't even understand
[56:59] what what brother branham said about the
[57:01] new birth
[57:03] there's a lot of people that have
[57:04] sympathized with it and a lot of people
[57:07] mentally agree with it but the thing is
[57:09] is they've not actually come to a place
[57:10] where they've actually been settled in
[57:12] the word that they've actually had a
[57:14] born-again experience
[57:16] and when and so now it's a time that
[57:19] people need to know these things and
[57:21] it's you and it's you and i our job to
[57:23] make sure that people know that
[57:25] you know
[57:26] you know only god can do the work but
[57:28] you know it's as you and i we have to be
[57:30] as if god has called us to be the
[57:32] priesthood to be the ones that we've got
[57:35] to do the ones that are that are
[57:36] interceding for people to make sure that
[57:38] they know god has called us to that
[57:44] to hold to hold the standard to hold the
[57:46] truth to let people know
[57:56] see
[57:59] god has called us
[58:01] to be an enter to be a priesthood to be
[58:04] and to be intercessors
[58:08] not only to offer the sacrifices to god
[58:11] but to be an intercessor
[58:14] and you know i i think of so many that
[58:18] you know that that
[58:19] when you have to
[58:21] you know share with people
[58:25] you know
[58:27] you have to live the life
[58:31] you know everything to everything that
[58:32] we do everything that we say ought to be
[58:34] ought to be living the life before
[58:36] people
[58:38] you know to to you know to
[58:41] because you never know what what
[58:43] your what words you're going to what
[58:45] position that you're going to be in
[58:48] to be the one to reach somebody
[58:50] that's right
[58:52] you know many times people people they
[58:54] they they look at things as being so
[58:56] insignificant
[58:58] but you know many times people don't
[58:59] realize the
[59:01] the uh
[59:03] it takes it it only takes you know the
[59:04] one
[59:06] significant moment in people's lives
[59:08] that many times people look as as
[59:10] uninsignificant
[59:13] but that is that that meant something to
[59:15] somebody
[59:18] yeah i i was thinking about
[59:20] dwight moody there and that lady
[59:23] you know god laid it upon her heart
[59:26] to rent out that livery stable or
[59:27] whatever and you know she got it all set
[59:29] and had an evangelist come and she was
[59:32] going to have a meeting and nobody shows
[59:34] up
[59:36] but you know some some dirty stringy
[59:38] head little boy comes into that meeting
[59:43] and in that in that meeting that man
[59:45] preaching the word to him catches it and
[59:47] god calls him and and he receives christ
[59:50] that night and becomes saved
[59:53] now everybody else like why did she
[59:55] waste her time
[59:57] there's an insignificant about you know
[1:00:00] what really took place there
[1:00:03] but brother ram said see nobody sees on
[1:00:05] the other side what was taking place
[1:00:07] there that that that that woman
[1:00:10] following the leading of the holy ghost
[1:00:12] to do that led dwight moody to christ
[1:00:15] and then he was able to lead a million
[1:00:17] souls to the lord and you know what she
[1:00:19] is she is honored and she is credited
[1:00:22] with that because she done that but it
[1:00:24] looks so insignificant to people but
[1:00:26] they didn't realize that that in this in
[1:00:29] that moment that was god
[1:00:32] reaching the world
[1:00:34] absolutely and many people you know they
[1:00:37] you know what what is it you know we see
[1:00:39] things in our lives and and we think
[1:00:40] well that you know it's it's
[1:00:42] insignificant or in it you know it
[1:00:44] doesn't really amount to anything and
[1:00:46] many times we look at things in our
[1:00:48] lives and we're trying to uh find
[1:00:51] significance or things you know what are
[1:00:53] we actually doing are we actually trying
[1:00:55] to reach out and touch somebody are we
[1:00:56] actually doing what god wants us to do
[1:01:00] you know i was i was i was thinking
[1:01:02] about brother
[1:01:03] uh andrew glover when he was here and
[1:01:05] you know he was talking about being in
[1:01:07] india that time and you know he's he
[1:01:09] said there and you know he was there
[1:01:11] they're preaching and and the spirit of
[1:01:12] the lord's moving and then he had the
[1:01:14] the ministers were on the platform that
[1:01:16] time and you know he just turned to him
[1:01:17] and said preach the gospel
[1:01:19] just preach he said no matter if you're
[1:01:20] just in your house or you know if it
[1:01:22] looks insignificant he said just preach
[1:01:24] the gospel you know do it he said it
[1:01:26] because it's for god and you know he
[1:01:28] just kept exhorting the preachers and he
[1:01:30] said when the meeting was over he said
[1:01:32] this brother came up to him and you know
[1:01:34] he come up and hugged him and he said he
[1:01:36] said you know he said i didn't
[1:01:37] understand their language and they
[1:01:38] didn't understand mine
[1:01:40] but they had to have interpreters but
[1:01:42] that man come up to brother andrew and
[1:01:43] told him he said he said i was about
[1:01:45] ready to give up
[1:01:46] he said i was about ready to give up he
[1:01:48] said you know we i've been pastoring a
[1:01:50] little little work and you know i guess
[1:01:52] nothing was going on and i guess he was
[1:01:54] meeting in his house or whatever and all
[1:01:55] these things and it was just so
[1:01:56] insignificant that he thought he didn't
[1:01:58] mean anything
[1:02:00] but you know what it meant something to
[1:02:01] god whatever he was doing there was some
[1:02:04] kind of
[1:02:04] work that was taking place that he
[1:02:06] couldn't see but it was something that
[1:02:08] that when he was so discouraged that
[1:02:10] brother andrew was able to give him the
[1:02:12] word of encouragement keep going brother
[1:02:15] keep going
[1:02:16] keep going because god has a work for
[1:02:18] you to do whatever it is
[1:02:20] when because you know so we we don't
[1:02:22] always see what god has in store but we
[1:02:24] know that god has called us to these
[1:02:26] things whatever it is god has called us
[1:02:28] to do it you know brother branham said
[1:02:30] one time he said you know god has called
[1:02:33] us to do these things and he said all he
[1:02:34] wants us to do is make an effort
[1:02:37] to make an effort
[1:02:40] you know many people they want to sit
[1:02:42] back and and you know they want to
[1:02:43] wonder if you know should i do this or
[1:02:46] should i do that he said well check it
[1:02:48] by the word
[1:02:51] you know people you know they you know
[1:02:53] they're so afraid of doing things
[1:02:56] that you know and it's so but check it
[1:02:58] by the word
[1:03:00] if god's called you to do something you
[1:03:02] know you're never going to be happy
[1:03:04] until you do it
[1:03:06] you know what you're never going to be
[1:03:07] in the place that you never be fulfilled
[1:03:09] you never be in the right place until
[1:03:11] god till you do what god has for you to
[1:03:12] do he's called you to do something then
[1:03:15] you do it
[1:03:18] how many people you know they struggle
[1:03:19] and wonder well what should i or should
[1:03:21] i not or these things and you know they
[1:03:23] allow the devil to beat on them
[1:03:28] you know and you know you think about
[1:03:30] well you know
[1:03:32] there was peter that day standing in the
[1:03:34] boat and you know everybody else was
[1:03:36] afraid of what was going to take place
[1:03:38] in the storm and all these things but
[1:03:39] you know what jesus came walking on the
[1:03:41] sea
[1:03:44] became walking in the storm that day and
[1:03:46] there he was standing and you know when
[1:03:48] all of them were they were the
[1:03:50] scriptures said they were afraid and
[1:03:51] they thought it was a ghost and all that
[1:03:52] but you know what peter said lord if
[1:03:54] that be you then bid me to come
[1:03:59] and he said come
[1:04:03] now what kind of person in their right
[1:04:04] mind is going to step out a perfectly
[1:04:06] good boat in the middle of a storm
[1:04:10] it ain't this fella
[1:04:15] i was born at night but it wasn't last
[1:04:17] night
[1:04:20] but you know i you know but you know
[1:04:21] what there was something inside of peter
[1:04:23] that rose up that you know that that
[1:04:24] activated his faith
[1:04:27] that he said the lord he said if that
[1:04:28] means
[1:04:29] if that be you bid me to come and he
[1:04:31] said come
[1:04:34] well you know here's here's this man
[1:04:36] perfectly you think he was perfectly
[1:04:38] normal i don't know how normal he was
[1:04:40] but you know he just stepped over that
[1:04:41] edge one because he had confidence in
[1:04:43] who that was
[1:04:46] and now he knew and he had confidence in
[1:04:48] who that was that he stepped right out
[1:04:50] of that boat and began to walk on the
[1:04:51] water
[1:04:54] but you know what as long as he had his
[1:04:55] eyes on jesus you know what he could
[1:04:57] walk on the water because that's exactly
[1:04:59] what god called him to do jesus told him
[1:05:02] come
[1:05:04] that he could that he could do the
[1:05:06] impossible
[1:05:08] but god called him to do that that he
[1:05:10] could walk out there and do that he
[1:05:12] could walk in the water
[1:05:14] but until he got his eyes off of god off
[1:05:16] of jesus then he began to sink
[1:05:21] and you know jesus jesus said well peter
[1:05:24] why did you doubt
[1:05:27] you were doing good
[1:05:31] you wanted to do this and you know what
[1:05:33] i led you
[1:05:34] i called you and you know what you're
[1:05:36] walking
[1:05:38] but what did you doubt
[1:05:44] and if god has called you to do
[1:05:46] something
[1:05:50] then you know we need we need to narrow
[1:05:52] i mean we need to nail it down
[1:05:57] you know if god you know because people
[1:06:00] well i don't know if i should do this or
[1:06:01] that or
[1:06:04] but you know what if check it by the
[1:06:06] word
[1:06:08] that's right
[1:06:09] and then brother i said check it by the
[1:06:10] word and if it's worth the word then do
[1:06:13] it
[1:06:15] to go with it
[1:06:18] say lord i'm i'm going to do this
[1:06:22] by by your faith
[1:06:29] you know peter's standing there in the
[1:06:30] boat and and jesus begins to speak to
[1:06:33] him that day and he's like what have you
[1:06:35] called anything
[1:06:36] no
[1:06:39] no we fished all night got nothing
[1:06:42] he's like well just cast your net on the
[1:06:45] other side
[1:06:50] and peter's there and said lord
[1:06:53] i was born on the sea i grew up out here
[1:06:56] that's all i've ever done my entire life
[1:06:59] is fish
[1:07:01] and i know that there's no fish in here
[1:07:05] we've been doing it all night i've been
[1:07:06] doing it all my life i know
[1:07:11] but he said that thy word lord i'm gonna
[1:07:13] throw the net in
[1:07:17] and you know what they almost they
[1:07:18] almost lost the nets because they were
[1:07:20] trying to pull in all the fish
[1:07:25] and many times we get the same thing
[1:07:26] well lord i know this ain't going to
[1:07:28] change
[1:07:32] lord we've been around this mountain
[1:07:33] over and over lord we've done these
[1:07:36] things
[1:07:37] and you know what ain't nothing changed
[1:07:42] but you know what you keep doing it
[1:07:45] amen because you know what at thy word
[1:07:48] lord i'm going to do it
[1:07:51] when everything goes wrong he said do it
[1:07:53] anyhow
[1:07:55] just keep doing it
[1:07:57] just follow the word just do what god
[1:07:59] tells you to do
[1:08:02] so many times because when when god has
[1:08:05] called you to do something then do
[1:08:08] it and don't and don't get wrapped up on
[1:08:12] the things that you see in the things
[1:08:13] that you don't see
[1:08:15] if god has called us to to be a
[1:08:18] priesthood
[1:08:20] a royal priest a peculiar people
[1:08:23] then if we're called to do these things
[1:08:24] then you know what we do things that
[1:08:26] people don't understand
[1:08:29] but you know what if god has called us
[1:08:31] to do these things to be a royal
[1:08:33] priesthood then you know what we stand
[1:08:36] up and we claim our families
[1:08:40] we claim our loved ones
[1:08:42] and it doesn't matter how things fall
[1:08:44] apart you know what but at thy word lord
[1:08:47] i'm going to continue to do it
[1:08:48] when everything falls apart but thy word
[1:08:51] lord i'm still going to do it
[1:08:53] why because i'm not going to look at the
[1:08:55] things that i see but i'm going to look
[1:08:57] at the word
[1:08:58] because this is where i'm going to stand
[1:09:02] god has called us to do something so
[1:09:04] that's what god wants us to do
[1:09:07] you know many times people trying to
[1:09:10] you know i was i was
[1:09:12] listening to this this man he's a
[1:09:14] i forgot what his name is but he's a
[1:09:17] international soccer star he's made all
[1:09:19] this money and everything but you know
[1:09:20] his dad put something in him about
[1:09:23] playing soccer
[1:09:25] and you know that's all he wanted to do
[1:09:27] you know he said dad listen one of these
[1:09:28] days
[1:09:29] he said he said we're going to have all
[1:09:31] this money we'll have all these things
[1:09:33] all these great things in this world
[1:09:35] but you know his dad told him he said he
[1:09:37] said we'll not have them
[1:09:40] but he said i want you to go after your
[1:09:42] dreams
[1:09:43] i'm gonna instill in it to you to go
[1:09:45] after your dreams i want you to fulfill
[1:09:48] your dreams
[1:09:50] and you know that's that's what he does
[1:09:51] and he said today
[1:09:53] he said all the things that my dad and i
[1:09:55] talked about those days
[1:09:58] when we were we were
[1:09:59] poor we were in poverty
[1:10:03] and all the things that we had to face
[1:10:05] and all the things we all the struggles
[1:10:06] we went through he said i've got
[1:10:08] everything
[1:10:10] that i wanted
[1:10:13] he said but i don't have my dad
[1:10:17] he said why because he said i didn't
[1:10:19] understand what dad was trying to tell
[1:10:20] me
[1:10:22] but dad kept telling me he said listen
[1:10:24] go after your dreams but he said you
[1:10:26] won't have we won't share them he said i
[1:10:30] don't understand but he said no i see
[1:10:31] that dad was trying to tell me he said
[1:10:33] go after him because you know i may not
[1:10:34] be here
[1:10:36] and you know we see things and and what
[1:10:39] struck me about that is you know
[1:10:41] as parents our our obligation is not
[1:10:45] just to feed and clothe them and educate
[1:10:47] them but we ought to get them so full of
[1:10:49] the holy ghost it's our job to to apply
[1:10:52] the token it's our it's our job to fill
[1:10:55] them full of the word
[1:10:58] her job is instilling them the values
[1:11:01] and the word of god so that god can do a
[1:11:03] work in their lives well it's our job to
[1:11:06] show them what a what a true overcoming
[1:11:08] life is
[1:11:10] all right that's our job well you know
[1:11:12] people people want to you know you you
[1:11:14] can try to educate them and and have
[1:11:17] them in all kinds of sports and
[1:11:18] activities and all kind of things like
[1:11:20] that no well and there's nothing wrong
[1:11:22] with any of those things but if we're
[1:11:24] not instilled in them the love of god if
[1:11:27] we're not instilled in the word of god
[1:11:29] then all of the rest of it is moot
[1:11:31] then you know there's nothing to any of
[1:11:33] that then when you share with them and
[1:11:35] under to be the ones that stand there
[1:11:37] and hold a standard before our children
[1:11:39] that they know what right and wrong is
[1:11:44] the scripture tells us he said to train
[1:11:46] up a child in the way it should go he
[1:11:48] said and when they're old he said they
[1:11:50] won't depart from it
[1:11:52] well then you know what then we can
[1:11:53] stand firm on that why because god give
[1:11:55] us our children and you know what and it
[1:11:57] and so they're the heritage of god and
[1:11:59] you know what the devil can't put his
[1:12:01] hands on them
[1:12:02] why because that's our job to stand
[1:12:04] there and do that
[1:12:08] you know and
[1:12:10] there's so many times i was thinking
[1:12:11] about today that you know there's people
[1:12:15] you know
[1:12:16] just like my grandmother and different
[1:12:18] ones you know they didn't they never got
[1:12:19] to see
[1:12:23] you know i mean
[1:12:24] you think about all the times you know
[1:12:26] i i was out in the world and doing all
[1:12:28] kinds of stuff but i knew there was one
[1:12:30] thing grandma was praying for me
[1:12:33] and she was only a phone call away
[1:12:38] but you know what she never got to see
[1:12:40] any of those things
[1:12:42] you know she prayed for her children she
[1:12:44] prayed for her grandchildren but you
[1:12:45] know what she never got to see any of
[1:12:46] those things
[1:12:48] but you know what god never forgot any
[1:12:49] of her prayers
[1:12:51] you know god never forgot any of the
[1:12:53] faith that she had that she claimed us
[1:12:56] that she believed that stood that stood
[1:12:58] for us when we were out in the world we
[1:13:00] had nobody
[1:13:01] but somebody was standing for us
[1:13:04] they interceded for us
[1:13:06] and brothers and sisters it's our job to
[1:13:08] intercede for them
[1:13:10] to stand up and claim claim what god has
[1:13:13] given us our god-given rights
[1:13:21] as
[1:13:22] a royal seat of abraham
[1:13:26] when when lot was taken by the by the
[1:13:29] kings and they were hauled off
[1:13:33] you know abraham didn't stand there and
[1:13:34] say oh what we going to do
[1:13:37] well lord what we going to do there are
[1:13:39] 6 kings down there and there's only 318
[1:13:41] of us
[1:13:46] well he didn't get he didn't get worried
[1:13:47] he didn't get concerned about it
[1:13:50] why because he knew who he was he had he
[1:13:53] had confidence in who god was and who he
[1:13:56] was and his relationship with god
[1:13:59] and he said you know what he said that's
[1:14:00] my brother
[1:14:02] and he said you know what i'm going
[1:14:04] after him
[1:14:06] i'm not i'm not backing up i'm not going
[1:14:08] to be concerned am i going to be worried
[1:14:10] why because god's in control
[1:14:12] and his brothers and sisters it knows
[1:14:14] those that have fallen and whatever it
[1:14:16] is it says the scripture tells us it's
[1:14:18] our job to restore them
[1:14:22] not to browbeat them and you know and
[1:14:24] and rebuke them and everything like that
[1:14:25] but it's to go after them
[1:14:30] we do that in a in a spirit of love in
[1:14:32] the spirit of christ
[1:14:38] those that have walked away
[1:14:39] those that have backslid whatever you
[1:14:41] know what we still claim them as long as
[1:14:43] they've got breath in their body then
[1:14:45] god can do something for them i'm not
[1:14:47] give up on anybody
[1:14:51] why because that's what god has called
[1:14:53] god has given us that
[1:14:54] that is our heritage that is our
[1:14:56] blessing
[1:14:58] was what god has given us god has called
[1:15:00] us to this
[1:15:02] so brothers sisters god has blessed us
[1:15:04] with these blessings with these gifts
[1:15:07] and it's you and i our job is to is to
[1:15:10] use them
[1:15:11] whatever whatever god has called you to
[1:15:13] be then then be the best that you can be
[1:15:19] we all we you know y'all we all can't
[1:15:21] preach and and uh you know not everybody
[1:15:24] can sing but you know everybody can pray
[1:15:28] but god has called each one of us to to
[1:15:30] a job to know what to do our part
[1:15:34] to know wherever wherever we go whatever
[1:15:37] we do god you know people will see jesus
[1:15:39] christ in you
[1:15:42] that we are the ones that are going
[1:15:44] because
[1:15:46] we're god's hands we're god's eyes we're
[1:15:49] the only ones we're the living epistles
[1:15:55] the script brother rem said that
[1:15:57] don't let the bride
[1:15:58] be in the blood
[1:16:01] see we're the ones that are able
[1:16:03] to reach
[1:16:04] out and touch people
[1:16:07] and help people
[1:16:10] just just think about being able to be
[1:16:12] the one
[1:16:17] you know all the all the things
[1:16:19] because there there's a day
[1:16:21] and you know
[1:16:23] you give a cup of water
[1:16:27] when he said when he said you when
[1:16:28] you've done it under the least of these
[1:16:32] he said i was hungry
[1:16:34] i was thirsty
[1:16:36] i was naked i was in prison
[1:16:40] and they said lord when do we help you
[1:16:41] when do when do we do all these things
[1:16:44] he said he said when you've done it
[1:16:46] under the least of these my children
[1:16:49] he said you've done it unto me
[1:16:52] just just think about the ones that of
[1:16:54] all the people in this world
[1:16:58] people changing people's tires
[1:17:02] people give
[1:17:04] you know people give gifts
[1:17:06] money monetary things they've done all
[1:17:08] kinds of things for people
[1:17:12] when when when there was nobody
[1:17:14] else whatever whatever the issue was is
[1:17:17] people has come along and helped them
[1:17:19] out
[1:17:21] give them whatever they had need of
[1:17:25] and it's like
[1:17:27] when they when they done all these
[1:17:29] different things that people talk about
[1:17:33] and then all of a sudden you know
[1:17:34] there's coming a day
[1:17:37] that god's going to remember those
[1:17:38] things
[1:17:41] that you and
[1:17:42] i are the ones that are able to bless
[1:17:46] people
[1:17:47] somebody somebody's able to do something
[1:17:49] to bless you
[1:17:52] when when
[1:17:53] god was speaking to abraham
[1:17:57] he said in you
[1:18:00] all the nations of the world be blessed
[1:18:04] that's that's an amazing thing to stand
[1:18:06] there and say in the in
[1:18:08] and and me all the nations of the world
[1:18:10] are blessed
[1:18:12] you know when you think about what you
[1:18:14] are and who you are
[1:18:18] you know malachi 4 tells us that that he
[1:18:20] would send elijah
[1:18:23] before the great and dreadful day of the
[1:18:24] lord
[1:18:26] and he said he'd turn the hearts of the
[1:18:28] children
[1:18:29] and followers to the children
[1:18:32] but yo
[1:18:34] he said lest i come and smite the earth
[1:18:35] with a curse
[1:18:40] so the fathers to the children and the
[1:18:43] heart of the children to the fathers
[1:18:46] lest i come and smite the earth with a
[1:18:47] curse
[1:18:50] you know it's it's an amazing thing
[1:18:52] sometimes could you imagine getting up
[1:18:53] in the morning and people say
[1:18:55] who are you and and
[1:18:57] what are you doing
[1:18:58] oh i'm here to keep the earth from being
[1:19:01] cursed
[1:19:03] because he said if it didn't come the
[1:19:04] earth would be cursed so that's what i'm
[1:19:06] doing
[1:19:10] and sometimes we go well that's that's
[1:19:12] kind of carnal
[1:19:14] but you know that's that's what god has
[1:19:16] done because through him blessing us
[1:19:19] the earth is blessed
[1:19:21] the all the nations of the earth are
[1:19:23] blessed because
[1:19:25] you and i have fulfilled the word
[1:19:28] god has fulfilled his word in us
[1:19:31] that you and i have come to that place
[1:19:35] so when we stand up and say well i i
[1:19:37] don't i don't know what to do i'm
[1:19:39] insignificant
[1:19:41] no you're more significant than you
[1:19:42] think you are
[1:19:45] god has called us to this place
[1:19:48] recognize who you are and what you do
[1:19:51] what you can do

[1:19:56] she can do the greater works
[1:19:59] you can do these things god called you
[1:20:02] to it
[1:20:04] said then we'll be an invincible army
[1:20:07] then
[1:20:08] the rapture will go amen amen god bless
[1:20:10] you now let's all stand we'll have the
[1:20:12] musicians to come

[1:20:31] that we do amen
[1:20:37] i want the world
[1:20:39] to know there's a savior the world
[1:20:42] i want the world to know
[1:20:45] that the word is right the bible is
[1:20:47] right
[1:20:50] because you know
[1:20:51] when people can argue over the scripture
[1:20:53] but when they see it living
[1:20:57] you can't argue with that
[1:20:59] you know they want to argue with with
[1:21:01] jesus and and the different ones
[1:21:04] about lazarus
[1:21:06] but you know lazarus died and you know
[1:21:08] everyone up knew it
[1:21:10] there wasn't nobody that didn't know
[1:21:11] lazarus was dead
[1:21:13] but you know what they wanted to kill
[1:21:15] jesus when they because they couldn't
[1:21:16] argue with the fact that jesus raised
[1:21:18] from the jesus raised him from the dead
[1:21:20] they couldn't argue with that
[1:21:23] well they wanted to kill jesus when he
[1:21:24] saw that but you know they couldn't
[1:21:26] argue with the fact of what had taken
[1:21:28] place
[1:21:30] and many believed on him because of that
[1:21:34] so that's our job to be
[1:21:36] the living word
