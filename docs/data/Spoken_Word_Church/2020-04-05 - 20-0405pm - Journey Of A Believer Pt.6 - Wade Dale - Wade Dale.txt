holy holy holy I want to see you hey man god bless you in the name of the Lord I say turn around shake somebody's hand but change those do that no more I think brothers like gonna tell us about his dream he had so come right on up here I know you got to be instant in season that was season buddy come on up here tell him all right so uh I wasn't really planning on doing this but guess so a couple nights ago I had this dream and I didn't really think of it being spiritual at the time but in my dream I was at this big table is this long table filled with food it was really good food just like anything you can think of pretty much like I'm just like a Thanksgiving dinner pretty much just really good quality food and I had a plate before me and I was just putting food on my plate as much as I could possibly eat and I just started eating it and eating and I was sitting there for what felt like in my dream to be like hours hours of just eating and I couldn't get enough I was just I realized I looked down on my stomach and I was like where does all this food going I was like I don't even know where it's going and I was just like but I can't I can't stop eating and I just wasn't I was just continuously hungry and my hunger wasn't going away and I didn't want to stop eating and the food was just so good and I was just sitting there like I can't stop like this is just amazing all this food it's so good and so yeah then my dream stopped but I was just yeah it was just a dream about me eating continuously then I told my mom later on and she was like wow that sounds spiritual and I was like you know what it does I didn't really think about that before and then I told my dad about it and he said the same thing but uh yeah anyway yeah young man don't see dreams the old man whatever it is he's young man so let's stand to our feet and turn me on turn that back off there we go all right let's go to Galatians three by way of announcements a couple of things number one let's remember our nurses of this church here they're on the front lines and also the doctors and the nurses and doctors around the country they're fighting a battle just like if it was a warfare and it's there staring death in the face every day so so we want to to pray for them and also pray for pray for the people that are running the country I mean that the Bible tells us to pray for the people there in position of power so let's don't degrade them and downgrade them and I wish I wish one time Trump would have them idiot reporters stand up therefore he was standing and let them tell the country how they would want it run right so the best thing to do is just all stick together pray for the people that are trying to you know they're in power so we need to pray for him and pray that they'll make the right decision I I was reading in Leviticus and we've said it many times but that's the way my prayer ends every day as Lord stay this thing there was a plague went through the land many times when the people weren't doing what they were supposed to do and God was send to plague through or he would send snakes through to bite them and because of the sin of the people but then Moses having grace for the people he said Aaron grab your sensor and run through the crowd to stay the to stay the the plague but by the time Aaron would get out there they would be in one instance there were six thousand people killed and in one instance there was twenty thousand people killed so there's what I'm saying is this we can you say well your prayers not doing any good people are still dying well we're praying that God somewhere down the line is gonna stay this thing so that L the numbers will start going down and the people with dead they're human beings and they're dying alone I mean there's nobody there to be with them no family member the poor nurses and doctors are having to stand there while they're taking their last breath Satan's an evil person so we need to pray that that God will stay this thing pray that we'll get back to our normal C or something like normalcy don't know if that's gonna ever be the same anymore but it's like me and brother Brad Powell was talking last night this this is setting in motion a lot of things that we would have never thought of before so this is setting in motion some things that can come later down the line they're making things that what's going to happen later on down the road that's going to affect us so we pray now that that now though Lord stay those deaths state don't don't let don't let the people die like they're saying now one in two million people in the world may die before this thing is over with so let's just pray that God will stay that because they're like I said they're human beings they're your neighbors they're you know we hadn't had any hasn't had any deaths locally and we thank God for that there was a few hundred cases in Hall County but there's zero deaths three in Banks County and different surrounding counties so we're not being hit hard but New York six hundred people died yesterday just of the virus so we want to really pray for those people and keep them in our hearts it's a solemn time but like brother Dale said is this an exciting time because we've already read about this we got we don't need a newspaper we've already been told what's gonna happen we just haven't been told kind of like Abraham with God God told Abram he was going to have a promise son but you really didn't tell I was gonna do it until he got further into the journey and then when he become Abraham and become more intimate with God and our walk with God in our new birth then God started talking intimately to Abraham and said hey you're gonna have the promised son you're gonna have it and just within the time of life and you're gonna have it with Sarah not Sarah and Hagar so the way that's what God's been doing now since the Prophet left I believe he's turning all of our attention Abraham and telling us exactly how it's gonna be done all right so let's look in the journey still of a believer in part six good to be in a house reward good to have everybody with us in Galatians 3 verse 16 but let's bow our heads and pray - if you want next Sunday if we do if it does come that we're going to do this in the parking lot if you need your CDs or anything like that you need to let us know Richards runs some but not a lot but you should be all watching online and it will be still online if you want to watch it again but next Sunday we'll have to really be careful so we'll be giving more detail of what we need you to do in the coming days if we do have it in the parking lot we're going to try to do it for brother Dale kind of stands up on a platform at the pecan tree and then you can park around him and then we're gonna try to get FM transmitter to go into your car so that we don't have to blast it all over the place but it'll go straight into your car and you can listen and keep your social distance thing if you need to go to the restroom one at a time and we're gonna find out if y'all really need to go to the bathroom now brother Dale gets that temp Reese it's about an hour and a half and nobody goes the bathroom guess what's gonna happen when y'all come back in here we're gonna expect the same thing so I've always said you can sit for two hours and watch a movie and never never think about going the bathroom but once you get in here about every five minutes you really need you have to go the bathroom anyway god bless you let's go to Galatians but and all of our dates of our Spring Fling probably is not going to happen the party for brother Dale is probably not going to happen at the moment we'll just postpone it until they begin to release and our prayers you know prayers and doing the right thing and don't provoke God don't provoke God and try to go out like I said we need we have faith we have faith but when you reach your hand in the oven you have an oven mitt on because God give you sense enough to use it and we don't go stand out in the middle of the road and say God's gonna take care of me we'll be doing your funeral probably but faith to me faith is right now it's kind of is a momentary thing if there was a child run out in the road or if you did have somebody fall in the fire you could reach in and grab them out of the fire and nobody would be hurt to me that's faith that what you're doing that God will protect you the same way with being on the highway you know people get killed on a highway all the time how many miles have we run for years and never even had an accident never even had a anything close to being real severe on the highway so God's took care of us and I believe he will continue to take care of us in this journey that we're on we're getting ready to get to the end of the journey but we've still got a journey to go to so let's remember also the Bur little bride around the world it's having to do the same identical thing and some people are not fortunate enough to have live streaming so maybe they're streaming in with us or brother Donnie or some of the ones so we thank God for the technology you were able to do this let's bow our heads do Heavenly Father thank you for this day that we're in and not just a 24-hour day the day of the Lord this is the day of the bride Lord for us to be made manifest so I pray Lord that our prayers that are going up to you around the world Lord that we're all in one heart and one mind now that we need to get back in service Lord I I truly Lord I I'm sorry but I'm going to say this I truly can't see how somebody can sit at home I just don't see how you can sit at home all the time and not have communion with your brothers and sisters in a house of prayer in a house of worship Lord we are we're fulfilling the Bible when we come together and congregate Lord around you Lord I pray that you'd stay this plague Lord that those death rates will start going down Lord them that you'll give man wisdom as we were watching what brother branham said about jonas salk in the vaccine that he came up with that that the Lord would have a hand in that lord I pray that you have a hand in this one Lord that you'll stay this thing father and it'll it'll go away from us and we will Lord be back whole again lord I pray for the country Lord that you bless the people around the world also too Lord the leaders and everything they're doing the best they can lord I pray that you would just give them wisdom in how to deal with this Lord we pray also for us here as a church family Lord the ones that are having to sit at home and listen and and watch in Lord we pray this you'd give them supernatural strength Lord keep this so virus away from us and all the other things that beset the old human body Lord we pray that you just keep us safe father but you did give us wisdom to use Lord to do the things that we're supposed to do Lord and not provoke you Lord to anger like they did and the children of Israel did in the wilderness Lord I prayed this you just be with us now be with the nurses and the doctors around the world Lord give them wisdom and give them a supernatural covering Lord we know they're touching something that they know is very dangerous and very very deadly Lord and they're jumping right in and and not even hesitating Lord we pray that you would just be with that group of people Lord bless your little bride around the world Lord as we meet in different places and the things that are going on Lord may you give us supernatural strength father just bless today keep us safe in Jesus name we pray amen part six journey of believers lations 3:16 says now eight to Abraham and his seed where the promises made he saith not and to seeds as of many so he's not talking about natural seed of the world he's talking about as of one seed and to thy seed which is Christ now where is Christ there's brother Dale saying this morning where's Christ Christ in you is the great mystery it was Christ in Martin Luther but Martin Luther couldn't see the revelation of the Son of Man that somebody could look him say your guardian human flesh that wasn't for that time that was for this time where we can look at each other and we can look even back in the church ages and see that it was God in human flesh but they had a revelation that was the Son of God that God the Spirit God come into them and made them Christians well we know that's for a fact now - but we go to a little bit higher level till we see that the body of Christ they were the body of Christ they believed they were a body of Christ but I think they also knew that they're looking forward to a headstone to a time when God would take over in a body of believers and make this thing get out and you know get us out of here so that's what we're looking for and this I say that the Covenant that was confirmed before God and Christ the law which was four hundred and thirty years after cannot dissin all that it shouldn't make the promise of none effect so it doesn't matter what comes on what goes the covenant god made is I will I'm going to do this and you are the bride of Jesus Christ and I am going to be with you and I'm gonna help you through this journey that's what he said to Abram because remember the promise we'll read it just a little while the promise was made under uncircumcision the problem when you started in your journey of justification if you truly were justified by God not by yourself then it was God doing the work who's gonna forgive you of your past sins no one but God Almighty can forgive you of your past sins right so it was God already making the promise when you're under uncircumcision which meant you were still out into the world doing the things of the world but God had already made a covenant amen same way with Abram for if the inheritance be by the law it's no more promise in other words do's and don'ts if you'll come if you'll do ten different things ten ten of my things then that's the promise that wasn't what the problem is he made to Abraham he said I will and you're gonna do it alright for if the inheritance be of the Lord there's no more promise but God gave it to Abraham by promise and according that look in Hebrews six verse 13 he says when God made that promise Abraham because he could swear by no greater swore by himself we didn't swear by the he swear by the he swore by itself he said in other words I will as we see in Genesis chapter 12 I will make thee a great nation I will bless thee I will bless them that bless thee I will show thee the land where you needed to go right saying surely blessing I will bless them multiplying I will multiply they so after that he had patiently endured in other words Abram had to become Abraham so there had to be a journey in there of 25 years to wait for that promise to be made they know but God gave it to Abraham by promise you can be seated in the Lord had his blessing so after he had patiently endured he obtained the promise what Abraham endured and he got Isaac all right so let's go really quick no let's read number one call the one I want to finally get to Melchizedek because that's what brother Dale was talking about that Abraham finally met he had heard God he had seen God do things he had seen lights he had seen all these different things but he's going to finally meet God face to face so brother Brown tells us right here when Abraham met him he was Melchizedek he unfolds here what all the attributes that's us will do in the final in every son of Abraham what son of the faith every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing so whatever that journey of Abram to Abraham and meeting God in human flesh you're gonna have to do the same thing you're gonna have to pattern yourself right after this we've tried to know four four five services to try to get that to you where we see that Abraham's journey is exactly the journey you got to go through exactly the journey that you got to go through you've got to go through justification you've got to go through sanctification then you've got to go through the baptism the Holy Ghost now some some go sooner some go later some takes a long time but it doesn't matter those who he is justified he has already glorified and he did not put a date in the time in between all that same way with you and I he didn't do that so I you say well sometimes you think maybe God's not not on the scene he listened before the foundation of the world he knew how long it would take you to go to each one of these so he's not gonna sit there and go no he's right there with you the whole time so he knows what day you're gonna receive the new birth he knows what day you're gonna come to this it's not a secret to him and it's really not a secret but if we believe what he's already wrote in the Bible told us the promise he give to Abram because I believe Abram being the father of our faith or Abraham the journey of Abram to Abraham is like I said it's our journey and if we we are what we're believers Abram begin his journey as a believer he's right there in the error of Chaldees he's got a real good job he's he's making good money he's right there with us daddy he's doing good he probably lives right there next door to his job and everything's going well and all of a sudden abram walks in and tells sarah which is a little contentious you know member sarah means contentious so he walks in he says Sarah we're leaving oh why we we run out of idols or what you know she I'm sure she questions as a human being but Abram believed what God said it and like I said before he could have he could have spoken to thousands of people but Abram is the only one that God knew would take this and take that journey all the way to the very end amen same way with with Mary there was many virgins probably at that time million more millions virgins than they are now but there was a virgin called Mary that that Gabriel came to and said how you're highly favored and she did question but she come to a point to where God you know other woman would say this be it unto me according to what you say all right so you have to come to that where we have to come to that I'll read to you in just a little while where brother brown tells us to receive the new birth is to have the faith of Abraham to believe that God can do it and then just believe that God can do it how simple is that so in Chapter 12 we see that's justification the total plan of redemption starting in Genesis chapter 12 and the Lord said unto Abram don't put this up just well I'm just gonna run through it real quick get thee out of thy country and from thy kindred because remember when you start your journey you must separate from what you were with you must if you don't separate from what you with you how Ewing world is going if he forgives you of all this past and then you keep walking with the same people for years after no you got to come out because Redemption is what coming out and going in the Bible says come out of her my people well you can say well that means us come out denominations no it means number one you got come out of the world first you got to get the world out of you first before you can get the denomination out of you go into Christ amen so now justification we see that God says and I will make of thee a great nation now remember this is Abram didn't have no kids he was thought he was still he was 70 something years old when he was right here and I will bless thee and make thy name great Abram probably he probably said thank many people know who I am what do you mean right I mean here he just appears it's kinda like Eli J lied you just appears in the Book of Kings Elijah the Tishbite nothing no like brother Branham said there's no history and the logic coming up as a young child off it just says Elijah's here and same way with a Abram Abram here in Genesis 12 after the flood I know I've been talked about all of a sudden Abram name pops up why because he did what God said and God knew he wouldn't just be what we always called a flash in the pan you know what that means that means just I mean you know you see like brother Dale says a lot of people come in here and not so much now but a long time ago a lot of people would come in and be like a house on the fire on a windy day and burn a candle at both ends well you know you burn a candle at both ends all of a sudden you get to the middle and they all run out so that's the way a lot of people are Abram was not that way but now remember Abram just didn't get up and say okay all right we're gonna take hagar sara i me and you're gonna and I'm gonna take him we're gonna go to him we two years we're done that's not the journey of a Christian right I like what Dave Ramsey said it's not a this is not a microwave religion this is a crock pot religion it's gonna take some time it's gonna take some time to get through this journey it took Abram 25 years to get the actual promise that God gave him right here in Genesis 12 but he had to have a journey but you know what a journey is that's the testimony because the testimony starts with four first four letters or te s T you got to go to a test to have a testimony all right amen so then you look in Genesis 12 13 and 14 you can just keep on going through that s okay cuz I'm not gonna read it all I got it I got to get to this end part then you see that Abram brings a lot with him something God did but you know what you're you're in your journey and you know what God knew Abram was gonna take lot he and he knows you're gonna take a lot with you you're gonna take a lot with you you're gonna carry a lot and it but now he's got to come to a day though somewhere when you continue in your journey that Lots got to go somewhere else you got to get rid of a lot all right so you get rid of a lot in your journey and you come up to a place we see justification coming until chapter 15 and in chapter 13 it's when they separate so you're gonna have to separate somewhere in your journey like I said you got to separate from the things you used to do all right because you're walking and you're walking with a purpose now that if God's justified you he's gonna glorify you so you got a you've got what a pull that's pulling you to that through gives me pulling you through that journey he's pulling you to a place that's that what he knows where you gonna get to but you don't same way with Abram Abram gets up first thing happens he gets into a little situation just like something what happened in your journey first thing comes up and here's Abram there's a famine in the land and I always told you what a family would do a famine makes you make a decision you got to decide where you gonna go you can't stay in a famine unless he should have listened to what God told him to do and stay but in other words he moved but now that would've been a lot that would have been Abram journey that would have been God's journey so you've got a journey it's your journey that you take so he knows you're going to go down into Egypt or go back into the world maybe and do some things of the world but what happened is as Abram terms right around and comes right back to Canaan where he had built an altar and and what do you do when you build an altar you make a commitment all in our journey we go and we make a commitment like when the children of Israel crossed the Red Sea what happened they put those 12 stones what to build a memorial that every time they walk by that that those twelve stones reminded them if they come out of Egypt and went across the Jordan and here's those twelve stones what it's a reminder same thing with you and I these are little reminders that you look back and and I have during this time here of doing this journey that you look back in your journeying and please don't ever think that and we all do as humans we go what we should have changed this or we should have done this different or you can't say that you can say that humanly but that wouldn't be your journey the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord and a ladies a lot of things you did that wasn't of the Lord but he knew you had to go through them so that you can have a test so that you can have a testimony drugs never wasn't my problem the only drug I ever got got drug to church yeah that was the only drug problem I had but some others man had a drug problem and you know what that's okay I said had as long as we say had it's okay we had these other problems because we had lot we had brought lot with us but now it's kind of certain time to where you gotta weigh that down or God's gonna have to get it rid of it for you like brother Tom publish would always say God take the need and the desire because you ought we all have a desire to fill it with something so we're gonna fill it with sin until we become a Christian then then we're gonna start filling it with God but until we become a Christian that's the desire is to be is to fill up with something so you fill up with drugs or alcohol or whatever you want to you know put put that in you leave it blank you put it in your journey are the things that told I have things that doesn't bother me that that bother Luis Luis has some things that and don't ever laugh and say oh that's just trivial no it's something you got to go through each and every one of them has to go through a journey and you say well that's silly it's not silly when you're going through it hey man it's not silly it wasn't silly to Abram when he was going through some of these situations he was going through no it was his journey but what did God say God said you were going to be the father of the faith of all faithful so all your journey that he didn't tell him that exactly but he laid it in the plan he laid it in that plan before the foundation the world that we're going to be talking about Abraham and and you know what brother John we're gonna get to meet that guy we're gonna get to meet that physical man called Abraham and we're not going to go you big dummy no we're gonna say thank you for going through this journey and that God thought enough for you to write it in the Bible and put your name in there and then you bar the father of the faithful we are sons of Abraham that's what brother Brent said every son of the faith will go through this journey every son of Abraham now listen we're a son of God by birth but we're a son of Abraham by faith because you got to have faith in that person you got faith in something you can't see Abram had faith in something he could not see but he believed so much as brother branham's tells us many times to where he tells Sara hey get to you know get to get the pampers ready and get to get the bibs ready and get and Sara's going or Sara contentious sara sara she's going we ain't been husband and wife in for 25 years what are you talking about he said just get it ready just get it ready cuz I'm trusting and what God's told me right all right so that's so in justification we see that we're justified let's go to Roman's 3 verse 24 being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus because remember he's the only just one you and I are not just at all but we take his justification to being justified freely by His grace through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus that starts our journey whom God has set forth to a perpetuation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness not ours for the remission of sins that are past in other words remember we we can't get forgiven or something we do two weeks from now that's Catholicism no grace is for what happened yesterday all right we're having faith for tomorrow but we're getting grace for what was yesterday because right here remission of sins that are past showing that justification gets rid of our past sins through the forbearance of God see that forbearance what is that we have forbearance with our children when they can't walk you don't want to take Elliott at two months old and expect her to run a marathon why cuz we forbear we know that in the development of a child is going to be 11 months old 12 months old she's getting closer she's over that now let months walking a little bit now see but now Danny wasn't behind her 2 months going hard if you don't if you don't walk up no he has forbearance I don't think he and I were gonna do that in any way but before but Danny had a little grim look on his face there like I can do that or not anyway that's why their grandchildren that's why God know how grant you because God could do that but God's not gonna do it at two months so what am I saying in your start of your journey your tender you're a young child and God's not gonna ever hurt your feelings so he's going to forbear and wait on you to come to a place and then when you do come to place though he's gonna finally look at you at 20 years old 20 and say you need to start walking and then he might give you a little stimulation from the backside to get you going but he forbears with each of us listen Gus never angry at us he knows what we're gonna do he knows what we're gonna do you sell on to God yeah God was angry with the children of Israel different place different ones but how can God be angry when he knows the end the reason we're angry with our kids isn't worth telling why you idiot what are you doing what you're doing it's because we don't know what the end results is gonna be y'all quit throwing it to the back there's nobody behind you but we don't know we don't know that journey but God does so he forebears the forbearance of God or what grace there's the grace of God we don't have a lot but God's got plenty of it for all of us all right to declare I say at this time his righteousness that he might be just and the justifier of him which believeth in Jesus so any all that journey of of Abram when he first got started God's not condemning him like the children of Israel they were say sin ten times but I was reading the other day and Exodus where they would goof up and and and and have all kinds of mistakes and God would come right back next ahead of the next chapter he said when you get in when you get in the Promised Land this is what I want you to do if it had been us we'd be going y'all ain't going yeah for what you just did y'all ain't going and God knew there was only two of that group was gonna go but he forbear with them trying to what give him a chance but he knew that Josh when Caleb was the only two that was going to go out of that group but still he kept going when you get in the promised land this is what I want you to do and they go are we load this bread we hate this stuff we have no water to drink they're always complaining but God just kept right on going that's the same way with Abram God didn't complain to Abram when he tried to give his wife away but he did come to a place to where he protected his promise and and he'll do the same with you you'll wonder a lot of things that happen in your in your early journey in your Christian life you wonder how these things happen and like we did me and brothers I thought you know God's nose was the best yes is if you get a no from God that's the best yes you ever got because he knows if he said if he allows you to continue on down this truck direction he knows how you gonna end up so he says no don't go that way you need to go in another direction same way with Abram Abram you needed this is the way you need to go you don't need to be going in that direction you need to go over this way all right so that's that's the guidance of God is what I that's what I want you to understand the guidance of God he always as sister Gayle says God's arm is long and it is he's got a long arm because he's got a lot of Grace and you know remember there nail-scarred hands to that he leads us in God's a spy so even in our justification we see that Abram was right in the will of God all the time doesn't matter where he went because remember he meets Melchizedek after a certain victory he meets Melchizedek but you know really I don't thinking I'm saying this for my own even in my journey that that he met Melchizedek but I don't think he fully understood who the guy was because remember here Melchizedek in verse 18 Mel because that king of Salem brought forth bread and wine because you got to remember one thing he said blessed Abram of the Most High God possessor of heaven and earth and Abram gave him tithes but you got to remember when we get over here into chapter 18 he addresses that person as my Lord you see what I mean about in your journey you mate sometimes you may not know what's God dealing with you you said well no sometimes you may not but when you come to the new birth in when you have to meet God in human flesh you know that position so Abram didn't know in the in his position of walking in justification he met God in human flesh but he didn't realize exactly who he was because he didn't say my lord he actually didn't say anything he just gave him ties you understand what I mean but so God's gonna meet you but now I believe if I believe this is what I believe when Abram was changed to Abraham and he meant Melchizedek it was the same guy he met back in justification he hadn't changed his form he was still Melchizedek and I believe Abraham that's how excited I believe Abraham got when he said I met you 25 years same guys been through this whole journey I met you 25 years ago I just didn't realize it my lord because remember brother Graham said that's interpreted and Lord God l owe him that that was Almighty God standing there well that was Almighty God back in chapter 14 but same way with me and you you meet people in your journey and you do things in your journey and you say well you know that maybe God or I just got lucky or all these things and then when you get born again though and you look back and you say that was you Lord that was you that did that it wasn't me it was you I don't I'm for one I don't believe in luck I believe in dumb luck because we make it but I don't believe that you get lucky and become a Christian ha I don't believe that I believe God's got this thing and I know he's got it all settled out where it needs to go and we just get into the plan so let's read Ezekiel 11 verse 17 let's see what this as we're going through our journey we look back in Ezekiel because look now remember Abram didn't have no book Abram had no Bible Abram had no he had nothing to go on except the voice of a man but we can look back and even a zekiel could look back to Abraham but as we look back to Ezekiel we see Ezekiel is is picking up exactly what Abram went through therefore say thus saith the Lord God I will even gather you from your people what do you do with Abraham he gathered him from the people and assembled you out of the countries that you've been scattered in in other words Abram went to all these different countries you went to all these different things that you did just put you know you you you put it in the blank things you did now look and I will give you the Land of Israel so there's a land you coming to what do you tell Abram he said wherever you walk wherever the sole of your feet is that's what I'm gonna give as a possession all right and they shall come thither and they shall take away all the detestable things thereof Abram got rid of lot got rid of all these different things had a name change and all the abominations thereof from this what you're doing during your journey what's he doing he's kicking out all the all the junk just like in the statue a perfect man even when you getting a statue a perfect man you got junk that God's gonna do the same thing I believe that I just believe that justification for those of you that is not part of the church if you're watching in justification has three parts sanctification has three parts and the baptism of Holy Ghost has three parts it's the same it's the same work but when you get justified and you get your past sins chopped off you got to start realizing that God did it that work you can't do it and that you come to a part of justification that the real you didn't do it this God did it but the guy inside you did not do that so you come to a higher realization of what God wanted you to do because remember God's forbearance his forbearance knows that we need it because he's not gonna dump it all on us at one time he didn't dump everything on brother branham he brought him right up to the journey just like he brought Abram to Abraham he brought all the he brought everyone because man if he throwed everything on top of you he knows we're human and I will give them one heart and I will put a new spirit within you and we'll get to that in a second and I will take the Stoney heart out of your flesh and we'll give them a heart of flesh what we're talking about a Stoney heart you God can't use a stony heart because it's set you know the old saying set in stone that's why it's set in stone now when we come to Revelation that set in stone but you have to start with a fleshly heart where God can use you and mold you as the Potter in justification see so he doesn't dump it all on you you got a tender heart when you first start your journey then you come a little bit further up to where you know God's right there with you like with you know everybody's sheltering little Elli and sheltering these babies and and trying to do what we're trying to mold them trying to get them going in the right direction okay but like you know Danny's not gonna give the car keys to her maybe the play with but not to get in the car and drive the truck right that's right not at the moment but when she gets 45 she'll be able to drive somebody's vehicle you see what I mean though that's what God is doing the same thing we have the potential to get the key to drive the car but God's not gonna give us the key when we're in justification he's not gonna give us the key we're in sanctification he's going to give us the key when we're at the baptism of the Holy Ghost he stones start revealing things to us that what we're gonna do is it's gonna build that stature not a statue a stature of a perfect man everybody got that say ma'am all right so let's go to chapter 15 so justification is picking you up and the bottle is still dirty but God has a purpose you don't know it yet but God does so he picks you up out of the world and you still got mud dripping here and you definitely got mud inside all right but now God is getting ready he's gonna mold that thing to where he can put clean water in there and drink it but not at that moment of justification so Abraham's not going to have the promise baby because it's really not promise to Abram it's promise to Abraham but Abram to know yet right you just a lot of thing like I said before I want us to see everybody that's in the new journey even all of us it's maybe in a new journey going up the Statue of a perfect man we must realize the same thing listen God's not gonna he's not a respecter of persons he's not gonna he always he has to go by your desires remember what brother Brown said brother Brown said God you have a desire God goes by the desires that you have all right that's the free will he gives us to do it or not do it alright so in sanctification we see though that God is gonna clean this up and empty it out of the junk but he's not gonna put it in service because it's not ready yet Abram was not ready to have the promised son because he was an Abraham God didn't tell him that Sarah he didn't tell him I mean you know he comes in with Hagar and he makes another mistake and and he goes in the permissive will of God and sometimes we do the same thing a lot of times we do the same thing but in chapter 15 the Bible says after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram in a vision so God is getting closer he's using now more says fear not Abram I am thy shield and my exceeding great reward and Abraham's Abraham's just like you and I even in our journey we cry for the new birth Amen you cry Lord when you starting this journey especially being in the I say the message say that loosely but being in the belief that we have that it takes the three processes you should know that people out in the world don't have that they just think come up shake a hand I don't I don't do this anymore I'm gonna start coming to church but I got all these little things that I'm still doing I'm not perfect you're not perfect how many times you heard that you start talking to people and you start talking about Haran you know get into the doctrinal issues and well you're not perfect neither am i you know you know what they're saying they're saying I can go ahead and smoke and do the things I do because I'm not perfect and that's not really them saying that that's the person inside cuz they ain't got the right person inside the right person inside kicks all that out like the unclean spirit and sanctification the unclean spirit goes out Abram says Lord what will they give me seeing I go childless now Abram remembers in his Christian journey that God had promised him ever how many years back that he was going to have a son and Abram and and like brother Brian said I love what brother Brian said he said God does not mind you reminding him of what he said okay God don't mind you reminding or quoting scripture back to him so Abram is quoting scripture back to God and says the Lord hello child me and Sarah Sarah have not had kids for ever how many years we've been married seeing I go childless and he keeps going through and he kind of wants to put a substitute in and sometimes we do that in our Christian journey us thing about this other day sometimes we want to put a substitute in we think this is the way it needs to be and that I'm going to go ahead and if I don't you know I think I got the new birth like I said sanctification is really hard because Satan comes and brings religious demons to you and he tries to get you to think well I'll just I'll just sit in the message church and as long as I come every once in awhile they won't miss me and and but I'm still secretly do what I've been doing before right secretly because you feel ashamed but then what does God do he if you're a real true child of God and you're in that journey he goes hey get back in get back in the promise this is your promise over here not that promise that you had out there alright so we see in st. if occation after these things the word of the Lord came to Abram and Abram said Lord God and then verse forces and behold the word of the Lord came unto him saying this shall not be thine heir God's telling him go go that way same ways that don't go that way Abram I got a promise for you believing the promise you say well that looks like Abraham didn't believe listen there's a lot of times than that we look and see it looks like Abram didn't believe but deep down inside something was pulling Abram toward that promise or he wouldn't be the father face the same way with you and I look at all the circumstances that we produce and we go why I don't think this and I don't think that but then you see that somebody like brothers I can and me being gone for 20 years and you see something pulling you and then you see the end result that you you're still doing stupid stuff but yet God's still pulling it and you know why it's God pulling you because you know what Satan will never give you the new birth Saint or never saying you're my child cuz he because you're already here's right here but God is saying come on you're my child come on come on fall down that's okay don't worry Ellie you gonna fall down I'll pick you back up and come on come on he's pulling you toward him same way with Abram even unconsciously something was pulling Abram toward this goal that God had for him because God said I will and I've attached myself to Abram now not the way even a hidden out when he attaches itself to us brothers and sisters we become born-again Christians when he really attaches itself to us we become born again he couldn't do that with Abram but he was pulling him to show what to show us here now in 2020 we're talking about this journey of this man called Abram and how that you're going I remembered that happened he's actually the same thing to me that and that exactly happened to me and this is exactly what happened to me and I see how God done this and pulled me here and I wondered why I did that and there's your example he gave you one two three thousand years ago I mean you know this is BC 1913 so that's almost four thousand years he gave us an example of a man that walked right through the journey like you and I are going through so he's getting ready to go through sanctification which is what cleaned and set aside for service not put in service but you got it he's got to clean you up first and remember he told him he said look toward the Stars and if you number them so shall thy seed blade be and look and he believed in the Lord and he God counted it to him Abram for righteousness everybody got that and he said unto him I am the Lord that brought thee out of ur what was he doing he was identifying somewhere in your journey God is gonna identify and say look you're talking to me I'm the one that did this you're talking to me I'm talking to you it's a personal thing when you come in to specially in sanctification when the unclean spirit goes out because you know what God won't dwell in an unclean vessel but now that he's cleans you up like we're gonna talk about in a minute he's going to give you a new spirit - what he's gonna give you a new spirit not the Holy Spirit he's gonna give you a new spirit so that you can coincide with what he's fixing to bring you because what he's bringing you is holy what went out of you is not he's not gonna take something holy out of you and put something holy in he's gonna take the unclean spirit out and then he's gonna put his spirit in after he gives you a new spirit in sanctification that's what we're gonna read right here let's go to Hebrews 2 because we'll get to that back in just a second Hebrews - thank you brother Anderson he's doing double-duty I think brother Richards back there helping him thank you brother Joe's at home resting a little bit he brother Joe's got a lot of hats to fulfil so we let him rest a little bit he's also getting older so is his wife so anyway Hebrews 2 verse 11 for both either sanctify and they who are sanctified are all of one he didn't say that in justification does everybody understand in justification we know God's right there but he can't touch you because he can't dwell in an unclean vessel but he can guide you but when you come to sanctification he's getting like this see because then when you get born again he's like this that's we see Abram Abram God's talking to him I just kind of doing this but all of a sudden for both he that sanctifies and daily sanctified all of one coming closer coming closer for which cause he is not ashamed to call them brethren even brother Brown tells us that sanctification you come under a religious order you start coming to church you start calling brethren brothers god bless you brother you know why cause you mean it when I used to come on Eastern Sunday I didn't mean it when I shook their hand I never said brother because they weren't they weren't my brother my brothers was the ones I left out there in the world that brothers they helped me do all the things it in Rome right but when you come in here he's not ashamed to call you brethren saying I will declare thy name unto my brethren in the midst of the church will I sing praises unto thee Ezekiel 36 verse 25 for I will take you from among the heathen now here's the same thing he's taking us he's separating Abram and gather you out of all countries and we'll bring you into your own land what is your promised land the baptism of the Holy Ghost listen we have no land grant Israel does we don't this whole world is ours but it's not promised that we get a certain spot he told Abram you get a certain spot whatever wherever you walk that's where you're gonna get that's why the new cities gonna be over there not in the United States Abram didn't walk in the United States he walked over there in Palestine in all those different places that's the land grant of the son of Abraham that they get the land that you and I don't get a land the land our promised land remember is the baptism of the Holy Ghost but now remember what does that give us that gives us heaven on earth it gives us a whole universe he gives us everything not just a little spot because you know what is that same God that said let there be his brother Dale was talking about this morning we got to connect back to that that's what we got to connect back to is that right there all right you love the Lord Ezekiel 36 verse 25 Oh take you from among the heathen get Europe gather you out of all countries and will bring you into your own land then I will sprinkle clean water on you what washing of water by the word he's getting ready to wash Abram to make him Abraham all right everybody got that all right he's got to go through some things first then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean now clean but not in service yet cleaned and set aside for service okay because we got to get this thing filled up with something that wasn't in there before the Holy Ghost clean water he's cleaning you up he's cleaning you out but he's got to fill you with something cuz watch then I will sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean from all your filthiness and all your idols the things we had idols before will I cleanse you a new heart also while I give you we know that that was in justification and a new spirit will I put within you and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh so here's Abram we're not going to go through the whole thing but we see that Abram he's doing sacrifices he's doing things here in Chapter 15 God shows him hell God shows him death God shows him all these things he said Abram you ain't got nothing to do with this you can't clean yourself up you can wash yourself with water all you won't do regular water but by the washing of the water of the word Abram I'm gonna wash you you're dead cuz you know you got died first before God can fill you up with something you got to die out to yourself in sanctification and that's where and I you know we've said for years that's where you have to be careful because you feel clean you feel good you feel religious you everybody's hugging your names they all brothers ain't good to see you back but then six months later all you see is is back going out the door no I'm not you understand but that did happen because you do go through things you go through abs and flows I did I thought maybe when I was 14 years old and the church was turned in this way that I'd given my heart to God I may have a good case of justification I don't know I well I know if one thing's for sure it didn't stick I know it did so I was probably just a little scared or justified myself because you know when you come to a place where God leads you to the very end of this thing like we're talking about then you know all of us know when you get born again then we know that God justified us and we know when he justified us right I wants to see that but don't stay in sanctification because sanctification is a real comfortable place to be the unclean spirit is going out everything feels good and everybody's like well I'm good to see you back man I just knew it was God this time how many times you've seen that then they go come in leave come in leave if he ever fills you with something you won't leave and I don't mean physically leave the building you won't leave you're walking God all right so now let's go to Genesis we're at Genesis 1516 we know what happened so let's read what brother Brown says in a hidden life in Christ how I'd like to stop here if it was possible and tell you something on that you're look created yourself he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't God's Spirit I want to hammer this with this for three services I want to tell you he'll give you a new spirit now that isn't God's Spirit be careful that unclean spirit can come back that's what the Bible says in Luke says the unclean spirit goes out of men Wolf's and drive places seeks rest on this none cometh back to his house and bringing seven demons worse and the state of that person is worse than when it while he gives you Satan gives you a religious spirit but now that spirit isn't God's Spirit your spirit God gives you a new spirit then he says I'll then he says I'll put my spirit in him but the thing God has to do is give you a new spirit make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with you so he has to get you fixed up first before he can come in I'll give you a new spirit then he takes him anywhere you go all kinds of places he's got to get you fixed so you can what entertain him right remember the Holy Ghost is a timid person brother Brahm tells us how love I love brother when I'm telling us that because even now we can grieve the Holy Spirit because we know we do and we have to cry Lord forgive me I'm sorry and then he's that he doesn't it's just a it's a story it's not a the Holy Ghost doesn't physically go out and your trees in the yard and sit on a limb you know you don't physically do that but in metaphor or in telling a story he withdraws itself so you can call him back so he's not gonna go out for anybody that says well he's gonna go out on a limb and go I know he's just going to say hey that was wrong what you did and until you get that straightened down until you get that straightened out you're not going any further than this right here till you get that straightened out you're not going any further Abram if he hadn't got all the stuff straightened out in his life and asked God to forgive him and all these different things you say he didn't ask God to forgive him I believe he did cuz Abel did some really dumb stuff all right but you asked God to forgive you and then what's he gonna do he's gonna come back close and have that communion again all right everybody got that cuz you know brother Brown makes a quote hit that the Holy Ghost goes out on a limb and sits there and waits on you to call him back he's not gonna withdraw he is gonna withdraw itself but you'll know it you will know it how many times have we done that everybody everybody raised their hand in at home and everywhere else we've grieved the Holy Spirit but he's not gonna leave your forsake you because you know what a child that God will feel that and brothers like brother Graham said you'll feel checked you'll feel checked and what you do is say forgive me Lord and all of a sudden he just steps right back in and you continue right on in your journey alright and look that's not gonna make a big deal out of it you're his but he's gonna withdraw some things from you that you should have had more access to because we're still a free moral agent and I like what brother Brown said the Holy Ghost is a timid he's not somebody like like I've always said you know I if you let me in your house and you had doors locked I'd be knocking them doors down see what's behind it but brother branham said the Holy Ghost wouldn't do that he waits on you to open the door what's happened in Revelation chapter 3 Jesus the very creator God is barred by a door why don't he just say open oh he's God does say open and the faint swings open doesn't matter if it's locked by a million locks but he's going can I come in because he's very timid the Holy Ghost is and and and for what God gives us a new spirit to be able to what not drive that spirit out not drive what the Holy Spirit away from us because he wants to come and dwell in this vessel not own he wants to dwell in alright let's finish this quote let's go to the next one number three Intervale 1956 notice he put a new spirit God has to give you a new spirit or you couldn't even get along with him you can't get along with yourself that old devil spirit you had in you so he's got to put a new spirit in you so you can get along with his spirit amen I'll put a new spirit in them and I'll put my spirit in them he said after he gives you a new spirit that's you don't get it confused with God's Spirit it's not it's your new spirit so you can get along with the Holy Spirit if he ever gives it to you alright now let's go to Genesis chapter 17 that we talked about this last week where Genesis 17 we look at Ezekiel now what's going to happen now now we've come into the new birth we're coming to where Abram is not going to be Abram the center anymore he's gonna be Abraham the Christian we're gonna get a new name we're gonna get a name change God's gonna change our name to Christian you are potentially a Christian that sanctification potentially but you can still fall back and still be like like the the Bible says Satan unclean spirit goes out and he comes back to his house remember the Bible says the Bible says he's coming back - in other words he owns this house at the moment if you're born again he doesn't your God's but before you're born again even in sanctification he can bring seven spirits worse go back down inside this guy and he thinks he's got it but when you keep it cleaned out a member Abram during sanctification he kept all the fouls he kept all the birds from eating his from eating his sacrifice he kept all the fouls away all in foul spirits so you do how it is a fight to me and sanctification it's a real fight you're fighting with that old you that's still there and then that new you that wants to come in and you're right in that little place in between that's what it says but I remember it's which one you feed is which one is going to win a man but God knows join Genesis chapter 17 real quick he comes back again and he tells us in Ezekiel 36 lot will stay right there when Abram was ninety years old and nine wow what a big what a big step the Lord appeared to Abram now it had to be in a vision or the Bible even says here theophany so he was he was not met by somebody in human flesh yet okay alright and the Lord appeared to Abram said unto him I am the Almighty God walk before me and be thou perfect he never said anything about being perfect until he comes to this spot alright and I will make my covenant between me and thee will multiply the exceedingly and Abraham you know he's four down his face he said neither verse five neither shall thy name be any more Abram but thou shalt be called Abraham for a father of many nations have I made thee he goes all the way back and tells Abram I started this thing way back under right that I have made that he didn't just become no he come to a revelation of how it's going to be done verse six and I will make the exceeding fruitful and I will make nations out of the Kings you'll come out of it and I will establish my covenant between me and thee and thy seed after thee in their generations for an everlasting covenant and to be a God unto thee and thy seed after and I will look at all those I will and I will give unto thee and to thy seed after the the land wherein thou art a stranger all the land of canaan for an everlasting possession verse ten this is my covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after thee every man child among you shall be circumcised and we were talking about that last week the seal of circumcision cutting off the foreskin and remember like I said before and I don't want to be too graphic but it's a private affair with God is something God does in private it's in the private parts of your heart is where he it were he circumcised is but you know what happens you're able to show it if the world needs to know you're a Christian you're going to immediately well a lot of times immediately they're gonna frame you something you know you're gonna fit in somewhere you're gonna fit somewhere and they're gonna go that Bob black you know down that all them and I don't say this to be I don't say this to be mean to all the lawyers and everything but you know they're probably drinkers and smokers and gamblers and probably not Christian not all of them but here's by black and by black standing in the middle of all that I think Hall County has been triply blessed to have brother Louie's brother Joe and brother Richard all working in the same office now and then mr. Turpin is a Christian nominal Christian and even brother will Scofield is it's a normal Christian that's why they get a lot done that's why you say well you know God's gonna bless you do you have problems yeah but you might not have as many same with Bob but you know there's brother Bob and mm-hmm and they hire somebody in and they go don't curse around him same way with me in the post office you walk in the post office you go to work and somebody lets out one of them words that you used to say a long time ago and then they look and go I'm so sorry I said you know what I always say I said don't tell me you're sorry I can't do anything about it and then they realize what I'm talking about you need to tell you know like they always say the man upstairs you need to tell the man upstairs that you're sorry why are you telling me you're sorry but you know they do that though for honor you because they know you're different cause if not the oh you walked in and you blurted out the same thing they did right cuz that was that old nature that we had they just went right with them because they were your brethren at that time and you know and and and there's brother Bob in that hole I means in your complex a couple hundred five hundred people in one complex and there's you and Ben you yeah and there's two people in five hundred but they know who he is and who they still he stands for why because he had a private ceremony with God and got the new birth and God cut the foreskin off in a private moment right brother brems said it's an individual affair with God right private moment with God but as Bob walks through the world he walks a little different because he had been circumcised Israel Jacob when he was turned to Israel remember slapped him on the thigh then afterwards everybody knew even if they did and they said Jacob he's number names Israel he said Jacob why you won't like it he said I met an angel I met God I rassled we got he said what you look pretty bad he said no he told me I'd be this way for the rest of my life but he said everywhere I go they know by the way I walk a man by the way I walk in my journey they know that now I'm the limping Prince because I have been somewhere with God same way with now Abram is going to be Abraham and Abraham is going to get serious about this you and I the new birth is serious a serious business it was serious business when God said Abram I'm gonna change your name to Abraham but they something got to go with it they something got to go with it now you gotta show me Abraham that you got faith you go circumcise yourself and everybody in your household it's got to be circumcised and then that one thing come all the way down even into Jesus this time because that's how they separated from the Gentiles and the Jews you could prove it because they all kind of look the same Iranians Iraqis and all the different ones they dressed the pretty much the same but when they took him into the temple and showed them the private thing that God had done for him that was there what that was their covenant we're circumcised you're not and you know what God honored that for a certain time God honored that for a certain time that's why this is not an eternal covenant it's an everlasting covenant because an eternal covenant goes forever an everlasting covenant it covered until Christ came and even he was circumcised on the eighth day that's why circumcision on the eighth day there you put into the eighth day into eternity all right but Jesus was circumcised on the eighth day but when he went to Calvary he circumcised his whole body his whole body was given for us his whole and as brother Dale said now there was the son of man in human flesh because the seal of circumcision came to man in human flesh the physical one so there had to be a son of man coming human flesh - what he circumcised what the heart but right here not the heart boom boom boom boom the heart of you the thinking part everything he he circumcised now that's what Paul was trying to tell him he said you meal in circumcision the circumcision I really don't care it's a circumcision of the heart is what matters it's the heart circumcision Ezekiel 36 verse 25 says for I will take from you among the heathen and gather you're out of the country we were reading this minute ago but watch then will I sprinkle clean water upon you and you shall be clean for all your filthiness and from your idols will I cleanse you a new heart also while I give you in a new spirit while I put within you that's sanctification and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh and I will give you a heart of flesh and I will put my spirit now if that's God talking to us oh come on folks what a promise that's God speaking to us and he said I'm not gonna give you a spirit of fear I'm not gonna give you a spirit of a devil I'm not gonna I'm gonna give you my spirit and I can't listen as good as my daddy is he can't put his spirit in me his right the best person in the world can't give you his spirit but God can God can cuz he said I will I'll put my spirit look how close that is I'll put my spirit inside of you and when I put my spirit inside of you you gonna start acting like me because before you did not act like God and we have a hard time still doing it but we have that rudder inside now that moves us we got the boat we got the water you're justified and sanctified but if you don't get the baptism the Holy Ghost Satan's gonna knock you around everywhere and you have no rudder to get you back in but that rudder will turn you right where you need to go because the comforter will come and lead you and guide you into all truth and you know what let's think about this other day out in open water really not so important to have a rudder but when you get among the rocks when you get close to the shore you don't want to be blown into a shipwreck you want to have a rudder that'll turn you and get you out of that situation that you get in that we that we get ourselves in you have that spiritual rudder that'll turn you right same all of us that spiritual rudder say no that sounds good looks good no that's a wreck you go this way ma'am I love that that's what he's doing showing with Abraham Abram you don't got much of a rudder you got Hagar you got I'm going to eat you up enough I'm trying to do everything God you got me to do I'm trying to and God sitting circumcision I'm gonna change your name I'm gonna make you walk different and I'm even gonna change your wife's name I'm gonna change your wife's name and now you Abraham are going to be with you Sarah and you both are gonna have a baby which is the promise I promised you 25 years ago to me that's what God does it's a new birth the only reason I know I have the new birth today you said the only reason is that I have clarity of the word yeah you can put it in you pile it on everything else I don't smoke I don't drink I don't curse anymore don't do it that was it sanctification that don't mean nothing for the new birth but when God changed my name from Center to Saint or our old man to new man there become clarity so I brought late your preacher I don't matter God is obligated to give you clarity of the word because he said I'll leaves you and guide you into some truth haha I'll lead you and guide you into all why because the man that wrote it is inside you agreeing with what he's already wrote what brother Dale was telling Mike this morning you you can't disagree with the word and be born again now it's sanctification you can't because you have no rudder I think this is I think this is oh I got the Holy Ghost oh I know that's why I said that now and even in life when you go out in life same thing you got that spiritual rudder and you know like I said before the boats huge the waters huge a rudders not but about this big anywhere on the big boat but without that thing turning man we was on that cruise ship ten stories high twenty five hundred people and he showed us the stabilizers that went out on each side of the boat they were about ten feet long each side and they by computer when the boat would go one way the rudder would and I'm telling you we never felt the boat move even when they make parallel park Ryan I'd you like the parallel park hit chicken truck but we get to Juneau Alaska and he comes right up between two boats and he goes why because he had rudders he had everything he needed to turn that big ol huge boat with 2,500 people the master controller all he had to do is turn one little knob same way in Christianity if we let go and let God we've got the spiritual rudder left they got what brother Brown say what a guy it was a guy in the control tower that was doing the work same way with Abram Abram now has a rudder or something that can guide him so he goes oh me and Sarah but God you still go have to do something because I'm 99 she's 80 something ain't happening right but God says is there anything too hard for God is there anything too hard for God you know he didn't look at the circumstances let's turn over to chapter 18 finally get to chapter 8 I'm not gonna read the everybody knows that when he gives you the Holy Spirit he puts his spirit and we talked about that so we don't have to read all these quotes all right everybody okay with that let's do read one oh sorry mister let's read number seven I want to read that one I brought it in no read quote number seven I brought this in the other night and I want to read it number seven there you go Israel in the church beautiful God took Christ at Calvary tore him apart soul and body he sent the body up to his right hand and sent the Holy Spirit by the Covenant with the people and you believe by faith like Abraham did listen to this he was given the seal of circumcision for a confirmation of his faith for a confirmation of his faith and you believe and accept Jesus as your Savior then God gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a confirmation of your faith Wow you say you believe and haven't received the Holy Spirit something's wrong with your face God circumcised this to heart the minute the believer really comes in full surrender amen say that folks surely must have done something I felt that come back now he felt that from somebody out in the audience said ah wait a minute no this is too easy get it when the believer here it is now he's thinking to whoever that person was he felt the spirit kind of popped back on him when the believer firmly believes on the Lord Jesus Christ God's under obligation to give him the Holy Ghost confirmation of his faith say what's the matter brother Branham just your faith that's all if you'd surely believed God's there to give it to you somebody was in that audience said I don't believe that you know if I was a preacher I'd be going to last one you don't get any because you know I believe in what is that what this is this is what God told us had to do because Peter while Peter spake these words see I bet it was I said that I say it was the Pentecostal saying you got to speak in tongues you got to do this you got to do that and brother Brown I'm saying while Peter spake these words the Holy Ghost fell on them they heard the word that's too simple for a Pentecostal that's rared under speaking tongues XYZ that's who he was talking to and they're back there going no you got speaking to him he he discerned that spirit he said no and he quoted him scripture while Peters bait these words the Holy Ghost fell on them they heard the word is that right acts 10 49 alright notice the Holy Ghost and fire came from heaven burn out all the dross circumcise the heart cut off all the surplus and you became a new creature what you became Abraham you weren't Abram Abram anymore let's read number eight go ahead to the number eight in there brothers I forgot I put these in here he said oh I thought I got the Holy Ghost when I believe they still teach that but it's wrong listen this faith all right faith is good faith God abraham believed God and it was imputed unto him by or for righteousness but God give him the seal of circumcision as a seal of his face so he could you know I says what he's saying is just like what I'm saying sanctification a lot of you Pentecostals you you don't have the Holy Ghost that's hard to say because they say I spoke in tongues I shouted I did this I did that I did the other that's when the unclean spirit went out but it don't matter it don't mean that that God filled it with anything it means they went back to their old denomination and they hung on that because remember brother Brennaman I knew it Oh a Pentecostal that he was a mean guy and brother branham say they be mean as a but meaner than a buzz saw why they kept that temper and all that but they spoke in tongues like the one that went and went with this girl and went off and committed adultery with her well well he's okay because he was speaking in tongues it see they held every bit of that on and that's what brother Brown was having to deal with and this was in nineteen fifty something but he will sit but when you got what God give him the seal of circumcision as a seal of his faith brethren when you get pure genuine faith in God God will give you the baptism of the Holy Ghost as a seal of the promise which is a seal that you have faith being making you the faith seed of Abraham right you might make us some kind of impression or make people believe or you might say you got faith but when you really got genuine unadulterated faith God will give you the baptism of the holy ghost of the seal of the promise that's not skim milk now children that's not skim milk that's God telling us what's going on let's go to Roman's 4 verse 19 let's read scripture that okay we'll read description then we'll close we're not gonna get to 18 I'll start 18 next week sometime well we're gonna really only have one service next Sunday so so we cover it later that's okay who against hope look Romans 4 verse 9 there you go cometh this blessedness upon them the circumcision only or upon the circumcision also now this is Paul talking to the Romans give me a little bit of you tension that sleepy spirit y'all must have went home and got them from your wives and brought them in here yeah well sorry sorry ladies we didn't have it well we got two extra people today that weren't hearing a couple reasons okay comesss blessing this upon the circumcision only upon the uncircumcision also he's talking to Romans who were what totally uncircumcised okay they were heathens they weren't Christians but Paul is telling them it doesn't matter about what I can show you in my private it's the circumcision of the heart now because Christ died on the cross that other was a was a temporary promise amen to Calvary just like just exactly like the blood of bulls and goats was a temporary sacrifice unto Calvary and that when when Christ came and died it took away any any any sacrifice you had to make no no animal sacrifices after Christ died on the cross they've done away with that same way with circumcision and they were they were standing there saying we be Abraham's seed because why they were circumcised you know what if first Jesus Ida said well oh my you know my what were you dealing with me for so am i I'm under this circumcision that you say but when but when the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost see that does away with every bit of that it was a circumcised circumcision then of the heart cometh this blessing this then upon the circumcision only or upon the uncircumcision also for we say that faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision and probably all the Jews around him said well when he got circumcised he became God made the promise when O Abram was still a Gentile uncircumcised so God made the promise with you when you were an uncircumcised in the heart he made the promise cuz what he said how was it reckoned in was it in circumcision or an uncircumcision not in circumcision because remember circumcision was a sign of Abraham's faith in God right not in circumcision but in uncircumcision and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised even in your justification folks if it is a pure justification where you don't justify yourself where God justifies you it's God doing the work you're not you're still contrary but it's gone doing the work he but somewhere down in there you've got a tie post you've got something like I said before that light that was circling around Abram it was circling around you if you could look in another dimension it was way below you were doing the things you were doing it was right there it was brewed waiting or what you to make a decision and he received the sign of circumcision the seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet been uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe that's all of us though they be not circumcised he's telling the Romans don't worry you ain't got to go be physically circumcised listen to what I'm saying God will circumcise your heart if you'll have faith that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed righteousness hmm righteousness might be imputed or imparted unto us also or them also and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that faith of our father Abraham what faith that faith that took him through that journey to meet Melchizedek and human flesh that faith of our father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised for the promise that he should be the heir of the world was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law but through the righteousness of faith the law didn't give you anything to law condemned you but faith gave you everything let's go to Roman's 4:18 we'll stop right here we'll read this and then we'll be done to get a song ready brother we still talking in Romans 4 verse 18 who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to that which was spoken so shall thy seed be what he believed the word he didn't have a word written down but you and I got it written down who against hope believed in hope that he might become the father of many nations according to the which was spoken so shall thy seed be and being not weak in faith now look if we read the whole commentary of Abram you would think he wavered and staggered and and went everywhere he didn't have that rudder as we were talking about and physically he did in his walk he gave his wife away and all these different things don't ever try that but now Paul looking through Calvary that that eradicated everything there at Calvary all right but now look and being not weak in faith he considered not his own body now dead when he was about a hundred years old neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb he staggered not at the promise of God he's not going to come up we're not going to come up - we're not going to go through the white throne judgment thank God and I truly thank God because if not we're gonna have to stand before God and give a reckoning of what we staggered on but we're not because we remember were the sinless perfect bride of Jesus Christ that's our promise but he staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief but was strong in faith giving glory to God and being fully persuaded that what he had promised he was able to perform and therefore it was imputed our pardon are reckoned to him for righteousness now it was written look here's one of one stop and then we'll we'll get into the Melchizedek later on now it was not written for his sake alone that it was imputed to him that's wonderful that that all happened to Abram and that happened to Abraham and that all and them over there them Jews they can say they're the father of Abraham because they're in circumcision and they're doing this and they're waiting on them aside and they're you understand what I'm saying they love Abraham over there the Israel the Jews do that are not converted because they say they're the children of Abraham because that's what they told Jesus they said we're seed Abraham what's your problem but now here we are it was not written for his sake alone that it was a to him but for us also to whom it shall be imputed if if we believe on him that raised up Jesus our Lord from the dead who was delivered for our offenses and who was raised again for our justification when we look next Sunday at a resurrection he raised for your justification because he's just and the justifier of all of us that believe in him let's stand to our feet we'll get to Melchizedek he's still gonna be right there in chapter 18 England leaf so hey we just got to get to chapter 18 but he's not gonna leave - how great Dean he's gonna be right there but we must believe that being the children of Abraham that if you got the new birth today the whole use wiped out right zeroed out brother brown 0z you're zeroed out and God can't hold nothing against us you said well I've done this I've done this I'm just telling you what God said we have received the righteousness of God and we can't be judged if Christ has already been judged and God can't be judged because he is the judge but where's the judge today the judge is inside of us that's my brother ramps that we can't lose we got the judge the jury defense the other attorney it's all inside of us and he's saying not guilty not guilty and you know you know the song guilty I had nothing because we were guilty but when Christ came and died for us and then we accepted it and he accepts our faith by giving us the new birth then we're just as eternal as God is we're justice justice God is not saying will not make mistakes but we're gonna have to realize as we can 10 Ewing up this statue of a perfect man and heading to the headstone that man was perfect even in his human flesh he was perfect right he was without sin so guess what the only difference in that man and us is as we came by virgin birth we came by sin a product of sin and he wasn't a product of sin he didn't have a carnal mind you and I have a carnal mind that's what bothers us more than anything is this thing up here man so let's sing a song god bless you what pages that o61 in a spiral book Jesus is my Savior I shall not be moved in his love and favor I shall not be moved just like a dream that's planted by the water [Music] I shall not be I shall not be moved I shall not be shall not be mukesh like a tree that's planted by the water I shall not be malicious Oh in my Christ Urbani I shall not be moved in his love I'm Heidi I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water I shall not be moved if I trust so if I trust him ever I shall not be moved he will fail me never I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water oh I shall not be members race oh no The Tempest race why's she got that a family can all trade I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by the water boy shall not be moved late day of court oh I shall not be shall not be moved I shall not be I shall not be moved just like a dream that's planted by the water [Music] shall not be moved amen god bless you all minds and hearts clear just remember if we're gonna do the service next Sunday we'll start about 10 o'clock not have any Sunday School will have singing and then brother Dale will give us a good Easter message standing in the back of a pickup truck maybe or somewhere will we hey let's get the Bobcat and we'll put him on a pallet and we'll get him on up a little bit higher be way will we don't wanting to fall off out the strap him in won't be able to move but let's just pray that that will happen and also pray that though there's a 50% chance of rain in the extended forecast well you know what that means that 50% that 50% becomes a hundred if it's not raining so only 50% of the place it's gonna be raining the other 50 it's gonna be not raining so we're just gonna pray that it's not gonna rain here and but we will be telling everyone online and brother Bob will be sending out the message of what we're going to do and how we're going to do it but listen truly listen to me we can't mess this up and start congregating I know we want to but you're gonna have to not shake hands you're gonna have to stay six feet probably I'm gonna suggest that you wear a face mask just in case you say well where'd you faith that Abraham I'm telling you I don't want I don't want because two churches in Georgia have have had services and they've got the virus one church in Madisonville Kentucky brother Brad was telling me they said now we're not gonna worry about it's nothing 22 people got the virus and one guys already died and the governor of Kentucky is using that church to try to get everybody else I mean is using it for an example we don't want to be an example of not doing but if you'll wash your hands and put that face mask on and stay six feet apart you can't get the virus so but we're just gonna pray that we're not gonna get it at all nowhere to be seen but we do want to have church service I know everybody I'm gonna tell this on brother Krantz I really thought really good when I called you the other day I thought well he's gonna go you know bees meet his brother Gary Krantz you know he said now brother way if if somebody else wants to come that'll be okay I know more got Sunday when I said day he said I'll be there then he never hesitated never said all now go away that's okay if somebody else come I said can you you want to come to church Sunday yes I'll be there so that's the excitement I love them that's what we all should be I know everybody's chomping at the bit trying to get through the trying to get through the screen to get to church because we're hurt animals we need to we need to get together and we need to fellowship so let's just pray that we can do that next Sunday but let's don't mess it up you need to go to the bathroom one at a time Church will be open but no social gathering afterwards please you're gonna have to either drive by and wave and say god bless you and going back to your home till this thing is over with but you know what the bride of Jesus Christ has a voice in this endtime we have a voice in this and that's what I said before even though the world may be doing what they're doing and they may I'm gonna say this in God's mind they may deserve it but them human people don't deserve it okay this world is just a sinful world and they sin everywhere but you know what we're in it just like Abraham wal Abram walked all through those and and you know what when Abram was walking I don't know if he said now I'm gonna possess all this but you know what God told him one time said everywhere you put your feet everywhere you put your feet and then we come down and see that brother ROM tells us in the endtime that footprints means possession so the same when brother Bob walks in that office up there with 500 people maybe raw heathens there's God in that building right same way with you guys there's God that light it's not right with brother Bob it's all around him ain't all of you any of you that work in an office or go to a sitting and you know all these different things we're to be the light to this world because there is no light outside of Jesus Christ there is no light outside of being a Christian there it's just total darkness and we see it now all the things that are half and out there people are just absolutely some people are literally going crazy because of this thing you know why because they're scared we don't need to be scared but we don't need to be foolish either but now I hope and I'm praying I said this so I said God speak to somebody it doesn't matter speak to somebody doesn't matter if it's if it's the janitor of the church speak to somebody and let them touch you or maybe I can't touch you let somebody touch you for these people I'd love to go to that Hospital and start touching the people and they'd just walk up and go home and God knows my heart I would love to do that I would do it if he told me to do it but remember we said still unless we have dust at the Lord if we have the Santhal Lord I hope God gives us as us that the Lord and somebody goes in you remember the story of John G Lake back in the Spanish pandemic they said they literally put the disease the foamy disease out of somebody's lungs put it in his hand and he had such faith till they put it under a microscope and every one of the virus turns were dead and he he was renowned for going and praying for people in this big epidemic that killed millions of people back in 1918 1718 so I just pray God you say what are you asking for listen we got the power we've got the power in the name of Jesus to turn these demons away so let's bind together this is our time this is our time as a bride it's our time not the government not then quit fighting over all that stuff my fights right here I don't know about yours I this old guy every day because he's out here on the outside having to live in this sinful world but there's an inside on the inside that groans travailing as romans 8 says waiting for the block manifestation of the sons of God that's me and you that's not everybody in the world so let's earnestly pray this week that those curves in them cities will going down and once they start going down we might get back to a little bit of normalcy and I'm gonna absolutely pray that the devil don't let that thing go back up hey man I want that I want this thing to be over with it's too many people die yes too many people and and dying alone I I pray for brother Diggs sister Gayle you can't go visit them you can't see him I pray the god will I pray God of keeping until we can see him again and if not that's okay but I'd like to see brother Dickon yeah brother Wilson Hembree and I'm sorry I'm taking time but I'm going to anyway brother Wilson Hembree sent me a text and he was that brother he was the song leader brother Wilson Henry's church before he came up here and brother Henry said I can just picture the young sister Gail and young brother dick getting up and singing in front of the church now I didn't know anything was real young some of y'all did but maybe if we ever see him again that's how we'll see him but I sure would like to see the old brother dick tail and all him singing his songs and him and sister girl singing together and him sitting in the bench we missed those people tom brother Gary and all the different ones but brother dicks right now so let's pray that if God's gonna take him on that's okay he's left a good life but I'd like to see him again I'd like to be able to say god bless you one more time on this side and then if he goes on you know what he'll be one of them first ones that we know when they come walking through the walls I didn't say through the doors they come walking through the walls we start having a service we're not gonna be real quiet Lynn I don't think but God bless you may the Lord go with you we'll finish singing this and you can be dismissed I shall not be I shall not be moved you're dismissed I shall not be I shall not be moved just like a dream that's plenty by the water if I trust in member shall he will fail me never I shall not be moved just like a tree that's planted by [Music] you
