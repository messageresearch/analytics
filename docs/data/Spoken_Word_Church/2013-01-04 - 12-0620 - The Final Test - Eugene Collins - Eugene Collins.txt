get nervous sometimes I get Dr there you go it and everything else oh my but God's good to us but sure I was reading this and thinking about this your condemnation you know I wrestle with that stuff right and you know prophet of God's City that we end the not a battle with guns and you know with bums and missiles but he said we in the greatest battle that's ever fought that's right so there's a battle going on inside of Believers brother Dale praise God I mean without this battle we'll never have Victory and we got to go through a testing time to get Victory amen praise the Lord and God has been helping me to come through these things sure I mean I sometimes I I get down I used to I I didn't want to get out and go nowhere to preach I just F boy I can't even reach to my little group F let's go nowhere and have a a body like piss amen I feel so little to have to preach the a group like this you really have know what you're doing amen bless oh my I Can Am I'll read some of brother Dale's messages a lot of them brother G brings me down and and things he goes uh the messages that he preaches and teaches and and boy I tell you when he he stays with a message amen yes sir he don't hardly ever get off sometimes he gets off and gets on the people a little bit but you know that's just something you have to do sometime can't help it can you because we see little things get out of cater sometime we can't help it I have to get on to my grandkids that's about the only one thing jump on Amen got we ain't got many any more left so I I have to just jump on them sometimes and they think I'm all for rough I say who's he preaching to you know what they have to look at one another they know it's them because that's all the ones we got there I see you can kind of pack it off on somebody else cuz there many of here but oh I'm tell you I enjoy that good old time preaching praise God it just seemed like it does you good to get washed good do yes let the water of his word wash us and purify us cleans us you know it takes away all old carnality and and all of our problems boy you just don't know what it is to get washed with this word right because it'll clean you up set you order for something don't boy I tell you I've been working on this praise God because I feel like we're getting our final test right all the way through the scriptures I've been going from Genesis to Revelations and finding what happen and even back there in the beginning you know through Adam and Eve and on up through uh uh Cain and a we find out that how these things took place then all the way into job's day and come on in you find that God was putting people through testes amen sure right and you know what it's going to end up here with us it's on us now yes sir we're getting their final testing because we're getting their final placing in the body of Christ right you know I mean back down greatest battle that brother Brown was preaching on I used to I listen to a lot and read it a lot but find out that what he was doing is showing that the the battle is your mind against your soul we in the mind age right now we Inc of age exactly man you don't go to school now to learn how to plow a mule or how to mil your count more do you brother dick can go there today to learn how to you know create something I mean something powerful something right and you know how the school today just like I hear them speaking here a while back how did they want to give more education I want to give more money to the education programs to you know to educate our younger people more yeah I said what in the world is this coming to man they done got so far now you don't know I talked to some up in the I was up at a campground here a few weeks ago done some work at a different church and listen at the people talk and the programs they got and the things they are doing for religious you know matters and and trying to get to heaven with it brother they trying their best to break into something exactly but you know what you they going at it the wrong way you know the Simplicity of the word of God is how you get into it am but we can learn to Humble ourselves in the presence of God and and get to a place that we'll humble ourselves in the presence of his word you know if you want to really get close to God just get close to his word amen I know a lot of people try still fast and they try to do all these things to get close to God but I found that that don't work too good it help you get yourself out of the way but the way that you really want to get close to God is to get your mind anchored in this word amen amen I used to hear Brother Brown how start off and listen to him he I used to think boy sure couldn't sing too good he you know a little old voice he just but boy when you listen to it a little while you hear he to singing to something besides the world right he's breaking in on something you know right and that's the same way in his ministry he he' tell people one time he said I might not know all about the things and religion and about Bible about a lot of things but he said I do know one thing I know the author of this Hallelujah we break through and get to a place that we know who controls this word amen who the word what the word really is to that's right brother and sister it'll produce life amen it brings forth something inside of us a mind of God a place in God that you've never you know I tell my wife this morning I said you know if reason back young how to in days of Samson the days of David they had to have strength yeah you know but they got it from uh to fight battles back there with yeah right Joshua's day and all them uh great Servants of God the prophets of God they had to have strength and I was thinking about uh uh Gideon how did God start him off the fight of bam right how he started off with about 20,000 soldiers y finally got down to about 10,000 then finally God said said I got to put you through another test amen y you know I guess Gideon was kind of thinking what's going on what's Happening Here yeah man it looks like I'm going to God's going to cause me to lose the battle Yeah but God had to have it place to where he could uh put his confidence and something he had to place his power in and place his glory in it he had to have something that he know that was real praise the Lord right amen and I told my wife I said if God give us the power like he did that Fells back there in the Bible I said we'd be killing one another today man we' just speaking death upon one another they want nobody hard to be alive today I said because we get our feelings hurt we get all scrambled up sometimes and a pastor sometimes has to kind of correct us a little bit while we just get shut of him boy yeah yeah I mean if we had the power you know that went got back ter but God would give giving us something today he's kinding to release his right you know that's what God's been doing but he's doing it in it's time and a place and I heard brother W down there preaching on adoption at the church and man I got to hear him how he was talking about God's getting his little bride in the placing in the place he needs to be before he can trust her amen with his power and His glory that's right and that's what God's doing he ain't going to just turn it loose till you know till we get to a place he can control it in amen we got to learn how to control this power David learned how to kill them bars and things that there on the back side of the desert watching over his father sheep and stuff he learned what Str me there boy when he come out against the devil and against the powers and the old giant that kind that had the army of God fooled and scared to death you know David come out there and they begin to try to place their armor uh the armor of that they had on on him didn't he yeah Saul tried to fix it on him amen but David said I just can't wor this stuff amen it just don't fit me amen you know it's just like the ucation that the world's giving me today it just don't fit me brother amen we might learn how to make all kind of great things and invent things but the only thing I need to know is what God's are doing in around this Throne today amen hallelujah around the throne of grace today God is getting us in the presence of him amen hallelujah I tell you what I've been going back and searching and going back listen the little messages and things and this keeps going back and keeps going back and you don't get it all at one time right man it might take you 10 years to get it off might take you 20 some of us have been here for 30 or 40 years and still we growing a't we right amen oh my God's letting us grow a little bit every day ain't he that's right prise the Lord right brother but I believe if I stayed around somebody like you Pastor here amen he him teach these great things because God has give him a understanding of this message amen amen and the scriptures that he I listen to him right somebody got to have somebody to listen to him man I'm kind of like Elisha father Elijah you know I'm I Got My Mind Made Up and I'm going to follow this message amen that's right brother this message is the only Pro that the bride has got today to take the glory amen amen hey people to there coming around comeing to change some of it we got Angels appearing everywhere amen Messengers you know Angels is message you realize that oh yeah you got a angel here ministering to you that's right yes sir amen and if you want to see an angel just look at him sometimes and you'll see him praise God Amen no brother Brown recognized he's a angel when God showed him at Vision didn't he show him them seven angels and he told them like there some of them Earthly Angels some Heavenly angels and how tell Heavenly Angels come down minister to these Earthly Angels amen better be careful because God I tell you what when I'm preachers ministers are preaching you got your pastor sometimes he might say well boy he's getting kind of rough on us but listen it's not him maybe a talking that's right right Bible said be careful about entertaining strangers in cuz you might turn an angel way you know you don't never know when Angels going to come in your church like that amen right have a message praise God and it's the one that we need to hear right might be every Sunday morning you know you don't know what's happening but it pays us to listen on it praise God and surrender our mind to it and our spirit to it because God is trying to get his people where he can release himself that's it you know God wants you to be little Gods but we got to learn to let him control the s praise the Lord amen you can let the spirit of God lead us and teach us amen I used to pray before I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I pray I said God if I can just get that in there I'm I'm going to leave this place I'll be gone I'll be like he is I'll leave here cuz I love God I mean I go to the altar every time it open up alar in little churches you'd see me there my head on that altar praying and trying to get somewhere I wanted to I wanted to get close to God amen glory I said Lord if I just get that Holy Ghost God if I get feel like I'm old Saints is I'll leave here I'll go right on the glory but you know I just found out the battle is just beginning amen I'm going get to a place where I'm start fighting in Brother D amen I got something to Lead Me praise God Amen because the Holy Ghost is going to lead us and teach us and bring us to all of uh wisdom and the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ amen and I was reading this here Sunday and I got off into this and got to going through it I said oh my I said God if I can see there's no condemnation in me Lord if I can see that all this some stuff has been taking out God all my ideals and all of my ways of trying to uh do things I said Lord then your mind can come in right amen that's right that's like when I've been having a hard time of my arm been bothering me and when brother Dale was there preaching that night or was it night I believe was Sunday Sunday morning I guess and I asked him I said brother Dale I need you to pray for my arm you know when he prayed God healed my arm I tell you God is realing hallelujah God wants to prove himself to us that we can get to a place that we can believe him Hallelujah am but we got to get our position in him by faith that we can know that he's a living savior Hallelujah that's right he's not a God that we hear back in brother Brown's day not just a god back but he's still the same yesterday today amen that's right and that's what the prophet of God was trying to get us to see that God is still amongst us today Hallelujah he's still leading us he's still in his little body of Believers Hallelujah that's right brother he's still doing just exactly what he said he' do for us amen that's right what's he doing he's getting us ready to go on a journey amen right but we got to be tested and tried before we that's right can go on that Journey amen I mean we're getting a final testing I I was going back through these scriptures and going back to some of the people and some of the groups back under the law and finding how that God let them be tested you know and they had to they had to do things and work at things before they got their answer from God sure I mean we just don't get it you know a lot of times we say well we've heard a prophet and heard the message on the Rapture and this and that and other and we're looking for him to come down one day and just pick us up you know and take us up through the clouds I don't think it's going to happen that easy right amen I believe we're going to have to completely lose our own selves brother we got to come to a place that this life here won't mean nothing CU that's right amen amen I'll tell you what we we used to we gotten kind of used to this world you know it's got a hold on us that's right it's hard to get away from it I mean the devil's tried to stain us and paralyze us and put uh kind of of a damper upon us against us a place that we just think ain't no invisible God no more right but they are a god visible right he's trying to get us to a place that that we just feel like there's nothing can be done you know there's no healing left yeah there's no real blessings left in it but that Dev was a liar I tell you what I found out that everything that the real Pentecost has is still in the body of Believers today amen right brother Dale is still living Hallelujah he thing that they had back there is still here today thank God that's right only we just been brought up a little higher in Christ amen hallelujah gifts and things that God put in the church they still real amen but you know there's more than just gifts God's trying to get us to ready to go into a journey amen there's a resurrection Faith dropping down in the hearts of God's people and it's a called The Rapture in faith amen and brother there things that's bringing us on up when God began to show John these things that there praise the Lord on a of patas and begin to show them all these things that was to come a amen and that God called him up a little higher and begin to show them these things you know God's going to call his little body up higher and higher Amen in every service you find out you're gaining a little more strength than yourself amen that's right you're finding out a little bit more about the Living God about the faith of God Amen right I mean you can read through here and find about predestination adoption but you got to understand how it's working amen because can read it and you might just become a story to you but if you can get it real inside of your life brother dick it becomes real you can begin to see this power working amen when David come out of there following the fact that old giant and things listen he knew he had power he learned that back there when he could kill the lion and bear and things that come against his father's sheep to take her lives he knew that there's some scint in he but you know the Army didn't see that did that's right how mean know Saul didn't see it he said well man look you this is something here a little fell come out here like David amen just a little slang in his hand and a few little rocks Amen to fight against a man like this right David looked at he said what have y'all Army let happen right have you let this your uncircumcised Philistine how in the world would you let something like that back to Army of the Living God right I think about the church tonight you know if we ain't careful we going to let these Giants amen they going to begin to put us back in the corner we'll begin to hear things and see things we the time now we fixing to sure enough out some giant right exactly I mean we've been in some battles I know you we hear all kind of things around around the message and I just can't believe some of it I hear right amen mean I still don't believe right amen don't it's just blows you Plum out of just to see how people that had the privilege of hearing a message like we have here at yeah right I mean to see it alive amongst and real manifest itself then let little old things come along and begin to pull things apart and separate us and cause the body of Christ to get separated y that's it you know gets us a place that you know that we them nations in their lives in our minds and we can't be free from it right you know you see us across the country sure Amen brother I tell you you don't see the freedom in a lot of places like y'all got here right amen it's because your pastor sees these spirits and he turns these Giants and things down amen he's destroying them amen with this word this message thank God for men that's got God in their life and got the Holy Ghost in there that can that lets them see if they he' believe everything that come along Brother D you so many little doctrines and things that we see trying to slip in what is it you say well come on what do it mean today I heard brother Wade telling us about the little things before service some of the things that he've been running into and right different things about the cloud P that in Arizona brother Brandon was there and a God come out and spoke to him right you know how people thinks it's because of a plane you know some the people around the message you get people that believe all kind of things brother Dale right I mean you if you hear some of this stuff and prophet of God are coming back in a tent yeah preaching a message what would he Preach Today right come on brother exactly what could he preach man he'd have to go right back to the same message he preach he'd have to rerun it again I don't believe he's going to do that no more I believe he's handed that down to little pastors and God's called brother they going going to perfect the Saints with it Hallelujah if they Perfection going to take place it's got to be through these little pastors and teachers that God's raising up by the Holy Ghost brother that word's going to be in them in such your way old condemnation is going to get out of them and all the mind of Christ is going to begin to speak in this day Hallelujah brother he going to put us in that Resurrection listen Hallelujah we got to be in it before we leave here right that's right something's going to change this body brother amen hallelujah it's going to take that Faith to do it yes sir translation Faith praise God hallelujah God's are getting us ready I tell you I I saw I learned a lot of things by little natural things I get out there in my little Gardens and oh when I pled my garden that thing was clean I plowed it two or three times and you know and got it all my seat seed in there and I said I ain't got nothing to worry about now just just go to bed and forget about it I come down here and get me some beans and poers and stuff when a few days or a month or two when time comes but want a few days I'd go up turn I couldn't even hard to see My Little Seeds I PL man there so many turs come up right oh man it just you know what I do and I went out and got my old hole and my old slang blade and I started cutting brers and right cursing them things he man you say you ain't supposed to curse but I know Jesus cursed a fig tree one time did hez didn't have no figs on it so I curse somebody Bo I get out there sweating and dig I get mad at them I tell them things I said you devil you come out of there you're killing my little my fruit creation things amen and I get them out brother I'll dig in there and I'll get that thing cleaned out I get Sanctified praise God that's the way the little Pastor has to do sometimes amen he gets to see little things coming up that's really not the way it should be going amen looks at all his little F he's got planted and he gets to see this the ideal come up that IDE come up and list here got his feelings hurt and listen somebody's caused a sudden to get hurt it's just oh he has a time you wonder why he has to get his sword out every time amen praise the Lord and I tell you what that's what God's doing oh he's he's a cutting on us working on yes sir this all this stuff around their mind it's begin to clog us up you know and the devil knows that's the way he got in the beginning kind that's right he got things out of cater because you know if people could have just stayed with the word right right if they could have stayed with the voice of God and walk with brother would have had no trouble would you right but what what happened there some of Voice come around right amen little a different ideal about things what did it do brother said it just change one little word that's all it takes that's right brother amen that's why I go back God I want to search this Bible Glory search the scripture search a message Amen brother I tell you go down there you find the little book I got marked and read and I can't read too good maybe can't explain I have to get my wife sometime to help me to I have much of our education but B in the scriptures but listen thank God I'm going back and searching see if I missed anything brother I want to make sure that I'm every little little things out of the way praise God I don't want no hindrance like I know like that brother said that believe is that precious black brother he said when I get down there at that old river right man I want to make sure I got my ticket in my hand I ain't forgot it amen right praise God listen brother we got to have everything right up today for this Rapture comes Amen brother R said if you Glen anything we'll be left here listen you ain't going to have a halfway belief that's right it's going to have to be a perfect faith in this word amen it's revelation of Jesus Christ amen it can't be no doubts about there can't be no condemnation in US Amen brother it's got to be a completely mindset of God Amen inside of us sometimes we thinkful it's all over with now we've had the Prophet come now we all we got need is somebody just read the books and things to us it's going to take praying getting along with God exactly every individual's got to have a prayer life amen right exactly I mean it just than for the pastor to pray we going to have to learn that we need to pray amen talk to God I mean this is a every every mind's got to fight this battle right and this battle battle is against your soul amen you have to fight the same devil that brother Dale does exactly the same condemnation that he had to fight to get to where he could be in the mind of Christ you got to fight this same battle tonight amen exactly because it's called the greatest battle it's never F right is your mind against your soul amen and this mind they still fals are flying around right I still demons are flying around we're fighting the Bible said we're not fighting against flesh and blood but against what the principalities and the spirits of evil evil forces has come down upon this Earth You eyes that every demon has been let loose in this Earth tonight right it's not against the world out here it's against the body of Christ amen that same devil is not after there fighting against some that's already his all on he's already got captured he's after you tonight brother that's where the battles are going on Amen the same words are coming back like it did to back there because she's a type of the Bride listen and that same devils are coming back said you know it really ain't the truth like that let me show you how to what the prophet meant oh yeah let me show you what he me have you heard that yeah let me show you what he said about this oh my I get you to stop and just listen a little bit brother around and said reasonings that's what he tried to do is get you the reason we amen I've had that to happen murder Place Time After Time and most of them done left now they don't have much to do with us cuz they seem we weren't going to reason with right amen had some here just cheer W back to come by Brother Collins you know what I I feel like that everybody's trying to follow brother Brandon yeah I don't feel like they ought to follow that man yeah I said you know Paul said one time you follow me as I follow Christ I tell you them that didn't follow Moses they didn't get too far did right they never would have got across that sea if he had had followed him right Amen brother they never got out of Egypt bondage if they hadn't followed that Prophet with thank God I'm glad I got if I told that brother I said I could take this message and not even look at the Bible y I got so much confidence in that Prophet I said I'd take this message and just preach out of here all time I believe I'd make it I mean I'm not doing away with the word but that man preached the word praise God God dedicated it before us amen amen and all these things that he preached on the mystery of God and Christ us the hope of glory and all these things that he preached there you know it's the truth amen the because why we seen God Walk in a man Liv in him God talk out of him praise God glory and show his signs like he did with Moses like he did with Elijah out of him praise God so we know that God had to fulfill the scripture s Luke 17:30 amen the coming of the spirit of Elijah Amen to fulfill on this Earth the Lord Jesus that's right come down in a man oh yeah but I just don't go around and follow brother brand I'm and put his picture on my tie and baptize in his name I don't believe in that right right exactly I don't believe he would either do you right he told some Fells one time he said you make me Antichrist by doing those things right he said don't you never do that listen the only one name under Heaven that man can be and that's the Lord Jesus Christ brother listen God is he's got that one Saving Grace for say that saved the prophet amen amen that's going to save everybody praise God is that one Saving Grace yes sir I'm thinking about little eser over in the Bible I brought this in on my final test I ain't going to get all this I'm not going to hold you long brother T told me said you better get turn loose there he me I said brother what time do you stop he said listen brother you wish start pretty early and said can't stay all night amen amen if I could get all this in I had here I'd be here all night but I know you tired and got long ways to go these brothers and I'm not going to hold you long but I want to share this with you tonight praise God I was thinking about I brought that out about Elijah never did finish it Elisha you know when El Elisha started putting that manle on and sat there in the field when old Elijah went by and he said there plowing his Ox amen and plowing his old uh fields and Elijah went by and kind of struck him with a metal yeah right left him something to think about didn't right I tell you what it got his attention praise God he began to get his old horses or whatever he applying his cows or uh and began to te his plows up and leave them in the field and he said I'm going to follow that man he's got something I need right right you know that's the way I was about the message praise God the first time I heard it I know there's something about it when I hear it the anointed ones at the end time that's a hard message you get a hold of the first time I'm tell you cuz I was at there amongst the anointed ones right but we a shou and hollering and prophesying and speaking in tongues and just living any kind of way yeah I mean I was doing but I know these Fellers was some of them as monks had anointing on them buddy I tell you what when I hear that message thank God there's something in my mind and my spirit caught my attention amen that's the same Elijah that passed Elisha there field praise God right no Elija said listen I'm going to follow you man yeah let me just get sh on my old plow and things here you know he had a lot of hindrance didn't he yeah but he kept his eyes light on that Prophet praise God brother he kept on going and you know there some of the prophets come down there those uh Fells and begin to tell him you know say hey don't you know your service's going to be taken away don't you know your master is going to leave you he said well it don't make any difference amen that's right he said it don't matter he said I'm going to follow him anyway it's my soul lives praise God as God lives he said I'm that's one I'm going to follow amen something about him amen that I need praise the Lord hallelujah what was it it wasn't Elijah it was a spirit was thank God he kept on and finally Elijah seen this man he ain't going stop don't look like he finally told him he said hey I I'm going to have to go over here to place you stay right here and just wait and you know I'm going to be taken away after a while Elisha said hey said I ain't going to let this stop right I'm going where you praise God that's the way I was with that message when I hear that anointed ones at the end time brother I started getting shut up my old ideas right I started leaving them praise God and began to put away things because of false baptism and all that stuff that I baptized in not knowing but you know when I recognize it wasn't right you know I better go on to something else praise God but I was brought up under that teaching you know and you know I guess if I hadn't know better I'd probably made it by but listen when God come by with that message right I knew then when he be to show us that was the only hope is to seeing that death and burial resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ through baptism Amen brother I said I've got to go through this and that big snow was on the ground amen me my wife my wife said hey you're going crazy now ain't you yeah got 17 in snow I said hey boy this we got to get to that water as fast as we this why I got my eyes on this truth I'm going to that water I found the little old preachers crazy enough to baptize us like Tu us out in that snow we got everybody's attention Amen on over in South caran baptize Us in that Lake in that snow but after that these scriptures begin just unfold inside amen things that was hid from me things I couldn't see right because of that old condemnation had been packed in me and stuff against the word of God and is cont to the word of God it wasn't really I mean God let me I guess come through that place but it's time to be separated I had to move on brother Hallelujah and that's the way Elijah was he had to Elisha had to get on up there Y and I hear that story about Naomi and Ruth I heard brother B ringing some of that out I said oh my how opal kind of cried and went back to be with their people but little rof said hey said me said I've heard your story about where you're going right he said your people is going to be my people wherever you die and bur that's where I'm going to be praise God I'm going with hallelujah what Naomi said there's no more sons and no more husbands in my wom you know I can't give you any more y but oh I didn't stop her right that's right she said there's something at I feel in my spirit there something will lead me praise God Amen and a something that's way I felt about the message brother Dale I felt there's a pull inside of me Hallelujah Lord there something that I need praise God that's the way Elisha F am brother he said there's something else I got to have praise God and he didn't stop did he got over across at Old Jordan and over with Elijah and Elijah turned around finally said you miss a hard F yeah but nevertheless if you'll just see me when I'm going up right you know I why I've kept my eyes on this Rapture
