[0:01] listen let me tell you one thing for
[0:03] sure and let me be as honest as I can be
[0:05] and as truthful as I can be these seals
[0:07] have an underlying meaning that no one
[0:09] can tell you right a minister can get up
[0:12] and preach for
[0:14] years but unless you catch what God's
[0:17] saying that in between the lines because
[0:20] we can read what the seal is it's a
[0:23] white horse riter then brother Brown
[0:24] said well it was the Antichrist you said
[0:25] well that was good that was something
[0:27] that was revealed but that's not all of
[0:29] the first seal
[0:30] my that just when that open like I said
[0:32] Wednesday night when that first seal
[0:34] opened that opened the whole you know
[0:36] like a blood gate doesn't close anymore
[0:40] but it doesn't just say okay we found
[0:42] out that this was a black ink
[0:46] pin that's what people do with the seals
[0:48] well that why horse rider was an
[0:49] antichrist and then they go to the next
[0:51] one no you got that thing still fold
[0:54] I'll get it though that thing folds and
[0:56] unfolds and folds and unfolds and keeps
[0:58] unfolding every understand that I mean
[1:00] really I want people to start seeing
[1:02] that when we leave the first seal that
[1:05] it it's just I don't say just it's it's
[1:08] the greatest thing that ever happened to
[1:09] man when those seals were
[1:12] open it brought God to the people so
[1:15] real supposedly supposedly it brought
[1:18] God to the people so real but the
[1:20] prophet said those people were not
[1:22] getting it so it wasn't to that group of
[1:23] people they were all going to die and
[1:24] all going to go by the grave but there's
[1:27] a group of people in the end time that's
[1:28] going to take that and let it unfold
[1:31] something straight from God CU brother R
[1:34] got this straight from God you said well
[1:36] the angel brought yeah the angel was you
[1:38] know he was from God I mean so it was
[1:42] God so when we go through these
[1:44] seals just remember there's there's
[1:47] there's it's a building on top of same
[1:50] way with the with the Statue of perfect
[1:52] man when you get finished when you get
[1:54] born again do you forget Faith No nope
[1:57] it's big do you forget virtue no these
[2:00] are just lines to
[2:02] indicate a step okay these are not lines
[2:07] to say well all right I got faith virtue
[2:10] you understand what I'm saying you keep
[2:11] Faith all the way through you keep
[2:13] virtue all the way through you keep
[2:14] knowledge all the way
[2:16] through add two so you don't you don't
[2:19] build the first you don't build the
[2:20] first rung of a step and then when you
[2:22] get the second one built you kick the
[2:24] first one out no it's that's the
[2:26] foundation actually that's the important
[2:28] one right 200 steps on top of it and you
[2:31] kick that first one out guess what's
[2:32] going to happen that whole staircase is
[2:34] going to do this okay so we got to make
[2:36] that Foundation that's why I was going I
[2:38] was trying to U show you Wednesday night
[2:40] on that first seal there's more to that
[2:43] you brother R said one one seal he said
[2:45] you can preach forever for an eternity
[2:47] on just one seal all right but let's
[2:51] read it and let's get started probably
[2:53] going to do a little recapping from
[2:55] Wednesday night but that's okay and I
[2:58] saw when the lamb opened one of the
[3:00] seals and I heard it were the noise of
[3:02] Thunder one of the four Beast saying
[3:05] come and see remember we said that with
[3:07] the lion l i o n That Lion Spirit lion
[3:11] not
[3:12] lying the lying one is the one that's
[3:14] telling you that this is not true and I
[3:17] saw and behold a White
[3:18] Horse He that sat on him had a bow and a
[3:21] crown was given unto him and he went
[3:24] forth conquering and to conquer now
[3:27] let's go to
[3:28] Matthew
[3:32] 24 told you to put a mark in there and I
[3:35] didn't even do it myself put a little
[3:36] Mark there in Matthew 24 or
[3:39] bookmark we swap back and forth there it
[3:43] is for many shall come verse five for
[3:47] many shall come in my name saying I am
[3:49] Christ and shall deceive
[3:51] many now let's go to Second
[3:56] Thessalonians verse
[3:58] two
[4:02] everybody guys say Amen second
[4:06] Thessalonians 2 where we read last uh
[4:08] Wednesday
[4:09] night excuse me
[4:13] amen don't get many amens am
[4:19] amen amen oh
[4:23] me
[4:25] okay let's start with verse three let no
[4:28] man no verse two talking about the day
[4:30] of Christ is at hand all right we read
[4:32] that Wednesday night let no man deceive
[4:34] you by any means now what did Jesus say
[4:36] in
[4:37] Matthew h what did Jesus say in
[4:41] Matthew watch out for false Christ what
[4:45] people people men lying people like we
[4:49] talking about last night lying preachers
[4:51] deceiving many let no man deceive you by
[4:54] any means for that day shall not come
[4:56] what the day of Christ except there come
[4:58] a falling away first and and that man of
[5:00] sin be revealed the son of predition I
[5:03] told you I wrote in my Bible by this
[5:04] message there's only one way that that
[5:07] man of sin now down Through the
[5:10] Ages Born Again Holy Ghost filled men
[5:14] have warned us against the
[5:19] spirit of antichrist or the spirit of
[5:22] wrongdoing or the
[5:24] spirit Martin Luther Wesley Columba all
[5:28] those they were warning the people and
[5:30] they turned away from that but in the
[5:34] end time we see this is culminating in a
[5:39] man amen the man of sin all right now
[5:45] with the man of
[5:46] sin let's just read verse four who
[5:50] opposes and exalted himself above all
[5:52] that is called God or that is worshiped
[5:56] so that he as
[5:58] God as as God sth in the temple of God
[6:02] showing
[6:03] himself that he is
[6:06] god
[6:08] wow that's
[6:10] close not to be like God but he's even
[6:14] saying something that you and I are
[6:16] supposed to be saying by Revelation that
[6:17] we're God made manifest in another form
[6:19] he's saying he is God the very one like
[6:23] I said Wednesday night the Bible says
[6:24] the Holy One of Israel there's only one
[6:26] Holy One one right not two he wasn't
[6:29] holy three he was the Holy One all right
[6:31] the Holy One of Israel but when you have
[6:33] brother brand when he saw that that true
[6:36] one true Living God and then he saw
[6:39] another person trying to imitate that he
[6:41] knew one of those two people had to be
[6:43] wrong and that's what you and I have got
[6:46] to like we were talking about the Bible
[6:47] Study last night you and I have got to
[6:49] discern the two spirits that brother
[6:52] Brown said work in the framework of this
[6:55] church this Tabernacle this Temple right
[6:58] here that's right
[7:00] okay I'm not worried about this building
[7:02] it's this Tabernacle that we got to
[7:04] worry about right here so when brother
[7:06] randam saw when he saw that white horse
[7:09] rider riding
[7:11] away he said You know here stands a lamb
[7:14] with a book in his hand who's the lamb
[7:16] Lamb's the Lord Jesus
[7:18] Christ the son of
[7:20] man right God made
[7:23] flesh with a book in his hand which one
[7:27] the book of our names right the title
[7:30] deed to our
[7:32] Redemption and then there went something
[7:34] away from him well you know I
[7:37] would be smart enough to know that if it
[7:40] was two people and we were talking about
[7:41] God one of them had to be the devil but
[7:44] see he Bluff himself so long showing
[7:46] himself that he is God even in the end
[7:50] time he's not sitting out there in the
[7:52] in the Catholic
[7:54] Church he's already got
[7:57] them right right
[8:00] cuz you got to remember one
[8:02] thing it's hard to say anybody that
[8:05] takes the father son Holy Ghost baptism
[8:08] in this end time I'm talking about now
[8:10] now don't tell I'm not talking about
[8:11] somebody that was born in another age or
[8:13] or somebody that was U uh even in the
[8:17] even during brother bram's time cuz
[8:18] there was a lot of people that were born
[8:19] again in brother bram's time that
[8:21] couldn't see the water baptism and Lord
[8:23] Jesus Christ brother Bosworth people
[8:26] like that he said great man of Faith but
[8:28] couldn't see father son Holy Ghost B I
[8:29] mean couldn't see the one true Living
[8:31] God baptism but in the end time God
[8:34] wined everybody's ignorance until this
[8:37] book became open in 1963 that's why
[8:40] people have a real big problem with
[8:42] saying brother R's Ministry changed in
[8:44] 1963 the only thing that changed in 1963
[8:47] was a
[8:48] dispensation it was a dispensational
[8:51] change that the son of man like brother
[8:52] Claud was preaching remember the son of
[8:54] man literally the son of man the spirit
[8:58] of God in human being come down through
[9:00] brother brandom and spoke to a group of
[9:04] people spoke to a group that's one
[9:06] that's one that that they always thought
[9:08] they thought brother brandom was God
[9:09] because he spoke so close like Jesus
[9:12] Christ but he was speaking to a future
[9:15] group we read it Wednesday night
[9:17] remember he said it's gone from you it's
[9:18] not for you you're not even going to get
[9:20] it but it'll come in a later time in
[9:23] other words which is th believe this end
[9:25] time so
[9:27] now that dispensation and we proved it
[9:30] there with Daniel 70 weeks when we did
[9:31] that Series in
[9:33] 1977 truly brother brandham said it
[9:35] would be the catching away of the
[9:36] Gentile bride and the Christ return to
[9:40] the Jews well in 1977 there was a change
[9:44] all right in 1963 the seals open God
[9:47] opened the seals but you got to remember
[9:49] remember what we talked about in the
[9:50] church ages the church ages are not like
[9:52] this to really draw that right this is
[9:56] your church ages you
[9:58] go everybody understand
[10:01] that cuz there's an overlap right God
[10:04] just don't do something and shut it off
[10:05] he told him he said you're going to go
[10:06] out in 400 years he gave him 430 years
[10:10] you know what this is called right
[10:12] here Grace yes you know what that 30
[10:16] years was he give to them Grace so guess
[10:19] what he gave us all Grace but now in
[10:22] 1977 I believe God did start opening the
[10:25] word to a group of
[10:28] people now father son Holy Ghost
[10:31] baptism you're not a bride you're not
[10:33] bride I'm sorry cuz there somewhere God
[10:36] wines your ignorance but there somewhere
[10:38] God said hey the word's been open now
[10:40] the word's been got out the word is on
[10:43] the front page brother BR said this is
[10:45] not done in a corner this is for the
[10:47] whole
[10:49] world so God said all right father son
[10:51] Holy Ghost baptism Antichrist that's
[10:54] what brother Ram said he said father son
[10:57] Holy Ghost baptism come from from the
[10:59] pits of
[11:02] hell so guess what if you're baptized
[11:05] now in the name of Father Son and Holy
[11:06] Ghost you're not born
[11:08] again all right you just not born
[11:11] again sorry so see that so Satan's
[11:15] already Satan's what my point whole
[11:17] point is Satan's already got those
[11:18] people sure they may be given eternal
[11:21] life right that's why I was telling you
[11:23] a long time ago the foolish virgins in
[11:25] Matthew
[11:26] 25 that's going to be a lot of people
[11:28] sitting message church and their Pastor
[11:30] not born again and they're not born
[11:32] again and they are being stopped and
[11:34] that's the foolish virgin because a
[11:36] virgin is somebody that's never had a
[11:38] man right so a foolish virgin was just
[11:42] they were virgins they were just
[11:44] foolish right they were just blinded by
[11:47] false
[11:48] Shepherds and there'll be a lot of
[11:50] foolish burdens come out of this
[11:52] message cuz they're virgins they had to
[11:54] know something right m not be sitting in
[11:57] somewhere with your hair all bobbed off
[11:58] you look like a clown and you wear pants
[12:00] at church that's that's that's Satan's
[12:04] seat this is where Satan wants to be
[12:07] right here if he's got them he's
[12:10] focusing on a group right here right cuz
[12:13] he's trying to get
[12:14] us and he won't because we see the book
[12:20] right so in the first
[12:22] seal what the things we see number one
[12:26] that the man of sin is going to be
[12:27] revealed in the end time to a group of
[12:30] people now I don't like let me put this
[12:33] way I don't like the word revealing
[12:34] Satan cuz there's nothing really to
[12:37] reveal but if you reveal
[12:40] God you expose
[12:43] Satan okay and that's what's happening
[12:46] every Wednesday every Sunday every time
[12:48] we do Sunday school class somewhere I'm
[12:50] hoping somewhere even in myself that
[12:53] that God's word is exposing some little
[12:55] something that we do that Satan's got
[12:57] one little bitty grip on it it's got a
[12:59] little fingernail stuck in us somewhere
[13:01] and we can get that fingernail out of us
[13:04] one little grip cuz see he still got
[13:06] dibs on that body that's right he's a
[13:09] squatter he don't have a title to it
[13:12] right but if we accept Satan's Li then
[13:15] then this thing is still in his Pawn
[13:17] it's in the pawn shop his pawn shop it's
[13:21] not in God's pawn shop God trying to get
[13:23] us out of that pawn shop M right okay so
[13:26] man of
[13:27] sin come to the Forefront being
[13:31] exposed then you've
[13:34] got Jesus
[13:36] Christ opening a word to a group of
[13:39] people that's never been opened like
[13:40] this
[13:41] before oh sure people looked at it Paul
[13:44] looked at it everyone but they never
[13:47] they com I want you to think about this
[13:50] even right here second Thessalonians he
[13:51] was preaching to the people of
[13:54] thessalonia correct well all these
[13:57] places was where he went Corinthians was
[13:59] in Corinth Fon all these were places
[14:02] establishments all right uh cities that
[14:05] Paul would go in and he would preach see
[14:07] what they were doing and he would write
[14:09] them a
[14:10] letter hey you're doing you know so well
[14:12] that's what the Bible is he was looking
[14:15] at Ordinary People but he said I look
[14:17] through a glass Darkly he he preached
[14:19] this um right here read verse 5 remember
[14:23] you not remember you not that when I was
[14:26] yet with you I told you these things
[14:30] in other words I'm reminding you of what
[14:33] I've told
[14:34] you and now you know what withholdeth
[14:37] that he might be revealed in his time
[14:40] now to me that's a prophecy because
[14:43] those people didn't
[14:44] know the man of sin wasn't revealed in
[14:47] that time he was still doing his
[14:50] work Antichrist the word Antichrist was
[14:52] not even during the here in ad
[14:55] 54 the only time Antichrist came in was
[14:57] when John came back from patmas and God
[14:59] had to show him the Antichrist John
[15:02] comes back from patmas goes first second
[15:04] third John and calls it the Antichrist
[15:06] we read it Wednesday night so now we
[15:08] know it has a name it has something that
[15:10] we can relate to and in that first seal
[15:13] though the greatest thing we need to
[15:15] look at is is that God is not fooling
[15:19] around
[15:20] anymore and it's not not God fooling
[15:23] around we need to quit fooling around
[15:25] God's ready to get a people
[15:26] ready all right let me take that back
[15:29] God's not he's never fooled around
[15:31] that's right but God's tired of us
[15:32] fooling around right okay and um you say
[15:36] God's tired of things well what did we
[15:39] talk about last night six things
[15:42] God
[15:45] hates you say God can't
[15:48] hate the Bible say the six things God
[15:52] hates right okay so I'm not reading you
[15:55] read the Bible read it over there in
[15:57] Zechariah Ze right Proverbs no proverb
[16:01] yeah Proverbs
[16:04] 16 16 God hates so God to me God
[16:07] is God's trying to show us that he's a
[16:11] lot more human than we think he
[16:13] is and that's just from what I get from
[16:15] reading the Bible because he's got he's
[16:17] got he's a person God's a person what do
[16:20] you think we if we're born In His Image
[16:22] what do you we think where do you think
[16:23] we get all the attributes from we don't
[16:25] get them from the devil right as had SE
[16:29] taste feel smelling here memory reason
[16:32] conscious effects imagination now this
[16:33] one wasn't messed up cuz he had no
[16:36] memory of sin until the fall came then
[16:39] he remembered what happened back in the
[16:40] garden and then imagination and all that
[16:43] I I believe Adam sat down and brother
[16:45] Brown said if he didn't like this tree
[16:47] he'd ask it to move right well don't you
[16:49] think that was in his imagination he'd
[16:51] rather have that tree over on this side
[16:52] than he would on this side I don't think
[16:54] we're going to when we go to heaven
[16:56] we're going to just be sitting around a
[16:58] bunch of zombies we're going to be it's
[16:59] going to be probably 10 million times
[17:01] more in our senses than we are now but
[17:05] they're going to be for the good if you
[17:07] tell you somebody you going to be there
[17:08] in a second you'll be there in a second
[17:10] CU you travel like a b but all this
[17:13] that's what I mean all this is going to
[17:14] go away and that's with this seal
[17:16] opening the first seal opening it's
[17:18] showing that this man of sin is here
[17:22] he's working in unrighteousness remember
[17:24] we read on down a little bit
[17:26] further let's read
[17:30] verse 7 for the mystery of iniquity does
[17:32] already
[17:33] work right only he God who now leth will
[17:38] let in other words he's letting this
[17:39] thing go on excuse me until he who he
[17:43] said bride Christ the bride be taken out
[17:45] of the
[17:47] way and then shall that Wicked be
[17:49] revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[17:50] with the spirit of his
[17:52] mouth which is you and I Spirit of his
[17:55] mouth final voice the final Ag and shall
[17:58] destroy Joy with the brightness of his
[17:59] coming see now that's an
[18:00] overlap right there's an overlap I
[18:02] didn't get into that Wednesday night but
[18:04] there's an overlap for the mystery of
[18:05] iniquity that already were until he who
[18:07] now let will let until he be taken out
[18:08] of the way in other words you think in
[18:10] your mind you think okay the Rapture is
[18:11] taking place then the wicked one to be
[18:13] revealed that's true but the only reason
[18:16] he's going to be revealed and the only
[18:17] reason we going to go up is he that he
[18:19] has been made known to be who he is
[18:22] because he's going to be destroyed
[18:24] what's the last thing that Satan has on
[18:26] you and I there's only one thing yes
[18:29] death one thing you say no he gives me
[18:31] cancer if you take cancer long enough
[18:33] guess what going to take you to death
[18:35] right so there's only one thing that
[18:38] Satan has a hold on I'm talking about
[18:39] the Bride of Jesus Christ the only thing
[18:41] he has a hold on us is death that's it
[18:44] and once death is destroyed that Wicked
[18:46] one will
[18:49] be I hate to say revealed I just don't
[18:51] like the word because you don't can't
[18:52] reveal something that's that's that bad
[18:54] exposed but exposed is good for me he'll
[18:58] be so exposed that remember when we go
[19:00] up Satan comes down he can't stand to be
[19:02] where we're at right when we go to
[19:05] heaven he'll come right down here and
[19:06] actually incarnate a human being right
[19:09] because what God had already come down
[19:12] and incarnated a human being right right
[19:15] okay so now and shall that Wicked one be
[19:17] revealed here's your overlap whom the
[19:19] Lord shall consume with the spirit of
[19:20] his mouth which you and I are the final
[19:21] voice to the final age so it'll be us
[19:24] because remember when we go into the
[19:25] Rapture there's nothing else to fight
[19:27] Satan with
[19:30] when we go up we're going to get in the
[19:32] four seal when when those when those
[19:34] four combat beasts go up and come off of
[19:37] this Earth brother Jim Pinkston read it
[19:39] and it's a quote that's kind of It kind
[19:41] of bothers me a little bit but maybe God
[19:43] will reveal it to me but brother rown
[19:45] said that the Holy Ghost will be
[19:46] withdrawn from the earth right around
[19:49] the time of the going
[19:51] up I got the Holy Ghost I mean I you
[19:54] know you could say that maybe that was
[19:55] an the anointing on the people but you
[19:57] got to remember remember one thing when
[19:59] we leave this earth there is no more God
[20:01] on this
[20:04] Earth I want anybody to think of that
[20:07] there's no more Holy Ghost right because
[20:09] what is he here
[20:10] for sure those foolish virgins who get
[20:12] an anointing they go so far they get
[20:14] Justified they get Sanctified but they
[20:16] never get filled with the Holy Ghost the
[20:18] only Holy Ghost that's going to be here
[20:20] during a short period of time is the
[20:22] 144,000 that raise up during the time of
[20:25] that 3 and 1/2 years that's going to
[20:27] receive the Holy Ghost
[20:28] right that's the only thing other than
[20:31] that God Almighty the people of the
[20:33] earth that God has always wanted the
[20:34] bride is not going to be anywhere on the
[20:36] face of the Earth that's right and
[20:38] brother R said God is going to be where
[20:40] his wife is so he won't even be on this
[20:43] Earth so you're talking about that's why
[20:45] he said he who let it will let other
[20:48] words God let this thing go on he look
[20:50] how evil it is out there but he's not
[20:52] touching us he's not touching the real
[20:55] bride you say oh the bride looks awful
[20:58] then they're not
[20:59] bride the bride's doing things they
[21:01] shouldn't do I agree with that but when
[21:03] these people go out and do what they're
[21:04] doing now I don't think that bride start
[21:07] with all right going out and living with
[21:10] other women and doing all kind of stuff
[21:11] like that in the message I just don't
[21:13] see where that's part of Purity that
[21:15] we're supposed to be a part of now right
[21:19] okay so he'll be destroyed by the
[21:22] brightness of his coming well there's
[21:23] only one coming that you and I need to
[21:25] worry about and that's the bride coming
[21:27] of Christ
[21:28] when he comes and gets us he's not
[21:30] coming back in a physical body remember
[21:31] on this Earth until the Millennium so
[21:34] he's coming in spirit form to pick us up
[21:36] because it's going to be the secret
[21:37] catch catching away you know when when
[21:41] when Jesus splits the Eastern skies and
[21:43] comes walking down you better believe
[21:45] one thing for sure if you're still here
[21:46] on Earth you miss the
[21:48] Rapture cuz we get the secret carrying
[21:51] away we get the secret going all right
[21:53] see what I mean you take this first seal
[21:55] and you just keep talking about one God
[21:59] we just talked about water
[22:00] baptism all the things that you can just
[22:03] sit here in the first then they said oh
[22:05] no the first seal was the the white
[22:06] horse rider with the Antichrist well
[22:08] that's okay to you know to peel the
[22:10] piece of it off but I believe the seals
[22:12] was it's just like this
[22:14] Bible this Bible brother BR said this
[22:16] was what was sealed with seven sealed
[22:18] right look how many pages there are
[22:21] where's the first seal start and the
[22:23] second seal
[22:26] end this is an eternal book that's right
[22:29] that's right this book may have uh
[22:32] several thousand pages in it but one day
[22:34] this book is going to go away in this
[22:39] form right and it's going to be a living
[22:41] form that's what God always wanted a
[22:43] living form but this Bible right
[22:45] here is going to be made be made known
[22:48] in a group of people we're not going to
[22:50] have our Bibles wrapped around us going
[22:51] inure no we're going to be the Bible
[22:54] right we're going to be the culmination
[22:56] of everything in here that's why
[22:58] everybody wanted to see our day all the
[23:01] Old Testament Saints they saw a group of
[23:04] people that made it and they tried to
[23:07] attain to that and couldn't even Paul I
[23:09] see through a glass Darkly you know you
[23:10] get an old foggy glass you can see an
[23:12] image but you really can't see well see
[23:14] when those seals opened up that brought
[23:18] 2020 million 2020 million
[23:22] Vision because where did it say
[23:25] eternity remember the line is down here
[23:29] the YX the
[23:33] man our sight's limited but you take
[23:36] that eagle and you send him up about
[23:38] 20,000 ft he can see in every direction
[23:42] unlimited and as far as he flies he just
[23:44] keeps seeing as far as he flies he just
[23:46] keeps seeing man you and I can go stand
[23:48] on a mountain we can only see to the
[23:50] next Mountain if that mountain peaks
[23:51] higher we only see so that limited but
[23:54] you we're in the eagle age now where we
[23:56] get that eagle anointing
[23:58] and that takes us up above far above all
[24:00] things all right so what I'm saying is
[24:04] let's do like Paul not get away from
[24:07] water baptism and all those things that
[24:09] we should already have that settled in
[24:11] our heart right all right I said before
[24:14] when we started this um series if you're
[24:18] not born again you need to get born
[24:19] again or you going to be behind you're
[24:21] going to be behind cuz you're not going
[24:23] to you're going to think okay I
[24:24] understand words words are okay and God
[24:28] can Quicken those words but one day you
[24:30] got to be born again and let that God
[24:32] speak to you I talked to you for 20
[24:35] years that's right but if God will ever
[24:37] speak to you one time I don't have to
[24:39] worry about it anymore okay so that's
[24:42] the same way with this first
[24:43] seal very
[24:46] humble but very profound when this seal
[24:50] open brother brandom was standing in awe
[24:54] I
[24:55] believe of what went on listen to this
[24:59] verse eight and then shall that Wicked
[25:01] be revealed whom the Lord shall consume
[25:03] with the spirit of his
[25:05] mouth final voice of the final age the
[25:07] only way Satan's going to be exposed is
[25:09] you and I are going to expose him
[25:10] because we're going to preach a gospel Y
[25:13] and you're going to hear a word and
[25:15] you're going to be able to prophesy and
[25:17] you're going to be able to speak all
[25:19] right
[25:20] now and shall destroy with the
[25:23] brightness of his coming remember we
[25:25] read Wednesday about the moon the moon's
[25:27] going to seven times brighter as bright
[25:29] as the sun seven times
[25:32] brighter of his coming even him Who
[25:35] coming is after the working of Satan
[25:37] with all power and signs and light and
[25:39] wonders that's why it's going to be so
[25:42] deceiving see
[25:45] Satan you know in those ages you could
[25:47] see people like hus and philus and all
[25:50] those people so Paul could see that
[25:52] Satan was trying to get in through his
[25:54] craft you know craftiness preaching
[25:58] but it kind of went away in the Dark
[25:59] Ages you saw a cruel group of
[26:02] people Satan really used that Roman
[26:05] Catholic Church to kill 68 million
[26:07] Protestants you could see the
[26:09] difference and even in Luther you could
[26:12] see the difference Wesley you could see
[26:13] the difference and even in Pentecost you
[26:15] could see the difference but now now
[26:17] Satan has worked his way back into the
[26:19] temple y he's worked his way right back
[26:22] in now so they they're so close now that
[26:25] it would deceive the very elect if it
[26:26] were possible that's right all right so
[26:29] that's what we're looking at here even
[26:30] who even him whose coming is after the
[26:32] working of Satan with all lying power
[26:34] and signs and lying wonders and with all
[26:37] deceivable deceivableness of
[26:40] unrighteousness in them that perish
[26:42] because they love not because they
[26:44] receive not the love of the
[26:50] truth not loving your
[26:52] wife not loving your fellow man just to
[26:55] love your fellow man but to love of God
[26:57] God and the love of God is what the new
[27:00] birth people I have talked to
[27:04] people for an extended period of time
[27:06] cuz brother R says when he went across a
[27:08] curtain of time you know remember the
[27:09] angel said all that's here is perfect
[27:13] love everybody they have spent their
[27:15] whole entire time in this message trying
[27:17] to figure out what perfect love is what
[27:19] was one thing though all those people
[27:21] had in common over there it was there
[27:23] was only one thing in that sixth
[27:24] Dimension they had in common every one
[27:26] of them had the same same thing some
[27:29] were blackheaded some were brown headed
[27:31] some were blonde headed some were short
[27:33] some were tall brother described them
[27:35] all men and women but there was one
[27:37] thing that every person in that
[27:38] Dimension had they had the Holy Ghost
[27:42] they had the new birth that is perfect
[27:45] love that's right that is perfect
[27:48] love see so you can run yourself crazy
[27:51] brother ra oh you got to have perfect
[27:52] love to be there oky dokie you got to
[27:55] have the new birth and every you know of
[27:58] course I was talking to this man and he
[27:59] would think that brother brandham had to
[28:00] come back because nobody had perfect
[28:02] love in the message really to get down
[28:04] to the bottom line is nobody liked him
[28:05] because of his Doctrine so they wouldn't
[28:06] let him preach so he thought everybody
[28:08] was against him so anyway but you always
[28:11] have an underlying meaning to these
[28:12] things when you talk preachers
[28:14] especially but he's like brother R has
[28:16] to come back and give us perfect love
[28:18] because we can't get it oursel I said
[28:20] well then you you don't have the new
[28:22] birth in oh yeah I'm born
[28:24] again and I went through the whole thing
[28:26] and he said well that's your
[28:27] interpretation of it I said well and one
[28:29] thing for sure brother R the angel told
[28:32] him all that comes here has perfect love
[28:35] and perfect love is what gets you here
[28:37] and that was the sixth Dimension where
[28:38] all the born- again Believers were so
[28:40] there's only one thing they all had in
[28:42] common they had perfect
[28:44] love and brother brandom wouldn't have
[28:46] went there if he hadn't had it right so
[28:49] if he had it and he's got the same Holy
[28:51] Ghost you do and I do apart from the
[28:53] gift apart from the gift there's no
[28:56] little Holy Ghost and big Holy Ghost
[28:58] right apart from the gift the man had we
[29:01] got the same New Birth that brother R
[29:02] had so there's your perfect life amen
[29:05] and I know we got to work on this guy
[29:07] out here okay but remember what Jesus
[29:11] told the disciples he said in other
[29:13] words he said if you can love your
[29:15] enemies the same as you love yourself
[29:19] right and mean it right he said then
[29:22] you're close to the
[29:23] kingdom and remember brother brandham
[29:26] remember Billy Paul said that was one
[29:27] thing you couldn't tell from Brother
[29:28] brand you couldn't tell what who his
[29:30] enemies were or who his companions or
[29:33] Chums were he said because he loved him
[29:35] everyone he had that love that you and I
[29:37] need to have right we got to remember
[29:41] the ages they did not have have this
[29:45] body redeemed exactly and that's why
[29:48] they could have perfect love and that's
[29:51] why this body's got to get under suje
[29:55] because we're going out of here and not
[29:57] any ages ever went out never had to have
[30:00] that that's why the Cs had to come right
[30:03] redeem the body yeah you got to go back
[30:05] to the underlying meaning of this whole
[30:07] thing so you just you say underlying
[30:09] meaning I've said that about five times
[30:11] well it's just it's just a little it's
[30:12] like these little Pages you know you you
[30:14] read one and then you peel this back and
[30:16] there's some more you peel this back
[30:20] there's some more cuz the books got to
[30:22] be made known the lamb had the book in
[30:24] his hand what was the book brother R
[30:26] said the book of Nam the
[30:28] right so the book of names in here we go
[30:30] to Second Thessalonians you turn the
[30:32] book and it's a real even a thin very
[30:33] thin page but still there's more to be
[30:35] revealed on this page all right and when
[30:38] that first seal brother around rolled
[30:39] those Scrolls up when you roll them up
[30:42] when you break up first seal that opens
[30:44] it then you take two three four you
[30:47] don't close it back
[30:49] up everybody understand that you roll it
[30:52] up there's seal on it you got your other
[30:55] ones in here but you got a seal on it
[30:57] right here once you break that first
[30:58] seal then guess what two three four
[31:02] that's why the first seal is very
[31:04] important the most important seal if God
[31:06] hadn't broke that seal to that Prophet
[31:07] then none of them would ever broke cuz
[31:10] man had an idea about what was going
[31:11] what was going on all down Through the
[31:13] Ages but God had to start a a little
[31:17] Kian I lost my place and
[31:21] uh let him subject
[31:24] himself to the will of God
[31:27] cuz brother B said himself he said I
[31:29] don't know what that first seal is I
[31:30] don't know what the second seal is I
[31:31] don't know what he definitely didn't
[31:33] know what they were after that angel
[31:34] came and said um white horse rider is
[31:36] not the Holy Ghost okay it's the
[31:38] Antichrist let's finish reading this
[31:40] before we
[31:41] get even him who's comeing is after the
[31:43] working of Satan with all power line
[31:44] wonders and with all deceivable
[31:46] deceivableness of unrighteousness in
[31:48] them that perish because they receive
[31:50] not the love of the truth they didn't
[31:51] say they not didn't receive the
[31:53] truth see if foolish virgin will receive
[31:56] the truth
[31:57] y but they're not born again say w
[32:00] receive the love of the truth right A
[32:03] lot of them because they're pastors you
[32:05] know brother Brown made that statement
[32:06] he said you can't go any higher than
[32:07] your pastor if your pastor's not born
[32:10] again you can't get born again that's
[32:12] right unless you go somewhere else
[32:14] unless God calls you to go somewhere
[32:15] else and then you can go higher Amen to
[32:18] that that means you're predestinated
[32:20] seed you're going you going to make it
[32:22] but there's a lot of people Sting the
[32:23] message churches I've seen them and
[32:24] you've seen them that just are miserable
[32:27] miserable and because of one
[32:30] thing youall know what it
[32:33] is they're head because they receed not
[32:36] the love of the truth that they might be
[32:37] saved and for this cause God shall send
[32:40] them so it's not just one or two it's
[32:43] them strong delusion that they should
[32:46] believe a lie that they might be damned
[32:49] who believe not the truth but had
[32:51] pleasure in unrighteousness now next
[32:56] week
[32:58] yeah we'll be here next week next week
[33:01] um we're going to bring your steal book
[33:04] all right cuz we're going to read what
[33:06] the prophet said in the first seal we're
[33:07] going to read some things in it we won't
[33:09] read any Scripture next Sunday unless
[33:11] the Lord willing that we do but we'll
[33:14] stay in the seal book so bring your seal
[33:15] book and we'll read what the prophet
[33:17] said because there's some keys in there
[33:19] on the first seal that remember I said
[33:22] about a foundation you got to have a
[33:23] foundation go to the
[33:25] second right build the first step then
[33:28] you you set that second step right down
[33:30] on top of that end of that first one so
[33:33] at the end of the first seal we're going
[33:34] to see the opening on the second
[33:37] SE God bless you thanks for coming happy
[33:39] Mother's Day to all you mothers than you
