[25:05] familiar scripture to the
[25:07] most of the christianity
[25:10] most people that claim to be a christian
[25:12] or go to church
[25:14] but tonight i don't look at a little
[25:16] thought here god's provided way in
[25:18] provision
[25:21] and
[25:25] when i was looking at this you know
[25:27] there's one scripture that come
[25:29] come to my mind when you think about god
[25:32] providing a way
[25:34] and god providing all your needs
[25:37] this is the one scripture that kept
[25:38] coming back to my mind
[25:41] the lord is my shepherd i shall not walk
[25:47] and so that's where i want to start with
[25:48] tonight and just look at a few things
[25:50] and
[25:52] after what we heard from brother bob and
[25:54] from brother wade it's
[25:56] been a blessing and so just want to
[26:00] share a few things with you tonight and

[28:56] a man that i used to work with he's
[28:58] passed on now but it's his grandson
[29:00] and he's had a real bad infection they
[29:02] don't know how he got it but he got a
[29:03] real bad infection in his foot
[29:05] and it swelled up and they had to do
[29:07] surgery and it doesn't look good
[29:09] the doctor said that pretty much
[29:11] everything that he thought was bad
[29:13] is what come about but this the first
[29:16] surgery went well there's
[29:17] they're expecting more but they said
[29:19] just pray that
[29:20] the next one will be his last and
[29:22] they'll get all this infection cleaned
[29:24] up
[29:25] and then i have a friend of mine that i
[29:27] went to high school with
[29:28] and she we uh requested prayer for her a
[29:31] few weeks ago
[29:32] she had cancer and they had to remove
[29:34] one of her kidneys and everything and it
[29:35] went successful today
[29:37] and uh but y'all just pray that uh she
[29:41] doesn't have to go through any chemo or
[29:42] or all those things hopefully everything
[29:45] and uh
[29:47] i told her i said well you know it's
[29:48] about your your confession it's about
[29:50] what you believe and
[29:51] and she she said i have a personal
[29:53] relationship with jesus christ and he's
[29:55] leading me through this and he
[29:57] he's going to take me take care of me
[29:59] and lead me through his like well
[30:00] whatever your confession is that's
[30:02] that's what god's going to
[30:03] do he'll honor your your confession
[30:05] whatever you have faith in
[30:08] because you know he says
[30:11] you know as david was writing us
[30:14] thinking about
[30:15] what brother wade was talking about
[30:16] sunday talking about david you know
[30:19] he says the lord is my shepherd i shall
[30:21] not want
[30:22] he said i shall not not like a lot of
[30:26] people say i i
[30:27] you know i shall not want like no it's
[30:30] i shall not lack i shall not
[30:33] be in need the lord is my shepherd
[30:37] and you know you know all the way
[30:39] through the scripture this is a it's a
[30:41] very
[30:41] a strong analogy that's used many times
[30:45] in the scripture because to understand
[30:46] that we are like sheep
[30:48] we are the sheep of his uh pasture and
[30:52] and you know what we are and you know as
[30:54] jesus said you know he said that you
[30:55] know
[30:56] i am the good shepherd he said i am the
[30:58] door of the sheepfold you know
[30:59] all the all the way through the old
[31:01] testament the new testament we see that
[31:02] he talks about being a shepherd
[31:05] and us being sheep and how we need to be
[31:07] lit
[31:08] but he said he said the lord is my
[31:10] shepherd you know even in the
[31:11] when jesus talks about it in the in the
[31:14] in the gospels you know he talks about
[31:16] you know
[31:16] how a shepherd really acts has he he he
[31:19] lives with the sheep he cares for the
[31:21] sheep you know
[31:22] he's not like a hireling he has a great
[31:24] love for the sheep and he
[31:25] even lay down his life for the sheep and
[31:27] he said the lord is my shepherd
[31:31] and you know he wanted you know that was
[31:32] his confession that this is
[31:34] this is the this is what the lord has
[31:35] done for me the lord has
[31:37] has been so great and so gracious to me
[31:40] that he is
[31:41] that in all things he is my shepherd
[31:44] just as as david was a was a man of the
[31:46] of the sheepfold
[31:48] and watched out you know even when they
[31:49] come to take his a
[31:51] sheep and and you know the bear and the
[31:53] lion tried to come
[31:54] but you know he slew them and he said
[31:57] the same thing is
[31:58] even all the way through the psalms we
[31:59] know that david talks about how the
[32:01] enemies come and rose up against him and
[32:02] you know the lord slew him and
[32:04] and the lord defeated him and turned
[32:05] them away and all the things that that
[32:07] he writes about how the lord was
[32:08] watching over him he said the lord is my
[32:12] shepherd i shall not want
[32:14] you know of all the things that david
[32:16] went through his life you know david
[32:17] could say you know i've never had a need
[32:19] for anything
[32:20] even in the worst conditions that david
[32:22] was in in his life
[32:23] when saul was trying to kill him and the
[32:25] different things like that you know god
[32:26] never left him
[32:28] you know he might have left god but god
[32:29] never left him and god always provided a
[32:32] way for him even
[32:33] even when you know you know even when we
[32:35] see that you know
[32:37] uh god allowed saul to be placed in
[32:40] david's hands and you know even his men
[32:42] rose up and said you know now slave
[32:44] slay him and he said god forbid that i
[32:46] touched god's anointed
[32:48] you know even though he could have you
[32:50] know he didn't do that because he
[32:51] honored god because god
[32:52] still had anointed saul to be the king
[32:55] and he still honored that position
[32:57] whether
[32:57] whether whatever saul had done in his
[33:00] life he still honored saul for the
[33:01] position that god had given him
[33:04] and he says he maketh me to lie down in
[33:06] green pastures he leadeth me beside the
[33:08] still waters
[33:10] you know and and i know a lot of this is
[33:12] it's probably heard
[33:13] many times and you know it's you know
[33:14] everybody talks about the the uh
[33:17] funerals and everything everybody talks
[33:18] about this but you know i want to look
[33:20] at it tonight
[33:21] as something that's real to me whether
[33:23] whether you know i mean i only preach
[33:25] for
[33:25] what i believe and what i see you know
[33:27] and and this is something that
[33:28] speaks to me but you know he says he
[33:31] leadeth me
[33:32] he maketh me lie down in green pastures
[33:36] you know a sheep sheep knows well you
[33:38] know a shepherd knows where to take the
[33:39] sheep for
[33:40] for them to eat you know he just don't
[33:42] feed them anything he feeds them in the
[33:43] best places
[33:45] he said he leads me beside the still
[33:46] waters
[33:48] you know it's not any turbulence or
[33:49] anything it's a calm place to be
[33:52] you know because when when you listen to
[33:53] the as
[33:55] uh david goes on in the scripture
[33:57] reading you know he says he leadeth me
[33:59] beside the still water so he leads him
[34:00] in a place that's calm it's
[34:02] it's comforting it's and you know and in
[34:04] god we you know no matter what
[34:06] goes on as as as we see here in the
[34:08] scripture he said he restoreth my soul
[34:10] he leadeth me in the paths of
[34:11] righteousness for his name's sake
[34:14] you know see god providing a way
[34:17] but he's also providing provision
[34:20] now you know and you know if you don't
[34:23] under
[34:24] uh i'm sure most of you do but just to
[34:27] just to
[34:28] lay this kind of down a little bit you
[34:30] know the word provision
[34:32] is is the act or of the manner of
[34:34] supplying something it's something
[34:36] that's been given to somebody
[34:38] um you know even in it it can be
[34:40] financial
[34:41] it can be legal it can actually be uh
[34:44] supplies it can actually be food it can
[34:47] be anything
[34:48] anything that a person would need that
[34:50] is that is what a prevent what
[34:51] provisions are
[34:52] and so you know even even through all
[34:55] the things so
[34:56] even when you go to start looking at all
[34:58] the things that that god talks about you
[35:00] know
[35:00] what you know all the way through the
[35:02] through the bible that's what he's done
[35:04] is he's given he's provided us
[35:06] all manner of things that we have need
[35:08] of and it doesn't matter
[35:09] but and and you know he said and the
[35:12] god's provided way
[35:14] you know is a is a path a manner
[35:17] a uh a method a uh direction
[35:21] anything that god provides a way that
[35:24] anyway something has to take place and
[35:26] that's that was the way that god
[35:27] works and he said he leadeth me so he
[35:30] knows the way to take
[35:31] and he knows how we're going to go and
[35:33] he wants us to go a certain way
[35:35] so he knows how to take us in the right
[35:37] direction so if if we don't
[35:39] if we don't try to mess it up and try to
[35:41] get in our own way
[35:42] if we just let him lead that he knows
[35:44] where where to take us he knows where we
[35:46] need to go
[35:47] he knows what's best for us and so when
[35:50] when david is reading here
[35:52] and speaking of god being his shepherd
[35:54] and when he said he restoreth my soul he
[35:56] leadeth me in the paths of righteousness
[35:58] for his namesake
[35:59] see because when when god wants to when
[36:02] especially like david had a
[36:04] man after god's own heart and you know
[36:06] god wanted to use david and david wanted
[36:08] to be used of god
[36:09] and so he knew how to use him and take
[36:12] him down the right path that he can do
[36:14] what god wanted him to do because you
[36:16] know god saw that
[36:17] even when you know all of his brothers
[36:20] were rejected because even
[36:22] all of them that were you know greater
[36:23] might have been intelligent more
[36:25] intelligent made it better looking all
[36:27] the different things that they
[36:28] that that every man on the outside would
[36:30] have looked at that would have expected
[36:32] one of his other brothers to be accepted
[36:34] god didn't look at any of that
[36:36] because when he told samuel to go down
[36:38] there and anoint
[36:39] the king the new king he said you know
[36:41] man looks on the outside but he said
[36:43] god looks on the inside god's looking at
[36:45] what's on the inside of the man's heart
[36:47] to see what kind of person he is and you
[36:49] know that's what god was looking for a
[36:51] man after his own heart that
[36:52] that would follow him that way because
[36:55] you know
[36:56] god wants us that god wants uh what's
[36:58] the best for us
[37:01] you know he said he said i know the
[37:02] thoughts that i thought of you
[37:04] the you know thoughts of peace thoughts
[37:06] of goodness it and all these things you
[37:08] know
[37:09] all the things that he wants for us but
[37:12] but then when david says yay though walk
[37:14] through the valley of the shadow of
[37:15] death
[37:16] i will fear no evil he said for thou
[37:19] art with me thou rod and my steph they
[37:22] comfort me
[37:24] so when it when it comes to times when
[37:26] you have to go through the
[37:27] valleys because you know we all brother
[37:31] ram said we can't live on the
[37:32] mountaintop
[37:33] no we all want a mountaintop experience
[37:36] we all want to live on the mountaintop
[37:37] but you know there's valleys you've got
[37:38] to face
[37:39] and god but he said when you go in the
[37:41] valleys he said that's where the lily of
[37:43] the valley is
[37:44] he said he's already made provision for
[37:46] you so when you go into the valley he's
[37:48] already there waiting on it
[37:50] so when he said yea thou walked through
[37:51] the valley of the shadow of death i will
[37:53] fear no evil
[37:55] he said for thy rod and i staff they
[37:57] comfort me
[37:58] why because daddy he saw that there was
[38:01] protection
[38:02] there as as a sheep the shepherd was
[38:05] showing him that he had the
[38:07] a way to guide him but that was also
[38:08] what he used as protection
[38:10] as a defense protecting the sheep
[38:13] and so he said he said now i see these
[38:15] things and they
[38:16] no matter what i go through that but i'm
[38:18] not going to fear what happens
[38:21] because i know the shepherd is in
[38:22] control he's leading he's protecting me
[38:26] he said i rod and myself they comfort me
[38:29] they bring comfort to me
[38:30] when i see those because i know i'm
[38:31] protected
[38:33] he said thou prepare us to table before
[38:35] me in the presence of mine enemies
[38:39] you know in the in the old testament and
[38:42] in
[38:43] in earlier times ancient times we know
[38:46] that
[38:46] you know this was really an insult
[38:50] and and between armies if you've done
[38:52] this this was really an insult to them
[38:57] if you were if you brought two by two
[38:58] armies into a battle
[39:02] you know a soldier when he goes to
[39:04] battle he only eats
[39:06] in haste he's always looking for the
[39:08] enemy he's always
[39:09] prepared you know he's always his
[39:11] adrenaline's always up he's always
[39:13] uh mindful of what's going on but you
[39:16] know if you're
[39:17] if you're in a position where you've got
[39:19] two battles you know two armies
[39:21] ready to battle and you go out there and
[39:23] set a table in front of them
[39:24] and you spread this course and you sit
[39:26] down and eat you know what that's
[39:27] telling the other army
[39:29] i have no fear of you i don't fear you
[39:32] i don't have any respect for you and
[39:35] you're not going to be able to do
[39:36] anything for me
[39:37] so i'm going to sit down because most of
[39:39] the time they would just eat in haste
[39:41] you know they'd hurry up and eat you
[39:42] know always stuff
[39:43] but if i sit down and relax it show you
[39:46] can't do anything to me
[39:49] and so that's the way he says thou
[39:50] preparest the table before me in the
[39:52] presence of mine enemies
[39:53] so when he when he sees this that god is
[39:56] doing this
[39:56] so when you know with god there is no uh
[40:00] confusion there is no anxiousness with
[40:03] god
[40:04] there there is no worry with god there's
[40:05] no fear with god so when you when you
[40:07] say
[40:08] that thou prepares the table before when
[40:10] you eat when you come to god
[40:12] to eat of the word then you know what
[40:14] there is no fear
[40:15] there is no confusion there is no
[40:17] anxious there's no anxiety
[40:19] why because when you come up here to eat
[40:20] from the word of god then he said even
[40:22] when
[40:22] in the midst of all the things that go
[40:24] that can
[40:26] confound you or comes against you or
[40:28] whatever you know you can eat from the
[40:30] table of god
[40:31] and you know you don't have to worry
[40:32] because you can lay all that aside all
[40:34] the
[40:34] all the fear and everything lays aside
[40:36] and david says this is when i
[40:38] when i partake of the word of god you
[40:39] know what i don't lose i just
[40:42] let all the fear i let off the pressure
[40:45] and he said thou hast prepared a table
[40:46] before me in the presence of mine
[40:48] enemies
[40:49] why because david realized that when
[40:51] this took place
[40:52] then all the things that god god could
[40:55] only you know the things that come to
[40:57] him
[40:57] was only what god allowed to come
[41:00] against him so it wasn't anything that
[41:02] that was something else so you know when
[41:04] things came it was
[41:06] god had it in control so he could he
[41:08] could rest assure in that
[41:10] he said thou anointest my head with oil
[41:13] my cup runeth over
[41:16] he said surely goodness and mercy shall
[41:19] follow me all the days of my life
[41:21] and i will dwell in the house of the
[41:23] lord forever
[41:25] amen so we know that we are anointed
[41:28] and you know i tell you what if you get
[41:30] within if you just
[41:31] get with god you know how many times can
[41:34] you say that your cup
[41:35] is overflowed
[41:40] and surely goodness and mercy shall
[41:41] follow me all the days of my life
[41:44] amen we can dwell in the house of the
[41:46] lord forever
[41:49] god has a place for you to be and then
[41:50] when you come into that then you know
[41:52] what you don't have to worry about
[41:53] leaving
[41:56] because you know what he's not he's not
[41:57] throwing you out
[42:00] he's brought you into this place and now
[42:02] you can stay and rest
[42:06] but i i just i just wanted to share that
[42:08] with you and
[42:09] you know because i wanted to see i want
[42:11] to talk about
[42:13] god providing a way and a provision and
[42:15] you know
[42:16] david explains that so well it just it
[42:18] just stirs something up inside of you
[42:20] when you read it
[42:22] and you know when when you start to look
[42:24] in the scripture
[42:25] and the the place that i want to go to
[42:27] is is
[42:28] is abraham and the life of abraham and
[42:31] and
[42:32] the descendants and and some but uh
[42:35] you know when when you see the life of
[42:37] abraham you know brother
[42:39] said the one thing about abraham was
[42:40] just a normal person
[42:42] you know there wasn't anything there's
[42:44] no super abraham
[42:46] you know abraham was just a man but he
[42:49] was
[42:50] he was just the man that god called and
[42:52] he answered the call to god
[42:54] and god realized that abraham would
[42:56] believe what
[42:57] god told him and he would follow he
[42:59] would follow god wherever he went
[43:01] and you know and and so you know when he
[43:04] didn't give he didn't give
[43:05] abraham a lot of uh heads up
[43:09] he didn't give him a lot of information
[43:11] he said you need to get out of your
[43:13] father's house
[43:15] he said you need to get out of your
[43:16] father's house and you need to go to a
[43:17] place i show you
[43:20] so he didn't have any idea where he was
[43:21] going he just knew that he was leaving
[43:23] his father's house
[43:25] god called him and said listen it's time
[43:26] to go so he left
[43:28] where are you going abraham i don't know
[43:30] but i'm following god
[43:32] but you know as god as he began to walk
[43:34] with god god began to speak to
[43:36] abraham and tell him more about what was
[43:38] going on and what was going to take
[43:40] place
[43:41] and as he began to take this journey and
[43:43] he began to walk then you know as he
[43:45] began to speak to him then he began to
[43:46] see more things
[43:47] and began to tell him more things and
[43:49] and explain more things and you know he
[43:51] just began to walk and believe
[43:53] god now abraham had his ups and downs
[43:57] he had his failures but you know what he
[43:58] still kept walking with god
[44:00] and god didn't turn his back on him he
[44:02] kept calling abraham and abraham kept
[44:04] answering
[44:06] and so it's just it's the same way as
[44:07] you and i god didn't didn't look at
[44:09] abraham's failures he didn't look at his
[44:11] his turns back and all the other things
[44:13] that he done god kept looking at abraham
[44:15] because he kept believing and he kept
[44:17] walking
[44:17] you know he kept asking for forgiveness
[44:20] and he kept putting all that behind him
[44:21] and kept walking
[44:22] and that's the same way with you and i
[44:24] being the seed of abraham you know we
[44:25] don't look at our faults and failures
[44:27] because god don't look at our faults in
[44:28] phases if it's under the blood then you
[44:30] know what
[44:30] we shouldn't be worrying about what's
[44:32] under the blood because if it's under
[44:33] the blood it's done away with
[44:34] and so all we do is we're just continue
[44:37] to walk forward and believe what god has
[44:38] told us
[44:39] and look to see what god wants to speak
[44:41] to us
[44:42] and as and as abraham began to walk you
[44:44] know he said he said it's time to be
[44:46] separated from your family and
[44:47] and you know even though in the
[44:48] beginning you know he started to walk
[44:50] and and you know
[44:51] he got a little confused about what it
[44:53] meant to be separated
[44:56] and you know then god had to cause this
[44:57] confusion with lot because you know lot
[44:59] wasn't a part of this deal
[45:01] it was between him and god and you know
[45:02] they had to have this little
[45:04] little stir up so he could get rid of
[45:06] lots so he could go
[45:07] that he could follow as it just be that
[45:09] it would just be him and god and he
[45:11] began to walk with god and
[45:13] you know god took somebody that you know
[45:15] that believed but you know he had a lot
[45:16] of problems in his life
[45:19] when god told abraham said you're going
[45:21] to be a father of many nations
[45:22] you're going multitudes can you number
[45:24] the stars or the sand
[45:26] he said that's how you're going to be
[45:28] he's like well that's funny because i
[45:29] ain't never had any kids and
[45:30] you know we can't have kids but you know
[45:32] that's like well you know it don't
[45:33] matter and i'm old age and you know
[45:34] we're you know we're both got one foot
[45:36] in the grave and one on a banana pill
[45:38] you know but you know what god didn't
[45:39] worry about all that you know because
[45:41] you know what
[45:41] and abraham you know as the bible tells
[45:43] us abraham got to the place where he
[45:45] didn't he didn't look at his body didn't
[45:46] look at sarah's body to look at his
[45:48] circumstances
[45:49] he believed what god told him and so
[45:51] when when he began to look at the things
[45:53] that god had spoken to him and told him
[45:55] just
[45:55] continue to walk and continue to believe
[45:57] well you know that's what happened
[45:58] as he began to walk and he began to
[46:00] believe what god told him then
[46:02] we saw the miracles take place that all
[46:04] of a sudden in the midst of all these
[46:05] things
[46:06] when there wasn't anybody that was going
[46:07] to believe what he what he
[46:09] confessed and what god told him and he
[46:11] began to tell the people this is what
[46:12] god's going to do then you know they
[46:14] began to ridicule and mock him for what
[46:16] he believed
[46:17] but you know he just kept on walking
[46:18] well one day in the midst of all that
[46:20] thing there came a body change upon him
[46:22] and you know what they changed back and
[46:24] god began to do the work that he
[46:25] confessed
[46:26] all those years 25 years he began to
[46:29] walk
[46:29] and just it looked like a fool in front
[46:31] of everybody but you know what god began
[46:33] to make it real
[46:34] what what he said and then in the midst
[46:36] of all that you know he had a son
[46:40] and you know he here became in his in
[46:42] his in the change and all of a sudden
[46:44] that he had a son
[46:46] but you know what he wasn't it wasn't
[46:48] the first son that he had
[46:50] because you know he got a little
[46:51] confused in there you know
[46:54] and all of a sudden here he is he's got
[46:56] ishmael you know that's just you know
[46:58] kind of being that contentious one you
[46:59] know a little bit thrown in the flesh
[47:01] you know all that kind of stuff but you
[47:02] know
[47:03] you know god said you know we're not
[47:04] going to worry about ishmael ismail's
[47:06] going to do his part it's what's going
[47:07] to be blessed and all that
[47:09] but i'm going to talk about the promised
[47:10] son i want to talk to you about the one
[47:12] that i've been telling you about
[47:14] and that was the so when isaac came and
[47:16] then you know then
[47:17] when god gave him isaac and then he
[47:20] stood there
[47:21] after all those years of of confessing
[47:23] and believing and all of a sudden
[47:24] then him and sarah was able to have a
[47:26] son with all sudden
[47:28] god's like hey well you know now it's
[47:30] time for a greater test
[47:33] after you've stood the test and you've
[47:34] believed me and you've walked all this
[47:36] time then guess what now it's time for
[47:37] you
[47:38] to offer your son as a sacrifice
[47:42] brother brown said in the patriarch
[47:43] abraham said you know he got he gave him
[47:45] a double test after all this time that
[47:47] he walked and believed that and then he
[47:48] received the son and god told him said
[47:50] get rid of him
[47:51] i wanted you to offer him but you know
[47:53] what he'd walked all that time and
[47:55] didn't and didn't
[47:56] have any qualms in all of that and then
[47:58] when he walked down he told him he said
[47:59] you know what we're going to offer him
[48:03] anyone out there and he and he took the
[48:05] young men he took the
[48:06] took the animals and went to the
[48:08] mountain
[48:10] he said y'all stay here watch over the
[48:12] animals
[48:13] we're going to the mountain we're going
[48:14] to worship he said we're going to come
[48:18] back
[48:20] when it didn't look like there was a way
[48:22] out he still walked on that mountain
[48:28] you know when you when you have when you
[48:29] have children and you see them and you
[48:31] think
[48:31] what would it be like to walk on that
[48:33] mountain do you have that kind of faith
[48:38] but you know what after you've seen what
[48:39] god's done in your life and
[48:41] and god brought you through these things
[48:44] you know what if he's made that promise
[48:46] it doesn't matter what takes place
[48:48] he's going to fulfill his work and when
[48:51] he went on that mountain he took
[48:52] he took isaac up there and you know
[48:54] isaac stood there and said well father
[48:56] here's the wood
[48:57] and here's the fire where's the
[48:58] sacrifice
[49:00] he said god will provide himself a
[49:03] sacrifice
[49:06] you know what we're going to go through
[49:07] the things that god told us to do
[49:10] we're going to be faithful in god's word
[49:13] whether we have the answers for the
[49:15] world or not it doesn't matter
[49:18] the scripture tells us that when when it
[49:21] comes time
[49:22] he said it will be given to you what
[49:24] needs to be seen
[49:25] you know many times people out there you
[49:26] know there's the world is full of
[49:28] doubters the world is full of haters
[49:30] and everything like that but you know
[49:31] what the haters are going to continue to
[49:33] hate as brother matthew always talks
[49:34] about
[49:35] and the markers are going to mock but he
[49:36] said the believers are going to believe
[49:39] it doesn't matter what comes or goes
[49:41] you're not going to change people's mind
[49:42] and people get on facebook in different
[49:44] places and you know they get on there
[49:46] and they'll spend hours and hours and
[49:47] hours and hours
[49:48] arguing over little things here and
[49:50] there and you know what if people don't
[49:51] believe this message you ain't going to
[49:53] put it in them
[49:54] there's people as people that's walked
[49:56] in this message 30 40 20 years whatever
[49:58] it's been
[49:58] half their life most their life and all
[50:00] of a sudden now they tell you that
[50:01] brother branham's not right
[50:03] the prophet's not right you can't put
[50:05] any confidence in anything he said
[50:06] and they didn't pick this and nick
[50:08] picked that listen dangle
[50:09] you know you can't argue with them
[50:11] people
[50:13] i mean you got you got a better idea of
[50:15] arguing with that door than you do
[50:16] within people
[50:17] i mean you know you know if god don't
[50:19] lay it on if god speaks to you to
[50:21] speak to somebody that's all right but
[50:23] you know what a lot of people they've
[50:24] already turned it down but you know what
[50:25] that's what god said would be in the
[50:27] last days that there would be a falling
[50:28] away and that's what would have to take
[50:30] place and you know what
[50:31] praise god it did why because it's
[50:33] fulfilling god's word
[50:34] now people can argue and fuss over if
[50:36] they want to and try to turn people away
[50:38] but you know what
[50:39] people that can be turned away will be
[50:41] turned away but those that cannot be
[50:43] turned away
[50:44] that cannot be shaken that are steadfast
[50:46] and unmovable
[50:47] by the word of jesus christ by the life
[50:50] of god that lives inside of them you
[50:51] know what they're going to stand
[50:57] you're not going to change people's mind
[50:59] you can't don't worry about it
[51:01] i see people arguing fuss worried about
[51:04] kind of all that kind of stuff
[51:09] you know i mean it takes the holy ghost
[51:12] to open people's eyes
[51:15] and if and if they've turned away you
[51:16] can't you can't change their mind
[51:19] amen just just as abraham you know he he
[51:22] began to walk you know he
[51:24] and and his walking and all the things
[51:26] that he went through you know
[51:27] he couldn't argue with people he just
[51:29] had to stay with what god told him
[51:32] and he stood there and you know he went
[51:33] up on the mound he said god will provide
[51:35] himself a sacrifice
[51:37] and you know and then all of a sudden
[51:39] there was a ram in the caught in the
[51:40] thicket
[51:43] you know and you know he was he was
[51:44] ready to slay his son
[51:46] had him on the altar ready raised his
[51:49] knife
[51:50] when the lord stopped him do you know
[51:53] what he was going to he was going to go
[51:54] do that
[51:56] well because he had faith he had enough
[51:58] confidence in god that even if he killed
[52:00] him that he'd raise him from the dead
[52:02] it didn't matter what would take place
[52:03] he said that he would he would be a
[52:05] father of nations and this was the one
[52:06] that it would come through
[52:08] so it didn't matter what happened to the
[52:10] isaac
[52:11] no matter what happened you know isaac
[52:13] was going to be the one that was going
[52:15] and you know it just just like everybody
[52:16] talks about david you know
[52:18] david was there and you know god had
[52:20] anointed david to be king well you know
[52:21] he wasn't afraid of goliath he wasn't
[52:23] afraid of nothing why because he was
[52:24] anointed king
[52:25] and he knew that god was going to do
[52:27] that
[52:28] amen until he sat on the throne well you
[52:31] know what
[52:32] isaac was going to be a father why
[52:35] because the
[52:35] the seed that came from his father
[52:38] abraham
[52:39] that it would have to come through isaac
[52:41] also so it didn't matter what would take
[52:42] place one because isaac was going to be
[52:44] a father also
[52:46] and then and then jacob no matter what
[52:48] kind of person jacob was
[52:50] but jacob had had recompense to the the
[52:53] reward he had he had he desired that
[52:56] birthright
[52:57] he had a desire for it even though esau
[52:59] was a greater man
[53:00] greater you know as as the world would
[53:02] looked upon esau everybody would have
[53:04] loved esau much more than they would
[53:05] have jacob
[53:06] some people wouldn't want to have
[53:08] anything to do with jacob but god saw
[53:10] what was on the inside of that man
[53:12] and you know every one of them they came
[53:14] through and you know every one of them
[53:15] was you know and
[53:16] and jacob's standing there so lord if
[53:17] you'll bless me
[53:19] and god trying to talk to jacob and tell
[53:21] him you know what
[53:22] i'm gonna bless you you're blessed well
[53:25] lord if you'll bless me
[53:27] and all of the struggles that he was
[53:29] looking he was looking for the lord
[53:30] trying to bless him and you know
[53:31] and the lord kept trying to tell him
[53:33] you're blessed and you know and so many
[53:35] other people you know we you know
[53:37] we we want a word from the lord oh you
[53:38] know we seek for god for this and seek
[53:41] god for that and many times if we just
[53:42] sit down and be quiet you know god's
[53:44] trying to talk to you and tell you
[53:45] you are blessed right man that's right
[53:48] you know many people
[53:49] you know as they tell about the little
[53:51] story about the
[53:52] about the little cat the child that had
[53:54] the toy that was broken
[53:56] and you know he they were so worried
[53:57] about their toy that they took it to the
[53:59] father and and you know they wanted the
[54:00] father to fix the toy
[54:02] and he was trying to well daddy you need
[54:04] to fix this can you fix this and they
[54:05] were so worried about the toy
[54:07] that they wanted daddy to fix it and
[54:09] then
[54:10] and they were saying well daddy why
[54:11] don't you fix it and he was like child
[54:14] until you turn it loose i can't do
[54:16] anything
[54:19] until you turn it loose then i can do
[54:21] something
[54:22] and it's the same way with you and i
[54:24] people said cast all our cares upon him
[54:26] for he cares for us well you know what
[54:28] if we're trying to hold on to him and
[54:29] try to cast them
[54:31] if we try to give them to him if we're
[54:32] trying to hold on to him then he can't
[54:34] move because we're hindering him
[54:36] so if we just give them to him and say
[54:38] lord i'm just going to take my hands off
[54:40] then then i'm just going to release them
[54:42] to you then god can move
[54:44] because we can just step in and say lord
[54:46] i'm not going to get in your way
[54:49] but many times that's what happens we
[54:51] try to walk when we try to get in god's
[54:53] way because we think that we can
[54:54] help god along in the plan but the
[54:56] problem is is many times we don't know
[54:58] what the plan is
[55:01] so if we don't know what the plan is you
[55:02] know what you're kind of you're kind of
[55:04] useless
[55:06] you know they you know you you work it
[55:08] you work for a production company
[55:10] or you work in maintenance or as many of
[55:12] you have done different things you know
[55:14] you work on a job site well you know if
[55:16] people don't have an idea what you're
[55:18] trying to
[55:19] accomplish people will get up there and
[55:22] they try to give you
[55:23] ideas and they try to be a boss and try
[55:26] you know and if they don't have any idea
[55:27] what they're doing they're really just
[55:29] getting in your way and they're useless
[55:34] and you know it's the same way you know
[55:35] if we don't know what god's plan is for
[55:37] our lives then why are we trying to run
[55:38] it
[55:40] that's right we get in our own way
[55:43] but you know if we can just allow god to
[55:45] work then he can lead us the places
[55:47] where we need to be
[55:52] and you know all this time that that
[55:54] abraham was walking with god
[55:56] all through all on this journey you know
[55:59] he was placing his footsteps
[56:03] and you know all this time that they
[56:05] were walking all the time that they
[56:07] walked with god you know
[56:08] that was the promised land god had given
[56:11] them a
[56:12] a place to come to
[56:15] and here and here they are all this time
[56:17] they're walking
[56:18] you know all the footsteps that they put
[56:20] down was their possession
[56:22] and here that here they are walking and
[56:24] and jacob
[56:25] coming to coming and you know asking for
[56:28] the lord's blessing and
[56:30] and all those things and god trying to
[56:31] talk to him
[56:33] and then and then you know there came a
[56:35] time where you know that
[56:36] you know he the angel came to him and
[56:38] you know
[56:39] jacob wanted to wrestle you know he's
[56:41] like you know i want you to bless me i
[56:42] want you to bless me you know he was
[56:43] gonna hang on to him
[56:45] and he said like i gotta go he said you
[56:46] know he said i'm not gonna let you
[56:48] go till you bless me you know he
[56:50] wrestled with him all night long until
[56:51] he got a blessing from him
[56:53] and then you know then he was touched in
[56:54] the in the side you know and then he
[56:56] left
[56:56] you know then it changed the way he
[56:57] walked for the rest of the time he
[56:59] he was he was a limping prince with god
[57:02] but you know
[57:03] he come to a place through that that he
[57:05] realized that god had blessed him
[57:07] that he was blessed and then you know
[57:10] from jacob we or israel we see that the
[57:12] patriarchs came in
[57:14] and and you know he and all all of the
[57:16] sons and you know he began
[57:17] to multiply and and you see all the the
[57:19] blessings that god had done for him and
[57:22] you know then from from there you know
[57:24] all of the different ones that
[57:25] that had taken place and you know
[57:28] we see that um we see that
[57:32] from jacob we see that joseph came in
[57:36] into being you know his son and you know
[57:38] it was it was a perfect
[57:40] man and you know was you know all the
[57:42] things that
[57:43] that we know about joseph and his life
[57:45] and you know being
[57:46] being a a spiritual man and and you know
[57:49] all the things that you know
[57:51] being hated of his brothers and because
[57:53] he was different you know because
[57:54] and he was loved of his father and and
[57:57] all those things
[58:01] but you know we know that
[58:04] god told god told abraham he said
[58:08] he said your your children your
[58:10] descendants your seed
[58:11] he said they'll they'll be strangers in
[58:13] a strange land
[58:14] they'll sojourn in a strange land and he
[58:18] said he said in the midst of all that he
[58:19] said then he said they'll be brought out
[58:21] with a great deliverance so bring them
[58:23] out
[58:25] and you know here's here's joseph you
[58:27] know
[58:28] being being this being the son and you
[58:31] know he was he was loved of his father
[58:33] and hated of his brothers and you know
[58:34] being spiritual and
[58:35] we know that god spoke to joseph and
[58:37] began to explain to him
[58:39] how what things were going to take place
[58:40] and you know they
[58:42] they hated him and and because he
[58:44] because he was
[58:45] the peculiar person and and all the
[58:48] things that had taken place and then he
[58:49] began to have dreams and
[58:51] tell the dreams and well that just made
[58:52] him more you know madder at him because
[58:54] you know they just
[58:55] was made more more angry and because you
[58:57] know then that even
[58:58] even got rebuked by his dad because he
[59:01] said you know we're going to bow to you
[59:04] but you know you know it was still the
[59:05] word of god it was still it's still what
[59:06] joseph was just telling what god was
[59:08] showing him
[59:09] you know he wasn't trying to make
[59:10] anything of himself but it was just
[59:12] god speaking to him and in the midst of
[59:15] you know
[59:16] as he began to speak and began to walk
[59:19] before the lord and
[59:20] you know we know that you know they uh
[59:23] hated him so much they wanted to get rid
[59:25] of him they conspired to kill him
[59:29] but you know it was reuben that told
[59:30] them said you know we're not going to
[59:31] shed in and sent blood you know he's
[59:33] he's our he's our brother we're not

[59:36] you know they came came the uh time when

[59:39] caravan came by i believe it was
[59:42] ishmaelites or whatever

[59:44] they sold him into slavery so well you
[59:46] know
[59:47] we'll get rid of him we won't have to

[59:57] deceived their father said you know your
[59:59] son is dead we found his coat
[1:00:01] of many colors dipped in blood and you
[1:00:03] know that
[1:00:04] then you know jacob was there and you
[1:00:06] know he was talking about oh
[1:00:08] i'm gonna be in mourning for the rest of
[1:00:10] my life because he's gone from me and
[1:00:12] you know he said you know
[1:00:13] my great hairs will go to the to the
[1:00:15] ground because my son is gone i'll never
[1:00:17] be
[1:00:18] comforted from this and i'll never get
[1:00:20] over this
[1:00:21] but you know we see that how joseph was
[1:00:23] sold into slavery and his brothers
[1:00:25] thought well
[1:00:26] we got rid of him you know but you know
[1:00:28] there came a time
[1:00:29] when in the midst of all these things
[1:00:31] that joseph
[1:00:32] here's here's amanda's after you know it
[1:00:34] was a great man
[1:00:35] spiritual was a prophet and you know all
[1:00:37] the things that he had done
[1:00:38] he had a perfect life and yet all this
[1:00:40] stuff had befallen him
[1:00:42] all these terrible things that come upon
[1:00:44] him where he's sold into slavery and
[1:00:45] he's bound
[1:00:46] and he's taken away from his family and
[1:00:49] even though his brothers didn't
[1:00:50] didn't care for him too much you know he
[1:00:51] still missed being with his family he
[1:00:53] loved them
[1:00:54] but you know he went away but you know
[1:00:55] god had his hand on him
[1:00:57] even in the midst of all the struggles
[1:00:59] and all the torments and all the things
[1:01:00] that he had he faced
[1:01:02] god still had his hand on joseph and
[1:01:04] even when he got sold into slayer you
[1:01:06] know
[1:01:06] and he went down there was in potiphar's
[1:01:07] house and he went in and in the midst of
[1:01:09] all that
[1:01:10] everything that joseph put his hand to
[1:01:12] he was blessed
[1:01:13] that he blessed potiphar's house and
[1:01:15] everything that took place and
[1:01:16] and then and then when potiphar's wife
[1:01:18] you know she tried to she wanted him to
[1:01:20] to lie with her and all that you know
[1:01:22] and then he ran from him they
[1:01:24] put him in prison and you know he was
[1:01:25] there in in the prison house and
[1:01:27] you know even in the midst of all the
[1:01:29] they the the guard of the prison house
[1:01:31] realized what kind of man that joseph
[1:01:33] was
[1:01:33] and then he brought him and he put him
[1:01:35] over everybody and and
[1:01:36] you know and even even in the prison the
[1:01:38] prison house was blessed because joseph
[1:01:40] was there
[1:01:42] you know and god still had his hand upon
[1:01:44] him and you know and all the things that
[1:01:46] they saw that that he done and as as he
[1:01:48] was walking through and all these things
[1:01:50] that took place
[1:01:51] and then in the midst of all of this you
[1:01:53] know joseph
[1:01:54] was was walking and he was you know just
[1:01:57] living the life before
[1:01:58] and everybody's like well why you know
[1:02:00] you'd have to think why is all this
[1:02:01] befalling us
[1:02:03] but you know what it was to fulfill the
[1:02:05] scripture
[1:02:06] it was to fulfill the word amen
[1:02:12] now brother branham says in in the
[1:02:13] message
[1:02:15] this is from proving his word
[1:02:20] he said he promised his seed to be a
[1:02:23] stranger in a strange land and be
[1:02:25] misjudged by the people
[1:02:27] and they would sojourn abraham's seed
[1:02:29] for 400 years among
[1:02:30] strangers strange people and he
[1:02:32] fulfilled his word just exactly
[1:02:34] what he said he would do abraham c did
[1:02:36] sojourn
[1:02:37] in egypt 400 years he promised also to
[1:02:40] deliver them with a mighty hand a strong
[1:02:41] hand
[1:02:42] he would deliver the people out of the
[1:02:44] egyptian bondage and he kept his word
[1:02:46] look what he had to do to get them
[1:02:48] children down in egypt
[1:02:50] it looked like a disaster had was
[1:02:52] befalling and everything
[1:02:55] he said look how horrible for joseph to
[1:02:58] be considered dead
[1:02:59] and he was talking about how hard it was
[1:03:01] for
[1:03:02] he says isaac but he said says
[1:03:05] jacob his father
[1:03:06] to believe that his own son was killed
[1:03:07] by animals how hard it was for little
[1:03:09] joseph to know that
[1:03:10] the poor little fell away from his
[1:03:12] people betrayed by his brethren thrown
[1:03:13] in a ditch supposedly to be dead
[1:03:16] sheep blood put on his coat where they
[1:03:18] had slayed a lamb
[1:03:19] to eat it put the blood on it and took
[1:03:21] it to his father knowing all this
[1:03:22] but joseph could remember one thing that
[1:03:24] the hand of the lord was upon him
[1:03:26] he knew that he was a believer no matter
[1:03:28] how his brothers turned him out
[1:03:31] how much there was no cooperation or
[1:03:32] nothing else joseph knew
[1:03:34] god would keep his word when he saw that
[1:03:37] vision
[1:03:38] of all them bowing before him he know
[1:03:41] that he
[1:03:41] that had to come to pass because it was
[1:03:44] thus saith the lord amen
[1:03:46] don't care how unreasonable it seemed
[1:03:48] joseph knew it was the truth
[1:03:50] no matter how hard the task was and what
[1:03:52] he had to go through with
[1:03:54] he knew someday every one of them would
[1:03:57] bow before his feet
[1:03:58] how is it how is he going to do it when
[1:04:01] they hated him but
[1:04:02] god god knowed god would prove
[1:04:06] his word every time amen
[1:04:11] so we know that you know joseph here
[1:04:14] went through or yeah joseph went through
[1:04:16] all this but you know god had his hand
[1:04:18] on him
[1:04:19] and he knew that god was going to bring
[1:04:21] it through and you know even in the
[1:04:22] midst of all of that and
[1:04:24] and you know the the the baker and the
[1:04:26] butler were cast into the prison and
[1:04:28] and you know they they asked about the
[1:04:31] about their dreams and he
[1:04:32] interpreted the dreams correctly and you
[1:04:34] know we knew what took place
[1:04:36] how the butler was restored and the
[1:04:37] baker was was slain and
[1:04:39] you know how all these things and you
[1:04:41] know yet he was still forgotten about
[1:04:43] but until the pharaoh received you know
[1:04:46] had these dreams that he couldn't
[1:04:47] interpret to see what was going to take
[1:04:49] place
[1:04:50] and in the midst of all this then when
[1:04:51] it when it comes to place they couldn't
[1:04:53] find anybody
[1:04:54] to interpret the dreams then the butler
[1:04:56] was like oh yeah i remember a fella
[1:04:58] he's down in the prison but he could
[1:04:59] interpret dreams
[1:05:01] and so you know then then joseph was
[1:05:03] brought forth and he could interpret the
[1:05:04] dreams and realize
[1:05:05] listen pharaoh this is what what your
[1:05:07] dreams are there's a famine coming
[1:05:10] you're going to have you're going to
[1:05:11] have a period of great harvest you're
[1:05:13] going to have
[1:05:14] everything's going to be great for a
[1:05:15] while but all of a sudden then there's
[1:05:16] going to be seven years that you're
[1:05:18] going to have a famine and you need to
[1:05:19] prepare
[1:05:20] and he and he gives him said this is
[1:05:21] what we're going to have to do to
[1:05:22] prepare
[1:05:23] and then when when pharaoh sees that
[1:05:25] this was going to take place
[1:05:27] then when he brings it to this then he
[1:05:28] realized you know is there any man
[1:05:31] in all of egypt that has the wisdom of
[1:05:33] god that is anointed with the spirit of
[1:05:35] god
[1:05:36] that can be over this and so in all of
[1:05:39] the things that took place then
[1:05:40] then pharaoh elevates
[1:05:43] joseph to the second in command to next
[1:05:46] to him
[1:05:47] and he said listen he said i want you to
[1:05:49] and implement all this and take care of
[1:05:51] all this
[1:05:52] and you know when we see all this take
[1:05:53] place well then then you know
[1:05:55] in the famine time that his brothers
[1:05:57] came and you know they came and he
[1:05:59] recognized them they didn't recognize
[1:06:01] him but you know then he began to speak
[1:06:03] to his brothers and
[1:06:04] and you know make it kind of hard on
[1:06:06] them at first because they had come back
[1:06:07] and you know
[1:06:08] he said you're spies and he said y'all
[1:06:10] just come to see the land and
[1:06:11] he said you know he said well we have
[1:06:13] another brother we have one that's
[1:06:15] that's not with us and we've got one
[1:06:16] that's still with our father and he's
[1:06:18] like
[1:06:18] you're just liars he said i want to see
[1:06:20] the other one he keeps
[1:06:21] i guess i believe it was simian or
[1:06:23] whichever one he kept you know he kept
[1:06:24] one of the brothers he sent them back
[1:06:25] and he said you gotta
[1:06:26] bring your brother back and he said if
[1:06:28] you don't and your brother's dead and
[1:06:30] you know all the things that took place
[1:06:32] and you know then you know then he was
[1:06:33] able
[1:06:34] in time when they came back then he was
[1:06:35] able to he couldn't hold his self any
[1:06:37] longer you know he had to identify
[1:06:38] himself and he told him he said listen
[1:06:40] i'm joseph
[1:06:41] i'm your brother he said you know all
[1:06:43] the things that have taken place look he
[1:06:45] said
[1:06:45] he said you know he said y'all hated me
[1:06:48] he said y'all wanted to get rid of me
[1:06:49] but he said look he said all of this he
[1:06:51] said god done this
[1:06:52] to to preserve life he said is my father
[1:06:56] still alive and you know he said then
[1:06:57] bring you then bring your
[1:06:58] your brothers and your sisters down and
[1:07:00] and everybody your
[1:07:01] all of your all your children and your
[1:07:03] children's children everybody bring
[1:07:05] everybody down bring my father down
[1:07:07] i want to see him and he said there's a
[1:07:08] place here for you there's a place in
[1:07:11] goshen for you
[1:07:12] he said because because we've got many
[1:07:14] more years of a famine left but he said
[1:07:15] there's a place
[1:07:16] for you that i can take care of you and
[1:07:18] you know we know that the
[1:07:19] the children of israel came down into
[1:07:21] into egypt and
[1:07:22] they were able to live out their uh the
[1:07:25] time of the famine
[1:07:27] but you know when and all of that you
[1:07:28] know it was fulfilling god's word and
[1:07:31] you know and many times when we see
[1:07:33] things that that we don't understand we
[1:07:34] don't
[1:07:35] understand why things happen the way
[1:07:36] they do but you know here it was
[1:07:38] fulfilling the word of god and here they
[1:07:40] are bringing all of those
[1:07:42] people down into the land of egypt and
[1:07:44] they became a great mighty nation and
[1:07:45] they were blessed during that time
[1:07:47] until there came one that didn't know
[1:07:49] joseph
[1:07:50] and then there came a pharaoh that
[1:07:52] didn't know joseph and did not know the
[1:07:54] blessing that laid it within their
[1:07:56] in their borders but here was a blessing
[1:07:59] but you know what he didn't he didn't
[1:08:00] recognize any of that
[1:08:02] that was that wasn't nothing to him one
[1:08:04] because he didn't he didn't know
[1:08:05] anything
[1:08:05] he just knows these people are a enemy
[1:08:08] to me
[1:08:10] why because he was fearful of them
[1:08:11] because they were so powerful
[1:08:13] and not realizing what a blessing they
[1:08:15] were
[1:08:16] they were they were not they're trying
[1:08:18] to take over egypt why because egypt was
[1:08:19] not their land
[1:08:21] egypt was not not their homeland was not
[1:08:24] anything they wanted
[1:08:27] but you know to fulfill the word that
[1:08:28] abraham received
[1:08:30] that god had to speak to them and he had
[1:08:32] to harden pharaoh's heart
[1:08:34] to bring the children of israel back out
[1:08:36] of egypt back to the promised land the
[1:08:38] promised land that he made
[1:08:40] of abraham and you know in all of these
[1:08:42] things and and so
[1:08:43] you know then it came time that that he
[1:08:45] had to bring them out
[1:08:48] you know and and so you know here they
[1:08:49] are and when when they receive this
[1:08:54] pharaoh they didn't know joseph
[1:08:58] and he was like you know we're going to
[1:08:59] destroy these people
[1:09:02] we're going to kill we're going to kill
[1:09:03] all the children we're going to get rid
[1:09:05] of these people
[1:09:09] and you know there was and yet all of
[1:09:11] those people down there saying you know
[1:09:12] god said it was going to be a deliverer
[1:09:18] you know amram and joseph down there
[1:09:19] talking about you know there's going to
[1:09:20] be a deliverer
[1:09:22] and all the things that they had went
[1:09:24] through and all the ones that they had
[1:09:25] seen all of those children get killed
[1:09:27] being fed to the alligators and all the
[1:09:29] things that they had went through
[1:09:31] but you know god raised up one to
[1:09:33] deliver them
[1:09:35] amen to bring them out
[1:09:41] you know and and you know sometimes when
[1:09:44] we
[1:09:44] when we see things we we see things we
[1:09:46] only see things in the short term but
[1:09:48] sometimes we don't see
[1:09:49] the long-term effects of things
[1:09:54] you know because you know you know here
[1:09:56] many people they read the story of
[1:09:57] joseph and
[1:09:58] you know many times they just think
[1:10:00] joseph was in it was in egypt and you
[1:10:01] know they came down there and he
[1:10:03] preserved their life but you know
[1:10:05] something had to take place because the
[1:10:07] word
[1:10:08] to abraham had to be fulfilled and so
[1:10:10] when he came down there
[1:10:12] you know all of that had to take place
[1:10:14] but see joseph stand there knew that he
[1:10:16] was
[1:10:16] he was anointed of god but you know he
[1:10:17] did not realize that he was the one that
[1:10:19] was going to fulfill
[1:10:20] see god had spoken to him and he had
[1:10:22] this uh
[1:10:24] vision of what was going to take place
[1:10:25] but you know there was another vision
[1:10:27] that was spoken
[1:10:28] that was going to take place and that
[1:10:29] was
[1:10:31] that he was going to bring his people
[1:10:33] out by a mighty hand
[1:10:35] but they had to be in that land and so
[1:10:38] they had to be brought down into egypt
[1:10:40] and so all these things had to work
[1:10:42] together to fulfill the word of god
[1:10:44] and you know many times we see things
[1:10:46] that happen in our lives and we wonder
[1:10:48] why
[1:10:48] things happen the way they do why
[1:10:50] because god is fulfilling the word and
[1:10:52] sometimes we see the word we see parts
[1:10:54] of the word but we don't see the full
[1:10:56] picture
[1:10:56] but you know god don't want us to see
[1:10:58] the full picture sometimes he wants us
[1:11:00] to focus on the one part that he's
[1:11:01] trying to fulfill trying to show us
[1:11:03] something
[1:11:03] and if we can see that then we then
[1:11:05] later on he can show
[1:11:06] because many times we see things in our
[1:11:08] lives and we wonder and we look back
[1:11:10] and you know and you know you look back
[1:11:12] a few years later and you look at that
[1:11:14] and you think man that was a that was an
[1:11:15] amazing
[1:11:16] thing that god brought me through that
[1:11:17] was an overcoming but sometimes you know
[1:11:19] when you look back many years later then
[1:11:21] you look back and say
[1:11:22] man that was even greater well because
[1:11:24] when you see those things sometimes we
[1:11:26] don't see
[1:11:27] the full magnifi the magnificent work of
[1:11:30] god when it when it first takes place in
[1:11:31] our lives we see things it's like man
[1:11:33] that was amazing but then later on that
[1:11:34] we realized you know it was even a
[1:11:36] greater victory than sometimes when you
[1:11:37] look back on it
[1:11:38] to say what god has done and how god has
[1:11:41] brought you through these things and
[1:11:42] and god has delivered you and god is
[1:11:44] ministered to you and you think man
[1:11:46] what god has done and you know what
[1:11:48] you're just like
[1:11:49] i can't thank him enough i can't give
[1:11:51] him enough glory i can't give him
[1:11:52] enough praise because you then as you
[1:11:55] begin to see the things that you've seen
[1:11:56] in your life and what god has done for
[1:11:58] you
[1:11:58] you know it's such an amazing thing and
[1:12:01] and so you know there's many times we
[1:12:02] look back in our lives and
[1:12:04] and we see you know we begin to
[1:12:07] focus on certain things and not realize
[1:12:09] what god has done for us
[1:12:11] and seeing those things that take place
[1:12:12] but you know here here
[1:12:14] god told them said listen we're gonna
[1:12:16] they're gonna come out
[1:12:18] and even you know all the things that
[1:12:19] they solve but you know what god never
[1:12:21] forgot what he told abraham
[1:12:23] and you know and then he stood there and
[1:12:25] he spoke to moses in the burning bush
[1:12:27] and he stood there and he said
[1:12:28] he said i've heard the cry of my people
[1:12:31] why because you know he told them hey
[1:12:33] listen they're going to be down there
[1:12:34] they're going to sojourn in a land but
[1:12:36] he says you know what when they get
[1:12:37] tired of being down there
[1:12:38] when things happen you know then they're
[1:12:39] going to cry and i'm going to hear them
[1:12:41] and he said i've come down
[1:12:43] he said i've come down to deliver them
[1:12:45] but he said i'm going to send you
[1:12:48] i anointed you to do that right
[1:12:51] and you know in the in the midst of all
[1:12:53] that and you know it's not like
[1:12:55] the people live in a bubble you know
[1:12:57] because
[1:12:58] you know when when moses was speaking
[1:13:02] you know moses knew what happened to
[1:13:04] abraham
[1:13:05] abraham he knew what happened to isaac
[1:13:07] he knew he knew the scripture
[1:13:09] he knew what happened to the children of
[1:13:11] israel he was he wasn't living you know
[1:13:13] living in a cocoon somewhere he knew
[1:13:14] what took place but you know what when
[1:13:16] god come down and began to speak to him
[1:13:18] then it's like well you know what you're
[1:13:19] going to be the deliverer
[1:13:21] you know many hundreds of years ago i
[1:13:23] spoke to the patriarch abraham
[1:13:25] and told him what was going to take
[1:13:26] place but you know what you're going to
[1:13:27] fulfill that scripture
[1:13:29] you're going to be the one to do that
[1:13:30] and you know many times people say
[1:13:32] you know it's put in the scripture but
[1:13:34] then you know what it becomes you and i
[1:13:35] are going to be god's hands
[1:13:37] we're going to be god's feet we're going
[1:13:38] to be god's mouth we're going to be
[1:13:40] god's eyes and god wants to use you to
[1:13:42] do it
[1:13:43] and sometimes we think you know well you
[1:13:45] know it's going to be it's going to be
[1:13:46] somebody else you know
[1:13:47] it's going to be brother dale or brother
[1:13:49] wade or you know it's going to be
[1:13:50] somebody else
[1:13:51] no sometimes it's going to be you
[1:13:54] no matter how simple you are no matter
[1:13:56] how low you are
[1:13:57] because you know when all of this
[1:13:58] started with joseph joseph was only 17
[1:14:01] years old
[1:14:05] and at 17 years old he entered into the
[1:14:07] will of god and was working the will of
[1:14:09] god
[1:14:11] living in a living in a filthy dungeon
[1:14:14] somewhere but you know it was fulfilling
[1:14:15] the word of god
[1:14:17] that's right and you know and all the
[1:14:19] things that happened to
[1:14:20] to uh moses as as moses was you know put
[1:14:23] in the ark and sit down in the nile
[1:14:25] and it and you know then he raised up in
[1:14:28] pharaoh's house
[1:14:30] what a what you know a great mighty
[1:14:32] intelligent man he was
[1:14:34] that he lived in and you know taught the
[1:14:36] people of
[1:14:37] egypt all these things and what a great
[1:14:39] stature that he had
[1:14:40] and how he was beloved of the pharaoh
[1:14:42] and everything
[1:14:43] but then when it come to time he had to
[1:14:46] run
[1:14:48] why because it wasn't time because he
[1:14:50] tried to fulfill the scripture
[1:14:52] that his mother told him about about
[1:14:54] being the deliverer tried to fulfill
[1:14:56] it on his own he did not wait for god
[1:14:59] but when god come and spoke to him by
[1:15:01] the burning bush and kept telling him
[1:15:03] said now
[1:15:03] after you've sat on the back side of the
[1:15:05] desert for 40 years and i've beat
[1:15:07] all of your ignorant idiocracy out of
[1:15:10] you
[1:15:11] because he became and you know he become
[1:15:13] an educated idiot
[1:15:17] because he thought he was by his
[1:15:18] education he would come to the place
[1:15:19] that he got puffed up that he thought he
[1:15:21] could do
[1:15:21] something didn't take away the position
[1:15:25] that he was the deliverer but the
[1:15:27] problem was he had to get to the place
[1:15:29] where god could use him god wanted to
[1:15:31] meet him and when god met him then it
[1:15:33] was time for him to go
[1:15:35] and but he stood there and said oh oh oh
[1:15:37] god i can't talk you know you know
[1:15:40] you know look at me you know i can't
[1:15:41] talk i don't have a good mouth you know

[1:15:51] got a commission
[1:15:52] it's time for you to go and do this
[1:15:58] and in the midst of that you know he
[1:15:59] don't say well he said we're going to
[1:16:01] send your brother aaron along with you
[1:16:05] but you know he gave him he said listen
[1:16:07] he said they're not gonna believe me
[1:16:08] down there

[1:16:11] you the two signs you're gonna go down
[1:16:13] there and show them
[1:16:14] right and he said you know then he
[1:16:16] started walking down there

[1:18:54] and you know it wasn't just a physical
[1:18:56] abuse that you see that that we talk
[1:18:58] about we we talk about the reason of
[1:19:00] their taskmasters and all those things
[1:19:02] but you know what takes place when you
[1:19:03] go down through there it's to come
[1:19:05] the the all the constant bombardment of
[1:19:08] the mental abuse that you have to deal
[1:19:10] with
[1:19:12] because can you can you imagine them
[1:19:14] coming out there those taskmasters well
[1:19:16] you know what if your god was real you
[1:19:18] wouldn't be in this mess
[1:19:20] i thought you had this great god that
[1:19:22] could do things
[1:19:25] well by our great gods we've got you
[1:19:27] bound and look what you're doing you're
[1:19:29] building these great buildings and
[1:19:30] raising these monuments up to our great
[1:19:32] gods and everything and look what we're
[1:19:34] going what we got going on and
[1:19:36] you know we got all this cheap labor
[1:19:38] going on and
[1:19:39] you know all these type of things that

[1:19:42] god
[1:19:43] god didn't god didn't forget about them
[1:19:46] and they just kept on going they kept
[1:19:48] walking and you know all of a sudden you
[1:19:50] know when it come to the time then
[1:19:51] pharaoh was like well it's time to go
[1:19:54] you know when when god when god got to
[1:19:56] the point where pharaoh was tired
[1:19:59] and he wore him down you know and all
[1:20:00] you know he wanted to get rid of him and
[1:20:02] told him to go yeah
[1:20:04] but you know when when pharaoh was you
[1:20:06] know he he got to the point in
[1:20:08] itself that he was so worked up that you
[1:20:09] know he realized you know well i'm not
[1:20:11] i'm not going to let him go
[1:20:14] you know because you know while if you
[1:20:16] get to that point where
[1:20:18] you leave and and then you see them that
[1:20:20] they're leaving then all of a sudden you
[1:20:21] know
[1:20:22] it was something that was so raised up
[1:20:23] inside him that you know he didn't want
[1:20:24] to be defeated
[1:20:26] he was like well i'm gonna go after him
[1:20:30] well you know moses told them he said
[1:20:33] the ones you see today said you'll see
[1:20:35] them no more
[1:20:37] god brought you through and then you
[1:20:39] know and all the things that god brought
[1:20:40] them through
[1:20:42] brought them to the land opened up the
[1:20:45] red sea they walked through on dry land
[1:20:49] when they got to the place you know oh
[1:20:51] you know how we going to get over this
[1:20:54] no god had a place and had a way to get
[1:20:57] them over
[1:20:58] but then they stood there and they
[1:20:59] watched their enemy destroyed
[1:21:02] in a supernatural way
[1:21:06] all of those standing there watching the
[1:21:08] watching the greatest army in the world
[1:21:10] that great empire
[1:21:11] be destroyed and then you know then they
[1:21:14] couldn't go but you know just
[1:21:17] two three weeks whatever it was a month
[1:21:19] journey
[1:21:21] to the promised land three days journey
[1:21:23] whatever it was you know
[1:21:25] they're out there 40 years walking in
[1:21:26] the same same place
[1:21:28] same thing murmuring and complaining
[1:21:32] god's speaking to them and telling them
[1:21:34] listen you all need to get ready so you
[1:21:36] can go in this land
[1:21:38] and they're still bound to the same
[1:21:40] thing facing the same thing going around
[1:21:42] in the same circle
[1:21:46] going through the same thing and still
[1:21:48] not any further along
[1:21:53] but god brought them through but you
[1:21:55] know
[1:21:57] when they couldn't when they couldn't
[1:21:58] believe and they couldn't walk in what
[1:22:00] god had told them
[1:22:01] then you know what they ended up dying
[1:22:02] in the wilderness but you know what
[1:22:04] there was a promised sea that went in
[1:22:06] and took that land
[1:22:07] that fulfilled the word that that god
[1:22:09] had spoken to abraham
[1:22:12] that god had spoken to him and told him
[1:22:13] what was going to take place
[1:22:16] and god god led him in and god fulfilled
[1:22:18] his word
[1:22:20] and many times you know if we see things
[1:22:22] that we don't understand why things
[1:22:24] happen the way they do in our lives you
[1:22:25] know what just hold on
[1:22:27] god will show you because you know
[1:22:30] you know god will fulfill the word that
[1:22:32] he has for each one of us
[1:22:35] and you know and you know when we see
[1:22:38] these things in our lives
[1:22:39] and we don't understand i want to i want
[1:22:42] to share this with you
[1:22:43] you know when you see these things take
[1:22:45] place don't be disheartened by what you
[1:22:47] see
[1:22:48] you know don't give up by what takes
[1:22:51] place
[1:22:52] because you know when it was so amazing
[1:22:54] because you know when all these things
[1:22:56] took place you know they all looked back
[1:22:57] to the patriarchs
[1:22:59] and said do you remember do you remember
[1:23:02] and even and you know even when you get
[1:23:05] to in the book of acts in the
[1:23:06] in the seventh chapter of acts i believe
[1:23:08] it is when stephen stands up and
[1:23:10] preaches that wonderful message
[1:23:12] to the people and he began to speak of
[1:23:13] the things that took place
[1:23:15] and all the ones that had taken in place
[1:23:17] in the past
[1:23:18] and he stood there and he and he went
[1:23:20] back and he started talking about what
[1:23:21] god had done
[1:23:22] for our father abraham and come all the
[1:23:24] way down and was showing
[1:23:26] all the things and he said you know all
[1:23:27] of them but you know they turned away
[1:23:29] from what god had showed them
[1:23:30] god had told them what was going to take
[1:23:32] place and then y'all turned it down
[1:23:34] and he said and then you know and he
[1:23:35] began to expound all the way through the
[1:23:37] scripture and then stephen got to the
[1:23:39] place and he told y'all circumcised and
[1:23:40] stiff next and he said y'all always
[1:23:42] resist the word you always resist god of
[1:23:45] everything he's had to do
[1:23:48] he said it's the same spirit that was
[1:23:49] out there in the wilderness that would
[1:23:51] stood moses that was stood joshua
[1:23:53] all them y'all are the same ones it's
[1:23:56] the same spirit
[1:23:57] and y'all stand right here and you know
[1:23:58] what they got so mad
[1:24:00] that the scripture says that they
[1:24:02] gnashed their teeth and you know they
[1:24:03] just couldn't wait to get rid
[1:24:04] of to get rid of stephen just like they
[1:24:08] done the deposit
[1:24:09] the prophets and the ones in the old
[1:24:11] testament y'all done the exact same way
[1:24:14] y'all here they are y'all seen all these
[1:24:16] things and y'all just can't wait to get
[1:24:18] rid of them
[1:24:20] and here they are talking about in the
[1:24:22] in the street and stoning
[1:24:25] get out there and stone stephen
[1:24:29] well he sealed his he stole this
[1:24:30] testimony in his own blood but you know
[1:24:32] when he began to say you know i see
[1:24:36] i see jesus standing at the right hand
[1:24:37] of the father you know and you know he
[1:24:39] said
[1:24:39] lord don't lay this to their charge
[1:24:44] that was an amazing that was an amazing
[1:24:46] scene
[1:24:48] and you know there was a man that was
[1:24:50] standing there
[1:24:52] and they they held their coats and he
[1:24:54] was in and he was in
[1:24:56] conspiracy with these people
[1:24:59] and he agreed with them and he stood
[1:25:01] there and they laid their coats at his
[1:25:03] feet
[1:25:05] and you know what was so amazing was
[1:25:07] when you read that in that scripture
[1:25:09] that here here's this man and he saying
[1:25:11] he's standing there watching
[1:25:12] brother stephen get stoned and stephen's
[1:25:15] laying on the ground dying watching
[1:25:17] watching getting his head blasted but
[1:25:19] the last thing that
[1:25:20] stephen has to say is lord don't lay
[1:25:22] this to their charge
[1:25:25] he had so much love and you know who was
[1:25:27] standing there listening to that
[1:25:28] and you know who's who god who stephen
[1:25:31] was calling out for
[1:25:33] do you know who he was called out he was
[1:25:35] calling out for the apostle paul
[1:25:37] paul's standing there listening being
[1:25:39] being a conspirator being an accomplice
[1:25:42] to murder to murder stephen and stephen
[1:25:44] calling out to the apostle paul
[1:25:46] and saying lord don't lay this to his
[1:25:48] charge
[1:25:50] i tell you what i do if i don't stir
[1:25:52] your soul your spoons fell out of your
[1:25:54] bowl
[1:25:55] why because let me tell you something
[1:25:56] brother scissors there's people that
[1:25:58] that you don't know about you don't know
[1:26:00] well you've never seen
[1:26:01] you'll never see on this side of glory
[1:26:03] that have had your name
[1:26:05] and had you in their prayer and you
[1:26:07] don't know who's interceded for you
[1:26:09] and you'll never know who they are but
[1:26:11] they have interceded for you
[1:26:13] and even in the scripture tells us that
[1:26:15] even jesus prayed for us
[1:26:16] and that he interceded to the father on
[1:26:18] our behalf because you know what we're
[1:26:20] going to live in this world but you know
[1:26:21] what
[1:26:22] he said you've given these to me and
[1:26:23] they will overcome
[1:26:26] brothers and sisters we've been given a
[1:26:28] word and you know what we can stand up
[1:26:29] and claim our word
[1:26:30] and because god has said somebody that's
[1:26:32] come and interceded and we haven't had a
[1:26:35] high priest
[1:26:36] that can be touched by the feeling of
[1:26:37] our infirmities and knows
[1:26:39] the struggles and the pains and the
[1:26:40] heartaches that we've been through and
[1:26:42] brothers and sisters we've had somebody
[1:26:44] that's interceded on our behalf
[1:26:45] and he said you know what we are more
[1:26:47] than conquerors through him that loved
[1:26:48] us
[1:26:49] he's given us all things that pertain
[1:26:51] unto life and godliness and you'll be
[1:26:52] given everything
[1:26:53] and you know what brothers and sisters
[1:26:55] all you gotta do is claim it but because
[1:26:57] we've seen
[1:26:57] a great cloud of witnesses that have
[1:26:59] come and have overcome
[1:27:01] all the powers of the darkness and
[1:27:02] they've overcome the enemy and jesus has
[1:27:05] said you know he said
[1:27:06] he has come the prince of this world has
[1:27:09] come
[1:27:09] and he said he has no part in me why
[1:27:12] because i'm
[1:27:13] who have the word and i've come from my
[1:27:15] father and i go to my father and he said
[1:27:17] you and i are the same way brothers and
[1:27:19] sisters we've come from god and we go
[1:27:21] back to god
[1:27:22] we may fall and fail and we may have
[1:27:24] issues and we may have problems but let
[1:27:25] me tell you something brothers and
[1:27:27] sisters we're more than conquerors to
[1:27:28] him that loved us
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:34] god has provided the way and the
[1:27:36] provisions whatever you have nato one
[1:27:38] because he's given us away
[1:27:40] jesus said i am the way the truth and
[1:27:43] the life
[1:27:43] he said none come to the father but by
[1:27:46] me you've been called by god
[1:27:48] and he's brought you into the household
[1:27:50] of faith
[1:27:51] he's he's given you his spirit
[1:27:55] well he didn't give it to you just so
[1:27:56] you can fail
[1:27:59] just so you can live defeated amen but
[1:28:01] he's given you the holy ghost so that
[1:28:03] you'll overcome
[1:28:11] i wanna i wanna live and now i want to
[1:28:13] know what

[1:33:21] jesus be the lord of all
[1:33:27] the kingdoms of
[1:33:30] my heart
[1:33:37] amen god bless you tonight
[1:33:41] i was thinking about i had in my notes i
[1:33:43] didn't get
[1:33:44] but you know in ephesians 4
[1:33:48] the scripture talks about you know he
[1:33:49] gave some apostles and a prophets
[1:33:52] an evangelist and then it continues on
[1:33:54] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:33:58] he says that we henceforth be no more
[1:34:00] children tossed to and fro and carried
[1:34:02] about with every wind of doctrine and
[1:34:04] the slight
[1:34:04] of men and cunning craftiness whereby
[1:34:07] they lie and wait to deceive but
[1:34:08] speaking the truth in love may grow up
[1:34:11] into him in all things which is the head
[1:34:13] even christ for whom the whole body
[1:34:16] fitly joined together compacted by that
[1:34:19] which every joints supply us
[1:34:23] and you know you know many times when we
[1:34:25] think about things you know
[1:34:27] it's no there's no big eyes there's no
[1:34:29] little use
[1:34:30] every part is important but that's the
[1:34:34] reason he says
[1:34:34] the in the whole body everything works
[1:34:36] together i think
[1:34:38] but you know the scripture there where
[1:34:39] it says and compacted
[1:34:41] that which every joint supply you know
[1:34:44] that's a that's a tight-knit group
[1:34:45] compacted
[1:34:48] you know that's the reason that when
[1:34:49] brother and talked about in
[1:34:51] in the message to the church you know he
[1:34:53] talked about
[1:34:54] you know he said the brother had the
[1:34:56] dream of the armor and he said you
[1:34:57] cinched it up
[1:34:58] everybody get closer together
[1:35:01] you know we have to be draw closer to
[1:35:03] one another
[1:35:05] in him he draws us close closer together
[1:35:08] according to the fetch
[1:35:09] effectual working in the measure of
[1:35:12] every part maketh
[1:35:13] increase of the body unto the edifying
[1:35:16] of itself in love
[1:35:18] so everything that we do
[1:35:22] we should realize we do unto the lord
[1:35:24] but you know it's to edify the body
[1:35:28] so it's not just everybody on an island
[1:35:33] every little thing that we do we do
[1:35:35] under the lord but everything
[1:35:37] is for the edification of the body
[1:35:40] every little thing we come to church
[1:35:44] you know it's to edify at one another
[1:35:47] everything that we do
[1:35:49] is to bless one another
[1:35:52] you know so there is no you know
[1:35:55] insignificant
[1:35:56] ones if you're not here we miss you
[1:36:00] if you're sick we feel for you
[1:36:04] if you're hurt
[1:36:08] everybody's the same that's wrong
[1:36:12] just like he said he said we ought to be
[1:36:15] close enough to one another
[1:36:16] chew each other's chewing gum like i've
[1:36:19] always said everybody says i want to
[1:36:21] chew it first i told him i said when the
[1:36:22] lord tells me to chew your chewing gum
[1:36:24] my will
[1:36:25] god ain't never told me to chew your gum
[1:36:27] but i don't mind if he tells me do it
[1:36:28] i'll do it
[1:36:31] i mean i don't i just i just have that
[1:36:33] much confidence but i don't know why he
[1:36:35] would want me to but if i need to i will
[1:36:38] but i want to be that willing that that
[1:36:40] if i need to i can
[1:36:43] well god bless you nada appreciate each
