statement sure it's good to be back in the house of the Lord with with all of you and we we really did miss you we missed you a lot and it's good to be back and so good to see Chris to have Christian and his family here and we just saw them a couple weeks ago I think it was a couple weeks ago just uh just around the bend um it's so good to see everybody smiling faces um we're going to read uh tonight from Luke chapter 7 verse 36. and it'll just be a quick scripture read Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word again Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll just bless the service tonight Lord as we go to here Lord we certainly Lord we haven't come to see any any particular person Lord but we've come to see you Lord and as we look into your word I pray Lord that you'll open up the eyes of our heart Lord Jesus so that we can see you more plainly give us give us Faith increase our faith Lord build us up Lord God so that we can we can have have more power in this age Lord Jesus will we ask their blessing upon the word and blessing upon your people Lord the night that you'll just bless the service and bless us Gathering Together We ask in your name amen I want to take a topic tonight just talk about supper at Simon's house and read Luke chapter 7 verse 36 if they can go ahead and bring that up and it says and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and you maybe see that the Lord is Blessing to the reading of the word of course now that I think this is a story that we're all pretty familiar with and probably for me with how brother Branham told it but um tonight just want to kind of rehash some of these things and and talk about the difference between this um you know brother Brown I'm really exposed the difference between Simon the one the Pharisee that invited Jesus over to his house and then that little woman that kneeled down at his feet and washed his feet with her hair and poured out uh opened up that Alabaster Box and pulled that oil out and poured all over his feet now that's a striking difference between those two people there and you think about how that this Pharisee invited uh Jesus to Simon Jesus was invited to Simon's house Simon the Pharisee and what a strange thing that would be for a Pharisee to invite Jesus over to his house and that's what brother Branham would explain when he was preaching to us he said there's something wrong here a Pharisee wanting to see Jesus and having to eat with him for Fellowship the Pharisees hated Jesus they had no use for him at all he was a bl's above to them a devil a deceiver and no Pharisee had anything to do with Jesus he said the Pharisees set themselves against him because it didn't cope with their theologies and you know you really think about the position that the Pharisees had got you know they were trying they were trying to do what was right but they had gotten so wound up in their uh they're trying to adhere to their set of standards and things and in the commentary of their rabbis that they had made that they got away from the what Jesus would would Frame Up that the bear the essentials of just people do you love one another are you being good to one another do you love God and they had gotten away so caught up and and tithing mint and cumin and all those different things that they had just forgot the the real essence of what the the uh uh a good walk with faith in God should be and and Jesus would often refer to a Pharisee as a as a faker an actor what a horrible thing to be a faker somebody's just putting on uh you know you go through all the scriptures and you can see the things that brother Branham talked about and the things that Jesus talked about that a faker is just about the worst thing that you can be that just uh you know so many times brother random would say how that we want to see real genuine something real Gene that's what the world is looking for that that's what God is looking for that's what we're looking for when we come to church we want to see something that's real genuine not a not a faker now now uh if you look online you'd see the definition of a hypocrite a hypocrite as anyone who makes out like they have higher standards or beliefs than they really do that a Pharisee would be a real a real good hip example of a hypocrite somebody that says that they uh they make they've got all these rules and things that you've got to adhere to all these weights that they can pile on your head and things that you've got to do but yet when it comes down to it they won't they won't even live up to it themselves think about the state of mind you would have to be at to look at somebody healing somebody on the Sabbath and say well there's something wrong with that uh you have to be twisted in your mind and you know that's what the devil does is the devil will anoint somebody and until their eyes have been just covered over us well they can't really see the real truth of the thing and I thank God that in this last day you know brother Brown always told that story of how that that his mama would come and rub the grease on his eyes to open him up so that he could really see I think in his last day I thank God that that we've heard a message to open up our eyes so that to tear tear the veil of what the devil has put over our eyes so that we can really see things as they really are and and not just not just see the word but to really see ourselves as we really are I think it behooves us to constantly be examining ourselves examining our motives examining our objectives to see to see if our lives are matching up with what the word says because I I I don't want anything to be fake about me and I know that you can have the same confession tonight that we don't we don't want to be fake we don't want to be actors and we don't want anything even remotely similar to what uh these stories that we read about the Pharisees and all Balaam Judas everybody in the Bible we don't want to have any any characteristics similar to those at all so another example of a hypocrite they might tell you to do something one way and then ignore their own advice and do the opposite now Jesus when he was talking about hypocrites he would always say things like like he would use examples about how being real clean on the outside but on the inside being real filthy and he'd say woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make the clean of the outside of the cup of the platter you might clean the outside of the cup of the platter but when they're full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also and another example he'd use was the widest sepicles white beautiful on the outside but full of dead men's Bones on the inside full of dead men now now let's just pause a second and really think about that now to to think now God there's these two extremes where you can be a real genuine Christian or you can be a real genuine unbeliever but right there in the middle is is just a mess of fields somebody that on the outside they look like a real genuine look pretty good but on the inside they're they're they got dead men's bones they're just it's just a terrible on the inside and that's the danger ground that God does not want us to be in in Revelation chapter 3 he said I Know Thy Works speaking of the layout of sea and age Thou Art neither cold nor hot you haven't gone to either one or one side or the other you know you hadn't gotten real hot for God and you hadn't gotten real cold you're just right there in the middle he said I would thou were cold or hot now what's up what can we take away from this tonight is that the religious fence where you're on the fence and you hadn't committed yourself one way or the other that that is the worst place that you can be oh tonight if you ain't picked a side if you hadn't declared which side you're going to be on maybe tonight can be the side where you say I'm going to sell out for God I'm gonna what what what are we talking about tonight we're talking about Pride I'm ready to lay it down all of my pride and lay down all of my self-wheel and all of my everything that I am and give it all to Jesus oh if you can come like that and do like that little woman that just humbled herself at Jesus feet and just poured out everything and broke the bottle that's that's the way that God wants us to come to him no but if you're on the fence that's the worst place that you you can be the fence is it that's that's that's the most terrible horrible place that you can be to be an actor to be a faker to come amongst the Assembly of God and say well I I I'm acting like a Christian I may be taking communion doing the things that everybody else is doing paying tithes but on the inside your dead men's bones there's something corrupt there's something cankered on the inside and on the inside your character hadn't been changed you still want to do the things of the world you don't really love God the way that you want to you ought to the way that he he he's telling you you you should but there's something that still Longs for the things of the world oh there's a there's a gospel there's a there's a word that can take all of that out I thank God tonight that that God give us a gospel that can change our nature and change our character so that we can be like him so that we can walk like him and talk like him and so that we don't have to live like the world I I thank God that that's what this message does to a real genuine believer is change them so that they ate like they used to be and brother Brandon would say he'd say you can tell now think about this Pharisee why was it so strange that this Pharisee wanted Jesus to come into his house it was strange because you can tell where you could tell where you are you can tell where you are spiritually by what you're attracted to you can tell where you are spiritually by who you hang around what kind of friends you associate what kind of music you listen to and what kind of literature you read and what's hanging on your wall and what's on your computer you can tell because like attracts to like and that's why it's very odd for this Pharisee to want Jesus in his home because at Pharisee was not like Jesus it's very odd that this Pharisee wanted Jesus in his home now brother Ryan would say a seven or eight-year-old girl likes to print play around with little children her age why because like attracts like a a little a little child is going to want to play around with other little children not not with Granny or something not granny might be able to show him how to how to uh quilt or something like that but most of the time a seven or eight year little girl she don't want to have nothing to do because that's human nature and there ain't nothing wrong with that that's just how things how how we're made we want to be around people that are like us and what's the point he's getting at it a Christian is going to want to be around a Christian and an unbeliever is going to want be around want to be around an unbeliever he said if she follows Grandma all the time now it's either that Grandma's real good to her or she's grandma's little pet young people like to go with young people young people like to hang out with young people little children playing in the streets they have things in common they're dolls and their tops and their hobby horses and things little children associate with little children children young girls associate with young girls the middle-aged women with the middle age the old with the old heart you never see crows and doves hanging out together oh to think about that that you can if we can examine ourselves and see what kind of people do I like to hang out with do I like to hang out with weed smokers and pot smokers and people that are passing around dirty pictures and stuff no because that ain't my that doesn't match up with my character and the same thing if you really examine yourself and find out what you like what you hang around with the kind of friends that you have the kind of people that you associate with the kind of people that you talk to on Instagram or Facebook the kind of friend groups that you have it will show it will put on display the kind of person you are or if you like to sit around and you talk about talk about the word and you want to you want to hear somebody tell you about the gospel and how God changed them and testify that shows the kind of person you are why because it's putting your character on display your character yeah that's the only thing that you're going to leave this world with is your character so I want to make sure that my care character's right I want to let go of all the pride and all the stuff that you can accumulate in this world all the things that can get built up and let go of everything anything that'll hinders me lay aside all the wastes so easily beset you and build up something that's Everlasting something oh God I want you to build up joy and peace and something to stay with you forever and ever and you can know what you've been building up because you can look at what you're attracted to her crow and a dove is two different kinds of bird birds that one has one thing and the other has the other brother Brandon would say a crow doesn't like what a dove likes a crow does not like what a dove likes or a crow can try to be like a dove all at once but it just can't it just can't eat the same stuff same stuff that it does can a crow can't a crow can't love like a dove can a Coke can't forgive like a dove can a crow can't believe like a dove can a crow just can't do it cause it ain't in him it ain't in him to believe and they need him to serve God and they did him to love God with all the sitting because his character hasn't been changed but you take a real genuine dullness forsaking all the world forsaking everything that it is I want to put on a real Dove character that's on display said a hypocrite an imposter he can go to the world and affiliate with the world and act like the world and live in the world and enjoy the pleasures of the world and come to church and pretend to be a Christian but the real Christian can't go out into the world and come back there's something wrong there's something wrong you you want to be what is it tonight Church you want to be around people like you you want to be around people that love God you want to be around people that'll talk about the word you want to be around Christians because you are a Christian if you are a Christian tonight and if you're not a Christian tonight there's a simple remedy for that he said come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden he said he all you got to do is look to him like they look to the Brass serpent in the wilderness oh you got to look to him it's a simple remedy if we just humble ourselves and lay aside our pride show me your company I'll tell you who you are show me your diet I'll tell you your nature it's hard for a Christian to stay in rock music now you you and I know we all know that when you go to to Walmart or or whatever story you'd like to go to or you're sitting down for maybe some burritos at the at the Mexican restaurant and they start playing that rock music something just twinges it it there's something something off kilter because a Christian don't like something like that a Christian wouldn't be able to stay in the club with their music in their dress a Christian wouldn't be able to stand a bad environment there's things that a Christian don't an unbeliever don't won't mind it an unbeliever likes that and they're drawn to it but a Christian that's not if you you can't draw that through a thinking man's filter so it's been filtered out by the Holy Ghost and your your desires and everything has been changed showed me your diet and I'll tell you your nature and second Corinthians Paul said be not unequally yoked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship path of righteousness with unbelievers and with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness in James chapter 4 he said he adult and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God to even be friends with the world to like the things that are in the world in First Corinthians chapter 15 he said be not deceived the evil Communications corrupt good manners it matters who your friends are matters what you listen to how you talk it matters in Ephesians chapter 5 it says have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them it matters who you hang around with it matters who your friends are it matters what you're attracted to right brother Adam said let me go into your house and see what you read let me listen to the to the kind of music you have playing let me see what kind of literature you read let me look in your office and see if it's a big bunch of these vulgar pictures of Pinups and things and you tell me you're Christian I won't say nothing to you but in my heart I will watch what kind of fruit you're bearing see because that's your diet your fruit your life tells you what you are amen there's just something in a dove that wants to be around other doves there's something in a crow that wants to be around other crows why is that because it's it's nature nature your character wants to be around other things that are like you but many times people try to do they try to fake their character like that Pharisee a Pharisee is an actor an actor is going to act you know what brother Brown would use that example of people people they go to the movie theater and they see somebody on the on the movie that they they want to emulate and then they start trying to act like that well that's the same way a lot of people try to do with Christianity they go to church and they they like the way a lot of people do and they like the way they dress so they want to act but without getting a character change on the inside oh you you see if you just act it out but there's something wrong on the inside dead men's Bones on the inside a pot that admin washed but it's clean on the outside but it's not clean on the inside then oh it just messes everything up because you're not genuine you're acting and he would use that example of you know somebody trying to trying to act like they're a good singer and they train their voice up real good until they can warble real good but he said he said when they're all done everybody's Minds on the note that they were singing instead of all worshiping God I I I think we could all agree tonight that I I love a song that's sung from a real Christian heart that's resonating from a real Christian experience somebody that's a real Christian believe like a little special we heard tonight somebody that's singing from an experience not from some put on something but they're singing from a place that they were at and where God brought them from and they're singing from something that's resonating for a whale or bubbling up from the inside not from something that they're trying to act out like a a blackbird trying to put peacock feathers in you know brother bear said birds of a feather flock together and you know some of the most beautiful outside Birds there he is are scavengers it's the inside that counts oh to think about that that some of the most beautiful birds that you could look at in the wild are are scavengers are are birds that can just eat anything they're pretty on the outside but what are they on the inside and he would say house Angels Road Devils putting on also think about what a statement house Angels Road Devils putting on he said oh my deliver me from being an actor be what you are God will bless you oh see why it's so important for preachers to just be genuine be there who they are not try to emulate anybody for singers to just sing sing what the way that God wanted them to sing and not try to emulate anybody else everybody just do the way everybody's been they were born with a with a with a gift the way that God wanted them to be made up and if we'll just be genuinely that everything can work in a way that will prosper the church you'll never be able to fake a Christian Life you'll you you gotta you gotta have a nature change to live this life to think about that you look at some people sometimes and you could just tell that they're just trying to fake up something but you'll never be able to fake it you can't fake it you gotta have a nature change you can learn how to be a dove and stick Dove feathers in but only a real Dove can be a dove only a real Dove can be a dove and Jesus said in Matthew chapter 7 and many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity fakers fakers that thought that they were genuine because some spiritual things happen in their life maybe they saw a dream or maybe they maybe they even had a vision or maybe they could kind of understand some things or keep up but yet down on the inside they didn't have a change and that's what we're preaching on tonight is pride pride is what keeps you from having a change pride is what will prevent you from progressing with the Lord Pride like that Pharisee there Pharisee where you're unwilling to just let go and let God have his way huh you think about brother Adam would say that Simon signed the Pharisees sent a little flunky to go find Jesus and Jesus was all tired and sweaty and going all over Palestine and this funky went elbowing through the crowd and staggering along and he finally got to and you know brother Brandon was telling this story and he's all through the story he would say I see I see and I now I wonder if he really could see this flunky bumping up into Andrew in the crowd and he said I see Andrew taking him up close to where Jesus was where the sick and all was around he said Master here is a young man from Southern Palestine who has come with a message he's come a long way and he says it's from his master and he wishes to speak to you and to think now we'd have said what would we have said we'd said Master don't go to that hypocrite to stay away from him but Jesus will accept any invitation he said Jesus will always go where he's invited oh to think about that tonight that you've got a promise that you'll if you'll just invite him into your heart and just open up the door of your heart he'll he'll always go where he's invited the Bible says in James chapter 4 draw not a God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts you double-minded and what is a double-minded man a man that can't not make up his mind between being cold or hot can't make up his mind what side of the fence he's going to sit on he's right there in the middle of the fence but we can't make up his mind which way he's gonna go oh but if you're double-minded cleanse your hands and draw not a god and brother Ram would say that Courier ran away after he had delivered his message and he missed his opportunity tonight I I if we could just kind of think about that why why did the Rich Young Ruler leave feeling sad why did the rich the Rich Young Ruler had his opportunity all Jesus disciples when Jesus began to preach Doctrine they turned their back on him but they had their opportunity so many people had their opportunity in the Bible Jesus never breaks a promise he always keeps his promise regardless of what it is so he was going to he was when he promised he was going to Simon's house he was going to be there because Romans chapter 2 verse 11 says there is no respect of persons with God I I thank God that there's no respect of persons with God he doesn't care if you're rich or poor he doesn't care if if you've been in church for 40 years or two minutes if you come to God with faith believing amen he will come where he's invited they got everything ready for the feast all of them in there entertain and so forth and Pharisee was having such a great time entertaining a celebrity brother Brown said the first thing you know Jesus arrived went into the house and sat down and they didn't know he was there this Pharisee was a rich man he could really put a big dinner on that like like let the poor stand and gape on if they wanted to that's the group that would tear up the world to make one proselyte out of a gentile and make him a two-fold more child of Hell than he was when he began what was it and brother Ram would say Pride pomp there he is Jesus sitting there forsaken Pride Palm oh paint this picture in your mind Jesus sitting there in the corner and a Pharisee should have been part of the most religious group of the day should have known to just humble himself at God revealed in flesh but brother Adam said it was Pride pomp and he said pride is such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride now let's take a step back and think about what pride is brother would say way back in the beginning when God made Man In His Image Genesis 1 26 27 he said God made angels and and those ain't some of the Angels fell and they became fall on the spirits who could come and anoint you to influence your life and some of those Spirits he would he would he would go through the seven that were cast off of Mary Magdalene Pride boast uh lust variants all the different things that he listed out all of those all of those things there were spirits to influence you and he would say that's what pride is to think that a a person could be influenced by an evil spirit to make them act a certain way to influence them to act a certain way pride pride search accursion things so awful so evil it is it he said what a horrible curse pride is pride is when you say oh you're too good I'm too good to think now Saul fell because of Pride Judas fell because of Pride he thought he knew a better way to do it than than Jesus when he looked and he saw this little woman falling down at Jesus feet the Bible says from that moment he started going in a different direction Judas failed by transgression by the love of money and the pride of life is what brother Bradley said and he said oh what a horrible little black Devils is all pinned up in that heart of Pride thinking you're better than somebody else oh to think about how horrible that is to think that you're better than somebody else now we just come through uh the sixth month of the year which the world has designated pride month to think about what a horrible thing in the six month that month of man that that that designate carved that outside to celebrate pride and here brother random is explaining what an evil thing pride is to elevate yourself up to where you look down on somebody else and think that you're even greater than the word of God what is pride pride is the reason that is so hard to face our mistakes when we've got a problem and that the preaching of the word Goes Forth and gets begins to hit that the pride will rise up within us and say if it's there Pride will say oh well you you you start making excuses and start making reasons why it doesn't apply to you pride is the reason that it's hard to own up to our own failings pride is why it's so hard to say I'm sorry a proud father won't be able to tell his family won't be able to tell his wife or his two children that he's sorry that thing that rises up when they when they mention when they mention people and and thanks or whatever pride is why somebody can't say I love you I forgive you oh man come on now you all don't draw up on me I'm preaching about life y'all don't scare me tonight Pride will raise up when somebody suggests a different way why don't we go this way and a pride will rise up pride pride what is pride pride is the reason we get offended well so many times we want to make excuses for being offended but the reason we get offended is because of Pride we think that we're above being preached on or above somebody trying to correct us or above even maybe somebody making fun of us the reason that we get offended when somebody makes fun of us is because of Pride it's Pride but the Bible says in Matthew chapter 11 blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me that was a forgotten beatitude you're blessed if you will not be offended at the gospel you're blessed if you can go into Walmart and not be offended when people laugh at you like they did when we were coming back from from Kentucky and people openly there was a group of people in the store you'd hardly believe this sitting here that openly left in the store and my little family because they wore dresses but we're not offended at that I thank God that I got a little family that's got enough backbone that can walk proudly through the store and not be offended because they're dressing like a Christian and living a holy life in Proverbs Chapter 13 it says only by Pride cometh contention if you want to have a good fight get proud and not listen to somebody else that's trying to help you out only by Pride cometh condension but with the well-advised is wisdom and Proverbs chapter 16 it said pride pride goeth Before Destruction and in holy spirit before a fall and pride pride is why people offend pride is why we're nastier than one another pride is why because we think we know A Better Way pride is why Balaam tried to sway the children of Israel because he thought he knew a better way than God himself pride is why people offend and in Matthew chapter 18 it says whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in be it or better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he would drowned in the depth of the sea it would have been better for Balaam to never even try to offend the children of Israel than to lay a stumbling block in front of them that would cause those little sheep to stumble oh you think it's easy to offend a little sheep a little sheep is a sheep it's got the character of her sheep it's not going to strike back but brother Brian said in in Revelation chapter 10 I actually pulled this from the notes for that sermon that I didn't get to he said what that this scripture means is not do them any harm just even to bring a fence to them just upset them about something it'd be better that you had your own self drowned or had never been born on the Earth than even to bring an offense to one another word youth really think that one of these little children of God the least of them in the Kingdom of Heaven is the Tabernacle of God that God has dwelling them in in that little and that little person so you're better you're better off dead than to put a stumbling block in front of that person it'd be better off dead than to take a little a little a little child of God and say well it's so it's okay to to drink some wine and then you see that person get pulled over with a DUI or get thrown in prison overnight their life ruin is better better for you to die it'd be better off dead than to put a little stumbling block in front of a Believer like that you're better off dying a horrible death than to cause a little believer to stumble to trip and fall to call somebody to shirk their spiritual Duty to seduce somebody to immorality to speak evil to give a little a little a little sheep to give them some drugs get them caught up in something you're better off dead where brother I'm said when you find a believer that really believes with signs following and you see the humility of their life not an impersonator know that they are a Christian a real genuine article just keep still thing you ought to do is join right up with them start moving along cause you're moving right up the King's Highway oh that's what the world wants is to see a real genuine believer somebody that can humble themselves and not be lifted up with pride in Hebrews chapter 10 it says let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works to think this this afternoon that your life can be an influence and your words can be an example to provoke one another your actions can set a path humble people will restrain themselves from offending others humble people are eager to forgive humble people recognize their weakness humble people reject honor as unworthy servants oh if we could just humble ourselves so far down that you can receive a true rebuke from the least little Christian all right brother man Pride is inflated sense of self-worth what is pride I've got to write I'm better I'm sufficient I'm sufficient in my own my own doings like Balaam and Judas Pride what is pride how you feel about that thing that you don't want Jesus to touch now that's why we're getting real quiet this afternoon because we've all got things that we just we feel like are off limits maybe I'm hitting on something that tonight you feel like is off limits but it ain't off limits to God because God wants us to mold us into his image that Romans 8 29 says you were predestinated to be conformed to the image of God of the Son of God and so if you want to be conformed to the image of God there's always things that got to be shaved off and one of them things has got to be shaved off as our pride all to exactly if we could really examine ourselves and examine our motives and as we're doing things and going through life and and and and things things hit us and prank us the wrong way if we can realize what that is that that's something that we need to get rid of all that we can keep moving up toward that Capstone on Pride will make you self-centered Pride will make you you you're when your knees and your desires and your achievements have to have priority you're you want the focus to be on you Pride will make you boastful where you got to have constant validation and recognition oh when you gotta have got to get all them likes on Facebook or ministers have to have a bunch of people Pat them on the back after they preached a sermon what do we need validation for our confidence should come from the word of God we shouldn't need constant validation constant recognition Pride will make you not care about others well you can't see somebody else's Viewpoint they won't be willing to sit down across the table from them and talk to him Pride will make you resent others that threaten your position or threaten where you are Pride will bristle Up when somebody says something you don't like Pride says I more than find the way that I am the way that I am is good enough Judas and Balaam and Cain the way that I am is good enough it's going to be my way or the highway Pride will make you treat somebody differently based on how they treat you in Proverbs chapter 28 it says to have respective persons is not good for for a piece of bread that man will transgress to have respective persons you know what that means that means if somebody pass you on the back you treat him real good somebody doesn't tell you they like you then you treat them bad but oh that's that's something we got to get rid of everybody's got to be treated the same isn't that what Billy Paul said the greatest Miracle he ever saw was his dad you could not tell who his enemy was and who he loved or you know you couldn't tell that's the kind of life that I want to live is where you can't tell not to be a respecter of persons Pride will have you going out every way for to get some popularity in James chapter 2 it says if you fulfill the law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well but if ye have respected persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law as transgressors if you have respect to persons because of pride Pride will make you seek out popularity Pride will make you seek out the claps on the back Pride will keep you from raising your hand in church Pride will keep you from saying amen and pride will keep you from really worshiping the way that God wants you to worship oh you ever watch an evangelist come through and he'll get he'll get somebody to really break through what are they breaking through that Pride they're breaking through where they just don't care about what anybody else thinks and that's when something begins to happen it didn't something happen when that little woman got down at Jesus feet and brother Ryan said she got out of order she got out of order when she broke that oil all over Jesus feet and something happened what happened maybe she didn't some a great big light or something didn't appear but I tell you what she did get she got her sins forgiven oh you get out of order and get get rid of all that Pride a little bit something's going to happen you'll get your sins forgiven and you'll find out your character and your Nature's been changed and you're not acting like a crow anymore you're acting like a dove because God will do something for you when you lay down your pride lay down all that stuff that that's keeping you from from being a real Christian brother I'm gonna say Pride feels just like a little just a little complex you have oh you don't want Jesus to touch that because it would degrade your social standing in the community I'd rather degrade my social standing in the community than to rub my name off of the Lamb's Book of Life but they won't let him in that little pride holds him out oh you see how bad that pride is a devil it's an evil spirit and that's the thing that's keeping him keeping a lot of us from having a real blessing is pride it's the thing that keeps the spirit from breaking loose in the church it's Pride it's it keeps the thing that keeps us from really fellowship and with them one another is pride respected persons to one another our fellowship with this person because I like him but not with this one because he's he's got something that I don't really like brother said you want to look like the Joneses you want to act like your neighbor but God wants you to act like his child and get away from that pride and I don't care how much you draw up on me tonight I'm going to preach it I don't care how much you sleep tonight I'm gonna preach it because we've got to get away from that Pride if we wake up we'll see what God wants for us to receive in this hour he said Pride pump there he is Jesus said and forsaken why was he sitting there forsaken because of pride he said there said Jesus with dirty feet oh it does something to me when I say it Jesus unnoticed unnoticed Jesus with dirty feet made a gaze in stock after being invited he said they stroll the streets and young ladies go forth with flowers and they bouquet the sidewalks and hang down the flags with every sign of welcome but when Jesus comes to town he has to stay in a little Mission somewhere because crazy Holy Roller oh my Jesus them feet that will soon to be pierced for the sins of the world set with dust and dung uncomfortable I want to ask us ourselves tonight would you be willing to make him comfortable would you be willing to do something for Jesus now I'll tell you you know you go around to different churches and things and I think one of the one of the most uncomfortable things is to go to a church and nobody will come up and greet you and nobody will say something to you I I uh I'll just say recently this is probably a terrible testimony for a preacher to say but I actually avoided a church going to a church because I had been there in the past and it just was such an uncomfortable experience it was it was it's terrible when you go somewhere and out to think about Jesus sitting over there in that corner when the party was going on and everybody's laughing and joking and everything and nobody would go talk to him nobody would go humble themselves to think now would you be willing to wash Jesus feet or would you be afraid somebody will see now see what a what a strange thing it is that even in this day and hour that we're living in people are afraid ashamed to wash one another's feet in communion but Jesus said Peter saith unto him when they were washing feet Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus answered him if I watched thee not thou has no part with me why did Jesus wash feet because he was showing our example of humility show it to the god of the universe the god that had created ten thousand worlds and solar systems and universes was willing to get down at the feet of another disciper and washes his dirty feet that were caked with the mud and the filth of the of the of the of the road pride pride always wants the highest Place Pride always wants the best for themselves Pride always wants to lift up but humility humility will take what it can get now there's the real definition of what humility is humility is going to take if all you can get is crumbs that's that's what I'm going to get if you could be like that Greek woman and say I'm gonna take some like the seraphenician woman I'll take the crumbs if that's all I can get if you can be like Lazarus Lazarus the Bible says that he was he slept in the gate and the dogs come and licked his wounds and he was sitting there eating crumbs with the dogs if that's all you can get in humility that's what you're going to get humility humility is going to take what you can get from one another that's why the Bible says why not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded sometimes things don't go your way sometimes things are different but in humidity you're just going to take what you can give brother Brown would say the flunk he meets you at the door and the Palestinian in the Eastern country and it goes goes to one of the wells and draws them a good Great Basin a good clear water and he removes your sandal or your shoes set your feet up across his knee and washes all this dirt and dust and dung and stuff off your body and then he takes another towel and wipes your feet and he washes them sets them down and then he takes your sandals and sets them up on a little mantel like sets them along like this at the door of entrance then he goes over and he finds a pair of fine satin silk slippers they're soft that's the compliments of the host he does that he has them sitting there he put them upon your feet until he finds one that fits you comfortably then he passes you into another place and then there's a man meets you there at the door and he's got a little Basin in his hand a little picture like and you take it and pour some of the oil in your hands and now that oil is made of very fine spigner and now speak nerd is made from this plant that they take it and they grind it up into powder and all you think about the type there that they grind it up into powder just like Christ was ground up for us and well as he died from the cross and he said there's a bush that grows in Arabia this this spicner this oil was so expensive brother Brown would said how did Brother Brown know how much that she spent for his she spent 180 Denari on that oil now normally in those times a 300 Denari a year was the average wage so that's a lot of money and that's why Judas got so been out of shape and pride looking at I think it it tells us in the Bible that he said why couldn't that oil be sold and given to the poor the money be given to the poor he's speaking out of Pride not understanding what was really happening here so many times we fail to understand what's happening because we look at this at the situation out of pride man now Jesus brother round was explaining the situation that this story he said the rich didn't want him the clean didn't want him the religious law Keepers didn't want him but while he was sitting there on the outside in the street there was a real bad woman in the town a prostitute then James chapter 4 verse 6 it says God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto them God doesn't want somebody proud all proud lifted up they're not going to be able to find their way to him in James chapter 4 it says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up that's how you want it that's how you go higher is get as low as you can now I I know sometimes it seems like we're just kind of harping on these things get as low as you can but that's because it works you get as low as you can and not try to lift yourself up and God will be the one to lift you up Proverbs 11 says when Pride come with income with shame but with the lowly as wisdom the lowly somebody that'll just be like a little sheep and allow themselves to be led that's why Jesus said my sheep hear my voice sheep not some wild animal not a Theron Beast that can't be tamed can't be trained but just a little sheep in Proverbs 21 and high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin now that's the kind of woman that came that that saw Jesus through the window or through the door of the lattice or saw him sitting there with somebody that uh despite her background she she was willing to Humble herself and get out of order and as brother Brian will explain do whatever it took to get to Jesus oh if we can just do if we can have that kind of perseverance that's why he preached that message perseverance if you if you're willing to do whatever it takes and not stop seeking not stop reading not stop coming to church not stop until you get an answer from God you'll find something will happen come on now now to think now this little woman was a prostitute she had a horrible background a terrible background and maybe around the room tonight we could say we've we've got similar backgrounds but brother Brown would say you say brother Brad I'm an I'm no prostitute he said I don't all together mean sexually prostitutions on a higher level you can Pro no think about this now you can prostitute your time you can prostitute your own selfish motives going around saying well I belong to this church I'm better the holy spirit will speak to your heart and you'll say I want nothing to do with that now if you can prostitute your time you can prostitute yourself to material possession and wealth consuming all of your focus you can prostitute yourself to celebrity culture you can prostitute yourself to the entertainment of the world you can prostitute yourself to power and success what good does it do if you got money in the bank and don't have God but you know if you're that kind of a prostitute where you've sold out you're who the gospel was for the gospel was for the broken and the miserable and the destitute I'm so glad that we can testify of how God delivered us I'm so glad that we can testify of what God can do to somebody with a miserable messed up life and I I want to say to you tonight that no matter what your past is Jesus can change your future just like he changed the woman at the whale's future just like he changed this little woman's future when she rose up there to think that all of her sins all the things that she had done when she rose up from there her sins were forgiven too right yeah let me skip he I hit I really don't want to keep everybody late tonight I know I know it's Wednesday night Psalm chapter 34 says the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit Psalm 51 says oh Lord open up open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight us not and burn offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart oh God thou Wilt not despise not to think that that little woman coming through looking looking for Jesus noticing that he would have been forsaken nobody wasn't tend into him that that is what God wants is a broken Torah of heart somebody that's been through some stuff I think if we look back in our lives we can all remember when we were down in the valley down going in the midst of the Brick Kiln sitting on the ash sheet whatever you would say and that's where God allows us sometimes to get to those places because he wants us he wants us to get to a place where our hearts broken so that he can use us and he said the first thing you know she finds herself rubbing his feet rubbing his feet and the tears just pouring down he said sparkling water coming from her heart there set that alabaster box and the first thing you know in her hysterical condition her hair fell down the curls dropped down and before she knew it she had her hair a wiping his feet with a hair that was on her head he said what a mess what a mess I thank God for messy preaching amen amen thank God for messy praise I'm so glad tonight for a messy religion thank God for a mess yes when you were born of the water and the blood you you come through a mess thank God for messy births it's a mess thank God for messy prayer why is it a mess tonight as we'll be closing here in just a moment why is it a mess because all your Pride's gone your pride you laid that Pride down and you're willing to do like that little woman whatever it takes to get through and pushing through everybody going and standing at the judgey Pharisee selling her that all over the counter judging her as she leaves people said as she left that little store people were pointing at her and and wondering what she did in that store judge you judgey judgy but it's a mess it's a mess to get to Jesus it's a mess when something happens it's a mess where you can where you can let go of your pride and let go of your order and let go of your starch and just love God just love God then it's a mess he said she wasn't caring what them Pharisees was saying he said did Jesus draw back his feet and say you mustn't do that no sir he perfectly held Steel and all these things happened and then finally Jesus spoke and we'll end on this as the musicians come forward it says in verse 39 when the Pharisee which had bitten him saw it he spake within himself this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what manner of man woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner Jesus answered and said unto him Simon I got something to say unto you and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 Pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most Simon answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou has rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon see a style this woman I entered into thine house thou gave us me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gave us me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with oil I'll just not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment wherefore I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she loved much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven now you think about that that because she was willing to lay her Pride down her sins were forgiven I think as we stand to our feet I think it's such a striking thing to note at the end of that sermon when brother Ram preached the message Pride he pulled and he pulled and he preached his heart out and he had a little altar call and he asked anybody that was willing to lay their pride down to stand to their feet and he preached and he preached and he preached at the end of that sermon he said I look everywhere and I don't see one standing not one person at the end of that sermon was willing to lay down their pride Lord Jesus we thank you tonight Lord Jesus for your grace and for your word Lord has been delivered and I pray Lord maybe tonight Lord there's somebody that tonight on the way home maybe as they're staring up at the seed on little God maybe they'll realize that they need to lay some things down Lord if we can just come to the place Lord we're willing to just get so humble like that little woman Lord that Jesus said they'll be talking about her for the next 2 000 years and here we are still preaching about her little story a little woman that was willing to lay down their pride despite all the background despite all the all of her past Lord Jesus Lord we're just so grateful Lord for this kind of a testimony of what laying down your pride can accomplish Lord God maybe there's somebody here tonight Lord that you're pulling to Lord Jesus Lord as we cast in the net Lord God I pray Lord that you'll reach out and prick Lord whatever heart you need to preach Lord Jesus Lord you promised Lord that your word will not return void you promised that it would accomplish his purpose and Lord we're trusting tonight that it'll accomplish his purpose whether it's here in this little building or maybe out somewhere on the Airways somebody streaming in tonight and I I want to encourage Lord tonight Lord as we close in prayer Lord Jesus said if there's somebody that's Lord their heart is pricked Maybe be watching in tonight if they'll lead kneel down beside their bed in humility Lord I thank God that we've got a God that will answer back I thank God tonight Lord that you'll answer back lord Jesus when when we reach out to you Lord Jesus you just don't just stand there with your arms folded looking Lord but Lord you promised that you're a God that is still touched by the feelings of our infirmities thank you Lord Jesus amen let's sing something to him [Music] and then we'll turn this service over [Music] [Music] love you more [Music] than ever up here

goes from other Donnie Reagan's Church there a little bit above where we're going to be so let's just pray also for brother Andre and the and the sisters and the brothers that's going to help get this thing together because they're pretty much putting it all together for us so let's just remember them because it is a big effort to get all this together but we will be paying for your room so we'll have your rooms ready when you get there on Friday and Saturday and we'll give you your room numbers and we will go from there so if you have any questions call me or our sister June and we will be able to try to answer you questions there will be continental breakfast so you'll have breakfast there at the Comfort Suites in Johnson City and you've got your addresses if you don't have this piece of paper you need to get one because this is our itinerary except for the new place that we're going which is still just right there in Irwin it's not very far so um like I said call us if you need anything if you can't come please let us know real quick so we can maybe consolidate the rooms and the rooms won't be so expensive they're giving us a good rate but still we're going to have to get about 15 or 16 rooms so that's a pretty good pretty good chunk so we appreciate brother Dale always for letting us be able to do this and taking a little bit of the burden off of us financially amen done all of it but financially try to take a little bit of the burden off by getting your your room so just keep us in prayer and we love you with the love of the Lord we thank you for coming and good crowd for Wednesday night I heard you were preaching and good to see the the group from Ohio they're they're behind the camera somewhere so they were streaming in so good to have them and we will let you go back temporarily and million at brother Eduardo they're going to find a place to live here so want to announce that from the pulpit we went to Helen today and they said oh this is pretty yeah it's pretty it's a tourist trap though we're going to get you away from it then and then we can go visit it so we had a good time when Anna Ruby Falls and walked up that thing and saw the saw the fall so we had a good time so uh we love like brother Bob said listen if you don't like Fellowship then if you're that that pulls that makes Pride if you're too proudest to Fellowship there's something wrong you're hiding something come on birds of a feather I mean Lambs we all were if you if you go heading out towards somewhere else I'm just saying you're hiding something let's just be all family all the time every time brother George will struggle with you right amen we're going to struggle with you I know it's a struggle it ain't happy it's a struggle but he called me not too long ago and told me about all this and and we just want you to pray we all stumble We All Fall but you know what a good soldier will do get up [Music] he's standing there Eddie he's standing right there hello George we're with you every time man doesn't matter Devil's the devil as long as he opens his mouth he's lying so we don't like him and I don't care if he likes me right so you're just tell them that when you get when you get down and say look devil I got a bunch of Lights there's a lot of light l-i-g-h-t-s there's a bunch of Lights just praying for you right so help drive back that Darkness we've all been in that spot I want everybody to raise their hands have problems in their Christian Life well you're not lonely you've got you've got people around you that's going through the same thing not maybe same thing you are but we've all went through something before so we right here with you buddy we're right here with you I appreciate somebody that can come back here and admit admit that they're having problems all right because a lot of times they don't they keep and hold it in their self and you don't know how to help them you know because they don't tell you well you know just let it out what have I been saying let it out the man don't let it let it out and let's go have a good time in in Tennessee and for those of you that's going to be here you'll have a good time with brother Bob so like I said no Sunday school I'll start at 10 o'clock one service on Sunday brother Bob will be speaking and then we will have one service on Sunday I'll be speaking for brother um Andre and then we'll go eat at the farmer's daughter and then head on back home probably seven or eight o'clock we'll be back home so Lord bless you anybody have any questions about what we're you know where we're going you should have everything right here and you should be able to put all that in your in your GPS and and make it so any anything no okay all right no It's gotta be it can't be until three all right Scott beats three now we're gonna get there and help and do all that but we'll go to the rooms at three o'clock and I'll start getting them all ready so yes if I can get there by 12 o'clock or one o'clock and she says y'all can come on I'll send everybody a text or WhatsApp and tell you that you can come on and check in but normally it's three o'clock and then check out is normally at 11 but if you check out 11 on Sunday you've missed service you've missed service so don't wait till 11 o'clock to check out on Sunday all right so uh it's about 10 or 15 minutes from where we're going to be so so just uh just keep that in mind too when you're leaving but yeah I'll let everybody know if if you can come in early that's about 15 rooms I doubt they're going to be all ready there is a softball tournament during that weekend that's why the rooms are a little more expensive and there's not many of them in certain places we've tried to get in the block but this lady has really tried to help us and rooms are at a premium so it won't be deserted I would be like brother Bob said we'll be we'll be hanging around bunch of demons but that's okay that's all right they're out there we're in here okay hey man but you know what Shine Your Light open the door for him tell him God bless you right you know walk around with skirts and and long hair yeah hey man show your light Let It Shine You Can Let It Shine without coming right here you're actually gonna let it shine more because you're going to be out there in the world so let's sing one more song as we dismiss God bless you good to have Dad with us man come on Amen oh blessing Lord in the way that was gone leading straight to the land yes [Music] [Music] [Music]
