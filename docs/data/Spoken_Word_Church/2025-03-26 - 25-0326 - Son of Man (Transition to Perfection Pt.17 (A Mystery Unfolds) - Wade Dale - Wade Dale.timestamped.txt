[4:50] speak today continue on with a mystery
[4:53] unfolding so let's bow our heads and and
[4:56] uh ask the Lord to bless this meeting
[4:58] father we pray Lord that you'd bless
[5:01] us Lord we looked at these many quotes
[5:05] and different things from the prophet
[5:07] Lord and we know now that many people
[5:11] and I say many people are are doubting
[5:13] that that you did send us a prophet Lord
[5:17] I hope you open their eyes father
[5:19] because I sure see that without you
[5:21] sending a prophet we would be in bad
[5:23] shape we wouldn't know what to do we
[5:25] wouldn't know what to say we wouldn't
[5:27] know who to worship a father a son or a
[5:30] holy ghost we wouldn't know how to be
[5:32] baptized we wouldn't know how to live we
[5:34] wouldn't have church order Lord I Thank
[5:36] you so much for bringing Clarity to the
[5:39] word of God through your little prophet
[5:41] and Lord he'll get his
[5:43] reward millions of people will receive
[5:46] eternal life under his ministry Lord and
[5:49] I pray for the ones that are rebuking
[5:51] that Ministry father that you would
[5:53] touch them Lord don't let them cross the
[5:55] line because we're coming up to this
[5:57] great time of the third pole where Jes
[5:59] Jesus Moses even Noah preached to the
[6:03] totally lost those that could never be
[6:06] saved father I pray that you'd let us be
[6:09] diligent let us know that we are born
[6:12] again and in the family of God that
[6:15] we've done everything we can do Lord
[6:17] that we've stood in a place father and
[6:20] just stood there and waited on you to
[6:21] move Lord and you've moved on many
[6:23] people's lives we've seen it here Lord
[6:25] in just a short time we've had the group
[6:27] here Lord under my leadership father and
[6:30] it doesn't mean anything it's just that
[6:31] I see that people's lives are being
[6:33] changed that people are loving you more
[6:36] and that's the way we want Lord we we
[6:38] don't want a bunch of know it alls but
[6:39] we do want a bunch of know it alls that
[6:41] knows you only and father I pray that
[6:44] you'd bless each one tonight be with the
[6:45] ones that are sick we know there's some
[6:47] Lord requests Lord that that are not
[6:49] feeling well that are uh we know that
[6:51] the pollen is fallen and Lord that's
[6:53] just that's just you repopulating the
[6:55] world again Lord silently uh populating
[6:59] the whole world with pollen but Lord it
[7:01] does get in our nostrils sometimes and
[7:03] in our sinuses and I pray Lord that you
[7:05] would um take the people that are
[7:08] susceptible to that Lord and just touch
[7:10] their body Lord and heal them Father
[7:13] because you're the Healer you're the
[7:14] only one and I pray that you'd bless us
[7:16] now and be with us be with us this
[7:18] weekend Lord and touch the lives of the
[7:20] people Lord that's going to hear from
[7:22] you Lord from Brother David and they in
[7:24] the Methodist Church Lord I pray that
[7:27] you'd bless each one father in Jesus
[7:28] name
[7:30] amen but it's written I have not seen
[7:33] nor ear heard nor entered into the heart
[7:34] of man the things which God hath
[7:36] prepared for them that love
[7:38] him all right now
[7:41] remember prepared for them that love
[7:43] him it's just like I'm going the little
[7:46] sermon I got figured fixed up for the
[7:48] Methodist people and and the church
[7:51] there we have plenty of electricity in
[7:53] this
[7:54] building to run whatever we have I know
[7:57] brother Gary it's a little bit it's a
[7:58] little bit guy uh we uh we need a little
[8:02] more electricity um Outlets but that
[8:06] Outlet's going to do you any good until
[8:08] you plug into it power's there power is
[8:12] there power for whatever you need is
[8:14] there that's the same way with the
[8:15] gospel the same way with the word of God
[8:17] the power is there God has supplied
[8:19] eternal life and all you got to do is
[8:22] plug into it and once you plug into it
[8:25] you get what that outlet will give you
[8:28] all right and we know it's a billion
[8:29] vaults with coming from the Lord because
[8:31] what it'll do is it'll save your soul
[8:34] and put you in the kingdom of God but
[8:36] you got to love him right all right you
[8:39] got to love him back that's all he wants
[8:41] he wants us to love him he don't want us
[8:42] to filo him he wants us to Agape him to
[8:46] love him unconditional but God hath
[8:47] revealed them unto us by his spirit for
[8:50] the spirit searches all things ye the
[8:52] Deep things of God now if you've got the
[8:54] Holy Spirit what's it going to do it's
[8:55] going to search out the Deep things
[8:57] that's what the scripture says
[9:01] and it's contrary to us it's contrary to
[9:03] what we are as human beings we don't
[9:06] like
[9:07] Mysteries now we don't like
[9:10] surprises but I like the mysteries of
[9:12] God cuz that's what we feed on we feed
[9:15] on these mysteries of God for what man
[9:18] knoweth the things of a man save the
[9:19] spirit of man which is in him even so
[9:22] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[9:24] spirit of God now we have received not
[9:26] the spirit of the world but the spirit
[9:28] which is of god that we might know the
[9:30] things look that are freely given to us
[9:33] of God now the power may go off in this
[9:36] building but God's power never goes off
[9:39] so once you plug into it you're not
[9:41] going to have you're going to have up
[9:43] days and down days but that electrical
[9:45] outlet is not going to have it that
[9:46] eternal life that's flowing freely but
[9:48] you got to plug into it brother Ernie
[9:50] Billa said one time he said we have
[9:52] plugged ourself into the Eternal and I
[9:55] and I I I get that 100% so you may be
[9:58] seated the Lord as his Blessing now
[9:59] we're going to continue on with the
[10:02] thought but we're going to take a
[10:03] different angle maybe in just a few
[10:05] minutes and um and look at something
[10:08] that uh we were looking at this
[10:09] afternoon and changed up a little bit so
[10:12] Matthew 13:11 now this is Jesus he said
[10:15] his answer to give said unto them
[10:17] because it given unto you you to know
[10:19] the mysteries of the kingdom of God but
[10:21] to them it's not given so this is only
[10:24] to a special group of people we've read
[10:25] this quote many many times that it's
[10:28] only to that people people that will
[10:29] receive Revelation or have spiritual
[10:33] Insight the problem is is we have
[10:35] Insight sometimes it's just not
[10:37] spiritual
[10:39] amen all right the invisible Union of
[10:41] the Bride brother rown said look he said
[10:44] the word that fell on the day of
[10:45] Pentecost will not work this day no sir
[10:49] that was for Pentecost this is for the
[10:51] bride going home with the bride listen
[10:55] we are not people backing up we can't
[10:59] Christians back up to a Pentecostal
[11:02] experience 1906 you understand what I'm
[11:05] saying everybody needs a Pentecostal
[11:06] experience but we're not backing up to
[11:09] those days that we were babies and that
[11:11] we were floundering around we should be
[11:13] grownup we should be we'll see here in
[11:15] just a minute if you've not known it yet
[11:17] you'll know it tonight that that third
[11:19] pull that Ministry that brother Rand
[11:22] moved into was a Ministry of
[11:24] adoption that was a Ministry that had
[11:26] never been taught before
[11:29] not many people have been
[11:32] adopted but we'll look at it in just a
[11:34] second the Pentecostal represented that
[11:37] again we're in the bright age no more
[11:39] than the word of Noah would work in the
[11:41] days of Moses no more than moses' law
[11:43] would have worked in the time of Paul he
[11:45] tried to tell them you're dead to that
[11:47] and you cannot have that first
[11:50] Corinthians all these
[11:52] things I was talking to
[11:54] someone this weekend
[11:57] and man how the
[11:59] how the devil can twist the word of God
[12:02] if you don't have a
[12:05] revelation that uh the person was saying
[12:08] that well Malachi 4 was in the Old
[12:09] Testament so brother R couldn't be a
[12:11] prophet because he was Gentile I said
[12:13] well you can you can you can believe
[12:16] that if you want to but I believe the
[12:18] Bible says behold I send you it didn't
[12:20] say behold I send the
[12:22] Jews he said behold I send you Elijah
[12:25] the prophet so whatever it was is for
[12:28] me and I don't care if it's New
[12:30] Testament or Old Testament it's always
[12:31] the word of God sure it has its allegory
[12:34] sure it has its time of of being um
[12:37] natural and then Supernatural and
[12:39] spiritual and non-spiritual and all
[12:41] these different things but you got to be
[12:42] able to by the Holy Ghost decipher and
[12:44] take those things and put them in your
[12:46] heart run them through your filter and
[12:47] say that ain't nothing but the truth
[12:49] like had R did now all these things
[12:52] happen unto them for examples of course
[12:54] the Old Testament people and they are
[12:56] written for our admonition upon whom the
[12:58] ends of the world are come and if that's
[13:00] not
[13:02] us then we're going to all we'll be all
[13:04] gone here in a few years and another
[13:06] group will come in but that's not going
[13:08] to happen there wasn't another group as
[13:10] we'll get to in just a minute there was
[13:13] not another group passed the group that
[13:15] Joshua took in right there wasn't
[13:19] another group rose up it was the group
[13:21] that rose up during Joshua's
[13:23] Administration end of Moses Moses goes
[13:26] off the scene Joshua takes over he and
[13:29] and Caleb positionally plac the people
[13:31] in the land everybody with me and we
[13:33] know that that Ephesians parallels
[13:35] Joshua and we see that the adoption
[13:38] comes when God places you and puts you
[13:40] in a place and says this is your place I
[13:42] want you to stay in that place just like
[13:44] he did with all the 12 tribes of Israel
[13:46] he said these are your boundaries you
[13:48] stay here you go over here and you go
[13:50] over here and brother Ram told us he
[13:52] said when the bride realizes who she is
[13:55] and what she's doing here she'll be an
[13:56] invincible Army the problem is is maybe
[13:58] we you're sitting here today well maybe
[14:00] I'm not this and maybe I'm not that well
[14:02] you got to find out right you got to
[14:04] find out and know know that you know
[14:06] that you
[14:07] know that's my whole thought I want you
[14:10] to know who you
[14:12] are and you got to you listen I can't
[14:15] give you a revelation you got to pray
[14:17] that God will give you a revelation even
[14:20] in the quietness of your home or in the
[14:21] night time praying that God will give
[14:23] you a revelation of what you heard from
[14:25] another minister or from brother
[14:26] brandham or or anybody that preaches the
[14:28] true word word of God I don't care how
[14:31] you get it as long as you get it right I
[14:35] don't Psalms 139 says my substance was
[14:38] not hid from thee think about a God that
[14:41] knew
[14:42] everything about us before he even
[14:45] created the world to put us on before
[14:47] our mom and daddy was even formed in the
[14:49] womb of their mothers and fathers and I
[14:51] mothers and mothers all the way
[14:53] down he knew who we were he knew where
[14:56] we'd be he knew what we'd be
[15:00] and where he would come to a place he
[15:01] would give you he would cross your path
[15:04] and what you do when you cross the path
[15:07] what a mighty God we
[15:09] serve and then see we can then we can
[15:11] stand and look back and see that it was
[15:14] that genealogy or C Gene of God that
[15:17] come all the way down even through the
[15:18] Old Testament it wasn't produced in the
[15:20] Old Testament come on but it was there
[15:23] in god Jehovah had it all with him then
[15:26] he came on Earth as a human being and
[15:29] even his genealogy of his own genetics
[15:32] of his of his male sperm didn't help
[15:36] anybody didn't that wasn't what he came
[15:38] for he came to bring us back to where
[15:41] Adam did what he did he did to alleviate
[15:43] that to bring us to a spiritual birth to
[15:46] a spiritual planting of a seed amen and
[15:49] that's what you received that's a new
[15:50] birth yes you received that part that
[15:53] God saw you had in Genesis 126 man
[15:55] before the foundation of the world man
[15:58] if we can't believe a God if we can't
[15:59] put our whole confidence that he knew
[16:01] everything didn't ever change his mind
[16:04] never made a mistake then find me
[16:06] somebody else that
[16:08] way there's not one so I put my
[16:12] sufficiency all in God my substance was
[16:15] not hid from thee When I Was Made In
[16:17] Secret curiously wrought in the lowest
[16:19] parts of the earth doesn't matter where
[16:22] you came from we all came same way all
[16:25] right and and I listened to a brother a
[16:28] little bit of to go talking about Rahab
[16:30] and brother U Luis did a real good job
[16:32] preaching on Rahab over in in Honduras
[16:36] but you look at all that that Joshua
[16:38] came across they're defeating everybody
[16:40] and they're fixing to to defeat the
[16:42] whole city of Jericho that the walls
[16:44] were so big you could run a chariot race
[16:47] around Joshua said you two men go find
[16:50] somebody in that City and witness to
[16:53] them they found a
[16:55] sorry ain't just plain they found
[16:57] a prostitute that's these two men
[17:00] Christian men tape boys is what brother
[17:02] Brown said found a house of a
[17:06] harlot but that's what God sent him to
[17:10] because he knew her
[17:12] heart he knew what she needed deep down
[17:14] inside wasn't what the world was giving
[17:17] her and they said you just throw this
[17:20] Scarlet rope down and we'll destroy
[17:22] everything but you but now you make sure
[17:24] you get your family in oh listen folks
[17:27] let's make sure we get our family in
[17:29] amen pray for them pray for themen then
[17:32] all you can see standing after all the
[17:34] rubble and after all the destruction and
[17:36] after Joshua came in and they wiped out
[17:38] an entire city there stood a there stood
[17:41] a a house with a red string running down
[17:44] it and Rahab come walking out and she
[17:48] married an Israeli General and that's
[17:49] the line that Jesus came
[17:52] from oh
[17:54] wow Grace don't ever ever forget the
[17:58] grace of God amen ever that's why God
[18:01] sent us a prophet for that Grace he sent
[18:04] us a
[18:05] prophet Thine Eyes didn't see my
[18:07] substance yet being imperfect and in thy
[18:10] book all my members were written which
[18:12] in contingence were fashion when as yet
[18:14] there was none of them God wrote this
[18:17] whole Bible and none of us were born but
[18:20] he wrote it for me he wrote it for you
[18:23] he wrote it he actually inspired Moses
[18:27] to write what happened just for me and
[18:30] you that's why I see it just like we
[18:32] were talking the other day me and
[18:33] brother Bob were talking about brother
[18:34] rand's Ministry he would I believe he
[18:37] would be preaching along and they would
[18:38] be something he that he needed to say
[18:40] he'd stop he'd say uh or or something
[18:43] and whatever he said that's what we use
[18:45] for a quote that brother brother Brown
[18:47] didn't maybe didn't know everything he
[18:49] did I don't know if he knew his whole
[18:50] 1100 sermons was going to do this I
[18:52] don't know that but it is and it did but
[18:56] every quote we use is to dovetail
[18:59] everything we're preaching in 2025 that
[19:02] he spoke in 1947 to 63 is for us to take
[19:07] the pieces and the Nuggets put them
[19:09] together and give them to the people am
[19:11] I just believe that 100% that he was
[19:13] totally totally surrendered to God in a
[19:16] pull
[19:17] pit I just believe that now he'll tell
[19:20] you what his opinion is though now he'll
[19:22] tell you his what his opinion is but
[19:24] when it comes thus sayith the Lord you
[19:25] better believe it because it came
[19:26] straight from God Malachi 3 then they
[19:30] that feared the Lord spake often one to
[19:32] another and the Lord hearkened and heard
[19:34] it and the Book of remembrance was
[19:35] written before him for them that feared
[19:38] the Lord and that thought upon his name
[19:40] that's Malachi 3 that's in the Old
[19:42] Testament I guess that's not for us no
[19:45] that's for
[19:47] me so the real secret we were looking at
[19:50] the other day is this Genesis 126 and
[19:53] sometimes it it staggers you to see that
[19:56] that this Genesis 126 man if you've been
[19:59] here a long
[20:00] time Dad's preached it for 40 years and
[20:03] i' that's one of my favorite scriptures
[20:04] so I kind of added in pretty much every
[20:06] sermon that I preach at Genesis 126 man
[20:09] it's not every
[20:11] person it's only the progeny of God he
[20:14] said let us make man in our own image
[20:17] now listen he made man in his own image
[20:20] he gave each person a soul but he didn't
[20:23] tell them to be fruitful multiply
[20:26] replenish the Earth subdue it take it
[20:28] over and you be the king of it that's
[20:31] not for everybody that's just for us
[20:33] that's just for his children he made
[20:35] this world to us for us to inhabit it as
[20:38] his children amen how do you know that
[20:40] that's what we're going to God don't
[20:42] change his mind remember right he didn't
[20:45] change his mind when Adam when Eve did
[20:47] what she did with the Beast it just
[20:48] prolonged his plan and made him much
[20:50] more of a God to be honored and praise
[20:53] because he took care of all these
[20:54] different things that you and I have to
[20:55] go through and like a Rahab and like a
[20:58] Ruth and and all these different
[20:59] Gentiles that are plugged into the the
[21:01] line of of the Jewish
[21:03] line typing
[21:06] us I mean we're all
[21:08] Rahab God sent somebody to us he sent a
[21:11] couple of T boys to me I'll promise you
[21:13] that in my low condition yours
[21:18] too so this great mystery is that
[21:21] genesis6 man is going to be made
[21:24] manifest on the earth in flesh all the
[21:28] way from the the first church age to
[21:29] today we are just the ending up of it
[21:31] we're the culmination of all
[21:34] this so the mystery where is the mystery
[21:36] the mystery is in US Christ in you Paul
[21:39] said the hope of glory but the world
[21:42] won't ever see that they'll think that
[21:44] what did they what have they done to
[21:45] Jesus what did they do with the 12
[21:47] disciples only one lived to die of
[21:49] natural death one right the rest of them
[21:52] were killed for what they believe they'd
[21:54] go to a different place go to India and
[21:56] go try to spread the gospel and I'm sure
[21:58] they did but they all died horrible
[22:01] deaths soared pulled apart all these
[22:05] different things they were killed
[22:06] because of what because of the word of
[22:08] God that's why I love that song word of
[22:10] God ever true it it took a a group of
[22:14] people to come through these different
[22:16] ages to hand that word over and to
[22:19] preach it and hand it over to Paul and
[22:21] Paul puts it in print and this one puts
[22:23] it in print and now it's all together
[22:24] and it's
[22:26] ours there's a lot of blood on this
[22:28] Bible folks right a lot of natural
[22:31] spilled blood to get it to get this to
[22:33] where we're at today and why don't we
[22:35] read
[22:37] it Christ The Mystery of God
[22:40] revealed when the current is Flowing
[22:42] freely the word of God it expresses
[22:44] itself what we was talking about
[22:46] electricity the current The Works that I
[22:48] do shall you be also and in the last
[22:51] days it shall come to pass behold I will
[22:53] sent to you Elijah the prophet and he
[22:55] shall turn the hearts of the children
[22:56] back to the faith of the fathers and in
[22:59] there there would be a Time come forth
[23:00] when he could express himself now watch
[23:03] in fullness of his godhead
[23:05] deity all right so the headstone the
[23:08] headship will come back and it is in the
[23:10] end time it wasn't during the church
[23:12] ages it is today the body was being
[23:15] built but now the head's got to sit on
[23:16] top of that body so much shall every
[23:19] move that we make is what he tells us to
[23:21] do I just believe
[23:23] that through his church have the
[23:25] pretences in this church oh my what the
[23:29] anointed man now the anointed people so
[23:32] now where's the anointing the anointing
[23:33] was on the man the anointing was on a
[23:35] prophet now the anointing is on the
[23:37] people the anointing was on Moses the
[23:40] anointing was on Joshua and now if
[23:43] Joshua he passed away it was on a group
[23:45] of people that was Ruben and and all the
[23:48] different ones the 12 tribes it was on
[23:50] them and it kept going and kept going
[23:52] and kept going now the anointed people
[23:54] oh might to bring back the anointed
[23:56] bride and bridegroom anointed by what
[23:58] why accepting what Eve turned down and
[24:00] Adam coming back with what the anointing
[24:03] of the word there's an anointing for
[24:05] every age there's a dispensation for
[24:06] every
[24:07] time and there's a Administration change
[24:11] just like we had in the government
[24:13] there's one in there's one in the in the
[24:15] word of God people that take over like
[24:17] here's
[24:19] Moses Moses had a job right all right he
[24:23] could see the promised land he told the
[24:25] people they were going to that land but
[24:27] he didn't get to go
[24:29] right I'll read that here in just a
[24:30] minute but Joshua was the man with the
[24:32] commission for the hour to take the
[24:34] people over all
[24:36] right everybody with
[24:39] me Revelation of Jesus Christ brother
[24:43] Brown said look now the Greek word for
[24:45] Revelation is apocalypse which means the
[24:49] unveiling this unveiling is perfectly
[24:52] described in the example of a sculptor
[24:54] embeding his work of Statuary exposing
[24:56] it to the onlooker in other words it's
[24:58] covered up the work's been done it's
[25:01] just covered up right you can't see it
[25:03] but it's in there but all of a sudden
[25:06] the curtain gets pulled back and there
[25:08] is the
[25:10] statue that you're supposed to look at
[25:12] that was in the mind of the of the
[25:14] sculptor
[25:15] first if you and I looked at it it'd be
[25:17] just a big block of
[25:19] wood but Michelangelo could look at that
[25:22] big block of wood and he could in his
[25:24] mind cuz you know what if you hit the
[25:26] wrong if you hit the wrong piece with
[25:28] that
[25:29] chisel you could have knocked the arm
[25:31] off or even the head that you were going
[25:32] to build but they knew exactly what to
[25:34] do and they took that big piece of
[25:36] granite that old rough dull looking
[25:40] piece of granite me and you and the
[25:44] master sculptor has been chipping away
[25:47] down Through the Ages and he's chipped
[25:49] you and me out we're not the chips that
[25:51] lay on the ground were the statue
[25:55] am right
[25:58] it's an uncovering revealing what was
[26:00] previously
[26:02] hid now where was it all hid we'll get
[26:05] to this a little bit later on but not
[26:06] this this service where was it
[26:09] previously
[26:10] hid to us it was previously hid in
[26:14] Christ nobody understood Jesus Christ
[26:16] nobody understood who he was he came to
[26:18] the religious people that supposed to
[26:20] know and he actually he could have took
[26:22] a sheet of paper and wrote Every
[26:24] scripture down in the Old Testament and
[26:26] said I did every one of these what's
[26:27] your problem
[26:28] and really that's what he said he said
[26:31] you go read the scriptures he said have
[26:32] I come any different than that he
[26:34] wouldn't have been the word of God he
[26:35] wouldn't have been Jesus Christ if he
[26:37] hadn't come exactly so what about today
[26:39] we look at now we are trying our best to
[26:42] be that
[26:44] example everybody with me we're trying
[26:46] our best to be that
[26:48] example and we're going can't you see
[26:51] what's going on here this is us this is
[26:53] what we're doing this is our hour this
[26:55] is there and people are going I don't
[26:57] believe that it's somewhere else maybe
[26:59] it's somebody El for somebody else it's
[27:01] not for me well that's okay but this is
[27:03] for me I I just I just can't put my I
[27:07] can't put nothing in anything else
[27:10] nothing you tell me what to put it
[27:14] in now the uncovering is not only the
[27:17] revelation of Christ all right because
[27:20] to reveal Christ is to reveal the people
[27:23] of
[27:24] Christ because we are considered
[27:26] Christians
[27:28] right which acted like
[27:32] Christ but you with me on that I mean
[27:34] you act like Christ you look like Christ
[27:37] you act like Christ and listen you can
[27:39] tell the people of the world we're
[27:41] living this Bible just as best as we can
[27:44] and they're like well that's the Old
[27:46] Testament or that really is not for me
[27:48] or he didn't really mean that or that
[27:50] was his opinion talking about maybe
[27:51] somebody writing in the Bible that's
[27:53] their opinion I don't see that
[27:54] somebody's opinion is going to give me
[27:56] Rapture and Faith right
[27:58] amen Jesus never had an
[28:02] opinion he never had a skirmish with his
[28:05] father amen he said I only do that what
[28:08] my father shows me that's right and
[28:11] sometimes I I tell you brother Lis if we
[28:13] slow down before we made decisions
[28:17] sometimes we could act like the
[28:20] father let what inside of us be first
[28:24] instead of see we didn't do like Christ
[28:26] in the garden he says not my my will but
[28:29] thy will be done a lot of times we want
[28:31] my
[28:33] will and it's not God's
[28:35] will I was talking to a brother this
[28:38] this weekend and he said why are my
[28:39] prayer if this is if we're just so great
[28:41] why is my prayers not answered I said
[28:43] every prayer you pray is
[28:46] answered it just ain't answered the way
[28:48] you want it
[28:50] answered remember God's knows are the
[28:52] best yeses you'll ever
[28:55] get think about that God will answer
[28:58] your prayer it may not be what you like
[29:02] but he'll answer your prayer and see
[29:04] that's the problem Us in humanity go
[29:05] well if he don't answer it the way I
[29:07] want it then it's he didn't answer it no
[29:10] wrong
[29:12] answer so it's also the revelation of
[29:15] his Future Works in the oncoming Church
[29:18] ages and when I say Church ages I mean
[29:21] people it wasn't a building that said
[29:24] that Luther preached one building and
[29:25] that's all that happened in Luther's age
[29:28] Luther did start preaching and then
[29:29] Luther preached and the Revelation got
[29:31] caught by this brother and that brother
[29:32] and this brother and that brother and
[29:34] they spread it out across Europe at the
[29:36] time and then over here when Wesley came
[29:39] to the United States and started
[29:40] spreading it there so it's not just a
[29:42] church age it's Church age
[29:45] people there is no church age without
[29:47] people God's only going to do this
[29:50] through people he's not going to do it
[29:52] through a
[29:55] building or an idea
[29:59] right now here's what brother Brown said
[30:01] on the seventh seal we were talking
[30:03] about this the other day notice the next
[30:05] thing I took some kind of a bar cut it
[30:07] off he talk about the pyramid and inside
[30:09] was White Rock that had nothing wrote on
[30:11] now look had nothing wrote on it and at
[30:13] that time I started to the west and I
[30:15] told them all I said don't go out west
[30:17] stay here and look on this till I return
[30:19] went West for the blast now where did he
[30:21] go west he went West to
[30:25] Tucson got the commission to come back
[30:27] to
[30:28] Jeffersonville and they were going to
[30:30] reveal the seals to him there they
[30:31] didn't reveal to him out there cuz it
[30:32] says look return back to the east with
[30:34] the Holy Spirit interpreting this
[30:36] Unwritten word all right now if that
[30:40] isn't perfectly the God Almighty I want
[30:41] you to know what it
[30:44] is what am I trying to say this for
[30:47] friends is to show you we're at the end
[30:50] time modern events make clear by
[30:52] prophecy that's why I was telling
[30:55] you that this Elijah the reason brother
[30:58] brandham was was so familiar with
[31:01] squirrels and birds and and all these
[31:04] different possums he was a man of the
[31:06] Wilderness just like Elijah was he was a
[31:09] man of the Wilderness he hated immoral
[31:10] women John the Baptist another
[31:12] Wilderness lover Hunter Woodsman so if
[31:15] if they had the character brother Brown
[31:16] had to have that same character okay he
[31:19] had no education hello brother Brown
[31:22] didn't either watch his text wasn't the
[31:25] like a theologian he said Generation of
[31:27] Vipers built this thing you can have in
[31:29] the wilderness was a snake he called
[31:31] those priests Generation of Vipers who
[31:33] warns you to free from the Wrath to come
[31:35] in other words he also talked about the
[31:36] axes laid to the root of the tree so
[31:38] brother randam was under that anoint
[31:40] that same Elijah anointing so God had to
[31:42] speak to him through these different
[31:44] things like fish and water and deer and
[31:47] Bulls and fish and uh possums and he
[31:53] understood that brother Ram understood
[31:54] that so it wasn't a mystery to him he
[31:57] understood these things so God used that
[31:59] and the same thing with me and
[32:04] you listen God is not I let me tell you
[32:08] something God didn't bring you this far
[32:10] to confuse
[32:13] you God will not confuse you right he's
[32:18] not a good daddy if he does
[32:21] that but now he lays it out to us and if
[32:23] we don't accept it who's confused we are
[32:28] we're the confusion but he lays it out
[32:30] to where we can get it even the people
[32:33] that don't have an education can get it
[32:36] illiterate person brother Brown said the
[32:38] most illiterate
[32:41] person so now the third poll or the
[32:44] three polls remember the remember the
[32:45] vision we're not going to go into it
[32:47] about the fish he caught a little bitty
[32:48] fish and then he messed the line up and
[32:50] he was heading to catch bigger fish he
[32:52] went to the tent Vision all those things
[32:56] you've already heard that a million
[32:57] times so not go over it again but you
[32:59] know the first pull was what the showing
[33:01] of his hand and calling out the sickness
[33:05] what was the second pull bring the
[33:06] person up to the prayer line bring them
[33:08] to the prayer line tell them what they
[33:09] were tell them their name most of the
[33:12] time where they live what was wrong with
[33:14] them and pronounced them healed or not
[33:17] right so that was the first pull was
[33:19] pulling the people up to that point all
[33:22] right everybody with me pulling the
[33:24] people up to that point from the
[33:26] Pentecostals that were just speaking in
[33:28] tongues and jumping and shouting you
[33:29] know brother randam was he put order to
[33:31] that he gave him prayer cards he said I
[33:33] want number one number two number three
[33:35] number
[33:36] four come up to the front and it made
[33:38] some order instead of everybody trying
[33:40] to rush up to the front of the every you
[33:42] listen if you saw that healing power
[33:44] you'd want to rush up there sometime I
[33:46] guess if there was no order to it but
[33:48] there's order to
[33:50] God but a pull is a force drawing
[33:52] someone or something in a particular
[33:54] direction or course of action so taking
[33:57] side Jesus brother R said
[34:00] look now look remember the commission
[34:04] this is where we'll we'll get another
[34:06] gear right here he had a
[34:09] commission remember the the angel said
[34:12] do the work of an evangelist I believe
[34:13] it's Thessalonians or do the work of an
[34:15] evangelist make proof of your ministry
[34:17] because with there'll be people with
[34:18] itching ears and all these different
[34:20] things and he wrote that down and put it
[34:22] in what he put it in the Cornerstone of
[34:23] the church in Jeffersonville all right
[34:26] he said do the work of an evangelist not
[34:27] be one do the work of one now listen I
[34:30] want to show you now this is
[34:33] 1962 in June one year before the seals
[34:37] open all right so I'm setting the stage
[34:39] here now as I have done the work of an
[34:43] evangelist and here is my plea if that
[34:46] is pleasing to God I've done the work
[34:49] all right trusting that I have pleased
[34:52] him asking for forgiveness for all my
[34:55] mistakes
[34:57] then he may be calling me from the field
[35:00] of evangelism to be his
[35:04] Prophet now how many times his brother
[35:06] Brown he he he' say prophet and stop say
[35:08] no no no that stumbles people he said
[35:10] I'm just a brother I'm just a I'm just a
[35:12] servant I'm just a se you know Seer but
[35:14] he said right here look then if it is
[35:18] I'll leave
[35:20] evangelism and what was his evangelism
[35:23] healing healing campaigns all right sure
[35:27] there's great nuggets in there and
[35:28] there's things like I said that that God
[35:30] put in these sermons that we pull out
[35:32] but but most of it was the prayer
[35:35] line the most of the people came for the
[35:38] prayer
[35:39] line but if he calls me to be a prophet
[35:42] I cannot be an
[35:44] evangelist it's 1962 right before the
[35:46] seals open if I'm to be an evangelist I
[35:50] cannot be a
[35:51] prophet I'm mixing the two offices
[35:55] that's where I've always fussed about
[35:58] now watch what he
[36:00] says standing on the platform it's never
[36:04] been good are
[36:09] successful 50,000 miracles in one sermon
[36:14] and he said it wasn't
[36:16] successful millions of people healed
[36:19] some
[36:20] instantly saved Sanctified filled with
[36:22] the Holy Ghost in his ministry and
[36:24] pulling bringing them up to the prayer
[36:26] line it's never been good
[36:31] successful you think he kind of figures
[36:33] out what his real message is fixing to
[36:37] be God has used it now watch God has
[36:41] used it but I've never thought it was
[36:44] his direct
[36:46] will I'm just reading you
[36:49] quote I've never thought it was his
[36:52] direct will it's been his permissive
[36:54] will remember the angel told him he said
[36:56] you messed up
[36:58] you tried to explain it you tried to you
[37:00] stood there in other words and wasted
[37:02] your time explaining it when you should
[37:04] have just told the people and left
[37:06] that's what the angel said
[37:08] yeah it's been his permissive will stand
[37:11] on the platform a vision or two will
[37:14] knock you out almost see and then if you
[37:17] now watch this then if you tell this
[37:19] person how to straighten himself out and
[37:21] what to do and then the next person
[37:23] stands there he's expecting the same
[37:25] thing
[37:30] H and you can't tell him L something
[37:33] tells you to tell
[37:34] him what a strain that you can somebody
[37:37] asked me the other day said well why
[37:40] doesn't Jesus why doesn't he heal every
[37:42] everybody I said let me tell you
[37:44] something brother I said that's real
[37:46] narrow-minded when God himself was here
[37:49] in human flesh when Jesus Christ was
[37:50] here in human flesh he went to a pool
[37:52] called Bethesda
[37:55] right he walked through hundreds of
[37:57] people brother Brown said worse off than
[37:59] that man sitting on the pallet they
[38:01] probably had a prostate problem he'd
[38:02] been he wasn't going to kill him he'd
[38:03] been alive 30 years why did he walk up
[38:06] to that one man and heal that one man
[38:08] you explain that to me and I'll explain
[38:10] to you why somebody get their healing
[38:11] some don't right all
[38:15] right I just pray for me to have more
[38:19] patience with people that are that
[38:22] sarcastic that has something illiterate
[38:25] to say like that when you can put it
[38:27] right in the scripture and say well
[38:28] Jesus did it when he was in on here on
[38:30] Earth he did the same thing there's no
[38:34] telling how many listen there's no
[38:36] telling how many crazy people he walked
[38:38] around but he went to one he went across
[38:40] the lake to one and cut to that one
[38:42] called
[38:44] Legion it's God he's Sovereign he does
[38:47] whatever he wants to do and he knows
[38:50] what he's doing so let's not correct him
[38:52] and figure out why he's not doing this
[38:54] and figure out why he's not doing that
[38:56] it may be our problem that he ain't that
[38:59] he ain't figured we ain't figured him
[39:00] out I'll promise you God's already
[39:02] figured us
[39:04] out everybody with me then the other
[39:07] people feel like you're a traitor or a
[39:09] backslider what about that or a demon or
[39:13] something because you don't tell them
[39:14] what they want to
[39:16] know see that's not the office the way a
[39:20] prophet
[39:22] operates how about that
[39:25] quote brother he put that in the
[39:27] Cornerstone of his Tabernacle do the
[39:29] work of an evangelist didn't say Be One
[39:31] do the work of one listen he had to come
[39:33] through the first pull second pull he
[39:34] had to get the people to come together
[39:36] the bait on the hook yes the hook was
[39:39] the unwritten part the book was the
[39:41] unwritten word the hook I mean was the
[39:44] unwritten word that's the that's the
[39:46] word that they hadn't seen because they
[39:47] saw the
[39:48] bait but they had seen the
[39:53] hook so let's read just for a minute
[39:55] right here
[39:58] Joshua 1:1 now
[40:00] we're we're we're looking at brother
[40:02] brandham now and he's preached from 47
[40:05] to at least
[40:06] 1962 and he comes up to 1962 and he
[40:09] makes that
[40:11] statement I've not been
[40:13] successful in other words this is not my
[40:16] Ministry I'm going to have to quit being
[40:18] an evangelist I'm going to have to be a
[40:20] prophet I can't be a prophet though and
[40:23] be an evangelist so he's having to make
[40:25] a decision here because it's a juncture
[40:27] of time for him just as this was a
[40:29] junction of time for
[40:31] Joshua but God made sure that Joshua
[40:34] knew what he was doing now Moses did but
[40:37] Moses made the mistake right Moses made
[40:39] the mistake brother R saying he exalted
[40:41] himself above God and God said you can't
[40:43] go to the promised land now that's about
[40:45] direct quote all right and actually God
[40:47] told Moses you can't go across I told
[40:50] you to speak and you smote it
[40:52] twice now after the death of Moses the
[40:54] servant of the Lord it came to pass
[40:58] but the Lord spake unto Joshua the son
[40:59] of nun Moses's Minister saying Moses my
[41:04] servant is dead now therefore arise go
[41:07] over this Jordan thou and all this
[41:09] people into the land which I do give
[41:11] them even to the children of Israel
[41:14] every place that the sole of your feet
[41:16] or foot shall tread upon that have I
[41:19] given unto you as I said unto Moses from
[41:22] the Wilderness and this Lebanon even
[41:25] into the Great River the river euphrat
[41:28] all the lands of the Hittites and the
[41:29] great sea toward the going down of the
[41:31] sun shall be your
[41:33] Coast there shall not any man be able to
[41:36] stand before thee all the days of thy
[41:41] life as I was with
[41:44] Moses so will I be with thee I will not
[41:48] fail thee nor forsake
[41:51] thee can you say that to yourself that
[41:55] God's not going to ever fail us or
[41:56] forsake he can't
[41:58] can't change his mind amen be strong and
[42:01] of good courage now listen he wanted to
[42:04] make sure that Joshua knew this because
[42:06] he said it three
[42:08] times be strong and of good courage For
[42:11] unto this
[42:13] people all right now we're talking about
[42:15] adoption we're coming to adoption part
[42:17] we're coming to where brother random
[42:18] sees his adoption and then he's going to
[42:21] show us the land come on somebody he's
[42:23] going to show us the land he's going to
[42:26] describe the land
[42:28] he's going to tell us how to get there
[42:30] but he's not
[42:32] going everybody with me but he's not
[42:35] going
[42:37] amen now you know you know what I mean
[42:39] he's not he's not candidate for a body
[42:42] change without death right because he's
[42:45] passed away but he showed us everything
[42:48] we need to know to get there he showed
[42:49] Joshua and God said Joshua as I've been
[42:52] with Moses I'll be with
[42:54] you be strong and of good courage For
[42:57] unto this people shalt thou divide for
[42:59] an inheritance the
[43:01] land now what what was Joshua type of
[43:04] the Holy Ghost Caleb was a type of the
[43:07] end time believer but they're they're
[43:08] intertwined with each other is everybody
[43:10] with me all right only be thou strong
[43:14] and very courageous this is the second
[43:15] time he tells him that thou mayest
[43:17] observe to do according to all the law
[43:20] which Moses my servant commanded thee in
[43:22] other
[43:23] words quote to quot right
[43:27] get the mind of
[43:29] Moses and carry the people on I'm
[43:32] telling us today get the quotes right
[43:35] get the message right and let's move
[43:38] forward because brother brandham is not
[43:40] going to place us in our position it's
[43:43] going to be a five-fold ministry that's
[43:45] going to place us in our position okay
[43:48] so I depend on
[43:50] that which Moses my servant commanded
[43:53] thee turn not from it to the right hand
[43:55] or to the left that thou May Prosper whs
[43:58] soever thou goest this book of the law
[44:01] shall not depart out of thy mouth but
[44:03] Thou shalt meditate there in day and
[44:05] night that thou May observe to do
[44:08] according to all that is written
[44:11] therein for then Thou shalt make thy way
[44:15] what prosperous and thou shalt have good
[44:17] success have I not in other words Joshua
[44:21] if you forgot I'm fixing to tell you
[44:22] what I've told you the second time I'm
[44:23] going to tell you the third time have
[44:25] not I commanded thee be strong and of
[44:28] good courage I say today we need to be
[44:30] strong and of good courage don't go to
[44:32] the right don't go to the left don't
[44:33] even look to the right or the left go
[44:36] right down the path forget about I me
[44:37] you're going to get but brother Brian
[44:39] preach what is the attraction on the
[44:40] mountain well there's many attractions
[44:42] today besides the
[44:44] mountain that we can look at and get
[44:46] turned sideways we look over here we can
[44:48] get on the wrong website we can we can

[44:57] going to
[44:59] get and it's got a lake and fire on
[45:02] it it's not going to be that cuz they
[45:05] don't even believe in that that was just
[45:07] something that something happened that
[45:09] uh uh a jet went across or something
[45:12] think and stuff like
[45:15] that I don't like people stealing The
[45:18] Souls of good
[45:20] people right brother Bob I I I'm talking
[45:24] about stealing The Souls of good honest
[45:25] people I ain't talking about stealing
[45:26] Souls of somebody I'm talking about
[45:27] stealing the soul of somebody stealing
[45:30] the very life because one thing don't
[45:34] match this thing and this don't match
[45:36] that and he didn't do this he wasn't out
[45:38] there when that
[45:40] happened garbage it's just garbage

[46:17] unchanging
[46:19] ways like I said before though we got to
[46:21] plug oursel into that you do have
[46:23] something to do with it you got to plug
[46:25] yourself into it
[46:27] amen for the Lord thy God is with thee
[46:30] whether
[46:31] soever Monday morning Tuesday morning
[46:36] Wednesday
[46:37] afternoon
[46:38] Saturday Sunday whatsoever you go you
[46:42] take god with
[46:46] you now
[46:49] watch all you get it now he's talking
[46:52] about going up on the mountain and the
[46:54] sword comes into his hand but watch the
[46:57] L father knows this just as true as you
[46:58] can see that come to pass those angels
[47:01] came right down and Vindicated every
[47:03] message to be the same then you know
[47:06] whether it comes from God or not it was
[47:07] foretold You by a vision I couldn't tell
[47:10] you until the service was over cuz I was
[47:12] forbidden to in Sabina Canyon sitting up
[47:14] there that morning I had my hands up the
[47:17] wind was blowed my old black hat down
[47:19] when I was standing there with my hands
[47:21] up praying he wasn't in a church he
[47:22] wasn't in a sanctuary he was had his old
[47:25] dirty clothes on come on somebody
[47:27] he had his old he is in his
[47:29] environment right he was where he wanted
[47:32] to
[47:33] be any y'all ever been I've been to
[47:35] Phoenix I've never been to tucon they
[47:37] say Ton's worse than Phoenix that is the
[47:39] driest ugliest place I ever seen in my
[47:42] life there's nothing green except what
[47:45] man puts there and it's artificial most
[47:47] of the time it's just blah but brother R
[47:52] loved to be on the top of that mountain
[47:54] where nothing but rocks sticks
[47:57] spiders um
[48:00] scorpions Havalina
[48:02] Hogs and somewhere not this one but the
[48:04] other one he was he was picking what we
[48:07] call begal which is a a l that gets on
[48:09] it's not Li it's a plant but it's got
[48:11] fuzzy things and it sticks to you and
[48:13] the reason they call it begal they beg
[48:14] it to get on you and you carry it all to
[48:16] your home and all that stuff
[48:19] cuckers why was it brother randam on a
[48:21] plush golf course and he had like birds
[48:23] chirping and you
[48:25] know flowers and the cool wind was
[48:29] blowing I'm sure at this time it's
[48:30] probably 100° on top of that
[48:32] mountain but he was standing there with
[48:34] my hands up praying I said Lord God what
[48:36] does this mean I can't understand it
[48:39] Lord have you ever ask him that
[48:43] here what am I
[48:45] doing what does this mean what does this
[48:48] whole us being here
[48:51] mean I can't understand it lord well if
[48:53] you tell him that then he's obligated
[48:55] somewhere to tell you why you're
[48:58] here and what you're doing here cuz this
[49:01] remember this third pull is your placing
[49:04] it's adoption right because it's the
[49:06] opening of the word the only way you're
[49:08] going to get adopted is the opening of
[49:09] the
[49:10] word what is them to do if I'm I'm I'm
[49:12] going home see he thought then now
[49:14] normally in his mind he thought I'm
[49:17] going to die there's going to be a great
[49:19] blast I'm going to be killed let him not
[49:21] find me he's talking about don't I don't
[49:23] want nobody to mourn me just let me go
[49:25] on tell the family to think I just took
[49:27] a walk and they won't find me hideing me
[49:30] away somewhere if I'm going to go away
[49:32] just let me go maybe Joseph will find my
[49:35] Bible laying here someday and let him
[49:37] use it if I'm going away let me go Lord
[49:40] and I had my hands out and all at once
[49:42] something hit my hand I don't know I
[49:45] can't say did I go to sleep I don't know
[49:48] did I go in a trance I don't know was it
[49:50] a vision I can't tell you only thing I
[49:53] can say is just the same thing like them
[49:55] Angels was and it struck my hand it was
[49:58] a sword had pearl handle real pretty had
[50:02] a guard over it with gold boy when God
[50:04] does something he don't do it he does it
[50:06] the right
[50:08] way cuz this was going to be a symbol of
[50:12] what he was going to do right all right
[50:16] and I remember years ago brother Harris
[50:18] preached a sermon right here he said the
[50:20] swords got to be in your hand
[50:22] too you got to have a sword in the hand
[50:25] experience amen you so I've never had it
[50:27] where I had you got to have a word
[50:31] experience right it's gold the blade
[50:34] look like something like a chrome like
[50:36] silver only it was real shiny and it was
[50:38] so feather edged sharp oh my and I
[50:40] thought isn't that the prettiest thing
[50:43] look it just fit his hand
[50:45] too it just fit my hand I thought that's
[50:48] awful pretty but I said hey I'm always
[50:50] afraid of them things a sword and I
[50:52] thought what will I do with that and
[50:55] just then a voice shook down through
[50:56] through there that rocked the rocks and
[50:57] said it's the sword of the
[51:02] king then I came out of it the sword of
[51:04] the king now if he'd have said a sword
[51:06] of a a k of a king but it said the sword
[51:10] of the king and there's only one king
[51:11] and that's God and he was had one sword
[51:15] and that's his word what I live by that
[51:17] so help me God standing here over this
[51:19] holy desk and with his holy word L
[51:21] listen if brother Bron was a liar he was
[51:23] a good
[51:25] one yeah right cuz I believe all
[51:29] that I believe it from my
[51:32] heart that God is leading him somewhere
[51:34] just like you can take your life and God
[51:37] see God leading you to the different
[51:40] places
[51:42] amen it took somebody to be our example
[51:45] though that God could be so close to
[51:48] that he could use him so much that we'd
[51:50] see that as an example and then we can
[51:52] say that ain't nothing but the truth and
[51:54] then we reap the benefits off of it you
[51:56] may never had a have a literal sword
[51:58] that was for brother brandham that was
[52:00] for a prophetic Ministry it was to show
[52:03] him he had the word of God not a word of
[52:07] God and then he can have boldness and
[52:09] confidence to stand in a pull pit and
[52:11] tell you thus sayith the Lord and tell
[52:13] you that what the first seal second seal
[52:15] third seal fourth fifth sixth and
[52:16] seventh and tell you with confidence
[52:18] what it
[52:19] was that's why any Minister should have
[52:22] confidence when they come up here to the
[52:23] pull pit you have confidence in what
[52:25] you're talking about if you don't
[52:27] believe it you need to sit
[52:29] down cuz you're doing your harm you're
[52:31] doing that harm worse than you're doing
[52:33] your harm CU you're harming the
[52:36] people and he has one sword and that's
[52:39] his word what I live by that so help me
[52:42] God standing over this holy desk with
[52:44] the holy word laying here it's the word
[52:47] oh my what a day we're living in now
[52:50] watch what the angel tells him about
[52:53] that
[52:54] scene oh what a day we're living in what
[52:56] a great thing see the mystery look the
[52:59] mystery and
[53:01] secret the third standing there when
[53:04] this left me something just came to me
[53:06] and said Don't Fear now what do he tell
[53:09] Joshua Don't Fear Place the people in
[53:11] the land do it as I command you brother
[53:15] brandom get off this mountain go do what
[53:17] I'm telling you to do and give it to the
[53:19] people pure and unadulterated do not
[53:21] back up do not get caught up in anything
[53:25] you just give it the way I got it now
[53:27] look he said now I didn't hear no voice
[53:30] like on the inside of me spoke I have to
[53:32] just tell you the truth this exactly
[53:34] what happened something hid and said
[53:37] Don't Fear this is that third
[53:41] pull okay this is that third pull which
[53:45] was what his sword in his hand the
[53:47] commission for him to not come off the
[53:50] Evangelical field but quit being an
[53:51] evangelist
[53:56] he had a work to do and when that sword
[53:59] hit his hand when he come down off that
[54:01] mountain I believe just like he would do
[54:03] me and you put a minister in the pull
[54:05] pit to say something and you say that
[54:07] ain't nothing but the truth and that's
[54:08] for me and I'm going to my next
[54:11] step this is for me and I'm going to
[54:13] bring people in people I I love it when
[54:15] y'all have comment about people that
[54:17] come in here to preach cuz I want them
[54:19] to lift you up listening to me all the
[54:21] time get could get
[54:23] boring but when you get something from
[54:25] God I don't care if you get five minutes
[54:27] you get something from God if it comes
[54:29] from God it's
[54:31] Eternal now what you do with it that's
[54:35] on you don't
[54:37] fear I just have to tell you the truth
[54:40] don't fear this is that third pull now
[54:43] what is the third pull the third pull is
[54:45] the opening of the word the third pull
[54:48] is that Unwritten part that he said was
[54:50] on the inside of that pyramid Mountain
[54:53] that nobody could read but him himself
[54:56] amen right on the outside we've got
[54:58] we've got the I may have this quote or I
[55:00] may laid it to the side he said we've
[55:02] got the water baptism when he goes
[55:03] through all the doctrines we've got all
[55:06] that but the unwritten part is what we
[55:09] are living this day
[55:11] for right the Joshua anointing is for us
[55:14] to be placed yes sir not just to believe
[55:17] the message not just to get born again
[55:19] which you got to start you got to
[55:23] do oh what a day we're living in
[55:27] mystery and the
[55:29] secret so now watch the third poll is an
[55:34] adoption Ministry a placing Ministry not
[55:37] the first pull and second pull first
[55:39] pull and second pull and I think I got
[55:42] it in my notes Here the first pull and
[55:43] second pull was bringing people to the
[55:47] to the church or bringing people to the
[55:49] meetings and Watching God heal them
[55:54] physically physically
[55:57] all right but now remember that's
[56:00] temporary I would I would I'm not going
[56:02] to assume I would say probably 99% of
[56:05] the people that come across the platform
[56:07] during his time of ministry have already
[56:09] passed
[56:10] away because there's been 60 years and
[56:13] they might if they were in their 20s it'
[56:14] been 80 something maybe just some small
[56:16] kids but most people have already passed
[56:18] on to their reward but the reward is is
[56:20] the healing of the
[56:22] body
[56:25] permanently and that's the
[56:28] placing Hey listen what did Joshua
[56:31] Place
[56:33] Israelites they were already in the
[56:35] family he couldn't Place some of that
[56:37] wasn't even in the family he didn't
[56:39] place he didn't place the Hittites and
[56:40] the jebusites he said drive them out
[56:44] right yes so now look even though Joshua
[56:49] he he now he has made it into to Jordan
[56:53] the waters parted the ministers as soon
[56:55] as they put their feet in the water the
[56:57] water parted is that all right all right
[57:00] the water parted the ark went across
[57:02] they went across on dry land showing
[57:05] that Joshua had the same God that Moses
[57:07] did come on
[57:09] somebody didn't God do that for him at
[57:12] the Red Sea part of the Red Sea they
[57:13] walked across on dry land same way
[57:15] happened in this Jordan but once they
[57:17] got over into the
[57:19] land think about this once they got over
[57:22] into the land something else had to
[57:25] happen
[57:28] Joshua 5:2 at that time the Lord said
[57:31] unto Joshua now this is not Joshua
[57:33] having a promin God's telling Joshua
[57:36] make these sharp knives and circumcise
[57:38] again the children of Israel the second
[57:43] time all right and Joshua made sharp
[57:46] knives and if some of you kids don't
[57:48] know what that is your parents can tell
[57:50] you what it is circumcision but it's a
[57:53] type of the baptism of the Holy Ghost a
[57:56] type of taking excess skin sin skin off
[58:00] of you okay everybody with me on that
[58:03] and to be an Israelite the commission
[58:05] that Abraham was given was is to
[58:07] circumcise all of his household and
[58:10] himself right right okay everybody with
[58:13] me on that but what had happened while
[58:15] they were in the Journey of Israel the
[58:18] ones that had been circumcised when they
[58:21] were in Egypt have all
[58:23] died and the young ones that had come up
[58:26] under that
[58:27] Ministry think about it that come up
[58:30] under that Ministry had not been
[58:32] circumcised they were Jews cuz they were
[58:33] born Jews right but there was there was
[58:36] a little extra needed to be cut off yes
[58:40] before they got
[58:42] placed are you with me had a little
[58:45] extra skin sin and skin sounds a lot
[58:51] alike and Joshua made him sharp knives
[58:53] now watch he didn't circumcise babies
[58:55] the people were in their 20s and 30s and
[58:58] 40s now
[59:01] men think about
[59:04] it
[59:06] yeah but now watch what a mighty God we
[59:09] serve watch what he did and this is the
[59:11] cause why Joshua did circumcise all the
[59:13] people that came out of Egypt that were
[59:15] males even all the men of War died in
[59:19] the wilderness by the way after they
[59:21] came out of Egypt now look some of them
[59:23] came out of Egypt but they brought Egypt
[59:25] with them right Dayan Kora all the
[59:28] different ones that had problems with
[59:30] Moses they brought Egypt out with them
[59:32] and sometimes you and I we bring Egypt
[59:35] which is what the world out with
[59:38] us now all the people that came out were
[59:42] circumcised but all the people were born
[59:44] in the wilderness by the way as they
[59:46] came forth out of Egypt them they had
[59:48] not
[59:53] circumcised so now I didn't put the next
[59:56] verse down there but the next verse is
[59:59] is that Joshua circumcised all those men
[1:00:03] there had to be some hundreds of
[1:00:04] thousands of
[1:00:07] males it was on the hill of the foreskin
[1:00:10] and that's what it is still
[1:00:11] today but they had to wait until they
[1:00:15] were healed up because I promise you you
[1:00:19] get circumcised at 40 years old you're
[1:00:21] going to walk different
[1:00:26] physically now we're talking spiritually
[1:00:28] though we get that circumcision now we
[1:00:31] had a circumcision when we give our life
[1:00:33] to
[1:00:34] Christ all right but God wants to put us
[1:00:37] in a
[1:00:38] position that the world's not there
[1:00:41] anymore he wants to place us as
[1:00:44] Israelites spiritually we are Israelites
[1:00:47] going
[1:00:48] in but there's a little bit extra we got
[1:00:51] to get off before this adoption can take
[1:00:53] place everybody with me
[1:00:56] right so they had to wait several days
[1:00:59] until they could till they were all
[1:01:01] healed up and then they continued on so
[1:01:04] I believe that's what's happening now
[1:01:06] folks we are a healing this is our
[1:01:09] healing time our circumcision of the
[1:01:12] mind of all the things that we've still
[1:01:15] been hanging on from
[1:01:19] Egypt well pray for
[1:01:23] me brother B said look is this sign of
[1:01:26] the insert
[1:01:28] 1962 if this is the third pull then
[1:01:32] there's a great ministry lying ahead all
[1:01:34] right this is before he preached the
[1:01:36] seals I don't know I can't say I don't
[1:01:40] know now listen real close and don't
[1:01:42] misinterpret this I want to ask you
[1:01:45] something let's go back just a minute
[1:01:47] the church knows it's the truth the
[1:01:49] scientific world knows is the truth
[1:01:51] people are sitting here tonight and many
[1:01:53] still living that was standing on the
[1:01:55] river when that voice spoke that out and
[1:01:57] said as John the Baptist I guess the
[1:02:00] believe sign people didn't believe that
[1:02:02] happened I hope I wish they would change
[1:02:04] us to disbelieve the
[1:02:06] sign biggest bunch of unbelievers I ever
[1:02:09] seen in my
[1:02:10] life but you know what I pray for them
[1:02:13] yeah that God will do something of
[1:02:15] course they're praying for us to get out
[1:02:16] of it so me it's a
[1:02:18] paradox all the people that have left
[1:02:20] the message they've got their they've
[1:02:22] got their
[1:02:23] list well I'll promise you if they you
[1:02:25] leave this message your name is not on
[1:02:27] the Lamb's Book of
[1:02:29] Life so you might be on a list and you
[1:02:31] might be in a book but you ain't in the
[1:02:33] book it we're written
[1:02:34] in I'm sorry this is a separating time
[1:02:37] it's time to get rid of the foolishness
[1:02:39] time to get rid of the excess skin time
[1:02:42] to cut that thing out and throw it away
[1:02:44] get rid of it if Joshua took hundreds of
[1:02:47] thousands of males got them together and
[1:02:50] got them listen to folk if you walked up
[1:02:53] to me and said buddy I got to circumcise
[1:02:55] you and I'm 6 5 years old me and you
[1:02:57] have
[1:03:02] fight but if I believe that what that
[1:03:04] man said that you're not going to go
[1:03:07] into this promised land and get you're
[1:03:09] here but you're not going to get your
[1:03:10] inheritance you're going to be hated
[1:03:15] God's not going to bless
[1:03:18] you right I'd say do
[1:03:21] it be it unto me according to Thy word
[1:03:25] right praise the
[1:03:27] Lord as John the Baptist was sent the
[1:03:29] message of the first coming so is this
[1:03:32] the second message of the second coming
[1:03:34] remember and if it's finished what did
[1:03:36] John do now John was the one who said
[1:03:38] behold now remember John was the third
[1:03:41] Elijah
[1:03:42] right he was commissioned to do one
[1:03:45] thing no prayer lines no healings preach
[1:03:49] six months and got his head cut off
[1:03:52] that's right stayed in jail most of that
[1:03:56] but he was to do one thing and point the
[1:03:58] world to Jesus Christ point the world to
[1:04:02] the son of
[1:04:04] man that's him it's the hour has it
[1:04:08] arrived my brother I don't say it has I
[1:04:11] don't know but I'm asking you I want you
[1:04:13] to think or will this be the time when
[1:04:16] it all will be
[1:04:19] again Behold the Lamb of God or the time
[1:04:24] of Malachi 4 to return the hearts of the
[1:04:26] children back to the faith of the
[1:04:28] fathers will it be such a blast that
[1:04:30] will do such Mighty things until it will
[1:04:32] set the church has been slopping and
[1:04:35] cannot understand the mysteries of God I
[1:04:37] believe that's
[1:04:41] true when they say that Mighty blast
[1:04:44] sweep when they see that Mighty blast
[1:04:46] sweep forth will it turn their hearts
[1:04:48] back to the father as the Bible said it
[1:04:50] would or was this the message already
[1:04:54] passed that should have done it
[1:04:58] I don't
[1:05:00] know look at the junction he said could
[1:05:03] it be what I preached from 47 to 63 or
[1:05:05] up until that
[1:05:06] time and then it struck
[1:05:09] him watch this it took you till 1965 for
[1:05:13] him to say this but at the Ed once at
[1:05:16] the end time notice the very day when
[1:05:18] this messenger not when he starts on but
[1:05:20] when he begins to Clare declare his
[1:05:23] message see the first pull
[1:05:26] was healing the second pull prophesying
[1:05:30] third pull the opening of the word the
[1:05:32] Mysteries
[1:05:34] revealed no more there's no more higher
[1:05:36] order to reveal the word than prophets
[1:05:39] so he's taking himself out of the
[1:05:40] Evangelistic role he's put himself into
[1:05:42] a prophetic role we know God did that he
[1:05:44] didn't do
[1:05:45] it but the only way the prophet can be
[1:05:48] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:05:51] the third pull was the opening of them
[1:05:54] Seven Seals so there's no Myster now we
[1:05:56] know what the opening of the seals were
[1:05:57] it was the third pull it was that third
[1:06:00] pull to pull it all in to to get the
[1:06:03] excess skin to circumcise again us
[1:06:08] rededicate
[1:06:09] ourself amen realize you got to realize
[1:06:13] you're in the promised land
[1:06:15] first if you realize you're in the
[1:06:17] promised land you got an
[1:06:19] inheritance and this message was sent to
[1:06:22] give you that
[1:06:24] inheritance what was K a type of the
[1:06:26] believer right what Caleb say he was 40
[1:06:29] when he started 80 when he got to the
[1:06:31] promised land and he said give me that
[1:06:33] mountain that's mine he said I'm more
[1:06:36] able now I feel better now I wish I was
[1:06:38] like
[1:06:40] that
[1:06:42] yeah if I felt as good at 80 as I did 40
[1:06:46] bring me on
[1:06:47] 80 but we a we know it ain't
[1:06:51] happening but listen that was his
[1:06:53] Revelation that that was his Mountain
[1:06:55] right and what Joshua Joshua didn't say
[1:06:57] now I'll go I'll go get it for you no he
[1:07:00] said go remember he took his own men up
[1:07:03] there and took the thing right no more
[1:07:06] there's no more higher order than
[1:07:07] prophets but the way a prophet can be
[1:07:09] Vindicated is by the word and remember
[1:07:11] the third pole was the opening of them
[1:07:13] themselves to reveal the Hidden Truths
[1:07:15] that's been sealed in the
[1:07:18] word so now look let's just sum this up
[1:07:20] and then we'll we'll stop right here the
[1:07:23] first and second Paul consider consisted
[1:07:26] of holding the hand of the person the
[1:07:30] hand changing colors and making bumps
[1:07:32] and all that stuff that we know that
[1:07:33] right then it moved which was it moved
[1:07:36] to the second PA which was brother Bown
[1:07:38] didn't even have to touch
[1:07:40] him he just and I love on that on that
[1:07:43] video that he starts doing
[1:07:45] this he starts doing this what's he
[1:07:47] doing he's contacting their Spirit he's
[1:07:50] watching what's going on he says you're
[1:07:53] so and so from so and so your name's
[1:07:56] Miss so and so you're from such and such
[1:07:59] street how plain was that he was looking
[1:08:02] right at it what he was
[1:08:04] doing so Millions gathered around
[1:08:07] brother brandom in the first and second
[1:08:09] poll
[1:08:11] amen the third poll The Mystery of the
[1:08:14] word that was sealed since Jesus Christ
[1:08:16] was on Earth Millions left
[1:08:20] him
[1:08:22] millions millions left when he started
[1:08:25] preaching when the third pole came into
[1:08:27] into being same way with Jesus you take
[1:08:30] Jesus Christ what happened to him first
[1:08:33] pole Z Paul they loved it when he took a
[1:08:37] when he took Five Loaves and two fishes
[1:08:40] and fed a whole
[1:08:42] Community 6,000 people that's more than
[1:08:44] in Lula and well there's about 60,000 in
[1:08:47] Hall County but you could feed a big a
[1:08:50] big town with 6,000 people you he fed
[1:08:52] them all in one day and picked up enough
[1:08:56] for them to have another day they loved
[1:08:58] it so boy that was all around him but
[1:09:00] when he stood one day and said I and my
[1:09:02] father are
[1:09:03] one I come to do thy will oh Lord I'm
[1:09:08] the one that Joshua was talking about or
[1:09:10] Moses is talking about I'm the one
[1:09:13] remember they said Moses we've got Moses
[1:09:15] he's our prophet he said if You' have
[1:09:17] known Moses you'd know me right and they
[1:09:20] said I and my father are one they hated
[1:09:23] him for that they hat brother random
[1:09:26] when he he started preaching Doctrine
[1:09:29] the doctrine that was the truth that
[1:09:32] nobody had ever seen before
[1:09:36] am now watch we'll close right
[1:09:42] here we've been on this for a long time
[1:09:45] I always go back to the questions and
[1:09:46] answers on the seals this is on the he
[1:09:49] preached the first seal to the to the
[1:09:52] Sixth Seal and then this was Sunday
[1:09:55] morning I believe it was or either
[1:09:57] Saturday he stopped and had questions
[1:09:59] and answers right before he preached the
[1:10:01] seventh seal everybody with me all right
[1:10:04] in chronological order that's the way it
[1:10:06] went there was a gap between six and
[1:10:07] seven there always is all right now look
[1:10:10] remember brother R told him you're not
[1:10:12] getting it it's not for you it's gone
[1:10:14] from you well now this is the end of the
[1:10:17] quote I read you the quote before this
[1:10:19] is the end of
[1:10:21] it he said don't try to make yourself
[1:10:23] odd to be a Christian cuz you take
[1:10:26] yourself away from God and you you if
[1:10:28] you can understand it this is that third
[1:10:32] pull you should have caught that the
[1:10:35] other
[1:10:39] day he'd made all that he' made all that
[1:10:42] quote that that I've read to you many
[1:10:43] many times it's gone from you it's not
[1:10:45] for you uh it's not the right crystal
[1:10:48] there's voices going through here you
[1:10:49] should have picked it up in other words
[1:10:51] spiritual voices voice of God he said
[1:10:54] but he said right here he said you
[1:10:56] should have understood or caught that
[1:10:58] the other day you remember there'll be
[1:11:00] no impersonation like there was of the
[1:11:02] other two so there's not going to be
[1:11:04] another prayer line like brother R
[1:11:07] had
[1:11:09] right cuz what would happen when and
[1:11:11] even under the second pull under the
[1:11:14] second pull the lady or or man would
[1:11:16] come up and he'd say you're from so and
[1:11:18] so and you're from so and so and you're
[1:11:19] from and now like oh yes that's right
[1:11:21] brother that's right that's right that's
[1:11:22] right now that didn't mean they're saved
[1:11:25] right that didn't mean they knew nothing
[1:11:27] about the word of God they got healed
[1:11:29] that was a healing M Ministry but when
[1:11:32] he started opening the word of God up
[1:11:34] there wasn't a whole lot of amens a lot
[1:11:36] of
[1:11:37] omes CU he was digging into what they
[1:11:40] had never seen before but it wasn't for
[1:11:44] them amen right that was reserved for me
[1:11:48] and you
[1:11:50] amen you remember there'll be no
[1:11:53] impersonation like there was the other
[1:11:55] two there's no one ever going to
[1:11:59] preach like brother Brandon
[1:12:02] preached the
[1:12:05] Mysteries no
[1:12:08] one they impersonated the first pole
[1:12:11] they had blood on their hands they had
[1:12:12] oil that would drip out of their face
[1:12:14] and oil that would drip they'd have a
[1:12:17] they'd have a stick that would go down
[1:12:18] here or a pipe and they'd run away it
[1:12:20] was all
[1:12:21] fake some of it was real yes God honored
[1:12:24] the he didn't have to get honor the
[1:12:26] person right but there was
[1:12:28] impersonations but you can't impersonate
[1:12:31] the word of God that's never been
[1:12:33] shown who can who can interpret it only
[1:12:37] God can interpret it and he can only
[1:12:40] give it to a prophet right I'll do
[1:12:43] nothing Amos said unless I reveal it
[1:12:46] first to my servant the
[1:12:49] prophet so without a prophet it's what I
[1:12:51] was telling the brother the other day
[1:12:53] without a prophet you don't get nothing
[1:12:56] right it had to come through a prophet
[1:12:59] we had to know what was going
[1:13:01] on and brother Brown said
[1:13:04] look so see that's as far as you should
[1:13:07] know now just remember that you see now
[1:13:09] there's something taking place in this
[1:13:11] room we're still on the The Sixth Seal
[1:13:13] the questions and answers on the seals
[1:13:15] there's something taking place in this
[1:13:17] room and there's something here there's
[1:13:18] actual in this room
[1:13:21] Angels voice of God see but how you
[1:13:25] can't if you can't hear the natural
[1:13:27] Voice without something to send it out
[1:13:31] how are you going to hear the spiritual
[1:13:34] voice what he was telling them that hole
[1:13:37] from the first seal open all the way up
[1:13:39] to there they did not get that Unwritten
[1:13:45] part if you can't hear the natural voice
[1:13:48] his natural voice how are you going to
[1:13:51] hear the spiritual voice I hope you
[1:13:53] don't key in on my voice I hate my
[1:13:56] voice I can't listen to myself on tape I
[1:13:59] don't like
[1:14:00] it it's not good but can you hear what's
[1:14:04] being said that God can give
[1:14:08] something you know I'm going
[1:14:10] to um let's stand to our feet we'll get
[1:14:13] musicians we'll just stop right there
[1:14:18] um you know sometimes we are
[1:14:21] uh we get so spiritual about things we
[1:14:24] we want to say thou and thee
[1:14:28] and now my God's Not he don't speak
[1:14:31] Southern language but he understands
[1:14:33] it so I talk to him just like I talked
[1:14:36] to you I drive down the road I say Lord
[1:14:39] now there's something going on something
[1:14:41] going on around here now what is it
[1:14:44] let's talk about this is it this is it
[1:14:47] that and I say maters and ters and ha
[1:14:48] and told as brother R said and G yet and
[1:14:53] he understands everything I said yeah I
[1:14:55] don't have to say thee and thou and
[1:14:57] though and and all that I'm sorry we
[1:14:59] don't have to because he's a god of
[1:15:02] variety he's a God that deals with you
[1:15:03] just what I'm the point I'm trying to
[1:15:04] make is he dealt with brother brandham
[1:15:07] the way brother brandham saw life right
[1:15:10] the way he saw life is how God
[1:15:13] interpreted everything and everything
[1:15:15] had an example to it the
[1:15:18] bull there was the third pull speaking
[1:15:21] of the word all these different things
[1:15:23] the fish catch the fish pulled his guts
[1:15:26] out the posum walking up to his house it
[1:15:29] was all in nature and he speaks to us
[1:15:32] the way we can understand that what
[1:15:35] makes it it's going to be our fault that
[1:15:36] we don't make it
[1:15:38] folks God has talked plain to you just
[1:15:40] like you hear him talking or somebody
[1:15:43] else talking to you maybe your brother
[1:15:44] sister or whoever that's what God's
[1:15:46] talking to you with everybody with me so
[1:15:50] let's don't think it's some booming
[1:15:51] voice and sometimes maybe it is
[1:15:55] God was the Living Word made manifest
[1:15:58] and they missed
[1:16:00] it is it the Living Word made manifest
[1:16:03] today and are we missing
[1:16:07] it are you hearing the voice of God or
[1:16:09] you just hearing the
[1:16:11] voice right are you letting it go
[1:16:15] deep are you really honing in on not
[1:16:18] what mistakes I make and what mistakes
[1:16:20] brother randam make or brother Aaron or
[1:16:23] or brother Luis or brother Bob or
[1:16:25] anybody else listen you can find
[1:16:28] anything you want to look
[1:16:29] for
[1:16:31] anything like brother Dell always said
[1:16:33] he said give me a quote he said I
[1:16:35] promise you in about 10 minutes I can
[1:16:36] give you three quotes that sound
[1:16:37] different than that
[1:16:39] one I said sound
[1:16:41] different now Jesus himself God stood
[1:16:44] one day and he said if you don't eat my
[1:16:45] flesh and drink my blood you'll have no
[1:16:47] part with
[1:16:49] me now did we just go jump out and start
[1:16:51] being cannibals we know what he said by
[1:16:53] interpretation by the Holy
[1:16:56] Ghost I said interpretation by the Holy
[1:17:00] Ghost we understood what he was saying
[1:17:02] so the now the the word this Unwritten
[1:17:04] word you listen that's why brother R
[1:17:07] said we got to have Revelation more than
[1:17:10] anything cuz you can sit here and you
[1:17:12] can do as as they're doing now you
[1:17:14] giving them something and they've
[1:17:15] already got a quote they've already got
[1:17:16] this set opposite for it you tell them
[1:17:20] this you already got this opposite for
[1:17:21] it right you can't get it but by
[1:17:24] revelation that's the unwritten part so
[1:17:26] you listen you're not going to find it
[1:17:27] in
[1:17:30] here you're going to find it with this
[1:17:35] in
[1:17:37] here you're going to find it not here
[1:17:40] you can you can find all kind of listen
[1:17:42] you can find contradictions because it's
[1:17:44] what you're looking for if you take this
[1:17:46] Bible and give it to a Baptist he's
[1:17:47] going to preach out this very same Bible
[1:17:49] I got in my hand
[1:17:50] today with what three eyes trinitarian
[1:17:54] eyes
[1:17:55] right he's going to see it with an
[1:17:56] eternal hell eyes Bible does say
[1:17:58] Everlasting Eternal punishment there is
[1:18:01] an eternal punishment but there's not an
[1:18:03] eternal hell right we know that because
[1:18:05] there only one form of eternal life and
[1:18:07] it's so simple just say God's the only
[1:18:09] person that's got eternal life why would
[1:18:11] he be in hell why would he put people in
[1:18:12] hell and give them eternal life pretty
[1:18:15] simple but you know what they'll hang
[1:18:16] their soul on
[1:18:17] it I want to ask you a question before
[1:18:19] we close what are you hanging your soul
[1:18:22] on right you hanging your soul on some
[1:18:25] God's going to send somebody
[1:18:27] else or he's already sent that
[1:18:30] person we just need to know what he's
[1:18:32] saying because I believe it was the
[1:18:34] voice of God in the end time for a group
[1:18:36] of people there's going to be people
[1:18:38] folks that's going to fall away just
[1:18:40] like first pull second pull
[1:18:43] crowds pack them in love the brother
[1:18:47] love the brother love brother brandom
[1:18:48] loved you love me we could F this
[1:18:51] building up if we start having signs and
[1:18:53] wonders
[1:18:55] right but the word of God is the whole
[1:18:57] thing that's right and sometimes it may
[1:18:59] be dull and it's just what you do with
[1:19:01] it let's sing a
[1:19:04] song I have

[1:22:25] some of them did hold on to that promise

[1:22:29] day they was going to get to the
[1:22:30] promised land they knew they weren't in
[1:22:32] the promised land but they were going to
[1:22:34] get to it but it had to be a journey
[1:22:36] brother John 40 years
[1:22:38] long to get rid of the
[1:22:43] unbelievers cuz we didn't get into it
[1:22:45] but we'll get into it later on the third
[1:22:47] pull we know it's the opening of the
[1:22:49] word but as the word
[1:22:51] opens and you deny it
[1:22:57] that's where Jesus went to hell and
[1:22:58] preached to people that we eternally
[1:23:00] lost there's no
[1:23:02] way they can find God they shut the door
[1:23:06] let's not be that way but it is the
[1:23:08] third poll it's part of it it's part of
[1:23:10] the third poll that we got to we got to
[1:23:12] cover that there is a group of people
[1:23:14] that will send their day of Grace away
[1:23:16] and still sit in a message Church
[1:23:19] brother rown said still thinking they
[1:23:21] get the Holy
[1:23:22] Ghost you know why cuz they have been
[1:23:24] taught
