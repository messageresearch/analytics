========================================

hello he's going to be glad let's sing at Jesus the light of the world baby Saints of life I love you Jesus foreign we get ready to change those I need you to pray for me I've got to go to speak in Indianapolis somebody is in a meeting where I was once before and they've invited me and Janet to go up there and share a story and I said well you know always tell me I did not do this God did this and so I could I'm going to say that and go to Las Vegas I'm just thank you I met a couple guys through this that really were strong in the word of the Lord and they called me once a while so when they're praying and it's one of them are really close to him but he's Way Out West I don't know if we'll go see Jack Kelly done but he's a good brother to rematch my heart foreign thank you good to see everybody in the house of the Lord if you like turning the Bible turn to Revelations one and then to Revelations 13. we're trying to continue home with these things I hope you're enjoying maybe some of the things that you've forgotten over all of the years that you used to study about and go back and study over them again you know and fall into the Book of Revelations it's really been helpful to me to uh you know go back and review a lot of things and see what we used to talk about uh you know back in the in the late 60s and early 70s we used to talk about the Book of Revelations a lot so you know I I really like to go back and look at it all right now we have a special announcement tonight the Lord willing this coming Sunday afternoon brother Bob black will be preaching yes for a sermon amen mating on his leaving column in his life and we talked about it and I told him to run like crazy and you know until the Lord ran him down and then the Lord could use him and until he tried that a little and he said Sunday that he was ready to go so the Lord willingness coming Sunday he will be preaching his uh first Sunday I mean for service and then probably the next weekend we will have the ordination because that will be when brother Bob's dad and Mama will be down they'd be watching so that's the advantages of Amen of these now they can that's right they can sit there and cry all they want to and it won't affect him at all they can holler and scream and run through the house and pull their hair out it won't affect him that's really good you know that's right you know sometimes you want to look around and you want to do that yourself but anyhow we'll do that the Lord willingness this Sunday and also now remember this is the last time to be able to sign up for the banquet because we've got to be able to order the food so if you don't try it at night don't come tomorrow you know because we're done uh having everything catered and all and fixed and we you know we will have that done okay remember two now the Lord willing this coming Wednesday which will be the what I wrote it down somewhere but really be the 13th my brother brother Tom Ernest will be with us preaching the Wednesday night service so remember that any other announcement I generally forget something that you know I don't know if I told you Amy Jefferson later in the morning they're inducing labor on tomorrow Amy tomorrow okay so that's uh we'll be kept in touch with that you know we're pretty good at doing some of those things because I had to pick a baby calf up yesterday and carry it up the bank and I guess it's yesterday or day before and carried up a bank and it slipped and slimy just with a newborn and so I go down and maybe they'll let me assist them when he helped a little bit at least it cleared up the body I can boil water I'm sure if they're watching that they'll get a good life all right Revelations 1 and Revelations 13. let's pray your lord Jesus we thank you Father for all things and we know and realized it you are God and you change not and that all things are possible with you yes and we just have to believe it we ask you now that you'd be where Sister Amy tomorrow Lord let it be a short time and everything be okay but we're looking forward to that yes absolutely and we just thank you for you loving your grace unto us in the day and the hour that we're living upon the Earth thank you for touching these that I've been sick among us and bringing them back together and taking care of some of these old colds and things that we've had and just continue to make yourself manifest as the Healer in our bodies in our lives we love you and we thank you now come as we read your word and as we talk about you and this have your way with us forgive our sins because we want to stand complete in you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen Revelations the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he said to signify it by his Angel into his servant John who by record of the word of God under the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand all right let's read Revelation 13. one through three we'll probably get too far in it but you know we tried to cover verse one our Sunday but let's read that verse Chapter 13 Verse 1 and I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and ten horns and upon his horns ten crowns and upon his heads the name of blasphemy and the Beast which I saw was like unto a leopard and his feet were as the feet of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a lion and the dragon gave him his power and his seat in great Authority and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered after the Beast you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word no no we have been going you know said coming through this part and I know it takes time and I could spend a greater length of time with just a little parts of notes that I run off but we try not to spend the time we're trying to get a point and that point is that we thank God for the opening of the word in the end times by way of the Prophet messenger amen so that we little uh Beyond beyond all ourselves illiterates uh can read the book of Revelations you know and understand a lot of the things that are there and um and we can Rejoice over it from some of the parts that we when we were you know back in organized religion depending upon Mankind we we would not be able to comprehend these things and to see that a lot of the things that we read of are not the great big scary that's been my point for about a month now is to try to get us to see that the Book of Revelations by the prophet speaking of the symbols then it it's not a great mystery anymore right and and we can see the simple things have already transpired right Among Us right and you know and seeing where we're living and see the hour that we're living and and to me now after being see like we have the most of us into the message for quite a few years and studying these things it's becoming like reading a newspaper you know you can you can just go home sit down get a newspaper and you can read and see these things are transpiring right now in the world right I'm already transpired or will transpire you know and right and it's unfolding it's becoming simple to understand amen and that way then we can see because I'm trying not to just cover what this is but bring it down to where we are remember we split one whole message on trying to get us to look at the fact of a compound meaning of scripture where that we could see these things and read them and realize this is to Israel in the tribulation period like I've told you seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen to where we are now all of it is dealing with Israel in a tribulation period amen all right and it's only taking a three and a half year period of time for all of those things to uh take place all right so it's right here right upon us and each one of these things that we see is what I've always tried to get you to look at whatever you're reading in the Bible is to look and and everything don't just drop down all at once that's right that's right you know I mean I mean Russia didn't become communist it was Russia then it became communist the it took quite a while you know all right we we've been through in our lives here in America great changes and great processes that started way back you know hundreds of years ago right and all and it's now unfolding as to seeing it where we're living at now well that's what the Bible is supposed to do he to to find out you know that that the dragon as we've covered through the 12th chapter a lot a little bit this past Sunday that that red dragon is Rome well that's all right we needed to know those things okay but what about you and I man see do we have their same Doctrine we won't get that far tonight on about the image to the Beast if we have time I'll try to cover it right at the end for a little but then we'll go on down into chapter 13 and covering the mark of the beast and things and sitting right in the system right there with the same Doctrine and idea you know and don't even realize it you know and swear to to you know to not be that right yeah and come to find out that's right where we're at what if we find out where we're at we can do something about it and you know you you can't know that a Doctrine is wrong and no matter what kind of a Doctrine trinities or anything you can't know they're wrong until truth is presented amen then once truth is presented then you can look at something and say oh okay I used to believe that but now I don't believe it that way anymore we'll see things have changed right and that's what this message is supposed to do to us open up the word until we can read it with our own glasses as we call it because we used to read it with Methodist glasses Madness glasses you know Presbyterian glasses you say well what do you mean by that I mean just what I said what we look through we only seen what we wanted to see by their Doctrine you know in their doings and things and and we couldn't read no difference out of it but now we know that we took up Sunday bring it in chapter 13. let's get on the end of the appointment that is chapter 13 starts off we see that it's the rise of the Catholic Church here in the United States as a civil and ecclesiastical powers developing here you know and that Rome today the Roman Catholic Church is not trying to conquer by force see because that would be the old Pagan wrong form but the Catholic church is Conquering by religious power amen you know amen their Doctrine their ideas amen now then we'll see when we get to the image of the Beast part that if you make an image to something then the image you're making is identical repeat of what you had the original right or it wouldn't be an image of it it would just be some form of lightness or some idea but when you see that you have the same Doctrine right then you can see that the church has really taken over you know you say well well you know they're not doing any problems with us right now but that may be true you know but that don't mean it ain't on the way that's right you said well how can they force us to do this that or the other yeah they're doing it now around the world Amen that's right if you are not looking at the lady of SIA to see that what lesosia means people's rights and you know that there's hardly a country in the world tonight that's not under um some kind of a Coupe problems you know whether they're out on the streets protesting or or whatever yep you know and these big countries can't do anything with them because if they raise up against them you know they're afraid of them and see then but don't look at the room now that we get into that we've got to see how Hagin Rome becomes power wrong right amen but it's the same identical Doctrine and ideas that's right the old Roman idea if we get down to read it to me was to divide and conquer well that's what it's doing now see divide and conquer you know to see us talking to the chiropractor today while he's working on my back a little bit and he was saying Sam he says if you ever seen the time when people are just not settled he said is there one thing one day and another thing another day and he said there's this some kind of a guy you know said he's he the government now has even hired him to try to figure out how they can help us but he was so contrary he said the article showed that that man was so contrary to us right that he was trying to put lower forth all of these doctrines from the islamics and the you know the al-qaedas all kind of things so now the government's hiring him to help try to help figure us out well it's just compromising amen that's right I mean you look at it today all around the world and everybody's trying to to get some kind of form of compromising idea but now listen what would we talking about our Sunday that the 13th chapter of Revelation is a marvelous thing because when the pope come over here to the United States he walked up 13 steps deserve communion to 13 people huh now that was just natural things happening you saw that was just an accident you know like I said you get around to figure on we will in a minute I mean on later on in in the this message or two down to 666 your name could be figured out to be 666. there's two places in the world sets on Seven Hill do you remember we covered that one I'm in Cincinnati but Cincinnati is not a religious ruling Factor nowhere you got to find the church sitting on those Hills so it had to be Rome Italy it's the only thing that that can come forth and America's number is 13. 13 stars 13 stripes okay the prophet said and she's in the 13th chapter of Revelation amen all right you say well now okay that's after we leave but the Forerunner is everything's not waiting do we leave this gonna start getting this no it's been building up from the time we came to America and America came into being from guard down to now these things are building up and we came here under the pretense of freedom from religion right right see the religious persecution then you can call it freedom I really really but religious persecution and people came here to try to find a new way and we found it but then now we turn around and give back the things that makes the world be like it was and what are we going to do right why don't you leave America if you don't like it I love it okay I thank God for America for the religious freedom that we still have to this moment right right now all right but getting up to that point now Hagen Rome because we'll get to it just a minute with the scripture Pagan Rome at one time ruled the world right right amen and as it did then the Bible was written to show us these things but why would you write a Bible if it's to be the uh it's to be for them not for the wise and put up to figure out but you know for the children of God to be able to understand amen he said well why didn't they write it out wrong would be this it would be any mystery to it that's right man so then we get into like Revelation 13 we read then you get into what like seven heads ten horns there's no way to draw these things out that's right and to show them right but then to see what they mean and then you can see what's transpiring in life right all right see then you can follow it now you know you'll read of of leopards bear Lions dragons he said well we don't know what that is and then they come along and that's that's the reason I say I appreciate God because see somebody could come along in them anyway could say well I think it means then yeah and brother Mark people said well I think it means that and he could go through and show and wait to go through and show brother colleague and come along so what I shall hear that it's this that line means this the bar means this this means that whoa one opinion's good as another one right right but when you have a prophet to tell you what these things mean right yeah all right Ben it's a settled matter because the prophet is interpreting what the Holy Spirit directed Demand right right yeah right that's right thank God for the crew to be able to stand in the day and be able to read the Bible that I remember when I used to read it as a you know a person in the Baptist Church I'd read and I would try to understand and I'd read any commentary that I could find or school always use a Scofield bible and and I'd always try to follow his footnotes and see what these things mean and and back in the early days when I was reading I could tell you what Daniel better memory then than I have now I had to write it down when I started breaking down these things but in the early days of when I was in the Baptist and reading the Bible myself then I would see these things and and it comes down from the means of Persians the Greeks all of the things coming down right down to Rome yep and Schofield even covers the papal wrong Pagan wrong becoming powerful wrong he had a lot of good footnotes from those times because you could follow the leanings the line but you couldn't follow it in the way that it was supposed to be done now I've emphasized this over and over to you and we'll try to do more of it tonight that the Book of Revelations that we've been reading we've come through now 7 8 9 10 11 12 up into 13. all right it's a continuation of the revealing of things that are transpiring right that's right you see it as I said trying to get you to understand you read Revelations six over there in the sixth heal you know and it doesn't say anything about 144 000. right it doesn't talk of any of those things it talks of earthquakes and things like that we'll see if you're limited with only that thought that's all you can think of even if you could read what the prophet would say that would be what you would have but then the level you know the the seventh chapter comes in to tell you the 144 000. right did seven eight nine you get into the trumpets and all of them sound to Israel yeah see it's a continually opening one makes a way for you understand the next man all right man now I've always tried to get you to to read the book of Daniel because the Book of Daniel is not a whole bunch of dreams and Visions telling many different things is God trying to show Daniel to be able to write then when he gets old over to the nights and all like that he really lays it down that I've come to show you the beginning and the ending but he's already been doing those things he'd already been revealing those things or making them known and then the Book of Daniel you remember we'll read in a minute but you remember Nebuchadnezzar had a dream all right I mean you know that Nebuchadnezzar had a dream of the four powers you know that Daniel in the seventh chapter had a dream of his own of the four powers God just keeps unfolding it unveiling it amen but see what I love about it dependence upon a prophet you know that Nebuchadnezzar's dream was gone from me you remember that right and he called in all of his dream interpreters you know he said tell me what my dream is and they said tell us a dream and we'll tell you he said well it's gone from me well it kept pressure and he pressured him in the Book of Daniel chapter one and going on into two you know go through that man they kept pressuring him and thank you wanting to know what the dream was because you know I I could tell a dream and they don't tell how many interpretations would be had out of you of my dream because I told you my dream right but what if I got up here and said I had a dream tell me the dream what do you mean tell me tell you your dream I can't tell you your dream and I'd say like Daniel did you know I mean like never could answer if you can't tell me what I dreamed how am I gonna know your interpretation is correct see the people would tell if they'd go to brother Branham and they'd tell him a dream they had and he'd say here's your dream even to sometimes writing down before the people got there right right the dream and the interpretation and just hand them the paper because he was running out of time he said that's the way you know whether it was a prophet or not here we go you tell me a dream and I said well you don't want to sound much I want you and that sounds like this and that sounds like it happened you know it might be but right around would tell people you know said why don't you leave this out of your dream s that's right and one brother sure would love to change things because he he was in some riding other horses and the thing back there he'd had a dream and run around and told him to answer to his dream well I'm going to take what wrote around and said about it I don't care what he said he didn't even dream that no because the prophet could tell you the answer and that's what Daniel said they were going to kill these guys the king finally said all right I'll just kill all of you and get me some more dream interpreter So Daniel got the word and he went before the Lord that's right the Lord showed him so when he come over to Nebuchadnezzar he said here's your dream well you know because of being able to do that he was exalted to a great position that's right I never can answer right yep but you know that a lot of times people would ask a profit what a dream was and he would have to tell them even though it was something bad yeah because he could only speak what God gave him right right see and I could tell you a dream and like I said I'd have 50 50 chance of being able to interpret it yeah no I mean wouldn't you you I tell you a drink you can you can make up something and you know and they've got these people that take your dreams and and try to tell you what it all is and you know they said well you dreamed this and then you dream this and you're dreaming this well then we know that there's a pattern here but that's not thus saith the Lord right trying to just go in one day and I'd say I want you all to interpret my dream and they said can we dream I said I don't even remember it yeah well they just put you in next you're right they just say next you know they send you out the door and but God told a prophet Daniel what the dream was and the interpretation that's right see then that way you can look at it for yourself and see let's let's go ahead and let's just go to Daniel 2. you just look at this from the point that we're talking about that Daniel's going to now tell the dream to have a connection didn't give him the interpretation Daniel 235 32 45 is what we'll try to run but it's for me this secret is not revealed to me for any wisdom that I have more than any living but that there are sick but for their sakes that shall make known the interpretation to the current King and that thou might us know the thoughts of my heart in other words where you won't kill these over here and I'm not trying to be involved above them but just right where you won't kill them all right to Thou King saw us and behold a great image this great image whose brightness was excellent stood before the and deformed thereof was terrible now look this image images head was refined gold it rest in his arms of silver in his belly and his ties of rice his legs of iron his feet part of iron and part of clay now watch this is really what I want to preach on but I got to cover the other part because I'm going to go to 34 and 45 you'll see in a minute thou shall are still that a stone was cut out without hands now there's what the suit Sayers and the things couldn't cover if they see the the people get what I'm saying the people that could tell you even Scofield could tell you what this iron and clay and the the gold and the Bryce and the things and tell you the people and he does he tells you the exact kingdoms that comes down who never can answer it and see Daniel tells part of the king is the the head of gold he tells it right all right well look what would be left out by mankind because in the time of all of these Kings and things what's going to happen verse 34 thou saw us still that a stone was cut out of cut out without hands which spoke the image All These Little Things upon his feet that were of iron and clay and break them to pieces yeah that's the day you and I are living right man in this day we're going to see that this message is that stone right now that's the way I believe it and I mean this message as being the entire Bible to be made known in the last days you understand what I mean by that this message is going to strike the image in the feet look at your drawing of Daniel and how that he's got Daniel up there and it droves and shows a line coming down and hitting that right image standing there in the feet amen because that's where the iron and the clay is that's Jeff and Eisenhower that's in this day right would you think that would be the point that mankind can't totally figure out the other say something's going to take place to watch now what will take place then was the iron to Clay the price of silver and gold broke into pieces together and come back to the shaft of the summer threshing floors and the wind carried them away that no place was found no more for them and the stone that smoked the image we became a great mountain and filled the whole Earth this is a dream and we will tell you the interpretations thereof what before the king and he's going to tell him the interpretation right right he told him to dream and Nebuchadnezzar said that's right it was exactly what I saw now give us the interpretation and the old king or the King of Kings look what God would say about Nebuchadnezzar because he's not making that remember look and Thou King are the king of kings for the god of Heaven hath given to your kingdom power and strength and Glory and whatsoever the children of men dwell speaks to the fields and the files of Heaven had be given into thine hands and that may be ruler over them all Ark this head of gold who was it right Nebuchadnezzar was the one he was talking to all right now verse 39. excuse me I've been doing pretty good I've had four Services all right we don't worry about that and after thee Joe Horizon another kingdom inferior today in other words mushroom you know right and another third Kingdom of brash which will by rule over all the Earth which was Grace under Alexander right right all right now I put these in there you know which was me the person Miser Persian is the kingdom would come in third one which is inferior uh the second one which is inferior the third one is Greece under Alexander one two three make sure you get right and a fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron very much an iron breakfast into pieces and subdue it to all things and as iron that breakth all these shall it break in pieces and Brews all right so what's he covering now he's going to show Daniel that never to measure Daniel's going to show him from there to our day right amen people would try to figure it out and you can't figure it out but a prophet would know amen he's on a show from gar all the way to where we're at amen all right not to just roam down there because he got down to the Ken told him straight you not anyone showed the Roman nation which was see was Nebuchadnezzar the Greeks the Persians and the things coming down Alexander and then coming on down to the Natural Roman government amen all right but it didn't stop there because the dream didn't stop dying that was what I said I wanted to preach that instead of these things but I have to get this out of the way see the the it's all back up there we just read it right out of the Bible the King You've seen until there's going to be a stone cut out of the mountain a stone and it's going to strike the image in the feet and destroy it it's going to bring forth and discipline right amen so he showed him all the way down to where we're at so now natural Rome is with what natural Rome was destroyed thank you man yeah natural Rome was destroyed the Roman government is not in control today right Rome ended me that guy after Calvary the natural Roman government but the Book of Revelation says that that thing is still going Daniel says it's still going and showed it all the way down to where we're at that's my point I want you to get see right because it comes down to iron you know and where is thy sauce to defeat and Co feet and Toes part apart part part of Potter's clay and heart of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saw us the iron mix with my reclaim now iron and Clay won't mix so it doesn't mean it's mixing it means they run together right they just go over each other and they get along with each other all right yep right it's not that they see they still both got their uh what would you call it composite of whatever they are one is iron iron won't mix with clay won't mix with iron it won't work right they're going to be there and mingle together until the end and as the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of play show the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken now we get on down to a little bit and you'll see and whereas thy sauce iron mixed with Myra clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men I'm certainly not talking about some kind of an iron statue and some kind of a doings it's going to be a Doctrine right that old doctrine of Rome the old Roman paganism and once the Catholic Church started off what has they got now paganism the same old Roman thing is coming back to totally today they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not bleed one to the other even an iron is not mixed with Clay amen yeah you don't keep it separated just enough but yet it's going to all be the same Doctrine and when we get to the image to the Beast you're going to see what that those things are the same Doctrine you say I'm blessed God I don't have no doctor of my sister one day she was talking about something the Catholic church I said would you mind explaining the difference between the Catholic Doctrine and the Baptist Doctrine she thought a minute and she said they worship Mary and we worship Jesus they don't worship Mary they just gotta heard of God but see that was her idea watch now and in the days of these Kings I ain't worried about them Nebuchadnezzar the means of Persians Alexander All In I ain't worried about natural Rome are you we've done been told even don't worry about communism right right right but worry about Catholicism right all right in the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom amen now that's what I'm looking for that's that's the thing I'm looking at I just look at the other to see where it leads down to where I'm at right and I see them over there and then I know what's over here you can see them as they come down to the Natural room Nebuchadnezzar and all that was Rome then it dropped down to the next and that it was still wrong and then you come down to the Catholic church and it's still wrong then you come down to the provisions and they're still wrong which you'll never be destroyed okay I thought you want to set up a kingdom in this day if we believe all of that's coming down to this day in the natural out there then why can't we believe what God says gonna take place all right remember he showed Nebuchadnezzar down to where we're at remember that was part of Nebuchadnezzar's dream to see a stone cut out of the Mountain Stone that wasn't Daniel's dream right that's right that would never can ever scream showed him right down to where we're at well for certain if those Natural Things took place why can't we believe the spiritual is going to take that all right why can't we be under expectation to see these things amen or are we so dried up in lady you'll see if we become common with it and just want to stay here all right that's right God has taken care of that old stuff about getting us out of here you know he just lets us get old I knew that was going to strike but it ain't gonna hit before we need it but you know we're going to get out of here one way then right I like what one brother said they said something about said he's 80 years old he said I'm not worried about it is it either I'm going to be in the ground and be raised or I'm going to be changed he said I'm closed and then the days of these Kings now remember what we covered Sunday that it's not Kings see Nebuchadnezzar and coming down Alexander and all that was Kings Rome had King Caesar and all this other you know Augustus and all of the whatever his name was I never could figure out all them things you say Herod but he's only over a little piece right here there was a big Caesar over the underground at all but according to what we found out there the other day it's not going to be king it's going to be dictators all right and bro the prophet said look where those dictators lean he said they leaned to Communism amen Michael we bought them we pay them but what's going to happen we can't pay them no more even in this paying them they're turning to Communism or some Islams or whatever you know you know I I don't understand it I'm a human being I'm not I don't count myself to be mean or arrogant but I'm just straight you know you get over there and you see those people going in and blowing up people and their own people now I put an end if we went but one way if I was the government I put an end to them people blowing them up if it wouldn't but for one way I'd get every one of those priests that teach that they're going to get 70 virgins he would get in the Pulpit if I had to hold a gun to his head with a and say you say one word it ain't right not so you tell them people they ain't getting 70 virgins they're going to hell for what they're doing you see that ain't a nice way for a Christian I ain't talking about a Christian that ain't talking about Christianity they're talking about natural things all right why can't those governments get shaken over there and say all right you kill any more we coming out of you they know who they are right right true sorry about that I know you don't like those foreign people out there bro don't like it but I'm just I'm flying I'm honest that's a way to put stop to them things you tell that high priest you quit teaching him he's going to heaven because of what he does you tell him he's going to hell right you know the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven Sent up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed and the kingdom shall not be left to other people that's right but it's your break into pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever amen amen much for as much as thou saw us that the stone was cut out of the mountain with our hands and then it break in pieces the iron the rice the clay the silver and the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and a dream is certain and the interpretation there are sure there's going to be a bride that will stand on the word right amen it's our two weeks to find out whether we're in it or not to find out that part all right yeah but now remember what I'll say it over and over if you notice through what we went down one two three four each one of those nations with just another Nation following it another Nation foreign and it stopped it wrong but the dream didn't stop it wrong well because it was going to be more to be told of the story right are you listening to get a point I know I'm calling one a lot I try to help it but I mean I'm guessing me but you see he showed him coming down to the four kingdoms that was going to end in natural Rome right right then he gave him the part of the dream that would show that it would have to convert from a natural government to continue on down because Rome was the last government that was shown right right so it's gonna have to change so he showed him that it showed him coming down to the end when Pagan Rome will have to become powerful wrong right yep she made more to the dream than never can ever saw Nebuchadnezzar was only concerned with his feet with him and where he was at but God showed him all the way down and showed him the last natural government would be wrong right amen but then he showed him the mingling of the toes and the clay and the iron and the different thing as something else coming into being right right and it would go from a natural governmental form to more of a spiritual form all right now Nebuchadnezzar had his dream let's go to the next one because Daniel had a dream in the first year about Shazer king of Babylon Daniel had a dream not about the Shader because that's that's who Daniel now Belle shades are I guess is what do you pronounced king of battling Daniel had a dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the sum of the matters I hear Daniel and let's see if if Daniel's dream Vision was the same as Nebuchadnezzar but yet adding more to the story you have spoken said I saw in my vision by night no wondering and behold the Four Winds of the heavens drove upon the Great Sea I want you and four great Beast came up from this from the diverse one from another what was it first over there verse 4 says the first was like a line and that Eagle's Wings I be held till the wings are ever put and it was lifted up from the Earth and made stand up on the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it now you were only dealing while ago with a natural government showing Nebuchadnezzar Daniel's automatically starting off to a man right yep in a man's heart given what do you do when you give an amount of heart when you get a man who desires of his Hearts you give him the desires that he has right or what he's thinking about and he said never that never can answer you're a great man back up forward right and you're a great nation and said what you're doing is natural things now Daniel is going to jump over and see a little more to the story because he's going to deal with a man's heart first was like a line that was never knead right what's the next one and behold another Beast a second life to a like to a bear and it raised up itself on one side and it had three ribs in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arrives Divine much flesh if Daniel is picking up something that's going to help us to understand how Pagan Rome becomes powerful wrong because now Daniel is dealing with a man's heart and his ideas and talks instead of it being just Nebuchadnezzar is coming down to where we are right number two is to be to be Persia instead of it just being a natural government what is it me rise into our flesh More's added to Daniel's dream than it was Nebuchadnezzar watch number verse six I had like a leopard you remember old Revelation it Revelations um verse 2 13 verse 2 it speaks of a leopard but it's Greece under Alexander which was a natural girl but what after this I'll be held in below another like a leopard Which hat which had up on the back of it for wings of a fowl the Beast had also four heads and Dominion was given to it he's coming on down watch it unfold little this will go along right wrong exceedingly it had great iron teeth it divide and break in pieces and stamped the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 horns right where does it come to in the Book of Daniel I mean the Book of Revelation seven heads ten horns all right so what do they see look at number three what's the quarter number three excuse me I got it up I didn't want to read all of this but we can go ahead go ahead just leave it up we read the whole thing this is I got 123 124 I think it goes to 125 of the marketplace I read some of this the other day foreign chapter now to begin with and if you notice on down in the chapter here said I looked and lo a lamb stood upon Mount Shania Lord I beg your pardon me I'm in the wrong verse wrong chapter 14 30. all right and I stood upon the Sands of the sea and saw a beast coming out of the sea having seven horns heads and ten horns and up on the orange tin crowns and upon his head it's the name of black seeds what is blasphemy you remember had this the other day it used to make fun of ridicule talk about and watch he had seven heads ten horns and when he come up out of the sea now Revelation 17 you knew that's putting it down 1715 said that that the waters represent thickness and multitudes of people so it's me's represented power ungodly power be still pray raised up out of the people in other words where it's coming and he stood upon the sand of the sea and I saw the Beast and the Beast which I saw was like a leopard now he's in Chapter 13 right and his feet where's the feet of a Byron his mouth on the line and the dragon gave him his power and seen in great authority to drive him and we got two things under consideration now watch this Beast it had four different characters in it if you'll take Daniel 7 you are marking it down Daniel 7 Daniel Shaw which is where we just went with the down your stream right Daniel saw the same vision 800 years before this child division he saw those bees separating one from the other in the beginning of the Gentile ruling taught now Daniel 2. and Daniel 7 is just more of Daniel sure anymore watch Revelation 13. showing you more right you understand me right right more is being unfolded it's coming down now to whether it's getting into our day to over we can see it Revelation 13 3. and I saw one of his heads as it were wounded to death and his deadly wound was healed and the world wondered after the Beast he had a deadly wound in the head one of the others brought around gives it one of the other writers like Mafia one third of them said he he was throat was cut he was bleeding mortally you know what you see what I'm talking about now you something about it was wounded to the death right but it don't die all right because it was healed now what happened there it was mortally wounded number five which is a permanent your cage I paid 194 of the church's book that's wrong Haven Imperial Rome was no longer iron Pagan Imperial Rome ended of who was the king there was that finally ended the Roman the government but he held after Calvary coming on that wrong could not now rule he's talking about the wrong Nation it was all over so thought the world right but how wrong the world was for that head wrong the wounded the wounded was not wounded unto death that's right see the world thought wrong ended but it did go on to the next from the parent the church age book her anything that's the word now we know that the wounded hand was the Pagan Rome in the Roman Empire that great political world power this head rose again as done Roman Catholic spiritual Empire the Pagan Rome becomes powerful Rome now what's the difference between the two Pagan Rome becomes powerful now it's reading these things I didn't bring if you want them I can get a brother random was emphasizing it like this he was talking about how that that the only difference was that they they stopped being a natural government right you know to rule and now it's ruling the World by a spiritual Beast the Roman Catholic Church Pagan Rome went down it turned into spiritual realm there's your Pagan Rome being destroyed your paparom coming forth there's your wound that was unto death but it didn't kill it it just moved it from a natural to a spiritual wasn't it now watch this carefully what did political Pagan Rome do that was the basis of her success natural wrong now what did natural wrong do it was the basis of her success she divided and conquered go back and show you history that was the Sea of Rome divide and conquer her iron teeth core and divide whom she tore and divide could not rise again as when she did destroyed Carthage there ain't pronounce it word and showed her to assault the same iron seed remained it remained in her when she arose as the false Church and her policy was has remained the same dividing company that is the nicolaitanism and God hates it amen Pagan Rome identical same thing as paper roll Pagan Rome had a one-man ruler right Caesar whatever his name was whatever which one you put her starting out never one head over all in the world what's the Catholic Church guy that's right that's right amen I'll try it and we'll get to it a little bit later on as we get along into the 13th chapter we ought to well remember how that over in what was it oh man goodness we're talking about the other night uh what was the country the pope come from yeah but there's some Germany what was the one before Poland okay Poland you remember what happened there the Catholic Church which you know who told him to go do it they went out protested and the military would not fire on them you remember that you ought to remember that by just an actual dude and then you laugh you'll remember reading about it that was where that it took over and brought forth their freedom well Russia because the military refused to fire almost one sure that was their people sure but who was given the orders for them to even March out there I thought that Pope come from Poland didn't one of them do you see who can make war against this man I'm just giving you natural things that happened in our day right we'll get into the image of the Beast to show you know that we've got the military power David as I said the other day religious control and power right same thing we saw to him wounded unto death all right pull up the next one where are we at let's see what time we got number seven why we are not our denomination 58 9 27. get an idea of the the date the brother brought my attention the other day I don't see under this uh system we use because we have to use it to be able to hook up the internet system it's the number 10 on the uh the new system see it doesn't give the the place where it's priest now uh the um 95 version will give you the place where it's preached at and a lot of this in this one will give you the place where it's freestyle but not all totally all right so I try to give the date so you can go to the date of it because like say the token it streaks four different times 63 and it's over in the 64 the last time in the springs well if you don't win lunch better build one of them Jeffersonville please people don't know which one if you go to the dates of it 69. now watch listen to this just a minute five Kings which was Fallen five Kings if you want to know from the history I'll show it to you and one is and wants to come yep now watch him now watch the Beast now the Beast wasn't a king he was one which is which is not and yet he is and if not you remember that in the scripture yeah yet he is and he has not what is it six section of popes right so he's giving you a power of these ruling that's when Pagan Rome was converted to make purple Rome Pagan Rome was converted and then it become the papacy which they had a pope and instead of a king and the pope is the spiritual King right that's the reason he's a crowned spiritual King claims to be the backer of Jesus Christ the Catholic church had the king yeah the world today has a king I don't even know what his name is that's how much I keep up with things I keep up with what wrote around said about me but he's not here to tell me what this guy's name is so I can't even remember it a lot of times I hope this and Pope down or whatever it's a succession of popes he's the king and one of them lived three months wouldn't it in one month with a one month one of the pokes that was crowned yeah 30 days 30 days yeah with no more they must not like you that's right I just got a natural today okay no problem I don't care anyway I don't mean that wrong brother die and I don't care what happened because it has nothing to do with me as long as I'm on this side of it of the understanding right but look at the next one piece of the trumpets 1964 719 the morning service program 163. there is that Roman Empire Bound by their what the ecclesiastical power which Rome Pagan Rome became powerful Rome and was bound there in his traditions of Christians now watch now you see why it becomes iron and Clay the mingling and the different things the iron was the leftover from the king the clay is coming over into religious matters come on that's right it was bound there and traditions of Christians what part of Christian and the superstitions it had of Rome putting together all these worship of women what did Rome do to natural and all these other kind of stuff and Christmas days and holidays and holy days and things it's been bound with that tradition that it cannot let loose because it's against Christian principles still the same ungodly Pagan spirit and that Spirit caught into the nations of the world according to the Prophecies of Ezekiel and the rest of them look around the world today who done away with Communism it was on the the which one of them live magazine or which one Times magazine the front of it I had Reagan and the Pope that they got together and done away with Communism right yep now that's what they printed the poll vocated for us to push the arms race and they claimed we had all kind of Supernatural almost weapons well Russia was just spending millions of dollars to try to catch up with us and we didn't even have it right right it was just fake stuff but they done it to bus wrong now what if they'd have demanded the payment today they that wrong almost Russia what if Russia what if the day Russia was demanded to pay what if they demanded our payment and how much bigger is our national debt today than it was in the 60s foreign I remember back when we was in school of what they call national debt and they figured out every person owed about ten thousand dollars but boy that would be sure different today wouldn't it that's right what is the national debt today how many trillion yes 16 trillion or something what you see is the breaking our nation yep you don't ever read or remember you know that when they started Social Security there was enough money put in the fund that never one dollar would ever have to be added to the Social Security fund right that's how much money they put aside now there's three people working and four people drawing or something like that I don't know the exact number but that's right but see you would have never had to pay to any Social Security because it was to be set up for retirees right now it's anybody ease right right anybody go out and have a couple of babies they go down and apply and I didn't mean that language like that to imply any race I mean it to imply the race of Americans the degrading situation we're all in we voted our own rights away for Denton but now listen you remember let's see him get number nine world number eight go ahead and read number nine then we'll drop back this review just a second quick all right page 192 . Not only was State and church wedded in this age but the Babylonian religion was officially joined to the first church the Babylonian religion that's why it's called missionary Babylon when we're in about 17th chapter somewhere in there mystery Babylon you know the Catholic Church admits they're that woman I say Amen well look Not only was church and state waited at this age what part of me and what is it one two three the Third Church age by the third church I think it meant thoroughly married and one of them did but the Babylonian religion was officially joined to the church now think about it Roman religion Satan now had access Now read what that prophet's saying Satan now had access to the name of Christ and he was enthroned as God In Worship right yep it's really hit me the other day when I read it verse maybe he had access to the name of Christ he claims he's the biker one who speaks for Christ or instead of Christ so we've got the name of Christ right with the help of Federal Aid the churches fell out to beautiful buildings which were lined with orders of white marble and images of The Departed Saints now did they take it and sweep it out and do new now and right at this age is where the Beast of Revelation 13 3 that was wounded to death the Pagan Rome Empire came back to life and Powers as a Holy Roman Empire Rome as a material Nation had suffered much depletion and soon would suffer it completely but it mattered not now for her religious Empire would keep her own top of the world government from the inside where she would not where she would not appear to be so from the outside become very religious right become until John on Patmos that's right I admired it that's right you remember that John admired this woman amen the world has fallen at her feet yep same old Roman government that used to rule by the fist of iron and Conquer Nations until it took over the world let's see what was it releasing yesterday what brought around and said that which wanted one that died he taught his mother because there's a single tree and running through the city and and burned Rome and blinded them Nero Waterloo was where who was it Napoleon found his end those governments finally come to an end but the same old Doctrine they had appeared in the Christianity when who was it gave the Christians Constantine gave the Christians and is never a record he would ever convert or anything he gave the churches to the people big old buildings they had but they didn't take down this and do put up a even an image of Christ right they probably move things around for a little while until they got used to it but then after a while they begin to worship ancestors and things right until you get into the doctrines and ideas of mankind and you know there's a denomination now that baptizes unto the Dead you know if you're a member of their group and you died Alone brother or somebody can come along and be baptized in your place and that's post a movie I reckon out of purgatory yeah see Pagan Rome become powerful wrong now rules the world how much longer we're going to have religious freedom to be able to even speak that I don't know right it can close out at any time why because it's getting drastically bad yeah I'm not looking for it and hoping it'll come I'm just saying we're here and I'm glad of it right man maybe that's a carnal way of making it express me right you know what I think it's about time for all of it to come to an end amen coaches I said Daniel Saul Nebuchadnezzar saw not just the end of Rome as a national government one just added a little more to it if you followed what I said John in the Book of Revelations adds a little more to the story brings it down more that you can understand right and iron Daniel he tells that King he said one of these days there's going to be a group of people that's going to raise up and they're going to be the one that was destroyed an image to the Beast well we're not going out if I literally I hope you understand right man what does it mean just a second what does it mean to destroy the image or hit the image in the feet in a different thing what is it mean in Simplicity to you Stone cut out of the mountain without Stone what does that mean I thought we believe the stone was a revealed word well now if you think that we're supposed to go out and every person you talk to who was supposed to slap their feet with a Doctrine you sure have missed the whole concept of anything what do you try to destroy in the other person's Doctrine I remember a certain brother here one time I didn't talk to him about it and try to get him to get out of any kind of a group I just told in the Bible and I've done it over years I didn't do this one time he come to me one day and he said brother they lied to me he said they lied to me he said to settlement from Adam Is Not Duplicate that's right that's right but see he's so understand amen I didn't have to tell me right Brothers don't I didn't tell them to get her out of those things the truth told him to what to do right looks like I told a man one day I said if you've got something that could make me a Christian matter and you won't tell me there's something wrong with you that's right I said cause I'm doing my best to try to tell you how to be a Christian and live better and be a better person if you think you've got some kind of secret code you keep from me that I couldn't be a better person then you're wrong but you see where we're at church we're in the finish of all things I believe this message when it came there in 63 I believe that was the descendant of God Amen that's right now not the man I didn't say that I said the message was the descendant of God oh that's what your Prophet said it would be amen for the message and that would be the coming of the stone of Daniel that will hit the image in the feet and destroy that image and that's you and me with this message not just brother Brown because it didn't destroy everything when brother Brown came that's right it's for you and I not to go out and argue with the world and fuss with them see that's where the problem is you get people to come into message you're just about like it was in the days of Martin Luther you know when they begin to see Martin Luther were talking about to adjust shall live by faith they thought he meant for them to do it and they went out and burned the churches because they thought that's what Luther was saying no one that run around and said it was hard for him to keep his head above all the fanaticism that went around his message you just ain't going by and seeing a beautiful building on finding people saying Luther we've done what you told us did we set that building on fire he said that ain't the one I'm talking about and what I'm talking about is standing looking at demon power that has been building you it's not an image of rolling down through and bumping all of these things out of the way like a rolling bowling ball going down to a an alley it's our ideas right that's right our thoughts that are contrary to the truth you know like I said it started a while ago you can't get rid of them until they're revealed to being all right that's right yep because you're not gonna try to get rid of them that's right you're happy what you are I'm going to church we got a good group we're happy we're in the message yeah what is the message is going to roll down through Babylon amen all right yep but you know who used to sing it and I'm not throwing off on them Pentecost that was a Pentecostal song rolling down to Babylon and it wound up right in the same Doctrine Amen to the Catholic Church and they would fight you over that to tell you that was not right but what is their Doctrine isn't it odd you come into this message and the arguments is over the godhead but not on we've only got one message telling us about the godhead and people are arguing over the godhead of what to Target and I see it wrong that's it amen and remember nashia Rome was called by Constantine the person I see in Council was set in motion by Constantine they're trying to get to church together that's right where they would agree with one another what is it today oh those are good people Brother David you shouldn't be thrown off on those Brothers in the message that's their way of seeing it and you see it different uh compound Revelation compound meaning don't mean you can see something you can three seek three gods and I can see one right that's not compound Revelation remember what I preached the other day that's right that's right that's right compound Revelation is what I've been talking about tonight how did that all Roman government got quote drowned and destroyed yeah but then its ideas okay just come over you remember Israel come on you remember Israel we want a king Daniel said what's the matter I'm you huh God your king and anything you need we get it but I want a king I want to be like the rest of them really kind of odd in this message that they're joking for position to find out who's in command or who's supposed to lead us today you're not hearing too much of that because you're not they're not going to publicly put it out which is Brother Ray and going back maybe he can back up far enough but I remember in the life of the 60s when they were talking about who was supposed to lead the bride I thought they were talking about who's the Elijah to take over after brother Ryan was gone well this one isn't it this one isn't it this isn't it jockeying for position what are we doing Mustang can you see how Pagan roamed he just went over to call them Roman Catholic Church that's assigned Doctrine that's it worshiping of many gods was the Pagan Rome they had many gods they had buildings and to the Gods What About Us what have we got 152. 152 152 I care not today all along don't worry anybody having a baby shelter okay kingdom is going to come Jesus woke up in my kingdom is not nothing to provide on Earth turkey then he turned around he called and kings and stone rolling down through their attention to see this message let's run around wrote this message all they really warned him in his early ministry right now Jesus wasn't it they wanted that big profit beat him the size of the wonders in the Pentecostal Realm s it's a message whether you believe it or not this message is that headstone your daughter I don't have no doctors with god well revealing to you you got him first heard of them actually the first person to start talking to you about water but that's God I got suspended he said right here Stone supposed to roll down through our heads bye-bye foreign back home foreign the rest of the week you remember brother Bob speech and you know we can get all tied up in our own ideas and talks to what we think about something is but like I told him I said brother Bob I believe and I do I believe I believe every Minister has ever called of God has a special scriptural adult whatever you want to call it revelation is specifically for them your brain that's right and though I may preach on it many times that it will not do the effects that is supposed to be it's like a song A lot of times you know who was it Jimmy Davis sung the come home come home is that the one it wasn't the one that met the great speckleberg that was his song right there's nobody could ever sing it like that you know we'll see that was for them to bring that was the anointing the thing and run around said God may choose you to preach for 40 years for one 30-minute service well I'm just only still trying to find a 30-minute sermon that's right now to keep on preaching I find that one but there's always something for somebody to bring or they wouldn't be called a preacher and we need these young ones coming up we need them because us older ones is you know moving off I I still want to make a change what does it matter to me if I'm standing there that day and the young man and holding up my hands like they did Moses yeah all right the two young ones one on each side now holler and praise the lord we hear yeah father we thank you and we just ask you to be with us as we're going our way home Lord be a misunderstanding of you may we see the day that we're living the hour the time of where we're at right now we're down here at the end of all things and truly you will come on the scene because you promised it blessing God each one on the way home give everybody a safe journey and as we prayed be with brother Bob died announcing this call to the ministry we pray that you blessing and giving understanding that we may feed from that because we believe you Lord we love you and we thank you in Jesus name amen amen you dismissed it's definitely thank you
