[13:54] that just read it as you go out and you
[13:57] know you don't have to go do do a lot of
[13:59] shopping cuz you can just go get a card
[14:00] from Walmart or Target orever what it is
[14:03] and everything then when when Mary and
[14:06] in the future gets out there they can
[14:09] buy what you want to so that's you know
[14:12] that's the easiest way to handle
[14:13] anything all right Genesis
[14:19] 1 oh two we will be having a fall
[14:22] festival uh you know like we did last
[14:25] year so whenever we can get that planed
[14:27] to where it it can be we'll be on having
[14:31] the chicken house on Saturday and we
[14:32] talked about it yesterday Danny maybe we
[14:35] can we got enough fish I think or if we
[14:38] don't we'll we'll U buy some right but
[14:41] you know we'll probably that we that
[14:43] thing how the fish fry along with the
[14:46] Fall Festival you know out in the
[14:48] evening and that would work out to be
[14:50] all together a good time and and you can
[14:53] you know eat the fish and enjoy it so
[14:55] that'll be a good time so remember these
[14:57] amen
[14:59] father we thank you we love you and we
[15:01] ask you that just bless each and every
[15:02] one of us with your presence you said
[15:05] you sent your word and healed us so we
[15:07] believe it we just depend upon you we
[15:11] put our dependence not upon anything
[15:12] else but we depend upon solely what you
[15:14] have to say we confess your word by your
[15:17] stripes we are healed and we walk
[15:20] forward Lord we ask you to just dismiss
[15:23] from us anything that would be a
[15:24] hindrance whatsoever and just let your
[15:28] light shine in our hearts and lives
[15:30] forgive our sins because we want to
[15:32] stand complete in you and just lead us
[15:35] and let your light shine in Jesus name
[15:40] amen Genesis
[15:45] 1 and remember we've been bu in heaven
[15:48] now
[15:49] for quite a while all right so we coming
[15:53] down all right so we're on the
[15:55] horizontal rainbow you know the old
[15:57] brother preached and coming down to the
[15:59] Earth we still got a little bit this
[16:00] morning to jump back up but we've got to
[16:03] we're coming down to into life upon the
[16:07] Earth in what we're trying to study okay
[16:10] so in the beginning God created the
[16:13] Heaven and the
[16:14] Earth and the Earth was without form and
[16:17] void and darkness was upon the face of
[16:19] the deep and the spirit of God moved
[16:22] upon the face of the waters and God said
[16:25] let there be light and there was light
[16:28] and God saw the light that it was good
[16:32] and God divided the light from the
[16:34] darkness and God called a light day and
[16:38] the Darkness he called night and the
[16:40] evening and the morning were the first
[16:42] day all right now while we're at it jump
[16:45] over to verse 16 and you'll find that it
[16:49] was two lights made amen the Sun and the
[16:53] Moon all right and God made two great
[16:57] lights the greater light to Rule the Day
[16:59] and the Lesser light to rule the night
[17:02] and he made the Stars also so you may be
[17:04] seated the Lord had his Blessing to the
[17:07] reading of the
[17:09] word now I would love to I done this one
[17:14] time years ago but we don't have the
[17:17] time now to do it but I'd love to take
[17:19] each day and the creation and the the
[17:23] things and you know and emphasize on it
[17:26] and uh you know be able ble to
[17:30] uh to talk a little bit about it because
[17:33] I believe that what God done is through
[17:36] his
[17:37] creation he was revealing himself right
[17:41] amen putting himself down
[17:44] into words first which would be creation
[17:49] and we'll talk about it in a minute
[17:50] where the Prophet said that he made the
[17:53] stars and things he was writing his
[17:54] first Bible right and he was doing those
[17:57] things and and as he was doing it then
[18:02] it's it's wonderful to look at each day
[18:04] and see but the main thing I want you to
[18:08] remember is that to tie back into the
[18:11] previous
[18:13] services that remember brother R said
[18:16] the first thing God created was angels
[18:18] and they worshiped him all right then we
[18:21] know that the world was
[18:23] formed cuz we read there in Genesis 1
[18:27] and uh you know and it was with it was
[18:30] without form and void darkness and Etc
[18:34] and that's the reason I like it because
[18:36] if you notice the reading of the
[18:38] Scriptures it really in the
[18:41] Bible I don't mean this the Lord knows
[18:43] it but it looks like God does everything
[18:47] backwards you know because it's just the
[18:49] way he does it and you know over in
[18:52] there where Jacob laid down and he was
[18:55] dreaming a dream it says the Angels were
[18:57] ascending
[18:59] and
[19:00] descending well it looked like they
[19:02] ought have been you know
[19:04] descending and ascending but no see
[19:09] right they was down there with him amen
[19:12] all right and they were taking up his
[19:13] prayers and bring it back down the
[19:15] rewards you know so then God the way he
[19:18] does things is really odd but uh I'm
[19:21] glad to have little back back her with
[19:23] us today and she got her a
[19:27] job
[19:30] she can mail us an onion a piece from
[19:34] V but you know I'm glad of that glad she
[19:37] got her job Amen Let me see it but see
[19:41] then we read here in Genesis and it says
[19:44] like the first
[19:46] day and and it says the evening and the
[19:49] morning right right was the first
[19:52] day then the next one is the creation
[19:55] and they say the evening and the morning
[19:57] mhm
[19:59] well that's kind of backward the way we
[20:00] look at things right know we look at
[20:03] things is the morning you know and the
[20:06] evening but it's kind of odd the way God
[20:09] does it but how beautiful it is because
[20:12] if the world was without form and
[20:15] void and then he starts to do something
[20:19] then that would be the evening the
[20:21] darkness you know the evening time as we
[20:23] would be looking at it and and I like
[20:26] that because it comes all the way over
[20:28] to where we're at and uh in the evening
[20:32] time it shall be
[20:35] light then in the morning you'll be a
[20:38] resurrection right all right so I like
[20:40] it that way but just you know you keep
[20:43] those things in mind as we go along
[20:45] that's why I'd like to just preach on
[20:47] each thing but you know we want to get
[20:50] into something this morning that we were
[20:53] looking at as I said the prophet said
[20:56] the first thing that was made was Angel
[20:59] and then he begin to
[21:01] create and to bring into being like the
[21:03] world and he said then there it says in
[21:07] the beginning God created the heavens
[21:09] and the Earth period he said then he
[21:11] could have let it lay for billions of
[21:13] billions of trillions of years before he
[21:15] ever done anything see because that's
[21:18] not the first day right
[21:21] right the Earth was created in things
[21:25] because that wasn't the first day you
[21:26] see you got to divide if you read your
[21:28] scripture that you'll see that it comes
[21:30] over in the face of the deep the
[21:33] different things God was moving upon it
[21:35] and then he said let there be
[21:38] light and there was light right now
[21:41] you're getting to the first day cuz see
[21:44] if you tie it too close together then
[21:46] you'll cross up what brother randam is
[21:47] saying when he would say that see it
[21:50] says in the beginning God created heaven
[21:52] and earth
[21:54] period he that's where science don't
[21:57] understand and and even if you try to
[21:59] tie those things together you're going
[22:01] to bring it in to a
[22:05] day but just remember your start your
[22:08] days which we know and we can go in you
[22:10] know that the day is a th years 1 th
[22:12] years is a day with the Lord but still
[22:14] get the point that the world was there
[22:17] every this thing was doing was going on
[22:20] in what we would call the
[22:23] universe and as it was then he would
[22:26] start to
[22:29] create so that's what we're going to
[22:30] talk about for probably this morning
[22:32] this afternoon is the
[22:35] creation all right and in doing
[22:38] that brother random
[22:41] never denied some of what science has to
[22:44] say right he accepted it because they
[22:47] could prove it you know in in everything
[22:51] and I wish said a couple of messages if
[22:53] you want to more or less follow along
[22:55] what I'm
[22:56] saying about it get the message of uh
[23:00] cruelty of sin preached in
[23:04] 1953 uh
[23:06] 403 and and listen to that message and
[23:09] then go over to uh 1953
[23:13] 729 which would be like questions and
[23:15] answers on Genesis all right then you'll
[23:18] hear what is being said okay and in
[23:22] doing that see I didn't choose to bring
[23:24] those things but I just chose to to uh
[23:29] mention them to
[23:30] you and then we will get to a point in
[23:33] just a
[23:36] moment
[23:38] but see science says there was a Big
[23:40] Bang
[23:42] Theory science says that it was and I
[23:45] don't understand how they got to gas
[23:46] this together cuz I'm not a scientist
[23:48] I'm not to do it but they say that it
[23:51] was just like a massive like the sun was
[23:53] just a great
[23:56] thing and the then all at once you had
[23:59] explosions etc etc and from there came
[24:03] the planets and the stars and I never
[24:06] could understand what a planet meant and
[24:08] what a star meant you know one's
[24:10] supposed to be one thing one's supposed
[24:12] to be another one uh one them supposed
[24:14] to have the capability of Life the other
[24:16] one's not supposed to be I remember all
[24:18] that from school but I I I'm not
[24:20] concerned to whether you call them stars
[24:22] or planets or we look out we see the
[24:24] stars falling we see and we say look at
[24:27] the stars well it's impossible because
[24:29] Stars don't fall if they fail it would
[24:31] mess up the whole universe but still the
[24:35] point of what I'm want you to see is
[24:37] that science says there's a big bang
[24:39] theory that it was all gases and then it
[24:41] begin to just out and you know and start
[24:46] uh doing things and and all of this
[24:48] universe that we're living in that it's
[24:51] a massive uh Universe of things and uh
[24:56] as it would go out then the stars begin
[24:59] to develop the the different things but
[25:02] now I want you to
[25:03] remember one thing and brother random
[25:07] doesn't deny science he brings it to a
[25:10] point of understanding science that's
[25:12] right amen because you see we have in
[25:15] our solar system of where we are and I'm
[25:19] not a scientist I'm just making this
[25:20] point to get you to see what God how
[25:22] marvelous he can make things all right
[25:25] in our solar system as we call it
[25:28] like where we are see we have a sun of
[25:30] our own right we have a moon of our own
[25:34] well many many planets out there have
[25:38] some of them have many
[25:41] moons you know some of those planets I
[25:43] mean they can prove that they've got
[25:44] Suns of their own they got Moon of star
[25:47] you know things that in their atmosphere
[25:50] or in their uh Universe would be a way
[25:54] of saying it which means it's in a a
[25:56] form but now remember the messages
[25:59] behind
[26:01] this that we tried to
[26:04] bring that we live in in
[26:07] a in a thing that we call a dimension
[26:11] right and remember a dimension is a uh
[26:15] an area as
[26:17] defined maybe large small whatever this
[26:20] building is talked about is like a a
[26:23] dimension a cubicle or whatever you want
[26:25] to make it but just think about it
[26:28] because I didn't have time and all the
[26:30] others to bring see that all of this
[26:32] universe that's going out and all these
[26:34] stars and moons and and planets and
[26:38] whatever you want to call them that they
[26:40] can look out there hundreds of billions
[26:42] of billions of billions of light years
[26:44] and find more planets amen just remember
[26:48] the one thing that I tried to
[26:51] bring that we live in Dimensions we live
[26:55] in a fact of light life and matter
[26:57] whatever you want to say time then
[27:01] there's a fourth fifth sixth seventh
[27:03] Dimension all right now so then if we
[27:07] are in an atmosphere of Worlds out
[27:11] that's still a
[27:13] dimension no matter how big it is right
[27:16] no matter how vast it is it's a
[27:19] dimension and remember Heaven is not a
[27:23] dimension that's right you remember that
[27:27] right I told told you these will be
[27:28] imported as we go along Heaven is not a
[27:31] dimension because you can't put a you
[27:33] can't calculate it there's no way to put
[27:36] it into a cubicle right you can't make
[27:39] it into a square round or whatever it is
[27:42] so just keep that in mind that that's
[27:45] why science can't find those things cuz
[27:47] they can only see in the dimensions that
[27:49] we're living in Connected To Life Light
[27:52] matter from here and they can see all
[27:54] this vast
[27:56] universe that's out out there but they
[27:58] can't find Heaven you remember the
[28:01] Russian went up came back and said went
[28:03] all the way up to the moon and back but
[28:05] said found no God found no Heaven found
[28:08] nothing like that we see because we're
[28:10] Limited in a
[28:11] dimension right amen so think about the
[28:14] the worlds and all the planets now with
[28:17] me for just a minute is that still a
[28:19] dimension right no matter how vast it
[28:22] would be no matter how far it could go
[28:26] and they say that it's still even going
[28:28] and and and that we're actually moving
[28:30] right that we're not standing still but
[28:33] we're going to drop back to the Bible
[28:35] one day about it and see
[28:37] that why that heaven comes to you know
[28:40] why the future home comes down on this
[28:41] earth right because I believe this is
[28:44] the only one that has life amen you can
[28:47] believe other planets have life you do
[28:49] what you want to but I don't believe in
[28:50] it amen I don't believe in
[28:52] extraterrestrial being we got enough
[28:55] monkeys down here that's right we got
[28:57] enough problems on this Earth why don't
[28:59] we worry about something up in there
[29:00] right you know well one of these days
[29:02] one of them drop down pick you up
[29:03] brother D you'll change your mind well I
[29:05] say hey buddy where'd you come from New
[29:07] York we was over in Israel and uh this
[29:10] fell was supposed to make a speech and I
[29:14] mean he got up there there going to tell
[29:15] us something we fixing to
[29:17] do why he was as North Carolina
[29:20] hillbilly as you ever heard in your life
[29:22] and he was a Jew I said where in the
[29:26] world you live he said North Carolina I
[29:28] said no wonder you know know if they
[29:31] pick me up I say Hey Joe where you from
[29:33] you know what's going on there but you
[29:36] know I ain't worried about it I'm
[29:38] concerned about this planet because I've
[29:39] always told you the Bible says Eve is
[29:42] the mother of all living so that solves
[29:44] it for me all right well you're just too
[29:46] stubborn well that's all right maybe I
[29:48] am but you know God loves stubborn
[29:50] people sometimes but now get on back to
[29:53] what we're talking
[29:54] about all of this universe no matter how
[29:57] bask it could be it's a dimension right
[30:00] sure see and and if it was possible and
[30:04] and if we stayed around here another 50
[30:06] years you would see interplanetary
[30:09] travels you would see going from here to
[30:13] Venus or Mars or something and you know
[30:15] they just learn back because you know of
[30:20] the great advancement of science right
[30:22] and all like that but still remember
[30:24] you'd be bound to a dimension right yeah
[30:28] you would be like the movie they made of
[30:30] Lost in Space where they couldn't get
[30:32] back you know and and the things you
[30:35] would be into those
[30:36] forms but
[30:38] yet you would still be limited right
[30:43] because science says you know Einstein
[30:45] said if you went out so far and went so
[30:47] fast you could go out and be gone 50
[30:49] years come back you wouldn't be a bit
[30:51] older well now he can convince you of
[30:53] that yeah but he can't convince me of
[30:56] that cuz I might not be no older on the
[31:02] clock how many have you ever been out on
[31:04] a
[31:05] boat and come back to
[31:08] land how many of you ever been in a
[31:10] plane and had jet lag right and problems
[31:14] oh yeah you got fun if you ain't never
[31:16] been out on a boat and been out there
[31:18] about 24 hours or 12 or 15 hours come
[31:21] back in and maybe 2 or 3 hours later you
[31:24] walk in around about that time you
[31:26] lag cuz everything starts just going
[31:29] like that you
[31:30] know not making light just talking but
[31:34] see remember now my point because that
[31:36] was what I was trying to get over
[31:39] there that no matter how far we could go
[31:42] out into
[31:43] space we could never reach heaven right
[31:48] right it's not another
[31:52] dimension it is so Superior to this
[31:56] dimension until there's no way to even
[31:59] hardly talk about that's right but you
[32:01] say well now you know that's still on
[32:03] with you that's right I still ain't
[32:04] through what I was talking about but the
[32:07] point I want you to get was that the
[32:10] while in
[32:12] heaven God created the Angels MH then he
[32:16] created a world you know an atmosphere
[32:19] life of
[32:20] doings so science where their big bang
[32:22] theories is not too far off and all like
[32:26] that
[32:27] but remember
[32:29] now see I'm saying that to where
[32:32] somebody hears it they would not life at
[32:34] us as idiots we're dumb enough as it is
[32:37] don't worry about it pray for us but
[32:40] brother randam knew of the other world
[32:42] having Moons and stars and things you
[32:45] can read science that can tell you but
[32:48] yet his dealings was right here because
[32:50] this is where God is going to come back
[32:53] to right is to this world this point
[32:57] doings right here all right so then as
[33:01] we talk about it just think about what
[33:05] your Prophet
[33:07] knew and yet science wouldn't accept
[33:11] what he had to say about it but you know
[33:14] just think on it now from the
[33:17] message while we are not a
[33:20] denomination I want I chose to read
[33:22] basically this whole thing so if uh
[33:27] you'll pull it
[33:28] up while we are not of denominations
[33:31] 1958 927 paragraph 240 so just look at
[33:36] it and listen to what your Prophet knew
[33:39] now as I said before we start
[33:42] reading all
[33:44] right before we start off our
[33:47] reading
[33:49] remember the point I just
[33:54] made he drops down dealing with just the
[33:58] existence in
[34:01] this uh what do you call
[34:03] it in our what was the word I used one
[34:06] ago in our world our system Galaxy our
[34:11] galaxy all
[34:12] right the all right in this he's dealing
[34:17] just with that he's not dealing a lot of
[34:20] times with the big
[34:22] point but you got to
[34:25] remember
[34:28] it evidently must have been a Big Bang
[34:31] Theory right there must have been the
[34:33] masses of gases and things because you
[34:36] hear him telling about God writing his
[34:39] his Bible all right now writing his
[34:42] Bible is the whole universe right now he
[34:46] drops back more or less to the Earthly
[34:48] form to bringing it into
[34:53] our place all right now I want I want to
[34:57] you to see that because you know that
[34:59] way you won't get tied up into the two
[35:02] so just remember there had to be as
[35:04] we'll we'll get to it the prophet said
[35:06] said the clinkers blew off said what's
[35:08] he
[35:09] doing on those two messages gave he said
[35:11] he's writing his Bible well that's all
[35:13] up in the atmosphere that's that's not
[35:15] just what's in
[35:17] our circular with our moon and our
[35:21] sun that's dealing on out all right but
[35:25] then he's dropping back
[35:27] because there's really no need of
[35:28] dealing out
[35:31] there it's dealing here cuz here's were
[35:36] and you can say what you want to this is
[35:38] the center of the universe right amen
[35:41] why is it the center of the universe
[35:42] Brother D because we know it's not the
[35:43] center position no it's the center of
[35:46] the universe because it's where God
[35:47] chose righten to bring into view what he
[35:51] wanted amen all right so that's why it's
[35:53] going to come back here all right now
[35:55] listen
[35:58] but when he was back Yonder before the
[35:59] foundation of the world before he took
[36:02] his old son and he moved it around this
[36:05] whole star that we're living
[36:08] on now this
[36:10] Earth he molded over here by the Sun and
[36:14] he laid it around the Sun saying here's
[36:17] the sun he molded it on this side and
[36:19] let her hang there for 100 billion years
[36:22] what was he making some gases he moved
[36:26] around on the de side he made something
[36:28] else what was he making
[36:31] there some potato some Poes he moved
[36:35] around this way what was he doing here
[36:37] making some calcium what was he doing he
[36:41] was making you and
[36:42] me amen now our bodies was in the Earth
[36:45] right amen now it didn't say our bodies
[36:47] was on the moon right get my point
[36:51] that's what my whole thing was to
[36:53] explain all the other he didn't say our
[36:54] bodies was on Mars
[36:58] Jupiter
[37:00] y our bodies were here on this Earth
[37:03] amen cuz this is the whole center of the
[37:06] universe when we get to it all right
[37:08] what's he
[37:10] doing he's making you and me what was he
[37:13] doing like the contractor laying all his
[37:15] two was making you and me what was he
[37:19] doing like the contractor laying out all
[37:21] of his 2x4s and and 2 by8 he he sheeting
[37:25] his sighing he know just how many
[37:28] buildings he was going to build y we're
[37:30] made out of 16 elements of the earth and
[37:32] he was making us all and laying us out
[37:34] there before the world ever come into
[37:38] now watch he didn't mean before it ever
[37:40] come into existence he's saying before
[37:42] it ever come into what he was going to
[37:43] use it for CU watch and it might have
[37:46] been oblong at that time I don't know
[37:48] what it was what was he making gold and
[37:51] copper and BR and water and all those
[37:55] stuff for he's a
[37:57] contractor he's he he's a builder he was
[38:00] laying everything out there had
[38:02] everything cut and fashion when he got
[38:04] it all made it was just a great big
[38:07] volcanic
[38:09] eruption see now that's where your
[38:11] Mountain Rangers come from and we'll get
[38:13] on to the other part in just a minute he
[38:16] let them old volcanoes brewed out there
[38:18] for 100 100 million years to make some
[38:21] calcium what is it it's part of you he's
[38:24] building your body so we'll get back to
[38:26] that later
[38:27] okay but
[38:30] now on the messages that I ask you to
[38:33] read cruy of sin or questions and
[38:36] answers you find brother randam saying
[38:38] he said it was just a mass of gases and
[38:41] said he let it sling off and said what's
[38:44] he doing said he's writing his Bible
[38:47] said clinkers went off then he narrows
[38:49] it down to the reason I using that he
[38:51] narrows it down to this earth to
[38:55] this do we're living in this world this
[38:58] system this Dimension or whatever you
[39:00] want to call it see atmospheres and
[39:03] things
[39:05] uh and brother BR said he let it hang
[39:08] out
[39:09] there y now he says here are the
[39:11] volcanic eruptions Etc all things got to
[39:14] do and it begin to form into uh you know
[39:19] materialistic things we call it all
[39:22] right but then he tells you on the other
[39:24] ones that God let it go out so far he
[39:28] said then he stopped it right and he
[39:31] said it was then going through and
[39:33] science can prove it that this world
[39:35] went through at one time a thing called
[39:37] an ice
[39:39] age and he said he let it hang out there
[39:42] so far said it went through a nice age I
[39:45] IED over everything you know because of
[39:47] what was doing and uh you know then the
[39:53] r said he pulled it in closer to the
[39:55] Sun and he said begin to let it thaw
[39:59] out and he said then that's what you see
[40:01] formed of Texas like I've always said I
[40:04] look down in the Grand Canyon and you're
[40:06] looking down like that and you're
[40:08] looking down like that and you keep
[40:10] looking down and you realize it's miles
[40:14] down
[40:15] there and they say that little Old River
[40:17] run down through there and washed it out
[40:20] I never could agree with that you know
[40:22] I'm just I'm
[40:24] sorry but you take the ice a
[40:27] and the
[40:28] things and as the prophet said you'll
[40:30] hear him talking about it said forming
[40:32] Texas and the things he said then as the
[40:34] water begin to recede out so then you
[40:38] see the Seas the things coming into view
[40:41] and you know water begins to accumulate
[40:44] in certain places because he moved it
[40:46] into a certain orbit and stood it up
[40:48] perfectly and and as it
[40:51] did see then you see all of these big
[40:54] valleys and things that's where I
[40:55] believe Grand can come from I believe
[40:58] one of those great big chunks of ice
[40:59] melted up in there somewhere and as it
[41:01] go down through Mel it's just cutting
[41:04] the ground up and doing things and all
[41:06] like that that's that's nothing I'm just
[41:07] trying to get a point of a natural and
[41:10] then we'll get to this to something
[41:12] else the prophet said then dry ground
[41:15] begins to
[41:17] appear and he says then from that dry
[41:21] ground begins to form the beautiful
[41:25] trees
[41:27] you know I mean you look around the
[41:29] world and you see before man got to hold
[41:32] up start cutting out everything right
[41:35] and you see beautiful places amen just
[41:38] marvelous places I like to get back into
[41:40] the woods you know back where that
[41:42] there's not been too many people you
[41:45] know but then you're sitting out there
[41:46] looking around and you find a beer can
[41:48] you find all kind of things you realize
[41:50] somebody done been there and messed it
[41:51] up right but you just think of what
[41:54] America looked like when we came
[41:56] here and the things and the beauty of
[41:59] this country and and all like that and
[42:02] see God planted those seeds in the earth
[42:04] you say were the prophet said it was
[42:06] from another civilization what not
[42:08] another one like the doctrine of another
[42:11] world before this world and there people
[42:13] before more people created than Adam and
[42:15] Eve I don't believe in that cuz the
[42:17] Bible would say Eve is the mother of all
[42:19] living solves that to me all right now
[42:22] I'm trying to get down to just a point
[42:24] of looking at something
[42:27] and it was a beautiful
[42:29] place yep beautiful
[42:32] situation he begins to
[42:35] create as I
[42:38] said in
[42:40] this place that we're living He creates
[42:42] a
[42:44] moon he creates
[42:48] sun he creates all the
[42:51] things he creates all of the beauty you
[42:53] read the Genesis coming down to there
[42:55] and he creat creates the
[42:58] animals and everything's
[43:02] beautiful but there was still something
[43:04] wrong with the scene that was there
[43:10] right because God had within him
[43:14] attributes and being a Creator would be
[43:16] part of it right y but he had attributes
[43:19] in him to be a father
[43:25] yep by that time the Angels had
[43:27] displayed the fact of
[43:30] being you know
[43:33] God but he wanted to be a Healer he
[43:35] wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a
[43:39] redeemer and he realized something would
[43:42] have to take place to bring that into
[43:45] being and by that time Satan had already
[43:48] begin to start developing all right now
[43:54] then you come down to
[43:57] the last thing that was
[43:59] created on the sixth day and it was
[44:03] man all right now to me that's why the
[44:09] prophet spent so much time emphasizing
[44:11] the difference between Genesis 126 and
[44:14] 27 and Genesis 2 amen because Genesis 2
[44:19] is the natural man that was created Adam
[44:22] upon the Earth right that was what was
[44:24] created on the sixth day right because
[44:28] the 126 man was not created on any day
[44:33] right amen that's
[44:36] right so we get over to 126 and 27 and
[44:41] we read and what does it
[44:44] say and God said let us make man in our
[44:47] in our image after our likeness and let
[44:51] them have dominion over the fish of the
[44:53] sea and over the foul of the air and
[44:55] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[44:57] and over every creeping thing that
[44:59] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[45:01] man in his own image in the image of God
[45:04] created he him male and female created
[45:07] he them all right
[45:10] now as I
[45:12] said the creation of man was on the
[45:16] sixth day that was the natural human
[45:20] Adam right the man the 16 elements was
[45:24] brought together and formed a body but
[45:27] this 126 and 27
[45:32] man what about
[45:35] him see I wasn't trying to show how
[45:37] smart I was with the Stars and whatever
[45:39] I was just trying to tie together the
[45:41] messages of what I previously preached
[45:43] down to this
[45:45] message
[45:47] because what kind of a man
[45:49] did God create amen and when did he
[45:52] create that man that he speaking of in
[45:54] 126 and 2 that's right we know when he
[45:58] created the natural man the sixth day
[46:02] right but when did he create this man
[46:05] and what kind of a man did he
[46:09] create so according to what we read here
[46:12] in the
[46:13] Bible that first he says let us make
[46:19] man brother brandom emphasizing that one
[46:22] day he says and I can give you these if
[46:24] you need them he said Father and
[46:28] Son MH oh we're trinitarians no we're
[46:32] not
[46:34] trinitarians he said Father and
[46:39] Son word and
[46:43] spirit right right the word is what
[46:46] created the world Jesus Christ created
[46:50] the world according to the Bible Hebrews
[46:52] 1 John 1 Colossians 1 James 3 and9 all
[46:55] things were created by Jesus
[46:58] Christ all right so who created the man
[47:01] of Genesis
[47:05] 2 Jesus Christ now not Jesus the flesh I
[47:09] have to say that because people run
[47:10] their minds in the wrong direction when
[47:12] I say Jesus Christ I am talking about
[47:15] almighty God Elohim self-existing word
[47:19] the offy whatever words you want logos
[47:22] speech whatever all of those words is
[47:24] talking about because I believe in one
[47:26] true and living God yes sir but I'm not
[47:28] a Oneness because I believe in a father
[47:31] Son and the Holy Ghost amen and this
[47:33] proves it here in Genesis not that it
[47:35] proves two personalities or person or
[47:38] identities it proves exactly what
[47:40] happened in the beginning that God
[47:43] stepped over into another form called
[47:45] the word Loos theop Son of
[47:49] God God in another form right stood
[47:53] there and begin to create all all right
[47:56] and as he begin to create see then it
[47:58] would be Father and Son in
[48:01] communication because the father would
[48:03] be totally in command that's where your
[48:06] people don't see what I'm talking about
[48:08] because you surely wouldn't want to
[48:10] believe that I'm a Oneness
[48:12] right right if you really seen what I
[48:14] try to bring because when I try to bring
[48:18] you know I don't bring all God was he
[48:20] poured into Christ and do away with
[48:23] God that's what they seem to do and I
[48:27] surely don't believe all Christ was he
[48:29] pours into the church and that does away
[48:30] with
[48:31] Christ I don't believe
[48:34] that I believe all God was he stepped
[48:37] over into another
[48:39] form and become the
[48:43] word the Christ right and then all
[48:47] Christ was Ste into another form called
[48:51] The Bride amen and that she's the final
[48:55] form form of God in this dispensational
[48:59] time the Jews get their dispensation but
[49:02] we're not concerned with them that's
[49:04] right all right see then that way we are
[49:06] the final form of God right well where
[49:10] would it be any trouble believing then
[49:12] that we would be made in the image of
[49:15] God
[49:16] Amen all right
[49:19] now here's the importance of the back
[49:22] messages
[49:23] see we studied and brought it out and
[49:26] emphasized over and over that God is
[49:29] real right amen that he's not like the
[49:32] wind the prophet said that's right he's
[49:35] a being he
[49:37] said he said he lives in a house anybody
[49:40] need these out there on the internet you
[49:42] just send us a note and we'll get them
[49:44] for you cuz Joe's got them right out
[49:46] there now where he can send them back to
[49:47] you probably before we get through with
[49:49] the service if you
[49:52] want God is a being the prophet said
[49:54] he's not like the wi that's right he
[49:56] said if he was like the wind you
[49:58] wouldn't have to seek the Holy Ghost
[49:59] because he would just be in
[50:03] everybody but he's a being he's a person
[50:06] he's real yeah now brother Dale God's a
[50:11] spirit what do you think a spirit
[50:17] is well it's just a spirit you know just
[50:20] just some nature some something you know
[50:26] has no form to it now where do you get
[50:28] that out of the Bible
[50:30] right I mean I want it in the Bible I
[50:33] want the prophet's message that's right
[50:35] where do you get that from you get that
[50:36] from Grandma's idea right that's it y of
[50:40] what Spirit meant cuz she's got scared
[50:42] one day cuz something went through the
[50:44] house she thought the wind blowed and
[50:46] blowed the curtain and she jumped up and
[50:52] down but you
[50:54] see
[50:56] in that other dimension we call
[51:01] Heaven can't you comprehend that God is
[51:04] real amen that's right then as he begin
[51:07] to condescend into this Dimension as we
[51:09] would call
[51:11] it was he losing the fact of being
[51:15] real and just becom an
[51:19] anointing a spirit that just
[51:23] floats around no form to it where did
[51:27] you get that from
[51:29] right well I just believe the Bible said
[51:33] God is a
[51:35] spirit that's true
[51:38] right but why don't you believe more of
[51:40] the Prophet what he be talking
[51:42] about he created a spiritual being right
[51:46] right which is US y well then God must
[51:49] have been spiritual being
[51:51] amen you see that's where I've spent all
[51:53] of my time trying to emphasize the
[51:57] importance of believing in the the uh
[52:01] reality of a living God and how real he
[52:06] is because as I just
[52:08] said if it was like the wind the prophet
[52:12] said then we wouldn't have to pray for
[52:14] the Holy Ghost it would just be in us
[52:20] right and then you would run ground when
[52:22] brother Ram would say that
[52:26] the
[52:28] person of Jesus
[52:30] Christ comes into you in the new
[52:35] birth right brother I thought it's just
[52:38] an anointing anointed ones are just
[52:41] anointed that's right they don't have
[52:44] the person of Jesus Christ in their soul
[52:46] they're just
[52:47] Anointed with what they
[52:50] believe a spirit y That's Right Good
[52:55] Feeling y the Holy Ghost ain't just a
[52:58] good feeling he is a wonderful feeling
[53:02] but he's
[53:03] real he's not just floating around
[53:06] imaginary thing that's what I tried to
[53:08] get you to see right all right Spirit
[53:12] man is not just a spirit it's real amen
[53:16] right what was God brother
[53:22] brandom so if we can see what God was we
[53:24] can see what this 126 and 27 man was
[53:28] right and find out how when he was
[53:30] created and how he came into
[53:34] being what is your god is your god real
[53:38] that's
[53:42] right now Jesus standing on Earth one
[53:45] day
[53:46] said I said show us the
[53:49] father yep he said have I been so long
[53:52] with you that's right don't you
[53:56] understand he said if you seen me you
[53:59] seen the
[54:01] father cuz God is real amen what Anna of
[54:06] God's real when she stood here Wednesday
[54:09] night had been sick for
[54:14] weeks go ask her if God is
[54:17] real and see that she was totally
[54:20] delivered
[54:24] amen well ask brother Stewart right over
[54:27] at brother pageant right been diagnosed
[54:30] with
[54:31] cancer treatments
[54:34] chemos radiums and everything the way he
[54:36] said
[54:37] it but he says God healed
[54:40] him I took him a prayer
[54:43] cloth I believe
[54:46] God when you P the prayer cloth around
[54:49] here that day for me you didn't know you
[54:53] passed
[54:54] two they because you just picked up
[54:56] Sister Gail had Jun them they picked up
[54:58] two well I made sure I kept
[55:02] one
[55:03] okay I ain't giving away all my
[55:07] blessings now I'll rub it on you brother
[55:09] colie maybe let you
[55:11] bar but you ain't going to
[55:13] give okay I got to thinking I thought
[55:17] there's two in
[55:19] there and I thought now what's going to
[55:21] happen with brother Stewart and that's
[55:22] what I told
[55:24] him I believe you're healed but I said
[55:26] the devil's going to try to come back
[55:28] now that's right he's going to fight you
[55:31] I said just
[55:33] remember there's more of us praying than
[55:35] you think right they gave him the prayer
[55:38] clock cuz you see I believe it amen I
[55:42] believe in God being real amen yes sir
[55:45] and doing what he said he would do amen
[55:47] right but brother Ram let's get on it
[55:51] brother Richard I just say brother Joe
[55:54] y'all get whose in the
[55:57] backroom let's look at
[55:59] Hebrews 4
[56:01] 1957 91 to evening service paragraph
[56:06] 229 you read all the others and
[56:12] everything but look what he
[56:16] says was God a man
[56:22] certainly no no brother Dale God is
[56:26] Spirit well now you just argue with the
[56:29] Bible and brother
[56:30] Brown in the
[56:32] Bible they saw things yep Moses
[56:37] saw the back part of a man right
[56:44] amen now that's according to the
[56:48] Bible
[56:50] now brother brandham said what he saw
[56:52] was a theophany MH
[56:57] man he said in that I'm quoting
[57:00] different places he said in that man
[57:03] became
[57:05] flesh you know what that man looked like
[57:07] I believe back there Moses the back part
[57:09] of Jesus all right look like
[57:13] that is your god that real that's
[57:18] right brother Dale you you just confuse
[57:21] us with all I thought I understood all
[57:23] about spirits God being a spirit and and
[57:27] I just feel his presence
[57:31] and I would to God one
[57:34] day he would just open your
[57:40] eyes I felt his
[57:43] presence I've been in those places I
[57:45] smelt his presence I've told you about
[57:48] it I've seen his presence I would to God
[57:52] that he'd open your eyes and let each
[57:54] each one of you view something just for
[57:56] a second right of how real
[58:01] is walking and just feeling
[58:06] something and just looking where are
[58:13] you cuz
[58:15] knowing that I'm not subject to lares
[58:18] and
[58:21] things but to be able to feel the
[58:23] presence of almighty God
[58:28] right i' still rather see him in the
[58:31] word
[58:32] revelation that's right cuz Satan can
[58:36] impersonate those feelings
[58:40] right he can get all involved with you
[58:43] and you think you see things
[58:46] right but the word's real all right was
[58:49] God a man certainly let us make man in
[58:51] our own image what was God a the off
[58:55] a
[58:57] body a
[58:58] body a man y I thought we believe the
[59:02] Bible Hebrews what is it
[59:05] 7 4 is that where it is where it talks
[59:08] about mzd and it says the man right
[59:12] right amen right you know that man sat
[59:15] down there and ate calf right ate meat
[59:18] drank milk bread
[59:21] right yep he was a man amen
[59:26] right look at
[59:29] it there was man and there man was made
[59:33] like that and put Over the
[59:37] Garden put Over the
[59:40] Garden you ain't got to the sixth day
[59:43] yet you understand what I'm saying right
[59:46] right you ain't got the natural man yet
[59:48] and I don't like that you know my
[59:50] English is no good ain't they did put it
[59:53] in the dictionary I'm capable of using
[59:55] it I used it a long time before they put
[59:57] it in the dictionary right maybe that's
[59:59] why they put it there maybe they heard
[1:00:01] me so much
[1:00:04] but and there man was made like
[1:00:08] that and put Over the Garden but there
[1:00:11] was no man to tell the sa you ain't got
[1:00:13] to gen you ain't got to the sixth day
[1:00:16] yet
[1:00:18] see in the senses he wasn't there he
[1:00:21] created man Out of the Dust of the Earth
[1:00:23] in the animal
[1:00:25] life and that man killed the soul and
[1:00:28] that man fell by transgression certainly
[1:00:31] or correctly and God the
[1:00:34] theop come down and was made flesh
[1:00:37] that's right and dwelt among us to
[1:00:39] redeem the man that's right so I believe
[1:00:42] God's real amen Jesus said unless you
[1:00:45] believe I am he you will die in your
[1:00:48] what sin what is sin
[1:00:52] disbelieving disbelieving what God says
[1:00:56] all
[1:00:57] right
[1:01:00] okay what was he made in look at the
[1:01:03] next
[1:01:04] one questions and answers on Hebrews 3
[1:01:09] paragraph 8
[1:01:11] 41 which is 1957
[1:01:15] 106 look what do we do my dear Saed
[1:01:19] brother my dear sainty sister before the
[1:01:21] foundation of the
[1:01:23] world
[1:01:25] when God created You In His
[1:01:30] Image are created The Man In His
[1:01:34] Image and created the woman in the image
[1:01:37] of the man for the glory of the
[1:01:39] man he made you a theophany just like
[1:01:42] himself
[1:01:44] when day six no that's the natural
[1:01:49] man this was before the foundation of
[1:01:51] the
[1:01:53] world we just read
[1:01:55] read he made you a theophany just like
[1:01:58] himself when he said let us to the
[1:02:02] creatures that he
[1:02:04] made talking to the animals right let us
[1:02:07] make man in our own image and our
[1:02:09] likeness a theophany God had never
[1:02:12] become flesh yet he was in theophany
[1:02:14] Moses saw him now you go on and
[1:02:19] read so what was made before the
[1:02:22] foundation of the world brother Brandon
[1:02:25] with the ofy man
[1:02:27] right now here's where we come
[1:02:31] to technical
[1:02:34] wording in our human terminologies the
[1:02:37] word
[1:02:39] made is like something you do you
[1:02:44] know and the word
[1:02:47] creation signifies a beginning
[1:02:50] right a human
[1:02:53] terminology
[1:02:55] but this man of 126 and
[1:02:57] 27 was God in another form
[1:03:06] amen that was not a
[1:03:11] creation no more than Jesus was the
[1:03:14] beginning of the creation of
[1:03:16] God and no more than the quote I gave
[1:03:19] you the other week where brother randam
[1:03:21] said God was his first creation right
[1:03:26] you remember that one yes God was his
[1:03:29] first creation he said then out of that
[1:03:31] came the
[1:03:35] logos what do you mean God when God
[1:03:40] begin it's words terminologies right to
[1:03:45] try to express the condescending of that
[1:03:48] God to where we can comprehend him and
[1:03:51] what kind of words could you use
[1:03:54] we're a new creation in Christ
[1:03:57] Jesus that's eternal life
[1:04:00] right now how could eternal life have a
[1:04:05] beginning we put it you you got a new
[1:04:07] creation that's easy to understand amen
[1:04:10] but how could eternal life have a
[1:04:12] beginning right so we use the word
[1:04:16] creation and the word creation to us
[1:04:19] always
[1:04:20] signifies something that was nonexistent
[1:04:23] right
[1:04:24] and then something that was made
[1:04:29] right as Jesus Took The Five Loaves and
[1:04:33] the couple of fishes or what it was
[1:04:35] which had States at there and they begin
[1:04:38] to
[1:04:43] create but
[1:04:45] remember he didn't throw away the two
[1:04:48] fishes and Loaves and then stand there
[1:04:50] and start no no he kept bringing it off
[1:04:53] the original right that's right so it's
[1:04:55] not even to
[1:04:57] signify our human words of creation
[1:05:01] right our human words of creation mean
[1:05:04] something that was created right there
[1:05:07] right all right
[1:05:10] now when brother R said when before the
[1:05:13] foundation of the world when God created
[1:05:16] You In His
[1:05:21] Image sure you said well look at our
[1:05:25] something was
[1:05:26] created I preached it back three or four
[1:05:29] messages
[1:05:32] ago that when God Elohim self
[1:05:37] existed as the prophet said stepped over
[1:05:40] in another
[1:05:41] form to be the word the Son of God the
[1:05:44] Loos the theophany if we wasn't in him
[1:05:48] then we never will have eternal life
[1:05:50] that's
[1:05:51] right
[1:05:53] amen was that a
[1:05:56] creation like something
[1:05:59] different
[1:06:00] no God in another form
[1:06:04] right God in another
[1:06:07] form before the foundation of the world
[1:06:10] remember the messages we preach that we
[1:06:13] were chosen in him amen not chosen by
[1:06:17] him or chosen of
[1:06:19] him we were chosen in
[1:06:22] himen when was he
[1:06:25] chosen when God stepped over in another
[1:06:28] form
[1:06:29] Amen to begin to
[1:06:33] create that was God's choosing to do
[1:06:35] that not God choosing like one's over
[1:06:38] here one's over there I'll take this and
[1:06:39] leave that one he never has done nothing
[1:06:41] like
[1:06:42] that
[1:06:44] amen it's when he stepped over in
[1:06:46] another form
[1:06:48] right you become a new creation
[1:06:53] am but not something that would have
[1:06:56] signifying no beginning and then a
[1:06:58] beginning because that's our words now
[1:07:01] sister said something to me about it and
[1:07:03] she said I hope you explain that one
[1:07:05] these day I said I'll get back to
[1:07:08] it what so much to Creation cuz it does
[1:07:11] sound odd doesn't it right CU we take
[1:07:14] the word creation and we make it
[1:07:15] something that was in
[1:07:17] non-existence and then we bring it into
[1:07:19] existence but as I was saying about the
[1:07:21] fish and the loav see and and then two
[1:07:24] we said we created a
[1:07:26] car from
[1:07:29] what did we get it off of Mars and
[1:07:34] Venus did we reach up in the A and grab
[1:07:36] some materials and do or did we take
[1:07:40] what we already
[1:07:43] had and made a car amen but what was it
[1:07:47] a new creation that's
[1:07:51] right not signifying something that was
[1:07:55] not before but then come it was just in
[1:07:58] another form before right so is it with
[1:08:02] God right
[1:08:05] right God just stepped over in another
[1:08:08] form to be able to where we could in
[1:08:10] some way one day be able to
[1:08:13] comprehend I said one day because I
[1:08:16] don't quite understand
[1:08:18] it I claim to believe it what he's
[1:08:21] revealed to me is what I understand amen
[1:08:24] now I still have my
[1:08:26] questions because as long as we in this
[1:08:28] world we're going to have
[1:08:29] them right but I believe we're getting
[1:08:32] closer amen but see going down to number
[1:08:40] three which would be uh the believer's
[1:08:44] position in Christ
[1:08:45] 1955 uh
[1:08:47] 1166 a service paragraph
[1:08:52] e35 look what he said
[1:08:58] listen you don't remember it neither do
[1:09:01] I but we were before the foundation of
[1:09:04] the world right now we don't believe in
[1:09:06] the Mormon doctrines and etc etc that's
[1:09:09] right so how was we before the
[1:09:11] foundation of the
[1:09:13] world little people running
[1:09:15] around little napoleons I believe I was
[1:09:18] there
[1:09:20] no no was in God right
[1:09:24] or else we got a
[1:09:26] problem but we was before the foundation
[1:09:29] of the
[1:09:30] world when God made made man said let us
[1:09:33] make man our own image let us give them
[1:09:36] plural let us get make man in our own
[1:09:39] image Spirit man and give them dominion
[1:09:42] over the fish of the Sea and the cattle
[1:09:44] and so forth he said Genesis 1 God said
[1:09:47] let us make man all before the
[1:09:50] foundation of the
[1:09:52] world
[1:09:59] this 126 and 27
[1:10:04] man was a part of God Amen right right
[1:10:09] how you going to say it cuz that's what
[1:10:10] your Prophet said amen he said we're
[1:10:13] just a part of God right amen he said
[1:10:16] not like a lamb or an arm no we're part
[1:10:19] of God where're his offspring where're
[1:10:22] his children amen
[1:10:25] and being that then we were back
[1:10:28] there
[1:10:32] ow now all these other people's got all
[1:10:34] these seeds and this and that and the
[1:10:36] other and they just come down and they
[1:10:37] make it sound so beautiful but when you
[1:10:39] get through you got the same question
[1:10:41] yeah right right amen you can shout all
[1:10:46] you want to and rejoice over what you
[1:10:48] hear but go back and check it you might
[1:10:50] be listening to Hera right right you
[1:10:53] know and I I don't think God can Quicken
[1:10:56] error well now he he quickened the truth
[1:10:58] to me and error to everybody no no no no
[1:11:00] he didn't Quicken no error to nobody he
[1:11:06] it but remember we was before the
[1:11:09] foundation of the
[1:11:12] world what part of
[1:11:14] us that eternal life that you have
[1:11:19] today amen was a part of
[1:11:22] God when he stepped over into that form
[1:11:24] called the word amen that's right now
[1:11:27] you remember who is this
[1:11:29] mezic we by Pastor the
[1:11:32] offy but he become full
[1:11:35] theophany but then the prophet said if
[1:11:37] we wasn't in him right we'll never be
[1:11:42] that's right that's right all right we
[1:11:45] become the word here
[1:11:48] yeah all right right because remember
[1:11:51] now where we're at we're coming down
[1:11:54] into the Fallen
[1:11:57] estate of
[1:12:01] mankind and getting down here where
[1:12:03] we're
[1:12:06] at and then becoming a Christian here
[1:12:10] right if we come here as a Christian
[1:12:13] with eternal life Jesus died in vain
[1:12:16] that's right that's where people don't
[1:12:17] realize that that's right as I told you
[1:12:20] there the other day the last message you
[1:12:22] remember the last couple of message
[1:12:25] that's what I preach up brother Richard
[1:12:27] and preached
[1:12:28] here why would Lucifer want to destroy
[1:12:33] Michael I hope you caught that when
[1:12:36] Michael was the only thing that kept
[1:12:39] Lucifer from being
[1:12:41] destroyed right he even protected
[1:12:45] Lucifer to where he could come to this
[1:12:47] earth and do his garbage caned
[1:12:50] plans and how long has he protected you
[1:12:53] and I
[1:12:55] to keep us from being destroyed that's
[1:12:57] right amen why would you want to destroy
[1:12:59] Michael why would you want to destroy
[1:13:01] Christ why would you want to destroy the
[1:13:04] truth
[1:13:07] amen everybody says that got the TRU I
[1:13:11] never met anybody said there's an error
[1:13:13] you ever met anybody in this message
[1:13:14] said I won't preach error to you
[1:13:16] today I had found it yet 40 something
[1:13:22] years but you
[1:13:24] see what do they do with the 126 and 27
[1:13:30] man
[1:13:32] now there's only one man that has
[1:13:36] eternal
[1:13:37] life and that's almighty
[1:13:40] God there's only one Eternal person in
[1:13:44] this almighty God that's right there's
[1:13:46] only one
[1:13:47] soul that is
[1:13:49] eternal that's the soul of
[1:13:52] God
[1:13:53] the only way you and I can have eternal
[1:13:55] life is by accepting Jesus Christ as our
[1:13:58] savior and letting giving us let letting
[1:14:01] him give us eternal life right
[1:14:05] amen no but brother d i I know these
[1:14:08] quotes that always was eternal the
[1:14:12] eternal life you have always was
[1:14:15] eternal but was you
[1:14:22] eternal
[1:14:23] well then if you was eternal will you
[1:14:26] even have any comprehension in your
[1:14:31] mind to
[1:14:34] think that one day you was a sinner
[1:14:40] right surely there's not a human in the
[1:14:43] world that wouldn't in one way or the
[1:14:45] other
[1:14:47] admit that that some part of their
[1:14:50] life that they were Sinners surely
[1:14:52] there's not a human that would go that
[1:14:55] route now there's cooks that go that
[1:14:57] route but I said a human right amen amen
[1:15:01] a good old ficing Baptist beli
[1:15:09] that that you was
[1:15:12] lost but see the people this message
[1:15:14] want to come here saying you're
[1:15:16] saved yeah well now I've been through it
[1:15:19] over and over with you up and down
[1:15:20] through it and everything
[1:15:22] else
[1:15:24] that the only way we can have eternal
[1:15:26] life is we come here in Jesus Christ
[1:15:30] amen then Christ got to come in you and
[1:15:33] I where did Eve get her
[1:15:36] start in Adam right but the way we
[1:15:40] preach it see we preach it that it was
[1:15:42] that Adam was in
[1:15:44] Eve that's a good old Catholic Doctrine
[1:15:47] folks that's right amen but yet have the
[1:15:49] preach of the message call it Revelation
[1:15:52] yeah
[1:15:58] but
[1:16:02] listen that 126 and 27 man would have it
[1:16:05] been Jesus
[1:16:07] Christ I said it to where I wanted to
[1:16:09] Jesus
[1:16:11] Christ who is the logos theop Son of God
[1:16:15] whatever you want to call
[1:16:18] him and according to Galatians 3:16
[1:16:21] there is only one seed
[1:16:23] right which it labels it there and says
[1:16:26] it's Christ
[1:16:28] amen yep the only way you can have
[1:16:30] eternal life is to be a part of that
[1:16:32] Christ amen so the 126 and 27 man is not
[1:16:36] the creation of all man right amen
[1:16:41] sir but yet we will cover this afternoon
[1:16:43] that man falls under that because of his
[1:16:47] creation
[1:16:48] right you know that brother around said
[1:16:51] every person in the world
[1:16:53] is a child of God by creation sure
[1:17:00] amen and that they are in the image of
[1:17:04] God in the form that they can create
[1:17:08] right right see that's where we leave it
[1:17:11] all out we don't jump over here jump
[1:17:13] over there why can't we put it all
[1:17:16] together but you see where this man was
[1:17:18] created at before the foundation of the
[1:17:20] world right then so we'll just say these
[1:17:24] few words and then
[1:17:26] quit
[1:17:31] then Genesis 2 comes into
[1:17:35] being and God creates a body called
[1:17:40] Adam y brother RAM on Blasphemous 9 said
[1:17:44] especially into Adam right he breathed
[1:17:47] the breath of eternal life
[1:17:49] right why because he was the beginning
[1:17:52] of the creation
[1:17:53] of life so you need have to begin his
[1:17:55] full grown that's why we don't believe
[1:17:58] you say well which come first a chicken
[1:18:01] or the
[1:18:03] egg kind to show how smart we are and
[1:18:06] show how dumb we are God didn't create
[1:18:09] eggs he created chickens right I don't
[1:18:11] reading my Bible he created two eggs
[1:18:13] laid them out on the Rock let them
[1:18:18] hatch I don't like jokes especially
[1:18:21] about Bible
[1:18:26] but see now you come to Genesis 2 so we
[1:18:28] pick up there this
[1:18:30] afternoon Genesis 2 will pick up the
[1:18:32] word and natural creation of
[1:18:36] man and God placed in that
[1:18:39] man eternal life right
[1:18:43] right the part of God that was
[1:18:48] eternal before the world came into the
[1:18:51] man called Adam
[1:18:54] and gave him eternal life
[1:18:57] y just as the new
[1:19:01] birth comes into you and I and God
[1:19:05] breathes into our
[1:19:09] nostrils the breath of eternal
[1:19:14] life and we become an eternal person in
[1:19:19] Soul by the new birth one the prophet
[1:19:22] said the new birth is most important
[1:19:24] thing in the world but brother Dale I've
[1:19:26] been in the message all these years I
[1:19:27] told Brother Richard Wilson this morning
[1:19:29] I said Brother Richard I realized that
[1:19:31] when the prophet of God said he didn't
[1:19:32] know how many to be saved in that last
[1:19:35] moment to to Rapture the church I said
[1:19:38] Brother Richard you realize it might be
[1:19:44] us I said of course I believe that
[1:19:46] there'll be some
[1:19:47] saved you know I believe it'll be a
[1:19:50] twofold there'll be some saved but you
[1:19:52] know could be you and I realizing we're
[1:19:54] lost and get eternal life well then I've
[1:19:56] reached my goal if it does if there's
[1:19:58] one person
[1:19:59] today that God can speak to your heart
[1:20:02] and try to get you to see that you need
[1:20:03] eternal
[1:20:05] life amen then I've done my part my
[1:20:08] part's Done Right y but I feel it
[1:20:12] there's your spirit thing we're talking
[1:20:14] about
[1:20:18] one brother there you mean to tell me
[1:20:20] that when I receive the new birth
[1:20:23] that a person comes in
[1:20:25] me
[1:20:28] right well I'm just going to put it to
[1:20:30] plain language there ain't no other way
[1:20:33] it could be that's right
[1:20:36] amen when God spoke that he spoke it
[1:20:39] ain't no other way for it to be when
[1:20:41] your Prophet said what is it Christ my
[1:20:43] God reveal what is a new birth he say
[1:20:45] it's the person of Jesus Christ revealed
