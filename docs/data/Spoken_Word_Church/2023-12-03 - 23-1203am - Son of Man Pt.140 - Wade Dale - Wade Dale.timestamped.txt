[8:07] fill my way every day with
[8:09] love amen we want more of God's love in
[8:13] our life and you know I thinking um when
[8:17] brother Ron was U that Sunday school
[8:19] Sermon Just sister Anna listening to
[8:21] that sermon is just as what of the
[8:23] chances of you listening to that sermon
[8:26] the same one that he has in his quotes
[8:27] there's such a confirmation
[8:29] a witness of the spirit there I want to
[8:32] share something I don't want to take up
[8:33] too much time I know this is a song
[8:35] service um last week Thanksgiving week
[8:38] we were all for a couple of days and uh
[8:41] you know sometimes you just need God to
[8:42] tell you I love you and you can read it
[8:45] in the scripture you can hear it a lot
[8:47] of times um through the sermons but when
[8:50] it's personal to you you look for that
[8:53] that thing that Supernatural way that
[8:56] it's impossible it just couldn't happen
[8:58] you just didn't pick up the this and so
[9:00] um I had a flat tire I had to go get a
[9:03] flat tire fix who wants a flat tire on
[9:05] Thanksgiving race so Friday I go get the
[9:07] flat tire fixed I need a oil
[9:10] change I go over to Walmart and get a
[9:13] oil change I had to wait walked around
[9:15] the store looking in the hunting section
[9:18] here comes a a man on a handicap cart
[9:21] one of those assist cars and he asked me
[9:23] a question about a gun and I said well
[9:25] it's about this and here's the BBS thank
[9:28] you sir you know bless you God bless you
[9:30] and we just went our ways I went back to
[9:33] the old change station cuz they were
[9:35] finished with the truck and he comes
[9:37] through the door and he's walking on his
[9:39] um um his uh crutches and he's missing a
[9:42] leg the same man he said we meet again
[9:44] and so I started to talk to him about
[9:46] Thanksgiving he started to talk to me
[9:48] about how good God is to him and things
[9:51] I'm waiting in line to pay for my own
[9:53] oil change and the Lord said pay for his
[9:56] and I said okay so I discreetly go up
[9:58] there and I try to pay for it and they
[10:00] said well it's going to take 2 hours cuz
[10:02] you can't pay for it until his car's
[10:04] done I said well I'll go get cash so I
[10:07] go get cash in the front I come back to
[10:09] the oil chain station he's gone he said
[10:12] well he went on his little cart into the
[10:14] store I walked around Walmart 45 minutes
[10:17] to try to find him and when I found him
[10:20] I told him I said the Lord just put it
[10:21] on my heart to pay for your oil chains
[10:23] here's some extra money for things given
[10:25] in your presence and stuff and he just
[10:27] opened up and I heard his story of how
[10:29] he lost his leg the hardships he was
[10:32] going through I took a picture of him
[10:34] he's on my prayer list and his name is
[10:37] Mike
[10:39] and and afterwards we uh he gave me his
[10:42] phone number I gave him my name I said
[10:44] you pray for me I pray for you and when
[10:46] I was walking away I got in my truck
[10:49] that song on my heart was I love him I
[10:53] love him because he first loved me and
[10:55] you need God to hear you say that so I
[10:58] get him my truck and I'm going to the
[11:00] next stop a store and I turn on my phone
[11:04] and some of you might have the lifeline
[11:05] app from voice of God I click on the
[11:08] sermon and it's a random sermon that
[11:10] just plays that's constantly playing and
[11:14] it was the bomb and
[11:16] gilean and it started at the end of the
[11:19] sermon when brother brandham and the
[11:21] whole congregation was singing I love
[11:23] him I love him cuz he first loved
[11:27] me what are the
[11:29] chances what are the chances just like
[11:32] this morning you had you were listening
[11:34] to that same sermon that he had in his
[11:36] nose what are the chances that God put a
[11:38] song on my heart out of 1400 messages I
[11:40] click on it and at that exact same place
[11:43] they're singing the same song a song of
[11:47] Deliverance right and then I realized
[11:51] God gave me a flat tire so I could go to
[11:53] town get it fixed meet a man pay his oil
[11:56] change so he can put a song in my heart
[11:58] so I got in my truck clicked on a sermon
[12:01] and it was the same song that was
[12:03] singing God gave me a flat tire to tell
[12:06] me he loves
[12:08] me the next time God gives you a flat
[12:11] tire or something look for him in that
[12:14] look for the testimony on that because
[12:16] he does things in such a supernatural
[12:19] way he speaks and don't we love him for
[12:21] that amen oh let me walk blessed
[12:27] Lord thou Hast gone leading straight to
[12:32] the land
[12:36] above giving cheer everywhere to the sad

[17:21] [Music]
[17:23] time you know how brother R said that
[17:26] that healing came by
[17:29] Love by love you entered
[17:34] into that
[17:36] person like the sister did praying for
[17:38] the little baby cuz she had a little
[17:40] baby and she was a mama and she knew so
[17:43] she entered into that and so today I
[17:46] thinking all the needs that we have in
[17:48] the building different ones we got a lot
[17:50] that that are gone and out brother Louis
[17:52] and brother Aaron are um in a foreign
[17:55] country today and we sure miss them but
[17:58] just whatever is on your heart today
[18:01] just bring it in bring it in the
[18:03] building bring it in here and let's
[18:05] let's let the Lord tell us what to do
[18:08] about it boy brother Ryan wonderful job
[18:11] brother good good
[18:16] job but let's just bring it in bring it
[18:18] in and give it to the Lord amen we try
[18:21] sometimes to work it out our own self
[18:24] you will
[18:25] fail you will fail fail every time but
[18:31] if you give it to the Lord he said bring
[18:33] your burdens and put them on me so we
[18:36] going to put our burdens on the Lord
[18:37] today everything that we have need of
[18:39] this is the time of the years like um
[18:42] brother Joe's talking about you see
[18:43] people that are uh this time of the year
[18:46] people I like this time of the year
[18:48] because people are happy most of the
[18:49] time but those that are going through
[18:51] issues and and losing loved ones brother
[18:54] Dy God bless him we're going to really
[18:56] pray for the family there
[18:59] and but anything that that goes on it
[19:01] just kind
[19:02] of it it just it it's more I guess you
[19:05] more it hurts you more I guess when you
[19:08] when you come into a time of of of
[19:11] having a time with family and some of
[19:12] the family's gone and um then you you
[19:16] you weren't the same one you did last
[19:17] year they're not there now maybe lose
[19:19] loved one or something it hurts but God
[19:22] said he'd be the one that would comfort
[19:25] us I can't
[19:27] comfort
[19:28] because I haven't
[19:30] lost a child but God can wrap his big
[19:34] old loving arms around you he can put
[19:37] his loving arms around you and he'll
[19:39] he'll do it by the word of God he'll
[19:41] he'll either put somebody like brother
[19:42] Joe said somebody he'll flatten your
[19:45] tire to get you to to get you to to be
[19:48] able to testify to somebody so um now
[19:51] how many of us have been in that
[19:52] position though I'm
[19:54] I'm and I didn't think
[19:57] that come on hello
[20:00] somebody you're there complaining why
[20:02] your tire was flat why this happened why
[20:04] that happened why' you do this why' that
[20:07] happen where did that nail come from how
[20:09] what am I going to do right hello okay I
[20:13] knew we were all human but then you look
[20:16] at the end of it though but why don't we
[20:17] start now and say Lord what is it am
[20:21] what what's
[20:22] next if we believe we're children of God
[20:25] he's going to let light afflictions and
[20:27] he's going to let light things happen to
[20:28] us that's what the Bible says to what
[20:30] drive us to him so that we can see that
[20:33] that that we are being used as brother
[20:35] Joe you know a flat tire to talk to a
[20:38] person to maybe to maybe give him a
[20:40] little uh you know he lost his legs give
[20:43] him a a little boost and then then give
[20:45] brother Joel a little boost say hey
[20:47] you're in the right channel because I'm
[20:49] I'm going to turn that music on that
[20:51] played probably 60 something years ago
[20:55] on a tape and that happens to be the one
[20:57] so that wasn't a coincidence that was
[21:00] God so we see him working and moving and
[21:03] we sure appreciate the Lord remember
[21:05] brother L brother Aaron I am so glad
[21:07] they took Aaron right off the airplane
[21:08] and put him in the pull pet he did a
[21:10] real good job if for those of you that
[21:12] didn't stream in it's on there somewhere
[21:15] on WhatsApp and sister Christine's kept
[21:17] us a breast of all those things so just
[21:19] remember that remember brother Bob he is
[21:20] in Mobile preaching um this coming
[21:24] Friday uh Saturday at 4:00 at brother
[21:27] burley's
[21:28] um is going to be a bonfire and then
[21:30] they're going to have a singing
[21:30] afterwards I'm going to try to go myself
[21:32] it'll be at his church if anybody like
[21:34] to go I can give you the
[21:36] address and then next Sunday we'll have
[21:39] one
[21:40] service and we're going to cut it just a
[21:42] little bit short cuz we're going to have
[21:43] a
[21:44] baptism okay so I'll get the pool all
[21:48] heated up this week and if anybody else
[21:49] would like to be baptized it'll be 100
[21:52] degrees don't matter what it is outside
[21:54] that pool will be 100° and we'll baptize
[21:56] you but there is one young sister wants
[21:58] to be baptized and we're going to do it

[22:38] school and we're probably going to have
[22:40] a baby dedication that day so we'll
[22:43] that'll be a surprise and U I was asked
[22:46] to do a baby dedication a couple days
[22:48] ago and he picked that day him and his
[22:50] wife did so his brother Daniel Perry and

[23:46] we're heading toward a place to where
[23:48] that won't happen no more that won't
[23:51] happen no more there'll be no e and flow
[23:53] it'll all be one big flow right into

[24:25] all so Lord as that word service means
[24:29] serve Lord I pray that you'd serve us a
[24:32] meal today we come asking in hungry Lord
[24:36] for a meal from you father and Lord I
[24:38] pray that you'll give it to us father
[24:41] and may we hear you Lord and understand
[24:43] what you're saying to us for the hour
[24:45] that we're living in forgive us of our
[24:47] faults and failures and our sins and
[24:50] sometimes as we were saying we have an
[24:52] attitude Lord that we shouldn't have
[24:54] when something happens and and there you
[24:56] are right in the middle of it and boy
[24:57] sure makes you ashamed when that happens
[25:00] it makes me ashamed when I see that the
[25:02] Lord does something like that and I
[25:04] become a little bit angry or or but be a
[25:07] human Lord but I pray that we as
[25:08] Christians should look for everything
[25:10] that that we do should be something
[25:13] connected to you Lord and I pray Lord
[25:15] that you be with us this service be with
[25:16] the ones that are sick be with the ones
[25:18] that are not here be with the ones that
[25:19] are in the foreign countries Lord just
[25:21] cover each one by your blood in Jesus
[25:23] name we pray amen all right part 140
[25:28] we'll talk a little bit
[25:30] today about growth because we're and
[25:34] we'll talk about when you sit down so in
[25:36] the beginning was the word word was with
[25:38] God and the Word was God and that word
[25:40] was made flesh and dwelt among us and we
[25:42] beheld his glory the glory of the only
[25:43] begotten of the father full of grace and
[25:46] truth you may be seated and the Lord has
[25:47] his Blessing to the reading of the
[25:49] word in Colossians 1 this is what we're
[25:52] trying to get to for by him were all
[25:54] things created so God created all things
[25:57] this person this man that are in Heaven
[26:00] and Earth visible and invisible where
[26:02] they be Thrones dominions principalities
[26:04] Powers all things were created by Him
[26:06] and for him what the powerful Gody we
[26:08] got here and he is before all things and
[26:10] by him all things consist so where's the
[26:13] devil in that I don't even see him in
[26:16] there but we we let him as Ryan said we
[26:18] let him poke in there somewhere all
[26:20] right get on our shoulder I he's a lot
[26:23] closer to me if he was just on my
[26:24] shoulder I could literally flick him off
[26:26] so but I he gets inside my head
[26:29] sometimes yeah once in a while once in
[26:31] the morning while in the afternoon so he
[26:33] is before all things and by him all
[26:35] things consist and he is the head of the
[26:37] body of the church all right so he is
[26:39] our headship when we move he tells us to
[26:42] move supposely that's the way it's
[26:44] supposed to be because you can only move
[26:46] by what your body tell your head tells
[26:48] you to do this is a control tower right
[26:52] he's the beginning the firstborn from
[26:53] the dead and in all things he might have
[26:55] the prence for it pleased the father
[26:56] that in him now look it pleased the
[26:59] father that in him should all fullness
[27:00] dwell now what were we talking about
[27:02] last week now God is pleased that all
[27:05] fullness dwells in a bride amen all
[27:08] right and that is we'll stop here just
[27:10] for a moment and we'll look at the
[27:13] dispensations and we'll we'll see it on
[27:14] the chart here maybe a little bit
[27:17] later there's dispensations and God
[27:20] works in a dispensation like Luther
[27:22] Wesley different ones they weren't
[27:23] required what we were required we
[27:25] weren't required what they were required
[27:28] we we're required them plus cuz we're
[27:30] here at the end we got to have all
[27:33] things all right and and I don't think
[27:35] that maybe Martin Luther could have
[27:37] stood up and and preached the sermon
[27:39] that she is
[27:41] him he didn't have that understanding he
[27:43] didn't need that understanding listen
[27:46] God's not going to throw something out
[27:47] there and then nobody understands it
[27:50] he's going to give it to you in the
[27:52] portion that you need in the hour you
[27:54] need it in and in the dispensation so
[27:57] this is a the dispensation of the son of
[27:59] man all right now we had a dispensation
[28:03] we've been talking these 140
[28:05] sermons we have been under the Son of
[28:08] God dispensation called Church ages okay
[28:12] all right and it started on the day of
[28:14] Pentecost God came back down into the
[28:17] People by the Holy Ghost got inside the
[28:19] people cleaned their soul up and then
[28:22] started cleaning their Spirit realm up
[28:25] all right but remember they weren't
[28:26] required to come to full adoption that's
[28:30] right amen okay that was not a
[28:32] requirement you don't it's not required
[28:34] when you go to this first grade it's not
[28:35] required that you understand calculus
[28:38] but you got to get the basic before you
[28:40] can understand calculus all right so
[28:42] that we can grow all right and then what
[28:44] what are we doing we're growing to where
[28:47] uh brother B calls it in morphe our our
[28:49] changing form so what happens is now the
[28:52] bride we know it's a she we know we've
[28:54] read a quote Brides brides Church
[28:57] churches Brides but there's going to
[28:59] come one so he's honing it all down to
[29:01] where a prophet of God could stand one
[29:03] day and it's rising of the son and say
[29:06] she is him
[29:08] yes she is him so the dispensation
[29:10] changed the dispensation changed from
[29:12] church to bride now that bride is
[29:15] supposed to be mature she's supposed to
[29:17] be not just like Jesus Christ cuz they
[29:19] did that down through the church ages
[29:21] they were like Christ but we're supposed
[29:23] to be Christ yes now they were they just
[29:26] didn't understand understand it listen
[29:28] it's hard to understand that the Holy
[29:30] Ghost never taught a false Doctrine yet
[29:33] Luther could stand in a pull pit and
[29:36] preach that just shall live by faith but
[29:40] be a
[29:41] trinitarian that didn't come from his
[29:43] soul realm that came from his Spirit
[29:45] realm but listen God said okay that's
[29:48] all right that's all I require you now
[29:50] is to come out of this church come out
[29:53] of this Catholic system same way with me
[29:56] and you he didn't requ require that you
[29:58] understand the full opening of the seals
[29:59] he didn't want you to understand that
[30:01] when you were a baby in Christ you were
[30:03] just struggling to do right yes you were
[30:06] just struggling to act right your
[30:08] dispensation is you were in the church
[30:10] ages you were trying to figure out who
[30:12] this son of God is amen not worryed
[30:14] about the son of man at the moment worry
[30:16] about who the Son of God is he's God in
[30:19] the form of the Holy Spirit now listen
[30:23] the Holy Spirit and it's continued to be
[30:26] the Holy Spirit but the Holy Spirit now
[30:28] working in a higher
[30:29] level all right the holy spirit is
[30:31] working now in a higher level there's
[30:33] more
[30:34] requirement listen there always has been
[30:36] a
[30:37] rocket there always has been Rocket Fuel
[30:40] there always has been all these things
[30:42] it just took a while for a man to get it
[30:44] together right Orville and Wilbur did
[30:46] not create a
[30:49] spaceship they were just trying to get
[30:51] out off the ground and they got like 30
[30:54] feet off the ground and went a couple
[30:56] hundred feet and they were like
[30:58] wow well man you know what do we do we
[31:01] laugh at that now but the people
[31:03] watching it was like wow that's
[31:05] something
[31:06] new wow that's something new they're 30t
[31:10] off the ground they went 200 feet in the
[31:12] air well what came from that brother
[31:15] Aaron got an airplane in Atlanta flew
[31:17] all the way down to Central America you
[31:19] can get in a plane now and you can fly
[31:21] all the way almost to the Philippines
[31:22] Halfway Around the World in the same
[31:25] plane and they feed you 3 Mill a day or
[31:28] three meals in the flight give you all
[31:30] kind of entertainment well now Orville
[31:31] and Wilbur didn't have that so when you
[31:34] were a newborn baby in Christ you were
[31:36] just trying to get up off the ground yes
[31:38] sir all right I'm backing up just a
[31:40] little bit cuz I want to tell you about
[31:41] dispensations cuz we're fixing to change
[31:43] one we've been in the Son of God
[31:46] dispensation is the church ages the
[31:48] seven Church ages there was a
[31:50] dispensation that God was working
[31:52] through a group of people trying to get
[31:55] them saved right or filled with the Holy
[31:58] Ghost but not so much coming to maturity
[32:00] now he's also wanted he's always wanted
[32:02] us to come to maturity because Peter
[32:04] preached
[32:05] it but then the Catholic Church picks it
[32:08] up and says you don't need to be mature
[32:10] just listen to what we got to say
[32:12] because we're the mature one well that
[32:15] was the devil standing there everybody
[32:17] with me cuz God wants to work through
[32:19] his people as Bob was talking about with
[32:22] the nickolath and spirit we'll get into
[32:23] that when we talk about the in the seals
[32:26] it conquered the people the the people
[32:28] just finally just got so blinded and
[32:30] they just said okay whatever we're just
[32:33] going to go to church and we're going to
[32:34] you're going to preach in Latin we're
[32:35] going to understand what you say but we
[32:37] know when you do this right here and we
[32:39] do this that everything's all right
[32:42] right sister everything's good go back
[32:43] home do whatever you want to do but just
[32:46] make sure that you do what Papa Pope
[32:48] says and we're good well you see that
[32:51] was a dispensation listen he's going to
[32:53] be some Catholic
[32:54] bride oh yeah oh don't get quiet on
[32:58] me there's going to be some Catholic
[33:01] bride cuz they lived in their
[33:03] dispensation that they lived in
[33:05] everybody with me now they didn't they
[33:07] weren't Catholic like Catholic Catholic
[33:09] but even Martin Luther Martin Luther was
[33:12] half Catholic even when he come out he
[33:14] was still bringing some of the Catholic
[33:15] church with him out of there and Columba
[33:18] in the Dark Ages all of different ones
[33:21] worked in Catholicism I don't think go
[33:23] listen I don't think for one minute that
[33:25] God for that 15 UND years of Dark Ages
[33:28] that there was nobody
[33:30] saved somebody became bride during that
[33:33] time somebody accepted the message of
[33:35] the hour for their hour and became bride
[33:38] listen we sit here today knowing that we
[33:41] have the most powerful message in the
[33:42] world yes formidable opponent opponent
[33:46] to the devil AB but you know what when
[33:48] we get into that future home we don't we
[33:51] only going to be like one
[33:55] Street 99% of the people never heard of
[33:59] this message they're a bride they're
[34:00] already gone they're already in another
[34:02] dimension waiting on us to bring them
[34:05] here oh no it's going to be full of
[34:07] message Believers yeah it's going to be
[34:09] full of message Believers for their
[34:10] message for their
[34:12] day so we don't disclude all those but
[34:14] you know let God separate them yes sir
[34:16] don't worry about it we going to try to
[34:18] pull them all in remember brother around
[34:19] said draw the circle bigger amen all
[34:23] right but now we got to realize the
[34:25] dispensation we're in now is that God is
[34:28] now requiring that he's been in human
[34:31] flesh for 2,000 years now listen to me a
[34:33] minute he's been in flesh for 2,000
[34:35] years right now he wants us to use
[34:40] that Aaron's not
[34:46] here I'm cutting the cool on cuz I'm
[34:49] hot I know the ones of you the fan and
[34:51] not just keep flies off of you maybe
[34:53] keep you awake right Jeffrey yeah
[34:58] ah air conditioning see there we got all
[35:00] we got to do is punch a button that's
[35:03] right Martin Luther and him probably
[35:05] would have they would have loved to had
[35:07] some of this air conditioning when they
[35:08] were outside preaching like I was
[35:10] talking about John Wesley reading his he
[35:12] preach 20 sermons a
[35:15] day he jumped up he one time he didn't
[35:17] have a place to preach he jumped up on
[35:19] somebody's mosum in the middle of a
[35:21] cemetery and started preaching you know
[35:23] what one souls to
[35:24] god what have we ever done
[35:28] but now that requirement has come to us
[35:30] to become to full maturity there not be
[35:32] a piece left there not be one section of
[35:35] this body not working that's why from
[35:38] now today from day forward it's serious
[35:41] time yes it's serious time we've had a
[35:44] whole year when we were talking about
[35:46] let it out get the thing whatever it is
[35:48] get it out and let's get something in or
[35:51] let the Holy Ghost out and let him
[35:52] reflect himself in a group of people to
[35:55] the world all right but she is him can
[35:58] you can you swallow that that you are
[36:01] God made manifest in another form called
[36:03] a
[36:04] bride that you are the manifestation not
[36:07] a manifestation you're the manifestation
[36:09] of God for the day and hour you're
[36:11] living in yes all right that's updated
[36:13] Revelation that's a dispensation that we
[36:15] come to the Brides brides churches
[36:17] Brides but they'll come what which is
[36:21] here now today yes
[36:23] sir and she is him so whatever the Bible
[36:27] talks of Jesus Christ now he's talking
[36:29] about you now back in the church church
[36:32] ages they couldn't preach that Jesus Is
[36:36] Here We must believe he's our savior
[36:39] right right believe on Lord Jesus Christ
[36:42] and thou shal be saved but you got to
[36:44] bring it now to where Prophet stood one
[36:45] day brother Tim pu was preaching
[36:47] yesterday at the at a Minister's meeting
[36:50] and he did a real good job about
[36:51] bringing bringing everything back in we
[36:54] got to realize every time
[36:57] that God talks about and gives a promise
[37:00] to the Lord Jesus in the Bible it's for
[37:02] me and you yes we're it's the same thing
[37:05] it's HS and Joint HS he got a glorified
[37:08] body you're going to get a glorified
[37:09] body you're going to have to suffer a
[37:10] little bit he said look take up your
[37:12] what take up your
[37:14] cross and follow me so you got a cross
[37:17] to bear you don't have to get up here
[37:19] and physically die but you got to cross
[37:21] you got to drag around with you all the
[37:23] time but she is him there's a
[37:26] manifestation now of God in this
[37:28] dispensation that's
[37:31] physical it's been physical all along we
[37:33] just haven't been able to understand it
[37:35] it now is physical that she is him that
[37:38] Adam and Eve were literally the same
[37:41] person that's right DNA from Adam DNA
[37:44] from Eve couldn't tell the difference
[37:46] because they came from she came out from
[37:49] him amen that's where where did we come
[37:53] from we came from out of him all right
[37:56] and that's that's where he wanted us to
[37:57] fellowship with us he wanted Adam was
[38:00] lonely remember God was lonely he made
[38:02] Adam Adam was lonely he made
[38:04] Eve okay so God's been lonely the whole
[38:07] time I was telling you before and I was
[38:09] telling him down at brother Martin's
[38:10] last weekend the Lord Jesus has not laid
[38:13] eyes on us physically he's waiting to
[38:16] see his bride physically see us oh when
[38:20] we get caught up in the air he's going
[38:22] to be you talking about being caught up
[38:24] he's going to physically see us Regina
[38:27] we're going to be right there with him
[38:28] and he's going to be able to touch us
[38:29] he's not able to touch us now he has
[38:31] nobody on this Earth but me and
[38:33] you he can hear us through the blood
[38:37] amen cuz we've not come to Perfection
[38:39] totally yet this thing's still dead
[38:41] that's right remember brother brandom he
[38:42] went across a curtain of time but where
[38:43] was his body his body was still there
[38:46] because it was born in sin that was the
[38:48] part that needed to be changed or go to
[38:50] the grave and be brought up in a
[38:52] resurrection that's the two things that
[38:54] we got to deal with but in this this
[38:56] dispensation is though is that somebody
[38:58] is not going to die according to the
[39:01] Bible according to the prophet's message
[39:03] someone is going to stand on this Earth
[39:05] and as brother Randon we were talking
[39:07] before in the adoption series he said
[39:09] you won't be praying for people anymore
[39:11] you'll be commanding the thing now
[39:14] brother Ryan what did he just tell
[39:17] y'all he commanded that devil to leave
[39:19] him alone he commanded that Devil he's
[39:22] going to believe it right here brother
[39:24] John he commanded that devil to get off
[39:26] his shoulder we think the devil's got
[39:28] his filthy claws dug in us he's not he's
[39:31] just sitting there right come on you
[39:34] think oh no he's got his claws you let
[39:36] him you you know what you did you let
[39:38] him sit there long enough to get
[39:40] fingernails
[39:42] help preach a little bit
[39:44] today you let him sit there so long he
[39:47] he become a part he he took Roots if
[39:51] you'll get him off to begin with you can
[39:54] get him off a whole lot quicker but this
[39:56] is what we have to realize this is our
[39:58] time brother B was talking about Easter
[40:00] and this is rising of the sun it's 1965
[40:03] this is uh less than a year before he
[40:05] passed on he he was able to tell us this
[40:08] and as he being the groom the bride has
[40:10] to come forth now come forth from what
[40:13] him all right that's why we've been
[40:15] talking about the statute of perfect man
[40:17] this is the dispensation of the Son of
[40:19] God this is this is your seven Church
[40:21] ages everybody with me this right here
[40:25] has not been known by man until the end
[40:27] time and we'll read it a little bit he
[40:30] left the Earth the son of man left CU it
[40:32] was God in human flesh God in human
[40:34] flesh he left but remember what the
[40:37] angel said said that same one you see
[40:39] leaving that same
[40:40] one now that same one didn't come back
[40:43] on the day of
[40:47] Pentecost he came back in spirit form on
[40:49] the day of Pentecost he didn't come back
[40:51] in flesh form in their flesh yes but I
[40:54] mean when he was standing there brother
[40:55] George he was standing there on that
[40:56] mountain or wherever he was and he was
[40:59] what he he ascended well he took his
[41:01] body with him his Earthly body it all
[41:04] went but those two angels said hey you
[41:07] see that
[41:09] cloud you see that
[41:12] cloud that same Lord Jesus you see go up
[41:15] he's facing to come back in the same way
[41:17] he left and he is now in his
[41:22] bride amen but he came back on the day
[41:24] of Pentecost as the New Birth as the as
[41:28] the soul of God being parted out among a
[41:30] group of people that were trying to live
[41:32] the word of God the best they knew how
[41:34] but there's more requirement now there's
[41:36] more requirement that we are what wife
[41:38] that we use this uh power and authority
[41:42] that we have not power and authority to
[41:45] zap your boss out of existence or that
[41:47] guy that cut you off on the road or or
[41:49] you know the person that was mad at you
[41:51] in Walmart or something no that's not
[41:53] what it's used for right to me I want to
[41:56] focus on trying to get everybody saved
[41:58] and Sanctified and filled with the Holy
[41:59] Ghost that's what I want whole family
[42:02] everybody everybody connected to me am
[42:04] man you ought to do that you say oh no
[42:07] that per now wait a
[42:09] minute God might have said the same
[42:11] thing about you one
[42:13] day when somebody's trying to talk to
[42:15] you about the Lord and you're like
[42:16] running off somewhere or you're running
[42:18] over under and running
[42:19] [Music]

[42:28] she he's got to get the bride what to

[42:50] minutes where the Lord Jesus grew in
[42:53] stature not statue sure we're all going
[42:55] to grow in statue unless you're unless

[43:05] she's going to be bone of his bone flesh
[43:07] of his flesh life of his life do we
[43:09] really believe that all right there was
[43:12] one purpose he had that God might dwell
[43:14] in his church now here look one
[43:17] purpose that God might dwell in his
[43:20] church and continue his plans through
[43:23] the church sir not just dwell in her her
[43:26] sit there and enjoy life and enjoy s
[43:28] church service no to be used by God
[43:31] continue his plan through the church
[43:33] that God was in Christ continuing his
[43:35] plan through Christ out of Christ into
[43:37] the church continuing his work through
[43:39] the church all right now see brother
[43:42] rown in 1959 he's saying Church well now
[43:46] that could be Baptist Methodist
[43:47] Pentecostal he was preaching to a whole
[43:48] group of people right but we come to the
[43:51] seals though and he says hey I now call
[43:54] you bride in other words words I weeded
[43:56] out he didn't but his message weeded out
[43:59] remember he's preached to thousands of
[44:01] people thousands of people when he was
[44:03] healing but when he come down to preach
[44:05] the Raptor message he preached it in a
[44:07] trailer out in Arizona there's only 30
[44:08] something people I think in the in in
[44:10] the trailer this great message of the
[44:14] Rapture what happened honing time they
[44:19] couldn't take it so they left listen if
[44:21] you don't have the Holy Ghost
[44:23] today you're going to leave
[44:27] physically you're going to leave because
[44:30] you can't stand
[44:32] it you can't stand it so you'll
[44:34] physically leave cuz you don't have the
[44:37] Holy Ghost I ain't talking about going
[44:39] somewhere and I'm talking about you you
[44:40] see people you see people come in as one
[44:43] brother I've always love him still love
[44:46] him still see him all the time man he
[44:48] sit on the front row and he would just
[44:50] pull like you wouldn't believe and I
[44:52] mean he not like some of y'all like
[44:54] falling asleep he be be on that front
[44:56] row right there and he'd
[44:58] be he's
[45:02] gone he had some fuel but he didn't have
[45:04] no
[45:05] fire he had a little fuel but it takes
[45:07] some mechanics and the Dynamics to do it
[45:10] sir cuz listen you won't walk away from
[45:11] this message with the Holy Ghost the
[45:14] message of the hour is the Holy Ghost
[45:16] for the hour do you understand what I'm
[45:17] saying cuz you can't get Luther's Holy
[45:19] Ghost now it's the same Holy Ghost but
[45:21] you can't get his type cuz that's just
[45:24] justification that's just getting you
[45:25] stu started now the requirement is full
[45:28] adoption as brother R said many many
[45:30] times and continue his work through the
[45:33] church all right let's continue all that
[45:35] God was he poured into Christ because he
[45:37] emptied himself and poured into Christ
[45:38] now that's a dispensation there was a
[45:40] dispensation of Jehovah and the Old
[45:42] Testament God above us there's no way he
[45:44] could get in man because of what because
[45:46] of the sin curse and the blood of an
[45:48] animal could only cover or Capo put it
[45:50] over the top of it and your sin would go
[45:53] through and God would forgive
[45:54] you but your sin stayed there the sin
[45:58] person was still inside of you that's
[46:00] right so you had to go back to next year
[46:02] and do another one you had to go to back
[46:03] the next year you read that in the book
[46:05] of Hebrews brother Bob's already been
[46:06] through it because if it would just been
[46:07] the blood of bulls and goats you'd come
[46:09] up here one time a year throw your
[46:10] sacrifice down we'd kill it and you'd go
[46:11] back home
[46:13] right for some of y'all that would be
[46:18] easy but it's a
[46:20] continuous going behind the
[46:23] veil not depending on the preacher to do
[46:27] it or the
[46:29] deacons or the Sunday School teachers
[46:32] you got to go behind the bail you got to
[46:34] come boldly to the throne of grace you
[46:35] know why cuz you can back then it was
[46:37] death to walk in there there was no way
[46:39] you would be a complete idiot to even
[46:41] get close to that holy of holies it was
[46:44] so revered in only one person and he had
[46:47] to be completely covered by oil
[46:49] completely covered by the different
[46:50] colors that he was required to do or he
[46:53] died right the pomegranates and the
[46:56] as he walked holy holy they could hear
[46:58] him they said oh he's still alive he's
[47:01] good he's good and when he walked down
[47:03] and said hey your sins are forgiven for
[47:04] another
[47:05] year wow I don't want my sins forgiven
[47:09] for a
[47:10] year cuz I might live another one sister
[47:12] Regina and them babies are coming back I
[47:15] want that sin curse
[47:17] gone all right I I do believe in once
[47:20] saved always saved if you get the Holy
[47:23] Ghost you can't lose it that's right
[47:26] right amen we may fall we may stumble we
[47:29] may head backwards every once in a while
[47:32] hey it's like brother Ryan said get up
[47:35] and go don't quit don't quit now you
[47:40] take a young man maybe I'll just preach
[47:42] a little bit today you take a young man
[47:44] like brother Ryan now I've saw him how
[47:47] old you when we first
[47:48] met
[47:50] 17 good grief how old are you now9 39
[47:54] shut your mouth
[47:56] can got four young and a wonderful
[47:59] beautiful
[48:00] wife but when we first met
[48:06] Ryan he a little rough cuz he was so
[48:10] naive yeah that's right he was so naive
[48:14] yeah but he showed up
[48:17] everywhere he's like a gnat he was
[48:20] always there he's always there right you
[48:22] know you look there's Ryan you want to
[48:24] go to fellowship meeting yes yes I do
[48:26] there's right you want to go to this yes
[48:28] there's right you want to play the drums
[48:29] yeah I'm I'm good and then we go to
[48:31] those Fellowship meetings and bless his
[48:33] heart we had a van back then and he we'd
[48:35] get in go to brother Tom cranes and he
[48:37] would he' just have a sorry mouthful of
[48:40] puke and cuz he'd have to hold it back
[48:42] but he went right not like some of us is
[48:45] brother Bob said get a sniffle and a cat
[48:48] or cat get sick and stay home brother
[48:50] Ryan fought through that
[48:52] thing I mean we'd go down through that
[48:55] we I mean I mean it was 3 hours to
[48:56] brother Tom cran and all up through the
[48:58] mountains Highway 64 and Ryan was like
[49:02] but you know what he never
[49:04] complained actually didn't even realize
[49:06] it to one day I think he said something
[49:08] because he looked like a ghost he was
[49:10] white as a sheet but you know what he
[49:12] persevered he kept going he kept going
[49:15] he he kept going to camp meetings he
[49:16] kept or youth meetings and kept going to
[49:18] the camp meetings and met
[49:23] Gabby I couple at first
[49:26] may I cuz I knew them all I remember her
[49:29] testimony in 2006 I believe it was right
[49:33] at the meeting where she where she felt
[49:35] like committing
[49:41] suicide you have too
[49:44] right if you hadn't get ready cuz that
[49:47] Devil's still
[49:49] around I just read in the paper
[49:51] yesterday the suicide rate in the United
[49:52] States is up like 30%
[49:56] a lot of it is
[49:57] overdose but a lot of it people can't
[49:59] handle stuff cuz this world they don't
[50:02] know what this world is they don't know
[50:03] what tomorrow is they don't know what
[50:04] the next day is they don't know where
[50:05] they're going or they really don't know
[50:07] where they came
[50:08] from but you say oh now wait a minute
[50:10] that's not in the message cuz we know
[50:12] who we are
[50:15] baloney it's right here it's in this
[50:20] building but you got to fight it fight
[50:23] that thing listen God is a life what a
[50:26] life Giver not a life taker if somebody
[50:30] wants you to take your life it's the
[50:31] devil and he's got an end am God does
[50:34] not have an
[50:38] end that's what God said about us the
[50:41] Lord Jesus died on a cross for
[50:43] depression he died on the cross for
[50:46] people that want to commit suicide he
[50:48] died on the cross for all for adulterers
[50:50] and all that's what he died for he
[50:53] didn't die for the good people come on
[50:55] the good people hated him cus and all
[50:58] them they P God I ain't never done
[51:02] nothing wrong you know what you did you
[51:04] just turned down God that's what you did
[51:07] you didn't do anything wrong maybe in
[51:09] the out in the world but cuz you know
[51:11] people still depended on Kus even after
[51:13] Jesus went on out gone and they still
[51:15] depended on Kus to go in there once a
[51:18] year but that dispensation changed to a
[51:21] dispensation of a bride it went out of
[51:24] that church when he left he come back in
[51:26] a bride he didn't come back in that
[51:29] church that's why brother Brown says
[51:31] this will never be denominated this
[51:33] can't go back into a denomination like
[51:36] even Luther went into denomination
[51:38] Wesley into a denomination now you can't
[51:39] look at the Wesleyan Church now or look
[51:41] at the United Methodist some are United
[51:44] Methodist some are just
[51:45] Methodist because of the gay agenda and
[51:48] all these different things but you can't
[51:50] tell this one over here that they're
[51:51] still wrong
[51:53] too you can't do that that praise God
[51:56] that they come out of that junk but go
[51:59] higher that's where God is God's Not
[52:01] back there anymore he's here amen and
[52:04] he's here to fulfill your need because
[52:05] look Christ was the fullness of the
[52:07] godhead bodily all that Jehovah was Old
[52:10] Testament poured into Christ the New
[52:13] Testament yes and all that Christ was he
[52:15] poured into the church look not into one
[52:19] individual
[52:21] right but into the entire body yes sir
[52:25] there's where we come together in unity
[52:27] we have power that's why we're Lambs
[52:30] we're her animals we have power together
[52:34] if you ever get separated from your
[52:36] church or from the Believers you know
[52:38] that's not God and you know you're not
[52:40] going to win you will fail that devil
[52:43] will sink his teeth in you but all that
[52:46] God was was in Christ and all that
[52:48] Christ was is in
[52:52] you Christ Myster God revealed brother R
[52:54] said and then to bring that fullness of
[52:56] the godhead body into a people that he
[52:59] could have the preeminence the oversight
[53:01] the leading why does he want that he
[53:03] can't work in false Doctrine he can't
[53:06] work when we come to church and we're
[53:08] not we're not born again he's not going
[53:10] to can't use you you got to be born
[53:13] again you got to be in a family before
[53:15] you even be adopted oh yeah we can work
[53:18] yeah keep coming to church keep coming
[53:20] brother Luis your ago he'll tell
[53:22] you he went to a certain church for a
[53:24] long time message church when he come to
[53:27] this church he said I sat there and he
[53:29] said for three months I think brother
[53:31] Bob and brother Joe said just sit and
[53:34] listen cuz Brother D was he's he's rough
[53:38] sometimes and he's and he's he's a
[53:39] wonderful teacher but sometimes he gets
[53:40] up in the
[53:42] atmosphere but if you'll listen long
[53:44] enough why can't you realize the Holy
[53:46] Ghost Inside of You has got to bring you
[53:48] the truth of that what he's talking
[53:51] about right cuz he's not confused he's
[53:54] not the author of confusion amen amen
[53:57] but Lou said I sat there for about 3
[53:58] months he said all of a
[54:02] sudden things started falling together
[54:05] kind of like a Tetris game you know he
[54:08] said things went into place he said I
[54:09] started seeing things he said I realized
[54:11] I didn't have the Holy Ghost and he'
[54:14] been in another church and been
[54:16] preaching that's fine at least he
[54:18] realized he needed the new birth and he
[54:21] said he received it right here now he
[54:23] never came to the Altar and raised his
[54:24] hand up he it right where he was at
[54:26] ain't that the way we're supposed to do
[54:28] brother the Bible tells us that as the
[54:30] word went forth the Holy Ghost fell and
[54:31] people got the Holy Ghost amen sure it's
[54:34] good to come up here it's good to pray
[54:35] for the people now let's not do away
[54:37] with that but when we going to start
[54:39] accepting like a gentile yes Lord I'm an
[54:42] authority you're in Authority you just
[54:44] speak the word you don't have to go lay
[54:45] hand jarus is like come on in here lay
[54:47] lay your hands on me lay hands on my
[54:49] daughter L hands on
[54:52] my not not Gentile way right Gentile way
[54:56] is God whatever you say that's the way
[54:58] it's going to
[55:00] be so Christ mystery of God reveal said
[55:02] look now the complete fullness of the
[55:04] godhead body dwells in his church the
[55:05] premen is all that God was he poured
[55:07] into Christ all that Christ was he
[55:09] poured into the church the Believers
[55:11] look the Believers not the church the
[55:13] Believers all right what's his purpose
[55:16] now look Express himself as a son and
[55:19] now that in him might dwell the fullness
[55:20] of the godhead bodily talk about
[55:22] Colossians then look at the very end
[55:24] through this life of this
[55:27] son he's going to have a bride which is
[55:30] Eve the second Eve and that's me and you
[55:33] sitting here today Mighty God unveiled
[55:35] before us said then it was God in them
[55:38] days it was God and a man his son Jesus
[55:40] Jesus Christ we believe that not just a
[55:42] prophet not just an ordinary man not an
[55:45] ordinary human why because the spirit
[55:47] was God ours is
[55:50] not
[55:53] Hello ours is not we're heading there
[55:56] but our spirit is a spirit of man his
[55:58] Spirit was a spirit in Sun Times and
[55:59] divers marage spoke to the prophet the
[56:01] Holy Spirit that's why he was perfect
[56:03] that's why he didn't make mistakes when
[56:05] he spoke the word of
[56:07] God but now remember I'm going to read
[56:09] you a scripture here where it seems like
[56:12] he made some mistakes now as a human I
[56:13] believe he did I don't believe as a
[56:16] little child he just sat there and
[56:18] everything was good and he didn't throw
[56:20] his food in the floor and no uhuh no
[56:24] that's not the god that's I want that
[56:26] God to be so human that I understand him
[56:29] and he understands me all right so now
[56:31] it's God in men look God in a man now
[56:33] it's God in men the fullness of God and
[56:35] the God had bodily in his entire church
[56:37] manifest himself fulfilling his word now
[56:40] look so what is he talking about the
[56:42] fullness of the godhead B was in Jesus
[56:44] Christ all right let's stop right here
[56:45] just for a second
[56:47] pause pause for a second wake up punch
[56:53] yourself so the the fullness of godhead
[56:55] bodly was in Jesus Christ right he was
[56:58] the son of man right he made no mistakes
[57:01] in his Doctrine
[57:05] right but Luther had problems with his
[57:08] Doctrine Wesley had problems with theirs
[57:11] I'll read it to you in a minute where
[57:12] brother bar said you Pentecostals in
[57:14] other words you cabbage down on this
[57:15] gift part you didn't move on right right
[57:19] okay Baptist you had for a time you were
[57:22] good you had the truth
[57:25] but God moved and you didn't that's
[57:27] right right Jesus never said I do just
[57:31] about what the father
[57:33] says he says I only do that what the
[57:36] father says so that's the son of man
[57:38] that's God in human flesh being control
[57:40] that flesh being so controlled by God
[57:44] till it was God you said well that's
[57:47] impossible for me well you just stopped
[57:50] yourself CU says now it's God in men
[57:52] look the fullness of God he didn't say
[57:54] part
[57:55] amen because what we're going to look at
[57:57] in just a minute the reason we have to
[58:00] have these dispensations is is the Son
[58:04] of God dispensation did not require
[58:06] everybody to be the fullness of the
[58:08] godhead
[58:10] bodily there were
[58:13] flaws in their
[58:15] Doctrine listen I'm tell you one more
[58:18] time the son of man never preached a
[58:20] sermon that was
[58:23] wrong but now Luther did Wesley did
[58:26] Pentecost did they all did brother
[58:28] Brandon preached wrong until when till
[58:31] the seals open right oh boy people don't
[58:33] like that but he did he said he did he
[58:37] said I'd made a horrible mistake if ID
[58:39] have went back on my regular notes and
[58:41] preach the in other words he's going to
[58:42] preach a Wilder rider was the Holy
[58:45] Ghost he's the Antichrist but when the
[58:47] seals open so now you and I are working
[58:49] under that son of man dispensation
[58:51] that's why Luke 17:30 and all these
[58:52] different things said that son of man's
[58:54] got to come back in the end time to get
[58:56] in a group of people and not divide us
[58:59] that's right not divide Us by Doctrine
[59:03] but bring us together yes and it's only
[59:05] going to be a very short small group of
[59:08] people the fullness of the godhead
[59:10] fullness of God in the godhead bodily in
[59:12] his entire church manifest himself
[59:15] fulfilling his work now well we find now
[59:18] see God for all ages he had skin on it
[59:21] he's been veiled behind skin since the
[59:24] day of Pentecost
[59:25] 2,000 years ago but the fullness of the
[59:28] godhead bodily has not been required
[59:31] until now because remember he left as a
[59:33] son of man he left with that
[59:35] dispensation with him right right okay
[59:38] he was cut off that's what Jesus kept
[59:40] saying you're going to cut me off you're
[59:41] going to kill me and the disciples are
[59:43] going what are you talking about what do
[59:45] you mean you three days you tear this
[59:47] Temple down three days it took us 49
[59:49] years to build this Temple how you going
[59:50] to they weren't thinking they were
[59:52] thinking carnal he was speaking
[59:54] spiritual
[59:55] but I'll guarantee you on the day of
[59:56] Pentecost Peter James and John and all
[59:58] the different ones that were up there
[1:00:00] they understand a little bit what
[1:00:01] understood a little bit what God was
[1:00:02] talking about cuz remember he said you
[1:00:04] can't take this
[1:00:06] now but when I come back I'll lead you
[1:00:08] and guide you into all truth Peter after
[1:00:11] the day of Pentecost Peter didn't try to
[1:00:12] cut nobody's ear
[1:00:15] off he preached till their ears fell off
[1:00:17] but he he ain't cut by his ear
[1:00:20] off cuz he matured he
[1:00:23] grew all right so God is in skin but
[1:00:26] he's in skin
[1:00:28] now to be revealed yes as the son of man
[1:00:32] Jesus Christ on Earth we saw a little
[1:00:34] portion of it with brother brandom but
[1:00:35] you're going to see in the fullness in
[1:00:36] the bride all right cuz look Jesus was
[1:00:40] telling them he stood there one day and
[1:00:41] said the stone which the builders
[1:00:42] rejected he's talking about
[1:00:45] himself the Revelation the stone that
[1:00:48] the church was supposed to be built on
[1:00:50] was standing there in front of them and
[1:00:52] they rejected him yeah right so I'm
[1:00:56] going to now become the head of the
[1:00:58] corner I'm coming down as Zer rubbable
[1:01:01] and take the foundation and then I'm
[1:01:03] going to put the plumet to the line and
[1:01:05] I'm going to build this great Army back
[1:01:08] up again remember Joel says I'll get
[1:01:10] this great Army back four eat it four
[1:01:13] brings it back all right so why didn't
[1:01:15] just three bring it back though why
[1:01:16] didn't why it why isn't it just
[1:01:18] justification sanctification baptism the
[1:01:20] Holy Ghost why has it got to be number
[1:01:22] four which is the word back in power
[1:01:24] again
[1:01:25] all right the word's been in power in
[1:01:28] part we know in part we prophesy in part
[1:01:32] but that which is perfect has come that
[1:01:34] which is in part to be done away with
[1:01:36] now that doesn't mean done away with but
[1:01:37] that means hid away right that means hid
[1:01:40] away they were in another they're all in
[1:01:42] another dimension waiting on me and you
[1:01:44] to come to full maturity all right but
[1:01:47] the stone which the builders rejected
[1:01:48] which was him the same has become the
[1:01:51] head of the corner this is the Lord's
[1:01:52] doing it's marvelous therefore I say
[1:01:54] unto you the kingdom of God shall be
[1:01:55] taken from you in other words taken from
[1:01:57] the Jews we already been over this and
[1:01:58] given to a nation what a gentile bride
[1:02:01] yes that will bring forth those
[1:02:03] fruits all right then here's rising of
[1:02:06] sun there's been churches churches
[1:02:08] Brides churches Brides brides but
[1:02:10] there's got to come one there's got to
[1:02:12] come a real bride not that they were
[1:02:14] false but there's got to become one
[1:02:16] that's the son of man that's God in
[1:02:19] human flesh without error right you see
[1:02:24] can't do it no you can't but he
[1:02:26] can he can through you remember
[1:02:28] preeminence he's got to give you the
[1:02:31] preeminence he's got to have the
[1:02:32] preeminence in me and
[1:02:35] you Revelations 3:14 says to the angel
[1:02:38] of the Church of the layout of sins this
[1:02:40] is our age or the age we're living in
[1:02:42] the time period these things sayith the
[1:02:44] amen the faithful and true witness not
[1:02:46] that there was false Witnesses but watch
[1:02:49] this word true the beginning of the
[1:02:51] creation of God you read that one more
[1:02:53] time the beginning of the creation of
[1:02:55] God how can God have a beginning he had
[1:02:58] a beginning the way he wanted to be in
[1:03:00] Jesus Christ that's right which was God
[1:03:03] in flesh right now as being the
[1:03:07] beginning of the creation of God now why
[1:03:08] didn't he put that brother Mark why
[1:03:10] wasn't that in in the first church
[1:03:12] age why didn't God put that in the first
[1:03:15] church age no he goes over to the first
[1:03:18] church age we're going to cover the
[1:03:19] church ages maybe during the year Lord
[1:03:20] with
[1:03:21] him first church age right to get-go
[1:03:24] brother George right at the foundation
[1:03:26] part God said you bless your first love
[1:03:29] right you're not doing what you're
[1:03:31] supposed to do you got off the
[1:03:34] foundation I'll take your name out you
[1:03:37] just keep reading all the all the things
[1:03:39] but he comes up here to this last Church
[1:03:42] age he says the faithful and true
[1:03:44] witness the beginning of the creation of
[1:03:49] God how was God how did God want to be
[1:03:52] created he wanted to be in human flesh
[1:03:55] back into the Garden of Eden to produce
[1:03:58] me and
[1:03:59] you
[1:04:01] amen why do you wait till this church
[1:04:03] age to start that because it's the son
[1:04:05] of man Revelation coming back in power
[1:04:08] the beginning of the creation of God who
[1:04:09] was Jesus Christ he was the son of man
[1:04:12] when he was born he was a son of man the
[1:04:15] Son of God was inside of him but he was
[1:04:17] the son of man the fullness of the
[1:04:19] godhead
[1:04:20] bodily now look at this word true now
[1:04:23] this comes right from strong that word
[1:04:24] right there truth says that which has
[1:04:27] not only the name and resemblance watch
[1:04:28] now not only the name and resemblance
[1:04:31] but the real nature corresponding to the
[1:04:34] name brother rown say you can say one
[1:04:36] day they'll be they'll be where they say
[1:04:38] Jesus Jesus and not get
[1:04:39] anything why because they've made Satan
[1:04:43] Jesus come on that's what the Bible says
[1:04:46] Satan wants to be worshiped as God not
[1:04:49] like God as God sitting in the temple of
[1:04:53] who God showing him s that he is
[1:04:59] God but the real nature corresponding to
[1:05:01] the that name the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:05:04] me and
[1:05:05] you that's the real bride that's the
[1:05:09] true bride but the real nature
[1:05:11] corresponding to the name in every
[1:05:14] respect look corresponding to the idea
[1:05:17] signified by the name real true and
[1:05:19] genuine what did they do in the church
[1:05:22] ages we'll read it again The Book of
[1:05:24] Revelations what did they do they took
[1:05:26] another name they said you the Lord says
[1:05:28] you got a name you're living by but
[1:05:30] you're dead yes and it wasn't
[1:05:36] Satan it was Jesus Christ but they said
[1:05:38] you don't need a name let's just do
[1:05:39] these titles Father Son and Holy
[1:05:42] Ghost right that's why all that had to
[1:05:45] be restored in this age yes listen if
[1:05:48] this is boring you please go somewhere
[1:05:51] where you can get some excitement if

[1:07:03] Christ well I just told you for 20
[1:07:05] minutes where's he at now he's in his
[1:07:08] bride and he's quickening everything

[1:08:19] right let's start acting like
[1:08:21] royalty I don't stick in nose up in the
[1:08:25] air but be
[1:08:27] humble humble you know you look at those
[1:08:29] the the different rulers in
[1:08:32] kingdoms and and even like Queen
[1:08:34] Elizabeth and different ones they they
[1:08:35] weren't harsh rulers harsh rulers didn't

[1:08:41] the different ones they came to a very
[1:08:43] funny end they either took their own
[1:08:46] life or they were killed but you get
[1:08:48] somebody that will sit down with you and
[1:08:51] talk to you and not put that barrier you
[1:08:55] know from here to here same way with
[1:08:58] with all of us there's no big eyes and
[1:09:00] little you there's no there's no there's
[1:09:03] no great ones among us we we're all the
[1:09:05] same the only thing I believe I have is
[1:09:08] a gift to explain a little bit of what
[1:09:09] God's give us for y'all to get us to get
[1:09:13] and that's it that's
[1:09:16] all but there is part of our life that
[1:09:19] we have to give that but that's fine
[1:09:21] with me I don't I don't mind that one
[1:09:22] bit no cuz I want to see a mature
[1:09:26] wife whether I make it or not I want to
[1:09:29] see a mature wife I want to see God act
[1:09:33] in a church that's right absolutely in a
[1:09:35] people absolutely if it's not me that's
[1:09:37] okay but I want to see it now brother
[1:09:39] D's always said that remember he had the
[1:09:42] remember he had the vision the other the
[1:09:43] years and years ago about helping people
[1:09:45] up the
[1:09:46] mountain he didn't go right absolutely
[1:09:49] but he was helping people up the
[1:09:50] mountain up the mountain and put them in
[1:09:54] a
[1:09:55] what spaceship remember there was a
[1:09:58] spaceship and they were getting they
[1:10:00] were going up into that spaceship he was
[1:10:02] helping them get to the spaceship
[1:10:07] well we want to help each other get to
[1:10:10] that same spaceship cuz you know what
[1:10:12] that spaceship's going to do it's going
[1:10:14] to take us into another dimension it's
[1:10:16] not going to explode it's not going to
[1:10:18] take us to another country it's not
[1:10:20] going to take us to where there's trials
[1:10:21] and tribulations it's going to take us
[1:10:22] out of here it's going to take us into a
[1:10:25] wedding supper to where we can look at
[1:10:26] our lover and and say
[1:10:28] oh if you had come if you hadn't send us
[1:10:32] that Prophet we'd be as blind as the
[1:10:35] world is now we'd be blind you'd be
[1:10:39] walking at tomorrow you'd be going well
[1:10:41] what's going to happen the next day well
[1:10:43] what's going to happen the next day no
[1:10:45] we already got yesterday tomorrow's news
[1:10:48] yesterday's news we got all the news we
[1:10:50] know what's going to happen absolutely
[1:10:53] we know what's coming we know we are not
[1:10:55] going to go through the tribulation we
[1:10:57] know we are not going to stand
[1:10:59] judgment God ought to make a shout right
[1:11:03] there but being married I read this the
[1:11:07] other day and I want to read just a
[1:11:08] little bit more but cuz God give us a
[1:11:11] help meet not a helpmate all right
[1:11:12] somebody to help
[1:11:14] us so when you grow old who will take
[1:11:17] care of you for many that caretaker will
[1:11:19] be a spouse but does marriage actually
[1:11:21] improve life expectancy here's what
[1:11:22] research show
[1:11:24] marriage was one of the first
[1:11:25] non-biological now that means something
[1:11:28] you can't put medicine to biological is
[1:11:31] your biological self okay
[1:11:34] biology this is the first nonbiological
[1:11:38] factors identified as improving life
[1:11:42] expectancy it ain't a pill it ain't a
[1:11:45] shot it's being married now now listen
[1:11:49] this is typing us in Christ if you're
[1:11:53] not married and don't have a spouse
[1:11:55] Christ is your head right all right amen
[1:11:58] and if you stay married to him I'd
[1:12:00] rather be married to him than be married
[1:12:01] to June and where she's sitting there if
[1:12:04] I'm married to Christ me and her will be
[1:12:05] okay but if I'm not married to
[1:12:08] Christ K Barrow the
[1:12:11] door we talking about yesterday these
[1:12:14] people spend 25 and 30 and $40,000 on
[1:12:18] weddings 5 years later they're
[1:12:21] divorced all had to put that money
[1:12:24] up they could have divided it after 5
[1:12:26] years and had $20,000 a piece right if
[1:12:28] you want to look at it that way but I
[1:12:30] mean it's just a waste of money but
[1:12:32] that's the way but that's the way the
[1:12:33] world is oh it's okay we're going to
[1:12:34] have drive by drive by divorces anyway
[1:12:37] you go through the drivethru and say
[1:12:38] I'll take that one but that's not what
[1:12:40] God
[1:12:41] wants the explanation was given that
[1:12:44] married people tend to take fewer risks
[1:12:46] with their health and have better mental
[1:12:47] and emotional health hello somebody
[1:12:51] ain't that what happened when you get
[1:12:52] born again you don't do the things you
[1:12:54] used to do don't drink smoke cut and do
[1:12:55] all those things right you try to live a
[1:12:57] little better healthy and then your
[1:12:58] mental health and your emotional health
[1:13:02] if you're a Christian it's got to be
[1:13:04] better than the world it's got to be
[1:13:07] yeah marriage also provides more social
[1:13:10] and material support read your Bible
[1:13:13] steady pray to your lover which means
[1:13:16] having someone to take you to the doctor
[1:13:18] well I want somebody take me to the
[1:13:20] great physician do you amen amen you got
[1:13:22] a need today go to the great physician
[1:13:24] you ain't got to go to your regular
[1:13:25] doctor go to the great physician if you
[1:13:26] need to go to the regular doctor that's
[1:13:27] okay but they can't heal you they can
[1:13:29] give you a pill or give you a shot and
[1:13:30] they give you a Band-Aid but God just
[1:13:32] want to heal
[1:13:33] anyway someone to take care take you to
[1:13:35] the doctor and care for you when you're
[1:13:37] sick it can save your life married
[1:13:38] people live longer and healthier lives
[1:13:41] listen if you're not married to Christ
[1:13:43] you have a very short life
[1:13:46] expectancy but if you're married to
[1:13:48] Christ you can't even put a date on the
[1:13:50] end of it Hallelujah
[1:13:54] come on you can't put a date on the end
[1:13:56] of it the power of marriage is
[1:13:59] particularly evident in late middle age
[1:14:01] that's wait a minute late middle we're
[1:14:04] already past that most of us so
[1:14:06] anyway we look at mortality differences
[1:14:08] and it it's just I don't want to read
[1:14:10] the rest of that you just read it if you
[1:14:11] want to you just look it up on the line
[1:14:13] it's got to be true right
[1:14:15] Amy in fact I mean look this person's
[1:14:19] named I sing Lee okay he it's got to be
[1:14:22] a maybe AI who knows they compiled a
[1:14:25] catalog look being unmarried is one of
[1:14:27] the greatest risk that people
[1:14:28] voluntarily subject theel to I say Amen
[1:14:31] if you're not married to Christ you're
[1:14:32] married to the devil right and your risk
[1:14:36] is going to be much higher so true come
[1:14:40] on sick people who are married live
[1:14:42] longer than their unmarried counterparts
[1:14:44] amen Eternal versus
[1:14:47] not science of studied immune functions
[1:14:49] in the laboratory finds that happily
[1:14:51] married couples have better functioning
[1:14:54] immune systems wow Amy did you know
[1:14:57] that it's got to be true don't lie you
[1:15:01] look at
[1:15:03] up happy happily married couples have
[1:15:06] better functioning immune system
[1:15:07] divorced people even years after the
[1:15:09] divorce show much lower levels of immune
[1:15:13] functions
[1:15:15] wow don't worry I'm not preaching on
[1:15:17] marriage and
[1:15:20] divorce but listen there's many facts
[1:15:23] and I've all I've never said it from the
[1:15:25] pull pit but I'll say it today there are
[1:15:27] many factors when you talk about
[1:15:29] divorce it it's it's horrible to begin
[1:15:32] with God hates it okay the Bible tells
[1:15:37] you not to do it but some have done it
[1:15:40] anyway okay that doesn't Knock You Out
[1:15:42] of Heaven it just knocks you away from a
[1:15:45] mental battle right you you'll battle
[1:15:49] yourself the whole time but just being
[1:15:54] just being that one thing that you get a
[1:15:57] divorce and you have to live alone or
[1:15:59] then you pick a different spouse and
[1:16:00] it's not the right one come on I mean
[1:16:02] I'm talking about life
[1:16:03] here so let's get married to Christ
[1:16:06] first and make sure that person that
[1:16:08] you're looking at young people is
[1:16:10] married to Christ first when that person
[1:16:12] that person is married to Christ first
[1:16:14] I'll promise you you may have some
[1:16:16] issues come on but you'll live a lot
[1:16:18] longer life and you'll be a lot more
[1:16:20] happier right if you know Christ first
[1:16:23] so marry him first marry somebody that's
[1:16:25] married to Christ first when you do that
[1:16:28] listen you take the divorce Factor right
[1:16:30] out of the way okay all right so anyway
[1:16:33] I dropped that in and you didn't go out
[1:16:35] the door we're good all right so let's
[1:16:37] look just for a minute now we talk about
[1:16:39] this man the Lord Jesus we talk about
[1:16:40] the son of man this is God in human
[1:16:43] flesh all right this is almighty
[1:16:48] God all
[1:16:52] right and Jesus increased in wisdom and
[1:16:54] stature and favor with God and
[1:16:58] man brother John in his Humanity he had
[1:17:01] to grow in stature not statue that's
[1:17:04] stature all right now watch this right
[1:17:07] here HEB Bruce 5'8 though he were a son
[1:17:11] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:17:15] he
[1:17:17] suffered this is this is hold on this is
[1:17:20] almighty God this is the fullness of the
[1:17:23] godhead bodily this is a person that was
[1:17:25] born the way they were supposed to be
[1:17:26] born this is a person that has no carnal
[1:17:29] mind come on Amen this is the Lord
[1:17:32] himself this is God Almighty listen I do
[1:17:35] not believe for one moment he was a man
[1:17:38] and then he became
[1:17:39] God if he was a if he was a man we need
[1:17:43] to find that man that's
[1:17:46] right he was God Almighty the Bible said
[1:17:48] he was what Emmanuel born Emmanuel God
[1:17:51] With Us that's enough for me am
[1:17:53] that's right hallu he was born God but
[1:17:55] he was born a human all right God and
[1:17:57] man became one but though he were a son
[1:18:00] yet learned he obedience by the things
[1:18:05] which he suffered that's right look and
[1:18:07] being made
[1:18:10] [Music]
[1:18:11] perfect and being made
[1:18:14] perfect he became the author of Eternal
[1:18:17] salvation unto all them that obey him
[1:18:22] right
[1:18:23] this is the fullness of the godhead Bing
[1:18:25] all
[1:18:28] right let me skip over here real quick
[1:18:31] then we'll close right here don't look
[1:18:33] at that it's going to hurt you going to
[1:18:35] hurt your eyes get all the way down here
[1:18:36] at the bottom all right now
[1:18:39] look let's look at the dispensation now
[1:18:41] we're going to this afternoon we are
[1:18:43] going to talk about this interval so if
[1:18:44] you come back tomorrow this afternoon
[1:18:46] bring your Bible with you or I'm going
[1:18:48] to try to maybe run some scoffield does
[1:18:49] a good job of of breaking it apart so so
[1:18:53] you can see it I didn't have time to do
[1:18:55] it I mean it had
[1:18:57] been pages of scripture to show those
[1:19:00] intervals or show those gaps like 1 2 3
[1:19:03] 4 5 6 we'll talk about that this
[1:19:04] afternoon because it's very important
[1:19:06] it's very important that you look at
[1:19:08] that interval and what happens between
[1:19:10] that time because remember there's
[1:19:11] nothing not happen something's happening
[1:19:13] during that time all right like we said
[1:19:15] dispensation change we've had Church
[1:19:16] ages Church ages Church ages bride
[1:19:17] churches churches bride now there's one
[1:19:20] all right and now she's required to be
[1:19:22] the fullness of God body she's actually
[1:19:24] the one that brings the Gap together
[1:19:28] right what brings that Gap together the
[1:19:31] Holy Spirit yes but it's the holy spirit
[1:19:35] in full maturity not the Holy Spirit
[1:19:36] down here right all right we'll talk
[1:19:39] about it this
[1:19:41] afternoon now look why wasn't he
[1:19:44] recognized as the son of man the son of
[1:19:46] man was the spiritual revelation of
[1:19:48] prophet son of man means Prophet all
[1:19:51] right he talks about turn over in the
[1:19:53] Bible in Ezekiel the promised word of
[1:19:56] that hour being made manifest oh I'm
[1:19:58] sorry Jehovah called him a man the son
[1:20:00] of man the same as Jesus revealed
[1:20:02] himself as the son of man what was it
[1:20:04] the promised word look of that hour
[1:20:08] Jesus didn't come in Moses this
[1:20:10] time Jesus didn't come in Moses he
[1:20:12] didn't come with John's message but yet
[1:20:13] he and John were overlapping all right
[1:20:16] we'll get into that maybe later on
[1:20:18] too God of ezekiel's time God of Jesus's
[1:20:21] time son of man he was not at that time
[1:20:23] listen he was the son of man because he
[1:20:25] had come to reveal himself to Israel as
[1:20:28] a prophet and they rejected
[1:20:31] it remember they rejected The Headstone
[1:20:34] which is the son of man right all right
[1:20:37] they rejected him God said that's okay I
[1:20:40] don't care I'm going to start I'm going
[1:20:41] to have my church I'm going to come
[1:20:42] right back I'm going to build a
[1:20:44] foundation and that was the prophecy
[1:20:47] that they should receive in him in in
[1:20:49] the name of the son of man a prophet
[1:20:51] because it was according to the word
[1:20:52] Deuteronomy 18:15 Lord your God shall
[1:20:54] raise up a prophet like an unto me and
[1:20:57] when he come he identified himself look
[1:21:00] he never called himself the Son of God
[1:21:01] they called him a Son of God he said you
[1:21:03] say cuz he identified
[1:21:06] himself he identified himself in his
[1:21:08] ministry as a man not a son of God Son
[1:21:11] of Man God is a spirit and he revealed
[1:21:14] himself as son of man what he claimed to
[1:21:17] be and they were blinded and couldn't
[1:21:19] see it all right but now unto to the
[1:21:23] Gentiles he reveals himself and now the
[1:21:25] Son of God which is the Holy Ghost now
[1:21:28] look that's the dispensation holy ghost
[1:21:31] in in the church ages all right now
[1:21:33] Jesus said as it was in the days of
[1:21:34] Sodom now I didn't put the rest of that
[1:21:36] quote but remember what happens the son
[1:21:37] of man's to be revealed again all right
[1:21:40] proving his word when he was on Earth he
[1:21:43] was the son of man he could not be the
[1:21:44] Son of God he never claimed to be he was
[1:21:47] the son of man all right now you keep
[1:21:49] going a little bit further the message
[1:21:51] of the hour cannot come through theology
[1:21:53] he's talking about the message he's
[1:21:54] bringing not Son of God there he had to
[1:21:57] be the son of man now
[1:21:59] watch then he served his office as son
[1:22:02] of man then he serves his office now as
[1:22:05] a Son of God see brother randam is
[1:22:07] standing preaching in the Son of God
[1:22:10] dispensation but he's the only one that
[1:22:13] knows about the son of man dispensation
[1:22:15] right he was the Gap just like John
[1:22:18] stood and introduced Jesus brother R
[1:22:20] stood in the Gap and introduced Jesus
[1:22:22] right to the world all right then he
[1:22:25] served his office now as Son of God God
[1:22:27] is a spirit and when now he served
[1:22:28] through the church ages as the Son of
[1:22:30] God now the Millennium he be son of
[1:22:33] David we know that goes to the Jews but
[1:22:34] there's a time period that you're in
[1:22:36] right now that you're in the son of man
[1:22:40] dispensation God's got to come back and
[1:22:42] cap that put that cap back on that
[1:22:44] pyramid that's the reason he cannot be
[1:22:46] the Son of God now
[1:22:47] watch this will prove something and then
[1:22:49] we'll then we'll pause for this
[1:22:51] afternoon that's the reason he could not
[1:22:54] be the Son of God there what where he
[1:22:57] was standing on Earth because he was the
[1:22:59] son of man the word comes to the prophet
[1:23:03] and he was the word in its fullness
[1:23:05] watch son of man the major prophet not
[1:23:08] the major prophet but God Prophet now
[1:23:10] watch the fullness of the godhead bodily
[1:23:13] was in him therefore or in other words
[1:23:16] that made him the son of man that's why
[1:23:19] the son of man can't come back in power
[1:23:21] until the end time when the fullness of
[1:23:23] the godhead B is being revealed which is
[1:23:25] the son of man that's what makes us the
[1:23:27] son of man as a collective body not me
[1:23:29] not brother brandham he was a son of man
[1:23:31] revealing the son of man but there's
[1:23:32] your
[1:23:35] characteristic Son of God
[1:23:37] dispensation is not the fullness of the
[1:23:39] godhead
[1:23:41] ble it's God and his bride trying to get
[1:23:44] them to see things they have these
[1:23:47] um doctrines that got to deal with but
[1:23:50] the son of man never had a doctrine that
[1:23:52] was
[1:23:53] wrong right when he left this Earth that
[1:23:56] day 2,000 years ago when he went up he
[1:23:58] can he could look back and say I never
[1:24:00] preached a false Doctrine right and how
[1:24:03] many can say that here well we're
[1:24:05] supposed to be able to do that coming up
[1:24:07] right here for 2,000 years he's been
[1:24:10] known as the Son of God Luke 17:30 says
[1:24:13] even thus shall it be in the day the day
[1:24:15] not one day the day we're in the day of
[1:24:17] the Lord like John was on aisle of pmas
[1:24:20] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:24:22] the son of man is what
[1:24:23] revealed he's here already he's here in
[1:24:26] his church but he's got to be revealed
[1:24:29] Matthew 17 verse1 and after six days
[1:24:35] well after six days so they're in the
[1:24:37] seventh day Jesus Took Peter James and
[1:24:39] John bring them to a high mountain and
[1:24:41] was transfigured before him now we know
[1:24:43] that was the hear you himm part I'm kind
[1:24:44] of skipping through this a little bit
[1:24:46] because it's 11:50 and his face did
[1:24:48] shine as the sun and his reignment was
[1:24:50] white as the light and behold there
[1:24:51] appeared on him Moses and Elijah talking
[1:24:54] with him now Moses and Elijah listen
[1:24:57] Moses and Elijah appearing to
[1:25:00] him everybody with
[1:25:02] me that's a Jewish dis dispensation not
[1:25:06] ours all
[1:25:08] right so they came to him to to talk to
[1:25:11] him about brother Ram said about the
[1:25:13] future right because who is the two
[1:25:16] prophets that's going to
[1:25:20] take the Revelation over there that's
[1:25:23] right it's not going to be the son of
[1:25:24] man Revelation though we get the son of
[1:25:27] man Revelation that we do just like he
[1:25:28] did we go up in the cloud that's right
[1:25:30] okay everybody with me answered Peter
[1:25:33] and said oh it's good to be here listen
[1:25:34] Peter starts interjecting his own
[1:25:36] Doctrine we're going to build three
[1:25:38] Tabernacles Jesus said
[1:25:43] sh cuz look says while he yet spake
[1:25:46] something stopped him and said
[1:25:49] hey Behold a voice out of the cloud
[1:25:52] which says this is my beloved Son and
[1:25:53] whom I pleased well pleased hear you him
[1:25:56] look and when the disciples heard it
[1:25:57] they fell on their face and were sore
[1:25:58] afraid now here's Jesus Moses and Elijah
[1:26:01] have gone because they're going to the
[1:26:02] Jews and he's going in that dispensation
[1:26:04] so he's standing there with his bride
[1:26:08] for the moment they weren't bride yet
[1:26:09] because they had went to the went to the
[1:26:11] upper room but they were potentially
[1:26:13] bride all right and when they had lifted
[1:26:15] up their eyes they saw Jesus by himself
[1:26:18] now watch and when they came down from
[1:26:20] the mountain here's what I want you to
[1:26:21] see we stand to your feet Jesus charged
[1:26:24] them saying Jesus said
[1:26:26] hey we got a scene going on
[1:26:29] here I've been I've been looking about
[1:26:31] actors and scenes and different things
[1:26:33] and five parts of a drama and all that
[1:26:36] stuff I want to re I want to re um I
[1:26:38] want to re-enter that where um U Brother
[1:26:41] Richard Douglas did about a year or so
[1:26:43] ago because brother R talks about when
[1:26:46] he when the seals open it was actors in
[1:26:47] a play it was a play going on and they
[1:26:50] were acting apart all right and as as
[1:26:52] they came down from the mountain Jesus
[1:26:53] charged him saying look tell this Vision
[1:26:55] to no
[1:26:57] man until the son of man be risen again
[1:27:01] from the
[1:27:03] dead now why' he say
[1:27:06] again he should have just said now
[1:27:08] listen tell the vision of no man until
[1:27:10] the son of man be risen from the
[1:27:12] dead cuz he died 6 months after this
[1:27:16] right here he died he physically died
[1:27:18] they put him in a tomb and he came back
[1:27:20] right right he says come back again
[1:27:23] risen
[1:27:24] again well you're in the rising part
[1:27:27] right now you're in the second coming of
[1:27:31] the son of man he was there one time
[1:27:32] he's come back here tell the vision of
[1:27:34] no man till the son of man be risen
[1:27:36] again from the dead now what brother R
[1:27:38] tell us he told us he said he was in
[1:27:41] there and they killed him right the
[1:27:44] denominations he had to come out of the
[1:27:45] denominations put them away and marry a
[1:27:48] new bride right which is us so the son
[1:27:50] of man has now be risen again again he's
[1:27:52] now being risen the second time in his
[1:27:55] church in his bride in his people in the
[1:27:57] fullness of the godhead
[1:27:59] bodily but we're waiting for the
[1:28:01] adoption yes to with the
[1:28:04] Redemption of our body we are now in the
[1:28:07] dispensation of the son of man and
[1:28:10] listen folks I'm going to say this
[1:28:12] lightly
[1:28:14] God's
[1:28:16] waiting is about
[1:28:18] over God's waiting on us being frivolous
[1:28:21] and not and not doing what we're
[1:28:23] supposed to do me
[1:28:24] included is about over we either got to
[1:28:27] tow the line we got to come to the
[1:28:29] plummet we've got to come into that
[1:28:31] line or we don't make
[1:28:35] it that's just I'm sorry the
[1:28:38] dispensation had to
[1:28:40] move and listen now hold on a minute
[1:28:43] when God moves if we don't move what
[1:28:44] happens we become a denomination that's
[1:28:48] right you say in this message no they
[1:28:51] can't make it a denomination where they
[1:28:52] said this is brandom uh United brandom
[1:28:56] Church no or United Methodist Church but
[1:28:59] they've made it
[1:29:01] that CU they've not took the furtherance
[1:29:03] of the word they've not took all the
[1:29:04] word they just take the part they want
[1:29:06] yeah in the message and we may have some
[1:29:09] faults too but I believe that that that
[1:29:12] if you'll go back and start listening to
[1:29:13] brother Dale different different ones
[1:29:15] from this
[1:29:16] church pretty much on the Mark if it
[1:29:19] didn't I wouldn't be here I'd go find
[1:29:20] like Brother D said if you can find
[1:29:21] something better go find it he said but
[1:29:23] don't leave me here take me with you
[1:29:25] right cuz we're searching for that we're
[1:29:27] searching for the word of God we're
[1:29:29] searching for for the truth you say well
[1:29:31] I'm sitting in truth I'm talking about
[1:29:33] the faithful and true witness the one
[1:29:35] that when that message sounds you say
[1:29:37] that ain't nothing but the truth or you
[1:29:40] don't sit there and go I don't know if
[1:29:42] that's true or not well you better get
[1:29:43] to praying better get to praying better
[1:29:45] get reading your Bible better get study
[1:29:46] in the message and catch up cuz this
[1:29:49] true and we got to come to this adoption
[1:29:52] before we come to the Redemption of the
[1:29:53] body the son of man Ministry is here the
[1:29:56] son of man dispensation the son of man
