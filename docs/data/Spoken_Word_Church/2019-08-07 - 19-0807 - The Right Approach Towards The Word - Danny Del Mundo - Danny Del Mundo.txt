========================================

happy to not let you face know it and say thank you Lord all the things they men remember all of the sick among us Lord would be with each one pray that you'd bless and just remember this coming weekend now brother Quinn will be with us to minister so remember that and keep all of that in your mind and Alton we're glad to hear from these brothers from the foreign fields and things and we pray that God will bless them and so let's just sing open the eyes of my heart is brother Danny del mundo from the Philippines comes to speak the word of the Lord unto us tonight oh my oh my heart Oh I want to say I want to see opening the eyes of my heart open the eyes of my heart I want to see to see to see [Music] joining in the [Music] pour out your power as we say [Music] hi [Music] shining in the light of your glory pour out your power as we say holy we heard holy holy holy [Music] Oh holy holy I want to see praise the Lord the Bible said blessed are those who are humble for they shall see God amen so that's the only way where we can see him and that's to humble ourselves before him probably that's the that's the thought where we are going tonight amen I can say goodbye all right so you see let's go straight to the reading of the word tonight amen in Psalms chapter 65 let's read verse 4 it says here this very familiar Scripture blessed is the man whom thou chooses and causes to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of the house even of thy holy temple amen let's bow our heads in prayer dear Heavenly Father we thank you for your mercy we thank you for your blood and tonight we certainly appreciate your presence because that's the only way where we can meet you and once again Lord bless this church this congregation bless but Sam well Lord God is family and it's ministry and all the people that are standing with him to propagate this endtime gospel we thank you and we give you all the glory and honor in Jesus Christ wonderful name amen praise the Lord God bless you you may be seated amen praise the Lord I would like to greet you once again in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ it's good to be back here and really appreciate by the samwell for always giving me the opportunity when there's when there's opportunity amen and good to see my friend by the way better Luis and his family glad to see them also I saw brother John amen so god bless you and we're just doing good by God's grace amen a lot of things are really going on on the other side amen but praise God we we we cannot do anything without him and we really will really appreciate your your prayers and let it letting us feel that you are behind us to push on and press on with this ministry amen so back there in the Philippines there's still a lot of things going on in various islands and also we have the opportunity to be able to witness and propagate this gospel to the other parts of Southeast Asia and there are some and many developments that are actually going on particularly in in Myanmar before I have mentioned to you and I will keep on mentioning because the Lord has been so good because since I started going to Myanmar in in 2005 if I'm not mistaken it is quite different today because at that time they were still under the military junta where you know there are there were soldiers everywhere and the moment you step into the airport to the immigration they will check your itinerary and they will really check you on the hotels that you have indicated as you enter so but today things have changed because now their economy is also moving forward a lot of things are going on they see a lot of action going on and I believe it is God's Way of doing these things so that the gospel will be you know we don't have much time to propagate this endtime gospel and so probably way back in 2012 I was praying because every time we go there we we oftentimes see the same the same people the same the same ministers and the Lord has placed in my heart a great burden and I was praying Lord you know if if you are pleased with what I'm doing here in in Myanmar I pray that you give me more new open doors and new and younger translators where you know we can we can travel around and in so short a time since probably two years ago the Lord has opened up new doors and now we have started a work I sent you some reports on that and so there's a place which is called PA province seven hours from Yangon and it's really fresh it is message from the ground it's now a group who have come out of the denomination and we baptize the the pastor his family and probably close to 30 of his congregation have been baptized one of them one of them one of them was a Buddhist nun who's been in the Buddhist only then I knew there were nuns also in the Buddhist in this Buddhist Nana an old woman and he or she she heard about this faith and she got baptized and there was a there was a man behind now before the start of the service they were singing and the the pastor was saying something I just took a picture in front and I was able to take a picture up to the background and I never noticed that and then when [Music] the following day there were 12 people who decided to be baptized and one of the one of the brothers or one of the men that the pastor testified his brother is he owned that that's his that that his name and he testified that one of the brothers that got baptized was also a Buddhist faithful and he just happened to pass by and he was standing at the back if I have opportunity I can show you the picture he was standing at the back and I was able to locate him in the picture that I took the day before and he was he had no clothes you know the this this Buddhist you know they just have this kind of garment you know and he asked the pastor he said I like what I heard and I want to attend tomorrow again because I conducted three days message presentation to them and he said I want to go back tomorrow but I don't have proper you know proper clothing whatsoever and the pastor gave him okay you just go and then on the same day when he went when we talked about the baptism in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he was among the Brethren that had been proposed to so it's it's a wonderful thing that in that area this is a small group but by God's grace it is hard to avail piece of property there because it is a Buddhist dominated community but by God's grace and provision we were able to purchase a piece of property and Lord willing amen depending on God's provision I believe that the Lord continued to to see the need and all these things and I believe one of these days a church building will be put up in that and you know it is something that they say it's something close to impossible because it's a beauty sweetest community and to be able to purchase at least we have already overcome the to say it's closed now we will realize it's not impossible it's nothing is impossible with God so if the Lord provided for a piece of property amen he's more than able to provide a church building in that area and that is that is my prayer and so also we're doing the mission works in Japan now and I'm working closely with with the brothers probably two years ago brother Craig boomer and but the Tim Pruett approached me because they were doing missionary works in Gifu which is probably six to eight hours six or eight hours by train in Gifu and there were few source that they were visiting there and when we when I met them I told them where there is there is much action going on in Tokyo and the you know and they say if we can go together and put our efforts together then we will be able to accomplish more and so at one time we traveled there together January of the other year so brother Craig by the Timothy prove it and another brother but the George winters we went there together and we we got there all the believers some of them Chinese believers who moved into Japan and there are now residents of Japan and then this new believers I baptized in my purse trip the Lord has given me two souls a mother and not that the doctor in the Social Doctrine but the mother and her son which are pure Japanese and they got baptized and then when we were together there there is a couple the name the name of the the woman was Ruth and she's married to a Dutch that's brother and they used to be missionaries in in Japan they go to they go to Ghana and they even went to the Philippines before but when we when we met them they testified that they were looking for things because they have come out of the denomination already and when they come out of the denomination because they said we become so tired of these things that are going on and we found out you know that the Lord is dealing with us and so they were already at home gathering few people and testifying about the goodness of the Lord so they came out of the denomination even before we met them but at that same day brother Timothy but the Craig and brother George were living but I will be leaving home back to the Philippines the following day and so we just discussed something and I believe on the we took breakfast together before they went to the brothers went to the airport and then in the process of our conversation they you know to cut the story short the cat excited and they said well we are running out of time but if brother Danny will still spend you know I mentioned part of this last year if it brother Danny has time can we still sit down with you and so we had we had it in in the small room in where I where I was staying amen and then the continuation of that story they got excited about this message and when we discuss about the love dision age the sister said you mean Jesus Christ is already outside the church when we talk about love the same church well that's what the Bible is saying you know and said oh my she the woman testified and since the oh my I thought we were just trying to be different now we know that the Lord is really leading us and we believe that there is more entry into it so that was the first time that we met and then recently when we had the the continuation and we have already introduced them the Prophet and they have accepted brother Branham as the Prophet so I believe this is already a good good sign amen you know Japan is so different Japan is so different they're so close and it's really hard to to talk to them amen but I know the Lord has has been stupid and so but the Vernon has a sister in his church in his congregation that was married to a Japanese and so we are arranging a trip together because now the the Japanese is quite old and their children have been brought into the Japan already and the sister previously was hesitant to go to move to Japan because there was no message and so brother Vernon said we're doing a work there and so now the whole family is already in Japan so Lord willing brother Vernon and myself will be going there together and start in their family you know so you just include that in your prayers amen and also if you heard something about the lost believers they were there under challenge now because previously they were being attacked because one of the pastors who got baptized and received this message the denomination are so influential in this communist country and still it's still illegal you know unless you are identified with the churches that are recognized by the government you cannot preach so when this brother when this brothers were baptized they were being pressured by the authorities because the denominations have so much influence in in the government because now they become illegal because they came out of those recognized organization and it is not the authorities are being forced and they were being placed in such a position that they had to present they were being questioned and so why do you have to baptize in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ while they are baptizing in the name of the Father Son and the Holy Spirit the status and these people who are mediating or judging them were communists they don't know about the Bible you know then they said and then this this brethren just stood and said well we just they were the ones who led us to believe in the Bible and we recognize that but the Bible that that that we believe and they were the ones introduce us to the Bible now we found out that this Bible teets that people must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then they pointed that to the scripture and this judges were looking at the scriptures and said yeah that's right that's right it is it it is in your Bible it is in your Bible so so in the initial investigation it looks like they gained some some kind of advancement in though you know in this thing it looks like they were you know so that's the good point of beer and but lately we've got a got another news that you know it looks like something have happened and the authorities are turning their backs on what they have declared previously and so again we're asking your prayers for this laus believers I believe it's they are having a hard time the denominations are giving so much pressure and then through the authorities because they are not recognized but one of the Authority said well what you have to do Amen is if you have if you have like you know seven groups or five groups you know and then you can apply for your own you know organization and then if the government will recognize you then you will not have a problem okay well so I believe you know that that that that that thing will you know we will come out later but at this point in time nothing is happening it except the pressures on our brethren so we cannot go to to the Laos area but what we normally do there is a place in Thailand which is called the triangle where in that place you have tile and you have Cambodia and you the your blouse so the last people in the Cambodian believers they just cross to Thailand and we rent a place in a hotel and that we do the Bible studies and so in that way we have no problem when we rather than crossing Laos which is quite quite hard so everything is in the hand of the Lord these are actually open doors Indonesia is moving forward they are doing mission works on their own as I mentioned to you there were only three churches when they came there in 2003 and but now we have more than you know more than probably two dozens or close to 30 churches in Indonesia that are spreading this message except those works in in the home so last year I was able to help another two trips in Indonesia but I am inclined in spending more time in Myanmar now as they need more some encourage so with all your prayers and by the way but the burnin when he knew that I was going to man Mar he shared part of the mission fund and brother Brandon is doing a good job amen and so in that way you were part of that missionary okay so god bless you and let's let's go back to the preaching of the word amen so at this point I just want to talk a about a simple subject which is the right approach towards the Word of God amen so everything I believe there is always a an approach just like being mentioned here in some chapter 65 he said blessed is the man whom thou chooses and cause us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be sweet I'll be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy holy temple amen so I like what what brother Branham said he said you know there is always a right approach in everything let me put it this way as brother Branham said you see remember Jesus when he was here on earth talking to a bunch of people who was very religious very fine very cultured a very zealous people of God but jesus said to them in vain you worship Me teaching for doctrines the traditions of men remember how I used this those people where and how zealous of God I believe if we were counting the people who were more zealous of today or that day they would be more zealous than we are far more when it comes to keeping the traditions and laws and things they live by those and they were very serious of God and they believed God but Jesus God made flesh among I said in vain do you worship me now he didn't say they didn't worship him they were worshipping him but in vain amen so again we go back to the book of Genesis and we we find two men there both of them who worship God amen and I believe when we when we categorized them in in sincerity in the way they want to please God amen both of them were sincere but you know as a prophet of God said we can be sincere people can be sincere and yet sincerely wrong and that was proven in that in that occasion Cain was sincere amen he he offered the best of his harvest he offered the first fruit of his harvest I believe Amen because but but we notice that that the only difference is Abel's approach he approached the worship we approach God in the right manner he approached God in the right way amen so and said now far more when it comes to keeping the traditions and laws they lived up by those and they were very serious of God and they believed God but Jesus God made flesh among I said in vain do you worship Me now he didn't say they didn't worship Him they were worshipping him but in vain now below he said worship in the place that I have chosen even he coated the scripture but I'm not going to read at the same time now chosen what he said in display shows that he has a place where all people worship other places are in vain and in this same place he said I have chosen also to put my name in this place I'll choose a place and I'll put my name in it and in this place that is going to worship now this shows that there is one place just one it must be God's choosing it can be ours we have no choice coming he's already chosen it now what God chooses is right amen I can choose wrong you can choose wrong but God cannot choose right after all he is the one that being worshipped and he's got the place where he wants his worshipers to meet there and we must meet him there that's the only place that he stays only place that he will hear you from even and I like that so blessed is the man whom thou choices so there are two things that I see here God choose a place where he put his name and also even in the book of sign he said he also choose men to approach him now this is something hard to the people but this is something scriptural I mean meaning there are people who approach him but but their worship are in vain amen but we're so glad we have message of the hour Amen that provided us a ways away and means to be able to approach him a man in the right way and in the right place amen and he's the one doing this and Barb Adam said it is God's choosing alright and so he's saying God's choosing and God you know he has he has a pattern to approach him and so the vindicated prophet has us has preached to us the three stages of grace and were very much familiar with that and this is God's choosing even so we approach him and we should recognize his way we have recognized his pattern and that's why we are being justified by faith were being justified and you know when we are being justified we have not done anything yet it is it is all his doing when we approach him and when were being just if I do know it's him who picked us we were we were unworthy we were undeserving we are disqualified amen but because amen it is his own way it is his own choosing a man he was able to provide the way for us amen and by his own choosing he we were able to see the message of justification amen the judge shall live by faith and then and and and that's why I said you know in in the first stage of of grace which is justification we have not done anything else it's all His grace remember I'm justified you know justified means you are being counted as perfect we're not yet perfect but we're just being justified we're just being counted as perfect amen because instead of looking to our condition instead of looking to our needs instead of looking to our shortcomings Amen brother Branham said through his blood amen and only his blood can justify us it's not any any form of religion any any goodness that we do amen any act that we do a - nothing to do with it is all by His grace and there is no other way amen and so in this day and age we believe you know the people they go to the church they go to the denomination they become part a man they become members of all this organization amen but they cannot approach God in the way God wants it to be because the right approach is always to recognize the sacrifice just like in the Old Testament you know in in the tabernacle you know you have to pass through the altar and you have to to kill the the sacrifice and you have to honor that Amen there's no other way amen also unless a man recognized the sacrifice and you cannot recognize the sacrifice without recognize God God's vindicated prophet so before they left before they left Egypt talking about Israel they had to recognize their to listen to their prophet amen because God spoke to that prophet that they had to choose a land Amen that every every help the family should should kill the land and and they have to eat in heyse all right but you know we know that not all the homes not all the houses at the time killed lamb and so unless the Angel of Death can pass through the doors and see that blood being applied you know it will not pass over them and so that's what you know the Prophet was saying and he was illustrating you know there was a there was a son who was who kept on asking father father can help you have you killed have you listened to the Prophet because he was so nervous because he heard the cries of the mothers in there in the neighborhood and said that's that's the that's the cry of my friend's mother so that the boy a man could have thought or maybe his father did not listen to the Prophet and so the my friend was the first one in the family in a and and his mother was crying so the boy was so nervous amen but you see the father said women said now look at the table amen there's our land amen look at the doors that's the blood down there amen and so you see all this thing Ament because they listen to the prophet and the Prophet pointed them to the right sacrifice hallelujah and so they were they were spared amen and all those who obeyed the prophet in the day amen continued to live and they were able to come out of Egypt all right so it's the same thing today without recognizing the vindicated prophet of God you will not be able to recognize the message of the hour because the sacrifice Amen is none other than the word that is being broken and then it's the same thing that the Lamb that was being shared to the family and then being killed by the father and being being shared to the family and then and it come from Abe indicated prophet of God so that's why you see outside of the message of the hour there's no hope of the rapture they can talk about the rapture they can wait for the rapture wherever they are they can talk about it amenda but there's no reality in that unless they accept the message of the hour amen you can just talk about it you can people can just wait for the reckoning amen but it will not it will not be realized and we're sorry for them but you see but that's but that's the truth amen and so unless you know so that's why the message of the hour has the only power to justify a man Amen that a sinner can pass through Amen because this is the only mention we will be able to identify ourselves to the sacrifice amen in the day and age that we are living in hallelujah and so through that justification we can move forward and come to the sanctification you know there were people who are better who has better lives than us amen you cannot put finger in their lives amen they can they can dig in they can do good works all right you know you see people a lot of Christian foundations a lot of good things that they're doing all over the world and you can really appreciate what they're doing amen but unless you you do something where the message of the hour the word per today is the foundation yeah it will help it can excite people you know but unless it is according to the Word of God in this day amen it will always go in vain that's what Jesus said in vain do they worship me because it's the doctrine I mean it's the word amen so you see and then we move on and then and then and we're talking over the breakfast table this morning and you see just like there is a difference between accepting God as your personal Savior accepting him as your Lord amen but there is another side of it amen and we must be accepted by him and our fate can only be accepted ayman to the Holy Ghost amen because that is God's provided way and so he and this is the only this is the way this is the way to approach him we must go amen to justification sanctification and baptism of the holy ghost this is the only way amen and so what do you expect amen from an organization it's no way to be justified and we do not claim exclusive salvation there are many there are many means to be to be saved amen you know there are people behind him said there are people who do good things to the bride and you know in the end eventually they may be able to receive benefits from it and they will be surprised amen so we do not witness but we're talking about the body change we're talking about the rapture here we're talking about sitting beside him in his throne and that's we are after hallelujah and so it only goes to the approach amen and in this approach God builds a standard that we should meet him amen and and you see the the message tells us that you know there is a certain condition that we must meet him and that's why we have the stature of a perfect man and I believe this is God's standard in this day even because these are all the potentials these are all the characteristics and and this is not our faith this is not our own temperance this is his nature amen that's why we are we are partakers were partakers of the divine nature amen and so to be able to meet God's standard Amen we must be able to sit on on his provided table the provided food in this day and we must partake amen and so that's why I see by partaking of his word we are partaking of this nature we're partaking of his divine nature amen we are we by His grace he's building up his own characteristics in us him building himself amen so that even he may be able to to mirror himself through our nature to characteristics through our lives that we will be able to manifest not our lives not our organization and not our church life but his life payment will be must be displayed in this declaration that we are living in and we can only do that by partaking on his word because whatever we eat amen it becomes amen it becomes us amen and when we partake of this word we become the word hallelujah that we can he can see himself in us him and he can see himself in as he can he can mold us and at times all these characteristics you know can can only come you know by trials and persecutions and testings and you know temptations that we that we overcome hallelujah amen and so I remember job one said you know let me call it he said for I know he know the way that I take even God knows everything in us Amen in all the trials you know that God that comes along with it God knows everything and then you know God is the author and finisher of our faith he's the beginning and the ending is the Alpha and the Omega amen so that's why because he's the beginning at the end he shows us the beginning he shows us the end but the same thing he does not show us in between that's why people are you know people sometimes are surprised why these things are happening to me I'm a believer I'm standing for the truth how come these things are coming in amen I never expected it you know that statement is not new to all of us I never expected it because of the hardships that were going through because of the trials that were going through Amen parents the trails that they're going through with their children you know and sometimes the other way around you know and and pastors you know you know all these things we come through things that we never expected amen but but by God's grace because we knew Amen we knew where we come from and we know where we are heading for a man we've got the kind of revelation hallelujah so when when God when God sent Moses to Israel amen they were they knew the promise Joseph died believing that there is a deliverer that must come and he said when he comes dig my bones amen and bring it to the promised land so he died believing amen from the beginning of his life when he when he began to understood and to understand God's Word and when he was expecting for a deliverer amen and he never fade from that kind of condition so he died believing amen and so because he died believing God fulfilled his word because he heard the cry of his people and and he sent he said he sent a prophet you know and then and they were expecting you know you're living in a place in the land you know filled with milk and honey everything was good amen but he never showed they're going to pass through the wilderness never they never had any idea that they have to cross the Red Sea amen they had to pass through Kadesh Barnea amen they suffered a lot because God told them the beginning and the end amen and so this is our greatest comfort that whenever wherever we are whatever condition we have we know amen and so with these things any problem that comes away any struggle that comes our way we know how to approach it amen and we say things you know that's why the words are becoming a reality to us all things work together for good amen to them that love God so all these things you know God has a standard that we should meet him and when when Jesus said you know be perfect even as your father in heaven is perfect amen of course we understand that it's not our own perfection it's his perfection him and just like when Moses was standing in that holy ground it was God who said you know he that identified that that place was a holy place he was standing on a whole he was standing on a holy ground but it's the same mountain all throughout amen but what change the condition was the presence of God amen and and and so Moses because of the presence of God he had to approach him Amen he had to approach it because there is the presence of the Lord so you see in the message watered from the rap he said if you just know the right approach to it you could walk right up and receive it just like that that's all because it got promised anything and you don't receive it there's something wrong amen so if we're so sure that God promised us something amen God is able to to do it Amen we just have to approach it in the right way and-and-and-and you see it gives us a signal brother Branham said there's just something wrong I mean what's wrong with it Amen so let me just read you a scripture here on on the approach and see in the scripture in Luke 22 verse 63 men that held Jesus mocked him and smote him and Wendy they had Blount folded him they struck him on the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote thee and many other things blasphemously speak they against him amen now listen they were asking him prophesy no all of us believe tonight that he can prophesy because he is the word an entire seuss man who smote thee he knew them although he was blindfolded a man and they said show us tell us and we shall believe what a challenge amen and what a challenge amen to the gift what the challenge and he was the word but they did not receive what they were asking for what's the reason the approach amen they approached him the blind the blindfolded him they mocked him smote him and when they had blindfolded him they struck him in the face and asked him saying prophesy who is it that smote day he knew every one of them he knew the numbers the number of their hair well madam said you know we're serving a God who knows how many mosquitoes there are not only in Georgia but in the whole world amen and not only that brother madam said he also know how many times these mosquitoes but their eyes and then just few soldiers who insulted him map him smote him you know the blindfold could not do any thing to do you know to know who they are even knew what they were thinking about him so they approached him and he had everything they were asking for but they approached him in the wrong way they approached him in the wrong manner there is something wrong hallelujah and so that's why the prophet of God said in everything that you do in everything that you say in everything that we think we should always check our motives amen we you know we preach the gospel amen we should have the right motive amen we go to far-flung areas amen we only have one motive and that is to bring souls at the feet of Jesus Christ amen we were not building any Kingdom whatsoever except the building the kingdom of the Lord Jesus Christ amen and so we're not promoting any man we're not even promoting brother Branham got promoted him hallelujah in that condition and so you see this man they and to think we will believe you amen so you see God wasn't Jesus was not after whether they believed or not amen and you see God you know he did not squander the gift amen and they never got anything they were asking for because of the wrong approach that they had amen and you see this is different when also in the book and the Book of Luke in chapter 8 and this very much familiar with that when when a woman approached him and you know there were many people crowding on the Lord Jesus and you know he was she was so sick she was so weak and there was no strength in her body that that was left amen and so we know she crawled between those legs she approached him she never shouted because she had not enough strength to shout amen she didn't even have enough strength to stand up but she was crawling on her knees amen and we did with her last range she just extended their hand and just touched the hem of the Lord scarlet Amon and that Amon pulled some power amen she got it because of a right approach amen and Jesus felt it who touched me amen and some know there are many people who were touching you you know why should you ask that's you amen no amen somebody approached me somebody touch me right Amen hallelujah and so in in the message resurrection of Lazarus in in Bell Bonhams prayer said our Heavenly Father now we've come together this afternoon for one purpose to speak up Dee and to love thee and we all love you and we've come facing this today knowing that today maybe someone may steal their eternal destination from the service today the attitude towards the world so it's very important amen and we're so glad that the Lord Himself who chose us to approach him that's why we don't expect all people to have the same approach Amen this word will be available to them this message will be available to everybody but it is different reaction amen but thank God for the grace of the Lord amen that we were able why because of his own juicer amen and I believe that's the word Amen blessed is the man whom thou chooses to approach me so he chose a place and he chose people to approach him I'm just glad to be part of it I'm just glad to be a man and and and saying God revealing himself he said the right mental attitude towards any promise of God will bring it to pass right mental attitude but what more if our hearts are right amen and he said it's the way you come that's what it will that's it what it will happen just the attitude you take towards wonderful amen another statement he said now you remember this zero Phoenician woman right we're so familiar with that he said now this woman this zero Phoenician woman she believed also she said Lord first she said thou son of David a Gentile has no hold on Christ by the son of David he had the wrong dog she had the wrong dog him to start with but we believe that he is the son of David but that was not 2000 years ago amen so she approached him she called him son of David and because she she called her with the wrong name Amen and he said a Gentile had no hold on Christ by the son of David that was true King David the race of Jews he never paid any attention to her but when she turned said lord help me approaching him as we are in needy people that got him he was her Lord not his son of David but he was her Lord and said Lord help me and that caught him he turned around and said it's true the dogs eat the scraps from the master's table that is true look what the woman had the right approach to God skip what did she say he said she approached it right amen and he never said oh that's too much I called you son a baby they called you Lord and now you tell me I'm a dog amen but she said that is true amen because there's not nothing wrong with the word of Jesus Christ because he is the word he's not going to tell a lie amen they said that's true she recognized that the word that he said was true and he said now he disgraced her he said I'm not sent to you your dogs in your generation your races are nothing but dogs I am NOT sent to you and she said it's truth Lord there's the word Amen stay with the word faith will always recognize the world but the dogs eat the crumbs under the master's table that got him Lord helped me he turned and he said for this saying o woman great is your faith and port is saying that that will slap your daughter what she got what she approached the gear she approached God skipped in the right way you've got to approach and remember that was the first Gentile that ever had a miracle performed on them by the son of David remember that was the first miracle performed to a Gentile that's right this healing of the zero Phoenician woman that she had the right approach to God's gift faith in the midst of the is Right Reverend humble amen so humility always attracts God because it's always the right approach amen now he how much more the bride amen and you know just like in the home you know when the the wife knows how to approach her bridegroom amen and you know what you know what I mean husband and wife you know and then and you see at times we go extra mile that that's just like the Lord Jesus Christ amen he came even not work he came for the lost sheep of Israel and that woman was not even a Jew he was a Gentile but because of her attitude Jesus being absolute he had to go extra mile and he had he had to extend his hand beyond beyond the border amen beyond what he had what he was supposed to do and who can question him amen nobody can question him but because he was so caught by the kind of attitude a man she extended her hand and and grace was being extended to that woman because of her attitude hallelujah and and so it's the same thing with their with us amen so that's why you know in this day and age in this generation I mean God has prepared us amen something that that we will be humble enough to be able to approach the gift that God has made available in this generation that we are living in amen so let me continue and said now now of course we know if even in the order of servus we know how to approach God you know and so we approached him by our means of worship and you know that's what before we brother bantam said before they go to battle it is scriptural you know you have the musicians and you have the the army behind a mint so you have you have the the music you have the word and then the battle amen so we always approach him in that way now in the Old Testament being a type of the new and the works of the inward course of the Tabernacle was a beautiful picture of God's plan of salvation for his mankind today and if we can only learn by this now and how to get ourselves in the condition to receive what God has in store for us it will just sweep the whole valley here but don't you think it's better to always know how and what you're coming for you got to know the way up approach to anything he said I prayed for kings in my day and I noticed how they taken the cups out of my trouser legs and when I walk before the King and they told me not to turn my back on him but when I left to back up and it's a certain way of reproach otherwise should be called down I mean you got to come a provided way a man is your person your honor and everything and we must meet God upon his appropriated provided plan of how we must approach him and if we could only approach him through that plan and get it right we're sure to get an audience with God amen people at times fail to receive result because of their attitude in getting attention from the Lord amen but you know but the Prophet said if only every one of us will be able to to find out and of course you know and then he said we will be able to get an audience with God amen he said now he said in the now we watch what was in the outer Court then there was the holy place or the first bill and then inside the holiest of holies and what furniture was in the outer court what was at the way the holy place and what was in the holiest of holies now he said Amen the dwelling place where God Himself dwell in them days he dwelt in his tabernacle and today he dwells in you as his tabernacle but we must make this place a dwelling not an outer Court place or the first holy place but we must live with God in the holiest of holies is consecrated hidden life alone quiet with God amen and so just like you know always most of the time I take that illustration of brother Branham that this dwelling place this home you know this is a three room house amen and you know we have the we have of course in a three room house you said brother Branham no matter how big your house is it's only divided into three a many pew have you even if you have a dozen room you know you have no matter how big your Lobby is amen so it's only divided into three you have the living room we have the kitchen you have the living room and you have the bedroom amen and brother Branham said we don't only approach him in the outer court amen and and and said it's it's just like the kitchen you know just like you know when we when we approach our friends our brethren our new frame and we meet our new friends amen and the person approach is let's eat amen go let's eat all right so that's that's the that's the outer court amen we go to the kitchen we eat amen and but we don't stop just in eating amen and so that's the same thing when we serve God when we have the home church we go to church and this is God's kitchen amen the preacher just provide the pooled amen that God has prepared a man we're just serving you the word amen it's it were just in the kitchen amen but you see there people they sometimes you know they go to church they listen but they don't have so much attachment with the people and then they just in the outer court or we come there we listen there's nothing wrong with it amen but you see if we are a part of the home church if were part of the local congregation amen we don't just we thought we just don't leave after after eating amen but we still have just like dinner brother branham you stay a little bit and you sit down in the living room and then you talk about things you plan a man you become identified admitted there our relationship becomes so mutual and then and so and so that's why you know all these things and then because your church as part become your your pastor has become so mission mission minded you know and IIIi was so touched when when brother Sam told me this you know well well you know we're talking about these things and we're just down there and the Lord has blessed you that your neighbor gave you that that that portion of the property and it's God's blessing amen you know not everybody can get that kind of privilege I'm especially here in America you know of course not even in the Philippines there's nothing that is free now amen but you see God has blessed you with something and you can see we can always recognize God's goodness even in little things why because you have the right approach and so God has given you something you're not expecting amen and and in the process of our conversation you know and he said you know we we can build a better church better than what we have right now but what for amen and you know although we are we have the privilege you have the privilege to do that you don't do it because but as I'm said in that way we can do more in the mission field out there amen why because we're not just after the kitchen food amen but because of the food that we are eating B it becomes part of it part of us and so you're looking for something and so you can plan you can you can do something and so I believe I mean that the heart of the pastor becomes the heart of this congregation - amen and you know you can only know the heart of your pastor and then of course the way he preached but you know when you become identified with each other Amen when you when we become one in heart we become one in vision we have one in plans and everything and we learn that by sitting down we learned that by talking about things amen and where does it happen but Abraham said not only in the kitchen but when you stay a little bit amen but of course we know Amen that the third room is where the result happens amen so it's not it's not on the kernel principles but we believe Amen that that that in the bedroom is where something takes place amen and so brother madam said now we approach him of course he is the word all right we listen to the word we partake of the word Amen but the world that we partake a man should put us into something where we will be identified with him and we are so much identified with the end and will become one with him and when we have union with him we receive more sense in him and that will bring result hallelujah and because we approach him not just because we want to pay their souls Amen with things and you know there are many people because they want to be fed by the preaching of the word which is which I said there's nothing bad with it but because they they do not stay so long amen they could make it they cannot go a deeper relationship only the kitchen relationship it's just the outer court but madam says don't just meet him don't just approach him in the outer court meaning don't just feed yourself with the word although it's good but you don't have to stop there because when we were just after the word Amen it will just stay in our minds amen and it will only make our heads big and this is the problem at times you know even even ministers you know they they're so fed with the information of this message amen and yet concern does not follow after their ministries and they don't care about souls and they just care about the things that they know a man they just so after the information and so you see bourbon said no just is it and today he dwells in you as his tabernacle but we must make this place a dwelling not outer court only amen not living room only amen but approach him Amen up to that inner Vail and he said but we must live with God in the Holy of Holies a consecrated hidden life alone amen alone so unless this message becomes personal now in the kitchen there are many there you know we rejoice you know and then it's good you know to talk about the word and and all the stop you know many are rejoicing we always rejoice with the word because the word the revelation is what stimulates our faith amen we can rejoice every time because of the revelation amen but when we don't become part of it and then that's why what shall we do I mean there's always something that we have to do when we receive the revelation amen when when those about 3,000 souls in the book of Acts they got the revelation that Peter preached and then they said it's not just kitchen but they said what shall we do amen so when we caught something it put us into action I mean that's the same thing when when I say you know I believe in Isaiah chapter 6 all right and and so God called I said to be up to be a prophet even Isaiah was called to be a prophet not to be a king but Isaiah was looking after a king he was so he was so caught up amen about this young king that that he saw and then happen to be his close friend brother Branham say that and he received so much attention also and privileges because the king was his friend close friend amen but you know God knows how to get our attention and and you know he for us to be able to to approach him in the right way and so when when the King died a man who was he was looking for a king but the earthly King amen but when when he came when he was down because he was so affected by the death of the king who was his friend amen and now the first thing that he did he approached the temple Amon so and then he approached and him when he went to the temple a man he saw a man not only a man know so God amen Cody Amen God allowed that thing to happen so that you know Isaiah will change his vision from an earthly king he can look up and he saw the heavenly king even and so you see but the Menem said identified that those you know angels that he saw Amen you know there are three pairs wings and he's an any priests on that on the message influence and he said the the pair covered their faces a Mende the other pair covered their knees and then the other pair amen it continued to to flappin and he said they covered their face because it is it represents respect and then the cover Denise and it was a man a sense of humility and then it was a continuous action prapannam said and then putting them together by the madam said it was respect and humility in action and that's the way to approach God and you know I say uh so it and then when he saw it Amen now something happened to I saya that when he did it he also caught the attention of God and he said and and I saw I said Lord Amen I am a man of unclean lips and I'm living in the midst of people who are also unclean so suddenly he realized who he was he suddenly realized he needed God and he suddenly didn't realize he knew he had to humble himself he had to confess amen and so that's why I'm John in Isaiah chapter six you know it has three parts and and you see the first part amen it was you know he he recognized he one who he was Amen and he made the confession amen and then later on because of that confession confession Amen he was forgiven and then what follows after that was the greatest Commission amen and said Lord Here I am send me so everything so that's why you see how do we approach God of course we approach him with all manners of humility just like what this this women have shown that's why you have you you will see seldom in the Bible brother Branham said seldom in the Bible you see we our woman's name are being written you know but they're women because they have special participation they have you know they have special attention being given by God to them because of the display of their characteristics hallelujah they were able to approach his glory they were able to approach amen and then and you know we find lots of women like even Queen Esther how she approached the king amen and there were many women more beautiful probably than Esther but she caught the attention of the king amen and the good thing there amen Esther had Mordecai who instructed her how to approach the King the way she should conduct herself the way she must approach the king and it was because there's a Mordecai amen so it's the same manner that we have right now we have our Mordecai in this generation who dress up the bride a man who gives instruction to the bride so that we will be able to approach our King in this generation amen so we always glorify God for His goodness and it's it's always earns good result when we continue to humble ourselves before as a bride you know we all have the reasons to be that was that to be proud you know the Prophet had all the reason amen and I remember you know brother Branham was you know in front of these two these buildings you know being built by his contemporaries at that time and you know being human he said Lord maybe you know you you cannot trust me with all these things because I'm an educated of some sort and everything but I'm happy with this what what what you have done to these people although they although they admit that they have you know caught something they got the inspiration from the little little ministry that you have given me but look what they've got now amen when she with that humble heart there was a voice she said as clear as you hear my voice he said but I am your Portia and what can be greater than that when God becomes our portion we may not have everything that others have amen but even then we can still approach him a man with the right attitude and I believe those those attitudes are always produced amen by the things that we get from the message because the words that I speak unto you their spirits and they are amen so this message being received in the head it will make our head big amen but when this message is being received by our hearts and say then that is that's the hidden life and I'm glad tonight I'm glad tonight we have this message that came in to the hearts of a prophet who was a real humble man a man and and God helped us you know to be like the Lord Jesus Christ and to be like amen his word amen so may the Lord adds his blessing amen to the little portion that I have tonight amen and may we continue to approach him all the time amen not just on the outer court not just on the living room amen but inside the room he said that he didn't like well where he becomes so personal to us Amen unless we walk with him personally amen so we don't we just don't worship him by group by Church but we approach him and it's it's some kind of a hidden life that only you and him hallelujah can you recognize him and he can recognize you we accepted him and we are being accepted hallelujah so do we see the two different approaches Amen those men amen the Lord had what they were asking for but they approached him with the wrong approach and they did not receive it but this women amen they approached the Lord Jesus Christ with the right approach with the right manner with the right attitude and they receive and I believe whatever we're asking for in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the spirit of humility and respect and we put our faith into action it will earn good result and it will give him glory amen god bless you and just continue on praying for us amen and if the Lord tarries Amen we will keep on pressing on until that last predestinated seed amen we'll come into the fall bless you brother Sam amen and all the rest of the believers here in Lulla Georgia yeah we will keep also all of you in our prayers I mean as I turn the microphone to brother Samuel god bless you amen keep on praying for us for my little congregation and my family Amen praise the Lord [Applause] what a great day for a church to realize the people who they are and what we're here for we're not here to tear the world apart we're here to be Christians and wall day by day in a Christian life before the world but they can see Christ in us amen make sure you tell her brother how much he appreciate you we believe the word and we we thank you him for his effort and what they're doing dar I was telling him a little bit today because you know you say a missionary let's see this may sound odd to you but see I'm a pastor art if I go somewheres out here just in the States and around it that wouldn't be no missionary endeavor but to go out where somebody else had been as a mission their endeavor and you see these brothers go into these countries in things and that's that's a missionary endeavor there's are there but they're right on those countries and some of them ain't too friendly they're out there doing a missionary work we're over here just taking it easy you know but that's that's the way God has to work it out amen where you got really through 24 each
