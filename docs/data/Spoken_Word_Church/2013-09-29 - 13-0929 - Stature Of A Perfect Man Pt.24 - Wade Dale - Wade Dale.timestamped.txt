[0:02] to the next one called knowledge let's
[0:06] read second Peter one Simon Peter
[0:09] servant and Apostle Jesus Christ to them
[0:12] that have obtained like Precious Faith
[0:15] with us through the righteousness of God
[0:17] and our Savior Jesus Christ so who is he
[0:19] talking to Christians people that are
[0:22] born again at Faith right down there
[0:24] where it says faith in the bottom of the
[0:25] pyramid Grace and peace be multiplied
[0:27] unto you through the knowledge of God
[0:30] and of Jesus our lord according as his
[0:32] divine power have given unto us all
[0:34] things that pertain unto life and
[0:36] godliness so this is what this is going
[0:39] back to you know 10 or
[0:43] 15 this one's not going to start turn on
[0:47] the past we're on number
[0:50] 24 so now being on number
[0:53] 24 number 24 so back about number 12 or
[0:57] somewhere in there we talked about this
[0:59] scripture according as his divine power
[1:01] hath given unto us all things that
[1:03] pertaineth unto
[1:05] life your natural life living here on
[1:08] the earth and godliness and that's to be
[1:10] more like God cuz the statute of a
[1:12] perfect man is to be more like God so
[1:15] what Paul Peter's telling us is this is
[1:17] going to affect your life and your walk
[1:20] with God all right so even in normal
[1:24] life you're going to have troubles but
[1:27] there are certain things that you can do
[1:29] to keep you out of that deep pit what we
[1:33] were talking about there in in proverb
[1:36] so through the knowledge of him see
[1:38] through knowledge so that the next one
[1:40] coming up is knowledge through the
[1:42] knowledge of him that has called us to
[1:43] glory and virtue whereby are given which
[1:46] is a gift unto us exceeding great and
[1:49] precious promises that by these you
[1:51] might be partakers of the divine
[1:54] nature all right having escaped the
[1:56] corruption that is in the world through
[1:58] lust and besides this giving all
[2:00] diligence add to your faith all right
[2:03] remember what we said add to what you
[2:05] believe that's what faith is Faith is
[2:07] what you believe in add to your faith
[2:11] virtue now we talked about virtue for
[2:13] the past five or six Sundays and when
[2:16] you we know that virtue is strength you
[2:18] must have it to be able to give it and
[2:20] you must know you have it to be able to
[2:23] give it cuz you know what you need some
[2:24] Inner Strength yourself all right it's
[2:26] not just that people around you need
[2:28] strength you you need that inner
[2:30] strength yourself but you have faith in
[2:34] your virtue you never lose Faith you add
[2:36] to what you believe
[2:39] virtue your faith in your virtue makes
[2:42] that thing
[2:43] work everybody understand that your
[2:47] faith you got to have faith that you've
[2:48] got virtue if you don't then how can I
[2:50] draw from it if if if you don't think
[2:53] you got
[2:54] it Peter knew he had
[2:57] it so Peter said so go Have I None but
[3:02] such as I have give I unto thee right
[3:04] remember we were talking there about
[3:07] about that Peter didn't have enough
[3:09] money probably to buy him a sandwich so
[3:12] he knew he didn't have enough money to
[3:14] send that guy set on the ground to a
[3:16] doctor so he said Silver and Gold Have I
[3:19] number but such as I have in other words
[3:20] he don't he didn't have anything in his
[3:22] billfall but he had an inner strength
[3:24] and he knew that but such as I have not
[3:27] not not hold on a minute let me go pray
[3:29] hold on a minute let me get my life
[3:31] cleaned up hold on let me go do this no
[3:33] it was an instant moment he was walking
[3:36] by and honestly I don't think that
[3:41] Peter had a
[3:43] vision saw the guy I believe Peter was
[3:46] just walking through the
[3:48] gate you understand what I'm saying he
[3:51] he was just walking through the gate and
[3:54] this
[3:54] man was the one that was wanting to
[3:58] receive so we know God works on both
[4:01] ends he put Peter in that direction but
[4:03] I don't think Peter was impressed
[4:05] because if he was Peter would have
[4:06] stopped himself but he was walking by
[4:09] and the person said
[4:11] hey I require arms of the or I need I
[4:14] need some money in other words um Peter
[4:17] just stopped and said I ain't got no
[4:19] money but what I do have I'll get you in
[4:22] a condition where you can go find you
[4:24] some money where you can get up and walk
[4:26] and that's what happen
[4:28] so this all
[4:31] a strength of character because of
[4:33] coming where it
[4:35] do I
[4:36] always that once you become
[4:43] again you need
[4:51] strength you have listen you have the
[4:54] divine nature of God in your soul at a
[4:55] new birth right but remember the quote
[4:58] that I showed you last week where
[5:01] brother rown said faith alone's not
[5:02] going to do
[5:04] it say boy Faith Al no I got it it's we
[5:08] had it on the screen faith alone will
[5:11] not do it what faith alone will not make
[5:13] you a complete statute of a perfect man
[5:15] you got everything you need inside there
[5:18] but you got to have confidence that it's
[5:20] in
[5:20] there it's always there you don't get a
[5:24] little of the Holy Ghost and then you
[5:25] get a much more you get all you need for
[5:27] your journey but what we've already said
[5:29] is that our memory reason conscious
[5:32] affection and Imagination the things
[5:34] that affect us in this world we kind of
[5:37] put it in a put it in a shell so it
[5:39] can't work right
[5:42] because Martin Luther like we were
[5:44] talking about Sunday evening Martin
[5:46] Luther had the same holy ghost that
[5:49] William brandham
[5:51] had right Martin Luther had the same
[5:54] holy ghost that you got but you and I
[5:58] have are supposed to do the Greater
[6:01] Works Martin Luther had all these
[6:04] virtues in the Holy
[6:06] Ghost but he just believed that just
[6:08] shall live by faith he drank a beer sat
[6:10] in the pub smoked the pipe right because
[6:13] the Sanctified life had not been
[6:15] revealed to him the only way you're
[6:18] going to get any of these virtues is out
[6:19] of
[6:20] here and coming through the filter of
[6:23] your mind from a
[6:26] preacher don't tell me you do it you we
[6:28] fil everything through our our brain we
[6:31] do right our brains don't have the Holy
[6:33] Ghost our soul has the Holy Ghost but
[6:36] our brain is the
[6:38] connection without our brain we're
[6:41] dead and through our brain we listen to
[6:44] what brother Dell says or what other
[6:46] ministers say and we filter that
[6:49] through our spirit right right and then
[6:54] it gets down into the
[6:55] salt somehow brother brand said he could
[6:58] even explain it remember I read that
[6:59] quote Sunday I believe in the service
[7:02] somehow God gets down in there and
[7:04] changes that Soul drives out the unclean
[7:07] spirit and gets you all cleaned up cuz
[7:10] there's darkness in there until the
[7:11] light comes but when the light does Come
[7:15] Peter says you got to add
[7:18] something all right virtue you get from
[7:21] what
[7:23] yourself and from others all right same
[7:26] thing with knowledge knowledge the Holy
[7:29] Ghost is knowledge it's the knowledge of
[7:31] God the Bible say the knowledge of the
[7:32] Lord will fill the Earth the Sea and the
[7:34] sky why cuz we'll all be there we'll all
[7:36] have a pure mind but remember Eve's mind
[7:39] was polluted
[7:41] first that's where Satan got her first
[7:45] then the rest of the act happened but
[7:47] she was polluted in Her Mind by
[7:50] accepting something that God told him
[7:52] not to do CU that's one of the very
[7:54] first things you see in knowledge if
[7:55] You' have looked up the scripture is
[7:58] Genesis 2 and9
[8:02] that the Lord made the Lord God made
[8:04] grow every tree that is Pleasant the
[8:05] sight and good for food the tree of life
[8:07] also in the midst of the garden and the
[8:08] tree of
[8:10] knowledge of Good and
[8:12] Evil tree of
[8:15] knowledge and that tree did most of you
[8:18] did you look up your your definition
[8:19] somebody got a definition of the word
[8:22] knowledge sister
[8:26] Trudy sing it out loud
[8:30] you saying out loud can't you
[8:32] talk well the one that I really like
[8:34] most means the awareness or famili
[8:37] familiarity gained by experience of
[8:40] facts and situation that's good cuz
[8:43] listen this knowledge in the pyramid is
[8:46] not whether you know algebra trig
[8:50] calculus brother brandham said an
[8:52] ignorant and unlearned person Peter
[8:55] right couldn't even write his name but
[8:57] he received the Holy Ghost see that's
[8:59] hard for us as intelligent
[9:03] people in this age of intelligence which
[9:05] this is the age of intelligence we've
[9:08] got so much I mean if you want to look
[9:10] up knowledge you know you used to you'd
[9:11] have to go through the dictionary and
[9:13] you'd have to go through the world book
[9:14] and psychopedia if you didn't have one
[9:17] you had to go find one
[9:21] now you can take your phone out if you
[9:24] had one you take your phone out punch in
[9:27] knowledge Google and guess what you you
[9:29] got all kind of definitions of the word
[9:31] knowledge all right so knowledge has
[9:34] increased the Bible say but I like this
[9:37] one that
[9:39] word in the Hebrew lexican
[9:43] is De
[9:45] a de means
[9:49] perception
[9:52] skill understanding wisdom and I like
[9:55] this one because this is the one that
[9:57] knowledge to me knowledge know in the
[9:59] pyramid means one thing is
[10:04] earn knowledge in this pyramid has
[10:07] nothing to do with human
[10:10] knowledge you already got human
[10:14] knowledge most of us graduated school
[10:17] most of us can write our
[10:18] name Ray has to help Kathy a little but
[10:21] it's
[10:23] okay but that's all right you can get a
[10:26] stamp with your name on if you ever
[10:27] write it one time you just start
[10:28] stamping stuff you'll be
[10:30] honest but you know though she's got the
[10:33] Holy Ghost I believe she does well you
[10:34] know what she a she and I are not the
[10:37] smartest cookie in the you know or
[10:39] smartest knife in the drawer but you
[10:41] know what that don't matter that don't
[10:43] matter to God I'm not I don't have a lot
[10:46] of I got a lot of knowledge but a lot of
[10:48] times I don't have a lot of good Common
[10:50] Sense I'd rather have a lot of good
[10:52] common sense then I had to have a lot of
[10:55] knowledge you know a s plus b square
[10:59] equals whatever that is I I've learned
[11:01] it in school but you know what never
[11:03] used it since I got out of high school
[11:05] not one
[11:07] time unless I wanted to go in that field
[11:09] and you know yall know I love algebra
[11:12] and trig and calculus and all that stuff
[11:14] so but you know what I've never had to
[11:15] use it any any s so that kind of
[11:19] knowledge every time we hear this word
[11:22] knowledge don't think of any kind of
[11:25] human knowledge right that I've went to
[11:27] college or that I'm smarter than this
[11:29] one or I know more than this one that
[11:31] has not one thing to do with that
[11:33] knowledge in the
[11:35] pyramid now an illiterate person can set
[11:38] up here today now illiterate means you
[11:40] can't write your name that's what they
[11:41] said about Peter brother B said it's the
[11:44] new birth can be understood or the word
[11:46] of God can be understood by an
[11:48] illiterate
[11:49] person why because he listens to what's
[11:51] being said and he applies it to his life
[11:55] to me that's very to me that's very
[11:57] simple what what bothers you and me is
[12:02] is our human
[12:06] knowledge brother Dale said it Wednesday
[12:08] night I hope you caught it he said a lot
[12:10] of you are trying to figure things
[12:12] out you try to figure things out guess
[12:15] what that
[12:16] does that stops God right there because
[12:19] God don't want you to figure nothing
[12:21] out right he don't even want preachers
[12:24] to figure it out that's what the problem
[12:27] is with the preachers out there in the
[12:28] message now that preached false Doctrine
[12:30] they've tried to figure it out because
[12:32] that ain't Godly
[12:33] knowledge God's knowledge can't be
[12:36] error so God's knowledge is much
[12:40] higher God's knowledge is one word and
[12:44] that's
[12:46] discernment because Eve lost her
[12:49] discernment in the garden up
[12:52] here and guess what she was coequal with
[12:56] Adam so God spoke to her
[13:00] right hello God spoke to her just like
[13:03] he spoke to him brother Brown said
[13:06] before the fall they were
[13:08] co-equal cuz remember if he's a type of
[13:10] Christ and we're a type of the Bride the
[13:14] Bible says in Romans 8 that you and I
[13:16] are what hires and Joint
[13:19] hires with Jesus Christ Our
[13:22] husband so what God's trying to do is is
[13:25] not not get us to where Jesus is here
[13:27] and we're here
[13:29] join
[13:30] ours is back to co-ee equalness right
[13:34] that's what brother R said and I believe
[13:36] that Eve didn't have a problem until she
[13:40] let what her own
[13:42] knowledge she should have said no but
[13:45] her discernment was
[13:48] wrong that's why you sisters can't
[13:50] preach in the pull pit you deal a lot
[13:53] with emotion Eve deal deals with emotion
[13:56] and she deals with a lot of things that
[13:57] she was trying to to do sometimes you
[14:00] know brother Ramy we try to help
[14:03] God and God don't need our help amen he
[14:07] just needs us to discern from Good and
[14:10] Evil that's why it says right here now
[14:12] let's read this and out of the ground
[14:14] the Lord God made to grow every tree
[14:16] that is Pleasant to the sight Genesis
[14:17] 2:9 and good for food the tree of life
[14:20] also in the midst of the garden and the
[14:22] tree of knowledge of Good and Evil now
[14:23] let's read that the tree of
[14:26] discernment of Good and Evil
[14:29] God didn't want you to know evil he
[14:31] wants you to know
[14:32] good and you know what in Genesis
[14:36] 2:9 remember he keeps on going he said
[14:38] okay from the Tree of this you can eat
[14:41] but from the Tree of that you can't eat
[14:44] why'd he tell them that he knew if they
[14:46] got over here on this side what the
[14:48] Bible say they would be as Gods wise
[14:51] remember That's what Satan said you'll
[14:52] be as God you'll know all things all
[14:55] right but that's going into the human
[14:57] knowledge not God's knowledge
[15:02] so in a nutshell whatever whatever
[15:04] definition you looked up is fine as far
[15:07] as knowledge as far as human
[15:09] knowledge but if an illiterate
[15:12] person that cannot
[15:15] read or right if he can receive the Holy
[15:20] Ghost what does he do he just simply
[15:23] believe he simply says God I accept you
[15:25] for what you said I can't read
[15:28] somebody's have to tell it to me but you
[15:31] know even when brother Brown he had a
[15:33] seventh grade education but you know
[15:34] what you remember he said he said that
[15:37] um who was it hope or one of them used
[15:39] to read the Bible hope used to read the
[15:41] scripture and then he would preach
[15:44] brother Brown had a hard time reading
[15:46] seventh grade education you're really
[15:48] not getting where you understand what
[15:49] you read good okay or I
[15:52] didn't
[15:54] so this knowledge here I want to get
[15:57] that out of your brain
[15:59] it is nothing to do with human knowledge
[16:03] nothing I'll go back one more time
[16:05] brother Brown said an illiterate
[16:08] person now we don't meet too many
[16:10] illiterate person this day and time and
[16:12] it's not it's not an excuse to be
[16:14] illiterate I don't want you to
[16:17] be but sometimes our human knowledge
[16:19] gets in place of our spiritual knowledge
[16:23] and we try to figure things out now
[16:26] there's nowhere in the Bible that God
[16:27] says figure you need figure things
[16:30] out
[16:32] right he said you have the mind of
[16:34] Christ now if we have the mind of Christ
[16:35] that mind will come to us and we'll
[16:38] understand things okay but that word
[16:42] knowledge even perception is used and
[16:44] skill but even discernment in natural
[16:47] knowledge we need for natural things on
[16:51] on Earth Earthly things but the Heavenly
[16:53] things you got to discern first thing
[16:56] it's not going to be whether you discern
[16:58] what whether you need to go to this job
[16:59] or that job or this job or that job your
[17:02] number one discernment as a Christian is
[17:04] is to discern right from wrong according
[17:07] to the
[17:09] Bible that's it he don't require
[17:12] anything else look at brother brandham
[17:15] he we all you know we all took the day
[17:17] Ramy course and all those things and and
[17:19] we think well the prophet of God he he
[17:22] surely God helped him manage his money
[17:24] remember he lost his first chair cuz he
[17:26] couldn't make the payments on right they
[17:29] repossessed his
[17:31] chair and that was in the
[17:33] 30s but you know what it was something
[17:35] he desired as a human he wanted that
[17:37] chair but you know what God thought so
[17:39] much of that repossessed
[17:41] chair remember when he went across the
[17:43] curtain a time what was sitting
[17:46] there what was sitting there his
[17:50] chair right remember his chair his dog
[17:53] his
[17:54] horse so even in even in our you know
[17:57] you even in our human knowledge
[18:00] um you know several people that have
[18:03] made millions in in the world have went
[18:05] bankrupt several times they don't tell
[18:06] you about that they just tell you about
[18:07] the successes but a lot of people went
[18:09] bankrupt so what I'm saying is is you
[18:11] need a lot of
[18:13] knowledge just to get in this world and
[18:15] and be successful but sometimes don't
[18:17] let our
[18:19] success you know I'm going to tell you
[18:21] like I told that brother one time before
[18:23] if God he said God gave me this job well
[18:26] he couldn't be on here Wednesday he
[18:28] couldn't be here on Wednesday night and
[18:29] mostly on Sunday I said God didn't give
[18:31] you that
[18:33] job you stay out church on Wednesday
[18:35] night because of your job you're back
[18:38] slid I tell the whoever I was working
[18:41] for and whoever I do I told when I
[18:43] started working for Jacob first time I
[18:45] said I said I need to be off at 4:00 on
[18:46] Wednesday cuz I'm going to
[18:48] church and I ain't one of them that gets
[18:50] there 5 minutes till
[18:52] 7 right I get there an hour early so I
[18:54] want to be there early but you know what
[18:57] if a man will honor you God honor
[18:59] him anybody and you say well I'm afraid
[19:02] to are you afraid to ask somebody for
[19:04] your
[19:05] soul that's your soul you're talking
[19:08] about not not some stupid
[19:11] dollar you'll never be successful if you
[19:13] work on Sunday and Wednesday night
[19:15] you'll never be I promise you you will
[19:17] never be successful and I'm sorry that
[19:19] may hit half of you but you know what on
[19:21] Wednesday night then a lot of people

[19:24] guarantee you if there's something going
[19:26] on special you'll be somewhere
[19:29] well I'm preaching now
[19:30] sorry but you know what Holy Ghost
[19:34] knowledge if you have Holy Ghost
[19:36] knowledge that's what the Holy Ghost
[19:37] knowledge will tell
[19:39] you it'll tell
[19:42] you to be in church not sing it
[19:48] home your knowledge may tell you
[19:50] different but the Holy Ghost will not
[19:53] tell you to stay out of
[19:55] church
[19:56] right he will not now I know some of you
[19:59] live a long way away and that's okay but
[20:01] that's why we got the internet but if
[20:03] you that live around here I'm telling
[20:06] you you'd make the stinking ball game if
[20:09] it was on Wednesday
[20:11] night or
[20:13] whatever but you know what people we got
[20:15] this is the statue of a perfect man this
[20:17] is what we're called to in this end
[20:20] time Martin Luther may not have been
[20:22] called he's not wasn't called to what
[20:23] we're called
[20:24] to God winked at his SM smoking a pie
[20:28] and drinking beer you can't do that and
[20:30] get by
[20:31] now that Spirit has gone it's left here
[20:35] right because of sanctification when you
[20:38] come to a Sanctified life when I come to
[20:40] a Sanctified life a lot of people say I
[20:43] know I got the new birth CU I quit doing
[20:44] this quit doing this quit doing
[20:47] this Bible says the unclean Spirit goes
[20:50] out at
[20:51] sanctification you should have stopped
[20:53] that at sanctification that don't mean
[20:54] one thing you got the holy ghost that
[20:56] just means that God come in and drove
[20:57] that un spirited out problem
[21:00] is we don't fill it with the Holy
[21:05] Ghost and we let them seven guys come
[21:08] back I mean one guy come back with seven
[21:11] of his
[21:12] friends and you're seven times
[21:15] worse why you're sitting in church
[21:17] thinking everything's cool and
[21:19] okay but you'll show I mean you're by
[21:22] your fruits you'll be known see
[21:24] discernment see don't you think that
[21:26] Brother D he's got discernment Beyond
[21:29] even what you know brother brandham had
[21:31] a discernment that he could tell you the
[21:33] thoughts and intents of your heart and
[21:35] brother Dale may not have that
[21:36] discernment to tell the thoughts and
[21:38] intents of your heart thank
[21:42] goodness me either but I promise you one
[21:44] thing if you're not here all the time at
[21:46] church if you got all these excuses and
[21:48] you got all these problems he knows
[21:50] what's going on he knows you need a
[21:53] birth or you need a
[21:56] regeneration I mean that's just just to
[21:58] me that's just common
[22:01] sense I think God's brought me to a
[22:03] knowledge that if I don't go to church
[22:06] I'm either lost or backslid one of the
[22:08] time and if I continue to do it I'm lost
[22:12] it's just as plain it's just like I told
[22:14] you about finding knowledge in
[22:17] Google Google God every once in a
[22:23] while Google God not naturally I'm
[22:26] talking spiritually
[22:28] cuz here is what this is God's Google
[22:31] book right here right this is if you
[22:35] need something in Google you what do you
[22:37] do you punch in the what you need and
[22:40] Google will bring it up bring it from
[22:41] all over the place and bring it to one
[22:43] spot right now if you need something
[22:46] from God what do you go to you go to the
[22:48] book and you say well I need knowledge
[22:51] well hey from what we're talking about
[22:53] now um there's 168 reference es to
[22:58] knowledge in the Bible yeah more than
[23:03] virtue
[23:05] 168 because knowledge to
[23:08] me is one of the most important things
[23:11] to to get you on
[23:13] up into that statue of a perfect man why
[23:16] do you need to have it
[23:17] early same thing with virtue why do you
[23:19] need to have it
[23:20] early you know what I'm talking about
[23:23] God just didn't place these seven
[23:25] things in in in just random
[23:29] order they're placed where you got to
[23:31] have faith first then you got to like
[23:33] Sister Lisa said just a wonderful point
[23:35] and a point I've never thought
[23:37] of you got to find that virtue in you
[23:42] first before somebody else can find it
[23:44] in
[23:45] you you got to find it in
[23:48] yourself that's why that statute of
[23:50] perfect miny brother brandham says he
[23:52] says you come all this way up here and
[23:54] you you don't have the Holy Ghost yet
[23:56] well people go crazy over that thinking
[24:00] you don't get the Holy Ghost till you
[24:01] get up everywhere say holy spirit but
[24:02] keep reading he said that Holy Ghost
[24:05] actually Seals Everything in cuz he said
[24:09] hey you get right up here to Temperance
[24:11] somebody cut you off and make you mad
[24:13] and you blow up about it well you know
[24:16] right there God hadn't seal Temperance
[24:18] in all
[24:20] right I tell you when we get brotherly
[24:23] kindness we're going to have fun with
[24:25] it cuz you got to love your neighbor and
[24:28] your enemy just as you love your own
[24:31] self and that ain't just U FAL
[24:36] love well it's easy to love somebody
[24:38] that loves
[24:39] you but how about loving somebody that
[24:42] literally hates your
[24:44] gut and you can love them with the same
[24:47] love you had if they agreed with
[24:49] everything you said and they were your
[24:50] best friend that's pretty wild knowledge
[24:53] though let's get back to knowledge just
[24:55] for a second we're going to get back to
[24:57] it and read some script scriptures we'll
[24:58] go ahead and go upstairs here real quick
[25:01] but listen discernment when we say
[25:04] Knowledge from now
[25:06] on use that word discernment cuz what
[25:09] you are doing with not with the Holy
[25:11] Ghost knowledge
[25:13] is that tree of knowledge of Good and
[25:16] Evil is still excuse me is still here
[25:19] now brother brand said the tree of life
[25:21] is Jesus Christ so you have that in here
[25:24] everybody got that you have the Tree of
[25:25] Life in you as the new as the new birth
[25:29] all right but that tree of knowledge of
[25:32] Good and Evil was not done away with in
[25:34] the
[25:35] garden it's still here what it's
[25:40] Choice it's a free moral agency just let
[25:42] me preach on Sunday afternoon you're
[25:44] still a free moral agency a agent after
[25:46] you're born again that's where these
[25:48] come
[25:49] in cuz if you're born again you're a
[25:51] child of God but you may not make it to
[25:54] knowledge or Temperance or patience or
[25:56] all those things like that
[25:58] but you're a
[25:59] son remember one son stayed at home one
[26:02] son went out in the world
[26:06] right this one may have a little more
[26:08] knowledge than this one but the other
[26:09] one came back showing that he was truly
[26:12] a son so knowledge is
[26:16] discernment brother brandham you'll I'll
[26:18] bring the quotes how many times do he
[26:21] said have you prayed over the
[26:25] matter how many times he said and that's
[26:28] may not be verbatim but he says have you
[26:30] prayed over the situation have you
[26:31] prayed over the matter or do we just
[26:33] jump into
[26:34] something see that has a lot to do with
[26:36] Temperance too but you got to have
[26:39] knowledge which is discernment to
[26:42] discern from Good and Evil cuz you know
[26:44] what good and Evil's right
[26:50] here a tell you to stay
[26:53] home God tell you to come to
[26:55] church so if you listen to one you know
[26:58] who that guy is it's the
[27:01] devil so because you know why you go
[27:04] back through now you got to run it
[27:05] through the filter of the word what does
[27:07] the word
[27:08] say forsake not the assembling of
[27:10] yourself together and
[27:13] more what the problem is is people don't
[27:16] believe I was telling them out wi from
[27:17] people don't believe this is the end
[27:20] time cuz the Bible says and more as the
[27:23] day approaches so if you go to church
[27:26] less now than you did 10 years years ago
[27:28] you're
[27:29] lost let me just put it that way you're
[27:31] you're lost or you're just totally the
[27:33] back you can't see what's going on but I
[27:35] need to be here minister or no Minister
[27:39] I need to be here to get my
[27:41] filling every
[27:43] service I come to church just like I'd
[27:46] go anywhere else I prepare we get
[27:49] ready
[27:50] right like I said before you know you
[27:54] head off to a a doctor's appointment you
[27:56] get there 30 minutes later you you just
[27:57] don't
[28:00] go now you don't do that you're not
[28:02] going to miss that doctor's B that
[28:04] doctor's got
[28:06] knowledge don't if you don't
[28:08] know how about a little Holy Ghost
[28:11] knowledge all right
[28:13] let's keep if you didn't look up
[28:16] knowledge I'm giving you one more week
[28:18] look up knowledge cuz I'm going to ask
[28:19] each one of you next Sunday your
[28:21] definition of
[28:24] knowledge and you too FR and and
[28:27] Monique I'll call you from Jamaica and
[28:29] find
[28:46] out all right thank you
