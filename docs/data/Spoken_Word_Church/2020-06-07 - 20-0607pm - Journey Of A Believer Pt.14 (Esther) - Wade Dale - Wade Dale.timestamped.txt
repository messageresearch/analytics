[17:16] Lord I want to understand who you are
[17:20] good to be in the house with Lord let's
[17:22] give these young people a round of
[17:25] applause and the ones that help them do
[17:29] their job
[17:30] around little man a man yes thank you
[17:37] Lord we remember when a lot of them were
[17:39] left little we're in the first group
[17:42] some groups have moved on and started
[17:45] having their own group so I remember
[17:48] when Amy's not hearing me and Jeffrey
[17:52] they they got married but before they
[17:55] got married they were in a little group
[17:56] then they got any youth group and then
[17:59] they got married started their own group
[18:03] so I guess that's why it should be by
[18:05] the time I start your own group but good
[18:10] to be in the house of the Lord good to
[18:11] have each and every one of you here
[18:12] there's a few things we're gonna cover
[18:13] right here real quick those of you that
[18:20] want to go back to having service as it
[18:23] was and get rid of this blue tape up
[18:27] here we need to as a church vote on it
[18:32] brother Dale's okayed it I just said
[18:36] let's open it up and my younger brother
[18:40] with all the wisdom said now let's vote
[18:42] on it so that's to me that's better so
[18:45] of all of you that want to have it as
[18:48] regular service would you raise up your
[18:51] hand and they're looking downstairs I
[18:57] think it's about 100 percent but I still
[19:00] want us to be careful they're looking
[19:02] downstairs brother Anderson I hope he
[19:05] didn't forget I asked him to run down
[19:06] there he did it's good okay but if you
[19:10] have a concern if you are sick please
[19:12] don't come sniffles sneezes and other
[19:18] things but we know listen we we didn't
[19:22] understand this thing back in March and
[19:24] April we didn't know what we were
[19:25] looking at
[19:25] but I think we do know what we're
[19:27] looking at now we're looking at at a
[19:29] virus that is that is deadly to a degree
[19:32] and and it hits the older people more
[19:36] than it does the younger people and
[19:37] people with pre-existing conditions so
[19:39] it would be I figured so it would be
[19:44] every 100 percent downstairs - it would
[19:46] be foolish to just say it was nothing we
[19:50] know better than that
[19:51] but we need to make sure that we
[19:54] continue to wash your hands and if you
[19:56] have a cough don't call on somebody okay
[20:01] but I think we I think everybody's kind
[20:04] of wanting to get back but we still need
[20:07] to be cautious about it really cautious
[20:10] we're still gonna wipe the doorknobs off
[20:12] we're still gonna wipe the doors in the
[20:14] back and you'll still see the hand
[20:16] sanitizer everywhere which is a good
[20:18] idea anyway maybe to cut down on any of
[20:20] the other things that we might that we
[20:22] might get and but I think that when they
[20:25] Sunday will begin back with the regular
[20:27] Sunday School classes brother boy I've
[20:28] already talked to him mm-hmm he will I
[20:31] will and everybody to be back together
[20:33] in their Sunday School classes but if
[20:35] you have a reservation about it please
[20:38] let us know and it will not bother us
[20:40] one bit if you want to sit downstairs
[20:42] away from it right it won't bother us a
[20:45] bit at all it's your it's your personal
[20:47] preference but like brother Nell said
[20:50] then you'll go to Walmart Monday and
[20:52] spend half a day so just just watch what
[20:55] you're doing we are not social
[20:56] distancing much now anyway you saw all
[20:58] of them singing up here you know some
[21:00] but that's the younger kids but just hey
[21:02] listen pray let's just don't forget this
[21:04] thing let's just keep them in prayer
[21:07] with brother Dale still got the prayer
[21:09] cloths over all the doors and we know
[21:10] how that how that works we've seen it
[21:12] work hundreds of times you know praying
[21:15] over things and laying that prayer
[21:17] cloths on somebody and seeing cancer
[21:19] being taken care of and a lot of
[21:21] different things so it's good to see
[21:23] brother Hal back with us looking good
[21:26] back there
[21:28] good to have you back with us buddy he's
[21:30] kind of one of those like brother Colley
[21:32] he's if there's a void there that nobody
[21:35] else can fill it so but remember that
[21:38] too we will start that brother Aaron his
[21:40] preaching Wednesday night all right and
[21:43] today is mom's birthday party her
[21:45] birthday was Friday she was a little bit
[21:48] over 45 and we'll have a little party

[22:04] stay but we are having we're not buying
[22:06] pizza for everybody but if you have a
[22:08] child that is participating in the Youth

[22:13] pizza but not not for everybody that's
[22:15] not for everybody it's for the youth
[22:18] okay

[22:22] of you that still got your calendar make
[22:24] sure that you hang them to your calendar

[22:52] that's why I give you these but since
[22:56] you see them on the back of the seats
[22:58] and in the trash can I guess it doesn't
[23:00] do a whole lot of good but anyway it
[23:02] makes me feel good that I can go it's on
[23:06] the refrigerator yeah it's on the
[23:07] refrigerator

[24:12] for the kids plus brother Richard
[24:14] Roberts is getting a map together for
[24:19] the fishing it's kind of gonna be a
[24:21] little different than we used to do it
[24:22] before Chattahoochee we all knew where
[24:24] to fish because the river was right
[24:26] there but this kind of we're in a
[24:27] central location they're in Roberts town
[24:29] and there are several places you can
[24:30] fish there's also zip line there's also
[24:32] canoeing rafting whatever you want to do
[24:35] maybe not rafting but different things
[24:37] you can do tubing that's what I was
[24:39] trying to say so there'll be a lot of
[24:41] things that we can do and that will be
[24:43] on Thursday the 18th on Thursday evening
[24:46] we'll get there four o'clock we'll be
[24:49] there until Saturday morning at 11:00 I
[24:51] have to check out at 11 o'clock on
[24:53] Saturday and I think the sisters are
[24:55] going to be coming back on Saturday
[24:56] afternoon too so keep that in your
[24:59] prayers and on your heart also now
[25:02] remember July the 4th we will have a
[25:05] meeting here at 11 o'clock it will be a
[25:09] service for brother Andrew Glover it
[25:10] will be catered to the youth but anyone
[25:13] can attend also they'll be fellowship
[25:17] afterwards with members and hot dogs and
[25:19] then brother Andrew Glover will be here
[25:21] for that Sunday service so just keep
[25:24] that in your prayers that's July the 4th
[25:26] all right everybody got that same am all
[25:29] right so now I think that's it but we're
[25:31] gonna meet next Sunday some of the men
[25:33] will meet together and figure out if
[25:35] you're really gonna go or not and what
[25:37] time you're gonna go so god bless you
[25:39] love you with the love of the Lord thank
[25:41] you for everything thank you for
[25:42] everybody for participating in what
[25:43] we're doing here keeping people safe
[25:45] trying to make sure that everything's
[25:48] done right we kind of all scattered
[25:50] around all over the place trying to
[25:52] accommodate people and
[25:54] the and the older ones trying to get
[25:57] them up here so things sit down you know
[25:58] nor a good comfortable seat but thank
[26:01] you for the young some of your young
[26:02] ones and some of your families that sit
[26:04] downstairs and they're down there now
[26:08] you just pray that the Lord will bless
[26:10] us and we'll get back to where we can
[26:12] can fit us all back up here in the
[26:15] sanctuary I'm like brother Joe Canada
[26:16] said this morning it it's gonna be a
[26:18] choir when we get everybody here and get
[26:20] everybody back in the sanctuary again I
[26:22] think of the voice the walls may fall
[26:24] apart
[26:24] that's alright we'll build some new and
[26:26] so god bless you if you would turn your
[26:28] Bibles to the book of Corinthians and
[26:30] we'll read that one Scripture we've been
[26:31] reading we're still on journey of a
[26:33] believer this would be part 14 we're
[26:35] gonna try to finish esther today because
[26:39] to me Esther is a beautiful beautiful
[26:41] picture a beautiful book and the bible
[26:43] does not mention god one time but god's
[26:46] just all in it
[26:47] amen and it's given to us as the bible
[26:50] says for our example we read that in
[26:53] just a second i want us to make sure and
[26:56] some of the questions that's asked by
[26:57] our youth today in the in the youth
[27:01] bible study i think there's i love the
[27:06] way that they word the questions i know
[27:08] Bob kind of worded some of them a little
[27:10] bit different but I like the way they
[27:11] the kids ask questions because it comes
[27:13] straight from their mind from their
[27:14] heart about this you know if you walk
[27:20] through the world and and the question
[27:22] was even asked there I think even deanna
[27:24] maio asked us one time so well why is it
[27:26] this extra why is this why can't we just
[27:29] be Christians and just walk through the
[27:31] world and do what we can and do the best
[27:33] we can and you know and and not be
[27:35] different well you can't do that
[27:39] that's like brother Dale said this
[27:41] morning when God calls you God called
[27:42] you you responded but God calls you
[27:46] because he knew you would walk in the
[27:48] Word of God and you'll walk a different
[27:51] way amen and so we see this journey of a
[27:55] believer that we're trying to get is not
[27:57] just to get the baptism of the Holy
[27:59] Ghost but to go on with God to to get
[28:02] more of God to be able to - as we were
[28:06] talking about last night and the
[28:07] adoption
[28:08] there was a question about that there's
[28:10] a question today about the headstone and
[28:11] the different things the terminologies
[28:14] we use we're not used in Luther's day
[28:17] Wesley's day the word was still there
[28:20] they didn't add another Bible when
[28:23] brother Branham got here but he took a
[28:24] profit or as we're gonna see today it
[28:26] took a man named Mordecai to lead Esther
[28:30] through this maze of what we call
[28:33] Christianity and to kick-out with what
[28:35] we know is not right to live by the
[28:38] Bible and to live right and do the right
[28:40] things that's brother day understand
[28:42] this morning and then go to the part
[28:47] where Jesus were on the mountain and God
[28:50] said here you him same way with Mordecai
[28:53] same way with brother Branham we believe
[28:55] that the prophet of God was sent on a
[28:57] mountain give him he was given a message
[28:59] not just to tell us how to dress not
[29:02] just to tell us how to act the Bible
[29:04] already told us that but his message was
[29:07] to break open the top of that pyramid
[29:09] his message was to show us things that
[29:12] had already been written in the Bible
[29:14] but to shine so much light on it till it
[29:17] illuminates and that revelation of that
[29:19] word is gonna come back and live inside
[29:21] of us amen
[29:23] so that was brother Browns job it wasn't
[29:25] his job it wasn't his job to make us
[29:27] Christian hello it was not we should
[29:32] have lived Christian life anyway without
[29:35] a prophet being here but brother Branham
[29:37] restored back to that and then brought
[29:41] his message which was the opening of the
[29:43] seals which was that fourth or adoption
[29:45] or the placing or the capstone or the
[29:48] headstone are the opening of the seven
[29:50] seals is the way we see it that brother
[29:52] Branham was was taken up on the mountain
[29:54] and he was adopted and I believe he told
[29:56] us just exactly like Jesus he said if
[29:58] you're gonna get anything this little
[29:59] man is the only way you're gonna get it
[30:01] man so brother Branham was the Mordecai
[30:05] that was helping Esther so we see now
[30:07] that and you read we're going to read
[30:09] this a little bit today and we'll see
[30:10] that unfold in the life of a man that
[30:13] lived 2,500 years ago but we were able
[30:17] to and privileged to see that life live
[30:20] out through a man
[30:22] in just 60 something years ago 70
[30:25] something years ago so god bless you
[30:27] let's pray do you have any father thank
[30:29] you for this day that you've given us
[30:31] thank you for the bride of Jesus Christ
[30:33] Lord thank you for sending us a prophet
[30:37] - sure enough Lord you've been wanting
[30:41] to communicate with man since you and
[30:45] Adam were in the garden and thus in the
[30:47] fall happened and you had to withdraw
[30:50] yourself a little while and then you
[30:51] came down here in human flesh and truly
[30:54] then nobody really understand understood
[30:56] who you were but you came back Lord on
[30:58] the day of Pentecost into a group of
[31:00] people and they began to start
[31:02] understanding what this man Jesus Christ
[31:05] is all about then in the end time you
[31:08] sent us the Prophet Lord and he went
[31:10] back into your mind father and he
[31:12] brought that mind out and revealed it to
[31:14] the people and gave it to us Lord so
[31:17] that we can sweep this thing onto the
[31:20] coming of the Lord
[31:20] cuz there's many things that we still
[31:22] have to do in our journey and our waaldt
[31:25] Lord but I believe we're walking in the
[31:27] right direction
[31:28] I believe we're trying our best all of
[31:31] us to do the right thing and and to
[31:33] climb up that mountain and not just be
[31:36] lazy Christians but Lord be active
[31:39] participant participants Lord in this
[31:41] journey as we see Abraham was and all
[31:44] Isaac and Jacob and Joseph all these
[31:46] different ones had a journey that they
[31:47] were on Lord and you brought them to a
[31:50] place and now we can see that place Lord
[31:53] lived out in our own lives probably give
[31:56] us this day our daily bread forgive us
[31:58] of our sins blessed Lord the
[32:00] missionaries on the foreign fields give
[32:02] them fruit for their labor father we ask
[32:03] your blessings in the service you take
[32:06] over Lord and you be the active one in
[32:08] Jesus name we pray amen so the Bible
[32:11] tells us in 1st Corinthians 10 let's

[34:18] and we've known brother Collins since we
[34:21] were kids and better sister Collins has
[34:23] always been a they've always been there
[34:26] and now brother Collins is went on we
[34:31] don't question that the Lord knows what
[34:34] he's doing
[34:35] we don't so he took him on home actually
[34:40] didn't take him home he took him over in
[34:42] another dimension to be there we're not
[34:43] going home till with the future home
[34:45] ma'am so so he's over in a place of
[34:47] waiting waiting or what
[34:50] to get ready and then he's gonna step
[34:53] right back in here and he's gonna be
[34:55] instead about the truck I mean instead
[34:56] of being a big man we saw a picture of
[34:58] him when he first got mad and he looked
[35:00] kinda like that and he's about six three
[35:05] or four tall gentleman but he was like a
[35:08] stick but that's the way we'll see him
[35:10] because he was 18 years old 19 at that
[35:13] time so we just really thank God that he
[35:16] sent us a prophet that could go into
[35:19] that other dimension that could take
[35:21] that could tell us not a story I don't
[35:24] mean a story but he could make it so
[35:26] vivid you know why cuz he went there he
[35:28] went there he went across that curtain
[35:31] of time he experienced what we never
[35:33] experienced man tells us down through
[35:36] the ages man has told us you know mama
[35:38] granny
[35:39] they all said all granny's walking on
[35:42] streets that go hand-in-hand with Jesus
[35:43] no she's not right
[35:46] she's not oh they're setting it to feet
[35:49] it no they're not they're not even in
[35:52] heaven what we know is heaven but he
[35:57] took a prophet to go across the curtain
[35:58] of time because nobody's ever went over
[36:00] there and come back and told the truth
[36:02] maybe if some of these people see lights
[36:04] and they see green men and they see all
[36:06] this stuff but we had a man go across
[36:08] the curtain time come back that we
[36:09] believe and we know he saw what he saw
[36:13] because you know what it connects with
[36:14] the Bible it connects with all the
[36:16] scripture it connects with with Abraham
[36:19] and Sarah being turned back to a young
[36:20] man a woman right in the same way what I
[36:23] told you brother Tom have not heard me
[36:26] say this but when my wife went to the
[36:28] Baptist Church one time and they had a
[36:33] series called experiencing God
[36:35] well she brings home this book and this
[36:39] book has got this it looked like Rip Van
[36:41] Winkle on the front of the book ball
[36:44] headed long hair gray and a stick and
[36:49] he's looking like this and that's what
[36:51] that's what they think God looks like
[36:53] because the Bible called him the Ancient
[36:56] of Days and then he's got to be old
[36:57] because he was like way back under
[36:59] that's what kids think my God's never
[37:02] been an old man
[37:04] my God's been eighteen years old or
[37:07] twenty years old and when he was
[37:08] creating the world and the Stars I
[37:10] believe he was happy brother Brown said
[37:12] he said it was like a kid playing before
[37:14] the father door why playing with toys
[37:18] let there be and here happens this and
[37:21] let there be they'll here happens this
[37:22] and he's like ho I'm gonna paint that
[37:24] and I'm gonna put this over here and
[37:25] I'll make a Milky Way I don't believe
[37:28] God's not just somebody that stands
[37:30] there and has no personality such a
[37:33] person he's the only human there ever
[37:36] was to me at this point in time and we
[37:40] were made in His image and we're heading
[37:43] back to something but we got to get done
[37:45] with this first so let's turn the book
[37:47] of Esther but we go through the Burton
[37:50] we went through the journey of Abraham
[37:51] let me go through this real quick
[37:52] journey of Ruth's journey of Abraham and
[37:54] there's four parts of their journey
[37:56] there's four parts to your journey
[38:00] justification sanctification the baptism
[38:03] of the holy ghost and going on to
[38:05] adoption or going on to Ruth's having
[38:08] the child and Abraham producing seat and
[38:12] brother that's going to get into this
[38:14] talking about adoption but see once God
[38:16] calls you and you are a child of God or
[38:20] a Christian you're going to produce what
[38:24] you are I told the church I told
[38:26] somebody the other day we were
[38:27] downstairs talking and it was talking
[38:29] about how all these these secret things
[38:31] are being revealed you know I mean you
[38:32] politicians they're pulling stuff out of
[38:34] their life from way back when and
[38:36] they're doing this and they're doing
[38:37] that why it's time of Revelation you
[38:39] can't hide nothing you're going to
[38:43] produce if you are wheat seed you are
[38:45] going to produce wheat if you are tear
[38:49] seed or cuckoo bird you're going to
[38:51] produce cocklebur I didn't plant 40
[38:55] something squash plants to get corn I
[39:00] wanted squash in abundance
[39:04] Jim's throwing things downstairs I'm
[39:07] sure there's a story behind that
[39:11] but but I didn't you look at the end Bob
[39:14] kind of covered it when you look and you
[39:15] see you're going to produce who you are
[39:17] you can't help it same way with this
[39:21] virus and all these other things hey
[39:23] you're gonna we're going to produce who
[39:25] we are we're going to prove who we are
[39:28] and you know what God is pleased as he
[39:32] took Jesus on that mountain and said
[39:34] this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[39:36] pleased to dwell here you him he took
[39:39] brother branham up on that mountain out
[39:41] there in Arizona and he said this is my
[39:43] beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell
[39:45] took him up in a constellation of angels
[39:47] and gave him Commission to go back to
[39:50] Jeffersonville to have the seals open to
[39:52] me I I know that was I hear you him
[39:56] because you're not gonna get the
[39:57] revelation of that from anybody else
[39:59] Clarence Larkin can have his views and
[40:02] all these different people so and so can
[40:03] have their views but that's okay
[40:05] God sent one prophet and we're to listen
[40:09] to that one prophet but what he done
[40:11] though he didn't take it all with him he
[40:13] gave it to what us to produce what he is
[40:16] has preached he spent eleven hundred and
[40:18] something sermons to just leave and just
[40:22] not nothing happened no we're here to
[40:25] produce what that Bible said and through
[40:29] that prophet we're going to see here
[40:30] extra would have not been we'll get to
[40:33] it second extra would have not been
[40:34] anything if she hadn't had guidance from
[40:38] the different players in the story the
[40:43] memucan x' and the different ones and
[40:45] the different people Haggai and all the
[40:47] different ones and then here pops
[40:49] Mordecai which she has complete
[40:51] confidence in Mordecai that's why I said
[40:54] today that we see that brother branham's
[40:58] the confidence that people have in
[41:00] brother Branham or waning dirt they're
[41:01] just giving up they're saying well he's
[41:02] not true and he did this and he did that
[41:04] and and I really don't care he took me
[41:07] to Jesus Christ amen he took me to Jesus
[41:11] Christ I I'm not worried about if he
[41:13] missed a date and I don't think he did
[41:15] but they just don't understand they just
[41:20] don't understand cuz I'm gonna tell you
[41:23] something brother right if if if brother
[41:25] Ron what
[41:25] that's the messenger we got to find
[41:28] another one so we might as well just
[41:30] scrap what we got and go back to the
[41:31] Baptist telling you if you're looking
[41:36] for something else something good her
[41:38] I ain't enough no good or net this
[41:41] message shows me Jesus Christ this
[41:43] message that opened my eyes and give me
[41:47] a revelation that my walk in my journey
[41:50] is true justification and sanctification
[41:52] the baptism of Holy Ghost and not just
[41:54] sit back and enjoy no we have a
[41:58] commission to go forward we have a
[42:02] commission to finish this thing we do
[42:07] have this commission so now as we looked
[42:11] in at the four combat base we know
[42:13] that's the line locks men and Eagle we
[42:15] know that's that's your Holy Ghost so
[42:18] there's four combat beasts to help you
[42:19] through life now let's go - we went to
[42:21] Ruth
[42:22] we had characters in route that were
[42:24] Naomi was the old Jewish Church orful
[42:27] was the denominational Church Ruth was a
[42:29] Gentile bride and Boaz as a type of
[42:31] Christ and we see what happened in her
[42:32] journey all you gotta do is read it I
[42:35] gotta do is read it see then we know
[42:38] that we go all the way to Esther and
[42:40] after there was a king there was extra
[42:42] which turned into the bride bast I was
[42:44] the church Mordecai was the little
[42:46] prophet man or the little guy that hung
[42:48] around and and kind of guided Esther
[42:51] into what to do and we'll get into that
[42:53] just a second and then Haman was the
[42:55] devil and what last Sunday that's what
[42:56] we came up to as Haman and and I
[42:58] appreciate people like brother Ryan in
[43:03] different ones I love you comments I
[43:07] love somebody say you have preached a
[43:09] good sermon a man who said that that's
[43:14] what I thought no but brother Ron sends
[43:18] me a note sometimes in the middle of the
[43:19] week and he said hey do you know what he
[43:22] said you know that Haman came in Esther
[43:25] chapter three verse one and said that in
[43:28] Genesis chapter three verse one the
[43:31] serpent was talked about and see you you
[43:35] see that and you see well at least
[43:37] somebody's you know
[43:39] digging and looking because in Genesis
[43:41] 3:1 the Bible says the serpent was more
[43:42] subtle than any beast in the field and
[43:44] now we read extra 3:1 and here's Haman
[43:46] which is the type of the devil alright
[43:49] so we see that let's start right there
[43:50] we know one thing's for sure we know
[43:52] that Esther is now the queen that she
[43:55] has been accepted she's the queen but
[43:58] there's a problem going on here because
[44:00] her people are getting ready to be
[44:02] annihilated and she's gonna have to do
[44:05] something that had never been done
[44:07] before and somebody live because you
[44:12] can't go in to see the King without
[44:15] being invited I don't even care if you I
[44:16] don't even care if you're the bride I
[44:18] don't care for you the Queen the Queen
[44:20] doesn't just automatically go into the
[44:22] throne room nope she does not because
[44:26] she will die so here we are at chapter 3
[44:30] verse 1 and then we've seen that Haman
[44:33] and we saw and showed that his lineage
[44:37] was all the way back to Esau our Amalek
[44:41] so we see how his limit lineage is
[44:43] coming up but now remember Mordecai
[44:46] didn't bow to him either as you keep
[44:48] going up down through there you look at
[44:50] verse 2 then then verse 5 but that made
[44:54] the devil listen the devil hates anybody
[44:57] that has truth he hates anybody that has
[45:02] truth and he hasn't he hasn't lost that
[45:05] character cuz why do that why did he go
[45:09] to Adam and Eve wanted to go to eat
[45:10] first
[45:11] he was gonna Mar her character he was
[45:13] going to get her to do something that
[45:16] God told him not to do so here is Haman
[45:19] Haman is trying to get the King to do
[45:21] something that if that the King now we
[45:24] know one thing's for sure that God
[45:27] Almighty knew everything that was going
[45:29] to happen because he predestinated it by
[45:32] his foreknowledge so he foreknew that
[45:35] means that come first and brother death
[45:36] will cover that a little bit later but
[45:39] by foreknowledge gotten you everything
[45:41] but now this King Denton but he put
[45:44] Haman in power in verse 10 he gave him
[45:48] power which is a permitted power because
[45:51] he gave
[45:52] he gave the devil there in Ezekiel he
[45:56] said I made you perfect you're the king
[45:58] you're the son of the morning you're the
[46:00] you're the morning cherub you're the I'm
[46:03] gonna let you be my right-hand man he
[46:05] said but he said evil was found in your
[46:09] heart or iniquity was found in your
[46:10] heart and that's the same thing with
[46:12] Haman Haman acted like he was doing a
[46:15] good deed to the king but his underlying
[46:17] meaning was he wanted to destroy the
[46:21] Jews because he knows Mordecai the Jew
[46:24] and Mordecai is not going to bow to him
[46:28] Mordecai what he didn't bow and then
[46:32] what happened was then then we took and
[46:36] see that the letters there was letters
[46:38] sent out then to destroy the Jews in one
[46:41] day now look at chapter 4 and we know
[46:46] what happened we look at Nazi a Roman
[46:51] and we we talk about it a lot but you
[46:53] know what happened at that time during
[46:55] Nicaea Rome Satan was trying to destroy
[46:58] Christianity it looked like to the world
[47:01] that he was that God was setting up
[47:05] Christianity because everybody talks
[47:07] about the the Nicene council in the
[47:10] three the three you know 325 AD in the
[47:12] 606 and boy they made they brought that
[47:15] doctrine out of father son Holy Ghost
[47:16] and the Trinitarian doctrine and they
[47:19] got everything together and man they
[47:21] made everything fit that was the devil's
[47:23] work God wasn't nowhere in that that's
[47:28] the same way with haman haman's coming
[47:30] up and he's trying his best to kill a
[47:33] group of people but he's doing it
[47:35] diplomatically because he said oh
[47:36] there's a group of people that don't
[47:38] like us and there's a group of people
[47:39] that don't do what we say to do that's
[47:41] the same way they were doing it and I
[47:42] see him because Constantine and all them
[47:45] were what they were killing Christians
[47:46] because they wouldn't be Catholics so
[47:49] the devil doesn't change his tactics e
[47:54] now in Chapter four more to come
[47:57] perceived all that was done more to kind
[47:59] of rent his clothes now see Mordecai
[48:01] finds this out first
[48:06] extra didn't find it out first
[48:08] Mordecai found it out first the little
[48:11] man he perceived I discern that there's
[48:16] something going on because listen like I
[48:20] said before and don't get me wrong the
[48:23] Prophet to God had to restore all the
[48:26] things back to the faith of the fathers
[48:28] there's no doubt but that wasn't his
[48:31] message his message wasn't even the
[48:34] healing campaign now I'll bring you a
[48:37] hundred quotes where he said that he
[48:38] said not in the healing campaign not
[48:40] when it first started but what when the
[48:43] opening of the seals when he comes down
[48:45] to a place to where he has authority to
[48:47] speak where no man has ever spoke before
[48:50] and then so Mordecai is gonna have to do
[48:53] the same thing Mordecai was gonna have
[48:54] to come to a place because remember
[48:56] Mordecai was really nothing he just
[48:58] stands at the Kings gate in other words
[49:00] he's at the right place at the right
[49:01] time and he hears these things why did
[49:05] God send a prophet because man said God
[49:09] spoke to me then this other man said God
[49:14] spoke to me then this other man said God
[49:17] spoke to me and they all three have
[49:19] different views God is not confused so
[49:24] God sent us a prophet and said hear him
[49:28] that's the one you gotta have to get it
[49:30] from so there wasn't emoticon and two
[49:38] three other guys Mordecai was in this
[49:40] story Mordecai is very important very
[49:44] important because Esther Denton Esther's
[49:46] actually not in the palace when the king
[49:49] makes this decree and he doesn't really
[49:52] understand that he made a decree to kill
[49:54] Esther's people right that's how the
[49:57] devil is he's real slick but you know
[50:00] what if God knows everything God is
[50:03] gonna use all that to destroy the devil
[50:08] because you were gonna say as we were
[50:11] talking about last Sunday Haman is going
[50:15] to come to a place to where he's gonna
[50:16] hate Mordecai so bad
[50:18] he's gonna build the Gallo and he thinks
[50:20] he's gonna hang Mordecai on it but guess
[50:24] what happens yeah he's got it coming
[50:28] listen he's got it coming let him do
[50:32] what he do he can't touch us until God's
[50:36] finished with us but when God's finished
[50:39] with us and we step out of here there's
[50:44] gonna be some hanging all right
[50:48] Mordechai perceived all that was done
[50:50] more to kind of rent his clothes and put
[50:52] on sackcloth and ashes think about a
[50:55] prophet of God nice thing about this a
[50:58] while back you look at Mordechai and
[51:01] remember more - cos did you but
[51:04] Mordechai is he's all the time
[51:06] interceding for Esther and his people
[51:11] he's always around the Kings gate he's
[51:14] always like I said in the right place at
[51:16] the right time and I was thinking about
[51:19] brother Branham and all the things he
[51:21] had to go through I mean the man the man
[51:23] died before I'm fit I'm 60 years old and
[51:26] he was 56 when he died somewhere in
[51:28] there and he looked really old why
[51:30] because he he told his whole life to get
[51:34] a message to me and you he spent his
[51:37] whole life gave up a lot of things same
[51:40] way with this Mordecai Mordecai went off
[51:43] doing something else know he was in the
[51:45] important place at the right time got
[51:49] the correct message interpretation and
[51:53] he always sent it dester always sent it
[52:00] to astor cuz you look right here look
[52:03] and he came before the Kings gate for
[52:05] none might enter into the Kings gate
[52:07] close what's that close so we going down
[52:08] a little bit further
[52:09] look at verse 4 so Esther's maid and her
[52:11] Chamberlain's came and told it to her
[52:13] what that Haman was out here toiling had
[52:16] his clothes off and he had ashes all
[52:18] over him all right so that's the way
[52:20] they mourned and grieved and she went
[52:22] with Raymond and clothed Mordecai
[52:24] anyway then called Esther for hate
[52:26] that's one of the Kings Chamberlain so
[52:28] anyway the story goes is this finally
[52:31] he tells her what's fixing to happen he
[52:35] gives her a revelation that she's gonna
[52:37] die if something's not happening they'll
[52:41] be okay with that
[52:42] you got Mordecai that Mordecai is going
[52:46] to tell Esther what's fixing to happen
[52:52] so if he does that now there's one thing
[52:56] for sure and with this chapter four and
[52:59] five is it's very beautiful if you'll
[53:01] look at it I know it may bore some of
[53:03] you but I enjoy reading and I've
[53:04] preached this 20 times and I really
[53:06] enjoy it again but what you do is you
[53:09] look at Mordecai now watch Mordecai is
[53:12] in desperation because one thing's for
[53:14] sure now here get get me right on this
[53:18] Mordecai
[53:19] becomes unimportant when he tells Esther
[53:25] what's going on now listen to what I'm
[53:28] saying
[53:29] the reason he does is it's because he
[53:31] can't go into the sea the king but
[53:36] Esther can that's me and you folks and
[53:45] is that by design it's not that by we're
[53:47] belittling anyone but we see this story
[53:50] and it's a perfect story of what brother
[53:52] Branham did he he couldn't he couldn't
[53:55] go in there with you know a lot of
[53:57] people never mind
[53:58] he wasn't God we know that but even in a
[54:02] story of Elly's or when Rebecca and
[54:04] Isaac got together they wasn't three in
[54:06] that tent that was only two so in other
[54:09] words the same way you Mordecai didn't
[54:11] go in with Esther and walk into that
[54:13] Court
[54:14] no he had to give extra the message and
[54:17] then Esther went to the king amen so
[54:22] that's the way you and I that's the way
[54:24] it's got to work that's the way it's
[54:25] worked in the Bible and that's the way
[54:27] it works with us mmm because we're
[54:31] taking everything that the prophet of
[54:32] God gave us and what we're doing is is
[54:34] we're producing a bride for Christ
[54:37] because brother I'm can't save nobody
[54:40] brother Dale can't save nobody I can't
[54:43] save anybody right
[54:45] as is important as Jesus Christ was he
[54:48] never saved one person while he was on
[54:49] the earth amen
[54:52] but now he came back on the day of
[54:54] Pentecost and saved 120 and one little
[54:57] WAC and then a 3,000 own down a little
[55:00] bit further that's how the way God wants
[55:03] to work he has messengers along the way
[55:06] to give you a swath fivefold ministry he
[55:09] gives us a fivefold ministry like I said
[55:13] before many of you young people don't
[55:15] know what a roadmap is but I know
[55:16] brother Tommen is just Rebekah know what
[55:18] a roadmap remember the old map said she
[55:20] couldn't ever get back together he still
[55:22] got them okey-dokey then
[55:24] so anyway but what is a road map a road
[55:28] map is folded and if you can't unfold
[55:32] the whole Road map what if you miss
[55:34] about three states and you can't get it
[55:36] all unfolded you don't know where to go
[55:38] but a fivefold ministry when God unfolds
[55:41] that fivefold map you know exactly where
[55:45] you going what brother Graham say it was
[55:48] no where you come from what you're doing
[55:52] here and where you're going now that's
[55:54] to me the plainest this message was
[55:56] given to tell me where I came from the
[55:59] mind of God like brother Dale's talking
[56:01] about how many preachers you ever heard
[56:03] Satan you come from the mind of God
[56:05] before brother Branham nobody but he
[56:11] tells us he said little bride you come
[56:13] from here this is what you're doing here
[56:16] and this is where you're going
[56:19] Esther you got some work to do because
[56:22] you know what I can't go in to see the
[56:24] king but you can so watch what happens
[56:29] now watch let's go down to let's go to
[56:36] verse 13 if you don't learn when
[56:38] Mordecai commanded to answer Esther
[56:40] think not with thyself that thou shalt
[56:43] escape in the king's house more than all
[56:45] the Jews for if thou altogether holdest
[56:48] thy peace in other words if we would
[56:51] have just took brother Browns message
[56:53] and thought he was just another preacher
[56:55] in another line
[56:57] like Larkin and all and not say anything
[56:59] bad about any of them but they didn't
[57:01] have a message this man had a vindicated
[57:05] message Mordecai had a vindicated
[57:08] message but he said in other words
[57:11] without reading this all he's saying
[57:15] Esther if you don't take this serious
[57:19] and go into that King you're gonna die
[57:24] that's what I would have happened if we
[57:27] would have just read you know there's a
[57:28] lot of people and I know what sister
[57:31] clida was in brother Browns meetings and
[57:33] maybe some of the brother Howell Thomas
[57:34] was and maybe some of the other ones
[57:35] were in the meeting broke Tony was in
[57:38] the mean so you saw the prophet of God
[57:41] oh and sister I'm sorry sister Marjorie
[57:44] she said her name's Tootsie not anymore
[57:46] no see anymore I don't know her to see
[57:48] for 60 something years
[57:49] okay sister Marjorie they were there
[57:53] they they watched the prophet work but
[57:55] my point is many people saw that and
[58:01] never went anywhere further he was just
[58:05] a good preacher he had a healing
[58:07] ministry and and and and left right but
[58:12] look at you you we we got people
[58:14] scattered in here and and brother motes
[58:16] saw him brother Joe Canada's own sister
[58:20] Esther
[58:21] dad saw him and and mother saw brother
[58:25] branham and then they went on because
[58:26] they caught the message they caught what
[58:28] Mordechai would say it that if it don't
[58:31] produce a bride if it don't produce a
[58:34] bride you're dead if this thing don't
[58:37] produce a bride they can go into the
[58:39] King I thought the Bible told us we can
[58:41] go boldly to the throne of grace not
[58:44] have to worry about having to sneak in
[58:46] the back door to get in to see the king
[58:49] no sir
[58:51] but now I'm telling you though Mordecai
[58:54] told her right here it says look you got
[58:58] to make a choice verse 14 if thou
[59:03] altogether holdest I peace at this time
[59:04] then shall there enlargement and
[59:07] deliverance arise to the Jews from
[59:09] another place but
[59:11] thou and thy father's house shall be
[59:13] destroyed and who knoweth whether thou
[59:16] art come to the kingdom for such a time
[59:19] as this Mordecai is looking her in the
[59:22] eye and going this is your moment this
[59:25] is your time you were born for this your
[59:31] whole journey has come right down to
[59:32] this right here put your name in that
[59:37] your whole journey brother how you've
[59:39] been in a mess a year sister Clara this
[59:41] is your time Esther this is important
[59:51] listen to what I'm saying who know it's
[59:57] whether thou art come to the kingdom for
[59:58] such a time as this then extra bade them
[1:00:02] return more to count this answer say go
[1:00:06] gather all the Jews that are present in
[1:00:08] the palace and fast you for me neither
[1:00:11] eat nor drink three days neither day and
[1:00:16] I also in my maiden will fast likewise
[1:00:18] because remember if you're not called by
[1:00:21] the king and you walk into his chamber
[1:00:24] you're dead I don't care if your queen
[1:00:27] beautiful everybody got that so listen
[1:00:31] there's an order to go to the king and
[1:00:36] watch what she did I also in my maiden
[1:00:41] will fast like once and so will I go in
[1:00:44] unto the king which is not according to
[1:00:47] the law and if I perish I perish now
[1:00:55] watch
[1:00:56] so Mordecai went his way and did
[1:00:59] according to all that extra had
[1:01:00] commanded him
[1:01:01] so now Esther's in control but now
[1:01:06] Mordecai transferred that power to her
[1:01:07] alright it's you
[1:01:09] you were born for this day and she said
[1:01:11] I'm going in by Dada can we be that sold
[1:01:17] out
[1:01:23] to dial to our self now let's go to
[1:01:28] extra chapter 5 that came to pass on
[1:01:33] here we go
[1:01:34] on the third day that Esther but on her
[1:01:40] royal apparel she dressed right
[1:01:45] she knew listen listen she didn't go in
[1:01:51] there and grab her t-shirt that she had
[1:01:53] been working in the garden with and her
[1:01:57] blue jean skirt then that holds in it
[1:02:01] she knew what the King liked because she
[1:02:05] knew the King no other woman and that
[1:02:08] whole Palace would know exactly how to
[1:02:12] dress except the Queen and she put on
[1:02:16] her apparel that she knew now you'll see
[1:02:20] it in the story in just a minute because
[1:02:21] listen folks
[1:02:22] oh it's thrills my heart Jesus hadn't
[1:02:26] seen his bride in three in two thousand
[1:02:28] years he's never looked he's never put
[1:02:31] physical eyes on his bride humanized to
[1:02:35] humanize he's had to wait 2,000 years
[1:02:39] for us to learn how to dress right for
[1:02:42] us to learn how to act right and for us
[1:02:44] to be able to approach the king because
[1:02:48] when Esther shows herself to the king
[1:02:51] he's not mad he's not saying why didn't
[1:02:57] you do this why didn't you don't do that
[1:02:58] while you've wife I know he longed to
[1:03:02] see her coz watch now it came to pass on
[1:03:06] the third day that extra put on her
[1:03:08] royal apparel and stood in the inner
[1:03:10] court of the king's house over against
[1:03:12] the king's house and the King sat upon
[1:03:14] his royal throne in the royal house over
[1:03:16] against the gate of the house and it was
[1:03:18] so when the King saw Esther the Queen
[1:03:21] standing in the court oh man how could
[1:03:28] he refuse her she was dressed right she
[1:03:33] was on both she was acting right that
[1:03:37] she obtained favor in his sight and the
[1:03:42] King held out to Esther because remember
[1:03:44] if that golden scepter didn't go out and
[1:03:47] if she didn't touch that gold and
[1:03:49] scepter the people standing around the
[1:03:51] King took her and immediately killed her
[1:03:53] but he held out what he hold out he held
[1:03:57] out listen to this that golden scepter
[1:04:03] if you'll go back and look at during
[1:04:05] that time that golden scepter they
[1:04:07] didn't know what it meant but there was
[1:04:10] a cross on top of that golden scepter
[1:04:12] and when he held that scepter out you
[1:04:16] know what he said he said I died for you
[1:04:18] I died for you I'm not gonna kill you I
[1:04:23] died for you I'm so glad to see you I
[1:04:27] can't kill you
[1:04:29] so Esther drew near and touch the top of
[1:04:32] the scepter then said to King unto her
[1:04:34] look what are you doing here what's your
[1:04:38] problem no he said what do you want and
[1:04:48] what is thy request and it shall be even
[1:04:53] now he didn't know what she was doing in
[1:04:55] there but he's ready to give her half
[1:05:00] the kingdom up to half and you know all
[1:05:05] I had to do was say okay you can have
[1:05:06] the kingdom what a mighty God we serve
[1:05:09] because now watch this story we may not
[1:05:12] get we won't get to it today because I'm
[1:05:13] gonna cut it off but we'll get to it
[1:05:15] next week he asked her this three times
[1:05:23] but what happens on the fourth time keep
[1:05:27] reading your Bible about chapter eight
[1:05:29] or nine over in there he says Esther
[1:05:31] what do you want you can have the whole
[1:05:33] kingdom he's offering her half she's in
[1:05:39] her journey but when he gets to the very
[1:05:40] end he's so in love with her he's like
[1:05:43] whatever you want
[1:05:45] you get all this revelation chapter five
[1:05:49] your kings and priests you reign over
[1:05:52] this place it's yours but we have to go
[1:05:57] through a journey then the king said
[1:05:59] inner what will thou Queen Esther what
[1:06:00] is our request and it shall even even
[1:06:04] given thee to the half of the kingdom
[1:06:07] now what's extra do extra is not going
[1:06:10] to say bride he's not going to say this
[1:06:19] Haman guys he's pretty bad if you see
[1:06:25] the underlying meaning Esther has a plan
[1:06:29] because how is the devil gonna be
[1:06:31] destroyed through the king no he's
[1:06:35] already destroyed death how's he gonna
[1:06:39] house house Haman gonna come to his end
[1:06:41] there had to be an Esther to make sure
[1:06:46] that he comes to an end
[1:06:49] you see what you and I that's our
[1:06:53] purpose for being here is to destroy the
[1:06:56] effects of the devil when listen when
[1:06:57] death is destroyed
[1:06:59] in this body you have destroyed the
[1:07:02] devil so Esther is going I want to have
[1:07:07] a feast with you and Haman because I got
[1:07:10] a little story I need to tell you
[1:07:12] so X transfer say if it seemed good
[1:07:14] under the king let the king and Haman
[1:07:16] come this day into the banquet that I
[1:07:19] have prepared for him hmm you think it
[1:07:25] might be a nice feast we'll see here in
[1:07:30] just a second the king sent an Astra at
[1:07:32] the banquet of wine now watch here we go
[1:07:35] here's number to roll it up to number
[1:07:36] six but this is number two where he
[1:07:38] offers her half the kingdom again then
[1:07:41] the King said into a stir at the banquet
[1:07:42] of one what is my petition it shall be
[1:07:45] granted then what is our request even to
[1:07:47] the half of the kingdom that shall be
[1:07:49] performed then Esther then answered
[1:07:52] estrin said my petition and my request
[1:07:55] is this if I have found favor in the
[1:07:59] sign
[1:07:59] to the king and if it please the King to
[1:08:01] grant my petition and to perform my
[1:08:04] request let the king and Haman come to
[1:08:06] the banquet that I shall prepare for
[1:08:08] them and I will do tomorrow as the king
[1:08:11] has said now watch what happened then
[1:08:14] went Haman because I want you to look at
[1:08:18] this and see there's something there's
[1:08:20] something going on we see this because
[1:08:23] we're going to see in Chapter six
[1:08:26] because look Haman went forth that day
[1:08:29] joyful and with a glad heart oh he's
[1:08:32] gonna get to the bride he's gonna get to
[1:08:36] Esther he's gonna come to her feast and
[1:08:39] she's gonna glorify him and she's gonna
[1:08:42] make him so nice of a meal then went
[1:08:47] Haman forth that day joyful with a glad
[1:08:49] heart but when Haman saw Mordecai
[1:08:51] here we go
[1:08:51] in the Kings gate that he stood not up
[1:08:55] nor moved for him listen brother branham
[1:08:58] didn't compromise on nothing he knew who
[1:09:02] the devil was knew what his tactic was
[1:09:04] and he never bowed down to him nor moved
[1:09:07] for him he was full of evening nation
[1:09:09] against more to come nevertheless Haman
[1:09:11] refrained himself then he came home and
[1:09:13] he went to see his with a wifey and
[1:09:15] started crying well why does he do he
[1:09:20] what's his wife his churches he went to
[1:09:24] his churches Satan went home to his
[1:09:26] churches and he starts giving them this
[1:09:28] pill and Haman told them of the glory of
[1:09:31] his riches in the multitude of his
[1:09:33] children and all the things were in the
[1:09:36] King had promoted him because he he
[1:09:37] thinks he's really going to get promoted
[1:09:39] him and how he had advanced him above
[1:09:41] the princes and servants of the King and
[1:09:44] God did God put Satan in a place y'all
[1:09:47] don't you understand that Satan had a
[1:09:49] position beyond the brother brother said
[1:09:52] all but creation Satan could do so
[1:09:57] that's pretty powerful but you see what
[1:10:00] he done he allowed Satan to do that so
[1:10:03] that you and I could come forth but he
[1:10:04] had to make him a redeemer to make him
[1:10:07] what this King is fixing to redeem a
[1:10:08] group of people that are fixing to be
[1:10:10] killed because of Haman
[1:10:13] and Heyman said moreover yeah after the
[1:10:16] Queen didn't let no man come in with the
[1:10:18] King into the banquet that she is
[1:10:19] prepared but myself and tomorrow I'm
[1:10:26] gonna be the head dog and DeMar am I
[1:10:31] invited unto her also with the King yet
[1:10:35] all this availeth mean nothing so long
[1:10:38] as I see that Mordecai the Jew sitting
[1:10:41] at the Kings gate listen folks don't you
[1:10:45] think Satan was fat and happy during the
[1:10:47] ages when all the denominations came in
[1:10:49] and and they started baptizing them
[1:10:52] wrong and they started to have at least
[1:10:53] folks Satan was just like I mean he's
[1:10:55] like I had no gran here I got them all
[1:10:58] whipped and then God sends a little
[1:11:01] prophet and in about the 30s and the 40s
[1:11:03] and the 50s he starts having healing
[1:11:04] campaigns and knocking the devil in the
[1:11:06] head and and then in the 60s when the
[1:11:10] seals open that's a whole something
[1:11:13] Satan ain't got a thing to deal with to
[1:11:15] do with don't you think it made him mad
[1:11:17] sure it made him mad but he went back to
[1:11:20] his denominational wife and he's telling
[1:11:22] them says look we're gonna do something
[1:11:25] here and we're gonna kill this guy
[1:11:26] let a gal be made of 50 cubits tomorrow
[1:11:30] speaking to the king that Mordecai maybe
[1:11:32] hang to their own then go thou merrily
[1:11:34] with the king into the banquet and the
[1:11:36] theme please Haman now who said that his
[1:11:38] wife his church his church says aye
[1:11:43] you go out there and tell that william
[1:11:46] branham got he he's not invited in our
[1:11:48] churches no more okay and the theme
[1:11:51] please Haman and he calls the gallows to
[1:11:53] be made so watch Esther chapter 6 what's
[1:11:56] what happens so what happens is in the
[1:12:01] story and we'll stop right here because
[1:12:04] I don't want to be too long we got a
[1:12:05] long day today because I want to wait
[1:12:07] till we get to chapter 7 Ryan wants to
[1:12:09] look at chapter 7 chapter 7 we see
[1:12:12] something happen in chapter 8 the sevens
[1:12:14] in the eighth
[1:12:15] alright so chapter six on that night
[1:12:18] could not the king sleep and he
[1:12:20] commanded to bring the book of records
[1:12:22] of Chronicles and they were read before
[1:12:24] the king
[1:12:24] now remember
[1:12:26] back in the story Mordecai had listened
[1:12:29] to these two people that were going to
[1:12:30] kill the king they conspired to kill the
[1:12:33] king
[1:12:33] and Mordecai brought it to the attention
[1:12:35] of the king through the Chamberlain's
[1:12:37] through the preachers that there was
[1:12:39] something going to happen and they were
[1:12:42] going to kill this king so verse three
[1:12:45] says then the king said what honor and
[1:12:47] dignity have been done to Mordecai for
[1:12:49] this in other words has anybody done
[1:12:51] anything for this guy he saved my life
[1:12:55] he saved my whole church he saved my
[1:13:00] bride he saved a lot of things and then
[1:13:03] everybody around him said well there
[1:13:05] ain't nothing been done for him and the
[1:13:07] King said who is in the court now watch
[1:13:09] the devil is always around somewhere
[1:13:13] he's always right there in the court
[1:13:16] remember he's the accuser of the
[1:13:17] Brethren remember so he can get an
[1:13:19] audience with God when sometimes we
[1:13:20] think we can't but remember you're a
[1:13:23] child of God there's a difference you're
[1:13:26] a child of God and the King said who's
[1:13:28] in the court now Haman was coming to the
[1:13:30] outward Court of the king now why is he
[1:13:32] coming for he's going to convince the
[1:13:35] King to hang Mordecai on the gallows
[1:13:41] that he had already made all the little
[1:13:44] traps that the devil has for all of us
[1:13:47] remember brother Branham said money
[1:13:50] women in popularity you're going to get
[1:13:52] trapped by one of them but he never was
[1:13:54] and the king's servants said unto Him
[1:13:57] behold Haman standeth in the court and
[1:13:59] the King said let him come in so Haman
[1:14:02] come in and the King said unto him what
[1:14:04] shall be done into the man whom the King
[1:14:05] delighted to honor
[1:14:06] now Haman thought he's fixing to do
[1:14:09] something for me he's fixing to give me
[1:14:12] a crown I'm his right-hand guy there is
[1:14:17] no other can't be it can't be that's
[1:14:19] scourge out there Mordecai can't be that
[1:14:21] guy and Haman thought in his heart to
[1:14:24] whom with the King delight to do honor
[1:14:26] more than me now if you don't believe
[1:14:33] Haman is gonna hang yourself you don't
[1:14:36] believe the devil is gonna hang yourself
[1:14:39] watch this story and Haman answered the
[1:14:41] King for the man whom the King delighted
[1:14:43] to honor let the royal apparel be
[1:14:46] brought which the King used it to wear
[1:14:48] and in other words the finest horse in
[1:14:51] Arabia that the King rides on and the
[1:14:55] crown royal which was set upon he's
[1:14:57] fixing to give him the Kings apparel not
[1:15:01] just some Lord or some little no King
[1:15:06] stuff and let this apparently I just put
[1:15:11] it on him now I want people to see me
[1:15:15] Haman riding on this horse with the
[1:15:18] crown and I want people to glorify me
[1:15:22] you see where Satan fell from and let
[1:15:25] this apparel and the horse be delivered
[1:15:28] to the hand of one of the Kings most
[1:15:30] noble princess that they may have read
[1:15:34] this man with all whom the King
[1:15:36] delighteth to honor and bring him on
[1:15:38] horseback through the streets of the
[1:15:39] city and let him go around the world
[1:15:41] seven times and proclaim before him thus
[1:15:49] shall it be done to the man whom the
[1:15:51] king delighted to honor then the king
[1:15:54] said good idea make haste
[1:16:00] don't wait Lamar make haste and take
[1:16:02] that apparel and that horse as thou has
[1:16:04] said and do even soda can you hear the
[1:16:11] balloon go tous remember listen in this
[1:16:20] whole story y'all don't don't forget
[1:16:22] Satan thinks he's got the upper hand
[1:16:24] even now he thinks he can destroy all
[1:16:27] the way down to almost to the future
[1:16:29] home he still thinks he can win this
[1:16:31] thing if he can accuse enough other
[1:16:34] people but God's gonna use him to
[1:16:40] display his bride
[1:16:42] then took Haman while anyway that
[1:16:45] sitteth at the Kings gate let nothing
[1:16:46] fail of all the tile has spoken I bet
[1:16:49] you he if he could eat his words then
[1:16:52] took Haman the apparel and the horse
[1:16:56] don't you think he hated putting that on
[1:16:58] Mordecai don't you think he hated
[1:17:00] putting him up on that horse and guess
[1:17:03] what he's the guy that led them through
[1:17:06] the city and brought him on horseback
[1:17:10] through the street of the city and
[1:17:11] proclaimed before him the celebi done
[1:17:13] another man who became to lies the owner
[1:17:15] and Mordecai came again to the Kings
[1:17:17] gate but Haman hasted to his house bless
[1:17:20] his heart was you I was you woo the
[1:17:23] jewels things and having his head
[1:17:25] covered that's the way I want the devil
[1:17:28] to be I want him to tuck tail and run I
[1:17:32] don't want him nowhere around me and
[1:17:35] Haman cáceres his wife and all his
[1:17:37] friends everything that had befallen him
[1:17:39] crying big tears then said his wise men
[1:17:42] azerath his wife if Mordecai be at the
[1:17:45] seat of the Jews before before whom thou
[1:17:48] has begun to fall thou shalt not prevail
[1:17:52] against him but shall surely fall before
[1:17:55] him and while they were yet talking to
[1:17:58] him came to King's Chamberlain's and
[1:18:01] hasted to bring Haman into the banquet
[1:18:03] that Esther had prepared now remember
[1:18:05] they're fit he's got to go to a banquet
[1:18:07] now with Esther and the king it just
[1:18:13] gets worse and worse and better for us
[1:18:19] but worse for them but let's just read
[1:18:23] this just for a minute and we'll close
[1:18:24] right here so the king and Haman came to
[1:18:27] the banquet with Esther the Queen
[1:18:32] because remember in the seventh church
[1:18:37] age Satan is destroyed right through the
[1:18:42] message of the hour through the bride of
[1:18:43] Jesus Christ Satan is destroyed has no
[1:18:46] effect on us supposed to not be when we
[1:18:48] come to this position of adoption and on
[1:18:51] to the change of the body so watch this
[1:18:53] Esther chapter 7
[1:18:55] we'll read this and then we'll be
[1:18:56] finished we'll pick the rest up next
[1:18:59] week so the king and Haman came to
[1:19:02] banquet with Esther the Queen and the
[1:19:04] King said again into Esther on the
[1:19:06] second day of the banquet of wine what
[1:19:08] is that position position Queen Esther
[1:19:10] and it shall be granted unto them what
[1:19:12] is our request it shall be performed
[1:19:14] even to the half of the kingdom that was
[1:19:17] the third time he said that everybody
[1:19:20] got that that was the third time that he
[1:19:23] made mention hmm the third time then
[1:19:32] Esther the Queen answered and said if I
[1:19:34] have found favor in thy sight O king and
[1:19:36] if it please the King let my life be
[1:19:38] given me at my petition and my people ah
[1:19:43] revelation he's fixing to tell the King
[1:19:47] she's fixing to tell the King she's a
[1:19:49] Jew but he loved her so much he didn't
[1:19:55] care remember we flipped that to the
[1:19:57] other side we're Gentiles we're dogs we
[1:20:00] were not we were not we didn't have no
[1:20:01] we don't have any inheritance but when
[1:20:05] God married us that's when we got an
[1:20:07] inheritance for we are sold I and my
[1:20:11] people to be destroyed to be slain into
[1:20:14] perish but if we had been sold for
[1:20:16] bombing and bond women I had held my
[1:20:18] tongue
[1:20:18] although the enemy could not counter
[1:20:20] veil the Kings damage so then what he
[1:20:24] said we'll wait a minute what have I
[1:20:26] done
[1:20:27] in other words then the King a source
[1:20:29] answered to senator Esther the Queen who
[1:20:30] is he and where is he that Durst presume
[1:20:33] in his heart to do this because where is
[1:20:36] all this mysterious coming from it's
[1:20:38] coming from Satan's heart it's coming
[1:20:42] from the devil now remember King asaurus
[1:20:46] God can't change his word the law of the
[1:20:50] Medes and Persians you cannot want the
[1:20:52] laws been written you can't change it
[1:20:54] and if you take this by just the letter
[1:20:57] it will kill you this Bible will either
[1:21:00] send you to heaven or I'll send you to
[1:21:01] hell one of the two all right because
[1:21:04] God can't change it because of your
[1:21:07] little situation or mine
[1:21:09] but watch what he says right here real
[1:21:11] quick and Esther said the adversary and
[1:21:13] the enemy is this wicked Haman now
[1:21:17] listen the King never questioned her one
[1:21:22] time he believed what she said then
[1:21:29] Haman was afraid for the King and before
[1:21:32] the king and the Queen so that's what we
[1:21:34] do we expose the devil and the King
[1:21:38] arising from the bank of the wine in his
[1:21:40] wrath went into the palace garden and
[1:21:42] Haman stood up to make requests for his
[1:21:45] life to the king Oh what's your Bible
[1:21:52] say sister Trudy oh he didn't even
[1:21:56] country it listen if it had been me I
[1:21:59] went to the game cuz that dudes the ones
[1:22:02] with the power Yeah right
[1:22:05] he knew though if he could change the
[1:22:07] extras mind he could she could change
[1:22:11] the Kings mind so he's coming to the
[1:22:14] bride to try to make us change our mind
[1:22:19] about his word and Haman stood up to
[1:22:22] make requests for his life too Esther
[1:22:24] the Queen for he saw that there was evil
[1:22:27] determined against him by the king then
[1:22:31] the King returned out of the palace
[1:22:32] garden into the place of the banquet of
[1:22:34] wine and what did Haman do he fell down
[1:22:36] in the bed trying to get in bed with
[1:22:38] Esther and I just made God worse man
[1:22:45] that wasn't good English was it Oh point
[1:22:50] ya got spawn cross Bennett Haman was
[1:22:53] falling he's bagging a stir
[1:22:56] he knows his end is near like the devil
[1:23:01] now he knows his end is near then said
[1:23:04] the king will he force the Queen before
[1:23:06] me in my own house as the word went out
[1:23:12] of the Kings mouth they covered
[1:23:14] Heyman's face now when you cover
[1:23:18] somebody's face its execution
[1:23:23] always always and harbona one of the
[1:23:28] Chamberlain said before they came behold
[1:23:30] also the gap
[1:23:30] hey we got a Gallo out here where that
[1:23:33] come from the devil built it but the
[1:23:38] devil built all this which Haman made
[1:23:41] for Mordecai who had spoken good for the
[1:23:43] King standeth in the house of Haman then
[1:23:45] the king said hang him their own so they
[1:23:49] hanged Haman on the gallows that he had
[1:23:51] prepared for Mordecai then was the
[1:23:54] King's wrath pacified the Devils got it
[1:24:01] coming to him folks and it's not coming
[1:24:05] from the king it's coming from the Queen
[1:24:10] because the Queen right now to me on
[1:24:13] this earth is the most powerful force
[1:24:16] there is is the bride of Jesus Christ on
[1:24:20] this earth today musicians come and then
[1:24:26] we'll continue the story because look
[1:24:28] Louis chapter 8 was they mean eternity
[1:24:31] we're gonna go into something here in
[1:24:32] just a minute
[1:24:33] because remember the ring that he gave
[1:24:36] to Haman he's fixing to give it to
[1:24:39] somebody else
[1:24:40] because he's got some more confidence in
[1:24:44] this man named Mordecai and then we're
[1:24:49] gonna see it's kind of real it's not
[1:24:53] funny but we're not finished with Haman
[1:24:57] exactly because he had ten sons ten that
[1:25:07] was ten preachers twelve preachers went
[1:25:09] across the promised land right never
[1:25:11] mind sermon I preached a long time ago
[1:25:12] on ten line preachers they get hung to
[1:25:17] so God's gonna listen God's gonna purge
[1:25:20] this thing how is he gonna do it by the
[1:25:22] bride of Jesus Christ no one else and we
[1:25:26] know you say well you're making God not
[1:25:28] important he's standing back he said
[1:25:32] Esther you prepare a feast after
[1:25:36] I'm gonna bring this person in here he
[1:25:39] says hey you get half the kingdom
[1:25:41] whatever you want and then we're gonna
[1:25:43] see just about two more chapters from
[1:25:45] now Kings gonna turn around and say what
[1:25:48] do you want the whole kingdom is yours
[1:25:51] listen this world is not my home I'm
[1:25:55] just a passing through my treasures are
[1:25:58] laid up but you know what it is it's not
[1:26:00] somewhere beyond the blue we had a
[1:26:02] prophet remind us that we're coming back
[1:26:04] to here sister Marjorie this is our home
[1:26:09] Haman is a squatter it's not his Haman
[1:26:16] thought he was so powerful he only had
[1:26:19] permitted power Satan only has permitted
[1:26:22] power to do what he needs to do but it
[1:26:25] all goes for the glory of Almighty God
[1:26:28] through the bride of Jesus Christ let's
[1:26:30] stand to our feet god bless you I just
[1:26:35] love the book of Esther eyes just a man
[1:26:37] got all kind of good nuggets in it no go
[1:26:40] ahead
[1:26:40] let's sing a song I was saying you came
[1:26:48] from the
[1:26:50] me how we gave it life long cavalry to
[1:26:56] save a wretch like me
[1:27:02] is ruining this precious blood tone you
[1:27:09] know he did all that though so he could
[1:27:11] transfer all that power over to his
[1:27:14] little queen his little bride in the end
[1:27:16] time it was looking
[1:27:22] he was looking at me and you to finish
[1:27:26] this thing up he's looking for an answer
[1:27:29] to not be afraid to walk into the palace
[1:27:32] and to boldly come before the throne of
[1:27:35] God and to ask your petition not half of
[1:27:39] what you need but all that you need
[1:27:42] anything you need today you just ask God
[1:27:46] you ask your king extra just ask and you
[1:27:54] shall receive
[1:27:55] [Music]
[1:27:59] [Applause]
[1:28:02] how we made a lane to walk again you'll
[1:28:06] abort any cause of life to see and then
[1:28:12] I cried
[1:28:13] dear Jesus Lord helmet
[1:28:17] guns baron yourself says somehow but we
[1:28:24] know how we know how he did it all
[1:28:29] victory in Jesus my Savior forever he
[1:28:38] saw me and he bought me with his
[1:28:42] redeeming love he loved me ere I knew
[1:28:49] him
[1:28:50] Hey
[1:28:54] people lunge me brother branham tell us
[1:29:00] what is God's victory it's the bride
[1:29:02] it's us
[1:29:04] we are his victory it's an old story
[1:29:09] about a man dying on a cross but unless
[1:29:11] he's made real - me and you it's just
[1:29:14] they hung many people that day the next
[1:29:17] day and the day after there was people
[1:29:19] hung every day or put on a tree at
[1:29:23] Calvary but that guy he was special he
[1:29:28] could come back and get inside of
[1:29:30] somebody the rest of them died and went
[1:29:32] on away and history didn't even talk
[1:29:35] about him they just grew their body over
[1:29:36] into a pit and covering them up but this
[1:29:39] man walked out on the third day he
[1:29:45] walked out of that tomb and he said all
[1:29:47] power in heaven and earth been given
[1:29:49] unto me and I'm fixing to transfer it to
[1:29:52] a group of people just several days
[1:29:55] later on the day of Pentecost
[1:30:00] you know if if the devil would have been
[1:30:03] smart he could have just let Jesus live
[1:30:08] well Tom he could just let Jesus live
[1:30:11] and he would just live this life on out
[1:30:13] and heat some worry they had to die cold
[1:30:15] his body wasn't eternal but Heyman
[1:30:17] couldn't stand it he had to think he was
[1:30:21] in control he had to say if I can get
[1:30:26] that man and get him a pen kill him I
[1:30:28] got him whipped he just didn't realize
[1:30:32] that was part of the plan that that King
[1:30:36] did get on the cross and die for me and
[1:30:39] you
[1:30:41] and then a few days later several weeks
[1:30:44] later 50 days and a damn Pentecost
[1:30:47] guess what he had to deal with 120
[1:30:51] little jesus' and then they went out and
[1:30:55] preached a sermon and three thousand
[1:30:57] although jesus' were born everything
[1:30:59] satan touches he just can't get it right
[1:31:03] but that's the same way with that look
[1:31:05] how that calamity of Haman how he went
[1:31:07] through and thought all this whole time
[1:31:09] he was gonna be put right here and God
[1:31:13] the whole time knew he would trap his
[1:31:15] own self and get hung on the same trap
[1:31:17] that he had made
[1:31:18] [Music]
[1:31:19] Satan's a bluff he has no power except
[1:31:25] what we give it to him and you need to
