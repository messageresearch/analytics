[26:15] down to really some good eating after
[26:17] the service is over with but looking
[26:19] forward to brother long and the message
[26:21] and the Lord would bless us and we've
[26:25] had a wonderful year so to bring it to a
[26:27] close would be a great thing but now we
[26:29] appreciate it
[26:30] amen but if you like turning your
[26:34] scriptures turn to Jonah two and nine
[26:38] and then we'll go to 1st John one we're
[26:44] already getting phone calls and things
[26:46] that this ain't working
[26:47] well sorry about that
[26:49] do the best we can to get everything to
[26:52] working you know that John will go to -
[26:56] Jonah first and we'll go to first John
[26:58] one you have any father we thank you for
[27:01] your grace Lord and your love unto each
[27:03] and every one of us thank you for all
[27:05] the things that you've given us Lord
[27:07] this has been a marvelous year wonderful
[27:10] timing you Lord and we're coming down to
[27:12] the gaining of the closing of the year
[27:14] but we're looking for whatever a moment
[27:16] to seeing that the coming of the Lord
[27:18] and all the things that we Lord know
[27:22] that I right ahead of us we look forward
[27:24] to it we praise your great name just
[27:27] bless all of those that are not here
[27:28] tonight I know sister Esther still
[27:31] having problems with their operation and
[27:34] everything so just reach down and touch
[27:36] these all the others all the ones that
[27:38] are not here Lord we pray that you would
[27:41] bless each one forgive our sins and
[27:43] guide us in Jesus name okay we've been
[27:48] on Jonah 2 and 9 but I will sacrifice
[27:54] unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving
[27:57] I will pay that that I have vowed
[28:01] salvation is of the Lord and the Lord
[28:04] spake unto the feast and it vomited out
[28:05] Jonah upon the dry land let's go over to
[28:12] John and kind of pick up this and I hope
[28:17] to get this far to where we can deal
[28:19] with the two parts it will be but would
[28:22] be in John 1 and we'll start reading at
[28:27] verse 4 of John 1 then we'll go right on
[28:32] into reading in John 2 okay and these
[28:37] things write we unto you that your joy
[28:39] may be full
[28:41] this then is the message now once this
[28:44] this is the message which we have heard
[28:47] of him and declare unto you
[28:49] the God is light and in him is no
[28:52] darkness at all if we say that we have
[28:54] fellowship with him and walk in darkness
[28:56] we lie and do not the truth but if we
[29:00] walk in the light as he is in the light
[29:02] we have fellowship
[29:02] one with another and the blood of Jesus
[29:05] Christ His Son cleanses us from what
[29:08] from all sin well I thought we
[29:12] Christians didn't have no sin I thought
[29:15] that's what everybody thought maybe
[29:17] we've missed a point right all right now
[29:20] watch if we say we have no sin we
[29:25] deceive ourselves and the truth is not
[29:29] in us if we confess our sins he is
[29:32] faithful and just to forgive us our sins
[29:34] and to cleanse us from all
[29:36] unrighteousness if we say that we have
[29:39] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[29:42] word is not in us going to chapter 2 now
[29:46] my little children these things write I
[29:47] unto you that you sin not and if any man
[29:51] sin we have an advocate with the father
[29:55] Jesus Christ the righteous he is the
[29:58] perpetuation for our sins and not for
[30:01] our sins only but also for the sins of
[30:04] the whole world you may be seated unless
[30:08] they would go ahead but just go ahead
[30:10] that'll be far enough if we get there
[30:13] anyway but now we've been talking about
[30:18] salvation and saying what it means and
[30:22] looking back in the Old Testament that
[30:24] salvation coming to the new I thought
[30:27] that the day would be the ending of the
[30:30] services you know on that say the Old
[30:32] Testament we begin into the New
[30:34] Testament but I want to make sure you
[30:36] don't misunderstand me and what I'm
[30:39] trying to express unto you so it
[30:43] shouldn't be any problem for me to
[30:45] repeat myself you know bringing it on
[30:49] into the right thing and all these cell
[30:52] phones are sure hidden or denied no
[31:06] problem yeah we talked about
[31:12] an unconditional covenant in talking
[31:15] about salvation you know an
[31:18] unconditional covenant now ask the
[31:22] question and repeatedly ask the question
[31:25] there the life service about what is an
[31:30] unconditional covenant he said well it's
[31:35] just a covenant with no conditions
[31:40] well that's does that leave it then I'm
[31:47] repeating back over to make sure you
[31:49] follow me does that leave it then that
[31:53] we can just live like we want to you
[31:59] know and still say that we're saved I
[32:05] thought the way we lived and the things
[32:08] that was in our lives had a reaction or
[32:13] action back upon God and his ways and
[32:18] and things and I don't want you to get
[32:22] lost in thinking about something and so
[32:26] you just say well well it's an
[32:29] unconditional covenant we'll just
[32:30] remember now first off see you can break
[32:34] it down and watch our point now he made
[32:38] an unconditional covenant with Abraham
[32:41] and his seed all right but that had
[32:47] nothing to do he made no covenant Darr
[32:50] about eternal life it couldn't come
[32:54] forth right eternal life could not be in
[32:59] question in the Old Testament form
[33:02] because how could it be how could you
[33:06] have eternal life before Christ had ever
[33:09] come to pay the price I mean is that
[33:12] sensible or there's a common thought
[33:16] that should have been in our thinking
[33:18] all the way through that surely we
[33:21] wouldn't in any way think well well you
[33:24] know
[33:25] I know that I have problems now and we
[33:29] all have problems and and and you think
[33:32] you don't have problems and and you
[33:35] think you don't do wrong
[33:38] well if you're going to say it that way
[33:41] may I agree with you
[33:44] because that it puts you in two classes
[33:47] as you order sit down and listen if
[33:50] that's the situation you're trying to
[33:52] condemn me with you're admitting where
[33:55] you're at
[33:57] I'm sorry that's brother to hell you
[34:00] you're admitting where you're at if
[34:03] you're trying to condemn the other
[34:04] person or bring that person to a
[34:06] position of thinking about well none of
[34:11] us are perfect no we're not perfect but
[34:17] if we're forgiving then you never done
[34:20] it and what's more perfect can be where
[34:25] do we get down to the little word
[34:26] righteousness and see what it really
[34:30] means but think about it now remembers I
[34:36] said he made the Covenant Adam in the
[34:42] land and the things and Adam failed he's
[34:47] picking up showing it toward the seed
[34:49] comes over into Noah and it's not a
[34:54] promise about giving a certain amount of
[34:57] land or anything that's done been saying
[35:01] it was from here to here to here and
[35:03] then when he comes back to Abraham he
[35:06] just refers to that because if you read
[35:08] in Genesis you'll see that this they had
[35:11] that place and it was set aside and the
[35:13] way whether it's the river Euphrates run
[35:15] out and went down and all of that land
[35:17] all right so it's not talking about
[35:21] salvation
[35:21] it's typing salvation it's the type of
[35:25] salvation for you and I we're not
[35:29] interested in land we're not interested
[35:32] in all the seed doctrines and ideas
[35:34] we're interested in the Word of God all
[35:38] right so all of that
[35:39] just a time coming down to where we are
[35:42] all right is everybody with me now
[35:44] all right see now we talk about and we
[35:47] say quoting it did Adam had a coven of
[35:51] the conditions that bug stays up there
[35:57] and has Noah had a covenant with
[36:02] conditions who we say well Abraham had a
[36:07] covenant a broom or whatever you want
[36:09] technically he said well he never had no
[36:13] conditions would didn't could he live
[36:17] just in any life in any form and still
[36:27] be alright I will remind you that the
[36:36] children of Israel which comes down from
[36:39] Abraham to Isaac to Jacob then he's
[36:42] changed to Israel the children of Israel
[36:46] were sent into bondage a lot of times am
[36:54] i right
[36:55] I thought it was unconditional the come
[37:06] on they lost the land to get it back
[37:10] they'd lose Atlanta get it back now just
[37:15] remember they never lost your covenant
[37:19] they lost the joy of it the happiness of
[37:23] it the dwelling of it but yet they were
[37:25] in bondage constantly and even
[37:29] prophesied in the Covenant that we
[37:32] talked about to Abram in Genesis 15 and
[37:37] told how long they were going to be
[37:39] under bondage
[37:46] brother dado I thought I understood a
[37:48] lot of things until you start talking
[37:51] what do you know what that means my
[37:55] brother al said one time he said why
[37:57] don't you look over and let brother Dale
[37:58] talk you out what you believe this is
[38:01] because we can talk you out of it it's
[38:02] not a revelation right good point but
[38:09] think about it now was Adam and Noah on
[38:15] a conditional Abraham unconditional so
[38:25] yeah that's what the Prophet said amen
[38:30] see they love stur part of dwelling but
[38:35] they never lost what God told them they
[38:41] would have which was the land number one
[38:43] they might not have it right now but
[38:46] when they were down there under bondage
[38:48] in Egypt they could say Abraham our
[38:54] Father says we're going out of here and
[38:59] we're going to get that land well you
[39:01] know what they did it they might have
[39:04] lost it because of sin right but they
[39:10] got it back they will get it back knee
[39:13] in time right there's our nail and our
[39:18] president just made it to her Jerusalem
[39:22] would be the capital no other president
[39:26] no were would attempt to do that if I
[39:32] differed with him and everything in the
[39:34] world I'd hug his neck for that I'd want
[39:37] him to twist his hair Oh decide where we
[39:38] get stuck with it but that's all I see
[39:42] is her ain't got none you don't want to
[39:45] worry about all right now listen it was
[39:52] never made with Abraham and them as a
[39:55] point of salvation are you listening
[39:59] it was typing salvation you know until
[40:04] my eternal life coming in time the end
[40:07] it was a promise of the land and the
[40:10] seed all right and under that promise
[40:13] that kept emphasizing it under that
[40:15] promise they had a place to go to when
[40:18] they died the place go paradise right
[40:23] all right
[40:24] but now did you catch the point of
[40:27] trying to emphasize the life service
[40:30] that the code that was never made with
[40:33] nobody but Abraham and his seed hey come
[40:40] on now listen don't think I don't know
[40:41] the scripture you know I said thank to
[40:44] the Bible says you know that the nations
[40:47] will be blessed because of you they are
[40:50] the nations of the world today are
[40:52] blessed because Israel is here but that
[40:55] don't save them and that don't make them
[40:57] part of the Covenant all right so don't
[41:00] just run out ahead then you sit down and
[41:02] listen I'll cover that when it gets
[41:04] because I like to pick them things out
[41:06] because I can see them you know I'm kind
[41:12] of get to contact with the people with
[41:14] it with that okay so it's not made with
[41:17] everybody because salvation is not made
[41:21] for every now whatever come on
[41:23] salvation is for everybody right but how
[41:26] come nobody how come the people won't
[41:28] have it right we're gonna get to
[41:30] something in a minute let's think about
[41:33] why did he make it only with Abram and
[41:42] really technically he takes it from
[41:44] Abram now if you want to go through the
[41:46] scripture we don't have moanin internet
[41:48] we kind of put everything we can on
[41:49] there where somebody else could pull it
[41:51] down but we're not gonna use the board
[41:53] as much all right but just remember he
[41:58] made the promise to Abram and his seed
[42:02] right specifying that his seed would be
[42:08] Isaac and not a small
[42:11] Abraham but around said we gave it there
[42:14] only makes each other day he had 11
[42:17] children sons and daughter
[42:18] our sons it's more than that there was
[42:25] no problems today it was only to Abram
[42:31] the Isaac to Jacob and kept coming down
[42:38] to Joseph coming through and coming out
[42:41] to Christ right we'll get to that later
[42:49] they're true Nancy it's not promised to
[42:51] everybody you said you don't know it's
[42:58] far everybody but everybody won't have
[43:01] it right anybody can have it if they'll
[43:08] it accept it but now my emphasis has
[43:19] been one thing why did he give April now
[43:27] to say Abram because it technically was
[43:29] Abram until they bruh happen why was
[43:32] that given to him and no one else I come
[43:43] up there with a whole world full of
[43:44] people don't you think there's some good
[43:46] people in that time why did he not
[43:51] choose to give it now listen okay here
[43:55] comes another one of them little truth
[43:57] why was it not chosen to give to one of
[44:00] the prophets
[44:04] well he could have moved he couldn't
[44:06] okay why was it not chosen to give to
[44:10] one of the prophets now we believe
[44:13] Abraham was a prophet right because the
[44:15] Prophet said he was okay that's what I
[44:18] believed it because I can't read the
[44:19] Bible that he was but I believe it
[44:23] but why did he give it to Abram and not
[44:29] to nobody else in the world you don't
[44:35] mow those things through your cranium
[44:38] cap that's the reason I like to hunt
[44:42] because I'm not listening to this and
[44:44] listening to that and everything else I
[44:47] can sit down just think and just
[44:52] sometimes have a good time
[44:55] Lord spoke to me Tuesday going down
[44:58] let's see what's a Monday and I got
[45:03] about halfway down the road I said Lord
[45:05] I could turn around drive back home go
[45:06] home visit happy I'll go down there and
[45:09] sit and have a good time I don't care
[45:12] what kill anything or not this helped me
[45:15] a good time because I've already got
[45:16] what I wanted it's what he spoke to me
[45:19] about alright then we'll put that
[45:22] together the Lord willing this coming
[45:24] Saturday and try to bring the point all
[45:30] right but listen why would God give it
[45:36] to Abram there's some reason I mean is
[45:47] that right there's some reason that he
[45:50] gave it y-yeah why didn't he give it to
[45:59] Noah
[46:05] you know the Bible says we don't like
[46:07] Noah too well but you know the Bible
[46:09] said that he wasn't up just an upright
[46:12] man he was a truly believer in God why
[46:21] didn't God give this unconditional
[46:23] covenant to Enoch I'm just asking a
[46:33] simple question I just want a simple
[46:36] answer there's got to be some reason
[46:39] right now God never does anything
[46:44] without a reason we'll get to it we're
[46:49] brother Branham said you know if God
[46:50] ever repeats his step so when he said
[46:54] that verily verily I say unto you you
[46:57] know what brother Owen said you better
[46:58] listen there's something right there
[47:02] that when he repeats itself Lord spoke
[47:06] to me and he said I thought well that's
[47:07] in the scripture I checked it out is
[47:10] exactly four of them you know but why
[47:15] did God give to Abram an unconditional
[47:23] covenant and we've already our should
[47:29] have already established within our
[47:32] thinking if not we won't establish it
[47:34] anyway so that's all right then he's not
[47:38] saying Abram I'm gonna save you I don't
[47:43] care what you do is that the kind of is
[47:49] that what we think that's a good old
[47:54] Baptist once saved always saved now how
[48:00] could it be on that basis when if I'm
[48:06] quoting brother Branham you've got error
[48:10] - for one person anything another person
[48:14] receives it reaches that same position
[48:15] he's
[48:16] to give it to them RS he done wrong to
[48:19] start with huh now if he gives it to
[48:25] apron why didn't he give it to a nook if
[48:34] he gave it to and why didn't give it to
[48:36] know why didn't he I just want you to
[48:40] think to get away from our dollars you
[48:47] say yeah I never thought we could just
[48:49] get by with anything well why would you
[48:54] want to talk about an unconditional
[48:55] cousin what was the reason that God
[49:02] chose Abraham or Abram what was the
[49:06] reason you know God never does anything
[49:14] without a reason but why does he do it -
[49:19] what he does it I thought the reason
[49:22] that God does everything the same all
[49:24] the time - word that his word would
[49:26] never you know mess up her cross each
[49:29] other or whatever and it would come out
[49:31] into perfect order that was what I
[49:36] thought about it I thought that way then
[49:38] whatever he says one time
[49:45] if we put it on free moral agency of a
[49:50] covenant and I'm looking to quote and we
[49:53] put it in the wrong way then what are
[49:55] you gonna do with Adam what are you
[50:01] gonna do with Noah brother Brown says if
[50:04] he gives one something and don't give it
[50:06] to the other one see your work you're
[50:11] one of these days you'll listen to what
[50:13] I try to say to you without trying to
[50:16] figure it out
[50:18] grace was before Adam Grace was before
[50:23] Noah and grace was before Abraham and if
[50:31] there was ever any salvation old or new
[50:38] God before the foundation of the world
[50:43] could predestinate that to take place
[50:48] for the time and how does God
[50:57] predestinate not by desires now cuz he
[51:02] deserted everybody B say anything
[51:08] predestination according to the
[51:10] scripture that says those who he for no
[51:14] he did predestinate I like know better
[51:20] than you you know because that new means
[51:24] like something evident but no means a
[51:25] personal I know I love that whenever a
[51:30] funeral joke said I know my Redeemer
[51:35] liveth
[51:36] do you know are you just knew about a
[51:40] redeemer
[51:41] he's just heard the story he's just
[51:43] listened to the tales that's been told
[51:45] you or do you know the charisma God and
[51:51] did he cannot cross his word that's
[51:53] right
[51:54] he can't tell one person one thing
[51:56] another than another one we said what
[51:58] what he did without a brother and he did
[52:00] what would know of them know because
[52:03] grace has done to her come on you didn't
[52:05] listen to the message
[52:06] grace was already there before Abraham
[52:10] come on the scene
[52:11] so Abraham say by grace through faith
[52:14] what snore saved by what was that him
[52:18] saved by my grace through faith
[52:24] conditions of Noah in Adam the condition
[52:31] was to stay away from the tree did you
[52:33] listen stay away from the tree of
[52:36] knowledge and by the time he comes to
[52:40] April he's a neighbor I want to give you
[52:48] an unconditional cousin and we're gonna
[52:52] put up with that old tree of knowledge
[52:55] they'll take care of that but me and you
[52:57] going down the road without it okay
[53:04] how does God did predestinate does he
[53:11] predetermine something to take place or
[53:14] does he know what will take place now
[53:19] which is this which is the story does he
[53:24] predestinate it or does he know that
[53:28] it'll take place and then by knowing
[53:30] that it will take place he can turn it
[53:33] around and bring it for his own honor
[53:36] and glory right he make it work out so
[53:43] the Covenant is an unconditional what
[53:47] Israel you still got that land you just
[53:50] gonna have to wait a little longer and
[53:54] Israel your seed he's over that right
[53:58] now and there's not just one hundred and
[54:01] forty-four thousand of them gonna be
[54:02] taken out and brought in to the point of
[54:06] did you you got to feel feel Jew you got
[54:09] a lot of Jews that are gonna be dealing
[54:13] with salvation somewhere down the line I
[54:16] hope you followed the message I didn't
[54:20] know the thief killed you well I thought
[54:22] your prophet said it was Israel from
[54:24] Calvary to down here and what about that
[54:29] group Paul was talking about that we're
[54:32] blinded so you and I could come in they
[54:37] haven't lost anything they've just lost
[54:39] the joy of their covenant now if God
[54:48] predestinate by foreknowledge you agree
[54:54] with that you need how many times you
[54:56] need brother parents say that now look
[54:58] what ago I forgot what it is but it's
[54:59] somewhere around fifty something times
[55:01] yet he uses almost that direct quote and
[55:04] they're probably about a hundred on top
[55:05] of the attitude an interline with it
[55:08] that called predestinate before
[55:10] knowledge then Jacob have I loved and
[55:15] Esau have I hated
[55:17] oh he loves her he loves Pikmin he hated
[55:24] he so that's what he said that's really
[55:29] good you know he knew that Jacob was not
[55:35] gonna stay Jacob he knew he'd be Israel
[55:41] and he knew all the covenants and
[55:43] everything would come and he knew that
[55:45] seed of Abraham would come through there
[55:50] but he knew exactly what he saw would do
[55:56] okay so something triggered God ever
[56:01] what you want to use the word for
[56:04] between a hey Jacob and Esau something
[56:08] triggered God to choose Jacob and the
[56:14] hate he saw what was it what caused it
[56:24] how could you just don't understand
[56:26] brother Dale which chosen why did he
[56:28] choose you we'll get to that we're not
[56:30] in the New Testament yeah we're headed
[56:33] in a way why did he choose you if he
[56:41] predestinate spy for knowledge then he
[56:48] would have some reason and basis to put
[56:56] Abraham right there
[57:02] what is your predestination oh I just
[57:06] believe God predestinate certain people
[57:08] this way certain people that way then
[57:13] you're exactly in the line of all
[57:16] organized religion and things that's
[57:19] predestinated my god choosing what he
[57:22] wants and rejected what he don't want
[57:27] why did he choose Abraham I said you
[57:36] talk about all but brother then would he
[57:38] instead Abraham an unconditional
[57:40] covenant will want to give it to it come
[57:48] on we supposed to establish the point
[57:50] that he surely couldn't give it to him
[57:52] to just say go live like you want to
[57:54] Abraham everything's alright and your
[58:00] descendants Israel he's gonna follow
[58:02] that mine first time they get in trouble
[58:10] they're put in bondage gives you listen
[58:13] in a minute ago the children of Israel
[58:18] would put in bondage because of their
[58:20] sin
[58:28] why would the commandments deal so much
[58:31] I know the story no children visual
[58:36] chose law okay they chose loves they
[58:38] didn't get what they thought they
[58:40] thought they got a book of Rouge they
[58:41] didn't get a buckaroo they got a
[58:42] revelation Jesus Christ that's what your
[58:44] prophet said us now all right ten
[58:50] commandments what is the commandment say
[58:54] says it's all right for you to steal
[58:57] what I ain't gonna count it to you are
[58:59] if you cheat lie sorry I'm here to
[59:01] commit adultery Rock if you do all these
[59:03] thing cut angle account it to Yuma
[59:07] I'd like for you to tell me why God
[59:09] didn't account David's sin or any man
[59:12] cinder what didn't he account the sin of
[59:18] Abraham mmm-hmm why was it all into
[59:28] Abraham and his seed if it was
[59:31] unconditional that would put God
[59:38] choosing Abraham and his seed and
[59:40] rejecting mankind right how does God
[59:52] predestinate anything he predestinated
[59:59] about his foreknowledge didn't he knew
[1:00:05] what Abraham would do alright that the
[1:00:11] words of the Prophet I gave you three
[1:00:14] quotes off of it last week or the other
[1:00:16] day he said Abraham I know him
[1:00:20] he said he'll teach his children why did
[1:00:28] he choose Abraham
[1:00:39] they must have been something about
[1:00:41] Abraham that he liked but ran him on the
[1:00:48] message Shepherd of the sheep fo he said
[1:00:52] and I thought of that about sheep and
[1:00:56] Shepherd why did he choose David
[1:01:07] David non-reading was always talking
[1:01:11] about steel waters in green pastures he
[1:01:17] was the psalmist that wrote songs and
[1:01:20] played on his heart to the glory of God
[1:01:23] and he must have been something about
[1:01:28] David tending sheep he must have been a
[1:01:33] real shepherd why did you save it
[1:01:47] he said yeah if your unconditional
[1:01:49] covenant I'm trying to get that to you
[1:01:51] to the point why did he do it Abraham an
[1:01:57] unconditional covenant he didn't give it
[1:02:01] away our thoughts and ideas of
[1:02:03] unconditional exists that's what I've
[1:02:06] been trying to prove to you he didn't do
[1:02:09] it he had a reason for choosing Abram
[1:02:16] see we can vote with what God just chose
[1:02:19] me I didn't choose him why did he choose
[1:02:21] you there's something about you you
[1:02:27] don't never think like that there's
[1:02:32] something about you that God likes we
[1:02:36] just quoted he liked David because David
[1:02:39] said on the heel and sung to the Sheep
[1:02:45] you know God loves music good music I do
[1:02:51] too
[1:02:56] David would always talking about steel
[1:03:02] waters and green pastures maybe when
[1:03:07] these days we'll figure out why the
[1:03:08] Bible said that David was a man after
[1:03:10] God's own heart and God ain't no
[1:03:15] adulteress and ain't no murderer so he
[1:03:17] surely ain't that so it ain't an
[1:03:21] unconditional covenant like we think
[1:03:26] it's unconditional in the basis that can
[1:03:29] never be taken away now are we here
[1:03:37] it doesn't mean while you're at it in it
[1:03:40] that you're not gonna have trouble it
[1:03:43] means it cannot be taken away
[1:03:47] I never took away Adams God never talked
[1:03:52] away to no us goes grace it already
[1:03:55] entered the picture he never took away
[1:03:58] her Abraham of the promise of the land
[1:04:02] he's tired he never took away his
[1:04:06] promise of his seed it's unconditional
[1:04:15] not in the basis and she can live back
[1:04:17] to devil and get violated but it can
[1:04:25] never be taken away I don't care what
[1:04:29] the world does I can't take away that
[1:04:31] man that God promised him we walked over
[1:04:35] there in places and in that that Israeli
[1:04:38] God he told me they had found his new
[1:04:40] place that they had led Jesus when they
[1:04:42] were leading him up too after taking him
[1:04:45] and whipping him and gonna put him in
[1:04:46] the tomb and he said Sam he said we just
[1:04:51] discovered these things right here and
[1:04:54] he said this is where they walked with
[1:04:56] the Lord Jesus everybody else is looking
[1:05:01] around at the trees and paying attention
[1:05:03] to everything I went walking up in
[1:05:08] you know what I said I said the devil
[1:05:13] you woke my master this way what that
[1:05:18] but I've gotta promise so I'm walking on
[1:05:23] you ever were the footprints coach is
[1:05:28] going to be mine and I'm walking on you
[1:05:30] tonight oh boy I had a lot of good times
[1:05:34] in Israel saw the sit healed it's all
[1:05:41] kind of thing are you listening you
[1:05:50] can't take away a covenant that God
[1:05:54] gives you said yeah but you can lose it
[1:05:58] no you can only lose if he gives it to
[1:06:02] you
[1:06:02] you're only gonna lose the effects of
[1:06:05] what it is now are the points you know
[1:06:07] it's what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:06:09] this rule was put in bondage many many
[1:06:13] times but they always came out that's an
[1:06:19] unconditional covenant to me that God
[1:06:23] can't lie he said that's girl and that
[1:06:26] girl and he said that's his feet and
[1:06:29] that's his seed we'll get to Christ one
[1:06:35] of these days you City Christ has kept
[1:06:39] his covenant it's got to be all right
[1:06:45] how does God predestinate back at
[1:06:48] foreknowledge so for some reason he
[1:06:51] looked down through and looking at Abram
[1:06:54] he's seen him one of our problems but
[1:06:58] looking at the end of the story you ever
[1:07:03] heard this one
[1:07:08] said wouldn't it be nice to be like
[1:07:10] Abraham and said I'm quoting Greta said
[1:07:17] he staggered not at the promise of God
[1:07:18] through unbelief it was strong and
[1:07:21] believing yeah I like to way that Gerson
[1:07:28] Solomon rabbi rich when I guess one
[1:07:30] he said talking about Abram and all of
[1:07:33] those things of in line and something
[1:07:34] like that to a message he was talking he
[1:07:37] said ain't no way that a Jew would tell
[1:07:39] that story like that if he wasn't led of
[1:07:42] God to say it because he'd never put
[1:07:47] Abram in that line why is it only to
[1:07:56] Abram and his seed if it was
[1:07:59] unconditional there was some reason that
[1:08:08] God chose Abraham maybe one of these
[1:08:11] days you'll look up and you'll see
[1:08:13] sometime how many times that we've
[1:08:15] talked on this how many sermons have I
[1:08:17] preached that there's a certain
[1:08:18] scripture related to each one of you you
[1:08:25] can't pull that out into your thinking
[1:08:27] and think about the scriptures that are
[1:08:29] related to you you never had him to
[1:08:34] speak to you a personal point about of
[1:08:36] Scripture and it be related to you what
[1:08:42] are you doing here today why are you
[1:08:47] here why are you in this message
[1:08:53] why are you an outcast a scum of the
[1:08:56] earth
[1:08:58] yeah we don't fight nobody we don't
[1:09:04] argue with nobody we don't first with
[1:09:07] nobody about what they believe right
[1:09:10] we'll just go on believing right
[1:09:16] you don't ever think you don't ever sit
[1:09:19] down some down and they say Lord why did
[1:09:21] you save me
[1:09:23] what fit Wow
[1:09:33] LeBron said God knew Abraham would teach
[1:09:38] his children so what did Isaac get
[1:09:43] teaching from his father
[1:09:46] kind of hard huh it's been hard to be an
[1:09:50] Isaac to lay down on that ground like
[1:09:51] that now I've come and ask you it but
[1:09:56] then when it was finished all the way
[1:09:58] back there's what 25 miles back in the
[1:10:00] woods
[1:10:00] 25 miles three days running or something
[1:10:03] what about Abraham explaining all the
[1:10:09] way about Jehovah Jireh
[1:10:14] to his son that has just been laying
[1:10:18] there with his throat very and open he
[1:10:23] says daddy you really love him don't you
[1:10:31] Abraham said yes so he said daddy you
[1:10:35] loved him enough to kill me than you yes
[1:10:37] son
[1:10:39] they'll remember the rest of Scripture
[1:10:42] don't just throw him away remember the
[1:10:47] rest of the scripture says because he
[1:10:49] knew that he had received him as from
[1:10:50] the dead and that God could return that
[1:10:53] again I like the way brother Richard
[1:10:55] Wilson says it years ago I remember him
[1:10:57] say it he said what if Abram later
[1:10:58] Abraham or Abram had to went ahead and
[1:11:01] just burnt Isaac slap-up
[1:11:05] said the scripture still rhymes he's got
[1:11:08] more than he had before cause before he
[1:11:11] had a dead woman and a dead man no hopes
[1:11:14] or whatsoever if he had a spoon full of
[1:11:17] Isis that was left in that fire he had
[1:11:20] more than he did to start with the Bible
[1:11:25] said he didn't worry cuz he said if he
[1:11:29] was killed him he said he's gonna raise
[1:11:31] him up now remember if you want to
[1:11:34] scripture you were to read some time go
[1:11:36] back to where he told Sarah are the
[1:11:41] people that was thorough ever said it is
[1:11:43] and what'd he say the lad and I shall go
[1:11:49] and I'm coming back with Isis in a part
[1:11:52] know what that wasn't exactly what he
[1:11:54] said he said the lad and I shall go in
[1:11:58] the lad and I shall return so ever were
[1:12:01] somewhere if he had a spoon full of Isis
[1:12:04] tommy walked 25 miles he's gonna have
[1:12:06] Isaac that's God's promise why why did
[1:12:16] he do that with Abel
[1:12:20] God made an outstanding statement about
[1:12:23] him he said now I know you love me you
[1:12:32] could've said before night Abram Abraham
[1:12:34] everyone he said woman yeah I guess you
[1:12:36] love me cuz you went through a lot of
[1:12:37] time but he said now I know you love me
[1:12:41] because you're willing to put your own
[1:12:43] son to death to fulfil what I said to do
[1:12:49] I'm glad he's never requested that again
[1:12:53] cuz I wouldn't have a problem I guess
[1:12:56] wouldn't you but listen God knew what
[1:13:03] Abraham would do that's before the
[1:13:11] foundation of the world right so then
[1:13:16] his choosing had to do what Abraham
[1:13:18] would do after he got here uh-oh
[1:13:20] we struck something on predestination
[1:13:22] that don't ring a bell to good you're
[1:13:26] saying that something we do or don't do
[1:13:28] I didn't say that I said it's something
[1:13:32] that God does through me and you you
[1:13:38] don't think why did God choose you you
[1:13:45] know that brother random talk about how
[1:13:46] that he had to breed this one to this
[1:13:48] one to this one to this one - that one
[1:13:51] to this one and all to come down with a
[1:13:53] blonde hated had he said blue-eyed
[1:13:56] little girl
[1:14:03] what about God breeding all this
[1:14:05] together to bring it down to a little
[1:14:10] people called a bride you realize that
[1:14:15] you're sitting here to not prove
[1:14:17] predestination you had a choice of being
[1:14:20] anywhere you wanted to I know some of
[1:14:25] you know you don't know your mind and
[1:14:27] what you think you'd like to have a
[1:14:29] pastor that is more powerful and
[1:14:31] explosive and dynamic and glowy well
[1:14:33] that's good if you want it with you find
[1:14:36] this one and we'll stick him in
[1:14:37] somewhere we got these other brothers
[1:14:40] going we'll put him in somewhere I enjoy
[1:14:45] those things too but you know what a lot
[1:14:48] of times I enjoy just sitting down
[1:14:50] thinking yes what brother Dale you make
[1:14:58] it to the basis that we think that we're
[1:15:00] doing something good about if it's done
[1:15:02] automatically what are you worried about
[1:15:04] it all right and I thought all the
[1:15:10] Christian are supposed to do everything
[1:15:12] automatically I didn't think that we had
[1:15:13] any problem then we got to Christianity
[1:15:16] but sure is good how does God
[1:15:18] predestinate by his foreknowledge
[1:15:20] he knew what Abraham would do
[1:15:29] statement for later on he believed God
[1:15:38] nobody else wouldn't believe was anybody
[1:15:44] in the days of Noah that would believe
[1:15:45] that was gonna rain
[1:15:47] Oh world Bible says as it was so is it
[1:15:55] now seven trillion the seven trillion
[1:15:57] they're all kind of fancy different this
[1:16:00] that the other and the only one man
[1:16:02] would believe it was gonna rain and he
[1:16:12] looked down into Noah and he said no I
[1:16:14] told you that a hundred and twenty years
[1:16:15] ago and said not one day since then have
[1:16:19] you just believed me oh that's change
[1:16:26] the time for three times I started out
[1:16:27] to preach on the seed of Abraham you
[1:16:29] know put a clean conditional covenant
[1:16:31] explained marking that out then I put an
[1:16:34] advocate because that's where we read
[1:16:36] down John if you don't think you do
[1:16:40] wrong what do you need an advocate for
[1:16:44] the president ale I don't think we've
[1:16:47] got it explained now we know that it's
[1:16:51] not me it's this it's this body and
[1:16:55] spirit we got it all explained now thank
[1:16:59] God it's the truth with that me does
[1:17:04] that mean I just let this body and
[1:17:06] spirit just run any which way I that the
[1:17:11] new birth is on the inside
[1:17:13] I thought Christ in us is what keeps the
[1:17:17] body and spirit under control I don't
[1:17:21] that was what Paul was saying when he
[1:17:28] said two things I would not I do he
[1:17:34] comes through a long list of things
[1:17:36] talking about a Christian walk not
[1:17:39] someone if we bad this used to teach
[1:17:41] that those guys were
[1:17:43] and explain how it would be to get saved
[1:17:45] they wouldn't explain in salvation I'm
[1:17:48] sorry that doesn't work
[1:17:51] Paul was talking to Christians and
[1:17:53] explaining himself not as the Baptist
[1:17:57] t-shirt or did that Paul in Romans until
[1:18:03] he got to the seventh eighth chapter and
[1:18:05] I like that was not born again he never
[1:18:10] heard those things but then he finally
[1:18:16] comes to a place did he get saved in
[1:18:19] their things age chapter now the books
[1:18:23] written to Christians Paul is explaining
[1:18:27] that every day walk he explains it
[1:18:31] perfect because in his finality of
[1:18:33] finishing up his story he said then it's
[1:18:38] not I from the inward man he said I
[1:18:42] served the law of God he said but from
[1:18:47] this outward man he said I served the
[1:18:50] law sin said that is in this flesh was
[1:18:55] Paul a sinner
[1:18:57] yeah no you don't read the scripture
[1:19:10] where were in John one and it was
[1:19:13] explaining that if we say we have not
[1:19:17] sinned and we're not a sinner and
[1:19:19] there's just that the other jump over to
[1:19:21] the third chapter and you'll find it'll
[1:19:24] say this whosoever that's born of God
[1:19:26] does not commit sin because his seed
[1:19:28] remaineth in any minute cannot sin who
[1:19:31] cannot see in the seed not the parson
[1:19:35] right the person can do home I wasn't
[1:19:46] when it wrote the book the Prophet was
[1:19:49] talking about in the Hebrew series about
[1:19:50] that
[1:19:51] man you know it was a preacher and he
[1:19:53] quit pretty soon him sat down and
[1:19:55] started drinking beer
[1:19:57] he was talking about a Christian he said
[1:19:59] Godhead take his child home he said
[1:20:03] coach wouldn't let him ours not what
[1:20:06] about some of those things see we don't
[1:20:08] want we want to hear a soft soap Pat had
[1:20:12] it on the head kind of a doll or
[1:20:14] something we don't want to listen to all
[1:20:16] things we want to just take what a
[1:20:19] little bit we won't we want to follow it
[1:20:28] just the way we think about it you know
[1:20:33] that might be the thing that God is
[1:20:36] looking at it he don't like you've got a
[1:20:46] choir
[1:20:49] what if he's looking at what we thought
[1:20:51] all of this time was salvation to us and
[1:20:53] says it's not salvation we'll get to
[1:20:58] those things as we cover along a little
[1:21:00] further but I hope you following the
[1:21:02] unconditional covenant it means it can
[1:21:07] never be taken away from you once it's
[1:21:12] given unto you right that's what makes
[1:21:17] it unconditional it don't cover the sin
[1:21:21] you do because you're gonna reap attack
[1:21:24] for is that what's your prophecy he said
[1:21:27] sent us in as a Christian Reaper
[1:21:28] doubtful
[1:21:29] yeah but you didn't scratch me Kay not
[1:21:32] saying well then your prophets wrong so
[1:21:35] let's turn off the message forget it is
[1:21:38] that the way you want what about when he
[1:21:42] gets on the adoption he said the
[1:21:44] Christians is the only one that sins
[1:21:49] yeah but I don't worry said see you're
[1:21:52] fighting you're not listening you're
[1:21:58] only fighting to refute do we sin every
[1:22:03] day run around him
[1:22:05] Hebrew series chapter 6
[1:22:08] ergo 262-264 knew we've seen every day
[1:22:13] yes
[1:22:17] Paul said he died daily now what is Paul
[1:22:24] mean he died daily - what - that one
[1:22:35] that was making him do what he was doing
[1:22:39] oh listen Romans seven in you see him
[1:22:49] every day
[1:22:54] but what about it what about it okay if
[1:23:09] you got that until jump over to number
[1:23:12] five can you pull that up in a hurry
[1:23:15] weary continuing for the faith if you
[1:23:18] could pull that that far if don't now
[1:23:21] quote it hey the worse at it is in e6
[1:23:28] but made the statement at the carpenter
[1:23:31] kills the whole body coming down trying
[1:23:34] to find one thing to bring the human
[1:23:36] adam sinned destroyed the world come on
[1:23:39] up and see if we can find it down I
[1:23:41] guess we get this off
[1:23:43] there's none without sin every day you
[1:23:46] sin Oh said he had to die daily
[1:23:52] if we say we sin we have no sin we say
[1:23:56] we sin and have no sin then the Bible
[1:23:59] says we make God to lie and we could not
[1:24:02] do that so we sin daily in its grace
[1:24:05] God's grace that saves us and as we
[1:24:08] confess our wrong yeah
[1:24:15] the Bible says to confess our sins right
[1:24:20] that's what the Bible says well we don't
[1:24:23] have it do you realize what you're doing
[1:24:28] see then you say that's not a Christian
[1:24:31] so you're moving that out of this
[1:24:33] picture if we confess our sins he's
[1:24:38] honest and just to forgive them yeah but
[1:24:42] I I just don't see how that you can
[1:24:45] stand up there and blatent lycée that a
[1:24:48] Christian sins I didn't do it your
[1:24:51] prophet did the Bible did I'm just
[1:24:56] quoting what I say because if we say we
[1:25:04] don't see and we make him a liar
[1:25:08] Paul explains it come on I did a second
[1:25:12] ago so to a Christian where is sin I've
[1:25:15] always tried to preach it to you for 50
[1:25:18] years to get you to see it a Christian
[1:25:21] cannot sin with their soul it's truly
[1:25:25] born again Joyce their body and spirit
[1:25:29] that descend Wells within but to say I
[1:25:34] don't seeing that I'm a liar because I
[1:25:35] am a sin in that point but just remember
[1:25:41] this one now if you have the inside one
[1:25:46] that cannot sin then you've got an
[1:25:49] unconditional in the right way in the
[1:26:01] right way you've got it right now if
[1:26:04] what if you believe that in that soul
[1:26:09] it's sealed off from Satan and truly
[1:26:13] eternal by the baptism when the Holy
[1:26:14] Ghost and that one that's within there
[1:26:19] can't lie cheat steal etc but the
[1:26:22] outside man can do wrong and if we do
[1:26:29] wrong
[1:26:31] what is it in the communion we do wrong
[1:26:41] we do wrong every day
[1:26:45] no brother dad I'm a Christian I never
[1:26:48] do wrong
[1:26:49] okay well right ahead I'll only say one
[1:26:54] thing and then try to finish the thought
[1:26:59] you know what's keeping us here what's
[1:27:03] keeping us here fifty years after the
[1:27:05] Prophet won a little word called
[1:27:08] unbelief we can question that with that
[1:27:15] starts all right we want to argue with
[1:27:18] you about it we just leave it on one
[1:27:21] time
[1:27:24] why has God not come and honored his
[1:27:29] word wide it is rolled state 40 or 30
[1:27:35] technically it rolls on over a little
[1:27:38] bit more over but why were they 400
[1:27:41] years according to what he said to
[1:27:44] Abraham and then 30 years it's
[1:27:46] technically if they're closer to 40 was
[1:27:49] added for them to study why
[1:28:01] because they didn't believe Moses to be
[1:28:06] the one to take them out they rejected
[1:28:12] him right and thereby they got at least
[1:28:15] 30 years going on the word forty years
[1:28:20] because of their unbelief do you know
[1:28:27] what God never run off and left him you
[1:28:32] just let him pout it out and put under
[1:28:34] bondage for 30 40 years
[1:28:35] he sent Moses right back down why
[1:28:39] because he had already said in his word
[1:28:41] he'd do it they'll come out with a
[1:28:43] mighty hand and a nation that does these
[1:28:45] things will be annihilated look at Egypt
[1:28:49] when they walked out of that they had
[1:28:51] everything they could get on the Bible
[1:28:54] said they raised it which means that
[1:28:55] would just they just totally annihilated
[1:28:57] Egypt as a country why because God kept
[1:29:06] his word if we do no wrong then why do
[1:29:16] we need an advocate
[1:29:30] you know what it is to say that you have
[1:29:32] an advocate it means one who stands in
[1:29:36] your place or takes your part you know
[1:29:38] really what you're saying the Lord
[1:29:42] I won't this advocate do you say that I
[1:29:50] don't need to raise a hand I might
[1:29:52] asking you do you really need an
[1:29:55] advocate the Bible said which is Jesus
[1:29:58] Christ the righteous now no see and he
[1:30:02] don't need one and you realize if you do
[1:30:10] away with an advocate you do away with
[1:30:12] part of God you're denying him the right
[1:30:19] a full manifestation of how that he
[1:30:22] wanted to be a father he wanted to be a
[1:30:24] savior he wanted to be a redeemer he
[1:30:28] wanted to be an advocate because he knew
[1:30:30] we'd needed so when you say you don't
[1:30:35] need an advocate look what you're saying
[1:30:36] you're doing away with it now watch
[1:30:38] though there's a reverse to the store
[1:30:40] remember then if you say you need an
[1:30:43] advocate and you won't advocate just
[1:30:46] take it means you've got a reason for it
[1:30:47] state it means you're admitting that you
[1:30:53] need a Savior
[1:30:58] what about it yeah but I just don't know
[1:31:03] if that korabik I've been taught all my
[1:31:05] life that a Christian cannot sin
[1:31:08] you ain't never studied this message
[1:31:12] sinners condemned on a higher level he's
[1:31:15] a sinner only Christians can sin that's
[1:31:20] what's your profit see it we're the only
[1:31:26] ones who need an advocate we're the only
[1:31:27] ones that needs a comforter with the
[1:31:29] only one that needs those things go
[1:31:32] today doing the center no good
[1:31:37] I like things that the Prophet will say
[1:31:41] sometimes it really amazes you until you
[1:31:43] think it over you know you know that
[1:31:45] you're not saved by the blood now that's
[1:31:50] a you come down from the Methodist and
[1:31:51] they'll shoot you about that because
[1:31:54] you're saved by the blood blood saves
[1:31:56] you work
[1:31:57] show me the Bible the blood save you
[1:32:00] alright the Prophet made the statement I
[1:32:03] admit it took a while to get that old
[1:32:04] Baptist thought out of there but you
[1:32:10] know what once he got it out I could
[1:32:16] have a little understanding a little
[1:32:20] understanding of salvation that could be
[1:32:25] imparted to me that would follow it I
[1:32:33] would see it I'd understand I don't
[1:32:41] understand the Bible the Bible doesn't
[1:32:44] say you're saved by the blood the Bible
[1:32:46] says you're saved by grace through faith
[1:32:51] [Music]
[1:32:52] that's the Bible then I like the way the
[1:32:56] Prophet said it he said you're not saved
[1:32:59] by the blood he says you're kept saved
[1:33:03] remember that you're kept saying because
[1:33:07] that blood incorporates every dipti
[1:33:10] blessing that that son of God had within
[1:33:14] him while he was walking the shores of
[1:33:16] Galilee was because there was the blood
[1:33:18] of Almighty God healer Savior Redeemer
[1:33:21] advocate comforter what about it
[1:33:31] cap saved by the blood what I said
[1:33:36] imagine this would hang you for that
[1:33:39] because everything they had in their day
[1:33:41] was built on the blood and I ain't
[1:33:43] throwing off on the one of them because
[1:33:45] that was the day of the time all of your
[1:33:47] songs about the blood was written in the
[1:33:49] day not all of them come on you know
[1:33:51] what I'm talking about
[1:33:52] the days of John Wesley it was the other
[1:33:57] one Charles wrote the songs
[1:34:00] everything in that day was about the
[1:34:02] blood the songs of the age was about the
[1:34:06] blood brother Brennan says we're not
[1:34:10] saved in any way by the literal chemical
[1:34:13] blood
[1:34:15] he said we're saved by the life that was
[1:34:19] in the blood then I got to life it's in
[1:34:25] the blood now listen close the hole
[1:34:28] taught off then we'll start a little
[1:34:31] better later an unconditional covenant
[1:34:36] God's not gonna take away what he said
[1:34:39] he'd do thank God for that he's not
[1:34:46] gonna give it to you and let you live
[1:34:47] like a devil and not because I don't
[1:34:52] let's see what is it other scripture
[1:34:54] whatever Sunday come with the garden
[1:34:56] must be what chastened Oh why he's the
[1:35:05] sort of car chasing it he might not die
[1:35:10] with the sins of the world right right
[1:35:12] why are you chasing your children why do
[1:35:15] you correct your children to get them to
[1:35:17] live right
[1:35:23] and what the prophets say about Abraham
[1:35:26] he said all them things had done wrong
[1:35:29] which said when Paul finished his
[1:35:30] commentary about the life of Abraham
[1:35:34] said he staggered not at the promise of
[1:35:38] God that was God looking at Abraham that
[1:35:45] was not Paul looking at Abraham that was
[1:35:49] guard looking at him now before the
[1:35:52] foundation of the world what was garden
[1:35:54] looking at ended right here
[1:35:56] what was God looking at before the
[1:35:59] foundation of the world was he looking
[1:36:01] at all of the problems and heartaches
[1:36:03] and trouble to the world sure that's it
[1:36:05] for knowledge he would know that with
[1:36:06] that pleasure but he was looking at the
[1:36:09] end of the road when it would all be
[1:36:13] finished in Jesus Christ
[1:36:24] unconditional not to go out live like
[1:36:26] the devil you are the devil
[1:36:30] but unconditionally and it can never be
[1:36:33] taken away from me we'll get to that on
[1:36:36] the baptism when the Holy Ghost come
[1:36:37] once you do it
[1:36:38] what is receipt of Abraham brother one
[1:36:40] said it's the baptism with the Holy
[1:36:41] Ghost which there's more to the seed of
[1:36:44] Abraham that's why all these people got
[1:36:46] these seed doctrines you don't never
[1:36:49] hear him talk about Abraham and what
[1:36:51] that seed was
[1:36:58] you just try to make it something that
[1:37:00] makes me to where I'm okay instead of
[1:37:03] making it what the word says God kept
[1:37:09] his covenant with April
[1:37:12] changing to Abraham change his body
[1:37:15] brought him forth brought all of the
[1:37:17] things they would show salvation to the
[1:37:20] Gentiles possession it would bring him
[1:37:24] forth and he'd manifest all of these
[1:37:26] things why would you a human mind want
[1:37:35] to think about that he could get Bible
[1:37:37] sin oh I didn't see that I didn't see
[1:37:44] that in him why would anybody any
[1:37:51] thoughts ever want to develop in your
[1:37:52] mind I pray every day Father forgive me
[1:38:01] forgive me Lord
[1:38:05] well you were to get to the place you
[1:38:07] don't need to pray so much but I hadn't
[1:38:09] got there yeah then I don't worry about
[1:38:12] it either every prayer I begin in the
[1:38:16] end is with Father forgive me because I
[1:38:20] know I do wrong I know out problems but
[1:38:23] I know you said what you do and I'm glad
[1:38:27] you're not looking down here at what I'm
[1:38:29] doing through life as I said he didn't
[1:38:32] look down to see what Jesus Christ would
[1:38:34] do on earth
[1:38:34] sure that was there he knew but he
[1:38:38] looked what it meant before the world
[1:38:46] he's gonna save Abraham and his seed
[1:38:49] after him now how do we become the seed
[1:38:53] of Abraham he said by faith that's
[1:39:00] wonderful how do we become the seed of
[1:39:02] Abraham what classifies you and I as the
[1:39:05] seed of Abraham
[1:39:12] what would classify us is the seed of a
[1:39:15] pariah no are we right that's what it's
[1:39:18] got to be oh come on folks we talked to
[1:39:20] this new Baptist Church that we would
[1:39:22] have seat of Abraham by faith right now
[1:39:25] I mean you sitting around now don't know
[1:39:27] what to see the vapor around the edge I
[1:39:35] thought the seed of Abraham was to do
[1:39:38] the works of God we got a lot of
[1:39:45] scripture a lot of topics come on is
[1:39:46] this you a lot of thinking about it why
[1:39:53] do we need these things if we don't do
[1:39:56] wrong why did God put him in his word if
[1:40:00] we don't do wrong why would we not want
[1:40:03] him to fulfill his attributes and
[1:40:08] display all of those things when I know
[1:40:14] I needed Paul said I die daily so if he
[1:40:27] died daily that meant they was wrong in
[1:40:29] his life you can do what you want to
[1:40:32] what you're thinking he had something
[1:40:35] wrong in his life or he wouldn't have
[1:40:36] been dying I die every day - Father
[1:40:40] forgive me cleanse me Lord forgive me no
[1:40:48] trouble when you get down to the river I
[1:40:49] wanted everything to be right but I want
[1:40:53] it to be right not wrong
[1:40:54] go ahead brother what we got listening
[1:40:57] do you need an advocate then these Jesus
[1:41:01] Christ the righteous do you have an
[1:41:06] unconditional covenant that means
[1:41:10] there's no way into it
[1:41:13] so when he started that with you in the
[1:41:15] new birth you don't have to worry about
[1:41:17] it does that mean I can just get by the
[1:41:21] ain't got to get new birth why would you
[1:41:24] think that why would you even want to
[1:41:26] think that when God has done so much to
[1:41:30] make you and I to the place that we need
[1:41:32] to be and why would we think it's okay
[1:41:37] with God you know he knows I'm having
[1:41:41] problems we said he had problems too he
[1:41:47] did but he never let them problems get
[1:41:51] in his way

[1:42:58] remember the message about six months
[1:43:01] ago I'm trying to preach you back
[1:43:03] [Music]
[1:43:06] the Bible said it's not whether or not
[1:43:08] I'm chosen
[1:43:09] it's whether he's Joe
[1:43:13] and I went around joking
[1:43:15] it's whether he's chosen it already
[1:43:20] whether or not he was chosen because
[1:43:22] then it can be transmitted to me I'd say
[1:43:26] who i predestination
[1:43:31] God before the world sat down and looked
[1:43:33] and seen our lives see where we would go
[1:43:37] and what we would go through to come to
[1:43:40] the place that we are listen any knows
[1:43:45] nobody can take your place
[1:43:48] [Music]
[1:43:51] now that's a word you know but ain't
[1:43:54] nobody can take your place he chose
[1:44:00] nobody can take your place
[1:44:03] [Music]
[1:44:20] we just make him believe in you if you
[1:44:26] have to take care of it
[1:44:27] what he's asking for you babe
[1:44:31] we'd like it in Jesus

[1:45:42] requested a prayer cloth for his
[1:45:44] neighbor's artist a lot of problems the
[1:45:48] year the problem solver you're the one
[1:45:50] that will take care of every time we
[1:45:53] believe it so we send this burner phone
[1:45:55] Pro to be done no matter what the devil
[1:45:59] she is it's a finished product we love
[1:46:01] you Father thank you in Jesus anybody
[1:46:07] else
[1:46:07] [Music]
[1:46:18] when rejected from Network
[1:46:27] Oh
[1:46:30] [Music]
[1:46:32] I hope you understand what I've tried to
[1:46:35] say an unconditional covenant it's not
[1:46:38] something that you can just get by with
[1:46:39] anything and do what you want to live
[1:46:41] like the devil and everything be alright
[1:46:43] but it means if God gives it to you he
[1:46:46] can't take it back that's what I mean by
[1:46:51] an unconditional covenant if he gives it
[1:46:55] to you you can't lose it but just
[1:46:58] remember as the man in the Hebrew series
[1:47:02] God won't let his child Mars name you
[1:47:06] may get taken off the scene if you won't
[1:47:08] straighten up
[1:47:09] Dhar is what we need to be concerned
[1:47:12] about if we won't follow after him we
[1:47:16] may lose in a short journey and you know
[1:47:19] what if we don't follow after him we're
[1:47:23] all going by the grave I don't care if
[1:47:25] we're Christians or whatever we're going
[1:47:27] by the grave somebody has got to believe
[1:47:32] it and stand here and call for it before
[1:47:37] it can be made manifest it's done been
[1:47:42] saying the promises are dire we don't
[1:47:46] need another message we don't need
[1:47:47] another Bible we need to believe what
[1:47:50] the Prophet is brought to us and he
[1:47:54] Curtis all the way that's what that man
[1:47:56] sitting in my house that day he said
[1:47:58] brother Branham laid the foundation he
[1:48:00] said we build a church we do something I
[1:48:02] said well I ask you one question
[1:48:05] you know simple little question you say
[1:48:09] brother Branham laid the foundation and
[1:48:11] you gonna build the rest of it right I
[1:48:14] said what according to the Prophet
[1:48:17] brother branham priestess all the way to
[1:48:20] the future home the eighth day now if
[1:48:23] you gonna tell me something tell me
[1:48:25] pi-star you get it if you gonna come and
[1:48:31] build something it's gonna be pi-star
[1:48:33] then and you know what he didn't say no
[1:48:38] more
[1:48:38] what would you say it
[1:48:43] there's no way if somebody comes to
[1:48:46] straighten him out then he wouldn't
[1:48:48] right we ain't go we're about that far
[1:48:55] in RV we're gonna rejoice in what we've
[1:48:58] got and believe it and just think about
[1:49:02] it those children of Israel I remember
[1:49:07] Wade preaching on that one time about
[1:49:08] years ago and they would come down to
[1:49:11] that night of the communion the Passover
[1:49:13] thing and everything had to be set in
[1:49:16] order aired this had to be there that
[1:49:17] had to be fair they had to go through
[1:49:18] all of the young the cleansing the
[1:49:20] situation and when they got through they
[1:49:25] left one chair at one place in one cup
[1:49:33] you know who it was far it was for
[1:49:37] Elijah and they'd get up and they'd open
[1:49:42] the door he didn't come in they'd say I
[1:49:49] forgot how the term was it another year
[1:49:51] you know another time he's not here yet
[1:49:58] well I think we ought to be thinking
[1:50:01] about this a kind of the end of all
[1:50:03] things in order to be finished and
[1:50:05] believed in it because you know what
[1:50:11] we're running out of time
[1:50:13] whether you like it or not old age is
[1:50:16] gonna get a lot of us I thank you
[1:50:19] another day I said lord thank you for
[1:50:20] these young guys coming in I said these
[1:50:23] ministers is raising up these people the
[1:50:26] Deacons are people of the church the
[1:50:28] young people that are coming along they
[1:50:30] can take this thing home I'm not saying
[1:50:35] that I'm through that'll be the day he
[1:50:38] finishes it but I'm saying there's one
[1:50:40] thing about it we can't keep going long
[1:50:45] it's gonna be something has to happen
[1:50:48] pretty quick if you don't you know what
[1:50:51] we're going by the great I mean that's
[1:50:53] normal that's not decreased you know
[1:50:55] nobody when I said that back to
[1:50:57] 40-something years ago 50 years ago that
[1:51:00] the Lord showed me the biggest force of
[1:51:01] people this man's gonna die and go by
[1:51:03] the great people got upset with me about
[1:51:05] that still get upset with me saying I
[1:51:07] had no disrespect to nobody no thoughts
[1:51:10] of nobody but there's one thing about it
[1:51:14] those that have died are in the ground
[1:51:16] waiting on me and you we can get upset
[1:51:19] have our feelings heard about some
[1:51:21] little something
[1:51:22] they just won't stay in that ground
[1:51:24] until we get to the place do we say Lord
[1:51:28] come quickly come quickly and get us out
[1:51:33] of here does you know what they died in
[1:51:37] faith those that are sleep in Christ
[1:51:43] Jesus any brain with it they died in
[1:51:46] faith ain't be Christian out of nobody
[1:51:50] if I say God told me and 40 50 years ago
[1:51:53] the records proved it was told you
[1:51:56] shouldn't get upset about me saying it
[1:51:58] now what you ought to be concerned with
[1:52:00] one time am I ready am I ready or do I
[1:52:08] need to go by the grave got out one of
[1:52:11] the other that's sensible that's didn't
[1:52:15] need a revelation
[1:52:16] you don't know how yet or whatever
[1:52:17] that's plain common sense and I don't
[1:52:21] mean cause you were young that you gonna
[1:52:22] live a long time I don't do that it's
[1:52:27] just the basis that God always raises up
[1:52:29] somebody to carry it on father we thank
[1:52:35] you Lord we praise your great name and
[1:52:38] your honor and glory we thank you for
[1:52:42] the understanding Lord Oh an
[1:52:46] unconditional covenant means you're
[1:52:48] gonna finish it means it's not over with
[1:52:51] means it's not on the basis what we do
[1:52:54] or don't do yeah it's on the basis what
[1:52:56] you've already done but then if we don't
[1:52:58] line up what you've already done
[1:53:00] then we prove who we are then we're now
[1:53:04] late ourselves from the hope of glory
[1:53:06] because we don't believe
[1:53:09] it's what you said is true be with
