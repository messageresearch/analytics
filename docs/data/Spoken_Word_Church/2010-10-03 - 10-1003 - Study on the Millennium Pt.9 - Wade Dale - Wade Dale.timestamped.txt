[0:03] thanks to
[0:06] brother donny
[0:09] for taking last sunday
[0:12] and now
[0:13] brother joe's thing next sunday
[0:16] we will be at brother richard wilson's
[0:18] church
[0:21] no no no no pointing
[0:24] no i'd do the pointing
[0:26] you don't be
[0:27] still on
[0:34] all right let's turn to saint john one
[0:38] did anybody lose this it's been laying
[0:40] here for a while it's a versace
[0:42] eye glass cleaner
[0:48] okay
[0:52] i think john 1-1
[0:54] and what we're doing is we're
[0:58] kind of doing a comparison
[1:01] to the son of god
[1:04] and some man
[1:07] and we brought
[1:08] god showing that he was like in the
[1:12] beginning
[1:14] and that light became flesh
[1:17] called the son of man so we're going to
[1:18] go back and read john 1.
[1:21] we're going to read it like the original
[1:22] greek
[1:24] or the original latin
[1:26] in your
[1:31] latin vulgate
[1:33] so you ready let's go
[1:36] everything's on
[1:39] in the beginning was the logos
[1:42] and the logos was with god
[1:44] and the logos was god
[1:47] the same was in the beginning with god
[1:52] all things were made by him who this
[1:55] logos
[1:57] and without him was not anything made
[1:59] that was made
[2:01] in him was life
[2:03] and the life was the light of men
[2:07] and the light shineth in darkness and
[2:08] the darkness comprehended it not
[2:12] now he's telling how that now john is
[2:14] telling how this light gets introduced
[2:17] there was a man sent from god his name
[2:19] was john
[2:20] the same came for a witness to bear
[2:22] witness of the light not the little
[2:25] l-i-g-h-t this is capital l-i-g-h-t the
[2:28] light the light the logos
[2:31] the light that was before the foundation
[2:33] of the world
[2:35] that all men through him might believe
[2:37] he was not that capital l-i-g-h-t
[2:41] but was sent to bear witness of that
[2:43] light
[2:46] that was the true light which lighted
[2:48] every man that cometh into the world
[2:51] capital
[2:53] he was in the world the world was made
[2:55] by him and the world near not
[2:58] came unto his own and his own received
[3:00] him not but as many as received him
[3:02] to them gave me power to become the sons
[3:04] of god
[3:06] even to them that believe on his name
[3:11] which were born not of blood
[3:14] nor the will of the flesh nor the will
[3:16] of the man but of god
[3:18] love means from
[3:22] so he's born from god
[3:24] all right
[3:26] and the logos was made flesh
[3:29] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[3:31] glory the glory of the only begotten of
[3:33] the father full of grace and truth
[3:35] now we see a word here
[3:44] begotten son of god is not begotten
[3:48] begotten is something that comes forth
[3:50] from you
[3:53] that creates a lineage begotten
[3:57] josh hannah whatever begotten they were
[3:59] begotten of us
[4:01] to bring forth something
[4:05] to
[4:06] you can say in our terminology
[4:08] perpetuate the species
[4:10] all right
[4:11] you know now we're sitting yesterday in
[4:12] the in the mall
[4:15] down at um discover meals just wasting
[4:17] time
[4:20] not wasting time we were going to pick
[4:21] up the wreath why would you waste time
[4:22] picking up the wreath
[4:24] we weren't wasting time we had extras we
[4:26] had extra time
[4:28] so
[4:29] so we
[4:30] so we spent extra time
[4:33] wasting it
[4:35] waiting on the rings
[4:37] so while we were there we bought a
[4:39] diamond ring for my sweetheart
[4:42] and our anniversary is wednesday so
[4:45] i want to say on the internet and all
[4:47] over the world
[4:48] the best woman that ever was walked the
[4:50] face of the earth
[4:51] right there
[4:52] 31 years
[4:54] in my sweetheart
[4:57] all right so this
[4:59] while we were sitting there
[5:00] we were sitting in the food court here's
[5:02] all these people
[5:05] and i was thinking on genetics and all
[5:07] the things of what we
[5:09] preached on regeneration at brother
[5:10] gerald hughes churchill how god regened
[5:13] us or regenerated us you know took us
[5:15] from our old genetics to our new
[5:17] genetics and
[5:20] that whole
[5:22] you know not
[5:23] belittling anyone to not make ourselves
[5:26] great at all
[5:27] not at all
[5:29] but the only generation that's gonna
[5:32] come out of that whole three or four
[5:34] hundred people
[5:35] if they weren't born again was going to
[5:37] be june and myself
[5:40] because we were regenerated from above
[5:43] they were all regenerated from the earth
[5:45] every person ugly
[5:47] pretty
[5:48] big little they all came from one act
[5:52] sex act okay down here on earth to make
[5:55] a natural genetics
[5:57] but if they're not re-gene from above
[6:00] if there's no regeneration then there's
[6:02] no perpetuation of our species as far as
[6:04] christians that's why
[6:06] that he become the only begotten
[6:10] melchizedek was not begotten
[6:13] melchizedek was
[6:15] that logos that just formed a body
[6:19] stepped into that body
[6:20] walked to meet abraham
[6:23] could not do any good to abraham except
[6:26] to prophesy and tell him what was coming
[6:30] all right
[6:31] because god changed his body
[6:33] we know that but then he died
[6:35] so that wasn't the total promise he gave
[6:38] the promise to abraham and his seed
[6:40] all right so and it wasn't
[6:43] isaac
[6:44] because isaac
[6:46] did the same thing as daddy did
[6:48] he give his wife away did the same thing
[6:50] his daddy did okay abraham so it wasn't
[6:53] a natural genetics
[6:56] but all those people that was in that
[6:57] mall yesterday their natural genetics
[6:59] they just you know they people go back
[7:01] and search their genetics here and some
[7:03] were tall some were short some were you
[7:05] know different shapes short waisted long
[7:07] wasted all the things of that what i'm
[7:09] trying to say is you ought to understand
[7:11] one thing when you're if you're born
[7:13] again today you are not of this world
[7:18] you are a totally different race of
[7:21] people
[7:23] and the world sees it
[7:26] by making movies and things about these
[7:28] extraterrestrials about people coming
[7:30] and living among us and they take on
[7:32] human bodies and they're of this super
[7:35] race this superman this superwoman
[7:38] all that types what's going on now
[7:42] right in the midst of the
[7:44] the greatest eden
[7:46] satan's eden that ever was
[7:48] god is birthing children
[7:52] just like he wanted to do
[7:54] when he was in this form
[7:56] because when in genesis 1 26 he created
[7:59] man
[8:00] in his image correct
[8:03] not flesh bodies
[8:05] theophany
[8:07] one theophany this guy right here that
[8:10] logos was that theophany
[8:12] and it was not just a light that was
[8:15] pulsating it was a human man
[8:22] the same man that walked ashore to
[8:23] galilee but it wasn't the same flesh he
[8:27] wasn't in flesh then
[8:29] he picked up the flesh because when he
[8:30] made this world that's where he got his
[8:32] flesh from that
[8:34] body
[8:36] yes
[8:37] he had a spirit body
[8:39] but then what we're trying to see is is
[8:41] the difference
[8:43] between this man and this man but
[8:44] there's not a difference it's just
[8:46] showing the
[8:47] i guess you want to say now the
[8:49] genealogy of god
[8:51] because this is the genealogy of god
[8:54] and you say well this
[8:56] hey look the all the old testament
[9:00] so and so forgot so-and-so so and so we
[9:02] got so-and-so so we got so-and-so
[9:05] all in these chapters of chronicles
[9:08] leviticus deuteronomy numbers and all
[9:10] that's what they did the number of
[9:11] people but
[9:13] god said okay you can have this natural
[9:15] genealogy but it's only going to type
[9:17] what i'm going to do in the spiritual
[9:19] form
[9:20] spiritual genealogy is what he wanted to
[9:22] start with because actually his genetics
[9:26] was what we're talking about when john
[9:28] picked this up and said in the beginning
[9:30] was the logos
[9:32] or the word and the word was
[9:36] god and
[9:37] that word with is a relationship
[9:40] it wasn't two people
[9:43] but it was god knowing all the children
[9:45] he'd ever have
[9:47] and he could glory i told you many times
[9:50] before if i was infinite if i was an
[9:52] infinite man
[9:53] and and i was going to have 100 children
[9:57] if i was infinite i'd know every one of
[9:59] them
[10:00] because i know who they are i know what
[10:02] their name was i know what they look
[10:03] like because they come from me and i
[10:06] would be infinite but us being finite
[10:08] we have to drop down like adam and eve
[10:11] through an act of of
[10:13] of sex or an act of
[10:15] of permission
[10:17] but it all works back to the same to the
[10:19] same thing
[10:21] god said okay you won't have a natural
[10:23] genetics
[10:24] but through that natural genetics i'm
[10:26] going to have a spiritual evil
[10:30] we got this one to this one this one to
[10:31] this one this one or this one to bring
[10:33] you
[10:34] but other than that all that natural
[10:36] genetics is going back to the dust
[10:38] they're just all that that was in that
[10:40] and sometimes it just makes you it never
[10:42] makes me feel exalted it always makes me
[10:44] feel so little
[10:46] that god would think so much of just me
[10:48] and her the only people and maybe three
[10:50] or four hundred people in that food
[10:51] court
[10:53] maybe great men
[10:54] that really thought a lot of their
[10:56] genealogy
[10:58] just dust bible says brute beast made
[11:02] made
[11:03] for destruction
[11:06] um i think of that often on the way down
[11:08] because you passed so many cars
[11:11] sure that have such a lot of people in
[11:14] you know and you get and you think that
[11:16] possibly you're the only one that
[11:18] believes what you do
[11:20] and i was reading shalom listening to
[11:22] shalom
[11:24] and brother branham says here but really
[11:27] frankly we have never
[11:29] seen each other did you know that we
[11:31] have never seen one another
[11:34] we hear each other speaking but we've
[11:36] never seen
[11:37] each other right that's right
[11:40] but god had to allow because of what
[11:43] happened in genesis god had to allow a
[11:45] natural seed genetic
[11:48] line to come to the earth
[11:50] to get you here
[11:52] like we were saying last night in bible
[11:53] study for those of you that weren't here
[11:55] i think of that many times
[11:58] what happened in the civil war because
[12:00] the civil war was
[12:02] was americans fighting americans
[12:04] and it wasn't like americans fighting
[12:05] germans it wasn't two genetic lines
[12:08] fighting each other it was the same
[12:10] genetic makeup we were all just one we
[12:12] all live together in the same city in
[12:14] the same farm a lot of times one sun
[12:16] would go fight on one side another sun
[12:17] and go fly on the other side
[12:19] but somehow down through there all of
[12:21] our lineages come down through there
[12:23] because unless you were you know born
[12:25] from another country
[12:27] okay
[12:28] which you had your war sister just to
[12:30] read the the island was populated some
[12:32] way some somehow and i don't know the
[12:35] total history i know some but still god
[12:38] brought something to that island to get
[12:40] her here
[12:42] this little island up in nowhere you
[12:44] know
[12:45] self-sustained itself for a while enough
[12:47] to bring her and brother keith and all
[12:50] the believers over there
[12:52] so god really
[12:54] cares about his children
[12:56] he really cares about his children why
[12:58] wouldn't you even as a natural father
[13:00] care about your children
[13:02] but so much god knowing where you'd
[13:04] be what you'd be doing
[13:07] how you'd get here
[13:09] and that's uh brother gary atkins and i
[13:12] talked a lot about you know the bible
[13:13] says the bed is undefiled and without
[13:16] that you'd have a question
[13:18] about how we all got here why god would
[13:20] use something like that to just speak in
[13:23] a little plane today but i think about
[13:25] it though about your natural being how
[13:26] you got here
[13:30] your mama may have been out in
[13:31] california daddy in new york
[13:36] she may have dropped her
[13:37] or her handkerchief
[13:39] while they were passing in an airport
[13:41] 50 years ago and
[13:43] he picks up the handkerchief and says
[13:45] here ma'am
[13:47] well you were inside that man
[13:50] but your mama had your body
[13:52] they had to come together to get you
[13:53] here
[13:55] the amazing stories of how and and and
[13:58] you know we don't want to spend a lot of
[13:59] time on on this natural part but
[14:02] god thoughts enough of it to get you
[14:04] here
[14:05] and then start regening you are
[14:07] regenerating you from that
[14:11] then you can say i'm not the son of
[14:13] charles and elle brown like brother
[14:14] brown did on community message not
[14:16] denying there's no way he was denying
[14:18] where he came from
[14:20] listen people he wasn't stupid he was a
[14:22] human he knew where his kids came from
[14:25] he wasn't denying that
[14:28] he said his father was a drunk
[14:30] they didn't even they weren't even
[14:32] religious didn't even go to church he
[14:33] didn't go to church i was reading the
[14:34] other day he said he polished his
[14:36] forward on sunday
[14:38] he said he polished it until he almost
[14:39] polished the paint off of it to keep
[14:41] from going to church
[14:43] but one day god got a hold of him
[14:46] but he wasn't a christian at that time
[14:48] he was about 18 20 years old somewhere
[14:50] in there
[14:51] and
[14:53] but how god brought him you think god
[14:55] would bring him and
[14:57] i like the question that ryan brought
[14:59] last night was
[15:01] why would
[15:02] god it looks like god would be a
[15:04] respecter of persons
[15:06] if he told brother around not smoke not
[15:08] to drink and he didn't do those things
[15:10] but it's like we all kind of conferred
[15:12] and
[15:13] and the point was and and the point i
[15:15] made was
[15:16] was that god was not protecting the man
[15:18] william branham he was protecting the
[15:20] gift that was coming right
[15:23] it was not protecting william branham if
[15:25] that case would be he would be a
[15:27] respecter of persons but he was he was
[15:30] he was holding that gift
[15:33] but the gift had to come through that
[15:35] man but now look people
[15:37] he tried to drink
[15:39] he tried to smoke
[15:42] he tried to commit suicide it wasn't
[15:44] that he never
[15:45] tried those things god allowed him to
[15:47] try it
[15:48] you know to try to do it not to drive
[15:50] but just trying to do it to show that he
[15:52] was human
[15:53] if those bullets would have went off he
[15:55] would have killed those kids and been a
[15:56] murderer right pointed the gun right out
[15:58] and pulled the trigger was going to kill
[16:00] him right was going to kill that man
[16:02] that poisoned his dog
[16:04] was put the gun to his head pull the
[16:06] trigger the gun didn't go off put it
[16:07] down the ground shot all six shots right
[16:09] on the ground
[16:12] he tried
[16:14] but god was not protecting william brown
[16:17] when he was protecting his guilt because
[16:19] when god was finished with him the devil
[16:21] got him
[16:22] that's right
[16:23] he was born with that gift exactly he
[16:25] wasn't born
[16:27] right
[16:28] he was born with a gift because gifts
[16:29] and callings are without repentance
[16:31] right
[16:33] you've seen times when i've seen times
[16:35] that people were out in the world just
[16:37] be a just be a total center but have a
[16:40] little gift to be able to tell things
[16:42] about people i'm saying it myself
[16:45] and you know somebody be a little
[16:47] a little bit well all those psychics
[16:48] what do they do brother brown said they
[16:50] pervert what god shows they pervert it
[16:53] they can enter a realm
[16:55] they can enter a realm where they can
[16:57] actually see look at the witch of endor
[16:59] she brought samuel right up out of out
[17:01] of paradise
[17:03] but brother brown said that was before
[17:05] christ died after christ died you can't
[17:08] do that anymore
[17:09] because they went straight into paradise
[17:11] they weren't in the bosom i mean they
[17:12] went straight into heaven they weren't
[17:14] weren't in paradise or the bosom of
[17:16] abraham so
[17:17] but this
[17:18] person that we're talking about
[17:22] that john brings the genealogy down and
[17:24] says this person is
[17:27] the only begotten of the father
[17:30] full of grace
[17:33] and truth
[17:35] now let's go to colossians 1.
[17:54] okay verse 15. very familiar scripture
[17:57] but we have to bring this down to the
[18:00] person
[18:02] who is the image of the invisible god
[18:05] in other words
[18:08] colossians paul is showing that the son
[18:10] of god that created all the heaven and
[18:12] earth was now embodied
[18:15] in the son of man
[18:19] the firstborn
[18:21] of every creature
[18:23] colossians 1 15.
[18:26] the firstborn of every creature
[18:29] for by him were all things created that
[18:32] are in heaven and they're in earth
[18:33] visible and invisible
[18:36] whether they be thrones or dominions or
[18:37] principalities or powers all things were
[18:39] created by him and for him
[18:42] and he is before all things and by him
[18:45] all things consist by who by this son
[18:48] the one who
[18:49] was the first born of every creature
[18:52] okay
[18:54] and he is the head of the body of the
[18:56] church who is the beginning the
[18:57] firstborn from the dead that in all
[18:59] things he might have the preeminence
[19:02] for it please the father that in him
[19:04] should all fullness
[19:06] dwell now let's go to revelation 3
[19:15] god brought his family down through
[19:17] revelations 1 2 now look at number
[19:20] look at three
[19:21] the last church age sums it up
[19:26] 14.
[19:30] and until the angel of the church of the
[19:31] laodiceans write these things saith the
[19:33] amen
[19:34] the faithful and true witness the
[19:36] beginning of the creation
[19:38] of god
[19:41] the beginning
[19:42] of the creation of god now we know god
[19:45] cannot be created
[19:47] he's the one that does the creating
[19:50] but for our side
[19:53] this is for us dummies to realize
[19:56] that there had to be a beginning of our
[19:58] thoughts of what god was
[20:01] because we can't think eternal thoughts
[20:03] yet
[20:04] all right so there's a time we didn't
[20:06] know him
[20:07] all right
[20:08] the firstborn from the dead we know was
[20:10] jesus christ the firstborn from the dead
[20:12] and what did he do he resurrected
[20:14] if he had not resurrected he would have
[20:16] died like like um
[20:19] ryan
[20:20] asks another good question
[20:24] why was abel not in a genealogy if you
[20:26] don't bring four children
[20:28] you don't have a genealogy
[20:31] remember cain killed abel
[20:34] so abel's it says adam seth and right on
[20:36] down through they left amble out
[20:39] well there was a reason why they left
[20:40] abel and came both out
[20:42] he left kane out because cain had no
[20:44] national
[20:45] natural genetic line from adam
[20:48] his genetic line came from the beast
[20:51] natural
[20:53] abel's natural line come from adam
[20:56] but he didn't read gene or regenerate
[20:58] anybody
[21:00] adam begot seth and then seth had a
[21:03] child named enos so there he perpetuated
[21:06] his
[21:07] genealogy seth was killed remember i
[21:10] mean abel was killed remember so abel
[21:12] couldn't have a genealogy if you were
[21:14] killed before you had kids your genetic
[21:16] your genetic line stops right
[21:20] so that's why able was not putting any
[21:22] kind of in any genetic lineup
[21:25] because you didn't have children
[21:27] all right
[21:28] showing
[21:29] now what was able to type of christ
[21:33] abel and seth
[21:35] abel died
[21:38] i've gotten a man from the lord
[21:40] eve said brother brown said that was
[21:42] christ that was a type of christ dying
[21:45] and then seth being part of the
[21:47] resurrection bringing the species on out
[21:49] because this is the firstborn from the
[21:51] dead what did he do he resurrected that
[21:54] never happened before
[21:56] okay we know lazarus came for us but
[21:58] lazarus died again but this man
[22:00] we're going to go in isaiah and read for
[22:02] just a minute before we go
[22:04] about what this man did
[22:06] uh
[22:08] where it says who is the image of the
[22:10] invisible god the firstborn of every
[22:13] creature
[22:15] now
[22:16] bring you back home i'm going colossians
[22:19] 1
[22:22] colossians 1 15.
[22:25] the question is the first one of every
[22:28] creature
[22:29] for by him were all things created he's
[22:32] going to both
[22:33] that's before adam that's before and
[22:36] again but the firstborn
[22:38] of every creature the logos wasn't born
[22:41] was it no but jesus remember brother
[22:43] branham said that
[22:45] that god was not a creation but only in
[22:47] christ
[22:49] was he a creation remember this is our
[22:51] for our brain not for his
[22:53] god didn't god didn't die
[22:57] god can't die
[22:58] right
[22:59] the son of man the flesh man died
[23:02] to show brother brown said it was an
[23:04] actual play
[23:06] you don't die
[23:08] we think that ends everything no you
[23:09] don't die right
[23:11] right
[23:12] but the firstborn of every creature
[23:17] so the image of the invisible god the
[23:19] firstborn
[23:21] of every creature and actually scofield
[23:24] goes right straight to revelation 3 14.
[23:28] go right to revelation 3 14
[23:31] the beginning of the creation of god
[23:34] jesus christ
[23:36] not the flesh man jesus christ created
[23:39] all things but remember in god's mind he
[23:42] had to be a baby
[23:44] we got to remember that remember god's
[23:46] not
[23:47] in a line
[23:49] everything to god's right here
[23:52] every present
[23:54] god can't be a day older than he was you
[23:57] know 57 billion trillion years ago he's
[24:00] not a day older
[24:02] so he knew that jesus christ would come
[24:04] be the firstborn of every creature he's
[24:06] the one who created it all right so
[24:08] everything what came forth from him
[24:11] right the logos everything came forth
[24:13] from that logo because it says even the
[24:15] creation
[24:16] whole creation
[24:18] came from this jesus christ because it
[24:20] says
[24:21] it says right here
[24:23] by him all things were created
[24:28] so it was all born from him anyway
[24:30] see this is talking about the whole
[24:32] world then he narrows it down
[24:35] verse 18 the firstborn from the dead
[24:39] firstborn from the dead
[24:43] what
[24:44] he died
[24:46] he rose again
[24:48] nobody's ever done that before
[24:51] and continued living
[24:55] so he is before all things and by him
[24:57] all things consist and he is the head of
[24:59] the body of the church
[25:00] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[25:02] the dead
[25:04] that in all things he might have
[25:06] preeminence
[25:07] everything was made by him everything
[25:10] begun from him that man christ the logos
[25:14] the the word
[25:15] the speech
[25:16] and it was god
[25:19] you can't make any difference out of
[25:20] that it was god
[25:22] but there had to be a time
[25:24] that it was born from his
[25:27] you know
[25:30] take a thought
[25:32] take a thought
[25:33] that thought had to be born in your
[25:35] brain somewhere
[25:37] right
[25:39] he had to be born he had to be in in its
[25:41] infancy
[25:42] then from that thought comes a lot of
[25:44] other things right
[25:47] a lot of things come from that little
[25:48] thought that you had about
[25:49] something and then it just evolved same
[25:51] way god is only pro the only problem we
[25:53] have is
[25:55] naturally we don't remember nothing and
[25:57] then we have a thought and it comes up
[25:59] god always knew but there had to have a
[26:01] time that god spoke something and right
[26:03] there is when it started
[26:05] was the earth is the earth eternal
[26:08] we know it's going to be made eternal
[26:10] right
[26:12] but it wasn't before all things
[26:14] there's only one thing that was before
[26:16] all things and that was this logos that
[26:18] we're talking about this right here
[26:20] this was before all things right the son
[26:25] the son
[26:26] the son is the one that done the
[26:27] creating
[26:28] but it's not another god it's him moving
[26:31] over in another form so we can
[26:32] understand him right people this is all
[26:35] this is nothing for god that's all for
[26:37] us that's right it's for us to be able
[26:39] to understand god already knows
[26:41] right he's all-knowing
[26:43] we can't we tend to forget that
[26:45] that that god did all this to remind
[26:48] himself of something no he didn't
[26:50] he's reminding us right of all this
[26:53] that's going on he's he's getting us to
[26:55] where we can understand how can you
[26:56] understand something a god how can one
[26:59] person understand a god that made
[27:00] everything
[27:03] every universe every star er all the sun
[27:07] and all the components of that sun and
[27:09] spoke and said that sun will never go
[27:11] will never stop burning
[27:14] who did that the human being's what
[27:16] amazes me that all the he made all the
[27:19] things sure
[27:21] that don't work this doesn't work that
[27:22] don't work
[27:24] what gets me is is when god starts with
[27:26] that one little seed
[27:27] and how do the how does my fingers
[27:31] know not to grow together
[27:35] i mean my armpit this this cell knows to
[27:37] grow to this one to put this together
[27:39] but why doesn't these little cells in
[27:41] here
[27:44] because the baby's not like this all the
[27:45] time
[27:46] he comes from little nubs and then it
[27:48] comes out then all of a sudden these
[27:49] cells start forming around some way
[27:51] somehow
[27:53] to me that's a mystery
[27:56] exactly
[27:58] i mean
[27:59] oh darn a
[28:00] mystery a mystery
[28:03] but god has made that mystery so simple
[28:06] now
[28:07] until we can understand because he
[28:08] started look at all the times in the
[28:10] bible he said the firstborn from the
[28:12] dead the firstborn from this in the
[28:14] beginning in the beginning what god
[28:17] don't have a beginning
[28:20] in the beginning of our understanding
[28:22] right
[28:23] of this eternal person
[28:25] he created the world in the beginning
[28:28] god created heaven and earth in what
[28:30] beginning
[28:31] he'd have a beginning
[28:33] if he had a beginning he ain't god
[28:37] so in our beginning of understanding god
[28:39] maybe that's what we ought to read in
[28:41] genesis
[28:42] in the beginning in our beginning of our
[28:44] understanding of god he created heaven
[28:45] and the earth
[28:47] in our understanding in our beginning we
[28:50] of understanding god we see this man
[28:52] come from here this man that we can't
[28:54] understand to this man that we can't
[28:56] understand mean to me that's the only
[28:58] way i know to put it
[29:00] in in simple terms
[29:03] but let's go like that flesh man easier
[29:05] than we can relate to that spirit man
[29:07] well absolutely absolutely because we
[29:10] but we've got to believe it because we
[29:11] never saw him in that human form that's
[29:13] right
[29:14] we never saw him in human flesh exactly
[29:15] you got to be a believer okay you got to
[29:17] believe that that man right there walked
[29:19] the shores of galilee and that man was
[29:21] in him that's right yeah but that man
[29:23] was limited by what that man could do
[29:24] because he had to breathe he had to eat
[29:26] he had to do the things of the world
[29:28] because he was the firstborn
[29:30] firstborn
[29:32] birth
[29:33] because he could be our brother there's
[29:35] no way milk has it can be our brother he
[29:38] wasn't born what right
[29:40] there's no way melchizedek could be our
[29:42] brother
[29:44] because he was created adam couldn't
[29:45] even be our brother that's why adam
[29:47] couldn't be our i mean our father he
[29:49] couldn't be our father
[29:52] because he wasn't a baby the bible says
[29:54] you got to be a kinsmen well we didn't
[29:56] all start growing
[29:58] we started as a baby let's go down to
[30:00] that 53 and we'll read that's where
[30:02] we'll begin in two weeks
[30:04] lord it's already october
[30:09] and then y'all gonna have a lot of
[30:12] november
[30:14] the
[30:17] 13th
[30:19] and the 21st
[30:21] and the 20th
[30:24] of 21st 13th and 21st
[30:28] y'all have
[30:29] substitute
[30:31] teachers
[30:42] i think 53 who has believed i reported
[30:44] whom in the arm of the lord revealed now
[30:45] we're going to break this down i'm going
[30:47] to read it fast give you a little seed
[30:49] to think about then we'll start over all
[30:51] right
[30:52] preacher grew up before him as a tender
[30:54] plant this isaiah is explaining jesus
[30:56] christ
[30:58] all right
[31:00] 2 000 years before he gets here
[31:02] or actually 1300 years before he got
[31:04] there
[31:04] all right all right actually i'm sorry
[31:06] 700 years before he got there
[31:09] he has no form of coming us and when we
[31:11] shall see him there is no beauty that we
[31:12] should desire
[31:14] he is despised and rejected of men a man
[31:16] of sorrow acquainted with grief now as
[31:17] you talk about this man
[31:19] or this man
[31:20] this man
[31:22] he was despised and we esteemed him not
[31:24] surely he had borne our grief and
[31:26] carried our sorrow yet we did esteem him
[31:28] stricken smitten of god and afflicted
[31:30] but he was wounded for our transgression
[31:32] he was bruised for our iniquities which
[31:35] has ties one of our peace was upon him
[31:37] and with his stripes we are healed
[31:39] all we like sheep have gone astray we
[31:41] have turned everyone to his own way and
[31:42] the lord hath laid on him the iniquity
[31:44] of us all
[31:45] he was oppressed and afflicted yet he
[31:47] opened out his mouth he has brought us a
[31:49] lamb to the slaughter and the sheep
[31:50] before his sheer is done so he opened on
[31:53] his mouth
[31:54] now
[31:54] verse 8 isaiah is fixing to get ready to
[31:58] show us what's going on because he's
[32:01] fixing to separate the two men all right
[32:04] or the the way that we're going to be
[32:05] redeemed
[32:09] because actually if you'll read verse 3
[32:12] through
[32:13] twelve
[32:14] that's your sixth full purpose of daniel
[32:17] okay finish the transgression make an
[32:19] end of sin look how many times says
[32:20] transgression iniquity sin all that
[32:22] right
[32:23] he was taken from prison and from
[32:24] judgment and who shall declare his
[32:26] generation there we go back to abel
[32:30] because isaiah knew let's interpolate
[32:33] just a moment isaiah's thinking
[32:36] isaiah thought verse 1 through
[32:39] 7 this guy must have to die
[32:43] because look what he's doing
[32:45] look at all that he was despised
[32:47] rejected wounded bruised
[32:51] he knew this man wasn't gonna make it
[32:54] this man wasn't gonna make it right but
[32:56] he said who shall declare his generation
[32:58] now generation is what genealogy
[33:02] isaiah knows he's cut off from among his
[33:04] people in other words they're gonna kill
[33:05] him he cannot regenerate himself in the
[33:08] grave for he was cut off out of the land
[33:12] of the living all right he's going to
[33:13] die
[33:15] for the transgression of my people was
[33:16] he stricken and he made his grave with a
[33:18] wicked with a rich in his death because
[33:20] he had done no violence neither was any
[33:22] of the seat in his mouth now here's
[33:24] where he's going to declare his
[33:26] generation yet it pleased the lord to
[33:27] bruise him he has put him to grief but
[33:29] thou shalt make his soul
[33:32] an offering
[33:33] for sin
[33:35] he shall see his seed now when you see
[33:37] seed
[33:39] you've regenerated
[33:41] when he shall see his seed in other
[33:43] words when when i became a father and
[33:45] saw josh i knew my generation at least
[33:47] would go one more time
[33:49] but here's a god has put his soul on the
[33:51] line
[33:52] all right we need to stop right there
[33:54] but he put his soul on the line
[33:56] he shall see his seed prolong his days
[33:58] and the pleasure of the lord shall
[33:59] prosper in his hand he shall see the
[34:01] travail of his soul and shall be
[34:02] satisfied
[34:04] by his knowledge shall my righteous
[34:05] servant justify a minute where he shall
[34:07] bear their iniquities therefore will
[34:08] that divide him a portion with the great
[34:10] and he shall divide his poor the strong
[34:12] because he hath poured out in his soul
[34:15] unto death not in death you cannot kill
[34:17] us all
[34:18] right but he poured it out unto death
[34:21] and we'll we'll just think look up that
[34:23] word unto
[34:25] it may help you a little bit all right
[34:27] let's go up front thanks for being here
[34:37] uh
