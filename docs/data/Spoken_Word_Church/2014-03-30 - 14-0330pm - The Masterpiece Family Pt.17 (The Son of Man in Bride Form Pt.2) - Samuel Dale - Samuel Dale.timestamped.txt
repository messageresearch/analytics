[10:36] you for everything
[10:37] we ask you to just come among us now
[10:39] this afternoon and speak to our hearts
[10:41] and our lives
[10:42] we believe lord this is the day and the
[10:44] hour of the manifestation
[10:47] of your person of your being among us in
[10:50] the way that's to be in the end time
[10:52] and that's forward is father something
[10:54] let's look forward to
[10:56] because we spoke of it for all these
[10:59] years
[11:00] and we've tried to encourage people to
[11:02] believe it
[11:04] and to recognize who we are lord we love
[11:08] you
[11:08] and we thank you guide us now as we read
[11:11] your scripture you have your way with
[11:13] each and every one of us
[11:14] in jesus name amen
[11:19] in psalms 8
[11:22] what is man that dark mindful of him
[11:26] and the son of man that thou visited him
[11:28] for thou has made him a little lower
[11:30] than the angels
[11:31] and has crowned him with glory and honor
[11:34] all right we know who that is
[11:36] the lord jesus christ is the son of man
[11:38] okay
[11:39] but then speaking of the bride becoming
[11:41] christ made manifest
[11:44] look how that ties together thou made us
[11:46] him to have dominion
[11:48] over the works of thy hands that has put
[11:51] all things
[11:52] under his feet we know that all sheep
[11:55] and oxen
[11:56] yea and the beasts of the field the fowl
[11:57] of the air fish of the sea
[11:59] and whatsoever passes through the paths
[12:02] of
[12:02] the sea they are in the control of the
[12:06] son of man
[12:07] okay genesis 1
[12:10] 26 and god said let us make man in our
[12:13] image
[12:15] after our likeness and let them have
[12:16] dominion over the fish of the sea
[12:18] and over the file of the iron over the
[12:20] cattle and over all the earth and
[12:22] over every creeping thing that creepeth
[12:24] upon the earth
[12:25] so god created man in his own image and
[12:27] the image of god created he
[12:29] him male and female created he them
[12:32] and god blessed them and god said unto
[12:34] them be fruitful
[12:36] and multiply and replenish which the
[12:39] word replenish there means to feel
[12:41] it doesn't mean that there was people
[12:43] back before then
[12:45] and something happened to them and then
[12:46] you got to replenish
[12:48] the original says to feel the hebrew
[12:51] word in our heart
[12:53] and subdue it and have dominion over the
[12:55] fish of the sea and over the fall of the
[12:57] air
[12:57] and over every living thing that moveth
[12:59] upon the earth okay
[13:01] revelations then we go to revelations
[13:04] one
[13:06] 12 and i turned to see the voice that
[13:08] spake with me and being turned
[13:11] i saw seven golden candle sticks and in
[13:14] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[13:15] like unto the son of man
[13:17] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[13:19] and gird about the pouch
[13:21] with a golden girdle before you're
[13:23] seated then let's read revelations
[13:25] 10 1 and i saw another mighty angel come
[13:31] down from heaven
[13:32] clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was
[13:34] upon his head
[13:35] and his face was it where the sun and
[13:37] his feet were as pillars of fire
[13:40] brother branham says that the seventh
[13:43] angel is on earth at the time of
[13:46] this coming that's right all right so
[13:48] you may be seated the lord had his
[13:50] blessing
[13:51] to the reading of the word you'll see in
[13:54] a moment when we get back to it what i'm
[13:56] talking about on the revelations 10.
[14:00] okay now we got over to the point this
[14:04] morning
[14:04] of covering the uh
[14:09] we're talking about we've been talking
[14:12] about
[14:13] the uh things showing who the bride
[14:17] is and what god thinks of her
[14:21] and how he declares her in the word
[14:24] you know for the time and as i tried to
[14:27] cover this morning see i believe
[14:29] then that there must be a
[14:32] word for ever age
[14:35] but there also must be a people there
[14:38] must be a prophet to bring that word
[14:41] to the people and that's why brother
[14:43] brown would call
[14:44] luther wesley and then he would say the
[14:47] great prophet sent there on
[14:48] azusa street and there would be a
[14:50] message each one of those
[14:52] angels would be declared as being a
[14:54] prophet
[14:55] and there would be a message and a
[14:57] people to live that message
[14:59] all right and i believe that's where
[15:01] we're at we're in the time
[15:03] of where the the life angels message has
[15:06] been declared
[15:07] we're not looking for another messenger
[15:09] to come to the gentile dispensation
[15:13] and then that way we know that the hour
[15:17] is at hand
[15:18] and surely we ought to be able to
[15:20] believe it by now after
[15:22] some 40 years 50 years after the prophet
[15:25] has said these things and we're we're
[15:28] really
[15:29] you know if it's not then i
[15:33] ask you and i the question
[15:36] what will happen what is it going to be
[15:39] is time just
[15:40] going to fade out and
[15:43] and we got to just just be gone we just
[15:46] all die
[15:46] my brother has that philosophy that the
[15:49] end of the world comes every day to a
[15:51] person who passes away
[15:54] you don't realize that's what you're
[15:55] thinking that it's just we're passing
[15:57] away
[15:57] the end of the world's coming we're just
[16:00] you know doing
[16:01] and uh he said sure the bible's written
[16:04] to where you can take it to where it
[16:06] would mean this or where it would mean
[16:07] that
[16:08] but said nobody knows that's what it
[16:10] means well
[16:11] we've had a prophet to tell us that's
[16:13] what it means all right
[16:15] so when he told us that's what it means
[16:18] then we can rejoice
[16:19] in thinking about what it means all
[16:22] right
[16:23] see then we got down we covered this
[16:25] morning or
[16:26] reviewed just coming back and
[16:29] quoting about the bride would be the
[16:31] fullness of the godhead bodily
[16:33] he'd be dwelling in his church here in
[16:36] the end time
[16:37] we gave these quotes of what paragraph
[16:40] 146
[16:41] of christ of mr god revealed paragraph
[16:44] 159
[16:45] of of uh i believe that's the same one
[16:48] and then we got down to the mighty god
[16:50] unveiled
[16:51] where the prophet was covering that god
[16:54] in in
[16:55] man now it was god in man now it's god
[16:58] in men the fullness of the godhead
[17:00] bodily
[17:00] in his entire church he gets over to
[17:03] god's only provided place of worship
[17:05] no leaven among you that brings the
[17:08] entire fullness of the godhead bodily
[17:10] among you
[17:12] lean not to your own understanding he
[17:14] covers that god isn't complete
[17:17] without you all right see then we got on
[17:21] down to
[17:22] kind of ending this morning of how that
[17:26] who is this son of man and we went
[17:29] through it's the rising of the sun
[17:31] paragraph 93 where it says in the
[17:34] beginning was the word
[17:36] right you know who is the son of man the
[17:40] word
[17:40] made flesh amen now analyze a point this
[17:44] is a little
[17:47] if you're talking about a son
[17:51] a son uh
[17:55] when it infers or shows that you mean
[17:59] there's a father
[18:02] all right and that means a son is an
[18:05] offspring
[18:06] or someone come forth from
[18:10] right now when you say son all right
[18:13] so then this one that we're talking
[18:15] about
[18:16] had to come down so that's the only way
[18:19] you could refer to him
[18:20] when jesus would talk about himself
[18:22] being the son of man
[18:25] he was an offspring not another person
[18:30] but to sign god made manifest in human
[18:33] flesh
[18:35] called the son all right
[18:39] signifying the body would have a
[18:40] beginning all right
[18:42] but the god within her is real and no
[18:45] such thing
[18:46] all right so then we read in the
[18:48] psalmist that
[18:49] what is man the dark mindful of him or
[18:51] the son of man
[18:53] you know see then it would mean that
[18:58] god would be living in flesh right son
[19:02] of offspring or something come forth man
[19:05] amen all right so then you would have to
[19:09] come down
[19:10] to a human uh element
[19:13] or thoughts to bring in the word man
[19:18] and i know it work uses the word man or
[19:20] or the word man can be used as mankind
[19:23] because that's that's just terminology
[19:25] in english
[19:27] and i'm poor on that but i do know
[19:29] that's what it means when the bible
[19:30] would say their in genesis let us make
[19:32] man
[19:33] it doesn't mean just all the men was
[19:34] made and women would make
[19:36] you know like that it means mankind
[19:41] right so then that would bring it down
[19:44] to showing us
[19:45] and that's why we read the scriptures as
[19:47] we did
[19:48] to show that in saying what jesus
[19:52] was almighty god made manifest in human
[19:54] flesh
[19:55] that's why he would be called a son
[19:58] not that he had a beginning as a as god
[20:01] he was god all the time but he had a
[20:04] beginning of earthly
[20:05] element time all right a creation
[20:09] all right and that he would be the son
[20:11] of man
[20:14] and remember we covered son of man a few
[20:16] weeks ago and brother branham what was
[20:18] it was it christ the mystery where he
[20:19] says
[20:20] it but anyhow he said that's the only
[20:23] way he could be father
[20:25] that's right was to be the son of man
[20:28] but then he's talking about a group of
[20:30] people
[20:32] that would be like him or be him
[20:35] may manifest in another form and that's
[20:38] all i'm talking about
[20:40] a bride and we are the bride of christ
[20:44] all right then the complete church
[20:45] together makes the fullness of the
[20:47] godhead body
[20:48] amen that shouldn't be any problem
[20:52] with our understanding all right
[20:56] see then it would come over into
[20:59] being made manifest remember we covered
[21:03] there's a word forever age but there's
[21:05] somebody to make that manifest
[21:06] right the prophet has to bring it
[21:08] someone to make it manifest
[21:10] all right the prophet has brought the
[21:12] message in the end
[21:14] but there's got to be somebody to make
[21:16] it manifest right right i mean that's
[21:18] going to be somewhere
[21:19] why can't we contend we're part of it
[21:22] all right
[21:22] i mean that's just simple language
[21:25] that's not a big thing
[21:27] uh you know if i was a baptist today i
[21:29] wouldn't be scared to say or
[21:31] sorry to say or afraid to say or ashamed
[21:33] to say
[21:34] that that i was a baptist what
[21:37] a problem would you i mean i'm a human
[21:42] i don't say i'm a monkey i mean act like
[21:45] one
[21:46] they look like one but i'm still a human
[21:49] being
[21:50] all right but do you understand the
[21:52] connection what i'm saying son
[21:54] of man would mean
[21:57] the word was going to be in flesh
[22:02] in a man upon the earth
[22:07] and that was jesus christ now you put
[22:10] that christ
[22:11] into the church and what have you got
[22:15] you got jesus christ made manifest
[22:20] so when you started your church ages
[22:24] right which is in the book of
[22:27] revelations
[22:28] so then what i've said all along should
[22:30] be dawning on you that
[22:32] the book of revelations is showing
[22:35] god made manifest but it's showing where
[22:38] he's at
[22:39] right amen when we leave here
[22:42] he goes with 144 000.
[22:45] he's being made manifest to them right
[22:49] that's right then why can't we believe
[22:52] who we are and it's not
[22:55] who we are it is who has made us
[23:00] what we are
[23:03] someone said we are his people
[23:06] the sheep of his pasture
[23:10] when are we going to start saying that
[23:13] that's right
[23:13] and it's like i said now raise your hand
[23:17] you believe you're born again i believe
[23:19] i'm born again
[23:20] he believed you you believe you're proud
[23:22] of living bride
[23:24] you're going to heaven the rapture
[23:27] i don't really know maybe you might say
[23:31] in a way
[23:33] well you're denying that you're never
[23:34] born again
[23:38] he's coming back on after the one that's
[23:40] inside of us
[23:42] this just rides alone that's why it's
[23:44] got to be changed
[23:46] right would you see what i'm saying
[23:50] i've heard people say i believe in that
[23:53] adoption
[23:54] but said that stature of pretty man's
[23:56] deep it's the same thing
[23:58] that's right amen but yet see we try to
[24:01] make it
[24:03] and really we show what we believe
[24:07] that's it amen that's right right like
[24:10] and i'm not asking you to do it like i
[24:11] said
[24:12] if i'd say raise your hand if you
[24:13] believe in everybody building on this
[24:15] shoot your hand
[24:18] i mean you shouldn't go
[24:26] i can't believe it
[24:29] no it ought to be an instantaneous right
[24:34] and you say are you going to be in the
[24:36] rapture that ought to be instantaneous
[24:38] and what that big word means all
[24:41] together is one thing in a hurry
[24:45] and we shouldn't have any stuttering
[24:48] about it
[24:49] that's right we should believe it
[24:52] then the prophet has recovered this
[24:53] morning it's a rise in the sun who is it
[24:55] son of man
[24:56] it goes right back to john 1.
[25:01] in the beginning was the word
[25:04] the only thing it comes down to verse 14
[25:08] later on right and the word was made
[25:11] flesh
[25:13] why can't we believe we are the word
[25:17] made flesh right that's right amen yes
[25:19] sir i go to that flop across me
[25:21] well i just don't see it i'm sorry
[25:25] you know what you'd be in the days of
[25:27] the lord jesus
[25:29] you would be an unbeliever
[25:35] you know what you'd be in the days of
[25:36] paul an unbeliever
[25:39] you know what you've been in the days of
[25:40] luther an unbeliever you know what you
[25:43] are now
[25:43] an unbeliever
[25:46] but i'm not trying to make us something
[25:49] right i'm trying to declare
[25:51] what the prophet has already said we are
[25:54] giving us the scriptures it says we are
[25:57] right yes sir
[25:58] why can't we believe that that's that's
[26:01] all folks that's
[26:02] you know you may differ with me in every
[26:04] form of what you think
[26:06] but just remember i got one thing in
[26:08] mind
[26:11] is to get you and i to the place
[26:15] that we ain't worried about obama and we
[26:17] ain't worried about all these other
[26:19] things
[26:20] because it won't have nothing to do with
[26:22] us
[26:30] it ain't gonna put me in the rapture
[26:31] because this pope would die and get one
[26:33] out of the united states
[26:36] and ain't gonna put me in the rapture i
[26:39] thought
[26:41] that rapture and faith would lay in the
[26:43] message
[26:47] that's right i didn't know it late in
[26:49] natural events
[26:51] that can be questioned
[26:54] like i told you the other day wearing
[26:55] all that people talk talking about now
[26:57] the blood moon
[26:59] well brother random where it says the
[27:00] moon will turn to blood he said i can
[27:02] show you when that's already happened
[27:03] right now i can't show you where it's
[27:05] already happened because i don't know
[27:06] okay he said there were seven church
[27:09] ages in the old testament
[27:11] i can't show you where they're at
[27:12] because he didn't tell me
[27:14] now he told some marion and him shouting
[27:17] singing going down through there
[27:19] after they crossed into the promised
[27:20] land or some of that cats you know
[27:23] well that one that's those things we
[27:26] know
[27:27] all right but now watch
[27:30] he gets in to recover off of proving his
[27:33] word
[27:34] who is this son of man he said it is the
[27:37] word
[27:38] well that's all i'm concerned with
[27:42] is getting you and i to believe the word
[27:45] we're reading
[27:46] amen
[27:50] i mean suppose we take a little tour
[27:55] and we would all go to some foreign
[27:58] country
[27:59] anywhere you know and uh
[28:03] they got a sign over here that says all
[28:06] u.s citizens go this way
[28:11] but they got a sign over here it says
[28:13] shortcut go this way
[28:19] let's go this way no no no
[28:23] no you're going to know that something's
[28:26] wrong
[28:28] and where it says all u.s citizens
[28:31] you go that away why because you're not
[28:34] ashamed to be called an american citizen
[28:36] right
[28:39] well why not why be ashamed of being
[28:42] called the bride of christ
[28:44] the prophet i believe it see a book
[28:46] right where he says i'll call you bride
[28:49] why be ashamed of being the bride
[28:52] if not what are you that's right
[28:56] well i think i am a hope i am maybe a
[28:58] ham will only date or might be i am you
[28:59] know
[29:03] but see there must be someone
[29:08] to make manifest or alive
[29:12] the word of the age that's why the
[29:14] prophet said the bride is to vindicate
[29:18] malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelation 10 7
[29:21] vindicate what is vindicate well dead
[29:25] raised it healed me
[29:26] he said anointed ones would do that
[29:31] it's somebody to believe it
[29:34] and just walk into it and let god just
[29:37] make it manifest right
[29:39] amen that's all
[29:42] church that i've ever tried to do is to
[29:45] believe that
[29:45] all right but we're talking about the
[29:48] son of man we spoke of that
[29:50] as that jesus christ was the son of man
[29:53] the son of god the son of david
[29:55] and brother said i am not the son of man
[29:59] he said i'm a son of man that jesus is
[30:02] the son of man the son of god the son of
[30:04] david
[30:05] all right now to make him any more than
[30:08] that we would be running into the wrong
[30:10] thing right
[30:10] that's right so we're only trying to
[30:13] believe who we are
[30:15] okay we got down and we started reading
[30:18] some things
[30:19] but before we do i want you to i want to
[30:21] remind you of this and
[30:23] i don't mind preaching more on it i
[30:27] i got past all that you know
[30:32] i just love the word
[30:35] but what about a prophet
[30:38] that could put the scriptures and things
[30:40] in this place
[30:42] right to tell us the things
[30:47] and now that he would go back to genesis
[30:49] 1
[30:50] and show that that man in genesis 1 is
[30:54] not a physical
[30:55] man right that's right
[31:00] genesis 2 is the physical man
[31:03] genesis 1 is the spiritual man all right
[31:06] we're not talking about we are the
[31:08] physical lord jesus christ
[31:14] no no we are him made manifest
[31:17] which would mean he's in another form
[31:20] called a bride all right
[31:24] see then reading it that way didn't come
[31:26] into revelations 1
[31:28] 12 and 13. and where that we went
[31:31] through and we've been through it over
[31:33] and over
[31:33] john turns to see the voice
[31:38] the prophet said while we're not a
[31:40] denomination he sees
[31:44] bride
[31:46] then he covers that gird about to pounce
[31:49] with a golden girdle he says
[31:51] that's not masculine that's feminist
[31:54] then he covers that we are his shoulders
[31:57] we are the
[31:58] the government is upon his shoulder amen
[32:01] that's why he's girded about the pouch
[32:03] not around the waist waist with service
[32:05] you know servant all right
[32:09] and then we go over into and i'm just
[32:12] making our fights run through
[32:14] we go over into revelations two and
[32:17] three and
[32:18] and we study the church ages and what
[32:20] was for each age and how marvelous those
[32:22] things
[32:23] the prophet could lay that age right
[32:25] down with those
[32:26] ages that even with a little bit of
[32:28] understanding we have of
[32:30] of history that we could look back and
[32:33] see luther
[32:34] in his age and wesley and his age you
[32:37] know and follow it
[32:39] and then come out into chapter 3 there
[32:41] are about verse 14
[32:42] and it comes out to be the beginning of
[32:45] the creation of god
[32:47] and brother brown said he's the
[32:48] beginning of the creation of god and he
[32:50] said we're the continuation of that
[32:52] creation
[32:53] not another creation
[32:56] god made manifest in human beings
[33:02] well i i can kind of see a little bit
[33:03] back there brother dale and
[33:05] you know kind of some of my ages but you
[33:07] talk about son of man over here
[33:09] i normally see it brother branham well
[33:14] i would remind you that in the book of
[33:16] revelations
[33:17] there's a chapter four that one man
[33:21] would go up that's right it would
[33:23] represent the entire bride
[33:25] right as a rapture amen amen
[33:28] it reminds you of those signs well see
[33:31] then
[33:31] you could see that we have our place in
[33:33] position yes
[33:35] that we are in the seventh church age no
[33:38] now brother that we're not in the age
[33:39] we're called out
[33:40] there never was a bride in that age show
[33:43] me any bride in an age
[33:46] the new birth calls you out of the age
[33:49] it don't matter what age you're in
[33:50] luther west
[33:51] you're calling out of the age into the
[33:54] kingdom of god
[33:55] amen
[34:00] we'll see the later seeing age is still
[34:01] here
[34:03] it's going on and we're going over and
[34:05] connect to the millennium
[34:07] you know your profit covers because
[34:08] there's not another gap age in there
[34:10] somewhere else every night
[34:14] all right but see then we can look at
[34:17] that and see how things would lay so
[34:19] close together
[34:22] and then the prophet would talk about
[34:23] this being revelation 1
[34:27] 12 and 13 being the son of man
[34:32] in bride form
[34:36] in bride form look at what he's been
[34:39] shown ass
[34:42] that's why it says one like unto the son
[34:44] of man
[34:48] and then he goes over
[34:53] to revelations 10.
[34:58] and we get over to revelations 10
[35:01] there's an angel standing there with a
[35:03] rainbow over his head
[35:05] chapter 10 verse 1. we read
[35:09] chapter verse 7 or 4 but we don't
[35:12] hardly deal with verse 1. all right
[35:16] but he gets in the seal book in the
[35:17] breach between the church ages and the
[35:20] seals
[35:21] program 29 he's covering the thunders
[35:24] and things of
[35:25] it's the time for it
[35:29] and i saw another another mighty angel
[35:31] come down from heaven
[35:32] glow with a cloud and a rainbow upon his
[35:34] head
[35:36] brother says the seventh angel is on
[35:39] earth
[35:40] at the time of this coming run it in
[35:43] your computer sometime
[35:44] time of this coming and you'll see the
[35:48] quote i'll be glad to give it to you
[35:50] but he said if you notice that's christ
[35:55] because he in the old testament was
[35:57] called the angel of the covenant
[35:59] and he's directly coming to the jew jews
[36:02] now
[36:03] for the church is finished see all right
[36:07] and let's face it where the sun his feet
[36:09] is filler to fire if you remember that
[36:11] angel
[36:12] in revelations 1.
[36:15] he's talking about revelations 10 1
[36:17] right right
[36:19] come on that's what's in revelations 10
[36:21] 1.
[36:24] one with a rainbow around his head
[36:28] he said you remember that angel in
[36:29] revelation one
[36:31] same thing
[36:36] angel is a messenger and he's a
[36:38] messenger to israel
[36:40] the church has been raptured so you now
[36:42] are fixing
[36:44] to be raptured he comes for his church
[36:48] program 44 of the breach
[36:52] it's a book of redemption from god all
[36:54] the mysteries at this time should be
[36:56] finished
[36:56] at the sounding of this messenger now
[37:00] here's the angel on earth
[37:03] and another mighty angel come down
[37:07] see this angel was an earthly angel
[37:11] are you reading it
[37:15] but here comes one down from heaven
[37:18] a rainbow covenant see only christ it
[37:21] could be
[37:23] just exactly like it was in revelations
[37:26] first chapter standing in the midst of
[37:29] the seven
[37:31] golden candlesticks
[37:37] so he makes revelations 1 and
[37:39] revelations 10 1 the same
[37:46] am i reading
[37:51] so then he goes on over to
[37:54] let's see souls that are in prison now
[37:57] go ahead with the next one
[38:00] i didn't know they was going to get up
[38:01] with me today with these i just kind of
[38:02] don't quote it in
[38:04] they'll get it in a second
[38:07] paragraph 156
[38:12] sold in prison 1963 right
[38:18] is it 63 yeah 63 11 10
[38:22] morning notice it was to be the seventh
[38:25] angel's message
[38:26] that was to reveal the seventh the seven
[38:29] seals
[38:30] revelations 10 7. now you'll find it see
[38:35] now watch it and he saw this angel come
[38:38] down
[38:40] put his foot on the land and on the sea
[38:42] that's revelations 10
[38:44] 1. that was christ
[38:47] yes had a rainbow over his head notice
[38:51] him
[38:52] you'll find him in revelations one again
[38:57] with the rainbow over his head look upon
[39:00] his jasper and sardis and so forth
[39:02] here he come put his hand one foot on
[39:04] land want to see
[39:05] it was christ
[39:08] right yes put in revelations 10
[39:13] in revelations 1.
[39:16] together and he's showing the same
[39:20] christ
[39:21] amen all right
[39:24] see we want to go over to 10 4 10 7.
[39:28] especially 10-4 where we can what are
[39:31] the thunders
[39:34] brother brown says it's the voice of god
[39:37] when the seal broke
[39:38] right that's right i think that's 158
[39:42] of the seal book i'm not certain i'll be
[39:44] glad to find it for you if you don't
[39:45] know where it's at
[39:48] but you see what i'm talking about yes
[39:53] we don't put all of those things
[39:54] together
[39:58] i wasn't the one that said that you'll
[40:00] find him in revelations 1.
[40:05] i wasn't the one that was reading before
[40:07] now
[40:08] it would be revelations one the same
[40:10] thing
[40:14] see we're looking and wanting to make it
[40:16] one thing
[40:19] when the very purpose of sending a
[40:22] prophet was to introduce the word
[40:25] amen to the bride amen is that true
[40:29] yes the very purpose yes
[40:32] was to bring the word that the bride
[40:34] could receive it
[40:36] and become the word amen that's why now
[40:39] you're going to differ with me but
[40:42] that's why when the prophet was here god
[40:44] didn't come down and end it all right
[40:45] there
[40:46] that's right you want these quotes
[40:50] right around and said he had a lot of
[40:51] work to do talking about jesus
[40:53] we said he left some for us to do
[40:58] all right when that work's done it'll be
[41:00] over with
[41:01] yeah but it'll be over when the bride
[41:04] realizes who she is
[41:10] now i'm gonna drop say this and drop
[41:12] back
[41:14] see then when she realized who she is
[41:15] she's gonna make him manifest
[41:18] but i want to say it this way we think
[41:20] it's got to be
[41:22] healings and signs and wonders and
[41:24] speaking it and saying thus saith the
[41:26] lord are doing this
[41:30] the anointing once can do every bit of
[41:32] that that's right
[41:34] yep that's right the prophet he says
[41:38] it's the word that's right amen that's
[41:41] right
[41:42] he said satan can impersonate every gift
[41:46] that's right right right
[41:50] but said he can't bring it word by
[41:53] word
[41:56] he can't do it so then which is the most
[42:00] important
[42:02] amen that's right the signs and the
[42:04] wonders
[42:07] that they can do
[42:10] or the word that we can receive and try
[42:13] to become
[42:16] and to try to become that you know just
[42:18] america
[42:19] got two fine boys sitting there
[42:22] have you wrote them kind of a book to
[42:24] live by
[42:28] you know i mean the day that's born you
[42:31] hand them the book you say
[42:32] this is what you're supposed to do boys
[42:38] no no no no no
[42:42] you just kind of try to instruct them
[42:46] in life right god don't beat us to death
[42:50] that's right about our beings
[42:58] the kids don't have to call me every day
[42:59] and say daddy i love you
[43:04] yeah we do a lot but they don't have to
[43:08] do that for me to realize they're my
[43:10] kids
[43:12] that's true all right
[43:18] you'll find out later on about the boys
[43:21] you know
[43:22] then when they start getting goody goody
[43:23] lovey-dovey there's something wrong
[43:27] you got something in mind you're fixing
[43:30] to get it
[43:32] or they're fixing to want it
[43:36] right you think god don't know about us
[43:42] come on okay let's get on with the
[43:43] message now because we got over here
[43:45] and i want to reread some of these and
[43:48] then go on and finish it all right
[43:51] so let's go to number seven on our
[43:52] quotes that's kind of where we
[43:54] ended up with and we will
[43:57] try to start from there because i want
[43:59] you to see
[44:01] what it's talking about all right
[44:06] doctor asked me the other day i had to
[44:07] go for checking
[44:09] up and he's he's still preaching yeah
[44:14] kind of croaking a little bit you know
[44:15] but i'm still doing it
[44:18] but listen to what he said we read this
[44:19] this morning but remember
[44:23] we'll just shortcut and try to get some
[44:24] of that so the other bit the coming of
[44:26] the son of man
[44:27] and it was in the days of a lot so will
[44:29] it be god living in human flesh
[44:32] moving among us okay we've seen that in
[44:35] brother branham thank god
[44:38] i mean we wasn't there to see it but
[44:39] some of you saw it all right
[44:41] well look god living in human flesh
[44:44] moving among us
[44:46] in the form of his church in the holy
[44:49] spirit
[44:50] performing the signs in his church
[44:54] number eight christ is the mystery of
[44:56] god revealed paragraph
[44:58] 4 57
[45:01] and as it was in the days of noah so
[45:02] shall our lives
[45:04] and there's a lot when the modern billy
[45:06] graham and oral roberts we look at them
[45:07] we see them
[45:08] we recognize their day but we're going
[45:10] to recognize ours right
[45:12] one angel standing we've seen this
[45:17] you know the angel stayed back a
[45:18] messenger with abraham
[45:20] and he stood with his back and all the
[45:22] things he called him elohim showing
[45:24] who it was we've seen that god in him
[45:29] it will be manifested in his bride
[45:32] in the last days all right
[45:36] now going to number nine sirs we would
[45:39] see jesus
[45:41] 64. jesus was god in flesh and jesus
[45:46] and if jesus is in you tonight it's
[45:48] still god manifests himself in the
[45:50] last days the son of man revealing
[45:52] himself
[45:53] in his church making himself known
[45:58] son of man being revealed in the last
[46:00] days as it was
[46:01] in the days of sodom all right
[46:05] number 10 christ revealed christ is
[46:07] identified the same
[46:08] in all generations verb 209
[46:12] there was elohim manifested in the flesh
[46:17] that had ate the flesh of a cave
[46:19] drinking the milk from the cow
[46:22] and eat bread why should we wonder about
[46:24] god in the lifestyle
[46:26] right jesus said notice as it days
[46:29] and the days when the son of man shall
[46:31] be revealed
[46:32] being revealed in the last days it'll be
[46:35] like it was in the days of sodom
[46:37] god manifested in his church
[46:43] when are we going to realize that the
[46:45] human beings
[46:46] revealing himself see in human flesh
[46:49] like he was then
[46:51] all right number 11 a trial
[46:54] 64. now jesus never said in the days
[46:58] when the son of god would be revealed
[47:01] he was revealed in the church ages son
[47:03] of god revealed in churches
[47:05] but the church put him out
[47:10] they put out god in the ages
[47:15] all right now they want him there to
[47:17] heal the sick
[47:18] save the souls right right but they
[47:21] don't want him as god
[47:22] over their lives so look
[47:25] when they put him out then he would be
[47:28] revealed as son of man
[47:29] when the son of man is being revealed
[47:31] god
[47:32] manifested amongst the human beings
[47:36] like it was then son of man prophetic
[47:42] why would you argue then when the
[47:43] prophet would say
[47:45] that even azusa street
[47:49] the prophet came into zeus austria he
[47:51] said another great prophet
[47:56] but brother so and so said
[48:00] raise your right hand everybody raise
[48:01] your right hand
[48:05] hey
[48:08] brother raise his left hand because he
[48:10] can get the message
[48:12] you know what how do you know that's
[48:14] your right hand
[48:18] you've been taught that's your right
[48:19] hand
[48:23] isn't it kind of funny that we're
[48:24] standing here today looking up
[48:26] and they're on the other side of the
[48:27] world looking up explain that
[48:30] we used to thank his kids the ones on
[48:32] the other side of the earth and slanted
[48:34] eyes because it's hanging upside down
[48:44] let's see we've been told
[48:48] but they was told he was listening to
[48:49] brother brown the other night how many
[48:50] times he told about
[48:52] george washington's day he had pneumonia
[48:54] i think it was you know what he done he
[48:56] pulled his toenails and bled him a pint
[48:57] of blood
[49:00] the worst thing they could have done
[49:07] how would you like to go back to that
[49:10] oh we don't believe that
[49:13] we've advanced above that
[49:17] well why can't we advance in the gospel
[49:21] exactly that's right look
[49:25] we've been through these and i put them
[49:26] back in or
[49:29] you with your notes would have them they
[49:31] don't have to pull these up but we've
[49:33] been through this
[49:34] they brought around them in patma's
[49:36] vision they can put them up here unless
[49:37] you read them if you want to
[49:39] page 49 of patmos vision turn to see the
[49:42] voice
[49:43] john does not say that he turned to see
[49:45] the one whose voice he
[49:47] heard but turn to see the voice
[49:50] well i like that turn to see the voice
[49:52] the voice and the person
[49:53] are the same are one and the same
[49:56] jesus is the word and he reads in the
[50:00] midst of the seven golden council like
[50:01] the son of man
[50:02] what is one life who was this his bride
[50:07] one like him
[50:12] no so if revelation 1 and revelation 10
[50:15] is the same
[50:16] then you see in the bride in both places
[50:23] and remember the seventh angel is on
[50:26] earth at the time of this coming
[50:30] he said it's not a man said it's a woman
[50:32] heard about the past
[50:33] now he goes on down to why we're not a
[50:36] denomination
[50:37] he turned to see the one like unto the
[50:39] son of man slow standing close
[50:42] how was it it was a bride standing in
[50:44] the candlesticks
[50:46] drawn out
[50:49] how much greater could that be than what
[50:52] we would read let's go to 14 we'll start
[50:55] reading there
[50:57] restoration of the bride tree paragraph
[51:00] 496
[51:02] and what's the evening light come out
[51:04] for what is even light for to restore
[51:07] you you get it congregation says amen
[51:10] any light is for the same purpose that
[51:12] the morning light was for
[51:13] to restore what was cut down by the dark
[51:16] ages too wrong
[51:17] god is going to restore by shining forth
[51:20] the evening light what
[51:22] restore the whole word of god again
[51:25] the full manifestation of christ
[51:29] in his church
[51:33] why can't we believe that everything he
[51:35] did just exactly the way he did it
[51:37] it would be again in the evening light
[51:40] see what i mean
[51:41] but it was but i don't see it
[51:45] put together around the world today and
[51:48] you'll find the ministry of jesus
[51:50] christ
[51:53] the sick being healed the dead being
[51:54] raised things are happening
[51:57] that's right but because you don't see
[52:00] it with your little obiti eyes
[52:05] come on what's it for
[52:09] to restore all right
[52:12] let's read fast all right
[52:15] remember what i'm talking about i'm
[52:18] talking about the son of man
[52:20] the word made flesh to be revealed in a
[52:25] bright form
[52:27] called his church right
[52:33] once now what he says it is here in the
[52:35] mighty god unveiled before us
[52:38] paragraph 147 and jesus said as it was
[52:41] in the days of sodom so shall it be at
[52:42] the coming son of man
[52:44] deity failed again in human flesh
[52:51] uh yeah that's brother branham
[52:54] all right i've solved the case i thought
[53:00] to speak about that brother branham is a
[53:02] part of the body of christ
[53:06] he was glad to be associated in that
[53:08] form
[53:09] yeah we want to put him up above the
[53:11] bride of christ
[53:14] now we'll read in a minute we read it
[53:17] the other day or this morning
[53:20] his purpose was to reveal the word
[53:25] right now watch what he says deity
[53:28] veiled again in human flesh
[53:31] remember he's talking about son of man
[53:35] remember jesus didn't say when the son
[53:36] of god is being revealed
[53:38] in luke 17 30 17th chapter
[53:41] i believe in about the 20th and the 21st
[53:43] verse which is 17 30.
[53:46] somewhere along there he said and when
[53:48] the son of man is being revealed
[53:50] the son of man back in in
[53:53] the church again
[53:56] back in the church again revealed in
[54:00] human beings
[54:04] not just one man human beings
[54:07] not son of god but the son of man again
[54:10] back in his church again
[54:11] in the last days we find that in the
[54:13] promises
[54:14] all right go ahead modern events made
[54:18] clear by prophecy
[54:20] program 168. remember
[54:23] i didn't want to get in the church is he
[54:27] the individual he couldn't get in the
[54:30] church
[54:31] and him locked out only then
[54:34] only organization of all of them
[54:38] is this church age that he was on the
[54:40] outside all right what's he getting at
[54:41] stumbling with his words
[54:43] what's he getting at church being
[54:45] outside
[54:46] put out refuse rejected because he was
[54:49] only manifested in temporarily
[54:54] in the other churches in the form of
[54:56] justification
[54:58] so forth but here in the age that he's
[55:00] coming now
[55:02] the full manifestation of the
[55:05] vindication of jesus christ
[55:07] the same yesterday today and forever oh
[55:10] i admit we got a lot of impersonations
[55:13] we just examine it and see what it is
[55:17] watch now go to the next one
[55:22] this is taken from questions and answers
[55:25] 64
[55:26] paragraph 91 read all up above coming
[55:30] down that's the question
[55:33] he's talking about the new verse so he
[55:34] said absolutely i just explained that
[55:36] this morning
[55:38] the same on the same thing you got to
[55:40] have all stages
[55:42] you're begotten of the spirit just like
[55:45] a baby's begotten into the wound of a
[55:47] mother
[55:48] but not born until they receive the holy
[55:50] ghost that's right
[55:52] you're born then you're not converted
[55:56] you're in the process of being converted
[55:58] until that time
[56:00] now do you get the background of what
[56:01] he's using
[56:03] he's explaining the new birth but how it
[56:06] transpires
[56:08] right right now watch that's the reason
[56:13] that all these great mysteries could not
[56:15] be given to luther
[56:17] could not be given to wesley could not
[56:20] be given to the age that has just
[56:22] passed by us the pentecostal age why
[56:27] it wasn't time they were only begotten
[56:36] now the person of christ himself
[56:40] these son of man you understand
[56:43] revealing himself
[56:44] in human flesh it could not have come
[56:48] till now is that blunt enough
[56:52] could not come until now look the next
[56:56] this is the message the harvest time
[57:00] 64.
[57:04] paragraph 354 no matter and in that day
[57:07] luke 17 20 i believe it is jesus said
[57:10] when the son of man is being revealed
[57:12] not man the son of man
[57:17] now are you falling back not man is your
[57:20] mind
[57:20] remember what we read of genesis 1 26
[57:25] let us make man not man
[57:29] every man is not involved in this
[57:35] all mankind is not involved in this
[57:38] that we're talking about special
[57:41] designation of himself
[57:45] when the son of man is being revealed
[57:46] not man the son of man
[57:49] not an organization the son of man the
[57:51] word living itself again
[57:53] among the people see the word itself
[57:55] made flesh
[57:56] in you you are a reflection of this hour
[58:00] the message yes reflection of it
[58:05] in other words what's he saying somebody
[58:07] you're living it
[58:09] so you live again live the life that was
[58:11] in jesus christ
[58:13] you're in the presence of the son then
[58:15] to the
[58:16] what happens to it what happens to that
[58:18] church
[58:19] finally listen that shark pulls away
[58:24] from that wheat now are we back over to
[58:26] what son of man drive
[58:29] when it begins to be manifested what
[58:31] happened
[58:32] the life that was in the shock went on
[58:35] out in the wheat
[58:37] the light won't change the carriers
[58:39] change
[58:40] they denominate see the blades
[58:43] the tassel the shook but the wheat can't
[58:46] change
[58:47] it's got to be a ministry just exactly
[58:52] on the word like he was on the word
[58:55] and like the first church was on the
[58:58] word
[59:02] spirit-filled word fed not denomination
[59:06] say it not that got to be a ministry
[59:09] just exactly like it was go ahead
[59:16] this is number 19. this day this
[59:19] scripture is fulfilled paragraph 48
[59:23] could not be could i could i not say
[59:26] this
[59:28] if i had just been on my toes see the
[59:30] brother prophesied when he said to me
[59:33] they did this day watch what he did
[59:35] right after
[59:37] the reading of that scripture in the
[59:39] days when the son of man
[59:41] not a man not a human being
[59:45] the son of man will reveal himself
[59:48] among his people again
[59:53] now if it's one man then you got him
[59:56] wrong here
[59:58] go ahead this day this promise
[1:00:01] of this hour that we're now living here
[1:00:03] is fulfilled
[1:00:04] before our very eyes go ahead
[1:00:08] one in a million 65
[1:00:12] paragraph 10.
[1:00:15] and he is supposed to according to the
[1:00:16] scriptures
[1:00:18] return to us in this last days in this
[1:00:21] type of ministry
[1:00:23] that will be after the baptism of the
[1:00:24] holy spirit and speaking in tongues
[1:00:27] and divine healing and so forth these
[1:00:30] things
[1:00:32] the capping of the pentecostal message
[1:00:35] is what we're speaking of today
[1:00:39] all right not capping tongues about
[1:00:44] talking about a message this ministry of
[1:00:47] the
[1:00:48] christ himself impersonated among his
[1:00:51] people
[1:00:52] with the very same things he did when he
[1:00:54] was here on earth
[1:00:57] in his body the bride
[1:01:01] which is part of him doing the same
[1:01:04] things
[1:01:04] as husband and wife are king and queen
[1:01:08] just before the marriage ceremony okay
[1:01:11] go ahead
[1:01:14] we got only a couple more
[1:01:18] three or four more spiritual food and
[1:01:20] due season paragraph 163 1965.
[1:01:25] that's the thing right there that's the
[1:01:27] ones secrets
[1:01:28] they organized and see and was
[1:01:30] completely out of the will of god
[1:01:32] and that will be exposed in the last
[1:01:34] days
[1:01:35] and lead to people not to a creed
[1:01:38] or a denomination but back to the true
[1:01:41] word
[1:01:42] and the true word will come to a certain
[1:01:45] group of people
[1:01:47] and the son of man will reveal himself
[1:01:50] in the midst of them the same yesterday
[1:01:53] today and forever
[1:01:56] all right look the next one the only
[1:01:58] ones the end time prayer of 165.
[1:02:01] it's the grain of wheat itself the son
[1:02:03] of man will be made manifest
[1:02:05] the grain of wheat will come back to
[1:02:07] itself again
[1:02:09] the son of man in the last days now how
[1:02:12] long do we spend on the grain of wheat
[1:02:13] and how much all right
[1:02:16] there will come false impersonations of
[1:02:19] it
[1:02:20] in the last days that'll almost deceive
[1:02:22] the elected if possible
[1:02:24] look at their organizational shucks
[1:02:26] pulling away
[1:02:28] now okay
[1:02:31] go ahead modern events made clear by
[1:02:34] prophecy
[1:02:36] paragraph 2 33 jesus when he come he was
[1:02:40] to be a prophet that's right
[1:02:41] and today before jesus comes again the
[1:02:44] full manifestation of the person of
[1:02:47] jesus christ
[1:02:48] is to be manifested in flesh
[1:02:51] now do you believe that yes
[1:02:55] no i don't see you
[1:03:02] bible said i believe to see
[1:03:06] it didn't say i see to believe
[1:03:10] i believe to see
[1:03:15] open your eyes the full manifestation of
[1:03:19] the person of jesus christ is to be
[1:03:20] manifested in flesh
[1:03:21] think of it jesus said as it was in the
[1:03:23] days of sodom so she'll be at the coming
[1:03:24] of the son of man
[1:03:25] when the son of man is being revealed
[1:03:27] what is revealed
[1:03:28] you know what is revealed unfolded made
[1:03:31] known
[1:03:32] the secret had been brought forth
[1:03:35] revealed
[1:03:37] in the day that the son of man will be
[1:03:40] revealed
[1:03:41] the world will be in a sodomite
[1:03:42] condition we've got
[1:03:44] it haven't we yeah and how many believes
[1:03:47] that
[1:03:48] it's in a sort of my condition and
[1:03:50] that's exactly right now look where
[1:03:52] it's sitting now going to the next one
[1:03:58] leadership 1965 program 142.
[1:04:01] now to refuse that person that's doing
[1:04:04] the calling
[1:04:05] christ no matter if you're pentecostal
[1:04:08] methodist lutheran whatever you
[1:04:10] are you got it this age
[1:04:15] nothing against them not at all
[1:04:19] but in this age now you've got to accept
[1:04:24] like they did in that age
[1:04:30] so each age accepted for their age
[1:04:34] right that's what was the trouble
[1:04:37] luther he accepted it and the people
[1:04:40] become it
[1:04:40] that's right all right
[1:04:44] now you've got to accept like they did
[1:04:46] in that age
[1:04:47] the person of christ which is the word
[1:04:50] now the last one
[1:04:52] so modern events made clear by prophecy
[1:04:54] paragraph 57
[1:04:56] this book is a book of prophecy it's
[1:04:59] believers are commanded to honor it and
[1:05:01] to read it
[1:05:02] and believe it's author for every word
[1:05:04] that's written in there must come
[1:05:06] to pass everything that's been promised
[1:05:08] has to come to piss
[1:05:10] because it is jesus christ
[1:05:14] in each age the same yesterday
[1:05:18] it was jesus was in noah it was jesus
[1:05:21] christ and moses
[1:05:22] it was jesus christ and david it was
[1:05:23] jesus christ and joseph jesus christ
[1:05:25] the same yesterday today and forever and
[1:05:28] it's jesus christ
[1:05:29] among his people today doing the things
[1:05:32] that he promised
[1:05:34] he would do in this age
[1:05:37] it's jesus christ but do you see it
[1:05:40] church
[1:05:47] the son of man is the bride made
[1:05:50] manifest
[1:05:53] the word for the age that we're living
[1:05:55] in
[1:05:58] this is not for everybody
[1:06:03] this is not for everybody now listen to
[1:06:05] my wording please
[1:06:07] it's not for everybody that claims to
[1:06:09] believe the message
[1:06:17] a lot of people read this message
[1:06:20] you turn on your radio and listen to
[1:06:21] some of these preachers and you can
[1:06:23] almost give the book they're reading out
[1:06:25] of it
[1:06:26] right you know
[1:06:32] all right they know about this message
[1:06:37] like i said this morning they pick on
[1:06:40] brother branham about dates and times
[1:06:42] and seasons
[1:06:43] but even they won't pick on the gift
[1:06:46] that was in his life
[1:06:50] they know they can't argue with that
[1:06:55] but listen church
[1:06:59] god has
[1:07:02] made himself known in each age
[1:07:06] and there's been a messenger for that
[1:07:08] age and a people to live that message
[1:07:12] and there's been a messenger in this age
[1:07:14] and the people to live the message
[1:07:17] not to just go to church and be good
[1:07:25] it's to go to church to learn
[1:07:30] to hear the truth and then some of you
[1:07:33] come to me and you'll say
[1:07:35] brother dale i've learned more here in a
[1:07:36] short time and i've learned
[1:07:40] that don't exalt me
[1:07:44] that makes me cry
[1:07:47] you know why because the places you come
[1:07:51] from
[1:07:53] and the opportunity to hear
[1:07:56] this message the way that i've taught it
[1:08:05] right but because of my stand to believe
[1:08:10] and lay on they can only attack
[1:08:13] quotes like a sister is telling me the
[1:08:16] other day that some
[1:08:17] people she talked to said brother dale
[1:08:19] believes in a seven year tribulation
[1:08:24] he never taught nothing that way
[1:08:28] i've taught what the prophet said that
[1:08:30] just seven years after the rapture
[1:08:32] they don't believe that
[1:08:35] organized religion taught seven years
[1:08:37] tribulation
[1:08:39] they think brother branham was teaching
[1:08:40] that because we saying seven years after
[1:08:42] the rapture
[1:08:45] but see he said there's no such thing he
[1:08:47] said it was three and a half years of
[1:08:48] jesus ministry back there and three and
[1:08:49] a half over here
[1:08:50] he said it's only three and a half years
[1:08:52] of tribulation that's over here
[1:08:55] and the bride don't go through the
[1:08:57] tribulation
[1:08:59] she goes in the rapture well why can't
[1:09:02] we believe that
[1:09:06] and say he's coming back after a bride
[1:09:09] a word-born bride
[1:09:12] well brother dale what do you mean word
[1:09:14] born
[1:09:17] people that are birthed by the word
[1:09:21] sisters ask me a question and i'm going
[1:09:23] to say it
[1:09:25] but she's asked me a question a good
[1:09:27] many times because of what she's doing
[1:09:30] he is taking the messages i preached
[1:09:34] in 1982 and
[1:09:37] topping them up and she's up to the
[1:09:40] fifth seal
[1:09:41] topping them up brother mark is paying
[1:09:44] for her
[1:09:45] to do that because he wanted it the way
[1:09:48] that i
[1:09:48] taught it all right and uh she's asked
[1:09:52] me some questions and sometimes they
[1:09:53] just put these
[1:09:56] and it's not because they don't
[1:09:57] understand what i say it
[1:09:59] it's because they don't understand what
[1:10:01] i said
[1:10:04] right so instead of trying to write it
[1:10:07] down and leave it alone
[1:10:09] dots you know i said that's okay just
[1:10:11] don't put all them snow in them skull
[1:10:13] bones and
[1:10:14] you know because it means a cuss word
[1:10:16] you know
[1:10:17] all right but she's mentioning it to me
[1:10:20] something i made years ago during that
[1:10:22] seal
[1:10:24] i said i believe that a man
[1:10:27] can have multiple wives
[1:10:32] and wait on the tape then said daddy
[1:10:33] watch it
[1:10:36] well she don't know how to write that
[1:10:37] down
[1:10:39] because she's afraid she writes it down
[1:10:41] the way i said it that everybody all
[1:10:43] thanking believing in all this
[1:10:46] he said why haven't you explained it to
[1:10:48] her
[1:10:51] if she's heard all them tapes and copied
[1:10:54] them off
[1:10:55] that's you here this day that's fine
[1:10:58] she already know what to talk
[1:11:02] i believe a man can have more than one
[1:11:04] wife not cut the tape off now and you
[1:11:06] got it
[1:11:07] you all messed up i believe a woman can
[1:11:10] have more than one husband
[1:11:13] only problem is he got to be dead
[1:11:18] right i mean if the husband's dead she
[1:11:21] can marry again
[1:11:23] if he dies she marry again
[1:11:29] he said well why didn't you explain that
[1:11:30] to her
[1:11:32] how are you going to explain anything
[1:11:36] man's wife dies and he marries again not
[1:11:39] american he's got more than one wife
[1:11:42] right
[1:11:46] come on so what's wrong with the
[1:11:49] statement
[1:11:50] i didn't say it was okay to have more
[1:11:52] than one y
[1:12:00] the only difference is i'll tell you
[1:12:01] what i believe i believe what the
[1:12:04] prophet says
[1:12:06] i believe a man can put in wife his wife
[1:12:08] for certain things and marry again
[1:12:12] well in god he may not have but one
[1:12:16] but in mankind he's got more than one
[1:12:18] right right
[1:12:19] multiple you don't have to put the x's
[1:12:23] in because you don't understand what i
[1:12:24] say
[1:12:28] but i know what the public will get now
[1:12:30] get that look he said it
[1:12:34] okay i stand behind what i say
[1:12:42] he said well why didn't you explain
[1:12:43] those things maybe it's not meant to be
[1:12:45] explained
[1:12:49] you know
[1:12:53] maybe some things are meant to believe
[1:12:58] and walk into them
[1:13:03] i mean come on i've been here with you
[1:13:04] all these years most a lot of you
[1:13:07] brother colley brother daugherty knew
[1:13:10] 1972 when they started
[1:13:12] 71 i guess the end of it
[1:13:15] and then you'd read the newspaper that
[1:13:17] samuel dale
[1:13:18] is caught with a woman in a motel
[1:13:27] it wasn't his wife
[1:13:32] you mean after all these years you're
[1:13:34] going to
[1:13:36] get on the telephone call everybody like
[1:13:38] that right here in the newspaper
[1:13:43] i know dog he's going to fall
[1:13:47] i just felt that i just had a feeling
[1:13:49] that one of these days
[1:13:50] he was gonna fall you know
[1:13:54] that's exactly what 98
[1:13:57] of the people would do
[1:14:02] but why can't you be like sister gayle
[1:14:03] one time when
[1:14:06] they told her certain things about me
[1:14:10] and she said samuel dale don't believe
[1:14:13] that
[1:14:16] she put herself on the line that i
[1:14:18] didn't believe it
[1:14:22] i appreciate the brother he and i had
[1:14:24] difference in doctrine but
[1:14:25] he heard some brothers talking about me
[1:14:27] one day
[1:14:29] and he walked up
[1:14:32] and he said i'll tell you right real
[1:14:33] quick samuel dale don't believe that
[1:14:38] i said thank you brother
[1:14:42] he had that much confidence that i
[1:14:45] didn't believe that
[1:14:53] listen church this is not about a man
[1:14:56] about a point it's about a people
[1:15:01] a people who can believe who they are
[1:15:07] and now quote brother dick there if they
[1:15:10] come up with a doctrine and prove that
[1:15:12] brother brown
[1:15:12] has been married 10 times or something
[1:15:15] how many of you could say thank god
[1:15:20] i heard the word
[1:15:26] no matter if the man was wrong i heard
[1:15:29] about jesus
[1:15:31] something that all you lily white two
[1:15:33] shoes
[1:15:37] so when i get around to it then you know
[1:15:41] i don't believe he was married 10 times
[1:15:44] right because my basis is in the word
[1:15:49] all right but you see why can't we put
[1:15:53] everything and leave right around him in
[1:15:54] a human element
[1:15:56] it can make flips of the tongue and
[1:15:58] different things that
[1:16:00] people can use against him
[1:16:04] and we just go right on down the road
[1:16:07] then he brought me to jesus
[1:16:10] he brought me to a revelation of god
[1:16:15] that no man was ever able to bring me to
[1:16:20] i used to question him in the baptist
[1:16:22] church about god in his doings
[1:16:26] i told you before a man said you need to
[1:16:27] go to a pentecostal church
[1:16:30] because i was questioning about god you
[1:16:33] know
[1:16:34] and i believe that god was real
[1:16:37] why can't we be that now church
[1:16:41] but just accept what he says we are
[1:16:46] and believe it
[1:16:49] but you know there's other side of it
[1:16:51] that a lot of people are waiting for
[1:16:53] some word
[1:16:55] from him to let them know where they are
[1:16:59] well the message
[1:17:02] and the prophet has already told us who
[1:17:06] we are and what we're doing
[1:17:08] you know but yet why would we have to
[1:17:11] wait
[1:17:12] until the prophet would tell us what we
[1:17:14] are
[1:17:18] why can't we believe jesus christ the
[1:17:21] same yesterday today and forever
[1:17:25] and thank god for the revealed word
[1:17:33] the church the first message i preached
[1:17:35] right here
[1:17:36] in this church in 1971 july 4th
[1:17:40] was going beyond man's camp
[1:17:44] that was the title of the message and i
[1:17:46] said then i said
[1:17:48] folks don't get upset at us because
[1:17:49] we're going home
[1:17:51] if you want to settle down and just
[1:17:54] cabbage down and
[1:17:56] sit down and wait that's fine
[1:17:59] but we're just wanting to move on with
[1:18:01] the lord amen
[1:18:04] why wouldn't we want that
[1:18:08] you know what i told you i went and
[1:18:11] preached for a man one time and
[1:18:13] i preached justification same case and
[1:18:14] baptism and holy ghost
[1:18:16] and he got upset at me and i said why
[1:18:21] he said you taught them just because the
[1:18:23] same thing imagine the holy ghost that
[1:18:24] you needed to seek god
[1:18:26] i said yes sir he said i had them built
[1:18:29] on the word
[1:18:31] and you got them to seek in god i said i
[1:18:33] apologize
[1:18:34] for preaching something in your church
[1:18:36] that you don't agree with but i'll never
[1:18:38] apologize for trying to get your church
[1:18:40] or anybody
[1:18:41] from seeking god i will not apologize
[1:18:45] for that
[1:18:46] because how can you be anything if
[1:18:48] you're not seeking god
[1:18:51] how can you get anything from god if
[1:18:53] you're not seeking him
[1:18:56] the bible says seek want to seek god
[1:19:00] how or while he shall be found or
[1:19:02] something to that degree
[1:19:04] no stand come on brother
[1:19:07] but i believe the bride of jesus christ
[1:19:09] will be the word made manifest
[1:19:13] and she will finish the things that was
[1:19:16] left
[1:19:18] and she will be that word made flesh and
[1:19:22] that word might flesh will be
[1:19:24] the son of man deity veiled in human
[1:19:28] flesh
[1:19:33] i don't make this nothing
[1:19:36] that makes a great god
[1:19:39] that we serve one who has tried to get
[1:19:43] us to see
[1:19:46] what else could you and i want
[1:19:50] to believe god's word
[1:19:53] we've got the messages and witness among
[1:19:55] us witnesses among us
[1:19:57] that seen the prophet in the preaching
[1:20:00] and seen the dead raised in the sick
[1:20:02] healed
[1:20:04] seen thus saith the lord and seen it
[1:20:06] made manifest
[1:20:10] witnesses still living
[1:20:14] i honor that i tell everybody
[1:20:18] i got people in my church that was dire
[1:20:21] when the prophet
[1:20:23] these things took place i'm glad of that
[1:20:29] see personal witness is it we can get
[1:20:32] them in the pulpit let them testify
[1:20:34] about what they saw
[1:20:38] god in human flesh
[1:20:43] manifesting himself through a man
[1:20:48] that would say thus saith the lord and
[1:20:51] god would honor it
[1:20:53] but yet he was pointing all that time to
[1:20:56] try to get the church to believe who
[1:20:58] they are
[1:21:00] the word made flesh the son of man
[1:21:04] what do we got brother 152
[1:21:07] 152. anybody has a name
[1:21:26] holy
[1:21:35] praise the lord
[1:21:43] praise the lord
[1:22:05] anybody have a name
[1:22:22] right
[1:22:35] feeding on the word
[1:22:50] today like to a man no i believe god
[1:22:53] true the man is going to speak to us
[1:22:55] yeah man god
[1:23:00] will use someone to
[1:23:05] and speak close but that's not deity
[1:23:23] i'll be right here
[1:23:46] is
[1:23:59] i'll be right here
[1:24:11] i'll be right here
[1:24:16] sitting in the word
[1:24:20] listening to him declare what he has
[1:24:24] made me
[1:24:28] what he's made me
[1:24:33] then no matter what goes i can't pay
[1:24:37] y'all
[1:24:39] right i can't fail
[1:24:43] but i'm dependent on him
