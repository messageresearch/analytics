[0:01] you were late I almost took over maybe
[0:03] that'll be helped right there Joe just
[0:07] about um it's exactly now 10:00 and that
[0:11] CL we're
[0:13] okay Revelation
[0:19] 5 good morning
[0:28] everyone
[0:30] Revelation
[0:45] 5 all
[0:47] right Revelation chap
[0:50] 5 and I saw in the right hand of him
[0:52] that sat on the throne a book written
[0:54] within and on the backside sealed with
[0:55] Seven Seals I saw a strong Angel
[0:58] Proclaim with a loud voice who is worthy
[1:00] to open the book and to loose the seals
[1:02] thereof no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[1:05] neither under the Earth was able to open
[1:07] the book neither to look their
[1:10] own and as we said Wednesday night
[1:13] there's John a born again believer for
[1:16] 60 years he's crying because something
[1:19] has not taken
[1:21] place and I wept much because no man was
[1:24] found worthy to open and read the book
[1:26] Nei to
[1:28] look there on
[1:30] now I want to ask you a
[1:35] question at this point of the
[1:38] scene where John is like we're talking
[1:40] about Wednesday
[1:41] night and I'm going to kind of back up a
[1:44] little bit and maybe redo Wednesday a
[1:45] little bit but not
[1:48] much but you see where John says I saw I
[1:52] saw I saw
[1:54] I John is in a place to where he's
[1:57] watching a scene he's he's let's bring
[2:00] it up to
[2:01] 2011 he's sitting and watching
[2:05] television or a movie screen because
[2:08] that's what it is there was a projection
[2:11] in the mind the mind of God is being
[2:14] projected out and here's John looking at
[2:17] a
[2:19] scene in chapter four he saw the scene
[2:21] chapter 5 he sees a
[2:23] scene chapter 5 he sees a scene that he
[2:26] don't really understand to a degree all
[2:28] right because remember was born
[2:31] again excuse me for 60
[2:34] years but yet there was a part that he
[2:36] couldn't
[2:38] understand and to just back up and just
[2:41] stop for one moment and realize that
[2:44] that's what man's always looked for you
[2:46] remember the quote I gave Wednesday
[2:48] about where brother R said
[2:50] job job could see the
[2:53] flowers they go they grow they' die they
[2:56] come right back up he said but I see man
[2:58] go down and I don't see man come back up
[3:01] right but then when eloh the last one
[3:05] came to job which was the type of Christ
[3:09] cuz he start speaking in the first
[3:10] person telling job things he said job he
[3:14] said in other words this is going to
[3:16] happen that's going to happen this is
[3:17] what's being done in the safe time we
[3:19] won't read it but he has come to a place
[3:23] to where
[3:24] job was looking at no
[3:27] hope job knew knew that he remember job
[3:31] lost
[3:32] everything he thought God you know he
[3:34] thought he had done something wrong
[3:36] thought God had turned his back on him
[3:38] he said oh I wish that I could in other
[3:40] words if I could get to
[3:42] God you
[3:44] know but now remember let's tie all this
[3:47] together you take the Rich Young Ruler
[3:50] that went to
[3:52] hell and what did he tell he said go
[3:55] tell my brethren not to come to this
[3:57] place but he said I see Abraham I mean I
[4:00] see the the the beggar remember that
[4:02] died he said I see the beggar in the
[4:04] bosom of Abraham what did he
[4:07] say he said oh that I may go there and
[4:10] the angel tells you know in the story
[4:12] The Angel tells tells the Rich Young
[4:14] Ruler said you can't go there there's a
[4:17] great golf
[4:19] fixed a golf fixed which was fixed back
[4:23] in the Garden of Eden when Adam did what
[4:24] he did and Eve all right that was a
[4:26] great Gulf in other words once you're on
[4:28] this side you can't get
[4:30] across but when you're alive you can you
[4:33] can you know accept Christ and get
[4:34] across this is the point I'm making but
[4:37] all that was the point I'm trying to
[4:38] tell you all down through time man has
[4:40] wanted to be to where they can converse
[4:43] with God cuz Adam and Eve remember Adam
[4:46] and Eve conversed with God face to face
[4:48] didn't have to go through a prophet
[4:50] didn't have to go through a preacher
[4:53] they went they went straight to God and
[4:56] that's what Adam and Eve enjoyed and I
[4:59] believe that's what killed Adam more
[5:01] than anything not physically but you
[5:02] know I mean in his Spirit it killed Adam
[5:04] to not be able to talk to that same God
[5:06] again all right so man has since Adam
[5:11] begun trying to get back even in the
[5:13] Book of Psalms David says in Psalms 10
[5:16] and something I I just thought I'd stop
[5:19] here for a second and go through this he
[5:22] says Heaven and Earth has
[5:24] kissed you
[5:26] know Heaven and Earth has come together
[5:29] David was prophesying he was seeing
[5:30] something that was coming but man is
[5:33] always job is always said old that a man
[5:34] could take my hand and take God's hand
[5:36] or that I could go up to the door and
[5:37] knock on the door and say God I want to
[5:39] talk to you face to
[5:40] face well you know what you take the old
[5:44] uh story that brother randam gave of the
[5:48] boy eating the rubber off the bicycle
[5:50] tire or the bicycle Pebble he needed
[5:55] sulfur the Deep was calling to the deep
[5:58] but there had to be a deep there there
[5:59] there had to be a sulfur if you're if
[6:01] you're craving like we were talking
[6:02] about if you were craving water Lisa
[6:05] said she drank a lot of water at night
[6:07] cuz she crave water well if there was no
[6:08] water or no such thing as water she'd
[6:10] never have that crav okay she'd never
[6:13] have that but there was water there so
[6:16] what am I
[6:17] saying there's a way to get back to
[6:20] God it was all down through the Old
[6:22] Testament and even in the New Testament
[6:25] there was a way to get back to God but
[6:27] it hadn't come yet it was in in Jesus
[6:31] Christ because God and man had to become
[6:34] one in
[6:35] flesh right so that's what like was
[6:37] talking about in the Bible Study last
[6:38] night it has to be the son of man to
[6:41] take that book spirit of God can't die
[6:44] God right here this this Son of God the
[6:47] spirit one we talk always talked about
[6:49] back in the Old
[6:51] Testament that that one sitting on the
[6:53] throne with that book in his hand he
[6:55] can't
[6:56] die he's almighty God Amen
[7:00] but the one that came out of the throne
[7:01] around from the throne in other words
[7:03] another Act of the plague John is
[7:05] sitting there watching and he's watching
[7:06] the story go across here comes one that
[7:09] appears but it's
[7:10] not somebody
[7:15] different it's the same person but in
[7:18] different dispensation or different
[7:21] action all right different
[7:22] characteristics he's he's given more of
[7:25] hisself he's unfolding more of himself
[7:28] that's why in Revelation 5 like I told
[7:30] you in here is the change of the body
[7:32] right there in Revelations 5 when that
[7:34] lamb took that book what was the
[7:38] book got to go back we got to see that
[7:41] there in the book there's two sections
[7:44] several sections really but only one
[7:46] let's talk about right
[7:48] now you got a section in there that your
[7:50] name was written in when you were born
[7:51] the prophet explains this your name was
[7:53] written in there when you were born as a
[7:55] human being on the face of the Earth
[7:56] everybody has
[7:58] that then there's a day when your name
[8:00] was transferred out of that just book of
[8:02] the living into the Lamb's Book of Life
[8:05] when you accept it now it's not somebody
[8:06] up there we don't there's not
[8:07] secretaries recording it right remember
[8:10] always in God it's already finished you
[8:13] and I are the ones that's got to see it
[8:15] right you and I are the ones that's got
[8:16] to see this this
[8:18] scene God's the one creating the scene
[8:21] okay the author of the book does not
[8:23] have to per se read the book to
[8:26] understand it why he wrote it that's
[8:28] right he did it he's the one that done
[8:31] all the work okay so here we
[8:35] got this
[8:37] book now remember one thing
[8:42] Adam was going to the
[8:47] ability to his flesh being
[8:50] changed to be Eternal that's what the
[8:52] prophet said his youth was being renewed
[8:55] but somewhere down the line his body
[8:57] would have become Eternal right that's
[8:59] why he he had to go through a
[9:03] chain I mean he wasn't he wasn't Body
[9:07] Spirit and
[9:08] soul
[9:09] Eternal he was Spirit Eternal I mean
[9:12] Soul Eternal everybody understand that
[9:15] cuz into Adam when he breathed eternal
[9:17] life into he breathed the breath of life
[9:18] into Adam that was directly eternal life
[9:20] imparted to a human being okay to make
[9:24] him Eternal in his soul same way at the
[9:26] new birth with you and I but our bodies
[9:28] were still getting older right same way
[9:32] with this
[9:33] book the book that the man sitting on
[9:36] the throne was holding on to was the
[9:39] book of the names of the people that
[9:41] were going to be
[9:44] changed does everybody understand that
[9:47] yes cuz if you're not a Christian your
[9:50] body's not going to be changed you're
[9:52] just one day you're just going to go
[9:53] away that's
[9:56] right I'm talking about you're just
[9:58] going to go out of
[10:00] existence never to be remembered again
[10:03] does everybody understand that that's
[10:04] how Revelations 5 to me is really the
[10:06] whole
[10:08] Bible because what what Adam took away
[10:11] from I mean what God took away from
[10:13] Adam was not the ability to be Eternal
[10:16] in his soul he took the book from Adam
[10:20] to say Adam you can't produce these
[10:22] names in
[10:23] flesh and they be
[10:26] changed and I'm holding up this because
[10:29] the last day right this one that was the
[10:32] last day okay
[10:35] right so the book that the man was
[10:38] holding on the
[10:41] throne was not necessarily John's
[10:43] eternal life he already had
[10:47] it all the souls that were there that
[10:50] were there were eternal life in their
[10:52] soul they were newborn creatures newborn
[10:54] like we were talking about last night
[10:55] you can't take that away so there's a
[10:58] part of that in in here just like the
[11:00] transfer of the name now God didn't
[11:02] transfer in race your name out and put
[11:03] it over here no it was when you realized
[11:06] that your name was always written on
[11:08] there it was just revealed right see it
[11:12] was just revealed this Bible was written
[11:14] before the foundation of the world but
[11:15] um it wasn't this little book right okay
[11:18] so what what God took back from Adam was
[11:22] not a book right he grab a big book you
[11:25] know and they get in a struggle he no
[11:27] that's mine no it was the
[11:30] ability for Adam to make this book come
[11:33] alive that's right in
[11:37] flesh not not in Soul because Adam was
[11:40] already Adam didn't lose eternal life in
[11:42] his
[11:43] soul he lost the eternal life the
[11:45] ability to become Eternal in this man
[11:48] right here
[11:49] right because his youth was being
[11:51] renewed he was eating perfect food he
[11:53] probably could have lived millions and
[11:54] millions of years but somewhere God's
[11:56] going to have to change that body cuz he
[11:58] brought it out of the earth okay Jesus
[12:01] body was the same
[12:03] way come out of the earth and you know
[12:05] it was made by God but it came out of
[12:08] the
[12:08] earth and even that didn't stop the
[12:12] corruption in this guy right here he
[12:15] still began to get
[12:17] older okay so what was what was John
[12:22] John's abor again Christian for 60 years
[12:24] he sees a man sitting on the throne with
[12:25] a book in his
[12:27] hand the Lord Jesus that
[12:31] b now John knew is born
[12:34] again okay but something about this
[12:39] book had to be
[12:41] transferred cuz if it stayed in the
[12:43] hands of the original owner which was
[12:45] God nobody was going to live forever
[12:48] that's
[12:50] right but the law of kinsman says
[12:53] somebody's got to be kin to you to get
[12:56] it back through man it fell through man
[13:00] has got to come
[13:02] back you say well it's just simple
[13:05] Redemption I wish you Redemption is not
[13:07] simple but yet it's the simplest thing
[13:10] you ever think about in your life how
[13:13] how the almighty
[13:17] God the Man Standing on the throne
[13:20] sitting on the throne
[13:22] declared just like Moses if Moses hadn't
[13:25] gotten a breach with them people what
[13:26] would have happened God said in the Ten
[13:29] Commandments Thou shalt not this this
[13:31] this and this and this without Moses
[13:34] standing in the breach for those people
[13:36] they
[13:38] died Moses portrayed Christ without
[13:41] Jesus Christ standing in the middle
[13:42] between me and and God I die because
[13:46] judgment this is
[13:48] Judgment if you're not written in here
[13:50] what is it it's judgment all right so
[13:54] the man sitting on the throne with a
[13:55] book John sees the man with a
[13:57] book it's closed it's got seals wrapped
[14:00] around it
[14:02] m so he knows one thing for sure
[14:05] nobody's ever read it like they were
[14:08] supposed
[14:09] to now look we always say it's the Bible
[14:12] but it's not a physical Bible that's
[14:13] what we're trying to get into last night
[14:15] there was a question we got to start
[14:17] stop looking at physical happenings like
[14:20] sister Gwen said a throne throne is your
[14:22] heart that's where God is he was already
[14:25] sitting on a
[14:27] throne
[14:29] he was already see he wasn't standing up
[14:32] he was sitting on the throne of your
[14:33] heart you were already born again so he
[14:36] saw that man sitting on the throne he
[14:38] always he said okay I'm born again that
[14:41] man is right here in my heart but this
[14:44] book's got some seals on
[14:47] it and no man was even worthy to even
[14:50] look at the
[14:53] book man the people that were
[14:56] there but then let me make more one more
[15:03] thing give back one more
[15:06] thing when the lamb took the
[15:12] book he opened
[15:15] it he had to cuz Revelations 10 you see
[15:18] it
[15:19] open but just him taking the book May
[15:22] John shout we'll read in just a minute
[15:25] just taking the
[15:27] book because John knew then there was an
[15:29] ability now but see there was no ability
[15:31] for them to be born again I mean to I'm
[15:33] sorry to be Eternal in their soul I'm
[15:36] about 20 minutes ahead of myself let me
[15:38] back up there was no way for John to
[15:40] stand there and know that he was
[15:41] standing in the right place to take a
[15:44] change because he he knew he was looking
[15:47] at a scene that was coming that was not
[15:50] you know that was not there for him
[15:52] right because he didn't ever open this
[15:55] book he never got the open book
[15:58] everybody understand that he didn't get
[16:00] the open book there only one people that
[16:02] gets an open book and that's you and I
[16:04] right okay so he he knew but still
[16:06] enough of that he knew then that once
[16:10] that man that come around and once he
[16:12] took possession of that
[16:15] book he knew it was in a man's
[16:18] hand a man that was
[16:21] worthy a flesh man the one we talked
[16:24] about remember Son of God and son of man
[16:26] right that son of man was Worthy now
[16:29] John saw somebody in human flesh that
[16:33] was
[16:35] worthy and John knew that that was the
[16:38] same Jesus he walked with and he
[16:40] remembered in his mind the Holy Ghost
[16:42] brought back what the word to his
[16:46] remembrance remember he said he said
[16:48] whatsoever things I say to you in other
[16:49] words I'll send the Holy Ghost and when
[16:51] he comes that he'll bring to you
[16:52] remembrance all the things I've said so
[16:54] here's John looking at
[16:57] Jesus heard all all the things he said
[16:59] I'm going to be the comforter I'm going
[17:00] to come back I'm going to do this saw
[17:03] Jesus in a glorified
[17:06] condition and
[17:08] knew he was okay then he knew the whole
[17:12] human race was all right just because of
[17:14] that one man right that one man not just
[17:17] Jesus Christ that's going to give like
[17:19] the denominations you know oh I believe
[17:20] in Jesus and he's he's going to save me
[17:23] and you know I I'm I'm going to get I'm
[17:25] this this is not good enough so I'm no
[17:28] when he resurrected he resurrected in a
[17:30] flesh
[17:31] body he ate
[17:34] food but he was
[17:36] glorified John saw glorified Jesus
[17:39] standing
[17:40] there on
[17:43] Earth didn't didn't know it doesn't say
[17:46] that but if he saw Jesus standing on
[17:48] Earth glorified he knew one thing for
[17:51] sure if he was almighty God he wasn't
[17:53] any different than what he
[17:54] saw so you understand what I'm saying he
[17:57] didn't lose position
[18:00] okay cuz John saw him on Earth and John
[18:03] as a young boy saw Jesus standing there
[18:05] glorified walk right through a
[18:07] wall Ascend straight up and just
[18:10] disappear out of their sight but when he
[18:12] saw that same man walk around behind
[18:14] that throne and grab the book and come
[18:16] up and sit down on the throne that's why
[18:18] John began to scream and shout right he
[18:22] seen the glorify Jesus on Earth so that
[18:24] man wasn't any less so now we got a
[18:27] chance
[18:29] go now we got what God and man has come
[18:33] together and through the baptism of the
[18:35] Holy Ghost John was joined
[18:37] together but this book was not all
[18:41] complete it was still shut till Jesus
[18:43] took it when he sat down on the throne
[18:46] somewhere he opened
[18:47] it Revelations 10 somewhere that book
[18:50] got opened when in the end
[18:52] time now not to say that it was totally
[18:55] sealed up because remember through this
[18:57] you get your New Birth through the word
[19:00] of God that's right right that's where
[19:02] you get your new birth a man with the
[19:03] Holy Ghost has to teach you the word and
[19:06] then you accept that
[19:09] right find me in the book of Acts any
[19:12] any any time the Bible says and as the
[19:15] word was being spoken the Holy Ghost
[19:16] fell on the people after the preaching
[19:19] of the word at day of Pentecost what if
[19:21] Peter just walked out and said bless God
[19:22] we're all Eternal that wouldn't work he
[19:26] said men and Brethren let me tell you
[19:28] about this man y'all
[19:29] killed that he is Jesus Christ and he's
[19:32] the one that come to die for your sins
[19:34] in other words that's what the whole the
[19:36] whole sermon was about right right now
[19:39] he didn't jump in there and start
[19:40] talking about he's going to change your
[19:42] body and he's no that's all they can
[19:44] understand that's right right all down
[19:46] Through the Ages even the great ages
[19:48] that's all they could understand was
[19:50] that one day right one day that's right
[19:54] God's going to come and I really don't
[19:56] understand but one day we're going to
[19:57] heaven right
[19:59] I was telling somebody last
[20:02] night most people in the message and all
[20:05] the people in denominations think that
[20:07] just because Jesus came to die that
[20:10] there's a place on the calendar written
[20:13] right here that says going to
[20:18] heaven that's not
[20:20] true that's not
[20:23] true he didn't just pick a day that he's
[20:26] going to heaven just because we do this
[20:29] just because Jesus came everybody thinks
[20:30] they're going to
[20:32] heaven that's not
[20:34] true there's a specific day specific
[20:37] time specific season that all these
[20:40] things had to come about and John
[20:41] standing in the first church age he has
[20:44] a a true revelation of one God if if not
[20:47] he wouldn't have
[20:49] shouted his trinitarian idea when he saw
[20:51] them two people standing there would
[20:53] have said okay there's two where's the
[20:55] Holy Ghost you know in other words I got
[20:57] the Holy Ghost here and there's Jesus
[20:58] and there's God that's the way that
[21:01] trinitarian ideas would have seen
[21:05] it but John being full of the word that
[21:07] Jesus preached he knew that that man was
[21:09] almighty God he just couldn't get it all
[21:11] together that scene brought it together
[21:13] for him cuz remember like I said
[21:15] Wednesday night he started out with I
[21:17] saw I see and boy at the end it was a us
[21:22] we and they what John had become one
[21:25] with a vision cuz he taed the bride
[21:27] right he become one with it and there
[21:29] was no Gap anymore that's right and if
[21:32] he would have had a present day
[21:35] Revelation he would have took a
[21:37] Rapture because present day Revelation
[21:40] was that God and man was truly one the
[21:43] son of man was back in power not sitting
[21:45] on that throne but sitting on this
[21:46] Throne the son of man sitting on the
[21:48] throne not the Son of God the son of man
[21:50] sitting on the
[21:51] throne everybody understand
[21:54] that all right because what happen right
[21:58] here watch verse eight let's skip on
[22:00] verse eight cuz we know what happened
[22:02] through all the other part cuz see he's
[22:05] are rooting off Spring of David verse 5
[22:07] has prevailed to open the book and loose
[22:09] the Seven Seals thereof John saw that
[22:11] man probably saw in the scene he saw the
[22:15] book with those Seven Seals wrapped on
[22:17] it and he saw you know the bloody lamb
[22:20] take the book and then climb up the
[22:21] throne and here he starts doing this he
[22:24] starts tearing those seals
[22:26] off and then he flops that book open
[22:29] when he flops that book open that's when
[22:32] the shouting began cuz John knew that
[22:35] there was nothing closed anymore there
[22:37] was nothing left there was no mystery
[22:39] that's why brother Brandon reads
[22:40] Revelation 5 then he goes over and
[22:42] immediately reads Revelations 107 he
[22:45] said now this book is open he said but
[22:47] in the days of the voice of the seventh
[22:49] angel when he begins to sound the
[22:51] mystery one mystery shall be finished so
[22:55] John
[22:56] knew that's why I believe like like
[22:58] Daddy preaches it and I can see it
[23:00] myself that Revelations 10 go to
[23:03] Revelations 10 just a second Revelations
[23:05] 10 is in three
[23:08] parts I've got it kind of underlined and
[23:11] sectioned out in my Bible and see if
[23:12] this is not true excuse me Revelation 10
[23:17] 1-6 shows another scene is that correct
[23:21] Jose the seene a mighty angel coming
[23:23] down clothed with Cloud Revelations 1
[23:29] um Revelations 5 4 all those are showing
[23:33] the same
[23:35] man and had in his hand a little book
[23:37] open so John seeing this scene look at
[23:40] verse
[23:41] 7even that's not a
[23:45] scene see verse
[23:48] 1-6 I've got it marked in my Bible scene
[23:52] one
[23:54] see second scene 10:7 that's not a scene
[23:59] he's not seeing
[24:01] anything he's telling you how this is
[24:05] all going to
[24:06] happen cuz remember John's been through
[24:08] all the church ages watching watching
[24:11] Revelations 5 54 all the way down to six
[24:14] 7 8 n now he's in
[24:17] 10 but in the days of the voice of the
[24:20] seventh
[24:23] angel now seventh angel I don't believe
[24:27] was standing there I believe in John's
[24:29] in John's Revelation or in his the
[24:31] quickening of the holy spirit in his
[24:33] life he knew that that could only happen
[24:35] in the end time when all the Mysteries
[24:37] will be wrapped up cuz he saw the book
[24:39] closed there first then he you know he
[24:41] saw the church AG saw the book that was
[24:43] closed then he sees 6 7 and 8 when the
[24:45] seals were
[24:47] open sees a Prophet come on the scene
[24:50] somewhere in all
[24:51] that see verse one is the scene verse
[24:54] two is is John telling you what's going
[24:56] to happen
[24:58] but in the days of the voice of the
[24:59] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[25:01] sound the mystery of God should be
[25:03] finished as Heath declared to his
[25:04] servants the prophets John takes it all
[25:08] the way back even to Revelations
[25:12] 3:14 the beginning of the creation of
[25:16] God
[25:18] right then I got another line and then
[25:21] number
[25:23] three takes him right back to the same
[25:25] scene in in section in one
[25:28] everybody see that watch this Mighty
[25:31] Angel come down all right I'm going to
[25:32] paraphrase follow with me fast Mighty
[25:35] Angel comes down swears by him that
[25:37] liveth forever and ever
[25:41] stop John makes a commentary but in the
[25:44] days of the voice of the seventh angel
[25:45] when he shall begin to sound all these
[25:46] Mysteries are going to be finished
[25:48] stop verse eight and the voice which I
[25:51] heard from Heaven spake unto me again
[25:53] and said go take a little book now John
[25:54] picks back up the vision again okay
[25:58] you got that brother Jo you understand
[25:59] it now okay good I saw a few lights
[26:01] going on some were down some are still a
[26:05] little
[26:06] down if you don't understand it raise
[26:08] your hand don't be don't be shy if you
[26:09] really don't understand I'll go over it
[26:11] again but see right watch
[26:15] this verse 1 through 7 or
[26:19] six aing does everybody see that yes
[26:23] there's a scene John is looking at
[26:25] something M and he's writing the comment
[26:28] until he gets to number
[26:30] six or five there four and five and he
[26:34] and God says what hold it right don't
[26:37] write
[26:38] that John's a little bit
[26:40] worried cuz John heard from the angel he
[26:44] should write everything you
[26:47] see right and what he said he should
[26:50] write everything you see John sees a
[26:53] scene of the seven
[26:54] Thunder he's in that but he says don't
[26:59] write
[27:01] it John as a born again Christian just
[27:04] like you and I
[27:09] would watch
[27:12] it verse one through six is 1 2 3 4 five
[27:19] six
[27:21] stop what was Brother D explaining b day
[27:24] last night for those you that were here
[27:26] there's always a
[27:28] pause or a stop between number six and
[27:31] number seven for you to think about
[27:33] something something's coming God's
[27:35] fixing to bring something so God did the
[27:38] same thing with John in verse 1 through6
[27:41] he brought a scene down and right there
[27:43] at four and five John gets in a
[27:46] little he get something thrown a little
[27:48] curve thrown at him don't write this
[27:51] don't write this this is the most
[27:53] important thing ever going to happen on
[27:55] the face of the Earth don't write it
[27:57] when he gets to number seven number six
[28:00] I mean he
[28:01] stops and I believe John he's sitting
[28:03] there and he's writing all that
[28:05] down and he said no John don't write
[28:09] that
[28:11] okay well how's this going to get to the
[28:14] people cuz I'm writing this for a future
[28:16] age I'm John now I'm writing this for a
[28:18] future age Angel what is going on what
[28:20] why can't I write this
[28:23] down Holy Spirit strikes John he says oh
[28:27] but in the days of the voice of the
[28:28] Sabbath Angel when he begins to sound
[28:30] these seven things I can't write are
[28:33] going to be made known
[28:35] right
[28:37] okay you got a breach
[28:41] right which was the what a breaking
[28:43] forth a breach of something then verse
[28:46] seven does what
[28:50] explains how that scene's going to
[28:52] unfold with nothing written
[28:55] down you can't write a revelation
[28:57] exactly
[29:00] right then go back to verse eight and he
[29:06] puts it right back
[29:08] together everybody see that now he puts
[29:10] it right back together verse eight is
[29:13] the
[29:14] bride and
[29:19] Christ together John one man John typed
[29:23] the entire
[29:25] bride no one was able to eat the book
[29:30] until after John went through
[29:33] 1-6 and he had to stop in verse seven
[29:36] and ver between verse 6 and 7 and he had
[29:38] to think for a
[29:40] minute what's going to bring all this to
[29:42] pass oh that great angel in number in
[29:45] church age number seven that said he was
[29:48] the beginning of the creation of God now
[29:49] not brother brandom but Christ coming
[29:51] back to
[29:52] be the son of man on Earth again cuz
[29:55] you're going to set on my throne
[29:58] we're going to sit on Jesus's throne in
[30:01] the throne just as he sat with the
[30:03] father in his
[30:04] throne what does that mean what did he
[30:06] pray in John 17 that we may all be one
[30:11] one to me that's the Lord's Prayer John
[30:14] 17 the one saying Our Father which
[30:16] aren't in heaven and all that that's
[30:17] good but boy in John 17 he actually put
[30:20] a prayer out to the to the Bride of
[30:22] Jesus
[30:24] Christ now John picks up he said okay he
[30:28] go he reverts all the way back he said
[30:29] all right in the days of the voice of
[30:30] the seventh angel all this is going to
[30:32] happen okay I'm satisfied now let's go
[30:34] into
[30:36] eternity what's an eight Eight's
[30:39] eternity let's go into an
[30:41] eight and the voice which I heard from
[30:44] Heaven spake unto me again and said go
[30:46] take the little book which is open in
[30:48] the hand of the angel now who was
[30:50] that who was the angel that had the book
[30:53] in his hand
[30:55] Christ he picked right back up with
[30:57] Christ in the first the mighty Angel
[30:59] remember brother R said Christ is only
[31:01] could be that's right all right and
[31:03] we're going to read that next Sunday
[31:04] we're going to read out of the uh out of
[31:06] the book what we just studied today I
[31:08] think that's what we're going to
[31:11] do huh oh that's right next Sunday we
[31:14] may be at brother Al's church we I'll
[31:16] let somebody know probably a day before
[31:18] maybe a couple hours I don't know um
[31:21] I'll call you Sunday morning somebody
[31:23] Terence what Terrence ter Terence
[31:28] that's a good idea ter Sunday morning
[31:31] okay and let's finish this and the voice
[31:34] which I heard from Heaven spake unto me
[31:36] again and said go take a little book so
[31:39] it's not a great big Revelation it's a
[31:41] little book fear not L on
[31:46] flock cuz that book that book right
[31:49] there is a specific
[31:51] book that's the book of the names of the
[31:56] Eternal
[31:57] that's Christ made manifest in flesh cuz
[32:01] when John takes that book now look at
[32:04] John
[32:06] John sees that
[32:10] book went
[32:12] from no way I can make it till somebody
[32:16] takes that book and not only keeps
[32:21] it nope that's not what he come
[32:24] for he come to give it back out right MH
[32:28] John saw that same book it didn't book
[32:30] didn't change it just changed
[32:34] ownership because remember you and I are
[32:37] the rulers of the earth God told us that
[32:40] not that's not something that we make
[32:41] ourselves
[32:43] right God always wanted go back to 10
[32:47] years
[32:48] ago my statement isn't always will be
[32:51] God always wanted to one dwell in human
[32:54] flesh two have me and you dwell in human
[32:57] flesh and always be where he could get
[32:59] to us on this
[33:01] Earth You Know in other words conversion
[33:03] with us that's his whole plan you put
[33:06] all that all these thousands and
[33:08] millions of people and years and times
[33:10] and and and and U messages and doctrines
[33:13] and all that but you can sum it up in
[33:15] one just that one two three God always
[33:17] wanted to be in human flesh and what
[33:19] what God always wanted he's going to
[33:20] have that's right he always wanted me
[33:23] and you to dwell in human flesh Eternal
[33:26] and live on an ET Earth you know why cuz
[33:29] that's what we're going to and God can't
[33:31] change his mind about his word but see
[33:32] John here in Revelations 108 go take the
[33:35] little book which is open in the hand of
[33:38] the Angel which standeth upon the sea
[33:40] and upon the Earth who was that
[33:42] Christ and I went unto the
[33:46] angel the Bible says come boldly to the
[33:49] throne of
[33:51] grace and I went to the angel and said
[33:53] unto him give me the little
[33:55] book
[33:58] now
[33:59] possession we know on the earth is 99%
[34:02] of the
[34:06] law and he said who Christ he is still
[34:10] that Mighty Angel he Christ said take it
[34:13] and eat it
[34:15] up and it shall make thy belly bitter
[34:18] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[34:19] honey and I took that little book out of
[34:22] the Angel's hand and ate it up he didn't
[34:25] leave a page out for what baptism and
[34:28] leave a page out for no eternal hell you
[34:31] understand what I'm saying the the
[34:33] doctrines that people have or or two
[34:35] souls or seven Thunders let's make it
[34:37] now he didn't leave them Pages out of
[34:38] the book he ate it all
[34:40] up now John should have known then and
[34:44] he did by a by a little bit of a
[34:47] revelation because you never see that
[34:49] book
[34:50] again you never see this book until
[34:53] Revelation
[34:55] 20
[34:57] at the white Throne
[34:59] judgment it never talks about a book
[35:02] from that scripture from Revelations 10
[35:04] all the way through remember 19 we come
[35:07] riding back what from the Millennium and
[35:10] you know riding back with him in the
[35:11] Millennium then we go through a
[35:12] millennium and then you see in
[35:14] Revelation 20 or 21 you see a what a
[35:18] book that's the book of
[35:20] life cuz the book has been
[35:25] consumed how will Sayan be destroyed by
[35:27] the
[35:29] brightness of this coming not his and
[35:32] and the Bible says his coming but who is
[35:34] he she is he that's this right here and
[35:37] I took the little book out of the
[35:38] Angel's hand and ate it up and it was in
[35:40] my mouth sweet as honey as soon as I eat
[35:42] it my belly was bitter and he said unto
[35:44] me thou must prophesy again before many
[35:47] people and Nations and tongues and
[35:51] Kings Revelations 1-6 you have a scene
[35:54] of Christ coming down to reveal
[35:56] something that has never been revealed
[35:57] on the face of the Earth and then God
[35:59] says hold it John don't WR
[36:01] there so John knew from there it was not
[36:05] going to be revealed right then so he
[36:08] said but in the days of the voice of the
[36:10] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[36:11] sound that mystery will be finished then
[36:14] he picks right back up in verse eight
[36:16] and you see Bride you see Christ John
[36:19] and Christ on the scene and what does
[36:22] John do when he takes that book he eats
[36:24] it the book disappears until Revelations
[36:28] 20 and who judges the
[36:30] Earth that book and you judges the Earth
[36:34] okay Lord bless
[36:37] you come back we'll try to be here we're
[36:42] actually go to ministers meeting brother
[36:44] darl Hugh and we're going to stay over I
[36:46] think and go church over
