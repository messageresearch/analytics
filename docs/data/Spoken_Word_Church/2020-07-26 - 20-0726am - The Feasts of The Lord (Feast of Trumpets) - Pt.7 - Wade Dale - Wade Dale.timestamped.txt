[5:20] amen and your house but um
[5:24] we uh we just have some trying times and
[5:28] uh the trying times that we have
[5:32] means that we buckle up just a little
[5:36] bit
[5:36] tighter and
[5:41] if i don't want to i don't i don't like
[5:44] promoting other ministers because people
[5:45] get all yeti at you about it but
[5:47] uh there's brother chad lamb
[5:51] from llama ohio has a
[5:55] sermon that he preached about giving
[5:56] caesar what see caesar and god what's
[5:58] god
[5:59] so would be nice if you wanted to watch
[6:01] that he does a real good job
[6:04] he was a very hard-liner about not
[6:06] wearing masks and being this and that
[6:08] and the other and you know
[6:10] um but the lord kind of changed his
[6:13] attitude a little bit when
[6:15] he would read quotes for brother brown
[6:16] said my arms are sore from taking the
[6:19] malaria
[6:20] and taking all the different things that
[6:22] getting ready to go overseas
[6:24] he said that brother brown said i know
[6:26] i'm not going to get malaria he said but
[6:28] i'm going to satisfy caesar
[6:32] and do what caesar asked me to do but
[6:34] i'm going on for the glory of the lord
[6:36] so that's kind of what we're doing with
[6:37] our
[6:38] mask wearing and and hand sanitizing and
[6:41] all these things we're
[6:42] we're trying our best to uh to make it
[6:45] through
[6:45] i we've got up here on the board
[6:49] um if you want to in when you're home
[6:52] while you're home take a screenshot of
[6:54] this
[6:56] um and this will be the way that we will
[6:59] be
[7:00] um we don't have wednesday service up
[7:04] there we have wednesday at seven
[7:06] but uh sunday ten to ten and one
[7:09] this will be phase one back to what we
[7:11] were doing when we first started this
[7:14] with only so many group in the building
[7:17] now um
[7:21] joe is going to add it right there
[7:22] that's wonderful
[7:24] that's good all right so sunday at 10
[7:26] and at 1
[7:27] wednesday at 7 a list will be created
[7:30] and announced at every service
[7:32] now listen if you don't hear your name
[7:35] called
[7:35] or if you need if you have a question go
[7:38] back to this that's why we
[7:39] archive these sermons go back to it and
[7:43] look and you can hear what i say
[7:46] um and you can get clarity
[7:49] i know a lot of people you know get
[7:51] confused about things but if you'll come
[7:52] back and listen to the sermon you ain't
[7:54] got to listen to the whole sermon just
[7:55] listen to the first part of it
[7:57] we try to um
[8:02] simplify this mess okay so mass will be
[8:06] worn when exiting your vehicle
[8:08] this would be just the ones that come to
[8:09] service to look at number one a list
[8:12] i'm fixing to announce the list right
[8:14] now
[8:15] you'll be the only people come to
[8:16] services masks will be worn when exiting
[8:19] your vehicle
[8:20] you'll be allowed to remove it in the
[8:22] sanctuary and we'll be distancing just
[8:24] like we've been doing
[8:26] keeping our distance and then when we
[8:27] get ready to leave the service
[8:29] put your mass back on you can congregate
[8:31] downstairs and talk if you want to
[8:33] try to keep a safe distance there won't
[8:35] be but 10 or 12
[8:37] or 14 people here so but you need to
[8:39] make sure you
[8:40] wear your mask until you get ready to

[11:16] for the coronavirus so she is
[11:18] quarantined at home
[11:19] and um she's doing better she had a
[11:22] rough night i think
[11:23] dad said at a point a little bit last
[11:25] night
[11:26] but we're still praying that the lord
[11:28] will bring a complete healing
[11:31] and um um
[11:34] you know i was i'm just going to tell
[11:36] you this it's i'm
[11:37] i'm human as much as you guys are um
[11:40] i was having a pity party yesterday you
[11:43] know why in the world why in the world
[11:44] why in the world
[11:47] and i just got finished reading the book
[11:49] of job and the lord said uh you need to
[11:51] read that book over again
[11:53] because we got no symptoms what joke job
[11:55] was just living a happy life job was
[11:57] wonderful he was a good christian at the
[11:58] time
[12:00] doing his sacrifices and doing
[12:02] everything he knew
[12:04] he actually went above and beyond
[12:08] and god said have you considered my
[12:10] servant job he called
[12:12] the devil's attention to job that was
[12:14] sitting over there in his rose garden
[12:16] sipping his iced tea and living in an
[12:18] air-conditioned house and then about
[12:21] a month after that he had no children no
[12:23] house
[12:24] his wife was telling him to curse god
[12:26] and die he had balls all over him
[12:28] and if you read the book of job
[12:31] job does wonder a little bit what's
[12:34] going on you know and then the
[12:35] then the the three accusers come
[12:38] they're really trying to help him but
[12:40] but they really don't do much because
[12:42] when that fourth man when elihu comes on
[12:44] the scene now buddy that's when elihu
[12:46] just rebukes them all and says shut up
[12:48] stand up job get off your pity party
[12:51] and this is what god has done for you
[12:53] and then job just really comes down to a
[12:56] place he said look
[12:58] he says i should have never been born
[13:01] he said but i'm here and then elihu said
[13:05] look at the end of this it's going to be
[13:07] better than it was than it was at the
[13:09] first
[13:09] he got a double blessing so we're
[13:11] looking for a double blessing
[13:13] we're not looking for something worse
[13:15] we're looking for a double blessing
[13:17] of what god's going to give us so let us
[13:20] not have our pity parties you know
[13:21] brother branham he had a few of them so
[13:23] we're
[13:24] i don't think we're allowed to have them
[13:27] we're supposed to trust god and go on
[13:28] but we as humans question a lot of
[13:30] things
[13:31] but god will give you the answer i'll
[13:33] promise you it'll be in the lives of the
[13:35] people in the bible
[13:37] and it'll be in the lives of the
[13:39] believers of today
[13:41] um we've got some good reports brother
[13:43] ron spencer's doing better
[13:45] um and you'll see that you can see that
[13:47] online
[13:48] where he's now um doing a lot better
[13:51] than they thought this virus has got in
[13:54] a lot of churches
[13:55] uh brother richie douglas and some of
[13:57] the different ones they've had it
[13:59] and we just keep praying that this will
[14:02] be
[14:02] something that is going to help us
[14:06] to not destroy our faith because a lot
[14:08] of people will it'll destroy your faith
[14:09] if you don't just say well i
[14:12] can't change anything you know god but
[14:15] god's in control god's the one that
[14:17] loves us
[14:18] he knew this was going to happen before
[14:20] the foundation of the world and he
[14:21] allowed it to come on us for a reason
[14:23] and we need to take the reason
[14:25] and not be a reason of having pity party
[14:27] but a reason said lord
[14:29] what's next what's next the believer the
[14:33] footsteps of the righteous are ordered
[14:34] of the lord so you and i need to just
[14:36] keep on walking so this is where we're
[14:38] going to walk
[14:39] for a little while until we see
[14:43] something different i'll be speaking
[14:44] with brother dale we talk every day so
[14:46] we will um
[14:49] let you know when that changes so uh if
[14:52] you want to
[14:53] uh at the end of the service brother joe
[14:55] can put that back up
[14:57] um so that we can be clear on what we're
[15:00] going to do
[15:01] from this day forward all right we only
[15:03] have a few here today
[15:05] just four of us so we're going to go
[15:07] through now the feast
[15:08] of the trumpets if you pull leviticus 23
[15:12] 23 and i'm gonna try to skip through
[15:14] some of it
[15:16] um and get to the feast of the trumpets
[15:19] and not be very long even though we are
[15:22] 10 15 in the morning um
[15:26] we can uh we can get through this so
[15:30] leviticus 23 verse 23 let's bow our
[15:32] heads
[15:34] dear lord we come to a day father that
[15:37] has set aside lord to for us to worship
[15:40] you lord
[15:42] honor the resurrection lord i pray today
[15:45] that there'll be a resurrection in all
[15:46] of our lives lord of
[15:48] the message of the hour and while we're
[15:50] living here and what we're doing
[15:52] and realize why we're here
[15:55] and what purpose that we have in your
[15:59] great plan
[16:00] as brother dale's been talking about you
[16:02] having a plan and a purpose well i
[16:04] believe we were all
[16:05] included in that plan and i believe that
[16:08] we're not ever as
[16:09] being the bride of jesus christ this is
[16:11] one thing we can be sure of
[16:13] is that we're never written out of the
[16:15] script we're never written out of the
[16:17] play we're never written out of the plan
[16:20] we were part of the plan actually i
[16:22] believe the plan was
[16:24] purposely designed for your bride
[16:27] lord so that we can see and be
[16:30] overcomers in this age
[16:31] father we pray that you'll be the ones
[16:32] that are sick we know all the ones that
[16:34] we try to call lord to list
[16:36] is getting long father we pray that
[16:38] we'll
[16:39] that lord you'll hear our earnest prayer
[16:41] and that we will truly
[16:43] only believe because all things are
[16:45] possible
[16:46] there's nothing formed there's nothing
[16:49] there's nothing
[16:50] that man can come up with in the
[16:52] evilness of their heart or their mind
[16:54] whatever this virus
[16:56] wherever it came from we know lord that
[16:59] you
[17:00] are the king
[17:05] and you have no one above you
[17:10] and lord you love your bride
[17:13] because we stand by your side and lord
[17:15] we know that
[17:17] nothing will come upon us lord that is
[17:19] not gonna this
[17:20] that's going to hurt us yes and the
[17:22] footsteps really are the righteous our
[17:24] order of the lord so we're all
[17:26] lord as we saw job walking through his
[17:29] life
[17:31] lord he did some checking up to make
[17:32] sure everything was okay
[17:35] and lord i believe that's where the
[17:37] prophet got the quote that we always
[17:38] quote where brother branham
[17:39] tells us he says when you've done all
[17:41] you can do
[17:43] stand so job did all he could do he did
[17:46] everything he could do
[17:47] and he just stood and finally lord you
[17:50] came on the scene
[17:51] and you told job exactly what was going
[17:54] on through
[17:54] elihu the young one father we pray that
[17:57] you do that today come among us in a way
[17:59] that
[18:00] that we can understand you and your
[18:01] blessings will be upon us father in
[18:03] jesus name we pray
[18:05] amen leviticus 23
[18:08] 23-25 when the lord spake unto moses
[18:10] saying speaking to the children of
[18:12] israel
[18:12] saying in the seventh month in the first
[18:15] day of the month
[18:16] shall you have a sabbath a memorial of
[18:18] blowing of trumpets
[18:19] on holy convocation you shall do no
[18:22] servile work therein but you shall offer
[18:24] an offering made by fire
[18:27] unto the lord all right so let's um
[18:30] if you want could you pull that chart up
[18:31] for me um brother joe we can be seated
[18:34] and
[18:35] lord add his blessing instead of going
[18:36] through all the different ones let's
[18:38] just do it on the chart
[18:40] and we may just skip all the way down i
[18:42] may just highlight a little bit but i
[18:44] want to get to the feast of the trumpets
[18:45] because i want to bring a little
[18:46] something out
[18:47] that um that i believe the lord showed
[18:49] me yesterday
[18:51] on those trumpets so when we were
[18:53] starting our
[18:54] our um i guess you might say
[18:57] series on this um the feast
[19:02] i wanted you to see israel's part of
[19:04] this but i also want us to see that it's
[19:06] for us
[19:07] if it's the feast of the lord then it's
[19:10] for all of us
[19:11] all right it's for everyone that's here
[19:13] that we
[19:14] have to go through we we have to as a
[19:17] christian we have to go through these
[19:19] yes amen because israel had to go
[19:22] through these
[19:23] it was required now a lot of times they
[19:25] didn't do it a lot of times they forgot
[19:27] to do it and all these different things
[19:28] but you and i receiving the baptism of
[19:31] the holy ghost puts us to where
[19:33] we are aware of all these things that
[19:36] are going on we're aware that we have to
[19:38] that there there had to be something die
[19:40] for me
[19:41] i couldn't die for myself but luis
[19:43] couldn't die for me brother bob
[19:45] nobody could die for me and then
[19:47] transform
[19:48] that life into me to give me eternal
[19:52] life all right there was no animal
[19:55] there was nothing but a man had to do it
[19:57] but
[19:59] but to show in simple form god allowed
[20:03] the sacrifice to be done with animal
[20:05] blood to show
[20:06] that he's coming to be the ultimate
[20:08] passover lamb
[20:10] not just a lamb that you bring in and
[20:12] he's all perfect he's not broken bone
[20:14] and
[20:14] all these things are are fine but you're
[20:16] getting ready to kill that lamb
[20:18] yeah all right so the perfect lamb of
[20:21] god came on the earth
[20:22] god with skin on him john testified
[20:26] behold the lamb of god takes away the
[20:28] sin of the world
[20:29] showing that he was going to be that
[20:31] passover lamb
[20:33] that he was going to have to wait
[20:34] several years though and and grow up and
[20:36] all those different things to come to a
[20:38] place of calvary to where he's going to
[20:40] be
[20:41] the passover lamb as they were killing
[20:44] the lamb
[20:45] in the temple the lamb of god was dying
[20:48] on the
[20:48] cross for all their sins
[20:52] they turned him down they didn't care
[20:53] about him he was just to a roman soldier
[20:55] he was just another guy
[20:57] that they were going to crucify and
[21:00] throw him in a ditch you know they were
[21:01] just going to throw their body over in a
[21:03] pit
[21:03] put some lime on him and be forgotten
[21:05] and never know this person ever again
[21:08] and that's the way that was but now we
[21:10] know for a fact
[21:11] that that's not what happened that
[21:14] joseph of armathea took that
[21:16] body and put it in a tomb according to
[21:17] what the bible tells us
[21:19] that he was in the belly of the earth so
[21:21] many days and so many three days and
[21:22] three nights
[21:24] and then while he was gone
[21:28] the feast of unleavened bread began the
[21:30] next day they got all the leaven out of
[21:32] the house
[21:33] jesus christ's body was laying in the
[21:35] tomb
[21:36] his leaven was there he was doing he was
[21:39] down
[21:40] in the in hell preaching to the souls in
[21:42] prison
[21:44] in his theophany but his literal body
[21:46] was right there in that tomb
[21:48] it didn't go with him it stayed there in
[21:51] the earth
[21:52] and then what happened was on the day of
[21:54] first fruits
[21:57] that theophany comes back up
[22:00] and attaches he's the bread
[22:04] he's the bread of life he tells you many
[22:07] times he is the bread
[22:09] that come down out of heaven but
[22:10] remember that wasn't
[22:12] unleavened bread that's right it was a
[22:15] loaf
[22:18] when he fed the five thousand he fed him
[22:20] loaves he didn't feed him the
[22:22] the unleavened bread because it's like
[22:25] somebody asked that well where'd you see
[22:27] this leaven come back listen they always
[22:29] use
[22:29] leaven this is just the time the type of
[22:32] unleavened bread is
[22:34] is take those seven days clean yourself
[22:37] out in other words get rid of all the
[22:41] false doctrine get rid of all the sin
[22:43] and all the things in your house
[22:45] all right for those seven days or for
[22:47] those seven
[22:49] uh virtues or for those seven
[22:52] whatever you want to call it seals the
[22:54] seals to me is unleavened bread
[22:56] all right because it's the word of god
[22:58] the word of god's unleavened bread
[23:00] the word of god but jesus was standing
[23:03] in his leaven he was stan he was the
[23:06] bread
[23:07] of life which was a loaf as brother
[23:09] brown said
[23:10] we we didn't read it but brother brown
[23:12] tells us many times he said
[23:14] wow he said just think about a man
[23:16] reaching and get a loaf of bread that
[23:18] had been
[23:18] that had rose and been baked in an oven
[23:21] and as he was giving it out another
[23:22] piece just pops back on there what kind
[23:24] of power was that
[23:26] jesus didn't have a little convection
[23:27] oven sitting beside of him that he
[23:29] know it was being made because he was
[23:32] the bread of life and it was connecting
[23:34] to him
[23:35] he said you keep eating this in other
[23:37] words you eat the flesh of the son of
[23:39] man
[23:41] drink his blood that's what he said
[23:45] but we got to get the unleavened bread
[23:47] out of our
[23:48] soul out for our sin that we have in our
[23:52] house
[23:53] and even as we go up the statue of a
[23:55] perfect man there's still
[23:58] things that we need to get out the trash
[24:01] that's what this symbol is but it's just
[24:03] seven days so after this seven days
[24:06] they go back to eating bread with leaven
[24:08] in it
[24:09] so it's just a symbol of those seven
[24:11] days or seven church ages or
[24:13] whatever sevens you want to type it with
[24:16] is a time that you and
[24:18] i set aside it's a time that god set
[24:20] aside
[24:21] that he quit dealing with the jews
[24:23] started dealing with the gentiles
[24:24] dealt with us through seven church ages
[24:26] got all the 11 out of the people in each
[24:28] age
[24:30] yes each age
[24:33] had 11 which was what the doctrine of
[24:36] the pharisees
[24:37] doctrinal issues is what jesus was
[24:39] talking about
[24:41] so get that unleavened bread out
[24:45] now that doesn't mean that you put see
[24:47] you've got to watch your type that
[24:48] doesn't mean that after seven days you
[24:49] put the
[24:50] you put the 11 back in but you have to
[24:52] put 11 back in
[24:54] because of the feast of pentecost
[24:56] because you got to live in this thing
[24:58] christ had to live in this thing christ
[25:00] says i'm like i said he said i'm the
[25:01] bread of life not that little small
[25:04] matzah no he was the bread he was the
[25:06] full loaf
[25:07] of bread that came down out of heaven
[25:11] my the manna that they ate in in the
[25:13] children of israel
[25:14] here it comes down and just falls down
[25:16] every day and it's already cooked or
[25:17] whatever it needs to be done
[25:19] and it's little wafers and
[25:22] the bible says it had everything they
[25:23] needed and he made their clothes
[25:25] stay on you know stay clean and
[25:28] everything else so
[25:29] so god really took care of them like
[25:31] he's going to take care of us
[25:33] so there's the next day the 14th day of
[25:36] the first month
[25:36] is the passover the very next day starts
[25:38] unleavened bread
[25:40] and then what happened when christ was
[25:42] killed on the cross
[25:44] it just so happened that all those three
[25:46] days lined up
[25:48] together because the first fruits is the
[25:51] moral ab
[25:52] after the sabbath which that was the
[25:56] sabbath all right that saturday
[25:59] was a high sabbath because you had
[26:00] unlimited you had to pass over
[26:02] unleavened bread
[26:03] and then that monday was the feast of
[26:06] first fruits
[26:07] or that sunday sorry that sunday sunday
[26:09] right there look sunday
[26:11] was the feast of first fruits and then
[26:14] that feast of first fruits is what
[26:16] you go get your mature most mature plant
[26:20] you bring it to the priest the priest
[26:21] waves it before the people and says hey
[26:24] this is all good we have the first fruit
[26:27] now
[26:28] but that means that you can go out and
[26:30] gather whatever you got
[26:32] and remember that spring feast that was
[26:35] a barley harvest
[26:37] not a um wheat harvest the wheat harvest
[26:40] is right here in the feast of weeks
[26:42] the wheat matures after the barley
[26:45] so we mature after christ matures
[26:49] christ had to come to maturity first but
[26:51] he was just common barley
[26:53] he was just a common man common people
[26:56] hurt him gladly he was not understood
[26:58] but i believe this is what i believe
[27:00] that god has put focused
[27:02] all his attention on the bride right the
[27:05] wheat
[27:06] the sustaining life the wheat harvest is
[27:09] when he came on the day of pentecost
[27:12] which was
[27:16] 49 day you had you had to count 49 days
[27:20] seven sevens 49 days
[27:24] until what until
[27:27] the next day which was the feast
[27:31] of penta are 50 days
[27:34] after christ raised yes
[27:38] that's why i said before brother brown
[27:39] you know he's 30 to 40 days
[27:42] after his resurrection see
[27:45] we come on in here to the he he goes up
[27:47] and ascends and about 10 or 11 days
[27:49] later
[27:50] is the day of pentecost he said go and
[27:52] wait in jerusalem until you're endured
[27:53] with power on high
[27:54] so that's the same way with here what
[27:56] happens with us when we are harvested or
[27:58] when we come to a resurrection
[28:00] we're going to have 30 or 40 days before
[28:03] we are
[28:04] raptured because jesus was raptured
[28:08] about 40 days after his resurrection
[28:12] then he come what he couldn't be here at
[28:14] the same time the holy ghost is here
[28:17] because it's two people the same person
[28:21] came back on the day of pentecost and
[28:24] didn't just cover the people
[28:27] he went in the people and when the day
[28:30] of pentecost was fully come the bible
[28:32] tells us
[28:34] and thank god we had a prophet that
[28:36] could sit here and tell us
[28:38] as we were talking about before when we
[28:40] were talking about the passover
[28:41] god sent us a vindicated prophet he sent
[28:44] us
[28:46] an angel or a guide the holy ghost
[28:51] and what did brother branham come to do
[28:53] i was thinking about this the other day
[28:55] if you want to put it all in a nutshell
[28:58] why did he have to come he came to tell
[29:00] you
[29:01] you were sinless his whole message is to
[29:05] tell you that
[29:06] you're the sinless perfect bride of
[29:08] christ that's already been spoken in the
[29:10] bible
[29:12] it's been preached on for generations
[29:14] but this comes to
[29:16] the full part of when we get over here
[29:18] we'll see that in a minute
[29:20] but we have to come we come to a day of
[29:22] pentecost where we receive the baptism
[29:24] of the holy ghost
[29:25] you didn't and and don't click off
[29:28] but you didn't need a prophet to tell
[29:30] you that
[29:32] okay you didn't need a prophet to tell
[29:34] you how to get the new birth
[29:36] you wasn't supposed to now brother brown
[29:38] did but
[29:39] on the day of pentecost was peter james
[29:42] john
[29:43] not really prophets you might say major
[29:46] prophets
[29:47] the holy ghost fell on believers all
[29:50] right
[29:51] then paul a prophet comes on the scene
[29:54] he gets the baptism of the holy ghost so
[29:56] here you see that
[29:58] take 1906 azusa street when they had
[30:01] their
[30:01] pentecost it didn't take a profit
[30:04] it didn't take a man to walk out and say
[30:06] hey you need to be justified sanctified
[30:08] and filled with the holy ghost
[30:09] no brother brown said the holy ghost
[30:10] came himself
[30:13] and baptized them into the body with
[30:15] signs and wonders and all these
[30:17] different things
[30:18] and then just as paul came on the scene
[30:21] a little bit
[30:22] later after their pentecost 1906
[30:25] here comes brother branham in the 30s
[30:28] and the 40s and he's
[30:31] telling these people that now god is
[30:34] telling you hey
[30:37] you got to be justified sure you can
[30:40] speak in tongues sure you can
[30:42] have these evidences but you got to go
[30:44] back to the beginning
[30:46] true pentecost when the holy ghost fell
[30:49] 2
[30:50] 000 years ago to where those
[30:53] disciples you say disciples there's 120
[30:56] in the upper room they weren't all
[30:56] disciples
[30:58] but they were in the upper room and they
[31:01] were tutored by
[31:02] the lord justified and sanctified
[31:05] walking in that direction
[31:07] jesus breathes on him and says receive
[31:09] you the holy ghost but it didn't happen
[31:11] until the day of pentecost
[31:12] but when it did it fell on the people
[31:15] that had walked with the lord himself
[31:17] for three and a half years
[31:19] so now but then remember from right here
[31:23] in type in type from
[31:27] from the day of pentecost 2 000 years
[31:29] ago
[31:30] everybody got that say amen inside say
[31:33] amen
[31:33] all right 2 000 years ago there was a
[31:37] long period of time there was seven
[31:40] church ages
[31:41] from pentecost to the feast of trumpets
[31:47] in type everybody got that in tight
[31:50] wasn't exactly seven years or it wasn't
[31:52] exactly seven months it would
[31:54] but it was this is your longest gap
[31:57] pretty much
[31:59] from your fall fee or from your spring
[32:01] feast to your fall feast
[32:03] so same thing with you and i in 1906
[32:07] azusa street
[32:09] god came on the day of their pentecost
[32:12] in 1909 1906 azusa street
[32:16] they had their pentecost but they were
[32:18] speaking in tongues shouting and all
[32:20] these things
[32:21] but what did it take it took from 1906
[32:23] to about 1912 to bring in the jesus only
[32:26] water baptism but then you got 1933 and
[32:29] then up to 47
[32:31] it was a long period of time from that
[32:34] 1906
[32:34] azusa street experience for god to bring
[32:37] a prophet on the scene
[32:40] to sound the original trumpet
[32:43] that israel's been going through the
[32:44] whole time because remember a trumpetism
[32:46] is is is something that speaks it's
[32:48] something that
[32:50] listen if you're standing out in and
[32:53] well we don't congregate anymore but if
[32:55] you were standing out in a crowd
[32:57] and one man had a little horn and he
[33:00] might have been
[33:00] 300 yards from you but if he goes
[33:04] what does that do that turns everybody
[33:07] everybody gets quiet and they turn their
[33:08] attention to see
[33:09] what that noise was all about
[33:12] so god wasn't silent for all these other
[33:15] church ages god wasn't silent from 1906
[33:18] to 1933 or 30
[33:20] whatever time you want to think say that
[33:21] brother brown got his commission
[33:23] but we know in 1947 is when we started
[33:26] listening to the message
[33:27] all right whatever he spoke before that
[33:29] was fine and it was his growth period
[33:32] but he sent a prophet to sound a trumpet
[33:36] and i know it's kind of getting a little
[33:37] off of my order but you know what
[33:39] this is what it's all coming to this is
[33:41] the whole this is a
[33:42] like daniel 70 weeks this is daniel 70
[33:46] weeks this is to the jews and they get a
[33:49] natural happening listen
[33:51] they get natural they don't get a
[33:53] natural trumpet
[33:54] but the trumpets in revelations 8 and 9
[33:59] are real but that's not the feast of
[34:02] trumpets
[34:02] the feast of trumpets we'll read in a
[34:04] minute it's a blowing
[34:06] to get it's a blowing of a noise to get
[34:08] your attention
[34:09] because what they're gonna do is and
[34:11] we'll look at it in a few minutes
[34:13] the trumpet is sounded on the first day
[34:15] of october
[34:17] all right everybody got that it's kind
[34:20] of strange luis is the only one sitting
[34:22] in the building and i'm looking over
[34:23] here where brother danny sits and all
[34:25] the different ones so
[34:26] um and oh i forgot brother danny if
[34:29] you're listening i said brother donny
[34:30] but brother danny's right behind that
[34:32] you want to come to all right but
[34:35] we come here to the first day we'll read
[34:37] it because that's what the bible says
[34:39] but now remember there's nine there's 10
[34:42] days
[34:44] and we'll read it the bible tells us but
[34:46] i'm going to read you what they do in
[34:48] israel
[34:49] because that trumpet is blown to in
[34:53] other words wake the people
[34:54] up from this long time of slumber
[34:58] they've went to work they've done their
[35:00] job they've paid their bills
[35:03] i'm talking about natural natural israel
[35:06] has done all this through the summer
[35:07] heat of the summer right now we're in
[35:09] the heat of the summer right now
[35:10] probably we are in the heat of the
[35:12] summer of our
[35:14] christian christianity our heat part of
[35:17] our journey
[35:18] but what happens during that heat part
[35:19] is when things start maturing
[35:21] amen all right and the bread starts
[35:24] rising
[35:25] all right i need to go get some water i
[35:27] forgot i'm getting water
[35:30] excuse me
[35:35] all right so now we've come to
[35:41] in type they've waited this whole
[35:43] summertime and then what's going to
[35:45] happen right here these fall feasts
[35:48] are a little bit different from these
[35:50] now all right
[35:52] you've had a a harvest here of barley
[35:54] you've had a harvest here of wheat
[35:57] now remember their cycle is different
[35:58] from ours israel is
[36:01] in america you know we do all of our
[36:04] planting in the spring and we usually
[36:05] finish by here but now there is a fall
[36:07] crop and i'm fixing to plant a fall crop
[36:11] that we've probably never
[36:15] done before in our family but a fall
[36:18] crop
[36:19] until we come to the time of
[36:22] frost when i watch there's only one more
[36:26] there's another one right here another
[36:27] feast another harvest i mean
[36:31] there's three harvests here here and
[36:33] here and what's god doing
[36:35] he's heart he's bringing the first fruit
[36:37] he came on the day of pentecost to bring
[36:39] us what sustaining life he brought us
[36:42] that bread that jesus was talking about
[36:44] right
[36:45] so you look at and you see on the in the
[36:47] feast of pentecost what happened you
[36:49] bring in two loaves of bread
[36:51] out of your habitation you baked it in
[36:55] your oven
[36:57] amen you baked that in your oven
[37:00] and it was your responsibility to bake
[37:03] it
[37:06] with what you had oil
[37:10] and flour or wheat that was ground up
[37:14] and you made the loaves and you put them
[37:15] in the oven you baked them to a certain
[37:17] temperature
[37:18] and then you presented them to the
[37:20] priest all right so what are we doing
[37:22] now
[37:23] that's what happened on the day of
[37:24] pentecost peter james and john and all
[37:27] those in the upper room
[37:30] they were standing there
[37:34] and you can type this
[37:37] all the way through justification
[37:38] sanctification baptism holy ghost
[37:40] because god didn't send us a prophet
[37:42] after this long period of time to
[37:44] proclaim or to announce the trumpet to
[37:46] get back to what
[37:47] to get back to the original faith of the
[37:51] fathers
[37:52] which is justification sanctification
[37:54] and that's what they were telling
[37:55] he was telling them that's why they
[37:58] started kicking him out a little bit
[38:00] later he said look speaking of tongues
[38:01] is good but the devil's speaking tongue
[38:03] right
[38:04] you can live a good sanctified life he
[38:05] said that's just good he said but you've
[38:07] got to be justified sanctified filled
[38:09] with the holy ghost
[38:10] and look at everything the pat look at
[38:13] your life and all the things that you do
[38:15] well what the there was a gospel trumpet
[38:17] sounded
[38:19] in our time just like we're going to see
[38:22] this feast of the trumpets
[38:24] that's why you know that's why brother
[38:25] brown didn't preach the seven trumpets
[38:28] that's all to israel he had already
[38:30] preached them in the sixth seal because
[38:32] the sixth seal
[38:33] is going to happen to israel when we're
[38:35] gone those trumpets are gonna if you'll
[38:38] read
[38:38] we might read them later on but not
[38:41] today
[38:42] each trumpet had a different thing that
[38:44] they poured out and it wasn't good
[38:47] okay it's under the judgment time that
[38:50] you and i are not here
[38:52] see you and i go through all this we're
[38:55] harvested on this last feast of
[38:57] tabernacles because god's not just gonna
[38:58] take our soul
[39:00] that's right he's taking this too this
[39:02] tabernacle is going
[39:04] and then when it does then the
[39:06] revelations 8
[39:07] 9 and the trumpets
[39:12] seven trumpets are gonna sound through
[39:14] those two prophets which we're not gonna
[39:16] be here
[39:17] but what are they gonna call them back
[39:19] to they're gonna call them back to that
[39:22] day of atonement
[39:23] amen all right we'll get into that when
[39:25] we get into atonement
[39:26] they call them back to the day atonement
[39:28] not that christ has got to be killed
[39:30] again
[39:32] everybody got that say amen christ has
[39:34] not got it they not got to back way over
[39:36] here and say
[39:37] jesus christ because see they're looking
[39:39] for him to come
[39:41] they're looking for their messiah to
[39:42] come right israel
[39:44] the jews not the whole
[39:48] maybe we say the religious ones the
[39:50] orthodox jews they're waiting
[39:52] on something that's already happened
[39:54] correct
[39:55] so what the two prophets are going to do
[39:58] is god's going to give them the baptism
[40:00] of the holy ghost
[40:01] amen amen after we leave he's going to
[40:04] fill them too with the holy ghost
[40:06] and they're not they're going they're
[40:07] not going to relive this
[40:10] in other words christ is not going to
[40:12] come back and die again
[40:14] they're going to come to this feast of
[40:16] atonement now what we're going to get to
[40:17] the feast of atonement
[40:18] what it does it shows you it's a morning
[40:22] m-o-u-r-n-i-n-g
[40:23] not a.m but you're mourning for
[40:26] something that's already been done
[40:28] all right so they're going to turn them
[40:30] back to
[40:32] and say you miss this because this
[40:35] happened
[40:35] 2 000 years ago and you missed it
[40:40] then what they're going to do is excuse
[40:43] me they're going to get the living out
[40:44] of their house
[40:45] they're going to receive the holy ghost
[40:46] just like you did justification
[40:48] sanctification baptism the holy ghost
[40:50] all right
[40:51] not to make them bride because see the
[40:53] bride age is already over
[40:55] everybody got that the bride age is over
[40:58] we're gone
[40:59] right so there's no more bright age
[41:03] gentiles are bride only everybody got
[41:06] that
[41:07] right now there's some jews scattered in
[41:10] there and different ones but i'm talking
[41:11] about
[41:12] he will not he's not even dealing with
[41:15] israel until we leave
[41:16] that's right now don't get it in your
[41:18] head that god's not dealing at all
[41:20] he's working over there right now
[41:22] remember god's in motion all the time
[41:24] he's not waiting for me and you to leave
[41:28] and you know doing this no he's working
[41:32] but he can't do what he said he would do
[41:34] in the bible
[41:35] while we're still here so you and i had
[41:38] to come through
[41:39] let me run through this one more time
[41:42] because
[41:42] i'm getting ahead of myself but i want
[41:44] you to see why i'm i'm not preaching
[41:46] this just to
[41:47] tell you what israel's doing this is for
[41:50] me and you
[41:51] because this is what god does he shows
[41:53] us that he died
[41:55] get the unleavened bread out we got to
[41:57] come to maturity
[41:59] get the baptism of the holy ghost and
[42:00] then you got a journey you got to go
[42:02] through
[42:05] months and months of journey
[42:08] but you may be there one day you say
[42:10] well
[42:12] i heard one sermon or i heard two
[42:15] sermons or
[42:16] and that's okay you can get the holy
[42:18] ghost without hearing the prophet
[42:20] that's right amen without hearing of
[42:22] william branham you can get the baptism
[42:24] from the holy ghost
[42:24] because he didn't come to bring the holy
[42:26] ghost to us like it was taken away
[42:30] no the way to get it was taken away it
[42:32] had been falsely taught so much
[42:35] until it took a man with a message a
[42:37] trumpet
[42:39] to not change see that trumpet doesn't
[42:41] change any of this
[42:42] that day of atonement doesn't change any
[42:44] of this it's a
[42:46] we'll read it in just a minute it's a
[42:48] realization of what god's done already
[42:51] all right so you and i had to hear a
[42:54] gospel trumpet
[42:56] we had to hear a sound
[42:59] john heard a noise there and sound in
[43:00] revelations one he said i heard a
[43:02] sound of a voice as of a trumpet
[43:06] and i turned to see the voice well he
[43:09] wasn't looking for
[43:10] somebody standing you know trumpet over
[43:12] there out hanging in mid-air
[43:14] he knew that voice that's right so
[43:16] that's what you and i did we knew that
[43:18] voice now
[43:19] we may have been born again somewhere
[43:21] else that's okay
[43:23] i don't mind you can say that if you
[43:24] want to but you had to hear
[43:26] to become a bride of jesus christ under
[43:30] this church age messenger
[43:32] right you had to hear a trumpet amen you
[43:34] had to hear a blowing you had to hear a
[43:37] trumpet sound in your heart
[43:40] yes because why does
[43:43] why does the world why have you i've
[43:47] heard many of you and myself to you
[43:49] you talk to people about god sending a
[43:51] prophet and
[43:52] all these different messages and the way
[43:54] he brought it and all this and and some
[43:57] people
[43:57] just it's an uncertain sound
[44:01] it has no ring to it but what about the
[44:04] ones you see though
[44:06] that you've told about the message
[44:10] and it just transforms everything that
[44:12] they think because it has to that when
[44:14] that trumpet sounds
[44:16] of this message of the hour see
[44:20] it changes and when a trumpet sounds you
[44:23] remember there was a trumpet to go to
[44:25] battle
[44:26] there was a trumpet to retreat there was
[44:27] a trumpet sound to move left there was a
[44:30] trumpet sound to move right
[44:32] because that's what everybody depended
[44:33] on so we depended on
[44:35] a true certain sound that's why brother
[44:38] brown preached you know if the trumpet
[44:40] has an uncertain sound the bible tells
[44:42] you that don't listen to it but how do
[44:44] you know it's a certain sound
[44:46] because you know it's characteristics
[44:49] you've been taught
[44:51] all right now see you can you can get
[44:53] the holy ghost and hear the trumpet at
[44:54] the same time
[44:55] but some have come through other
[44:58] denominations even through the
[44:59] pentecostals and i believe if you
[45:00] receive the baptism of the holy ghost
[45:02] that's fine
[45:03] but when you heard that trumpet when you
[45:05] heard that little man say good morning
[45:07] friends
[45:08] or when you hear a tape or hear somebody
[45:11] talking about
[45:13] the prophet of god it's a different
[45:16] sound to that that's right
[45:18] but now when that sound comes and it's a
[45:22] true
[45:22] sounding in your heart you will
[45:25] gravitate to it not run away from it
[45:29] because if you hear that true sound it
[45:30] says charge
[45:32] do you hear the calvary you know that
[45:35] there's a
[45:37] i just got this there was a command from
[45:40] above
[45:42] there was a command from a general that
[45:44] was looking over the battlefield he had
[45:46] the high ground
[45:47] that's right he had the high ground and
[45:49] he could see what was going on and he
[45:51] said oh
[45:52] we need to charge over here because the
[45:54] enemy's getting ready to be defeated or
[45:56] there's a weakness in this line right
[45:57] here
[45:58] he says sound the alarm charge in that
[46:01] direction
[46:02] well those soldiers had confidence
[46:05] in that sound of that trumpet not just
[46:08] the sound of the trumpet that the notes
[46:10] were perfect
[46:11] right right no it was the authority
[46:13] behind that trumpet that they had been
[46:15] trained that you hear this certain key
[46:17] this certain noise you go in this
[46:20] certain direction and you
[46:21] charge because there's a general that
[46:23] knows what he's doing
[46:25] standing up there watching over you
[46:28] that's right
[46:29] i hope you're running around in the
[46:30] living room
[46:32] there's a general that knows what he's
[46:33] talking about and he has give the
[46:35] command
[46:36] to charge and you put your whole
[46:38] confidence listen
[46:39] they put their whole life in it that's
[46:42] right
[46:43] because what if he was saying retreat
[46:47] the enemies built up a great big camp
[46:49] over here and they're coming in this
[46:50] direction
[46:52] but this other preacher over here come
[46:55] on
[46:57] there's no i think we need a charge
[47:00] he hits the charge sound they're gonna
[47:03] die
[47:03] that's right but this general has enough
[47:06] confidence says hey
[47:07] pull back so i like what general robert
[47:10] e lee says he said
[47:11] let's live to fight another day and
[47:14] that's what we're doing now with all
[47:15] this
[47:15] stuff going on we're living to fight
[47:17] another day we'll have our day brother
[47:18] donnie fall bush and i were talking
[47:20] yesterday
[47:20] the devil can laugh all he wants to
[47:26] but the bible says we look at that man
[47:29] and say is this the man that caused
[47:32] nations to fall
[47:34] he's just like a sock drunk on the side
[47:36] of the road so
[47:37] we're not going to get the last laugh
[47:39] but we do
[47:40] read the book and see who wins so the
[47:44] devil does not win
[47:45] but see we know we have confidence in
[47:47] the general though when he says charge
[47:49] then the full authority of that army is
[47:51] behind that
[47:52] and that's what we were looking at here
[47:55] when we saw a little prophet come on the
[47:56] scene we saw the authority of god behind
[47:58] him so much to when he would speak
[48:00] things would happen
[48:02] amen and that's the same way that we're
[48:04] coming to with you and i that's why
[48:05] brother brown talks about coming into
[48:06] speaking condition
[48:08] where you get a message and a messenger
[48:11] we know the messenger is true we've just
[48:12] got to get under that message
[48:14] that's right to be the final voice of
[48:16] the final age we've got to get under
[48:18] that general
[48:19] but we've got to carry out what he said
[48:21] quit fighting about it if he's wrong
[48:23] here and the dates are wrong and this is
[48:24] wrong and
[48:25] he's wrong here and i
[48:30] heard somebody tell me the other day
[48:31] that a certain individual's not coming
[48:33] to this church anymore because i said
[48:35] brother branham was wrong
[48:37] i never said brother brown was wrong i
[48:40] said he made mistakes just like we make
[48:42] mistakes
[48:46] and in the daniel 70 weeks he didn't
[48:48] make a mistake
[48:49] he was right what he was saying we just
[48:51] weren't interpreting exactly what he was
[48:52] saying
[48:52] because you got to go back to the bible
[48:55] go back to daniel 9
[48:57] and read the three periods you say but
[49:00] brother brown said
[49:01] hold on a minute you're listening to an
[49:04] uncertain sound
[49:06] you hadn't got you you hadn't got lined
[49:08] up with your general
[49:09] right you get lined up with a general he
[49:11] tells us what to do and we go do it
[49:14] right excuse me so here so now we've
[49:17] heard that
[49:18] sound we as believers
[49:23] so what's happening in natural israel
[49:25] natural israel has went through all this
[49:27] they've had their feast
[49:29] they had to wait 49 days and on the 50th
[49:32] day they had a feast
[49:33] feast of pentecost all right a one-day
[49:36] feast that's why everybody was gathered
[49:37] in jerusalem when the bible says the day
[49:39] of pentecost was fully come
[49:40] in the book of acts then they had to
[49:42] wait for a long period of time
[49:44] several months to have a trumpet blow
[49:48] now what they're doing now is
[49:49] they haven't had this yet in the two
[49:52] prophets
[49:55] sure they're doing this naturally you
[49:56] understand what i'm saying there if you
[49:58] look online
[50:00] but what they've done they've turned it
[50:01] into like a festival
[50:04] okay where they they do a lot of natural
[50:08] stuff
[50:09] they eat this natural bread and they
[50:11] they
[50:12] they hide leaven so they can make a game
[50:14] out of it why because they don't think
[50:16] their messiahs come so they're just
[50:17] they're saying oh this is the old
[50:18] testament this is the torah we've got to
[50:20] do what it says
[50:21] it's just become a ritual to them just
[50:24] like brother uh just like brother
[50:26] brown just like god said you these have
[50:28] become
[50:29] these feasts and these sacrifices have
[50:31] become a stink in my nostrils because
[50:32] you're just
[50:33] you're just going through the motions
[50:35] all right
[50:37] because remember this is when jesus went
[50:39] into the temple
[50:40] right before passover if you'll read
[50:43] your bible
[50:45] and i think you'll see a quote where
[50:46] brother brown says that's
[50:48] he was in the temple before the passover
[50:51] and the priests were selling
[50:53] animals birds and doves and
[50:57] lambs they were selling it in the temple
[50:59] so that they could put it up for so many
[51:01] days and then have this feast of
[51:03] passover
[51:04] not that they went out there this is why
[51:06] jesus was mad
[51:08] number one they didn't go out there it
[51:10] tells
[51:11] us to find a lamb
[51:14] go out in your find the first fruit
[51:17] find the firstborn put him up for so
[51:20] many days
[51:21] check him out in other words you do have
[51:24] something to do with this
[51:25] that's right okay you have nothing to do
[51:27] with parts but this part you got
[51:28] something to do with
[51:30] and what they were doing was they were
[51:31] just going up and saying hey joe
[51:33] i need a lamb here's five dollars
[51:36] give me this lamb and the priest says
[51:38] everything's fine
[51:39] yeah we've checked him out and probably
[51:42] they had not
[51:44] because they wanted the money and the
[51:46] money was going on inside the church
[51:48] and jesus stood there and watched them
[51:50] and i believe it boiled inside of him
[51:52] yeah
[51:53] the bible says he got angry or whatever
[51:55] you want to call it that's right
[51:57] because you know why i believe it's been
[51:59] revealed to him
[52:01] that he was the passover lamb and that
[52:04] they were doing to them
[52:05] what they were going to do to him
[52:07] because that's what they did
[52:09] they killed they killed the passover
[52:11] lamb and just he
[52:13] hung between two thieves he was just
[52:15] another person to the
[52:17] to the romans he was just nothing he
[52:19] what didn't have any power he was just
[52:21] he was really a weakling yeah but all
[52:25] no god hiding himself in simplicity
[52:29] but he got a little bit ill with them
[52:32] charging money
[52:34] just like what happens in the catholic
[52:37] church
[52:38] you pay money for novenia's you pay
[52:41] money
[52:41] for a priest to go and do his whatever
[52:44] to bypass telling christ i'm sorry
[52:49] to bypass repenting to jesus christ for
[52:51] what you've done
[52:52] you just tell that priest and he says oh
[52:54] pay me five dollars
[52:56] stay for hail mary's and everything's
[52:58] fine
[52:59] well see jesus christ if he was here
[53:01] standing on earth he'd do the same thing
[53:03] to them that he did to the ones back
[53:04] then
[53:05] all right so but we see the natural
[53:07] feasts
[53:09] are done every year they just keep doing
[53:12] them
[53:15] but you and i see
[53:18] and jesus christ christ at that time
[53:22] writing this was writing this for them
[53:25] to do
[53:26] to remember him to remember jehovah
[53:29] at that time he was jehovah to remember
[53:31] jehovah because remember these are the
[53:33] feasts of the lord
[53:34] that's right all right remember the
[53:36] feast of the lord what you're supposed
[53:38] to not
[53:39] look at the priest or or look at joe or
[53:42] somebody right beside of you or
[53:43] or whatever you're supposed to look to
[53:45] christ
[53:47] this is showing the christ being the
[53:48] first fruit
[53:50] that he was gonna bless them on this day
[53:52] of pentecost that he was gonna
[53:54] blow a trumpet for them to come to a
[53:56] place to
[53:58] take 10 days and to really check
[54:00] yourself out
[54:02] all right then the day of atonement to
[54:05] remember
[54:06] that back here in the spring of nissan
[54:09] 14
[54:10] there was a lamb guy that died amen for
[54:13] your sins
[54:14] that's right amen even in the natural
[54:18] when you say that by louise even in the
[54:20] natural that makes you feel
[54:21] you feel man you take that one day
[54:26] and the lord brings back to your memory
[54:28] that there was a little bitty lamb that
[54:30] got up on that that
[54:31] you threw up on the altar cut his throat
[54:34] and he died you went through all these
[54:37] things sure
[54:38] but you come right here to this day of
[54:40] atonement you realize
[54:42] what christ has done for you see that's
[54:45] the same way with you and i
[54:46] what really brings us close to god is is
[54:49] this message of the hour
[54:50] has totally rided the ship
[54:54] we've been denomination and all this and
[54:57] father son holy ghost and
[54:59] all these questions and all these seals
[55:02] and daniel 70 weeks
[55:04] god brought us a true trumpet
[55:07] to right the ship so that we know what
[55:10] direction we're going in
[55:11] we have a what we look back to our
[55:14] spiritual rudder you always got to look
[55:15] back to your spiritual rudder
[55:17] that's why
[55:22] that it bothers me when we talk about
[55:24] daniel 70 weeks and
[55:26] and uh some of you brothers were there
[55:29] when we had the minister's meeting
[55:31] there was 20-something ministers that
[55:32] didn't even have the book
[55:34] they wanted to come there and they want
[55:36] you know they had their tablet with
[55:38] their number one quotes on it
[55:40] but they never studied it out never read
[55:43] the book
[55:43] probably even never listened to the tape
[55:46] why they've always been told to stay
[55:47] away from it
[55:48] right some of them didn't have the book
[55:51] some of them might have had the book but
[55:52] it looked brand new
[55:55] all the hours look worn out because you
[55:56] go it over and over and over again but
[55:58] you know what we studied to show ourself
[55:59] approved
[56:00] we heard the correct trumpet now i'm not
[56:02] listen i'm not saying those ministers
[56:03] didn't have the holy ghost
[56:05] by no means but they don't have they
[56:08] didn't have a
[56:09] true teaching or a true trumpet sound
[56:12] we know what the general said
[56:16] daniel 9 24 there's three distinct
[56:18] periods
[56:19] a one week another a 62
[56:24] 7 69 and then one more weeks left after
[56:27] the rapture
[56:28] i don't care what anybody says yes right
[56:31] the bible says
[56:32] that when he shall make a covenant with
[56:33] many for one week who is that the
[56:35] antichrist
[56:36] listen we're already gone by then amen
[56:39] but he makes
[56:40] a covenant with these jews for one week
[56:43] after we leave
[56:45] and that one week will finish 70 weeks
[56:47] because 69 is already determined
[56:49] right you just read your bible you got
[56:52] to make the quotes fit the bible you
[56:53] can't make the bible fit the quotes
[56:55] because we know what the general said
[56:57] amen all right
[56:58] jesus christ is our general brother
[57:00] brown was not our general
[57:02] but he's right there what he's right
[57:04] there that it was a voice that god spoke
[57:06] to a vessel
[57:07] a trumpet that god spoke through to get
[57:10] us the right
[57:12] sound when we needed it
[57:15] and we needed it in this end time we
[57:18] needed a correct sound why
[57:19] because we're going to take a tabernacle
[57:21] change
[57:22] we're not we sure we took everybody
[57:25] millions of people
[57:26] have took a spiritual change everybody
[57:27] got that
[57:29] millions there's going to be millions of
[57:30] bride that takes a
[57:32] spiritual change but there's only going
[57:35] to be one group
[57:37] that takes a natural change and not have
[57:40] to see death
[57:41] that's it and that's the feast of
[57:43] tabernacles that brother brown said you
[57:45] and i
[57:46] are now feasting under it's the feast of
[57:48] tabernacles
[57:50] where they go set in the booth correct
[57:53] amen we'll get to that but see that's
[57:56] your last harvest
[57:58] that's when the reapers are going to
[57:59] come and they're going to harvest
[58:01] and that happens in the fall
[58:06] one day day number one of october day
[58:09] number 10 of october
[58:10] and then day number 10 through 15 and
[58:13] 15-20 we'll get to it
[58:15] and we see that they go then for
[58:18] a period of time they sit in the booth
[58:22] but see you and i spiritually though we
[58:24] go through every one of these
[58:26] i want you to realize that that every
[58:27] one of these you and i have to go
[58:29] through
[58:30] we have to go through a time of
[58:32] pentecost and because we're going to
[58:33] read
[58:33] about your trumpets in just a minute we
[58:36] got
[58:36] you and i have to realize we've come to
[58:39] a day of pentecost
[58:40] that we've received the baptism of the
[58:42] holy ghost all right
[58:43] and then we've got this long journey
[58:47] now you say well now i heard this
[58:50] trumpet back over here
[58:51] that's all right but the feast of the
[58:53] trumpets is when you come to
[58:55] one day or one time in your life
[58:58] where you say that ain't nothing but the
[59:00] truth amen
[59:02] yes haiti wright was a born again
[59:04] believer she had probably heard brother
[59:06] branham since the 30s
[59:08] 40s maybe she went to church
[59:11] but one day she come to a place of a
[59:14] third pull
[59:15] to where it wasn't it wasn't brother
[59:18] branham speaking
[59:21] it was him saying hattie you've come to
[59:23] a spot
[59:25] because when she said that ain't nothing
[59:27] but the truth what she was doing was
[59:28] vindicating
[59:30] that that was the truth what the trumpet
[59:32] was sounding
[59:33] that's right everybody got that so
[59:35] that's what you and i must come to
[59:36] that we know that the truth of what
[59:38] sounded
[59:40] when we say that ain't nothing but the
[59:41] truth it changed the world for two kids
[59:44] for two guys two kids two children
[59:46] so that's what it needs to be for you
[59:48] and i that's why we talk about coming to
[59:49] speaking
[59:50] condition and then we come to the day of
[59:52] atonement
[59:54] because i believe we truly got to
[59:55] realize
[59:57] and see you gotta look back when they
[59:58] come to that day of atonement look what
[1:00:00] they do
[1:00:01] they back up all these months and
[1:00:04] realize
[1:00:04] way back over here in the beginning of
[1:00:06] your journey something died for you
[1:00:09] so don't ever forget jesus christ don't
[1:00:11] ever forget calvary
[1:00:12] don't ever forget this man died for you
[1:00:15] but you and i have come through all
[1:00:16] these feasts and we've come and
[1:00:18] we're coming around this way and we're
[1:00:20] heading to this right here
[1:00:22] but let's stop right here and let's read
[1:00:23] just for a minute i know we got to skip
[1:00:26] through brother joe
[1:00:27] all the excuse me all the quotes
[1:00:32] down to
[1:00:39] the very last one here somewhere
[1:00:43] where it talks about the feast of
[1:00:44] trumpets if you can find that brother
[1:00:46] joe
[1:00:46] it says trumpets and it's right at the
[1:00:48] almost the last
[1:00:50] two pages where we're going to talk
[1:00:54] about just for a minute
[1:00:55] you'll be fine we'll just talk about it
[1:00:56] defeat because the feast of the trumpets
[1:00:59] is not it's a one day of blowing of the
[1:01:02] trumpet all right
[1:01:04] so they went through that long period of
[1:01:06] time like i said we've labored
[1:01:08] all these church ages we've labored
[1:01:10] through all these
[1:01:11] uh listen folks we're gonna have a
[1:01:13] glorious time because look
[1:01:15] the same trumpet that called you here
[1:01:16] what did you tell brother charlie cox he
[1:01:18] said the same
[1:01:18] sound same voice that said turn around
[1:01:21] is one day gonna say
[1:01:23] come up amen yeah we're good
[1:01:26] see the same voice so it's not gonna be
[1:01:29] you're gonna hear a sound here and it's
[1:01:30] gonna be different here
[1:01:32] that's right the same loud voice the
[1:01:35] prophet says that raised lazarus the
[1:01:36] same
[1:01:37] trumpet that raised lazarus from the
[1:01:39] dead is the same trumpet
[1:01:41] that's going to sound through a group of
[1:01:42] people
[1:01:45] and bring the dead out of the ground
[1:01:47] because jesus christ won't be here
[1:01:49] see remember he left he left right
[1:01:51] before pentecost and he's not seen again
[1:01:55] until he comes back in two witnesses now
[1:01:57] sure he's in his bride
[1:01:58] but he's hidden jews think we're still
[1:02:02] dogs
[1:02:03] we're still dogs to them we have no oh
[1:02:06] yeah you got religion and you got
[1:02:08] you know this jesus man he was a good
[1:02:09] man he's a prophet and
[1:02:13] then you've got the group that says well
[1:02:14] muhammad was a good prophet and this one
[1:02:16] buddha was a good prophet and then you
[1:02:18] see what i mean see
[1:02:20] when somebody starts sounding that's why
[1:02:23] when i was with those two mormons and
[1:02:26] nothing against the mormon doctrine i i
[1:02:28] just i just can't
[1:02:29] it's not a familiar trumpet sound
[1:02:32] but you hear what their doctrine is now
[1:02:35] to them that's a trumpet
[1:02:38] but it's not blown in the right way
[1:02:41] their general
[1:02:42] was not the general okay
[1:02:46] we've got to believe that the right
[1:02:48] general
[1:02:49] sent the right message and we're hearing
[1:02:52] the right trumpet because when we hear
[1:02:54] other people talk about
[1:02:55] uh especially if you have you been
[1:02:57] sitting in a room somewhere
[1:02:59] i remember we were sitting uh years ago
[1:03:04] at a certain meeting with five or six
[1:03:06] hundred people
[1:03:08] this brother was preaching away and all
[1:03:11] the hell that we
[1:03:12] you know basically when we were babies
[1:03:14] there was eternal life in us and i mean
[1:03:16] all the people were just up and shouting
[1:03:19] except for about six or eight i was
[1:03:20] brother richard wilson was there and all
[1:03:22] my family some of the people from church
[1:03:23] were sitting down this row
[1:03:25] and we just sit there because i don't
[1:03:28] believe that
[1:03:29] right i believe you had representation i
[1:03:30] believe god gave you an angel because he
[1:03:32] knew
[1:03:32] by foreknowledge where you would go and
[1:03:34] what you would do and where that seed
[1:03:36] would land
[1:03:37] but you weren't born with eternal life
[1:03:39] in your soul
[1:03:40] it wasn't but one person and that's
[1:03:42] jesus christ
[1:03:45] period yeah and adam but adam wasn't a
[1:03:48] baby
[1:03:49] adam was full-grown all right
[1:03:52] so what happened they were hearing
[1:03:57] a sound right they were hearing a
[1:04:00] trumpet they were hearing someone speak
[1:04:03] bringing their view
[1:04:07] and probably 550 of the 600 people
[1:04:11] or 590 of the 600 people
[1:04:14] were shouting their you know their shoe
[1:04:16] hills off what we always say
[1:04:19] and we didn't why because it did it was
[1:04:21] an uncertain
[1:04:22] noise and i don't say that belittling
[1:04:26] but sometimes you just hear noise
[1:04:31] because when a trumpet sounds from god
[1:04:33] it always has a meaning
[1:04:36] remember he doesn't do anything forever
[1:04:37] he doesn't just stand up and say and
[1:04:40] then there's nothing behind it no
[1:04:41] whenever god sounds a trumpet right
[1:04:44] there's something going to happen all
[1:04:47] right
[1:04:48] so that's what's going to be with us
[1:04:49] here excuse me we heard the trumpet
[1:04:52] sound of this message
[1:04:53] and then we've got to realize that it is
[1:04:56] the true sound of a trumpet
[1:04:57] that's right now listen but be careful
[1:05:00] you say
[1:05:01] well i heard luther's trumpet because it
[1:05:03] was right it was right for his day
[1:05:06] it was right for his concert his concert
[1:05:10] was different from ours
[1:05:12] his concert was justification would take
[1:05:15] him into
[1:05:16] a uh receiving of the baptism of the
[1:05:18] holy ghost because that's all god
[1:05:20] required he required this sheet of music
[1:05:22] for luther
[1:05:24] all right now wesley he required another
[1:05:27] sheet of music
[1:05:29] now not doing away with this sheet of
[1:05:30] music because this was included in it
[1:05:34] right amen but then you come to where we
[1:05:37] see pentecost they blew a trumpet
[1:05:39] god blew a trumpet
[1:05:42] but remember god kept moving on he
[1:05:44] turned the page to another sheet of
[1:05:46] music
[1:05:47] so you and i in the bride age but look
[1:05:50] you know where we've come to
[1:05:52] look here where we've come to that's the
[1:05:54] last sheet of music
[1:05:56] there's nothing after this so there's no
[1:05:59] other sound that we get now
[1:06:01] we know that sound goes to israel
[1:06:04] that trumpet goes to israel and they
[1:06:06] hear the sound of those two witnesses
[1:06:09] which calls them back to the day of
[1:06:12] atonement we'll get into it later on
[1:06:14] the day of atonement where they mourn
[1:06:18] and zach around all the different places
[1:06:20] they separate from their wives they go
[1:06:21] and mourn
[1:06:22] because they had killed their messiah
[1:06:24] and didn't even know it
[1:06:25] right but god said oh stop don't worry
[1:06:28] about it
[1:06:28] this is done to preserve life i was
[1:06:31] going to get a gentile bride out of this
[1:06:34] and then you're still coming in amen so
[1:06:37] here we go
[1:06:37] trumpet here we are at the trumpets
[1:06:39] we'll just for a few minutes
[1:06:42] and the lord spoke unto moses
[1:06:46] and said speaking to the children of
[1:06:49] israel
[1:06:49] saying in the seventh month all right
[1:06:53] the seventh month in the first day of
[1:06:56] the month you shall have a
[1:06:57] sabbath all right there's your style you
[1:06:59] have a sabbath it doesn't matter if it's
[1:07:01] the seventh day
[1:07:04] it's a special day what was the special
[1:07:07] day
[1:07:08] you heard the trumpet
[1:07:12] you got to have one well i just heard
[1:07:15] no there was a special day when that
[1:07:17] trumpet sounded like i said before
[1:07:19] and something rang different from any
[1:07:22] other sound you heard
[1:07:24] you've been hearing messages from
[1:07:25] baptist and luis come from
[1:07:28] baptist into pentecost and then up to
[1:07:31] the message
[1:07:32] there were sounds going off everywhere
[1:07:33] there's sounds going off all in the
[1:07:35] world
[1:07:36] but there's one true trumpet and when
[1:07:38] israel come to that one day
[1:07:40] that one day the first day of october
[1:07:42] the first day of the month
[1:07:44] they had a blowing of the trumpet
[1:07:46] everybody stopped and i'll read the
[1:07:47] commentary about what happened
[1:07:49] because the bible really doesn't tell
[1:07:51] you anything
[1:07:53] it just says you shall have a sabbath a
[1:07:54] memorial of blowing of
[1:07:56] trumpets and holy convocation
[1:07:59] you shall do no servile work therein but
[1:08:01] you shall offer an offering made by fire
[1:08:04] unto the lord all right let's go to
[1:08:06] isaiah 58
[1:08:08] 1. this is kind of uh and actually this
[1:08:11] is the scripture that
[1:08:12] that the lord called me to preach on
[1:08:13] right here uh i was reading isaiah 58
[1:08:16] getting ready to do a sunday school
[1:08:18] class and
[1:08:19] i read this and i said june read this
[1:08:21] right here and see what this says and
[1:08:22] june read the scripture right here and
[1:08:23] she said god's calling you to preach
[1:08:26] so this is it right here but look cry
[1:08:28] aloud and that's me
[1:08:29] that's tony i'm allowed cry loud
[1:08:34] spare not lift lift up thy voice
[1:08:38] like a trumpet and show my people their
[1:08:41] transgression
[1:08:42] and the house of jacob their sins and
[1:08:45] then it continues on down talking about
[1:08:48] more of the blowing of the trumpet and
[1:08:49] telling different things but this is
[1:08:50] look
[1:08:51] a voice like a trumpet so a voice has
[1:08:53] always been compared
[1:08:55] to a trumpet and we'll next sunday
[1:08:58] if you go to revelations 1 john says i
[1:09:01] heard a
[1:09:03] voice that sounded like a trumpet
[1:09:05] talking to me
[1:09:07] so there's your symbolism he didn't hear
[1:09:09] two truths he said he heard somebody say
[1:09:12] john and when that voice rang in his ear
[1:09:17] he knew that was that man he had seen on
[1:09:19] the shores of galilee he knew that was
[1:09:21] that guy that said
[1:09:23] you know um some of you will not
[1:09:27] some of you will not die until you see
[1:09:28] the lord
[1:09:31] coming in his glory well see that john
[1:09:33] to john that was a trumpet he knew
[1:09:36] had no uncertain sound because when he
[1:09:38] turned i don't
[1:09:40] listen remember when he turned he saw
[1:09:42] seven golden candlesticks and one like
[1:09:44] the son of man in the seven gold
[1:09:45] candlesticks
[1:09:46] his surprise was is when he turned to
[1:09:48] not just see jesus standing there
[1:09:50] all right but he saw jesus
[1:09:54] in the seven golden candlesticks in
[1:09:56] those seven stars
[1:09:58] messengers that brought these people
[1:10:02] because remember without people you have
[1:10:04] no church ages
[1:10:06] you got to have believers in every
[1:10:08] church age you can't just have seven
[1:10:10] stars and
[1:10:10] oh these are great men but these great
[1:10:14] men right here
[1:10:15] were nothing without somebody
[1:10:18] hearing that sound that message that
[1:10:22] trumpet
[1:10:23] i mean what would be brother branham if
[1:10:25] he just came and preached in 1947 and
[1:10:28] 20 people heard him and nobody believed
[1:10:31] him and
[1:10:32] why he just you know he just went out of
[1:10:35] existence he did just
[1:10:36] you know because many have done that but
[1:10:38] no he had a message
[1:10:40] and it corresponded with the holy ghost
[1:10:43] that was in those believers
[1:10:48] oh now some got for the fishes and loaf
[1:10:51] some got
[1:10:52] caught for the healing but remember
[1:10:53] brother brown said that was the bait on
[1:10:55] the hook it was bait
[1:10:57] but the hook was a message there was
[1:10:59] only a certain other group that had took
[1:11:01] that page from pentecost
[1:11:02] and had turned it to the message of the
[1:11:04] hour amen
[1:11:06] and then he goes off the scene and all
[1:11:08] these a lot of people they leave
[1:11:12] i didn't believe to start with but they
[1:11:15] leave but here you and i
[1:11:16] we've made this long don't pull the
[1:11:18] chart back up but from
[1:11:19] from that long day of pentecost all the
[1:11:22] way down
[1:11:23] to this last church age me and you have
[1:11:25] heard a trumpet sound
[1:11:28] and it was a voice like a trumpet and
[1:11:30] show my people their transgression in
[1:11:32] the house of jacob their sin
[1:11:33] ezekiel 33 verse 2
[1:11:38] son of man speak to the children of thy
[1:11:41] people
[1:11:42] and say unto them when i bring the sword
[1:11:44] now watch this
[1:11:46] watch this right here this is happening
[1:11:48] in this day as
[1:11:50] we speak you have got to determine
[1:11:54] everybody with me you got to determine
[1:11:58] whether your watchman is telling you the
[1:12:00] right thing or not
[1:12:02] watch son of man speak to the children
[1:12:06] of thy people and say unto them
[1:12:08] when i bring the sword what is the sword
[1:12:11] sword is the word when i bring the word
[1:12:14] upon a land
[1:12:16] and if the people of the land take a man
[1:12:18] of their coast and set him for their
[1:12:20] watchmen
[1:12:21] their pastor you might say if you want
[1:12:24] to
[1:12:25] are there prophet you can go on all the
[1:12:27] way up there too if you want to
[1:12:29] if when he seeth the word come upon the
[1:12:32] land
[1:12:33] or the sword what this is listen
[1:12:36] excuse me let's back up for a minute
[1:12:38] what what is this
[1:12:40] there's a watch tower that's why they
[1:12:42] call it a watchman
[1:12:44] on the watch tower brother brown
[1:12:47] preached watchmen what of the night
[1:12:49] good sermon to listen to but that
[1:12:51] watchman is there's one on all four
[1:12:53] corners of the city
[1:12:55] and their job is is to stay up and they
[1:12:59] didn't have binoculars back then but
[1:13:00] they had real good eyesight
[1:13:02] and they were way up here above
[1:13:04] everybody else that sound familiar
[1:13:07] and they had an eagle eye
[1:13:10] and they could watch a long way away
[1:13:12] when they would see maybe a light coming
[1:13:16] then they would see dust hear horses
[1:13:20] they would scream down the army's coming
[1:13:24] the enemy's coming or he had to make
[1:13:26] this is what i like
[1:13:27] he had to make the choice whether that
[1:13:29] was army or a friend or foe because it
[1:13:32] could just be a bunch of your own people
[1:13:33] coming in you don't want to shoot them
[1:13:35] all right so the watchman had a lot to
[1:13:38] do now watch when he seeth the sword
[1:13:40] come upon the land
[1:13:41] he blow the trumpet and warn the people
[1:13:46] when we see a false doctrine when we see
[1:13:48] little things in our lives little things
[1:13:49] that we do
[1:13:51] god sends us a pastor that's why we need
[1:13:53] a pastor we need somebody with some
[1:13:55] leaven on him
[1:13:56] yes that's right that god can speak
[1:13:58] through
[1:14:00] amen listen god spoke to a prophet
[1:14:04] no doubt but you can't take out there we
[1:14:07] go back to the bible we can't take out
[1:14:08] ephesians
[1:14:10] and we can't take out the two loaves
[1:14:13] which is christ in the bride
[1:14:16] all right you can't take that that god's
[1:14:17] not gonna use and look you can't take
[1:14:18] this right here away either
[1:14:21] then whosoever watch this now now look
[1:14:24] the watchman's job is to warn the people
[1:14:29] now it's the people's job to listen or
[1:14:32] not
[1:14:33] right everybody got that yeah
[1:14:36] then whosoever people in the city
[1:14:39] you know you got you got them standing
[1:14:41] outside you know and they're talking
[1:14:42] and they're of course social distancing
[1:14:45] and they're
[1:14:46] they're talking about work and they're
[1:14:47] talking about this and they're talking
[1:14:49] about that and
[1:14:50] and then all of a sudden they hear the
[1:14:52] noise
[1:14:54] of a warning to warn you the enemy's
[1:14:57] coming
[1:14:58] that was the watchman's job then
[1:15:00] whosoever heareth the sound of the
[1:15:02] trumpet
[1:15:03] and taketh not warning oh that's just
[1:15:06] old brother dale up there he's just
[1:15:08] blowing that trumpet again
[1:15:10] yeah just keep blowing the simul trumpet
[1:15:14] preach the same thing over and over
[1:15:16] again
[1:15:18] brother bob up there why he's up there
[1:15:19] meddling all the time and brother louise
[1:15:22] brother oh they're just now look
[1:15:25] if the sword come our false word
[1:15:30] come and take him away
[1:15:34] his blood shall be upon his own head
[1:15:39] but
[1:15:42] he heard the sound of the trumpet and
[1:15:44] took no warning
[1:15:46] his blood shall be upon him
[1:15:49] but he that taketh warning
[1:15:52] shall deliver his soul amen
[1:15:56] but if the watchmen
[1:15:59] see the false doctrine come or see the
[1:16:02] sword come or the enemy come
[1:16:05] and blow not the trumpet oh i think that
[1:16:08] that's just a very small army i think
[1:16:10] they'll just
[1:16:11] you know they'll just they're going to
[1:16:12] turn in another direction there
[1:16:14] this old fox doctrine about this thing
[1:16:16] and another this thing and another i
[1:16:17] don't worry about it no it's
[1:16:19] it's an enemy it's an enemy but if the
[1:16:22] watchmen
[1:16:23] see the sword come and blow not the
[1:16:26] trumpet
[1:16:28] and the people be not warned if the
[1:16:31] sword come and take
[1:16:33] any person from among them he is taken
[1:16:36] away in his iniquity
[1:16:38] but his blood will i require at the
[1:16:40] watchman's hand
[1:16:43] easy i'm telling you folks everybody
[1:16:45] wants to be a pastor
[1:16:50] come on that's right you read that
[1:16:53] right it's required
[1:16:58] what i've always said people bicker
[1:16:59] number one they're not here
[1:17:01] but people bicker about the pastor
[1:17:03] taking tithe
[1:17:04] listen excuse me the bible tells us
[1:17:08] to pay our tithe you got the monkey off
[1:17:11] your back
[1:17:13] when you pay your tithes you've done
[1:17:14] what the bible says god will bless you
[1:17:17] you will have not have to stand before
[1:17:19] the lord and say i didn't pay my tithe
[1:17:21] you pay your tithe
[1:17:22] now what abc what what a does with it
[1:17:28] pastor whoever does with it he's got to
[1:17:31] talk to god about it
[1:17:32] right so it's not your job to bicker
[1:17:35] what he's doing with it
[1:17:38] it's not you've done your job
[1:17:42] when you do your job you leave it alone
[1:17:45] that's right
[1:17:46] because you start bickering it's going
[1:17:47] to come back on you
[1:17:50] amen but look that's why we need to if
[1:17:53] the watchmen see the sword come and blow
[1:17:55] not the trumpet so see how important
[1:17:57] the blowing of a trumpet is or the
[1:17:59] sounding of a message is
[1:18:00] and a sounding of the correct message
[1:18:03] now see dwight moody was good
[1:18:06] brother brown said he took millions of
[1:18:07] souls into heaven
[1:18:10] okay but they're all dead now
[1:18:13] laying in the grave waiting the prophet
[1:18:16] of god now he comes up and he blows his
[1:18:19] trumpet
[1:18:20] now he's one of the seven stars he's not
[1:18:22] just a trumpet blower
[1:18:24] he's not second chair and third chair if
[1:18:27] brother paul was here and
[1:18:28] looks like he left it he must be coming
[1:18:29] back
[1:18:31] he left his horn and his and his flute
[1:18:34] here
[1:18:34] so amen what a sign
[1:18:38] anyway so if but if he's sitting here
[1:18:40] though and
[1:18:42] excuse me goodness and uh
[1:18:52] he hears a sound that's not familiar
[1:18:57] listen if you hear a sound that's not
[1:18:58] familiar don't immediately cut it off
[1:19:03] but you gotta test it with your with
[1:19:05] your spiritual
[1:19:06] angel the one that was given to guide
[1:19:07] you the one your holy ghost
[1:19:11] because sometimes you may hear something
[1:19:14] but then a long time after that you see
[1:19:18] it come to fruition
[1:19:21] we listen we're instant people
[1:19:24] we like instant gratification instant
[1:19:26] answers we like instant this and we like
[1:19:28] instant that everything's instant we got
[1:19:29] to have it today we got to have it today
[1:19:32] but remember from the feast of pentecost
[1:19:35] to the feast of trumpets
[1:19:36] there's several months in there there's
[1:19:38] a period of time
[1:19:40] that god is allowing us to go through
[1:19:42] things and to hear
[1:19:44] you know dwight moody we hear we we say
[1:19:47] okay that's great
[1:19:49] but god moved to another page of music
[1:19:52] okay he moved he brought the concert up
[1:19:54] and
[1:19:55] if brother paul was sitting second chair
[1:19:57] and third chair
[1:19:58] well see that means you're sorry your
[1:20:00] second best and third best
[1:20:03] but when you set first chair you're the
[1:20:06] best of the best
[1:20:07] so brother branham set first chair
[1:20:11] remember the conductors of jesus christ
[1:20:14] but brother branham said first chair
[1:20:16] because he knew exactly
[1:20:18] what that conductor wanted done
[1:20:21] so he played first chair the
[1:20:24] the sound that we should hear
[1:20:27] you say well you just said he made
[1:20:29] mistakes he made human mistakes
[1:20:31] but folks when it comes to doctrine he
[1:20:33] cannot make a mistake
[1:20:35] that's right no way could he make a
[1:20:37] mistake because then god
[1:20:38] couldn't require us to come to full
[1:20:41] adoption
[1:20:42] if we only had peace or we had something
[1:20:44] missing sometimes we don't know what we
[1:20:47] have
[1:20:48] we have the pure unadulterated word just
[1:20:51] like jesus christ
[1:20:52] standing on the earth two thousand years
[1:20:54] ago in human flesh
[1:20:56] and him speaking to the disciples we
[1:20:59] have that same message
[1:21:02] and if jesus was wrong we're all wrong
[1:21:05] yeah
[1:21:05] and when we go to judgment we can say
[1:21:07] you were wrong
[1:21:09] and he can't judge us but if we were
[1:21:11] chosen in him brother dale's been
[1:21:14] preaching we've chosen in him
[1:21:16] jesus christ has been judged the
[1:21:18] righteous one
[1:21:20] the true conductor the true trumpet
[1:21:22] sounder the true watchman
[1:21:25] now he has delivered now watch this
[1:21:27] though he has delivered though
[1:21:30] bible he has delivered that message but
[1:21:32] some pick it up and go
[1:21:34] well i think he's three now that's not
[1:21:37] jesus christ sounding
[1:21:39] the trumpet man has come in and added a
[1:21:42] note
[1:21:43] yes so if you add a note
[1:21:47] i don't know much about music but if you
[1:21:49] add a note
[1:21:50] though and the note's not added to the
[1:21:52] whole
[1:21:53] everybody else playing flute and trumpet
[1:21:55] and all these other or
[1:21:56] all the other things and you've got one
[1:21:58] note missing or you've got one note
[1:22:00] added what does it do
[1:22:02] it ain't right it messes everything up
[1:22:06] so what we've got in this day folks is
[1:22:08] we've not got just a hit and miss
[1:22:11] we've not got just a second chair or
[1:22:13] somebody that might miss a note every
[1:22:14] once in a while
[1:22:16] we have a star in the hand of him
[1:22:21] in revelations one of those seven stars
[1:22:24] was the spirit that was
[1:22:26] with william branham in william branham
[1:22:28] and telling us what god's mind
[1:22:31] is how can somebody say let's go back in
[1:22:33] the back part of god's mind
[1:22:35] when he can't go in all in the whole and
[1:22:37] get it 100 right
[1:22:39] right he'll say let's go back into peace
[1:22:43] sure the back part is a piece but that's
[1:22:45] your thinking that's your intelligence
[1:22:47] but if the watchmen see the sword come
[1:22:49] and blow not the trumpet and the people
[1:22:50] be not warned
[1:22:52] and if the sword come and take any
[1:22:54] person from among them he is taken away
[1:22:56] in his iniquity but his blood will i
[1:22:58] require
[1:23:01] at the watchman's hand and then we'll
[1:23:03] read a little bit more but now
[1:23:05] they don't you don't have this so i'm
[1:23:07] going to read it real slow
[1:23:09] excuse me got some congestion today
[1:23:11] forgive me
[1:23:13] this comes from um the internet
[1:23:17] sorry but i was looking at it because
[1:23:20] sometimes you
[1:23:21] you know the lord just says we're gonna
[1:23:22] have one day of blowing the trumpets and
[1:23:24] then
[1:23:26] that's all it says but you have to get
[1:23:29] the history behind it
[1:23:30] and the jews have the history behind it
[1:23:32] of what they god wanted them to do
[1:23:34] because this has been repetition for
[1:23:36] them
[1:23:37] for listen to this jesus has
[1:23:40] been gone 2 000 years right
[1:23:43] moses was 2000 years before
[1:23:48] so for four thousand years the jews have
[1:23:52] been going through this
[1:23:54] so they must have something right we
[1:23:57] know they're going through it in symbol
[1:23:58] form
[1:23:59] but man you wait a little 144 000
[1:24:01] realize
[1:24:02] that they've been going through that for
[1:24:04] 4 000 years and then them two witnesses
[1:24:07] go
[1:24:08] there's jesus christ the passover there
[1:24:10] he was laying in the tomb as unleavened
[1:24:12] bread
[1:24:13] there he was the first one out of the
[1:24:14] out of the
[1:24:16] grave as a first fruit and on the day of
[1:24:19] pentecost
[1:24:20] remember in your history jews remember
[1:24:23] in your history
[1:24:25] something happened on that day of
[1:24:27] pentecost in 80 30.
[1:24:30] something happened because uh it was
[1:24:33] noise abroad
[1:24:34] that something happened now y'all might
[1:24:36] have shot it down
[1:24:37] and but now see remember in 1870
[1:24:40] god promised he's going to destroy it
[1:24:42] all so he just dispersed them everywhere
[1:24:45] but listen to this what is the feast of
[1:24:48] trumpets i'm going to read this from
[1:24:51] gotquestions.org but i really like it
[1:24:56] because remember this is
[1:24:59] as we said before listen to me their
[1:25:02] religious calendar
[1:25:03] started on nissan or abim or
[1:25:06] march april everybody got that say amen
[1:25:08] amen all right that's their religious
[1:25:10] calendar that's the one god told them to
[1:25:11] go by
[1:25:12] right because he said to moses this will
[1:25:15] be the first day of the month for you
[1:25:17] which will be the passover so they
[1:25:19] that's their yearly calendar
[1:25:22] for religious services
[1:25:26] are religious feast but their civil
[1:25:28] calendar what they go by now their civil
[1:25:31] calendar starts in october
[1:25:32] which is what we're talking about now
[1:25:34] we're talking about uh
[1:25:36] sivan or i can't remember the name of it
[1:25:38] but we'll get back to it in a minute but
[1:25:39] listen
[1:25:40] to this the feast of trumpets
[1:25:43] marked the beginning of 10 days of
[1:25:45] consecration
[1:25:47] and repentance before god
[1:25:50] so it really doesn't tell that in the
[1:25:51] bible but it does you read between the
[1:25:54] lines if you'll bring that chart back up
[1:25:56] brother joe
[1:25:59] excuse me goodness i picked up a frog
[1:26:02] somewhere
[1:26:05] that's no covet frog hush
[1:26:09] so you got right here which is
[1:26:12] tishri 1 all right
[1:26:16] so now we're here at tishri 1. now from
[1:26:18] history 1 to 10
[1:26:20] the bible tells us on the tenth day
[1:26:22] there should be day of atonement
[1:26:24] but watch what they do in between there
[1:26:26] now watch what this now you and i
[1:26:28] you and i come through this we heard
[1:26:32] a trumpet sound
[1:26:35] something's going to happen because see
[1:26:37] there was a long time in here
[1:26:39] but a trumpet has sounded an alarm
[1:26:44] right right because there's three more
[1:26:46] feasts that's got to be done
[1:26:47] in the year everybody got that
[1:26:50] and these are happening boom boom boom
[1:26:52] you know pretty close together
[1:26:53] long period time and then boom boom boom
[1:26:55] that's why i say now
[1:26:56] you say well brother wait we've heard
[1:26:58] the trumpet if brother brown's message
[1:26:59] of the trumpet
[1:27:00] i'm talking about the 100
[1:27:03] the number one chair trumpet
[1:27:07] believe that number one chair trumpet
[1:27:08] all right which now is fivefold ministry
[1:27:11] apostles prophets pastors teachers and
[1:27:12] evangelists
[1:27:13] if we stay as brother brown said if we
[1:27:15] stay under that star
[1:27:19] right under her messenger she'll be the
[1:27:20] final voice of the final age under her
[1:27:22] messenger under her star
[1:27:25] because see he's he's the star star of
[1:27:28] the show
[1:27:30] all right we know jesus christ is the
[1:27:31] star but he sent
[1:27:33] a message because he had seven stars in
[1:27:36] his hand
[1:27:37] we got a picture of it back there seven
[1:27:38] stars in his hand and those people
[1:27:41] if you get it you're gonna get it from
[1:27:42] them seven right amen
[1:27:44] but now remember i want to ask you a
[1:27:47] question here for those of you that
[1:27:50] that that believe that we need to just
[1:27:52] listen to tapes
[1:27:54] i got a question for you columbo was the
[1:27:58] messenger to the fourth church age
[1:28:00] correct according to brother branham say
[1:28:02] what's on tape
[1:28:05] columba wasn't even in his church age
[1:28:08] that's right
[1:28:09] he died before his church age began
[1:28:13] he was actually in martin's church age
[1:28:18] but columbus message now how can a dead
[1:28:20] man preach
[1:28:26] because listen luther was here
[1:28:29] luther never had a denominational bone
[1:28:32] in his body
[1:28:33] he brought the pure unadulterated word
[1:28:35] for the time one of the seven stars that
[1:28:37] god depended on
[1:28:39] to bring the message but when he died
[1:28:43] some carried on the truth some carried
[1:28:46] it to denomination
[1:28:49] columba he must have preached
[1:28:53] we know brother trevor had went over
[1:28:55] there and i liked the little snippets
[1:28:56] that he
[1:28:57] that he sent back to us about how
[1:29:00] that columba was a messenger of
[1:29:04] he had light around him the whole time
[1:29:05] there was light everywhere he was at
[1:29:07] there was all kinds of lights and
[1:29:08] different things
[1:29:10] but remember if he died before his
[1:29:12] church age began
[1:29:13] his people he was a star
[1:29:18] he died well then who took them through
[1:29:22] 1500 years of dark ages
[1:29:24] the preachers the ministers that caught
[1:29:28] the message of columba
[1:29:30] caught that message and didn't even have
[1:29:32] a tape recorder
[1:29:33] or books to put it on it was by memory
[1:29:37] but god
[1:29:38] by the holy ghost give them enough
[1:29:40] memory to remember
[1:29:42] what columbus said and they carried
[1:29:47] 1500 years
[1:29:51] by the preaching of columba and him not
[1:29:53] even being in the church age
[1:29:55] so if you want to listen to tapes all
[1:29:57] your life that's fine with me i you know
[1:29:58] i
[1:29:59] just like i said i ain't here to fight
[1:30:00] about that i didn't hear that trumpet
[1:30:02] sound
[1:30:03] right amen amen i didn't hear that
[1:30:05] trumpet the trumpet i heard was
[1:30:07] was from a fivefold ministry that was
[1:30:10] sounding the true watchman that was
[1:30:12] sounding
[1:30:14] the truth that was coming whether it be
[1:30:16] enemy or whether it be friend
[1:30:18] friend or foe all right that's why i
[1:30:21] said we need to align ourselves with the
[1:30:23] truth
[1:30:25] amen so but watch this but so
[1:30:28] the feast of trumpets so they went
[1:30:29] through this okay let's say we're now

[1:32:08] and going through the message of the
[1:32:10] hour but i believe that you
[1:32:12] and i now have come to
[1:32:15] the feast of trumpets amen because watch
[1:32:18] it's beginning of 10 days of
[1:32:20] consecration and repentance before god
[1:32:23] it is one of seven jewish feasts or
[1:32:25] festivals appointed by the lord
[1:32:28] and one of three feasts that occur in
[1:32:30] the autumn now we know that just leave
[1:32:31] that chart up there
[1:32:34] its name the feast of trumpets began on
[1:32:37] the first day
[1:32:38] at the new moon of the seventh month its
[1:32:41] name comes from the command to blow
[1:32:43] trumpets in leviticus 23 24
[1:32:46] and numbers 29 1-6 it is also called
[1:32:49] rosh hashanah which means
[1:32:52] head of the year which now that becomes
[1:32:55] their civil calendar
[1:32:56] that the civilization runs off this is
[1:32:58] their first day of the year
[1:33:00] and they go this way all right everybody
[1:33:02] got that
[1:33:03] because it marks the beginning of the
[1:33:04] jewish civil calendar
[1:33:07] during this celebration no kind of work
[1:33:09] was to be performed
[1:33:11] but burnt offerings and a sin offering
[1:33:12] were to be brought before the lord
[1:33:15] in the leviticus passage the word
[1:33:17] trumpet blast
[1:33:19] are a translation of the hebrew root
[1:33:22] hebrew root were a word teruah
[1:33:26] that's what that says yam yam teruah
[1:33:31] which means listen to this a shout
[1:33:36] are blowing a shout out
[1:33:39] the shout the voice the trump
[1:33:42] amen the lord himself shall descend from
[1:33:45] heaven with a
[1:33:46] huh shout he said brother what about
[1:33:49] right brother that was back in 1963. it
[1:33:51] was to brother brennaman 1963.
[1:33:54] but was it to you you got to have your
[1:33:56] own
[1:33:57] that's right trumpet sound your own
[1:34:01] shout your own
[1:34:04] voice to come to a place because watch
[1:34:09] it appears that the shofar or ram's horn
[1:34:12] was to be blown at this time
[1:34:14] as it was on the other new moons that's
[1:34:16] in psalms 81
[1:34:17] 3. i'll see if we can post this next
[1:34:19] sunday
[1:34:21] afternoon or yeah sunday afternoon
[1:34:23] brother will be here wednesday jewish
[1:34:24] tradition
[1:34:25] indicates that both the ram's horn and
[1:34:27] the priestly silverhorn
[1:34:29] the hazazaria
[1:34:32] zera hazaria were used in the feast of
[1:34:35] trumpets
[1:34:36] the feast of trumpets listen to this was
[1:34:38] important for several reasons
[1:34:40] first it commemorated the end of the
[1:34:43] agriculture
[1:34:44] and festival year because see that's the
[1:34:48] last month
[1:34:49] that's not the last day there's a
[1:34:50] there's a feast there's three more
[1:34:52] but they happen boom boom boom just like
[1:34:54] this happen boom boom boom
[1:34:56] right so they know that listen remember
[1:34:59] we're natural israel
[1:35:01] we come to this day and the whole city
[1:35:03] is nothing but blowing trumpets you
[1:35:04] don't do anything
[1:35:05] you just grab your trumpet and you go to
[1:35:07] blowing your trumpet well that's in the
[1:35:09] natural but they know that 10 days later
[1:35:11] they've all got to go into their house
[1:35:13] and be sorrowful for one day
[1:35:15] that's what the atonement's for then
[1:35:18] they get happy again a few days later
[1:35:21] because they got to go get in their
[1:35:22] little booth and they make their little
[1:35:24] flowery things and we'll get into that a
[1:35:25] little bit later and i'll show you some
[1:35:26] pictures of it
[1:35:29] a little bit later first it commemorates
[1:35:32] the end of the agriculture and festival
[1:35:34] year
[1:35:34] the lord himself shall descend from
[1:35:36] heaven with a shout a voice
[1:35:38] a trumpet when the trumpet of god shall
[1:35:40] sound
[1:35:41] time shall be the mourn all these
[1:35:42] different things when the voice voice
[1:35:44] trumpet
[1:35:45] see we've been through this message for
[1:35:47] all these years we've got the baptism of
[1:35:49] the holy ghost
[1:35:49] we've been through all this but there's
[1:35:51] going to be one time that you and i are
[1:35:53] going to hear
[1:35:54] a shout that's it it's not the shout to
[1:35:57] get in the message
[1:35:59] come on all right it's the shout to get
[1:36:02] out of here
[1:36:03] because this is the last push this is
[1:36:07] the last
[1:36:08] harvest there'll be no more gentile
[1:36:10] harvest after this right here
[1:36:13] amen now sure there'll be tires i'm
[1:36:15] talking about wheat
[1:36:16] but now remember wheat got harvested
[1:36:19] here
[1:36:21] what gets harvested here fruit
[1:36:25] that's right fruit gets harvested
[1:36:29] oh we'll get into that it's really good
[1:36:33] because i am the vine
[1:36:37] here are the branches where's the fruits
[1:36:39] fruit on the vine nope fruit's on
[1:36:40] branches
[1:36:41] amen so he's and what's he gonna do he's
[1:36:44] gonna harvest your fruit
[1:36:46] we'll get into that it's really good all
[1:36:48] right now look
[1:36:49] also the day of atonement fell on the
[1:36:51] tenth day of this month
[1:36:53] and the festival festival of booths
[1:36:57] begins on the 15th day the blowing of
[1:37:00] the trumpets on the first day of the
[1:37:01] month
[1:37:02] heralded a solemn time of preparation
[1:37:06] for the day of atonement
[1:37:11] so that was the beginning it was just a
[1:37:13] one day blowing of the trumpet but you
[1:37:15] realized
[1:37:16] something's fixing to happen amen
[1:37:19] the blowing of the trumpets on the first
[1:37:21] day of the month heralded a solemn time
[1:37:24] of preparation for the day of atonement
[1:37:28] this preparation time was called
[1:37:31] the ten days of repentance are the days
[1:37:34] of all
[1:37:34] awe the trumpet sound was an alarm
[1:37:40] of sorts and can be understood as a call
[1:37:44] to introspection and repentance
[1:37:48] so we've been through this long church
[1:37:50] age we've been through this long
[1:37:52] time of being in the message the
[1:37:55] prophet's been gone for
[1:37:57] 60 years almost
[1:38:02] we've heard trumpet right we've heard
[1:38:05] the gospel trumpet
[1:38:07] but remember when you get over there in
[1:38:08] them other trumpets when the trumpet of
[1:38:10] the lord shall sound and the time shall
[1:38:11] be no more and all these different
[1:38:13] things
[1:38:14] that's different right not a different
[1:38:16] horn
[1:38:18] but he's not blowing it through the one
[1:38:20] guy anymore
[1:38:22] he's blowing it through the people amen
[1:38:25] because
[1:38:26] maybe we can find that but lord what a
[1:38:28] noise
[1:38:30] well now one person can't make a lot of
[1:38:31] noise you put one guy in the middle of
[1:38:33] two million people or 10 million people
[1:38:35] in
[1:38:35] in the city of israel and he blows some
[1:38:37] little like a little flute like this
[1:38:38] right here
[1:38:39] who's going to hear yeah no but when the
[1:38:42] people
[1:38:44] when the people pick up the message
[1:38:48] and they begin to blow a trumpet they
[1:38:51] begin to proclaim liberty
[1:38:52] remember a trumpet had to sound to
[1:38:54] proclaim liberty
[1:38:56] in that 50th or jubilee year
[1:39:00] amen
[1:39:04] the feast of trumpets along with the
[1:39:05] other six festivals of the lord
[1:39:07] foreshadowed certain aspects
[1:39:09] of the ministry of jesus christ the
[1:39:11] prophets linked the blowing of trumpets
[1:39:13] to the future day of judgment
[1:39:16] and i read this one but i didn't bring
[1:39:17] it blow the trumpet in zion
[1:39:19] now who are we we're the dollars of zion
[1:39:21] we're going design
[1:39:22] sound the alarm on my holy hill
[1:39:27] let all who live in the land tremble for
[1:39:29] the day of the lord is coming it is
[1:39:31] close
[1:39:32] at hand that is joel 2 1 and also
[1:39:35] zephaniah 1 14-16
[1:39:39] in the new testament we see that the
[1:39:40] lord's second coming will be accompanied
[1:39:43] by the sound of a trumpet amen amen we
[1:39:46] know that
[1:39:48] first corinthians 15 51-52 and first
[1:39:50] thessalonians 4
[1:39:52] 16-17 and we'll read that next sunday to
[1:39:56] begin right there at the feast of
[1:39:57] trumpets and go to the feast of
[1:39:58] atonement
[1:39:59] but listen to this because we'll read
[1:40:01] these you can't do
[1:40:02] you can't rule out revelations eight
[1:40:04] through nine each of the judgments in
[1:40:05] revelations eight through nine
[1:40:07] is signaled by a trumpet it's going to
[1:40:10] take two witnesses to go over there
[1:40:13] right and sound a trumpet
[1:40:18] to release the seven trumpets that's
[1:40:21] right amen
[1:40:22] we'll get into that but now look
[1:40:26] you got to remember something the feast
[1:40:29] of trumpets
[1:40:31] is different from the seven trumpets but
[1:40:33] there has to be a blowing
[1:40:34] of the trumpet to me and you first
[1:40:39] before it can go and be a natural seven
[1:40:41] trumpet judgment
[1:40:43] to the world through the two witnesses
[1:40:45] everybody got that
[1:40:46] that's why brother branham wanted to
[1:40:48] preach the trumpets preach the seven
[1:40:50] trumpets preach the seven trumpets
[1:40:52] preach the seven vials remember he was
[1:40:54] pushing he was trying to get a building
[1:40:55] he was trying to do that
[1:40:57] and then god told him finally told him
[1:40:59] he said god finally told me the other
[1:41:00] day he said i went into the room
[1:41:02] and said god why he said they're not to
[1:41:05] you
[1:41:07] they're not to the gentiles remember
[1:41:09] he's a gentile prophet
[1:41:11] he said they're not to you he said there
[1:41:13] to the jews and you've already preached
[1:41:14] them
[1:41:16] supernaturally
[1:41:18] in the sixth seal that's right
[1:41:22] wow he'd already preached him he didn't
[1:41:23] even know it he was a prophet
[1:41:26] ah he learned just like you and i learn
[1:41:29] but when it hit him look at the then he
[1:41:32] goes and preaches the feast of the
[1:41:34] trumpets
[1:41:35] and he brings the feast of the trumpets
[1:41:37] in talking about the lord coming
[1:41:40] the day of atonement so will the trump
[1:41:42] of god call us to heaven and warn the
[1:41:44] world
[1:41:46] of coming judgment so brother brown
[1:41:48] preaches feast of the trumpets he said i
[1:41:50] wondered
[1:41:51] all my time why them seven the seven
[1:41:54] trumpeters are not to us
[1:41:56] because they're plagues and they're to
[1:41:58] israel
[1:41:59] but the feast of the trumpet is what hey
[1:42:03] that's right get ready amen
[1:42:07] you're coming to a place to realize
[1:42:09] where you are
[1:42:10] yeah and what you're doing here that's
[1:42:14] the feast of atonement
[1:42:15] to make israel realize that there was a
[1:42:18] lamb way back over here to us
[1:42:20] 2 000 years ago to them several months
[1:42:24] ago
[1:42:24] that they remember that that priest put
[1:42:26] that lamb on the altar
[1:42:28] slit his throat the very next day
[1:42:31] they went through and cleaned all the
[1:42:32] leaven out of their house
[1:42:34] eat unleavened bread for seven days
[1:42:37] then they started into a barley harvest
[1:42:39] and they had to bring a first fruit into
[1:42:41] the priest
[1:42:42] priests had to wave it before they could
[1:42:43] eat come up to the day of pentecost
[1:42:46] which
[1:42:46] meant to them it's another festival
[1:42:48] something to eat because they're
[1:42:50] wheat harvesting see that's all natural
[1:42:54] then like i said you got all this time
[1:42:55] that really nothing's going on and then
[1:42:56] all of a sudden
[1:42:58] god says hey wake up
[1:43:01] amen got a little work to do
[1:43:04] because i'm gonna make you realize as a
[1:43:06] human being god
[1:43:08] helps us to realize what he's done for
[1:43:11] us
[1:43:14] we come to that day of atonement
[1:43:17] listen jesus christ don't have to get it
[1:43:18] back on the cross again that's right
[1:43:20] we just got to realize that he did get
[1:43:22] on the cross and that he died for me
[1:43:26] then what's going to happen here that's
[1:43:28] going to move out to the feast of
[1:43:30] tabernacles
[1:43:31] where there is a joy because this is the
[1:43:35] final harvest
[1:43:36] god's going to finally harvest all of
[1:43:39] his
[1:43:39] fruit and the fruit of my labor and your
[1:43:42] labor and everybody else's labor brother
[1:43:44] dale's labor the fruit of the labor
