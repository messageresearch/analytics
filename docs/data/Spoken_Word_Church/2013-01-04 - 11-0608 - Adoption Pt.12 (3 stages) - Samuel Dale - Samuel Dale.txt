the things and all and all of the Brethren are invited to come and be with us and just have a good time okay now I think that's all I'm supposed to cover so go to Ephesians 1 and then Matthew 17. a precious Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the day and hour and the time that we can have thank you for Lord just being you and revealing yourself unto us that we truly can find out who our father really is as the prophet said there Lord one day he said I found out I wouldn't have sent a Charleston Ella Branham he wouldn't deny his natural parents but he found out who his real father is and Lord we're beginning to realize that and realization so we ask you to just help us and give us understanding as we read your words you come and speak to our hearts and lead each one room or the sick among us you've said in your word you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we depend upon it we believe you and we thank you for all the promises forgive our sins cover us Lord by your blood may you know that we need to be Sanctified to where that we would just be totally set aside for everything in you guide each and every one of us now in Jesus name amen amen Ephesians 1 this is about 12 times reading this you ought to know these scriptures by now Ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he had chosen Us in him were before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having what predestinated us were unto adoption the honest unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved now let's go back to Matthew's where everybody goes and we're in the adoption trying to bring it in three stages and now we're up to the second stage of adoption which more or less covers the coming to the Mount of transfiguration the experience of the Lord Jesus okay Matthew 17 1 and after six days Jesus taketh Peter James and John his brother and bringeth them up into a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them in his face did shine as the sun in his Reign but was white as the light and behold our appeared unto him Moses and Elias talking with him then answered Peter and said unto Jesus Lord it is good for us to be here if thou Wilt let us make your three Tabernacles one for thee one for Moses and one for life while he spake Behold a bright Cloud overshadowed them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased hear ye him you may be seated the Lord had his blessings to the reading of the word as I said we we've been talking about adoption and we we pretty well tried to cover not enough but we covered most of the you know the thoughts that we would want to on that how that you and I are adopted into the family of God by the new birth now I know your adoption goes on to you know and that's the point we're dealing with is Romans 8. where it says that the whole world is groaning waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God all right and that's in this day and we covered in the life's message of expecting the same Ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ to be here the prophet said to bring back The Headstone to the church because the head has never United with the body in this in this part that is to be now on the death Pentecost the head came as the Cornerstone but it couldn't manifest itself as a headstone it has to wait till the last days to do that the prophet said in the church back there he said it was the Cornerstone he said in the full Church it's The Headstone so we're expecting The Headstone to come and I told you a lot of people say oh when I got the new birth I got The Headstone well I don't I don't agree with that because the disciples when they got the new bird they didn't even get the headstone so we've been over these things you know and trying to bring them out to to show you but we've been dealing with coming up to the bases to where like the prophet said you know that when you're born again as a Christian God gives you a checkbook all right and down at the bottom of that checkbook is you know how you sign it the sign Jesus Christ and whatever you have need of you just fill in what it is you need healing you need salvation you need help you need you know whatever you need for life you just fill in what you have need of course you're already signed we said then there would be a day come like in the natural adoption to where that the father would adopt his own child into the family and he said then he would give you the checkbook but said there wouldn't be nothing signed because that way you could fill out what you wanted and then you sign your own name because your name would be just as good as the father on the checkbook if you're really adopted into the family you know correctly all right and that's the stages where we're dealing with and we tried to cover how that in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ that see he had a river Jordan experience and in that experience it says this is my beloved Son you know and whom I'm pleased to dwell all right now he did not need the new birth but he done that as an example for you and I that's right all right see then we have a new birth experience and and the Lord saying I'm pleased to dwell in you that's when you're a newborn baby yeah baby in Christ all right and all people are born again as newborn babies all except 120 it was in the upper room they were born to the place called the faith of the father but three thousand sold just a few hours later or something they started off as babies and that's where the problem is is babies trying to understand God's word they already get it you know they know how to do everything and they know how to you know how you kids are you know you kids now you think you know a whole lot more in your parents you know you're you're just smart as all get out will you wait if time went on you got to be about 30 40 years old you'd find out that you didn't know too much when you was about 15 16. you you you'd find that out you'd find out people didn't give a who what you thought you know you're really wanting to try to run the world you can't do it right but anyhow you don't know what we're talking about see and I said we're coming up to then the word that the Lord Jesus said he had a river Jordan experience then he had him out of transfiguration experience all right now the Transfiguration experience that says this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him amen all right now that was on about probably uh so we're give just a number six months before Calvary because the prophet said he left right there went straight to Calvary to to be crucified you know and all of that so he went through that and that's what the world was waiting on was to see him all right then we see that we received the new bird to bring us into the body of Christ making us the children of God and then the adoption the tutoring he gives us the tutor and we've seen that you know the tutor is not in the natural the tutor is somebody you are you know you hire a person to tutor your job but in the the Christian experience it's the holy spirit amen and the Holy Spirit is the spirit of the father or else you got two Spirits all right you're all messed up see so it's the Holy Spirit coming to dwell in us which is the spirit of the father to give us his nature so he's inside of us tutoring us right amen sure he's using a five-fold Ministry he's using other people to help and things like that but the main thing is the inside teacher you know and doing that and like I've tried to bring out to you the way I think a lot of people talk about adoption is that the father's leaving the scene you know going off and the sun's coming on that's really making us something I don't agree with that I don't believe it that way that's right I believe adoption is when the father is coming on to scene in the sun right because with that what happened to Jesus right right Second Corinthians 5 and 19 said God was in Christ reconcile in the world into himself amen see that's what happened to to Jesus see he and the father became one I gave you a lot of the things I didn't give back to you tonight but right around said in body he was a man in Soul he was God Amen all right he'd say that in in uh body he was a man and he said in spirit he was God he said that's a mystery but said it's true because that way we're not going into a trinity neither are we going into a Oneness right see we're holding it in the correct order because God was in Christ what happened right when that baby was born that baby that body was a body that was a creation by the word Hebrews 10 5. but see the soul in the spirit was the almighty God Amen that's what the Bible would say that you know he was born Lord to Christ amen see then in doing that then he didn't have to become God as people say on the River Jordan he was born God Amen because God was in that flesh amen you see everybody else wants to make it some kind of a something that comes down on that flesh no no it was God in that you know it's simply to me what one God is amen amen that there he was a body that he created stepped into what Soul and Spirit was almighty God right and the prophet of God said that that Spirit on a tape called faith 1961 he said that that Spirit was the spirit that spoke in this hundred times All right that's right it was the holy spirit amen okay see then when he died there was no problem with him dying the Soul and Spirit just stepped out of the body when the body was dead it stepped out of your body your soul your spirit steps after your teeth but there's no problem with understanding but the thing to get where we're at see the Lord Jesus was identified on the River Jordan this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell when you receive that new birth as it said a moment ago God says I'm pleased to dwell in you right amen I know I know what people are saying that you know I don't know about that maybe maybe no no if you have the new birth he's pleased to dwell in amen all right get it straight and run and run it the way it's supposed to be right amen he must be pleased to dwell in he dwelling in you if he wasn't pleased he wouldn't be that all right amen but see then that being as we'd say the River Jordan where it said this is my beloved Son of a woman pleased to dwell but now we're coming to hear ye him the coming to a place that we're like the Lord Jesus had reached a position that full Authority rested dark all right all right now and that man was full Authority because if you're going to get anything you're going to have to go from there okay now Mark's my point because I'm trying to get something to you tonight to to just you know help us to see where we're at all right all right now then after his amount of Transfiguration experience me it wasn't a lot said you go straight to Calvary on his way there he preaches six seals in Matthew 24. right amen all right he didn't preach that until after the anointing came on him on Mineral Transfiguration amen that's right he didn't preach that in his early Ministry he preached that there window when he had been adopted in other words amen all right now then if that be true why can't we parallel exactly oh me and to see that in the end time when brother Branham came to his place then he breaks six Fields all right he met the angels of the Lord taken up into the cloud and he says they didn't tell him anything back there he said they told him to come back and it would be told him and I was like told you he said I don't know what the first seal is well but if he did he was a liar right you know but you know people don't like for you to be that positive they want you to be flexible well I'm sorry I'm just like I am you know I just just sit on that basis to I believe it I believe and if you'll get it tonight you'll see what I'm talking about I believe the Lord Jesus Christ was adopted man of transfiguration that's right and then he preached the greatest messages he had ever preached right amen now you think about it though after his manner Transfiguration experience so that's where everybody thinks that that when you get an experience of a god-like amount of transfiguration I hear you him that boy you just gonna go out you're going to empty hospitals you're going to just do this you're going to turn the world upside down well it didn't happen with the Lord Jesus right right there were more miracles and signs and wonders in his early Ministry than it was in the last time more in the pot the Apostle Paul in his early Ministry than there was an end right because right around even refers to it and people would say Paul you used to be able to do this but since you looked like you've lost it yeah well see and look at brother random early Ministry great signs and wonders and healings going Every Which Way preaching to five hundred thousand seals break he's preaching the 30. all right right see it looked right reverse to what we think it ought to be well what are we expecting it to be with us then that's right amen I'm using only these as an example to compare brother's Ministry and the Lord Jesus Christ Ministry I said Ministry because I don't believe brother Brown was God right man no but God used the man to bring it if that spirit that was in sundering times in diverse manners was the spirit of Christ right then it was still using in brother Branham and he was not exalt in himself he was exalting God all right now see then in doing that foreign and look at the ministry back there and look at the ministry of brother random right all right and you see it coming right along together see odd birth you know very odd right I'm alive little mini street many preachers for quite a while and then God comes on the scene and the Lord Jesus and in the seals breaks and you know if we bring that the other day then the Commandments people don't they want the Commandments they think that's a bunch of rules it's not it's got the letter form the Bible is God in letter form in it we made it rude right amen we should yeah but it said God shall not kill well don't you think it ought to be right you want to go about be able to go kill and just get better you know not quite we're not supposed to be that way right but follow what I'm doing now let's look at it and see what happened there and see what happened down here with brother Branham but now I'm telling you are you listening those are only an example right for you and I am en well now I'm sitting back there you know I don't know all right remember a few weeks ago when I preached a little message on that people are looking back brother random said or they're looking forward and failing to see what's taking place all right that's the most denominational mix-up that could ever be see you you're looking back are you looking forward no look where we are now tomorrow's not here yet right that's why the Bible says today is the day of salvation amen right all right everything got to be present tense I thought we believed that that was what the word Elohim you know means self-existing but it means present tense right right here now all right see we're not talking about a god of yesterday amen that's a faith Builder Builder you know we look back we compare all right looking that away there's no faith in looking forward right how can there be any faith in looking forward now it can be revealed about the future home it can be where we're going and what we're doing but no I'm talking about the reveal word all right but see if we're to expect in the end time as we read dirt and kept giving the thing Sunday all day there about the ministry of Jesus Christ is to repeat in the bride amen that's right sure we can see it and run around them but where is it in the bride right it's got to be in the bride not just about guards him all right now look what both of those men done all right now I gave you a quote and I want to just just read the quote and then we'll we'll pick the point up uh yep number one on your notes positioned in Christ 1965-22 the morning service is that right waiting God trying to place his church in position to manifest himself getting one that he can work through like this say there's my spirit flowing freely there it is that that I I I I can work through get another one over here and place him I could place him adoption placing manifesting taking him out there and put a ceremony on him visit him with an Angel tell him something okay and he goes on telling about the manifestation of Sons and Daughters of God now what happened in the life of the Lord Jesus Christ and I said you have the experience of the River Jordan right right all right did he goes through life and you'll see every once in a while an angel appearing in things different with him you know in part like he was out in the quickest he got through with the baptism you know the scripture says he went out into the to the uh uh desert you know and was out there for 30 for 40 days without water or food and you can't do that so it proved he had to be God you can't relax without water that long let a lot of food you know or anything else but see then the angels of God visited him and strengthened him all right now angels have always been connected to we'll get back to it in a few minutes now you know I preached a few months ago or I'm trying to look back and check if I could find it but maybe six months ago I don't know exactly we remember when I was preaching how the the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him and they are ministering Spirits we'll get to it in a minute Hebrews 1 14-15 their ministering Spirits administering to the errors of Salvation all right get that in your mind now Angels ministering to the hearts of Salvation so you see Angels ministering to the Lord Jesus right right yes sir you see things happening through his life all right but then one day he goes and meets real Heavenly Angels doesn't he right because he was there with God on Mount Transfiguration he was there with Moses and Elias Angels Messengers right come to tell him something amen that's what we just read now take him out visit him with an angel tell him something all right see then the Lord Jesus went forth from there to preaching throughout the scriptures and then he comes up into Matthew 24 and he's preaching the seals and the things like that right right tonight do you see what I'm talking about the angels are there all the things are there all right what happened with brother random when he was born there was an angel with our Pillar of Fire Etc things happen all through his life an angel would speak to him he met the angel talked with the angels the Angels were related to him all the way through his ministry not after he got away on down all the way through his ministry the angel of God was there with him to tell him the things that you know I'm sure now you know yourself he calls it holy spirit sometimes so we preached on that right but if that's why it says the angel singular of God in campus about those who fear Him it doesn't say angels He said Angel singular because you take all the Angels you bring them together for their job they're doing and what have you got the Holy Spirit right right which is the angel of God that's why all born-again believers have the angel of an Angel right but I believe you have an angel besides just having the holy spirit amen all right but she brought a random Meats with that angel all kind of thing happens to his life but then one day he's told to go to Tucson Arizona because of a dream right right and he met with seven angels huh and when he got there he said the one next to him in other words the seventh angel you're going down reading this in the quote number three see number two he's telling how he's out there and he says that you know concentrate yourself because of the visitation of these angels because they were coming then he goes down into the seal book I gave it to you seven still not uh 50 uh five six through the seal book 324 to 60 1963. he said he took me up to it he looked more to me than any of the rest that one angel will see the seven angel had to do with him all right so now what are we having what are we talking about comparing what happened with the Lord Jesus with what happened we brought around you follow that compassion all kind of things where you can just go and spend days and days and days preaching about the things in comparison of what would was taking place and see that would be then coming out to be the one to where that we had an angel all right now all born again Believers the prophet said has an angel he said he's assigned to you when you're born right because he knows he knows who's going to receive the Holy Ghost right right sure choice not to just say quote the Holy Ghost it's an angel of God all right Hebrews 1 and I said 14 15 says that those angels are what ministering spirits to minister unto the children of God right and we can look back and we can compare brother random the Lord Jesus but what about you and I amen that's right what about you and me well you know or we could just look at and compare things and and talk about what was or one of these days it will be well just remember if there was or was that's not good language I guess it gets a point across but if there was it was the one had to be speaking of the right now right man yeah right all right so we look back and we draw faith from what was behind yep to be able to walk in where we are now okay all right then and only then when we see it present tense can we even think of a future right but you see we want to jump from back there to go over there it doesn't work that way man me we we've got to have something here now all right okay I believe that according to what the prophet is telling us the Lord Jesus was adopted on the Mount of transfiguration that's right amen all right then he went forth and preached the seals I believe brother random was adopted in 1963 when the Angels met him out there right and then he came back and proven it because he came back and preached the seals the same identical comparison as the ministry of Christ now I wrote it like this don't do what you won't do yeah do people say but I believe brother Brown was adopted in his early Ministry what what early when yeah bring me scriptures or anything to compare it he said when he had great signs and wonders what show did the Lord Jesus how signs and wonders before his Mount of transfiguration right right I just got to say that you agreed see you didn't know where I'm going so it'd probably be better not to shake your head in the great women sometimes you know because I I'm going on down the road huh and I know doing that a lot of times you just stop because you you're afraid you know well why are you before are you afraid that's right is it true that brought around his ministry in the Lord Jesus comparison exactly absolutely amen that might run around me and say it may start something right but you said and I wrote it this way so you can do it I'm not going to argue with you about any point I told you brother uh brother up in the Tennessee lost a family because he preached this it wrote around was adopted in 63 when the angel of the Lord come into it and and a family left him because we don't know where he was adopted today well you agree he was adopted well everybody here agreed run around and was adopted now somebody's shaking head someone's saying amen and somebody's just looking so I guess a good stern look means amen this means no so I don't get any of that all right now you get the point right John where the Lord Jesus was adopted and according to the Bible we can read it perfectly where he was called The Prophet said that was his adoption amount of transfiguration amen amen well I think comparison of brother Randy's Ministry see the Angels come to the Lord Jesus Moses and Elias and what were they doing Messengers come to the Lord Jesus they were telling him about his second coming that's right amen Matthew 24 you know I mean Matthew 17 when it comes to that and we're telling him about his second coming right huh well see then when when brother random met the angels of the Lord what was they talking about he said the one with the seventh seal he said that is his coming well it's still compare but it see it ain't gonna it ain't gonna well we are no means have arguing the point of where it just happened where that happened it happened right well if I just don't like your attitude because we don't know where to happen well you don't either you just said it but when I argue the point I'm comparing it but after all that said and done if you was right and I was wrong and I was right and you were the wrong word that make anything right come on the only way that we know what happened to brother random and to happen to the Lord Jesus is it's got to happen to you and I right amen now if it don't we don't know whether that be true or not we're looking back right and to remember that's three unclean spirits like frogs because frogs look what backward all right they don't even look forward they disappointing amen but now listen see there was more signs in the early part of the Lord Jesus's Ministry than in the last part there was more signs than brother Brown's early Ministry than there was in the life's part of his ministry right that's right and then when you get down to what he would call in the third pool remember there's a quote where he says I believe all of them people was healed he said because the Bible says it but he said take that little girl to the doctor and he said I guarantee you healing we call that the third pull we don't only happen on the spring list yeah right right it didn't happen ever service did it right come on right but they were sick healed and dead raised and stuff like that almost every service okay but he never spoke of it as the third Pope me that's why the Lord Jesus when he come down to it and he went to Calvary when he was in the garden right he prayed through and he yielded to the father and he said okay it's over with I'm through I'm you know whatever you want me to do it's done in very few words with said afternoon until even pilate referred to it that word ain't you gonna talk to me don't you know that I have power to set you free what'd he say he said the only Power you have is what my father gives you you didn't argue did he all right he didn't scream and holler I see people doing that trying to cast out demons demons love screaming and hollering you ain't gonna scream and holler a demon out you just speak the word take that and move on with it all right but watch now the reason I speak of these things to you tonight about the the way the Lord Jesus experienced this and the way that brother Reynolds experiences and how they come Empire it's because it will compare comparancy then come in Jesus leaving Mount of transfiguration he's going towards Calvary and receiving the complete revelation of the opening of the word and he preached it in Matthew 24. brother Branham the things he was doing and then he comes forth after the visitation of the Angels and he comes forward and preaches the seals and each Ministry that starts tapering off right I mean is that what it looks like what all right now what are we talking about me he preached the seals he met the angels he come back preaching the Sea of have you met the angel of the god that's right because according to what I just read now you want to reread it again get another one here positioned in Christ where we started 5 22 in the morning service adoption place it manifested himself out here and put a ceremony on him Vision with an angel tell him something now if he's told the truth what now he if he's just making up something it won't work no no that won't work we've had a lot of that right but I mean but I mean manifestations of sons of God when God manifests himself and sends him out and then he goes forth and what he says is true what he does is the truth what he does he manifests Christ how do you how do you judge him how do you judge any person more than I look him in the eyes my eyes judge your spirits you know they don't judge Spirits by looking now you judge it was just right here what the prophet said how do you judge him by the way he stays with the word all right right with the word see that's how you know all men is by the way he stays with the word all right so now Hebrews we're back to that 1 14 15. we've had an angel I wrote around him right let's have a church age Mission you're an angel all right if you if you have the new birth you have the Holy Spirit which is an angel of God in manifestation and can be used that way and you also the prophet of God said if you need this send me a letter I'll be glad to send them to you he said ever born again Christian has an angel now has your angel taken you out and told you anything if it happened with the Lord Jesus and it happened with brother Brown don't you think it'll happen year in the end time with you and I am that's all I'm doing that's just simple as I'm making it this you know everybody said brother that was so deep where is that so deep that what is the point of d it's just comparing the things and then saying that it's not for us to just sit down and say look what we've had wonderful what we've had but God is not the god of the head come on Amen he's the god of the living amen bye has he taken you out and visited you with an angel all right told you something for the people now yours were you know we're gonna go for a little while all right so you go ahead and go sleep and forget the rest of the message because we're gonna get personal now as he visited you with an Angel all right now that's your own experience right amen now what he visited brother Branham is not my experience right right but what he's visited me is not your experience all right amen everybody got me and what I'm saying yeah has he visited you all right because I believe when The Headstone comes to the individual that that means God himself stepped on the scene in that individual right amen you met you see anything you're going to say brother they all you just trying to do okay quit do what you don't do this all right with me but you see I told you this what 40 years ago so it ain't something I hatched up okay anybody want to get up here and walk up and tell how many times brother Dale has seen an angel in his home somebody tell me how many times three times okay he said what did he tell you anything no I told you what I done the first time I seen it I grabbed my pistol and took off later oh it was real it was not a fugitive of my imagination my imagination don't play games I never was a drunk that seen a thick elephant they're the same I've always had the same mind and when I saw that man standing in my bedroom door I took a pistol one afternoon that's how real it was but the next two times I seen it I seen it again right after them and then I seen after we moved to where we live now I always wondered had I moved at the wrong place because where I'd seen an angel before and I woke up one night and I looked up there and I know the difference in a dream in a leery world were you in between the two but you see he didn't tell me so that's not going to make anything out of me it's just telling you that it can happen he ran around said God let some people have these experiences where they could tell others I just tell you what I'm saying I told you that when I was about 10 11 years old that I saw God at a church standing there now the Hoffman's head across not a figure I couldn't tell you how much you weighed what it was I just saw him standing there and I knew it I wanted to see that God and all my Christian experience I wanted somebody to tell me about that God I saw and I couldn't find it I talked to the Baptist people about it and they say all you need to do just go you need to go to a Pentecostal Church you know and get in with a movement of The Spirit Well I what I didn't know it was I would have went I guess but I tried I walked into church one day where we used to go to church about four and a half not too long the doors were locked everything was closed up I walked in and there's a man walking around the basement the doors were all locked I unlocked I was the one that got there first I generally do it here and I opened the doors and went in he was in the basement I said good to see you sir he said oh I'm just traveling down the road I gotta go though I should want to hang around we'll be having services in a little while he said no I said you stopped incident and I got no no well I said okay I'll go in the out the door you know he went out the door he walked down and he walked down and walked to the highway walking towards Gainesville well it's kind of odd that's the way we went when we found this message you know all them you can say well you just doing this doing that and I'm just telling you the truth I'm asking you a question has God met you that's right now you can't deny this one and I wasn't in no cave I wasn't in no healed I wasn't in no Duets because I'm not made that away God has spoke to me when I was out in the woods but he spoke to me and when he spoke to me about those seals and showed me how they broke I was running a job at General Motors that nobody couldn't run when I was out it was so fast they would have to put a man and a half at least under that job that day it was so fast and yet the Lord is right there opened no sealed up to me and began to show me and make running a job that a man could not run it for 15 minutes for me to go take a break 16 in the afternoon I'd have to help him out as we called it getting behind you know going down the line called it getting in the hole well then back up before he could leave and go on to another but the Lord came one day and visited me and he told me about the opening of the seals and it stands till today never had anybody challenge you it stands till today probably a lot of people wanted to but they knew they couldn't handle it because it was too much of what the prophet had said because there's no honor that this man ever been given all of the honor I give Mr brother promise Ministry message he was not God but God used that man right to speak and now for 20 something 30 years ago today that was 79 and then I preached him in 82 over again in 1979 I preached it and tried to bring Christ to you that's all I've ever tried to pray yeah I fully believe what brother Reynolds said you go to Christ the mystery he said if you miss it in them seals he said come back to this message that's what he said he didn't say go back read The Shield book again which that's what we need to do I need to do that now we should come after this message Christ the mystery because there was the mystery Christ that's what he revealed to me was Christ and just working I mean working a job and I'm not you know you can ask these these brothers they were there yeah the jobs that I ran they actually on that job they were told to load me and fire me my supervisor told me finally he said the more work I put on you the better job you've done and they finally backed off got afraid and they backed up and gave me good jobs I think because they seemed that I was honest and sincere but yet the Lord come down and spoke to me and showed me how to what your stands alone the first seal here stands a lamb with a book in his hand he said there goes your white horse rider so look at that fella riding off look at that guy going the other way because if you ever see two people in the Bible you can't have two Lords that won't work if there's two people in the Bible one of them's the devil and one of God because God is not too personal amen he's one God so then the prophet of God go to the first shield and look at it he said here stands a lamb with the book of his name there it goes that white horse rider he said thereby it could not be the holy spirit that he even used to think and preach that it was but he said it's got to be the Antichrist well the Lord revealed that to me and that stood now for 30 something years well see that's what I don't understand to you ministers out there to be listening or even ministers here or whatever does God ever come down and visit did you tell you something now I hope you understand what I was saying I didn't account the three times I seen but I didn't count even the person I saw standing in a church when I was 11 years old I never counted none of those as a new birth or anything I just tell what I saw and see humble people out there they they say oh he's just making this up well there's plenty of people sitting right here in the building that'll verify that I've told this 40 years ago right so I don't have to prop it up now and I'm not breaking except on Jesus Christ but why has the ministers around the message are scared of the seals are they afraid to preach why are they afraid to preach like the prophet of God said if you don't understand Daniel 70 weeks you're going to miss it in the seals right then he said that in Daniel's 70 weeks look but yet who understands Daniel 70 weeks or if anybody even preaches on Daniel 7 units but he said if you don't understand it you mentioned it I wouldn't want to make those quotes but you see about 1973 I began to study and the Lord opened that Daniel 70 weeks up to me and I preached it and I say again it stood the test because it's never been tackled publicly big and won't tackle it because I don't understand really but yet it still stands to date I believe same thing I did except for 1973 said before see church I've not tried to bring to you my human I've tried to bring Christ to you I try to stay even away from telling you about things that would take place because I don't want it built on that that's right oh it's all built on Jesus Christ yeah but where do you see anybody see all right come on man sure oh yeah we preach on it we preach on it who wants to preach well I'm not a teacher like you if you're a powerful Ministry person with the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're supposed to have the Holy Ghost and a Ministry and that Ministry is supposed to be capable of teaching and the capacity of your ministry sure absolutely amen but of course we like to go to Christ the mystery God reveal we're brought around and says said the teachers who want to miss it but they don't see they they just don't throw it off on the teacher they don't want to I agree the teachers have missed it well I'm just telling you God met me and told me and I've come told you about it 30 years ago and it still stands today of course I'm not very popular but there's no problem neither was the Lord Jesus and neither was brought around and brother random gun over a pretty started on that sell it see like it really heard what he said now he was just trying to explain Jesus Christ right do you agree you believe that brother Branham all he was doing through the seals and all was just explaining Jesus Christ trying to show Jesus Christ you agree with that you know what he said he said thousands of my friends believe me because he's trying to explain Jesus Christ they couldn't argue about the gift they wouldn't argue or cry in any way to attack the angel they said oh while he's well he's praying for the sick while he's doing this he's a prophet but said when he starts preaching the word but you see the prophet of God said there's no perfect faith I think I gave it to you in one of the yeah number four and you know you become the word as you receive the word that's right how can you become the worker oh I was born third now not according to what the prophet says on number five on your notes from who is this melchized who is this Melchizedek wrote around and said you bypassed the word he said Jesus came the word he said you pie past the word yep but he said you become the word here if we become the word here the Lord Jesus was born to work amen all right but we bypassed it do we have to become the word here and to do that it means we must have the new birth hey look what he says then we become the word here we are formed to the word image to be a partaker of the word feed on the word by being that here's the problem predestinated since the beginning you see that little speck part of life that laid in you from the beginning when you started your journey right a little representation of predestination is what he said the little woman that dwell had right one time he calls it representation from predestination the other time he called the representation by predestination what you see like I told you back a few weeks ago months or so ago there's a predestinated word the word is what comes predestinated is not the people comes predestinated eternally from God right you remember the quotes in the church age book right it's the person not the person that comes with it's the cedar word there's a word for every age I preach two or about two sermons on that a word a seed for every age Martin Luther was the just shall live by faith that's right but yeah they made it a Reformation because even he tried to reform the Church but the message he brought was restoration amen but it turned into Reformation which you and I can't be in in Reformation anymore we've got to be in Total Restoration because the Bible says the restitution which is the word restore right all things even broke it down for you there a message or so ago that Joel says it that it's to restore what has fallen away Joy is speaking of the church ages because it's like the canker wearing pong worms Locust and the caterpillar ate down right the brother round did come just to restore the ages he come to restore all the words that's right even marriage and divorce all the things he preached after then where did he say it was revealed at he said the Rapture was revealed in them seals that's what he says amen see because the shield is the entire word of God amen amen and if God if he's come on the scene and give us the revelation of the word then what are we looking for right what are we looking for to happen well if we had that we'd be we'd just be we'd be going we'd be with it wouldn't be a certain person Among Us you know whose fault the prophet said it is the reason is the sick people among us now you want him what did he say was the reason that there's six people among us he said because there's people among us that are not right right he said one unconfessed sin in a church will cause the whole church to fail that's right amen and you will have to bitterly answer he says quote the rest of it so then whose fault is it that God's not among us God has brought his word that's what I'm trying to get you to see I'm not trying to exalt anything other than Jesus Christ that's right amen amen The Compassion of the Lord Jesus The Compassion of the brother wrath and the compassion to me and you like he said but brother Dale he's never met me with an angel no he didn't stop a line at General Motors he didn't send down a great Pillar of Fire and holler at me and tell me all about it he was an inward thoughts that was coming that I was writing down I can only write two or three words because of the speed of the job I was running and I know you ain't gonna understand this one man I thought God if this is true if what you're showing me is true there's no way for me to break it or stop it I turned around and told a man on the other side of the line a joke not a dirty joke I don't believe in them I told him a joke we laughed and I turned around and picked up my pen and caught the job run like crazy picked the pin up and started writing again it was just perfectly Right Down the Line never even a gap in the wording remember the old manifest that was on the jobs you know they had to have them where you could keep up with it you remember the other day the manifestation yeah I'd rip off those manifests and lay down on the table upside down because it wouldn't have written on the backside and I'd write a few notes and I put them in my pocket and write a few notes my wife now she finds little pieces of paper laying on my desk or anywhere in my clothes she takes somebody puts them up because she knows it means or something everybody thinks though just got to be that the Lord's just going to approach this he's just going to be there with you and the end of this will be all day long listen to a man one day telling about it I ain't making fun of him his business between him and God but he said the Lord told him more to fish and he said no Lord I'm going to fish over here in this deep water so the Lord said no fish over here and he said no I'm going to fish over here it's just an argument for a long time now I don't believe that that's right but he did say fish thought of her and caught some fish what the Lord told him so that's between him and the Lord now you're saying God don't play games when he comes he comes sometimes and he just speaks one word well if he'd just give me a word that's all I need I don't need a whole page I was wondering how to follow this tonight in the correct order walking around down in the basement tell a while ago and I said Lord I need just a little bit more I know what I want to say but I need a little bit more he said what you've been preaching about the angels that their ministering Spirit sent forward to minister into the errors of salvation that's all it needs that's all I needed okay yep all right has God visited you with an Angel I'm telling you you're looking for something you see out there some great Halo some light something speaking to you and God can do that and has done that with people right but what about that steel Small Voice amen that's right I thought that was what attracted The Prophet's attention it wasn't a great loud Thunders and the Lightnings and the winds and the things and you know that God appeared in every one of those things in Bible terminology he appeared in the Thunders he appeared in the in the lightning he appeared in the Wind right but none of those brought the prophet out of the cave and then it's kind of odd too isn't it looked like he won't stay in there when he heard a steel small voice hey if you ever hear him don't worry about it you can't stay in the cave either all right amen people around the country you you do it a lot of you you you're gonna deny you'll be saying this and when I get to of Google quit saying anything about it but you're not going to think that God has been with us you're going to think if it was we would see this and we would see that and why haven't we seen this because of you is that enough amen I told you I'll make it blunt it's because of you and your unbelief and I'm looking over the congregation and I ain't seemingly not one person that's right it's our unbelief is what's called amen that's right amen you don't believe God had been with us come on may I quote right around we can't go into desperation God has to bring us to desperation but what we have seen in Lula Georgia for 40 years I want to throw us into desperation because we haven't had to to back off of any of these doctrines and things that's went around the country that's right the two souls are selling Thunder versus Perugia son of man forever Jordan 's just two Lords all these things it hasn't taken us the word that we've got caught in the junk that's right but you don't think is an honor of that you don't think oh it's just your intellect brother you've been stubborn that's why did you mean that did you mean it was just my stubbornness well then I'd make my stubbornness better than your Holy Ghost because evidently your Holy Ghost ain't been able to keep you out of Doctrine is that enough you mean my stubbornness has kept me out and you went after those jokes and I'm not just preaching out there most people says you know brother he had that way of doing he lean on the pulpit to point at the microphone he said I'm talking about I'll tell him I ain't talking about out there I'm talking about here now watch out there I can hear it's been made available but yet people have drove a house somebody that's predicted 14 times and everyone have been wrong and each time they'd say this is thus saith the Lord when uh something happened wrong somewhere and we read the Bible the other day where what you're supposed to do that kind of person yeah right to my Prop Shop like supposed to kill him all right of course the government won't let us and I wouldn't want to either because I'm a Christian so what do you do you say brother Dale now don't say the rest what you fixing to say I am going to say it too I'll do my best to kill the influence you say you kill a man you kill him you kill his influence you killed a man don't play garbage with me you mean I'm supposed to Pat the pope on the back and brother we agree with everything you say I can't speak against you cause I'm a Christian Martin Luther said they said Martin Luther the world is against you he said then you let the world know I'm against them amen that's it you kill a man you kill his influence I'm trying my best to kill the influence the devil's got on your mind and mine that's right I've been doing that for 40 something years trying to kill that influence that Devil's got on you and I and I'll try my best to kill it until the day I die that's right amen trying my best to cleanse you and I with the word because what does what if I told you over and over how can you ever have anything in God how do you get the statue of perfect man how do you get the virtues of God Only by the revealed word that's right amen all right you can't you can't manufacture it you can't prop it up all right that's right but when God reveals a word he comes down and just speaks he just adds those virtues to yeah that's right forgive me for being personal don't change my salary won't make me no more popular and my phone won't be ringing when I get home to go anywhere else and preach I told you I wanted two years ago I wanted to get this message out I cried and prayed God how wave come along like the old God these ministers knows I've taught with them told them go out and take this message to other people take the messages out to other people I thought oh God wait comes along they'll have him because he's got a little different delivery done well he's doing pretty good but he's getting unpopular too the more he preaches the more unpopular he'll get if he preaches a dream because the truth is not too well spoken but why why Would we not want the prophets asked it all right I don't understand that I cry and pray what's wrong what's wrong with people that don't want to hear what runaround have to say in the Purity oh that's God that's why we stay at home play today well now you just got a few scriptures and a lot of quotes and put around that's facing you so go right ahead the prophet said you can't wait till him don't worry I should get to play a thing please he never mentioned playing tonight he said there's a FireFold Ministry if you ain't got no powerful Ministry you know that I've explained it plug it takes do you get one but be searching for a five-fold Ministry amen some of you have left in crownless countries sitting here California used to wear it on my job I'm looking I do see he knows how to put us all together right that's right that's right but you see church I'm just trying to talk about Jesus Christ that's all it's Christ and him glorified all right now I'm going to quote right around and I'll give you the quote later he said adoption he's talking about Transfiguration now he said adopt you and glorifies Jesus do you see a man trying to glorify himself then you've got problems but you see a man trying to glorify Jesus Christ I just read you a quote where the Prophet said see what he does with the word that's right come and show me where I missed the word brother just left recently you know not too long ago and I just asked him one simple question I said brother just show me where I'm off to work I should just showed me well you go to them Fellowship meetings and then Fellowship meetings as Antichrist I said well I still don't ask you one simple question show me where I'm off the word well you just showed your scholarship meetings Hey Brother Fellowship from more people than I do so there's a lot of them that make fun of me about going to Fellowship meetings they stay on their telephones talking around the country to know more about what's going on in this message that I know of at all I don't know anything except I hear it from some of you because I'm not on internet me and my wife watched a video last night you know who it was Donnie Reagan you know what it's about you've done a good job I literally thought about calling him and asking could I played the tape in his church you've done a good job you know what you're talking about sex so everybody make fun of talking about sex but you tell me the man wouldn't ride not sure he could have explained certain things a little bit more into detail grind okay but he made a good point he said a man ought to marry a woman or to marry to keep from burning in their body he said that's God's ordained way for a husband and wife and he said it's God's way of keeping you from burning in your lust I agree with it Trump said when I hear the truth I don't mind amen it I don't care if the pope a wrong said it but we're going to be judged by the word you don't have to worry about whether what brother Dales told you is The Truth About Angels or what he's made or what he's saying you won't be judged by that that was my own personal thing all right you will be judged by the words you've heard and you'll either be justified by it or you'll be condemned by it and I know that and that makes you stand in reverence and respect to realize that God has been with us 40 years to teach us the word right doctrines hasn't come in here and busted the church up who has believed our report and to whom is the arm of the Lord revealed amen yeah have you heard the word for 40 something years 40 years well thank God for the word you know a dumb donkey told truth one day thank God for the dumb donkey he told the truth he kept prophets being killed all right rooster preach the gospel amen all right he said these rocks will cry out you know what the old original seven inch reels especially you know what those seven each reel tapes was made out of us that's reading I don't like some of this other stuff it's too modern you know and it's fine it works perfectly good but the old seven inch reel was made out of rocks it's the dim rocks will cry out that was a stone made they were made from Stone put together where it would make a tape isn't that wonderful the rocks will cry out and they have that's right let's Stand Together just take on this compare it compared now let me give you one life quote that brother runs safe he said if God does anything for one person you may say any person but if if God does anything for anybody he said in order to throw the rest of the church into desperation whether it be healing or whether it be revealing of the word or what it means now listen folks we need rice it is drying up all over the country that's right not just here but other states I think it's drying up they don't know what's going on I was reading in the paper the other day where they said they couldn't this is happening and that's happening and they can't figure out why we need rain you know what we need then we need Sons and Daughters to call for rain all right we need to pray for rain pray for it and then say it and say God thank you for the rain can you say it that away let's say it all together God thank you for the rain amen amen we've made you known father now come and manifest yourself you remember years ago 1988 is that the year I stood right here July and August is our driest hottest months I stood right here and I said it'll rain more this August than it has ever rained that was a month or so before August they recorded in Gainesville there was more rain that month than they'd ever been in the month of August but you see I want you to say I know where I stand I stood on the word you think I'm afraid to preach right he's like I'm afraid to go out and face to the ministers and preachers and this whatever this message I fear no man why because if I'm wrong I can be made right but if I'm right I want you yes Lord to see it that's right amen and that brother saw the pillar of Fire Seed up here around the pulpit I told him I said don't tell nobody for a little while let it go don't one day I asked him I said well have you seen anything else you know he said yeah and I said well what'd you see he said I saw the pillar of fire leaving from here and going back that way immediately a brother jumped on that and he said we got to pray because the holy spirit's leaving out of here the filter fire is leaving I come right behind him I said no sir I said it's doing exactly what I ask him to do it's leaving here to go to you take it and speak it we need it children repeat the word let knowledge feedback amen 369 you might have a knee the Mighty God is just afraid you're wrong anymore 395 just left don't worry again okay by you anymore right now to see is falling in English that the Wrath would be this morning bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily God made manifest that's right for the Gentile this meditation did you change the Israel I love you down for you here in your comfort in the accomplishment Holy Spirit Holy Spirit foreign foreign
