[0:12] get this up in the back I don't know if
[0:14] they can and if they can't that's okay
[0:18] we'll just uh
[0:21] do what we can
[0:24] amen this is another day that the Lord
[0:27] has made
[0:29] let us rejoice and be glad in it praise
[0:32] the Lord Jesus
[0:33] hey man let's just buy our heads before
[0:35] we start our heavenly father we just
[0:37] thank you once again for another
[0:38] opportunity to serve you and Lord to
[0:41] come father to worship you in spirit and
[0:43] in truth and to Feast upon your word
[0:45] we ask Lord that you would have your way
[0:47] here this seat this morning and Lord you
[0:49] just be the spokesperson here in this
[0:51] little lesson help us father God to see

[0:58] father immediately Lord God and just put
[1:01] it to practice Lord have faith in your
[1:03] word we ask these things now in Jesus
[1:06] Christ's name amen
[1:10] I said we can turn this screen here
[1:19] all right
[1:21] we'll zoom in a little bit
[1:24] hope you all can see that there
[1:27] all right so we're going to talk this
[1:29] morning about the importance uh you know
[1:32] I never can get away from this but The
[1:34] Importance of Being anchored in an
[1:36] absolute amen and uh I believe that that
[1:41] we all should have absolutes and there's
[1:42] absolutes in life amen they're
[1:45] undeniable there are unquestionable
[1:47] there that that you know
[1:50] um that that you can't get away from
[1:52] amen and so I think that if you have
[1:55] absolutes in your life physically in
[1:58] your in your physical life in your
[2:01] everyday life how much more in your
[2:04] spiritual life you should be anchored
[2:06] into something amen that you're not
[2:08] you're the devil tries and and throws
[2:12] everything at you every day to keep you
[2:14] uneven and then to keep you Rocky but
[2:18] you are anchored and you are solid in an
[2:21] absolute and we know that brother
[2:22] Brandon preached that message called the
[2:23] absolute praise the Lord Jesus it's a
[2:26] good one if you don't if you haven't
[2:27] heard it so I'm gonna read a few of
[2:29] those quotes from that message but let's
[2:31] start here with the scripture here in
[2:32] second Peter chapter one and uh we'll
[2:35] just kind of go through here quickly so
[2:37] Simon Peter is servant and Apostle of
[2:39] Jesus Christ to them that have obtained
[2:40] like Precious Faith with us through the
[2:43] righteousness of God and our Savior
[2:45] Jesus Christ Grace and peace be
[2:47] multiplied unto you through the
[2:48] knowledge of God and of and of Jesus our
[2:50] lord according as his divine power hath
[2:53] given us
[2:55] have given unto us all things that
[2:57] pertain unto life and godliness thank
[3:00] God for that through the knowledge of
[3:02] him that hath called us to glory and
[3:04] virtue whereby are given unto us
[3:06] exceeding great and precious promises
[3:08] that by these ye might be partakers of
[3:11] the divine nature haven't escaped the
[3:13] corruption that is in the world through
[3:14] lust and beside this given all diligence
[3:17] add to your faith virtue and to Virtue
[3:20] knowledge to knowledge Temperance and to
[3:22] Temperance patience into patience
[3:24] godliness and to Godliness brotherly
[3:26] kindness into brotherly kindness charity
[3:28] for these things be in you and the bound
[3:34] not just to be in you but they abound in
[3:36] other words they are expanding they are
[3:39] growing in your life they make you that
[3:42] ye shall neither be Barren nor
[3:44] unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[3:46] Jesus Christ it's an absolute that when
[3:48] a tree an apple tree is growing uh
[3:51] eventually he's got to abound and given
[3:53] fruit right and the more you nurture
[3:56] that amen the more it's going to give
[3:58] it's going to give so it's the same
[4:01] thing here what Peter is talking about
[4:02] but he that lacketh these things is
[4:04] blind and cannot see afar off and hath
[4:08] forgotten that he was purged from his
[4:10] old sins wherefore the rather Brethren
[4:12] give diligence
[4:14] give diligence to make your calling an
[4:16] election sure
[4:18] and that's why I wanted to make make
[4:20] your calling an election sure know where
[4:23] you are standing in this walk with
[4:25] Christ amen
[4:28] uh for if ye do these things ye shall
[4:31] never fall
[4:32] that's an absolute
[4:35] that Peter is giving you amen for if you
[4:39] do these things you shall never fall
[4:41] amen now you're going to make mistakes
[4:45] in your in your in your life in your
[4:48] walk with God you're gonna but you're
[4:49] never gonna fall once you've receive the
[4:51] new birth you can't fall your soul can't
[4:53] fall
[4:55] hey man you've you're anchored Amen in
[4:58] the absolute and the absolute anchored
[5:00] in you praise God
[5:01] amen for so an entrance shall be
[5:04] ministered unto you abundantly in the
[5:06] Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and
[5:08] Savior Jesus Christ wherefore I will not
[5:11] be negligent to put you always in
[5:13] remembrance of these things though you
[5:16] know them
[5:18] Peter is saying you know even if you
[5:20] know these things I'm still going to
[5:21] remind you
[5:23] and be established be established in the
[5:26] present truth amen you can look at the
[5:29] foundations of this building amen they
[5:31] have to they have to be established in
[5:33] order to keep building upon it and if
[5:36] there's no established foundations this
[5:39] the building eventually is going to
[5:40] crawl same thing in your spiritual life
[5:42] if you have nothing established in your
[5:45] life spiritually if you're not
[5:46] established in the word of God
[5:48] spiritually amen eventually at some
[5:50] point down the road something will come
[5:52] your way that's going to make you fall
[5:54] and make you crumble
[5:56] now I'm afraid that sometimes some of us
[5:58] amen we might think we are strong and we
[6:01] might think that we are okay but in
[6:04] reality there's Rocky areas in our life
[6:06] they have some the right thing comes
[6:08] along amen it'll it'll cause us to come
[6:10] completely crumble and I hope that
[6:12] that's not the case
[6:14] no matter how close the person is to you
[6:17] or no matter what what's going on the
[6:19] situation is and you make sure that if
[6:22] they're not going or if something
[6:23] happens I'm still God I still have to go
[6:26] I still got to move on with God because
[6:28] my my walk doesn't depend on on on who's
[6:32] still here or what's going on Amen I
[6:34] still got to move on with God Amen it
[6:37] can't it can't depend on family members
[6:39] and it can't depend amen I gotta move on
[6:42] you see so so that that that's having an
[6:45] absolute that's being established in
[6:47] truth amen and you having a rebel as I
[6:50] spoke Wednesday night you having a
[6:52] revelation of yourself
[6:54] of your own amen of what God Said in his
[6:57] word
[6:58] amen Walking with God that way
[7:01] a man allows for things to come at you
[7:03] and all kinds of Winds of doctrine that
[7:06] will come to you all kinds of man's
[7:08] opinions and all kinds of different
[7:10] thoughts that man might bring to you but
[7:13] you are established
[7:15] you are I'm anchored in an absolute that
[7:19] can't it's unmovable and I'm not moving
[7:22] with it
[7:24] because again it's unmovable
[7:26] amen so what is the what does the word
[7:28] absolute mean it means
[7:30] from free from imperfection in other
[7:33] words perfect I wish I could get that a
[7:35] little bigger but that's about as good
[7:37] as I can do here
[7:39] positive unquestionable
[7:42] and man there's it's it's unquestionable
[7:45] it's fundamental and brother Brandon
[7:47] would use his word I believe he would
[7:49] use this word in that message uh the
[7:51] absolute is the ultimate and then it's
[7:54] the Supreme
[7:55] amen there we have a what a supreme
[7:58] court in this in this in this country I
[8:01] mean that when
[8:02] decisions the uh you know of cases that
[8:06] have not been made and they can't come
[8:08] to a decision well then there's that
[8:10] Supreme Court that's supposed to make
[8:13] the decision amen and whatever they say
[8:16] it doesn't matter if the majority of the
[8:18] American people don't agree with it what
[8:20] they say goes
[8:22] right because they are the Supreme Court
[8:24] in other words they are the absolute
[8:27] Court you see and so it doesn't matter
[8:29] what anybody else says amen what the
[8:32] word of God says is the supreme law is
[8:36] the Supreme word it is the absolute amen
[8:39] because if they try to teach uh they try
[8:42] to teach uh you know the the things that
[8:46] we hear nowadays about genders and stuff
[8:48] like that
[8:49] they can do it all along and they can
[8:51] shout and manifest and and Proclaim and
[8:54] out in the streets marching and and
[8:55] doing all their nasty things that they
[8:57] do up in New York and all that
[9:00] but it doesn't change nature
[9:03] it doesn't change what how God made a
[9:05] man and what and how God made a woman
[9:07] and years down the road you they could
[9:11] say as much as they want to I am binary
[9:14] I'm non-binary I'm not a man or a woman
[9:17] you're one of the two because that's
[9:19] what God established at the beginning
[9:21] there's no there's no way there's no way
[9:24] around it that's a that's an absolute
[9:26] you see years down the road 50 60 100
[9:30] 300 years down the road if if if if we
[9:33] are still here and they dig up the
[9:36] non-binary bones they're going to either
[9:38] say that was a man or a woman
[9:41] they know even by the bones that you
[9:44] were male or female so right now they're
[9:47] just you know I'm all this but in
[9:50] reality God is like you're you're a man
[9:54] you're a woman it's what I created you
[9:56] and he ain't worried about it I ain't
[9:59] worried about it because that's my
[10:01] absolute you see but all it is is just
[10:04] nothing but a questionable things and
[10:07] trying to get people riled up in in in
[10:10] in their minds
[10:12] and perfectly embodying the nature of a
[10:14] thing amen so it's it's the ultimate now
[10:16] we were talking I'm just talking about
[10:18] that in recent years
[10:20] tolerance has become a virtue
[10:23] it's become a virtue now nowadays that
[10:26] that you just tolerate whatever anybody
[10:29] believes and if they come to you if they
[10:33] come to you and I notice this more with
[10:35] with with our young people that that
[10:36] that they'll they'll try to tell you
[10:38] something and you just have to just just
[10:42] not say anything
[10:44] you just have to just kind of accept it
[10:46] but but then when you try to tell them
[10:47] the truth they get mad
[10:50] and I'm trying to tell you the truth
[10:52] from the Bible
[10:53] what
[10:54] but but yet you have to accept
[10:56] everything they tell you
[10:58] or anybody else here you know but when
[11:00] you try to tell them truth oh no no no
[11:03] no no no you gotta accept what I say but
[11:06] but I don't have to accept what you say
[11:08] that doesn't work that way
[11:10] you're coming to me to try to you know
[11:12] to tell me what you what you what you
[11:14] believe now you're asking me what I
[11:17] believe then let me tell you what I
[11:18] believe you see you see I don't try to
[11:21] impose what I believe on people but I
[11:24] think it's your duty your duty bound and
[11:26] when somebody asks what you believe and
[11:29] what you think about this you should
[11:30] tell them you should tell them and you
[11:33] should not be ashamed of it whatsoever
[11:35] you're Duty bound because God tells us
[11:37] to do that in his word
[11:39] because why that person may be genuinely
[11:42] asking you because he or she really
[11:44] wants to know amen sometimes we think
[11:47] that somebody just wants to challenge Us
[11:49] in reality they may not be one of the
[11:51] challenges they really want to know amen
[11:53] so be ready that's what we always study
[11:55] that's what we always pray and and and
[11:58] seeking the word amen you believe what
[12:00] you want and I'll believe what I want
[12:02] and everyone will be happy and get along
[12:05] that's the society that will be that we
[12:07] live in nowadays
[12:09] and but it it doesn't work that way yeah
[12:12] sure they believe whatever they want but
[12:13] now if they they're forcing me to
[12:15] believe how they want they want me to
[12:17] believe I don't go that way I because I
[12:20] don't force them to believe the way I
[12:22] believe it's a two-way streak you see
[12:25] it's a two-way you know and we'll be
[12:27] we'll be fine that way you see
[12:30] but ironically tolerance which Embraces
[12:33] every kind of idea or belief denies the
[12:36] existence of absolutes
[12:38] that's very that's a very interesting
[12:41] amen but we know that the Bible is clear
[12:43] that absolutes do exist amen and and
[12:47] there's absolute truth because it begins
[12:50] with God Amen he is the source of life
[12:53] he is the the originator of of all
[12:56] things amen the Bible says in the
[12:59] beginning God created amen there was a
[13:02] creation and we are part of that
[13:04] creation and there's an order an
[13:07] absolute order that God created things
[13:09] and the way he he put things in order
[13:12] that's that's that's established and it
[13:15] can't be moved that's right and when you
[13:17] go against the established ways of God
[13:20] let's say for example you go against
[13:22] nature amen that's why nature Rebels and
[13:26] they push back
[13:27] and and hence you have all the different
[13:30] catastrophes and the different things
[13:31] why because you're coming against nature
[13:34] amen certain laws certain things amen so
[13:38] brother Branham says here sir brogram
[13:40] says here in the absolute he says that's
[13:43] the way a man when he's born again of
[13:45] the Holy Spirit he's got a hold of
[13:48] something that's got an anchor out
[13:50] yonder and the storms doesn't shake him
[13:53] he knows he's all right he's anchored
[13:56] all right amen you imagine a man on a
[13:59] boat and he's he's uh you know the waves
[14:03] are tossing and and to and fro amen but
[14:06] he knows that he can depend on that
[14:07] anchor amen and that anchor amen is
[14:11] going to hold him and it's gonna fall in
[14:12] the established ground you see down in
[14:15] the bottom of the sea and it'll keep him
[14:17] it'll keep him steady I don't know all
[14:19] the details of how it all works but I
[14:21] just know he's our anchor
[14:23] I don't know where else to turn to but
[14:26] him Peter said Lord where could we go
[14:28] there's no other anchor to turn to but
[14:30] you amen so thank God for that anchor
[14:34] amen so we have to make his word our
[14:37] absolute and brother Brown continues
[14:39] saying oh you might say I wish that's
[14:41] all he required today he was speaking of
[14:43] job's requirement offer burnt offerings
[14:46] for him and his family
[14:48] but it's less than that
[14:50] amen it's less than that just faith in
[14:53] his word and you if you make his word
[14:57] you're absolute you can
[15:00] hey man you can
[15:03] Amen brother Wade's been reading that
[15:05] quote where brother Ryan says yes you
[15:06] can
[15:07] you can any Divine promise in the Bible
[15:11] you can tie your soul to it
[15:15] amen because it's it's an absolute
[15:18] now if you really believe that what God
[15:20] Said in his word is the Eternal Word of
[15:23] God then you can take every promise that
[15:25] God said about you and say Lord I
[15:27] believe it that settles it I'm moving on
[15:29] with that amen that's an absolute
[15:33] praise God no matter how much the waves
[15:35] whip you around you're still tied to
[15:39] your absolute
[15:40] no matter what comes and goes and no
[15:43] matter what sickness has come no matter
[15:44] what happens you are still tied to your
[15:47] absolute amen praise the Lord Jesus so
[15:50] what is absolute truth
[15:52] man I'm trying to move a little quickly
[15:54] now absolute truth has been defined as
[15:57] that which is true for all people
[16:01] amen for all times and for all places
[16:04] amen
[16:06] and I don't know if one thing better
[16:08] than than the word of God
[16:11] the word of God is is is uh it is an
[16:16] absolute for all times for all places
[16:19] and for all people amen and what is the
[16:23] word of God who is the word of God
[16:25] as our Lord Jesus Christ
[16:28] absolute truth is objective it's
[16:31] Universal and constant
[16:33] amen it never changes
[16:36] absolute truth originates from God who
[16:39] didn't just create truth but who is
[16:41] truth
[16:43] that's the reason why he said I am
[16:46] the way
[16:48] their truth
[16:49] and the life he did not say I am away
[16:53] and I am a truth and I am a life no I am
[16:58] the the the this is the pulpit
[17:03] right this is the pulpits this is the
[17:06] church's Pulpit amen and this is the mic
[17:08] that belongs to the pulpit you see this
[17:11] is not a mic amen this is the mic
[17:14] because I see no others
[17:16] there's no other mics but this mic
[17:19] that's what God is trying to say Amen
[17:21] that I am the way I am the truth and I
[17:24] am the life so when there's gray areas
[17:26] in our life amen about about certain
[17:30] things that you're questioning or you're
[17:32] not sure about something go back to the
[17:35] way
[17:36] go back to the truth it's in here I mean
[17:40] it's in so much that it that that that
[17:42] it speaks about the way you should even
[17:44] handle money
[17:46] that's how that's how that's how that's
[17:48] how deep God gets amen into your life
[17:51] because well sometimes we think that the
[17:53] Bible is just a bunch of stories and
[17:55] history and and and a bunch of uh uh
[17:58] just names and and numbers but it's a
[18:01] life
[18:02] that wants to touch your life
[18:06] in a personal way yes
[18:08] yes not only just not only not only it
[18:11] reveals because the Bible says that it
[18:13] will lead you and guide you the holy
[18:14] spirit will lead you and guide you into
[18:15] all truth not just doctrinal truth not
[18:19] just not just the the the the the the
[18:22] truths that we we know about but the
[18:25] truth about you the truth about your
[18:28] life
[18:28] amen and where you should go and what
[18:30] you should do amen praise God I believe
[18:33] that with all my heart amen that's why
[18:35] the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom
[18:38] of God
[18:39] and his righteousness and and then all
[18:41] these other things shall be added unto
[18:43] you amen some a couple of verses here
[18:46] where where the Lord talks about
[18:48] absolute truth he says in John 3 33 he
[18:52] that he that hath received his testimony
[18:55] amen hath set to his seal that God is
[18:59] true amen
[19:01] in Psalm 119 89-91 and verse 160 says
[19:05] forever O Lord Thy word is settled
[19:09] settled in heaven amen amen
[19:12] you know there are settlements in in
[19:15] business
[19:16] settlements in court amen when things
[19:19] are settled they're supposed to not even
[19:21] they're settled not even brought up
[19:23] anymore there's no question about it
[19:25] anymore
[19:26] amen it's settled forever forever in
[19:31] God's eyes forever Lord Thy word is
[19:33] settled in heaven thy faithfulness is
[19:35] unto all generations
[19:38] thou Hast established the Earth and it
[19:42] abideth amen
[19:44] praise the Lord Jesus
[19:46] they will never move it it shall stand
[19:49] amen
[19:50] what God created from the beginning it
[19:52] doesn't change
[19:54] amen I like what brother Michael was
[19:56] bringing about the the North Star last
[19:58] last last last Sunday amen the North
[20:01] Star amen it never it never moves it's
[20:05] always there and even the pyramids Amen
[20:07] in in different different pyramids
[20:10] around the world and things like that
[20:11] they Point always and they to the North
[20:14] Star because the North Star is always
[20:16] constant yes it never changes amen it's
[20:20] always firm amen
[20:22] and watch what David continues saying
[20:25] here in verse 91 they continue this day
[20:27] amen according to thy ordinances
[20:31] amen for all for all are thy servants

[21:30] rain water is wet

[21:54] the the
[21:55] you know there's there's laws in nature
[21:57] and then if you go against those laws
[21:59] amen nature will rebel against you
[22:02] because nature wants to obey the
[22:05] original creator
[22:06] not what man thinks about it not what
[22:09] NASA thinks about it amen it's what God
[22:11] said about it amen and what God said
[22:14] about it from the beginning amen I'd
[22:15] rather believe that

[22:20] that's what nature does Amen it listens
[22:22] to its original Creator yes and doesn't
[22:25] listen to man's opinions or whatever
[22:27] they say about about CR about creation
[22:29] so
[22:31] and so
[22:33] and so it's the same thing with human
[22:34] with with standards amen with men and
[22:37] women there must be standards upon which
[22:38] human life is based standards that if
[22:42] followed create peace and Harmony and
[22:43] order in relationships amen
[22:46] there must be you know two men in a fish
[22:48] in a ship is called Fellowship amen
[22:52] you know uh I listen to you and you
[22:54] listen to me and that's how we have
[22:55] Fellowship
[22:57] but when somebody's taking over a
[22:58] conversation there's no Fellowship there
[23:00] it's just constantly just talking and
[23:03] talking and talking and talking and you
[23:04] and you can't bring your your what you
[23:07] want to say out there's no Fellowship in
[23:09] that there's no relationship there amen
[23:12] don't you just hate that
[23:15] when somebody just keeps talking and
[23:18] talking and they don't stop
[23:19] you know that's just me I don't know
[23:21] about that I want to get something in
[23:23] there too
[23:24] you know I want to say something your
[23:27] your thoughts are make are sparking
[23:29] things in my mind that I want to share
[23:30] with you too that's what Fellowship is
[23:33] but when somebody's all up in your face
[23:35] just talking the whole time
[23:38] like all right let's take a break
[23:42] right but don't no matter how much we
[23:44] argue about these laws and about these
[23:47] things amen it doesn't change anything
[23:50] that's right they're established
[23:53] they can fuss and fight and argue and
[23:55] change their their their bodies foreign
[23:59] and you can't deny that no matter how
[24:03] much a woman I told my my wife the other
[24:05] day and we're almost done here we did at
[24:07] 10 15 or 10 20 by the way I'm sorry
[24:10] what time do we stop
[24:12] 10 15 okay we got one minute no matter
[24:15] how much
[24:17] no matter how much a woman tries to try
[24:21] to become a man or change her look the
[24:24] way there's no denying that you look
[24:26] that woman from far away and you can you
[24:28] can see that that that that that that's
[24:30] a woman
[24:31] same thing with a man amen there's no
[24:34] they're not because the God's footprint
[24:36] is there
[24:37] you go see God's footprint is there
[24:41] praise God
[24:42] so and that and then the the in Psalms
[24:45] chapter 119 verse 160 Thy word is true
[24:49] from the beginning
[24:50] and every one of thy righteous judgments
[24:52] endureth forever
[24:54] amen Proverbs 12 19 says the lip of true
[24:58] shall be established forever but a lying
[25:00] tongue is but of is but for a moment
[25:03] amen so all the the lies that we hear
[25:06] nowadays amen that's only for a moment
[25:09] amen God's word abideth forever the
[25:12] grass Isaiah 48 the grass
[25:15] withereth the flower fadeth
[25:17] but the word of our God shall stand
[25:20] forever
[25:21] amen and in Romans 3 3 4 we'll just
[25:24] we'll just finish with this amen for
[25:26] what if some did not believe shall their
[25:28] unbelief make the faith of God without
[25:30] effect God forbid yea let God be true
[25:34] but every man a liar Amen Let God be
[25:39] true
[25:40] I don't know I'm in society tells me
[25:43] that I should believe it this way Amen
[25:45] Let God be true this is the only book
[25:49] that has that has lasted the the test of
[25:52] time is the number one sold book in the
[25:54] world
[25:55] and people have tried to destroy this
[25:57] thing this book in many different
[26:00] countries and yet we still have copies
[26:02] of it somehow it has survived
[26:05] I don't think that's by coincidence I
[26:07] think God did that amen
[26:10] so so that's that's where I'm gonna
[26:13] anchor my soul on and if God sends me to
[26:16] Hell amen because I've anchored his soul
[26:18] my soul on this book then God was
[26:21] righteous in doing that
[26:24] because that's that's this is where I
[26:26] stand amen so let's make sure that we
[26:29] are anchored and absolute let's have the
[26:31] musicians come
