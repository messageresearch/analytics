[26:46] Bob is actually at brother Andre's uh
[26:48] preaching today so um just want to give
[26:51] you a little uh update on the relief
[26:54] effort um our website now has a link to
[26:59] the word of life and Bible Believers I
[27:01] think they got it somewhere they pull it
[27:03] up so what we're going to do is and as a
[27:08] church and brother Andre will reiterate
[27:11] this because he's been up there and his
[27:13] wife's been up there they're right in
[27:15] the middle of it um the best thing for
[27:18] us to do is send
[27:21] money if we go up there we're just going
[27:23] to be
[27:24] a third wheel fifth wheel they're going
[27:28] to have to take care of you they're
[27:29] going to have to feed you they're going
[27:30] to have if you got something to take up
[27:32] there take it up there and get back home
[27:34] but it's going to take you about 5 and a
[27:36] half hours to get there going from here
[27:40] brother Andre and his wife are leaving
[27:41] right after service today and um they're
[27:44] heading on up there because they live
[27:46] there they know and the people in The
[27:47] Word of Life they know who needs the
[27:49] thing it's well coordinated those are
[27:51] the two um links for Word of Life
[27:56] Johnson City and they've got several
[27:58] hundred people working uh brother
[28:00] Michael Bailey is uh I just wrote him a
[28:03] check from the church for $1,000 prise
[28:05] the
[28:07] Lord y'all did it I didn't for to send
[28:11] to get fun to get things water and
[28:14] things that they can buy up there that
[28:16] we don't need to take from here now
[28:19] brother brother Andre we've been talking
[28:20] about this just it's the best thing to
[28:22] do is to send them money so if you have
[28:25] there's a link there this is the one for
[28:28] Hickory Bible Tabernacle we're going to
[28:29] send them some too and then we're going
[28:31] to take up an offering here in just a
[28:32] minute for the vision books but they
[28:34] know what they're doing so let's let
[28:37] them do what they know what to do
[28:39] because as what as we were talking if I
[28:41] were to go up there then that people
[28:43] want to talk and people you know you're
[28:45] a different per you're you're you're not
[28:46] in their community so if you got
[28:48] something send money send money because
[28:51] if you don't you're going to have to
[28:52] find a place to stay you going to have
[28:53] to find all these different things just
[28:55] let them worry about it we'll send them
[28:57] money we'll send the money from here and
[28:59] if you have anything to give go there to
[29:02] venmo the word of life's church and then
[29:05] we're going to give some to Hickory
[29:06] Bible Tabernacle today but just remember
[29:09] that this is going to be an ongoing
[29:11] thing it's going to take up to a year
[29:14] for some of them to even get back to
[29:17] normaly a year amen some have no power
[29:21] still some have power brother Joe Green
[29:24] said they just got power this morning uh

[29:31] where brother Andre lives the bridges
[29:33] are gone in places and it's going to be
[29:36] a year before they get them Bill back so
[29:39] they're going to have to go home today
[29:40] because they're starting tomorrow being
[29:43] up there with them because he lives
[29:44] there in Irwin and and the nich Chucky
[29:45] river is not but a mile or so from his
[29:47] house so he was right I mean he was up
[29:49] high but it was right there close to his

[44:34] to be with you to worship with you this
[44:37] morning and as brother Wade said we came
[44:40] over yesterday afternoon we want to
[44:43] thank God uh for the wonderful

[44:48] had 45 years and I know she got a lot of
[44:52] patience you know God God bless her God
[44:56] bless I see her over there she's a
[44:58] beautiful lady and she yeah yeah you
[45:01] know and so we want to thank the Lord
[45:05] for them and they're just having a good
[45:08] time together even despite in spite all
[45:12] the the weather and the road closing
[45:15] they got to come together and speak and
[45:19] and it's always a beautiful time when
[45:22] brother Brandy said in that message
[45:23] kinsman's Redeemer when a woman finds a
[45:26] man and loves him it doesn't matter what
[45:29] he looks like but she loves him and he
[45:32] loves her he said that had no beginning
[45:35] it started in glory and he said it won't
[45:38] have an ending being pretty and putting
[45:41] on Max Factor and all those things you
[45:44] have to wash that off reassign and put
[45:47] it on again but that real beauty that
[45:50] comes from the car for the heart that
[45:53] beauty there and so we're certainly
[45:56] happy for precious brother I'm going to
[45:58] have us read Lord willing here in uh
[46:01] Philippians chapter 4 just a couple of
[46:03] vers have you be seated after that and
[46:06] then we'll just kind of go over some
[46:08] things that are happening and then we'll
[46:10] get right into the word we're not I'm
[46:12] not alone windy preacher so don't worry
[46:15] about two hours no I'm just kidding with
[46:17] you so in Philippians chapter 4 we saw
[46:21] brother brother Aaron Roberts brother
[46:23] Aaron and Sister Sarah and their group
[46:26] there they're so precious we love them
[46:28] in Irwin Tennessee and uh brother Aaron
[46:32] was with us him and his family a couple
[46:34] of weeks ago they've always been a great
[46:36] blessing always challenging in us and we
[46:39] thank them and look forward to their
[46:41] coming again also brother brother Bob's
[46:43] there that's right him and his wife his
[46:46] and two of his girls they there in Irwin
[46:49] uh this morning and and they had a good
[46:51] trip up yesterday and also brother Luis
[46:54] uro I know brother Luis from many years
[46:57] when his family first came from um from
[47:00] medine Colombia and so he's uh we we'
[47:04] spent some time together in Mexico and
[47:06] different places uh him being my
[47:09] interpreter and so God bless him and
[47:11] Sister Christina and there two precious
[47:14] girls as uh they're out today and
[47:16] ministering there in North Carolina amen
[47:20] everybody should be there now
[47:21] Philippians chapter
[47:23] 4 this is the Apostle Paul this is one
[47:26] of the they call it prison epistle the
[47:29] Apostle Paul wrote this uh the book of
[47:32] uh Philippi while he was in prison he's
[47:35] dealing with the Christian experience
[47:38] but not the outward Christian experience
[47:40] he's dealing with the inward experience
[47:43] of the believer and growth in those
[47:45] things and so how we thankful to the
[47:47] Lord that the first church age messenger
[47:51] the Apostle Paul he's he's laying down a
[47:53] great principle for us and I I want us
[47:56] to catch that that and then we'll we'll
[47:58] talk about other things Philippians
[48:00] chapter 4 starting at verse
[48:02] 4 rejoice in the lord
[48:05] always and again I say
[48:09] rejoice let your moderations your
[48:12] gentleness your kindness be known unto
[48:15] all men the Lord is at hand The Lord Is
[48:19] With
[48:20] Us be careful for
[48:23] nothing when we think about the time and
[48:26] the season that we're living in we think
[48:29] about uh so much to try to have us to
[48:33] worry and to be depressed and anxiety
[48:37] and and worked over and all kind of
[48:40] different words that would go with that
[48:43] we want to have a strong defense in this
[48:46] hour we're not a defeated people we're
[48:50] Victorious People we were predestinated
[48:53] to stand for this hour once Jesus said
[48:57] in the scriptures in the Book of John
[49:00] should I pray that God would deliver me
[49:02] for for this hour came I into the world
[49:06] and so you and I you know we want to get
[49:08] out of here we want to get out of
[49:11] Satan's Eden we see and there's too much
[49:14] prophecy being brought to pass for us
[49:17] not to be approaching something you see
[49:20] these modern events made clear by
[49:22] prophecy and so when we see these things
[49:25] and see the V indicated word that God
[49:28] has given us in this hour God has always
[49:31] made a way for his children we can stand
[49:35] behind that fortified word of God let me
[49:38] say this with all the strength that I
[49:40] have we're not a religious people we are
[49:43] the sons and daughters of almighty God
[49:46] you see brother Brown said religion is
[49:48] just a covering Christianity is a new
[49:51] birth and so Paul says listen to him
[49:54] verse 6 he says now be careful be
[49:57] anxious for
[49:58] nothing but in everything not some
[50:02] things but in everything by
[50:05] prayer and supplications brother Andre
[50:08] what's that word supplication mean your
[50:10] petitions amen see by prayer and
[50:14] supplications with look at this recipe
[50:17] with
[50:18] Thanksgiving let your request be known
[50:21] unto God so prayer the power of prayer
[50:26] no matter what what you're going through
[50:27] you can bring that before God Satan
[50:30] would try to make you doubt God and
[50:32] doubt your trust in God and doubt who
[50:34] you are and doubt what God made you and
[50:37] and then you say well I have a right to
[50:40] worry but worry has no virtue at all no
[50:43] one ever said you know I overcame this
[50:46] because I worried about it I was so
[50:49] worried I was so anxious I was so
[50:54] unnerved I was so depressed that I
[50:57] overcome this no no no no no no faith is
[51:00] the victory faith in God faith in this
[51:04] word so y'all got me preaching before I
[51:07] wanted
[51:08] to so so let's read this so verse six
[51:13] again be careful for nothing be anxious
[51:15] don't be anxious but in everything not
[51:18] some things by prayer and
[51:21] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[51:25] request be made known unto God and the
[51:29] peace of God because that's what we want
[51:31] yes sir the peace of God which passes
[51:35] all understanding shall keep your heart
[51:40] shall guard your heart shall protect you
[51:43] from strokes and all these other things
[51:47] see yes they they it's going to take
[51:50] more than there's no mental medicine
[51:53] that has ever cured anyone and I'm not
[51:55] saying that many may be someone in here
[51:57] you say well brother Andre I have to
[51:59] take this psychotrophic drug I have to
[52:01] take paxel I have to take Ridin I have
[52:03] to take DEA code I have to take this and
[52:05] that those things when I worked with the
[52:07] Juvenile Justice of Georgia we had to
[52:10] deal with young people who were on those
[52:13] things so I'm not here to knock those
[52:15] things but I am here to say there is a
[52:18] God that can take care of that see that
[52:22] can give you power that can guard your
[52:26] heart not religion can't do it but God
[52:30] can do it you see so we being the bride
[52:33] of Christ God didn't leave us to that
[52:37] second realm of uh uh reasoning emotion
[52:41] memory all those things we have a
[52:44] revelation of the Soul so Paul goes on
[52:47] down he says and the peace of God which
[52:48] passes all understanding shall keep your
[52:51] hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus
[52:54] finally Brethren whatsoever Things Are
[52:56] true whatsoever things are honest
[52:59] whatsoever things are just whatsoever
[53:01] things are pure whatsoever things are
[53:04] lovely whatsoever things are of good
[53:07] report if there be any virtue if there
[53:10] be any praise think on these things
[53:13] those things which ye have both learned
[53:16] and received and heard and seen of me
[53:20] do he says and the God of Peace shall be
[53:24] with you may the Lord add his Blessing
[53:26] reading of his word you may be
[53:29] seated again my wife and I we're so
[53:31] grateful and thankful to be with you and

[55:23] going to be with us I don't know what
[55:25] day he's going to come up and be with
[55:26] with us there in Irwin Tennessee the
[55:28] Believers in Irwin they send greetings
[55:30] too I was in be you know brother Joseph
[55:33] and I the Lord spoke to our hearts in
[55:36] Soo Canyon uh many years ago about the
[55:39] ministry and sent us to venezuel and
[55:42] those things and so I I only said that
[55:46] so that you know that God gave us the
[55:49] opportunity to do missionary work for 20
[55:52] 25 26 years uh all through Venezuela and
[55:55] the jungle of
[55:57] Venezuela uh down the different Rivers
[55:59] we spent time on the oronoko river uh on
[56:03] the Amazon River and I don't mean going
[56:06] out for two or three days months and
[56:08] months at a time living with the Indians
[56:11] the peor the wah heos the yanam mamies
[56:14] the kakas those Indians there who we
[56:17] have come to love and appreciate so more
[56:19] and then God you know uh he kind of
[56:22] Switched us up now we've been pastoring
[56:25] for a while about five or six years
[56:27] we've known the Believers there in irn
[56:29] but uh there's a island there's quite a
[56:32] few islands in the Granada Dean Islands
[56:35] I lived in Grenada for a while working
[56:38] with the church there and while I was
[56:40] there I went over to a smaller island
[56:42] called Beck Beck and while I was there
[56:46] uh a sister came from one of the
[56:48] churches in Beck I think there's two
[56:50] churches there and she says brother
[56:52] Andre I know who your pastor is the way
[56:55] you preach I know
[56:57] and I said who is my pastor she said
[56:58] Samuel Dale I know that's your pastor
[57:01] I've got tapes of brother Dale and so
[57:03] when I heard you and and the other night
[57:06] uh speaking on predestination I knew
[57:09] where you had learned those things from
[57:11] I said yes I did I I did learn those
[57:13] things from brother brother Dale he's
[57:16] he's been a great foundation and and so
[57:18] I thought she wasn't streaming she had a
[57:22] cassette and I thought sister you she
[57:25] said I got this tape from someone else
[57:28] and so that showed me that God has sent
[57:31] brother Dale's Ministry all over the
[57:33] world you see and we thank God for men
[57:37] like that men that love the word that
[57:39] are dedicated to the word that loves
[57:41] God's people we want to say that sister
[57:44] Peggy we love you and we appreciate you
[57:46] so much and sister Peggy right there
[57:48] with her husband all the time supporting
[57:51] him and I know that there's coming a
[57:54] time you've all know it that
[57:56] uh she'll be seeing that young man and
[57:59] he'll see that young lady and and how
[58:02] God has these things in his own economy
[58:05] but we thank God for sister Peggy
[58:08] staying there with her husband holding
[58:10] him up and even the last months of
[58:14] before God took him home her and and
[58:17] brother Wade and all the family sister
[58:18] Anna and all of you there brother Terren
[58:21] and all of you there uh with your dad
[58:24] and I thought that was love
[58:26] and we appreciate you doing that again
[58:30] brother Dale was a man that was
[58:33] dedicated to the word of God brother
[58:36] Wade took me in his office before uh
[58:39] brother Dale went to be with the Lord
[58:41] and I got to see those books and bibles
[58:44] and and yeah worn worn out like the
[58:48] colored man said from ker to ker a worn
[58:51] out and the ker and the ker and so we
[58:55] thank the Lord I wanted to say that I
[58:57] want to thank sister Peggy for just
[59:00] being the lovely lady that she is and
[59:02] we're we're holding you up you know they
[59:05] tell us real quick they tell us in the
[59:07] uh in the world today that loneliness
[59:11] it's an epidemic in this country and I
[59:16] thought it was beautiful brother Wade
[59:17] was sharing with me how that he talks to
[59:20] you know the widows and how are you
[59:23] doing what's going on with you and I'm
[59:25] the same way we've got three widows in
[59:27] the church and on Thursdays we go with
[59:31] sister trig there it's her uh morning we
[59:34] uh we have the sausage and pancakes with
[59:37] her and and then the other two widows
[59:40] there sister Charlotte who was brother
[59:42] Charles Lee Johnson's wife and then
[59:44] sister Dorothy there so we make sure to
[59:47] try to get them flowers every other
[59:49] month and and we love our widows and
[59:52] things and so uh if you have opportunity
[59:55] uh uh remember the widows here also it's
[59:59] it's a beautiful thing to to let them
[1:00:02] know hey you're not alone now now now
[1:00:05] I've learned over the years when it
[1:00:07] comes to loneliness you can be in a
[1:00:09] crowd of hundreds of people and still be
[1:00:12] lonely now you
[1:00:15] see but I'm thankful that we've got God
[1:00:18] a god with skin on
[1:00:21] him god with skin y'all remember the
[1:00:24] story right little boy running down down
[1:00:26] and said mother it's thundering in
[1:00:28] lightning and and I'm afraid she said
[1:00:30] you don't have to be afraid Little
[1:00:33] Johnny we're Christians everything's
[1:00:35] going to work out he said you're right
[1:00:38] mother and he went back upstairs and the
[1:00:41] lightning got
[1:00:43] stronger and he ran back down he says
[1:00:46] mother I know we're Christian family I
[1:00:48] know that and I know God is real but
[1:00:51] mother I need a god with
[1:00:53] skin and we need to be that god with
[1:00:57] skin and so we just thank the Lord for
[1:01:01] that you've heard and we want to
[1:01:04] reiterate uh what brother Wade was
[1:01:06] saying about uh the flood here the 27th
[1:01:10] of last month when the the hurricane
[1:01:14] Helen hit uh uh Tennessee there Irwin
[1:01:18] and those places and the the destruction
[1:01:23] is is unbelievable I mean I mean just
[1:01:26] pure destruction the force of water when
[1:01:31] you see water just go and
[1:01:34] Destroy very
[1:01:36] catastrophic another word that we've
[1:01:39] been used to hearing
[1:01:42] unprecedented and so these things when
[1:01:44] it hit uh Irwin it just tore everything
[1:01:48] up you may have watched or saw on the
[1:01:51] YouTube how they were evacuating the
[1:01:53] hospitals and they had a lot of
[1:01:55] helicopter
[1:01:56] coming down they the water was rushing
[1:01:59] with such a a force that it came down
[1:02:03] into the uh to Irwin there from the
[1:02:06] noichi river and anything in its path
[1:02:10] trees cars building it didn't matter it
[1:02:13] just destroyed and you have to see that
[1:02:16] destruction you can hear about it maybe
[1:02:19] you can watch it but until you really
[1:02:22] are physically
[1:02:24] there and see that kind of Devastation
[1:02:28] and see what the force of nature when
[1:02:31] it's
[1:02:32] Unleashed uh that it that it will do and
[1:02:35] so you know the hospital there in Irwin
[1:02:38] I don't even know why they built the
[1:02:41] house and in an area like that obviously
[1:02:44] you know I wouldn't have built in the
[1:02:47] flood zone but but they did and so it
[1:02:50] just destroyed the whole well I say
[1:02:53] destroyed it flooded out the whole
[1:02:54] hospital they had to get get the
[1:02:56] patients over 60 on the roof and then
[1:02:59] they had the the Blackhawk helicopters
[1:03:01] to come in and individual from the the
[1:03:05] National Guard from the different Rescue
[1:03:07] all the way from Virginia to come in or
[1:03:09] would have uh taken those lives and so
[1:03:13] you
[1:03:14] know up in the mountains I can't tell
[1:03:17] you the people who live in the mountains
[1:03:19] whether Rich it didn't discriminate if
[1:03:22] you had a cabin big house how much money
[1:03:24] you had it didn't ask it just woof and
[1:03:30] we found out that there was a reservoir
[1:03:32] that was built higher the mountain the
[1:03:35] highest mountain around there is called
[1:03:37] uh unoy Mountain but uh there was
[1:03:41] uh a a reservoir that was built over
[1:03:45] near Mount
[1:03:46] Mitchell and when they built this
[1:03:48] Reservoir to hold so much
[1:03:51] water they never believ that it would
[1:03:54] break
[1:03:56] but it but it did and when it broke it
[1:03:59] just sent water down on the North
[1:04:01] Carolina side I don't know who all have
[1:04:03] ever visited Chimney Rock before all
[1:04:06] that air Lake Lure all that that's
[1:04:09] gone and people who live there they just
[1:04:12] shade their heads there's no words to
[1:04:14] describe it and so it destroyed there's
[1:04:17] some people haven't even got power yet
[1:04:20] not just in that area I'm surprised that
[1:04:22] areas that you would never thought had
[1:04:24] lost power I even brother Burley
[1:04:27] Williams called me a couple well about a
[1:04:29] week or so week and a half ago he lives
[1:04:32] in Anderson South
[1:04:34] Carolina and he said brother we ain't
[1:04:36] have power we running generators I said
[1:04:38] you got to be kidding he said no we're
[1:04:40] not kidding we're running generators and
[1:04:43] so the the power grid that has been
[1:04:47] affected the the the tel
[1:04:50] commmunication the towers that were
[1:04:52] knocked down and and you know uh brother
[1:04:56] Wade and I he because I was coming and
[1:04:59] wanted to make some contact the the the
[1:05:03] communication our phone was not working
[1:05:05] it's now it's still spotty the
[1:05:08] communication the connection and so it
[1:05:11] tore the towers down it contaminated our
[1:05:15] water processing and all the water you
[1:05:18] had to boil it until a couple of days or
[1:05:20] so and still I mean I was going to ask
[1:05:23] him what about the rust in our pipes
[1:05:25] they they don't want to go there they
[1:05:27] don't want to go there so people are
[1:05:31] hurting and bridges I mean we used to
[1:05:34] walk across the the bridge there at a
[1:05:37] place called uncle Johnny's that's where
[1:05:39] the Appalachian tra I mean a con
[1:05:42] industrial bridge and when they told me
[1:05:45] no the bridge that goes at a place
[1:05:48] called chesto that bridge is I said no I
[1:05:50] don't believe that I got to see that you
[1:05:53] know I'm a Believer but something no I
[1:05:55] got to see that now come on now so when
[1:05:58] I went down and I saw that the whole
[1:06:01] Bridge
[1:06:02] gone gone gone I mean you could drive
[1:06:04] tractors everything across the bridge
[1:06:07] wide Bridge It just knocked that bridge
[1:06:10] and then on 107 on down the gentleman
[1:06:13] out there he's videoing and the the
[1:06:15] water just takes it he said look look
[1:06:18] here the bridge is
[1:06:20] going and so you know the devastation
[1:06:24] when you think of the flood
[1:06:26] brother Wade was sharing with me when
[1:06:28] you think of the flood that struck the
[1:06:31] andian
[1:06:33] flood how it created the Grand Canyon
[1:06:36] from that flood how it changed the
[1:06:39] course of the four rivers that came out
[1:06:42] of the Garden of Eden and and the the
[1:06:47] and the whole climate as far as that we
[1:06:49] see how the Earth was on a beautiful 78
[1:06:53] 77 degree tropical
[1:06:56] climate but when that brother brandham
[1:06:59] says when the Earth was pushed away from
[1:07:02] the Sun and created brought an ice age
[1:07:05] in and that's why even archaeologists
[1:07:08] are able to find you know Plants and
[1:07:12] Things That should be we would only see
[1:07:15] near the equator they are pulling th
[1:07:17] those things so when you think of that
[1:07:20] Mighty thing and and I don't want to
[1:07:22] hold you on this but uh you know know we
[1:07:26] are thankful for the word of Life
[1:07:28] brother Donnie Reagan and those Brothers
[1:07:31] up there they're working and sisters
[1:07:35] they're working I mean they're putting
[1:07:37] in hours to give the
[1:07:41] donations money and and the different
[1:07:44] things they know the needs of the people
[1:07:45] because they're going out they're
[1:07:48] actually going out with their four-wheel
[1:07:50] drives they're going up Mountains
[1:07:51] they're going in places where people
[1:07:53] said hey we didn't even even know that
[1:07:57] anyone knew we were up here starving to
[1:07:59] death and without
[1:08:01] water and they Mountain City going up
[1:08:04] Mountain City uh he was telling us
[1:08:07] brother Matthew was telling us
[1:08:11] that uh brother Michael and brother
[1:08:14] Michael's name last name is Bailey
[1:08:16] brother Michael and brother Michael was
[1:08:18] telling me brother Andre some of the
[1:08:20] people the only water they have is what
[1:08:22] they had in their swimming pool that's
[1:08:24] the water that they're drinking and
[1:08:25] brushing their teeth with and because
[1:08:28] even the water from the river is just so
[1:08:31] contaminated or to get down to the river
[1:08:34] so you know sometimes we think well they
[1:08:37] can just go down to the word of life or
[1:08:40] wherever and no no no you ain't got no
[1:08:43] passage to go down and and you don't
[1:08:45] want to go down it's slippery wet it's
[1:08:48] dangerous and so uh brother Mike and the
[1:08:52] those Brothers at the Word of Life
[1:08:55] they've got got it charted out they've
[1:08:56] got a command center they've got it
[1:08:59] marked the places they've been and they
[1:09:01] also have you know they've taken tax and
[1:09:05] and now they're putting all this
[1:09:08] information on their uh on their
[1:09:10] spreadsheets and things like that to
[1:09:13] know who is receiving this who's
[1:09:16] receiving that what did they receive did
[1:09:18] we get a call back from them etc etc and
[1:09:21] so when you begin to now in 199 three I
[1:09:26] worked with the Salvation Army and I wor
[1:09:28] I was the disaster relief in maretta
[1:09:32] Georgia they sent me down to Dade County
[1:09:34] and I worked Hurricane Andrew I was
[1:09:36] there a couple of weeks and so I know a
[1:09:40] little bit I worked with
[1:09:43] FEMA you know I ain't saying nothing
[1:09:45] negative on
[1:09:46] anybody I work with the Red Cross ain't
[1:09:50] something nothing negative about them
[1:09:53] but thank God I got to work with the
[1:09:54] Salvation Army
[1:09:55] and so yeah that's a great organization
[1:09:57] Salvation Army they they helping people
[1:10:00] so I only said that to say some of those
[1:10:03] agencies like
[1:10:05] FEMA we've got sister at at the church
[1:10:09] there sister Caroline her mother's
[1:10:12] house her mother's her sister her niece
[1:10:16] their homes were swept in the river the
[1:10:19] water came down rose up and just took
[1:10:22] them off their foundations so by the
[1:10:25] Grace of the Lord the church back home
[1:10:27] we're working with those three families
[1:10:29] to to say hey we're with you to totally
[1:10:33] we're not going to abandon you and so we
[1:10:35] thought well we'll get the governor of
[1:10:37] Tennessee he's a good Governor there
[1:10:40] Bill Lee he came by and he saw the
[1:10:43] destruction what happened he couldn't
[1:10:44] believe it and so the people were asking
[1:10:47] what about FEMA FEMA is the Federal
[1:10:49] Emergency Man uh management association
[1:10:52] and FEMA they told the people there
[1:10:55] we don't have any
[1:10:57] money you mean one of the second
[1:11:00] worst national natural disaster in the
[1:11:04] United States and you don't have any
[1:11:09] money what happened to all those
[1:11:11] billions y'all are lated every year by
[1:11:14] the the Congress and well they said they
[1:11:19] ain't up here to accuse
[1:11:22] anyone but when you see how people are
[1:11:25] hurt
[1:11:26] and so I again I'd like to reiterate as
[1:11:29] what it's easier
[1:11:31] logistical to send
[1:11:34] money the money's going to the Word of
[1:11:37] Life Church brother Mike and I was
[1:11:40] sitting in the office just a moment
[1:11:42] ago with my my notes and things brother
[1:11:47] Wade laid a check down there I know he
[1:11:48] want send the check when I saw the
[1:11:50] amount of it the amount of I was like
[1:11:53] wow man that's beautiful he wrote a
[1:11:57] check out for $1,000 from your church
[1:12:00] here and so I've got that to take to
[1:12:03] brother Mike there brother Mike Bailey
[1:12:06] and give it to them and uh told Brother
[1:12:09] Wade I'm going to have brother Mike to
[1:12:11] call him and to you know I know brother
[1:12:15] Mike's going to thank him and then ask
[1:12:17] him uh brother Michael share what other
[1:12:20] needs and how they're working to to do
[1:12:23] those things and so if if you're
[1:12:25] thinking about going up which I don't
[1:12:28] think it it's better to send money right
[1:12:31] it it's it's it is more wisdom because
[1:12:35] that way they can take that money and
[1:12:38] they know how to appropriate it where
[1:12:40] it's supposed to go what
[1:12:43] supplies and you may have things and you
[1:12:46] know like they said you can get online
[1:12:48] there and you can order something by
[1:12:51] prime or anything have it sent there so
[1:12:54] now
[1:12:55] with people coming in sometimes because
[1:12:58] they want to try to accommodate you and
[1:13:00] things like that and they got their
[1:13:02] hands full already hands full it's like
[1:13:04] brother thank you all for coming thank
[1:13:06] you for being here but next time uh if
[1:13:08] you'll send money it's easier and and
[1:13:11] and you just talked to Mike on those
[1:13:13] things and so you know when I went up
[1:13:16] there and I saw we're just uh we're down
[1:13:18] the road in Irwin there in Johnson City
[1:13:21] and I thought well with some of my
[1:13:23] experience of working with FEMA if that
[1:13:25] counted for anything I mean not just fem
[1:13:27] I'm a wildland firefighter also fight
[1:13:30] fires in the mountains I'm I'm uh I went
[1:13:33] to school for that at ETSU and so uh you
[1:13:37] know when you see that kind of
[1:13:39] coordination their
[1:13:41] coordination is better than any other uh
[1:13:45] organizations that's there for all kind
[1:13:48] of
[1:13:49] reasons when you see the suffering of
[1:13:52] people sometimes y I know this might be
[1:13:54] hard to believe but sometimes people
[1:13:56] take advantage of people and so how we
[1:13:59] thank the Lord when somebody asked me
[1:14:01] the other day what about the group up a
[1:14:02] Word of Life I said brother you dealing
[1:14:04] with the hand of God now ain't nobody
[1:14:06] trying to take nothing from
[1:14:07] you if these people come to you that's
[1:14:10] like that's God coming to
[1:14:12] you so you thank God if you you know if
[1:14:15] they call you or say hey so do that pray
[1:14:18] for them uh the they have the fellowship
[1:14:22] hall it's humongous they've got things
[1:14:25] staged all over and the people are
[1:14:27] coming in but it's not listen now it's
[1:14:30] not the people coming in
[1:14:32] because 90% of the people can't come in
[1:14:35] right so they've got it coordinated in
[1:14:38] the evening and afternoons that
[1:14:40] different Brothers they go different
[1:14:42] places and they deliver the supplies so
[1:14:46] it's not them you know saying okay y'all
[1:14:49] come y'all come now they're going to the
[1:14:51] highways and the byways and all these
[1:14:53] places to deliver
[1:14:55] those things so it's when I told my wife
[1:14:58] how beautiful it is the bride of Christ
[1:15:01] doesn't matter where she's at who she is
[1:15:04] uh she's always interested in the
[1:15:07] well-being of people and so y'all get
[1:15:10] together well I can't tell you that I

[1:20:28] whatever confused or say brother Andre
[1:20:30] I'm going through S circumstance
[1:20:32] situation God you specialize in things
[1:20:35] thought to be
[1:20:36] impossible and Lord we are believers
[1:20:39] Lord and we believe your word father
[1:20:42] open up your word to our hearts Lord and
[1:20:46] we'll give you glory for your wordy in
[1:20:49] Jesus name we pray amen if you have your
[1:20:52] Bibles let's turn over to Isaiah
[1:20:55] 59 so brother Andre we thought you was
[1:20:57] finished
[1:20:58] preaching one preaching Isaiah 59 thank
[1:21:02] you musicians God bless you
[1:21:07] all we've been speaking a while on
[1:21:12] Redemption
[1:21:14] and we've been reading that wonderful
[1:21:16] message brother brandham talked about
[1:21:18] the kinsman's
[1:21:20] Redeemer talking about Ruth and four
[1:21:23] stages that there Ruth
[1:21:27] deciding when you begin to get into
[1:21:29] those messages brother Brian says now
[1:21:31] Ruth it's a lovely story but it's more
[1:21:34] than a love story you see it's it's a
[1:21:37] history but it's more than a history you
[1:21:40] see and so when we begin to see
[1:21:43] Redemption and Ruth the kinsman's
[1:21:46] Redeemer and we thank God that we had a
[1:21:48] prophet that was a typologist brother
[1:21:50] Brian he didn't lean on education and
[1:21:53] those things
[1:21:55] God showed him types and shadows and so
[1:21:58] he brought those things to us even when
[1:22:02] you begin to look at the ministry of Our
[1:22:04] Lord in the days of his flesh the Bible
[1:22:07] says that he spoke in Parable and
[1:22:10] without a parable he did not teach them
[1:22:13] you see so how thankful that when we see
[1:22:16] these types and
[1:22:18] shadows if it's a shadow before it can
[1:22:21] be a shadow light has to strike the
[1:22:26] object you cannot have I'm not going to
[1:22:29] keep standing but you cannot have a a
[1:22:32] negative without a positive brother
[1:22:35] brandham says here in this 16 element
[1:22:39] body this is the negative but because
[1:22:42] what has happened to your heart the
[1:22:44] reality of God has brought you to a New
[1:22:47] Birth then somewhere there is a positive
[1:22:51] and we're only reflecting
[1:22:54] right that here in this Dimension just
[1:22:57] like the stars and the sun when God
[1:23:00] created them in Genesis there the the
[1:23:03] Stars the planets they have not their
[1:23:06] own light they are
[1:23:08] reflecting light the Seven Stars that
[1:23:11] Jesus had in his right hand they did not
[1:23:15] have their own light they were
[1:23:16] reflecting the light of the Sun and
[1:23:19] we're thankful to God that we have
[1:23:22] become that light not the fourth person
[1:23:25] I told somebody I ain't the fourth
[1:23:27] person in the
[1:23:29] Trinity no no but reflecting something
[1:23:34] someone's watching you influence someone
[1:23:37] is watching you and seeing what you're
[1:23:40] doing and and you're reflecting
[1:23:41] something but as a Christian you're
[1:23:44] reflecting God Jesus said and when he
[1:23:47] was speaking the parables in Matthew
[1:23:49] Chapter 5 he said you are the salt of
[1:23:52] the earth and if salt loses SA what good
[1:23:55] is it it preserves also Jesus goes on
[1:23:58] and says now ye are the light of the
[1:24:01] world and so we're thankful that that
[1:24:04] light that's in our heart because God
[1:24:07] has three Thrones right right Spirit
[1:24:09] throne in Jesus Christ in the bride and
[1:24:12] in in your heart he has a throne
[1:24:16] reflecting that great light and so how
[1:24:18] thankful we are for those things in
[1:24:21] Isaiah are y'all there 59
[1:24:24] verse 19 I gave you a little time to get
[1:24:29] there and we'll start
[1:24:32] here Isaiah 59 and we'll start at verse
[1:24:36] 19 so shall they fear the name of the
[1:24:40] Lord from the West that's the setting of
[1:24:43] the Sun the going down and His glory
[1:24:46] from the rising of the Sun the East when
[1:24:49] the enemy shall come in like a flood the
[1:24:52] spirit of the Lord shall
[1:24:54] lift up a standard against
[1:24:58] it and the
[1:25:01] Redeemer oh my shall come to Zion now
[1:25:06] when we look at Zion and and Jerusalem
[1:25:09] and New Jerusalem there's a spiritual
[1:25:11] Zion and there's a natural Zion there's
[1:25:15] a creation that's the New Jerusalem and
[1:25:18] then we have the natural Jerusalem that
[1:25:20] New Jerusalem that city is where MDC
[1:25:24] came came from the Heavenly Jerusalem
[1:25:26] Paul says that when he speaks in Hebrews
[1:25:30] so you and I are part of Zion and the
[1:25:33] New Jerusalem all these compound
[1:25:36] meanings you see this is where God wants
[1:25:38] to dwell God wants to dwell in Zion you
[1:25:42] see God wants to dwell in his people
[1:25:46] that's his City you see so he says here
[1:25:49] and the Redeemer the kinsman's Redeemer
[1:25:52] shall come to Zion andto that uh and
[1:25:56] unto them that turn from transgression
[1:25:59] in Jacob sayeth the Lord as for me this
[1:26:03] is my Covenant this is a covenant that
[1:26:05] he gave with Abraham that's our covenant
[1:26:08] you see and this in Genesis 15 you know
[1:26:11] those things as for me this is my
[1:26:13] Covenant with them sayth the Lord my
[1:26:17] spirit that is upon thee and my words
[1:26:20] which I have put in thy mouth shall not
[1:26:22] depart out of thy mouth nor out of the
[1:26:25] mouth of thy seed not seed seed nor out
[1:26:29] of the mouth of thy seed seed sayth the
[1:26:33] Lord from henceforth and forever
[1:26:36] arise Shine for thy light is come and
[1:26:40] the glory of the Lord is risen upon thee
[1:26:44] amen for Behold The Darkness shall cover
[1:26:47] the Earth and gross Darkness the people
[1:26:50] but the Lord shall rise upon thee and
[1:26:54] his glory shall be seen upon thee and
[1:26:56] the Gentiles shall come to thy light and
[1:27:00] the Kings to the brightness of thy
[1:27:02] Rising may the Lord add His blessings to
[1:27:04] the reading of his holy and precious
[1:27:06] word you may be
[1:27:10] seated how thankful we
[1:27:12] are in this hour that the the word of
[1:27:16] God it becomes personalized to us as you
[1:27:19] know God deals with Israel as a nation
[1:27:23] right but when he deals with the G
[1:27:26] Gentiles that's us he deals with us as
[1:27:30] individuals amen God deals that way he's
[1:27:34] a god of
[1:27:35] variety I remember when we were out west
[1:27:38] and Brother Joseph and his beloved wife
[1:27:42] they were getting married and I didn't
[1:27:45] have a shirt or something I W married
[1:27:48] then there you okay I wouldn't say that
[1:27:51] I didn't have no shirt or something in
[1:27:52] my wife here now good good
[1:27:56] so I didn't have a shirt to wear to the
[1:27:59] wedding and we went to the JC Pennies
[1:28:02] out there in in New
[1:28:04] Mexico and so the I told the woman this
[1:28:07] ma'am this is what I need here and she
[1:28:09] said okay well about that time a guy he
[1:28:13] he walked up beside me he was taller
[1:28:15] than
[1:28:18] Michael and and I mean he was he was
[1:28:20] stretched
[1:28:24] and when she came back out here I am
[1:28:26] here he is here I
[1:28:28] am like brother Dale used to call Joseph
[1:28:31] mutton
[1:28:32] Jeff see ye and
[1:28:35] yang and when she came out she did one
[1:28:38] of these
[1:28:42] numbers and there was another guy
[1:28:45] standing out he said well that proves
[1:28:48] that God is a god of variety
[1:28:54] he is a god of
[1:28:56] variety and so many things and plants
[1:28:59] and flowers and mountains and things
[1:29:02] like that sometimes we have God in a
[1:29:06] box and we can't see the the big picture
[1:29:10] you see even though God wants us to see
[1:29:12] the big picture because God loves to be
[1:29:16] revealed he loves to show his great
[1:29:19] Majesty see Jesus said in my father's
[1:29:22] house are many mansions
[1:29:24] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:29:27] I go and prepare a place for you amen
[1:29:31] when we begin to look at these
[1:29:33] scriptures here and there's no way I
[1:29:35] mean that we could even justify just
[1:29:39] trying to share a half of scripture how
[1:29:43] rich is the word of God it just
[1:29:46] continues to unfold and it continues to
[1:29:49] unfold in our life as God leads us and
[1:29:52] guides us and and as we begin to follow
[1:29:56] the lord he begins to put questions in
[1:29:59] our heart listen
[1:30:01] now not questions in our
[1:30:04] minds because how many questions after
[1:30:08] questions after questions that we have
[1:30:10] in our mind see but when God comes
[1:30:14] listen to me now and he begins to
[1:30:18] place in our
[1:30:20] mind a question
[1:30:24] he's drawing us to himself right he is
[1:30:28] creating the desire that's it amen see
[1:30:33] now I'm not talking about theology I got
[1:30:34] enough theology books at home come on
[1:30:36] brother I'm not trying to bring homic to
[1:30:38] you I know that too
[1:30:40] right but we're talking
[1:30:43] reality somebody has met God God has
[1:30:47] spoken to someone doesn't matter how
[1:30:50] many people say I'm in the message and
[1:30:52] this God has chosen an elected bride
[1:30:56] somebody is The Offspring of
[1:30:59] God and God ain't in heaven doing this
[1:31:01] oh please come oh please come no man
[1:31:04] Jesus said can come to me except my
[1:31:07] father draws him and those at my father
[1:31:10] draw him I will in no wise cast out you
[1:31:13] see so there is an elected people in the
[1:31:17] Earth today yes sir who are being led by
[1:31:20] the Holy Spirit see they're not leading
[1:31:22] God God's leading them sometimes people
[1:31:25] think they're leading God right
[1:31:27] sometimes we get in our powwows and we
[1:31:30] think you know that's a good idea that's
[1:31:32] right uhhuh I believe yeah that's right
[1:31:34] but that's not how God does it though
[1:31:37] you see when he the Holy Spirit has come
[1:31:40] yes brother brandom tells us this
[1:31:44] story that there was a boy a little
[1:31:47] boy and he went to his mother and said
[1:31:50] mother has anyone ever seen God true
[1:31:53] story
[1:31:55] and she said well
[1:31:57] Sunny go ask the Sunday school
[1:32:00] teacher and he went to the Sunday school
[1:32:03] teacher this was a question that God
[1:32:06] placed in his heart why are you saying
[1:32:09] that because if God is really drawing
[1:32:12] you if he's really drawing you he knows
[1:32:15] how to lead you he knows how to place
[1:32:18] things in your heart that draws you to
[1:32:21] him if I be lifted up
[1:32:24] I will draw men unto me amen and so the
[1:32:27] boy he went to his sonay school teacher
[1:32:29] said I mean his son sco teach said has
[1:32:32] anyone ever seen God she said well that
[1:32:35] you know Junior that's a good question
[1:32:37] go and ask the
[1:32:39] pastor so Junior went to the
[1:32:42] pastor he said pastor I asked my mom she
[1:32:46] couldn't answer I went to Sunday school
[1:32:48] teach can answer he said what's what's
[1:32:50] going
[1:32:51] on he said I want to know
[1:32:54] has anyone ever seen
[1:32:58] God he said oh boy you know the Bible
[1:33:01] said no man can see God and
[1:33:04] live can't nobody see can't see God
[1:33:08] listen if the boy just would have been
[1:33:12] curious he would have just said okay
[1:33:14] well that's good Pastor said
[1:33:17] that's but this was more than curiosity
[1:33:20] this was God on the scene
[1:33:25] this was the same God said Adam Where
[1:33:27] Art
[1:33:28] Thou Where Art Thou Adam right brother
[1:33:32] he said I was afraid who told
[1:33:34] you afraid where did fear come into our
[1:33:38] relationship I was afraid and so I hid
[1:33:41] myself because I was naked who told you
[1:33:45] that you was
[1:33:47] naked like like God didn't know
[1:33:50] that what about the young people
[1:33:54] you say Mom and Daddy they don't know
[1:33:57] but God
[1:33:58] knows and God cares he and so that if
[1:34:02] there's a a broad body in the earth and
[1:34:05] they are sir then Jesus taught us in
[1:34:08] Matthew chapter 7 how to make righteous
[1:34:12] judgments and we don't come down and
[1:34:15] condemn the whole world to hell because
[1:34:17] they don't no no no no we make righteous
[1:34:20] judgments amen the Apostle Paul said in
[1:34:22] Corinthians chapter six know ye not that
[1:34:25] ye shall judge the
[1:34:28] world and these little matters you're
[1:34:30] tripping on don't you know you're going
[1:34:32] to Jud this Bible verse you're going to
[1:34:35] Jo judge the
[1:34:38] Angels let's just go over there too I
[1:34:40] think it's 1 Corinthians chapter 6 if
[1:34:43] it's not it's 1 Corinthians
[1:34:45] 7 let's go to 1 Corinthians I love the
[1:34:48] word of God I love in the church I'm
[1:34:51] always encouraging them
[1:34:54] we've got uh 16 going on 15 16 people
[1:34:58] who read the Bible through last year we
[1:35:01] have their names up we also we started
[1:35:03] the bereans the bereans are from Acts
[1:35:05] chapter 17 where the Bible says that
[1:35:07] when Apostle Paul left thessalonica went
[1:35:09] to Berea the Bible says they were more
[1:35:12] Nobles because they searched out the
[1:35:14] word with joy so now we're we're we're
[1:35:18] putting a the bereans list at the church
[1:35:21] I think brother Jarry Peterson he's at
[1:35:22] number three
[1:35:24] third time reading the Bible but it's
[1:35:26] more than that there's more challenges
[1:35:28] to that and and so we want to always
[1:35:32] encourage everyone read your Bible uh
[1:35:35] We've uh shared with uh the people at
[1:35:39] church on William tendle my hero there
[1:35:43] yes sir when the the the bishop visited
[1:35:46] where William tendle he spoke seven
[1:35:48] language
[1:35:51] fluent and he was tutoring a family and
[1:35:54] the bishop
[1:35:56] visited and the discussion you can just
[1:35:59] Google it up and pull it up the the
[1:36:01] bishop said to William tendle the pope
[1:36:04] he knows this and that and William
[1:36:07] tendle said that you see that boy
[1:36:09] plowing the fields he probably know more
[1:36:11] than the
[1:36:12] Pope the bishop probably went crosy yeah
[1:36:17] you mean he knows more than the P than
[1:36:20] the
[1:36:21] pontiff yeah and William tendle said if
[1:36:25] God will give me the
[1:36:27] strength I will interpret the
[1:36:30] Bible that even the plow boy that's out
[1:36:33] there will be able to read the
[1:36:35] Bible and then we just throw our Bible
[1:36:37] down don't read it half the time ain't
[1:36:39] got time to read it come on
[1:36:41] now William Tinder was burned at the
[1:36:44] Stak for printing the Bible in English
[1:36:49] he spoke English too and as they were
[1:36:51] burning him at the Stak took wires
[1:36:55] because they wanted to decapitate him
[1:36:58] and the boys those young 17 18 19 year
[1:37:02] old boys who would hide the Bible in a
[1:37:05] flower in a sack of flour and take it
[1:37:08] out they caught those boys and burnt
[1:37:11] those
[1:37:13] boys so that you come on now can have a
[1:37:18] Bible think about it that means
[1:37:22] something to someone right amen that
[1:37:25] means something to someone so we see
[1:37:29] here in in 1 Corinthians chapter 6 verse
[1:37:32] one dare any of you having matter
[1:37:34] against another go to
[1:37:37] law before the
[1:37:40] unjust and not before the
[1:37:43] Saints do you not know that the saint
[1:37:47] shall judge the
[1:37:49] world and if the world shall be judged
[1:37:52] by you
[1:37:54] man he bring it down on Apostle
[1:37:57] Paul if the world uh and if the world
[1:38:02] shall be judged by you are ye unworthy
[1:38:05] to judge the smallest matter we talking
[1:38:08] about the bride everybody going in a
[1:38:10] Rapture everybody but look at these
[1:38:13] responsibilities know ye not that we
[1:38:15] shall judge
[1:38:20] Angels how much more
[1:38:24] things that
[1:38:25] pertain to this life why don't you go
[1:38:28] with me to Matthew chapter 7 this ain't
[1:38:31] even in my notes I don't even know but I
[1:38:33] want to follow the leadership of the
[1:38:34] holy spirit amen them notes don't mean
[1:38:36] nothing it's what the Lord wants is what
[1:38:38] we want and Matthew Chapter
[1:38:42] 5 I'm sorry Matthew chapter
[1:38:46] 7 judge not that ye be not judged now
[1:38:52] you you have to Trail some of these
[1:38:55] words because when he's saying judge
[1:38:57] he's saying don't be condemning somebody
[1:39:00] to
[1:39:01] Hell see don't do
[1:39:04] that if you haven't walked in their
[1:39:07] shoes if you don't know their
[1:39:11] circumstances see and because we are the
[1:39:15] second fold of the
[1:39:18] threefold and we have the mind of
[1:39:21] christu
[1:39:23] the way that we judge and the way that
[1:39:26] we bring God's word will be no different
[1:39:29] than how Jesus handled the situation
[1:39:34] amen true
[1:39:36] brother so we're making righteous
[1:39:39] judgments understanding the word because
[1:39:42] we are becoming the word the full word
[1:39:45] am right see believe that and because we
[1:39:49] are the light of the world because we
[1:39:52] are the word made manifest because the
[1:39:54] Bride is a son of man in this last
[1:39:57] day because the bride is the word made
[1:40:00] flesh in the beginning was the word then
[1:40:03] is there someone in the Earth with the
[1:40:06] mind of God that would do the same thing
[1:40:09] that Jesus at the first fold done will
[1:40:11] the second fold do the same that's
[1:40:15] right yes absolutely brother you are
[1:40:18] that's right so Jesus says here Matthew
[1:40:21] 7 judge not not that ye be not judged
[1:40:25] for with what judgment ye judge ye shall
[1:40:28] be judged and with what measure ye meet
[1:40:32] ye shall uh be measured to you again and
[1:40:37] why beholdest thou the moat that is in
[1:40:41] thy brother's eye but consider not the
[1:40:44] being that is in thine own eye Jesus
[1:40:49] goes on to give us understanding
[1:40:53] and
[1:40:54] wisdom as Sons and Daughters of the
[1:40:57] Living God because that's who we
[1:41:00] are so we see the boy his Pastor said
[1:41:04] Son you the Bible says no one can see
[1:41:07] God and and
[1:41:09] live okay thank you
[1:41:12] Pastor well if that would have just been
[1:41:14] a question as we said someone presented
[1:41:16] to him then he would have just said well
[1:41:19] you know he would have told his buddies
[1:41:22] man no one can see God of course we know
[1:41:25] what the scripture says regarding
[1:41:29] that that no one can see God and live
[1:41:33] but the
[1:41:34] question that God placed in his heart
[1:41:38] amen was the question that only listen
[1:41:41] now if God placed it in his heart only
[1:41:44] God could answer that question if God
[1:41:47] has placed this message in your heart
[1:41:50] there has to be a people with the
[1:41:52] evening time results to meet the
[1:41:55] challenge of this
[1:41:58] hour and that's you my brother and
[1:42:00] sister in the Simplicity believe that
[1:42:02] that's what you're doing amen and you
[1:42:04] know the rest of the story was the boy
[1:42:07] satisfied would you be satisfied no he
[1:42:11] was not satisfied and so there he was
[1:42:14] down at the river and an Old Gentleman
[1:42:17] there had his boat there and he uh uh he
[1:42:21] said to the the old chap said sir do you
[1:42:24] mind if I ride in your boat with you he
[1:42:27] said no fell you don't think your folks
[1:42:30] would mind hop
[1:42:32] aboard and so the boy he watched the the
[1:42:35] man and a storm had just ended the
[1:42:39] leaves floating on the river
[1:42:43] the freshness amen through the
[1:42:47] air a rainbow had come up the Sun was
[1:42:52] shining CLS were moving
[1:42:54] off and the boy was watching his dad I
[1:42:58] mean the old man with the
[1:43:02] ore and he said
[1:43:05] sir I've got a
[1:43:09] question he said speak up sonny
[1:43:13] boy he said
[1:43:17] sir I went to my mother and I asked her
[1:43:20] mama has anyone ever seen God go to your
[1:43:23] Sunday school teacher I went to Sunday
[1:43:25] school teacher go to the pastor I went
[1:43:29] to the
[1:43:31] pastor let let let me paraphrase that
[1:43:34] even a little
[1:43:35] more and now I'm talking to
[1:43:39] you sir has anyone ever seen God
[1:43:44] before brother brandham said
[1:43:47] tears begin to flow out the old man's
[1:43:51] eyes his lips began to kind of quiver
[1:43:56] there he said Son you see that rainbow
[1:44:01] he said yes he said that's
[1:44:04] God he said you see that son
[1:44:07] there he said yes sir he says that's
[1:44:11] God and this River and
[1:44:14] freshness he said yes
[1:44:17] sir he said it takes God to live in you
[1:44:22] for you to seek God out here
[1:44:25] right but when he's in you then
[1:44:29] everywhere he says sunny boy I've been a
[1:44:31] Christian many years and that's all that
[1:44:34] I do
[1:44:36] see is God he didn't say only thing I
[1:44:38] see is the
[1:44:40] church he said that's all I do see is
[1:44:45] God if God listen now again if God
[1:44:49] places a desire and a hunger amen and a
[1:44:54] question in your heart sir he's the only
[1:44:56] one that's right that can answer that
[1:44:59] question he's the only one that can make
[1:45:02] the word a reality you see in the
[1:45:06] message trying to do God a service
[1:45:08] brother brandham says and today he's
[1:45:11] standing amongst us in the person of the
[1:45:14] Holy Ghost manifesting himself more and
[1:45:19] more coming into his church making
[1:45:22] himself known because him and the bride
[1:45:26] the groom will be the same making
[1:45:30] himself known and one day you'll see
[1:45:34] that one that you feel in your heart and
[1:45:38] see his identification will become
[1:45:41] personalized before
[1:45:43] you then you and he are one you've
[1:45:48] United with the word and the Word was in
[1:45:52] the beginning will uh in the beginning
[1:45:54] will go back to the beginning which is
[1:45:57] God and that day you'll know that I'm in
[1:46:02] my father the father in me I in you and
[1:46:06] you in me Hallelujah brother Brown says
[1:46:09] hallelujah we're here hallelujah I'm so
[1:46:13] glad to see him personifying himself
[1:46:17] right amongst us and see what he
[1:46:20] promised for the word not not what
[1:46:23] somebody's emotion not somebody singing
[1:46:26] or jumping or dancing but his word he's
[1:46:30] making himself known by his word you see
[1:46:34] how thankful we are for that that God
[1:46:37] has called his bride like this and when
[1:46:39] we begin to look at Ruth and we begin to
[1:46:42] look at the broad types in the scripture
[1:46:44] we see that all of those broad types had
[1:46:48] to make a decision God placed them in
[1:46:51] sometimes in the world a predestination
[1:46:54] or Providence they used to call it long
[1:46:57] time ago God would be leading and they
[1:47:00] didn't know he was leading and I'll say
[1:47:02] this unequivocally if you a bride member
[1:47:06] you've been born again God knew you
[1:47:08] before the foundation of the world and
[1:47:11] it was not the person that come
[1:47:13] predestinated but the word as God opened
[1:47:16] himself up you find yourself in the very
[1:47:19] economy of God because it's not you it's
[1:47:22] him
[1:47:23] am God has done these things for his own
[1:47:26] purpose he created everything for its
[1:47:30] purpose let's go to Revelations chapter
[1:47:32] 4 real quick and and uh just a few oh
[1:47:35] wow just a few more minutes and we close
[1:47:38] I didn't I didn't even realize
[1:47:40] Revelation chapter
[1:47:49] 4 verse
[1:47:51] n and when those those Beast it should
[1:47:54] be living creatures brother Brown says
[1:47:56] Revelations
[1:47:59] 4:9 and when those
[1:48:01] Beast the lion yeah the
[1:48:06] ox the face of a man and the Flying
[1:48:10] Eagle amen as brother brownan said in
[1:48:13] each age in those
[1:48:14] ages when the anointing of the living
[1:48:19] creatures coming out of the word
[1:48:23] the briad in each
[1:48:25] age she could do no more that's right
[1:48:29] than the anointing that was upon her to
[1:48:31] do
[1:48:33] abely and that's why when irus there
[1:48:37] went down to give his life and a voice
[1:48:41] said be a man be a
[1:48:44] man he wasn't
[1:48:46] afraid because the anointing right amen
[1:48:50] of the ARX was upon him
[1:48:53] to give his life and when they went down
[1:48:56] to the Roman
[1:48:57] Coliseum and it was
[1:49:00] dark and the and the the fire that was
[1:49:04] uh uh Illuminating the Coliseum was the
[1:49:08] hair of Christian women that they cut
[1:49:12] their hair off put it on the steak and
[1:49:15] burnt their hair to light the Coliseum
[1:49:19] go back and see if I'm telling you the
[1:49:20] truth
[1:49:23] and we cut our hair like it ain't
[1:49:25] nothing a woman's hair that's her
[1:49:29] glory and they set their hair on fire
[1:49:33] even even the Roman historian I'm not
[1:49:37] talking about the Jewish historian right
[1:49:40] but the Roman historian I can't recall
[1:49:43] his name but just look it up he will
[1:49:46] tell you that they took those Christian
[1:49:49] women cut their hair y right and put it
[1:49:53] on the Stak put it on the
[1:49:57] torch to light the
[1:50:00] Coliseum so they could kill the rest of
[1:50:03] the
[1:50:05] Christians and going down because they
[1:50:07] had got there too
[1:50:09] late they didn't have to drag
[1:50:12] irus even before they came to get him he
[1:50:15] fed
[1:50:18] them right how could they do anything
[1:50:21] else than the
[1:50:23] anointing that was leading them to
[1:50:26] do
[1:50:28] see so we see in the scriptures that
[1:50:32] brother random says I think in the third
[1:50:34] s I'm not
[1:50:36] sure he says that the
[1:50:39] anointing those that came under he said
[1:50:42] not that you are a special
[1:50:45] people but because the anointing of God
[1:50:48] has been released upon you through the
[1:50:51] word how can you do anything contrary to
[1:50:55] the
[1:50:56] word you you don't want to do anything
[1:50:59] contrary to the
[1:51:00] word so under this fourth living
[1:51:05] creature under the eagle anointing the
[1:51:07] Flying Eagle
[1:51:09] anointing how can we do anything else
[1:51:13] but
[1:51:15] fly and have faith brother Aon brought
[1:51:17] it out at the church up there and that
[1:51:19] eagle
[1:51:22] brother brandham had his rifle brother
[1:51:24] Bram said look I don't you know I'll
[1:51:26] shoot
[1:51:27] you and the eagle just looking at
[1:51:29] brother Brown brother Brown tells the
[1:51:30] story The Eagle just looking at him
[1:51:32] saying go ahead try
[1:51:34] it because the eagle had faith and his
[1:51:39] god-given gifts amen Them
[1:51:42] Wings amen what you got faith in come on
[1:51:46] brother what you got faith in you said
[1:51:49] brother Andre I got faith in that Holy
[1:51:50] Ghost amen that lives in my heart let me
[1:51:53] let me just let me just read this so how
[1:51:56] thankful we are to God as the Bible says
[1:52:01] and when those
[1:52:02] beasts give glory and honor and thanks
[1:52:06] to him that sat on the throne who liveth
[1:52:09] forever and ever the four and 20 Elders
[1:52:12] fell down before him that sat on the
[1:52:16] throne and worshiped him that liveth
[1:52:20] forever and ever and cast down their
[1:52:24] crowns Before the Throne saying Thou Art
[1:52:28] Worthy oh Lord to receive glory and
[1:52:33] honor and power for thou Hast created
[1:52:36] all things amen and for thy
[1:52:40] pleasure brother y for thy pleasure not
[1:52:44] for anyone else thou has created all
[1:52:47] things amen see for thou H has created
[1:52:51] all things and for thy place treasure
[1:52:52] they are and were created this is a
[1:52:57] sovereign
[1:52:58] God who does as he pleases
[1:53:01] amen he raises up kingdoms he changes
[1:53:05] times right because God is God you see
[1:53:10] amen now now let's let's run back here
[1:53:14] to Isaiah 60 and let's close on
[1:53:16] that Isaiah chapter 60
[1:53:23] Redemption yes sir when the Redeemer
[1:53:29] comes now we don't have time and we and
[1:53:32] I ain't going to make time because I
[1:53:33] don't like to rush myself and I'm I'm
[1:53:36] starting to rush but the Bible
[1:53:39] says and the Redeemer shall come to Zion
[1:53:44] right we're going to see in the Book of
[1:53:48] Ruth
[1:53:49] God Boaz
[1:53:53] drawing
[1:53:54] Ruth and also getting drawing Naomi and
[1:53:58] also getting
[1:54:00] Ruth we see when the angel of the Lord
[1:54:03] came to brother Bram in
[1:54:05] 1946 for the ministry of the word and
[1:54:08] told him that Israel was being draw back
[1:54:12] to be a nation we see Israel in our
[1:54:15] homeland today and maybe there's still
[1:54:18] others that's scattered that God is
[1:54:20] bringing because God doesn't deal with
[1:54:22] Israel out of her Homeland that's right
[1:54:24] you see bringing them so we ask oursel
[1:54:28] why is the hatred of the whole world
[1:54:31] against the Jews why are those so why
[1:54:34] are those so hated when they didn't
[1:54:37] understand themselves being blind and
[1:54:39] said his blood be upon us and our
[1:54:42] children and it's been on it ever
[1:54:46] since
[1:54:47] amen and we see that happening today
[1:54:50] amen but there is an Awakening come on
[1:54:54] now that's happening to the
[1:54:58] Jews because the spirit of
[1:55:02] Elijah is returning Amen to Israel
[1:55:06] amen so if the spirit of
[1:55:09] Elijah is returning to Israel listen we
[1:55:14] are commanded in Psalms 122 to pray for
[1:55:17] the Peace of Jerusalem you
[1:55:20] know he doesn't tell us how you should
[1:55:22] pray like this no he just said pray for
[1:55:24] the Peace of Jerusalem
[1:55:26] amen because God knows what he's doing
[1:55:30] amen and Israel they don't need the
[1:55:33] hatred of the United Nations right or
[1:55:37] all these countries see because He Who
[1:55:40] Watches Over Israel shall neither
[1:55:43] slumber nor
[1:55:44] sleep
[1:55:46] amen right The Sovereign
[1:55:49] God he don't care how much they say
[1:55:51] we're going to vote Benjamin nanahu
[1:55:54] we're going to vote you out God don't
[1:55:56] care about that that's
[1:55:59] right HJ all things were created by Him
[1:56:02] and for him right so we see God bringing
[1:56:07] Israel yes back to the
[1:56:11] Homeland and we see 144,000 that's going
[1:56:15] to receive the word and we understand
[1:56:18] under the fifth trumpet 200,000,000
[1:56:21] Devils there from Euphrates have been
[1:56:23] let loose and we see because of the
[1:56:26] opening of the seals the spirit of Truth
[1:56:29] has been released upon the
[1:56:32] broad amen amen God bless you this
[1:56:35] evening y'all love the Lord am amen
[1:56:37] let's just bow our head Heavenly Father
[1:56:41] we love you because you first loved us

[1:57:20] Lord pointing this people to you having
[1:57:24] them to recognize their

[1:57:30] recognize that when this brother
[1:57:32] brandham said I in the message Shalom
[1:57:35] preached in 1964 he read the scripture
[1:57:39] there when he was either at uh Sierra
[1:57:42] Vista or at Phoenix and he read it and
[1:57:45] he said this is an end time prophecy to
[1:57:49] an end time
[1:57:50] people so Lord when the scripture says
[1:57:54] arise shine yeah Lord that has there has
[1:57:59] to be an individual in this

[1:58:13] shine for thy light is come but Lord
[1:58:17] Isaiah
[1:58:19] 61 could not come into view right unless
[1:58:23] the
[1:58:24] Redeemer comes to Zion he has come he
[1:58:27] has paid the price and we're thankful
[1:58:29] that we're sitting under the true
[1:58:31] atonement of the word for this hour be
[1:58:33] glorified

[2:04:30] did $2,100 thank you so very
[2:04:35] much that's a bunch of 20s there have
[2:04:39] been some 50s and and hundreds in there
[2:04:41] too I think if you have anything else
[2:04:43] though please give it to them we're
[2:04:45] going to give some to from the church
[2:04:47] and get them started and I think we'll
[2:04:49] probably do this first Sunday of every
[2:04:51] month we'll just give all the offering
[2:04:53] to them to the to the vision books cuz I
[2:04:56] like I said before best bang for the
[2:04:57] buck to get this message to people and
[2:05:00] as I've always told you brother Andre
[2:05:01] and I were
[2:05:04] talking when we get to
[2:05:06] Glory all things are going to be made
[2:05:09] known right right we're not going to
[2:05:11] have any barriers in our in our minds
[2:05:13] we're we're going to be we're going to
[2:05:15] be uh fully aware of everything and it's
[2:05:18] all going to be
[2:05:19] good and somebody's going to walk up to
[2:05:21] you one day and say the Lord told me
[2:05:24] that you gave $10 on a certain certain
[2:05:28] day and that $10 bought 10 books and one
[2:05:32] of them books got in my hand and I read
[2:05:35] this great message and I started going
[2:05:38] to church and got filled with the Holy
[2:05:39] Ghost if it hadn't been for
[2:05:40] you I may not have ever got that book
[2:05:44] may not have ever just some small 8 cent
[2:05:48] book is worth as Louise says 10,000 and
[2:05:51] brother says 10,000 worlds for 8 cents
[2:05:55] you're giving somebody the words of
[2:05:56] eternal life so we sure appreciate what
[2:05:59] you give and like I said before every
[2:06:01] every first Sunday of every month we'll
[2:06:03] give that not that amount whatever we
[2:06:05] get in that's what we'll get all right
[2:06:06] so um uh thank you so much thank you so
[2:06:09] much and we're going to give also some
[2:06:11] relief funds to brother Barry Coffey uh
[2:06:14] we'll get with ter him after the service
[2:06:17] but remember brother Andre now they're
[2:06:18] going to have to travel back here after
[2:06:20] the service is over and get back so they
[2:06:22] can uh they can do some groundwork cuz
[2:06:24] they know the place uh if you ever been
[2:06:27] up there it's the most beautiful Valley
[2:06:28] in the world it's just beautiful and now
[2:06:31] it ain't
[2:06:33] beautiful it's it's pretty much
[2:06:35] gone and some of those places uh I saw
[2:06:39] today this morning where at least 80% of
[2:06:42] the people that got their homes
[2:06:44] destroyed had zero flood
[2:06:47] insurance never thought they'd ever need
[2:06:49] flood insurance so they don't take they
[2:06:50] didn't take out blood insurance 80% of
[2:06:53] the people lost their homes lost their
[2:06:56] businesses and they're not going to get
[2:06:58] a dime for it they're going to have to
[2:06:59] start from scratch and they've lost it
[2:07:02] all so but we know a God that can just
[2:07:05] give it all back like brother Andre said
[2:07:07] wonderful wonderful analogy we got a God
[2:07:10] that's that that divides and multiplies
[2:07:12] and it don't bother him one bit if he's
[2:07:14] only got Five Loaves and two fishes he
[2:07:16] fed 5,000 people with it didn't bother
[2:07:19] him he didn't get nervous he didn't
[2:07:20] start going now if I do this and I'll
[2:07:22] get this no he just said here go give
[2:07:24] this out what a mighty God we serve uh
[2:07:28] let's go into our uh communion scripture
[2:07:31] uh as I said always this is an open
[2:07:34] communion you take communion as your
[2:07:36] heart gives you the desire um and and I
[2:07:39] want to admonish each and every one of
[2:07:42] us we'll never be worthy enough to take
[2:07:45] communion if we keep listening to our
[2:07:48] own
[2:07:49] thinking exactly like brother Andre said
[2:07:52] if we start keep Satan keeps poking
[2:07:55] these things in our head but what you
[2:07:57] got to do is you got to be clear in your
[2:08:00] heart that I've done all I can do I've
[2:08:02] walked in here I've I've I've asked God
[2:08:04] to clean me up and if there is anything
[2:08:07] go get it right go make it right but
[2:08:10] this communion is important to me amen
[2:08:13] communion keeps us clean it keeps us
[2:08:15] checked
[2:08:16] up so so don't feel if you feel unworthy
[2:08:22] you're the only one that knows what's
[2:08:23] going on in your head but listen to your
[2:08:25] heart what God tells you God tells you
[2:08:29] to do these ordinances until he comes
[2:08:32] that's right all right so Christians
[2:08:33] will take communion right period there's
[2:08:36] no Christian that won't take communion
[2:08:38] I've never seen one and like brother Ram
[2:08:39] said they asked him one time said
[2:08:40] brother Ram said does a Christian pay
[2:08:43] ties he said Christians only Christians
[2:08:46] are going to pay you know real true
[2:08:48] tithe he said but a Christian will pay
[2:08:50] tithe so a Christian will take Comm
[2:08:51] communion so let's go to the communion
[2:08:53] scripture which is first
[2:08:55] Corinthians I love it how that Paul
[2:08:59] wasn't there but he had so much
[2:09:02] Clarity the Holy Ghost gave him Clarity
[2:09:05] U brother Andre just like he a
[2:09:07] vision and and there was no other you
[2:09:10] know there was 11 or so ever how many
[2:09:11] people up there in the upper room and
[2:09:14] and they might have had 11 different
[2:09:17] opinions that's okay God said I'm going
[2:09:19] to move that out of the way and I'm
[2:09:21] going to have a Prophet come and I'm
[2:09:22] going to have that Prophet tell you
[2:09:24] exactly what happened and it be no other
[2:09:26] man's opinions because he said for I
[2:09:28] have received of the Lord all right so
[2:09:31] we know right there where it came from
[2:09:33] it didn't come from here say it didn't
[2:09:34] come from
[2:09:35] Peter Cuz Peter could have missed
[2:09:37] something that's right he said I have
[2:09:39] received from the Lord that which also I
[2:09:41] delivered unto you so he didn't keep it
[2:09:43] secret he gave it to us that the same
[2:09:46] night in which he was betray Jesus the
[2:09:48] same night in which he was betrayed took
[2:09:50] bread and when he had given thanks he
[2:09:52] break it and said take eat this is my
[2:09:54] body which is broken for you this do in
[2:09:57] remembrance of me and after the same
[2:09:59] manner also he took the cup and when he
[2:10:01] had stck saying this cup is the New
[2:10:03] Testament there had to be the death of a
[2:10:05] testator right for that Testament to be
[2:10:08] in force and when this Testament comes
[2:10:10] in force it's not the blood of bulls and
[2:10:12] goats anymore it's the blood of the
[2:10:15] perfect lamb it's the blood of a man
[2:10:17] that can take his life and come right
[2:10:19] back inside of you and make you a
[2:10:20] different person
[2:10:22] blood bulls and goats can't do that
[2:10:23] animal blood can't do that God's blood
[2:10:27] sir God's life God I'm not going to
[2:10:29] start preaching God's blood God's life
[2:10:31] all right remember I told yall the other
[2:10:33] day you apply the token you apply that
[2:10:35] over your house over your children Satan
[2:10:38] cannot reach through that blood cannot
[2:10:40] ever even I mean if he even touches it's
[2:10:42] like 10 billion bolts and he's like oh I
[2:10:46] better not touch that no more right if
[2:10:49] we believe that that's why we apply the
[2:10:50] token that's why we apply we don't apply
[2:10:52] the blood of bulls and ghosts we apply
[2:10:54] the blood of God the blood of Jesus
[2:10:56] Christ all right here we go after the
[2:10:59] same manner he took the cup and we up
[2:11:01] saying this cup is the New Testament in
[2:11:03] my blood this do ye as of as you drink
[2:11:06] it in remance of me if you don't take
[2:11:08] this communion and not remember Jesus
[2:11:10] and what he did and all the things that
[2:11:12] he had to go through just for me and you
[2:11:14] then you're missing something we need to
[2:11:17] enter into what they're entered in with
[2:11:19] and listen they didn't understand at
[2:11:21] that time right I mean they're still
[2:11:24] asking him are you going to restore the
[2:11:25] kingdom even after he raised from the
[2:11:27] dead but you and I have a revelation
[2:11:29] that that's what we're supposed to do
[2:11:31] until God
[2:11:32] comes from him to us that's right so you
[2:11:35] can say in your heart I have received of
[2:11:37] the
[2:11:39] Lord this scripture that we're talking
[2:11:41] about I have received from the Lord
[2:11:43] right for as often as you eat this bread
[2:11:45] and drink this cup you do show the
[2:11:47] Lord's death till he come wherefore
[2:11:50] whosoever shall eat eat this bread and
[2:11:51] drink this cup of the Lord unworthily
[2:11:53] shall be guilty of the body and blood of
[2:11:55] the Lord if he would have stopped right
[2:11:57] there yeah you probably wouldn't take
[2:12:00] communion all the time but let a man
[2:12:04] examine
[2:12:06] himself and so let him eat of that bread
[2:12:09] and drink of that cup let a man examine
[2:12:13] himself for he that eateth and drinketh
[2:12:15] unworthily eateth and drinketh Damnation
[2:12:17] to himself not Discerning the Lord's
[2:12:19] body for this caused many are we and
[2:12:21] sickly among you and many sleep for if
[2:12:24] we would judge ourselves to go back to
[2:12:26] what brother Andre was talking about we
[2:12:28] should not be judged but when we are
[2:12:30] judged we are chasten of the Lord that
[2:12:33] we should not be condemned with this
[2:12:35] world separated wherefore my brethren
[2:12:38] when you come together to eat t one for
[2:12:41] another and if any man hunger let him
[2:12:43] eat at home that you come not together
[2:12:45] into condemnation and the rest will I
[2:12:47] set in order in other words Paul's
[2:12:48] coming back in 2 Corinthians he's coming
[2:12:50] back to set some other things in order
[2:12:52] but he set this in order the way it
[2:12:54] should been I believe it's the way it's
[2:12:56] been done for 2,000 years I believe it
[2:12:58] and I believe we're going to do it until
[2:13:00] we until we drink with him in the in the
[2:13:03] um not in the new city we're going to do
[2:13:05] it at the marriage supper yes sir we're
[2:13:07] going to do it up atast three and a half
[2:13:08] years we're going to have communion just
[2:13:10] like we do now but today for those of
[2:13:13] you that never taken communion in this
[2:13:14] building before remember one thing's for
[2:13:17] sure that bread has been made with holy
[2:13:19] hands that bread has not been processed
[2:13:23] by the
[2:13:25] world Amen that wine has been
[2:13:29] made with one thing in mind and that's
[2:13:32] to have communion that it be wine and
[2:13:36] not grape juice grape juice will rot it
[2:13:39] has a expiration date on it well if the
[2:13:42] Wine's done right it never does have an
[2:13:45] expiration date on it it just keeps
[2:13:47] getting better and better and better so
[2:13:50] um with that we're going to take our
[2:13:51] communion and the Lord he took the bread
[2:13:54] and he put it in his hands and he
[2:13:56] blessed it and he said Lord he said oh
[2:13:58] father thank you so much for this
[2:14:01] opportunity Lord that we have Lord as we
[2:14:04] see him standing in the upper room
[2:14:06] knowing that one was going to betray him
[2:14:08] knew the whole world was going to be
[2:14:09] against him and his body was going to be
[2:14:12] as a prophet said hamburger meat in just
[2:14:14] a few hours but Lord he you did it for
[2:14:17] us yes and father as we break this bread
[2:14:19] may we remember you Lord and remember
[2:14:21] what you went through that time Lord but
[2:14:23] what a glorious time we're going to have
[2:14:25] when we take this with you and look you
[2:14:26] straight in the eye and say have you had
[2:14:29] you not come we would not be here father

[2:14:47] used to do it all the time brother
[2:14:49] Ryan's now uh our designated Deacon to
[2:14:53] do that and he's going to take it he's
[2:14:55] going to burn it beyond recognition
[2:14:56] where it's not going we're going to get
[2:14:57] new revelation next time we take
[2:14:59] communion we taking new
[2:15:02] bread
[2:15:04] right that old leftover
[2:15:07] Revelation in the uh Wilderness Journey
[2:15:11] other RS called it just like a
[2:15:13] southerner would call it wiggle tail yes
[2:15:15] but for those of you that are not
[2:15:17] Southern that means it had worms in it
[2:15:21] and it was not edible because it was
[2:15:23] held
[2:15:24] over but we don't hold this over this
[2:15:26] will be
[2:15:28] completely burnt to a crisp there be
[2:15:31] nothing left or held
[2:15:35] over sure appreciate all of you coming

[2:18:24] anymore we never have to worry about
[2:18:26] water destroying our home never have to
[2:18:28] worry about
[2:18:30] tornadoes hurricanes all the things that
[2:18:33] happen on this side never have to worry
[2:18:35] about that again they'll be no fear
[2:18:38] morning there's
[2:18:41] glory for
[2:18:44] me sometimes I
[2:18:48] despised and rejected
[2:18:52] and I question oh
[2:18:56] Father how listen folks it was not going
[2:18:59] to be long not going to be
[2:19:02] long not going to be
[2:19:05] long at Mount
[2:19:09] Calvary and it gives me the strength
[2:19:15] to you know I was thinking the other day
[2:19:17] we were watching what was going on in
[2:19:20] the
[2:19:21] Israel and just thinking because you
[2:19:23] know we we already got the news we don't
[2:19:25] have to turn on CNN or Fox we do to get
[2:19:28] what's going on but we know what's going
[2:19:30] to happen we know the whole world is
[2:19:34] going to reject Israel All America says
[2:19:36] yeah we'll back them and this one says
[2:19:38] yeah we'll back them and until they make
[2:19:40] America
[2:19:42] mad but I like what brother Benton
[2:19:45] brother n Yahoo said he said we didn't
[2:19:49] ask for your help that's right exactly
[2:19:52] that's right we don't need it that's
[2:19:54] right but it's good I appreciate you
[2:19:55] coming and helping but we never ask for
[2:19:58] your help I don't think there's ever
[2:20:00] been a phone call that went from Israel
[2:20:03] to America it's always Israel going
[2:20:06] America going you need some help you
[2:20:08] know and they'll take the help cuz we
[2:20:09] give them their technology they give
[2:20:11] them our techn uh their technology too
[2:20:13] so we work together but there's going to
[2:20:15] come a day when Every Nation on the face
[2:20:19] of this Earth is going to be heading
[2:20:22] toward that little ever how many square
[2:20:24] miles that little thing is not much
[2:20:26] bigger than
[2:20:28] Massachusetts what about that they they
[2:20:31] ain't the whole world wanting
[2:20:32] Massachusetts no one offense to
[2:20:34] Massachusetts but the land mass it's not
[2:20:38] huge it's very small compared to the
[2:20:42] world and you're talking about um
[2:20:44] bringing them
[2:20:46] home and they won't be blessed till
[2:20:48] they're in the home right you you know
[2:20:50] they're soon they're going to call
[2:20:51] everybody back in when they get into a
[2:20:54] big hard fight and they start losing
[2:20:55] people they're going to call those
[2:20:57] people from there's there's Millions
[2:20:58] live in America that are Jewish citizens
[2:21:01] that are obligated according to their uh
[2:21:04] to their army to go fight for the
[2:21:06] Homeland now wouldn't you and me if we
[2:21:08] were over in Italy or somewhere and and
[2:21:10] we were getting bombed over here we'd
[2:21:12] come back here especially Israel cuz see
[2:21:16] they know they're God's
[2:21:17] people and they know that God's going to
[2:21:20] protect them yes
[2:21:22] sir but one day
[2:21:26] folks that's not going to happen the
[2:21:29] whole world's going to Encompass that
[2:21:31] City and then God's going to fight but
[2:21:33] you and I are not going to be around
[2:21:35] that's right we're not going to see that
[2:21:37] if you see some of this coming up that's
[2:21:39] just a that's just a pressure cooker to
[2:21:42] what's coming sure America will help you
[2:21:44] know why America is helping
[2:21:46] Israel cuz we're still here exactly
[2:21:49] right that's right God is letting this
[2:21:51] thing go because you and I are not ready
[2:21:54] yet but when we get ready and he flips
[2:21:58] that switch from Gentiles to Jews yes
[2:22:02] Katie Bar the Door the old saying is
[2:22:04] that's when all hell is going to break
[2:22:05] loose this is nothing compared to what's
[2:22:08] coming right so get in Christ as I said
[2:22:11] last week get under some wings get under
[2:22:14] some feathers forget about trying to
[2:22:16] make it through the tribulation sorry
[2:22:18] ain't going to happen but we love the
[2:22:21] Lord and we love that God's give us this
[2:22:23] information you know what it's called
[2:22:25] Revelation it's called Eagles view that
[2:22:29] you can see we can see we know what's
[2:22:31] going to happen when we get out of here
[2:22:32] we know what's going to happen and we
[2:22:34] know what's going to happen as it leads
[2:22:35] up to it so let's just pray for those
[2:22:38] people though they're humans pray for
[2:22:40] those people in North Carolina Tennessee
[2:22:43] Virginia all the different on they're
[2:22:44] human beings that have human lives and
[2:22:47] we never want to neglect human lives cuz
[2:22:49] we're all we all off same
[2:22:51] tree that's right amen but listen you
[2:22:54] thank God that he saved your soul lord
[2:22:58] and if you hadn't saved your soul thank
[2:22:59] God he's G you time to say get your soul
[2:23:01] saved that's right you ask God to help
[2:23:04] you yes let's
[2:23:15] take God bless you while they're taking
[2:23:17] it up
[2:23:18] I'll read the scripture for the foot
[2:23:22] washing the supper being ended the devil
[2:23:25] having now put into the heart of Judas
[2:23:27] this carrot Simon's son to betray
[2:23:29] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[2:23:31] given all things into his hand and he
[2:23:33] was come from God and went to God he
[2:23:37] riseth from supper and laid aside His
[2:23:38] Garment and took a towel and GED himself
[2:23:41] after that he pth water into a basin and
[2:23:43] began to wash the disciples feet and
[2:23:44] wipped him with a towel where with he
[2:23:47] was girded then cometh he to Simon Peter
[2:23:50] and Peter said Lord Dost thou wash my
[2:23:52] feet now I was thinking about when what
[2:23:55] you said that question was not from
[2:23:58] Peter that that question came from
[2:24:00] God CU God's fixing to answer that he's
[2:24:03] fixing to answer that question right so
[2:24:06] Peter says do you wash my feet and then
[2:24:08] what what did Jesus say Jesus answered
[2:24:11] said unto him what I do thou knowest not
[2:24:13] now Peter you're going to you're going
[2:24:14] to complain about this right now but
[2:24:16] you're going to know when I leave you're
[2:24:18] going to know what to do right what I do
[2:24:20] thou knowest not now but Thou shalt know
[2:24:23] Hereafter Peter said unto him Thou shalt
[2:24:26] never wash my feet Jesus answered and
[2:24:29] said if I wash thee
[2:24:30] not thou Hast no part with me and Peter
[2:24:36] he dove in and so not not only my hands
[2:24:39] and my
[2:24:40] feet but everything my head everything
[2:24:43] watch me watch me Lord cuz you know what
[2:24:45] he he didn't want to be he didn't want
[2:24:47] to be away from from this man they
[2:24:49] called Jesus he said you'll have no part
[2:24:51] with me Peter if you don't do this in
[2:24:52] other words I'll be separated from you
[2:24:54] Peter said no Lord don't separate from
[2:24:56] me wash everything I got wash us all
[2:25:00] Jesus said he that is washed neth not
[2:25:01] saved to wash his feet but is clean
[2:25:03] every with and you are clean but not all
[2:25:06] for he knew who should betray him
[2:25:07] therefore he said you are not all clean
[2:25:10] so after he had washed their feet and
[2:25:11] taken His Garment was sit down he said
[2:25:13] unto them know you what I've done to you
[2:25:16] question and this is God asking the
[2:25:19] question and he's fixing to give him a
[2:25:20] go a God
[2:25:21] answer you call me master and Lord and
[2:25:24] you say well for so I am I was thinking
[2:25:26] about this the other day while they're
[2:25:27] getting ready I think about this the
[2:25:28] other day that was many times they

[2:25:36] this right here he said you call me

[2:25:42] I am now look though if I then because
[2:25:45] he put himself in a position but he he
[2:25:46] didn't put himself in a position up here
