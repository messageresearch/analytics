buddy god bless you appreciate your brother congratulations good to be here this morning good to see each and every one here been a while since i've been here i want to thank you for having me back a lot of things been going on i've had probably five or six people that have passed on uh went to the other side uh yeah i'm on okay i turned it on and i know there's some missing smiles here i look around and i see people missing it's hard where we're at it just seems like you know just people are passing away and things but brother branham said death is just our cadillac to get to the other side they're there they're going to be a part of the rapture the dead in christ will rise first brother dao i always remind people at the church brother dao he sat there and he told brother brandon he said brother branham he said i don't want to i don't want to die i'm 93 years old i want to be in the rapture brother branham was so positive he said brother brother bill he said the dead in christ will rise first he said so just death is nothing mere nothing but just a cadillac to get to the other side for for those that are gonna arrive you know we'll raise at the resurrection so but it's good to be here uh i'm 66 years old now i'm an old man i had a stroke four years ago had a heart attack three had a heart attack two years ago had a heart attack last september i've had three stents put in my widowmaker my widowmaker was 100 90 and 90 block the lady in the hospital the nurse said it's a miracle you're here and you know and yet somebody else will get the coven seven days later they're dead i don't i don't can't totally cope with those things or understand it brother but i'm going to tell you something brother tom ernest just passed over last week a real buddy of mine but he put he wrote on a note and handed it to his loved ones and he said this god is in control amen two days later he passed god truly is in control so these things we go through uh we're gonna we're not gonna remember them over there we're suffering along here but we're not gonna remember it there so it's it's good to be here this morning i hope they can get that displayed if they got my notes displayed oh thank you because i'm gonna stand out here i'm not going to be in the pulpit i'm going to stand out here because i'm going to be pointing at these notes and i'm going to show you the quotes okay my job as a pastor is to say what's set on tape everybody in this room has got their own opinion your opinion is good as mine but i'm going to say what's said on tape and so i'm going to say here and we're going to read through these notes and then i'm going to comment a little bit on them okay so i want you to know it's good to be here a brother asked me last night or not not ask me ask an open question i don't know if i see him but he asked about where are we in the aspect of time where are we at right now and so i had that same uh question in my heart so i went back i said okay where do i need to go to see where we're at you know the two things that talk about time daniel's 70 weeks the church ages the seals right come out of the church ages the four beasts right and then the trumpets with israel and if you'll understand these things you'll understand exactly where you're at and you won't have any doubts you won't have any questions but we need to know where we're at if we know where we're at we know where we're going if i'm going to get to atlanta don't i have to know where i'm at to get to atlanta so god has given us a message to let us know what has been what is happening and what will happen there's no way i can be lost there's no way i can be lost there's no way i can be unsaved do you understand that god has given me a revelation that's going to put me in the new heaven and new earth i'm excited the cove had fallen and the world fallen apart again i am excited because i know i'm getting out of here very soon okay so we're going to go to me i i want you to look to title what i said the spoken seals of matthew 24. i don't know if you guys know it jesus spoke the seals in matthew 24 spoke them john wrote symbol form what they were what he saw and then we had a prophet come for the third part of this to give us the revelation of what was spoke and what was put in symbol form so see i have i have no question where i'm at in this great scheme of god is that right and brother wade's been preaching on the eternal redemption this kind of falls right in that line so we're going to talk about kind of some of the things that i think that we missed that we need to get caught up to where we're at right that's what it is okay so we're going to turn in your bibles if you want to follow along matthew 24 1 and jesus went out and departed from the temple and his disciples came to him for to show him the buildings of the temple they had been to the church that morning on the sabbath jesus had went in there they had read the scrolls they had all had a good time they were leaving and the the apostles said look at this temple that our fathers and that's a beautiful we got to we built this pretty church and jesus said the whole thing's going to be destroyed there ain't going to be a rock left on another one you think i want to shower them and then you know what he did after he preached that he walked right up on the mount of olives didn't explain it just walked right up it's what he's doing and jesus said unto them see not all these things see not right the kingdom of god is not seeing by observation see not verily i say to you there shall not be left here one stone upon another that shall not be thrown down do you think that wasn't a shock to them shocker huh and as he said upon the mount of olives disciple come to him privately right privately saying tell us right when shall these things be what shall be the sign of thy coming and of the end of the world so there's three things that he's answering here three questions jesus is going to answer all three right that's what they are shall these things when shall these things be when shall all the temple be tore down we already know that's history titus did that what shall be the sign of thy coming so remember israel has a sign they seeketh after a sign there's going to be a sign given of thy coming and of the end of the world so this has to do with events times he's showing you exactly what's going to be before the end okay that's exactly what and jesus is going to speak these things so this what is the original word spoken words original seed he spoke it right that's if you're going to start something didn't don't doesn't god have to send a prophet to speak at the start events to start happening jesus spoke something here to start something is that right and that's what he's doing here okay let's bow our heads if you would dear heavenly father we thank you for the reading of the word now i pray that you're quickening it to the people lord it's not a dead letter where we live it's a quickening power it's a living where it's made flesh in the people the word and you are the word it's god made flesh in this end time lord in and through his bride lord now be with us in this service and give us leadership in jesus christ's name we ask it amen you may be seated lord bless you i want to read a quote out of the sixth seal brother branham preached first seal through the fifth seal brother branham hardly mentioned matthew 24. he gets to the sixth seal and all of a sudden he's bringing into focus the matthew 24 and there's a real purpose in that because brother branham is trying to show you exactly where we're at when that brother last night i don't know where he's at i can't see him here but he said okay you asked we're kind of where we're at right when you see the covet falling don't you think where are we at in this great right all the events you see what's happening in the political world you see america falling apart and you're saying where are we at you know you want to know don't you want to know where you're at today be kind of kind of be senseless you didn't know where you're at and so here brother brown's going to stop and he's going to he takes time he says okay now i'm going to preach out of matthew 24. i'm going to show you in matthew 24 what was spoken and i'm going to line it up with revelation chapter six what was put in symbol form does everybody understand remember we said yesterday if you could hear a message i could hear a message you may hear more or less of what i hear and i may hear more or less so by putting these two together you're going to get the whole scope of what's going on with just matthew 24 it's hard to put it together but when you get and combine it with revelation chapter 6 it'll give you a clear view of exactly where we're at okay and that's where we all want to be he says here the sea i'm going to jump to the sixth seal and i thought under this sixth seal when the holy spirit broke it forth there i seen what it was then i thought i'd be it'd be a good thing to give the class i gotta line it up where i can see i'm getting blind as i get older to give the class a little something different tonight his approach in the sixth seal he's gonna give something a little different you aren't just gonna hear me speak i'm going to put it in the scriptures for you to read he did all of them but really focus in on matthew 24 and revelation chapter 6 okay because it might be uh where am i it might be tiring you just i did that i put it in red shame on me listen to me talk talking at the time so i thought that we'd do something different okay this great event was sealed under the blood of the mystery of redemption what's he been preaching eternal redemption right does everybody understand that it's going right along with what he's saying right along with what you asked okay now the lamb has it in his hand is going to break it now let's look to matthew the 24th chapter okay you go there if you want the lamb himself speaking not just simple form speaking okay he's emphasizing that now anyone knows that christ is the author of the whole book as far as he's concerned but this is his speech here or his sermon too now i want to i want you to read this this right here what i got in yelling very important listen to what it says does everybody know that when jesus speaks through the we always said this i know brother samuel you probably he said well the seals are the gentiles trumpets are the jews everybody ever anybody ever heard that am i the only one that heard that right so if jesus is speaking to the jews and he's talking seals isn't that a little different i thought the plan of redemption for the jews is through the trumpets everybody understand what i'm talking about so right away brother brahma is going to point us to something and show you how they overlap the seals and the trumpets ever laugh and they're all a part of the plan of redemption redemption for the gentiles redemption for the jews does everybody understand there's two classes of people look at this here he said so he's speaking out out of whoops i hit the button sorry i do that at my church too did i get that lost hold on where are we at here technical difficulties uh wait a minute what happened where'd the quote go oh right there it is right here they changed my colors already did that color change or am i going crazy did the brothers do that to me back there well thank you i appreciate what did he say he stuck his head through there well you lost me there i was looking for red thank you for that i thought i'd really gotten a mess here okay so listen to what he says here his speech his sermon to the the people and to the jews amen this matthew 24 is not just to the gentiles it's the gentile and jews amen who's he talking to in matthew 24 jews were there but he said this sermon is not just for these jews that i'm addressing out here it's to the people too does everybody see what he's saying okay so this is very important now i want to hold your book like this matthew 24 and revelation 6 like this let's compare something here just a little bit so watch this now and you can find out just how it is see what the lamb here is showing exactly in symbol form what he said over here in the word right okay doing exactly so that makes it right so that makes it right the mouth of two or three witnesses let these things be established right doing exactly so that makes it right now that there is to it here here's one he's talking to it and here's where it happens see it's just a perfect vindication now look let's look at 24th chapter of saint matthew revelation 6 compare the 24th chapter of matthew we all know that was the chapter that every scholar every scholar no every nobody's excluded out of this every scholar every person goes to talk to about the tribulation period what's the seal is he preaching in when he's talking about this now i'm going to tell you there's two parts of the sixth seal i'm gonna get a little ahead of myself one part of it is investigating judgment the other part of it is tribulation does everybody understand what i'm talking about so if you're putting a sixth seal all the way over there in the tribulation period then what does that have to do with me right does everybody understand remember that's what spoke of theirs to all the people amen you're a part of these things you understand i see your faces you're not got it yet but you're going to before we get through today i promise you i'm going to cover it okay so we know that this chat every scholar every one of them this is a tribulation period comes out of the 24th uh chapter now i'm going to go to the first seal so i'm going to go to the first seal and show you where he's talking matthew 24 and he's talking in six to show you he's one says a little more than the other when you go to matthew 24 saint luke 17 is the same luke is telling what he heard matthew is telling what he heard and it'll be a little different here you'll get more here than what you get here and between the two of them it'll paint a picture for you and you can draw it together and it'll make everything clear has everybody got it that's what jesus all these things that jesus does the seals and in 6 and 24 he's just trying to get it to us is that right you know as a preacher how many times we preach the same sermon over and over one service we take one approach another one another and then finally everybody i'll look out there and you're all going you got it when i'm looking out there and some of you going and others are going you know your face responds one of my favorite quotes in the message brother branham was preaching one time he said i wish you could see the devil's face now who is he looking at you ever think of that he was looking at the people do you know you will express how you feel when i used to be a deacon in our church i sat on a platform and i could watch people come and what i did is i looked at people if they come in and they were limping they got problems if you got pain you will not smile unless you're crazy right when you're not happy do you smile somebody help me here so when i would watch people and i look at people i'd see a sad face i'd you know what i'd instantly do i dropped my head and start praying for them i know something's bothering them it may be depression it may be whatever's after them lord i'm praying for them that you'll get them through you know what i'm saying because i want to see everybody smiling don't you i don't know about you but i want to be happy i've been through a lot in my natural body the last four years and i am determined to be happy today i could have died it could have really went south for me you understand but i am determined to be happy i am not going to major on sad i'm going to major on being happy and god wants you to be happy this morning he gave you the best thing he could give you this message of the hour the sweetest thing it's sweet do you understand i have partaken of it and this message is sweet the bitterness comes when you digest it and the persecution the tribulations when people die out of our audience my mama passed away three years ago i can't hardly talk about her i'll start crying so i can't hardly talk about her because i'd loved her so much you know we suffer many things in this natural body god's not mad at you you understand it's a character builder i've come out on the other side i know i'm not the man i was four years ago i know i'm not so the first seal let's go there matthew 24 4 if you want to catch it and jesus answered and said uh did i do that again where am i at where am i at oh send it to them okay there you go thank you i may have to get off my clicker and let them click i got two 70 inch monitor in mind and i go back back boy i guess cruz so matthew 24 4. and jesus answered and said unto them take heed that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i am christ and shall deceive many look at the sixth seal notice now we're going to read first then he answered them and said to them thank you he's going to start to answering now and we want to compare it with the seals now watch the first seals revelation 6 1 2. okay now we read 6-1-2 and i saw the lamb when he had opened one of the seals and i heard as it were a noise of a thunder one of the four beasts saying come and see the first four seals the beasts say come and see everybody knows what those beasts are right lion ox man flying eagle amen i tell the church i don't like to use eagle i like flying eagle there's difference in an eagle's person on a rock waiting for a rabbit to be killed down in the valley or go kill it i want to be a flying eagle because you know what a flying eagle is he sees a far off this is a flying eagle we have come up hither i'm not just an eagle sitting on a mountain somewhere looking down in the valley i am flying and i'm seeing a far off all the way to the new heaven and new earth flying eagle okay i love that i don't want to just be an eagle i want to be a flying eagle you know the eagle that's down the ground he's usually going through that what dropping season remember i'm not dropping where i'm at i'm flying okay i want you to know that okay so then he answered and said compared with okay and i saw the lamb when it opened okay and i saw it behold a white horse so you have a lion and a white horse every time the devil does something god raises the standard against it the white horse come out and then god raised a standard to get a lion is that right okay and what did he do the white horse he hadn't a bow he had no arrows he's just a bluff the antichrist is a bluff brother antichrist can't faze me anymore he's a bluff he's got a bow but it ain't going to get me got no arrows right okay uh he went forth conquering to conquer and who would find this fellow was antichrist matthew 24 now 4 and 5. and jesus answered said to them take he that no man deceive you for many shall come in my name saying i'm crushed shall deceive money is that saying the same thing right amen right okay let's go up now see it antichrist this there's your seal let's go a second i don't want to spend a whole lot of time on first four seals but i'm gonna spend a whole lot of time on the fifth six and seven not even the seventh you everybody knows what seventh seal is coming of the lord there's three parts to it coming of the lord an unknown tongue let me ask you when you were in pentecost somebody spoke in an unknown tongue who could interpret that only god amen now somebody in the audience would stand up with a gift of interpretation but really god can only interpret an unknown tongue and then what's the last part of it the end of all things so this seven seal when it's open goes all the way the coming lord all the way to the end of all things everybody understand does everybody understand when the white horse rider starts to ride when that rider when that rider got off the white horse onto the red horse the white horse kept going amen the antichrist is still here today do you agree did he stop when he got on the red horse the antichrist no no those so those writers write all the way to the end okay spirit antichrist is alive and well today okay now the second seal matthew 24 6 revelation 6 3 and 4. now watch matthew 6 4 24 6. now let me see what it says all ye shall hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you be troubled not for all these things must come to pass but the end is not yet okay then brother branham here i corrected it brother rem said all right let's take the second seal revelation 3 and 2. well you got to go three and four right see brother brown did make mistakes when he was talking everybody got that do we need a five-fold ministry to break it down for the people yeah people think we don't need a five-fold ministry anymore people don't think we got to go to church what do people think anymore i thought a christian went to church i thought the people said under a pastor i mean that's the unbeliever out there won't come to church and won't have a pastor people in this message think they don't have to come to church they sit at home listen to tapes and they think they don't have to have rapturing faith somebody some people ask me they call me me i'm a dummy why are they calling me it's like what are you calling me for they'll say well i'm going to this church and i got this pastor should i leave and go somewhere else you know what i always ask them does your pastor preach rapturing faith that stops them dead right there they'll go oh oh i thought well do you not know if they preach rapture in faith and i say do they preach yeah i said then you better stay there because about 10 of the message churches preach rapturing faith the rest of them are into emotion feeling and feeling good and i want to feel good but the stimulation of revelation is what makes me feel good you can sing a song like sound like the archangel by the way lucifer-led songs in heaven did you know that lucifer right he exalted himself above god he thought he was better than a preacher right we got news for him oh some of these message people need to get a revelation that's what we lack right so he opened it second beast what was it red horse okay let's go i want to keep i'm going to go through these fast you everybody in here know what four horses are right i'm gonna say it real quick rather than read it so i can get through it because i want to get to five first white horse and then god raised up a standard lion second the red horse god raised up a standard an ox does anybody know what a dog says a converted bull he's had the fight taken out of him you know what brother branham said i love this quote to me this quote makes a second seal as real to me he said he was talking about predestination he said why predestination is one of the oldest doctrines in the bible irenaeus preached that if you were predestinated and know where you stand with god does it matter if they tart and feathered you and burnt you would it matter if they hung you on a cross if you got predestination and you know you're going to make it to the other side they had the spirit of the ox on them for that age and they said got the fight taken out of me man kill this body and i'm gonna you're just sitting next before you blink i'm gonna be on the other side so they had their little red horse with their sword killing 68 million protestants didn't lose the one all that the father hath given me will come to me what is that predestination they had a revelation of predestination sam and they go here you know paul had him he said they're gonna chop my head off didn't even tie him up here just gave it up right he was ready to go he said i fought a good fight finished the course let me go so that's what it was okay god raises the standard then we come to the man what is man intelligence right what is the dark horse rider you remember three measures uh three pennies for a measure of barley it was all about money the catholic church was doing indulgences they trapped the entire money of the world those 68 million that were martyred you know where their farms and their money went to the catholic church everybody understand that very rich the black horse rider and what did it come up the intelligence of men under that we had luther we had wesley right so let me tell you something i said it last night your intelligence will take you a long way you ought to go read some of wesley's stuff knox finney dwight moody if you've never read some of those i have those were highly intelligent they were smarter than we were brother samuel you go and go take a test to iq they'd beat me hands down they had intelligence and it took them a long way but it took more than intelligence it took a revelation from god that's what we received in this prophet of this hour this elijah ministry the coming of the lord we got a revelation from god it's going to take you further than man's intelligence further than your intelligence will ever take you let's go up okay so then we have the next one's a pale horse the pale horse is the white red and black all mixed together and what is the pale horse death amen amen what did brother branham say when he preached the fourth seal we got a name it's got a name now what is his name death what did he say denominationalism was death what is denominationalism in this message death if you denominate separate yourself from people shame on you you're supposed to have brotherly kindness you're supposed to draw the circle bigger i teach at our church you go to the old testament remember moab remember the children of israel were coming out and they went to the land of moab they went to the elders of jerusalem of israel said we'll pay for the grass we'll pay for the water their animals larp up you know what the moab said we want you out of here we don't like we're cousins and we don't like you who'll give you your biggest problem ken folk loan somebody in your family uh money and see if you get it back i told the people at church if you're loaning the money to somebody you know plan on not getting it back and if you do fine yeah isn't that right that's the way i do it i said if you ain't got it to give tell them you got it to give solve that problem quick okay so what is it death denominationalism you'd be a one-man denomination one man right have that spirit on you death okay now let's go up let's go run it up the fifth seal i want to go there okay because brother he said i got an iron 20 minutes and you ain't got a clock would i see is there a clock in here somewhere am i missing it where oh there it is okay i'll say i knew i'd have to hurry and i got to where i could i've had five eye surgeries the last two years i'm telling you what i ain't got a good part in my body yet i'm slap dab wore out brother samuel i am ready to get out of here in my heart i'm saying even so lord come quickly all these things that are happening people going over you know what i've found i'm crying in my heart there's no reason for me to be here anymore even so lord come quickly get me out what brethren says holding up the rapture the readiness of the bride i'm not looking for an event i'm looking to get ready let's just get ready okay okay go up that's that's the fourth seal right there right there okay and brother wade i talked to him about it i'm sure you've mentioned it brother blade can't keep anything quiet i tell him and i'm the same way unfortunately okay so matthew 24 9. let's read that then shall they deliver you up to be afflicted shall kill you and ye shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake amen does everybody see that says for namesake that's important hold that and then show now does israel were they under eichmann hitler mussolini's daughter were they killed for the lord for the namesake no nations for my name sake who's this talking my name's sake it's jesus they didn't accept jesus and brother branham placed the fifth sealed jews here you know what it was five you know what five is in god's economy grace we're still in the the gentile dispensation and god saved 6 million jews huh pretty interesting don't you think but now listen so he said this is for the people and for the jews everybody got why he said that that trapped it okay then shall be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another boy that sounds like now don't it you think the fifth ceiling they'll hate you without a cause it says here hate you one another and many shall false prophets shall rise and deceive many is that in this hour yeah this fifth seal is applying to this hour and because iniquity shall abound you know what iniquity is something you know to do and you don't amen iniquity and the love of many a wax cold doesn't it say in thessalonians that at that day the love of many will wax cold or more scripture says that than here right but i want you to key in on this but he that shall endure endure endure does anybody know what endure is you ever been on an endurance race you ever run a long ways that's endurance right endure the same shall be saved you know what that is that's to us if the fifth seal is only to the jews why did i even have to hear it the fifth seal does apply to me i am the one and you're the one sitting here that's enduring till the end right your husband and dear endured to the end that's grace he continued in the faith what i said this stature of a perfect man is it's continuance it's endurance you start out here you're born again down here a lot of people think you're born again up there no you're born again down here you've got faith right and you keep enduring and you keep growing in the knowledge and the grace of god fifth seal you see five grace and you come up here and then god gives you virtue he said these are a gifts even though it says as you add to it you can't even add to your stature you know what the bible says i can't add these things to me the way i add them is to keep in the message they are keep enduring when somebody dies i still go i continue up up up i don't sit there and get down and fall away and in and out brother brown says when you get to birth you're in your up and downs are over see i don't got that will i get depressed in the flesh i guarantee you when i had four heart attacks three heart attacks in three years you think i wasn't depressed i had a gallbladder you can't believe how bad that thing was three years they wouldn't do anything i was having a gallbladder attack every four days screamers i called them the neighbors thought my wife was beating me seriously i don't know if any of us anybody had a gallbladder attack in the air rough oh did it hurt well they took mine out too sister finally they took mine out in december i was in the hospital christmas and i've gained 30 pounds i was but i drink water and have an attack you know what i'll tell this i want to show you how this natural body is such a phenomenon and how you here are even far above that the doctor finally i i'd had a heart attack had a bad gall bladder they wouldn't take it out you got to wait a year those stents got to set a year we can't disturb them gall bladder attack all black next year okay i'm approaching the year sister peggy i'm going to get it out all is well another heart attack another year another heart attack another year finally i told the guys that i will i'll do anything to get this out i'll sign a waiver she said well you'll die if we do it while you're in the hospital i said i don't care i said would you get this i feel like i got something eaten from the inside out would you get this out i begged them nope we'll i'll wait three months waited three months and i got one surgeon that would do it nobody else wanted to he when he did that surgery he said my stomach and the rest of my organs were so swollen that they they wear your gallbladder they swole up and attach themselves to the gallbladder my gallbladder had been gangrene for no telling how long i should have died sister peggy he said your organs your organs were so swollen in your body they swell up and attach their self to you he said it took me 30 minutes to get your stomach off from your gallbladder they had to tear it off so your uncomely members when one is sick among you we get around them we'll forfeit ourself and we'll get around them if that would have leaked into my body that gangrene i would have died he said once i pulled everything away and got to your gall bladder he said it come out in pieces he said i grabbed it and he just fell off and he said like 10 pieces i said well how bad was he said the worst gallbladder i've ever seen in 10 years worse see how good god is to us you think i didn't suffer a lot of days man oh it was and so now i've gained 30 pounds i'm going on a diet when i get home so you understand the fifth seal is an endurance thing it gives you the ability god has gifted you with something here he has given you grace in this church where you can endure where the other guy can when you've got guys sitting next to you in church falling away he's given you something he's given you grace by grace are you saved through faith and not of your own works now under that seal since it's to the people and of the jews right we understand that okay let's go up now i'm going to get the sixth seal and you go back and look at the fifth i'll cover this somebody was asking the sister about ezekiel the four living creatures do you understand i went and re-read the fifth seal all over in the sixth seal all over brother wade this way i studied more last week than i do at my church when i go out and preach it's harder on me than when i stay at home i don't have to do nearly the study you know what i mean but sam knows what that's like to go to another church man because you want to you want to be sure you're saying the right things you know but in the fifth seal brother branham explains this and he gets on the beast he said now the first seal the beast said come and see the lion the second one the beast said come and see the ox the next one the third come and see the man the next one come and see the eagle does everybody got that the fifth seal there is no living creatures announcing that it says he said this is christ that's going to reveal this to you by grace are you saved through faith the only way you're going to get this fifth seal is if god reveals it to you everybody got that the sixth seal not announced by a beast the seventh seal not announced by a beast is that right and i'm going to tell you something the four living creatures are the ministry amen the eagle is the ministry for this hour does everybody understand that the the lion was the ministry in paul's day they said in paul's day they got to look see that finger how messed up it is everything on my ain't got a good part on my body i can't donate if something you needed a part i couldn't give it to you don't look at me i can't give you a part okay i'm wore out so you know what the believers in paul's day did they put their finger on their nose brother and said you ain't saying what paul said is that a lion you know what a lion is type a personality just pounced right on them said hey you're not saying what paul said right so those four living creatures are the ministry that god has rose up in that hour so people think they don't need a ministry are you nuts have you people in the message some of you lost your mind you need a ministry you need the eagle ministry you need the son of man ministry everybody understand that okay let's go uh because that's the fifth seal okay uh let's go up let's see where we're at uh uh it's martyrdom we know he said that right but everybody sees they say oh that's 144 jews that's in the future no get that out of your head it's for now these people are and they die for his namesake those six million jews that are under the altar did they die for his namesake sister peggy for the word of god and their testimony is what it says right okay that's the sixth seal now the sixth seal is the one we're coming to now sixth seal he's preaching the sixth seal right here we are now we're going to get also revelation 6 12 1-7 that's exactly what we just read now listen to this now it's what jesus said in matthew 29 24 29 and 30. i didn't really catch the whole whole of this until i preached it here a while back and this excites me and what we're going to get into now remember everybody got your bibles if you got it go to 24 9 9 or 24 29 is everybody here the last time or not the last time time for i preached it back way back probably 2012 here about the age of aquarius you know i took this scripture and preached it out of it i want to bring it to you go back and listen to it or they don't get it posted that far back but you can get it if you want it and i'm going to cover that a little bit here in a minute under this seal okay immediately after the tribulation of those days what this tribulation this amateur tribulation that we've went through here what's he talking about the persecution of the 6 million jews that was an amateur tribulation you know what brother branham said another quote it's a type of tribulation does everybody understand what a type is it's a shadow of things to come those 6 million jews was a type of what's fixing to happen in tribulation will 144 000 be killed will the foolish virgins be killed will the earth be burnt over everybody get what i'm saying right okay but that's grace amen right brother that's grace right amen nothing but gray remember brother branson said that german guy had his it was in germany was talking about well they had six million that died in the in the uh dark ages he he said god was this old doty white-haired god sitting on a throne with his arms crossed around remember he said that and he said can you believe that god let 68 million people die yeah but were they all saved we don't know but if if if they were under that if they were predestinated they were saved right sure so it's just brother i'm saying it's the tender hand of jehovah he said the six million it died was a tender hand to jehovah kind of different what we think huh immediately half tribulation of those days that's eichmann and them the sun shall be darkening the moon does everybody remember how that we had how the sun was dark how the the church age pictures remember the the the moon was darkened to where it went into a total eclipse remember laodicea was totally dark do you know brother branham was allowed to write light in that do you know that laodicea was completely dark now let me ask you something i'm going to get this is a real big doctrinal thing do you think you're in laodicea you're in a bright age i don't call you church anymore brother i'll call you bride if you're in the church ages i got to call you church church ages everybody got it it was totally black why we ain't in the church ages no more i'm in the bright age people everybody understand that if you're in a church age you're under laodicea you're under a church uh somebody that's born of a woman is a how's it go he's in song proverb a man that's born of a woman it's a full day's and full of trouble if you're the church you're born of a woman you know i've talked to people in this message this is something that just gets on me quicker than anything i'll talk to somebody goes to a certain message and all they want to talk about their church their church their church i get off the phone and said did he even say one thing about christ are they born of a church or are you born of christ think about it you're not in the church age anymore you're not under the church you're a bright age you've had an invisible union with him you are so above the church now let me ask you something in a sixth seal does the church go through tribulation the church does does the bride go through tribulation let me tell you something you better get out of that church thing amen the church is your mama and she'll raise you to a certain age and then you got to get it on your own big boy you can't stay on the milk all the time mama will give you the milk but sooner or later you got to get it for yourself you better get into that bride age does everybody understand that brother branham said 120 coats were beyond pentecost what was the pentecostal age right see people want to take us back to pentecost you know i got a quote not having to hear i'm going to say it it's going to be a shocker brother said he didn't like the word pentecost he said pentecost was those people that were down there celebrating the 50. the ones in the upper room were apostolic it doesn't say in the bible he'll turn your heart back to the pentecostal fathers everybody in the message wants to turn you back to a pentecost all the hoopty do they're jumping up and down huh they're laying on the hands is that what they want prayer lines huh i'm not against that i want you to understand but that's not my emphasis my emphasis is christ the word your emphasis better be on this message on the word and you better get in it it better be in you and you better get in it okay time's running out people we are real close to the end of this thing so immediately after tribulation the sun and the moon i say seven church ages remember it was dark did did the moon go dark did we have an eclipse okay listen what it says uh the moon shall not give her light that's when it hap and the stars shall fall from heaven and the powers of heaven shall be shaken and then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven listen to this this is right here this is 30 is that right 29 was immediately after those days after the persecution of the jews this is when they appear the sign of the son of man amen now brother branham says this is the sixth seal that's right everybody hear what i'm saying brother branham says this is the sixth seal i didn't say it brother branham said it everybody got that out i went out and looked at one of your messages you did brother sam i wanted to see how you stood on it and he's right you know what brother's saying no i didn't you're laughing sister peggy you know he's right you know what he i know what he says right this guy's right this is one of the best preachers i've ever heard in my life you guys have been so blessed here with this man [Applause] look at look what he's put together look at this look at the people i mean i've never been in a church like this brother sam i'll be on or you have your living room you preach and people get it i mean you don't get that anywhere you preach what i'm preaching here to most message churches they'll think i land i'm a martian like i'm from outer space somewhere like i fell off a rock so brother and i'm going to say it ahead of time you can go read it i've got the quotes in here if you want to read it go out to the internet they're going to post it and you'll read it this is the sixth seal so everybody's thinking the sixth seal is when it's there's two and it's it is that two so brother this is why he said it and i think it's a really good he said you won't go through tribulation but you will go through persecution anybody remember that message he preached is that what he said that's what i'm telling you too do you know what the persecution is judgment you know what brother branham said education is of the devil is that judgment he said in 1956 he said in 1956 america you're getting your final jubilee in 1957 he said i don't pray for her anymore is that judgment he said politics is of the devil is that judgment i tried to tell our people and i preached and preached but stay out of that crazy stuff out there politics brother random sentence of the devil and i had people in my church saying well i'm i'm trump i'm for tr and a guy's been married three times and his wife's a ex-porno star did you know that would you you know what in our right mind would i vote for a guy like that is that the best we can produce in america you know what my answer is uh-huh shows were it's been judged a prophet or when you don't receive elijah the prophet he's a grace prophet brother ram said elijah prophets to the world he's a grace prophet when you refuse grace what do you have coming has america as a whole refused our prophet what do they what are we living in judgment this coveted 19 fallen is nothing but judgment brother branham said the flu of 1918 was a plague did you know he said that do you know covet 19 is just another flu but it's a better bigger strain of it a new strain that's why they don't know how to fight it because we don't have a natural immunity to it or antibodies built up it's a plague following people now let me ask you something was israel in egypt when the things were starting to fall now if you die a coven 19 it doesn't mean that you're an egyptian it means your cadillac showed up and you just went over does everybody understand you gotta you gotta have a revelation with them you you know those heart attacks i never thought god was trying to kill me i never hollered out in the hospital one time when i had my gallbladder god are you trying to kill me i knew he wasn't trying to kill god don't want to kill me but you know what if i die it's my cadillac what is death to you i passed from death to life death you can no more die than god can die didn't brother brown say that what are you worried about death now i'll be honest with you i think you ought to go get a vaccine because there's no immunities to this one the flu we've had it in the world for 1918 your mama had it you've had how many in here have had the flu hold up your hand every time you get it your build up antibodies against it and it's harder to get this rascals a new strain of it and your body has no immunity to it 95 of the people that get the vaccine if they get it they don't have it as bad sister peggy you know what i did i haven't taken a flu shot in 20 years and i haven't had the flu i went and got this rascal i thought uh uh buddy you know why in 11 22 my song leader died a miserable death he got blood clots and i've never heard anybody yet that got blood clots with this government that lived not one this is tough people this is tough god gave you a coconut use it what i tell our people your intellect will go a long way right this head that god gave you will go way up the ladder and where it can't take your revelational finishing so god gave me a coconut up here and he kind of expects me to use it right huh okay if you don't get the vaccine that's your deal i'm not trying to tell you to or not too but i'm telling you i did i don't regret i had to fl a covet by the way i had a heart attack september 15th i had to covet over october the 15th had my gallbladder out ginger said i ruined her christmas this year i said ho ho i was in the hospital on december 20. she got so mad at me because i run her christmas sister peggy i thought i'm up here screaming and you're worried about christmas i said i'm not worried about i just said ho ho ho get over it there's next christmas you know sixth seal now read over here in revelation now the sixth seal the one we are right now and behold when he had opened the sixth seal and though there was a great earthquake and the sun became like a saffroff of hair and the moon became his blood are we having a lot of blood moons now how many blood moons have you seen here lately i was have you ever heard of a blood moon until here recently i went out and looked up what is a blood moon you want me to tell you remember jesus when his his sweat looked as like blood you know what that was a blood moon did anybody know that that was a blood moon he was standing there he had prayed and he got sweaty and that red that blood moon was shining it looked like he said he's appeared as blood he didn't say it was blood you're pulling that's why i'm looking at you okay everybody else is too but you're pulling okay that's the way it happens with me blood moon does everybody understand that we're having all these blood you know what blood moon means in the in the time of isabella and king ferdinand and spain in 1492 or 52 someday they had a blood moon you know what happened right after that they said the jews couldn't be in spain anymore they told them to pack their luggage they took them out on ships they dumped they kept their luggage and killed them and dumped them in the ocean you know what hitler did pack your luggage jews we're going to relocate you just exactly what king ferdinand and isabella was telling them in spain they packed their luggage does anybody know a jew they ain't gonna be far from their money brother sam they had it no luggage right so when they got to the track before they gassed them they threw their luggage over here they had people going through it right and they took them to the ovens the same thing that happened blood moons when you see a blood moon innocent blood is going to be shed the blood moon when jesus prayed let this cat cut past was innocent blood shed and king ferdinand was innocent bloodshed every time you see a blood moon it's an announcement there's going to be innocent bloodshed now something that's why we're having them a lot of innocents out there stars of heaven fell into the earth and fig tree casts are untimely figs which is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll as it rolled together in every mountain every island moved out of their place wow not every island but do you know when they had that earthquake in japan that the gps coordinates in japan has changed 13 feet do you know that took that island out of its place that's something isn't it what is that why are these things happening sister p it's a type a type we're in the shadow the type of things that's fixing the rain down when that sixth seal opens at its fullness to the jews does everybody understand that's why brother branham said it's an amateur tribulation what happened to those those six million it's going to be a full-blown tribulation that's what's going to happen to 144 000. everybody got it this we're living in now is a type of the tribulation will we go through persecution yeah will we go through the tribulation the great part of it or when this thing is in its fullness no that's what brother sam was saying i read his notes he said it okay but we're sitting here we don't realize where we're at and we're sitting here not any condemnation to you you say we look at the of what's going on what is this going on amateur tribulation a type of the tribulation the shadow of it's falling all around us politics is corrupt been judged why do i care about paul what does politics have to do with me brother bram said i'm not a republican i'm not a democrat i'm a christian do we not understand that brother baby said you could put an abraham lincoln and george washington and wall at every corner and you ain't going to turn it around do you think trump was going to turn it around brother branham said by quote it's going to get worse and worse and worse is it is it getting tougher for you is the message getting sweeter to you is grace abounding with you that's what that five you know what in that fifth seal what i love he's seen that 93 year old woman and he said there he's seen the sisters he's seen the brothers and over the hill come running this woman he said i'll say it like i'd say it knock your socks off beautiful drop dead gorgeous you understand that right right he's going he said you know who she is no i don't know who she is she was 93 years old right well she was saved in one of your meetings that's in the fifth seal see the grace of it is sister peggy look at that 66 year old guy and i'm gonna be in this well i know how gorgeous it'll be i'll i'll stop there on that one okay i'll watch it boy this guy good job he says okay so does everybody understand he said in the mountains and rocks following us go up for the great day of the wrath has come and who shall be who shall be able to stand right let's read here let's go up to the quote it's perfectly turned right back see what jesus said here now in matthew 24 29 listen after this eichmann case and so forth amen immediately after the tribulation of these days after this eichmann case do you realize that brother branham was preaching this in 63 do you realize uh eichmann was put to death he said right after does everybody see that 63 eichmann was killed and hung in israel in 531. did you know that kind of he's putting these little markers if i was wanting to go to atlanta i'd drive 12 miles that says atlanta whatever 30. there's markers god has placed in the scripture markers to let us know exactly where we at are in the scheme of the process of getting out of here god ain't going to let you sit and go i wonder where i'm at am i saved am i not saved am i going to have to go through this am i going to have to go through that no god's already revealed those things to us we know exactly we're on the road and you know what it's about time for me to get out of here i have arrived i just can't see this thing going on much longer brother sam so take courage take i want you guys to be happy and take courage we're at the end of this thing you have been the one that has grace that's endured to the end of this thing i've come to the message in 1985 sister peggy i thought i was the last one in 85 i thought oh thank you jesus i'm the last one so 35 years later sister i've been enduring this thing every devil in hell's been aimed at me my friends i don't have many of them to begin with but i sure have a whole lot less since the message come but i've been enduring this thing brother wade and it's grace the way i can endure is just stay in the group this message is the message of grace stay in the message it's grace it's absolutely the fifth seal to me you understand it's gonna i may get to be 93 years old oh god i hope not there could be nothing left to me then but if i do then i'm going to show up on the other side in this 20 year old body am i the only one in this church that's old that every time i see a young person say oh i want to be that i want to be in that new but my wife said i am not aging gracefully at all she does sister peggy it makes me mad i don't want to get old does anybody in this room want to get old i see that little girl that stood up yesterday went like that with her shoulders i thought oh man i used to be that way wasn't nearly as good looking but i was that way i had all that here now what if i couldn't even stand up like that brother terrence if i dropped a coin now on the parking lot i don't even pick it up i don't care if it was a if it's a quarter a dime a nickel i drop it and i go somebody will pick it up somebody's gonna get blessed today cause i ain't picking it up if there ain't a wall or a car there where i can crawl up it right i drop something in the middle of my garage it'll stay there a week before i pick it up okay so brother brown is showing us and putting signposts where we're at okay so here we are the moon shall not give our light stars have fallen then shall appear the sign of the son of man in heaven and they shall see i don't want to send forth his okay now this one is 31. does everybody understand that brother branham says 29 and 30 is the sixth seal but guess what he also says this is the sixth

opposite direction where god was going isn't that right pentecostal argue oh my gosh i grew up in pentecost arguing about the message people are even worse oh you've been through that arguing stage with them why it's like arguing with the fence post they're still in the church ages going opposite direction but under the aquarian age you're under the son of man you know brother branham said when people had trouble he said what was your birthday because you're born under a sign it influences you your name influences you does everybody agree with that i was not born under i'm taurus i'm a bull let that stay there for a while that's what i am but when i was born again i was born under the aquarian age which you know what the sign of the aquarian age is the son of man we have entered in to

he have a white wig on what did brother brown say a white wig was judge get it right did he come as a white wigged one is that sixth seal of judgment seal did he come as judge that's why brother ramp said education is of the devil he was a son of man revealing these son of man he said science or you know he talked about it now look education now you you know what i advise every young person here to do go to college brother branham didn't expect you to be a blooming idiot in the mess we'd all be a bunch of dummies if we didn't go to school right that's not what he meant he met educa look can you that stuff they're teaching now isn't that absolutely insanity shoving it down our kids throats and the kids are going to be have messed up ideas they're going to have a difference between black and whites because they're differentiating in school quit differentiating it let's just get together and have fun and be happy right i mean i want you to have the same privilege as i do i do i want you to have a high education there's no reason why you can't right now i understand there are some bigots out there buddy i understand that i've seen them they're out there but i'm telling you guys you have the ability to do what you want to do the only one that's going to stop you is you and the government trying to make you sound like you're different you can't get ahead brother i'm telling you i've worked with some black people the smartest people i ever worked with they have the same abilities a white man has but you got to take them you get out there and you work and i'll guarantee you you'll do good if somebody stops you just go around them brother brown said that old crow eating beans remember the old scarecrow right around you know what he said dude just hop around and keep on eating down the road that's what we all got to do in life right so how did he come the coming of the lord go read it white wigged one yeah you know what he's here to do now to judge you know what this message is doing here right now it's judging you it's judging me it's judging you scripture says judge yourselves lest you be judged who judges you the word how did he come in this hour in the fullness of the word how could he judge you if he had just part the word if he just had a part of justification how could he judge us but we've got the fullness of the word that's fell in our laps right now and now god can say she's my bride i have judged her she's walking in the message the hour she's clothed in the wedding garment of my word huh she's kept working while the other ones out there are having a big hoopty-do you know he mentions that too in that seal did you know that remember a little farm girl barefoot didn't look like much right wasn't out there hoopty doing it with her cousins having all the fun she was in the kitchen doing the dirty dishes cleaning up you know what we're doing now cleaning up and i'm judging myself according to this message and you know what i found myself to be bribed that's right ain't nobody going to judge me ain't no devil in hell telling me i ain't going to make it i got this message that says has it's got my name in it that book i've read my name the authority of this message and the word i am bride i'm not called church anymore i'm not going through tribulation but i'm sure going through some persecution now i'm sure going through some judgment now but that final tribulation will fall when them jews do and i'm going to get on that this afternoon and show you exactly where you're at and so you wonder why why is this happening to me people say well i thought that i read it i thought what's it covered what's the deal with all this stuff people in the message diana copeland it's just judgment but it's not judging them to say you're good or bad what judges you is the message covert don't judge me you mean if i die i've had diabetes in my body 51 years i you know what they told me i wouldn't live 25. type 1

that angel come that's already happened amen so judgment is here people tribulation is going to come after the judgment how can you put a man to death if you don't judge him first everybody agree with that we are in the judgment time right now that's why the sparks are flying now but i got the holy ghost i put on the whole armor of god devil ain't going to get me oh he wanted to he wanted to but you know what jesus said peter the devil wanted to sift you boy and i prayed for you and i prayed for all them that are mine jesus prayed for you brother thank you ain't no devil hell going to get

hands thank you all for being here today thank you sister carnes and your daughter-in-law for coming we appreciate you always welcome uh you're just part of us and and good to see all of you here and

love you too amen the only person we want to be uncomfortable is who the devil we want the devil to be uncomfortable amen so that's our job is to defeat the devil so let's bow our heads to heavenly father we pray lord today that as our brother was speaking we were thinking lord back to when we first come to the lord and a lot of these things were maybe foreign in our mind and we were just a young christian and we had heard it maybe many times before at younger age but lord when the new birth comes it it it just paints a picture that that man cannot paint it puts things together and as the prophet said it may be the cow and the top of the tree eating grass but all of a sudden the picture becomes clear and we have the cow eating the grass on the ground and we see the picture lord it gets more clear as we go further through the message of the hour and we thank you for that lord i hope we all in this building and we all started as young christians and some are young christians now that maybe not understood everything that was going on but you said you would lead and guide us into all truth yes so i believe we heard the truth today lord so i pray lord that if it be anyone that has a question that lord in the stillness of the night or the next time someone preaches or we've heard many times before someone say something about a sermon that was preached three months ago that they got something out of so lord that's the way you work you're almighty god and you know what we need we're your children but you did require us to grow up and be adults and quit screaming daddy daddy but lord take this message and take it to a dying world and go up that statue of a perfect man together lord as the bride of jesus christ in the end time thank you for this day that you give us lord as we go and eat a natural meal and come back at two o'clock we pray that you would just be with each one of us lord and help us lead us and guide us into all truth be with sister chichi again and brother royal that we'll hear a good report father that's that's coming from there in the philippines we know they're having a horrible time there lord i pray lord that you'll sanctify us though for our journey and cleanse us from all unrighteousness when we ask these things in the name of jesus christ amen you're dismissed god bless you be back at 2 o'clock
