========================================

take a look at this alright Romans 8 verse 1 there's therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit the law can undo and that was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh ever seen for they that are after the flesh behind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit because the carnal mind is enmity against God for he does not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be but you're not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his as insane but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead also shall quicken your mortal bodies by his Spirit if you live after anybody shall die but if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall leave time as invalid or you have not received a spirit of bondage again to fear but you never speak received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father and the children then heirs heirs of God and joint-heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may be also glorified together for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God because the creature itself also shall be displayed bundage of corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of God and not only they but ourselves awesome which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body that is changes but if we hope for that we see not then do we with patience wait [Music] and either search at the hearts knows the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn what shall we say to these things who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect is God that justifies [Music] who shall separate us from the love of Christ such tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword may be and all these things we are more than this morning I'm just going to continue on this topic over so really what I'm what I'm kind of going through is this Romans chapter 8 because if you read that that's gonna that's a pretty deep little chapter yeah it's very meaty and I just have a lot of good things and and and one of the the main theme of it is how the whole create creation is growing we are growing and there's a birth that's taken place that the word is being born in us and it's producing a change to the world and this everything is being transformed and that's why you have all the growing and everything so last time we kind of looked at UM at how when you were born again the Spirit of God within you begins to recognize you begin to recognize who your father is and you know where you came from and and you begin as so as you begin to eat the word and recognize who he you're looking at him you get your sustenance from him from El Shaddai the the breasted one as brother talked about and you begin to you cried out to the Father to the to God and and so you can see in this Romans chapter eight this process that every believer goes through to growing and striving to get to this place where the the life of God has no impediment in us that we are allowing God to work through our members and that so that God can see can look at us and see himself made manifest the manifested sons of God whether it's our God is is there's somebody that's allowing God to have preeminence in their life and then keep on going on up until one day there's gonna leave that time you know I try not just put things off in the future anymore because I believe that now is the time where the bride is beginning to realize who she is and having an understanding of what the rapture is to wit the redemption of our body to win what has taken place how God has done it and an understanding that that there's nothing that's preventing you from going in the rapture and that takes a supernatural understanding a supernatural revelation to see how God has brought you through all these different very very maybe simple processes a simple process of justification sanctification bap technologists for your soul and then a cleansing of your spirit through the same process and then a cleansing or redemption of your body to get your body into a state and all those three very simple kind of little processes justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost and one if you look at a lot of these Old Testament types you can see you can run it right from Genesis to Revelation all these different types to give us a better understanding and one of those is the story of Abraham how in Genesis chapter 15 god calls me he's he's if you want to call it like birthed out of out of the kind of the the way that his family was serving idols and and believed in lots of different gods and all that sort of thing and God called and said let's go this different direction now read on further down in Genesis chapter 15 and it talks about how that that God put him to sleep and and through that process of sanctification a type of sanctification in the Old Testament now how Abraham went through all those different steps he put that he put him to sleep and he saw the burning lamp going between the sacrifices and all those different things and keep on going until and genesis 17 he God he says walk before me and be perfect a type of the baptism of Holy Ghost and then in Genesis 18 the Son of Man appears God in flesh and gives him a promise that he's going to have a son so in Genesis 18 verse 9 this is the the story kind of that brother Brennan always talked about that that identify the son of man because we know that the this man was identified in brother brandy ministry is as he was stand before people and and kind of you know he would say that just like this man was able to identify Sarah in the tent behind him brother Brandon would stand there before the people and turn his back on the communication and call out things in the audience without even really being looking at things and so the son of man was identified just the same way as it was when the son of man was there with Abraham and so in Elissa just read this little scripture and they said a name whereas Sarah thy wife and he said behold in the tent and he said I will certainly return to the according to the town of a life and love Sarah thy wife shall have a son and Sarah heard again which was behind and I'm leaving off a lot of the different story about how Sarah left and so forth but I want to kind of bring out that that point of this going in a point of a lot of the other stories in the Old Testament is that Abraham was going to have a child Abraham is the birth of this child that's the main focus and so when you read in the Old Testament of how Abraham went through this process he started off you know just a real simple change in his life he took a little turn and before long this child was born and that's that's what's taking place now you know you hear a lot of times in around the message and different ones that wondering if if something's really taking place because it sometimes looks like there's not there's not too much going on hey you know you could almost say just kind of like a win-win to all the different people will look up there on the hill as Jesus was crucified well that's there's nothing too much going on it's just it's just a man a preacher and two thieves being killed but yet one of the greatest stories that had ever been told was unfolding right there so I think it's some of these things can seem very simple but yet something so great is is really unfolding that God is manifesting himself and his people so that's what I mean by the the main thing is the birth of this child another story is the story of Ruth where you read this whole the story of Ruth and and you go through all the different things about how she she came to Boaz and she made him in the field and and all the different planning of the harvest and all the different things that led up to the culmination of the very end of this whole story that she's gonna have this child the birth of his child you know now again just to remind what am I talking about when when the world is boarding you you begin to cry Abba Father good up here now all these bursaries are birthing you so it's giving birth to the learner to this child but then when you come up to the very in here there had to be something happen to get us to birth the word to get us out of here to take us from this world this cosmos that we're in with all of our carnal ideas everything to kind of jump us up into eternity so that so that our body would be changed something special had to happen and what that special thing was was that God sent a prophet that's why he came to the end of the age to keep us out of this world to preach a message the shout to get us to understanding that our bodies could be changed and that is the birth of the word that's why in that story of Abraham Abraham the body was changed just kind of a pre figure what's gonna happen for us and we have to see that word be born in us and then our bodies will be changed so that we can look upon heal will see him as he is cuz will be like him does the word is being born in us and so let's let's just look at this Ruth child because it talks about that the whole story of Ruth is leading up to this little culmination thing that's why she had to have a kinsman redeemer not just because it would be a grand idea so she'd get the land back but she had to have a kinsman redeemer so she could have this child so that her dead husband's name could be carried on my long oh I have you pronounced that I'm maybe not too good to pronounce the names but so Ruth chapter 4 verse 13 through 17 says so boaz took ruth as she was his wife and when he went in unto her the Lord gave her conception and she bare a son and the woman said unto me only blessed be the Lord which have not left thee this day without a kinsman that his name may be famous in Israel because without now thinking about us without a kinsman without a way to take you back from to where that Adam had fallen from just like a little egg Naomi's husband had had left his inheritance you had to have a way to get you back to your heritage so the kinsman the reason you have a kinsman is to restore to you the what was followed to bring forth and really but that's what was hidden in the back part of God mind was that his eternal purpose to manifest himself in children to bring four children and make himself manifest in them and and so that's why that's really you know think about that how how really deep that is why you really needed at kinsman we needed a kinsman to be saved but the ultimate goal of salvation is for God to make men himself manifest and his people and he shall be under the a restorer of thy life and a nurture of that old age for that daughter and all which loveth e which is better to these than seven sons hath morning better than these and seven sons now here you know in the Old Testament you've got all these are these messengers Eleazar to Rebecca the the chief Reaper and the story of Ruth and and you know even in the New Testament you got all these ones these messengers that came upon the scene to prepare a bride for Christ now which is more important now this is this was a little bit controversial I imagine but you know as these messenger came on the scene what they're trying to do is produce a bride produce a bride that looks just like another masterpiece that looks just like the original man pass in which is Jesus Christ and so this bride is better and don't triple up on the work better let's see all these seven churches messengers they're trying to produce their aim was not just to have a messenger kind of set over to the side and say well there's the messenger that's the goal is the bride right so the bride is better to these than seven sons the bride is the focus and a lot of times we we get so tripped up over where we another day in the days of John Wesley I'm sure so many looked at him and said well that's the focus is I believe that God sent a man to the south but they may be so many of them lost sight of the the purpose of his message was for the people to grab a whole tooth and believe it and each one of these messengers came on the scene then we're preparing a bride to get ready and that's what the focus is yeah and now I know I think you know after the shower and out then in that kind of the the sequence of what the rapture is a shout the voice of the Archangel and that's that's kind of where I'm going is that something in that in that period of the voice when the the voice of the Archangel all wrapped up in that is a birth pain that's pushing forth something's happening something's happening to the bride the bride is catching a hold of who she is and what's taking place and so they and they only took the child and later there's a better bosom and became nursing unto it Emily Emily no kind of the type of how that works is that as the word the birth of the word comes forth the bride is gonna hand it over to 144,000 hand over the word the same word that we've heard and Naomi that you know the old Israel is gonna the one that was before the ogre is gonna take it and run with it so to speak yeah and the women her neighbors gave it a name saying there is a son born to Naomi and they called his name OB he is the father of Jesse the father of David so open it really if you want to put it like this that's that's the purpose of this whole book of Ruth is getting this son produced which I'm typing it as the word does that make sense to everybody and so let's get back to where we were even Roma's eight eight fifteen because this is what this whole this whole little lesson is about birth pains bringing the word for Romans 8:15 says for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you never received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry Abba Father the spirit of adoption that's growing within you and to produce a child of God that is not a child anymore but grow up into material not a little baby running around not knowing what's going on so that's what that's what that this is a spirit of adoption producing in you an adopted son of God if you let it now there's the key in your letter if we let it as I put myself in there to you of course absolutely we're all struggling and groaning and striving to allow going to have it so let's kind of break this down and you have received the spirit of adoption but why we whereby we cry Abba Father so there's there's something within you crying after you get the nerve new birth when the new birth is born in you is the spirit crying in you and and it's crying out first of all he's crying and it's crying out Abba Father because it recognizes the word it recognizes itself and Abba is a personal a personal reference to who God is it's not just kind of something that you've learned by giving a good thing a logical understanding but it's a personal revelation revelation to you who God is like like we're never Billy Paul talking about here is Danny crying in prayer and and he was calling out Papa God because God was not just something that he read about but he was a personal actual an actual person that he was fellowshiping with yeah and so when you're born you the first thing that kind of illustrating the last time is that when you when you're born again and in modern society in and the movies and whatnot we we get the idea that the daddy ain't nowhere to be found you know that Dave's pacing outside or whatever and all this is going on with the birth inside and and they don't really want nothing to do with that but in the gospel I believe it's imminent because when you're born again you come out looking at thank God you come out seeing who he is and we're not born an ed brother Wade was bringing out the last Sunday afternoon you're not born from some creed and Dom or whatever you got born from a woman I mean think about how that that would just be a messed up picture but you're born from the word you're born from the father you're born from God and you come out looking at God and so this is this is at the bottom you come out looking at God down here well what about here yeah cuz this is supposed to produce God in flesh the son of man back again in his people in his church so it's see how at the bottom it's it kind of mirrors what happens at the top of the pyramid at the at crying our Father mirrors what happens to with the undertook to with the adoption it's it it's the same process that's what's so confusing it goes up to the to the wives of the world is that it is the simplicity of the gospel see how simple it really is I love it brother I'm said on identification he said and now God expresses himself himself through his son Christ Jesus as he takes us in as adopted children and put his spirit in us cry Abba Father or in other words my God my God and things that are to be he said we have become for moral beings from time beings to eternal beings when the Word of God let our souls and we become sons and daughters of God with the attributes the gene of God in us to be sons and daughters of the father God in heaven crying Abba Father my God my god in my father's house and so what Roman's we already we just read that as we kind of go through the responsive reading how Romans 8 talks about going from carnal to spiritual from being birthed and Romans 8:5 8 says that the righteousness of the law might be filled fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace because the carnal mind is enmity against God for and is not subject to the law of God neither indeed can be so then they that are in the flesh cannot please God but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the Spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the Spirit of Christ he is none of his and you know it that's why it's so important to have a new birth the new birth is the most important thing that you can have because without that you don't have the teacher inside of you to recognize the word identify yourself with the word and to open the word to you that's why so many and there Carl ideas they argue about the word yeah that's why I'm convinced that you cannot reason somebody into the message or reason somebody into seeing the correct way of the Bible and that's why man cannot really interpret the Word of God it takes a revelation of this of the Spirit to reveal it to someone yeah it's not something that you debate and argue somebody into but if if we just open ourselves up over the doors of our heart to receive a revelation of God then he'll he's able to teach us and that caused us to understand but on the other hand you must you must read you must study for yourself you must go to church and make yourself available and that's you know all those different kind of things it is very difficult to really Express and let's just keep going yeah well I'm against organized religion whether I'm said oh it doesn't exactly mean that when a man says that get away from him God watches over his word you know the Bible says just the way it should be see now it puts in such a way to deceive or to make the wise stumble the race so simpler that the reason they stumble or receive I keep reading and that birth is from beneath this earth is from the earth and it is guessed the Spirit of God the first birth to make us active here makes us mortal man because of the sin act of the guard and make man come into the world by a woman and a man that is born of a woman is a few days of a man that is born of Christ is eternal and he kind of keeps going on that line up the difference between man's wisdom and the inner revelation from God somebody could could stay in and out argue you but it won't be a revelation then when a man is born again from heaven he said then who is this milk is a day he becomes a spirit baby Christ and then this road will fleshes drop there's a natural body theophany a body not made with hands neither born of a woman that we come to not boy of a woman because you're not born of a woman you're born from from God that's what the new birth is you're born from a woman that can kind of get into that wife you know like like some ask what's the difference between the message and the denomination because if you're only from any denomination you're going to have a woman then you're over that book of Revelation it talks about that mother holes and all these all these little harlots that came out from that so you can't be born from that now you can't be born again if you're I believe that you could hear a little bit of snippet of work be born again into the sitting in a denomination but then you've got to come out of that denomination because you can't sit there among all of that but but see we see what the denomination is is as the word came forward that they started out in the first days Paul came out preaching and and everybody kind of cabbage down drew up drew all the lines and everything and said now we got it right here and when they form that that denomination drew the line around it then it died and something had another message had to come out to get people out of that SOI arenas came along and he preached his message and out from that old denominational system that they had formed came out of another group and it just keep kept coming on coming on as they would form a little denomination they would say well now we got it we're gonna draw up what Irina's believed and draw up martin believed and just kept going on we got it all pinned down and then it would it would die and so when you when it dies because god keeps moving home his word keeps moving home through all the different pieces of the all the different stages of that wheat plant that corner week the tassel that shoved all the different stages and so we have to keep moving along with that it once it's denominated it can't bring forth life again fairway or form to the paragraph 80 says here we go forms of the word image to be a particular the word feed on what about being predestinated assess the beginning you see that little spark of life that you having you from the beginning when you started your journey many of you can remember it you join this church and join that church you try this and that nothing satisfied that's right but one day you just recognized it right and here in the mark of the beast' program started about how your heart as a room and the woman holds the seed and sees the gospel no matter how many of you may lose your shadow door no matter how great your pastor is and how much you read the Bible I'll never take live until the germ of life has come to it so no matter how much you know the Bible and how well it is in your heart you're still a sinner the heart is a womb and faith cometh by opening you that's not been sealed by theology faith cometh by hearing hearing and then he talks about it gets down to the bottom of the blood of Christ is applied in the blood comes a German life that goes into the seed and brings forth a newborn baby crying I have a father I have a father my God my God why did I ever do those things my God my God not from a denomination cuz he talks about how she can't paragraph 87 she can't bring forth nothing but dead children then if a denomination can only bring forth a hybrid child why do you want to belong to it for a now brother and that's the reason I'm against it she's a homework to begin with the Bible said she was a harlot that's plain words but I told you I was going to talk plain today that's what she is be she commits spiritual fornications by the dogma and Creed instead of the word teach your children to do the same thing now her children are come from the womb dead she's got to die that's exactly right just the same as every man analyst and just as sure as every moral person that breaks the womb of a woman will die so with so will every person that's borne by them will die because she's a hybrid illegitimate and her children are illegitimate that's correct I hope that don't go over your head now the reason I believe that one of the reasons why brother Graham put so much emphasis so I'm not on how on the denomination and what what's going on here is because now and we get closer to the end to this birth there's there comes a time where there's no denominational system involved at all they come straight from God straight down accomplish from God straight into a prophet and the people receive it and and it's a virgin bride that receives the word has nothing to do with the denomination right yeah some were come out from the nomination some were raised in the message of course even if you're raising the message you if you had your own line isn't everything that you had to come out of so we'll say even even the ones of us that were raised the message we came out of our own little denominational ideas as well but in the end of this birth this birth is coming forth there ain't no man involved with it I think nothing is straight born directly from God to produce the word in flesh again the son of man made manifest you know we were looking at son man and in Abraham's day and really you follow the pattern of the son of man revealing himself it three times and came to the Abraham our spiritual you know the father the faith and so forth and he was there where I'm talking about that and the message Jehovah Jireh and other messages about the son man God in flesh talking to Abraham I didn't find himself answering the tent behind it and then he came again to the natural seed of Abraham on the on the shores of Galilee God walking in a veil in human flesh of Jesus and then he comes and the son of man again in this day to the royal seed of Abraham producing himself back in flesh again so and I'm bouncing around a little bit I got a little bit off-topic there but I just kind of want to share that with you because all this kind of stuff it I wanted message together yeah I know it's a lot of information this morning right but everything just kind of the birth of the word is producing God in flesh me and the spoken word is the original seed brother REM said the true body there's gonna be one she's predestinated she won't be denominated because she's predestinated see she don't have to worry about some denomination she's already predicted to take the place look like Mary when Christ comes to his bride she will be a virgin like Mary was for God will not bring Christ through a womb on a I neither will he bring the bride he can't bring his word through a of his word there was horrible words but that's what the Bible says brother Brad was a pretty straight away so you say is it the bride he saying exactly what I've just covered there and the spoken word is the original seed again he says that when his bride comes she will be the same product that he is virgin the Christ belong to a denomination did you hope when him is his bride she is part of him she needs no table Douglas you won't have him she'll be absolutely virgin how by the word amen she'll punctuate every word God says man amen amen be done to me according to thy word oh my there you are punctuate god's word have a virgin woman what would she come out of a virgin one of the word what did Jesus come out of a virgin woman and just like this little picture of Mary coming to bring the could come into Jerusalem of Bethlehem to be able to deliver this baby see we have all these stories in the Old Testament of these women that were speaking Rebecca spoke to Eleazar all these women that were make it hannah confessing to Lila and making their confession and bringing forth a child and all these speak of what we are doing in this day be it unto me important bringing forth a child the babies born from a virgin womb and that's what's happening in this day as you cry I have a father making a confession that you believe the word and you just keep speaking and the word used they'll work I believe the bride around the world is speaking our self into a body change as the ministers that Paul said the ministry or the steward ships of the mysteries of the stewards of the mysteries of God and all around the world the bride The ministers have taken on the taken what brandon has preached and a preaching the gospel like this showing people these these types and things that brother Branham spoke about but couldn't quite didn't have maybe time to get into all the different things of what was taking place and and you know really it was hidden because it s anyway priest of seven seals these feasts made comments about how the people didn't get it and it was the people will begin to get it right about the time they come into the Lord so I believe now is the time for us to see who we are in the hour that we're living in then the word is being born not in just a baby form but now it's become to the come to maturity when maturity of the gospel the bride is coming to a place where she is it has allowed the word to to have complete preeminence in her life and and you know summer at different stages and so forth we know that but what's happening is that the the word is being born God vindicated to be true he said in the seed is not able to shut sure is fulfilling this age when the seven seals are just proving the denomination's has just been carriers that's another one of the father's business to proof like Jesus said I must be about my father's business and that's fantastic I just want to point that out the father's business is to prove that the denominational system is just carriers they're carrying the word alone but in this last day there's gonna be a people that come out of that they're virgin born they're not they don't shackle down to this earth by Creed's and dogmas or anything but they've been loosed and they're gonna be so loosed from the things of this world that they take flight that's right when the father's business now is to show you that then the nominations is not he is there a man-made system that did not have the worker right you said well married of a great virgin that the cross he never called her mother he called her woman carrier not mother see true she was a carrier of the word but she was not the word he was the word oh yes notice also she does not identified in the resurrection with him he died and rose again because he was the word she was just a carrier she died and still in the grave that's right so she was just a carrier not as a mother not God she was just a carrier like the churches are that's right shows she was just a carrier not the word I know that's a little bit of confusing statement to me because you know that you start getting in your head well Mary was not saved or Mary was not part of the bride cuz you know keep going down and maybe was part of the upper room or only or whatever she was when she received the new birth she received the new birth and became part of the body of Christ but looking at it in tight though like this this up this wheat plant growing up the word the kernel of wheat was in her womb but she at that time well let me say this right she was not that corn of wheat the corn of wheat was all of the father at all everything all of that eternal God bottled up in that little baby that was gonna come forth from her you see and so just like in the in the New Testament there's that process of different ones that are care that they like the ones that just kind of come along that didn't could not quite see as the word was eaten down they couldn't quite see clearly everything about God and so in each one goes from one stage to another who to stop the the the tassel formed right here and I know this is a corn planet at which you know with the corn of wheat is really a corn wheat not corn of a year of kkona to eat but you know you can look at a corner corn grow it out in the field and learn a lot about a wheat plant - so let's not get hung up on that so but what he's trying to say is that the the corn of the week was that thought baby that's being born and so that you look at today the same process is happening again that in this age in this day that quart of wheat is being produced again yes the birth of the word again I'm about to run out of time y'all hang along with me just a few more minutes and we'll be done I know this is a little bit a little bit wavy and everything right before we get into the service so maybe just take some of these things that Mateo and and maybe go through the book of Romans 8 and think about some of the things that were saying and and so forth the seed isn't and not a aware the sugar burger and said she was the true seed she was beyond that she was the shuck that brought forth the grainy now the other two was carriers of life only as the natural seed marry now remember I said the other two now marry don't make her God if some people tries to make her she was not a God it was her she was only a carrier I see like the rest of them was but like faith in the word brilliantly worn to the real image P like as the corn matures the wheat comes forth or stopped and it comes forth alone when it comes forth a shuck but when you think that shut if you don't watch it'll look just exactly like the real weed but when that's opened up the real wheat is on the inside it's only a carrier again so you see Mary not through sex but through faith something exactly like it Mary was not that seed Mary was a carrier of the seed he was the genuine faith see because the Word of God is by faith and he give to Abraham and only faith can produce what God said he do faith in his word so you know what let's just go and stop brother and we'll just continue all next time
