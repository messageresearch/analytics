[5:42] that's right very very wonderful time
[5:46] me it's the greatest first time they've
[5:48] been on their faces tonight that's right
[5:50] that's right hold on please
[5:53] i say something if you don't agree with
[5:57] this statement and brother dale he's a
[6:00] pastor
[6:01] he's corrected my lead i don't want to
[6:06] i know we have to say the same thing
[6:08] right now
[6:09] there's only one word right so then
[6:13] it's it's very easy because a lot of
[6:16] people have
[6:18] get sidetracked and getting the wrong
[6:21] thing
[6:21] right have the wrong conception of them
[6:25] you know something that satan would give
[6:26] you right
[6:28] and when it's not god-given it's the
[6:31] devil
[6:31] right right this
[6:46] if i'm if i'm wrong i don't know it
[6:48] right you know so
[6:51] the only thing that's right is the word
[6:52] i know that right so now
[6:54] you just pray that the lord will help me
[6:56] and
[6:58] i don't have to try not to be too all
[7:00] along
[7:01] but i've been talking to the church at
[7:04] home
[7:05] for several services i guess on the tree
[7:08] of life
[7:11] so that's why even an adam in the garden
[7:14] of eden
[7:15] they fell from him right amen which is
[7:17] eternal life
[7:18] right amen we know by the way that's not
[7:21] hard
[7:22] to understand well you know what we fell
[7:24] from right right
[7:25] so then uh maybe i'll just continue on
[7:28] with
[7:28] the same thought but you just you just
[7:31] pray for me that i'll
[7:33] i can say something happy you know you
[7:36] know a lot of people
[7:37] they'll say you know i know brother
[7:39] dale's been talking about
[7:41] teaching lately on the you know
[7:45] showing the right and wrong between
[7:46] hershey's also it must be herself
[7:49] that's right you got to be here you know
[7:52] that
[7:53] is approved you know that's right
[7:56] right but people
[8:00] really i told church the other day
[8:03] uh i think it's past sunday that people
[8:06] don't
[8:07] they want brother brown they say the
[8:09] third pool is never he was
[8:13] [Music]
[8:17] what those seven thunders were yeah
[8:19] whatever you know the third pull
[8:21] and i said they don't they don't believe
[8:23] him now they won't believe
[8:24] then that's right you know i doubt i
[8:27] really just me personally i doubt he'd
[8:29] be preaching to him oh
[8:31] lord that's right he can
[8:34] god can do anything because one thing
[8:36] god can't do
[8:38] he can't leave his word so you know
[8:42] if brother bram comes back he should be
[8:43] a 30 40 day period there
[8:45] that's right you know god can do
[8:46] anything yeah
[8:48] he can jesus he called him 40 days i see
[8:51] but now to me i my understanding that we
[8:54] have to have faith to get him back here
[8:58] i believe that that's god that's gonna
[9:00] be something
[9:01] that's a revelation and i'll try to
[9:04] maybe get to you
[9:06] there's things that the lord's revealed
[9:07] to me and i got some books y'all recent
[9:09] quotes out of
[9:11] and what i believe it takes
[9:14] to get him back right i'm always right
[9:16] because
[9:17] i don't believe martin luther's faith
[9:19] will get to the registration
[9:29] he's the one that was ordained of god to
[9:32] bring the message to finish the mystery
[9:34] of god right
[9:35] right now he says right in the scripture
[9:37] and it says the voice of the seventh
[9:38] angel
[9:39] that's right you begin to sound the
[9:40] mystery of god shall be finished
[9:42] he's declaring the prophet so he's the
[9:44] one
[9:45] he brought the message that finishes it
[9:48] amen
[9:51] so if the
[9:54] if the third tool can't be understood
[9:58] it's not revealed you know
[10:02] they
[10:08] there's no rapture there's no way you're
[10:10] getting the science back here right
[10:12] right
[10:13] yeah but i believe according that
[10:15] brother branham
[10:17] uh the third pool
[10:20] was over on seven seals
[10:25] he went in the deepest rims of god that
[10:27] he ever he said he ever worked
[10:28] exactly so now
[10:33] but that wasn't you know he said
[10:36] this will be the third pool remember
[10:38] that vision he had
[10:39] yeah yep he says he said it's not gonna
[10:42] be like they
[10:43] they have it right a public show if it's
[10:46] the third pole
[10:48] you see and and uh if it's the third
[10:52] pool
[10:52] it's the older the seven seals come on
[10:54] right that's what he said
[10:56] exactly so the seven seals brings
[10:59] rapture and faith
[11:00] all right that's right right now now i'm
[11:03] going to get started on my notes you
[11:04] know i'm going to talk it'll take all my
[11:05] time
[11:05] i don't want to do that so now you just
[11:08] pray that i can say something right
[11:09] that'll
[11:10] help you you know sort
[11:13] so uh i want to read
[11:17] another scripture you got your bible
[11:19] read with me
[11:21] in the first peter first chapter
[11:28] clock don't slow down so i don't have to
[11:30] speed up

[12:51] all things exactly
[12:55] he's already coming to john the baptist

[13:06] right right bring back
[13:09] right you know your original place

[13:16] let me go let me read a book uh
[13:20] real quick i want to read something
[13:22] you're out of easter cia preaching 65
[13:24] unfinished i believe it was
[13:25] yeah it fits april 3rd 1965.
[13:29] and
[13:33] from page 16.

[13:41] place in this hour
[13:44] he that heareth my that's word

[13:50] on him that certainly
[13:52] had that's presented eternal life
[13:55] right man she'll not come into the
[13:58] judgment
[13:59] but it's passed from death
[14:09] this eternal life dwells in you
[14:13] it is the potential or the earnest
[14:16] of you being quickened from moral
[14:18] immortality right amen
[14:20] right well let's say nobody has to come
[14:22] back and speak your eternal bond again
[14:26] it's going to take place from inside you
[14:27] right amen glory let me say that again
[14:31] that's the brother talking he said let
[14:32] me say that again
[14:34] when this spirit has found you
[14:38] he sent you the individual has come upon
[14:41] you
[14:42] it is the potential of your eternal
[14:45] inheritance
[14:46] amen that god
[14:49] thought of you and made you
[14:52] before the foundation of the world
[14:54] that's your potential
[14:56] so that's that is what your redeemer
[14:59] restored back to right
[15:01] amen all right all right what then
[15:04] he has thought of you was what you said
[15:07] there tonight and me standing here
[15:09] right yeah
[15:14] all right now look the thought of god
[15:17] is what is the artist the holy spirit
[15:20] immortal to immortality now that's
[15:23] that's your predestination
[15:24] right right that's where it is now
[15:28] all right let me get started so again
[15:31] now
[15:34] in revelations 5 the book adam lost
[15:38] all right all right i wasn't john
[15:40] weeping
[15:41] you know all right the i think
[15:45] and nobody was worthy to take nobody
[15:47] opened the book that's right
[15:48] so according to brother branham i really
[15:51] hear a man admit
[15:52] he said you're you're the book is sealed
[15:55] and you're sealed with the book exactly
[15:57] right all right
[16:00] okay now the tree adam failed eprom
[16:03] right
[16:04] exactly which is god's word right now
[16:07] look
[16:07] glory see this is the great mystery
[16:11] god unfolds down here to
[16:14] individually any individual now right
[16:16] the that's only two though
[16:18] the predestination amen right here now
[16:21] look
[16:22] never to a group just to one person
[16:26] god told brother ram remember that he
[16:28] said i'll meet you in there
[16:30] midnight vision that's it a little room
[16:34] this will be the third pool yeah okay
[16:37] columbia public show so then so god
[16:41] to me you may not may not agree this
[16:43] this is my understanding of it
[16:45] but brother bro when the sabbath season
[16:47] can open to brother brown
[16:50] he said he spoke of the vision he had
[16:53] he said six years first he said no he
[16:55] was seven years
[16:56] yeah right well 56 to 73
[17:00] right was seven years right he was a
[17:02] television
[17:04] interval a lot of people talking about
[17:06] right he's i'll meet you in there and
[17:08] this is the third door
[17:09] all right amen so in slovenia canyon he
[17:13] said
[17:13] when the source struck his hand he just
[17:16] struck inside and said
[17:17] this is the third pool amen i'm all
[17:19] right right
[17:21] and no one wants the end time he said
[17:23] the third pull
[17:24] was the opening of those seven seals
[17:27] see all right showing all down to the
[17:30] ages that's right
[17:32] the word they had missed so here's still
[17:34] a man
[17:36] a redeemed son of god right see
[17:39] that had been redeemed with the full
[17:42] word of god to finish the mystery
[17:44] god had in his word amen that every
[17:47] believer down through the bible
[17:49] right typed and spoke about right here
[17:52] he stood
[17:53] to bring forth that mystery to the
[17:55] people right
[17:56] i'm a very glorious day
[18:02] so he said it's a secret now let me ask
[18:05] you something
[18:07] when brother brandon preached those
[18:09] seven seals
[18:12] who knew it besides him
[18:16] who did no that's right i want a soul on
[18:19] the face
[18:20] not a soul right he was a secret
[18:24] that's right amen not only to him he was
[18:28] the opening of the word to him
[18:29] amen glory all right but he said you
[18:32] didn't get any questions
[18:34] you didn't get it you weren't supposed
[18:36] to exactly see
[18:38] you had to be a certain place right here
[18:39] he was right here
[18:41] i hear the holy spirit right am i right
[18:43] or not amen
[18:45] he preached all the word in the former
[18:47] in a former ring
[18:48] from the serpent in the garden to the
[18:49] nations of wolverine right right
[18:52] right so there he stood and then
[18:55] something happened so now look right let
[18:57] me go on here real quick
[19:00] see there in revelations 5 is the most
[19:02] sublime thing in the scripture
[19:04] so there he stood
[19:07] our stood the lamb
[19:10] revealing the mystery amen

[19:16] quick i think i'll need to eat out of
[19:17] silver
[19:19] before i go on this thing okay hold on
[19:21] just be patient with it
[19:22] this is page 79 78 he quotes a scripture
[19:26] he'll read it
[19:27] in ephesians 4 30. he hold that word
[19:30] redemption
[19:32] until the day that the book of
[19:33] redemption has been revealed
[19:36] and the redeemer comes to claim his
[19:38] possession
[19:40] now they can do it don't grieve it fail

[23:57] right
[23:58] see although it's the deeper you go in

[24:03] that's why peter said being born again
[24:05] he's teaching says you're a perfect man
[24:06] right by the word of god
[24:10] the deeper you go the deeper the birth
[24:14] pains off
[24:15] right you believe that exactly right
[24:18] oh my god why the more you realize where
[24:22] you fell from
[24:23] let me hear an old man 73 year old right
[24:26] yeah
[24:27] well see now a lot of 73 year old man in
[24:30] the world don't know one thing about
[24:32] god right here but why am i troubled
[24:36] right new life from another world
[24:39] i've been born from above so there's
[24:41] gotta be a pool from here
[24:43] up there there's another report
[24:48] your mother's out there did you have any
[24:49] pain when you had your children
[24:51] yeah that's just hot now you stick a
[24:55] needle in your spine you can't
[24:56] feel anything yeah you know yeah
[24:59] that's right right that's how the church
[25:01] is doing
[25:02] right right give him a shot exactly
[25:05] you're okay you're gonna be all right
[25:06] we're gonna let you know
[25:09] we're going the wrong way yeah that's
[25:11] true that's right
[25:13] you know that's true but see jesus
[25:16] coming into his ministry according to
[25:17] brother brown page 130 i believe in the
[25:19] seal book
[25:19] he said he said now my soul troubled
[25:22] right you mean you're coming down the
[25:24] end of a ministry you've got trouble
[25:26] what makes something you think some
[25:28] spiritual thing happens you have trouble
[25:29] with you
[25:30] right i'm not afraid to die but i don't
[25:33] want to die i'll be honest with you
[25:35] that's right you might hear what to die
[25:37] i want to die to myself
[25:41] but i want to see this thing consummated
[25:43] right glory
[25:44] but gary constimation in me don't you
[25:48] right right that's exactly what it is
[25:51] right amen this words this word come for
[25:54] someone
[25:55] this we should believe it come for us
[25:58] but listen
[25:59] you've got to live it more than you love
[26:00] anything that's right
[26:03] you're going to want it more than you
[26:05] want anything else man if it's not that
[26:07] way
[26:08] you know when you ain't you ain't right
[26:09] you need to move up yeah
[26:11] all right all right so the deeper the
[26:14] pain
[26:14] see the more the cleaner the message get
[26:18] the more you realize from the place you
[26:21] fell from that's right
[26:36] grow up but see the closer you get to
[26:39] god
[26:41] think the more pain you have right
[26:43] because the planet it gets
[26:45] the place you fail from right right
[26:49] so then you start seeking searching
[26:52] for that position that place you fell
[26:55] from
[26:57] all right you're not satisfied just to
[26:59] hear the message
[27:02] you've got to be the message hallelujah
[27:17] preaching it ain't it that's part of it
[27:20] it's not all right
[27:24] you live a good life and that ain't it
[27:27] put a good last part on it

[27:44] that's what i'm saying do we really want
[27:47] to see this thing
[27:48] come to a climax
[27:52] really ask yourself because you live a
[27:54] hundred more years you know where you
[27:55] are now
[27:59] that's right because see we was playing
