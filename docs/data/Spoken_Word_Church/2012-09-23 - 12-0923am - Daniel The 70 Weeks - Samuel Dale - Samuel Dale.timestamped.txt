[3:53] we're trying to do so you know you just
[3:56] bear with us as we state things that
[3:58] maybe it will be a contrary to your
[4:00] thoughts maybe or even never heard the
[4:04] statements before right but we'll do the
[4:06] best we can to do that let's pray and
[4:09] ask the Lord to bless us remember all of
[4:12] the sick ones and different ones

[4:48] you may be seated now if anybody didn't
[4:51] get a copy of the notes we're trying to
[4:53] make 60 of them but uh
[4:56] not being uh right you know read
[5:00] with somebody next to you and uh that
[5:04] way maybe a husband and wipe my
[5:05] checkbooks together if you're reading
[5:06] the same notes we were our occasion
[5:09] probably but uh but as I said now we're
[5:14] trying we're going to try to to the new
[5:16] ones that haven't seen and heard the
[5:18] things
[5:19] um
[5:20] we're going to try to cover the Plan of
[5:23] Redemption for the Bride of Jesus Christ
[5:28] in her journey and and then we're going
[5:31] to do that by covering uh the Journey of
[5:35] redemption for Israel all right so then
[5:38] if we can see that and it ties together
[5:40] then we have a beautiful picture so we
[5:43] can follow it throughout the word of God
[5:45] so go ahead brother uh Anderson now if I
[5:48] say Joe and Anderson have who flips to
[5:49] which one I don't know but uh we've got
[5:53] this set up the best we could yesterday
[5:55] to try to help you to understand
[5:59] all right so look at the uh
[6:02] thing and we'll read Daniel 9 24.
[6:06] through 27.
[6:10] all right 70 weeks are determined upon
[6:13] thy people and upon thy Holy City to
[6:15] finish the transgression to make an end
[6:17] of sins and make reconciliation for
[6:19] iniquity and bring in Everlasting
[6:21] righteousness and the self-division in
[6:23] Prophecy and anoint the most holy now if
[6:25] we finish we get to the part you'll see
[6:28] that that covers the Plan of Redemption
[6:29] for Israel and also as Wade will be
[6:32] covering this afternoon of the holy city
[6:36] the uh you know and and it will be not
[6:39] till this that it'll be a three-point
[6:40] Plan of Redemption to see the bride
[6:42] Israel and even the city because you
[6:46] know of what will happen in the
[6:47] Millennium huh verse 25 no therefore and
[6:51] understand that from the going forth to
[6:52] the Commandment to restore and to build
[6:54] Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince
[6:57] shall be seven weeks now watch that keep
[6:59] that in mind we'll keep pointing to it
[7:01] three score and two weeks which would be
[7:04] 69 all right now mathematically all
[7:08] right and the street shall be built
[7:09] again in the wall even in trouble this
[7:11] time and after three score in two weeks
[7:13] shall Messiah be cut off but not for
[7:16] himself and the people of the prince
[7:18] that shall come shall destroy the city
[7:20] and the sanctuary and the end there I
[7:22] shall be with the flood and unto the end
[7:24] of the war desolation is determined and
[7:27] he shall confirm the Covenant with many
[7:29] for one week and in the midst of the
[7:31] week he shall cause the sacrifice and
[7:33] oblation to cease and for the
[7:36] overspreading of abomination he shall
[7:37] make it desolate even unto the
[7:39] consummation and that determines shall
[7:42] be poured up on the desolate that's
[7:43] right so you see then you you've got
[7:46] verse 26 that you've got 62 three score
[7:49] and two weeks 62 to the coming up to
[7:53] Jesus Christ and him being cut off amen
[7:55] all right now verse 27 is basically
[7:59] aligned with the Antichrist that's right
[8:02] because it comes to the end time and he
[8:04] shall come from the Covenant with many
[8:07] for a week all right God never made a
[8:09] covenant with anybody for a week that's
[8:11] right he makes a covenant for returning
[8:13] to amen Satan copies because he knows
[8:16] what's left for Israel will have to do
[8:19] with it but then he it will come in in
[8:22] the Desolation and the different things
[8:23] man will take place all right
[8:26] now let's get started and read Fast and
[8:29] Furious and see all right
[8:32] now I want you to remember one thing
[8:37] brother Brown and we believe was the
[8:39] prophet we don't believe he was God we
[8:42] have never believed nothing like that
[8:43] right he was the prophet just like Paul
[8:45] was a prophet amen uh brother random
[8:48] calls
[8:49] um Paul Iranians or Colombo Martin
[8:52] Luther Wesley
[8:54] and even says the prophet came on today
[8:56] of Pentecost to Zeus's Street Pentecost
[8:58] with the baptism of the Holy Ghost so
[9:01] then he could cover a prophet and and
[9:03] have no problems but we believe that God
[9:06] finished this whole thing up by sending
[9:08] us Elijah the prophet Amen to bring us
[9:11] the fullness of the word and make ready
[9:14] for a Rapture all right now in believing
[9:17] that then we must believe
[9:20] that what he says is correct amen no
[9:25] matter what we argue about whether it
[9:27] fits or not right but remember he's the
[9:30] prophet amen we are not and anybody
[9:33] listen to this you me whoever we have no
[9:36] right whatsoever to try to correct the
[9:39] prophet right a prophet stands before
[9:42] God and God only amen he will answer to
[9:45] God that's why he said you say what I
[9:48] say right all right and I've done it for
[9:51] 40 something years I've been standing in
[9:54] the Pulpit preaching that long and
[9:57] showing that brother random was not
[9:59] contradictory amen like everybody thinks
[10:02] you know well he might demonstrate here
[10:04] he made a mistake here well you want to
[10:07] go up here and talk about 30 minutes and
[10:08] let me dispect your message and I'll
[10:11] tell you you have any mistakes you make
[10:13] because that's human in error part but
[10:16] now the message is Right amen the man
[10:20] himself even taught like why horse rider
[10:22] was a Holy Ghost
[10:23] but then he corrected that right because
[10:26] he was not infallible right right that's
[10:29] right but the message is invaluable
[10:31] because the message is the Bible amen
[10:33] that's right do you believe the Bible's
[10:35] infallible amen all right and I can show
[10:38] you a lot of things in there that looks
[10:40] like it's contrary right
[10:43] you remember when you read it yes you
[10:45] remember how you argued about the water
[10:47] baptism words in the name of the Lord
[10:49] Jesus Christ or father Son and Holy
[10:51] Ghost
[10:51] you know well you know it's in there
[10:54] George got to come together and make a
[10:55] picture if not you got a contradiction
[10:58] that's right a little Sonny Wade if we
[11:00] would deal with the prophets mentioned
[11:01] but if it fits together then it cannot
[11:04] be in any argument whatsoever as to what
[11:07] it is all right
[11:09] you might say well
[11:11] um why is it important
[11:14] that we understand the Daniel 70 weeks
[11:18] what is important
[11:20] well why is it important to understand
[11:22] anything
[11:26] I remember discussing this years ago
[11:28] with someone and they they said do you
[11:29] think water baptism is essential under
[11:31] salvation
[11:33] I've talked for a minute
[11:37] I said the truth is Right amen
[11:41] the truth is essential in Salvation well
[11:43] Jesus said You shall know the truth all
[11:46] right so then the truth is essential
[11:48] right so if it's in the word of God then
[11:50] it's essential amen what do we need to
[11:52] know these things to be saved
[11:56] well some people are saved by knowing
[11:59] you're in these things then but some
[12:02] people are known and say by hearing John
[12:04] 3 16 you want to take it out no no we
[12:08] want to leave all of it correct or that
[12:11] we can depend upon the Bible and then
[12:14] you come and show me I invite it to the
[12:16] world come and show me we're running
[12:18] around and missed it but now don't come
[12:20] and say he say it you bring it to me
[12:24] from the Bible and you bring me what he
[12:26] said amen all right and then we'll
[12:29] discuss it amen but you're going to have
[12:31] to listen to what I say right about the
[12:33] rest of it because I believe it'll all
[12:35] fit together
[12:36] or else he wasn't the problem right
[12:39] that's right amen and if he wasn't the
[12:41] prophet maybe you are the prophet that
[12:44] can straighten him out yeah
[12:51] thanks I am my wife don't like me to go
[12:54] like that into the camera but that just
[12:57] gets the point across you'll never
[12:58] forget that when I do that statement and
[13:01] make that point all right but now this
[13:05] do you say well why is it important
[13:08] to understand
[13:10] all right let's just read about it three
[13:12] or four other statements real fast and
[13:14] get it done
[13:15] do it with number one brother and you
[13:18] got your notes you can follow with us
[13:20] make these homes and now it may be hard
[13:23] for you to follow down the side of it
[13:25] over here with a little bitty one two
[13:26] three four but smaller the quote this on
[13:29] the screen
[13:30] all right I said anyone Vehicles
[13:32] instructions to Daniel
[13:35] Revelation 6 1 to 19 21 is connected
[13:38] with the 70 weeks therefore we must stop
[13:40] and explain before we go further we must
[13:43] stop and explain why these 70 in weeks
[13:45] because if you don't want you you miss
[13:48] there's no seals you miss the trumpets
[13:50] you miss the vowels
[13:53] those flags those three unclean spirits
[13:55] like frogs no stream woes and casting
[13:58] out of the red dragon the woman in the
[14:00] sun you'll miss it all if you don't and
[14:03] that code it takes place right here in
[14:06] this 70th week that's where it takes
[14:09] place all right now
[14:11] so it seemed like it must be important
[14:14] heaven
[14:15] thank you forgive me for putting a cough
[14:17] drop in okay I don't Advocate you
[14:20] putting a candy in the mouth but
[14:23] you know
[14:25] sometimes my voice goes and we gotta
[14:27] have that part all right don't forget me
[14:29] look at the next one
[14:31] this is paragraph 22 the sixth full
[14:33] purpose
[14:34] and I do not believe there's one person
[14:36] here for that purpose I believe that we
[14:39] are here tonight because we are deadly
[14:40] sincere honestly at wanting to know the
[14:44] saith the Lord amen number three
[14:50] that's the reason we're praying to God
[14:53] to make that so perfect that there will
[14:56] be no one chatter of doubt be not one
[14:59] shot of that finance a word you just put
[15:02] it any harm
[15:03] I'm 72. okay
[15:11] so God we're not supposed to put her on
[15:14] interpretation to to those things it's
[15:16] got to come through thus say of the Lord
[15:18] or I'm leaving it right there until I
[15:21] understand
[15:22] try all right all right now is this
[15:25] important with the next one
[15:30] paragraph 191 now the 70th week let me
[15:33] say something here to you and to the
[15:35] world I mean anybody listening
[15:38] I'm using the 2010 version
[15:41] of the message the 99 version will say
[15:45] the 70 weeks of Daniel
[15:48] just in case somebody you know looks up
[15:51] and says that's wrong the 99 and the 95s
[15:54] and all users and they'll say the 70 we
[15:56] can send you 70 weeks a day but then the
[16:00] new version uses the 70th week when it
[16:02] comes to that last part all right to
[16:05] remember that I got 191 and I wish you'd
[16:09] listen quietly now just for a moment the
[16:11] moment he starts the 70th week or seven
[16:13] years the church is gone now listen I'm
[16:16] quoting again re-quoting so you won't
[16:19] forget this is what the Holy Spirit put
[16:22] upon my pen while I was writing all
[16:25] right so is it true what the prophet
[16:27] would be saying in the dangle 70 weeks
[16:29] amen he said we we need to wait till we
[16:32] have to accept the Lord he said I won't
[16:34] speak until I do so he did all right yep
[16:37] that's right now he says this is what
[16:39] the Holy Spirit put on his pen to write
[16:40] the people of the message are real good
[16:42] to go over to spoken words original see
[16:44] we wrote around and said in the back
[16:46] said the holy spirit said take up your
[16:48] pen and write and they'll have that for
[16:50] thus saith the Lord but what about
[16:52] Daniel 70 weeks all right amen so now
[16:54] you tell me he was wrong
[16:56] because that's what we're going to get
[16:57] into in a minute we're going to see that
[16:59] people are going to say he's wrong here
[17:01] he's wrong here he's wrong there okay I
[17:04] want your Vindication all right
[17:06] that's all I'm asking for that's right I
[17:08] want your Vindication I don't want her
[17:10] stupidities right amen I want your
[17:13] Vindication right all right now see then
[17:16] all right what is it then
[17:18] is it important to know so let's cover
[17:22] the 70 weeks of Daniel
[17:25] all right you're going to find out it'll
[17:27] be 490 years
[17:29] because they're 70 weeks and we'll cover
[17:32] in a minute in a week in seven years and
[17:35] the prophet will prove it by the Bible
[17:36] as we go along so we just let him make
[17:39] the statements all right so we're going
[17:41] to have to see the Plan of Redemption
[17:43] amen all right so then we've already
[17:46] said and read in Daniel that they were
[17:49] seven years in building our 49 years
[17:52] seven weeks in building the Temple we'll
[17:55] get to that in a minute you know back
[17:57] there all right
[17:58] we've got that in here in case you're
[18:00] smart enough to figure out the Bible
[18:02] says 46. we got that in the second floor
[18:04] covered all right but then you got the
[18:07] 62 weeks right
[18:09] and then you got one week left Amen to
[18:12] make you 490
[18:14] years to Israel all right now watch the
[18:18] Oddity in a second on that in case I
[18:20] repeat it isn't it odd that Jesus said I
[18:24] mean they said how many times do we
[18:25] forgive
[18:27] what did Jesus say yeah
[18:29] he said we'll forgive him seven times he
[18:32] said no 70 times seven
[18:34] multiply that that's 490 in case you
[18:37] need it all right that's kind of an odd
[18:40] point isn't it but it's not too hard go
[18:42] ahead and listen
[18:43] let's start with number five
[18:47] all right
[18:49] these are basically all be interested in
[18:51] the week of Daniel so if I forget to do
[18:53] it I'll give you the purpose paragraph
[18:55] 49. now today we're approaching what is
[18:57] the 70 weeks
[18:59] this is about a part of the 70 weeks
[19:02] now we know the scripture cannot lie
[19:06] they have to be truth and if this Angel
[19:08] Gabriel come and told Daniel that there
[19:10] was only 70 weeks left to the Jews now
[19:12] if we apply that to six days or seven
[19:15] days see where would you be right
[19:17] if you're only going to cover it right
[19:19] 70 weeks you've learned it just weeks
[19:22] seven days in a week and 70 weeks you
[19:24] know you you have four to 90 days or
[19:27] something you'd calculate all but you
[19:28] ain't gonna do no good right but look
[19:30] what he said but in Prophecy it's always
[19:32] give in Parable amen all right giving
[19:37] Parables next
[19:40] Matthew 13 34 says
[19:45] and all these things Jesus take unto the
[19:48] multitude and parables and why without a
[19:51] parable spake he not unto them
[19:54] you remember all of the parables in the
[19:57] Bible
[19:58] and Jesus would the disciples would come
[20:00] and what is this parable
[20:02] you know the Pharisees finally one day
[20:04] figured out
[20:05] this guy is Parabola using Parables to
[20:09] kill us so that's why they killed him
[20:11] right because he was using Parables they
[20:13] figured it out there in a while get out
[20:15] the end of the reading right they said
[20:16] he's talking about us
[20:18] all right man without a parable expect
[20:19] you not now so remember Daniel 70 weeks
[20:22] I told Wade when years ago when he asked
[20:24] me what about the 70 weeks of Daniel and
[20:26] I said right over the top of every page
[20:28] of the book Parable Parable Parable
[20:30] Parable Parable Parable Parable that's
[20:32] right and I said when you finish the
[20:34] book you'll see it's a parable amen
[20:36] correct all right now what is a parable
[20:40] go ahead
[20:42] the Greek word for that is 38.50
[20:46] means a parable figure comparison
[20:48] proverb I'm placing a one thing by the
[20:51] side of another usual position of what
[20:53] that word is which means side by side to
[20:55] position anything as of ships in battle
[20:57] that's metaphor I guess you call it a
[21:00] comparing comparison of one thing with
[21:03] another
[21:04] likeness similitude an example by which
[21:08] a Doctrine or precept is Illustrated
[21:10] right so that's a parable you
[21:14] listen to a man
[21:17] that planted a seed or locking into this
[21:19] or locking them to that right
[21:21] see
[21:23] do we say it no
[21:25] we've good Baptists and all you know
[21:27] well we can understand it
[21:30] we understand because Jesus explained
[21:33] The Parables we read the next verses
[21:35] where explain it to the disciples
[21:37] you know that was still a parable sure
[21:39] until you're born again
[21:42] legal scripture no man can call Jesus a
[21:46] Christ except it be why what the Holy
[21:49] Ghost amen see though you can read and
[21:52] understand reading and understanding is
[21:54] not what it is it must be revealed
[21:58] you're gonna stop a drunk going down the
[22:00] highway and say Jesus say Jesus is a
[22:02] Christ you say Jesus Christ oh he's born
[22:03] again
[22:05] that's no more than someone that said
[22:06] water baptism under regeneration let's
[22:09] go to Lake Lanier we'll fill up the
[22:10] kingdom we'll just push them in in the
[22:12] name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen you
[22:14] see that silly no that's what I'm saying
[22:16] is how silly we are see we say we know
[22:19] we understand the parables
[22:21] but do we
[22:24] do we understand The Parables that's
[22:26] right not until we're born again that's
[22:29] right that's the key to the whole thing
[22:30] neither is it Daniel 70 weeks understood
[22:32] unless you're born again all right yes
[22:35] sir now so they're doing that now
[22:38] why would God put things in a parable
[22:42] anyway number eight
[22:46] why would he put in for our appreciate
[22:47] these brothers that will do these things
[22:49] in the videos and run them back and
[22:51] forth because this killed you a lot of
[22:52] times
[22:53] look what he said on this paragraph 71
[22:56] to 70 a week you come back to what's
[22:58] done and things are going on but that
[23:00] all was done in the great economy of God
[23:02] to keep the church watching and praying
[23:04] being ready how their garments washed in
[23:07] the blood of the Lamb amen
[23:09] it's done to keep you and I
[23:11] checking up all right amen the Bible
[23:13] says examine yourself to see whether
[23:15] you're in the faith or not all right we
[23:18] better examine ourselves every day
[23:19] especially now right that's right right
[23:21] so God does it
[23:33] number nine
[23:35] Deuteronomy 13 1-3
[23:39] we like that one word says if a prophet
[23:42] comes and gives you a sign that come to
[23:43] pass you got to believe him but people
[23:45] don't read this one
[23:46] Deuteronomy 13 1-3 if there arise among
[23:51] your Prophet or a dreamer of dreams and
[23:53] give it thee a sign or a wonder what
[23:56] and this sign our Wonder come to pass
[24:02] 40 people laying out in exist to prove
[24:05] I'm right and they're all going to raise
[24:06] the debt and they'll raise them to death
[24:09] now what are you gonna do
[24:13] what are you gonna do see I'm not asking
[24:16] are you going to believe the man
[24:18] now watch what he said
[24:22] where are these fake unto thee saying
[24:26] he's going to give you the signs and
[24:28] wonders will take place but then he's
[24:30] teaching you a Doctrine watch it yep bro
[24:33] he speak unto thee saying let us go
[24:36] after other gods which thou has not
[24:38] known and let us serve them now watch
[24:41] amen I shall not hearken unto the words
[24:44] of that Prophet or that dreamer of
[24:45] dreams for the Lord your God proveth you
[24:49] right to know whether you love the Lord
[24:51] your God with all your heart with all
[24:52] your soul
[24:53] he does it to prove it right yeah
[24:57] yeah all right what about a wonderful
[24:59] guy to do that
[25:01] you mean he would let signs and wonders
[25:03] take place sure he's doing it in the
[25:08] in those taking place to prove yep but
[25:12] it's to prove whether or not we love him
[25:13] because we love him we love his word
[25:15] amen right that's right and if we won't
[25:17] stay with his word
[25:20] then we fail the test
[25:22] simple amen
[25:24] not to scare nobody plain language right
[25:26] that's right it's true all right
[25:30] so now let's get on with it
[25:32] well there's one more just bypass 10. oh
[25:35] yeah
[25:36] this is time tested time tested
[25:39] Memorials of God prayer e47 every time
[25:42] the sickness strikes your home every
[25:44] time the trial strikes your home every
[25:46] time the neighbor say something bad
[25:48] about you it's only shaking you he's
[25:50] explaining the tree how it is shaking to
[25:53] the tree makes it grow into the ground
[25:54] and get deeper Roots right and only
[25:56] shaking you loosening you up as soon as
[25:58] you get down and get a better hold on
[26:00] the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable word
[26:03] that's how God does it he sends those
[26:05] trials to test you to prove you to shake
[26:09] you up and to give you a new hope it's
[26:12] good sometimes for somebody to differ
[26:13] with you
[26:18] then somebody comes along they say hey
[26:20] what happened what about this yeah
[26:24] yeah I'm gonna go read again all right
[26:26] right so it's good for us okay now go
[26:30] ahead and let's place it only
[26:31] the board
[26:33] the chart
[26:34] now
[26:36] this is the drawing wrote a random made
[26:38] and used and we have proof
[26:41] now canceled this one for one time right
[26:44] now
[26:45] all right we have proof that this is the
[26:49] official
[26:51] one that brought around drug
[26:53] I received mine and I have it in my
[26:56] Bible you know Weatherby but I received
[27:01] mine in 67 or 68 one the first time I
[27:04] guess we were close to the Tabernacle or
[27:06] something
[27:06] and uh
[27:08] may have even been 66 when I met brother
[27:10] Mo but anyhow
[27:11] we have proof from people and I don't
[27:15] call names anymore couldn't get out of
[27:17] there but if they say that was the
[27:20] drawing we use it this afternoon because
[27:22] they knew how the copies to where the
[27:24] brother sent it to them to prove that
[27:26] that was the very drawing brought around
[27:28] May
[27:29] all right now I contend this drawing and
[27:33] the Bible
[27:34] and the prophet's message are all the
[27:36] same amen yes sir and to go contrary to
[27:39] it yep we would be having to change what
[27:43] he's saying amen
[27:45] let me see we can't do it right we've
[27:47] got to stay with what he's saying amen
[27:48] even though as I said we would maybe not
[27:51] uh find some seats for some of these
[27:54] even though we would differ
[27:58] as to what we think man
[28:00] go ahead I didn't make my statement do
[28:03] what you want to amen
[28:05] we don't correct the prophet
[28:09] that's what they're doing in the end
[28:10] time now that's right that's right
[28:13] they're saying he was wrong here and he
[28:14] was wrong go ahead
[28:17] you just need your own hope amen all
[28:20] right no problem ain't mad at nobody I
[28:22] just think what I believe right yeah
[28:25] but look what he says now we read in
[28:28] Daniel
[28:30] they're seven weeks
[28:32] three score in two weeks all right
[28:35] that's 69. okay far end you'll see seven
[28:39] years or seven death week right
[28:42] all right
[28:44] you look at your drawing you have it
[28:46] you'll turn over in your nose you have a
[28:49] drawing
[28:50] if you'd like to follow along
[28:53] I believe that fits exactly the Bible or
[28:55] that Daniel says that they'll be you
[28:58] know the building of the temple then it
[29:00] would be
[29:01] um 62 weeks and then it would be one
[29:03] week left Amen to Israel and Satan
[29:06] copies after that to run his amen oh
[29:08] deal at the end all right now
[29:12] this may look odd because of the people
[29:15] that are teaching the message
[29:19] and leaving this over here
[29:21] you know
[29:23] all right but now he done it so now do
[29:25] that right argue with that all you want
[29:27] to we'll give you a couple of quotes
[29:30] I think he uses about six times speaking
[29:33] of the chart as a matter of fact
[29:34] he even spoke of the chart down in
[29:36] Tifton Georgia
[29:40] all right go ahead and pull up your
[29:42] brother Joe not the other drawing jump
[29:45] over that for a second and pull up the
[29:47] number 11a you know which is
[29:50] 41.
[29:53] oh there we go maybe you don't have it
[29:55] in yours
[29:56] okay he's doing it back up okay we got
[29:59] we got a split condition on this thing
[30:00] all right forgive me now look what he
[30:03] said
[30:04] he said oh this is perfect 41 this end
[30:07] of the week oh what a lesson I said to
[30:08] my wife the other day yep
[30:10] I wonder if the people are really
[30:12] getting it now I want you to get it amen
[30:14] don't if you we have to stay here all
[30:18] day long just stay amen now we'll we may
[30:21] have to be here like lunch
[30:23] now we'll we we want to get it see we we
[30:27] want to know what that is true you see
[30:31] they want to know through and you if you
[30:33] can just only see it
[30:35] I asked Mike maybe then afterwards I'm
[30:39] going to leave the chart here
[30:41] the chart the drawing we just showed
[30:43] yeah I'm going to leave it here and you
[30:46] can draw it out afterwards come in here
[30:48] this afternoon when you want to and draw
[30:50] out the charts and so forth and it'll
[30:52] help you to understand that's the reason
[30:54] I put it in dark okay go ahead brother
[30:55] Anderson to the next program 99. and if
[31:00] you notice on my chart here I want you
[31:01] to get this now and draw it you notice
[31:03] here where I got the cross that's where
[31:05] they rejected
[31:07] but the time extended out just a little
[31:09] bit further on see why 30 40 50 60 seven
[31:13] that's the Titus and we'll go back to
[31:15] the drawing you'll see 40 years later
[31:17] it's Titus the Roman general destroyed
[31:20] Jerusalem destroy Israel Jerusalem and
[31:22] Scattered the people of the world okay
[31:25] thank you brother Anderson go back now
[31:26] brother Joe to the
[31:29] to the drawing right not the sex of the
[31:33] first one
[31:34] the original
[31:35] okay okay there you go now we got it
[31:39] all right then you see seven weeks 62.
[31:43] come on over there he said to check it
[31:46] and see that's right
[31:48] all right
[31:49] now
[31:51] a lot of people don't believe that
[31:53] drawing to be authentic but we have
[31:55] proof that it is and that's fine that's
[31:57] right I have proof enough to note myself
[31:59] but when I received it that I did
[32:01] receive that drawing right there are a
[32:03] couple of other drawings that are kind
[32:05] of touched up and there was one recently
[32:08] that would put out in the Philippines
[32:09] that went over a little bit too far
[32:12] right and I'll compare that with this
[32:16] next drawing that we do now so you see
[32:19] what I'm saying
[32:21] seven weeks 62 weeks make 69 weeks 483
[32:25] years right here that means that there's
[32:27] exactly seven years left over on the
[32:29] other side
[32:30] all right now go up and I will show you
[32:32] what people believe
[32:34] you're looking in your notes you'll see
[32:35] it turned kind of sideways
[32:37] let's see what people believe
[32:40] now legal drawings that's where we got
[32:42] them I Want It That Way
[32:44] see this is what people believe right
[32:48] most of the people of the message I've
[32:50] ever talked to this is their Doctrine
[32:51] that's right all right
[32:54] and to make their Doctrine come out
[32:56] right
[32:58] then I just made a little by Brother
[33:00] Joe's help a little drawing where we
[33:03] kind of edited what we originally had
[33:06] you know you look over here they're 69
[33:08] weeks one week left
[33:10] this is what basically people believe
[33:13] they believe that seven weeks 62 and a
[33:16] half weeks which would give you the
[33:18] three and a half years of the ministry
[33:19] of Jesus Christ in this three and a half
[33:21] years over here on that side through the
[33:23] two prophets now you keep that drawing
[33:25] because that drawing is vital to you
[33:28] because that is exactly what most people
[33:30] are saying and the one from the
[33:32] Philippines that's right almost
[33:34] identically matches right that
[33:37] all right so you see that there's a
[33:39] difference I'm showing you what people
[33:41] believe
[33:43] because the only way you can believe it
[33:45] is that away if you're not going to
[33:47] believe the truth then amen all right
[33:49] you're gonna have to believe that Jesus
[33:50] preached see what they believe is Jesus
[33:53] come up here to 80 30. we'll get
[33:55] something in just a minute on that and
[33:57] over there
[33:58] and then he preached three and a half
[33:59] years to come up to 80 33.
[34:04] you see that's what they think right
[34:07] did Jesus come up 69 weeks up to here
[34:10] and one half a week extended over here
[34:12] on Jesus ministry and that makes it work
[34:15] out now
[34:17] simple little mathematical calculations
[34:19] if you look back over here
[34:23] you'll see a little calculations called
[34:25] 80 30 and you'll see another one called
[34:27] 80 70.
[34:29] all right
[34:31] if this drawing is right you would have
[34:33] to have that ad70
[34:36] three and a half
[34:38] it wouldn't calculate
[34:41] and what I'm saying is none of these
[34:43] things will match as we go through it
[34:44] you'll see that don't match right all
[34:46] right so then we got to stay with us
[34:48] we've got ahead and cancel this one and
[34:51] let's move on
[34:52] all right
[34:55] go to number 12.
[34:58] all right
[35:01] now let's take what he's saying and get
[35:03] on with it
[35:05] and remember the drawing is there any
[35:07] way you can put that drawing back up
[35:08] over here or switch to folks over there
[35:10] in this number here how many original
[35:12] one
[35:13] I want the original drawing okay so you
[35:17] can watch as we read
[35:20] now let's Outlet outline Daniel 70 of
[35:24] weeks Burger 61. now I'm not repeat here
[35:28] again Ministers of gospel if you
[35:29] disagree with this all right they were
[35:31] divided in three periods amen and we
[35:34] find out in Daniel now we read Daniel in
[35:36] divides in three periods that's right
[35:39] first a seven week period
[35:42] I hear
[35:44] the inner three score let me get my
[35:46] corner
[35:48] not seven weeks we're trying to figure
[35:51] out why not get something I brought my
[35:52] sword out here I said if that don't work
[35:54] on this brother calling you different
[35:59] all right so what's he say it's divided
[36:02] into three periods one two
[36:05] three all right now
[36:09] first just one week here seven seven
[36:12] week period 49 years to build another
[36:15] Temple right here
[36:17] all right
[36:18] and then a three score in two weeks 60
[36:21] which is 62 weeks then a one week period
[36:24] left amen they're divided into three and
[36:27] he said I got to divide it on the board
[36:28] here's the first period second period to
[36:30] my understanding by the gospel the End
[36:32] of Time returns to the Jews all right so
[36:34] now
[36:36] you say but now brother Dale let's see
[36:38] is that the one where we got it next on
[36:39] it I have to follow my own notes
[36:49] all right we're going down we're going
[36:51] down one more then we'll pick up or
[36:52] something so watch that when we get down
[36:54] so go ahead and change it 72
[36:57] progress 72.
[37:00] now if there was
[37:02] look there's exactly 49 days not 49
[37:06] years rather than the time of the
[37:07] building of the temple the seven or
[37:09] seven prophetic weeks seven weeks
[37:11] because there was seven weeks determined
[37:14] to the temple to rebuild the Temple
[37:16] and it was to build it was built in
[37:19] exactly 49 years now watch that we're
[37:21] going to get a scripture in a second
[37:23] now we have the meaning of the time of
[37:25] weeks because as the Bible said the
[37:27] angel said it taken seven weeks until
[37:29] the building of the Temple
[37:31] that's a that's uh Daniel 9 24. all
[37:35] right and it was exactly 49 years
[37:37] building the Temple from the March the
[37:40] 14th until the BC 538 until the temple
[37:44] was restored again and the streets were
[37:46] bestowed remember the temple was trying
[37:48] to try to build a two or three times
[37:49] back in the Old Testament they finally
[37:50] got it built
[37:52] I'm not talking about the rich that's
[37:55] talking about the original but it was
[37:56] talking about also the owners coming
[37:58] through right all right so what do we
[38:00] got what do you get for seven weeks it
[38:02] means 49 years then one week equals
[38:05] seven years seven times seven is 49 just
[38:07] exactly there you are now there's no
[38:09] more questioning about it we know now
[38:13] that each week meant seven years have
[38:14] you got it let's say it together one
[38:16] week's equal seven years one week into
[38:18] seven years all right now in case you
[38:21] two are out there or anyone else click
[38:23] up the next my brother's joke
[38:26] and brother Anderson never who's pulling
[38:29] those quotes right look at John
[38:34] then said the Jews 40 and six years
[38:38] you remember Jesus said destroyed this
[38:39] Temple my raise up three days this was
[38:42] their answer
[38:43] 46 years was his temple in building
[38:47] you look down rearing up in three days
[38:51] wow
[38:53] contradiction between Daniel 9 24
[38:55] and John
[38:57] two
[38:59] unless you go back and read Daniel 9 24
[39:01] if you look back in front of your page
[39:03] and he said and the walls
[39:06] and the streets were built in trouble
[39:07] sometimes 46 years they were correct in
[39:12] the temple restoration are building the
[39:14] Temple but it took the other three three
[39:18] years
[39:19] to do the streets in the city so Daniel
[39:22] and John is not contrary that's not a
[39:26] contradiction see that's what I said as
[39:28] long as you lay them out yeah and you
[39:30] keep studying God put them together
[39:32] where you don't have a question about it
[39:34] all right now
[39:39] here's the one going with number 15.
[39:44] here's the one that we were talking
[39:45] about a while ago where Jesus said well
[39:47] how many times you forgive a man
[39:49] Jesus said 70 times 7.
[39:52] that's 490 or 490 times if you read on
[39:57] you'll find out it says and again if yes
[40:00] so you say now brother Mark I'm right on
[40:03] the border you only got one more
[40:08] but it said and again
[40:17] make your life a little get going all
[40:19] right now let's start on this part and
[40:23] cover the 62 weeks
[40:26] seven years we've covered in the
[40:28] building Temple let's cover the 62 weeks
[40:30] before and we'll get up to 483 years all
[40:33] right so we can pull up number 16.
[40:37] all right Cindy equipment Daniel
[40:38] progress 78.
[40:44] Messiah was Christ
[40:46] now he comes right in here but here's
[40:47] where he's crucified amen all right you
[40:50] say yeah but that's 30.
[40:52] hang on okay just hold on a little bit
[40:54] and made it to it
[40:56] make it 69 weeks so whatever you do back
[40:58] here is 69 weeks it's not 69 and a half
[41:01] in the cross amen it's 69 weeks all
[41:04] right you're mathematically off if you
[41:06] go the other way of that drawing we just
[41:07] had oh and I don't believe that yeah
[41:10] okay
[41:11] 7.69 483 years and getting it down if
[41:13] you want to run over it I'll be glad to
[41:15] do it now we're told from the going for
[41:17] the command to rebuild it send it to the
[41:19] Messiah shall be seven that's seven
[41:21] that's the first first right here seven
[41:23] weeks three score in two weeks 62 weeks
[41:26] and seven is 69 and that's 69 weeks
[41:29] seven times 69 would make 483 years
[41:33] therefore until the Messiah now we're
[41:36] coming up to this part here so evidently
[41:38] he was pointing them here right yeah
[41:40] it's going to be 483 years that's right
[41:43] okay amen now in that 483 years there is
[41:46] even a quote and brought around
[41:48] in the silver that word that Jesus is
[41:51] actually cut off 62 weeks out of the 70.
[41:55] and that's exactly what happened
[41:58] when they finish that template
[42:04] the Jews
[42:05] rejected God
[42:08] sure for 62 weeks
[42:15] come on when they finish that Temple it
[42:18] was downhill way back here but when they
[42:20] got that temple built it was downhill
[42:23] and they finally killed a man
[42:25] and all of this was about that's right
[42:29] and that's just to show you how
[42:31] technical bro around a minute he said
[42:33] it's 62 weeks he was cut off I didn't
[42:36] bring that quote
[42:37] all right but now listen
[42:42] let's see something here as we go let's
[42:44] make sure these are correct so we go up
[42:47] to paragraph 80.
[42:50] now now Jesus rode into the city of
[42:52] Jerusalem drive on the back of about you
[42:54] on Palm Sunday April the 2nd 80 30.
[42:57] right
[42:59] all right Jesus wrote in Jerusalem on
[43:01] Palm Sunday
[43:02] and remember Palm Sunday is one Sunday
[43:04] before the resurrection all right amen
[43:07] so this is not the start of his ministry
[43:09] right right you understand this is not
[43:11] the start of his ministry
[43:13] when he rode into Jerusalem on Palm
[43:15] Sunday was was the Sunday before the
[43:18] crew for the resurrection so he was
[43:19] crucified on Friday raised on Sunday
[43:21] right amen now
[43:24] now for bc445
[43:28] the ad30 is exactly 473 years but we've
[43:32] already seen now watch it the 69 weeks
[43:34] makes 183 years now there's where the
[43:36] trouble comes in right there
[43:38] we've got only with the marking of the
[43:40] Bible here time only 475 years
[43:44] and actually it's 483 a difference of
[43:47] eight years
[43:48] all right
[43:49] now God can't make it Miss if he said it
[43:52] would be so many days or so many days he
[43:54] said so much to me so much what are we
[43:56] going to do
[43:57] BC 475 to 80 30 if you in our astronomy
[44:01] years
[44:03] which are 365 and a four
[44:06] in each but we reduce them days to our
[44:09] prophetic calendar prophetic calendar is
[44:12] 360 days right amen each month only had
[44:16] 30 days
[44:18] all right all right when you come over
[44:20] to the flood and you come over to the
[44:22] fall the in the garden it would have
[44:24] been 360 when you fell to the fall and
[44:27] Men come out it made it for 365 and a
[44:30] fourth and especially vindicating up to
[44:33] the flood because that's where the Earth
[44:34] went from this to this right
[44:37] right and begin to wobble so you got 365
[44:40] to four days right amen all right now
[44:43] watch
[44:45] so go ahead and put up the next number
[44:47] 16.
[44:48] we got 16a tonight we got to go to this
[44:51] notice uh as part of that looks
[44:53] modification
[45:00] okay maybe we didn't put in the
[45:02] modification because we don't
[45:03] multiplication Brother Anderson
[45:05] okay all right you can figure it out
[45:07] anyway all right you multiply 475.
[45:12] Now watch how close your profit was
[45:14] mathematically brother Joe's noted on
[45:16] this side okay
[45:17] okay 475 he says we're off because we
[45:20] got 475 right he said we need 483.
[45:24] sodium multiply 475 by
[45:27] 365.25 don't do it with one-fourth
[45:29] you've got a problem 0.25 you
[45:31] mathematicians are good at that
[45:32] especially if we can make our one even
[45:34] he's a rafter he knows that goes 25. all
[45:38] right all right
[45:39] equals 173493.75
[45:46] let's do it by 365.25
[45:49] are what did we say take that number one
[45:53] seven three four nine point seven five
[45:55] divide it by 360 you come out to be
[45:57] 481.9270833333
[46:03] in other words you come out to 482.
[46:06] do you say yeah he said they don't pay
[46:08] one year off
[46:11] you're in the period of time are you
[46:13] familiar with this we mentioned this at
[46:15] The Minister's meeting you know a lot of
[46:16] them didn't even know this the calendars
[46:18] has been changed three times
[46:21] you've got the Greg ruin the Pope the
[46:23] Alexandra
[46:25] Julian
[46:26] the calendars has been changed so it's
[46:29] easy to miss one one week
[46:32] I mean one one year
[46:35] I'm not trying to justify him I'm just
[46:37] saying
[46:37] because when he said it's got to be 483
[46:40] I don't care if we modify that and it
[46:42] don't come out right it's 483.
[46:46] that's what God says okay you know
[46:49] that's what your Prophet said it was
[46:51] amen amen all right but you've got your
[46:53] calendars have changed one year they had
[46:55] 200 and something days in one year uh
[46:58] one year they had a change into the
[47:00] calendar one year they had 13 months in
[47:02] the in the year the line of stars back
[47:05] up see you know you noticed the other
[47:07] day not too long ago the prophet
[47:09] mentioned ain't done it again that had a
[47:11] faculty clock
[47:14] right
[47:15] come on you're wobbling
[47:19] right they had to add a second to the
[47:21] time clock
[47:23] to make it perfect
[47:25] they're having to change all constantly
[47:26] because we're wobbling but when she goes
[47:28] back to 360. right
[47:31] yeah you're right you'd be perfect amen
[47:33] right now okay so then just to show them
[47:36] you how I close and how mathematically a
[47:38] man can be
[47:41] and yet people will argue
[47:43] all right
[47:45] look at 17 and let's pick up something
[47:47] very interesting
[47:50] paragraph 84.
[47:52] our prophetic calendar to bring us to
[47:54] 360 days and we use now in the scripture
[47:57] we have exactly 483 there it is 183.
[48:01] how we have exactly proof of the
[48:03] prophecy exactly the truth
[48:06] more far from the time of the going
[48:08] forward to build a temple and to destroy
[48:10] or when they rejected Christ and killed
[48:13] him in A.D 33.
[48:17] and we just read one where that they
[48:19] killed him in A.D 30.
[48:23] okay
[48:25] when Christ was killed makes exactly 483
[48:28] years pull the drawing back up over here
[48:34] 493 a year
[48:39] 62 7 483.
[48:43] right keep that in mind just leave that
[48:45] number okay
[48:46] all right safe job going to the next
[48:53] when God had the undiluvian world and
[48:55] destroy the water they changed the
[48:57] astronomy date and then let the Romans
[49:00] come in and make up their calendar which
[49:02] it hits and Miss until 4 short and
[49:03] disproving the point get to the bottom
[49:05] there it is exactly
[49:07] 483 years from the going forth of the
[49:10] Commandment to restore and to restore
[49:13] the bill until the time of prayer
[49:15] Messiah was rejected
[49:18] rejected
[49:19] 183 years still keeping your calendars
[49:22] and everything is balanced
[49:24] all right and we're going to get
[49:25] something in a second about that well
[49:27] here we are
[49:29] go ahead with number 19.
[49:34] no let's take something you just see if
[49:36] you understand
[49:37] you know that our calendar systems is
[49:40] all goofed up
[49:42] you know that Jesus were actually born
[49:43] in 4 BC that's right sure how many of
[49:47] you know that I mean I actually know
[49:48] that he was born in 4 BC
[49:52] because you can prove it by the king
[49:54] that was in command
[49:56] in his death and what took place and all
[49:58] you can prove right they see they were
[50:00] trying to run the calendars now we've
[50:02] got this so we don't need it don't pull
[50:04] it up brother joke on this two headaches
[50:07] I'm going to make a statement it's going
[50:08] to be contrary to your thinking
[50:12] right around is exactly right when he
[50:14] said 483 and he's exactly right I mean
[50:16] when he said 1833 and he's exactly right
[50:19] when he said 80 30.
[50:21] because according to the calendar we're
[50:23] under Jesus was crucified 80 33.
[50:27] according to the calendar we're under
[50:29] because they put us on number one right
[50:33] but according to what happened really
[50:36] Jesus was born for BC
[50:39] 432-1123 you might imagine that they've
[50:41] had it figured out totally
[50:43] 80 33 in 80 30 is the same date
[50:48] if you got chance enough to be able to
[50:53] think
[50:55] our calendar starts one two three four
[50:58] five right but if Jesus was born for BC
[51:00] you're gonna go four one four three two
[51:02] one one two three four five
[51:05] so he's riding both places
[51:07] this needs a little sense a lot of
[51:10] Revelation
[51:11] now you're a mathematician but I got a
[51:14] little sense but this is what I want you
[51:15] to see
[51:18] Jesus rode into Jerusalem
[51:21] until they see the Jerusalem trap on the
[51:23] back of a hot mule on Palm Sunday
[51:27] April 2nd
[51:29] 80 30. right
[51:31] Palm Sunday was one week one Sunday
[51:34] before the resurrection everybody know
[51:37] that amen Palm Sunday is one Sunday
[51:40] before the Resurrection Sunday we call
[51:43] it so he was crucified on Friday we got
[51:46] the proof of these they argue this even
[51:48] in the message they're arguing it but
[51:50] Jesus was crucified on Friday raised the
[51:53] Bible said early the first day of the
[51:55] week amen the old Doctrine is and he was
[51:58] crucified on Wednesday and he went into
[52:00] grade three days and three nights and
[52:02] when it finally all got councilmated out
[52:04] he come up on Saturday afternoon nope
[52:07] you never heard that old doctor
[52:09] that's all you organized religious God
[52:11] he raised on Saturday afternoon hung
[52:15] around all night appeared to John
[52:16] appeared to the disciples Sunday morning
[52:19] your Prophet said he died on Friday
[52:21] raised on Sunday that's right the Bible
[52:25] said he rose early the first day of the
[52:28] week they didn't say he rose on Saturday
[52:30] the last day the seventh and finally
[52:33] come up on the eighth day now I said he
[52:35] rose right so we got the Bible and I
[52:38] want you to remember that
[52:43] April 2nd
[52:46] he said will he change that later
[52:50] well let's see if he did
[52:52] look tonight
[52:58] making sure you're not stable but I know
[52:59] it's a little bit okay
[53:02] so here's brother random speaking in
[53:04] 1963 324 in the morning series questions
[53:07] and answered on the sealed
[53:09] paragraph 188 now we know that Jesus was
[53:12] slain about 80 30.
[53:16] all right that's right it was about the
[53:19] middle of the year I guess 80 30. but
[53:22] the Bible said he was fighting for the
[53:23] foundation work right okay so now after
[53:26] the seals
[53:28] because people want to say I want what
[53:29] he's got in his sword in that hand
[53:32] you know
[53:34] that's what everybody wants when the
[53:36] word comes to the prophet you better
[53:37] remember when the word comes to the
[53:39] Prophet The Sword in his hand he come to
[53:40] the Tabernacle and was going to preach
[53:42] the white horse rider as the Holy Spirit
[53:46] until he was corrected that's right so
[53:48] because he's got the sword in the hand
[53:49] don't mean he's got it in his heart
[53:51] right right simple right Revelation you
[53:55] say well let's go with god let's go one
[53:57] more minute
[54:03] look at this one now
[54:05] on The Sixth Seal paragraph 148. now
[54:08] let's stop there these three verses it
[54:11] took place
[54:12] actually on Tuesday afternoon
[54:17] April the 4th
[54:20] 80 30.
[54:22] and the first two remember that's when
[54:24] they asked him the questions and the
[54:25] answers that come up into the seals
[54:27] right in Matthew in the scripture
[54:30] April the 4th A.D 30 and the two verses
[54:34] took place in the at first two verses
[54:35] that plays an afternoon of the April the
[54:37] 4th at 80 30. Julius three times he's
[54:40] using 80 30. right
[54:42] now you showed me where he uses 33 and
[54:44] keeps it correct
[54:48] all I'm asking
[54:50] but did you catch what we're looking at
[54:54] the first one was Palm Sunday
[55:00] April the second
[55:03] Sunday
[55:05] Monday
[55:07] Tuesday
[55:10] your profit was so mathematically
[55:12] correct this statement says that that
[55:15] took place on April the 2nd
[55:18] this one says April the 4th
[55:22] yeah how perfect can a man be
[55:25] that had a nice great education
[55:28] her seventh grade
[55:30] just giving you that approval Point amen
[55:32] all right
[55:35] so keep that in mind
[55:37] Sunday Monday Tuesday April 2nd was
[55:41] Sunday Monday is the third Tuesday is
[55:43] the fourth
[55:44] Jesus was crucified on Friday about the
[55:47] seventh or something Rose then
[55:50] on the first day of the week amen so
[55:52] he's mathematically correct he knows but
[55:54] even though now I say this I don't know
[55:57] of any word would run around and said
[55:58] Jesus was born before BC
[56:01] I'll run that I don't know but evidently
[56:04] new because his mathematics is right
[56:06] right and his mathematics is yours right
[56:10] and see Jesus then was crucified
[56:14] 80 30.
[56:17] God dealt with the Jews to 80 70. we'll
[56:20] cover that more this afternoon
[56:23] when I think about it
[56:28] April the 2nd
[56:31] April the 4th
[56:33] Lydia's crucifixion
[56:35] Resurrection Church ages and then he
[56:37] comes back to deal
[56:38] so if this is right over here that'll
[56:40] have to be right away and that's the
[56:41] main thing I want to deal with
[56:44] so go ahead and paragraph 23.
[56:47] well we got you know we got Luke in
[56:49] there
[56:51] yeah
[56:52] all right
[56:54] the reason we got Luke
[56:57] is because maybe you didn't notice
[57:02] your Prophet says that Jesus was born in
[57:04] April
[57:05] right and crucified in April
[57:09] now get me three and a half years of
[57:11] ministry in there
[57:13] thank you
[57:16] if you're doing that you'll come exactly
[57:18] where I'm talking about but if you're
[57:20] not you're going to lap yourself over
[57:21] and miss it right
[57:26] how could it be born in April crucified
[57:28] in April preach 33 or have a 33 and a
[57:31] half years
[57:33] everybody wants to die
[57:36] did you understand what I'm saying
[57:40] if he's born in April crucified April
[57:42] how do you preached three and a half
[57:43] years
[57:47] because Luke says in Jesus himself began
[57:50] to be about 30 years of age
[57:52] so we entered the ministry at 29 and a
[57:55] half
[57:58] right
[58:00] he entered the minister at 29.5 he did
[58:02] not the way he was 30 to enter the
[58:04] ministry
[58:05] internet 29.5 according to Luke
[58:08] all right so that makes it perfectly
[58:10] correct
[58:12] all right
[58:12] all right then you can preach three and
[58:15] a half years because he could enter the
[58:16] ministry
[58:18] at 29 and a half
[58:20] man and I give him the half a year
[58:24] Technically when you're putting it that
[58:26] he was crucified in April 83rd you would
[58:29] go back to 26 and a half or 27-91 of the
[58:32] two way to cover that this evening you
[58:34] would come to Mary come up to 80 30.
[58:36] right but if you get what I'm saying
[58:39] he entered the ministry 2909. all right
[58:42] now let's get into it and try to run
[58:44] real fast go ahead and run it number 20
[58:47] 28.
[58:50] 3
[58:51] all right
[58:53] I got 94.
[58:56] you thought about 144 000 don't appear
[58:58] all right the road they appear not in
[59:02] the third chapter
[59:03] they're on over in the scriptures father
[59:05] and now we see that all this stuff was
[59:08] to take place was over in this time of
[59:11] the 70th week last week
[59:13] now that they're
[59:17] now that they're already at 69 weeks and
[59:20] living exactly the way God said they did
[59:22] and happened exactly the way God said it
[59:25] would do then there's one more week
[59:27] promise to the Jews all right now here's
[59:31] where the people say according to that
[59:32] drawing we had want to go they say
[59:34] there's only three and a half years
[59:37] I've been around say that one week after
[59:39] the Rapture yes sir
[59:41] let's prove that moment as we go along
[59:43] go to the next one
[59:47] I got 96.
[59:50] now we come up and we're
[59:53] we got them up here to the rejection of
[59:55] Messiah and from the rejecting them
[59:57] beside the last week all right and you
[59:59] can read all the way down we got all the
[1:00:01] rights today 70 weeks left one more than
[1:00:04] seven years you know so you got in front
[1:00:06] of trying to short time okay go to the
[1:00:08] next
[1:00:11] 25 this is paradigm 105.
[1:00:15] and you you haven't got any limited time
[1:00:19] like the Jews see we don't Virginia well
[1:00:21] we got a sign what is a sign this one's
[1:00:24] our sign amen all right yes
[1:00:28] was our sign
[1:00:32] God did
[1:00:34] oh back it up you click one too quick
[1:00:37] leave it at one radio well God did with
[1:00:40] the Jews exactly what he said he would
[1:00:42] do in them 69 years or 483 years for 69
[1:00:46] weeks and one week left one week she had
[1:00:49] determined amen you want to say at the
[1:00:51] doctrine among the people is only three
[1:00:52] and a half years after the Rapture
[1:00:55] but around 77 years actually that's
[1:00:58] right so which one we're going to tell
[1:01:00] you hey man go to the next one
[1:01:03] this is paragraph 188 right here where
[1:01:07] did the massage get cut off exactly
[1:01:08] where the word said where will that 70th
[1:01:10] Week begin exactly after this church is
[1:01:14] cut off then God returns to the Jew amen
[1:01:17] where will send this week begin
[1:01:20] amen right all right it'll begin exactly
[1:01:25] when the church is cut off happy
[1:01:29] 165.
[1:01:33] and in the middle of this week now
[1:01:36] here's the 70. now these exactly were
[1:01:38] seven years in each one of the weeks we
[1:01:40] were already at 69 weeks and then we
[1:01:42] have the Gentiles page and we know that
[1:01:46] we're at the end Gentile then there's
[1:01:48] one more week left for the Jews that's
[1:01:52] exactly seven years
[1:01:55] trying to save time you've got the
[1:01:56] quilts even real next
[1:02:02] you notice we're giving about four or
[1:02:04] five quotes which is one week left amen
[1:02:06] all right
[1:02:09] notice the 69 weeks hit perfectly the
[1:02:11] Jews were in their Homeland in a gentile
[1:02:13] Church age
[1:02:14] exactly to the end time to the
[1:02:16] Nickelodeon time or to the lady of CNN
[1:02:19] how close it is to the coming of the
[1:02:21] Lord the ending of the thing into the
[1:02:23] thing the end of this age in the Rapture
[1:02:26] the moment he starts the 70th week or
[1:02:29] seven years the church is gone amen and
[1:02:33] he said if you can see that raise your
[1:02:35] hand now hand many by God raised their
[1:02:38] hand everybody the congregation was
[1:02:42] waving
[1:02:43] yeah we see it
[1:02:46] but when he died we don't see him
[1:02:50] the hand went down
[1:02:54] you know they missed what he was to say
[1:02:58] all right
[1:03:00] let's see
[1:03:02] what else brother next
[1:03:07] these 69 weeks hit perfectly going away
[1:03:09] the juicy perfectly the church ate it
[1:03:11] perfectly we're at the end the end time
[1:03:13] jump down the morning he starts the 70s
[1:03:15] week or seven years the church is gone
[1:03:17] now listen I'm quoting
[1:03:20] you read this in the morning
[1:03:26] you read that one long ago right
[1:03:28] the moment he starts the 70th week or
[1:03:30] seven years the church is gone now
[1:03:32] listen I'm quoting again re-quoting so
[1:03:35] he won't forget
[1:03:36] this is what the Holy Spirit put upon my
[1:03:38] opinion while I was writing
[1:03:43] so they just went through
[1:03:46] that's right
[1:03:47] proven this is right this is right
[1:03:49] and this is right that's right
[1:03:53] so there's seven years after the Rapture
[1:03:56] of the church amen that is not is not
[1:04:00] the old denominational teaching
[1:04:05] the old denominational teaching is that
[1:04:08] there is a seven year tribulation period
[1:04:11] right after the Rapture
[1:04:14] there's a chosen people who go up
[1:04:17] but there's some people that are going
[1:04:19] to be left that are bride
[1:04:22] Church
[1:04:23] that are going to be here for three and
[1:04:25] a half years
[1:04:26] and have to give their lives and things
[1:04:28] but that's still part of the Bride
[1:04:30] you know and then go into chaos
[1:04:33] with Elisha height and that's to Israel
[1:04:36] so they got what they call a
[1:04:40] minor tribulation
[1:04:42] for the first three and I in a major
[1:04:45] tribulation
[1:04:46] that is not what brother Brown is
[1:04:48] talking about right but I started out
[1:04:50] with my saying he never taught no word
[1:04:53] show it to me
[1:04:55] did he ever taught a seven years of
[1:04:57] tribulation right
[1:05:01] no that's not only art right to me
[1:05:04] you always talked three and a half years
[1:05:05] of tribulation amen that lines up with
[1:05:08] Jacob's trouble
[1:05:10] all right all right in your Bible
[1:05:13] about to line up with Jacob struggle
[1:05:16] let's see what we're in
[1:05:24] 29.
[1:05:28] we'll get back to this part down in here
[1:05:30] in just a minute if we don't get it just
[1:05:32] remember
[1:05:33] Jacob's trouble is
[1:05:36] great and one high of year
[1:05:41] it's not Jacob working for them amen
[1:05:46] Jacob's trouble
[1:05:48] Jacob's trouble is this right here three
[1:05:52] and a half years of the tribulation that
[1:05:54] will strike Israel this is exactly what
[1:05:57] he says Great Tribulation period a
[1:06:00] cleansing I'm standing it away ahead of
[1:06:02] time a cleansing of the land right
[1:06:04] here's Armageddon you got it right there
[1:06:07] Armageddon takes place here and then
[1:06:09] there's time passed the Armageddon amen
[1:06:13] for the cleansing of the land getting
[1:06:15] ready for the Millennium amen we'll get
[1:06:17] down the description do something
[1:06:24] look at number 30. not on the marathon
[1:06:27] mode
[1:06:30] this is paragraph
[1:06:32] 83.
[1:06:34] no excuse
[1:06:37] and he's coming down with the times of
[1:06:39] the 77 I'm not going to get into and
[1:06:41] here we are at the End of the Age after
[1:06:43] coming into this Indian we we don't know
[1:06:45] what time that the church will be gone
[1:06:47] oh my we don't know coming into the 70th
[1:06:50] week okay now
[1:06:55] look at 31.
[1:06:58] I have 83.
[1:07:02] yesterday's over here in Revelations
[1:07:04] 13 or 11 chapter in the third version
[1:07:07] them two prophets will prophesy
[1:07:11] 1203 score days
[1:07:15] then they're cut off an Armageddon sits
[1:07:18] in
[1:07:20] and if that be so
[1:07:22] you're talking about the 30 days and the
[1:07:24] months and the protein backers and forth
[1:07:25] go to the next
[1:07:29] paragraph 167.
[1:07:32] this is where the Antichrist comes back
[1:07:33] in what he's doing he makes a covenant
[1:07:35] quick as we leave out of here
[1:07:37] right
[1:07:39] and we've got a thing that I'm not going
[1:07:42] to release it here we've got a thing
[1:07:44] proven something that's that I say is
[1:07:47] the very head of what the world is going
[1:07:50] to think
[1:07:52] when they find out that this Pope
[1:07:56] is going to set that Covenant in motion
[1:08:00] I won't say it on here because we got
[1:08:02] the paper today
[1:08:04] but it was on the news
[1:08:07] of what the pope said
[1:08:13] uh-huh
[1:08:15] but if we can't prove that we better
[1:08:16] hold on now we've got the papers to
[1:08:18] prove this off another
[1:08:19] some of you already heard it know what
[1:08:21] it is I'm just not putting it on here
[1:08:24] I say that's the beginning because the
[1:08:27] man made an honest statement that's
[1:08:28] right of what preceded now the world is
[1:08:32] going to fall at his feet and say he's
[1:08:34] honest we would write about what was
[1:08:36] back here but now this man is changing
[1:08:39] because you got to make a covenant right
[1:08:41] come on folks now we work for General
[1:08:43] Motors right
[1:08:45] some of us
[1:08:46] the Bible said he'll confirm his
[1:08:48] Covenant for a week confirmed is not the
[1:08:51] word covenant heart
[1:08:52] when you had a covenant you started a
[1:08:55] year or two but when the contract was
[1:08:56] running out you started a year before
[1:08:59] the ending of the contract and they
[1:09:01] started negotiating negotiating
[1:09:03] negotiating it runs up to the time of
[1:09:05] the contract
[1:09:06] and they shine in agreement with the
[1:09:09] with the big head of the Union officials
[1:09:10] and the big head of the company
[1:09:12] officials that's not a contract
[1:09:15] that's why it says he confirmed
[1:09:17] to confirm is to ratify or establish but
[1:09:20] when the rank and file voted on that
[1:09:22] contract it became a contract
[1:09:26] when the world system
[1:09:28] takes the Antichrist Doctrine
[1:09:31] she will confirm
[1:09:35] that Covenant that's right brother amen
[1:09:39] the Catholic Church as of the last I
[1:09:43] know of
[1:09:44] I said me
[1:09:46] he is not a member of the World Council
[1:09:48] churches all right all right you may
[1:09:50] think it is go check it they're not a
[1:09:52] member of the workouts in church
[1:09:55] because the Bible said you got to come
[1:09:56] in by flattery
[1:10:00] is going to be invited in to control run
[1:10:03] around in the field books that they're
[1:10:04] looking for a Superman to come and take
[1:10:08] over and he said they're going to get
[1:10:11] one
[1:10:13] they don't believe it run any computer
[1:10:15] Superman you'll go straight to the seal
[1:10:17] book
[1:10:17] they're going to get a Satan Superman
[1:10:20] that's right brother that Satan Superman
[1:10:23] is going to be so sweet and humble until
[1:10:26] he's invited in
[1:10:28] and he makes craft to prosper
[1:10:31] is that the Book of Daniel that's right
[1:10:34] amen oh we need it right now don't we
[1:10:39] it'd be better if they put the pope as
[1:10:41] president
[1:10:45] God he's the guy that's got the money
[1:10:48] yeah that's right right
[1:10:52] my parents said we all moved up
[1:10:55] years ago when brother Branham said that
[1:10:58] the Catholic church was given a fall ago
[1:11:00] that was when it was probably 35 an
[1:11:02] ounce you just think if we took a
[1:11:05] thousand dollars a piece and bought
[1:11:08] a thousand dollars worth of gold at 35
[1:11:10] an ounce you realize what you'd have
[1:11:12] ma'am when it's 17 or 18. 17 point
[1:11:17] something 100 from that
[1:11:21] we don't be rich
[1:11:23] then I'd get to talk
[1:11:28] to me
[1:11:30] I'd be super real
[1:11:33] you knew it Danny why didn't you do it
[1:11:36] then
[1:11:37] all right listen get you buy it where
[1:11:40] you thank them
[1:11:41] but now listen you know sometimes people
[1:11:43] think that ain't a good thing to do
[1:11:45] but I'm not a speaker but a speaker
[1:11:48] knows how to get your attention to get
[1:11:49] you back now done we can talk okay
[1:11:54] he makes his Covenant
[1:11:57] and in the midst of the 70th week
[1:12:05] no
[1:12:06] bring that over here to you and you only
[1:12:09] have three and a half here no you got
[1:12:11] him right here right that's right he
[1:12:13] don't break his gun a year
[1:12:15] I've seen before the church as you start
[1:12:18] come on
[1:12:20] yep so after we get out of here in that
[1:12:22] one week he breaks just go to the nurse
[1:12:24] worm again he sets in the temple of God
[1:12:27] showing himself to be as God
[1:12:29] oh he goes in smooth and flattery to get
[1:12:32] the whole world behind you you're going
[1:12:33] to make everything work oh you'll have
[1:12:35] you think it didn't work out when this
[1:12:36] last guy said
[1:12:38] and lady come out of it and I'm not
[1:12:40] throwing off on him telling the truth
[1:12:41] she said he's gonna pay my house rent
[1:12:43] yeah he gonna buy me a car yeah right
[1:12:46] yeah well didn't work out too good all
[1:12:49] right let's see when they're going to
[1:12:51] flattery this guy in yep he's going to
[1:12:53] be the greatest of all he's going to
[1:12:55] admit that he was wrong
[1:13:01] he already is he's admitted he's right
[1:13:09] boy it's gonna be beautiful
[1:13:12] because she's going to cause crap to
[1:13:14] prosper and then how can you argue with
[1:13:17] it
[1:13:19] come on we're all under the big buddy
[1:13:21] system Brothers
[1:13:23] how many is in here one two three
[1:13:26] four
[1:13:28] five
[1:13:30] six
[1:13:33] calling Social Security I'm just
[1:13:36] counting that someone's I know
[1:13:39] what happened to Mark me cut that out
[1:13:43] why did he do that don't tell him he
[1:13:46] can't do that they've done done did it
[1:13:48] that's okay man right
[1:13:55] what if they kill you you can't get into
[1:13:57] more well fire you can't get into more
[1:13:59] assistance
[1:14:01] who are you going to eat
[1:14:02] I didn't say what are you going to eat I
[1:14:05] said who are you going to eat
[1:14:11] ain't enough Dearborn
[1:14:13] come on all right let's go on
[1:14:20] he makes a covenant he breaks it in the
[1:14:22] middle of the week
[1:14:26] taking breaks his Covenant in the middle
[1:14:28] of the week right here at arm again
[1:14:31] that's when God comes down when he
[1:14:33] breaks that Covenant that devil stands
[1:14:35] right there incarnate in the Beast
[1:14:39] absolutely amen he went from the Mount
[1:14:42] of sin and through here until there and
[1:14:45] he stands in the temple being the Beast
[1:14:47] amen he asked the prophet questions
[1:14:49] answers I mean you don't question an
[1:14:52] answer did second Thessalonians the
[1:14:54] amount of sin I think well God show
[1:14:56] himself to be out of God fulfill the
[1:14:57] first seal he said yes right
[1:15:00] so when that Antichrist comes in there
[1:15:02] he's going to be the beast in common
[1:15:04] Satan right when he had the Beast back
[1:15:06] like it was in the garden Right started
[1:15:08] with a beast Minds up with me
[1:15:12] but those two prophets will be what
[1:15:15] giving their message right here right
[1:15:19] and then he moves in right here that is
[1:15:23] a cleansing purifying we're going to
[1:15:25] prove I got time before hold on
[1:15:29] here is the statements most people make
[1:15:32] is it only three and a half years of
[1:15:34] time after the Rapture
[1:15:36] and that's what most of you Ministers of
[1:15:38] the message that I've ever heard speak
[1:15:40] on it that's right
[1:15:41] now I say it never hurts me coming right
[1:15:44] that they have three and a half years
[1:15:46] after the Rapture of the church then
[1:15:50] Armageddon and chaos
[1:15:52] nothing else
[1:15:54] all right
[1:15:55] quote number 33.
[1:15:57] let's prove this fallacy to be wrong
[1:16:00] Daniel 11 verse 12 11 and 12.
[1:16:05] and from the time of the daily sacrifice
[1:16:07] I'm gonna read something right there
[1:16:09] now let's see how many kids
[1:16:12] and from the time of the daily sacrifice
[1:16:14] shall be taken away in the ablation that
[1:16:17] make an excellent setup there shall be a
[1:16:20] thousand two hundred and ninety days
[1:16:24] right anybody caught it
[1:16:27] that's 10 days overdone over the two
[1:16:30] witnesses
[1:16:35] hang on
[1:16:38] blessed is he that waiteth and come to
[1:16:40] the thousand three hundred five in 30
[1:16:44] days
[1:16:45] so in the Book of Daniel there's time
[1:16:47] after the Armageddon right
[1:16:49] right at least 1300
[1:16:52] and something days but as I said in what
[1:16:55] wage copy
[1:16:56] it's gonna be a thousand two hundred and
[1:16:58] ninety days
[1:17:03] 42 months
[1:17:06] according to the Bible with the two
[1:17:08] witnesses
[1:17:09] is 1260 days
[1:17:13] Daniel know what he's talking about
[1:17:15] he goes to 30 days past it and then even
[1:17:19] says Glory it's blessed if you make it
[1:17:22] to 75 days
[1:17:28] so there's got to be according to the
[1:17:29] Bible 75 days
[1:17:31] past
[1:17:35] Armageddon
[1:17:38] now
[1:17:39] let's go over the Bible there could be a
[1:17:41] whole lot more so we had with paragraph
[1:17:43] 34.
[1:17:45] watch the temple now here's what's
[1:17:47] contrary to most people in the nation
[1:17:48] they don't believe a temple to be built
[1:17:50] in the millennium
[1:17:51] listen it is not a temple for offering
[1:17:53] sacrifices
[1:17:56] that 144 000 is turned to Christ they
[1:18:01] will not be offering sacrifices in the
[1:18:03] Millennium don't worry about your little
[1:18:05] animals it ain't going to be killed in
[1:18:06] the millennium
[1:18:08] all right but there is a temple to be
[1:18:11] built amen what far do prove the curse
[1:18:14] is gone right amen why do we have a
[1:18:16] Thousand-Year Millennial Reign to prove
[1:18:19] the sin curse it was put on in the
[1:18:20] garden right that Methuselah live 969
[1:18:23] years but he didn't make it to a
[1:18:25] thousand so somebody's going to live a
[1:18:27] thousand years called Millennial Reign
[1:18:29] amen you don't make no difference to me
[1:18:30] and you because we're going to be
[1:18:31] Eternal there we're going to be on a
[1:18:33] honeymoon we're going to be there with
[1:18:34] our
[1:18:35] husband
[1:18:39] watch I got 199. I see full purpose of
[1:18:42] getting a visit to Daniel
[1:18:44] now watch the description of the temple
[1:18:46] that is to be built in the millennium
[1:18:49] well that's just his words okay
[1:18:52] now anyone any reader
[1:18:56] all right
[1:18:58] theologians where you at yeah in the
[1:19:01] message where you at
[1:19:06] that from Ezekiel 40th chapter until
[1:19:08] about the 44th chapter there's nothing
[1:19:11] in the world but the millennium
[1:19:13] temple being arrested on Earth damn it
[1:19:19] he gives you the scripture
[1:19:21] during the Millennium is going to be a
[1:19:22] temple Bell
[1:19:29] now
[1:19:31] Ezekiel
[1:19:34] 40-44
[1:19:36] we just read in Daniel
[1:19:40] what 75 extra days right
[1:19:44] proving this time after the Millennium I
[1:19:46] mean after the Armageddon
[1:19:49] early time after Armageddon we've proved
[1:19:53] by the Bible now let's prove it again go
[1:19:55] ahead to Ezekiel look at this
[1:19:57] now remember
[1:19:58] Ezekiel 44 is a millennium Temple
[1:20:02] Ezekiel 39.
[1:20:05] one before you get to 40
[1:20:09] . yeah right right
[1:20:11] read the whole chapter I was going to
[1:20:14] read it all but don't have time
[1:20:16] to look right
[1:20:19] they that dwell in the city of Jerusalem
[1:20:21] shall go for it and she'll set on fire
[1:20:23] and burn the weapons
[1:20:25] both the Shields and the buffers the
[1:20:27] bows and the arrows and stays and the
[1:20:30] spirits and they should burn them with
[1:20:32] fire
[1:20:33] seven years
[1:20:42] we just picked up seven years
[1:20:45] verse 10.
[1:20:46] and you say well how do you know this is
[1:20:48] right from us chapter 39 now don't get
[1:20:50] massively confused there you know we
[1:20:53] don't have them kind of Shields and
[1:20:54] bucklers and bows and arrows and and
[1:20:56] staves you know let's change it over to
[1:20:59] uniforms and and and uh Bazookas and and
[1:21:03] all kinds of things like that okay right
[1:21:06] you know Ezekiel when he went and saw
[1:21:09] what
[1:21:10] the wheels in the middle of the wheel
[1:21:11] and he's so far out of heaven
[1:21:14] nuclear stuff falling but he could call
[1:21:16] it fire out of Heaven name and saw
[1:21:18] chariots Jocelyn in the streets running

[1:21:34] neither cut down any
[1:21:37] then they're cut down any out of the
[1:21:39] forest where they shall burn the weapons
[1:21:42] with fire
[1:21:43] and they shall spoil those that spoil to
[1:21:46] him and Rob those that robbed them
[1:21:49] says the Lord God
[1:21:52] and he shall come to pass that I will
[1:21:54] give unto God
[1:21:56] a place there of graves in Israel
[1:22:00] the valley of passengers on the east of
[1:22:03] the sea

[1:23:13] standard Bloom we just burned everything
[1:23:17] is what we're showing

[1:23:26] it could be handy for a while
[1:23:30] one bomb ain't gonna blow us to pieces
[1:23:33] to prove that but setting them off I
[1:23:35] turn the desert didn't belong didn't do
[1:23:37] it they proved it in Japan two of them
[1:23:39] didn't launch the pieces
[1:23:41] it only blow the city to Pieces right

[1:23:45] going to be falling on everybody right
[1:23:48] anybody's got anything left gonna fire
[1:23:50] them when Israel finds out the natural
[1:23:54] nation of Israel right there when they
[1:23:56] find out that Armageddon that they've
[1:23:58] missed this thing they say now we don't

[1:24:04] effect yep you know what the Samson
[1:24:06] effect was Samson died with his enemy
[1:24:09] when he pulled them down

[1:26:15] it the bride when she's taken from the
[1:26:17] church then the church age will cease
[1:26:20] maybe you'll see it goes into chaos the
[1:26:23] bride goes to glory and the tribulation
[1:26:26] period says it's up on the sleeping
[1:26:28] virgins for three and a half years while
[1:26:31] Israel is getting their message
[1:26:36] in this prophecy then tribulation sets
[1:26:40] in upon
[1:26:41] right Israel and a natural not Israel at
[1:26:46] 144 000 their tribulation is here
[1:26:51] all right

[1:26:58] thousand years the millennial Reign
[1:27:00] after that come to watch on judgment

[1:28:01] the time lies three and a half years of
[1:28:04] Daniel's 70th week promise to the Jews
[1:28:08] where it's going to be said
[1:28:10] this is going to cleanse it and that's
[1:28:13] going to be it
[1:28:16] that it brought around never talked
[1:28:19] seven years tribulation he talked to

[1:28:32] natural Israel and it falls upon the 144
[1:28:35] 000 the slipping virgins and things here
[1:28:37] are killed then these people natural
[1:28:40] Israel when they see the Covenant is

[1:28:44] seeing what he's done look around and
[1:28:46] said the Obama had to Rome

[1:30:07] millennial Reign right I know it's in
[1:30:10] Leviticus Now watch how it was dedicated
[1:30:13] to the business and we'll go back to the
[1:30:15] event because we find out Moses
[1:30:16] anointing the temple and going on
[1:30:18] through all right go to the next
[1:30:25] this is
[1:30:27] America 141 pull it up you know you can
[1:30:30] see that's tied with the temple now I
[1:30:32] came into the sanctuary that was to be
[1:30:34] anointed and was given over to him for
[1:30:36] the people to come to worship
[1:30:38] so to anoint not thy holy place would
[1:30:42] anoint the most holy place the
[1:30:45] Millennium Temple not a person right
[1:30:48] and we noticed that New Jerusalem is the
[1:30:50] most holy place
[1:30:52] and the anointing will be upon
[1:30:54] the New Jerusalem that descends out of
[1:30:57] God
[1:30:59] from heaven
[1:31:01] got out of heaven
[1:31:05] holy place
[1:31:08] the Jerusalem is the most holy place and
[1:31:10] the anointing will be upon us your
[1:31:13] natural
[1:31:15] now here's your spiritual
[1:31:17] and the anointing will be up on the New
[1:31:19] Jerusalem that sends us from going out
[1:31:21] of Heaven prepared as a brother going
[1:31:22] for her husband the anointing will be
[1:31:24] upon
[1:31:26] them
[1:31:28] we are the anointing to the temple amen
[1:31:31] that's right
[1:31:32] we come back in Revelations 19. right
[1:31:36] we go up in Revelations 4 1 come back in
[1:31:39] 19 as the anointing to the temple amen
[1:31:49] what's going to happen in that
[1:31:52] period of time here

[1:31:57] two witnesses will go up
[1:31:59] 144 000 go to Cleansing of the land
[1:32:03] the Jews will precede us here
[1:32:07] you see how many I don't know I know the
[1:32:09] 144 000 is coming but they're going to
[1:32:11] build a millennium Temple
[1:32:13] and I quote again not to offer
[1:32:15] sacrifices get that out of your mind
[1:32:18] Jesus Christ is our sacrifice but it'll
[1:32:21] be there to show it
[1:32:24] a temple to show it amen that we can go
[1:32:27] into that Temple right
[1:32:29] and we can worship the real God of the
[1:32:31] temple amen the Bible says the lamb will
[1:32:33] be not amen
[1:32:36] it's not dealing with trying to have
[1:32:38] times and dates and all it's a cleansing
[1:32:41] of the land getting ready and in the
[1:32:43] millennial rain comes they precede us
[1:32:46] here and build a temple
[1:32:49] now here's a question that would ask me

[1:33:04] and a half years then we got to come
[1:33:05] back to Millennium but I just proved to
[1:33:07] you could be seven years
[1:33:09] whether you believe it or not it just
[1:33:11] went that far sure 1300 something days
[1:33:14] even up to seven years

[1:33:48] ride he described the ride College of
[1:33:50] City read revelation 21-22
