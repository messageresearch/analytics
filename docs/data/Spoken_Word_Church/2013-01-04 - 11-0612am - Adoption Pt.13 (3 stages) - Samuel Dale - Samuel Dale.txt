in and things and all kind of services and things and if you want to send him any money be feel free to do so uh I'll give you the address Etc you can can take care of it all right I really appreciate the brother I thought he was a good brother really enjoyed you know his doing and evidently he must know a lot about us cuz the new brother pic was coming Thursday so maybe he's listening so that's good then we have a good time in the Lord okay Ephesians 1 verse vers three blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Christ according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love having predestinated us unto us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the Beloved in whom we have Redemption through his blood to forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace now I'm going to read a little bit more here wherein he had abounded toward us in all wisdom and Prudence now piled it on us amen right abounded piled it on to us having made known unto us the mystery what is the mystery to adopt us the prophet said the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he hath purposed in himself that in the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things were in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him all right now let's go to Romans what we're going to do today is just kind of like a review of what we've been talking of let's go to Romans 8 and let's start reading with you start with verse 14 let's start with verse 13 for if we live after the flesh for if ye live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify the Deeds of the body you shall live now for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God that's right for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry AB by father the spirit itself beareth witness with our spirit that we are the children of God and if children than ours ARS of God and Joint HS with Christ if so be that we suff suffer with him that we may be also glorified together right for I reckon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed were in us for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word as I said we're just going to kind of review this morning and uh you know just try to cover what we've been preaching on now for uh this is message number 13 on this about the uh adoption and we've been talking about adoption in three stages three stages that we've been talking about all right and in that you know the reason I chose to do that this morning and then this afternoon we'll pick up the and start on the third stage We have basically been dealing with the number one stage number two stage uh of adoption and I know a lot of times when I lay so much in and and I don't if you notice I do a lot of reviewing uh maybe because my mind is getting old you know and I read a lot review a lot but still I think it's needful for each one of us because you know sometimes we forget because a lot of people think a preacher is just one who they'll give you a shot sermon here a shot sermon there a shot sermon there and you don't know how to tie anything together and at the end of a month you know no more about it being tied together than you did when you started but I'm not that way and I'm sorry if I offend you or you know irk you a little bit by being slow and just gradually going and then review because you know a lot of times we forget well what did he say on message number two you know he said well go back and listen number two well I ain't got time to listen number two what did he say well let's just do a little bit of reviewing this morning and that way we can at least know where we are up to the P the position we're talking about all right and uh you know in doing that then we can can follow it better all right as I said we're trying to cover adoption in three stages because that way you can get a better understanding now before you go in your computer clicks and you your brain you know uh not necessarily them out there clicking but uh you know the brain and uh you know I know that brother brandham covers adoption and how he covers it cuz we've already covered it and you know and he basically says you know like position in Christ he'll bring it out and he'll say now your birth is not not your adoption right the your adoption is your placing all right now that's true wonderful we believe that we we follow that that's what we're talking about all right but we're also talking about how that Paul here in Romans see he's covering it to the basis that he says that as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God now how did we become the children of God Amen oh I was born of this eternal seed in me I always was a Son of God I okay go believe what you want to that's your problem that's your Jo your doings you know but I'm just just oldfashioned enough to believe that you and I were born in sin shaping in iniquity espoused my mother's wound and went forth a liar amen right and that being lost and doomed and on our way to hell right and the prophet of God saying that he was a h he was a hybrid Y and that being because of the sin in the garden any of these statements I make send me a note I'll be glad to send them to you H and in the there in the fall that happened in the garden that brought us into Satan's domain and made us skin folks to the devil you may think you're worth something but you're worth about probably three bucks right now maybe the cost of living up enough used to be a dollar or something but you know enough pot a and petroleum and this that and the other you you really you know this morning you really stood in front of the mirror you know and you you fixed up everything but just remember you're just a a bag of dirt and that's you know and God's not dealing with that bag of dirt very much that's why he's going to change it one day but you know not get a new one cuz we don't believe in that we believe in this body being redeemed Jesus had nail prints in his hands when he raised so my worry about the other a lot of people believe you're going to get a new body it's this body made new you got quotes from brother brandom said new body that's a fine you got different kind of quotes but that's what I'm giving you like adoption he'll give you a statement in one message that will say your birth is not your adoption right your adoption is your placing right all right see now he's giving you an understanding of what he's talking about right see for the the time and the doing so is it throughout the message all right now but see we know then that in the natural story of adoption that we adopt other people's children you know we we we adopt other you know kids that don't belong to us they were not born to us Etc but in the Old Testament as the prophet would be using it uh the the children of Israel they took the adoption actually uh and you might not like this but it is a was really a Roman custom or one of the back before then and they inherited it into to their doings and they started adopting their children all right see because that would be uh you know in other words it wasn't that God looked down and said hey I like that I put it in the word no I was already in the word right it just somebody else coming along maybe before and and and uh coming up with something and and they inherited the thing of adopting their own children and when they get to be about 12 13 16 whatever age you want to make if you go ahead they have the bar MIT some way you pronounce that big old word and you have that and they adopted into the family a child that was born into the family that's right all right see and that's the natural story of adoption right all right the Jews in the natural would adopt their own children and then give them the signate of authorities the things that would happen and the code of Many Colors All right but then taking that see you can't lay as I've tried to get you to see you can't lay everything on the natural and try to come over into the spiritual right because when you do you're going to run ground so in the spiritual part of it now see and the spiritual part we have to find a way to become the children of God right amen all right see because God ain't going to adopt it he ain't going to adopt the devil's kids he's going to adopt his own kids has the authority the positioning etc etc you know coming so he's not going to adopt the devil's children so we have to find a way to become God's children how do we do that by the new birth right see then we're born again by the the new birth bringing us into the family of God as the children of God see all right now that new birth then makes us a child of God Amen but Paul in explaining to the Galatians that a son even though he's born a son he's no different than a servant he's a he's typing from the Old Testament or the use of the adoption by the children of Israel and bringing it over though into a new testament understanding amen and and you know and he's talking to the Galatians well the Bible's not written to a sinner it's written to Christians those that are in Christ all right so then he was telling the Galatians that they were born again by the new birth amen but that they needed to come and grow up the stature of a perfect man as Peter would bring out in his teachings because I believe they had those things the the 120 in the upper room came forth with what would be known as the faith of the fathers and as they did then they were the ones to use to teach others and then as like Paul Etc one coming along Paul especially would talk about him he comes in he gets the new birth well he doesn't get the new birth and it were like the disciples did right if you say he did you got a problem you got to get the sewing of the seed right right he got his eyes blinded his eyes were open he received a new birth he goes to the backs side of the desert for three and A2 years right and then he comes out preaching the same thing the rest of them did why God opened his eyes cuz he was a prophet right all right but he show him the grace and he was standing then with the faith of the fathers because Peter would say even that Paul said things hard to be understood all right and they talked about this adoption this bringing into the family right all right and then Paul as I said writing in Romans he starts out telling them that you're the children of God your new birth makes you a child of God Amen all right but it only makes you a baby right there Desiring the sincere milk of the word it's just the earnest of our inheritance are we in the scriptures that's right see and then when it is we must grow in Grace and knowledge up the stature of a perfect man to come back where the disciples were all right and then knowing that the disciples never received the headstone cuz your Prophet said it hadn't come yet right so if you want to believe that that's all right if you don't everybody else thinks oh this and was adopted that was adopted they were for the time that were in right it's like the prophet of God said outside of this day there was not a time for the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God direct quote amen but Paul and Peter and them were the manifested sons and daughters of God for their age amen but he's talking about adoption coming to the end time to bring us to a position we'll get this evening to whip right the Redemption of the body that's right all right now I'll go ahead and tell you and you know it cuz you've heard heard me over and over say it I'm not concerned about the Redemption of the body right the change yeah right or go by the grave come up I'm not concerned about that because that's not what the Bible's talking about right the Bible's talking about to it to understand right about the Redemption of the body right amen all right so that's where we're headed to is to have an understanding amen and this day is the only day we can have one because that's the hour that we're living all right that's right but see we become a child by the new birth amen all right then we grow in Grace and knowledge in that new birth until we come to the place see to where that God can use us and we covered how that the adoption is in three stages because the Lord Jesus went through the stages we were comparing what he went through as to what we go through correct all right see brother brandom talks about how that Jesus on the River Jordan and all he was identified as a child of God Amen all right but Dar you only hear this is this is my son in whom I'm pleased to dwell right all right cuz that was the beginning that was an example to you and I he did not need the new birth that's right am to make him a child of God he was born God Amen all right but he was going through that for you and I that's right right Amen to where we could come through those stages see all right so P one he was identified this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell amen all right see then we we we like to make things applied to him or something but not to us because we we have problems seemingly saying that when we receive the new birth you realize God is saing I'm pleased to dwell amen that's right he's identifying you by giving you the new birth that's right he's identifying you as a child of God he pleased to dwell in you am maybe not like he wants to I'll agree with that now but still that ain't got nothing to do with it you know no matter how mean our kids get we're still their kids right right I've never disowned one one of the kids yet you know what have said yet but you know but see you don't have to worry about it they are children and no matter what they would ever do they are children and that's why the prophet of God would cover it then that using the Old Testament example that if that child never came to a position to be able to be trusted he was never adopted into the family but it didn't mean he was pushed away from the eating table right it didn't mean he was thrown out you know and left home right no you know no see you don't carry you type too far right he wasn't throw away just because he was a child he still ateed the father's table he still had his inheritance as we read here see even Jacob and what is Jacob and Esau they both had an inheritance right Jacob just wanted to birth right amen see and he could get a double portion on those forms but the thing of what I'm saying he says in verse 15 that we've received the spirit not the spirit of bondage again under fear but we've received the spirit of adoption amen the new birth is the spirit of adoption to adopt us into the family of God right all right but that doesn't positionally Place us that's right that just identifies Us in the body as the children of God all right Sons and Daughters of the Living God to grow in Grace and knowledge then being born again as the scripture would say all right but see the Lord Jesus had a identification time River Jordan where he was identified amen but then on the Mount of transfiguration as we were bringing the other night see then you hear hear him say this is my beloved Son in whom I'm pleased to dwell hear ye him amen Matthew 17 see he was adopted into the family all right now here's where that we we mened a lot too as I tried to explain there you look at the ministry of the Lord Jesus right and in his early Ministry there were great signs and wonders but in the life's part of his Ministry when he came to Authority he's going to Calvary that's right right mhm very little happens from there amen but a wonderful thing does happen he goes to Matthew 24 and preaches those seals right all right we compared it with brother brandom's ministry right right brother random you can argue all you want to about where he was adopted at I believe he was adopted there in Arizona in ' 63 when the Angels come down you can argue the point I'm not arguing with nobody because I ain't got time I'm a preacher of the Gospel not argue the gospel all right and see then whatever you say we all would have to agree he did come to adoption somewhere all right so then not you wor about the point where you argue about it all right but see brother randam then once he comes through he's got a great ministry 500,000 people 300,000 people great signs and wonders are happening all kind of healings the dead raised the sick healed all kind of speaking the word but then when he comes to Arizona and no seals is preached he said I'll lose thousands of my friends y he wound up preaching to 30 people in a trailer out there in Arizona y I know the meetings he had meetings of pretty good size but you know what I'm talking about that's right once he came to the position of what we call the third pool yeah then it seemed to be a whole lot less about taking place right see it don't look right does it I say that because I don't want us to get a thing of looking at adoption and headstone and things like that it's so high until nobody can find it or never reach it well let's don't make it so easy till everybody in the world just stumbles into it listening to brother the other day preaching about it and the thing Brother Richard but anyhow you know people come in the message in 3 months they know all about the seals yeah mhm you know why cuz they read the book yeah boy that's a lot they they they know all about the message in 3 months they straighten everybody else out they send the message been in it for 40 years but they straighten You Out Boy because they're they're they're well that's all right I'm not trying to straighten nobody out but me that's right I'm the only gu I'm trying to straighten out now if you reap the benefits from it and let it straighten you out that's fine I'm just working on me cuz that's the only one I can work on I'm not going to beat you to death right like most of the preachers do about you hire you dress you clothes or this or that or the other and never preach the truth I'm going to preach the word and let the word deliver and then if you're a hypocrite if you don't do what the word says that's where brother Dale gets plain when he says things but you're just a plain old hypocrite that's right you go out and cut your heart and do these things sisters then you just prove you're lost right ain't no need to playing that's right you're lost amen he going get saved amen and then it'll automatically take care of itself that's right see that's the way brother preaches but I know I'm not understood about that but but now listen see the Lord Jesus came to a place of authority manifestation Authority his name was just as good on the checkbook as his father's right brother R said God gives you when you are born again Christian he said he gives you a check you got the checkbook you know you got everything in Jesus's name is signed at the bottom right so whatever you need you just sign your name y I mean you don't sign you just fill in what you need then the next step is what your names is good on the checkbook then he gives you where you can spill in what you need and sign your own name amen now that was a prophet's definition of showing us Grace and knowledge our growth development our child training righten see coming up through the the statue of a perfect man that's right and coming out to show us Jesus Christ Living in you CU remember now what was our one thought that we kept making and kept emphasizing and we'll keep emphasizing in your natural adoption to Father har as a tutor right which is not related to maybe or something but he hires a tutor but not so in the spiritual the end is spiritual right brother R said the Holy Ghost is your tutor well now the Holy Ghost and the fathers the self-sign spirit are Jesus had two daddies now I'm quoting brother R so now the Holy Ghost and the father is a selfs sameed Spirit then the tutor came into you at the new birth which is the holy spirit right which is the spirit of almighty God Amen brother BR says you have in you by the new birth what Father Son and Holy Ghost right it's not that you got a father to doing this a little bit and a son doing this and the Holy Ghost doing this and no that's only for breaking it down for dispensational understandings that's right but see the tutor is the holy spirit which is the spirit of the father so when this doing the father is inside of you and I right so what what I always taught you about adoption most people think adoption is the father leaving the scene and the son coming on the scene you know I've never agreed with that I don't believe it in spiritual adoption that's natural adoption all right but in spiritual adoption right or in the body of Christ it's the father coming on the scene in his children because that's what Jesus was right Jesus was God made manifest in human flesh right you agree the father made manifest in flesh well you ain't nothing but Oneness well all right all right what do you Tess or Tresses or whatever let's get all the NES out of the way and go on forget it but listen Jesus had a river Jordan that's right identification brother random had a time of identification Jesus had a amount of transfiguration experience brother random had a amount of transfiguration experience you and I must have the same thing that's right we must have a a river Jordan experience of the new birth to bring us in to make us the children of God The Offspring of God as Paul would call it and then we must grow in Grace and knowledge till we come to the work that we can have the authority invest Ed into us it's like we come into message we've been there and this brother had been in up the church first church we were in you know and boy he'd get up you know he'd heard brother random and he'd get up and he'd say I take every spirit in here under my control I thought but you sure made a chenge right yeah CU that's brother random didn't do that in his early Ministry it took him a while before he ever come to the position of saying I take everything in here under my control he knew that angel was standing there there a reason he could do it that's right it wasn't him anyway was it it was Christ all right but you understand now see but then what we've got to do see is we've got to come to the third stage of it which will be the completion or the finishing of the Redemption of the body and we'll get on it this afternoon to cover you know where we're at but to just look at it see full sunship comes into existence at Mount of transfiguration all right now full sunship came into existence matter of transfiguration okay then he goes from there straight to Calvary as I said very little preaching done but the greatest of all he preached those seals in Matthew 24 right on his way to Calvary all right so have we understood the seals that's right I thought the seals was to revealed a complete Plan of Redemption amen right is that right amen so that it would mean Body Spirit and soul right am see this Prophet come to do something that none of the rest of him couldn't do Paul could tell you about a change of the body right but he never attained it that's right he can tell you how you change the moment twinkle of an ey right but he never attained unto it right but somebody's going to have to attain to it right see even brother Bram didn't attain them to it right right see so they're waiting on you and I Amen to reach a position see to where that we can see that we are the children of God Amen all now I just gave you some quotes because I know that in preaching a lot of times I just jump across something and and I've tried to make the emphasis of the three stages of Grace or the three stages of adoption in the basis of showing you that it's just a deeper one because really I I don't believe in three stages I don't believe in three works of Grace right you say wait miss a minute no I don't believe in three works of Grace I believe in three stages of Grace right cuz if you call it works you got a problem right three stages justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost right three stages of your new birth all right now justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit so it stages of the same thing so is your adoption you're adopted into the family of God by the new birth you become HS joint AES amen that's right you don't have to grow up to become a joint air that's why Paul calls it in Galatians say though he be heir of all right amen read Galatians 4 there though he become air of all but yet he's like a servant right now that's what I said now we we take that as the wrong way and that's why I tried to emphasize the the Lord Jesus and the great ministry and the brother around him in the great ministry that he had and then seemingly at the end of it when it gets toward the opening of the word more that it seems to taper off but as I said now remember a child is born into the family Paul is not not saying that he's a servant now you ever been up to um builtmore house all right those were built in slave days and things you know kind of in that order and they had a brown laundry and then a white laundry now you know the difference right the white laundry was for the owners and the people but they had a brown laundry which was for the slaves are the people who are workers all right so now don't get that kind of an idea about being born into the family of God right well I'm no different than a slave that's not what Paul is saying slaves don't eat at the master's table right right slaves eat at their own meals brother Brady used to tickle me to death when he used were talking about over there and helping and cooking and doing the thing for that Queen and he said there we was cooking that Queen's old dog of steak and we was having to eat what we could and he finally got even with the dog yeah cuz the dog killed some chickens and he killed the dog but the point I'm trying to get you to see if you're a child of God glory amen that's right you know God hears babies more than he hears Grownups Come on righten mhm you remember when your baby was born why you just ever little thing ever moved why you honey you let me let me you let me do this let me do that no don't fall down now let me hold you up you know let me take care of you while you say listen get up and walk I ain't taking care of you all your life then one day you come to the point and say hey get you a job you go to work for a living make some money see it don't sound right does it right and that's the way God raises his children children that's right see he tutors us but yet still remember we're join ours if you're just born again today if you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost today you're join ours with Jesus Christ amen I know the great brother up you he preaches you know the two Lord's message and he said that Jesus was just half god well I'd be satisfied with being a half God yeah cuz that's a whole lot better than no God right that's right m you know but the brother ain't right the Bible's telling you right amen you're join ours amen if Jesus was almighty God right then whatever he has I have just by the new birth that's right you don't have to wait till authority of adoptions and all this that the other see that's what people get it in their mind well a no one got nothing so we just sit down and wait on the bus to pull up well just make sure you're at the bus depot you remember the story I told you brother P he came in you know and he's got these thing down man he can tell you every time you move and he can tell youever bus that goes from what town to what town cuz that's the way they travel over there and he came in one day and we talking about and he said you got to take me to the bus depot I said brother because Cas they ain't no bus depot in gang I took it to Athens a couple of times cuz I knew where the bus depot was in Athens and he said no there one in Gainesville I said Don sir it used to be down at the train station well it was the bus depot and the station was the same place I said no no we got to go to Athens he said you don't have to go there he said D this number right here and find out I di the number I said this a bus depot and game yes I said where's it at you used to be down at the train station he said no sir we're no longer there he said you know where the tractor place is forgot what the name of Holland tractor PE mon tractor and I said yes sir he said there's the bus depot brother Cas said I told you but my point is listen as babies children we can cry out to our father and he heals us and delivers us and guides us it's not what growth development healings and things are not based upon growth development healing is based upon the basis of whether or not you can believe it see all right but we're born into the family of God by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then we can expect to come and then and then only can we expect to come to a position of authority you know but see I just want you to read some of the things because I'm saying now listen here's my point uh I kind of with background a little bit but here's the point of what I want you to see is we we look at authorities we look at adoption and we just place it at one's spot all right and here I'm over there you know if I can never get that Yeah Boy things going to happen we first come into message Morey people would say you know they say boy one of these days won't be able to speak that word I made a simple statement then it I still make I said we got to get the word before we can speak the word plain language that was my point then that's my point now amen that's why in the Bible you do not see a novice writing the scripture right right amen you don't see a babe in Christ writing the Bible it's those who are tutored in the gospel that writes the Bible see because you can't trust a baby and and all cuz he blabbered too much all right but now I want us to just read some things and I want us to to not try to destroy in our mind a thought but keep a thought in our mind that there is an adoption to be reached there's a position to be reached right there's a place to be reached that Authority comes into position right and as it comes into position then we can see and expect things to take place in a greater development than we do as when we're just babies in Christ but I don't want us to forget the point that we're born into the family of God and that is God adopting us into his family that's why Paul calls it Romans um 15 8:15 calls it the spirit of adoption because it's the new M then he goes on down to the 19th verse and talking about the Sons and Daughters of God the manifestation of the Sons and Daughters of God that the whole world is groaning waiting now the Bible doesn't tell you that the world is waiting for babies to be born that's right babies in Christ it doesn't say that it's waiting for sunship right to reach a position I even read you all the other translations off of that you know where that they would say this the the right of sunship and they they they kept the point of of all the translators kept the point of this adoption to to run into the right place but I don't want you to forget that when brother Brandon says we have something now yeah now here's the way it goes you know now well what that means brother Dale he had it nobody else didn't have it now well I I kind of like just believe what he says blessing but I understand the full story too and I've tried to express it to you just now we're not making this thing so easy until you can come in the body of Christ today and stumble into it and and be so up at The Headstone and gone out of here right I've never looked at nothing like that you say well what about some people might come in right sure but they're linked to you and I right God can Quicken the word in a hurry to somebody true he quickened the disciples they had 100 they had uh 3 and 1/2 years of ministry he quickened them they had to Faith of the fathers right he opened their understanding of the scriptures that didn't give the new birth read your Bible he opened a road to a mess he opened the understanding of the two going to a mess he opened the understanding of those that was was you know the disciples when they gathered at hisory with and in doing that when he opened their understanding that didn't give them the new birth right they still had to wait until Calvary was you know the phix of Calvary for theirselves dying out to theirselves enough and going to the upper room to receive you know and the day of Pentecost coming all right so now we don't do that either so I want you to look at some of the things the prophet said but notice what he's talking about he's talking about something already in existence do you see that that's where people are not looking at it right we're looking at it that one day we're going to come instead of looking at what is right well I tell you though if we was you know if you had what you think then you could just come and deliver me if you got what you think you got come on come on that's it I accept my part of it I'll be glad to pray the prayer of faith right lay hands on you do anything you want to but the healing is in you amen it's not in me right Jesus said I can't do nothing except my father shows me that's right right all right see don't blame everybody else for our unbelief amen let's accept what we've got and then move on with it all right right now watch what he starts telling us how that you're adopted into the body of Christ right see now get to point now spiritual adoption the new birth into the body of Christ by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then we talk about adoption coming to where you're predestinated unto adoption right you know that everybody in the Bible was not predestinated unto adoption right or else Paul wouldn't have said that that's right in Ephesians he said predestinated to adoption the prophet said that's this end time people is the ones that's predestinate you remember there's a word or seed to be made Alive by every age but this is the age for all of the word to be made alive amen all right now listen to what he's saying in Christ 1955 2:21 in Phoenix and through the blood you become part of him and through the same cell that he came out of now what and the Very presence and part of God comes into you now that's pretty it's pretty good is it I like that into the same cell that he came out of now that's not talking about blood right I'm talking about spiritual condition amen the very presence and part of God that comes part of God comes into you by faith you purchase it and that same holy spirit that was in the Lord Jesus Christ comes into you and then you are Sons and Daughters of God adopt by the Lord Jesus Christ into the body of Christ amen right Hallelujah when you receive the new birth you're adopted into the family of Christ amen the same life that was in him right is then in you amen as a baby yes but it's there DNA and the natural provise whether you're children or not right H DNA and the spiritual what you do with the word where I think Pentecost failed 1955 1111 oh he's real adopted by the father into the fellowship and into the body of Believers by the Holy Ghost right and a Vindicated Ministry Pro it you don't have to talk so much about it God does his own talking right let see into the body of Believers you said well that's only when it comes to the final adoption it's all right I like what he go I love to read this so let's read it now if we have went to seeking the give if we had have went to seeking the giver instead of the gifts now listen to it I believe the church would have been further up the road don't you think so if we stayed close to God and loved him and just kept living for him and not trying to push things over just live for God and live a pure holy life and live and pray every day keep yourself refreshed in his presence God will take care of the rest of it I like that cuz you see that's what I've always tried to get you to see if I have the giver I have all gifts right that's right but I can have gifts without having to give her right y right Satan can pass out Supernatural gifts that's what your Prophet said the gifts and callings are without repentance right that's what the Bible says right amen but you see if we just sought the giver instead of the gifts right right all right that's all I've ever tried to do now just do what you want to with the wording the way I say it come let us reason together 1955 10:04 now but we are sons of God like he was but adopted sons of God by his grace watch by the death of Jesus God's son brings us into relationship to God now then God with his adopted sons has said in the church some Apostles prophets evangelist brother Rand can talk about adoption and talking about a new birth see when you mention adoption to people in this message just wh wh through you know going on up I believe you're born into the family of God I believe you're adopted into the family of God right by the new birth souls in prison 1963 1110 the morning service look down to what's underline you read the rest of it I just give you that to save time there's three offices of one God there three attributes of the same God you're a part of God and I'm a part of God but I'm not all of God and neither are you all of God see see it's attributes of God upon us as the sons adopted by Jesus Christ which God himself become flesh to Die For Us raising jer's daughter 1956 731 talking about the Dove and all and how they've come together the lamb was one creature the dve was another now he's manifested in your flesh by being adopted sons and daughters to the kingdom of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's right and you become joint ours with the Lord Jesus Christ oh Church you got the power if you got the faith to use it with see but if you make everything a way up here see way up there him and then how are you going to get up there that's why I said three stages justification takes a holy spirit to justify you takes a holy spirit to sanctify takes the Holy Spirit to give you new birth that's right the Holy Spirit comes in a new birth and gives you adoption into the family of God making you a child of God air of all things but yet we're under the tutor which is the holy spirit until the training time comes the second stage Authority then we can talk about the Redemption of the body but listen you got a lot more them I just won't fool with it cuz I'm not trying to prove a point other than one thing you go ahead and read them I believe that we're adopted into the family of God by the new birth but then we must grow in Grace and knowledge amen it took the prophet 30 years 33 I think it was to preach the statute of perfect man now that's what he said y he said I've been all these years in 30 years something years and we've been 40 something years since the prophet left the scene and people are going haywired or we don't know what to do we don't know what's going on we don't have n we don't have this we don't have that and then somebody jumps up and gets a little thing started especially a young Minister he jumps up and he starts running real good with it and get a little move going among the people and everybody just flocks after him he trying to find something well I thought my tutor was inside of me that's right I enjoy all of those things too but like I've always said leave them alone I don't need arguing with them F would leave alone they'll run their course and when they run their course they'll settle down and become good Sons and Daughters of god good preachers if not they're go on off in the garbage skins right right so don't worry about it see for 40 something years I tried to get you to see who you are right you are a child of God Amen by the new birth right you know what would be the biggest shame and disgrace for them to ask me for run to run for president of the United States that'd be a shame and a disgrace y that's right cuz I'd have to step down as a preacher a pastor y to become president now I'd give up the greatest office there is in the world to take this cheapest garbage can boy you don't no I ain't got no problem with Obama he done this as good M would have done no different I told you that you can argue all you want to about this that or the other not doing it my Bible says God puts in Kings and takes out Kings right that's right straight last time I voted was John F Kennedy I found out he was a Catholic and I had put him in the office I ain't voted since then you vote do what you want to I'm just telling you cuz I'm not trying to be no lordship of nothing I'm just telling you how I am right but you see it wouldn't make no difference who they put in the White House brother Brown said put a George Washington and Abraham Lincoln and there office still go amen is that what he said he said you couldn't pull it out no right now look like we couldn't all you can't because it's doomed for that right right amen enjoy what we can while we're here righten right cuz the money in your pocket can be your doom that's right amen what the prophet say keep you home yep Belong To The World Council of churches or something like that or the Catholic Church y that's up to you that's up to me see we're going to have a time we're going to have to prove what we are right but if we're not the children of God sugar to get fed yep until we grow up yep into Sons and Daughters of a living God Amen and see that way God knows how to raise his children that's right he don't raise his children by pouring everything in the world on to him may I quote your Prophet he's talking about the tutor the Holy Spirit report to the father and said I made him sick he said I made him the life and stock of the community we got a good father but it's just hard sometimes to understand him right amen right sometimes it's hard why am I sick and everything else is everybody else is just going when we do that see then we're failing the test I got a funny way of doing things I know that I'm human but you know sometimes I get frustrated and aggravated or whatever but you know in a few minutes what I start doing I start laughing had something happened the other day in the old ring wouldn't stay on a key thing and well I just pull the thing off just throwed it down you walked out in the yard and now I didn't get no shovel no difference in it I walk out in yard and things are dropping all over the place and I'm just my goodness I can't even hold on to nothing you know a few minutes I start just dying laughing I did if You' seen me you thought what in the world that crazy not doing I just dying laugh cuz hey you fail the test what is the work we say you got to take it again that's growth development you got to take the test again so you might as well life and get ready for the test right am see things are going to go wrong and our father allows it he said he would allow someone to say something to you to see how you would react right I gave you the story about it you know remember the the man when brother around and spoke to sister had right and said you know about the squirrels and the things and he had shot that squirrel and couldn't find it and that brother prayed that night said now now Lord show that brother Ram's right said let him find that squirrel boy everybody brother r everybody read the message everybody was upset with him but when they asked him about it later he didn't realize he prayed that way God knows how to train his children he knows how to train that Prophet right he knows how to train me and you child training but what does it come out to be thank Lord See You and I by the opening of the word now this is what I've taught you right since about 1980 I've taught you one thing how do we grow up the stature of a perfect man how do we have faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience Godly brother well I got to have it so I just have it and that don't work does it right it's by the opening of the word amen right amen amen that's all I've ever tried to preach to you then the word where you can make a choice amen right now the opening of the word as I said the other day the Lord Jesus preached six seals on his way to Calvary brother brandham preached six sealed on his way to rejection by mankind right why is the people so scared of the seals in the Daniel 70 weeks and the thing when he said in the Daniel 70 weeks if you don't understand this you'll miss it in the seals but yet nobody wants to know anything about those things that's right but that's the things that I've tried to break down to you to where at least to give you a choice of whether you could hear the both sides of the story or nothing else right what the prop had to say cuz you see it's not I'll bring it this evening we'll get into it it's not the Redemption of the body see that's this that's where you're looking at it well one of these days I'll be adopted I I'll step in that new body well we got to get there right see it right there because the Lord Jesus Christ went to man of transfiguration and the next 6 months was the most horrible times of his life you agree amen 6 months 3 months whatever you want to make it you know what I'm talking about amen when he left Mount of transfiguration he's headed straight to Calvary The Garden of Gethsemane death to himself yielding up all that he had brother brandom comes along and follows the same line right because of this on the seventh seal he said thousands of my friends Rel me well don't you think you and I going to go through the same thing I've never believed in it and I never taught you that the bride's going through the tribulation you know better I've never done it but I have taught you that we need persecution right asz a prophet says a church always does better under persecution now that's the words of your Prophet when you got a good foot big you know got a big old belly full a banana pudding you ain't interested in eating again right about 3 or 4 hours later you're want something to eat right they thank God for the rain we just received you remember what I said last Sunday somebody touch God right you know what I said I said it's not for me I said I've had my day I've Seen Rain Come and I've Seen Rain leave I've seen God move I don't ask him anymore that way sure I ask him for rain because we need it but I ask him to let me preach the gospel to where some of you can stand up and say I going to say it will get rain somebody touch God sir and we got a good rain so I want you to see God right I don't have to see him believe him right I've already seen more than the abundance of what most people will ever see but yet I want to see a bride right that will take God's word Y and put our little silly feelings in the city end of our Brites and take the britches and throw them away
