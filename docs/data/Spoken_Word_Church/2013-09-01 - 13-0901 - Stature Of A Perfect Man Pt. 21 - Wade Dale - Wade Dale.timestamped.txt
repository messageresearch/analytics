[0:00] problems
[0:01] with uh
[0:06] we're gonna finish up right here with uh
[0:09] 19 seconds huh maybe it will in a second
[0:13] now it's moving all right Hebrews 11.
[0:17] sometimes when you turn it on it takes
[0:18] about 10 seconds for the relay
[0:22] now we're going to talk about we're
[0:24] going to finish with faith today next
[0:25] Sunday we're going to talk about virtue
[0:27] so what I want you to do is is go on
[0:29] your computers and if you don't have a
[0:31] computer look in the back of your Bible
[0:32] if you have a Scofield bible but look up
[0:34] the word Virtue get the definition of
[0:36] the word Virtue and I want all of you to
[0:38] look up the word Virtue look in Webster
[0:40] dictionary look in Bible dictionary and
[0:42] let's see what we can get as far as a
[0:44] definition of virtue all right
[0:48] um
[0:49] and then what we're going to do is we're
[0:51] going to pick examples of virtue in the
[0:53] Bible first because the Bible is our
[0:56] example that's our first example that's
[0:58] the only example we should look at we
[1:00] shouldn't look at
[1:01] um you know Dave Ramsey first or James
[1:04] Dobson first or Kenneth Copeland first
[1:06] I'm naming names because you know you
[1:08] just don't want to do that first
[1:11] you want to go to the Bible First now
[1:13] these people reflect the Bible exactly
[1:16] then that's fine but if they don't let's
[1:18] take the Bible first and then let's see
[1:21] what virtue
[1:23] is because remember many people can have
[1:26] virtue
[1:28] you know there's people you just you
[1:30] don't like to be around and there's
[1:31] people you do like to be around
[1:32] Christian or non-Christian right okay
[1:35] the ones you like to be around is not
[1:38] just because they agree with everything
[1:39] you say it shouldn't be that's right it
[1:41] should be that you receive virtue or
[1:43] strength from what they say or what they
[1:45] do right that's why I always said and
[1:48] people think you know you well you're
[1:49] putting brother down on a pedestal but I
[1:52] wanted to have I wanted to act like him
[1:53] being have the same God he had with the
[1:55] same gods and me is in him it'll make us
[1:57] act the same we're not going to be
[1:59] exactly the same human wise but we're
[2:00] also we're definitely going to be the
[2:02] same as far as our Christian experience
[2:05] and our
[2:07] um the way God deals with us all right
[2:09] so that's virtue that's what you virtue
[2:12] is strength somebody you like to be
[2:14] around
[2:15] it's not that they like to hunt and you
[2:17] like to hunt that is just an added bonus
[2:19] but we're going to get into the real
[2:20] look of virtue what virtue is brother
[2:23] Ram said virtue is strength and you've
[2:26] got to have it
[2:28] in order to get it
[2:30] Jesus had it therefore the woman at the
[2:32] well
[2:33] Drew from me the woman with the bloody
[2:36] shoe Drew from it uh the man at the gate
[2:39] beautiful Drew from Peter that's where
[2:41] virtue came that's one of the to me
[2:43] that's one of the most important
[2:44] scriptures as far as virtue Peter said
[2:47] Silver and Gold Have I None
[2:49] I can't buy you a doctor's visit
[2:52] I can't pay for your hospital stay
[2:55] but such as I have
[2:57] so he had a virtue he had to or he
[2:59] wouldn't have been able to pin it in
[3:00] second Peter right he had to have it
[3:03] before he could get it right so that's
[3:05] where we want to look and see that but
[3:07] today I want to read a few things you
[3:09] know we went by faith these people but
[3:11] watch verse eight of Hebrews 11 because
[3:16] that is the father of our faith which
[3:19] was Abraham
[3:20] all right Abraham looking looking in
[3:22] Abraham's Journey you say well my and he
[3:25] wouldn't be my choice
[3:27] well thank God you're not God
[3:30] because when Peter or Paul wrote about
[3:32] him the Bible the Bible says in
[3:35] in there in Romans that he was strong in
[3:37] faith why because Abraham just got up
[3:40] lived an everyday life but he always had
[3:44] a testimony that he was going to have
[3:46] that child
[3:48] that was his testimony that's the same
[3:50] way with you and I he said by faith
[3:52] Abraham when he was called to go out
[3:54] into a place which he should after
[3:56] receiving for an inheritance
[3:58] I underlined that next word
[4:01] obey
[4:04] he obeyed what God Said
[4:07] that is our problem we do not obey what
[4:11] God said everything okay that's why the
[4:14] statue of perfect man helps you invert
[4:16] you to obey God knowledge helps you to
[4:18] obey God Temperance helps you to obey
[4:20] God and then you get all the way up
[4:22] there to love him we're going to talk
[4:23] about something a long time from now
[4:24] probably is that you're going to be God
[4:29] May manifest in another form all right
[4:32] that's what I was telling about in
[4:34] Kansas this past weekend there's a
[4:37] um and I don't know if y'all knew that
[4:39] but when I was I was out there in
[4:41] January it was just dry and they had
[4:43] been going through a grout
[4:45] trees were dying their homes were so dry
[4:49] until they was having to wash down their
[4:51] foundations to keep the ground from
[4:52] cracking so far away from their house I
[4:55] mean they were like in a parts Wasteland
[4:57] and I was driving to church and I saw
[4:59] all that and when I come to church there
[5:03] that Sunday and just real heavy on my
[5:05] heart
[5:06] and I told him I said
[5:09] I know you're having a drought I said
[5:11] let's pray so we pray
[5:14] and I just prayed a simple prayer that
[5:15] the Lord would give him one of the
[5:17] wettest brains that they've had in
[5:19] recent history and to get them out of
[5:21] the drought well
[5:23] make a long story short
[5:25] they had the wettest spring
[5:28] it started by two weeks after I left
[5:31] they had 17 inches of snow and before
[5:33] that got off the ground they had about
[5:34] 12 more inches of snow then they had
[5:36] another one more snow than it had since
[5:38] the 60s well now you know as well as I
[5:40] do
[5:41] snow does more for a drought than
[5:44] anything because it really gets down in
[5:46] the soil loosens up the soil so when it
[5:48] does rain it will you know help the
[5:51] crops and Help The Help the soil
[5:55] so then come springtime brother Jim
[5:59] pinston kept sending me text messages he
[6:02] said you can stop praying now
[6:05] he said wearing a deluge our rivers are
[6:10] overflowing our our I can't remember the
[6:13] lake it starts with the sea it was like
[6:16] 18 feet below full pool now it's that
[6:19] full pool so they've had enough rain to
[6:22] fill up 18 feet of water in this in this
[6:25] Reservoir so then he keeps sending it
[6:27] again I sent him a text back and I said
[6:29] look I said the Bible says I hear a
[6:31] sound of abundance of rain
[6:34] well about a week later he sent me
[6:36] another message he'd ring like four
[6:38] inches that week
[6:40] and he said we have now the abundance of
[6:42] rain
[6:43] so you can stop praying well when I got
[6:45] out there I told him I said I never
[6:46] prayed for one prayer I didn't keep
[6:48] praying I prayed one prayer and it just
[6:49] I just you know settled in my heart
[6:52] one of the sisters called Jim said I
[6:55] knew him brother Wade prayed that she
[6:57] was an old she was an old lady and or
[6:59] not an old lady but she's an older lady
[7:01] I'm not coach she doesn't see this bless
[7:03] her heart but his brother uh Chad's
[7:07] mother-in-law
[7:08] she said I'm you when he prayed that
[7:10] prayer that you that you had better take
[7:12] the saddle off your horse and put it
[7:13] under your wagon well that's an old
[7:15] saying for out there if it's starting to
[7:17] rain you don't want your saddle get wet
[7:18] so you can take it off and put it under
[7:19] the wagon so she said I knew we were in
[7:21] for you know all that so anyway they
[7:24] they're they're getting on me about it
[7:25] when I go out there you know
[7:27] and I said hey I said one prayer I said
[7:30] are you doing it but anyway make a long
[7:32] story short
[7:34] God and they said well we were praying
[7:37] also I said well it doesn't make me
[7:39] special it's just that it came on my
[7:40] heart it was just a burden like a heavy
[7:42] something was sitting on top of my
[7:44] shoulders you know for all the people in
[7:45] the and the plants and animals and and
[7:48] they were having trouble with their
[7:49] houses cracking and all that stuff and
[7:52] um
[7:53] we uh got to a place in the sermon and I
[7:56] said you know I said God wants us to be
[7:58] God God can send rain anytime he wants
[8:01] to right he's God he can do whatever he
[8:03] wants to but remember like Ronald's
[8:06] talking he predestinates by your desire
[8:10] he looks at your desire well the desire
[8:12] I had matched the desire they had right
[8:15] so God is not the one that called for
[8:17] rain hold on man God's not the one that
[8:19] just well I'm going to send the brain
[8:21] because they need it another had to be a
[8:23] connection
[8:24] God wanted us to be God ain't that what
[8:26] you know what Adam was Adam didn't have
[8:28] to ask God
[8:30] is it too cold is it too hot is it no
[8:33] brother Brown said Adam just said
[8:36] peace be still win pretty move over here
[8:39] and that's why because he wanted you to
[8:41] be gone and that's what God wants he
[8:44] wants us to be God
[8:47] is that too much he wants us to be gone
[8:51] because we are God made manifest in
[8:53] another form right that's right right
[8:54] when we get over there I believe when we
[8:56] get in that in that future home and we
[8:59] get living in that City the people
[9:01] outside that city is going to know one
[9:02] thing for sure
[9:04] God's living that City
[9:10] not just one Jesus
[9:13] but millions of little jesuses living in
[9:16] that City
[9:17] and they're going to know because see
[9:19] they don't have the understanding we do
[9:20] they need to receive a new birth they're
[9:22] not the family of God they have an
[9:26] impartation of eternal life
[9:28] which is true but they are not the
[9:31] children of God so they don't understand
[9:35] their daddy because he's not their dad
[9:37] but see he's our dad and we get to
[9:40] understand because
[9:42] we are Gods Bible equal says you're
[9:45] goddess
[9:47] this is what I say about Abraham watch
[9:50] what he's looking for it says obey and
[9:54] he went out not knowing whether he went
[9:57] now remember he was led by the Holy
[10:00] Ghost but he was not that he had no
[10:02] indwelling of the Holy Ghost
[10:04] to make him a born-again believer
[10:06] so he had to go by the things that he
[10:09] felt
[10:10] and saw and didn't see
[10:15] if he looked at circumstances
[10:18] guess what
[10:20] he would have failed
[10:22] but he did not look at circumstances we
[10:24] have got to stop looking at
[10:25] circumstances
[10:27] but he didn't know where he was going
[10:29] don't you watch reading on down here a
[10:32] little bit closer
[10:33] by faith he sojourned in the land of
[10:36] promise he was in the land that he was
[10:39] going to inherit he just didn't know it
[10:41] now that's the difference in me and you
[10:45] he received the promise as a natural
[10:47] promise of an actual son but in tight it
[10:52] was a promise
[10:53] of what Abraham you're going to inherit
[10:55] everywhere you go wherever the soul of
[10:57] your feet this is all going to be your
[10:58] inheritance
[11:00] um
[11:01] the Bible said he was looking for a city
[11:03] whose building makers God and he was
[11:05] walking on it the whole time he just did
[11:07] he didn't have a revelation because he
[11:08] didn't have the new birth he didn't have
[11:10] the Holy Ghost in his soul
[11:12] to lead him and guide him into all truth
[11:15] that's why when he would do what God
[11:18] says and then he would come over here
[11:19] and give his wife away or try to give
[11:21] her away twice and then he would take
[11:25] Hagar
[11:26] at the suggestion of his wife
[11:30] at the suggestion of his wife
[11:33] and have a child which was not a
[11:35] promised child God didn't tell him
[11:36] anything about that not one thing he'd
[11:38] tell him that he was going to give him
[11:40] anything with Hagar okay
[11:43] so he had a promise but he didn't know
[11:46] how to achieve it
[11:48] did I say that he he was walking in the
[11:51] land he didn't have a revelation because
[11:53] he didn't have
[11:54] that faith that you and I have which is
[11:56] the new birth
[11:58] because God promised once you give the
[12:00] new birth and he'd lead you and guide
[12:01] you into what all true
[12:03] all right so these people in the Old
[12:05] Testament they walked in faith believing
[12:08] that's why the Bible says and that's why
[12:10] brother brother Brown said he said every
[12:13] Prophet look to this day why because we
[12:15] have the new birth as an indwelling not
[12:19] just a not just anointing it comes on us
[12:21] and leaves us no
[12:23] wear what they were looking for
[12:26] that's why every Prophet spoke of this
[12:28] age every Prophet spoke of a bride every
[12:31] Prophet spoke of God being dwelling in a
[12:34] people not with the people all right so
[12:37] now watch this
[12:39] by faith he's so journey in the land of
[12:40] promise
[12:41] as in a strange country dwelling in
[12:44] Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The
[12:46] Heirs with him of the same promise for
[12:49] he looked for a city which had
[12:51] Foundation
[12:53] now watch our foundation Faith right
[12:57] whose building maker has got through
[13:00] faith now see not by faith but through
[13:03] faith
[13:04] Sarah
[13:06] also Sarah herself received strength to
[13:08] conceive seed see that's when their
[13:11] bodies will change
[13:13] excuse man was delivered of a child when
[13:15] she was past age because she judged him
[13:19] faithful who had promised
[13:23] she believed all right
[13:26] therefore sprained there even a one and
[13:29] him as good as dead how about Abraham so
[13:32] many as the stars of the sky multitude
[13:35] and as a sandwich is by the seashore
[13:37] innumerable
[13:39] here's Abraham 99 years old one day
[13:41] absolutely no way to fulfill that
[13:43] promise
[13:46] if you don't have kids you can't have a
[13:47] multiple children
[13:49] but out of one child
[13:52] Isaac the promised son out of that one
[13:54] child
[13:56] came as many as the stars of the sky and
[13:59] multitude
[14:00] and the sandwiches by the seashore
[14:02] innumerable
[14:04] listen to this in verse 13 what we're
[14:06] getting to
[14:08] these all died in faith not having
[14:11] received the promises
[14:14] now Scofield does a pretty good job here
[14:16] if you if you look in your footnote
[14:19] it says Genesis 3 15.
[14:23] I'll put MIT between in other words the
[14:26] speaking of the coming of Jesus Christ
[14:28] and him dying
[14:30] what to release the Holy Ghost
[14:34] but having seen them
[14:36] afar off
[14:39] hmm
[14:41] he saw them by faith you can see
[14:43] something
[14:45] but if it's not for you listen to this
[14:47] if it's not for you
[14:50] you'll miss it
[14:52] Abraham for an example he was looking
[14:55] for a city the city was right there he
[14:57] just it just wasn't revealed to him that
[14:59] he was walking on it but as the people
[15:01] came down through time and when Jesus
[15:03] came on Earth
[15:06] he said
[15:08] having a miracle passed away but my word
[15:10] will never pass away
[15:12] so in other words all the cities and all
[15:14] the things and they walked took to Jesus
[15:16] one day and said
[15:17] he said well what's going to happen he
[15:19] said well
[15:20] this Temple will be destroyed won't be
[15:22] one stone left upon another one this is
[15:24] some great Taj Mahal looking thing you
[15:26] know big huge Temple and they said won't
[15:29] be one stone and I said no but see he
[15:31] wasn't talking about a heavenly
[15:33] in other words he was saying all these
[15:34] kingdoms are going to be done away with
[15:36] and same with this all these kingdoms
[15:39] are going to be done away with these all
[15:41] died in faith not having received the
[15:43] promises but having seen them afar off
[15:48] and were persuaded of them
[15:52] look at that persuaded of them
[15:54] I believe Abraham once he did get a
[15:59] revelation for his time
[16:02] because it had to be revealed to him one
[16:04] day that that baby is now not coming
[16:08] it's now all right especially when you
[16:10] wake up one morning and your wife was 98
[16:13] the day before and she's 20 the next day
[16:14] Hallelujah
[16:17] what a what up
[16:22] for all times wow
[16:24] but you know what
[16:26] it still took
[16:28] both of them to produce that child
[16:32] didn't change Abraham and not Sarah
[16:36] the bride's got to be changed Christ
[16:38] took a body change
[16:40] and Calvary I mean at the resurrection
[16:42] right so he's waiting on his wife
[16:47] he's waiting on his wife
[16:50] to take a body change
[16:52] so that we'll have a body like into his
[16:54] glorious body his body's 20 years old
[16:57] his body's not old his body's not 30 or
[17:00] 50 or what it was on the earth that's
[17:03] why Mary Magdalene a great Revelation
[17:05] she thought he was a gardener what some
[17:08] young kid
[17:09] but when he spoke
[17:11] you knew that voice
[17:13] and she said my Lord so she knew who he
[17:16] was then but when she turned and looked
[17:18] at him she'd never seen him at 20 years
[17:19] old so he was a little young guy and
[17:21] she's like well who's this young kid
[17:23] right here
[17:24] but see she had a revelation I believe
[17:27] when he spoke she said something
[17:30] happened
[17:32] see she responded to the word
[17:34] the word which is the word she responded
[17:36] to the word and she saw that he's been
[17:39] changed
[17:42] so that's what we're right now we're
[17:43] God's waiting on now for his bride
[17:46] to be changed so we can get out of here
[17:48] all right so these all died in faith
[17:52] now not with faith they shouldn't have
[17:54] but they died in faith
[17:56] into faith for their time they died not
[17:59] having received the promises but having
[18:01] seen them afar off and were persuaded
[18:04] because remember who was that that said
[18:05] somebody said Abraham looked for a city
[18:07] whose building maker was God but he
[18:10] longed for that City but he never saw it
[18:13] physically
[18:15] but you and I
[18:16] are walking in it right now all right
[18:20] and embrace them
[18:22] and confessed that they were strangers
[18:25] and pilgrims on the Earth
[18:28] listen to this for they that say such
[18:30] things declare plainly that they seek
[18:33] the country
[18:35] and truly
[18:38] hmm look at this
[18:41] and truly if they had been mindful of
[18:45] that country
[18:47] what not not not the land of Canaan or
[18:50] the land that country that promise
[18:55] from which they came out
[18:58] they might have had opportunity to have
[19:00] returned
[19:02] Jesus said I come from God
[19:06] I go back to God
[19:07] you and I can say the same thing through
[19:09] faith through revelation we come from
[19:13] God and we're going right back to God
[19:15] all right so that's our
[19:18] City
[19:20] all right we're gonna live in a physical
[19:22] City but we have now possessed the enemy
[19:25] right now it's because we're living in a
[19:28] human body that the enemy that the enemy
[19:31] has
[19:32] a hold on
[19:34] this day
[19:36] but the city's down inside and there's
[19:38] no way the Satan can take it from you if
[19:40] you're born again
[19:43] whose building maker is God okay
[19:46] talking about the new birth
[19:49] they might have opportunity to have
[19:51] returned
[19:52] but now they desire a better country
[19:57] that is and heavenly
[20:00] wherefore God is not ashamed to be
[20:02] called their God
[20:06] for he has prepared for them
[20:09] a city
[20:12] Jesus said in John 14 he said I go away
[20:15] and what I prepare a place a city
[20:20] we know that's the future of home but we
[20:22] also know that he went to prepare a
[20:24] place to come back into me and you
[20:26] that's what he was preparing he was
[20:28] preparing those disciples he compared
[20:30] the 120 in the upper room and then when
[20:31] he did he brought the city right down on
[20:33] top of it
[20:35] John saw the city coming from Heaven to
[20:37] Earth
[20:39] throw a piece of that city that you were
[20:41] you already have now if you're born
[20:42] again because it came from above Jesus
[20:45] said you have to be born from above not
[20:48] down here from above all right so the
[20:50] city is already descended on you
[20:54] if you're born again all right or have
[20:56] faith that's that Faith right there is
[20:59] not just believing that tomorrow that
[21:00] the sun's going to come up
[21:03] that Faith there is believing that you
[21:05] are an absolute baptized with the holy
[21:07] ghost son and daughter of God
[21:09] Born Into The Kingdom can't get out of
[21:12] it found it already
[21:14] and accepted and just walk into it now
[21:17] that substance Faith you may fail every
[21:20] day you may fail every 15 minutes but
[21:22] there's something inside of you that
[21:24] holds men uh
[21:27] uh Dad we're talking about something the
[21:28] other day Friday going down to the Hunt
[21:30] Club and and it's true you see all these
[21:33] people now
[21:34] they don't have substance Faith so
[21:36] they're falling out they have faith in
[21:38] the message
[21:41] I mean this is what I understand and see
[21:44] that
[21:45] and it happens here
[21:47] I'm sorry but you see people come in
[21:50] they're they're not here and then they
[21:52] just come in and they sit down
[21:54] and they sit down under Heavenly
[21:55] atmosphere
[21:57] all right
[22:00] just sit down under Heavenly atmosphere
[22:02] and by knowledge by human knowledge if
[22:05] somebody brings the word to you by human
[22:07] knowledge
[22:09] you ought to be able to see certain
[22:11] scene
[22:12] not by the new birth
[22:14] by human knowledge I knew what happened
[22:17] you want to know why because it happened
[22:18] to me
[22:20] when I was 14 years old coming to this
[22:22] church I could explain serpent season if
[22:25] you'll ask brother Tatum he said I could
[22:27] explain one God like most preachers but
[22:29] I did not have any birth no what did I
[22:31] do I came under the umbrella of the
[22:33] message
[22:36] maybe a confession but no possession
[22:41] so I didn't run the race all the way out
[22:44] I run to a certain spot and stop and
[22:45] went out in the world
[22:47] why there was no possession there there
[22:49] was no City there I went out in the
[22:52] world because I was born in sand shape
[22:54] and iniquity you'd come sit in this
[22:56] church and from what brother they'll
[22:57] preaches and it's simple as he breaks it
[22:59] down you cannot have a new birth one day
[23:01] and understand what he's talking about
[23:03] today
[23:05] I see some doing this but that's exactly
[23:07] the truth we've got to have a new birth
[23:10] Holy Ghost experience it don't have to
[23:13] be shouting it don't have to be running
[23:14] around and screaming you understand but
[23:18] it's got to be an experience
[23:19] because what's going to happen is it's
[23:22] one day
[23:24] you don't start falling you can't finish
[23:26] the race
[23:29] Paul finished his race he testified he
[23:32] said I've run my race I fought the good
[23:35] fight but what happens now even with
[23:36] preachers you see preachers in a message
[23:38] now just not even just not even just
[23:40] going into false Doctrine we're not even
[23:41] talking about those they hang around
[23:43] just to mess things up
[23:45] that's the make believer in the mixed
[23:47] multitude but you see him just doing
[23:49] this going from the message sitting in a
[23:51] Baptist Church now how are you going to
[23:53] do that what happened is they had they
[23:56] had a anointing of this message
[23:59] Joel said I'll pour out my spirit on
[24:02] just a message Believers oh no that's
[24:05] not what he said he said I'll pour out
[24:07] my spirit on All Flesh
[24:11] now that's not the new birth
[24:14] it is if you take it on in that's right
[24:18] but if you just let it anoint your
[24:19] spirit you can sit in a message church
[24:22] and die and go to hell just as quick as
[24:23] Adolf Hitler amen if you don't let it
[24:27] become a total part of your life you say
[24:31] well I fail every day well so do we but
[24:32] what do you do you still come to church
[24:33] you still read your Bible you still have
[24:36] a desire to want to know more about God
[24:40] that's why I do
[24:42] you know everybody thinks claude's rough
[24:44] and Daddy's rough I wish to God if we
[24:46] could preach all these 80 or 90 people
[24:47] to go to church here I wish I could
[24:48] preach them all
[24:49] into hell
[24:51] so we can get you out
[24:53] but if you believe you're already in
[24:55] heaven
[24:57] but your Soul's in hell
[25:00] you're deceived
[25:02] and this message is the greatest
[25:05] deception without the holy ghost that
[25:08] ever has come on the face of the Earth
[25:09] everybody understand what I just said
[25:11] yes this message is pure and holy but
[25:14] what land has done to it is they've made
[25:17] it some great because listen let me
[25:19] prove that Paul says you can know all
[25:22] Mysteries
[25:25] one God water baptism no eternal hell
[25:31] said you can know all Mysteries and have
[25:34] not charity
[25:36] you know what is that
[25:38] you can know all Mysteries but not have
[25:40] the Holy Ghost because that anointing is
[25:43] so strong in this day and hour yes the
[25:45] prophet brought the message he brought
[25:47] the open book and uh people just come in
[25:49] and sit down and just well I'm in the
[25:51] message I must have the Holy Ghost no
[25:53] that don't mean a thing the devil got
[25:56] here before you did
[25:58] and he ain't born again but he's in the
[26:01] message
[26:03] what do you think you think he's out
[26:05] there he's already got them
[26:07] they're already his they're his children
[26:10] would you believe it or not
[26:12] brother Brown said you take a father son
[26:14] Holy Ghost baptism he said that come
[26:16] from the pits of hell
[26:18] and once the words been made known
[26:21] you can't go back to that
[26:23] I don't see how in the world you could
[26:25] leave this message and go back to uh you
[26:28] know if you leave this message just
[26:29] going out the world of sin don't go to a
[26:31] Baptist Church that's right that's worse
[26:33] really at least we go out in the world
[26:35] of sin you know you lost and God might
[26:38] have some Grace to get you back
[26:40] but if you go sit at the Baptist Church
[26:42] say well I'm okay I'm going to church
[26:43] everything's fine then you're deceived
[26:46] and like brothers always said if you're
[26:48] deceived you don't know it
[26:50] you have to have somebody bring it to
[26:52] light
[26:53] that's why I said I wish we could preach
[26:54] everybody lost and then everybody would
[26:57] go I'm lost now let's start into
[27:00] justification now let's start in the
[27:02] sanctification
[27:03] the baptism of the Holy Ghost so just
[27:05] listen to what brother they was talking
[27:07] about because you know what we're going
[27:08] to prove our predestination somewhere
[27:09] down the line
[27:11] somewhere down the line you're going to
[27:12] fall off no more down the line you're
[27:14] going to say wow I really don't have to
[27:15] go to church my family is more important
[27:17] my my desk and my that come on people
[27:21] we let a lot of things get in the way
[27:23] but this should be our focal point yeah
[27:26] of what we're doing in life
[27:29] is to be strong as a Christian be
[27:32] showing virtue showing knowledge showing
[27:35] Temple showing faith not just have it
[27:36] because if you haven't you'll show it
[27:40] Peter Peter's just I mean Peter didn't
[27:43] walk by and go
[27:44] bless God I've got what that man needs
[27:46] but
[27:48] you didn't do that
[27:50] he walked by just like I did out there
[27:52] driving the church he had compassion on
[27:55] what was going on he looked at that man
[27:59] they might have been a hundred
[28:02] blind death mute
[28:06] laying at that gate called beautiful but
[28:09] one man's
[28:10] made a connection to what Peter had
[28:14] and he said sir have mercy on me
[28:18] and that was the connection
[28:19] there was a connection there and Peter
[28:22] said so we're going to have my name such
[28:24] as I have rise up on your feet and lock
[28:25] and he did that proved he had virtue
[28:29] all right
[28:32] so we're going to prove whether we have
[28:34] the new birth or not it's somewhere
[28:36] along the line something's going to
[28:37] happen in your life and you're going to
[28:39] either
[28:40] make a right hand turn are you going to
[28:42] go straight ahead and not worry about
[28:43] the right hand turn right
[28:47] verse 17 we're still not going to get
[28:49] through this by faith Abraham when he
[28:52] was tried
[28:54] offered up Isaac and he that had
[28:57] received the promise offered up his only
[28:59] begotten son
[29:01] of whom it was said that in Isaac shall
[29:04] I see be called in other words he was
[29:05] fixing to kill the very promise
[29:08] that God gave him give you Isaac to have
[29:11] all these children and now I want you to
[29:12] kill him
[29:17] let's let's skip over
[29:20] verse 38. read real quick
[29:24] you can read all these other things
[29:27] look at verse 25 Moses choosing made a
[29:31] choice it's your choice people God
[29:33] predestinates by your choice and nothing
[29:35] else
[29:37] what you choose
[29:39] of whom the world was not worthy in
[29:41] other words all these people they
[29:43] wandered in deserts in mountains and
[29:44] dens and caves of the earth and these
[29:46] all having obtained a good report this
[29:48] is what this is a good report in Hebrews
[29:50] 11. through faith receive not the
[29:54] promise not promises promise what's the
[29:58] promise New Birth I'll come back and
[30:01] restore this thing all right God having
[30:03] provided some better thing for us
[30:06] what the new birth that they that didn't
[30:09] have it
[30:10] without us
[30:12] should not be made perfect
[30:14] haul it back and saw all them and said
[30:16] hey man they didn't have the new birth
[30:17] but look how great they were look they
[30:19] weren't the world wasn't even worthy for
[30:21] them to be walking on it
[30:23] but they didn't receive a promise you
[30:25] have the promise now so we'll start on
[30:28] virtue because that is the promise of
[30:29] God then he'll give us virtue if we will
[30:32] ask for it all right let's go
[30:44] I got a battery
[31:08] oh yeah
[31:11] foreign
[31:38] everybody
[32:14] because I was
[32:19] that I was you know slipping right and
[32:22] that's why I want to do it backwards
[32:25] right I'm not going to let there oh you
[32:28] know
[32:35] perfect
[34:12] thank you
