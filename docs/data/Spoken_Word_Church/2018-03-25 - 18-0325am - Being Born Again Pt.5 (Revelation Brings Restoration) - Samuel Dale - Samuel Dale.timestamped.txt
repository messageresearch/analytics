[8:56] have your way now as we read your words
[8:59] you speak to our hearts we love you and
[9:01] we thank you in Jesus name Amen then
[9:10] we're going to first Peter 1 we've been
[9:15] reading this but the main part is to be
[9:17] reading verse 23 but we read all of this
[9:20] because we want to make sure we we light
[9:23] up and see you know where we come from
[9:25] for as much as you know that you were
[9:28] not redeemed with corruptible things as
[9:30] silver and gold from your vain
[9:33] conversation received by tradition from
[9:35] your father's now our thought today will
[9:39] be relating to we've been speaking about
[9:42] the new birth being a revelation so
[9:44] it'll be relating to revelation bringing
[9:48] restoration alright so then that's what
[9:51] he's he's covering seeing and laying out
[9:53] that point all right but with the
[9:56] precious blood of Christ as of a lamb
[9:57] without blemish and without spot who've
[10:00] early was foreordained before the
[10:02] foundation of the world but was made but
[10:05] was manifest in these last days for you
[10:08] who by him do believe in God
[10:11] that raised him up from the dead and
[10:14] gave him glory that your faith and hope
[10:18] might be in God seeing you have purified
[10:21] your souls and obeying the truth but now
[10:26] what's Oh bassy you have purified your
[10:30] souls in obeying the truth through the
[10:32] spirit unto unfeigned love of the
[10:35] Brethren
[10:35] since you love one another with a pure
[10:38] heart fervently being born again not of
[10:42] corruptible seed but of incorruptible by
[10:44] the Word of God which liveth and abideth
[10:47] forever now remember being born again is
[10:51] applied two ways we are when you come to
[10:55] Christ you accept him as your savior etc
[10:58] you're being born again all right
[11:01] but then when you get into the statue of
[11:03] a perfect man the pyramid and start
[11:05] talking then you come into the real
[11:07] meaning of being born again because it's
[11:10] something transpiring in your life every
[11:14] day in your Christian experience okay
[11:16] now we go to acts 1 in 6 when that
[11:22] therefore were come together they asked
[11:24] of him saying Lord wilt thou at this
[11:27] time restore again the kingdom unto
[11:29] Israel and he said unto them it is not
[11:34] for you to know the things are the
[11:38] seasons which the father hath put into
[11:40] his own hand now in other words if you
[11:44] read that and don't get it right read it
[11:47] with this thought in other words they've
[11:50] asked him about the kingdom and what's
[11:52] his answer be different as we would
[11:55] think of it with what he's just saying
[11:57] it don't be concerned about the kingdoms
[12:00] and the things here's what you need to
[12:03] be concerned about ok so let's read it
[12:05] over alright and he said unto them it is
[12:11] not for you to know the times or the
[12:13] seasons which the father has put in his
[12:16] own power don't worry about it because
[12:21] they something far you that'll take care
[12:23] of this because that's what he's telling
[12:25] the disciples now this is right at his
[12:26] ascension huh which he shall receive
[12:29] power after that the Holy Ghost has come
[12:32] upon you and you shall be witnesses unto
[12:34] me both in Jerusalem in Judea and
[12:37] Samaria and to the other most part of
[12:40] the earth and when he had spoken these
[12:42] things while they beheld he was taken up
[12:46] in a cloud received him out
[12:48] of their shot you may be seated the Lord
[12:51] at his blessing to the reading of the
[12:53] word so you understand what I'm saying
[12:56] he was trying to tell him don't worry
[12:58] about these be concerned about the fact
[13:09] of knowing where you're at and what's
[13:13] taking place because that's what we're
[13:15] doing now all right
[13:17] then he had sins and goes away all right
[13:21] now we've been speaking about the
[13:26] thought of being born again and we've
[13:30] covered many things and I covered there
[13:34] Wednesday in you know bringing it down
[13:37] to a point that I wanted you to follow
[13:41] I've asked you to read the stature of a
[13:45] perfect man I've asked you to read many
[13:50] of related messages into that area of
[13:53] time and study it I've asked you to read
[13:56] like blasphemous names because but I
[14:00] seen these names and the stature of
[14:02] perfect land blasphemous names as
[14:04] priests I store the statue of a perfect
[14:06] man
[14:06] all right but it's explaining you get a
[14:08] better concept or thought of what's
[14:12] being said in the message of the statue
[14:16] of a perfect man all right now into
[14:19] doing that then we're looking at it as
[14:22] the new birth we've come through the Old
[14:24] Testament all the way through up to her
[14:26] that we are now and we've come to the
[14:30] position of talking about the new birth
[14:33] as coming onto their Pentecost - to the
[14:37] disciples bringing the revealed Word and
[14:40] what have we asked you over and over and
[14:43] what what if I always taught you because
[14:45] this is what I believe I believe the new
[14:47] birth is the birth of the word all right
[14:50] now you tell me something else it would
[14:52] be you know it can't be it's the birth
[14:55] of the word the disciples heard the word
[14:58] for three and a half years all right
[15:01] then the whole ego
[15:02] fell as a prophet said to irrigate that
[15:05] word or make it alive and dar was the
[15:08] new birth they alright then knowing it
[15:12] from that we we can hold a point that
[15:15] the birth of the word is Christ alright
[15:18] as we'll read it in a minute the Prophet
[15:21] says you can't be saved how many times
[15:23] we read that over and over he said you
[15:25] can't be saved without a revelation we
[15:29] see then what people are think but
[15:30] because they're thinking about it as a
[15:32] young child experienced a lot of times
[15:35] of coming accepting Jesus Christ and
[15:38] they say I didn't get no revelation well
[15:42] think sensibly you know cuz I'm not
[15:46] talking to the children they probably
[15:50] understood what took place I'm talking
[15:52] to you adults think sensibly what is the
[15:55] new word the Prophet will say it is the
[15:58] revelation of Jesus Christ personally to
[16:00] you well then don't you remember when
[16:05] God called you don't you remember when
[16:09] he dealt with you in your life
[16:12] don't you remember when you accepted him
[16:14] as your Savior and then we've got many
[16:20] experiences and many people tell about
[16:22] the things of great things happening all
[16:26] of that swelling weren't great but what
[16:28] is the birth it's the birth of the word
[16:31] well I didn't hear no word you didn't
[16:34] hear the preacher you didn't hear the
[16:36] Sunday school teacher you didn't hear
[16:38] mom you didn't your dad or our brother
[16:40] or somebody talking to you about the
[16:42] Lord that's what I am trying to get you
[16:44] to see is to look at things instead of
[16:47] what you see we think well what
[16:50] revelation do we need to get you know
[16:53] well see now you're going to tongues is
[16:55] an evidence you're going to experiences
[16:59] like that of the wrong thing the it's
[17:03] the birth of the word of whatever God
[17:05] reveals to you and I'm honest to say
[17:10] that I don't believe a lot of people get
[17:12] the new birth cause they don't know what
[17:14] it is
[17:16] they don't know what it is
[17:18] I remember we read the quote from the
[17:21] Prophet if you don't know what the Holy
[17:23] Ghost is then how you gonna know when
[17:25] you got it see how you gonna know when
[17:30] you got if you don't know what it is
[17:31] well I believe it's this it's just a
[17:33] it's just a something coming down you
[17:35] know that's what he said in blasphemous
[17:36] names he said it's been so the baptism
[17:41] of the Holy Ghost has been so
[17:42] incorrectly taught he said until we just
[17:47] say baptism he said now that a lot goes
[17:50] with it said like it's a car automobile
[17:53] said there's a lot goes with that let's
[17:56] see then that way we don't follow it and
[17:58] listen to the Prophet and that's why it
[18:00] gets confusing when he'll make
[18:02] statements that totally seems like that
[18:08] tur totally out then he doesn't know
[18:11] what he's talking about or that he later
[18:16] got it straightened out that's the great
[18:18] point among the people of the message
[18:20] you know uh-huh he done it but he later
[18:23] he got it straightened out
[18:25] well okay tell me when he straightened
[18:26] it out you know because it was so much
[18:32] that he needed straighten it out then
[18:34] this Shirley Hill were to mark down and
[18:36] said something somewhere what I used to
[18:37] believe this way because he was strict
[18:39] enough and straight enough to say even
[18:41] one time he said I used to believe the
[18:43] evidence of the Holy Ghost was this or
[18:45] was that or as I thought love or he said
[18:48] until the Holy Ghost straightened me out
[18:50] well he used to believe the white horse
[18:54] rider was the Holy Ghost until the Lord
[18:59] straightened him out well then why why
[19:04] would be we can be concerned about
[19:06] things why not just look for him to find
[19:08] out what it is but yet look at it in the
[19:11] right direction to the point that we're
[19:13] we're not trying to find contradictions
[19:17] but we're trying to find truth the truth
[19:27] the part truth is wonderful but D truth
[19:31] all right
[19:32] so now remember what we've been bringing
[19:34] or the thought that we brought this past
[19:36] Wednesday now
[19:39] this is the way I believe it and this
[19:40] way I've always tried to express
[19:42] anything you've heard brother Branham
[19:44] say over and over that our human
[19:47] language and different times like that
[19:50] is so contrary until you know it's hard
[19:54] to understand he said now like the word
[19:57] board he said you can say come on board
[20:01] a ship you say stand on this board
[20:04] because I'm bored with you so you got
[20:08] three different meanings or thoughts of
[20:11] using that but now remember remember
[20:16] what I've always tried to get you to see
[20:18] the before and the after explains what
[20:23] you're talking about so then we should
[20:27] search the Word of God if we think we
[20:30] found something contrary or the message
[20:33] we should search before we should search
[20:37] after to see whatever it fits because
[20:40] then I can say to you and simple
[20:43] understanding about the board
[20:45] come on board stand on this board
[20:50] because I'm bored with you now you know
[20:53] how no problem to understanding what I
[20:54] said do what's the problem with the word
[20:59] board if we've explained it right what's
[21:04] the problem we're trying to to get our
[21:07] thoughts in the right order as we say in
[21:09] Wednesday that there's a lot of things
[21:12] brother Branham says that sounds like a
[21:15] lot of times its contrary one to the
[21:17] other but give it time wait on the Lord
[21:24] to where he can reveal it then you'll
[21:27] find out he's not as contrary as you
[21:29] think right because there's a lot of
[21:34] statements that he'll make
[21:38] that my point is if you take before what
[21:42] he said and then go after what he said
[21:46] the thought you might find out he knew
[21:52] what he's talking about all along right
[21:56] let's see we are so quick to try to find
[22:00] this contradiction or that contradict
[22:03] when I declared the contradictions or
[22:05] not that it's our understanding
[22:10] it's what messes it up it's our thoughts
[22:14] our ideas you know that we have well he
[22:17] said this yeah but I found just that
[22:20] smart ethically very intelligent parts
[22:24] of human beings that were always want to
[22:26] be number one to find out something well
[22:30] I don't care if I'm number ten or
[22:32] whatever it is as long as I get it right
[22:34] but understand the point the before and
[22:37] the after will describe you you take
[22:44] like brother Brennan would say you know
[22:46] we read a book and it says and John and
[22:49] Mary lived happily ever after
[22:53] well you know nothing about who Johnny
[22:56] is and who Mary is and while they're
[22:58] happy but if you take the before of it
[23:05] study the point over to where you're
[23:07] going and then you can come up and and
[23:10] see John and Mary what they they got
[23:14] married today they live happily ever
[23:16] after
[23:17] now you've got your answer and you're
[23:21] not confused that's what I believe about
[23:25] the message it sounds contradictory but
[23:30] sit down and listen to it and then study
[23:35] in the line up of the thought of that
[23:37] because that's what I was trying to do
[23:39] Wednesday night all right try to bring
[23:41] the thought to you know because you can
[23:44] take I can take brother branham's
[23:46] message you can too and I can make it
[23:49] say anything I want it to say about
[23:51] pulling quotes and moving things and
[23:53] declaring this or that right we done it
[23:58] with the Bible you can take the Bible
[24:01] and make it say what you want it to say
[24:03] now listen what was emphasizing
[24:07] Wednesday though that's not what the
[24:11] Bible is saying the Bible doesn't change
[24:14] with my thoughts and my ideas the Bible
[24:19] never called a Trinity right but we
[24:24] swore by it right all right then it's if
[24:31] we get the right idea we see the Bible
[24:33] didn't change and you don't have to
[24:37] change brother Browns message to make it
[24:40] fit
[24:41] now he was a human being let's allow him
[24:44] to have parts abiding that sometimes is
[24:49] misunderstood
[24:51] maybe his speech is some way or maybe he
[24:54] said something and probably a lot of
[24:56] times you know how it is with your own
[24:58] self sometimes you'd walk up to bread
[25:00] around him and you'd say brother around
[25:01] them you said so-and-so it's a if I said
[25:05] that I sure wasn't it was something
[25:07] wrong I don't remember saying that what
[25:09] because it was a human being right and
[25:14] see then we want to go by those things
[25:15] you know to try to determine whether he
[25:19] was a prophet or not I've never been to
[25:23] the basis now you can like this or not
[25:25] I've never been to the basis of thinking
[25:27] that brother Branham would make a slip
[25:29] of a tongue about something 707 seventh
[25:32] out he wasn't no prophet he was no
[25:34] prophet he know the difference I likened
[25:38] that unto her that you remember when the
[25:40] lady came there in washing Jesus's feet
[25:44] and putting the on him but only remember
[25:45] what the man said if he was a prophet
[25:48] he'd know what kind of woman this is
[25:50] that's paraphrasing it but it's close
[25:53] didn't it see if he was a prophet so
[25:56] she's always trying to find out
[25:58] something that demon within mankind is
[26:02] trying to tear down this message in
[26:05] stead of accepting it and waiting on God
[26:07] to reveal it right now that's my whole
[26:10] point
[26:11] that's the way that I've always been it
[26:13] alright so now we've been talking about
[26:17] as I said the new birth and got to the
[26:19] point of the to the day of Pentecost and
[26:23] the coming of the baptism of the Holy
[26:24] Ghost
[26:25] all right and that baptism with the Holy
[26:28] Ghost when it came on to their Pentecost
[26:30] remember it came to a hundred and twenty
[26:33] in the upper room they had been tutored
[26:37] and trained of the Lord for three and a
[26:41] half years and then the Holy Ghost fail
[26:46] but outside a few hours later the three
[26:52] thousand heard one message and received
[26:57] the baptism of the Holy Ghost just one
[27:02] message at the house of Kinesis it was
[27:05] one message one thought one point and
[27:08] they received the baptism when the whole
[27:11] to go and I believe that's the one
[27:12] didn't it were this cell talking about
[27:13] how to forbid them to be baptized Liat
[27:16] seeing that they receive the Holy Ghost
[27:18] we did at the beginning well now there's
[27:23] no difference in the basis of the 3,000
[27:27] of receiving the baptism of the Holy
[27:29] Ghost and the difference there's no
[27:31] difference in them and a 120 in the
[27:33] Upper Room
[27:34] they both received the baptism in the
[27:36] Holy Spirit which was a new birth which
[27:38] was eternal life all right now the
[27:42] difference was was the teaching that had
[27:46] been there that the disciples had been
[27:49] taught that word and then when God
[27:51] quickened it to him see then it was
[27:56] determined in them that they would have
[27:57] the faith of the father's as we call it
[27:59] or looking at the pyramid where brother
[28:02] Brown said statue of a perfect man you
[28:04] heard him he said they had these virtues
[28:06] and I remember he said they didn't have
[28:08] the headstone he said it hadn't come yet
[28:11] so now put that in line and hold that
[28:13] point but they had where it says Holy
[28:16] Spirit
[28:18] one because they'd been talk so Peter
[28:21] and then Peter and Paul was explaining
[28:24] how to come to her that they were
[28:28] because he says they're in accent women
[28:31] in a in Peter that we read second Peter
[28:34] says add to your faith and he says
[28:38] talking about them of like precious
[28:40] faith and brethren said he's not talking
[28:43] to the world he's talking to the church
[28:46] those that are in Christ Jesus
[28:49] all right now see you can't use the
[28:53] group in the 3,000 down stars to teach
[28:56] the word because they had no tutoring of
[28:58] the word now they could talk to the
[29:01] people they could direct and all that
[29:02] but get what I'm saying God never used
[29:05] the novice to write the word how could
[29:09] have we'll call him Sam for Ryan
[29:11] how could Sam walked out on the day of
[29:13] Pentecost get the Holy Ghost was in the
[29:15] 3000 then turn around tell the rest of
[29:17] them how to get tired he couldn't do it
[29:19] it took somebody that had already been
[29:22] there so Peter had been dire Peter had
[29:26] reached that position of the virtues up
[29:29] to where it says Holy Spirit and then he
[29:33] could tell people how to get to where he
[29:35] was because that's what he was doing all
[29:39] right now what was her thought Paul said
[29:43] the same thing Peter said now remember
[29:48] what ROM explains it Paul and Peter had
[29:52] difference in dot and idea about how
[29:56] Peter was behaving but said there was no
[29:58] difference in doctrine
[30:03] so now God used Peter to bring the
[30:06] message of second Peter of the stature
[30:10] of a perfect man all right
[30:13] he used Paul in that I've asked you to
[30:17] read about it because we're getting over
[30:19] to it
[30:19] he used Paul especially like Galatians 4
[30:22] where he's talking about the tutors and
[30:25] and how the child is a child when it's
[30:28] born but it's under tutors and
[30:31] owners until the time of appointed and
[30:33] then it can be adopted well the statue
[30:39] of a perfect man is the message telling
[30:41] you how to become to that Paul is
[30:44] explaining what happens he's using the
[30:49] natural world life of the adoption of
[30:52] stage that a child is a child when it's
[30:55] born into the family all right but in
[30:59] its tutored and trained until it comes
[31:02] to the position it can be adopted into
[31:04] that family right all right to the full
[31:09] inheritance at that place that's exactly
[31:13] what Peter's doing Peter's explaining
[31:19] how it's done come on if you read the
[31:24] message we read them over and over to
[31:26] you or brother Brian said statue of a
[31:28] perfect man what he said how faith and
[31:30] be born again he said see our whole
[31:34] basis now is based on faith see because
[31:38] you're born again at faith he says and
[31:44] read to Peter they're worse at those
[31:46] that have straight escaped the
[31:47] corruption that is in the world through
[31:49] lust what this person this person that
[31:53] starts up the pyramid that starts at
[31:55] faith of that new birth experience that
[32:01] that person as it does it's a child
[32:07] little brother said now I didn't say the
[32:10] statement but around said that the
[32:14] baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't make
[32:16] you no greater no more Christian than he
[32:19] was he was born of faith I didn't say
[32:23] that he did what I'm saying you are not
[32:27] listening to what he's saying
[32:30] you're not listening to try to
[32:32] understand what he's saying you're
[32:35] listening to put your own thoughts or
[32:37] ideas what I found is all right so what
[32:43] is it Paul and Peter we're not
[32:44] contouring doctrine but Paul never heard
[32:50] Peter teach the statue of a perfect man
[32:52] he went to the backside of the desert
[32:54] because God needed two things remember
[32:57] in the mouth of two or three witnesses
[32:58] let everything be established is that
[33:00] Scripture
[33:01] God needed for another way or for
[33:04] somebody else to teach this so it used
[33:07] Peter two sticks teach it add to your
[33:09] faith virtue or knowledge temperance
[33:11] patience he uses Paul to explain it in
[33:17] the form of the child as long as it's a
[33:22] child when it's born we said it differs
[33:26] not but said then it's tutored and
[33:28] trained they're explaining the same
[33:32] thing and God has his compound part
[33:35] he has his point because it's always in
[33:37] the mouth of two or three witnesses let
[33:39] everything be established then we'll get
[33:42] back to that when we when we get to the
[33:44] message part later I'm just trying to
[33:46] stay with the new birth as to seeing the
[33:49] new birth and what it is and we'll get
[33:51] down to her brother branham see God had
[33:53] the sin brother branham he went up that
[33:56] stature a perfect man by himself now you
[33:59] say wait a minute
[34:01] who taught brother branham same one at
[34:04] all Paul who taught Paul wouldn't Peter
[34:11] the Holy Ghost in the backside of the
[34:13] desert who taught brother branham this
[34:15] message right all right now we got to
[34:18] write line up right Peter can tell you
[34:22] how this being born again is taking
[34:26] place Paul is giving you references to
[34:29] the life and the things in what it does
[34:31] but a random come to bring us back to
[34:34] restoration remember revelation branes
[34:40] restoration all right see it's bringing
[34:44] us but a random had to get the message
[34:47] read it yourself
[34:49] he said 30-something years before he
[34:51] could preach that
[34:54] we get you go back to the inner veil and
[34:56] well those messages and listen to him
[34:59] talk about Aluva living moving
[35:01] instrumentality of Christianity walking
[35:04] into feet he was teaching those things
[35:07] back there trying his best to tell those
[35:09] Pentecostals he said that's where you
[35:11] failed he said you think born into the
[35:14] family makes you fully settled in
[35:16] everybody he said that brought this
[35:17] brought you in the family he said but
[35:21] you've got to have this you got out of
[35:22] the growth development why because God
[35:25] had called him that away uh-huh see then
[35:29] do we believe it that away
[35:31] brother brother never come to straighten
[35:33] out the Bible then he come to tell us
[35:38] what it say it you know what it said it
[35:40] said what it say it right I mean it said
[35:44] what it said as I standing there want to
[35:46] go he didn't have to have something to
[35:48] go over this way but go read to before
[35:50] of the book and after the book and read
[35:53] it all the way through and you'll find
[35:55] out something but it's like I saying the
[35:58] other day I asked a simple question how
[36:01] many people have really read the seal
[36:04] book but I set and taught with ministers
[36:10] and things that didn't even have a
[36:12] Daniel seventy weeks book but they could
[36:14] tell you everything brother Branham say
[36:16] it and didn't even have a book never
[36:19] read one that's pretty good and that
[36:26] kind of reminds me I like he's to these
[36:29] school teachers an amendment and for the
[36:32] Bob family you know it's kind of like
[36:34] steel down our shaving in you in
[36:36] kindergarten you know cuz that's about
[36:41] like our thoughts sometimes okay now
[36:43] listen
[36:46] so then brother branham answered his own
[36:49] question when he said own statue refer I
[36:53] mean on cross the minister of God reveal
[36:55] paragraph 2 33 to 34 brother branham
[36:59] what he is the new birth
[37:03] he said it's a revelation of Jesus
[37:05] Christ
[37:07] personally to you it's the word that's
[37:13] been revealed to you it's the making
[37:18] alive of the word to you that's why
[37:21] we're being born again see your birth
[37:24] doesn't stop that dis started that's why
[37:28] you put the adoption over with the
[37:30] statue of a perfect man and you can see
[37:33] the the message laid out beautiful Paul
[37:36] explains the natural that of child as a
[37:38] child when it's born it's born into the
[37:41] family Peter tells you born again
[37:47] of those of like precious faith he said
[37:52] and they gave you a whole bunch of
[37:54] quotes were brought around we're talking
[37:55] about like precious faith he said
[38:00] Timothy had like precious faith the one
[38:03] because it was a new birth all right
[38:06] Peter is telling you the new birth get
[38:11] the new birth and then you're growing
[38:15] into grace and knowledge as the word is
[38:17] revealed to you Paul is telling you the
[38:20] natural part of the life to bring you to
[38:24] an adoption and both reach the same
[38:26] position
[38:31] Peter's talking about revelation Paul
[38:33] must be talking about revelation uh-huh
[38:39] so then what did what did he say what is
[38:41] the new birth brother branham he said
[38:45] it's the baptism when the holder goes
[38:47] all right yeah page 154 of the church
[38:57] age book what is the baptism with the
[39:00] Holy Ghost no here he says what is the
[39:04] new bar he said it's a revelation of
[39:10] Jesus Christ personally to you
[39:15] all right now you got what the new birth
[39:17] is right new birth is revelation
[39:19] personally to you see that's why your
[39:22] revelation never stops if it stopped it
[39:27] would be like a baby growing so much and
[39:29] then quitting right that would be the
[39:35] point of this stop when we say we don't
[39:37] grow no more but we do we grow out okay
[39:43] but listen so Brendan what is the new
[39:46] birth it's revelation of Jesus Christ
[39:48] personally to you he said it's not
[39:52] joining the church to this that enough
[39:54] he says revelation to you now he says
[39:57] what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[40:01] well if he answers it did water know
[40:06] what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[40:07] because he goes on on into some learning
[40:11] church age 144 and he says now we want
[40:15] to find out what this Holy Ghost is
[40:16] according to the word he says it's not
[40:20] according to me and it's not according
[40:22] to you it has to be according to thus
[40:26] saith the Lord now we're going to
[40:32] believe it but what is the baptism with
[40:35] the Holy Ghost it is the spirit
[40:36] baptizing you into the body of Christ it
[40:40] is the new birth it is the Spirit of God
[40:44] coming in and filling you after you have
[40:48] repented having heard heard his word and
[40:52] been baptized in the water so now what
[40:56] is the baptism went on it's the new
[40:58] birth
[40:59] what is the new birth it's a baptism
[41:01] with the Holy Ghost all right
[41:05] see then that's why that I've always
[41:07] taught it that away and I believe the
[41:09] Prophet taught it into that form that
[41:12] what the new birth the baptism of the
[41:18] Holy Ghost the being born again
[41:24] is all the same it's not three different
[41:29] parts are three different you know it's
[41:33] not one leading to the other one and
[41:35] then you finally get to this one
[41:37] no but it's explaining what he said when
[41:42] he said it on blasphemous night he said
[41:44] to halt the Holy Ghost has been so
[41:47] incorrectly told you remember where I
[41:48] gave the one where he said they was nine
[41:51] hundred different ways of seeing the
[41:56] baptism of the Holy Ghost because he's
[42:01] referring to how many there are nine
[42:04] hundred and something different
[42:06] denominations and things gonna and just
[42:10] think about that many different thoughts
[42:13] about one new birth no wonder it's so
[42:16] missed in or so incorrectly talk we see
[42:25] I believe when you're born again I truly
[42:28] born again not make believe you believe
[42:31] in to eternal life we've been through
[42:32] that but Ren says your new birth starts
[42:36] when you believe right it starts when
[42:41] you believe the day you believe that new
[42:45] birth star that doesn't mean it's in
[42:46] fulfillment he said it's like a baby in
[42:49] the wound of a mother
[42:51] he said it's conceived but it's not come
[42:54] forth yet see you believe unto eternal
[42:59] life and we went through it over and
[43:02] over but one said if you die in that
[43:04] state he said sure you're going to
[43:06] heaven but he never said you'd be in the
[43:10] bride he never said you had eternal life
[43:12] that stage you're believing on - we've
[43:16] been through the whole time bringing it
[43:19] out where we can come to the point to
[43:21] what we're doing of the new birth the
[43:23] emphases I've been bringing is one time
[43:26] are you born again
[43:32] do you have the new birth then why you
[43:39] know or what's your dollars and you say
[43:44] new birth to most people I spoke in
[43:46] tongues I shouted I cried I didn't got
[43:48] nothing to do with it it's after-effects
[43:50] that's the baby after he gets here
[43:53] that's after comes out of the wound
[43:55] that's the baby after it's born right
[43:59] well you don't believe in that no I I
[44:01] believe in all of the signs and wonders
[44:04] I believe in all of the things of God
[44:07] but I have to also believe where the
[44:09] Prophet would say the recent received
[44:11] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this
[44:13] day without a sensation but he never
[44:17] talked receiving the baptism of the Holy
[44:20] Ghost without an experience now you find
[44:23] that one for me an experience is
[44:27] something you live through a sensation
[44:31] is a stimulation upon your feelings or
[44:35] whatever that's why your anointed ones
[44:40] will work all right but now listen so
[44:45] then if it's true that the new birth the
[44:47] baptism of the Holy Ghost and being born
[44:50] again is the same thing then we can
[44:53] listen to the Prophet as he says things
[44:56] if you keep that thought in your mind
[44:59] then when you come to sounding like
[45:02] contrary things if you'll just simply
[45:04] listen and you'll see him saying things
[45:10] that are wonderful he says I can
[45:15] conclusively prove that you are born
[45:18] again and then baptized into the body
[45:23] now that sounds like it's totally
[45:25] contrary to what he just said about the
[45:31] baptism of the Holy Spirit and what it
[45:32] is are the new birth and what it is i
[45:35] sounds like he's teaching some
[45:37] denominational ID or thought that they
[45:40] had no that's exactly right
[45:43] if you'll just go to the pyramid and
[45:46] look at it you are born again at faith
[45:50] but there's a baptism which is the faith
[45:54] of the father's the opening of the word
[45:57] that doesn't end all about the baptism
[45:59] of the Holy Ghost that's where people
[46:01] miss correct and tout it sees the new
[46:03] birth is a baptism of the Holy Spirit
[46:04] right here
[46:05] this is a baptism in the Holy Spirit
[46:07] here this is the baptism of the Holy
[46:09] Spirit here and every one of these is
[46:12] being born again every one of them at
[46:15] the birth
[46:16] come on ascend statue of a perfect man
[46:18] our blasphemy is named I'm looking at it
[46:20] this morning
[46:21] he says you're birthed into this into
[46:23] this into this and there's not seven new
[46:26] birth a birth means are coming forth
[46:29] into so as you come forward into these
[46:31] things as they come forth into you the
[46:34] Holy Ghost seals them in and you're
[46:37] climbing upward the growth development
[46:39] of God's Word it's simple if we just
[46:43] think of it I remember years ago
[46:45] standing in a churchyard in Athens
[46:47] Georgia and this man said I'll tell you
[46:51] what now that adoption is simple that
[46:56] adoption is simple we said that stature
[46:59] a perfect land is confusing
[47:01] I remember going because I knew if I
[47:09] opened my mouth I was going to have to
[47:14] say you are a dummy it cannot see the
[47:19] statue of a perfect man the born-again
[47:23] experience the adoptions and all that
[47:25] it's one in the same but it's according
[47:33] what you're reading from and what's it
[47:35] being explained what about brother
[47:39] Branham II remember on patents BC and
[47:41] I've been over this and over he said you
[47:43] can't be saved without a revelation well
[47:50] I didn't get rolling so you ain't say
[47:51] you said it I didn't
[47:55] you made a statement I didn't get a
[47:57] revelation then you're saying you're not
[47:59] saved because the Prophet said you can't
[48:03] be saved without a revelation
[48:08] it's Revelation Jesus Christ person to
[48:11] you and what I like in cross the mystery
[48:13] where he talks about the revelation of
[48:15] Jesus Christ to the most illiterate
[48:17] person you remember that one the most
[48:22] illiterate person can receive the new
[48:25] birth they can be born again and right
[48:29] into the family of God see we think it's
[48:36] got to be something this out the other I
[48:38] didn't make these statements you argue
[48:40] your prophet but listen what do we find
[48:46] out when spoken word is reading a seat
[48:49] for the birth of the word is Christ not
[48:54] a polluted with denominations in time
[48:56] the early church no denomination just
[48:59] the word and spirit irrigated God laid
[49:02] the word down like that and the Holy
[49:05] Ghost irrigated it in their zeal and
[49:12] what are we going in spoken word to
[49:14] bring out all of God's sons must be the
[49:17] same to be born of the word and spirit
[49:20] brings us back to the spoken word again
[49:24] like in John 3 to be born to the word
[49:31] and spirit brings you back to what Jesus
[49:33] was talking about because that's where
[49:34] John three is right when he said to
[49:37] Nicodemus you must be born again
[49:39] to be born to the word in spirit if
[49:42] Nicodemus could have took that word and
[49:44] held on and went over to Pentecost and
[49:46] receive the Holy Ghost he did note
[49:47] exactly what Jesus was talking about
[49:50] without ain't all of this statement
[49:52] listen to be born of the word ask you to
[49:56] be born to the water in the spirit what
[49:58] does it do then it brings you right back
[50:02] again unto the place of were you should
[50:06] have been
[50:07] at the beginning what was the beginning
[50:17] Adam and Eve in the garden is that the
[50:22] beginning remember you ain't talking
[50:23] about the beginning of that he talked
[50:27] about the real beginning that's why I
[50:30] tried to get you to see that and it was
[50:32] so vital from blasphemous names where
[50:35] brother run said God breathed into the
[50:37] nostrils of Adam eternal life
[50:42] so Adam had eternal life in his soul but
[50:47] his body and his spirit was an eternal
[50:50] alright what happened on the defini
[50:54] couch in the soul of mankind
[50:57] would it be the three thousand nine
[50:59] hundred and twenty they all received the
[51:01] Holy Ghost all right that was eternal
[51:06] life in their soul but their body and
[51:07] spirit still the same every born-again
[51:09] believers is that a way to be born to
[51:12] the word and spirit brings you back like
[51:14] we should have been without a fall you
[51:19] remember this one he said you were
[51:23] supposed to be here this spoken words
[51:24] originally in the right way at the
[51:26] beginning but being that you come the
[51:30] way you did you're subject for the fall
[51:33] but being that you're pretty but being
[51:38] that you're you've predestinated you
[51:41] hear the word it brings you right back
[51:44] where you were predestinated what about
[51:50] the words what about the new birth
[51:51] bringing you back the place use
[51:52] predestinate i just don't see it that
[51:55] could be the new birth - well come on
[51:58] didn't you get eternal life when you got
[52:00] the new birth he's not that the same
[52:02] thing Adam had in the guard come on what
[52:08] does he say then this is what I like
[52:12] brings you right back where you were
[52:15] predestinated he says Amen said never
[52:19] saw that before
[52:21] that's what he said said I never saw
[52:24] that before see shirts if we believe
[52:30] this simple point that the new birth the
[52:34] born-again experience the baptism of the
[52:38] Holy Ghost is one in the sign the
[52:43] brother run says in the church age book
[52:44] it is one of the sign but do we believe
[52:47] it as like I said to the human mind we
[52:52] can kind of comprehend the new birth we
[52:55] can kind of relate to the new birth and
[52:57] the the born-again experience but it's
[53:00] hard to think about the baptism of the
[53:02] Holy Ghost so we think the baptism has
[53:04] got to be something up in here that
[53:06] comes down fluttering across us or
[53:08] something that was not the new birth
[53:11] birth to the disciples in the upper room
[53:13] the new birth was when the lick of fire
[53:15] came on each one of them where God
[53:17] divided itself among them that anointing
[53:21] can do not knowing anybody on your
[53:23] spirit we're not doing away with hogs in
[53:28] the upper room we're explaining it to
[53:30] the point of what that new birth was
[53:33] when that lick of fire came on each one
[53:36] every born-again believer gets a lick of
[53:39] fire burn you burn if we believe that it
[53:44] makes it so easy then to be able to
[53:46] preach the message and you wouldn't be
[53:48] in the mass confusion of the people of
[53:50] this message
[53:54] [Music]
[53:57] you wouldn't be people being concerned I
[54:01] mean it wouldn't be you know all messed
[54:03] up it'd be one thing listen to this when
[54:06] he gets into the church age booth this
[54:09] is right after he says this is dust that
[54:11] you've got to have it according to the
[54:12] staff the Lord to receive Christ is to
[54:16] receive his spirit to receive his spirit
[54:19] is to be born again to receive his
[54:21] spirit is to be baptized with the Holy
[54:23] Ghost he's put them all through in one
[54:27] program amen these folks believe that's
[54:30] wonderful but they stop there you
[54:33] receive the holy
[54:34] goes after you believe it has always
[54:37] been that way and always will be the
[54:40] very word of direction to the people was
[54:43] by Peter at Pentecost but if we believe
[54:54] it that way then all three of what we
[54:58] look at is not three things it's
[55:01] explaining one thing then it'll make it
[55:05] so easy to understand what I was
[55:07] immersed rating very minute ago that
[55:10] Paul is describing or illustrating it
[55:15] from his point of view of looking at the
[55:18] Bible and studying the Bible all of
[55:22] those years and he'd studied the
[55:25] adoption of phases of phases he had
[55:28] studied those things he knew all of that
[55:30] from his background right
[55:34] and then he teaches the baby is a birth
[55:40] it's born again you know it's Apple it's
[55:45] a baby born in the family then it's
[55:47] tutored it's given the Holy Spirit
[55:51] remember we read the scripture you shall
[55:54] receive power after that the Holy Ghost
[55:56] is California two things is to be
[55:59] considered Jesus was telling the
[56:03] disciples there because he was fixing to
[56:05] his sin he said after you receive the
[56:08] Holy Ghost you're gonna get power right
[56:13] come on
[56:15] the statue of a perfect man we will get
[56:18] to it eventually when we get there
[56:20] you remember virtue means strength and
[56:22] strength is power you shall receive
[56:25] power after the Holy Ghost has come upon
[56:27] you that has a compound meaning that's
[56:29] just like being born again that's coming
[56:32] into the body and being born again as a
[56:34] development in the body that way we
[56:37] don't have to worry about wordings and
[56:39] thoughts and ideas we can consider it
[56:44] all right
[56:46] see then brother branham in the hole
[56:49] matches your statue a perfect man I've
[56:51] asked you to read it over and over and I
[56:54] doubt most of you've read it that's all
[56:56] right
[56:56] go see that way if you don't read it now
[56:58] you're going to get a flunk when you
[57:01] come to the test yeah they used to have
[57:07] a teacher over there in Banks County was
[57:09] all life and and about it always have
[57:12] because they called her flunking Duncan
[57:14] because she was a math teacher and but
[57:18] she didn't bleh
[57:19] you didn't have no brownie points to try
[57:22] to get on her side you either got it or
[57:25] didn't get it
[57:26] but the ones that got it could go to
[57:29] college she was an algebra teacher and
[57:33] state you could go to college on what
[57:36] she had because she taught it right all
[57:40] right let's see if you don't even read
[57:42] the book now what is somebody to come
[57:43] along told her well I'm right never read
[57:46] the books he just staff here zero to
[57:47] start with she wouldn't even flew with
[57:49] you right you won't read the Bible you
[57:52] won't read the message I asked you to I
[57:56] know all about it how do you know all
[58:00] about the book I mean come on Church I
[58:07] didn't mean blame common sense I hate to
[58:10] be rough it that way but why not oh we
[58:14] know all about it they even read the
[58:17] book I don't need to read the book I got
[58:20] it myself
[58:22] you got it yourself all right
[58:26] but now I want to honestly tell you I
[58:28] don't want got you God if you got it
[58:31] yourself can I be honest with that I
[58:34] don't want what you got if you got it
[58:36] yourself because according to my Bible
[58:40] we got to have somebody to help us and
[58:42] lead us they got us injury and according
[58:47] to my understanding to the Bible you
[58:48] have to have to have somebody to teach
[58:50] you but brother Dale I got where the
[58:54] property said we don't need teachers you
[58:55] better read the rest of it he said why
[58:59] did God put teachers into the body I'll
[59:05] get around one of these days preaching
[59:06] on them predestinated fivefold ministry
[59:10] but all right listen
[59:13] do you understand then let me get this
[59:16] in a hurry then it will read a little
[59:17] bit do you understand what I'm trying to
[59:21] bring I don't ask you to believe it I've
[59:23] never asked nobody to believe anything
[59:25] I've talked I asked you to go home and
[59:28] pray about it I asked you to search
[59:31] yourself your soul searching yourself
[59:33] and search out what is saying search out
[59:37] to see if it fits or not because that a
[59:43] way it would be your experience all
[59:47] right so then all the before and all the
[59:52] after brother Branham in the after of
[1:00:01] the statue of a perfect man he's in the
[1:00:04] church age book explaining that these
[1:00:08] are one in the same he's talking about
[1:00:14] how the people are confused about when
[1:00:16] he de when he gives an altar call you
[1:00:19] ever noticed I've asked this question
[1:00:21] over wonder you thought about it it's
[1:00:25] not Rutter Branham never say it I want
[1:00:28] y'all to come up here and and and get
[1:00:31] justified you ever heard him say
[1:00:34] anything like that and then we'll put
[1:00:37] you in a room and then you can get
[1:00:38] sanctified and then we'll put you in
[1:00:40] another room you get the baptism the
[1:00:41] whole goes what do you always say come
[1:00:46] up and receive Jesus Christ right it's
[1:00:52] fine to say okay brother Dale I believe
[1:00:55] I met justification that's
[1:00:57] good because we believe in that of
[1:01:00] chopping off you Pisceans a man it's
[1:01:03] good to be talk about sanctification
[1:01:04] that's wonderful that's part of the Word
[1:01:07] of God but you just don't ask people to
[1:01:10] come up and be sanctified brother
[1:01:11] Branham didn't do those things listen to
[1:01:13] what he done from the church age book
[1:01:16] page 144 he's talking about the people
[1:01:20] and he said they misunderstood him he
[1:01:23] said my Pentecostal friends upon hearing
[1:01:25] me say this believe that I'm inviting
[1:01:27] people to come forward to be baptized
[1:01:29] with the Holy Ghost because they're
[1:01:31] already born again and remember that so
[1:01:37] when I invite those who are spirit
[1:01:39] filled to come and deal with those who
[1:01:40] have answered the invitation to receive
[1:01:43] the spirit these dear one search for
[1:01:46] word and deal with the people in such
[1:01:47] manner as to encourage them to yield to
[1:01:50] God and believe to speaking in tongues
[1:01:55] well they've got it up here so what'd he
[1:01:57] say I want to tell you exactly what I
[1:02:04] mean now this is exactly what he means I
[1:02:10] mean for the sinner to come forward and
[1:02:15] be born again which is to be baptized
[1:02:22] into the body of Christ by the Holy
[1:02:25] Ghost which is exactly what took place
[1:02:27] at Pentecost when the church was
[1:02:31] launched in other words to be born of
[1:02:34] the Spirit is to be truly baptized with
[1:02:37] the Holy Ghost it is one in the same and
[1:02:44] we can read that's after the seal I mean
[1:02:49] after the statue of a perfect man here's
[1:02:53] another one taken from God's only
[1:02:55] provided way for this day of 1964 he
[1:03:02] said that's the way out to me today not
[1:03:04] to be hurted by some denominational coup
[1:03:06] but come in the way God said come
[1:03:10] by the baptism of the holy ghost and the
[1:03:13] new birth forming revival not Church
[1:03:16] joining soliciting from door to door but
[1:03:19] of birth being born again filled with
[1:03:22] the Holy Ghost God's Way
[1:03:25] put them all three in one paragraph or
[1:03:27] one sentence that's why I believe the
[1:03:30] new birth the born-again experience the
[1:03:32] baptism of the Holy Ghost is one of the
[1:03:33] sign yeah there's three stages or phases
[1:03:39] oh great
[1:03:40] but that's justification sanctification
[1:03:42] the baptism will only go so we can say
[1:03:47] well we know he said this over here but
[1:03:49] remember what we've read in Wednesday
[1:03:51] night remember these statements of go
[1:03:54] ahead brother we're on number 10 now
[1:03:55] we'll start reading so listen to these
[1:03:59] statements in relation to the message
[1:04:06] got number 10 which is a key to the door
[1:04:10] well I told him I didn't know where we'd
[1:04:13] jump up and start absent I'd be all
[1:04:15] right
[1:04:16] so communion is for Christians that's
[1:04:19] born again of the Spirit of God and born
[1:04:23] again does not necessarily mean now that
[1:04:27] you got the whole together
[1:04:35] he's just explained you get the holy
[1:04:38] ghost as a born-again experience
[1:04:45] what's it and remember now many teach
[1:04:50] I don't know anybody teaches it like
[1:04:52] this you know as old brother organ right
[1:04:55] said that not from the pulpit here see
[1:04:57] but new birth is not the baptism of the
[1:05:01] Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't
[1:05:03] support it that sounds like he's saying
[1:05:07] something contrary how many of you mark
[1:05:11] them winds did with reading them how
[1:05:17] about it there's number ten number
[1:05:25] eleven
[1:05:28] thank you form you must be born again I
[1:05:30] suppose maybe just a little different
[1:05:32] from what the regular church teaches it
[1:05:34] I teach them to believe and believe can
[1:05:37] sufficiently proved by the scripture
[1:05:39] that you're born of the Spirit and then
[1:05:42] baptized into the body by the Holy
[1:05:44] Spirit you remember what I said
[1:05:52] Wednesday when I read that one back
[1:05:55] before and I read this when I read every
[1:05:57] one of them I said that's saying the new
[1:06:02] birth the baptism gonna hold ago in the
[1:06:06] morning in experience is the same we're
[1:06:11] gonna read this then we'll drop back
[1:06:14] number 11 number two oil taken from the
[1:06:19] message of why 62 I never thought there
[1:06:22] was a person believed like I believed
[1:06:25] till this morning I heard Charles Flores
[1:06:28] are going down he believes to that the
[1:06:30] new birth is not the baptism of the Holy
[1:06:32] Ghost the new birth is being born the
[1:06:37] Holy Ghost is a baptism that's exactly
[1:06:40] right
[1:06:43] that's not contrary that's exactly right
[1:06:47] come on you're born again at faith and
[1:06:54] then the Holy Ghost baptizes you into
[1:06:56] all of these things come on so it's not
[1:07:06] wrong roll it back down we'll get each
[1:07:07] one of them come back down to the leaven
[1:07:09] go the other way
[1:07:11] all right was he say leavin teach the
[1:07:13] specifically proof that you're born to
[1:07:15] the spirit and then baptize in the body
[1:07:18] by the Holy Spirit you're born of the
[1:07:20] Spirit of God you're born again at faith
[1:07:23] and you're baptized into all of these
[1:07:27] things each is a birth teachers are
[1:07:30] coming for okay back down to ten where
[1:07:33] will do this is what then he says but
[1:07:36] the new birth is not in the baptism of
[1:07:38] the Holy Spirit
[1:07:39] they just what we just read that the new
[1:07:43] birth is not the baptism of the Holy
[1:07:44] Spirit the scripture doesn't support it
[1:07:48] see of course what's he read communion
[1:07:52] is for Christians that's born again of
[1:07:54] the Spirit and born again does not
[1:07:56] necessarily mean that you've got the
[1:07:59] Holy Ghost you're born again right here
[1:08:03] by the baptism of the Holy go but you
[1:08:05] don't have all of these things it's
[1:08:10] simple it's not confusing this is the
[1:08:14] before and the after
[1:08:16] okay what do we got on the thirteen now
[1:08:20] twelve excuse me now bones well back
[1:08:23] down one you know the twelve okay
[1:08:27] these are why I'm against organized
[1:08:29] religion I never thought there was a
[1:08:31] person believed what we'd read that one
[1:08:33] there okay come on up now what do we got
[1:08:38] and the message questions and answers on
[1:08:40] Hebrews what does he say and by one
[1:08:43] spirit we're all baptized into one body
[1:08:46] that's correctly the baptism of the Holy
[1:08:48] Ghost is a different act from the new
[1:08:52] birth see that's exactly right
[1:08:57] you're baptized by the Holy Spirit
[1:09:00] here at your new birth that brings you
[1:09:01] into the body of Christ but then you're
[1:09:05] being born again and you're being it's
[1:09:08] birthing you into these things and it's
[1:09:11] the Holy Spirit all the way up the
[1:09:13] pyramid so you say I got it all when I
[1:09:17] got the new Merton you didn't get it all
[1:09:18] when you got the new book you just got
[1:09:21] started when you got the new birth right
[1:09:25] come on going boy
[1:09:29] this is 14 taken from you must be born
[1:09:32] again it goes to its destination you
[1:09:34] couldn't pull it if you had to that
[1:09:36] Souls got to be change here born again
[1:09:38] all right got to be changed mourned
[1:09:40] again you say what about the Holy Ghost
[1:09:42] brother branham the Holy Ghost baptizes
[1:09:44] you into the body for service but you
[1:09:47] believe until eternal life that's right
[1:09:50] you believe into eternal life you
[1:09:53] believe into the baptism when the whole
[1:09:54] go and then you're baptized into these
[1:09:56] times
[1:09:57] now watch him as he keeps on going he
[1:10:02] that hears my words and believeth on him
[1:10:03] that sent me hath eternal life you're
[1:10:05] baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body
[1:10:06] for manifestation of the guilts and so
[1:10:12] forth but you believe into eternal life
[1:10:14] for the benefit station of the yes now
[1:10:16] wait a minute but but brother Branham I
[1:10:17] thought Gibson Collins without
[1:10:19] repentance you know we just got gifts
[1:10:21] where do we read this next another one
[1:10:23] in a minute where he said you've got to
[1:10:25] be in the body to how these guilt he's
[1:10:26] talking about genuine gifts he's talking
[1:10:30] about true gifts these are true gifts of
[1:10:33] God these are true virtues they're the
[1:10:36] gifts of God
[1:10:37] that's the gifts he's talking about true
[1:10:40] gifts behind they say statue first man
[1:10:42] is that right
[1:10:43] he said the gifts without the virtues as
[1:10:45] a stumbling block that's his word
[1:10:50] come on going to the next back on the
[1:10:54] key to the door you believe into eternal
[1:10:57] life and are born-again by your faith
[1:11:00] jesus said in Saint John 5:24 he that
[1:11:04] heareth my work now watch him take this
[1:11:05] all the way back down to come back up
[1:11:08] what's it he that here at my words and
[1:11:12] believeth on him that sent have
[1:11:14] that sent me has everlasting life not
[1:11:16] the Holy Ghost just has everlasting life
[1:11:23] he's born into the family of God and
[1:11:26] then baptized with Holy Ghost with power
[1:11:31] of intelligence of faith to believe the
[1:11:35] gospel and put it to work and make it
[1:11:36] act act like a son of God you receive
[1:11:41] power by the Holy Ghost to do these
[1:11:43] things what about it
[1:11:45] come on let's read feist questions and
[1:11:50] answers now when you believe on the Lord
[1:11:52] Jesus Christ you then how the new birth
[1:11:54] when you believe on the Lord you receive
[1:11:56] and you thought a new life but it isn't
[1:11:59] the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you
[1:12:02] got the new birth when you believe you
[1:12:04] got eternal life it's a gift of God this
[1:12:06] gift to you through Sovereign Grace by
[1:12:09] accepting the gift that God is giving to
[1:12:11] you see he that heareth my word and
[1:12:14] believeth on him that sent me hath
[1:12:16] eternal life has everlasting life that's
[1:12:18] the new birth you're converted it means
[1:12:21] you've turned around but the baptism of
[1:12:25] the Holy Spirit puts you into the body
[1:12:28] of Christ subject to the gifts for
[1:12:31] service now what's this
[1:12:33] it doesn't make the baptism of the Holy
[1:12:36] Spirit
[1:12:36] watching doesn't make you any more of a
[1:12:40] Christian the baptism in the Holy Spirit
[1:12:45] don't make you no more of a Christian
[1:12:50] what is it it just puts you into the
[1:12:53] body of gifts and once you you have to
[1:12:56] be baptized into the body to possess one
[1:12:58] of these gifts they tell my genuine true
[1:13:01] ain't just give some college without
[1:13:03] repenting come on roll it up let's give
[1:13:04] you another one what we got this in this
[1:13:07] countdown and the new birth if people
[1:13:10] talks that the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:13:11] is the new birth now that's wrong he
[1:13:19] said explain he said that's wrong the
[1:13:21] baptism of the Holy Ghost is different
[1:13:23] from the new birth the new birth is when
[1:13:25] you're born again
[1:13:27] with the Holy Ghost is when power comes
[1:13:29] into that birth for service you shall
[1:13:32] receive power after the Holy Ghost is
[1:13:33] come upon you these are the things to be
[1:13:36] added after the Holy Ghost comes upon
[1:13:38] you what about it Church the new birth
[1:13:44] you have the new birth by believing by
[1:13:47] being believing on the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:49] see by having faith and accepting him as
[1:13:52] your Savior that's birth see because you
[1:13:54] passed from death unto life now I wanted
[1:13:56] to talk to you don't talk about son 5
[1:13:58] here's my words and all the Holy Ghost
[1:14:01] is power for service so when you talk
[1:14:03] about you've got to be born again and
[1:14:05] applying that to the Holy Ghost
[1:14:07] many of the Methodists they believe it
[1:14:09] this way they believe see he's taking
[1:14:11] what everybody else is believing about
[1:14:13] many were ensuing you what they're
[1:14:17] believing but it won't work all right
[1:14:19] what do we got that's 17 go ahead I read
[1:14:25] these Wednesday night but now I want to
[1:14:28] read these couple of words that they'll
[1:14:29] be with this this is off the message
[1:14:31] blasphemous ninth reason 62 and I
[1:14:34] believe the reason that there is so much
[1:14:36] confusion today about the Holy Spirit
[1:14:40] it's not correctly taught you can see
[1:14:44] what I'm just saying because the quotes
[1:14:46] I read to you would be quote used
[1:14:49] against what he had said in the
[1:14:51] beginning of what it was now what's what
[1:14:55] he says I believe the baptism is taught
[1:14:58] and just say the baptism but there's a
[1:15:00] lot goes with it you know go spark plugs
[1:15:03] and light when you talk about the
[1:15:04] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot
[1:15:06] goes with that there's a lot goes with
[1:15:08] that and here is what I think that God
[1:15:11] has proven he's proving the Holy Spirit
[1:15:13] is here alright now watch him hold that
[1:15:16] back down I don't want you to read it
[1:15:18] okay cuz we're gonna get into the statue
[1:15:21] of a perfect man with this one alright
[1:15:26] watch it now roll it up and let's get it
[1:15:29] this is from blasphemy that's not he
[1:15:33] talking about patience and testing them
[1:15:35] we're only added virtue or knowledge
[1:15:36] temperance he's up to temperance
[1:15:39] watching
[1:15:40] I still ain't got to wholly go that's
[1:15:46] what you've no holy ghost people used to
[1:15:49] prove that point there's a quote from
[1:15:52] brother Branham what's he sayin he's
[1:15:57] talk truth statue of a perfect man and
[1:15:59] blasphemy is not both that the new birth
[1:16:01] is is the eternal life and bringing you
[1:16:03] in the body of Christ why is he saying I
[1:16:06] ain't got to hold together exactly right
[1:16:09] me and you could be right here at
[1:16:11] patience and I could say brothers and
[1:16:14] sisters were born again into the family
[1:16:16] of God
[1:16:17] we're under Paul's message of the the
[1:16:20] tutor and the razor and he's to bring in
[1:16:23] us and we've come to here between got
[1:16:25] the Holy Ghost yet well you mean we got
[1:16:29] to wholly go here
[1:16:31] we ain't got the headstone yet we ain't
[1:16:35] got where he said the Holy Spirit which
[1:16:37] is the faith of the father's right no
[1:16:42] problem with him Sammy ain't got to hold
[1:16:44] egos you okay so let's go Henry what's
[1:16:53] this one now it's a birth I've been
[1:16:58] birthed into this count them into this
[1:17:00] into this into this into this and into
[1:17:03] this and there and then the love of God
[1:17:05] Christ comes down and seals all that up
[1:17:08] in me for service seven verse you know
[1:17:13] how 7 you birth but a birth means it
[1:17:16] coming forth into a birth of the word
[1:17:18] coming forth into you understand what
[1:17:20] I'm trying to say for a second Paul was
[1:17:25] teaching adoption that's what God
[1:17:29] brought to him to bring there's one
[1:17:32] stage of it going to prove it
[1:17:33] Peter was teaching the stature of a
[1:17:35] perfect man they were teaching the same
[1:17:37] time Paul said you're born as a baby
[1:17:45] then you get a tutor when you come up in
[1:17:48] your life all right
[1:17:51] and then that tutor teaches you and then
[1:17:53] the father adopts you into the family
[1:17:55] but he said you were just as much a
[1:17:57] child when he was born as you'll ever be
[1:18:00] he said your inheritance was the same on
[1:18:04] the difference was the growth
[1:18:06] development or the leadership what is
[1:18:09] Peter and then when it finishes out then
[1:18:11] he gives you the authority to write the
[1:18:13] check book he gives you puts it all into
[1:18:15] your hands what is Peter talking about
[1:18:19] add to your faith get born again in our
[1:18:22] faith add to your faith virtue and
[1:18:24] knowledge different place coming out to
[1:18:26] where the disciples were on the Holy
[1:18:29] Spirit letter and said they had I'm
[1:18:32] looking at yesterday they had these
[1:18:34] virtues but they didn't have that
[1:18:37] headstone that's what he says that's why
[1:18:44] I've always said it I've said this from
[1:18:47] day one everybody in the world 7 billion
[1:18:51] people could have the faith of the
[1:18:54] father's be a wonderful world to live in
[1:18:58] but that is not the change of the body
[1:19:01] that is not the headstone for the church
[1:19:04] that's the faith of the father's you
[1:19:06] don't hear that talk among the people is
[1:19:07] imagine we don't need to fight the
[1:19:09] father's we were up here where we're
[1:19:11] willing about faith of fathers how did
[1:19:13] you get there then brother mo tall
[1:19:17] stature a perfect man 1960
[1:19:20] I mean 1971 I was all asking we believe
[1:19:24] it accept it now how do we get it how do
[1:19:28] we get to virtues come on how do we get
[1:19:33] to virtue it's through the opening of
[1:19:37] the word that God revealed his word to
[1:19:40] us will take us up the statue of a
[1:19:42] perfect plan
[1:19:44] there's no other way of getting there
[1:19:46] it's not beating each other and we'll
[1:19:47] get patience it's through a growth
[1:19:52] development of the same thing Paul was
[1:19:54] explaining of the tutor tutor trial
[1:19:57] training the child to bring it to a
[1:20:00] place to be able to trust it same fine
[1:20:04] and they concluded it with at one time
[1:20:07] 327 Church age book this messenger
[1:20:10] Malachi 4 will do two things one turn
[1:20:14] the hearts of the children back to the
[1:20:16] faith of the father to reveal the
[1:20:19] thunders which is a revelation contained
[1:20:21] in the seven seals
[1:20:22] it'll be these divinely revealed mystery
[1:20:24] truths that literally turn our hearts
[1:20:26] back so if you want to be turned back to
[1:20:28] the face of the Father why have we
[1:20:32] turned down the seals words the people
[1:20:39] of this message preaching seals now I
[1:20:43] didn't like the statement you know cause
[1:20:46] to me brother Dale I don't like what you
[1:20:47] said why don't you tell from Adam you
[1:20:49] don't like it he was the one that said
[1:20:52] it he said these though it'll be these
[1:20:53] divinely revealed literally the revealed
[1:20:56] truths that literally turned our heart
[1:20:59] literally these teachers will tell you
[1:21:00] the word literally means what word by
[1:21:03] word word by word complete how you gonna
[1:21:08] complete the statue of a perfect man
[1:21:10] through the opening of God's Word but
[1:21:17] how many people would even read a sealed
[1:21:18] book
[1:21:19] no wonder we're here fifty years
[1:21:29] but you see Church gonna renovate a
[1:21:34] statement one time that was outstanding
[1:21:36] to me he said it would be a greater
[1:21:39] thing if everybody understood the
[1:21:41] oneness of the Godhead you remember that
[1:21:47] if everybody understood the oneness of
[1:21:49] the Godhead so they can't be to lower
[1:21:52] they can't be to this they can't me to
[1:21:54] that and come out to the right time it
[1:21:58] all comes to the breath to the point
[1:22:01] Paul and Peter was saying the same thing
[1:22:06] Paul tells you what you've got to do
[1:22:09] Peter tells you how to do it think on
[1:22:16] these things home uses think on these
[1:22:18] things
[1:22:20] revelation brings restoration but that
[1:22:30] see that's the point that I said want to
[1:22:32] go when you say you've got to have a
[1:22:35] revelation to be born again well what
[1:22:38] what do I need to how reveal to me
[1:22:43] really you need the fact of knowing that
[1:22:46] you lost that's number one and number
[1:22:50] two is the fact that you've accepted
[1:22:51] Jesus Christ as your Savior that's two
[1:22:55] pretty good revelations well that's what
[1:22:59] the whole world is based on Revelation
[1:23:02] Jesus Christ
