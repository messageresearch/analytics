there and remember that brother Claude will be here with us preaching for the weekend so remember him and pray the Lord would help and guide him uh that's right the fellowship meeting will be the third Saturday at brother Tony's down at six flights anybody wants a way to go or whatever let us know and two the internet is back up and running they got it straightened out our uh the user that we were using was up in the New York areas so when the the weather went bad it knocked us off of the live so we say welcome back to you you know you can see us now and it's kind of like brother U brother Daniel and there out in New Mexico you know was over there South Carolina and he he said well so now I get to find see a face to go with the voice that I've heard so that's pretty good we can they can get back and see our ugly face tonight see what we are so welcome but uh we appreciate this the Lord giving us all the things that's right amen remember the announcements that have been made and just pray that the Lord would bless okay Revelations 1 Revelations 6 father we thank you because we know and realize for a certainty without you there would be no we wouldn't be here there wouldn't be any problems with anything CU we would just wouldn't be here because you created us you brought us for a purpose yes and that purpose is through the point that you want to fellowship with us and we pray now that you would just come down tonight and be not an onlooker and a recorder of our Deeds but be a present help in a time of trouble to each and every one of us to be a preeminent one in our hearts and lives you said in your word that you sent your word and healed us and delivered us from destruction so we believe that now come and just open your word unto us that we may Lord be able to walk there in as we read it you come and speak to our hearts yes guide each one Lord remember all of the sick ones the requests that were made and just bless and guide each one in Jesus name amen thank everybody for praying for my sister she was better today and they're putting her back out of the IC unit back down into a regular room so just keep praying for her but the Lord would would take care of she's got pneumonia and then she got a bladder infection I think a few things but you know just pray the Lord would bless her Revelations 1 and somebody put a pointer back there in the in the office so you we can we can we can get you cuz if you go to sleep then I'll go the eyeballs I don't know who it was somebody put it in the office back there so we we got up here we'll leave it lay laying up here to be able to be used okay amen the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John who by record of the word of God and of the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand we keep reading Revelations 1 for one purpose to keep in your mind one thing the Bible is the revelation of Jesus Christ it's not the revelation of the Antichrist it's not the revelation of who's going to be president and we got one now and whatever but you know it's the revelation of Jesus Christ all right so then that's the point that we keep reading that now we're over in the fifth seal so we'll go to Revelation 6 verse 9- 11 and when he had opened the fifth seal now remember there was no combat Beast under this fifth seal because the combat beast of the fourth seal was the eagle which would be the prophetic gift that was given unto us in the last days through a man to be able to speak to us what the word of God is all right so now our dependence is upon the fourth combat Beast right MH which is the Eagle which is to be in was in a prophet to bring us a message brother brandom now it's here to be in you and I Amen to interpret those things to each one of us all right now so it said and when he had open the fifth seal I saw under the altar The Souls of them that were slain for the word of God and for the testimony which they held MH and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord holy and true do thou not judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the Earth and white robes were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season now you remember how we brought that out we'll refer to it again in a minute white robes are given unto them evidently here mhm then we'll read the prophet word before the 144,000 are killed that's right so you know where is it done at and what's happens there and what is their Redemption that's what we were talking about the other day the white roads were given unto every one of them and it was said unto them that they should rest yet for a little season until their fell servants also and their Brethren that should be killed as they were should be fulfilled you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we spent the whole service both of them there Sunday speaking about how that the this fifth seal shows us a great Revelation remember the prophet said there's a lot of things here to be made known here all right and one of them was that he said it done away with soul sleeping all right you said well that's just a a Doctrine but to me it's the greatest understanding of what your soul really is that's in the scriptures I mean I I say that without backing up that you know to me it is now to show me that see I can look there and see Souls of them not bodies of them not people right standing there you know but that soul of the individual that was killed down through there those those Jews and and it was coming down through ikan and Hitler not your 144,000 and not the Old Testament Jew because they have their Redemptive plan they had the blood of bulls and goats and it was sufficient and then when Jesus Christ came proving it was sufficient he went down preach of the spirits or souls in prison came back up and picked up the Old Testament Saints with him correct all right so then that way you know we can see that that the soul is the real you amen uh you know you say but but brother Dale why is it so important to understand something like that uh we're just a body Spirit Soul that's what it takes to make us that's true I'll give you quotes for it if you want um paragraph 157 questions and answers 1961 where brother R says you're a body spirit and soul that's what you are right man that's fine all right but then I want to ask you a question if we don't see how to divide between the parts or whatever you want to call them Body Spirit Soul whatever you want to say how to divide that you know if you don't understand that how are you going to understand any form of redemption right right cuz you just say well well we're just what does it matter we're just to be who would you agree that after you're born again that you still do wrong amen yes sir will you agree amen will you agree that you even sin right sure absolutely we going to give a quote the prophet just in a minute so you better shake your head uhhuh you know that's a good amen you know about two or three nods you know so then what part of you is it that's doing the sin that's right if you're just a unit of Body Spirit and soul without dividing it and understanding what is taking place then what part of you are sinning right see then a smart addict like me comes along and says I can prove by the prophet that if you Sin from your soul you're not born again right right right so then I think it's very very vital to break it down amen and understand the real you and what it is and what's taking place and how that you can actually profit do you sin he said every day now is he using that word sin as a disbelieving God's word or is he using it as we were trying to express especially down in the Bible study the other night about Paul and the things I would I do not the thing I do would not Etc you know so he said with the inward man I saw that serve the law of God the outward man I serve the law of the flesh right amen and brother R said that's not talking about living under adultery and and running around and all the it's just simple natural life things right MH you know not great big things but it's still sin right so then if we if we're just what do we need to know because we're just you know what does it matter I'm just a I'm a unit myself well what sinning right that's right MH you it's your body it's it's your spirit it's it your soul now when we were Sinners we was a unit of sin right right that's right before we was born again we was a complete unit of sin Body Spirit and soul that's right amen but when I got born again which didn't get born again in our body didn't get born again in our spirit got born again in our soul that's right see then the Soul sealed in so the sin can't be from the soul right that's right it has to be the human reasoning factors of mankind the things that we are and the things that we are human beings and I said we shouldn't even be dealing with that's when you say sin people sin your Prophet said it we'll read it in a minute did he send every day right y well he didn't really mean that I don't have the ability to divide between what he meant and what he didn't mean right amen that's right I just take what he said amen and believe now in doing that then the Soul is the real you because the soul lives on when your body rocks in the grave right and your spirit goes back to God who gave it amen mhm now but the soul lives on what we went through there Sunday the soul is what's going to have to be judged amen the white thr own judgment right sure they'll be back there in their bodies and things because that's necessary but the soul is what the Bible said the soul that sinth y it shall die right amen Bible says don't Fe fear them that can destroy these bodies and things but fear him that can destroy the soul because only God can destroy a soul and we'll read in a minute where only God can create a soul Satan can't create that's where we took what man has said and just listened to it and then got it all mixed up in our minds and Tangled Up in our thoughts until we can't come out with a Clarity of even thinking brother I've always this this that you you just sin well then you're lost right right exactly you need to be an alter Amen to get something straight why because we got the Bible we got the prophet's message and we don't have to worry about what's going on we have the answer right we have the prophet said Satan's answer yes sir what the revealed word amen right that's the answer to all things is the revealed word see but you say what but Brother D it takes Body Spirit and soul to make me that's that's right it does but let's do what the scripture says go ahead and let's get started with a few quotes let's go ahead and bring up number one look what the scripture says the scripture says in Hebrews 4:12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharp than a two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing and Sun of Soul and Spirit that's correct and other joints and Myers and a discerner of the thoughts is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart how much greater could that be the word of God will divide see we couldn't divide it no even though Scofield the writers and things will cover Body Spirit and soul right but you'll find most of them say saying Body Soul spirit all right brother Rand went with that until the late later part of his ministry and then you'll see him change over to Body Spirit and soul because he seen the real soul and what it was when he went beyond the curtain of time he didn't see spirits right he's so Soul under the altar M but you see we get so revelated until somebody says something my computers go we come up with quotes you know see brother random didn't have to straighten out anything on when he was saying Body Soul and Spirit that's right making his Spirit to Center him and then come later and say Body Spirit and soul because he never changed the senses right of any of those three right he always gave the outside whatever you want to call it five senses C SPI smell here gave the second real memory reason conscious affection Love Etc the soul was only one sense either Faith or not or The Sinner you see as the word begin to unfold unto him he could see what a real man is yeah right as we covered in the fourth seal that only the prophet would know what the word death would mean so we see it under the fifth seal that only the prophet would know what life is amen you remember when when he went to those the guys they put the things on him you know M testing him for something and they said it's amazing said your conscious and subconscious right together that you could dream a dream and be wide awake well then he began to explain right and I'm sure they sat there in amazement yeah right your seventh grade education man explain what they' studied all of their life to try to figure out right but yet put it in so small a terms or you know so perfect until they can understand that he knew what he was talking about oh yeah see so the scripture says that we can divide between we can show the difference between as I said see he said but why do we need to know that well then which one sins right correct is it's the body it's the spirit it's the soul all right so look what he says on 1 a go ahead brother I had to add a lot to these cuz studying it and then give thought and then run back and I wrote the notes for this and three times I think but listen to what he says Hebrews chapter 6 book two or part two 262 now we got that this morning how that we are perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blindess not one sin on us amen are you above Temptation never do you sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected because we are in him and God can no more judge us than nothing right couldn't be righteous he's already judged Us in him when he judged Christ he judged me and he judged you and he can't judge you can't judge me again because he took my judgment amen if I've been redeemed right amen if the soul of the individual is redeemed that Soul cannot sin right but if it did it' be destroyed amen the soul that sinth it shall die but you see then we look at it and we see ourselves and and we see what's doing it we can't help we're in a world we have to eat we have to sleep we have to do that's right and the new birth didn't take away your caste feel smelling here no right said I used to love the honey he said I still love to hunt M amen all right but see then your memory reasoning conscious and thing is not born again right I wish it was amen man said when time we need a baptism of the Holy Ghost in the brain I I amen him but we need it I just don't believe we can get it yeah right that's a different story but what he said I amen cuz I believe we need a good brain if anything we can get we need a brain transplant right yeah but see that don't work just because you got born again didn't do away with your memory that's right right you then you still do wrong with that part all right but now think about it as a Christian when you do wrong what is the part of you that's doing wrong so if we don't divide between them then we don't know what we're doing that's right so that's just putting it on Plain language all right see I want to know the truth that's right right right cuz the truth should set you free all right now whether it sets you free or not he really done a great thing to help me to see what part of me is what I am you know the real me because that way I can see what's going on and then if I have a dirty thought brother I don't never have no dirty thoughts you're a liar right solve the problem you're lied that's right Jesus had dirty thoughts but he didn't entertain them he was tempted in all points as we are yet without sin if you don't entertain the thought as your old saying goes you can't help the bird flying over your head but you can keep it from building a nest in Your Heart Right a thought comes to you you can't help a thought coming to you right correct you know that's right when you go out there now you have to look up all the time you know what women would do they get up on the top look down on you so that's all the problem come on and women just as mad so all right I'm W to find out how to be red amen amen well I just got the new bird well Glory Hallelujah there's a lot left in her you just started your journey right that's right see then to see what's going on then I can find the day that I'm living in and find the truth right so the fifth seal to me is the greatest understanding of what a real true person is because these people they still have memory reason conscience Etc right they still desire Revenge yep we know it's not the bride but they still have those things work Souls right Souls but you see we just get a thought in our mind and we conop an idea and we say well this is the way it is it's all right if that's the way it is right but if it's not that way what have we done amen right we didn't understand anything about a b a human being until the prophet begin to teach us right no that's right but now we're beginning to understand and it's out throughout of the word I mean throughout the word but yet there was covering our Sunday David said my soul my soul First Act thee brother said you can be anointing in that Spirit right and even love God that's right anointed on your spirit and even love God about and die and go to hell but he said if that soul is the part that God solds in prison that God is trying to work on the Statue of a perfect man is not buil in your body It Is manifested by your body amen it's not built through your memory reason conscious affection through your second realm it's in the middle part of you the man the real you see then in that we can come down and understand why the prophet would be saying and trying to help us to understand right now I keep putting these back on you may get tired of me rereading but remember we're speaking out to an internet World also right but it might not be the internet I'm trying to read these in might be you amen if you think you don't need it then you are the one I'm talking about is that sensible right that's right there's no need of playing games that's right so let's see what the Prophet who is these The Souls of them I want you to notice this part but we'll get back into it in a minute brother Ram uses Souls under the altar 40 something times 18 times after he went beyond the curtain of time just because he said Souls under the altar he says the scripture says it there's no scripture says Souls under the altar right the Bible is saying that but there's no scriptural words it says Souls of them right yeah but brother Ram can use that for the Bride of sold under the altar sure no problem with him why because it's not getting confused with the fifth seal right it's sold under the altar what do you think the briide of Jesus Christ is right now amen sure right we good to the minute where brother R said he referred to this scripture who he the angel of the Lord that was with him beyond the curtain of time right so this because you read Souls under the altar is not always talking about fif seal Jew that's right cuz it doesn't say Souls under the altar right it says it right right because these souls are under the altar but they're not under the altar of Jesus Christ they're not the martyrs of the early church ages that the Israel to be saved as a nation amen we didn't even know that was in there at all did we until the Prophet came along and said it but then we can go into Paul and read it could we amen look what he saids on the fifth seal and this time if you notice this feel still being open the church is gone it just can't be to sold under the the early church and now please if you ever did give this attention now cuz this is a great controversy so I want you to listen real close you got your papers and things and write with and I want you to notice now these cannot be Souls under the altar because Souls of the of the righteous martyred and the righteous people the church the Bride As done been took up so they wouldn't be under the altar they'd be in glory with the rde right see we're under the altar of God until the Rapture if you die you go under the altar beyond the curtain of time right throw under the altar in the Z Dimension all right now see theyve being low that gone in Rapture the fourth chapter why are these Soul then that's the next thing who are are they then if they are not their early church this is Israel that's to be saved as a nation all of them that are predestinated that's Israel that's Israel right not every Israelite we've been through that the predestinated only those whose names remain on The Book of Life amen all right now then just think about it how did he get to her now I'm just not playing by rereading I'm trying to drive down into your thinking I I like to preach that way I I like to talk to the real youth I hate talking to bodies right I mean you can and I look at me and green and be be totally indifference of agreement right I me you yep I've talk to preachers like that it didn't make no difference what I said they wouldn't agree with nothing but see if I can talk to that inward part of you amen amen that's right one of two things is going to happen yep one you're going to get mad as a hornet and get up and leave or two you're going to search out whether you're born again or not and see whether the truth is right or not that's right cuz I'm talking to the real you I ain't talking to the bodies I look at right the bodies I look at are very deceptive right but if the word is correct that we read at the beginning of Hebrews 4:12 was it only for the prophet that it could discern between or was it for all of the Bride of Jesus Christ amen that that word is to discern the difference between our soul and our spirit right and expose us we certainly don't want to be as the one we were referring to the other day of the lady that after all of her life teaching Sunday school Etc you remember she come up to the time she's dying right you remember she called a preacher said you've lied to me he said give her another hpo instead of trying to convert her to get her to be saved or even pray whether he want to why cuz she was exposing him amen you know what brother R said her real Soul come up before her and she realized she was lost amen right but not David a man without the baptism of the Holy Ghost right his soul longed after God why wasn't any mortal why does a heater and a hot and toter anywhere you want to be why is he worshiping the Sun the moon the stars the animals trees and things right CU he's got a soul right oh yeah that's right he don't have a soul a soul is what he is right am what I told you years ago when they had all that two Soviet this going on and I started preaching about that God was a soul amen boy I got a lot of difference in that but I still stand with it amen the prophet said he sent back his soul on the de Pentecost in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen why was it in the Old Testament they couldn't get born again yep they could be anointed on their Spirit right right right with a genuine holy spirit because there was nothing to get into their soul because the animal didn't have a soul right amen there was no life back there that could come into the individual right and convert that Soul that's right right see that was what the two Soul people said said Satan gave you a soul and God gave you one that would make him a Creator and Satan can't create how many quotes you want I was looking last night at or not before last one one morning it's 40 or 50 times that brother R says Satan cannot create yep right amen but yet people will still quote that that Satan gave you a soul he perverted the nature of your soul right when he come in the garden there Adam and Eve was perfect and right amen right he attacked that to pervert that's right then when everything it was born from that time on was perverted that's right yep that's why we need a new birth I believe am that's right not to change a Doctrine you believe a different Doctrine or believe the prophet amen but if you're not born again it won't do you any good no the prophet said the baptism of the Holy Ghost was the most important thing in your life that's right amen amen I got it brother Dale I just don't agree with you on what you all right unless I'm right right that's right that's true that's right if I'm right you show me where you got a right to differ with me you might may not like my presentation you know but what's the difference in the word right a dumb donkey preached A good sermon one day right amen that's right right but listen Church the soul is the real you so these Souls of them that were slain they're there mhm waiting for that 144,000 to be killed yep and they're given white robe somewhere prior to the death of 144,000 that's what we just read in the Bible amen he said where did they get it I told you I don't believe you can put the phal Jew at the white Throne no well brother there that's where I v I did well I've always believe I always believe the white Throne is where they got the white robes right according to the Bible right no right not right amen that's right and you show me in where in the prophet's message that he puts the philal Jew at the white Dr right well I don't care I still believe it that's that's what I mean see it's because of what you've been taught amen amen there's one thing about it I'm glad to always say hey I was wrong come on that's right I was wrong on that FAL youw but I believe they had to go to the white Throne to get eternal life right and if they do have eternal life how are you going to put them at life from no if they get eternal life prior to the White how can you send them ain't nobody going into the white Throne of eternal life come on I don't like you cuz you don't leave me no leway amen I got a right to think Constitution mhm yeah Bible no that's right Bible don't give us right to think at all that's right righten but listen he said that these still seal Jew was sold under the altar after the church was done gone Souls under the altar y go ahead to the next brother one see the F seal paragraph 252 and 253 yes they held for the word of God they were Jews they had their law they stayed with it you remember last night now they stayed with that they were Jews and had the law and the law was the word of God they stayed right by it that's right and for the testimony they held they were martyred and here was sold under the altar after the church had been gone and watch they had in their blindness Marty to Messiah and now they were reaping for it they realized it they recognized after it was gone on they seem then when they come before the altar of God what right when they come before that altar but now the grace of God is to them they get white robes MH right right it's given unto them didn't say anything about they deserved them earned them or anything fact didn't want them that blown enough they didn't want them they don't want Jesus Christ we know what it is once been killed down to the time of Hitler and heightman brother said those killed from the cross until the going up to the church that's the phal Jew not every Jew he said we done been through that now listen when they come before the altar of God but now the grace of God is to them now watch now they could not by no means be Saints because they would already be robed y we get our here right the new birth right but here they are now just sold Under The Altar for the word of God and the testimony the hell are being God's people the Jews but now watch the grace of God comes to them and Jesus gives them each one a white robe watch come over after the church is gone and that's what I was saying the other day see when they got killed there thousand years ago that didn't give them white robes that put them where they were at one day they'll be given white ropes we get down to it where brother R said they got it under the seventh seal all right because they were loyal to their cause and they were blind they didn't know it they didn't know it they were playing exactly the part that God had ordained for them to play and here here John looks over and sees see Souls Under The Altar and watch he sees those Souls watch what he calls them they cry how long now read your scripture and they cried with a loud voice saying how long oh Lord right now to avenge you see the bride can cry how long MH sure we'll get to that in a few minutes the Bri could cry along that doesn't put them in the fifth seal there is no scripture that says Souls under the altar the blood R cover sold under the altar if he'll sealed you it said sold of them but you follow me that somewhere they're going to get eternal life right and when they do y I tell you what when you give that F sealed you eternal life he will no longer want revenge amen nobody that's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost Wants Revenge that's right M we turn the other cheek we don't want revenge right we want to pray for people amen not Revenge all right so the F seal shows The Souls of them and the prophet will call them Souls Under The Altar and they have their feelings or beings or things they're in a what they're in a body they're in a Celestial body theophany what else you going to put them in but you see we never considered Redemption for the Jew that's where our trouble is today to try to believe it I'm talking about a fth seal Jew of people that rejected Jesus Christ we would never Tau that it's not in any of our teachings of organized religion no we talked about 144,000 we had that confused to saying it was a bride the church what is a real Soul that's right what about a soul being so important until God himself came down and took upon flesh right to yield his soul up right y that it could save that person amen that's right I thought we just got the baptism of the Holy Spirit now where' you get the thought from you got it from a denomination of Pentecostal idea yeah the soul is a real you amen MH right that's where I used to think beyond the curtain of time and all I I didn't read all of that and understand even though I read it and I thought the soul would not have any sense in it but I had to correct that CU you Prophet when he got there and seen those Souls under the altar they had their sense of feeling talking right all kind of things see we better correct as he preaches it brings it to us right that many preachers going to get up and tell you I wrong here right no all right now let's get into the thought that was page one let's go to number two we using 1 2 3 we brought this out the other day but I want you to think about it message called Faith 61813 paragraph 5 when you die your soul will go into the under the altar of God m not in see right in the presence of God cuz it doesn't go up right in see not in it don't go right you remember brother Brandon right I want to see Jesus he's higher right right that can be called the presence of God no problem but when you die you don't go right into the presence of God you go under the altar what a great Christ to be amen now your spirit will go to God but you cannot come back you remember in the Bible it said the spirit the Soul's under the altar crying Lord how long how long they could not return until the scriptures fulfilled and like Christ could not return until the scriptures fulfilled then after the all has been done all their sufferings over and the Brethren has suffered the same thing where we suffered like they suffered and so forth then on that day you'll know exactly where you you're buried your spirit will be turned loose from God and will come to the soul now the soul is that part of you who knows and understands your intelligence right amen you remember the vision Now where's he going beyond the curtain of time right y you remember the vision I had not long ago or the little translation and went into that place and saw those people now your spirit will come back to that body and that that kind of a body the soul which is a body that does not have to eat and so forth is the there the Tabernacle be dissolved right you talk a Celestial body we have one already waiting a Celestial body and that spirit and that soul and Celestial body you rise up again this Natural Body by that great Millennium now think about it the soul is a real you amen that's what God is trying to save is the soul because if the soul can be saved the body and spirit will have to follow that's right amen and we got a lot of people that are in church because of Mom and Daddy somebody telling them are scaring I always told you don't try to scare your kids with a go that God don't like you get them a weapon they'll find out God loves them but you might not like them that's what you're afraid of see you use a crutch of something and try to tell them God don't like for you to do that you're trying to scare them right right brother said don't go down there and tell that person you need to come to the altar he said you'll make them a two full child of hell you need that quote going to be harder to try to be saved after then why because you've embarassed them I've been there done that had them to come and talk to me try to get me to come to church I told them I lived a better life and their Deacon board did and I certainly didn't want nobody to question me because i' rolled it out in front of them I had to get over the church to be able to get saved right the good religious people don't you want them saved brother T right go down there and get them and lead them up to the altar no it looks good don't it H now I'm not your Prophet so you argue with him he said it'd be harder to get him the alter than next time that's right right that's right now you can go toe and try to scare hell out of them all you want to it ain't going to work but that body that soul is that celestial all right go ahead and pull up the scripture we'll cover this while we at it second Corinthians 5 for we know that our Earth if our Earthly House of this Tabernacle now I looked up the word house I'm trying to cover it in many ways to make sure to to get an understanding or a better way of saying it and really the more it leans back to saying we know if our Earthly tent tent right tent y body see Earthly House of this Tabernacle were dissolved this part here the tent you live in what does it say we have a building of God and house not made with hands Eternal to heaven now why is he emphasizing that you going to have to think with a little bit we explain caral I guess but you know Mom and Daddy formed us do I need to go into any more of that language to get to you through intercourse they brought us into being y they framed us not made with hands is going into heaven not made by anything that we do on Earth to bring children you know see cuz the other is got to be in heaven Eternal in the heavens right but see that's where everybody does it they say see there we got we had eternal life always have had eternal life we don't need to be saved now show me where the Prophet said that I want to quote just one where the Prophet said you didn't need to be saved but that's why people preach right for in this we grown this body earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from Heaven if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked for we know that for we that are in this Tabernacle new Grown being burden not far that we would be unclothed but clothed upon y that mortal might be swallowed up of life amen you said but it says we have eternal life God before the world yep in his mind knows he will have eternal life and he won't that's right he doesn't have any problems with it right but I thought we had to receive eternal life amen I've never understood anything else amen than the fact that we must be born again amen because if not then Jesus would have said to Nicodemus he said Nicodemus what you need to realize is you always was eternal yeah right you see that's where the people of this message are trying to bypass the new birth right do away with the new birth always was eternal always was eternal I don't need Jesus what did he die for right don't you see that what Paul is saying that we have one Eternal in the heavens right is the positive of God's mind about us right that before the foundation of the world he could look down through time and see every person that would ever be saved amen and you can write your name y in the Lamb's Book of Life before you ever got here but does that do away with us coming here and receiving it no what Mortal being would have any thoughts of that idea that's right What Mortal human being could ever think of the fact of being as Eternal as God is without receiving his life right without an impartation without a Calvary right God could anoint those people in the Old Testament do great works sure but he couldn't bring eternal life but on the day of Pentecost he brought him eternal life am right only those whose names were written in the lounge Book of Life The Eternal section right receive the new birth on the day of Pentecost right yep I thought we believe the Bible that said in the last days he pour out his Spirit upon All Flesh does that mean all flesh is saved the Bible says that see it can anoint you all of your life and you die and go to hell right right if you're born again I don't get nothing out of these parts to you I want you to understand that Hallelujah I'm one person that believes you must receive eternal life in your soul to have it right and to do that in this day you must go through justification sanctification and the baptism of the Holy Ghost not just walk up and Shake Hands R said very few people would believe all the way right unto receiving the baptism is the Holy Ghost right why because they're not taught correctly amen I went off the internet the other day and a brother was talking about how knew now what the new birth is he said don't quit preaching keep on going right that's right he said I seen because I've never been Tau hallelujah thank you Father how can you get something that you're not taught about no home eternal life yes he said but yet it says there pull that back up brother it says there that we have one Eternal in the heavens sure I'm certainly not an English major and people around the world are having trouble interpreting what I say you know my old country flly and I'm sorry I just didn't get no education I was out digging ters and playing a mu when I was 7 years old trying to make a living God blessed us right but look read it we got a school teacher said back here she's not too good on English either ask my daughter but listen far we know where that okay far we know mhm that if right man that means you don't have it why would be if right no not to say before we know what we have right Watch what it says for we know that if question our Earthly House of this Tabernacle were y now is were that's pist tense word right right right we isolved we have a building of God in a house not made with hands Eternal in the heavens that's right mhm when you come to Earth and received eternal life that if and were passed away right and you now have eternal life amen and as Faith at the bottom of the pyramid is a new birth which your soul is not complete no right it only has the earnest but and love which is The Headstone is a positive amen the bottom is a negative and the top is the positive partial or perfect if you don't work like the word negative and positive partial and perfect so if I die the Split Second I die I step right into that being that I am right that is found me here right amen right that's right now I'm done I'm not going to get to it to the light but that's why I believe page 80 of the Hebrew Book when the prophet of God says your soul is your theophany right amen if you'll notice Sunday all the way through I was only speaking of a soul not speaking of whether it was born again or not using the prophet to show you what happens when it's born again a sinner a sinner yep when he dies y sure when his Earthly House of his Tabernacle is dissolved he has one true yep but it's not Eternal right amen right that's right what his soul is he has a terrestrial I mean a Celestial body a soul and can even be called a theoy brother around used it right because theop means a body of a deity right and if your soul is born again that's right deity lives in you am right right your soul then is the place position or whatever you'll call it for that God to live in that's right Amen brother R said it's you and him together and our as persons right amen that's what he says I thought that throw me out and put him in where'd you get that you got that from the two whole idea right I done live down to all of it I knew the man and knew his Doctrine that's where you got the idea from that thing's all over the world then there's no difference in two souls or two Lords right cuz if you got two Souls you got to have two Lords mhm that's right you're Soul before you're born again is the habitational place of your deity which is the devil thank you thank you thank you before you're born again right he's your God Amen yep you're the body he inhabits right but then when you get born again amen when you get born again your soul is then your theophany don't worry about that I've taught that 40 years I'd like for you show me something different yeah but Brother D the no that's what I mean you going to get your definition instead of saying the soul is the real you whether you're saved or lost and while you was lost you had a God but his name was Satan right did not Jesus say the unclean Spirit goeth out of a man y right who was Jesus talking to right when when he said Satan get behind me come on that's right who was he talking to when he said you are of your father right the devil right see what Satan done he perverted the nature of your soul your soul I preached on this for 40 years your soul is created of God we'll get to it in a All Souls are created of God Satan can't create but when that Soul comes in there God can't create a soul imperfect amen now I didn't use the word Eternal I used the word perfect when your soul is created a little baby is perfect that's right his soul is perfect but he looks up in the hospital room and he can't understand what's going on and he hears a NES talking about here it is the full moon and look at the blanketly blanket all these kids are coming into the world first little thing that little person hears is bad language Satan perverts you makes your soul a nature of the devil right why wouldn't your body died your spirit didn't die your soul didn't die was the nature of your soul is what dies that Soul's in prison amen right he said the nature of your soul is God if you're born again said if not it's of the world M you see why we have to have eternal life that's right brother D I thought I had eternal life going to come in the message show me where the Prophet talked at you've been taught that by people that's planted these things into your mind and brother Dale's a hateful an old dude for exposing it the churches you come from you want to set in my office after it's over with the churches you come from I'll take one at a time with you and show you what they were teaching and you shouted Glory Hallelujah thinking it was the word of God you think I'm love to call I can I'm a human being I love people amen but I love my God more I don't compromise my kids my wife my grandkids or nobody they got to be born again just like I I got to be born again right right they got to receive Jesus Christ just exactly like every person's ever born again is got to do but it's not in your body not in your spirit you said but brother Dale I love God said you going to love God every day your life and die and go to hell cuz you love with your spirit right come back and read the message you know but brother you yeah I know it I'm sorry not sorry for what I say but sorry for being understood misunderstood the way I try maybe to present things the brother R said if you do it too soft he said they'll think you trying to pull something over on them well you know for certain that I'm not trying to pull nothing over on you I'm a human mortal you've been out there with me we hunt together we Face together we're mortal beings but there is a God right who wants to come down and save every one of us but if we keep believing we're already Sav what can he do for us that's right but brother so and so says you Matter's where you go what does the Bible say I don't know I never read it well then you're a poor excuse of a Christian oh my that's what I told us told you before we went over y to that meeting on the Daniel 70 weeks I said if there 30 preachers there 20 of them won't even never even read a Daniel 70 weeks book none of them will hardly have a drawing that R around them of the Daniel 70 weeks that was exactly the way it was right but yet they could straighten us out I think it's this way didn't even drawing brother put out a big fancy drawing it's on your computer showing 69 and a half weeks and then the Rapture and then a half week over here yeah brother Aaron sent him a copy of the original 70 weeks drawing yeah his comment was I've seen it that's all now his drawing won't fit nothing but around talk that's right but yet absolutely that's his idea amen and we think the devil's not still alive MH Mery listen folks even after we're born again we got a lot of problem with the devil because all of the property you're looking at belong to him right and my memory reason conscious and affections still gives him the ability to be able to tangle me in all kind of pieces of course you're so wonderful and sweets you don't have any trouble you say brother Dale why don't you preach on this Saturday out when I try to preach on this sat y I get in trouble because I get down too hard listen Church there's no leway in this time that's right closeness horseshoes y not in the gospel don't work where Telly he's mighty good ringing them morees shoes you put one on there and he put one on top of you and then turn right around and stack the third one on top the second one on top of that I like nobody like him when he out cuz he's good that's right yes sir but that's closeness but in the gospel there is no closeness amen no Lord no this message is either right or it's wrong amen right you show me where the Prophet was wrong MH I've asked that come on Amen on the internet I'm asking that amen they kept talking about the church age book that there's like 30 something and one them said 17 things in the church a book that was wrong I've challenged you come and show me where say right amen well you won't listen to us I didn't say that I said come and show me it' be left up between you know me to find out whether you're right or wrong cuz I like to study it out with the Lord but you see people don't like somebody to be like that they don't how somebody's all messed up with dates and times and seasons and predictions and then change it make another one change it make another one if it don't work out here they make another one and he a there with somebody straight and Stern and say show it to me I don't like that [Music] why the soul is the real you folks y amen

228 you see a tree struggling try to live that means there's a tree that don't die you see a man struggling for life it shows that there's a tabernacle with waiting somewhere that don't die y if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting the good Heavenly Father permitted me to walk beyond that curtain one day and see it right and listen to him and many heard that the looking

center of the universe amen you can think all you want to about what's up on the moon and Mars and Jupiter whoever what it is going to come here one day cuz this is where God wants to be with his bride that's right Ezekiel 18 so4 says behold All Souls are mine as the soul of the father so also the soul of the son is mine a soul that sinth it shall die that's right not the spirit not the pull up number nine brother I bypassed a couple of them this is demonology preach 1953 608 paragraph 27 but your souls were made up before the foundation of the world mhm yep amen when God created man in his own image when did God create man in his own image down in the garden he yeah you real good you got that before the world in his mind right All Souls were created before the foundation of the world now see what we want to read there we want to read that like this but only the born again Christian Souls made up for the foundation World M now you're out the scripture cut all soul mind that's right right thank you Jesus a sinner his soul sure is in the image of God right right sure thank you Father brother Randon will even call it Immortal referring to a sinner that's where people don't read they only read what a little bit they want to read your souls were made up for the foundation of world when God created man is own image Spirit of man not a man in His image but man in his own image you see what he's saying there right not a man not one man you know what is in our English language man mankind means everybody women men whatever when you say man right or you say mankind even a sinner has an ability to yep take things and change it sure bring it into another form create as we would want to call it with using the terms Loosely cuz God's the only Creator but mankind takes what God has given him puts it together you want to ride home tonight don't you you don't want to walk home do you the man made a car y you know Thor made the wheel enough you old you ain't old enough y'all ain't old enough to know what I just said you don't even know what I said Thor made Thor's in the BC comic book right that's then he chiseled out the wheel and stood on the axle and [Music] Rod I said you ain't old enough but listen church I don't have time to continue the thought we beat up next time next Wednesday I guess but your soul is the real you right and sure if I die there's one way they going to make what eternal life right but if I'm born again I have eternal life amen I don't get eternal life by going there if I don't have eternal life here I'm going to have to be given eternal life some work you agree amen but if I possess eternal life in my soul then everything from here to Eternity is mine Satan can't get to me right he can beat this to death right he can twist it up warp it up he can do what he wants to but he can't get that Soul right amen nope I'd like to quote you one scripture and then you'll see where I'm going later on bless thou will not leave thy soul in Hell nor suffer th Holy One to seek corruption I quoted the scripture wrong that's how easy it is to pull things over on you yep any of you know where I quot it wrong th shalt not leave my soul in Hell neither suffer thy Holy One to seek corruption a lot of difference in my and th right right the Miss David got in the spirit one day and cried that out right man will not leave my soul in hell right you said well that was only prophecy of Jesus David am his soul ain't never been in hell that's right thou shallal not leave my soul in hell yes why cuz that's exactly where Jesus went when he died right are you listening when Jesus died his soul his theophany his person of his being went to hell M so that's only referring to him come on no I told he went there to pay the price MH I thought that he brought up all the Old Testament Saints right not all CU it's got to be somewh I don't understand I can't preach on it so that's all right but he brought up a lot of the Soul that were in Paradise right right and took them up open up the Everlasting Gates so the king of glory come who is the king GL the Lord Mighty host no he C him in right right the Abraham and Sarah the prophet would refer to it and say when they resurrected there he said Sarah we got to get out of here we've been recognized right well now nobody didn't know what Sarah and Abraham looked like so it was that they had pictures of them and they they were recognized as being recognized as being something Supernatural was taking place right Abraham and Sarah could just walk right through the wall walk right to walk out in the midair people probably looking around see them there something different about them people you didn't know what Abraham and Sarah looked like no said they said we got to get out of here they going to recognize around said his soul went to hell yeah and preached to the souls in prison Y and he tells you who they were y it was not my soul right because the Bible tells you who they were those who were disobedient in the longsuffering the days of Noah right now why does it say that that why did it why did it just deal with that only that part of the people it only names the people in the days of Noah that's the only ones Jesus had to testify to Y that's right because once Abraham came you had to buz on Abraham right that's right right those people had a Redemptive plan back there mhm right he was looking forward to Calvary right amen but they had a place to go to Y Jesus went down and he preached to the souls that were in prison they were disobedient it was just that group there because in the days of Noah which was 2,000 years years there was not a a prophet testimonial form until you coming on over to Noah you know you got Enoch and he is but he was very little we had to go there and tell him brother said he went there and told him said I'm the seed of the woman I'm I'm the seed of the woman that you turned down right he didn't bring them people out of hell mm-m he condemned them right they stay there until judgment but he come back down come back up by Paradise amen knocked on the door come on get the message uh countdown listen to it Abraham looked out there and said saah come here said that's a man we fed to C to y m he had a witness y Ezekiel y he a will in the middle of the way all of those prophets saw him as they preached him right Moses saw him as the I am that was in the birded bush they saw him that if they preached it come on come on but he appeared to those people he appeared as mesed to Abraham in a theoy that's right you agree if you don't go to hood as mzed y he appeared to Moses in a burning bush he appeared to those people see then when he raised them he didn't have to go preach to him right he just went there and they knew who he was right oh one of these days Luther's going to raise and you say there's the judg of my faith that's the way that I preached Wes say there's sanctification I preached it to the people amen Pentecostals would say there's the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's what we believe amen but those end time people that have to die and go by the grave can say there is the word of God that that messenger brought to us than but some of us are going to have to be we're not going to die I say us cuz I testify that I'm not saying the Lord told me I'm saying I'm testified right and until I die that's my testimony I ain't going to die he said if you do what we going to do don't credit on my Tombstone I'm dead right I'm going to be saying how long how long L yes Lord hallelujah hallelujah I to make a joke to make a point he was talking about cremating a person the other day and I told him I said I want them to cremate me when I die and I want my wife to set me on the fireboard because I can ra lay and look around and see what she's doing oh I either put me out in front of a deer stand and let the grass grow oh my I didn't come into this thing to die that's right amen I have to go by the grave fine am that's but you just keep going that's right I'll be hollering how long how long amen hallelujah I won't be a f Ste you I'll be crying out for you to get me back where I'm supposed to be come on brother back in a body on the earth to live this is where I've live I'm not going somewhere else I'm not going I'm not going up to the moon the stars and and things I'm going to be right [Applause] here and glorified state why because that I'm born again and he can't leave my soul in it my soul can't go to hell folks cuz it's born again my body can be blown to pieces you can't touch that in part [Music] of I just steep right over stand there say how long see this thing is real folks right and Jos had that red C him about it Lord got a hold of him still needs a whole lot more to work on him did he go home why because he had a wreck and three people walked up to that red car when Josh stepped out you all right he said yes they said where's that other person that y he said what nobody interact with me three people thought somebody leave that car and walk down through the woods this thing is real fol man true amen yep right I saw God when I about left 11 years old and you can't tell me they ain't a God Amen I don't count that my new birth no cuz you see I was a good old bad just thought I had it got it all when I believe but I had better sense than that I knew we had to grow in Grace and knowledge I thought that in the Baptist Church when brother R began to talk about the birth of the Soul not an anointing on your spirit and not Glory Hallelujah I can talk stand here and tell you of the things that happened in my life that I know I 30 out 6 that close the barel end went off y put lead and bark in my head but couldn't kill me I can testify all day long I'm Wrecking a car when I was 16 years old and it backed it clean off the railroad Bank those back wheels was out in the A and I picked it up and put it back up on the road back up on the bank that was just natural brute strength but I can tell you about God Amen but when brother R begin to talk about that inward being that soul I knew what David said my soul thirsted after thee I knew that he said I Thy word have I hid in my heart that I might not sin against thee and I knew that's who he was dealing with that soul and I knew right then I was not born again no been a deacon for 5 years served the Lord for 10 years before them and I knew I wasn't born again but see most of the people now say when they come in the message I Pro I I prove I got it cuz I come in the message blessing devil beat you here are you born again yes Lord I don't really know with it you better find out it don't matter who's going to be president that's right I done told you God puts in Kings and takes out Kings he put the man in the office that was supposed to be in the office that's right you said no they vote him in no no no what I told my brother I said y'all set up around and give an argue over politics I said how many of them do you think up there knows that you don't vote for a president you vote for electoral college do you know that Obama got the election by the majority do you know that the 17th is that what it is it's somewhere in the end this month about to 17th the Electoral College will get together and vote and they can take it away from Obama and give it to Romney you don't even know your Constitution because you can argue politics it's happened at least twice in history that's right why don't you read why don't you read this word to find out what God is talking about instead of sitting back and thinking about what brother so and so said I need to get his Tes wonderful I never said a word to you about than anybody else except one thing you bring it in here and I'll deal with it right you bring it in here and start telling these people here that so and so talk so and so I'll come right here and correct it because it's my job right you
