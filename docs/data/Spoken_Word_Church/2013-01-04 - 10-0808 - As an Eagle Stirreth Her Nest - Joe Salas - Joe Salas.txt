========================================

morning morning I guess we better open the service of prayer first say heavenly father I thank you Lord for allowing us to be here today and uh Lord we pray for brother Wade and sister June and just give us what we have needed for today Lord we pray this in Jesus name amen okay I'm not a preacher teacher speaker but God put something on my heart so uh amen my brother and said a few weeks ago he said uh total obedience usually when we go to a nursing home I write a paper or some kind of subject and uh with my with the help of Brother Joseph we wrote a a paper on Eagles so today I just want to expound on it a little bit so did you turn that on okay okay let's let's read our first scripture Deuteronomy 321 he said as an eagle stirred up her nest fluttered over her young spreaded abro or Wings taken them bear them on her wings in the eagle in her nest brother B said a word he said the eagle the word means one feeding with which is a beautiful type of God who feeds his children by his mouth his word he said men shall not let by bread alone but by every word that proceed out of the mouth of God so he's the eagle that feeds his little eaglet with his word he said I believe in the word in the message as the eagle starts her dress he said and the church is starving today for some of that word there nothing will take this place no not nothing will take the place of the to the Eagles but the real food Eagles food and we are eagles so we have to have Eagles food not social Gatherings not political speeches or some little Stitch and so party but we need some Eagle food food fed from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle that's why he liken us un Eagles Eagle food comes from the mouth of the feter not some manmade theology but from the mouth of the feeder which is Jehovah Eagle who feeds with his own word and the eagle will never bring her babies anything that would hurt them he said oh I just love that God will never make a promise that he won't stand behind and every Eagle just loves to get a hold of that word he loves it because it comes from the mouth of Jehovah Eagle he loves to receive it right then he said uh a lot of the Cat come from the eagle as the eagle stirs her nest so if I don't say what it comes from that's where it comes from he said did you ever see an eagle compromis he said no sir there there's no compromising in him neither does a genuine Christian he ain't soft he will hunt till he finds it yes sir he will find his meat he wants fresh Mana he will get that there and dig till he finds it he said he'll fly higher and higher if it's not in the valley he will rise a little higher the higher you go the more you can see so it's time for the Eagles of this day to get flying higher dig into God's promises not live on wult your food that's been killed years ago get out of it okay Exodus 194 Bible said you have seen what I did unto the Egyptians and how I bear you on Eagle wings and I brought you onto myself the two great wings of the eagle are for deliverance they also represent the old and the New Testament in the message the coming of the Lord Brother R said the prophet prophesied 28 or 38 years ago when they come out of their captivity God will bring them forth on the we wings of eagles he said the prophet saw the plane coming he saw them sitting down and picking them up and taking them back to the Homeland he didn't know what to call it he he just it just looked like an eagle to him so he said they brought them back on the eagil wings that's when the Jews went back to their Homeland as the eagle stirred up her Ness he said the eagle also a squi with two great powerful wings and the feathers you cannot pull them out with a pair of pliers oh they have to be tight or when he gets up in that altitude and them storms they would come on and he'll fall so he's got two wings and I'm going to liken them those two Wings to the New and Old Testament that Jehovah Eagle spreads out before us The God Who is rich in Mercy and today the holy spirit is here to vindicate God's word and that's the eagle Wing that we're supposed to write on he said not some men made theology but we are to write upon the wings of the eagle to the promised land amen okay I just want to talk a little bit about the eagle okay the eyesa the eagle is eight times more powerful than man the eagle is covered with two set of eyelids one set is for flight and the other one is used to fly directly into the sun okay Isaiah 4031 but they they wait upon the Lord shall renew their strength they shall Mount up with wings as eagles they shall run and not be weary and they shall walk and not thinkt he said brother said I believe in the word he tells the eag renewing his youth it been it had been thought that the eagle would ever so often renew his youth bring itself to being young again we said later we found out that it does not exactly renew his youth but what happens is that there are times when it feels so good that it acts young again okay let me make some El here eagles mostly live about 60 years old there is a time in an eagle's life called a moping season and they get really sick almost to the point of death so they build a lot of calcium on their beaks they can't fly or walk so they beat their beats on the rocks to knock some of the calcium off Eagles Fly and give them food for survival during this time and some will live and some will die just like the Christian spiritually if you're an eagle you have to eat Eagle's food which is the inflamable word of God now if we are eagles when a brother or sister gets in the valley we are supposed to help them get back in the Heavenly right amen sir he said I have seen people who are bound in wheelchairs and upon dead beds with cancer but when God's spirit swept their Revival they were renew and swar out of the Wheelchairs and out of the Cs rejoicing Our God he said our God renews us he renews our health he renews our strength he renews Our Hope amen he's con constantly renewing us renewing us do you see there ones why we are likened to Eagles we are renewed and spirit as they are God lightens his uh prophets into Eagles he said God La prophets to Eagles the higher you go the farther you can see he said if you're going to go high in Heaven Got the Eye to see father it would do no good to go higher so when God he takes us up get higher gives us ability to see see farther I like that the higher you go the further you can see that's right here's another God like His prophets and also to the holy spirit will take a prophet way up high in the Heavenly atmosphere and show him many things that will come to pass in the future he took nahem he said on the Old Testament so high that he saw the Cs which have to which we have today and how they were colliding with one another on the roads and he said the Chariot chariots will rage in the streets they shall just just one one against another in the Broadways they shall they shall seem like torches they shall run like Lightnings Paul was taken up so high he saw the last days where men would be truth Breakers false accusers incontinent Fierce despisers of those that are good traitors hated highminded lovers of pleasure more than lovers of God having a form of godliness by denying the power thereof Paul as God's eagle soar up into the God's rim and saw all this then returned to warn us about it oh thank the Lord you said when I think of eagles and Prophets how they fly compared to poor Earthbound chicken they was determined that her Brew shall not be like Earthbound chickens she will see to that now a chicken may be your denominational brother but he knows nothing about heaven Le he has never been up there and those old Barnard chickens will sit on their Old Neck and cackle he said there's no such thing as Divine Healing there's no such thing as speaking in tongues there's no such thing of the baptism of the Holy Ghost I like this right here he says well how does he know he has never been out at the Barnard to find out he has never saw the blue Heavens that God's Great spiritual sights amen right we said the chicken is a bird just as the eagle but the chicken knows little about Heavenly Heavenly at atmosphere and speaking of eagles he said I'm reminded of a farmer West who put up West who put an eagle egg in with a s of chicken when it hatched out it was one of the funniest looking little little thing all the other chickens chirp and he couldn't understand why they were chirping about because he spoke a different language I hope you know what I mean he watched him he didn't know what to do they all picked on him because they said he was an out fellow I'll probably read a little bit more about that so the eagle builds his nest 10,000 ft high on the Cliff of the rock uh this a type of a Christian believer and understand that Jesus Christ is God and place and Upon This Rock Jesus Built his built his church brother BR talks a little about this he said in Palestine the are 40 types of eagles and for for centuries I read a book so a lot of this stuff came off a book not brother message so said he said for centuries the eagle has been recognized by many nations kingdoms and Empires as the king of birds the eagle is a sign of Freedom strength immortality and Authority man has repr reproduced an image of the eagle on coins emblems seals and flags the eagle is a Heavenly bird it can fly and see farther than any other bird then he talks about the chicken too the chicken is a bird just the eagle is but it's Earthbound creature and it can Flop and Fly a little but he can scarcely get his feet off the ground another thing I F I found about the eagle that uh when they find a mate and one of the birds dies they do not look for another mate so I guess they're harder than we are on marriage and for another thing I want you to notice is this a mother egole would not build her nest on the ground she goes to the highest mountain peak the mother Eagle makes her nest in the Rock feeds her little ones and one day she decide that she does not want her brw to be like chickens a chicken is it is a a bird just the eagle is but it's an earth down creature it can Flop and Fly a little but he can scarcely get his feet off the ground he said this reminds me of uh so-called Christianity which some people have today just enough religion to make them miserable you may be able to say that you have that your name on the book but have you ever sore in the heavenlies he said the eagle never makes his nest down here on Earth he makes it just as high in a rock as he can he is a type of the Church of the Living God what a blessed privilege it is to know that God has hidden Us in the Cliff of the rock the calvary far beyond the hollow of the enemy m of the all the Privileges that we have he said I up there in the rocket where the mother Eagle gives birth to her little ones she nurtures them cares for them high in the rock where the coyote could not never climb she's Beyond them I'm so glad that we have a heavenly father who will will if we permit him put us in a place where the Hing of the Devils cannot bother us and where the L door a whiskey and nightclubs cannot touch us far beyond the polluted streams of this world and his fantasies he said now when the eagle builds her nest she gets Vines and sticks and leaves and pieces of wood and Bri she she's very careful as she does not want her little babies to be pierced by the Bri or have pieces of sticks poking them so what does he she do she goes and finds a lamb and slays it and she take the Lamb's skin to their nest and shreds it and works it around until she has a nest real Coy and comfortable for her babies and that is what God does for us when God sees we're about to be born again he watches US during the service to see what we will do don't forget that and he will prepare a nest for you in his kingdom for he knows soon another Eagle will be born to him amen as his Spirit rules you notice how warm and Soo sooth you feel notice it's not God the land that makes you abod so lovely and peaceful and safe he's the land of your nest your abod praise the Lord right right here friends I want to emphasize this about all do appreciate God for the lovely abod he gives you remember only fools walk with have nailed shoes Where Angels feir to try I grees me to hear you as God's children complain and murmur shame on you all of you are guilty and you people who call others Holy Rollers or Fanatics said shame on you don't you know that you're a fool for using such Expressions let me tell you there a fool will call another Christian a Holy Roller or some other Dishonored name and the Angels Fear to even think such things let along say them and you people come to a meeting and call The Works of God be or taking up a p attitude or shr your shoulders and lay leave after a midnight or two said shame on you don't you know the Angels would not dare say one thing get us one of God's servants or his children and every meeting that he taking place God has his angels there to help out and these angels watch over you and take care of you all through the media and they are commissioned to go home with you to watch you over you and keep you safe and right here let me ask you are you as concerned as this about your brother or is your concerned about this about a meeting oh how EAS it is he makes it for us to walk with him amen the message uh shows the father brother said he said be an eagle be born again nature changeed then you can walk up Jacob's Ladder then you can climb to the highest spots to where all things are possible to them that believe but you got to be an eagle a Believer he said don't try the Hebrews they cross as Eagles across the Red Sea then non saying following uncircumcised Egyptians tried to do the same and they lost their life you cannot impersonate Christianity you got to be a Christian is that right I'm done good and the message to count down John brother said we love to talk about ausu Street we love to talk about 50 years ago and I fuss that you all week telling you about how far we lost off from there but we were so advanced in the spirit of God into other things that we got now that they never even had back there so they left the automobiles got to their feet off and in the air so they could have a few spiritual gifts speaking in tongues shouting singing spiritual songs Bo they was floating around up there like butterflies see certainly that was a great age but he said oh brother we are lifted far beyond that now the church is Way Beyond that the spiritual church is in the eagle age now said the astronaut flying on above and looking down at the fellow citizen chicken sure fixing the chicken about we're far about that way up under in the heavenlies where Christ becomes the full thing that takes completely over and live his life and acts through you exactly like it did here on Earth the astronaut age they countown his own brother one more said and the fifth seal and the fifth seal brother said now the fourth piece that was sent forth to combat the Antichrist in this last is his last Beast are you ready the last Beast that was sent forth or the last power to combat Antichrist who was against the teaching of God Antichrist was the eagle see the fourth living Beast was the was an eagle now just now you just study the ages study the scriptures it's the eagle and in the Bible the last age was an eagle and God likened himself to his prophecy now watch the last AG the evil age a revealer of the true word said and then and then at the last the last power he brings on the eag to restore the children back to the original Faith again of the fathers the evil days and you notice there is no more there is no more beast that's all of it that's the end any comments for com good
