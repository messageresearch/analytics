[0:05] their life abundantly
[0:09] [Applause]
[0:12] praise the Lord
[0:16] certainly thank God again for this
[0:18] privilege of being here in his house and
[0:22] you know today being Father's Day I mean
[0:26] back home it would be customary of me
[0:28] was expected that I speak concerning
[0:32] that end at this evening I would like to
[0:36] do just that you know I'd like to speak
[0:40] on the father's decision in the book of
[0:45] Genesis chapter first chapter 28 and
[0:53] then we'll read from Genesis chapter 34
[0:58] then I'll use a few scriptures really I
[1:03] certainly believe the Church of God is a
[1:05] family of God and God will always
[1:09] instruct us you know as family or we
[1:13] ought to act and be and would guide us
[1:18] in our daily lives
[1:20] let us bow heads everywhere or Heavenly
[1:25] Father Lord want to thank you God for
[1:26] this privilege you have given to us to
[1:29] be in your house Lord as we come
[1:30] together Lord God we pray that oh god
[1:33] you'll speak to us to us Lord God and
[1:36] father Lord we pray that the instruction
[1:38] of the scriptures or God might be a
[1:40] benefit to the family of God as it is to
[1:43] the families individually Lord God we
[1:46] pray that Lord God we are not the author
[1:48] of all things but Lord God you are and
[1:51] father God we can pull back the pages
[1:53] but only you can break the bread of life
[1:56] to your children God and so we look to
[1:58] your God wait upon you and expect you
[2:01] God that you will speak to us as we have
[2:03] need pray O God that your word would be
[2:06] of benefit to your children just thank
[2:08] you for all things that we bless and
[2:10] praise your name in Jesus name we pray
[2:12] amen and amen
[2:15] in Genesis chapter 28 and verse 20 it's
[2:22] really in the life of Joe
[2:24] Jacob and Jacob vow a vow saying if God
[2:27] will be with me and will keep me in his
[2:31] way that I go and will give me bread to
[2:35] eat and remnant to put on so that I come
[2:38] again in my father's house in peace then
[2:42] shall the Lord be my god
[2:45] and this stone which I have set for a
[2:48] pillow shall be God's house and of all
[2:52] that thou shalt give me I will surely
[2:55] give the tenth on to the demon I really
[2:59] like that Amen it's not God axing it's
[3:03] actually Jacob you know by a pledge see
[3:08] he will do and in Genesis chapter 24 and
[3:10] the first verse and Dinah the daughter
[3:14] of Leah which she bare unto Jacob went
[3:19] out to see the daughters of the land
[3:21] where the Lord is blessing to the word
[3:23] you may be seated
[3:28] you know there's a there's a book that a
[3:34] brother gave me years ago
[3:35] I think it's written by a gentleman
[3:38] Jeanne Edwards and the the title of it
[3:42] is the tale of three kings many of you
[3:46] might have read it it's a story in
[3:48] humility and there's something very
[3:50] profound in in his thoughts there really
[3:54] is that God had a king all along but in
[4:00] that David that was God's choice to be
[4:02] the king of Israel there was a song that
[4:06] was buried in the soul he said in the
[4:08] morrow of David and so what God did
[4:11] yellow saw first to be on the Troon and
[4:14] then drive that Saul out of David it was
[4:18] a learning experience for for David so
[4:21] when David know take the truth he will
[4:24] said I will never be a solid because as
[4:27] far as David was concerned his King Saul
[4:32] was mad you know God has blessed us
[4:37] fathers and as the Bible declared the
[4:42] predestinated family you know is so set
[4:44] that by the Word of God that you know
[4:47] the father is a head of the house and
[4:49] you know I take an experience from the
[4:52] children I used to remember at all every
[4:54] time you know the children would have
[4:56] come together they would have play you
[4:59] know holes those of please cool and they
[5:01] would have done these things really and
[5:02] there's an experience I've always
[5:05] watched every time the children come to
[5:07] play school the person that takes the
[5:10] role of a teacher then they never take a
[5:14] chalk or something the first thing that
[5:16] they do they take a strap because in
[5:19] their mind the teacher width all right
[5:24] so that is their experience really and
[5:26] so we need to be careful what we pass on
[5:29] to our children now we as men as a
[5:33] father as the head of the house you know
[5:35] and the family is so set up that you
[5:38] know usually is the earner of finances
[5:42] it takes the resource to the family and
[5:45] you know we ought to realize that in the
[5:47] the unit of the family every person
[5:50] plays a role and a very important rule
[5:53] the family is a mechanism together that
[5:57] if one person don't play their role then
[6:00] the family unit is not together but I'd
[6:04] like to deal with these subjects really
[6:06] because one of the experience that I
[6:07] have and the things I'd like to say is
[6:10] that you know you're passing on the
[6:14] experience from one generation to
[6:16] another your children are your
[6:19] inheritance and one of the things that
[6:22] we must do as that predestined family is
[6:25] that especially when your children are
[6:28] coming into teenage years and all of
[6:30] that really the experience that they
[6:33] have is that the home is the greatest
[6:37] place of security no matter what their
[6:40] experience is in other words sometimes
[6:43] we can be too authoritative and so the
[6:48] children are look
[6:49] for a time when they can escape from
[6:53] this prison and that is a practical
[6:56] experience but the must be such a
[6:59] place
[7:00] that we create that kind of atmosphere
[7:02] that our children no matter what
[7:04] happened they want to be at home there's
[7:09] an experience of a human being wherever
[7:12] you call home if you go somewhere and
[7:15] something happen on the road you're
[7:17] you're an accident or something happen
[7:20] you know the person thought is that take
[7:23] me home I want to go home because
[7:27] there's something about whom that's
[7:29] where the love is that's where the care
[7:32] is that's where nurture is and I
[7:35] remember some years ago I was working at
[7:38] another place and I'm you know a friend
[7:40] of mine you know when it when it's time
[7:42] that it's time to clock out everybody's
[7:44] getting ready to go home really and so
[7:46] you know I saw him sitting out on the
[7:48] bench and you know everybody's Lima I
[7:50] said man what's happened and you know it
[7:52] might have lived in his family for a
[7:53] long time but it was a young married man
[7:56] Manny just you know the thing is that
[7:58] they would have lived together but one
[8:00] person get converted then they've got to
[8:02] get married and this is a new experience
[8:04] and you know I said what's happening
[8:06] you're not going home and he said man
[8:08] you wouldn't understand he said man ever
[8:09] since I get married the house become a
[8:13] war zone because she says I catch him no
[8:21] but you know I mean Jacob Jacob had an
[8:25] experience he was born for the
[8:28] birthright but he was born out of place
[8:30] in other words according to the law of
[8:33] the land Jacob was not qualified for the
[8:37] birthright but he was chosen for it and
[8:40] so with all the device that that went on
[8:44] God's not looking at that order that you
[8:48] came in he's looking at his grace and
[8:51] brother Branham said Jacob is Greece and
[8:54] here it was Jacob he actually stole the
[8:58] birthright from his brother and you know
[9:01] so he did his brother wrong so you think
[9:04] that God would have said no Jacob I'm
[9:07] gonna school you
[9:08] you took that birthright that did not
[9:11] belong to you you know by the order of
[9:13] your birth you're not qualified for the
[9:16] birthright but listen there was another
[9:17] thought in God's mind he was a chosen
[9:21] for that birthright amen and so no so he
[9:26] had to run from his brother and Jacob
[9:29] when he was leaving whom you know I like
[9:33] this really in Genesis 28 you know Jacob
[9:37] Evo Evo after you had that experience
[9:40] with God I said God will be with me and
[9:45] will keep me in his way that I go and
[9:48] will give me bread to eat and holily
[9:51] remnant to put on so that I might come
[9:54] again to my father's house in peace
[9:56] remember now when he was leaving if he
[9:59] went back to his father's house he would
[10:02] have died but if I would return to my
[10:04] father's house in peace then shall the
[10:08] Lord be my god he's setting a covenant
[10:12] between him and God and this stone which
[10:16] I have set for a pillow shall be God's
[10:19] house now he is putting it to God and of
[10:24] all that thou shalt give me will I
[10:26] surely give the ten
[10:29] unto thee when when I use the scripture
[10:33] back home I was preaching on the
[10:36] revelation of your tithing you see with
[10:39] Jacob it wasn't something that was acts
[10:42] of him it was something that he promised
[10:46] I'm going to give to you Lord as a
[10:48] covenant for what you're going to do for
[10:51] me hallelujah amen and so we find and
[10:57] I'd like to show you that because you
[10:58] know in Genesis 34 this note was after
[11:03] Jacob had met the angel and God would
[11:07] restore him and change his name and give
[11:10] to him this victory then in the next
[11:14] verse you know the Bible says that God
[11:16] that that Jacob meet his brother Esau
[11:20] and his brother attitude towards him was
[11:24] changed but after that victory no you
[11:29] said no so Jacob I'd met God you know
[11:32] the Bible says he met an angels Jacob
[11:34] said I met God face-to-face
[11:36] now after you'd met God God had changes
[11:40] meme and I want you to look at the time
[11:43] that this now happen
[11:45] you admit God God and change his name
[11:47] then Jacob now move the family to this
[11:52] place to steal and he build him a house
[11:55] there now
[11:57] Jacobs decision now it did not move the
[12:01] family within the wrens of the people of
[12:04] God but he move it close to this city of
[12:09] an unbelieving City and I tell you as
[12:13] the head of your house what you do with
[12:16] your family is determining what happens
[12:19] to that family we need to be careful of
[12:23] the decisions that we make now here is
[12:28] it he had no children and he was moving
[12:31] his family to a place and you're saying
[12:34] know where your children are going to
[12:36] fellowship what church will they go to
[12:39] who will be the
[12:41] pears you know where will they go to
[12:44] school am I taking my family among
[12:48] believers when you move the family when
[12:51] you make a decision what is the greatest
[12:53] thought what are the over writing or
[12:57] over arching situation that determine
[13:00] the decisions that you make because the
[13:03] decisions that you make can affect the
[13:06] family no here Jacob yet met God face to
[13:11] face but he was just a man and he was
[13:15] making a decision maybe Jacob wasn't
[13:18] considering everything to do with his
[13:20] family it's children who they will
[13:23] fellowship with so the Bible said no
[13:25] Dinah maybe a young girl coming to the
[13:29] time where she need other young girls to
[13:32] fellowship with but around her it's not
[13:36] what she wanted so she went to meet with
[13:39] the women of the city under a fellowship
[13:43] with the unbelievers no we know exactly
[13:46] what happened but what I want to focus
[13:49] on is what calls this really if Jacob
[13:55] the head of the house and move the
[13:58] family to this place then his daughter
[14:02] would not have been in the situation and
[14:05] so our decision as men as husbands as
[14:11] head of the else and notice there in
[14:15] Ephesians chapter 5 from verse 23 you
[14:19] know I've always and in in marriage
[14:22] counseling I've always said this to the
[14:25] couple I said I noticed that God did not
[14:27] says wives love your husband but God
[14:31] said Osmonds
[14:32] love your wives and how do I love my
[14:37] wife like Christ loved the church and be
[14:42] not bitter against her then in Ephesians
[14:46] 6 he talking about his children
[14:48] hallelujah he
[14:50] and provoke your children to wrath but
[14:53] bring them up in the nurture and
[14:55] admonition of God know your children are
[14:58] ready take your nature
[15:00] that's my dear Bert but what is more
[15:04] important is the nurturing of the family
[15:09] the extent to which you will go to
[15:12] ensure that the family is protected it's
[15:16] a man's position to ensure that his
[15:20] family is protected to ensure that his
[15:23] family is cared for to ensure that his
[15:27] family his children have the best to
[15:30] bring on the potential that they have
[15:32] battled up inside and so sacrifices has
[15:36] got to be made when you you know people
[15:39] have come to the stage and this time
[15:41] where they said well you know nobody
[15:43] made it a sacrifice for me
[15:44] so I'm not making any sacrifice for
[15:46] anybody when you come to the stage where
[15:50] you begin to start to be parents you're
[15:53] coming to that position in your life
[15:55] where you're no longer the greatest
[15:59] object of adoration but here you're
[16:03] bringing young ones into the world that
[16:07] if life progresa they're going to
[16:09] influence the world that they're going
[16:11] into and what they will take to
[16:14] influence that world is what they
[16:17] receive and the nucleus of their
[16:20] families really so we've got a greater
[16:25] sense of responsibility you know brother
[16:28] Branham led by a certain kind of example
[16:31] and you know brother Branham talks about
[16:34] him putting on an apron and in the
[16:37] kitchen and washing the dishes you know
[16:41] brother branham said a lot of things
[16:43] about the women of the world you know to
[16:46] his wife he talks about her as his
[16:49] sweetheart he said nice things about her
[16:53] he defended her really and brethren I
[16:57] tell you that's the example that we have
[17:00] in our time you know it should never be
[17:04] that way
[17:05] verbally because a man feel that you are
[17:08] the head how do you deal with that
[17:11] position
[17:12] do you speak down to them my word is law
[17:15] and if I say that's it you remember in
[17:20] the scripture it was Moses who did not
[17:22] circumcise his house and hallelujah and
[17:26] God was going to take action but his
[17:29] wife step into the picture you know when
[17:32] I came to the message years ago I had a
[17:35] problem where the brothers say where no
[17:37] woman can tell me anything
[17:38] well I'll tell you one thing I mean many
[17:41] brothers if they're wise were telling
[17:43] them what to do they're having better
[17:44] off today because I find many times that
[17:48] the women are more fervent dedicated to
[17:51] the Word of God
[17:52] hello that's just a truth amen
[17:56] and so it's not that oh well you know my
[18:00] wife has no saying this really it's my
[18:03] decision you see sometimes we become so
[18:07] authoritative that we cannot even reason
[18:11] properly within the framework of the
[18:13] family and as a man you've got to
[18:16] realize Jacob was a prophet of God that
[18:19] God just met him in the cave give him
[18:22] deliver answer but Jacob went out and
[18:24] make a decision that severely affect his
[18:28] family so does that mean that our words
[18:32] are law are we always right we're
[18:37] certainly not hello somebody we're not
[18:40] perfect
[18:41] and when you begin to look at yourself
[18:44] and they said self-evaluation is one of
[18:47] the greatest strengths of a human being
[18:49] these people who think that well you
[18:52] know I'm stronger than anybody and
[18:53] everybody else
[18:54] you know I'm better than everybody else
[18:56] you know they're always Friday if you're
[18:59] talking about hunting they're talking
[19:01] about that they made the best shot if
[19:04] you're talking about cars they drive the
[19:06] fastest and whatever subject you call
[19:09] they want to be the best it's kind of
[19:12] natural as human being but when the
[19:14] pre-designated family we realize that
[19:18] we're not perfect and our strength
[19:22] really begins when we realize as human
[19:25] beings that were not perfect or we
[19:29] relate to our family is important you
[19:33] know children are vulnerable and if the
[19:36] head of the osseous matter what kind of
[19:40] family we're going to have well when I
[19:42] say the head of the family's mad
[19:44] what I mean is that his father is a kind
[19:47] of person that assessing things whether
[19:50] it's rational or irrational when it's
[19:53] right or wrong whether it's reasonable
[19:56] or unreasonable is word carries a power
[20:00] and their authority than our even God
[20:04] can change in the house so I ask a
[20:10] question then what if your children make
[20:13] mistakes what you're going to do you
[20:17] know sometimes even the church become so
[20:20] legalistic in their approach that there
[20:22] is no grace but brother Branham said
[20:25] Jacob is Grace and if your brother has a
[20:30] fault
[20:31] how many times would you try to get him
[20:36] back in life
[20:37] if he make a mistake if he wronged you
[20:40] how many times would you forgive him and
[20:44] brethren then when we do that think now
[20:47] within the framework of our family you
[20:51] know I try to tell the children you know
[20:54] sometimes they get all shook up because
[20:56] in school they might do an exam or they
[20:58] do a test and you know they might think
[21:00] that they fail and you know that they're
[21:03] all shook up and I've always said this
[21:05] really I said hey look honey
[21:08] said you're young it is not the end of
[21:11] the world if you've tried and you're
[21:14] feel you've got time to try again
[21:19] hello sometimes we get to the stage
[21:22] where we said well listen if you're not
[21:24] the best in school then I'm wasting my
[21:27] time
[21:28] hey but you know something in life when
[21:31] you were that age
[21:33] you weren't perfect you made some stupid
[21:37] mistakes but then you want your
[21:41] offsprings to be perfect and to be
[21:44] honest with yourself if they're looking
[21:46] at you then they're totally mess hello
[21:53] so at appearance I said listen you know
[21:56] that you're there trying to tell your
[21:58] kids about the birds and the bee and
[22:00] you're going are over the moon and under
[22:02] the table and all and they're already
[22:04] know because what are the dumb things
[22:08] that we've got today this is information
[22:10] age there's nothing that is hidden you
[22:13] know then what your parents could have
[22:15] tell you and you thought that they well
[22:18] they call it a mystery what I call that
[22:19] bird that bring the babies with the
[22:22] stock but when you really thought that
[22:24] the stock being the babies and you're
[22:26] telling them that today they look at you
[22:27] and they're saying about you dumb
[22:30] because they already know that you get
[22:33] what I'm saying
[22:34] you see you're living in yesterday and
[22:38] your children are to deal amen and
[22:41] you've got no interest to intervene in
[22:46] what is happening today you don't know
[22:48] the music you don't understand the words
[22:51] you know one experience that I have you
[22:54] know the music that we had back in our
[22:57] day I could almost sing along because it
[22:59] was clean music the ones they have today
[23:03] you did not say that as a Christian
[23:05] because man you defile yourself but you
[23:08] know what your children know every word
[23:11] word for word of these things really me
[23:15] because they're living just like you
[23:17] know the words Batman when you were
[23:19] there they know the words right now
[23:21] where they are and so one of the things
[23:24] that we need to do we need to get to
[23:27] that level ello because you can either
[23:31] correct them or guide them if you don't
[23:35] know what they're going through one
[23:37] things that we used to do at home really
[23:39] and you know you send your kids to
[23:40] school back home here you can almost all
[23:43] back in Jamaica that's against the law
[23:45] and so they go to school and they mix
[23:48] with the Jones that worship dog and the
[23:51] dancers that worship cow and those that
[23:55] are Buddhist and and they go to school
[23:57] at everybody I'm just saying like that
[23:58] really you've got to when you find a
[24:02] time in the family when you know the
[24:04] name of your children's friend know
[24:07] where they live who their parents are
[24:10] and so you know you think that you live
[24:13] in a world up here and they're in a
[24:15] world down there so you never talk to
[24:17] them really hey listen if you're going
[24:20] to reach them you're going to have to
[24:22] know and build that kind of relationship
[24:25] that they can talk to you about
[24:27] everything because you'll find today the
[24:32] things that you couldn't talk to your
[24:34] parents about if you don't talk to your
[24:37] pet your children about that today
[24:39] you're in serious problem by the tempo
[24:44] of where the world is really going are
[24:47] you with me so you've got to be able to
[24:49] get down to the level of that family
[24:51] time where we talked about your debrief
[24:54] what happened today and so you know who
[24:58] John is and you know who Mary is and you
[25:02] know that they live over there and they
[25:04] live over there and listen get a part of
[25:07] their world bill relationship with your
[25:11] children there's so many times that
[25:13] husbands especially because you've got a
[25:16] work you've got to do these things
[25:18] your family is alien to you with what
[25:22] they're going through but you are the
[25:25] strong man in the house
[25:27] hello you know my girls they figure if a
[25:34] boy like them and you know what that
[25:37] whispering among each other they said
[25:38] daddy like him because if daddy don't
[25:42] like him then isn't no no but I say hey
[25:51] I'm going to live with infant I said one
[25:59] day you're going to find his hockey boy
[26:01] really and I'm going to laugh at him but
[26:04] I'm just joking he yeah but but listen
[26:06] you've got to build relationship be a
[26:09] part of their world everything they can
[26:12] come to you they can tell you you know
[26:14] why they can come to you they can tell
[26:16] you everything because you're a person
[26:18] of grace that if you make a mistake you
[26:24] have the characteristic that you are
[26:27] going to forgive sometimes things are
[26:30] going to urge you the direction that the
[26:32] family takes but listen look at your
[26:35] life to God you have made some serious
[26:38] mistakes in your life and what if God
[26:41] would have put you to the side and
[26:44] banish you forever and there was no way
[26:47] of getting back bredrin
[26:49] we ought to learn to forgive amen and
[26:54] though it hurt us really we still gotta
[26:58] forgive because the Bible says is that
[27:01] I'm going to save you with your
[27:03] offspring amen hallelujah
[27:07] and if God said that God means that
[27:09] hello somebody and so you've got an
[27:13] opportunity of Hope within the family
[27:16] amen
[27:17] so you believe in your children not only
[27:20] believe in your children but believing
[27:22] other people's children very important
[27:25] and when the framework of the church all
[27:27] the children are your children amen
[27:31] because they are a part of the family of
[27:33] God amen
[27:35] so here Jacob he made this mistake and
[27:39] Dino
[27:40] went out to be with the daughters of the
[27:43] city and so they was in the king's son
[27:47] that saw her and took her and defile her
[27:51] and so after all of that he wanted to
[27:54] marry to her but they were not a part of
[27:57] the Commonwealth of Israel and God
[27:59] forbid that really no sort of family now
[28:03] is in trouble now and the family find
[28:06] itself in this kind of trouble what are
[28:08] you going to do so you know that they
[28:11] come and they try to make a truce they
[28:13] said well you know we desire your
[28:16] daughter anything that you want and
[28:18] Jacob son they they came up with this
[28:21] device they said listen we can't have
[28:24] this with you because you're not
[28:25] circumcised but it said Abba if you
[28:28] become circumcised you become a part of
[28:30] us and we become part of you and those
[28:33] boys of Armagh they said are listen they
[28:36] tell everybody they say come on let us
[28:38] circumcised and be a part of them
[28:40] because all the cattles is going to be
[28:42] ours and all that is sheep and all that
[28:44] they have we're going to be one people
[28:47] you see but all of that is what comes
[28:51] after their work to be there in the
[28:54] first place
[28:55] but a father's decision know at the end
[28:59] of it do you take the blame for what
[29:01] happened do you say whatever happens to
[29:05] this family God I stand in that breach
[29:09] because I'm the decision maker of my
[29:13] house hey listen you know you said no
[29:17] it's not means my children is my wife is
[29:19] no no no no no you are the head of the
[29:22] house how you do will determine what
[29:25] comes of it really are you there with me
[29:27] and so here it is now what was happening
[29:31] to Jacob Souls Jacob had just meet God
[29:34] and for all of his years of wandering
[29:37] for all of his trouble God had set the
[29:41] peace with him and his brother
[29:43] but look what is going to happen to his
[29:45] house murder murder because of his
[29:50] decision
[29:51] and so he says well my sons did because
[29:57] my daughter did but what caused it
[30:00] because his decision had caused the
[30:03] family to be in a place that they were
[30:05] not supposed to be and so not because we
[30:09] are spiritual not because we've been
[30:12] blessed by God not because we think that
[30:15] we hear from God the family is important
[30:19] it's your inheritance the decisions that
[30:23] you make it will affect the family you
[30:28] know brethren it's a beautiful thing if
[30:31] your children after your example serve
[30:35] the Lord it's the most glorious thing in
[30:39] a family but you know if you if your
[30:42] children don't serve the Lord because of
[30:45] decisions that you've made then you've
[30:48] got to realize it's not just my children
[30:50] Lord I've made mistakes and how do I put
[30:54] that before God so that God can turn
[30:57] around and forgive my days that my
[31:01] children my inheritance would be the
[31:03] benefit of God's word amen hallelujah
[31:08] amen you know in Ezekiel 18 in verse 12
[31:11] the Bible says the father has eaten the
[31:16] sower drip so Ezekiel was saying it is
[31:21] what the father did that is affecting
[31:24] the children and and you know brethren
[31:26] you're going to say well well you know
[31:28] brachear are you trying to say that all
[31:30] that happened to my children is my fault
[31:32] no I'm not saying that but I said we've
[31:36] got a responsibility as the head you
[31:39] know do we come down hard with the Amma
[31:42] do your children realize that in you
[31:45] there is grace that if I I go to the end
[31:50] of the road and and I've missed
[31:52] everything like the prodigal could your
[31:55] children come back to you like the
[31:57] prodigal son had gone back to his father
[31:59] and if your son had come back to you
[32:02] would you
[32:03] what the Sun had thought in his heart
[32:06] that I will go back and I'm some father
[32:08] of sin and because justice made me a
[32:10] servant would you say well yes boy be a
[32:14] servant or would you have that Father's
[32:17] heart a son cannot be a servant
[32:22] especially if he's coming to maturity
[32:26] before is mature the Bible says is no
[32:30] different from a servant but if he's
[32:32] mature in other words if he's repented
[32:34] if he come back he's no longer a servant
[32:36] but a son and you treat him that way
[32:40] brethren the family unit is important
[32:42] and father's need to realize that you've
[32:45] got a profound responsibility to your
[32:49] wife to your children to the entire
[32:52] family the things you do the things you
[32:55] say the decisions that you make is going
[32:57] to affect the family and so in your
[33:02] thoughts you're not perfect but God is
[33:06] perfect amen you know we don't think and
[33:10] especially around the message where they
[33:12] said women or women or women you know I
[33:15] tell you you know they said well Heath
[33:18] caused the fall but hey listen Satan was
[33:21] kicked out of heaven and come down into
[33:23] the Garden of Eden if he had not come in
[33:26] that garden there would be no fall amen
[33:29] so you've got to take it back to the
[33:31] beginning are you there with me you
[33:33] started this union and so you've got a
[33:36] profound responsibility you know we've
[33:38] got a thing as men that it is too hard
[33:41] for you to say I am sorry but you know
[33:44] fathers this morning this is Father's
[33:48] Day sometimes you have rung your
[33:51] children sometimes even within the
[33:54] families within the message you talk to
[33:57] children you talk to young people you
[33:59] talk to wives and there's this
[34:01] undercurrent of bitterness because of
[34:04] things that were said because of things
[34:07] that were done and sometimes you you
[34:10] want to move on as though it never
[34:12] happened
[34:13] brethren when there's a wrong
[34:16] it must be made right and you're never
[34:20] too big to say to your children a I've
[34:24] made mistakes in life might be what you
[34:28] are today I've made decisions that was
[34:31] not exactly what I should have made and
[34:34] I'm sorry but you know God together God
[34:39] can bring us back on track no matter how
[34:42] far that we think that we have gone
[34:48] [Applause]
[34:52] there's a lot of Tears that are not
[34:55] cried there's a lot of anger that is
[34:59] built up there's a lot of people with a
[35:02] lot of resentment because of decisions
[35:05] that we have made in our lives but
[35:08] brethren the family is important all the
[35:13] Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus and
[35:17] you and your whole soul shall be saved
[35:20] that's a covenant but you see for that
[35:24] covenant to be in effect you've got to
[35:26] go back and make things right according
[35:29] to st. mark 11 when you go to prayer
[35:32] forgive you've got to forgive your
[35:35] children of the things that you felt
[35:38] that they did against you
[35:40] hello amen and then they've got to seek
[35:45] forgiveness from you for the things that
[35:47] they've done but you know the stronger
[35:50] does it first well you know if they
[35:52] never say they're sorry I'm not sorry
[35:54] for what I did
[35:57] people say well they're hurt man and I'd
[36:00] say no sir as long as I live I'll never
[36:02] forget it and I'll never forgive them
[36:04] you'll never go to heaven
[36:08] [Music]
[36:10] that's really what you're saying I can't
[36:13] go to heaven because I'm saying I'm
[36:15] sorry brethren as believers we need to
[36:18] develop that attitude that if we feel
[36:21] like we've run somebody sometimes you
[36:24] know what you know you can the store to
[36:26] ten people people have never known the
[36:29] story to try to prove that you're not
[36:31] wrong but but what if I say I'm sorry
[36:34] and I wasn't wrong in first place hey
[36:37] you know my mother you said in a magnum
[36:40] Ashna coffee no - where you don't know
[36:42] what that means the cop didn't break so
[36:45] the coffee did spill hey men so what if
[36:49] I say I'm sorry and at the end of the
[36:51] day God say I wasn't wrong but at least
[36:53] I did what I thought that I could do
[36:56] because I first want to make the
[36:58] situation right and we're talking about
[37:01] the family how do you treat your wives
[37:04] the Bible says husband's love your wives
[37:08] you know so he said well well she's not
[37:10] submissive did you really love her the
[37:14] way you should in other words do you
[37:19] love her like you when you started when
[37:22] you would have walked across mountains
[37:24] and going to Valley at the dead of night
[37:27] hey you know marriage is like this
[37:31] really after the marriage get a few
[37:33] years down the road you know she said
[37:36] honey would you go in the room and get
[37:38] or you go get it yourself
[37:42] you you know when you started out really
[37:44] you to fix the split and make sure you
[37:48] like everything was in the right place
[37:50] by the color scheme and so and you and
[37:53] you gave it to him really because you
[37:55] want to make sure that your honor your
[37:57] sugar your third of and all of that nice
[38:00] things is all right after it goes down a
[38:03] few years down the road if you want to
[38:06] get it
[38:11] but the Bible command us really husbands
[38:15] love your wives with such a love that
[38:20] Christ loved the church and gave himself
[38:23] for it really you know when the great
[38:28] years begin to come when you can't walk
[38:32] as fast as you used to walk that's the
[38:35] time the love takes another turn it's
[38:39] not to mature Amen that's the time you
[38:43] really need one another that's when you
[38:46] need the companionship of each other and
[38:50] if you don't invest to be kind in the
[38:54] early years when you're older you won't
[38:57] get what you're expecting to get amen
[39:02] be kind to one another tender-hearted
[39:06] what Father's Day we've got a great
[39:11] opportunity as men of God as fathers as
[39:14] Christians as believers to lead our
[39:18] family the way God says I know the man
[39:21] Abraham that he will lead his children
[39:24] after him may God lead us may we be an
[39:31] example of the predestinated family may
[39:35] we be an example of people that know the
[39:39] utmost truth may we stand in faith and
[39:43] believe that no matter what happened to
[39:46] the family after years members of your
[39:49] family testify he was the best dad that
[39:53] I have and sometimes those children are
[39:58] not your biological children that's a
[40:01] great challenge that we have you know
[40:04] I've seen that the best of family you
[40:07] know mothers they are protected of their
[40:09] children and they come into a marriage
[40:11] after that they've got children and so
[40:14] they guard those children from that new
[40:17] husband because she figure is going to
[40:21] hurt our children you know really it's a
[40:25] nature that comes from the animal
[40:26] kingdom but if you love him enough to
[40:31] marry to him and you marry each other
[40:34] with children outside of that marriage
[40:37] you need to even go the extra mile to
[40:39] ensure that the offspring is taken care
[40:43] of you know Reverend chinku says that in
[40:50] the book fifty years in the Church of
[40:53] Rome when the priests came and take the
[40:57] one call that the family had you took
[40:59] the calf also in Jamaica and they said
[41:02] if you take the call the calf a feel in
[41:06] other words if you take her all our
[41:08] children are yours be a father to those
[41:12] children and you know if you have loved
[41:14] children all your life one of the
[41:16] problems that we have back home even
[41:18] know is that no to migrate a family
[41:21] migrating to the United States one time
[41:24] there was no DNA no they've got to do
[41:26] DNA and you know what they know doing
[41:29] the DNA for the family to remove the
[41:31] United States and they realize their
[41:33] children in the bunch that is not for
[41:34] the father I've seen young people that
[41:39] went off their mind because you know and
[41:41] a man if you have had this child all
[41:44] your life
[41:44] but your thought is over your child and
[41:46] then years after you're fine is not your
[41:48] child can you take that love we've got
[41:54] some things to deal with because of sin
[41:56] but brethren but we're the predestined
[42:00] of God and we ought to make a desire a
[42:02] difference so whatever position you find
[42:06] yourself in I wish at the end of the day
[42:10] I've heard minister's wife says I would
[42:13] never marry to another message preacher
[42:16] it's a disgrace it's not a shame it's a
[42:20] disgrace you should be the best man any
[42:24] man that stand behind this pulpit and
[42:26] his wife and his children can't said I'm
[42:28] proud of him as my husband I'm proud of
[42:31] him as my daddy you shouldn't be
[42:33] standing here
[42:34] I have one thing back home I said listen
[42:39] if a man bill abuse his wife he ain't
[42:43] preaching in other words if he is abuser
[42:47] in the past if the abuser if I know he
[42:50] ain't preaching for me that's period you
[42:53] know because listen your wife ought to
[42:57] be your greatest cheerleader if she
[43:01] don't see God in you you're just an
[43:04] appropriate behind the pulpit if your
[43:06] children don't see God in you I don't
[43:09] care what those children are there could
[43:10] be back saloon to the end of the earth
[43:12] but they know the way you treat them you
[43:15] are the best father that there is amen
[43:19] may God bless us this evening happy
[43:22] Father's Day to all the fathers and may
[43:25] you lead your children after you in the
[43:27] name of Jesus Christ hallelujah praise
