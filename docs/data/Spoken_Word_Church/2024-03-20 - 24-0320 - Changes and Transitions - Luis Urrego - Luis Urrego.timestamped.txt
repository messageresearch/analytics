[13:37] and Transitions and sometimes we think
[13:39] that it's the same thing but it's it
[13:42] really isn't changes is different from
[13:46] transitions but they they go along
[13:48] together amen and uh so I want to take
[13:51] this from Ecclesiastes chapter 3
[13:54] starting at verse
[13:55] one and let's just bow our heads before
[13:58] we go to the Lord read his
[14:00] word Lord Jesus as we come before you
[14:03] Heavenly Father we we just ask you first
[14:07] and foremost Lord to forgive us for our
[14:09] sins and Lord cleanse us father from any
[14:12] unrighteousness and anything that we may
[14:15] have said done or even thought Lord that
[14:17] was contrary to your word father we know
[14:20] you know father in our hearts we we
[14:22] don't desire father evil but we pray
[14:25] Lord God Almighty we thank you Lord we
[14:27] thank you for the precious blood that
[14:29] father God is still there Lord that
[14:31] bumper of blood Lord that we can father
[14:33] God uh uh Have Faith Lord God that it
[14:38] not just cover our sins but completely
[14:40] eradicate our sins father and Lord God
[14:43] we thank you for that and Lord Jesus we
[14:46] just pray now that you would have your
[14:47] way this evening Lord speak to our
[14:49] hearts and Lord may you may something be
[14:53] said Lord to help edify your people and
[14:55] Lord and you be glorified and just have
[14:58] your way here tonight meet every need
[15:00] amongst us Lord God and continue father
[15:02] God to just be with with brother Dale
[15:05] and and sister Peggy and the family Lord
[15:07] God we just always put them before you
[15:09] Lord Jesus and Lord just thank you for
[15:12] the strength that you have been given
[15:13] them thus far and Lord we just uh ask
[15:17] that you would just have your way here
[15:18] this evening and we commit the service
[15:21] into your hands in Jesus Christ's name
[15:23] amen amen Ecclesiastes 3:1 it says to
[15:28] everything
[15:30] there is a season and I want you to
[15:32] notice that it says that to
[15:34] everything
[15:36] everything everything upon this Earth
[15:39] everything that you go through
[15:40] everything that happens in your life
[15:42] everything that that happens in your
[15:44] next door neighbor's life everything
[15:46] that that goes on there is a season for
[15:50] that to happen it's just like as if we
[15:54] are right now transitioning into the
[15:57] spring season
[15:59] right today I think is the first day of
[16:01] spring or tomorrow or something like
[16:03] that but I wear my bright yellow tie
[16:07] anyways but it's it's a
[16:10] transition now it would be it would be
[16:14] tough it would be tough if we went from
[16:17] Winter to Spring
[16:20] abruptly but we have for the last few
[16:23] weeks we've been having the times where
[16:26] like the weather can't make up its mind
[16:29] it's like you know we're getting 80°
[16:32] weather all just about a couple of weeks
[16:34] ago and then the other past two nights
[16:36] we've been getting you know below
[16:38] freezing
[16:39] temperatures but it's it's because it's
[16:42] in a transition process and so the
[16:45] change doesn't take place abruptly
[16:47] because it would not be good and we may
[16:50] not be able to to to accept it uh or
[16:54] nature would not be able to accept it in
[16:56] in in such a harsh way so it's the same
[16:58] thing with with with with this so just
[17:01] continue reading to everything there is
[17:03] a season and a time to every purpose
[17:08] under the heaven amen and we'll just
[17:11] continue reading you may have your seats
[17:13] in there it says verse two a time to be
[17:17] born and a time to die right notice that
[17:23] these things are happening in time right
[17:26] a time to be born and a time to die
[17:30] because we know that you can't die when
[17:31] there's eternal life in in the vault
[17:34] right so these things are happening we
[17:36] know that these things are happening
[17:38] here on Earth what Solomon the wisest
[17:41] man that have that has ever lived and
[17:44] he's telling us here that the things
[17:47] that he has experienced and the wisdom
[17:50] he's sharing with us wisdom a time to be
[17:53] born and a time to die a time to plant
[17:57] and a time to plug plck up that which is
[18:00] planted
[18:03] right you know you can't have your
[18:05] potatoes sitting in the ground
[18:08] forever you can't have your corn sitting
[18:10] on the stalk or or forever eventually
[18:14] it's either going to fall off or R rot
[18:16] off or you're going to go and get it
[18:18] right but but it's it's it's a time to
[18:21] plant that and it's a time to get that
[18:24] that you that you planted A Time to Kill
[18:28] and a Time time to
[18:30] heal a time to break down and a time to
[18:33] build up man a time to weep and a time
[18:38] to laugh we can't enjoy the the the good
[18:42] times when we haven't had bad times
[18:45] right that that that's just how it is we
[18:48] can't enjoy a good laugh amen when we
[18:50] haven't cried before right you wouldn't
[18:54] be able to appreciate it I can
[18:56] appreciate when I can laugh really good
[18:58] good and there's nothing bothering me
[19:00] too much back back here you know but
[19:03] when you have you have troubles and you
[19:05] have tribulations and things and
[19:07] problems and
[19:08] stuff you
[19:10] know it's it's hard it's hard to laugh
[19:14] it's hard to laugh but that's where God
[19:15] wants you to laugh that's where God
[19:18] wants you to trust in him amen a time to
[19:21] time to weep and a time to laugh a time
[19:23] to mourn and a time to
[19:25] dance right a time to Cast Away stones
[19:29] and a time to gather Stones together a
[19:32] time to embrace and a time to refrain
[19:36] from
[19:37] embracing man a time to get and a time
[19:40] to lose a time to keep and a time to
[19:43] Cast Away a time to Rend and a time to
[19:47] sew a time to keep silence and a time to
[19:51] speak a time to love and a time to hate
[19:56] a time of war and a time of peace
[19:59] amen
[20:01] so that is what Solomon told us amen
[20:04] that there is a time and a season for
[20:06] each one of these things in our lives
[20:08] now we as human beings we hate
[20:12] change we hate change we love our our
[20:16] our our our routines and we love our our
[20:19] our for everything to stay the same
[20:23] because that's what we are that's that
[20:25] we're we're we're we are we are
[20:27] creatures of of uh if something doesn't
[20:30] stay the same it it hinders or or or or
[20:34] it's or or it's in it's violating our
[20:37] comfort zones you see what I'm saying so
[20:41] when when things change and things we
[20:43] know have to change for example as I was
[20:45] just referring to the seasons there has
[20:48] to be seasons in order for there to be
[20:50] different things to happen here on
[20:53] Earth um uh here in in America we we
[20:57] have the Four Seasons in in in in
[21:00] Colombia back in my country
[21:02] we we only have two seasons winter and
[21:06] summer and winter is just because it
[21:08] rains a lot but it's still the same
[21:10] temperature but that season needs to be
[21:13] there you see it's in order for things
[21:15] to grow in order for more rain and more
[21:17] water to come in in in into the on on
[21:20] Earth and and things like that so you
[21:22] have to have these seasons and these and
[21:24] change is good for each and every one of
[21:27] us
[21:29] God doesn't stay
[21:31] still God doesn't stay uh uh uh in one
[21:37] place he moves on Amen and we see that
[21:40] throughout the scripture amen that God
[21:43] is a God that moves and that moves
[21:46] forward and that moves on because he's a
[21:50] God Amen that likes and knows that we
[21:52] need change in our lives because if we
[21:55] had if we do not have changes in our
[21:57] lives we would be come stagnant y right
[22:00] amen we would become we would become
[22:02] rotten amen we would become amen we
[22:05] would not progress am you see so we have
[22:08] to have changes in our lives now uh but
[22:12] we hate
[22:13] it we we all we hate it we hate when
[22:16] somebody sits in our seat at church amen
[22:19] oh I we hate
[22:22] that we you know but but but that's
[22:27] good that's good that that that you're
[22:30] you're allowing that person to sit where
[22:32] you normally sit and that person didn't
[22:35] do it on purpose he just there was
[22:37] nowhere else to
[22:39] sit but it it it it takes us out of our
[22:42] comfort zones you see so we have to have
[22:46] the change now Proverbs 3 tells us this
[22:49] in verses five and six and I didn't give
[22:51] the brothers these other scriptures but
[22:53] if they can pull them up that's good it
[22:55] says trust in the Lord with all th heart
[22:59] and lean not unto thine own
[23:03] understanding amen trust in the Lord
[23:06] with all thine heart oh I will trust the
[23:10] Lord in in some things but then there's
[23:12] these other areas amen where we want to
[23:15] put our own hand in it and if we don't
[23:19] put our own hand in it then we don't
[23:21] we're out of our comfort zone but that's
[23:23] not what God is telling us here to do
[23:26] he's telling us to trust in the Lord
[23:28] with all thine heart amen and do not
[23:31] lean onto what you think it's right
[23:34] right onto what you think the way things
[23:37] should be amen because my ways and your
[23:40] ways a a they're they're rotten amen
[23:44] they're no good his ways are perfect
[23:48] amen and so we want to lean onto the
[23:50] perfect amen and when we lean on to the
[23:53] perfect and we know that his word is
[23:56] perfect so when we lean on to the word
[23:58] word and we do things by the word then
[24:01] then Perfection has to come out of that
[24:04] right there can't be any other way amen
[24:07] perfect Perfection has to come out if we
[24:09] lean onto him and not onto our own
[24:12] understanding not onto our own feelings
[24:16] amen not onto what we think the way
[24:18] things should be amen but the way the
[24:21] word says it should be amen now that's
[24:24] tough but it's what we need to do amen
[24:28] amen and he says here in in in verse in
[24:31] verse six in uh Solomon continues to say
[24:34] in all thy ways and all thy ways
[24:38] acknowledge Him and He Shall direct thy
[24:42] paths amen so in everything that we do
[24:45] and we use this scripture a lot for for
[24:47] our young people this is a scripture
[24:49] that helped me when I as I was growing
[24:52] but in all your ways in all your plans
[24:54] and in everything every every change
[24:57] that's going to happen in your life amen
[25:00] acknowledge Him put him first and if you
[25:03] put him first then he will he will
[25:06] direct your paths but when we don't
[25:09] acknowledge Him He can't direct because
[25:12] you're not putting you're not leaning
[25:14] you're leaning to your own understanding
[25:16] you see so so that's that's that's what
[25:20] we need to do amen and that's what the
[25:22] wisest man that ever lived amen told us
[25:25] to do in Proverbs right amen now Malachi
[25:29] 3:6 tells us this for I am the Lord and
[25:33] I change not amen he God God is all
[25:36] known he he's the one that doesn't
[25:39] change but he doesn't change because
[25:42] he's infinite he's all knowing and
[25:45] that's the reason why we as human beings
[25:48] we we have a hard time accepting change
[25:50] because we're finite and we're scared of
[25:54] the unknown amen and so it's hard for us
[25:58] us to move forward Amen in something
[26:01] that we don't know but he's not he's not
[26:05] scared he's not afraid and that's the
[26:08] reason why he doesn't
[26:09] change but he says he's Lord and he
[26:12] changes not because he's all knowing
[26:14] amen we're constantly faced with changes
[26:18] and it's because we're not all knowing
[26:22] we're we don't know all things and
[26:23] that's the reason why we have to depend
[26:25] on God Amen and and that's the reason
[26:27] why we struggle with the process of
[26:29] change amen we struggle with change
[26:32] because we we sometimes don't have a
[26:36] clue sometimes we just got to shoot
[26:38] blindly sometimes and say Lord I'm doing
[26:42] here's my part you just do the
[26:44] rest it's almost like like us as
[26:46] ministers sometimes sometimes honestly
[26:49] you just you're like Lord you you're
[26:52] trying to find the mind of God you're
[26:54] trying to pray and you're trying to say
[26:55] Lord where what is it that the church
[26:57] needs right now amen what is it where
[27:01] where is your mind what what is it I
[27:03] don't want to necessarily preach what I
[27:04] want to preach I could I could bring
[27:06] here bring a a good teaching of you know
[27:10] of something that that I like but what
[27:12] is it that the that that that the church
[27:15] needs amen and then you're sitting there
[27:18] you know Gathering notes and you're
[27:19] Gathering scriptures and you're
[27:21] Gathering things and re and ultimately
[27:24] you have to say Lord that you do the
[27:26] rest you speak according to the needs of
[27:29] the people because I don't know them the
[27:31] the Brethren here that Minister don't
[27:33] know them but you oh Lord knows the
[27:36] needs and the hearts of every individual
[27:38] here and you can speak according to your
[27:41] oracles Lord and meet every need that's
[27:44] there because he created the heart and
[27:47] he knows the
[27:48] heart and not only that he can change
[27:51] the
[27:52] heart amen I can't change the heart amen
[27:56] but he can amen
[27:58] and so all we are asked to do is tasked
[28:01] to do is just speak his word amen throw
[28:03] out the net so to speak praise the Lord
[28:06] Jesus now brother brandham uh says this
[28:09] and and I know we believe that God sent
[28:13] us a prophet in this day and therefore
[28:14] we quote him amen yes sir amen but he
[28:17] said in the message in 1964 in in Christ
[28:20] has identified the same in all
[28:22] generations he says and now we find that
[28:26] in each one of those ages usually people
[28:29] don't want to believe it because they're
[28:34] already set in their
[28:37] way right and then he says a an
[28:40] interesting phrase here and and and
[28:42] several years ago I preached a message
[28:44] called when God turns the
[28:45] corner and he says here you're turning a
[28:48] corner right you're turning a corner
[28:52] you're building a building and then get
[28:55] to the corner everybody is running this
[28:57] way
[28:59] they don't want to turn that
[29:01] corner right but the building goes that
[29:05] way if the word says it goes that way
[29:08] see there's where we get those Junctions
[29:11] of time man that's where it's
[29:14] hard it's in the it's in the Turning of
[29:17] the corner when they're building the
[29:18] building it's it's in that turning of
[29:20] the corner because here they got used to
[29:22] laying the bricks or doing whatever all
[29:24] in one row for a while now but now it's
[29:27] time to turn to
[29:28] corner and that turning of the corner is
[29:31] where it gets it gets tricky it gets
[29:34] tough but that turning of the corner you
[29:37] need to Pivot and you need to to be able
[29:40] to turn that corner so that that so that
[29:43] that building can continue to be built
[29:46] amen so whatever it is in your life or
[29:48] whatever is happening in our lives we've
[29:50] got to be able to be able to Pivot amen
[29:54] when God is trying to move and direct us
[29:56] amen into a into another area or another
[30:00] season of Our
[30:04] Lives how many are understanding what
[30:06] I'm trying to
[30:07] say
[30:08] right cuz God Amen is
[30:13] moving God is God God is in
[30:16] transition God is moving and we got to
[30:19] look at him see where he's moving and
[30:22] just move along with him right that's
[30:26] and then things can go
[30:29] smoothly but that's the that's the hard
[30:32] part that's the hard part you know but
[30:35] he said he would lead us and guide us
[30:38] unto all truth
[30:40] amen so you're turning a corner now
[30:44] right we're turning a corner and we've
[30:47] got to be able to look in the word and
[30:50] we've got to be able to turn that corner
[30:53] amen and look at him and see where he's
[30:56] leading us right not by your own
[30:59] feelings not what you feel or how things
[31:01] should be amen but what do the people
[31:04] need what what is it that that that that
[31:07] that will continue amen that this
[31:11] building continues to grow amen what is
[31:15] it amen that I continue to grow amen
[31:18] that you continue to grow
[31:21] amen because God is not wanting to stand
[31:25] still God is wanting to move forward
[31:27] amen amen praise the Lord Brother BR
[31:31] continues to say here in 1961 in the
[31:33] church choos in law for Grace he says
[31:35] this you cannot break the types and
[31:37] shadows of God that's what Israel done
[31:39] in the natural that's what they've done
[31:42] in the
[31:43] spiritual we realize that those things
[31:46] happened to Israel now they've happened
[31:48] to the church today just as they did
[31:50] then and we're about the end of the road
[31:53] now Brethren watch what he says here
[31:56] it's time that something happen happened
[31:59] amen amen I I believe that it's it's
[32:03] time that something happened
[32:06] it's you know I I don't know you know
[32:09] here comes we have an eclipse coming and
[32:12] and and here comes all the YouTubers you
[32:14] know bringing up this it represents this
[32:16] and then the prophecy of this and all
[32:18] this and that amen and and and we know
[32:23] that something is on on the road to
[32:25] happen right and the word tells us
[32:27] what's going to happen happen so don't
[32:29] lean onto your own understanding amen
[32:31] but lean onto what the word says amen
[32:34] whatever will happen if something
[32:36] happens that day well they gu knew about
[32:38] it and I'm just going to move on Amen
[32:40] turn the corner with him amen I'm not
[32:43] missing a Rapture I'm not missing a body
[32:46] change if that's amen if the Rapture
[32:48] takes place that day I'm going in that
[32:50] Rapture amen and you should be too I'm
[32:53] not saying it is but but but you have to
[32:56] move and pivot and be willing to to and
[32:58] be and be able to Pivot when God is
[33:00] moving right and we're about the end of
[33:02] the road now Brethren it's it's time
[33:04] that something happen I want to cross
[33:07] Jordan don't you brother Brandman asked
[33:10] over into the promised land where we can
[33:13] see we've seen good things he says God's
[33:17] been good to us we're not complaining
[33:20] I'm out here with you this is Brother
[33:22] Bram still speaking I'm out here on
[33:25] these things with you but brethren let's
[33:28] put ourselves together and go over amen
[33:32] amen let's put ourselves together and go
[33:35] over why we must go over amen we can't
[33:39] stand still we can't go back amen and we
[33:42] can't just look at the past and and and
[33:45] and glory in the in in the days of old
[33:47] amen we've got to move forward because
[33:49] there is scriptures in the in the in the
[33:52] Bible to be
[33:53] fulfilled and they're not going to be
[33:55] fulfilled us standing around and sitting
[33:57] being stagnant we're God is moving and
[34:01] we've got to move forward amen praise
[34:04] the Lord
[34:08] Jesus there's scriptures to be fulfilled
[34:11] in your life that God plac there to
[34:15] fulfill in your life
[34:18] personally and they can't and they can't
[34:21] be fulfilled unless you get to that
[34:23] point where that an anointing comes over
[34:26] that where God can't can fulfill that
[34:28] scripture in your life you see I believe
[34:31] that with all my
[34:33] hearten you see
[34:37] so uh so he says here let's put
[34:40] ourselves together and go over and then
[34:42] he says we must go over amen amen we
[34:44] must go over the children of Israel when
[34:46] they got to the to the to the to the
[34:49] promised land to the to the River Jordan
[34:52] there they had to go over why because
[34:54] the promise had already been given to
[34:56] Abraham that they were going to to have
[34:59] that Promised Land even before Moses
[35:01] came on the scene even before anybody
[35:03] else that God used God had already said
[35:06] that he was going to take him to a land
[35:08] that flows with milk and honey God was
[35:10] going to make sure that that word was to
[35:12] be
[35:13] fulfilled God said that there is going
[35:15] to be a body change in this hour God
[35:18] said that there's going to be a
[35:19] resurrection to take place in this hour
[35:22] the conditions have to be there in order
[35:24] for those things to take place and they
[35:26] can't be there uh in in in in stagnant
[35:30] way and just waiting on the train like
[35:32] brother Dell used to
[35:34] say when we're sitting around and just
[35:36] get to put this thing on cruise
[35:39] control and just let's let's see what
[35:41] happens and I'll just uh I'll wait until
[35:45] God gives me the anointing to get my
[35:47] prayer closet and pray when I feel good
[35:51] and I don't I and I feel I you know I'm
[35:55] not I don't feel sick anymore and I I
[35:57] don't feel
[35:58] hunger pains anymore then I'll get down
[36:00] on my knees and get desperate with God
[36:04] again no amen God is moving you're going
[36:08] to be left behind somewhere praise the
[36:11] Lord
[36:12] Jesus amen
[36:14] now I want to I want to this this is
[36:18] what the difference between change and
[36:21] transition is now change is the event or
[36:26] the moment in
[36:28] time in other words is the actual is the
[36:31] actual event or or that moment that that
[36:36] happened that's different from what
[36:38] previously was there right so you could
[36:41] take for example you you you move in
[36:43] into a new home or you or you leave a
[36:47] job change
[36:48] jobs um or or when we become parents
[36:52] right right that's a change now
[36:56] transition is the process it's that
[36:59] process for that change to
[37:02] happen now we like
[37:05] changes it depends on what it
[37:08] is we don't like people to sit in our
[37:10] seat at church
[37:12] but we don't like that change
[37:16] though but but we but we need those
[37:21] changes now the transition for those
[37:23] changes or the things that happen for
[37:25] there to change that's where where it
[37:27] gets
[37:29] tricky that's where it's tough for us
[37:32] because that's the hard
[37:34] part and amen that the the transition is
[37:39] the process that unfolds before or
[37:42] during and after the change
[37:45] event right and that's the tricky part
[37:50] amen now also change is external it
[37:53] happens to us and and it also happens
[37:56] around us amen
[37:58] um for example and I put this
[38:01] example uh with regards to you missing a
[38:05] a flight right that that you you that is
[38:09] a change that happened when you go to
[38:11] the airport you get there and and and
[38:13] and and you get there and you miss the
[38:15] flight and it's because something
[38:18] happened to the plane or whatever and
[38:19] you can't get on the plane and you miss
[38:21] a flight that's a change that happened
[38:23] and you couldn't do anything about that
[38:26] right but now the trans I is what
[38:30] psychologically or what you're thinking
[38:32] how you're going to take that what are
[38:34] you going to do to be able to to to work
[38:37] with that change you see you see what
[38:39] I'm trying to say so for example you
[38:42] know last year my brother Bob and and
[38:44] and Michael and Nyla and all of us when
[38:47] we went to Nicaragua and we left Atlanta
[38:50] and we got to Houston was it Houston
[38:52] yeah it was Houston and we knew that
[38:56] something had happened all the national
[38:58] uh nationally the computer uh FAA
[39:04] computers they broke down or something
[39:05] like that something had happened and and
[39:08] when we got to Houston of course we
[39:09] missed our flight to go to
[39:13] Nicaragua so here we are in Houston I I
[39:15] wish I wish we were still in Atlanta
[39:18] there would have been an easier way to
[39:19] get out of that but we were in Houston
[39:22] very far away from home so we couldn't
[39:27] we had to the change happened abruptly
[39:30] but we had to Pivot amen we had to
[39:33] transition Amen in order to be able to
[39:37] accept that change and let's see what we
[39:39] can do about this some of us were
[39:41] thinking well maybe we should just go
[39:43] back I'll just get a flight and go back
[39:46] some and some of us were thinking well
[39:49] let's just see what happened let's wait
[39:50] here in the airport for a few hours
[39:52] let's just see what happens no I I want
[39:54] to go rest at at a hotel let's just see
[39:57] what
[39:57] but as you all know the the testimony we
[40:00] got there to the kiosk and and they were
[40:02] able to get our flights I think for was
[40:05] it the next day or two days we stayed in
[40:08] Houston two days that we stayed in
[40:10] Houston and they were able to get our
[40:12] flight uh uh uh uh for in two days and
[40:17] all of us at the same time so we weren't
[40:19] separated at all so it all worked out
[40:23] and we were able to hit a good barbecue
[40:24] place too while we were waiting you know
[40:27] and uh brother Bob I'm sure he still
[40:29] dreams about
[40:31] it
[40:33] yes and we were able to to uh to and and
[40:37] as I said you know we were there at that
[40:40] barbecue place and there was a great
[40:41] Gody that just treated us so nicely I
[40:44] forget his name now
[40:45] but maybe one day he's going to get
[40:48] eternal life for doing that to us you
[40:51] know so maybe the plane was grounded or
[40:55] the for just that man right there for us
[40:58] to be able to say for two days I don't
[41:01] know I don't know so so God is the one
[41:04] who who allows these things that happen
[41:06] but see we it was the transition that we
[41:09] made was okay we're just going to go to
[41:11] the kiosk and let's see what they have
[41:14] available for us and they had a flight
[41:16] available for us 2 days later and we
[41:18] transitioned amen and we got to where we
[41:21] needed to to to go you see so that that
[41:24] is what a A Change Is and and and and
[41:27] that's what that is what transition is
[41:30] and so transition is something internal
[41:32] amen it's it's a psychological process
[41:36] and it's the way we deal with
[41:38] change it's the way we deal with how w w
[41:41] with with change because we hate
[41:45] change I I hated that we missed that
[41:48] flight because we missed two days of
[41:50] being able to minister in
[41:52] Nicaragua but God had other plans you
[41:55] see amen
[41:58] so um so transition it it affects us on
[42:03] on the physical side on the emotional
[42:05] side amen uh but it it's it's in these
[42:10] processes amen that in that transition
[42:13] amen that it's that we are changed or we
[42:16] are transformed amen praise God to
[42:19] whatever the change that the Lord wants
[42:20] to to put in our Liv so change is is is
[42:24] a challenging thing amen for humans
[42:26] because we we don't like
[42:29] change we like things to stay the same
[42:32] we don't want anything to to to change
[42:35] but we've got to have changes take place
[42:37] from time to time otherwise we would be
[42:40] stagnant amen amen praise the Lord Jesus
[42:44] and and and so what happens when we when
[42:48] we have to Pivot and
[42:50] transition is that sometimes we start
[42:53] thinking or we start thinking of the
[42:54] worst and that's when fear comes into
[42:57] picture right we start fearing and we
[43:00] start thinking well if things don't stay
[43:02] the same way then what's going to happen
[43:04] that the things aren't going to happen
[43:06] the way they they've always happened but
[43:08] sometimes we need that to
[43:10] happen amen the people the people need
[43:14] that to happen you need that to happen
[43:17] amen and so we can't let fear be the
[43:19] Tormentor in our lives when when changes
[43:22] take
[43:23] place because sometimes we create these
[43:26] pictures in our in in our minds and and
[43:28] we think that things are worse than what
[43:30] they really
[43:32] are and in reality when you let time
[43:35] pass and you let things simmer down amen
[43:38] they're really not as bad as you think
[43:40] they
[43:40] are amen now that right there that is
[43:44] the transition that's that's part of a
[43:46] transition is when you let time
[43:50] pass when you wait on God amen amen and
[43:54] you wait on his on his will amen that is
[43:57] is a that is a transitioning mode right
[43:59] there praise the Lord Jesus so so we
[44:03] can't let fear be our our Tormentor amen
[44:05] because otherwise you know we' we' we'd
[44:07] just go around biting our nails
[44:11] constantly and we can't have that amen
[44:15] now Romans 8:28 it says and we know that
[44:18] all things all things amen and now we we
[44:22] read here in Ecclesiastes chapter 3 that
[44:24] to everything there is a season right
[44:28] and Paul comes over here in Romans and
[44:30] he says and we know that all things work
[44:34] together for good for good amen all
[44:39] things work together for good
[44:43] amen and it only happens to them that
[44:46] love God Amen why because they see that
[44:51] a change happens that we need to
[44:52] transition where God's moving we got to
[44:55] move right right
[44:59] yeah to them that love God to them who
[45:02] are the called according to his purpose
[45:05] amen and his purpose is his word praise
[45:08] God and so we see and and and so
[45:11] everything that happens in your life
[45:13] doesn't happen just to happen amen there
[45:15] is a purpose for it amen amen there is a
[45:18] purpose for it and we and we've we've
[45:20] got to embrace that amen it's hard and
[45:23] and and it's it's it's uh you know it's
[45:27] we don't we don't see the clear picture
[45:29] at times but we've got to embrace that
[45:32] God if God is in us then God is leading
[45:34] our lives and that he has a a Finish
[45:38] Line a a finished product in in at the
[45:41] end amen amen right amen and this is the
[45:45] thing that that that for example our you
[45:47] know teenagers they struggle with
[45:50] sometimes they they you know they want
[45:53] to they get to a point where they want
[45:55] to get older
[46:01] and I was a teenager and many of these
[46:04] adults young people they were all
[46:06] teenagers at one point one
[46:10] day Brother Don he was 11 years old and
[46:14] 12 years old sister Susan one day you
[46:17] were 11 12 13 14 right all of us were at
[46:23] that age that you're living in at that
[46:25] time at this current time and so we want
[46:28] to oh I want to when I get older I want
[46:31] to be this and I want to do this and I I
[46:33] want to I want this to happen and I want
[46:36] to be involved with this and then when
[46:38] the changes start taking place or the
[46:42] transitions start taking place that's
[46:45] when it becomes
[46:47] tough why am I getting all these pimples
[46:49] on my
[46:51] face why is this happening to me why is
[46:54] all these changes taking place what what
[46:57] what is all this I I put cream here but
[46:59] then all of a sudden I get something
[47:00] else over here let me tell you young
[47:02] people I've been there
[47:05] yeah I used to have a lot of bad
[47:08] acne but I promise you it'll go
[47:11] away they would they told me they told
[47:13] me when I was younger when I was there
[47:15] when I was your age they said they said
[47:18] oh don't worry when you get to be about
[47:19] 18 to 21 years old all that stuff will
[47:22] start going away well it took me about
[47:25] maybe 22 23
[47:30] and and trust me you know every now and
[47:34] then you still have to battle with a
[47:35] little pimple here and
[47:37] there even if I'm 43 years
[47:40] old right so it's something that just
[47:43] stays is stays with you but that is not
[47:47] that that will change that's a
[47:49] transition that you're going through for
[47:51] a greater change to happen in your life
[47:53] right you have to trans there that and
[47:56] that's the tough part
[47:57] that's the tough part because now you're
[47:59] you're asking questions and you're
[48:01] doubting you know you have all these
[48:03] different emotions and and all these
[48:05] thoughts are racing through your head
[48:07] but believe me and trust me young people
[48:10] it is it's a normal thing amen and the
[48:13] best thing that you can do is reach out
[48:15] and talk to those who have been there
[48:17] where you
[48:19] are and who has been there where you are
[48:22] your mom and dad yeah right amen right
[48:25] people at church adult your pastor amen
[48:28] amen they've been there where you are at
[48:31] that age and so they understand and I
[48:34] certainly understand when you when you
[48:36] have trouble with the
[48:38] pimples I've been there done that and I
[48:42] know it's
[48:43] embarrassing I I know it is I know I'm
[48:45] talking here as a personal level it's
[48:47] embarrassing it can be
[48:50] but look at it in the way that it's
[48:53] you're you're you're embracing the
[48:55] transition of you becoming a better
[48:58] person of you becoming a lady or of you
[49:02] becoming a young a young man and those
[49:05] things must happen in order for you to
[49:08] be aen who God ultimately cuz God didn't
[49:11] ultimately create you to be a a a a a
[49:14] baby forever no that's right right and
[49:16] he didn't create you to be a a a a 13
[49:20] year old forever amen and he didn't make
[49:23] you to be a 15-year-old forever you know
[49:26] UL timately you're going to be 21 years
[49:28] old an adult yeah and hopefully more
[49:32] mature than what you are
[49:34] now but there's there's transitions that
[49:38] happen there because a baby can't just
[49:40] be a teenager all of a
[49:42] sudden there has to be
[49:44] transitions amen and with Transitions
[49:47] and change sometimes change is
[49:49] messy but it needs to be that way so and
[49:53] I hope that some some of your teenagers
[49:55] get don't find that encouraging
[49:58] amen so we look at we can look in the
[50:01] Bible at at examples of of change and
[50:04] transition we can look at the at the
[50:06] children of Israel amen when they were
[50:08] promised that they were going to be
[50:10] taken to a land that's flown in milk and
[50:12] humy and and and they were going to have
[50:15] a deliverer and they were going to leave
[50:17] Egypt in a mighty hand and and when
[50:21] Moses came there and God sent Moses he
[50:24] went there and and and and and they
[50:27] proved and he proved that he was God
[50:29] sent and when he went to pharaoh and
[50:31] started telling him and and let let my
[50:34] people go and Pharaoh didn't let them go
[50:37] and what he did is he he doubled their
[50:40] burdens the people were happy God has
[50:43] sent us
[50:45] change God has sent us a deliverer God
[50:48] but when the transition's part of it
[50:50] started
[50:52] happening that's not God's
[50:54] man that's not who God wanted us to to
[50:57] to to have that's not the the prophet of
[51:00] God they started they started blaming
[51:03] Moses and started blaming the what God
[51:06] was
[51:07] doing and that's that that's ultimately
[51:10] what happens with us many times and yet
[51:13] is God working amen don't you think that
[51:16] it was God working there God was working
[51:19] on the scene he just was putting them in
[51:22] a position where he can he can uh uh
[51:25] later on uh
[51:27] deliver them with a with a powerful hand
[51:29] right amen so we we know that Moses was
[51:33] sent by God and and and their their
[51:37] troubles were were doubled and their
[51:39] work was doubled but it was God that
[51:41] allowed that in their life so that they
[51:43] could get even more
[51:44] serious
[51:46] amen praise God we we can look at
[51:49] Abraham's life and Abraham how how he
[51:51] was called Amen to leave his country and
[51:55] his and his family and
[51:57] and and his comfort
[52:00] zone and and God tells him I need you to
[52:04] go and and move to this this land and
[52:07] this is where where I want you to be and
[52:09] if you don't I won't bless you I can't
[52:11] bless you amen follow me and Abraham
[52:15] amen had to embrace that transition amen
[52:18] he had to embrace change in his life
[52:21] amen in order to receive from God what
[52:23] he what God promised him that he was
[52:25] going to what he was was going to have
[52:27] otherwise he wouldn't have had it any
[52:29] other way now you think it was hard to
[52:32] to to to go tell uh uh Sarah and and and
[52:37] Sarah God this God that I don't even
[52:41] know his name he told us to
[52:44] move to
[52:48] Wyoming there's no church
[52:51] around it's just you know flat land
[52:54] everywhere
[52:55] and and uh or you know wherever it is
[52:59] put your put the state there I don't
[53:01] know anybody but God said so and I don't
[53:05] know where we're going to live I don't
[53:07] know what the you know what where where
[53:10] we going to get our next meal but God
[53:12] said so so let's do it I just wonder
[53:15] what Sarah was
[53:18] thinking you see but that's the hard
[53:21] part that was the hard things that
[53:23] Abraham was having to to to deal with
[53:25] you know we only see just God Called
[53:27] Moses and Moses I mean God called
[53:29] Abraham and Abraham moved on but I'm
[53:31] sure he had to have some struggles mind
[53:34] battles right mind battles and and and
[53:37] and issues with with with his family his
[53:40] family telling him I can't believe
[53:41] you're going over there I can't believe
[53:43] where are you going and and having
[53:45] issues maybe with his mom and his dad
[53:47] and but he obeyed God and if he didn't
[53:51] make that transition then God wasn't
[53:53] able to bless him and give him the
[53:56] promised child that he was to to have
[53:58] amen we can also look at a transition of
[54:01] David amen David when he was
[54:03] transitioning from being uh a a a a a
[54:07] little Shepherd a little Shepherd amen
[54:09] just doing what his dad was telling him
[54:11] to do and and and and learning Amen in
[54:14] that process Amen to one day fa come
[54:18] face to face with the Giant and and and
[54:21] come face to face with with lion and and
[54:24] and a bear and all these things but he
[54:27] had to transition aen one to to and go
[54:31] through all these things in order to uh
[54:34] to uh to do what the anointing that was
[54:37] upon him which was to be a king later on
[54:40] that was the change amen that was the
[54:43] change when when the prophet came and
[54:45] anointed him to be king he wasn't king
[54:47] right away he was anointed to be king
[54:49] but there was a process that he had to
[54:51] go through in order to get to that point
[54:54] amen right and you read all about that
[54:57] all the things that eventually he came
[54:59] to be king amen and and and and it was
[55:02] the perfect will of God you see so it
[55:05] was it was in the transition and you
[55:07] think it was it was easy for David it
[55:09] wasn't easy for David plus he was a
[55:11] young man he was a he was a he was a a
[55:14] teenager I think when all that all those
[55:17] changes and all those things started
[55:19] happening but he transitioned and he
[55:21] tried to Pivot Amen in order to fulfill
[55:25] what God had for his life life amen
[55:27] praise the Lord Jesus and and and one of
[55:30] the greatest changes that that I see in
[55:32] the
[55:33] scripture is in Joshua and in Joshua
[55:36] chapter 1 where we see there where it
[55:39] was time for God to transition amen from
[55:42] Moses to Joshua
[55:44] amen and and in Joshua chapter 1 you can
[55:47] read there in verse one and and it says
[55:50] now my servant Moses is dead and now
[55:54] therefore God is Con ated in the
[55:58] now God is a god of the now and he says
[56:02] now therefore amen you're anointed I'm
[56:06] paraphrasing you're anointed to go take
[56:08] these people across
[56:10] amen it it's your turn it's your turn I
[56:14] I've used my servant Moses now up to
[56:16] this point now it's your turn and we
[56:18] know that Joshua is the holy spirit amen
[56:21] is a type of the Holy Spirit and that is
[56:23] what is leading the church in this hour
[56:25] amen is the Holy Spirit leading the
[56:27] church amen it's not it's not it's not
[56:29] the ministry of a man and it's not the
[56:31] ministry of of a certain group but it's
[56:33] the ministry of the holy ghost in a
[56:36] multi bride in a in a in a multi-person
[56:38] bride
[56:39] amen praise the Lord
[56:42] Jesus last time when I preached about
[56:45] this a couple several years
[56:47] ago I preached about turning the
[56:50] corner and and and and and typed it
[56:53] typed it in with how difficult it is
[56:56] for people to let go of that brother
[57:01] brandham has passed away and they just
[57:04] can't seem to let that go but he's not
[57:08] here no brother he's not but his message
[57:11] is here the word is still here with us
[57:15] and that is what's going to take us
[57:17] through brother Bram could not take us
[57:19] through brother Bam could not take us to
[57:21] a body change the message the word takes
[57:24] us to the body change brother Brandon
[57:27] physically could not because he
[57:29] physically did not even come to that
[57:32] right do you realize that he himself is
[57:36] not going to experience what the ones
[57:38] that are alive and
[57:41] remain are going to
[57:43] experience why because he died he's he's
[57:47] he he we know that he's alive you know
[57:49] in the sixth Dimension don't get me
[57:51] wrong and he's right now with his own
[57:53] people right but he got to come back
[57:57] resurrect amen amen with the other with
[58:00] the other Saints and then those that are
[58:04] alive and remain you and me shall be
[58:07] changed that part he is not going to
[58:10] experience but it was his message that
[58:13] was going to bring us to that without
[58:16] his message we were not going to get to
[58:18] the those that are alive and remain so
[58:21] it's not putting brother brandham down
[58:23] or anything like that we thank God for
[58:26] what God did to with brother bram's life
[58:28] amen thank God but there has to be a
[58:31] transition and if we did not have that
[58:34] transition of brother brandham leaving
[58:36] the scene pass leaving the scene then it
[58:38] would not give us the opportunity to
[58:40] come to that those that are alive and
[58:43] remain why because now we're not looking
[58:45] towards brother Brandon now we're
[58:46] looking more to the word giving us Faith
[58:49] to come to that Rapture in faith you
[58:54] see to come to a body
[58:57] change to come to to receive the the uh
[59:01] that change that we also desire and so
[59:05] what it does is the fact that he left
[59:07] the scene now it makes us study his the
[59:09] message and the word more that's right
[59:13] and now we're looking to the holy ghost
[59:15] or we're looking to the Holy Ghost for
[59:17] that change to happen in our lives it
[59:19] was the same thing that happened with
[59:20] the children of Israel there Crossing
[59:23] Jordan they had their eyes all on Moses
[59:25] amen but but now Joshua a man who was
[59:28] experienced in everything cuz he was
[59:30] with Moses the whole
[59:32] time right he was with Moses the whole
[59:35] time just as the Holy Ghost was with
[59:36] brother brandham the whole time but that
[59:38] same Holy Ghost is with his people today
[59:41] it's with his bride
[59:43] today and so we're looking at the holy
[59:46] spirit amen to make the change in our
[59:49] lives and so the people had to obey amen
[59:52] Joshua's instructions in order to be
[59:55] able to cross onto the other side onto
[59:57] the promised land and they couldn't do
[59:59] it no other way Moses if Moses was
[1:00:02] supposed to be there he would have been
[1:00:05] there right if Moses was supposed to be
[1:00:09] there God would not have allowed him to
[1:00:11] pass away but he passed away Joshua had
[1:00:15] to move on Amen and it's the same thing
[1:00:18] amen with us in this our day amen we
[1:00:20] have to move on with the leading of the
[1:00:22] holy
[1:00:23] ghost things have happened and things
[1:00:26] changes have taken place but we've got
[1:00:28] to continue moving on with the holy
[1:00:31] spirit amen there's a people that needs
[1:00:33] the word there's a people that needs
[1:00:35] Ministry there's a people that needs the
[1:00:36] five-fold ministry amen we've got to
[1:00:39] move on Amen with what God has in store
[1:00:41] for us why because we are in process and
[1:00:44] marching to receive a body
[1:00:47] Chang I want to see the dead
[1:00:50] raised that's are those are scriptures
[1:00:52] that have not been fulfilled they've got
[1:00:54] to be fulfilled amen and I can't wait on
[1:00:58] on on on on the brother brand to come
[1:01:00] back or anything like that Amen in order
[1:01:02] amen I believe he's already given us the
[1:01:04] full word in this hour amen the problem
[1:01:08] is is that we're not getting in it
[1:01:10] that's
[1:01:11] right that's the problem amen and so
[1:01:14] therefore we we die we die in our own
[1:01:19] foolishness sometimes expecting for
[1:01:23] something to happen that's outside of
[1:01:25] the word amen right and it's foolishness
[1:01:28] am amen praise God so we
[1:01:32] we and and and so yeah so I had I had
[1:01:37] that last time I preached that and I had
[1:01:39] I had people coming to me because they
[1:01:41] they got upset cuz I was talking about
[1:01:43] the relics
[1:01:45] and and how and how you know people are
[1:01:47] just so so uh uh they they they've got
[1:01:51] to have their their belt buckle and and
[1:01:55] and this
[1:01:56] you know brother brandom had this
[1:01:57] toothpick in his mouth and you the
[1:01:59] preserved it you know and I'm and and
[1:02:03] all these things that that that are not
[1:02:05] going to give me eternal life amen but
[1:02:07] the message he preached
[1:02:09] will that's going to give me a body
[1:02:12] change and and I respect the ministry of
[1:02:15] of of brother brandom I I love what he
[1:02:18] did and I love the experiences he had
[1:02:20] because it's helped me it helps me in my
[1:02:23] life even now right
[1:02:26] amen but I can't I can't go on in with
[1:02:29] with relics
[1:02:31] amen those are just those that's just
[1:02:34] what it is it's it's it's relics amen
[1:02:37] it's relics that that that it's good to
[1:02:39] have pictures and it's good to have
[1:02:41] things but those things I'm not I'm not
[1:02:43] hoping for those things to take me in to
[1:02:46] give me eternal life because I have a
[1:02:48] certain picture in my or a poster in my
[1:02:51] in my house or or or something like that
[1:02:54] you see I think I think the church
[1:02:56] nowadays has moved I think they've
[1:02:58] matured a little bit more about that you
[1:03:00] know I think I think I think things are
[1:03:03] are changing because now we're looking
[1:03:05] and seeing wait a second okay we've had
[1:03:06] the relics we've had all these things
[1:03:08] we've had all these things but look what
[1:03:11] has
[1:03:13] happened people are getting off the word
[1:03:16] yeah and and their their house is full
[1:03:18] of
[1:03:20] relics and they don't even go to
[1:03:22] church and their house is full full of
[1:03:25] of pictures and and everything and and
[1:03:28] and and and and and and they don't even
[1:03:30] live the word right brother they don't
[1:03:32] even do what brother brandom told them
[1:03:33] to do and it's to go to
[1:03:35] church yet their house is full of
[1:03:37] pictures and they got everything that
[1:03:38] brother brandham had but they don't even
[1:03:40] go to church that's not going to help
[1:03:42] them you see so I'd rather have the
[1:03:44] message that he preached give me that
[1:03:48] give me that because it goes along with
[1:03:49] the
[1:03:51] word that's what I want so that it so I
[1:03:54] can get out if here amen I can't get out
[1:03:56] of here with a belt buckle and I can't
[1:03:58] get out of here with his boots I've got
[1:04:00] to get out of here with the word he
[1:04:02] preached praise God for his boots and
[1:04:05] praise God that God anointed those boots
[1:04:07] when he was wearing them and but those
[1:04:09] boots can't give me eternal life amen
[1:04:12] I've got to have the word he preached
[1:04:14] amen praise the Lord I don't even know
[1:04:16] why I got into
[1:04:18] that praise the Lord but you see the
[1:04:21] death of Moses had to happen in order
[1:04:23] for there to be that transition right
[1:04:26] amen so changes take place Moses died
[1:04:28] that was the change but the transition
[1:04:30] that was difficult was when Joshua was
[1:04:33] bringing in the people and the people
[1:04:35] had to Pivot and and then and you read
[1:04:37] that in Joshua I believe is in Joshua
[1:04:39] chapter 3 where they say everything that
[1:04:41] you say Joshua we will do they had to
[1:04:45] come to that point to say everything
[1:04:46] that you say Joshua we will
[1:04:48] do now are you willing to say that today
[1:04:52] with what God is doing now right or you
[1:04:55] just going to stay stuck in the past or
[1:04:58] stay stuck with a
[1:04:59] personality and if it's not done this
[1:05:01] way then it's not it's not it's it's
[1:05:04] it's it can't be done if it it was
[1:05:07] always done this way we always did it
[1:05:09] this way we always did but God is
[1:05:11] transitioning amen God is moving why
[1:05:14] because we are supposed to get a body
[1:05:18] change so things happen so that we can
[1:05:21] come to a body
[1:05:23] change I don't know why uh other other
[1:05:26] reasons why but but the ultimately is
[1:05:30] that the the dead the sainted dead that
[1:05:32] have passed away they must come they
[1:05:34] they've got to
[1:05:36] resurrect I'm waiting to see brother Ray
[1:05:38] Gabriel again I'm waiting to see brother
[1:05:40] Gary Atkins again brother dick all the
[1:05:43] brother brother uh uh all the brother
[1:05:46] Marlo all these brothers Amen brother uh
[1:05:49] brother um brother
[1:05:52] Al man I want to see these brothers
[1:05:54] again but I ain't going to see them with
[1:05:56] the way they went though no amen they're
[1:05:58] going to be young amen but I've got to
[1:06:01] Pivot with God's program now in order to
[1:06:03] see that you see what I'm trying to
[1:06:07] say so we've got to move on with God now
[1:06:10] brother brandom says here you cannot
[1:06:12] break the types and shadows of God
[1:06:13] that's why Israel I believe I ReRe
[1:06:18] this and he says here we've been good
[1:06:21] we've seen good things I believe this
[1:06:23] church has seen good things we've had
[1:06:25] good Ministries amen we we have had good
[1:06:29] teaching we have had wonderful we've
[1:06:32] have had a wonderful pastor with brother
[1:06:34] Dell amen we have had uh I don't I
[1:06:37] didn't get to know brother Mo but I I
[1:06:39] hear he was a really good brother and
[1:06:42] and and God bless him for the ministry
[1:06:44] that he did amen but now it's time to
[1:06:46] transition into something else now
[1:06:50] amen because why we are to get to a body
[1:06:54] change amen
[1:06:56] and so we've got to get to a point where
[1:06:57] we're supporting amen if it's in the
[1:07:00] word and if it's outside of the word I
[1:07:02] can't support that but if it's in the
[1:07:04] word I've got to move on with it you see
[1:07:08] and it won't help you if you just sit
[1:07:09] there that's right I just won't move on
[1:07:12] I'm stuck with
[1:07:14] 1985 I'm stuck with
[1:07:16] 1975
[1:07:18] 1965 no you've got to move on it's 2024
[1:07:21] and God God the the body change is
[1:07:24] taking place amen soon amen you've got
[1:07:27] to move on with the God's
[1:07:29] program amen God did things in 1985 God
[1:07:33] did things in 1975 but God is doing
[1:07:36] things in
[1:07:37] 2024 amen praise the Lord Jesus
[1:07:42] amen and for no other reason because I
[1:07:46] know sometimes us as older ones I
[1:07:49] include myself
[1:07:51] too but us older ones we're setting our
[1:07:54] ways we're just you just can't move me
[1:07:58] from here this is where I stay and we
[1:08:01] got the young people that are like
[1:08:03] asking questions they're wondering
[1:08:05] what's going on what's Happening and
[1:08:09] nobody's answering their
[1:08:11] questions they're living in this age
[1:08:14] they're experiencing the things they
[1:08:15] experienced that you experienced in
[1:08:18] 1965 but that you forgot that so you
[1:08:21] forget that there's young people now
[1:08:23] they're experiencing things in their
[1:08:25] life in
[1:08:26] 2024 and you don't want to move on on
[1:08:30] brother I'm challenging you all let's
[1:08:33] think about these other young ones amen
[1:08:35] that are growing up they got to have the
[1:08:37] word for themselves just as you had it
[1:08:40] so let's do something to give them the
[1:08:42] word let's just not stay in a in a in a
[1:08:45] in a in in a stagnant uh uh uhh pool
[1:08:49] amen a broken sister as brother Brandon
[1:08:51] preached that message amen let's move on
[1:08:54] with what God is doing now now
[1:08:57] amen so we had to have those changes we
[1:09:00] had to have we had to have the prophet
[1:09:02] leave the scene so that we weren't
[1:09:04] looking at Jeffersonville Indiana
[1:09:06] anymore but we're looking at amen the
[1:09:09] word of God this is our
[1:09:11] home this is my home
[1:09:14] amen we're not looking at the it's
[1:09:16] wonderful to go see the prophet's grave
[1:09:18] I believe there I believe there's even
[1:09:20] an anointing there amen but brother
[1:09:22] brandham can't do anything for me there
[1:09:25] right amen but the word does something
[1:09:27] for me wherever I go amen Wherever I Go
[1:09:30] amen I I it can do something for me so
[1:09:34] change and ex and and and transitions
[1:09:37] Amen in order to experience the full
[1:09:40] change there has to be a transition now
[1:09:43] even in in and with this I want to
[1:09:45] finish Even in our in the body change or
[1:09:48] in in the change of our bodies in order
[1:09:51] for us to get to that we have had to
[1:09:53] have a transition in our lives
[1:09:56] ever since you were born you are
[1:09:58] transitioning up to that point multiple
[1:10:02] changes are taking place in your life
[1:10:04] that's right amen and so in order to get
[1:10:07] to that point amen you have had to have
[1:10:10] gone through problems
[1:10:12] tribulations difficult times sad Times
[1:10:15] Hard Times uh flat tires car wrecks all
[1:10:20] kinds of
[1:10:21] stuff passing away of family members
[1:10:24] sick n all kinds of things but
[1:10:27] ultimately is to take us to the body
[1:10:29] change the ultimate amen change a body
[1:10:34] change but in order for there to be a
[1:10:36] full Chang there has to be
[1:10:38] Transitions and that's the hard part but
[1:10:42] as I always said and I you know I I love
[1:10:44] doing things online and and you know
[1:10:48] doing things as far as content
[1:10:51] and uh you know putting up content and
[1:10:54] different things and one thing that that
[1:10:56] the entrepreneurs uh say and is like one
[1:10:59] thing that they say is don't don't look
[1:11:02] at at at the finished product cuz
[1:11:05] sometimes you don't know what they you
[1:11:06] have a goal in mind right but just
[1:11:10] embrace the moment embrace the
[1:11:13] transition of to get to that finished
[1:11:15] product so embrace the moment now
[1:11:20] embrace the transition Saints embrace
[1:11:24] the growing in God
[1:11:25] amen Embrace growing in the word and
[1:11:27] learning more and praying Embrace that
[1:11:30] prayer time that you have that prayer
[1:11:32] moment embrace it amen because one
[1:11:35] prayer at a time one scripture at a time
[1:11:37] one message at a time one Church going
[1:11:39] at a time one missionary trip at a time
[1:11:42] and eventually it's taking us to that
[1:11:44] full body change amen praise the Lord
[1:11:47] Jesus embrace the moment amen and then
[1:11:50] you'll be
[1:11:51] happy and you're not you're not fearing
[1:11:53] what what's GNA happen oh no I'm out I'm
[1:11:56] out of my somebody's sitting in my seat
[1:12:01] again you're not embracing the change no
[1:12:04] that's right you're not embracing the
[1:12:07] transition you're stuck on yourself amen
