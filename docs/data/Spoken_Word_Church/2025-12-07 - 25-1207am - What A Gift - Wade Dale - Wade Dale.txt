And uh we're just so thankful that we're here one in one heart, one mind, one accord. And I tell you, there's a connection that we have. And it's him. There's no one like Jesus. And if you haven't searched around, if you haven't walked around, if you haven't looked around, do your searching and you'll never find no one like him. This song is There's no One Like Jesus. And if you haven't ever uh been here when we sing it, we're going to walk around. Okay. We walked our all our life trying to find that that quench to that thirst and we couldn't find it. And then we searched, right? We searched around. We turned around, went all over the world, looked online. There's no one like Jesus. Amen. He is the answer to every question, every sin question. There's no one like him. So, we're going to get in motion this morning. Amen. Oh, there's no one there's no one like Jesus. There's no one there's no one like him.

I tell you, if that didn't get you woke up this morning, I think the temperature actually increased in here a little bit. That's what we need. We need the fire of God in our lives. Amen. Let's just sing that chorus. While we're all standing, we're going to ask brother uh Kie. You want me to sing another song? You going to Who's doing Oh, you're doing bubble. Okay, let's um wasn't sure about that right there. But you know, we're here. I'll tell you, brother Dale, he used to say, you can't accuse us of being an organization because you know, I tell you, in the upper room, it's just let let the Lord lead how he wants to lead. And that's that's the beauty of worshiping him in our heart. Amen. Let's sing that chorus more uh precious than silver. It's in the key of sea. And we'll sing this as brother Donnie comes up for a responsive reading. Amen. How can you measure God? I think in the book of Isaiah says he's unmeasurable. No matter what you can think materialisticly wise, there's nothing that can compare to him. And and I believe that this little chorus here, it reflects that. Oh Lord, you are more preious than silver. and Lord you are for call and oh Lord you are more beautiful than I must and nothing I desire tears with you. Oh, just sing it to him once more. Oh, and Lord, you are more preious than silver and Lord to God. [Applause] are sweet and oh Lord. You are more beautiful than I [Music] can with you. Amen. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Glory. Beautiful day to come be with the Lord today. Be with all of his little lights as shining seeds out here. So good to see everybody's faces. Uh we're going to be reading from Psalm 64 this morning. This one this one kind of touched me. It's a little different, but all of God's word and u before we go to we're going to read them all too, brother Anderson. There's not that many. Um before we go to his word, let's just thank him for being here and being blessed this morning. Precious heavenly father, we thank you for this day you've come given us gather around your word, Lord, and to hear your word. And we've heard your word this morning from beautiful Sunday school class and beautiful music. Lord, you've come down and blessed us, Father God, once again. You said, "Where two or more meet, there I'll be also." And Lord, I believe you're here so strong today. And I ask you, Lord, to just continue pouring out your blessings of revelation of your word to us more than anything. Father, it's what we need today so that we can shine to the other people. Folks, Father, I know that there's people in the world that I talk to sometimes. You come on the scene and they're pulled, but they don't understand. And I ask you, Lord, just to bless those people out there, Father, that we're a very special group that can take this word, Lord, and you just have your way with us. Forgive us of our sins. And Father, bless those that couldn't make it through the door today. Whatever their hinders are, just bless them and be with them. And bless all our children that's still out there in the world. Father, the seed was planted when they was here, they heard it. So Lord, you just have your way with them and bring them in the fold. We ask now, Lord, as we go through this day, I ask you to touch and bless Brother Wade as he's bringing your word to us, Father. And he's he's trying so hard, Lord. Just bless him. And you just be that voice that comes out of that man when he's up here in this pull pit preaching. And all of them, Lord, that's here. We ask now, Father, that the ears be open, the heart be receiving, and Father, as we go to your word, we thank you for this day. We ask these things in your name, Jesus Christ. Amen. Hear my voice, oh God, in my prayer. Preserve my life from fear of the enemy. &gt;&gt; From the secret of the wicked, from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity, &gt;&gt; who wet their tongues like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words. secret. &gt;&gt; They encourage themselves in an evil matter. They commune of laying snares privately. They say, "Who shall see them?" search. &gt;&gt; But God shall shoot at them with a arrow. Suddenly shall they be wounded. &gt;&gt; And all men shall fear and shall declare the work of God. For they shall wisely consider of his doing. And the righteous shall be glad in the Lord and shall be trusted in him. And all upright in heart shall glory. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you for the reading of the word. You may be seated. Bless you. Joseph, would you come and take up the offering this morning? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. Let's um Amen. Just sing this course. I think we have a special this morning. And um we just thank the Lord that um his presence is here. And not only that, but he's here to meet every need. And uh we can all testify and relate to this song. Mercy rewrote my life. We live that out in a rewritten way, but it was always in God's mind what you were going to be. But I'll tell you, it's his grace. Amen. And mercy, mercy rewrote my life. Oh God's mercy, he rules my life. I should have called my soul cast out mercy reoot my life. [Music] God's mercy re [Music] his mercy my life for I should my soul pass down. God's mercy. [Applause] We're going to ask sister would we ask sister LSE if she'll make her way up here. Let's sing that once more as she comes for her special. Oh mercy rewrote my life. God's mercy rerote my life. For I should have fallen thy soul cast down the mercy. [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Silent night, holy night [Music] is gone.

[Music] Christ the Savior is born. Christ the Savior is [Music] silent night. [Music] Holy light, son of God. Love pure love [Music] from thy holy face with the dawn of redeeming grace. Jesus Lord. [Music] Jesus Lord of the earth. [Music] [Applause] You know, some of these songs that we sing during this uh time, some of you might say, well, it's just tradition to sing those songs. But if you listen to the lyrics, &gt;&gt; you can identify Lord of that birth, revelation of one God. You see grace loves pure light, light and life. We see light in his light. There's so many connections that come together if you'll just step out of the tradition. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, speak to me through this song. Let me hear the lyrics. Let them be part of my testimony and experience." And it's beautiful. It's took me many years to get to that point to realize that because sometimes you just walk in this life kind of numb. But sometimes there's that presence of God when he comes by your path. He makes it a whole new way. You listen to the bird sing. You see the sunshine. There's a birth in your own life. And and that's what I can testify this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's light and life in their life. Lord at that birth. Amen. And I really appreciate that. Thank you, Meliss. Amen. Let's um let's sing this song. How great is our God before brother Wade comes out. Amen. We serve a great God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Greater than all our sins, all our faults, all your situations. From this life into beyond, he'll take us. Amen. Amen. The splender of a king. Oh, he's clothed in majesty. Let all the earth rejoice. Let all the earth rejoice. Yes, he wraps himself in light. Oh, in darkness tries to hide, but trees is his voice. trembles at his voice. How great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. And oh, see how great, how great is our God. [Applause] days to which he stands. Oh, when time is in his hands again and in the end. Again and in the end, the God can free our world. Oh, father, spirit, son. The lion in the lamb. The lion in the lamb. How great is our God. Oh, see me how great is our God. Oh, see how great, how great is there always the name above all names. Oh, he's the name above all names. It's worthy of all. Can you praise it? All my heart will see how great is our God. Oh, let's stand this morning and just worship him. For he's the name above all name. And he's worthy of our praise.

That's what we'll be from here &gt;&gt; because of that name. &gt;&gt; What that man did &gt;&gt; to give us hope. &gt;&gt; How great is our God. Why? He's the name. Oh, he's the name above all name. He is worthy of our praise. My heart will sing. How great is our God. Sing it to him one more time. How great is our God. Oh my. How great how great is our God. Sing with me. How great is our God. All the world will see. &gt;&gt; How great. How great is our God. Amen. God bless you. Let's give our Lord a hand clap of praise. Oh, it's good to know. Good to know that name and be part of that family because all the whole world is named Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that's who we come today to worship here. Um we are uh happy to see all of you. We do have church on Sundays uh during the year uh not just on Easter and Christmas. So well anyway, but it is a special time. It's a special time for us to come and and enjoy the holidays and you know you can uh we can be real dogmatic about it and but uh I'm going to read you some quotes today where brother Random preached a very wonderful sermon. It's called God's wrapped gift. He preached it on Christmas Day. &gt;&gt; Christmas day. So we're going to speak on what a gift. I know sometimes uh my dad never did uh uh preach themes. He just kept right on preaching what we needed. But today, I thought we would kind of since we have a lot of visitors here, we could just drop back and speak about a man that was born a baby. He was wrapped, but he came to be unwrapped. &gt;&gt; He was sealed, but he came to be unsealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; He came in flesh, but nobody understood him being in flesh. &gt;&gt; But that was God's wrapped gift. That's the way he wanted to come. &gt;&gt; He decided to come that way. &gt;&gt; He didn't come the way that the the religious world had him come. &gt;&gt; That's why they hated him. So, God bless you. Good to be in the house of the Lord. Get some of these out of the way. Brother Aaron will be speaking for us Wednesday night. Uh happy holidays to all of you. Now, as soon as we're finished here, we'll go out, get in the car, and go down to the um Hidden Acres. Uh if you don't have the address, follow somebody and we'll give you the address. But it's catered meal for everybody. There are plenty to eat, and we'll be giving out some gifts and stuff down there and honoring our uh ones that uh that do the work here. And u we sure appreciate them and we we appreciate them very very much. And uh you can't have a church. You know, uh brother Bram said, "We're not an organization. We're an organism. &gt;&gt; An organism needs pieces and parts. &gt;&gt; Just like a body needs pieces and parts." Because without one without one finger, you're not a complete body. &gt;&gt; So even though we might be a finger, God's not complete without you. Right. &gt;&gt; I want to read you something from um that the uh sister uh Esther sent us um said, "Brother Wade, Sister Junior Church family, thank you for the beautiful spray arrangements that was sent for Sharon's funeral. The flowers were beautiful and brought a sense of peace to the room. We appreciate your prayers and all the other things, texts, visits, cards, and support during that time. Meal was wonderful and much appreciated." And Sharon would have said, she would have said no, no, no. She said yes, yes, good, good, good food. So, but your kindness has meant so much to us. Thank you for continued prayers for the family. And that's from the Canada family. So, thank you all for participating in the u um homegoing ceremony for sister Sharon. And uh she's uh she's not walking around with her arm all drawled up. I'll promise you that. No, no, no, no. That ain't the We might That may be the way we leave this world, but that ain't the way we jump over into that other dimension. &gt;&gt; All that stays here. &gt;&gt; We have a new body, but it's inside your body right now. Helping to change you. There's not, you don't have a body over there that's hanging up in a closet waiting on you to go over there. No, this is what's going to carry you there. &gt;&gt; Your soul is what's going to carry you to the other dimension. And you are a soul. Amen. So, we know that. Um, I also want to um go ahead and thank the ones that are working downstairs and working at the venue now that are getting things ready for us to have our uh Christmas dinner. Um, I know maybe that um uh there's when we first came in message, you know, Christmas was of the devil. Um that kind of Easter was okay. Um, but then you had uh all the other things were of the devil and you had this and that and all of the devil and TVs were of the devil and somehow that all creeped in cuz I'm not going to ask you to raise your hand if you got a television in your house. Brother said he'd take it out and shoot it. That's what he said. I'm just saying, you know. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he never denied Christmas. Never did. He preached God's wrapped gift. Why Bethlehem? We have seen his star in the east. And he preached them on Christmas day, the day before, the day after. And he thanked him. And I'm going to read. I think I got one where he thanked everybody for the Christmas presents. Because we're going to talk about the greatest Christmas gift that was ever given. &gt;&gt; And it was wrapped. And you know, you can wrap. We used to to fake people out, our kids out. We would wrap something little in a great big box. make them think they was getting something. Daniel, hey, my kids thought, man, I'm getting it'd be a little old box with a with a ton of toy in it or something. So, unless you open the package, &gt;&gt; you will not know what's inside. &gt;&gt; Unless you open the gift, you will not know what's inside. So, I adore you today, all you ones that are that are visiting here, find that gift today. &gt;&gt; Amen. That gift is Jesus Christ, but it's also the Holy Ghost that he gave is the greatest gift to you and I. And he's not a baby anymore. &gt;&gt; No, he's not a baby anymore. If you'd like to turn to the book of Luke, we'll begin here and uh and start. Um I was um noticing uh Brother Joe Canada when when y'all were singing um you know, I walk around all over and search around all over. I noticed there was no black eyes. There was some elbows slung. They were doing this, Brother Donnie, and there was people leaning around. We kind of got we kind of got a a lot of people in a short uh building. So, I want you to pray with me. Uh we're going to um try to coming up this year expand the church. All right. We're going to try our best. Uh I put a fleece before the Lord um six months ago that if two things would happen that it would be a nod for him to allow us to build on and they both happened. &gt;&gt; Um one was quite a miracle. So they both happened though. So we're good. and we're going to try to get together maybe with the the uh trustees and the deacons and and some of you that build and all that and and figure out something to do. We're not going to um fleece the people or borrow any money. All right? We're going to try to do it as the Lord and if it's for the if it's of the Lord, it'll be there. Uh brother Dale did the same thing when he had it on from that door backwards. He said he told somebody, Sister Lisa and one of them said, "Well, when we get the certain amount of money in the bank, we're going to start doing it." Well, by the time we got finished, that certain amount of money was back, wasn't it? That certain amount, whatever we spent, $30, $40,000, by the time they finished it, that money was right back in in. So, you can't out give God. There is no way you can outgive God. No way. If you do it right. And I don't want to do it to have a big church, but I do want it to where uh the sisters don't have to stand in line to use the two bathrooms and and uh y'all don't have to, you know, worship like this, but we'll see what we can do. But just keep it in your prayer. Please pray that um that we'll do it right and uh we'll be looking at all that. So, God bless you. Um we have got stuff coming up with Chris Long and different ones coming in. So, we'll we'll announce that later, but let's bow our heads. Lord, thank you for this day. Thank you for the fellowship that we have, the building that we have. Lord, it's been renovated several times. Lord, we know that it's all because of you. It's not because of a program. As brother Joe said, it's not not a program. It's not We sing better, we do this better, Lord. It's because we want to serve you better. And Lord, we want to hear from you, Lord, and have a comfortable place for the believers to come, Lord, and and worship you in spirit and truth. Father, it's all for you. Nothing for anything else. Lord, we pray that you'd be with us now in the further of this service. Be with the ones that are sick. Sister Anna Canard, different ones, Lord, that are sick now. I pray that you would touch their body. Uh, Brother Danny back there, Lord, with nerve in his shoulder hurting him. Lord, I pray that before this service is over, Lord, that that thing will be healed. Father, because you're you're the one that sent your word and you're the one that healed us. We we love doctors. Doctors are fine, but Lord, there's no doctor on the face of this earth except Dr. Jesus that can put us back together because you're not just a physician. Lord, you're a great physician. And Lord, I depend on you for all those things. Forgive us of our sins and bless us, Lord, in Jesus name. Amen. Luke 2 verse 4. And Joseph also went up from Galilee out of the city of Nazareth into Judea unto the city of David, which is called Bethlehem, because he was of the house and lineage of David, to be taxed with Mary his espoused wife, being great with child. And so it was that while they were there, the days were accomplished that she should be delivered. And she brought forth her firstborn son, and wrapped him in swaddling cloth. Now, we'll talk about this. Brother Ramble will tell you what you know what that is. That is if all we know what horses are, right? Remember, you don't just put a saddle on a horse, you put a blanket down. Well, the oxen back then had a cloth that went around their neck to keep the um the yolk from from rubbing on their skin and it was full of sweat. It smelled like oxen cuz that I'll guarantee you them blankets unless they're clean, they're smelly. But they smell like they smell like what it is. Well, you know what? Jesus was wrapped in swaddling clothes. The only thing they could have that they had to put around him cuz I know all everybody, you know, when our babies are born in the hospital and we love them to death that what's the first thing they do? They wrap them babies up cuz they're freezing. They come out of 98.6 degrees into about a 50 degree degree room, you know. So, you can imagine back then they didn't have all that. This baby was born probably on some straw and they had to clean him up and Joseph was helping and my this was God. But his mama wrapped him up in swaddling clothes and laid him in a manger because there was no room for them in the end. You may be seated. The Lord add his blessing to the reading of the word. In Luke 2:10, it continues on and there's something comes in into the view and that's angels. So the angel said unto them, "Fear not, for behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy, which shall be to all people. For unto you this day, for you is born this day in the city of David, a Savior, which is Christ the Lord." And this shall be a sign. Now, see, there's a sign. This will be a sign unto you. You shall find the babe wrapped in swaddling clothes and lying in a manger. All right? So, when he was born, now we know one thing's for sure. The swaddling cloth was not holy. &gt;&gt; It was something they had. It was something that they used to wrap the baby up with. But the real wrapping on the gift that we were were getting ready to receive, the world was is flesh. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; God chose that. He didn't choose to come an angel that never had a sin or never did anything. We know Jesus didn't sin, but he came under the law. He came to do away with sin, but he had to do it in human flesh because that's where we fell. We fell in human flesh. All right, everybody with me? So, we're going to just go back a little bit. I did some history um on the city of Bethlehem because why wasn't Jesus born in Jerusalem? That was the most holy city in the world at the time. Why wasn't he born in Jericho? Why wasn't he born in in Nazareth? He was born in Bethlehem because of a couple of reasons. And we'll look at these. We know one thing's for sure. The scripture said he was. But how did all this happen with the town of Bethlehem? Micah 5:2 says, "But thou Bethlehem Ephraatha, thou though thou be little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of thee shall he who Christ come forth unto me that is to be the ruler of Israel, whose going forth have been of old from everlasting." So there is your there is your um prophecy that Jesus, the ruler of Israel, is going to come from Bethlehem. Now, looking these things up, I don't have them on the screen. I'll just talk to you in a minute. Uh Joshua, when Joshua divided the land, we got to go back several hundred years. When Joshua divided the land, remember Jesus was the lion of the tribe of Judah. So, he had to come from the lineage of Judah. All right, everybody with me? We know he wasn't physically, but he was told in the scripture that he would come from the tribe of Judah and he would be the lion of the tribe of Judah. So, we know that come through Joseph. But listen, Judah's portion when Joshua went across and divided the land up, Judah's portion was where Bethlehem was located. All right? Not a coincidence because he had to be of the tribe of Judah. What's interesting about Bethlehem is it's a country that where most all of the wheat and barley are produced for for Israel &gt;&gt; back then. Now, not now. Back then, very small town. Interesting that wheat and barley when you cook it, it makes what? Bread. when Jesus said, "I am that bread that come down out of heaven." &gt;&gt; Why, little Bethlehem? So, to get the story completely straight, this is going to be strange. And I don't know if you knew this or not, but Judah's son, Salmon, now, is everybody familiar with Salmon? Not Solomon. Salmon. Salmon is the one that married Rahab, &gt;&gt; the harlot, &gt;&gt; the gentile, the one that was saved by sanctification in that she trusted that the people of Israel served the correct God. &gt;&gt; I hope you get something from this today. &gt;&gt; They were She knew that he was that they were serving the correct God. So she said, "I'll harbor the two fugitives or witnesses, spies, but I want you to save my family." Can we stand up today? Even though being Gentiles as we are, can we say, "God, save our family. &gt;&gt; Save our whole family." You said, "Well, I don't know about &gt;&gt; Give it to God. &gt;&gt; Quit trying to figure out how to do it. &gt;&gt; Give it to God. Because you know what? Rahab didn't sit there in her house and figure out how it was going to happen. &gt;&gt; She didn't know that wall was going to fall. She knew that they were defeated, but she didn't know that wall was going to fall. And when that wall fell, &gt;&gt; her house was built on the side of that wall. &gt;&gt; Well, when you want when the Israelites walked into the into the city, it was nothing but rubble except for one tower standing up just like this. And there was a red scarlet rope &gt;&gt; sanctification. &gt;&gt; She had done what she was supposed to do. She did everything God told her to do through the two spies. &gt;&gt; And Joshua spared her life. Amen. &gt;&gt; So here comes Salmon, which was a general. He marries Rahab &gt;&gt; and they founded or co-founded or had a piece of finding the city of Bethlehem. &gt;&gt; Now, who was born in that city before Jesus was? Well, when Salomon and Rahab got together, they had a son named Boaz, &gt;&gt; which was half Gentile, &gt;&gt; half Jew, right? And he married a Moabitis woman, another gentile, a Moabitete named Ruth. &gt;&gt; And they had a child named Oed. Now, this is all in in Bethlehem. They had a son named Oed. Oed had a son named Jesse. &gt;&gt; Jesse had a son named David. &gt;&gt; And David was going to be the king. And you know what? He was anointed in that city &gt;&gt; out in the field in the outskirts. But he was anointed while they were living in Bethlehem. And then God tells the whole world through the scriptures and through all the the Old Testament that that there would be a son of David would come and would rule the whole world and he would sit on the throne of David and rule for an eternity. &gt;&gt; They didn't know who it was. They just knew there was one coming &gt;&gt; that would rule as David ruled. All this was done in Bethlehem. But now to fulfill another scripture, Jesus was not born in Nazareth. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; But that's where Joseph and Mary was from. They had to travel to Bethlehem to be taxed. Okay, we just send ours in the mail. But they had to travel to be taxed because he had to be not born in Nazareth, but born in Bethlehem, but he had a Nazer Nazerite vow that he carried from that city back. And when he was born and got up a little bit older, they went back to Nazareth. &gt;&gt; All right. But they had to go to Bethlehem because of all the way back from Joshua dividing the land and Judah got this portion. And to be the line of the tribe of Judah, scripture has to be perfect. It has to be that he is the line of the tribe of Judah coming out of Judah and Judah's lineage. &gt;&gt; What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; But remember one thing, they were not all Israelites. Rahab was a harlot. I hope y'all see this. Rahab was a harlot. What kind of grace was that? That was that sanctification that was hanging out of that rope, hanging that rope off of his off of her uh apartment. &gt;&gt; And remember when you look at Rahab, you know Jesus, there was a time when we'll go forward a little bit. There was a time when Jesus was standing somewhere and there was a bunch of Pharisees brought a woman that had been caught in the act of adultery. &gt;&gt; Caught by these three men in the act of adultery. &gt;&gt; And they brought her to Jesus and said, "Master, we've caught this lady in the very act of adultery." Now, back then, they stoned you and killed you. Both of them, man and woman. We would have a lot less population today if they would do that. But that's how serious it is though. But look at the grace that's involved here because what did Jesus do? Jesus said, "All right, lady. Where's your accuser?" She's right here. There. I mean, you know, they said, "Wait, we saw her do it." He said, "Okay." So, he gets down and he starts writing in the ground uh writing on the ground. And there's all kind of uh theories of what was written down, but I think maybe he was writing and he said, "Uh, okay, Rabbi Jones, you were uh you were seen drinking a lot of alcohol yesterday." And he was writing their life &gt;&gt; in that in that sand. Because as when he got finished writing that sand, he looks up and he says, "Who here without sin can cast the first stone?" Right? &gt;&gt; What was Jesus doing? Cuz Jesus had to be under the law even though he was God. And he had to go by the law, which said if you were caught in the act of adultery, you were to be taken out and stoned. &gt;&gt; All right? That was witnesses. Somebody witnessed that. &gt;&gt; So Jesus knew he'd not seen that happen. I hope somebody gets this right here. Jesus had not seen her commit adultery. &gt;&gt; So he knew being under the law he had to get rid of the witnesses &gt;&gt; cuz he looked up again and all three of them were gone. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Lady, where are your accusers?" &gt;&gt; She said, "I have none." In other words, he said, "Sister," he said, "I I've done away with all your fault." &gt;&gt; Remember what did he say? Go and sin no more. &gt;&gt; You're you're good. You're okay. What about grace? &gt;&gt; So, God got rid of her accusers. Now, what happened in in uh when Rahab was on that wall, the wall come down to Jericho, you know, I mean um yeah, Jericho. And to be real honest, she was a prostitute. So she knew many men in the city, if you know what I mean. She was well known cuz she had a cuz she had an apartment on the wall. She wasn't in poverty. But for Salmon to marry a prostitute, that sounds harsh. But what did he do? God said, "You've done so much for me. This is what I'm going to do for you." Because if you'll read your Bible, every man in Jericho was killed. &gt;&gt; God did away with her witnesses. &gt;&gt; God did away with her witnesses so that she could marry. And God himself come through that lineage. &gt;&gt; Through that lineage. So when the devil comes to you and says so and so and so and so, just look around and say, &gt;&gt; "I have no accuser for that. &gt;&gt; God saw me righteous." &gt;&gt; He saw me righteous to begin with. &gt;&gt; I know we have problems. We have to ask God to forgive us. But when are we going to start believing that the Bible says we're going to be without spot or wrinkle? Spot or wrinkle. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not going to have a spot on us. The prophet of God tells us the sinless, perfect &gt;&gt; bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, when we going to start believing that? &gt;&gt; Cuz God is getting ready to get rid of our accusers. &gt;&gt; And the greatest accuser is who? The devil. &gt;&gt; So, if you don't have the devil in your soul today, you have got rid of the accuser. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, he may play with your body and he may play with your spirit, but he's not going to get your soul. Your soul is going to always believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, I just wanted to throw that in there. And now, let's go back to the baby. But, like I said before, you can't know what this package is until you unwrap it. You kind of don't know what it is. You see the wrapping and you see the shape of the box and we get things at the post office and we look at it and go, "I don't know what that is." You'll never know until you unwrap it. &gt;&gt; But now remember, 90% of the time, the one that gives the gift knows what's in it. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Cuz you wrap it yourself. &gt;&gt; Doesn't matter what it looks like on the outside. If you wrapped it, you know what's inside. Right? &gt;&gt; So, God knew what was inside when he wrapped that baby 2,000 years ago in human flesh. &gt;&gt; He knew where he was going to be. He knew who he was. He knew he wasn't a second person of a Trinity. He was the person of God himself, manifested as a baby. You say, "I don't believe that." Well, okay. That's your problem to not believe. God said, "I'm going to have a virgin that will conceive and bring forth a child, and his name will be called what?" &gt;&gt; Emmanuel, which is God, not a second person. &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown tells us many times that that Jehovah was laying in a cradle crying. Jehovah with no teeth. &gt;&gt; Jehovah that couldn't talk at first. Jehovah that fell down probably maybe got a spanking from mom and dad because the Bible said he learned by the things that he suffered cuz he was always human but inside of that humanity was almighty God. &gt;&gt; All right, everybody with me? &gt;&gt; And it grew and it kept growing and it grew some more. &gt;&gt; So we know that Bethlehem the the meaning of Bethlehem Beth Elheam is the house of God's bread. That's why wheat and barley was raised in Bethlehem. And I don't know if it is today, but that was back then. That was the center of the barley and wheat fields. Because remember who owned all that? Boaz owned it at one time. Remember, he owned fields. You couldn't even you can't even count how many fields that Boaz had. That was in Bethlehem &gt;&gt; because of God being the bread of life. &gt;&gt; And Jesus being able to stand and say that that I am the bread that come down out of heaven. So Genesis 49:9 here's going to tell us this is where it comes from Judah. Judah is a lion's wel line of the tribe of Judah from the prey my son that thou art gone up he stooped down he couched as a lion as an old lion who shall rouse him up. Now look, the se scepter scepter shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shallow come and unto him shall the gathering of the people be. Now the scepter is the word. If you look up that scepter, it can mean the word. So the word shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet until shallow. Shallow is where the ark of the covenant landed and that was a sacred place from then on. But Shiloh also means Christ because Christ was in that ark. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is telling us exactly where Jesus is coming from, what lineage he's coming from, and from between his feet. In other words, he's going to be born &gt;&gt; in Bethlehem out of the tribe of Judah. And listen, this person is going to have to be human because the scripture tells us, and this is Moses talking, which is what? Human flesh. &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee a prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren, like unto me. So, he's not coming an angel. He's not coming a priest. He's coming a prophet. &gt;&gt; But he is coming in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Unto him you shall hearken. But now remember, why did they not believe him? He came exactly the way the Bible said. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 7:13, he said, "Hear you now, oh house of David? Is it a small thing for you to weary men? But will you weary my God also? Therefore, the Lord himself shall give you a sign. Behold, a virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and shall call his name Emmanuel. which is interpreted as what? &gt;&gt; God with us. Not a second a person. God with us. &gt;&gt; All right. How can that be? That's the only way it could be. &gt;&gt; He could not be born a human man fullrown to be our brother. &gt;&gt; Melazdc was God Almighty in human flesh. &gt;&gt; Melazdc was God Almighty in human flesh. The theophony of God was Melazdc. But when he met Abraham, he was a fullg grown man. &gt;&gt; You and I were not born full grown men and women. &gt;&gt; We were born babies. &gt;&gt; So that same theophony or that same spirit of God had to enter into a flesh &gt;&gt; and be a baby and come listen come from the same place all of us came from. &gt;&gt; We all came from the womb. Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; So, he had to come through the womb to be exactly our brother. &gt;&gt; But the world didn't know what they were dealing with cuz every time he would try to unwrap itself. &gt;&gt; The world wrapped him back up. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; It's going to be simple with just a Christmas present to you. is the greatest gift that's ever been given. &gt;&gt; So that he had to be a human baby. God had to be wrapped in human flesh. So God's wrapped gift 1225 Christmas day 1960. The love of God, how God unfolded himself and come a Christmas package was laid on straw. The first thing he had was to press against his little head with straw and a dirty piece of swaddling cloth wrapped around him. The last thing he had on was a crown of thorns with a dirty rag wrapped around him and people hitting him on the head. Say, "If you're a prophet, tell us who hit you." God's wrapped gift. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He laid on straw soft. He died with a crown of thorns on his head. But he had to do that. We'll get to it just a second. He had to do that to reveal himself. &gt;&gt; Nobody understood him. Listen, for the whole 30 something years he lived, nobody understood him. His mama denied even the virgin birth. &gt;&gt; AND SHE WAS THE ONE THAT was there. &gt;&gt; Tell me how spirit can get on somebody now. Spirit got on her bad. &gt;&gt; She said, "Your father and I have sought you diligently." Brother Barham said right there, "She denied the virgin birth." Well, she's the one that ought to know it was a virgin birth. How well do we forget as we walk this journey of Christianity how we got here? &gt;&gt; She did. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist did. &gt;&gt; Come on. John the Baptist was groomed his whole life to introduce one man. &gt;&gt; And when he put him in prison, he sent two of his disciples and said, "Are you the one or am I going to are they going to be another one come? How well do we get away sometimes from our walk of Christianity because we've been in it for a long period of time? &gt;&gt; We should today take oursel and examine &gt;&gt; what's going on in our life to realize we have not went away from God. We've got closer to God. &gt;&gt; We know who he is. We know where he's at. &gt;&gt; We know he's coming. We know he's already come in certain in in in in flesh yours and mine. And &gt;&gt; we'll get to that in a minute. We want to give you a real good Christmas gift here in just a minute. It won't be very long. &gt;&gt; I don't know when we eating down there, but we can go down fellowship. Love reached out when his own children cried for his blood and he screamed, "Father, forgive them. They don't know what they're doing." That's love. The church don't want that. They want creed. We need love. The church is dying by creeds. It can only live by love because love is eternal. Love overcomes all things. Love's the most powerful force there is. &gt;&gt; How about somebody take and beat you to a pulp and you still forgive them &gt;&gt; and say I love you and mean it. &gt;&gt; That's what that is. &gt;&gt; The capstone comes with love &gt;&gt; because with love there's grace. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. without without the love of God for Rahab, she would have fell with the rest of them because I'm sure she's not the only harlot that was in Jericho. &gt;&gt; But God knew in her heart before the foundation of the world that some two he sent two spies that she would say, &gt;&gt; "I'll do it. &gt;&gt; I'll But you but" but what was her greatest thing? She said, "I'll do it, but you got to protect my family." &gt;&gt; Remember he told then the two spies when they came up, they told her they said, "You get in your house." Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; You get in your house and let that scarlet rope down and we won't bother you or your house. How can we do now as we as Christians today? We need to place the blood back on our children again, back on our husbands and our wives and even on oursel &gt;&gt; to see that there's something there's a blood atonement for our sins and for our sanctification &gt;&gt; that we had died daily though but we have a sanctifying blood that gives a sanctifying life. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? Hebrews 10:5, "Wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith sacrifice and offerings thou wouldest not." In other words, it was lamb after lamb, dove after dove, uh ox after ox. I mean, they were millions of sacrifices were made during Solomon's time and all the different ones and and Moses. But God really only wanted one thing. He wanted a body that he could live in that was prepared by God himself. Don't you think that the devil wanted to kill Jesus every chance he could? &gt;&gt; He could feel that spirit. He knew that there was something different about that kid. &gt;&gt; And listen, let me tell you something. You say, "Well, that was for Jesus only." No, let me tell you something. There's one difference between you and the Lord. &gt;&gt; He was born with eternal life. &gt;&gt; You were not. I don't care what anybody in the message says. &gt;&gt; You were not born eternal. &gt;&gt; You were born dead &gt;&gt; and had to have this new birth &gt;&gt; because your first birth wasn't worth it. &gt;&gt; But remember, Jesus's first birth was had it should have been had they not been a fall. &gt;&gt; Revelations 3:14 says he was the beginning of the creation of God. &gt;&gt; GOD WANTED TO CREATE ALL OF US. HE HAD us in his mind. And he was going to bring us in flesh. He was going to bring us through Adam and Eve. Every how you want to say it. But it had to be spoken. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; NOT AN ACT OF SEX. &gt;&gt; SO, how was he going to come and cleanse it? He was going to come without an act of sex. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; As a virgin shall conceive. And God created in her womb both egg and sperm. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, he was not Jew or Gentile. Not Not physically. &gt;&gt; Okay. I mean, spiritually he came from the tribe of Judah. Spiritually that was through Joseph. But Joseph had nothing to do with that birth. &gt;&gt; Mary had nothing to do with that birth. &gt;&gt; It was a creation of God. And I believe he took the egg and the sperm from his mind. &gt;&gt; Where'd you come from? But because of the fall, you had to come by mom and daddy. &gt;&gt; But in the mind of God, when you get born again, brother Bram said, it's a what? It's an act. It's an act of conception. That should have been that way had there not been a fall. That's why you have to have a new birth. &gt;&gt; Your first birth will kill you. &gt;&gt; But a body hast thou prepared me? Now, we say that was Jesus, and that's fine and dandy. But listen, if you're a born again Christian today, if you have the the word of God, the eternal life in your soul, he has prepared your body, too. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Right now, today, &gt;&gt; what are we missing? Are we waiting for something else to happen? No. We need a Christmas every day of of our life. We need a continual opening of the word of God &gt;&gt; to see that the gift is always there &gt;&gt; but a body. John 1:1 in the beginning was the word. The word was with God and the word was God. Verse 14. And the word was wrapped or made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory. We saw him. &gt;&gt; Peter, ONE OF THEM SAID, WE TOUCHED HIM. WE TALKED TO HIM. THEY ATE WITH HIM. THEY SLEPT WITH HIM. BUT DID THEY UNDERSTAND HIM? NO. &gt;&gt; They only stood they understood a piece of it because when Peter said, "Thou only have the words of eternal life. Where else could we go?" There was something about the man that they loved. &gt;&gt; And it was a connection from the foundation of the world. God put all them in the in the place that they were in even Judas. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To perform his part. All right. So the word was wrapped or made flesh. So the greatest gift that came was not the creation of the world. It was the creation of you. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter how you get here is how you get out of here. Because we know for a fact everybody in this world was born the same way &gt;&gt; except one person. &gt;&gt; And when we get into that person, &gt;&gt; he's took the first birth away and give us a new birth. &gt;&gt; As the song says, give them second birth. I was thinking about the uh if you look on uh song books, we don't use them anymore. That's our song book. But if you look in the song books, there was probably I think there was 200 and something songs written by Charles Wesley and they were a lot of them were Christmas songs. So that all came right I mean there was a bunch. If you'll look in the in the red book you'll see who wrote it right on the top and it'll say Charles Wesley or somebody like that. They wrote these so that we can sing them now and they still mean something now as much as they meant something back then. &gt;&gt; So everybody with me? So today in the end time, let's just say back for three and a half years when he was on earth, as I said before, he tried to unwrap himself. He tried to tell the world who he was. He tried to tell him, "I am the bread of life. I am this. I am that. I am the son of God." Remember, he didn't say that. They said he was. He said he was the son of man. He's trying to get them to see that. But what happened? The religious world rejected the gift because they couldn't get past the wrapping. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; One more time. They couldn't get past the wrapping. &gt;&gt; The wrapping was flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; But he came the exact Listen, he couldn't have been Jesus Christ if he came any other way than the word. &gt;&gt; He couldn't be Almighty God if he if he came contrary to his word. But they were so blinded to what they did was is they wrapped him back up in their creed. Brother Brown, I'm going to read it here in just a minute. He wrapped denominations wrapped him up in their wrapping paper &gt;&gt; and they kept him wrapped up. &gt;&gt; But only in the end time, folks, have we come to a place to where the real wrapping paper has been tore off &gt;&gt; and we see the unveiled God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That now he's not just a baby anymore. He's in me and you. &gt;&gt; You and I are the recipient of that gift. &gt;&gt; Which was what? Eternal life. The Jews answered and said, "For a good work we stoned thee not." Oh, they loved him when he fed him and healed him. But for blasphemy, because thou thou being a man, makest thyself God. &gt;&gt; No, we know what that statement. We flip it around. He was really God making himself a man. &gt;&gt; They couldn't see the wrapping. Listen, if they couldn't see the wrapping then, how they going to see the rapping today? &gt;&gt; Now, the only thing you can do is you can This is your This is your wrapping paper &gt;&gt; cuz they're not going to really see the true gift inside of you because it's eternal life. &gt;&gt; All right. But they're going to see what you walk around in. That's why our sisters, as our brother said, our sisters, we dress the way we dress. Men, we act the way we act because that's the new rapper that we have. &gt;&gt; When the real gift got put inside of our soul, &gt;&gt; cuz what do we live before that? We lived the gift that was given when we were born. &gt;&gt; Regular life and an old Adamic nature. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That we hated God. Oh, come on. &gt;&gt; If you don't love him, you hate him. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right, listen to this. Brother Brown will tell us in a minute. I if I get a chance to read it that the creed did wrap him back up. So, what are they doing now? Listen, they want Jesus, but they want him with their wrapping paper on him. Right. They want to be able to talk the way they want to, &gt;&gt; dress the way they want to, &gt;&gt; do what they want to put their own wrapping on Jesus Christ. But what does that do? That binds him &gt;&gt; from doing what he's doing in our life because we know we are now the wrapping paper of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; because he's inside of us &gt;&gt; and now you've become the wrapper. But remember, Brother Brown tells us right at the end of time that God's going to unveil his true bride. &gt;&gt; And what is unveil? When you go and open your gifts on Christmas or whenever it is today, you're going to unveil what's inside of that box. &gt;&gt; But you got to tear the wrapper off first. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? Our package today is the seals being broke &gt;&gt; to show who he is. Now I believe that brother Brandham, what do you do? He showed us where Christ was. He showed us where Christ was. Christ was in the people. Not just one person anymore. He was in a many membered body. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The man himself, the gift, &gt;&gt; not a second person. &gt;&gt; The gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And that gift has got to be what? Received. &gt;&gt; It's not a gift. If it's not received, you can lay a gift over here and it can be from me. If I don't pick it up, it'll just sit there the whole time. &gt;&gt; But we must receive the gift. But at Calvary, he was unveiled. &gt;&gt; At Calvary, the wrapper was torn off. &gt;&gt; Listen, folks. There's one thing for sure. He didn't have on a loin cloth when he was hanging on Calvary. &gt;&gt; He was naked. &gt;&gt; Cuz they shamed him to the greatest shame that they could be shamed, and that was being hung on a cross naked. He tried to tell them he was hanging there unveiled. And what's the first thing they did was they wrapped him in a cloth and put him in a tomb. Come on. That's why told brother Manueli preached my sermon part of it. Now when Joseph, this is Joseph of Arma, took the body, he wrapped it in a clean linen cloth. Now that word clean linen cloth is like he said that was a special silk cloth that had never been put on anything. &gt;&gt; Now when he was born the linen cloth that he was wrapped in smell like an ox &gt;&gt; sweat. But when they put him in here they put a clean linen cloth on him and laid it in his own new tomb which he had heuned in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the door of the septic and departed. They thought he was finished. &gt;&gt; They thought he was the package that was going to deliver them from the Romans. They thought he was the guy that was going to deliver them. He delivered them, but he delivered them the way he wanted to deliver them. &gt;&gt; And today, you will only get deliverance the way God wants you to get deliverance, not the way you want to get deliverance. &gt;&gt; Cuz that's the problem with the world now. They say, "Come as you are." Listen, I say today, come as you are. &gt;&gt; But don't stay as you are. &gt;&gt; You can't keep coming as you are. Every service, you got to change somewhere because what's going to happen is you're going to come in and you're going to get that gift. Somebody in the pull pit is going to unwrap him for you. &gt;&gt; All of us. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; All the ministry is that's what we're doing. We're unwrapping the gift that God give you. &gt;&gt; But you can receive it or not receive it. &gt;&gt; It's up to you. &gt;&gt; Or you can reject it completely &gt;&gt; and not ever want it. So listen, let's go on down. So it is today when this great gift of the church, the Holy Spirit falls upon the poor and humble, the rich don't want it. They don't want humble to humble themselves. They want it with class, but they don't want it the way God sends it. That's what I mean. Come as you are. Sit under the fountain enough. Let God work on you. &gt;&gt; You'll either come in or leave. &gt;&gt; But you're not going to stay the way you are. &gt;&gt; Listen, you've come up to something eternal. You've not come up to some department store where you go in and buy what you want. &gt;&gt; You're in the house of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's where God resides. &gt;&gt; That's right. Sir, &gt;&gt; at the moment, he's just packed himself in here for a little while. &gt;&gt; Then when we disperse, God's going to disperse with you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; We'll show you something in just a second, then we'll be done. They didn't want to humble themselves. They want it with class, but they don't want it the way God sends it. Many people want to receive the Holy Ghost, but they want to get it in the way they want it. Cuz what happened to the Pharisees? They wanted the deliverer. They were looking for a Messiah. They wanted him because they were under depression and and they were under suppression. They wanted their deliverer to deliver Israel. &gt;&gt; God sent him right there the way he was supposed to send him and they didn't want it &gt;&gt; cuz he would have tore up all of their creeds and all of their things that they did &gt;&gt; that were wrong. &gt;&gt; All right. But they want to get it the way they want it. But oh, I'm so glad that you can't do it that way. You have to do it the way God sends it to you. God sent the gift the way God wanted it sent. I don't think of any other way than God being a baby laying in a manger with poopy diapers. &gt;&gt; You say you're that's exactly WHAT HAPPENED. HE WAS SO MUCH HUMAN. &gt;&gt; And I and I'll promise you folks, let let me give you this warning. If you see those pictures that has this little glow around his head, even as a baby, see if he if he would have come that way and and sister Anna, if he would have stepped out and he's like kind of like your shirt. Come up here. Come here. That's flashy right there. Sorry though. God didn't come that way. You sit right there. God came with no clothes. He left the world with no clothes. He got came in the world with no clothes. &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WANTED THE FLASHY. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT TO TAKE it the way God sends it to you and humble ourselves to receive it. &gt;&gt; CUZ YOU KNOW WHAT GOD WOULD I mean the people if he would have walked into I couldn't even see this happening. He w he listen Jesus went to the temple. Hello somebody. I read you the scripture the other day. God went to church. every Sabbath, every time they had a feast day, he was in church. &gt;&gt; So God went to church. Okay, you ought to try that sometime. But if he would have walked in and they would have been this glow, [Music] you know, they would have said, "Oh, that's got to be God. Look at that thing around his head. &gt;&gt; Look at them eyes. You know, they got fire coming out of them." There will be But you won't want to see it. &gt;&gt; But he came so humble. &gt;&gt; They walked in. He walked in on that eighth day and to be circumcised. And they're like, "That ain't God. He He's coming to be circumcised. That can't be. That baby can't be God. But he came the way he WAS SUPPOSED TO COME. &gt;&gt; Have we missed him? THE WAY HE WAS SUPPOSED TO COME IN the end time. &gt;&gt; Let's fast forward a little bit. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown said, "No, it wasn't wrapped right. It wasn't wrapped the classical paper around it. It was a wrapped as a gift as a gift from God sent from God. A God that they didn't know nothing about. They claimed they did. They claimed they was looking for him, but he did not come in the way that they thought he was coming according to their creeds. and they could not receive God's gift. He was wrapped different. He was wrapped up like a baby. He was born in a manger. He came from poor people. He came from a bunch of fanatics. So, how could they receive something like that? No wonder there was no room for him in the end. There's no room for him yet in the church. They ousted him. Remember, I stand at the door and knock. Brother Ram said that was sad. had the saddest thing you'd ever seen in our church age was Christ standing at the door knocking cuz there's no door knob on the outside. The doororknob's on the inside. You got to let him in. &gt;&gt; They ousted him. They don't believe in it. They'll say away with such a thing. It's fanaticism. We want nothing to do with it. It's against our father's doctrine. Yeah. The doctrine of the church, the doctrine of our creeds of our forefathers. Therefore, Christ is just as rejected today as he was back then. There's no room tonight in our good churches. There's no room in our religious circles today for a Holy Ghost meeting. They don't want it. It belittles them in the sight of the classes of the country. It belittles them to think that they'd humble themselves, to come down to an altar to cry and tar there until they're filled with the power from on high. To rise up from there with newness of life, to let women let their hair grow out, act like women ought to act. to make men throw away their cigarettes and quit their drinking and treat their families right. It's too much for them. So, they hold on to the creed of their church instead of receiving God's gift, God's Christmas gift. They'd rather have a creed than they would the gift. They'd rather have the paper than the gift. They want the paper. Sure, something's all tensed. A lot of fuss they can do about it, but the real gift that's on the inside, they don't want it. He was wrapped in a dirty cloth, a swaddling cloth, and he's wrapped today in the same thing which they call holy roller, fanaticism, bunch of heretics. It's wrapped up in swaddling cloth, and the world don't want it. Oh, I'm so glad to raise that cloth off and look what's laying underneath it. Eternal life. God made flesh and dwelt among us. &gt;&gt; Now, I want to ask you a question. Get ready to close. I want to ask you a question. When they saw, and we'll read it here in a minute, when they saw, this just came to me the other day. I was studying a little bit. Now, we know one thing's for sure that that William Brham is not God. William Brandom is not Jesus. &gt;&gt; Close, but he was still born in sin. He still made mistakes. He lied. One more time. &gt;&gt; Okay, he lied &gt;&gt; cuz he was born one. &gt;&gt; You say, "Well, he had the Holy Ghost." Well, he still had a human. He still had some rapper left. &gt;&gt; His wrapping was what was causing him to do that. Our wrapping is what causes us to do the things we do. &gt;&gt; Okay. But we're going to have to do, as I've always said, let that gift that you got out, &gt;&gt; let it work out into your next realm and and uh suppress all these things that we're that we're worrying with or or or you know, worried about like brother Brandon was. But remember, he was not God. But now remember, he brought something to me and you in the end time greater than had ever been brought since Jesus Christ came. &gt;&gt; Is that okay? He brought us a way to get out of here in human flesh without death. &gt;&gt; That's what the me the message is not the signs and the wonders. I read you that and somebody else one of the brothers Wednesday night read it. It's not it's not when he started out. It's not in the healing campaign. Not in the prayer lines. That's good. That's wonderful. That's great. Listen, that's part of the gift. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what did the denominations do? As soon as Brother Ram left, they wrapped all of it back into their own rapper again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But there's a group of people that knows where God is. &gt;&gt; And know where God is and doing what he's doing through that gift through the wrapping paper that he was born with. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; We're talking about flesh. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now hang on a second. So now let's let's look at what happened right here. What happened on the day Jesus was born? On the day Jesus was born, number one, that star just didn't appear the day he was born. Everybody with me? the star, &gt;&gt; the star did not appear the day he was born because the magi had to come all the way from India or wherever they were from and they had to follow that star all the way and the Bible tells us by the time they got there he was a child not a baby. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; So it had to be a length a journey and remember that was a constellation of stars. Anybody else looking from another direction would see three. &gt;&gt; I say one more time. Anybody looking in another direction &gt;&gt; would see three. &gt;&gt; But what happened when this what happened when these do this? How many you see? &gt;&gt; You see one. &gt;&gt; They followed that one star because he was one God. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then what happened when he was born? The magi were still out there traveling, &gt;&gt; but there was a group of &gt;&gt; There's a group of shepherds &gt;&gt; that was out there with THEIR FLOCK, &gt;&gt; GETTING A sermon for the next Sunday. &gt;&gt; AND THEY DIDN'T JUST SEE ONE STAR. They saw angels, &gt;&gt; heavenly host, &gt;&gt; a constellation of angels &gt;&gt; singing and praising God. That's what the shepherd saw. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me &gt;&gt; now. Wasn't the great star. The great star still there. Are you with me? Just for a minute. Wake up. We'll go down there and unwrap some gifts and y'all be all happy and run around all over the place. eat cake and drink coffee and go back to sleep. &gt;&gt; But the magi was traveling to go see Jesus, right? &gt;&gt; They had a lineup of stars that they were following, but it was one big star. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; He is father, son, holy ghost. &gt;&gt; But he's one. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But when he was born, there was shepherds out in the field. Shepherds typing what? Ministers &gt;&gt; out in the field. and they look up and they see this heavenly host. It's not stars, it's it's angels, &gt;&gt; but you can call them stars cuz they are stars. I'll read you out here in a few minutes. Jesus called the messengers stars. &gt;&gt; Seven stars. &gt;&gt; So they saw stars, messengers bringing a message and they went to see the baby &gt;&gt; and rejoiced. Everybody with me &gt;&gt; now? Listen. What did that show them? That showed them where Jesus was. All right, everybody with me? That showed them where Jesus was at. Okay, three magi, they come later on. But look what happened when they looked outside. Now watch. There was an happening several years ago back in the 60s, 1963. I was thinking about this the other day. You know, there's one God, &gt;&gt; but there's many stars. &gt;&gt; Amen. There's constellation of stars. A constellation is a group of stars that show you something. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? &gt;&gt; All right. a group of stars showing you something, a shape, a form, bringing you a message. &gt;&gt; Because when we look up, we see um there's like seven or eight, there's like 88 of them, but there's seven major ones. Ursula Minor and you know, the Orion's belt and all the all the all the cancer and all that. That's all in the stars &gt;&gt; and it's been there forever. &gt;&gt; Doesn't change. But there was a special group that came to a prophet in 1963 of angels. And we know that according to Revelation 10:7, the mighty angel has to come back down here. &gt;&gt; They lost him in the church ages, Brother Bram said. In other words, they wrapped him back up in their creeds. But he's got to be unveiled. Just as when they put him in that tomb and they wrapped him up, &gt;&gt; they rolled the stone. Did that bother him at all? When he came up out of paradise, he picked that body up. He laid them clothes. He folded them up and laid them down. And he just swiped the tomb out like the the thing over there and walked out. &gt;&gt; All right. That was the God. &gt;&gt; Yes. That was the God that was supposed to been unveiled. &gt;&gt; It took a death, a burial, and a resurre I hope somebody gets this. A death, a burial, and a resurrection to show who he really was. &gt;&gt; He stood there and said, "Heaven and earth, EVERYTHING. I HAVE POWER OVER THIS WHOLE I GOT POWER OVER THIS GUY RIGHT HERE." &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. POWER OVER THIS GUY RIGHT HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAID that when he came out of THE TOMB, WELL, THAT SAME PERSON that was sitting in a tomb or come out of the tomb walking &gt;&gt; is inside of you today. &gt;&gt; And he's not like Lazarus as somebody was preaching the other day. Lazarus was resurrected and they had he had to have the grave clothes took off of him &gt;&gt; cuz he was still bound. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't walk out still bound, folks. No, he was alive and well. &gt;&gt; He was in his glorified body the way he should have been, the way you should have been had it not been a fall. &gt;&gt; Oh, come on, somebody. That's what we're heading toward. You will never take a body change unless you see that your glorified body &gt;&gt; is being changed by what's inside of you, &gt;&gt; BY THAT GIFT &gt;&gt; THAT'S INSIDE OF YOU. It's going to change your wrapping paper. Now, a few about three years ago, it will be now that at home at my home church, the Holy Spirit spoke to me and says, "Go to Tucson. There's something waiting." I stood on this platform and told every one of you, "Thus sayeth the Lord, something's fixing to happen. There's probably hundreds of people sitting here that know it. I just told you what I saw." The message is on tape. What time is it, sir? I saw a constellation of angels. Okay. &gt;&gt; Now, if the magi saw one, but you got all the all the other the way that the way it come was Jesus had to come first, right? Everybody with me real quick. &gt;&gt; Jesus came. He was the head priest, the head prophet, the head minister. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Everything comes from him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. But what did he do to show that he was on earth and that he would be IN A MANY MEMBERED BODY? HE HAD MANY SHEPHERDS &gt;&gt; LAYING OUT IN THE FIELD. &gt;&gt; HE HAD MANY ANGELS. A CONSTELLATION of angels CAME DOWN AND IDENTIFIED WHO IT was &gt;&gt; for you today in this city of David is born a SAVIOR WHICH IS CHRIST THE LORD. &gt;&gt; AIN'T THAT WHAT THE MESSENGERS DO TODAY? &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; WE POINT YOU TO CHRIST. WE DON'T POINT YOU TO SOMEBODY ELSE. YEAH. &gt;&gt; SO NOW WE SEE THAT IT DOESN'T JUST COME FROM ONE PERSON. IT'S A MANY MEMBERED BODY. It's a five-fold ministry. It's a ministry around the world that's trying to bring the people together. &gt;&gt; So brother Brown saw a constellation of angels like a pyramid. What I tell you a constellation did it showed you a shape &gt;&gt; to sometimes show you where you're going. I'm not saying that we've had a baby Jesus come back. Baby Jesus ain't baby Jesus no more. &gt;&gt; He's a full grown man. &gt;&gt; But I believe that full grown man called the son of man is the one that's got to be on this earth today. &gt;&gt; He's got to be here today &gt;&gt; to change us. &gt;&gt; He's got to be here. &gt;&gt; And what happened? He he saw a constellation of angels like a pyramid come down just north of Tucson up in this way north of Tucson and they spoke to me something and I didn't know what it was and one day there's a man sitting right present now two of them that was with me back there when that happened and they took the picture of it in the sky now we know it was that picture right there all right because it unveiled Christ to the world all right in the magazine I thought I had a copy but I do that's but that's what it is you see it here in Life magazine. This copy exactly the way the Holy Spirit said it would be. And there stood those seven angels just as natural as you see me standing here and told me to return to my home that the mysteries that the reformers down through the ages had failed to pick up the mysteries of the Bi Bible, which is the seven seals. Now, what does a seal do? We're going to go downstairs or you going to go. We're going to go and we're going to look at a bunch of sealed packages. and we're going to unseal them &gt;&gt; to see what's inside. &gt;&gt; If not, you don't get the gift. You don't get the benefit of the gift. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The se seven seals held would be revealed. I challenge anybody, get those seven seals and look them over and find a fault with them because it's given by inspiration of God. And if you don't believe that those stars are angels, read Revelations 1:20. The mystery of the seven stars, which thou sawest in my right hand, and the seven golden candlesticks. The seven stars are the angels of the seven churches. But now remember down through those church ages, they had scruples. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; They still believed in the trinity. They still believed. Let's stand. Musicians, come. They thought God was three, not one. &gt;&gt; Water baptism, name, father, son, holy ghost. Hell was eternal. Catholic says there's a place called purgatory. Before you get to that place, you see all these things that beliefs that are listen, they're still hanging here. They're still here with us today. Those same demons are here today. But what are they to the bride? They're to drive her back to her homeland. &gt;&gt; Because I want to ask you a question. Who released those 200,000,000 demons in the river Euphrates? Who who Satan doesn't have the keys to death and hell. Satan doesn't have the key to hell. Who has the key? Jesus Christ himself has the key. He released those demons. &gt;&gt; You say, "How in the world?" Listen, you tell me how brother Brian would tell us that he'd have one brother say something to another brother just to see how brother would react. &gt;&gt; That's a devil. &gt;&gt; Hello, somebody. You may not like it, but God released those 200,000,000 demons to drive us back to him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, he unsealed it, but he also unsealed himself to prove that we can defeat defeat all of those 200,000,000 demons. Even in our human flesh, &gt;&gt; we are undefeable, &gt;&gt; bride. It doesn't matter if we have to put you in a tomb. You are undefeable. &gt;&gt; THE WRAPPING MAY HAVE TO COME OFF. THE WRAPPING MAY HAVE TO GO BY the grave, but that gift that's inside never will go away. That gift that you got will bring you right back out of that grave. And then you can say, THEN YOU CAN SAY, "ALL POWER IN HEAVEN and earth has been given unto ME." HEY, WHEN THOSE PEOPLE COME OUT OF THAT other dimension, they come in here with their glorified bodies. How are they going to get harmed? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You could throw AN ATOMIC BOMB RIGHT THROUGH THEM AND IT WOULDN'T KILL THEM. &gt;&gt; SO, ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH HAS BEEN GIVEN UNTO US. WE HAVE GOT A PIECE OF IT right now. &gt;&gt; You got TO HAVE A PIECE OF IT to carry us to the promised land. &gt;&gt; So now IT'S NOT JUST ONE STAR. WE have seen a star in the east. Now I've seen stars. &gt;&gt; Constellation of angels that's driving us back to our homeland that's preaching in the pullpit that's singing the songs, playing the instruments. That's what it is. It's angels pushing us toward God. &gt;&gt; Everybody with me? God's perfect gift. &gt;&gt; What a gift. &gt;&gt; Let's sing a song. &gt;&gt; Oh, if that same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwell in you, dwell in you. If that same spirit that raised Jesus from the dead dwell in you, dwell in you. your mortal body by his spirit that dwelt in you. I mean your blood. &gt;&gt; Hand one to Danny. Hand one to Danny when you go by. Okay to help you. If the same spirit that raised you from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you. If the same that raised from your dead well in you, dwell in you. [Music] If we love your Lord, oh God, too high for me. And if the spirit dwells in you, it will wake up your blood. If that spirit in you, [Music] spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you. dwells in you. If the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead dwells in you, dwells in you. [Applause] Your body in this dwells in you. It will bring your your body in the spirit. [Music] Shine on me, Lord. Shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Oh Lord, shine on me. Oh, let the light from the lighthouse shine. Sing it to him again. Oh, shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Oh, shine on me. Oh, shine on me. So let the light from the lighthouse shine on me. Amen. The gift of eternal life. No one can give it but one man. But God came specially in this end time through a little prophet to bring us a word back to the perfection that it should have been. So I believe we have the right gift and I believe it's in the right wrapping paper now. So now it's time for us to unveil Jesus Christ. The mighty God unveiled before us the unveiling of God. Brother Ryan preached what? Unveiled to who? Unveiled to the word but unveiled through human beings. Only way it can be. God's not coming back to this earth until we come back in the millennium. Come on. He'll come back with us. So, it's got to happen in my life and your life. This is what's got to happen. We've got to become Mrs. Jesus Christ on earth. And I believe we are. I believe we are. God bless you all. We love you. Uh now, we're going to sing one more song and then uh just kind of don't rush through the back door because we've got uh something we want to give each person as they go down the down the stairs. So, just just keep singing. And as you're singing, Brother Joe, just let the the back row start and the rows go out or either the front row go out. Be with your family. Do not come individually if unless you're an individual. If you have a family, go out with your family. Okay? So, we can do this without confusion. So, let's start. I tell you what, let's start with the with the back row. And as you go out, we're going to sing. Hang on a minute before we do. Uh, we're going to sing a song and we'll just keep singing until everybody's out. Now, when you get out of this building, do not go drink coffee and and fellowship. Get in the car and head down. It's about 8 miles down to the to the uh venue and there we can fellowship for hours and it's a big old place for those of you haven't been.

And then, like I said before, we can fellowship for hours down there in a great big room where you don't have to be crowded like this one is. So, God bless you. Let's sing one more time. Brother Joe, sing a song. And I thank God for the lighthouse. I owe my life to him. Oh king Jesus is the life and from the rocks of sin. He has shown his light around me.
