[0:00] oh so today is april 1st
[0:07] yeah nobody yeah i had to keep an eye on
[0:10] timbo to make sure
[0:20] so let's go ahead and get started
[0:24] does anybody this wednesday is april 4th
[0:27] and uh it's the anniversary or something
[0:30] that happened in bible history
[0:32] does anybody remember what april 4th is
[0:34] the anniversary of
[0:36] oh yeah well one thing that's special to
[0:38] me is because it's my birthday
[0:54] and this this isn't really part of the
[0:56] lesson it's just something since we're
[0:57] around
[0:58] april 4. that's just completely not
[1:00] remember the date
[1:03] matthew 24.
[1:08] 4 24 24
[1:22] and jesus went out and departed from the
[1:24] temple and his disciples came to him for
[1:26] to show him the buildings of the temple
[1:27] and jesus said unto them
[1:29] see not all these things rarely i say to
[1:31] you they shall not be able to
[1:33] hear one stone upon another that shall
[1:34] not be thrown down
[1:37] let's stop there for a second and read
[1:38] what brother brown said about this
[1:43] and jesus went out this is in the sixth
[1:45] seal and jesus went out and departed
[1:47] from the temple and disciples came to
[1:48] him for to show him the building of the
[1:50] temple and he said unto them
[1:52] see not all these things verily i say
[1:53] unto you there shall not be one be left
[1:55] here one stone on another that shall not
[1:57] be thrown down
[1:58] and third verse says he said upon mount
[2:00] olives the disciples came to him
[2:02] privately saying
[2:03] tell us when these things shall be what
[2:05] shall be the sign of thy coming and of
[2:06] the end of the world
[2:08] now let's stop there these three verses
[2:12] it took place actually on tuesday
[2:14] afternoon
[2:15] april the 4th 830 and the first two
[2:19] verses took place on the afternoon of
[2:20] april 4th at 80 30
[2:23] and the third verse took place on
[2:25] tuesday evening of the same day
[2:28] and the third verse as he sat upon the
[2:29] mount of olives the disciples came unto
[2:31] him privately saying tell us when shall
[2:33] these things be and what shall be the
[2:34] sign of i feel you know the end of the
[2:36] world
[2:36] so this wednesday just think about that
[2:39] that i
[2:40] you know nobody could tell us these
[2:41] things but a profit
[2:43] that's why anybody that would come along
[2:45] behind and say they could correct
[2:46] brother brown there's no way
[2:48] for you to know all these secret things
[2:49] about a prophet they could tell us the
[2:51] exact time that
[2:53] jesus sat on the mount of olives and and
[2:56] spoke those words to his cycle
[2:59] on april 4th in the afternoon in the
[3:02] year 80 30.
[3:03] that was 1982 years ago
[3:07] so now let's turn and keep going through
[3:11] genesis let's go back to genesis chapter
[3:13] four
[3:15] and this time we uh we've been making
[3:18] our way in great detail
[3:19] through genesis chapter four we're going
[3:21] to look at verse 16.
[3:31] now you know the same god i could tell
[3:32] whether brown what uh
[3:36] happened 1982 years ago as the same god
[3:39] that told moses
[3:42] over 2500 years after it happened what
[3:45] happened in the garden of eden and all
[3:47] these things that we're reading about in
[3:48] genesis
[3:49] moses wrote moses lived you know two
[3:52] two thousand years later when he wrote
[3:55] this down
[3:56] and that's it's just to make all the all
[4:00] of these things are written down by the
[4:01] problems the problems of god there's
[4:03] nothing in the bible that um that we we
[4:06] have assurance that man didn't make up
[4:08] any of the words we're reading
[4:10] because everything fits together so
[4:11] perfectly and
[4:14] so let's read verse 16 and cain went out
[4:18] from the presence of the lord
[4:20] and dwelt in the land of not on the east
[4:22] of eden
[4:24] and so i have a long list of quotes to
[4:26] read through
[4:28] and the theme of this is that when cain
[4:30] went out from the presence of the lord
[4:32] he went out to find
[4:34] uh as we'll read through what brother
[4:35] has to say about it he found
[4:37] he went to find a church that would meet
[4:40] his that would satisfy his desires and
[4:42] he found a wife that would satisfy his
[4:44] desires
[4:46] and um the way that you find a church
[4:49] and the way that you find the wife
[4:50] are the are identical because most
[4:54] people look at the outside when they're
[4:55] finding church i i've talked to many
[4:57] people about why they chose their church
[4:58] and
[4:59] some people say that they they felt like
[5:01] the church that they go to is the right
[5:03] place because the people outside
[5:04] shook their hand or um there was a
[5:08] right amount of emotion and things uh
[5:10] and that's similar to the way people
[5:12] choose their spouse is because they they
[5:14] like the way they look or the way they
[5:16] uh
[5:17] you know they were familiar with the
[5:18] story brother and told about the little
[5:20] girl that liked
[5:21] her boyfriend's feet
[5:25] those are all not very good reasons to
[5:28] choose a church or choose
[5:31] so brother branham compared seth and
[5:34] cain seth stayed in the presence of god
[5:36] and got a wife and cain left the
[5:38] presence of god and got a wife
[5:40] and they both found a church and a wife
[5:43] based on their desires what they were
[5:45] what
[5:45] was inside of them the desire that was
[5:47] in them
[5:48] so um
[5:52] let's read abraham and his seed after
[5:53] him 1961.
[5:55] now sometime this week we're going to
[5:57] take the mark of the beast and the seal
[5:58] of god and watch how that started right
[6:00] and eden
[6:00] and come right out where cain went out
[6:02] from the presence of god to get his wife
[6:04] outside stayed in the presence of god
[6:05] and got his wife
[6:06] how the church's different way went out
[6:09] with their organizations to going out
[6:11] with their organizations or system and
[6:12] gotten themselves a church a bribe
[6:15] and when the real true church stayed
[6:16] with god perfectly
[6:18] in the mark of the beast and the seal of
[6:21] god 1961 he said
[6:23] say i got a note today said could you
[6:25] prove that the assemblies of god started
[6:27] in genesis
[6:28] not listen to this this is good because
[6:31] he's comparing
[6:32] he's using assemblies of god to compare
[6:33] the uh
[6:35] the true church the true bride and what
[6:36] their desires and assemblies of god
[6:38] whether they stayed with the word or not
[6:41] could you prove that the assemblies of
[6:42] god started in genesis
[6:44] i don't know about the organization but
[6:45] the spirit that's in the assemblies of
[6:47] god starting in genesis that's exactly
[6:49] right
[6:49] and all the other born-again churches
[6:51] started in genesis and all this supposed
[6:53] to be churches just nominal churches
[6:54] they started in genesis
[6:56] and they both was represented in the
[6:58] first two sons both cain and abel
[7:00] cain received the mark of the beast and
[7:01] was sent away we realized that the
[7:03] serpent which was the one who had
[7:04] deceived his mother was a beast and not
[7:05] a reptile
[7:06] he was the most soul of all the beasts
[7:08] of the field in genesis 14 or genesis 4
[7:10] 15 rather that god sent mark cain
[7:12] and as soon as cain was marked he went
[7:15] out of the presence of the lord as you
[7:17] get it last night now did you read it as
[7:18] soon as the mark came he went out of the
[7:20] presence of the lord
[7:21] and took him away from the land of non
[7:25] and uh that same message let's see
[7:28] keep going down and then questions and
[7:32] answers brother
[7:33] said he came to his wife and lived with
[7:34] her in the land of not outside because
[7:36] god had separated him from this
[7:39] fellowship with his own brother because
[7:40] of the death of abel
[7:42] and that's who he had his own sister and
[7:44] married her is the only way that i could
[7:45] myself and see how that
[7:47] he married and and we know that you know
[7:51] everybody uh the bible doesn't list
[7:54] all the women that were born so um this
[7:57] is a
[7:58] this is a huge question among uh i go to
[8:00] this this website where
[8:02] uh it's kind of bible scholars talk
[8:04] amongst themselves and
[8:05] you the thing is that we take for
[8:07] granted as misses believers that the
[8:09] brother brandon has taught us
[8:10] like this that kay mary and sister are
[8:13] it's amazing to me how the
[8:16] the worldly the outside
[8:19] that those christians can't really
[8:21] there's still a mystery even these
[8:23] little simple things that we
[8:24] take for granted about
[8:29] where cain got his wife from and so we
[8:32] know that
[8:34] cain married one of his sisters
[8:38] choosing a church and we might go home
[8:40] for several let's see okay this is
[8:42] looking at the unseen
[8:43] we might go on for several hours
[8:44] speaking of the modern day of how men
[8:46] and women today
[8:47] just completely look and they go down
[8:49] the street and they're going to choose a
[8:51] church that they might must go to
[8:53] and bring up their children in and
[8:55] they'll search around through the city
[8:57] not trying to find the most spiritual
[8:58] church
[8:59] but the biggest church that they can
[9:01] find the one that's got the greatest
[9:03] crowds
[9:04] and the best dressed and the celebrity
[9:06] of the city goes to this such church
[9:07] where it's called the better class
[9:09] as far as men know and then in that
[9:12] church they'll try to find a minister
[9:14] that's what they call
[9:15] not narrow-minded that have just about
[9:17] let them live any way they wish to and
[9:19] belong to that church
[9:21] but the spiritual man on the inside if
[9:23] you'll give him the right of way he
[9:24] might lead you to a little mission
[9:26] somewhere
[9:27] where there is not many people but there
[9:29] is the spirit of the living god for the
[9:31] outside man feast on psychology
[9:34] and intellectual but the inside man
[9:36] feeds on the word of god
[9:38] and think about this broader than just
[9:40] looking at a church because this is how
[9:42] you choose your spouse to
[9:43] your husband and your wife and if you
[9:47] look at the end of marriage and divorce
[9:49] when brother brown was talking about the
[9:50] end of the marriage and divorce
[9:51] he says now that you've accepted the
[9:53] grace of marriage and divorce
[9:54] make sure that you teach your children
[9:56] never do this
[9:58] this is i i i tell my kids that there's
[10:01] two two
[10:02] great lessons you you must learn the
[10:04] first
[10:05] is that you've got to receive the holy
[10:06] ghost and the second
[10:08] is pray pray before you uh
[10:12] pray about your wife and and your your
[10:16] spouse is the uh
[10:18] the second most important decision
[10:20] you'll ever make because
[10:22] the way whether you accept jesus or not
[10:25] the the first decision to receive the
[10:27] holy ghost
[10:28] determines your destination if you make
[10:30] the wrong decision
[10:32] your soul you stand a chance of being
[10:35] lost eternally
[10:36] the second most important decision can
[10:39] ruin your entire life
[10:41] and you know we've seen
[10:44] just looking around i believe god sets
[10:46] examples into your path
[10:48] of things to follow and things to be
[10:49] aware of
[10:51] like he set pharaoh and moses before the
[10:54] children of israel
[10:55] they could look at pharaoh and see an
[10:56] example of what not to do and look at
[10:58] moses and see an example of how to live
[10:59] their life
[11:01] and we we've all had examples set before
[11:03] us of
[11:04] if if you don't pray before you seek a
[11:07] wife or seek a church
[11:09] it can it can destroy your life and i'm
[11:11] gonna read a quote in a second about
[11:12] what happens if you don't
[11:14] choose the right church if you don't
[11:16] choose the right church
[11:18] it can it can destroy
[11:22] your uh your fellowship with god and
[11:25] let's keep reading
[11:29] questions and answers were on hebrew in
[11:31] 1957 but eden was like a country or what
[11:34] our state and then none was another
[11:35] state or
[11:36] county next to it
[11:39] now the only person that kane could have
[11:41] had or married would have to be
[11:42] his own sister he had to because there's
[11:45] only one male and female that they could
[11:46] have come from
[11:47] and he had to marry his own sister now
[11:50] that was legal in those days and isaac
[11:52] married his own first blood cousin
[11:54] rebecca
[11:55] ordained of god and just
[11:58] remember that as we go along isaac
[12:01] married his own
[12:02] first blood cousin rebecca ordained god
[12:04] and that's how you choose
[12:07] that's the type of how you choose your
[12:08] wife today you must
[12:11] be your wife
[12:14] has to be related to god through the
[12:17] blood
[12:17] it's the blood of god living in the life
[12:20] of god living in her
[12:21] or living in your husband or whoever you
[12:23] choose that's how we're related to one
[12:25] another it's got to be
[12:26] through the blood of christ covered
[12:28] under him
[12:30] the the isaac and rebecca were related
[12:32] by blood and that's how we've got to be
[12:34] related the same
[12:35] holy ghost that's in me has to be in my
[12:38] wife or whoever you choose
[12:40] that's how you know if you've got the
[12:41] right wife or not you know brother
[12:43] branham said
[12:44] if you don't have the right one here on
[12:46] the other side you'll have the right one
[12:48] the right one is filled with the holy
[12:50] ghost
[12:52] it's not um because they've got pretty
[12:54] feet because they've got
[12:56] uh a nice hairdo or
[13:00] um or or does everything
[13:04] that you think they should do but if
[13:06] they're pleasing is that if they're
[13:07] pleasing to god or
[13:08] feel the same life that was in christ
[13:13] the mark of the beast and the seal of
[13:14] god 1961 notice he went out from the
[13:17] presence of god on whose mark went to
[13:18] the land of nod and got him a wife
[13:20] the very type of the church goes out
[13:22] from god gets the wife of the world
[13:26] think about it parallels it's the wife
[13:28] of the world gets a church
[13:29] of the world it doesn't believe what uh
[13:31] the revealed word teaches the mark of
[13:34] the beast and the seal of god
[13:35] however we find that cain then went away
[13:37] from god and took himself a wife out of
[13:38] another group in the land of god
[13:40] that's exactly what the man does that
[13:42] will not come up and worship god as
[13:44] spirit and truth he goes off and gets
[13:45] him a church
[13:46] that will satisfy him
[13:50] the true easter seal and what did the
[13:52] organization do it left the true
[13:53] pentecostal belief when it organized and
[13:55] got a wife out of the organization
[13:57] that's exactly right now what now what
[13:59] he's done look how look how the
[14:01] pentecostal wife's been to do
[14:03] and what she's saying and what she's
[14:04] doing look look at her action
[14:06] and standing right back around and
[14:08] trying to cut down the very thing that
[14:09] she stood for at first
[14:11] she's trying to cut it down smother it
[14:13] out because it's against her creeds
[14:15] like it was there but she's forced again
[14:17] to make a decision
[14:18] she's got to make it she's got to make
[14:20] it god help me and my brother who will
[14:21] stand with me help the
[14:23] god help us to stand there gallantly no
[14:25] matter if it's martyr's blood stand
[14:27] there i must fight if i must reign and
[14:28] increase my courage or
[14:33] now let's go to questions and answers on
[14:35] genesis 1953
[14:41] and he's talking about abraham and isaac
[14:44] and rebecca and it was
[14:45] legal and lawful in those days even for
[14:47] abraham and even on down to isaac
[14:49] isaac married his own blood cousin when
[14:52] abraham married his own sister blood
[14:54] sister
[14:55] his fathers his different mothers but
[14:57] the same father
[14:58] and the german comes out of the male 6
[15:00] sarah which brought forth the wonderful
[15:01] isaac is that right there was a nobody
[15:02] on the earth then
[15:03] that that was all in tight showing that
[15:06] here it is brother isaac rebecca is the
[15:09] type of the church
[15:10] and isaac is the type of the bride
[15:12] christ is that right and they must be
[15:14] blood relation
[15:16] blood relation questions and answers
[15:19] 1964. remember eliezer representing now
[15:23] the message that went forth from abraham
[15:24] eliezer went forth to find a bride for
[15:26] isaac
[15:27] he found a beautiful rebecca in the cool
[15:29] the evening a little dark-skinned girl
[15:30] coming out with a water pot on
[15:33] and eleazar prayed said lord god give me
[15:35] a good journey now and success for my
[15:37] master abraham
[15:39] and he said go don't take him amongst
[15:40] the philistines don't take her
[15:43] get over here amongst his people showing
[15:45] that the bride of christ
[15:46] and christ is blood relation because
[15:49] rebecca and isaac were cousins
[15:52] the time of decision and this time came
[15:55] and
[15:55] abraham was determined that he did not
[15:57] want his son to marry an unbeliever
[15:59] that would be good decision for our
[16:01] christians today who are sons and
[16:02] daughters of abraham to make the same
[16:04] decision about their children
[16:06] now it didn't make any difference about
[16:08] how pretty those unbelieving girls were
[16:10] how nice the women they were but abraham
[16:12] did not want his son connected with that
[16:14] kind of stuff
[16:15] and so he had to make a time of decision
[16:18] on who he should marry
[16:20] the choosing of a bride 1965 now if the
[16:23] spiritual or the natural is the type of
[16:25] the spiritual then the choosing of a
[16:27] bride and the natural is a type of
[16:28] choosing a bride the bride and the
[16:29] spiritual
[16:31] now it's a serious thing when we go to
[16:32] choose a wife a man for the vows here is
[16:35] until death do we part
[16:38] that's how we should keep it and you
[16:40] take that vow before god that only death
[16:42] will separate you
[16:43] and i think we should a man in his right
[16:45] mind
[16:46] that's planning a future that he should
[16:48] choose that wife very careful
[16:51] be careful what you're doing and a woman
[16:53] choosing a husband or accepting the
[16:55] choice of a husband should be real
[16:56] careful what she's doing
[16:58] and especially in these days a man
[17:01] should think
[17:01] and pray before he chooses a wife
[17:05] the choosing of a bride i think today
[17:07] what's got so many divorce cases now
[17:09] that we lead the world of america
[17:11] and divorce cases we lead the rest of
[17:13] the world there's more divorces here
[17:15] than anywhere else this nation and
[17:16] supposed to be and thought of a
[17:18] christian nation would reproach our
[17:20] divorce court
[17:21] i think the reason of it is because that
[17:23] men have got away from god
[17:25] and women has got away from god and we
[17:27] find that if a man prayed and a woman
[17:29] prayed over the matter
[17:31] not just look at a pretty set of eyes or
[17:33] big strong shoulders or such as that
[17:35] or some other worldly affection but
[17:38] would look first to god and say god is
[17:40] this your plan
[17:43] that's what we want is god's plan we
[17:46] call it
[17:47] we we must it's so important to pray
[17:49] before you make these important
[17:50] decisions because
[17:52] i i can look back over all the examples
[17:54] that i've seen in my life of people that
[17:56] you
[17:56] that thought they were marrying a true
[17:58] believer that
[18:00] raised their hands in church and prayed
[18:02] and dressed right and did everything
[18:04] that seemed right
[18:05] but after five or ten years when
[18:09] the trials and troubles came something
[18:12] on the inside
[18:13] just wasn't holding and uh
[18:16] it's it's so important to pray hard
[18:18] before you make these decisions to make
[18:20] sure that you've got
[18:21] god's plan and you're not just looking
[18:22] at something pretty on the outside
[18:25] and this again this is two things not
[18:27] just talking about the bride but the
[18:29] church too
[18:30] what church you go to you know people
[18:32] will say they
[18:33] they uh they're looking for a church
[18:36] that'll give them revelation
[18:37] and then they'll they'll
[18:42] go after pretty on the outside instead
[18:46] of pretty on the inside a tourist that
[18:48] really will stand by what god believed
[18:49] but god
[18:50] was in god's word and the choosing of a
[18:53] bride in 1965 brother graham said a man
[18:56] should pray earnestly for he could ruin
[18:59] his entire life
[19:01] to remember the vows until death do we
[19:03] part and he could ruin his life by
[19:05] making the wrong choice
[19:07] but if he knows what he's making the
[19:09] wrong choice and is marrying a woman
[19:10] that isn't fit to be his wife
[19:12] and he does it anyhow but then it's his
[19:15] fault
[19:16] if the woman takes your husband and
[19:17] knows that he's not fit to be a husband
[19:19] to you
[19:20] then that's your own fault after you
[19:22] know what's right and wrong so you
[19:24] shouldn't do it until you thoroughly
[19:25] pray through it
[19:28] choosing the church and choosing your
[19:29] bride
[19:32] he said you know you must pray over the
[19:34] church that you are fellowshipping in
[19:36] remember churches carry a spirit now i
[19:39] don't want to be critical but i realize
[19:41] that i'm an old man and i got to leave
[19:42] here one of these days
[19:44] i got to answer at the day of judgment
[19:46] for what i say tonight or any other time
[19:49] and i therefore i got to be dead earnest
[19:50] and truly convicted
[19:52] but you go into a church and if you'll
[19:54] watch the behavior of that church you
[19:55] just watch the church for a while and
[19:57] you'll usually find that the church acts
[19:58] like the pastor
[20:00] sometimes i wonder if we just don't get
[20:01] one another spirit instead of the holy
[20:03] spirit you get to a place where pastor
[20:04] pastors will radical
[20:06] and carry on you'll find out the
[20:08] congregation is the same way i bring you
[20:10] to a church where i see the pastor stand
[20:12] drip their heads back and forth
[20:14] you watch the congregation they do the
[20:16] same thing
[20:17] you take a pasture just gulp down
[20:19] anything usually the church will do the
[20:20] same thing
[20:21] so if i was choosing a church i choose a
[20:24] genuine
[20:25] fundamental full gospel bible church i
[20:27] was choosing one to put my family on
[20:30] and the choice of the church you go to
[20:32] is so important and
[20:34] now brother brown's going to explain why
[20:36] because
[20:38] just like the choice of a wife can can
[20:42] destroy your life but the choice of a
[20:44] church can destroy your life
[20:46] also destroy your soul and destroy the
[20:49] way that you believe
[20:50] if you go to a church that doesn't
[20:51] believe god's word and all of it
[20:54] then it'll affect the way you believe
[20:56] the choosing of a bride he says
[21:01] phone call just came in come in a while
[21:04] ago this morning a member of my church
[21:06] was
[21:06] really a baptist woman out of louisville
[21:08] she died early this morning
[21:10] and my church at home a real group of
[21:12] consecrated me and assembled themselves
[21:14] together and looked down
[21:15] before the undertaker and bombed her
[21:17] stood over her prayed until life come
[21:18] back to her and she is living tonight
[21:21] the elders in my church while they've
[21:23] been taught to believe that all things
[21:24] are possible
[21:26] come to come to god sincerely
[21:29] so you must make the right choice
[21:33] now his point is he was talking about
[21:35] this member of his church that made the
[21:36] right choice
[21:37] to go to a church where the elders were
[21:39] taught that all things are possible
[21:42] when he died he was they prayed for him
[21:44] and his and life came back
[21:46] into him and it's more than that they
[21:48] brought her think about his soul not
[21:49] just that he was brought back from the
[21:50] dead
[21:51] but his soul uh when you go to a church
[21:54] that teaches right
[21:55] it's the salvation of your soul
[22:01] the choosing of a bride 1965 you have
[22:05] also a choice whether when you choose
[22:06] this church you can choose whether you
[22:08] in this church whether you will choose a
[22:10] church that will guide you to your
[22:11] eternal destination
[22:13] you can choose a church that has a
[22:14] certain creed that you might think that
[22:16] creed is just what you want
[22:18] or the other church has their creed and
[22:20] then there is the word of god you have
[22:21] choice of
[22:22] you have to make the choice there's an
[22:25] unwritten law among us
[22:26] of choosing so you can do just like king
[22:29] did you choose the word of god or you
[22:30] can choose your own creeds and the
[22:32] things that satisfy you
[22:34] things that satisfy you don't may not
[22:36] necessarily be pleasing to go up
[22:43] and uh we've got about five more minutes
[22:54] i i just have three more quotes to read
[22:56] and then won't be done but
[22:57] um brother branham talked about how
[23:03] when you think of you're part of the
[23:05] bride the bride is what god
[23:08] the bride manifests the nature of who
[23:11] god is
[23:12] who he is and that's how a man chooses a
[23:14] wife he's going to choose something that
[23:15] expresses what's inside of him
[23:17] what a wife displays on the outside is
[23:19] expression of what's inside a man
[23:22] i've seen many times in my life when uh
[23:25] well i'm not going to talk about that
[23:27] listen
[23:29] the choosing the bride in 1965 he said
[23:33] again the kind of woman that a man would
[23:34] choose will reflect his ambition and his
[23:37] character
[23:38] if a man chooses the wrong woman it
[23:40] reflects his character and what he ties
[23:42] himself to
[23:42] shows truly what's in him a woman
[23:45] reflects what's in the man when he
[23:46] chooses her for wife
[23:48] it shows what's down in it no matter
[23:50] what he says outside or watch what he
[23:52] married
[23:53] i go to a man's office and he says he's
[23:55] a christian penta's all around on the
[23:56] walls i don't believe you look at music
[23:58] going on i don't care what he says i
[23:59] don't believe his testimony
[24:01] because his spirit is feeding on them
[24:02] things of the world
[24:04] let's say if we would marry if he would
[24:05] marry a coarse girl or what if he would
[24:07] marry a sex queen or just a pretty
[24:08] modern
[24:09] modern raketa it reflects it shows what
[24:12] he has in his mind of what his future
[24:14] home is going to be
[24:15] because he took her to raise his
[24:17] children by
[24:19] that's something important to consider
[24:20] when you're choosing a spouse somebody
[24:22] that uh there's more to it than just um
[24:25] somebody that
[24:26] uh you know what i i mean
[24:31] when a man chooses a wife it could be
[24:34] the salvation of his children
[24:35] because she's the pastor of his little
[24:37] home and she's going to raise up
[24:41] his children the way that he they should
[24:43] go
[24:45] and whatever she is that's the way
[24:46] she'll raise those children
[24:48] so it reflects what's in the man a man
[24:50] that takes a woman like that shows just
[24:52] what he's thinking of the future
[24:54] could you imagine a christian doing a
[24:56] thing like that
[24:57] no sir i could not a true christian will
[25:00] not look for such beauty queens and
[25:01] chorus girls
[25:02] and sex queens he'll look for christian
[25:04] character
[25:06] choosing of a bride in 1965
[25:09] now you can't have all things there
[25:12] might be one girl that's real pretty
[25:14] and the other girl maybe she's in her
[25:16] stature looks better than this one
[25:18] and you might have to sacrifice one for
[25:20] the other but if she's not the stature
[25:22] of a lady of a woman
[25:24] she's i don't care whether she's pretty
[25:25] or not you better look at her character
[25:27] whether she's pretty or not
[25:29] or not pretty now for it is becoming if
[25:33] a christian would choose a wife
[25:34] if he ought to choose a genuine
[25:36] born-again woman regardless of what she
[25:38] looks like
[25:39] it's what she is what makes her and then
[25:42] again that reflects his own godly
[25:43] character and reflects what's in his
[25:45] mind and what's going to be in the
[25:46] future
[25:47] for his family will be raised by such a
[25:49] woman for the future plans for his home
[25:52] if he marries one of these little modern
[25:53] raquetta sex queens what could he expect
[25:56] what kind of a home could a man expect
[25:58] to have if he marries a girl they ain't
[26:00] got enough moral about her to stay home
[26:03] and take care of a house and wants to
[26:04] work out in somebody's office
[26:06] what kind of a housekeeper would she be
[26:09] you'll have
[26:10] babysitters and everything else
[26:14] be certain of god and then in his
[26:16] wedding instead of marrying among his
[26:18] own people he went over he's talking
[26:20] about
[26:21] jezebel and um i forgot what that dude
[26:25] was what was his name thank you
[26:29] and then in his wedding instead of
[26:30] marrying him on his own people he went
[26:32] over and married a sinner an idolated
[26:34] worship of idols
[26:35] he married jezebel and she was not a
[26:37] believer and no believer
[26:39] should ever marry an unbeliever under no
[26:41] circumstances
[26:43] should always marry believers but they
[26:46] haven't done this evil thing and no
[26:47] doubt but
[26:48] jezebel was a beautiful woman and he
[26:49] fell for what she looked like instead of
[26:51] what she was
[26:53] that so many people make that same
[26:55] mistake to this day
[26:56] and she had brought idolatry in the
[26:58] nation among the people
[26:59] and the people the priests their
[27:01] ministers had fell victim to this great
[27:03] popular demand
[27:06] i i heard this brother i think he's from
[27:08] trinidad one time saying
[27:09] i like this that if you if a holy ghost
[27:12] feel brother mary's
[27:13] or or sister marry somebody that's not
[27:15] feel the holy ghost
[27:17] if you feel the holy ghost your father
[27:19] is god fulfill the holy ghost and not
[27:21] feel the holy ghost
[27:22] then satan is still your father so if
[27:24] you marry somebody that's not filled the
[27:26] holy ghost your father-in-law
[27:28] is the devil and it will ruin your life
[27:34] it will make life very difficult for you
[27:37] uh
[27:38] so uh it's
[27:42] we should find that quote uh the an
[27:45] american divorce
[27:46] teach your children to never marry an
[27:48] unbeliever
[27:49] don't wait till they get old enough to
[27:51] make a wrong decision before you start
[27:53] teaching them
[27:54] no believer should ever marry an
[27:55] unbeliever under no circumstances
[27:58] this is always a married believer and
[27:59] it's not just this isn't just a rule
[28:01] that we should follow to
[28:03] that uh it's something god makes
[28:06] rules to help us along the line all of
[28:10] the laws and things in the bible are not
[28:12] just for fun
[28:13] they're actually to help us so
[28:16] am i in there
