[14:00] father you're leading Us by the Holy
[14:02] Spirit to these different places the
[14:04] higher higher Heights Lord and and a
[14:07] level that that man has not reached that

[14:13] word of God that we're standing here
[14:15] today Lord the last final voice to the
[14:18] final age they'll never hear your voice
[14:21] a gentile will never hear your voice
[14:23] again once we're out of here and father
[14:26] we pray that everyone under the sound of
[14:29] my voice
[14:31] Lord does a little bit of checking up
[14:34] just look down deep and don't look at
[14:36] your neighbor or your wife or your
[14:37] husband look deep down inside of ourself
[14:41] and see how we're doing do a little
[14:42] checkup every once in a while that's why
[14:44] we go to the doctor once a year
[14:46] sometimes is we get a little checkup to
[14:48] make sure everything's good and working
[14:50] right and all these different things and
[14:51] if not then we get a little adjustment
[14:53] Lord and I pray that you'll adjust us
[14:55] all father that we'll grow more in you
[14:57] that we'll be more content that we'll be
[15:00] more patient and Lord that we'll give
[15:03] you the praise and honor and Glory
[15:04] because we can't do it by oursel we got

[15:08] bless the ones that are sick Lord ones
[15:10] that are traveling bless them in Jesus
[15:12] name
[15:14] amen if you do a good job for others you
[15:17] heal yourself at the same
[15:20] time because a dose of joy is a
[15:23] spiritual
[15:24] cure it transcends all barriers on Amen
[15:29] if you do a good job for others you heal
[15:31] yourself at the same time because a dose
[15:34] of joy is a spiritual cure it transcends
[15:36] all barriers you know who said
[15:39] that Ed
[15:42] Sullivan everybody remember
[15:46] Ed he did have some words of
[15:49] wisdom but that's true Revelations 1:10
[15:52] I was in the spirit on the Lord's Day
[15:54] heard behind me a great voice of the
[15:55] trumpet saying I am
[15:57] Alpha and Omega the first and the last
[16:00] what thou seest write in a book and send
[16:02] it to the seven churches and I turned to
[16:05] see the voice that spake with me and
[16:06] being turned I saw seven golden
[16:08] candlesticks we'll get into those in a
[16:10] little bit under sanctification and in
[16:12] the midst of the seven candlesticks one
[16:14] liken to the son of man clothed with a
[16:15] garment down to the foot and G it by to
[16:17] paps with a golden girdle you may be
[16:19] seated and we'll turn to Revelations
[16:23] 3:7 we'll continue our thought from this
[16:25] morning to the angel of the church in
[16:27] Philadelphia write these things said he
[16:29] that is Holy he that is true now the who
[16:32] you talking about Jesus Christ but if
[16:34] you are a part of Jesus Christ listen
[16:37] when brother Brown says the the
[16:39] scriptures that speaks of the bridegroom
[16:40] also speaks of the Bride when are we
[16:42] going to put those two together when we
[16:44] going to put those together just like I
[16:45] said today Jesus said love your enemies
[16:48] pray for those that despise are we doing
[16:50] that if we're not doing that then we're
[16:52] not lost we just don't we just don't
[16:54] have a piece of the puzzle together
[16:56] yet don't get quiet there's something
[17:00] lacking in our life if we can't be more
[17:03] kind than we are right to our
[17:06] enemies people that hate you that's
[17:10] right it's time for us to either get
[17:12] together or or or we're never going to
[17:14] make it this is the age of Brotherly
[17:17] Love right this Philadelphia age is the
[17:20] age of Brotherly Love what's going to do
[17:21] that it's going to be a Sanctified life
[17:24] it's going to take your well now if
[17:26] Brother Don live a Sanctified life
[17:28] that'll help me it might but probably
[17:31] not it just might be easier to say he's
[17:34] my friend but why about loving somebody
[17:36] that just literally don't even like to
[17:38] be in a room with you I have a few
[17:39] million of them Revelations
[17:43] 3:7 don't everybody go out the door to
[17:45] the angel of the church in Philadelphia
[17:47] right these things sayi he that is Holy
[17:49] he that is true like he wasn't it wasn't
[17:51] a point when God wasn't true but as I
[17:54] said before it's a higher order of a
[17:57] Revelations 3:14 says a faithful and
[18:00] true witness not like it was a false
[18:02] witness it was true in other words it
[18:04] rign
[18:05] true it was all true and nothing else
[18:07] like I said before the tuning fork you
[18:09] know you hit that tuning fork if it says
[18:11] see that that's the standard well God is
[18:13] a standard he faithful and true witness
[18:16] you hit that Hey listen hit that thing
[18:18] every once in a while and see why it
[18:20] rings see if it rings back to you it's
[18:24] either an amen or an O me one of the
[18:27] two he that hath the Key of David and he
[18:31] that openeth and no man shutteth now
[18:32] look this is where we're we're looking
[18:34] at where we see the seals he open them
[18:37] no man shutteth and shutteth and no man
[18:40] openeth because like I said before it
[18:42] means something that when when you get
[18:44] sealed in with the Holy Ghost God's the
[18:46] one that seals you yes it's God himself
[18:50] no one else the pastor can't do it the
[18:52] preacher can't do it your neighbor can't
[18:54] do it your wife can't do it your husband
[18:55] can't do it God has to seal that Holy
[18:59] Ghost inside your soul Satan's not going
[19:02] to do it for sure he's going to actually
[19:03] do the dodging thing and he's going to
[19:05] try to get crawl under his leg and
[19:07] around the corner and try to get in
[19:08] before God does but he can't that's
[19:10] right so there you are you have a piece
[19:13] of God inside of you he opens you up
[19:15] puts itself inside and closes you right
[19:17] back up but while you're in there as
[19:20] we're going to talk in the New Birth
[19:22] when we look at the holy of holies it
[19:24] was a priest in God and that was
[19:27] it second Court you can Mill around and
[19:30] they make the shoe bread and they they
[19:31] make the 12 Loaves and the priest go in
[19:33] there and eat it and they light the
[19:35] candles and they do all these different
[19:36] things inside of that but when you into
[19:38] that holy of holies that priest had to
[19:40] walk right by them and he walked right
[19:42] into that holy of holies no one else but
[19:45] that one person so it's it's it is a
[19:47] personal experience between you and God
[19:49] it is not a collective
[19:51] experience amen
[19:55] amen I Know Thy Works behold I have set
[19:57] before thee in opened door and no man
[19:59] can shut it and I remember the open door
[20:01] was to the world to to missionary I'll
[20:03] read it in just a minute I skipped it
[20:05] this morning no man can shut it for thou
[20:08] Hast a little strength and H has kept my
[20:10] word see I have a little strength in
[20:12] this age we're supposed to have full
[20:15] strength we've called We're called for
[20:17] the
[20:18] fullness not part that's the fullness of
[20:21] the godhead B is in the bride you read
[20:22] that right there behind you on that on
[20:24] that wall that's been there
[20:27] forever the complete fullness of the
[20:30] godhead bodily dwells in his church or
[20:33] the bride I'm reading it off of the wall
[20:35] back there but it's on um Christ is a
[20:37] mystery of God revealed when we going to
[20:38] start realizing that that we
[20:42] are um I think the next ministers
[20:46] meeting they talk about is is the bride
[20:48] a part of The Headstone she is The
[20:50] Headstone the son of man is The
[20:53] Headstone well where is the son of man
[20:54] supposed to be revealed in a bride yes
[20:57] all right so she is collectively then
[21:00] now the fullness of the godhead bodily
[21:02] not in one person it was in Jesus Christ
[21:04] he he didn't he wasn't part of The
[21:06] Headstone he was The Headstone all right
[21:08] he and he's supposed to come back in the
[21:09] end time to what be in a bride a many
[21:12] membered body that's going to come
[21:13] together not
[21:15] all not all there's some not going to
[21:18] come to that
[21:23] fullness you got to decide whether you
[21:25] want to or not
[21:27] right cuz I promise you in this church
[21:30] you've heard it over the years and
[21:33] there's no excuse except your
[21:38] excuse
[21:40] okay I just I depend on that you know
[21:44] there's a bar set there's there's a bar
[21:46] set at different places like when Abby
[21:48] and different ones or where's Abby oh
[21:50] helping Josh when you're in school
[21:52] there's a bar set right you have to meet
[21:55] certain curriculum you have to meet a
[21:57] certain standard
[21:59] to get to another grade or you have to
[22:01] do that what is it a test and then you
[22:03] she took a SAT and you got different you
[22:05] got different things that you take to go
[22:07] to different places all right so that's
[22:09] the same way with the word of God
[22:10] there's a standard the first church age
[22:13] was required a certain amount of word
[22:15] right second was not required to First
[22:18] third was not required to Second fourth
[22:20] was not required to third but that first
[22:22] church age and the last Church age is
[22:24] supposed to be the bar setting up here
[22:27] all right and then and we get plus
[22:30] because there's no other Church aids to
[22:32] throw it back to we've got to come to
[22:34] the fullness and then we send it to the
[22:35] Jews so I mean we're a little more we're
[22:38] supposed to be a little more advanced
[22:40] what I mean than we than any other
[22:42] Church age when the seals open that did
[22:45] not open to nobody but Jesus himself
[22:48] while he was on the face of the Earth
[22:50] okay and then I believe it shut back up
[22:52] when he left cuz it didn't come back to
[22:55] the end time did it right they didn't
[22:57] even nobody proat at all much Paul never
[23:00] spoke of it he should have spoke of it I
[23:02] I know he preached them but he preached
[23:03] them in his way cuz when we get
[23:06] scriptures for the seals you go and you
[23:08] read what Paul wrote different things
[23:10] about The Headstone and all that he knew
[23:11] who it was but he said I look through a
[23:13] glass Darkly in other words I feel a
[23:15] pull I know it's pulling me toward that
[23:18] but I don't know how to get there I know
[23:21] it's pulling me but remember Paul says
[23:23] it's not my time the only thing he says
[23:26] the time of my departure is at hand
[23:28] right but he did not have the fullness
[23:31] he did not have the seals open in his
[23:33] ministry but we did see that with
[23:35] brother brandom the seals opened and
[23:38] then God allowed us to go into the mind
[23:40] of God and see understand not see with
[23:43] our eyes but understand that we're
[23:45] supposed to be different that's why I
[23:48] saying this morning we should be
[23:49] different to begin with people should
[23:51] know you're a Christian you should know
[23:53] that when the the um the black sisters
[23:56] there are standing outside with their
[23:58] dresses on their long hair you're
[24:01] different now they may not like it they
[24:03] may persecute you but they know you're
[24:05] different that's why we're supposed to
[24:08] be a separated group we're supposed to
[24:09] be
[24:11] different we're supposed to be different
[24:14] you know why Jesus was different they
[24:16] hated him the religious World hated
[24:19] Jesus Christ the other ones did not the
[24:21] Beggars didn't hate
[24:23] him Common People heard him
[24:25] gladly he was around all these 5,000 and
[24:28] 4,000 and 6,000 and 10,000 and all these
[24:32] people and they just loved him but when
[24:34] he walked in that Temple they hated him
[24:37] that's right and the Bible says they
[24:39] hated him without a cause there was no
[24:41] cause they should have hated that man he
[24:43] came exactly the way the scripture said
[24:45] he was supposed to come and they hated
[24:47] him anyway and that's what he going to
[24:48] say way with me and you we are coming
[24:50] the way the scripture told us that we
[24:52] were coming yes the bride in the end
[24:55] time is coming exactly the way the
[24:57] scripture say
[24:58] exactly the way Jesus said that this is
[25:01] what we're looking at right now when he
[25:03] preached the seals what he preached he
[25:04] preached about
[25:05] us beware false Christ there's going to
[25:09] come this there's going to come wars and
[25:11] rumors of wars there's going to be all
[25:12] these different things that know what he
[25:14] said he preached the seals in Matthew
[25:18] amen we just had a prophet to come and
[25:21] tear the seal back show us what was
[25:23] going on and then inside of you it
[25:25] sealed back
[25:27] up I love that because remember when
[25:29] it's sealed up it's you and God
[25:32] absolutely the problem is is we've had a
[25:34] lot of people in the end time and the
[25:36] message of the hour they let a third
[25:38] person in that
[25:40] room they didn't get all the way shut in
[25:44] they left the crack and that's where the
[25:45] where Satan remember brother R said
[25:47] Satan crawled under the gates of of Eve
[25:50] of Eden right he come in he come into to
[25:52] uh God's Eden and made it Satan's Eden
[25:56] well guess what we're s here in Satan's
[25:58] Eden and God's making an Eden again out
[26:02] of a group of people hid so much the
[26:04] world don't know anything about it the
[26:06] like I said the world thinks we're crazy
[26:08] they think we're a
[26:10] cult
[26:12] right brother Andre
[26:14] head this past
[26:16] weekend uh sister Regina I asked him to
[26:19] give about a that much of a testimony
[26:22] the you know read or digest version not
[26:24] the War and Peace
[26:25] version he met a man one time when he
[26:27] got out of the
[26:29] army marines sorry but thank you that
[26:32] was quick he got out of the
[26:37] Marines anyway okay okay okay brother
[26:40] Donnie okay all right don't pull out a
[26:42] sword
[26:44] um so when he got out of the
[26:47] Marines he wanted to be a ham radio
[26:50] operator you know what a ham you know
[26:52] what a ham radio is some of you don't
[26:54] you kids are like what in the world's
[26:55] that well anyway it's a private thing
[26:57] inside your home that you can talk to
[26:59] people before cell phones and all that
[27:02] okay this was back in the early '90s so
[27:05] anyway brother Andre found a place that
[27:08] was look it up
[27:11] Google ham radio they still got them now
[27:14] do you know that the US government uses
[27:16] that as a backup yes sir they use they
[27:20] don't use cell phones they use ham radio
[27:22] operators as a backup if you'll get in
[27:24] these ham radio clubs they got different
[27:27] um they got like a n that goes out and
[27:29] they can talk to each other and
[27:30] communicate if everything else has been
[27:31] shut down they can communicate dad used
[27:33] to have a two-way or CB Radio and all
[27:35] that different things but anyway so
[27:37] brother Andre is want to do that of
[27:40] course he's Andre head the center back
[27:41] then he what he said yeah he was Andre
[27:44] the center not Andre the Giant he never
[27:46] has been Andre the Giant Andre the
[27:47] center and he said he wanted to be a ham
[27:50] radio operator when a God who impressed
[27:52] him to do that it had to be God because
[27:54] you know who he sent it to there was a
[27:56] man and Alabama named Hugh
[28:03] beam some of you older ones know who
[28:05] Hugh beam was I now some of the younger
[28:07] ones probably never met him wonderful
[28:09] guy wonderful message believer big old
[28:11] tall guy you know about this tall and
[28:13] and I mean he was he was um
[28:16] imposing um and sister be I guess is
[28:19] still alive but he's passed on but
[28:20] anyway he was a ham radio operator so
[28:22] guess what class Andre got in Andre the
[28:25] center got in his class well he's
[28:27] teaching this class of ham radio well
[28:30] all of a sudden Andre is going to the
[28:32] class going to the class going to the
[28:33] class and all of a sudden Hub beam
[28:35] disappears from the from the
[28:39] school well where's where's Mr Beam
[28:42] where where's Mr Beam at well they had
[28:44] to let him
[28:45] go had to let him go said yeah we found
[28:48] out he was in a
[28:52] cult he was a message believer and he
[28:55] had talked to a few people about the
[28:57] message of hour he never say anything to
[28:59] Andre about it so what does Andre
[29:03] do he goes and finds Hub
[29:06] beam and finds him and he teaches him
[29:08] inside I believe it is right he he's
[29:10] watching in so he'll he'll know I'm if
[29:12] I'm telling the truth or not he can send
[29:13] me a message but I believe he went to
[29:15] Brother Hub beam's house to fin he
[29:18] wanted to be a ham radio operator he
[29:19] didn't care a thing about the message he
[29:20] said I didn't care about all that stuff
[29:21] I wanted to learn how to be a radio
[29:23] operator and brother Hugh was a good one
[29:26] so to see how God works he went there
[29:28] well he goes there and he goes in
[29:29] brother Hugh's house and he says well
[29:30] who's
[29:31] that well you know who he was pointing
[29:33] to the picture of brother random with
[29:35] the halo over his head well then he
[29:37] starts well to make a long story short
[29:38] you see where brother Andre is at now
[29:40] because of that because of brother huban
[29:43] being kicked out from being a
[29:46] cult it separated him to a place to
[29:49] where what the seed could find
[29:52] him the seed could find him and went to
[29:55] him and you see what happens now he's a
[29:57] pastor there at the church you see how
[29:58] the Providence of God so if you if
[30:02] you're called a cult and kicked out and
[30:04] fired look around something fixing to
[30:07] happen I don't care they can call me
[30:09] whatever they want
[30:11] to but they're not going to call you
[30:13] Christian because like brother Bob said
[30:15] CH the word Christian's been so eroded
[30:17] in the end time just to say you know
[30:20] Jesus you're a Christian don't matter
[30:23] what you wear no matter if you ever go
[30:24] to church or not no matter what anything
[30:27] you're just like the
[30:28] world well we need to be
[30:32] separated from the
[30:34] world all right let's continue on is
[30:36] everybody all right so the the church
[30:38] ages slow down brother Ain you supposed
[30:40] to say slow down a
[30:44] minute so we've got the church ages we
[30:46] were explaining this morning about the
[30:48] black was the with the darkness of Satan
[30:50] the doctrine that Satan had and then you
[30:52] see the light and then you see that
[30:55] we're heading toward now I want you to
[30:57] get ready cuz like next week or the week
[30:59] out well three weeks from now we'll be
[31:01] getting over into the age of the Holy
[31:04] Ghost remember there was a age of
[31:06] Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell at
[31:09] 830 on the 120 in the upper room that
[31:12] that was the beginning of Paul stepping
[31:15] into the ministry of the Gentiles
[31:18] everybody all right with that right and
[31:20] what's going to now remember this is
[31:22] Alpha if this is
[31:24] Alpha this is Omega they got got be the
[31:28] same right so this this started with a
[31:31] Pentecostal
[31:33] experience this has a Pentecostal
[31:35] experience in here that's going to carry
[31:37] us into the message of the hour and
[31:38] we'll talk about that a little bit later
[31:40] all right so is everybody good with
[31:42] that mirror image if it started with
[31:45] that it's got to end with that all right
[31:48] so now and remember that all of it has
[31:51] to do with a church a dominating female
[31:54] just remember brothers and sisters see
[31:56] we can be that a dominating
[32:01] female we're bride or we're supposed to
[32:04] be bride we don't want headship over our
[32:07] lord
[32:08] Jesus no we don't that's what we get in
[32:11] trouble with a lot of times we try to
[32:13] assert oursel over what what our head
[32:16] says and he'll put us back in line but
[32:19] there was a dominating female that he
[32:21] knew would be in those Church ages that
[32:24] would formulate doctrines that were not
[32:26] true and guess what
[32:30] I was thinking about this yesterday or
[32:31] day before yesterday you know brother
[32:33] rown said our age is the age of a woman
[32:35] right 13th 13 colonies and all
[32:39] Revelations 13 woman's one well remember
[32:42] it started way back over here that's
[32:45] right amen listen it's always been go
[32:48] look in them Dark Ages there were queens
[32:51] that started Wars there was queens that
[32:53] had affair with this one that started a
[32:55] war there was a queen queen queen queen
[32:57] woman woman woman woman woman woman all
[33:00] the way down
[33:01] through till the end time it's going to
[33:03] culminate between a true
[33:05] bride and a false bride it'll be the
[33:09] true and the false is the only two's
[33:10] going to be standing at the end time and
[33:12] one's going to Prevail over the other
[33:14] and we just sure know that God's bride
[33:16] is going to Prevail over everything that
[33:19] Satan throws at us all
[33:22] right so let's not be so dominating or
[33:27] Domina
[33:28] ing when the Lord tells us to do
[33:30] something we need to do
[33:33] it and do it with
[33:35] joy do it with peace in our heart to
[33:37] know that he does not make a mistake we
[33:39] do he doesn't all right and every move
[33:42] he makes whether we question it or not
[33:44] every move he makes is perfect
[33:46] absolutely he can't make a
[33:49] mistake listen I have to put my
[33:51] dependency on and when I put my
[33:53] dependency on that I really don't look
[33:56] at circumstances and you'll quit looking
[33:58] at circumstances if you'll do that now
[34:00] look that word if is a big word if
[34:03] you're a bride if you're a child of God
[34:05] now if you're not a child of
[34:08] God there you in a whole different ball
[34:10] game you're in a whole different world
[34:13] but if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[34:15] you know you're the bride you know God
[34:17] sealed you in and you have troubles
[34:19] trials and tribulations it is for your
[34:23] good it is not for your detriment it God
[34:27] has never never made anybody
[34:31] sad think about that a God didn't make
[34:34] you
[34:35] sad that's why I love brother random he
[34:37] said folks he said why would God send
[34:41] his bride through the
[34:43] tribulation why would you send your wife
[34:46] through tribulation no he's not he's
[34:49] going to bring the bride out the church
[34:51] is going to go through tribulation but
[34:52] the bride will not go through
[34:55] tribulation everybody with Meen
[34:58] so we look at the seals and we see that
[35:00] we're going to get into the seals a
[35:01] little bit more what we're going to do
[35:02] when we get to brother brandham when we
[35:04] get to the last message of the
[35:06] hour which was not all of brother
[35:08] Brown's message I like what somebody
[35:09] said who's Malachi for we're Malachi for
[35:13] we are Maliki
[35:14] 4 we are the he's going to send you
[35:19] Elijah the prophet so he sent the
[35:21] message to me I don't know about you but
[35:22] he sent it to me all right he sent that
[35:24] Elijah to me cuz when I hear that voice
[35:26] or heard that voice
[35:28] it was different right something
[35:30] different about it I and it was
[35:32] something that rign
[35:34] true so there's a a Ministry has been
[35:37] loosed all down from the first church
[35:39] age all the way down to us there's been
[35:41] Ministry loosed a true and a false
[35:44] always remember he said Beware of what
[35:47] false Christ amen that's right not false
[35:51] bums false Christ false somebody that
[35:55] knows a little bit right right cuz what
[35:59] is Christ an anointed one okay that's
[36:02] why you can have anointed ones you can
[36:04] have false
[36:06] Christ that's what the Bible says right
[36:09] all right so there's a Ministry loose
[36:11] that's why we are so like I said uh last
[36:14] week or week before or even Tennessee I
[36:16] can't remember they all run together we
[36:18] got to have a Doctrine you got to have a
[36:20] Doctrine in your church brother R said a
[36:22] do a church without a Doctrine is not a
[36:24] church so we have a doctrine of
[36:27] progressive revelation we have a
[36:29] doctrine that that we see that God is
[36:32] moving we we we we still preach on hair
[36:35] and dress we still preach on like I said
[36:37] this morning but we weave it into where
[36:39] tomorrow is something for you to chew on
[36:42] it's something for you to eat like Paul
[36:44] like um John ate the book right it's
[36:47] something to nourish you and help you
[36:49] grow in God not that God sent a prophet
[36:52] and that's about all we got
[36:59] but he said I will
[37:01] restore so he's restoring to its
[37:04] fullness right
[37:06] now right
[37:08] now it's not
[37:10] coming because remember Pentecost was
[37:14] the
[37:15] shook what is the
[37:17] shook all right if this is seed all
[37:20] right look if this is seed this is the
[37:22] TR this is what went into the ground
[37:24] this is what you planted all right you
[37:27] won't ever see this again until it goes
[37:29] to
[37:30] maturity this one died rotted but the
[37:32] life of it came up through here went all
[37:34] the way out and there was a there was a
[37:36] carrier or something to protect that
[37:40] seed right and that's called Pentecost
[37:43] that's why they had a Pentecostal
[37:44] blessing to begin with and that's why we
[37:46] got a Pentecostal blessing that we had
[37:48] to come through all of us yes I don't
[37:51] care if you were Baptist Methodist or or
[37:53] whatever you had a Pentecostal blessing
[37:57] all right but remember that Pentecostal
[37:59] blessing without putting that in your
[38:03] soul like brother Brown said you just
[38:05] tooted out the horn to that toot the
[38:07] whistle this is what we're looking for
[38:09] we're looking for what went in the
[38:11] ground so who went in the ground Jesus
[38:12] Christ this cap Jesus went in the ground
[38:15] Jesus resurrected he
[38:17] disappeared remember he disappeared
[38:19] because he went in the ground in the
[38:21] fourth Church age he disappeared but he
[38:23] come up his two shoots listen those two
[38:25] shoots was Jesus Christ right regardless
[38:28] of what you think the life that was in
[38:29] that seed was in those two little shoes
[38:32] then it was in that stock then it was in
[38:34] at one time it was in the the tassel or
[38:38] or the or the ear the corn you know you
[38:40] don't eat that you don't eat that thing
[38:41] around the corn you pull that off it's
[38:43] called shuck but what does That Shook do
[38:46] once you once you pull that Shu
[38:49] back and Sun hits
[38:52] that it dries it
[38:55] up and if it's not mature never come up
[38:58] but if it matures inside that you break
[39:01] it off you shook it and then you can eat
[39:02] it all right or you can dry it out and
[39:05] you can plant it again you can't this
[39:06] corn now cuz it's hybrid but you used to
[39:09] be able to you could plant corn and it
[39:11] would come back up but that's what Jesus
[39:13] said I will restore so he's not just
[39:15] restoring us back sure he's bringing us
[39:18] through
[39:19] justification he's bringing us through
[39:22] sanctification the stalk and the and the
[39:24] tassle coming out to the baptism of the
[39:26] Holy Ghost but remember
[39:27] it's got to go into the full grain in
[39:29] the end time that's what we're going to
[39:31] get into when we get into this last
[39:33] Church age it is going to be full seed
[39:37] grain he had listen he's done what he
[39:40] said he was going to do I will
[39:43] restore you and I are in that period of
[39:47] time right now right I'll restore all
[39:50] those
[39:51] years backward I'll ReStore in other
[39:54] words like I said one of the one of the
[39:56] um translations was I will I will get
[40:00] all that time and I'll bring it right
[40:02] back to me and you all that time that he
[40:04] left this happen and that happened and
[40:06] this happened and that happened he's
[40:08] bringing us to a time of full
[40:10] restoration and I believe we're in that
[40:11] full restoration time there will be
[40:14] nothing left but
[40:17] seed there'll be no shook left shook
[40:20] dries up blows away I watched them do U
[40:24] uh watched a YouTube video of of uh
[40:26] doing a wheat in the you remember the
[40:28] threshing floor Boaz and them had a
[40:30] threshing floor the the shuck still
[40:32] around that little bit of wheat you know
[40:34] wheat grows out like this there's
[40:36] hundreds of them on that he'd take that
[40:38] big old thing and he' stick his he stick
[40:40] it look like a broom almost or a
[40:41] pitchfork he stick in there he'd throw
[40:43] it up in the air well guess what all
[40:45] that red shuck would go floating through
[40:48] the wind and the seed would fall right
[40:49] back down where it's supposed to be
[40:52] that's what God was talking about taking
[40:53] you to the threshing floor getting rid
[40:55] of all that stuff that's around you
[40:59] that's holding you
[41:01] back it holds all of us
[41:05] back you ought to look that up sometime
[41:07] it's really interesting I mean you got
[41:09] all these things now where they can
[41:10] where they can uh you know Josh's got a
[41:13] a 3D printer where you make anything in
[41:15] the world still over in the foreign
[41:17] countries they stick the Pitchfork in
[41:19] they throw the stuff up in the air and
[41:20] there goes the there goes the shuck and
[41:22] the wheat falls down on the ground so
[41:25] you know why because God said that's
[41:26] what would happen
[41:28] he takes us to the threshing floor he
[41:31] divides us he lets the wind sometimes
[41:34] the Winds of War or the Winds of
[41:36] Doctrine blow all that out of the way
[41:39] and the true seed's going to hit the
[41:40] ground you and I are that true seed
[41:44] believe that please believe that there
[41:46] is no other I ain't saying Ain't No
[41:48] Other church I ain't saying no other
[41:50] Ministry I'm just saying this is it yes
[41:52] right there's no other message this
[41:55] message none
[41:59] but the first three ages they had the
[42:00] pure word fourth age went in the ground
[42:02] as we've just discussed and we know that
[42:04] I just explained every bit of that so we
[42:05] don't have to go through it but the
[42:06] fifth Age come out of there not looking
[42:09] like the seed but it was part of it the
[42:12] life that was in this seed came up to
[42:15] two shoes justification reform reforming
[42:19] back it did start restoration though
[42:22] y'all know that right it was not
[42:23] restoration but it started the
[42:26] restoration of the word back into Power
[42:28] cuz it had lost its power during that
[42:30] middle age but the fifth age got a
[42:33] little bit of light the sixth age a
[42:35] little bit of light a little bit more
[42:37] light but in our age remember it was
[42:42] completely
[42:43] dark but that little light brother
[42:45] Brandon put in there as I said this
[42:47] morning that's literally me and
[42:50] you the ones that take this message and
[42:53] carry it on to the coming of the Lord
[42:56] that's that white piece that's on that
[42:58] on that chart amen that's me and you
[43:01] somebody's going to carry it somebody's
[43:03] going to do it I just dumb enough to
[43:05] believe I can do
[43:07] it with God's help it's not me it's
[43:11] him but what do we got to do we got to
[43:13] yield let him throw us up in the air let
[43:16] him throw us up in the air and let the
[43:18] drunk fall
[43:20] out justification remember that
[43:23] eradicates by faith in what Christ did
[43:25] at the cross that was what was under
[43:27] Martin Luther his time of justification
[43:30] he believed that the blood of Jesus
[43:32] Christ had power see they didn't believe
[43:36] it in the Middle
[43:37] Ages no they believe the pope had the
[43:39] power they believe the Catholic church
[43:41] had the power they believe they uh
[43:44] Constantine and all the different ones
[43:45] they had the power but Luther says no
[43:48] the just shall live by faith the power
[43:50] of the blood of God is enough to cover
[43:52] me and take my sins away and God said
[43:56] that ain't nothing but the truth that's
[43:58] what I wanted you to say you just keep
[43:59] saying that until the next group comes
[44:01] up which is sanctification all the past
[44:04] sins are chopped off you're starting a
[44:06] new Journey you're starting a new way of
[44:09] life but you still got that old thing
[44:11] nagging on you right but we're coming to
[44:14] a place
[44:15] where it's going to be taken
[44:18] away the Bible tells us those who he's
[44:20] Justified he's what he's already
[44:22] glorified if he truly Justified you he
[44:25] will put you in a glorified
[44:28] body come on if he truly Justified you
[44:33] he justified you and you believe that
[44:36] you've been truly Justified like brother
[44:38] Brown said you'll know then the real you
[44:41] didn't do
[44:43] it we'll get to that when we get into
[44:45] the seals and all over in when brother
[44:47] Brown's uh message you'll see I hope you
[44:51] see that who he justified he already
[44:53] glorified
[44:57] through the Redemption that is in Christ
[44:59] to declare his righteousness for the
[45:01] remission of sins that are passed so
[45:03] justification one word picks up the jar
[45:05] all right I'm going to use
[45:07] that nothing else still dirty nothing
[45:10] else it's just changed
[45:12] position everybody with me it's just
[45:15] changed position I I didn't want to stay
[45:17] down here anymore so God said okay buddy
[45:20] I'm going to use you if you'll let
[45:23] me but it's dirty he can't start
[45:26] drinking it he wants to drink out of it
[45:28] that's what he picked it
[45:30] up he had a purpose for
[45:32] it and he was listen if God don't make a
[45:36] mistake he was just in picking it
[45:39] up everybody with
[45:43] me therefore we conclude that a man is
[45:45] justified by faith without the Deeds of
[45:48] the law so there was no law could put
[45:51] you right here in the Old Testament
[45:53] there was no law that could take you out
[45:55] of the muck you were in and start you on
[45:58] a journey to the New Birth not in the
[46:00] Old Testament got the blood of bulls and
[46:03] goats now it covered it it covered sin
[46:06] and then at Calvary it eradicated it but
[46:08] it didn't eradicate it at that time cuz
[46:10] it it had no life in it it
[46:13] had it had lamb life or or goat or heer
[46:17] it had that life that life can't come
[46:19] back in you and make you clean am it
[46:22] took somebody yes a man it took
[46:25] God amen they took the blood of God the
[46:29] life that was in the blood of God that
[46:31] we believe he was God he was not a
[46:34] second person and the life that was in
[46:37] that blood that he gave at Calvary that
[46:39] life came back into the believer the
[46:41] literal blood didn't come on but the
[46:44] life that was in that blood so you had
[46:46] to believe that's why cus could look at
[46:49] him and say well he said he could save
[46:51] many but he can't even save
[46:53] himself well he's going to say that in
[46:55] Hell one day and he's going to figure
[46:57] out if he had said something different
[46:58] he wouldn't be where he was
[47:00] at he said he could save others but he
[47:02] can't even save himself what a
[47:04] Blasphemous thing to say from the head
[47:07] of the religious order of the day
[47:11] right the head of the religious order of
[47:14] the day made that statement about
[47:18] Jesus so what's going to kill us what
[47:21] kills us
[47:23] religion religion is what kills us
[47:27] it
[47:30] is so justification we were looking at
[47:33] this
[47:34] morning inside of that box or that
[47:37] little shelter which is covered with we
[47:40] can get into that but we're not all kind
[47:42] of different colors Badger
[47:44] skin hid behind skin that's why God put
[47:47] Badger skin on that thing okay it's got
[47:51] cloth we may break it down later on if
[47:54] the Lord teares next year this is cloth
[47:57] but when you get over here it's Badger
[47:59] skin it's clothed it's got skin on it
[48:01] and they put layer on top of layer
[48:03] because when it rained they didn't want
[48:04] it to to get inside that thing they made
[48:07] it
[48:08] waterproof in their day we can't hardly
[48:11] do that in our day with all this
[48:13] technology we
[48:15] got but in that second Court you look
[48:17] you can't see anything you're out here
[48:20] you're out here in the world and then
[48:22] all of a sudden you come into this
[48:23] condition that you want to be saved you
[48:26] want to be baptized in the name of the
[48:29] Lord Jesus Christ all right you got to
[48:30] go through the labyr you got to go
[48:32] through the what sacrifice you got to
[48:34] make a
[48:34] sacrifice you come all the way to right
[48:37] here but now when you get right here a
[48:40] different a different part of
[48:43] you has to go inside
[48:46] there everybody with me sir because
[48:50] remember your soul in justification your
[48:53] Soul's not born
[48:54] again your soul is still black right all
[48:57] right so when you become Sanctified when
[49:00] you pull that
[49:01] apart I wish that would do with
[49:03] everybody brother I appreciate
[49:06] that that's what I've been needing
[49:08] somebody with some excitement about the
[49:10] word of
[49:11] God but but when you open I mean when
[49:14] the priest went in there not everybody
[49:16] could go even though you listen even
[49:18] though you made a sacrifice there's a
[49:20] lot of people throw the sacrifice on
[49:22] here had it had their sins covered for
[49:25] the Year this is back in an old
[49:26] Testament and they walk right back out
[49:28] guess what where they went back to the
[49:30] world and the things of the
[49:33] world right if you love the world and
[49:35] the things of the world the love of the
[49:37] father is not even in you but if you go
[49:39] keep walking and you consecrate yourself
[49:43] we're going to talk about this in just a
[49:46] minute why David could do what he did
[49:48] and not really break the
[49:50] law
[49:52] watch so you get right here there's a
[49:55] curtain so you don't know what goes on
[49:57] behind here and
[50:00] here this only does what's inside and I
[50:04] don't know what you're thinking right
[50:05] now praise God am yeah say Amen again
[50:09] there I don't I don't want to know what
[50:11] you're thinking right now but you should
[50:13] be thinking on the things of
[50:15] God but I don't know how your soul is I
[50:18] can't see your soul but I can see an
[50:19] outward expression of whatever that is
[50:22] right so we look in the outer Court
[50:25] that's the that's the
[50:27] justification you come in you get to go
[50:30] through that do like I said all the
[50:32] sacrifices the washing of the of the uh
[50:35] sprinkling of the water and the blood
[50:37] and all that and you're heading toward
[50:39] something but you can't see what it
[50:42] is you only heard a rumor what went on
[50:47] inside that's right
[50:49] amen a preacher may have told you how to
[50:52] get
[50:54] here but if he ain't been in here self
[50:57] and seen that
[50:59] room he can't explain it to you if he
[51:03] hadn't been here he can't explain any of
[51:06] this that's right that's why we believe
[51:09] in a pre progressive revelation we
[51:10] believe in moving through that's right
[51:13] that Temple because remember that Temple
[51:15] is now you that right there is a symbol
[51:19] of you but it's also a symbol of
[51:22] who huh what brother R say Moses God
[51:26] took Moses to heaven
[51:29] right and showed him Jesus Christ he
[51:32] came back and that's what he
[51:34] did cuz that's the only way he explain
[51:37] Jesus is a body a spirit and a
[51:41] soul but guess what praise God you and I
[51:44] can explain that and live it and this be
[51:47] the Temple of the Holy
[51:48] Ghost not just what not just a um you
[51:52] know that thing's
[51:54] gone that thing's gone I reading
[51:56] yesterday they think they found the
[51:59] ark well okay that's all right the real
[52:02] one and like Dad said they went to
[52:04] Jerusalem in 1995 and they said it was
[52:05] underneath the mosque of Omar it could
[52:07] be there that's okay with me but see to
[52:09] me and you that's that's not anything to
[52:11] us but it is to
[52:13] them listen if they can get that thing
[52:16] right there back together again they
[52:18] think God's coming they think their
[52:20] Messiah will show up he will come down
[52:22] in that cloud as a person
[52:28] and save Israel well guess what he's
[52:31] going to come down in a person to save
[52:33] Israel two of them Called Moses and
[52:36] Elijah and the message of the hour is
[52:38] going to them from us it's going to
[52:41] transfer there and they're going to go
[52:43] hey look you don't need this wall you
[52:47] don't need this you don't need that you
[52:50] don't need a a real Ark sitting
[52:53] here you are the ark
[52:57] the Ark of the Covenant you've been
[52:58] looking for listen the Ark of the
[53:00] Covenant you've been looking for for
[53:02] 2,000 years had been walking around in a
[53:04] gentile
[53:09] bride that's how important you are to
[53:13] God CU that's what them two witness are
[53:15] going to say they're going to say you
[53:16] don't need this Hallelujah let God come
[53:19] inside of
[53:19] [Music]
[53:21] you and they're going to
[53:23] go we wasted all these years trying to
[53:26] get the temple together and they're
[53:27] trying now they're trying everything in
[53:30] the world they say now they got like a
[53:32] thousand red heers cuz see you got to
[53:34] sacrifice them but they say they're here
[53:37] in America somewhere because of um
[53:41] artificial insemination all these
[53:42] different things they've broke it down
[53:44] where they've got a thousand of them
[53:45] stuck away somewhere that's okay with
[53:48] me we've already had our red heer we've
[53:52] already had our water of Separation if
[53:55] you're born again today you have been
[53:57] separated from the
[54:00] world you don't need the ashes of a heer
[54:03] Paul explains big time he explains if we
[54:06] need that we're in trouble that's right
[54:09] if the if remember if the ashes of
[54:10] sprinkling of the ashes of the heer made
[54:12] the worshipper clean then yes in other
[54:15] words at Paul's time I mean there he
[54:17] watched them go through the temple and
[54:19] he's like come on
[54:20] people God ain't there no more he left
[54:24] that place and an 70 when Titus came he
[54:28] of course now he didn't take that that
[54:29] was in the wilderness the one that they
[54:31] built Solomon's Temple they totally
[54:33] destroyed it t it to Pieces right tore
[54:35] it down Jesus said they would that's
[54:38] right he said there will not be one
[54:39] stone left on another They Carried the
[54:42] ark They Carried a manora They Carried
[54:43] all these different things and Rome's
[54:45] got it right now
[54:47] amen that's why the Jews will make a
[54:50] pack with
[54:53] Rome right
[54:57] that's why the pope will say I got your
[55:00] stuff you
[55:02] need if you'll sign this little contract
[55:04] right here I'll give you your stuff back
[55:07] but we see though that that's
[55:10] carnal that's
[55:11] carnal they don't need that you're going
[55:14] to see two witnesses show up over there
[55:16] that's going to say y'all didn't need to
[55:18] sign this
[55:20] contract Jesus has already
[55:23] come and that's why they're going to
[55:24] hate him and I believe the 144 4,000 are
[55:26] going to be killed by their own Brethren
[55:28] not by the United States or by Russia we
[55:31] don't
[55:32] care a Jew ha a Jew he'll kill
[55:36] him so anyway so now let's get started
[55:38] with the sanctification here real quick
[55:41] so the sixth Church age was love of the
[55:46] Brethren I know th Works behold I set
[55:49] before thee an Open Door no man can shut
[55:50] it thou Hast a little strength and kept
[55:53] my word and Hast not denied my name so
[55:56] little strength to me adds up to it is
[55:58] also then another unfulfilled age just
[56:02] like it was in Luther's time all right
[56:05] John Wesley was the church age
[56:07] messenger he once remarked that he did
[56:09] not fear that the name of Methodist
[56:11] would leave the Earth but that the
[56:13] spirit might take his flight and
[56:15] absolutely that has come
[56:17] true the Methodist Church you know
[56:20] they've they've split you got the United
[56:23] that lets gays and women and all the
[56:24] different ones then you got this other
[56:26] part that that that we're we're
[56:28] associated with some of them in our in
[56:30] our community and
[56:33] um sometimes they don't know what to do
[56:36] am they don't know what to do because
[56:39] because big church has pulled everything
[56:41] out they got to live on their own money
[56:43] some of them had to buy the churches
[56:45] they didn't know the Methodist Church
[56:46] owned it so they had to buy their own
[56:47] churches from the Methodist Church which
[56:50] makes them Rich guess what they're going
[56:51] to do they going to give it to
[56:53] Mama cuz they're just daughters but
[56:56] they're going to give it to Mama which
[56:58] is the pope or the Catholic Church
[56:59] whichever one you want to
[57:01] say now he that openeth and no man
[57:03] shutteth and shut and no man
[57:05] openeth in the Philadelphian Church age
[57:08] brother Brown said now the great
[57:09] missionary age brotherly love the age of
[57:12] missions how do you put those two
[57:14] together let me ask you a question how
[57:16] you put those two
[57:18] together it was the it was the agape
[57:23] love that those Messengers had
[57:26] for the people that didn't never heard
[57:28] had never heard of Jesus
[57:30] Christ that's why we in this church go
[57:35] to different places or send
[57:37] people it's not that we want to go and
[57:40] have our um I hope it's not that we that
[57:43] we want to go and have our passport
[57:45] stamped Jamaica
[57:48] Philippines
[57:50] Nicaragua
[57:52] Honduras I've been there I've been to
[57:55] Jamaica 11 times time I'd go back
[57:57] tomorrow but that don't mean nothing to
[57:59] me there they become my very very good
[58:01] friends but I went over there because I
[58:02] loved
[58:04] them went over there to help
[58:06] them did more good at the the second
[58:09] time we went to uh the Philippines
[58:12] instead of traveling all over the island
[58:14] and wearing yourself out preaching yeah
[58:15] I'm getting
[58:16] older we brought all the ministers
[58:19] together in one place and this church
[58:21] paid for the meal and paid for the day
[58:23] at the place and there was like 60
[58:25] ministers there
[58:26] and we talked about the seals we talked
[58:29] about all the different things the
[58:30] Daniel 70 weeks and they said they learn
[58:33] more because you know what if you can
[58:34] get a minister to understand what's
[58:36] going
[58:39] on he can go to his congregation and
[58:42] preach it for years or months I can go
[58:46] preach one time and they oh great
[58:48] Americans here yeah we had brother on
[58:51] and so what he preach I don't know but
[58:52] boy we had a good
[58:54] time right
[58:56] that's what happened there the
[58:57] missionary what did Paul do what was
[58:59] Paul's missionary what was his um I
[59:03] guess his
[59:05] Forte brother R told us he'd go to a
[59:08] place he'd stay there for two or three
[59:10] months he would establish people or me
[59:13] ministers in that part of the world or
[59:16] country and then he would leave so he
[59:19] got those people in the right on the
[59:21] right track and then they took it to the
[59:23] people cuz you know I mean you take go
[59:24] to places that didn't have a you don't
[59:26] have to interpret her in Jamaica well I
[59:28] probably did but uh in the Philippines
[59:30] the different ones and y'all went to
[59:31] Honduras and you have to wait for The
[59:33] Interpreter just like we're doing now
[59:35] which is
[59:37] fine but in in we were talking about it
[59:40] today
[59:41] in in languages there's different
[59:47] interpretations you know that there's
[59:49] different interpretations but when I'm
[59:51] an American and you're an
[59:53] American at least you might know what
[59:55] I'm saying
[59:57] I may be speaking a different language
[59:59] than y'all are but being a southerner
[1:00:03] but you know what I'm saying so the if
[1:00:04] the if the minister that speaks their
[1:00:06] language doesn't need an interpreter and
[1:00:08] he goes to his church and he preaches
[1:00:12] what God gives him to the people way
[1:00:15] more
[1:00:17] impact the Meagle in there somebody
[1:00:19] interpreting maybe don't get it wrong
[1:00:21] but may get a different interpretation
[1:00:23] out of it and then I'm gone are the
[1:00:26] ministers gone and they're all sitting
[1:00:28] there going what'd he say I don't
[1:00:31] understand what he's
[1:00:32] saying and without the Holy Ghost the
[1:00:34] person interpret it may tell them
[1:00:35] something different it's how a lot of
[1:00:37] doctrines get
[1:00:39] started so what did God do God sent
[1:00:41] missionaries to different parts of the
[1:00:43] world through John Wesley George
[1:00:44] Whitfield Charles fny Dwight Moody
[1:00:47] William KY David Livingston all the
[1:00:50] different ones in South
[1:00:52] Africa because
[1:00:54] why I got names of plenty of them here
[1:00:57] great men that lived in that brotherly
[1:01:02] love black man white man brown man
[1:01:04] yellow man all walls were broke down and
[1:01:07] these men went into the mission Fields
[1:01:09] Brotherly Love stretching out a hand to
[1:01:12] All Nations everywhere and it was open
[1:01:14] to them that they could
[1:01:17] go so God gives a time to where look now
[1:01:20] look before another Open Door age cuz
[1:01:23] they couldn't before that they couldn't
[1:01:25] have done it the papacy are the
[1:01:29] Rome had people so bound down till
[1:01:33] nobody was going to listen well are you
[1:01:34] Roman Catholic no I'm not well I'm not
[1:01:36] listening to you but God broke that door
[1:01:40] open and God went through that door with
[1:01:44] and in those
[1:01:47] missionaries they had it so closed up
[1:01:49] that they couldn't go in but in that age
[1:01:50] the doors were open cuz he said it was
[1:01:53] an Open Door age they opened up many
[1:01:55] doors during that age the door to the
[1:01:57] gospel the door to the mission field the
[1:01:59] door back to Christ and everything was
[1:02:01] opened up during that age and you can
[1:02:03] see what they did the Brethren done a
[1:02:05] great job out of it now remember we're
[1:02:08] talking about
[1:02:10] sanctification so what did they do if
[1:02:12] you come to that outer Court you had to
[1:02:14] enter into that next
[1:02:16] Veil right it had to
[1:02:19] open so you could step in it then it
[1:02:22] closed behind you all right
[1:02:30] we read that this morning Luther was the
[1:02:33] was the little grain of seed Luther
[1:02:35] stood out it was justification he was
[1:02:37] the very type of Hagar the stalk Wesley
[1:02:40] Sarah the Philadelphian age of love that
[1:02:42] brought forth the tassel then Wesley's
[1:02:44] age there was more missionaries than any
[1:02:45] other we've ever seen great missionary
[1:02:48] age of John Wesley but Pentecost
[1:02:49] represented Mary now we'll get to that
[1:02:51] later on like I said Mary the last stage
[1:02:53] of it now she was not the seed and and I
[1:02:55] want to ask these people these Seed
[1:02:58] doctrine people I want to ask them one
[1:02:59] question did Mary come with a seed in
[1:03:04] her she had to receive
[1:03:06] seed if you married today did your wife
[1:03:09] had kids she already had the seed in her
[1:03:12] she had to receive
[1:03:16] seed but look yet the life of the seed
[1:03:19] was in her but it hadn't matured
[1:03:22] yet oh I feel very religious it hadn't
[1:03:25] matured yet it was there but it wasn't
[1:03:28] matured in other words Jesus so it is
[1:03:31] with our Pentecostal age that we're
[1:03:33] living in now they probably didn't like
[1:03:34] him saying
[1:03:35] that what he's saying was is they hadn't
[1:03:37] matured what Pentecostal were what
[1:03:39] babbling babies cuz remember the the
[1:03:41] commission was to turn the hearts of the
[1:03:44] children back to the
[1:03:46] adults all right children to fathers is
[1:03:48] everybody with me babbling Pentecostal
[1:03:50] babies that thought this was it there's
[1:03:52] nothing else but this this is all we got
[1:03:54] to have and we're going inter WAP
[1:03:56] brother R said you don't ain't got
[1:03:58] started yet he said you latter rain
[1:04:00] people you had even had a former rain
[1:04:02] yet he was sewing to former rain
[1:04:06] himself you and I are the Harvest
[1:04:10] rain you and I I are if there's not a
[1:04:14] harvest it didn't get planted right CU
[1:04:18] if God plants a seed it always will come
[1:04:21] up always it will come up nothing will
[1:04:24] stop it that's right
[1:04:26] Satan can try to give you dry God will
[1:04:28] give you
[1:04:30] rain we may go through a dry time every
[1:04:33] once in a while but God's going to give
[1:04:34] you rain if you'll ask for it Pray For
[1:04:36] Rain let's pray for rain amen let's pray
[1:04:40] for the Harvest rain to get us out of
[1:04:42] here cuz I see mature seed coming up I
[1:04:44] see people coming back to the maturity
[1:04:46] they're supposed to
[1:04:48] be but now remember sanctification is a
[1:04:51] process justification but sanctification
[1:04:54] when you go inside there we'll explain
[1:04:56] it in just a second if you'll give me if
[1:04:57] you'll just give me a few more
[1:05:01] minutes become more holy Through
[1:05:04] Time listen I don't expect you young
[1:05:08] Christians to be fully
[1:05:10] matured my dad didn't either he nurtured
[1:05:14] everybody he could he'd nurture them he
[1:05:16] knew when they get born like sister
[1:05:17] Cindy different ones had so much wisdom
[1:05:20] not to run them
[1:05:22] off okay and I pray that that wisdom
[1:05:24] stays here
[1:05:26] we don't run them
[1:05:27] off that we know that we are kids and
[1:05:31] when we have kids we identify them as
[1:05:33] kids but we know that they're potential
[1:05:35] adults right the only person can stop
[1:05:38] you is what you you quit eating there's
[1:05:40] nothing nobody can do that's right you
[1:05:42] stop eating you become anorexic and you
[1:05:45] die yes let me just put it blunt that's
[1:05:48] right if you're if you even a
[1:05:50] Christian a come on now
[1:05:54] Brothers you you can you can come right
[1:05:56] down there that pyramid and you can have
[1:05:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost the true
[1:06:00] baptism of the Holy Ghost and you can
[1:06:01] still starve to
[1:06:04] death if you want to do that you
[1:06:07] remember the brother that that that
[1:06:08] brother Bri said he said I was't going
[1:06:10] to preach no more I'm going to drink my
[1:06:11] beer and that brother Ramsey I believe
[1:06:13] it
[1:06:14] was he quit he quit going up the statue
[1:06:17] of perfect
[1:06:18] man he quit he quit on God but God
[1:06:21] didn't quit on him he was a child of God
[1:06:24] brother R said God took his child home
[1:06:27] yes to not Mar his
[1:06:30] name what a great
[1:06:32] God you say well that looked bad no to
[1:06:35] me that was the greatest thing he could
[1:06:36] have ever done for that man took him on
[1:06:39] home before he done something really bad
[1:06:42] to anybody around him got drunk and
[1:06:43] killed somebody on the road or
[1:06:45] whatever but we become more holy through
[1:06:50] time that's why I said age listen human
[1:06:53] age doesn't mean anything to God
[1:06:57] you can be 90 years old and be a baby in
[1:07:00] God
[1:07:02] right but you can be 16 years old and
[1:07:07] got under the right Fountain got under
[1:07:08] the right Ministry and got under the
[1:07:10] right teaching and got yourself in the
[1:07:12] right place and you can be a mature
[1:07:14] person look at look at Paul and Timothy
[1:07:17] and different ones he he matured Timothy
[1:07:19] up to a place to where he depended on
[1:07:20] Timothy to do things right amen called
[1:07:24] him his son in the gospel
[1:07:27] well only a father can mature the son
[1:07:29] though he was maturing him up so like a
[1:07:31] child growing up into adulthood
[1:07:33] Christians become more Sanctified over
[1:07:35] time first Peter 2 we've read it many
[1:07:37] many many times this means that
[1:07:38] Christians should expect to make
[1:07:42] progress to grow that's why they called
[1:07:45] it Pilgrim's Progress I guess to grow
[1:07:48] and become more loving look more
[1:07:51] loving more kind more humble and
[1:07:57] self-controlled over their
[1:08:02] lifetime that Jesus said how you going
[1:08:04] to do this sanctify them through thy
[1:08:05] truth Thy word is
[1:08:10] truth now watch I didn't read this this
[1:08:12] morning so in questions and answers they
[1:08:14] asked brother brandom what's the
[1:08:15] difference in the Holy Ghost and and in
[1:08:18] U and being a um saved I guess it was so
[1:08:21] the Holy Spirit look you are believing
[1:08:24] unto eternal life life all right Shake
[1:08:26] Yourself just for a minute but when the
[1:08:29] Holy Ghost comes it is eternal
[1:08:33] life all right you reading it it is
[1:08:35] eternal life you're believing
[1:08:39] unto you're begotten of the spirit at
[1:08:43] sanctification
[1:08:45] begotten not born begotten of the spirit
[1:08:49] at
[1:08:50] sanctification come on see give me some
[1:08:53] more of that y'all got some more of them
[1:09:01] you know sometimes honestly we're we're
[1:09:03] human beings we've heard this for 50
[1:09:05] years and it just ain't it's just common
[1:09:08] but when you get somebody comes in that
[1:09:10] that really sees it am that's the
[1:09:12] reaction you get I'm not shaming anybody
[1:09:14] I'm just telling you sometimes we think
[1:09:16] oh it's just common we've heard this
[1:09:17] before how many times have we heard
[1:09:19] about justification how many times have
[1:09:20] we heard about sanctification well if
[1:09:22] you'll get it I'll quit preaching about
[1:09:24] it
[1:09:25] amen amen you know what brother R said
[1:09:28] he said you know Faith he said when they
[1:09:30] start having faith he said I'll quit
[1:09:31] preaching on faith you're begotten of
[1:09:34] the spirit at sanctification but never
[1:09:36] born of the spirit until the Holy Ghost
[1:09:38] comes in right sanctification is a
[1:09:41] wonderful place to be but it's also a
[1:09:42] hard place to be cuz Satan can still
[1:09:45] come back in with his with his spirits
[1:09:48] fill you back up with him again and make
[1:09:51] you
[1:09:52] religious make you believe the message
[1:09:54] cry when you sing cry when brother
[1:09:57] Brandon preaches cry when everybody
[1:09:59] preaches and cry here and cry there then
[1:10:02] you cry yourself right back out in the
[1:10:04] world that's correct a baby's got life
[1:10:07] you know what I thought about
[1:10:10] this now brother bradam is a master
[1:10:16] physician right remember he could tell
[1:10:19] people cancer is a bruised cell now who
[1:10:21] in the world Mayo never came up with
[1:10:23] that right brother brand knew all that
[1:10:26] why cuz he was a prophet amen watch what
[1:10:29] he says that's correct a baby's got life
[1:10:31] in the womb of the mother little muscles
[1:10:34] are quivering it's a
[1:10:39] life are you are you reading that it's a
[1:10:44] life but it's a different life when it
[1:10:47] breathes the breath of
[1:10:49] life into its nostrils it's a
[1:10:52] different wow
[1:10:56] right that's what it is my dear
[1:10:58] Methodist brother Pilgrim Holiness
[1:11:00] Nazarene the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:11:01] is different from
[1:11:03] sanctification sanctification is the
[1:11:05] cleansing which is preparation of
[1:11:09] life but when the Holy Ghost comes it is
[1:11:14] life preparation is cleaning the
[1:11:18] vessel
[1:11:19] right the Holy Ghost is filling the
[1:11:23] vessel sanctification mean clean and set
[1:11:26] aside for service the holy spirit is put
[1:11:28] it a holy spirit is put it in service
[1:11:31] you are the vessel that God's cleaned up
[1:11:35] amen how can I
[1:11:38] overcome and we'll notice when the
[1:11:40] unclean spirit is gone from a man he
[1:11:42] walks in dry places that's exactly what
[1:11:44] the church has done we read this this
[1:11:45] morning Baptist
[1:11:46] methodists those who believed in
[1:11:49] sanctification then Jesus said the
[1:11:51] unclean spirit that went out return back
[1:11:53] to this church body and finds the house
[1:11:55] garnished swept and clean living Pure
[1:11:58] Clean lives sounds good doesn't it all
[1:12:00] right but then if that house is a field
[1:12:02] or occupied then he comes in with seven
[1:12:04] other evil demons worse than he
[1:12:06] was the last stage of this place is
[1:12:09] seven times worse than it was in the
[1:12:11] first place they had been better off to
[1:12:13] stay lutherans than it would be to
[1:12:15] receive that light what the light of
[1:12:19] another and fail to follow it so will
[1:12:21] the Pentecostals see he's telling the
[1:12:23] Pentecostals he said you had light
[1:12:27] but you cabbage down on that life and
[1:12:28] don't know what cabbage down means that
[1:12:30] means they
[1:12:31] stopped they took root and said this is
[1:12:34] it but what it was brother brandom's
[1:12:36] message was woven in there he come out
[1:12:38] of that and they didn't come with him
[1:12:41] that's what he's saying right here so
[1:12:43] will the Pentecostal seat you know what
[1:12:45] I mean the house is garnished what
[1:12:47] happened then when the enemy went back
[1:12:48] out under
[1:12:50] sanctification that was washed out
[1:12:52] returned back and found the house not
[1:12:54] filled with the Holy Spirit now the
[1:12:56] state of the church is joined with the
[1:12:57] league of churches the World Council of
[1:13:00] churches what's he saying they had Truth
[1:13:02] Listen I'll promise
[1:13:05] you Martin Luther and John Wesley would
[1:13:08] not put up with what's going on in their
[1:13:10] churches
[1:13:11] today they would not go into the World
[1:13:13] Council of churches they're born again
[1:13:15] believers they would they they would say
[1:13:18] unclean and get away from it but you see
[1:13:21] now they're all moving into
[1:13:23] it because Luther's not there Wesley is
[1:13:25] not there and that Spirit of them too is
[1:13:28] gone all right look he said look that's
[1:13:31] when men that's where men takes
[1:13:35] it we talking this morning Christianity
[1:13:37] is not based on what people do to
[1:13:40] you it's not based on
[1:13:43] conditions well they that's the whole
[1:13:46] thing you talk to people and they go
[1:13:47] well they didn't it ain't about
[1:13:50] them it's about you right
[1:13:55] Jesus said you've heard that thou shalt
[1:13:56] love thy neighbor and hate thine enemy
[1:13:58] listen he was quoting the Old
[1:14:01] Testament that's right sir listen he
[1:14:04] can't unquote the
[1:14:06] word
[1:14:07] okay but him being the
[1:14:11] word he didn't change the Commandments
[1:14:14] he magnified
[1:14:15] them made them where you could live them
[1:14:18] so now if you love your neighbor and
[1:14:20] hate th enemy you got a problem because
[1:14:22] he's saying this but I say Toto you I'm
[1:14:24] going to come in into you and I'm going
[1:14:26] to start living that life back out
[1:14:28] right I couldn't do it in the Old
[1:14:31] Testament but I can in the New
[1:14:34] Testament love your enemies bless them
[1:14:36] that curse you do good to them that hate
[1:14:38] you and pray for them which despitefully
[1:14:39] use you do you include people that hate
[1:14:42] you in your daily prayers I didn't think
[1:14:47] so I do because the Lord convicted me on
[1:14:49] that not too long ago to pray for the
[1:14:52] people that hate you and say things
[1:14:54] about you and all those different things
[1:14:56] that's right hard to do though isn't
[1:14:58] it come on shake your head it's hard to
[1:15:01] do
[1:15:03] that but Jesus said to do it so when we
[1:15:06] going to start doing what God
[1:15:09] said that you may be the children of
[1:15:11] your father which is in heaven CU
[1:15:13] remember he looked at them and he said
[1:15:15] you got a different father than I do you
[1:15:17] hate me without a cause I love you I
[1:15:21] Agape you he didn't love him like a
[1:15:23] brother he loved them he was their God
[1:15:26] and he Agape loved him so much that he
[1:15:28] gave his life for him but they didn't
[1:15:30] agape love him back they didn't have
[1:15:32] anything they're to love
[1:15:35] with everybody with me love your enemies
[1:15:38] do good to them which hate you bless
[1:15:40] them that curse you pray for them which
[1:15:42] despitefully use
[1:15:45] you and as you would that men should do
[1:15:47] to you do also to them likewise remember
[1:15:49] that's a golden rule do unto others as
[1:15:50] you have them do unto you somebody said
[1:15:52] one time do unto others and run that's
[1:15:55] not the way to do
[1:15:56] it for if you love them which love you
[1:15:59] what thank have you for Sinners also
[1:16:01] love those that love them now if you'll
[1:16:02] look at the Bible that love translates
[1:16:05] the one up above translates to gape this
[1:16:07] right here because a sinner can't have a
[1:16:09] gape love that's right a sinner has
[1:16:12] filal love which is a conditional love
[1:16:16] agape love is unconditional love and if
[1:16:19] you do good do good to them which do
[1:16:21] good to you what thanks have you for
[1:16:22] Sinners also do the Same Love love your
[1:16:25] enemies do good lend hoping for nothing
[1:16:27] again and your reward shall be great you
[1:16:29] shall be the children of the highest for
[1:16:31] he is kind unto the
[1:16:33] unthankful and to the
[1:16:38] evil all
[1:16:40] right real quick now when Jesus not
[1:16:43] because you can be Orthodox because you
[1:16:45] can explain your religion
[1:16:48] hello that isn't really what he meant by
[1:16:50] a man must be born again it isn't so
[1:16:53] much intellectual but something has
[1:16:54] happened happened down
[1:16:56] here that's
[1:16:58] changed
[1:17:00] right down here that's changed that man
[1:17:03] it's changed his motive changed his
[1:17:05] ideas it's changed his
[1:17:09] life as I was speaking last night he's
[1:17:12] coming to the inner Court he's not
[1:17:14] talking about the New Birth he's talking
[1:17:15] about the inner court right which is
[1:17:17] called listen it's not the holy of
[1:17:20] holies is in the
[1:17:23] middle the holy place is where we're
[1:17:25] talking about now the inner court is the
[1:17:28] holy place all right not the holy of
[1:17:30] holies but it is a holy place out here
[1:17:33] and out here in the outer Court it
[1:17:34] didn't say nothing about holy Place
[1:17:36] anybody can walk back and forth but when
[1:17:38] you go through that other one and only
[1:17:39] certain priests can go in there and I'll
[1:17:42] read to you exactly how you can go in
[1:17:45] there and you got to interpolate that
[1:17:47] yourself for the time cuz that was the
[1:17:50] Old Testament okay meet him anywhere the
[1:17:53] veil is dropped around him he lives is
[1:17:55] daily for God meet him anywhere anytime
[1:17:58] he still got that testimony on his
[1:18:02] heart in any trial he still holds good
[1:18:06] it works friend I know it by
[1:18:12] experience everybody be brother Brown
[1:18:14] was a prophet right we we we're still in
[1:18:16] the right place okay people go to church
[1:18:18] shake your hand laugh and call your
[1:18:20] brother I read this this morning outside
[1:18:21] of the church they pull a business deal
[1:18:23] that wouldn't be just exactly straight
[1:18:25] for personal gain I wouldn't say them
[1:18:27] people are here in the Tabernacle but I
[1:18:29] say there is there's things that people
[1:18:30] would do and they get they got get
[1:18:32] different at least little things will
[1:18:34] bring at least little thing will bring
[1:18:36] that temper back selfishness open up an
[1:18:39] ear to hear gossip or do something to
[1:18:41] that type that person has never entered
[1:18:43] in to this pot in here all right we're
[1:18:46] going to read it in just a second well
[1:18:48] they're they're outside they're truly
[1:18:50] eating the same Mana they've been
[1:18:52] brought into the camp into the camp in
[1:18:54] the field is where the people got the
[1:18:56] Mana and they're in there and that Mana
[1:18:58] that they eat is the same Mana this man
[1:19:00] eats here they both have the same Pastor
[1:19:03] they both read the same Bible but one
[1:19:05] constantly stays true and humble and the
[1:19:08] other one's got his ups and downs going
[1:19:10] like this in and
[1:19:12] out both of them eating the same Mana
[1:19:16] but one of them has entered in the other
[1:19:18] one is still
[1:19:20] out both of them are believers unto
[1:19:23] eternal life
[1:19:25] that's why I said sanctification is a
[1:19:26] wonderful place to be you're heading
[1:19:29] toward eternal life you're this close
[1:19:32] you are actually one piece of cloth away
[1:19:35] from going into the holy of holies
[1:19:37] that's how close it is but if you don't
[1:19:39] enter in you don't get what's in that
[1:19:42] holy of
[1:19:44] holies one is baptized with the Holy
[1:19:47] Spirit into the kingdom of God both are
[1:19:48] believers un eternal life one is
[1:19:50] baptized with the Holy Ghost in the
[1:19:52] kingdom of God and the other one is
[1:19:53] outside Eden
[1:19:55] the same
[1:19:56] manner and the people said you got to
[1:19:58] shout to get in here you have to speak
[1:19:59] in tongues to get in here you have to do
[1:20:01] all these things but we find out that
[1:20:03] those things don't work he seen people
[1:20:05] shout I have no way of judging well he
[1:20:08] didn't I've seen people that shouted
[1:20:10] that lived any kind of Life we' seen
[1:20:12] people dance in the spirit there's
[1:20:14] something wrong yet they enjoy the
[1:20:16] blessings of God they believe in it they
[1:20:18] have faith in it but it's only in this
[1:20:20] outer court it's never come to the inner
[1:20:21] Court they've never got from here down
[1:20:24] to here I want you to see I don't know
[1:20:27] if you can see that or not it's a little
[1:20:29] bit blurry but this is another way to
[1:20:33] look at it all right Shake Yourself
[1:20:36] we'll be done in just a minute hot up
[1:20:38] here but remember this is the outer
[1:20:40] Court this is typing justification you
[1:20:43] got your Brazen altar you got your Laver
[1:20:46] you need to be baptized and get your
[1:20:48] sins forgiven you walk through now
[1:20:50] listen I want you to listen to something
[1:20:52] there's not three veils
[1:20:56] there's only
[1:20:58] two oh don't get quiet Paul Paul tells
[1:21:00] us in Romans that there's only two
[1:21:02] veils thank you I knew some of you knew
[1:21:05] what I was talking about it's not a veil
[1:21:07] it's just an entrance
[1:21:09] way it don't shut anything out you can
[1:21:11] go in dogs can run through here cats
[1:21:13] horses and anything can run through here
[1:21:15] but when you get to right here you see
[1:21:17] that you got to pull it apart now
[1:21:20] there's a
[1:21:22] candlesticks then you've got the table
[1:21:24] of shoes bread we'll talk about that in
[1:21:25] a minute and then there's a small little
[1:21:28] golden altar that only special incense
[1:21:31] are
[1:21:32] burned they're not burned on the outside
[1:21:34] they're burned on the inside and you can
[1:21:36] only smell it on the
[1:21:39] inside oh
[1:21:41] boy we'll get into something in a minute
[1:21:45] for there was a tabernacle made the
[1:21:47] first wherein was the Candlestick the
[1:21:50] table the shoe bread which is called The
[1:21:53] Sanctuary all right
[1:21:55] right now looked up the word shoe bread
[1:21:57] it means loaf but it's food composed of
[1:22:00] flour mixed with water and baked now
[1:22:04] remember the Israelites made it in the
[1:22:07] form of an oblong or round cake as thick
[1:22:10] as one's thumb and as large as a plate
[1:22:12] or platter hence it was not to be cut
[1:22:15] but broken
[1:22:18] amen my body which is broken for
[1:22:22] you often these loaves were con
[1:22:24] consecrated to the Lord at the Lord's
[1:22:26] table now watch Shake Yourself just a
[1:22:28] minute the inner coridor holy place I
[1:22:31] kind of compiled this from internet back
[1:22:33] there and it's a good explanation the
[1:22:36] Tabernacle was divided into two areas
[1:22:38] see they divided into two areas too not
[1:22:40] three now we know we're a three room
[1:22:42] house we know we're a three but this
[1:22:44] outside guy listen this guy doesn't do
[1:22:46] anything except what the inside guy
[1:22:48] tells it to
[1:22:50] do it just keeps your guts together
[1:22:53] interpret
[1:22:56] that it just keeps everything
[1:23:02] together and he built the inner court
[1:23:04] with three rows of huge stones and a row
[1:23:06] of Cedar beams first king 6 the
[1:23:08] Tabernacle was divided into two areas
[1:23:10] the inner court and the holy of holies
[1:23:12] they didn't even count the outer
[1:23:15] Court they were separated by a veil or a
[1:23:18] curtain all right the inner Court was
[1:23:21] surrounded by the outer Court like the
[1:23:25] picture and contained the golden altar
[1:23:28] of incense the table of shoe bread and
[1:23:31] the golden Candlestick all right note
[1:23:34] the curtain symbolized how the people
[1:23:36] were separated from God because of sin
[1:23:38] cuz remember you had to walk through
[1:23:39] that Veil and it come back shut again
[1:23:41] well whatever was going on outside
[1:23:43] stayed out there everybody with me all
[1:23:48] right the golden altar of
[1:23:50] incense was the second altar in the
[1:23:53] Tabernacle remember there's one out
[1:23:54] outside it was for the burning of God's
[1:23:57] special incense not to be burned outside
[1:24:00] and was positioned in the Holy place
[1:24:03] before the
[1:24:05] veil all right it was the last thing you
[1:24:08] saw before you walked into the holy of
[1:24:10] holies all right wake
[1:24:14] up it was symbolic of acceptable prayer
[1:24:17] though shall make an altar and it tell
[1:24:19] you but the table of shoe bread now
[1:24:21] watch this was a wooden table when you
[1:24:24] walk into that room there was a
[1:24:26] Candlestick over here shoe bread was on
[1:24:28] a table here and the altar of incense
[1:24:30] was right here right before you went
[1:24:31] into the to the last through the last
[1:24:33] Veil all right so remember we're talking
[1:24:35] about sanctification we're talking about
[1:24:37] getting clean but listen it is something
[1:24:40] you got to do cuz when you walk in
[1:24:43] there listen to me if you walk in there
[1:24:46] the candlesticks had to be lit by the
[1:24:50] priest kept lit oil kept being poured in
[1:24:54] man had to do it man had to make the
[1:24:57] shoe bread you have to listen to a
[1:25:00] fivefold Ministry through
[1:25:03] men to get to the holy of holies you got
[1:25:06] to go through that
[1:25:08] room and the altar of incense was what
[1:25:11] it was fired by a
[1:25:13] priest put the fire in
[1:25:15] it this was a wooden table located in
[1:25:18] the North side of the Tabernacle
[1:25:20] directly across from the golden
[1:25:21] candlesticks it held the bread of the
[1:25:23] presence presence which were 12 loaves
[1:25:27] of
[1:25:28] bread right right 12 loaves of
[1:25:32] bread for the priest and the tribe of
[1:25:36] Levi and symbolize the spiritual
[1:25:39] nourishment God offers his people but
[1:25:42] remember God didn't give it man made it
[1:25:47] when you go back in the holy of holies
[1:25:49] God made the Mana that's
[1:25:52] right God wrote the Ten Comm
[1:25:55] Commandments right God did those things
[1:25:58] and where did they meet God not where
[1:25:59] I'm talking about they met him back
[1:26:02] there you're heading toward it now
[1:26:05] listen you can get close like I said
[1:26:08] there's only one little
[1:26:10] skin between you and that but you can
[1:26:14] turn around and walk
[1:26:15] out various other ens utensils were kept
[1:26:18] the golden candle stat was placed on the
[1:26:20] south side of the Tabernacle in the Holy
[1:26:22] place
[1:26:24] 25 the candles was actually a lampstand
[1:26:27] we know that brother Ram told us and
[1:26:28] they do call it lamp lampstands in the
[1:26:30] Bible it had seven burning all lamps and
[1:26:33] lighted the holy place for the priest
[1:26:36] its chief purpose was to illumin
[1:26:39] illuminate or illumin all that was in
[1:26:41] the
[1:26:42] sanctuary all right so remember like
[1:26:44] brother Brown said you go outside it's
[1:26:47] hot it's hot it's cold it's raining it's
[1:26:50] good weather it's bad weather it's dark
[1:26:52] it's light when you walk into that
[1:26:54] second realm it stayed that same light
[1:26:57] that's the light they had to depend on
[1:27:00] WE the world Listen the world had to
[1:27:01] depend on seven Church ages being here
[1:27:05] right for us to fulfill and get this
[1:27:07] message to the Jews there had to be
[1:27:09] seven Church ages there had to be seven
[1:27:12] spirits of God and seven men with seven
[1:27:15] messenges Messengers messages to light
[1:27:18] the
[1:27:20] world but it was by man
[1:27:25] that's
[1:27:26] sanctification that's why you can be
[1:27:28] Sanctified without being filled with the
[1:27:29] Holy Ghost but you can have some of the
[1:27:31] same things the people with the Holy
[1:27:32] Ghost is
[1:27:33] God in a
[1:27:35] portion amen okay the light symbolized
[1:27:39] Jesus the light of the world now listen
[1:27:42] for there was a tabernacle made the
[1:27:43] first and wherein was the Candlestick
[1:27:45] and the table and the shoe bread which
[1:27:46] is called the
[1:27:49] sanctuary and I read this did it again
[1:27:51] now first Samuel now watch
[1:27:55] you remember the remember the scenario
[1:27:57] we were talking about where Jesus they
[1:27:59] were eating corn I believe on the
[1:28:00] Sabbath or something they were eating
[1:28:02] the um going by eating corn him and his
[1:28:07] disciples and the priest got all over
[1:28:09] him he said well hey David eat the shoe
[1:28:12] bread that was in the Tabernacle and
[1:28:14] nothing happened to him in other words
[1:28:16] he said but you're talking to the lord
[1:28:17] of the harit you're you're talking to
[1:28:19] the man that wrote
[1:28:21] that right but you know why David could
[1:28:23] do it listen listen David did not
[1:28:25] there's all there's always something to
[1:28:28] God that's different than than us our
[1:28:31] thinking my thinking was David was
[1:28:34] hungry he walks in there and blessed God
[1:28:37] there's the bread and I'm going to eat
[1:28:40] it I'm the
[1:28:44] king if David was typing Jesus Christ he
[1:28:49] had to do it by the word all right wake
[1:28:51] up
[1:28:54] and the priest answered David now watch
[1:28:56] listen to
[1:28:57] this there is no common bread under mine
[1:29:00] hand in other words we haven't have we
[1:29:02] don't have any bread made for you
[1:29:05] outside of
[1:29:07] this but there is hallowed bread shoe
[1:29:11] bread if the young men have kept thems
[1:29:14] at least from women now here is the law
[1:29:17] David went right by the law David
[1:29:19] answered the priest and said unto him of
[1:29:22] a truth women have been kept from us
[1:29:25] about these three
[1:29:27] days since I came out and the vessels of
[1:29:30] the young men are
[1:29:34] [Music]
[1:29:36] holy explains every bit of it David
[1:29:39] didn't just walk in and they were you
[1:29:41] know they' had a woman the day before
[1:29:42] and they weren't clean and they were all
[1:29:44] this no David said hey we haven't been
[1:29:47] around women for 3 Days that's what the
[1:29:49] law says the law says for us to be clean
[1:29:51] we're clean the vessels of the young men
[1:29:54] Men Are Holy and the bread is in a
[1:29:56] manner common in other words it's on
[1:29:58] it's on the
[1:29:59] table yay though it were Sanctified this
[1:30:02] day in the vessel so the priest gave him
[1:30:05] hallowed
[1:30:06] bread for there was no bread there but
[1:30:09] the shoe bread that was taken from
[1:30:10] before the Lord to put hot bread in the
[1:30:12] day when it was taken away what you
[1:30:15] saying brother Wade if we'll go by what
[1:30:18] the Bible
[1:30:20] says listen to me if we go by what the
[1:30:23] Bible says we can approach just about
[1:30:25] any way the Bible tells us
[1:30:30] to the problem is we get it all twisted
[1:30:33] around and bless God I'm
[1:30:35] David H bless God I'm bride I can go do
[1:30:38] what I want
[1:30:39] to no David knew the law and he went by
[1:30:45] the law he knew he was Sanctified he
[1:30:48] knew he could partake of it and that's
[1:30:50] what Jesus was telling him he said well
[1:30:52] David did the same thing
[1:30:56] amen 1 Chronicles
[1:31:01] 9 when was this bread
[1:31:06] prepared on the Sabbath and other of
[1:31:10] their Brethren are the sons of the kites
[1:31:12] were over the shoe bread to prepare it
[1:31:15] every Sabbath so every Sabbath there was
[1:31:18] new bread made that's right am I getting
[1:31:21] somewhere with
[1:31:22] somebody every Sunday there's a new
[1:31:25] message am that that you sustain
[1:31:28] yourself with this one and then you
[1:31:30] seven days later you get another one you
[1:31:32] get another what substance to eat
[1:31:35] with 2 Chronicles
[1:31:37] 13 and they burn into the Lord every
[1:31:40] morning and every evening burnt
[1:31:41] sacrifices and sweet incense the shoe
[1:31:43] bread also set they in order upon the
[1:31:46] pure table and the candlesticks of gold
[1:31:48] with the lamps thereof to burn every
[1:31:52] evening the shall be lying about the
[1:31:56] evening time the path to Glory you will
[1:32:00] surely find and the water way the LIE
[1:32:05] today for we keep the charge of the Lord
[1:32:09] Our God they did now listen God honored
[1:32:13] the law when the law was in
[1:32:16] effect God honored the law that's what
[1:32:18] he said if you'll do this this is what
[1:32:19] will happen right they got in trouble
[1:32:21] when they didn't do what they said
[1:32:25] what's any different
[1:32:27] now there's just Grace but listen to
[1:32:30] this and then we'll close Hebrews 9:1
[1:32:32] then barely the first Covenant had also
[1:32:35] ordinances of divine service and a
[1:32:37] worldly Sanctuary I showed it to you
[1:32:40] that was a worldly Sanctuary that was
[1:32:41] something made that people could see in
[1:32:43] the middle of the camp that where God
[1:32:45] met the priest and they got their sins
[1:32:47] forgiven once every
[1:32:50] year for there was a tabernacle made the
[1:32:52] first wherein was was the Candlestick
[1:32:54] the table and the shoe bread which is
[1:32:56] called the sanctuary and after the
[1:32:58] second Veil see what I'm talking about
[1:33:00] and after the second Veil The Tabernacle
[1:33:03] which is called the holiest of all which
[1:33:05] had the golden sensor Ark of the
[1:33:07] Covenant overlaid roundabout with gold
[1:33:09] wherein was the gold pot that had mana
[1:33:11] and Aaron's Rod that budded and the
[1:33:13] tables of the Covenant that's what we're
[1:33:17] getting to next we're going to get into
[1:33:18] the Pentecostal blessing the holy of
[1:33:20] holies amen right listen let's stand our
[1:33:25] feet those Pentecostals got the Holy
[1:33:28] Ghost they got cleaned out they had the
[1:33:32] gifts they got the new birth for their
[1:33:35] time but remember a group got in there
[1:33:38] and said this is it we don't need no
[1:33:41] more whenever we get to a place to where
[1:33:44] we say this is it we need no more we're
[1:33:46] in
[1:33:47] trouble hello somebody we're in trouble
[1:33:51] us forign no more this is it we we don't
[1:33:53] need nothing else we need everything we
[1:33:56] need Fellowship I love fellowshiping
[1:33:58] with these brothers you can talk to the
[1:34:00] brothers and if they got the new birth
[1:34:02] and you got the new birth it ought to be
[1:34:04] I mean it ought to be a a a a a Feeding
[1:34:07] Frenzy amen a feeding frzy what the
[1:34:10] problem is sometimes you get vultures in
[1:34:12] with the
[1:34:14] Eagles well anyway praise the
[1:34:18] Lord but why can't we fellowship with
[1:34:21] each other

[1:34:27] and and that's been my
[1:34:30] purpose and becoming a pastor here I
[1:34:32] want us to be to where we can fellowship
[1:34:35] with
[1:34:38] anybody I ain't worried about I ain't

[1:34:57] Doctrine he said love your
[1:35:01] enemies if you try to love people just
