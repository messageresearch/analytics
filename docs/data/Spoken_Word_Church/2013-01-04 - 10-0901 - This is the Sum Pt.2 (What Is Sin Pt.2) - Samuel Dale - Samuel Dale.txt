about it and then remember then the 18th which is the next Saturday that that will be the fellowship meeting at brother long Gores man any other announcements I generally forget okay Hebrews 8 Ecclesiastes 12 father we thank you for your love and your grace we thank you for the day and the time that we have thank you for loving us because without you loving us there wouldn't be any any hopes or anything thank you for your understanding and your guidance thank you for the revealed word cuz father only in that can we have anything we ask you now that you would come as we speak about you that you would come among the people and you would heal us because you promised it and we believe it you said that you sent your word and healed us and father we believe that truly in this day and hour that we're living upon the Earth that you have truly sent your word and you are sending it now so we believe you and we ask you to just fulfill what you said you'd do and Lord we commit it all into your hands remember the sick ones Among Us and father just have your way with each and every one forgive our sins and guide us and keep us in Jesus name amen and amen now remember we'll get to it in a minute to say that but I want to make sure to cover this each time Paul after summing up seven chapters finishing the seventh chapter speaking of the great mdic you know and bringing out the things that was never understood by mankind you know even till uh you know probably a lot of the disciples brother brandom said that Paul understood Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new now what do the others understand Jehovah the old was Jesus of the new but they didn't understand it in the language or the depth or height or understanding that Paul had all right now but after he gets through with seven chapters verse one says now of the things which we have spoken listen this is the S now here is the Su cuz that's what we're talking about this is the son what is the son we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens all right so now he says after he got through what he was to saying there here's the some of it other words what all he's brought to a p to pass Ecclesiastes 12 is after he gets through with the great Ecclesiastes the preacher you know after he gets through preaching his sermon and bringing everything down he gets down to uh verse 13 of the 12th chapter and he says let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter in other words what I've said to you throughout all of this Ecclesiastes now here is the conclusion what is it fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now I don't generally do this but it was asked about it so I won't put the names or anything to it but when the person receives the tape they'll understand it Wade done a marvelous job covering the other day about uh there in Genesis where that it was talking about uh you know and let God said let there be light all right and uh then you go on over later you know and you got even the dividing of day and night there that part and then you go on over and the Sun and the Moon is created all right and see that seems to be something uh contrary but as Wade was bringing out and we'll get the other but even um Einstein when they were asking the question or teaching that in school he proved to them that actually darkness is not a creation right it's an absence of light amen that's right all right now darkness is not a creation right it's an absence of light so you can take a room that is so dark you cannot make that room dark enough to put out one small minute candle that's right right amen see darkness is not a creation then it's an absence that's of light all right but see you could take one little candle and no matter I mean you could keep burying burying I think about those uh guys down in the uh M out there you know that's been buried for so many days and what if every one of them light went out how dark would it be down in that you know so many thousands of feet down in the earth we were in a cave one time with Josh with the um ra boys here or not uh Boy Scout Boy Scouts years ago and and I knew that God was going to do something so he made us all turn off our our uh little lights we had and we were way down underground and uh probably I don't know 7 or 800 ft at least cuz we had to go down and anyhow so in a minute he cut off his light well it was so dark in there to Bud you could feel how dark it was you know but in a minute he told a story of course he meant for to do that and he scared us all by not the story as much but immediately had a light that to go like that and that room was just all just totally lit up all at one time you know it wasn't have slow gradual but you know it's dark my point is what I'm saying that you can't not you cannot create a Darkness to put out light right right so darkness is not a creation so when it says there let there be light you know all right and the light appeared now Scofield says that the way brought it out the meaning there is basically that the light appeared all right and I was just thinking about it a minute ago and I thought you know well we could put it on here and then the person can get it and it won't be answering questions it'll just be a statement truth suppose back there you were standing with God Now everywhere he's ever been is light amen would you agree see the Bible says in him is no Darkness all right now there's no darkness in God all right that's right now he didn't have to create a light to make a light for it to be light see he was he was light amen all right but now out way from him would have been what so we need created the angels and the angels was around him I don't know how close I'm just making a point but so far out was light right those angels could worship him cuz they were not in darkness they were in light all right but then he said let there be light in other words bring light into the whole universe so he lit up the whole universe with his presence that's it amen right and then later he created the moon and and the star right see to control with but see in his presence is light all right now see like I said now light was just appeared it just appeared out there the question the person asked was was that Darkness was that Satan because of his fall you know you know I know he's the the god of the darkness I know all of that that's but still remember darkness is not a creation right and see Satan couldn't create Darkness amen you take and shut this room down as dark as could be but you take one little light and turn it on it expels all of that Darkness cuz there not it's not something it's not something that exists it's an absence right so then you just think about it when he said uh you know let there be light in other words let my existence move out far enough into the universe amen that there would be light amen then in his creation of the moon and the stars and the things like that you know the sun would be on over later as you know a a creation but just remember it's absence of light amen is what darkness really is okay maybe we found a way to answer questions we without answering them I get tickled sometimes I'm smart I'm such a dummy that I'm dummy but sometimes I think of good things all right now let's get into the point as I said and tried to cover there our Sunday morning that Paul in all of what he said of bringing it down to seeing Mel chdc and saying I things that I can't talk to you about you know right and then he says now here's the sum of this all right so what did he say now the sum of it was what what was the sum of all he had said what was it we have such an high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens now that's a great thing right see then Ecclesiastes he's bringing it up and he's summing up everything he said and concluding it right and he's saying what fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man all right now then I told you we would be reading these two and talking of the these things first I don't know how long because uh it's just a thought to put a a title and then we'll have a subtitle and so I said in the Bible and in the prophet's message and things and you know everybody said oh the prophet's message it's a Bible it's I I see the Bible and I see the prophet's message as an expounding uh understanding to be given to us that you can call all the Bible but it's not the Bible you know it's not we don't take the books and say we got two Bibles yeah Bible of the prophet and Bible of the Bible no no no that's that's not exactly my understanding I I I look at it like that the prophet was sent to give us the interpretation of the word of God all right and in doing that then if we consult the Bible and we consult the prophet then we've got to be close somewhere to understanding all right then but at then at that point it is still not Revelation just because we can bring together the two things see Paul was after he had spent a lot of time in bringing the Revelation then he says now here's the sum of it you know the sum of what he was saying we have a great high priest see that was a Revelation to him not a an intellectual conception that's right see an intellectual conception is wonderful CU we must have those before God can reveal anything to us but just remember because you can take this and put it together with this and come over and talk about it doesn't mean that it's necessarily a revelation right all right and it will show up after a while it may take quite a while but it'll show up and that's the way you check things you just give a man a change let him you know what was brother R said that that his mama said just give a cow enough rope she'll hang herself well that's what you do with people right you just give them enough rope and let them hang theel especially with preachers cuz after a while they will tie a knot and hang their own self you don't have to worry about it cuz at a while you'll see them you know and they'll start well brother brandham was wrong M well we know and you know Jesus was even wrong see now you done hung yourself right amen cuz you haven't let the thing come together as a conclusion right you haven't summed it up in a way to bring forth what is supposed to be brought right all right now I I I don't want to keep repea but I will repeat a lot of this in each one of the services because that's what I believe I believe the things brother brandom said sometimes are they do look contrary one to the other I I mean I agree you know like I said you give me any topic that you want to name a topic and I can by memory bring a quote from Brother random out of text of what he said and show you either side well that's been argued all the way down through time you know be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect none good know not one now both quoting scriptures but I believe both of them are right amen I believe both of them are right amen but it's got to be brought together to see the conclusion of the matter and then we would be able to understand and brother brandham he'll bring out things and then you know seem like here he'll bring out something and here he'll bring out something now I believe in progressive revelation amen right I told you that I believe brother brandom had to grow in Grace and knowledge I believe that because you know that would be true and he would say something here and he'd grow in Grace and knowledge but be careful because what he said was under the eyes of a prophet back when he said that and then when it would unfold that's my point I want you to see that I believe everything thing in the Bible the prophet's message and all goes from a partial realization of something you know beginning to see it to a perfect realization and is not that the way that we we are um you know we we get in our car and we say how much horsepower you to have well I got a 300 horsepower engine well you know you know why they call it horsepower it's rated according to much pull is there that's I mean that's I know it's carnal but it still pushes it down the road right I've always tried to tell you that the MU pushed the plow he didn't pull it but you won't believe it anyway so but see that car and all the way it's set up is to push that object right well then they just put more horsepower in it pushes a rocket pushes an airplane P it's just more horsepower because it comes from the fact of what one horse down here with one wagon and and doing that see I better say something cuz people think I sure am dumb but you better remember that when you put the gears on the horse the horse pushes the collar the collar pushes the gears the gears are hooked to the chain back to pull the wagon so it is pushing the wagon somebody hear that and they say are you stupid well that's all right I PL enough or know but listen to what I'm trying to say I believe everything unless it was something brother R said he was wrong about now when he said he was wrong amen we take the correction right right you know white horse rider on the things that he said when he said he was wrong we take the correction but if he didn't say it was wrong we better watch us trying to correct it right amen because we're not the prophet see that's right you know God gave a man a message and if he can't keep it straight what kind of a god do we have that's right you know I mean but now sometimes it looks so contrary one to the other but you'll find a wonderful Revelation a lot of time lays within the fact that you see two things looking totally contrary but after a while you see them come together they're so perfect right and you'll find out that was right here and he was right here so it goes from partial to perfect realization all right now so we're going to be taking some things uh like righteousness you know just some some topics and just going from the smallest that we can find of what the prophet would say about something to bring it up to you know the perfect realization of the day you remember how we gave it there Sunday that that uh brother Brandon was saying on glorified Jesus he's covered he said now when you get born again the Bible becomes a new book amen right I got this L here for you if you want to read it that was in 1955 225 then comes along a little bit later in contending for the faith and he said you can't right understand the Bible until you go over and see some of the Eastern Customs right I know he didn't never go to Israel but he went close enough to understand the Customs he went close enough to see the Sheep he went close enough to see the donkeys he went close enough to see the campal all right but he says you can't understand the B he said because under the Eastern understanding it becomes a new book right well and we know those are true see but then he comes along in 64 on uh God's power to transform and he says after the opening of The Seven Seals the Bible become a brand new book right now he didn't change did he right cuz you got to have the new birth get any understanding other than intellect and it really helps to see because we went there and saw as I told you in the Bible we read of a fig tree and we look around here and we see a bush it's never never know more than you know at the most 18 20 no more than 18 or 15 ft high and it's just a bush just all kind of Limbs going Every Which Way growing up from the ground but over there it's a tree right big tree 30 40 foot high thig tree so then we can understand but that was what I wanted you to see see getting those things and comparing what the prophet has said in his early Ministry now see a lot of people today say brother Brown changed about the New Birth well now we'll get to that I can show you where brother brownon said that I Tau three processes from the beginning and hadn't changed since amen that's right soever what he Tau was three processes every what you think he taught was three processes right see now that way the message is Will unfold so the will the Bible see then we can understand why things are said cuzz it needed to be said that there's none good no not one right cuz I agree with that 100% amen right but see then it needs to be said that we're perfect right amen I agree with that well how can you be no good and perfect well may but one way and that's in God Amen all right but see then we went down now to try not to spend much time but we went into the topic of what is sin and brother R said that there's no other sin but unbelief that was the invisible Union page 38 E36 or the Inner Man 531 1212 there's no other sin but unbelief all right then the Bible says in John 3:18 he that believeth not is condemned already okay and Hebrews 10:26 says if we sin willfully after receiving the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice you know all that's right right amen okay but then we ask the question there is no sin but unbelief we asked brother brandham the question and took his answer brother brandom do we ask Christians do we sin he said Christian is the only one that they sin right cuz the sinner is condemned on a higher level right that's positioned in Christ 196 522 you know paragraph 58 also in the same message and position in Christ he's talking about he said why it is each day we make mistakes each day we do wrong but if you're a born again man or woman as soon as you make the mistake God knows you're sorry for it you can't you can stand in the presence of President Roosevelt or anybody else and say God I'm wrong all right do you notice that it says s i ns a sinner is a sinner he does not commit sins but the church commits sins sin excuse me sin Singler does wrong gets a wrong thought wrong impression make Scruples wobbles like a little child walking trying to learn how to walk now so only Christians can sin because a sinner he just condemned as a sinner that's right he's not going to hell because he drinks and smokes and gamble see that's what we've all been taught all of our life in other words you say what is sin sin is always the thing you want to use against somebody else that's right you smoke you'll take the whole category of sin drank and gambling running around with women but you'll never mention that smoking all right but if you drink you won't mention that right so it's according what you want to gauge other people with but now the point I want you to get brother R says you sin every day and he said yes sir that's right paragraph 209 Hebrews chapter 6 all right do we sin all of us sin there is none without sin E6 contended for the faith 56 20 that what it is 2 20 I think every day you sin Paul said I covered his heart the other day he said I have to Die daily amen you said but now now brother Dale uh then are we all unbelievers now get the point of what we're talking about cuz I want to try to sum up this more than I did uh Sunday CU I just run up and run out of time then what is sin there's a only one sin and that's unbelief that's right now but was brother brandom an unbeliever when he said he sinned every day was Paul an unbeliever when he was a saying that he died daily that's a simple question to ask you when they said they did Sin now what about it what is your conclusion to the matter amen what are you going to sum it all up with and bring out a statement from those things where are you going and what are you going to do turn over and we'll read and then just stay there and we'll read a little bit more read look over in John and let's read Little John now first John you know the Little John over next to the Book of Revelation you say well let's just sin and then we try to explain now you hear a little bit of it now but I know it was used in the Presbyterian I talked brother Dick and him about it cuz they used to say things and and I know it wasn't the Baptist and people had what they call the sin of what was it omission and commission is that how the two words right and the definition of it was was one of them was the fact that you sinned and noted all right the other one was the fact that you sinned and didn't know you sinned you know well I never could understand it because all the sin I ever committed I know have done it right well see what it was was a sneaky way to justify some of the things that we've done you know oh I didn't know that was wrong I never read in the Bible as brother Mo said one day I never read in the Bible it says Thou shalt not steal chickens I read about horses cattle sheep but I never read about chickens well see it then you can say well it's all right me steal chickens right I didn't know it was wrong to do that now you ly through your teeth you knew all about it so get away from some kind of a propped up definition and try to come down to a sensible answer all right give an answer of the reason of the hope that is within you that's what the scripture says all right first John 1 18 well let's start in seven but if we walk in the light as he is in the light now that's that light he's talking about that's not daylight that's that light I was talking about to start with where he said let there be light called it's reveal word but if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son cleanses us from all sin oh that's good the blood of Jesus Christ CL you know cleanses us from all sin yeah verse eight if we say that we have no sin it didn't say if we say we have not or done what you know is no what did it say if we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in US words I say if you sin today what' brother brand say yes we sin every day did you disbelieve no we've got to get a little better answer somewhere look at the next if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness John look like he's saying over here you okay over here you ain't okay right verse seven covers but verse eight says we say we have no verse S said this blood of Jesus Christ cleanse us from all sin and he says we have we say we have no sin we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us right so we're just sinners now verse 9 what and if we confess our sins he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness right now if we sin we confess our sins and what if we say that we have not sinned that wouldn't mean that just that devil P the buck you remember the prophet in the garden you know and the the the the white woman you gave me you know the the animal done it you know pass the B get away some away but what does it say if we say that we have not sinned you talk to people in this message they say I always was eternal you can't call me a sinner well now if you always was eternal like that then there's no you can't condemn anybody right can you condemn God right sure on but you better be careful cuz God never was a sinner right amen God never had no sin that's right and all he done couldn't have been sin cuz he had no sin right he knew no sin the scriptures am if we say that we have not sinned we make him a liar and his word is not in us read the next verse chapter 2 right my love children these things right unto you that you sin not and if any man sin we have an advocate with the father Jesus Christ the righteous and he is the perpetuation for our sins and not for ours only but also for the sins of the whole world am so now we come up to what the bumper blood let the blood of bulls and goats covered cuz Adam in the garden as quick as he went wrong God killed the animals and the blood become an atonement and then all of those animal Bloods was pushed send forward blood atonement but the point I'm wanting us to get to make sure we understand is that not to make it that we've got some kind of a gimmick to get out of something right just be honest right brother Brandon do you sin he said every day but he could turn around back around and he'd say show me where I've ever disbelieved God's word right right why you sin didn't you you must have been a disbeliever now you going to argue with those things because remember an argument is only to try to prove your point right an argument has never been worth anything you're only trying to prove your point you and an argument right to just be honest and say hey look you know what you're looking at a sinner saved by grace you know what I'm looking like out that there sinner saved by grace that's right see God had to make a way to save me but for me to say that I've never sinned right that wouldn't mean now that was the devil no it was me I don't blame the devil for everything goes on in Me Maybe you do that's all right that's your business that's right we'll find out when we get on the other side about a lot of these things that's right but now what one will say one thing but the same man say one after the other right yeah see God has made a way all right but now his way is not for us to deny what we've done that's right amen you know prop it up with some reason the devil made me do it no you got some truth but not all truth but you see there's got to be something that we can get it right in so Paul to me sumed it up in Hebrews 8:1 there he said we've got a high priest now if you didn't have sin why do you need a high priest right remember the High priest's purpose was for what to atone for the people I'm sure he could go behind the veil and he could come back out and maybe tell you a lot of things but what was the high priest's purpose to atone for sin now there in John you find somewhere rather un close where we're at he says we have an advocate Jesus Christ the righteous an advocate now what do you need an advocate for if you not if you have it done wrong and are not going to do wrong well today I got born again now that ended sin for me from what we read from what the prophet said the day you got born again is when you really started sinning right now you you want to read it again only Christian sin CU that's why it says that's i ns right only Christians sin CU a sinner's condemned but my point is is to try to get us away from propping up our problems and things and trying in some way to justify something you know instead of just looking at it straight out right now if you got a high priest that means you need him amen right you need him to make an atonement for you that's right you got an advocate that means somebody that stands in your place amen all right so you need that for us to say we're not guilty or have not sinned we're Liars right to say that we don't sin every day we're Liars well you sure don't have a good way presenting something I'm sorry I would to God I could find better words but there's one thing about it and I get through you'll be thinking about it right right because you won't wind up with something there and say well I know what it was all the time no at least you'll think about what's being said right cuz you see folks whether you like it or not we're just Sinners that are saved by grace an unbeliever he's not a sinner he's just a human amen hey just a human being and that's where we were Paul said we were had our conversation and the that's where we were we were just human beings that followed after the world right and you know when you was in the world was you going around saying now you that drank and stuff like that and everything but did you go around back then saying well brother colie ask you that question okay when you was out there did you say well the devil made me do it and he says no well then why would we I'm not mean about you brother collie I'm just using why would we come up under Christianity then and try to blame the devil for what we do when that we were Sinners we we didn't even blame the devil that was your buddy you we were in his domain doing the things that he would do right right had no thoughts of sin right but then after becoming Christian sin enters the picture well brother d i I know though you're going to bring it down to it and but see the new birth is what takes care of it all right I agree with you the new birth makes you a Christian right and it does a way of all of your past sins now we've got a little negative that falls in here because the new birth does away with all of your P sins but it doesn't cleanse your marriage and divorce situation that you was right it doesn't do it see that's where people teach that it does where you going to get it from why brother around have to preach marriage and divorce for why didn't you just tell us the new bird took care of everything well you say this and you say that you're just confusing me no no I'm sorry you was already confused you got here that way right you blaming me for the point no uh-uh I'm giving you scripture the new birth does do away with sin right it chops off your past sins justification does that amen sanctification Works upon your nature of your being and your person then the baptism of the Holy Ghost comes and lives within you and then now you can go to John 1:3 all you can go to John 1:3 that says what whosoever is born of God does not commit sin for his seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin because he is born of God in this the children of God are manifest in what and the children of the devil the children of God and Children of the devil is Manifest in what whosoever doth not righteousness is not of God neither he that loveth not his brother right but now so we read that scripture whosoever is born of God does not commit sin so we went through the Baptist Presbyterian all of them days and trying to find out what the word commit me and we thought it meant this and we thought it meant that we we come up with the conclusion that that was just not a constant prac ice it was just a problem and you know and all this that and the other well that's all well and good but why not just be sensible if I can prove the point by the Bible and the prophet's message then you ought to be able to listen to it that once you're born again it's the seed that remaineth in you that doesn't sin amen that's right right that's what we just read right the seed don't sin it doesn't say that the person don't sin right say for his seed remaineth in you and you cannot sin now don't be too far off though let's remember keep it right just remember the blood of Jesus Christ doesn't atone for sin amen thank Lord cuz we're not going to die and go to hell if you're a sin if you're a Christian you could not sin enough to be able to be lost that's right there's no way if you're ever truly born again but if you're ever truly born again how would you want to do that why would you want to do things that are wrong what would be the thing that would be in your mind to make you think about it well I can do this and get by with it because I got a lovely father just remember we'll get on over here in a minute if we got time and we'll continue that positive to perfect we'll continue that looking like you know partial to perfect realization that part of looking like this one saying this and this is saying that we'll get on something else in a minute so just hold on I just want to make sure you understand me see it's the seed of God that cannot sin right it is not the product that is you're looking at right amen because you can't see the seat of God the seat of God is a new birth right that's within me and you can't see that so you can see me and my problems all right and here's the main point I want you to see please write this down just remember because you're born again it don't give you a right to sin but you're going to do it that's right because you're a human you're a human right the spirit and the body of a person is not born again right amen you're a human you're going to make mistakes you're going to do wrong anybody wants to say they went through the whole day today without sin you sure I'll just forg get mine out of the way but them behind me because I wouldn't want my hand up you know why I believe it that way no I don't think I got it wrote in your brain the Bible said anything that is not a faith is sin that's right anything that's not a faith the Bible said is sin so anything you and I do that's not connected with the Christian realm of Revelation is sin when we get over where brother random says it like this that at the Judgment seat you hear those Heathen screaming because you didn't y help them y we're not going to the white Throne I didn't say white Throne neither did the prophet say white throne but now listen anything you and I do as a human being that is not connected to the spiritually revealed word and the revelation of God's word is sin you know it's sin to eat too much but you know what you can make it a sin and not eat enough right that's what I was asking Richard the day he was talking about some of nutritional things and how they were little bitty I said why in the world can't us human beings find a middle of the road that's right we're either overweight or underweight and you never see a fat slob running down the road always skin right you go to the workout place it's not the fat men are women that are in there working out no it's the skinny ones why can't we find the middle of the road but the Bible says and the prophet says we're Sinners but then the Bible and the prophet both says we're not sinners now what are we going to do do let's draw a conclusion what are we going to do let's finalize this point of something that maybe will help us I mentioned it Sunday 1 John 5:116 And1 17 says there is a sin unto death but there's a sin that is not under death right now are you going to categorize sin as total unbelief it's easy to say that if it's if you're just going to have one conclusion of sin that it's unbelief you know just like that then you're going to have to send all of us to hell because we'd all admit we're sinners but you know in the Old Testament as I was bringing out Sunday you know that that the children of Israel sinned 10 times before they got to Cades Baria right and you know they was on their way to the promised land oh they got weapons for doing it but they was on the way to the promised land right when they got to Cades Baria and would not believe the two spies that brought the truth back right and a bunch of grapes they took two to carry and you know I don't believe the other 10 guys is carrying that I I just kind of believe that Joshua and Caleb was the two guys carrying Them Grapes you know cuz the others didn't want to bring back a good report some of them probably had little screen up dried up prunes carried them around you know no what all right but when they said God we can't do it right he said okay that's the unbelief that I'm not going to do that's one under death you sin now under death and you will die in the wilderness and the Bible says they were everyone dead that's right Jesus said our F they said unto the Jesus our fathers a man he said in there everyone dead which means eternally separated from God Amen now was everybody in the Old Testament eternally separated from God no no oh no no only those that the unbelief existed in so there must be something about Sin that we can talk about it in a a degree of understanding that it's not it's flat out killed us but there's a sin that is let's read that first what is it 1 John 5:16 right I want to read the whole thing verse 16 if a man see his brother sin a sin which is not unto death what so there's got to be a sin that's not under death so there must be a sin that is not un unbeliever because if it was not he couldn't have said that right are you listening don't you ever ask analyze anything as you try to read it I like what brother hter said he said if a equals B it's a good sign that b and a is the same thing I said hey that's a good point I remember that but look if any man see his brother s a sin which is not under death he shall ask and he shall give him life oh for them that sin not under death there is a sin under death I do not say that he shall pray for it all right unrighteousness is sin and there is a sin unto death now what's the next verse we know that whosoever is born of God sinth not but he is he that is B of God keepeth himself and that Wicked one touches him not MH all right now what is the sin unto death right now it's an unbeliever cuz he's condemned already all right now bring it on down a little closer what is the sin unto death brother Dale it is blaspheming the Holy Ghost right blaspheming the Holy Ghost is a sin under death cuz you dis believe God brother R said you be careful about what you see people doing and things that might be the Holy Spirit on them and he said you make a lot of it he said you can seal your doom you say well well brother Dale I remember when our life when somebody was doing so and so well ask God what you done wrong then ask him is he holding against you well I didn't know I needed to ask him what you do now ask him as he holding against you and don't be like Tammy Fay Baker that asked him was it all right to wear makeup she said he didn't answer me so I guess it was all right check out your life examine yourself to see whether you're in the faith or not you might lie to somebody and then really be in the Holy Ghost you can see you're done that's right am but I love this part of it because that's the next verse we just read what that where is it and we know that the Son of God excuse me where it where s is not okay Verse 18 we know that whosoever is born of God sent us not all right now if you got to baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't blashe the Holy Ghost that's right so you see why the prophet would say the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the most important thing that could ever be in life am all right if you're wondering about whether or not you sealed your doom on some things you done why don't you just seek the baptism of the Holy Ghost right right y well what do you mean I've had it 40 years I'm not going to argue with you I'm just going to ask you to same question again have you asked God to forgive you right have you just really ask God to forgive you of the things you done in your life well I thought when I got born again and took care of everything well you might find out one of these days we are just all Sinners saved by grace what's the difference between you and me and anybody else yep the New Birth the only difference amen that there is all right see what are we what are you trying to get to then brother Dale there's a sin unto death now here's one that's real close that you can pray for the person that is just a sinner is that right you see your brother s a sin that's not under death you pray for him in other words you see somebody do something wrong he's not laughing making fun of God he's out done something wrong he's backslid he's went off done this out or the other will you pray for him amen but if he's out there lifing and making fun of the word of God you're not supposed to pray for him because right he's blaspheming well now he doesn't know it well now the ones that does know we going on that route okay but you see if this church prays for somebody you know if something goes wrong and we've had to do it to where we commit somebody in other words we lose them from the church see if you lose somebody from the church you can't pray for that person anymore right that's right and you leave it up to God whether or not they've done wrong if they're a Christian they'll straighten up and come back cuz the devil to go after them but if they're not a Christian you'll find out they've already blasphemed right he said brother Dale you put limits upon what we no no don't put no limits I put Bible that's why I try to tell you over and over about your families your children husband wife Etc you commit them to you say all right I want to commit them to the Lord cuz we don't believe in committing to the devil we believe in committing to the Lord the prophet said and then he commits them to the devil so we're not turning somebody over to the devil that's not you know you turn him over to God and God turned him loose and then you see the person starting getting sicker and sicker oh Lord I didn't mean that now you just interrupted God's plan right leave it alone that's right yes but that's my child but what are we going to do go contrary to the word because it's your child you could do it for somebody else but you couldn't do it for your own you see folks I stand in a horrible place it's like I've always told you so you can sit back there and you can say well brother or sister so and so done so and so who's got the first stone throw it well then hand the stone cuz I'm the guy that has to throw the stone I can't help it cuz I'm going one in charge because I got to follow what the word says right I know that ain't what we're talking about okay do we do things because we're unbelievers or is it the fact that because of seeing that there is a sin under death and a sin not under death and seeing those things is it the fact that we can look at it with a basis of thinking well all right God doesn't kill us for all the things we do right and we're covered by the blood to keep him from destroying us because we done one thing wrong without the blood of Jesus Christ we'd be stoned to death from heaven so then it must be things in our lives that that we can talk about then that are are not what would be called a sin un death but just remember now oh youall found it Romans 14 and 23 says whatsoever is not a faith is sin that's Romans 14:23 in the Old Testament it was the blood that covered their sins Adam didn't kill the animal God did and made a blood atonement got a lot of quotes down through here where that the blood of Jesus Christ is a bumper blood to cover you and I I I'm under that bumper of blood where would we be now remember the bumper blood is the blood of Jesus Christ the life of Jesus Christ Living In You and I by the new birth all right right you understand it the life living in Us by the new birth but everybody in the world is under the bumper blood to the basis that he's not destroying it'll be when it's all finished brother Bram says paragraph 264 the proving his word 64 716 said God don't see me he just hears my voice through the blood of Jes Jesus Christ so what is the difference between you and I and The Sinner we're all under the bumper all protected see what's going to happen one of these days the reason the wrath of God is going to be poured out in the tribulation that the bride does not go through the tribulation the wrath of God will be poured out why because when the bride goes the Holy Ghost goes right amen the blood atonement is gone that's it the mercy seed in the Old Testament when the blood left the mercy seed it was become a judgment seat so is it when we leave out of here but now watch see these are things that people don't like to cover but you know all sin must be accounted for now whether it be a little sin that is not under death a big sin that is under death one day there's going to be an answering day all right now there will be a white thrown judgment one day that the sinner will have to stand before foolish virgins Etc will have to stand before the white Throne judgment to give an account but you see to be a Christian don't give you a license to steal right because just remember we gave it the other day where the Prophet said you sin a sin as a Christian you will reap a washtub full and you know what's the biggest Warr that I've ever had poured on me or been in is for me to allow Satan to come within me in enough to speak to me through my body and my spirit to be able to get me to think wrong to act wrong right to do wrong you don't ever do wrong I wouldn't you see I I believe we got to have an atonement sir to cover our sins but you see the bride now be glad to give you these brother brand them on the U 225 Church age book he said that won't be the bride sitting there you know before the Judgment he said she'll be sitting on the throne with him right amen he goes over to 278 of the same book and he says where it says there're as sheep you remember in ROM I mean in Matthew 25 I think it's talking about the white Throne judgment it says as sheeps and goats he said see that's not sheep cuz it says as sheep right see the as sheep is the foolish virgins right that claim it but they don't have a total possession they're not sheep but they're as sheep see the foolish virgins and the people like that in the center will have to stand at the watch thr own judgment but we're going to set on that judgment with him cuz brother Brandon you know I I've tried to give you the the the things that we like paragraph uh 970 of the questions and answers 19 in conduct order Doctrine 64 823 brother Rand would explain what this is going to be and what this is going to be and what this is going to be and this is going to be I love that all right now here you got the Bri she goes up in the Rapture right the tribulation comes after we go up in the Rapture we're already made Eternal Body Spirit and soul so we don't go through the tribulation we miss all of that and he tells about the Millennium that we go through the millennial Reign and then we go up on out of Realms of the earth while Satan is being annihilated Etc and things is happening then there'll be a white Throne judgment and we'll sit on the throne with him judging the world Bible says you'll even judge Angels that's a born again believer not that we chose maybe to do it but he chose it right but see then there'll be a future home you know but my point is now we're going to have and not we're not going to be at that before the white Throne because we done been Eternal for over a thousand years of Earthly time the bride don't sit on don't stand before the Judgment but now what about these scriptures look in Romans 14 14: 10 but why Dost thou judge thy brother or why does thou set it not which means to despise why do you despise my brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seed of Christ yeah where's that drop over to Second Corinthians 5 and 10 for we must all appear before the Judgment seat of Christ that everyone may receive the things done in his body according to that he hath done whether it be good or bad even Scofield says that this is not the white Throne judgment because it's not the believer's works it's the believer's works but not the sin of the believer that's in question and he knew that by the Greek and the things from studying it cuz one is the be a judgment and I forgot what the other one is there's two judgments in the Bible of judgment seat of Christ one is the white Throne judgment but we don't set go before the white Throne judgment we set on the white throne with him that's right judging the world but there is a judgment of the Deeds Done in the body whether good or bad so every sin that you and I do as a human sinner Christian we must give an account why else would you want to plead some fact that you think you're okay and I'm born again it don't matter what I do now you're on once saved always saved Baptist Doctrine cuz that's what they believe like Steven Wilson said one day stepen I said he said you know they going to have to do away with hell cuz there ain't going to be nobody there cuz everybody's going to heaven cuz don't matter how mean a guy is the preacher that's up in the pool pit he'll say brother so and so is up in heaven now rejoicing with his family you you say well how do you know well he paved the parking lot one time see his name on that [Music] Pew you know let's don't be that way okay am let's be straight and honest and just face the fact of one thing that we're all Sinners saved by grace and everything that we do in this world that's not a faith is sin and just face it up to the front of knowing I want to be clean I'm like brother brand said about the old black brother he said I just don't want no trouble when it comes down to the river that's right I told you that while ago if you're a born again Christian there's no way that a born again Christian can sin enough to be able to be lost and die and go to hell you can't do it but your life could be short what about the man on the Hebrew Book the preacher that got some beer and got drunk went out two weeks later he's dead brother around said God will not let his child Mar his name did you see we'll all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ that's not the white Throne judgment but it's a judgment of the Deeds Done in the bodies that we read whether they're good or bad it's fine to think about the rewards of what good we do cuz you know on that same quote that brother brandham I had it in there somewhere the same quote where he says that he would hear at the what at the at the Judgment seat of Christ we would hear those heer screaming out but right down below it he says but just think you're the people that give the money for me to go he said you'll be rewarded for that it's whether it's good or bad if we don't confess our sins here then somewh the question will be asked us what about the time you done so and so and didn't straighten up it's like I told you people believe it's been preached here by Brother one time years ago that he believe the new birth took care of all your sins even your marriage and divorce I said I can't go that way New Birth finished in a Rapture maybe that's what he's talking about I don't know but just because you say you're born again the prophet had to preach marriage and divorce that's right amen if not you could have not received the grace and it's a whole lot more you know how I preach it it's a whole lot more than just what you've done in your body you can sit right there and say I virgin born and all this that and the other and that's wonderful but it goes into the spiritual too what about spiritual fornication have we ever asked him to for to forgive us of the things we believed as the Trinity that we used to believe in as the things we used to believe have we asked him to forgive us so then there'll be a judgment seat don't ask me where it's at and when it takes place cuz I don't know you say well it's here well if it's here we better start confessing everything we do wrong instead of letting it pass the Bible said don't let the s the sun go down on your wrath that's why every night when your head hits the pillow the last thing you should say is Father forgive me that's the way I pray I pray thank you Lord for all that you've given me the understanding of your word and the healings and signs and wonders and the things and Lord I love you forgive me of my sins cuz I don't want nothing see if you say forgive me I can even show you where brother Brown says it like this he said God knows your heart and you didn't mean to do that and he said it wouldn't even counted you said well cuz he he knows her heart he knows our heart amen but see sin has to be dealt with amen right that's why we're going to St go by the grave why because we won't face up to who we are and what's going on we try to think about all of the things that that is this that or the other I was thinking today about it you know people say well brother D I don't believe you're at adoption I've never said where I at never have said nothing about it some say brother Dale you're adopted some says brother Dale we don't believe you are well if you don't believe I am and I'm not saying whether I'm not CU don't know if you're not if you're saying I'm not then what are you gauging it by you must be gaging it by your life okay it goes into the wrong thing folks why why don't we want to judge anyway why don't we all want to have Grace and believe for everybody and pray for everybody other than what the scripture says don't pray but if we done all of her praying rightly there probably wouldn't be much if we couldn't pray for when you read that scripture that said if a brother see a brother s a sin you ask and it'll be given what it's like that scripture call for the elders last see quot call lay hands on the sick right and if they've committed any sin right it shall be forgiven them that's right you mean because you prayed for them well that's what the Bible says right amen you can pray for the sins of the people but do you understand what the conclusion I'm trying to make trying to draw it to a conclusion that Judgment of the deeds in the body somewhere we're going to have to answer for what we didn't confess here right you said well then I don't understand it because you say that perfect I'm perfect when I'm standing in him and when my sins are confessed I'm standing perfect about two minutes later you got other things to deal with right would you agree with it you can stand there one time and be so perfect until the god of Glory can come down into your presence and in the next minute you wouldn't want God to come for nothing that's right but J I'm just trying to get you to see partial realization perfect realization brings us to an understanding that sure we're all Sinners today but we have an atonement which is the blood of Jesus Christ we have his own life dwelling within us by the new birth that's right amen and we plead that blood and that day said God forgive me sister used to go to church here years ago she said brother Dale this is way back when we was preaching he said the way you and brother M are preaching how perfect we are this is exactly what we was preaching she said who did I pray to I said sister you've missed the whole point see she didn't realize that she was a sinner I realize I'm a sinner I don't know what you think I'm a sinner that's saved by grace I can't be lost because God can't be lost and the seed of God cannot sin that remains in me but my body and my spirit can always do wrong and until that is made Eternal I have a problem to dealing every day in my life that's why you you say Brother D I don't understand how sometimes you can put up with things cuz listen folks I remember one thing every how I look down on you that's the way my God is looking down on me but yes I got to tell us the truth I got to say truth like truth and call it truth that's right but just remember it's from my heart of love I preach because I love you not to be saved I don't have to preach to be saved I preach because I love you and want you to see the truth but I want you to see it as truth I want you to look at things in the Bible to where that you can look at it and say listen what God Said is right he said we're all Sinners then he says we're all Saints y he said they nothing good know I one then he says you're as perfect as your father is well now there ain't but one way that can be done it has to be what he done right amen it has to be what he's doing cuz I thought we believed that the headstone would be coming crying what Grace Grace unto it what is hollering Grace to us we hollering Grace back save by grace through faith and none of your own salvation is of the Lord so you just make it look like no just remember we're the ones that's doing what I'm talking about now you can't get it get this point you see if I do something wrong and I know what I'm doing is wrong and I want to admit that is wrong and ask God to forgive me then he's going to hold that against me he has a right right because he offered me a little simple explanation just say I'm sorry like I told you about the brother though years ago he bought me two $50 shirts this is back in the 80 two $50 shirts to give to me only had to do say I was wrong I'm sorry me never would say I'm sorry have you ever really just said I'm sorry youve ever said Lord I'm sorry Lord I'm sorry for being the way I've been amen have you ever said it but you know what God will keep his promise no matter what we do he promised it I'm glad of that stand for let's Stand Together see is sin or we just a bunch of unbelievers no that seed remaineth in you that that that was inside of you can't blasing the Holy Ghost cuz that's what a sin under death is is to blasing the Holy Ghost you can't do that but you can have problems and you know what our problems do then are you going to blame God for us being sick come on we're human we're under the curse right but you know what we done it this way you know I mean when I was somewhere in the 40s I drank so many Dr Peppers helping terance do his house up there 10 and something degrees up in that roof and just I just down Dr Peppers just one right after another and you know what I run my elevation of the sugar up to not to the sugar but it wound up with being high blood pressure you know what if we eat too much at the wrong time are we not bringing those things upon us and way it is now what can you eat I mean come on honestly what can you eat cardboard probably be better than anything you know what would be more healthier than anything to go down to the store and buy some dog food there's more inspection of dog food than there is human food they put better stuff in dog food than what they put in the human stuff it would be better eat dog food maybe we're swapping the wrong place but I know I still love to eat you know I just pray God sanctify this and help me but like a brother said one time he said how can can I wind up being wrong if I ask God to sanctify you got a point but he told you you eat too much pork and you will have high blood pressure now how now how high blood pleasure would me asking God to sanctify it that might be one of them little sins we have right cuz we know better to do it we know better than to eat sweets too much right we know better than to eat too much red meat why cuz it's contrary to the body so balance it up at least do the best we can what do we got 8 number 58 red book 58 in the red book anybody have a need there's a [Music] call there are souls to resue there are souls to
