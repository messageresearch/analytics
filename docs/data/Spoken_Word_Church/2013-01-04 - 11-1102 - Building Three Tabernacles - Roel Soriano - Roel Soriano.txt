connection amen there you go this is my uh uh second time to this church it can just be seated for just a little while like i was saying this is my second time in this church and um i feel a kindred spirit in this church you know i've been to i pitched to uh bigger congregations and i i just don't feel the same all right i want to preach for a church that's uh a small crowd and and and you feel the uh welcome spirit right amongst the people and it makes it just makes you feel at home last year i think i mentioned to you that um we were in the process of building a church and uh in january as us talking to a brother to dale's uh son i forgot to say okay and uh us telling you about the dedication of our church we're going to dedicate our church in january i think louise and sister christine is gonna try to make that one to make it to the philippines so uh i just would like to share with you um some pictures that we took of the uh building but first uh let me just testify that in the year 2009 there was a big typhoon that came to metro manila and it flooded most of the 14 cities of metro manila and in the place where we were having services there was 15 feet of water and we just lost everything you know the church equipment instruments everything we just uh and so uh it necessitated the need to go look for a place that's situated on higher ground and we've been saving for 10 years saving money for 10 years to buy a lot and there was 4 dollars in our account but we we found this law uh and it's a six thousand square foot of uh land in a business a central business district of the town of taitai just outside outside of manila uh it's on the foot situated on the foot of a mountain which is much higher altitude than metro manila and the cost was eighty thousand dollars u.s we only had four thousand right and uh when we had a meeting in church uh the brothers said there's just no way we can start negotiating we only have 4 000 in our coffers and i said of course there's a way we can pray and we organize what we call a a chain chain prayer or prayer chain where believers take turns um praying for two hours at a time uh for the whole month of june 24 7. it's like we were bombarding heaven with our prayers with the petition of um uh the lord providing for a lot for us and also a building because what good would a lot do we and mid july we were able to pay the down payment of the lot and in january this year um it was fully paid don't ask me where the money came from because it came from uh uh people we didn't even expect uh have money right amen and then it was time for us to uh build the uh build a church i'm an engineer so i designed the whole thing and i asked the brother to uh draw the plans for me and uh we estimated the cost to be 120 000 and we had nothing because this you know we used everything on the purchase of the lot and we had nothing so i told them we need to pray again in the month of august we started excavating the foundation and on december 19 the same year 2010 last year we were able to use the facility for our services center there's a picture of the sanctuary there hey man next uh and that's the balcony you know where about 100 people more people can um sit in the next picture see that's our planter and that's a one day old garden my brothers they do this for a living you know landscaping so they planted the plants in the morning i took a picture in the afternoon so as you can see we're still working on the left side of the building yeah and that's a view from the platform that's another view amen and that's the third floor if you notice the the facade part of it and the front part of it is three stories second floor is the balcony and the third floor is we're using this to uh hold uh some fellowship you know in the church like a first fellowship room you can see it in this next picture but we're using it already the spoiler that's the restroom and on top of it we're building a parsonage where the ministers from from the country and from uh from overseas can come and stay amen that's the view deck that's the fourth level actually um we use it um we planned it to be a view deck because you see a fantastic view of the mountain on the left side and on the right side you see the skyline of metro manila so that's the roof and as you can see we were still using plastic chairs and then we built the the kills we built it ourselves we built it out of mango trees so that's the parsonage and the restrooms and we're we're working our our prime room it's unfinished now we're supposed to put a glass door in between the sign curry and fry room and we just want to thank you for paying for us and it has proven to be a tremendous blessing not only to our congregation but other church groups as well in the message because we hosted four or five conventions already we hosted in august we hosted a a youth convention where more than 400 uh young people from five or six different churches in metro manila came together and uh there's about three or four weddings lined up already for the end of the year it used to be that uh we were using um denominational facilities for special functions like weddings and it's not always easy to rent them you know because they want to know if you believe the trinity and but now we're so thankful we're so happy that we have something that we can call our own amen amen thank you because and i want you to be continue to pray for us because we're still working on it as you can see okay thank you lord this is my water okay now we go to the word of god the soul stand i'm going to speak on the subject which i entitled building three tabernacles building three tabernacles and our scripture reading is in matthew chapter 17 and verse one till the eighth verse of course the background of this is um jesus was speaking to the disciples and he said uh some of you who are standing here will not see death until they see the until you see the son of man coming in his kingdom and in in the first verse of matthew 17 says here after six days six days after he said that right after six days jesus jesus take pierre james and john his brother and bring them up onto a high mountain apart and was transfigured before them right his face did shine as the sun and his raymond was white as light and behold there appeared unto them moses and elias talking with him amen and then answered peter and said unto jesus lord it is good for us to be here if thou wilt let us make here free tabernacles one for thee one for moses and one for elias while he but what he had spake behold a bright cloud overshadow them and behold a voice out of the cloud which said this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased hear ye him amen and when the disciples heard it they fell on their face and were so so afraid and jesus came and touched them and said arise and be not afraid and when they had lifted up their eyes they saw no man save jesus only amen let us pray father we commit this service to you lord and we're asking lord as we humble ourselves that you come lord anoint the speaker and the hearers alike lord jesus that we may come to a clear understanding lord of what you have in mind for us lord tonight we want you to take all glory and honor in the service lord in jesus name we pray amen amen when jesus said some of you standing here will not see that or taste of that until you see the the son of man coming coming in his kingdom so jesus was actually talking about the coming of the lord right right amen the second coming of the lord and uh some of the disciples actually you were placing it way into the future and well we found out in matt in the 17th chapter that this happened six days after jesus made a statement all right and it says here after six days right right after six days is the seventh day hallelujah and uh uh oh and of course uh um we can say uh that uh the seven days spoken of here um represents the seven church ages and it's on the seventh day of the seventh day is when the revelation of the coming of the lord will come to the church amen hallelujah all right and uh we see here that not everyone was called to go to the mountaintop with jesus not all of the disciples that's right but only uh peter james and john so that tells you that all of us will not come to the same revelation same level of revelation at the same time sometimes we may have to depend on our brothers sharing with us right and uh we see here in in in second peter chapter 1 verse 16 when peter was talking about this experience that he had on this mountain second peter chapter 1 verse 16. if you can just turn with me we'll read it together peter said we have not followed cunningly devised fables when we made known unto you the power and coming of our lord jesus christ exactly but were eyewitnesses of his majesty he's talking about the power and the coming of our lord jesus christ i think he's talking about the seventh seal here the coming of the lord jesus christ verse 17 but he was he received he jesus received from god the father honor and glory when there came such a voice to him from the excellent glory this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and this voice which came from heaven we heard when we were with him in the holy mountain right and that's when peter james and john looked at the lord and he was transfigured before them amen right his image became glorious before them right that's right and according to the words of peter this was the father's honor and glory being bestowed to the son hallelujah now what do you do with the scripture in isaiah chapter 42 verse 8 where it says i am the lord and that is my name and my glory will i will i not give to another neither my praise to raven images exactly amen now these two verses seem to contradict each other right because here the father peter said the father gave honor and glory to his son on that mountain hallelujah but in isaiah chapter 42 he said i am god i am the lord and i my glory will i not give to another neither my place to get driven images then why did the father give his glory to the son then according to the words of saint saint peter hallelujah that's because the first person of the father and the person of the son amen is the same amen they are one person there's a teaching now that goes around it's it's uh it's been to our country and uh certain elements trying to convince people message churches that the trinitarians are wrong because they believe in three persons and the oneness are wrong because they believe in one person because god they say is actually two persons the father and the son two persons i i guess they call it two lords doctrine right hallelujah all right let me tell you what amen isaiah said god through the lips of isaiah said i will not give my glory to another amen hallelujah when he gave his glory to his son he did not actually give it to another right amen because the son and the father is the same person amen hallelujah i want you to hold on to that thought now right now because the story doesn't end there amen hallelujah thank you jesus and uh we read in a church age book literacy and church age burban speaking about the capstone revelation he said it very clearly and now in this last age we have come back to the capstone revelation it is the most important revelation that's right of godhead in the whole bible and that is jesus is god right he and the father are one amen and there is one god and his name is the lord jesus christ but we can put it any prayer hallelujah don't let anybody try to sway you away from this revelation this is called the capstone revelation that's the reason the amount of transfiguration happened on the mountaintop amen hallelujah thank you jesus and peter in his unconverted state when exposed to the supernatural right to the presence of god he was overwhelmed right and he didn't know he didn't know what to do he wanted to build three denominations right there right oh my of course we prioritize the lord we're gonna build three tabernacles one for you and one for moses and one for elijah yeah he is doing the lord some paper because he was number one hallelujah but moses as great as great as a prophet moses was you know he came to egypt as a one-on-one one-man army one like invasion vervain said and set the people up set the people of god free he parted the red sea all right man hallelujah what a ministry this prophet had right hallelujah but as plaintiff ministry moses had god is showing us that we are not to build a tabernacle in honor of moses amen don't build a tabernacle from moses hallelujah don't feel a tabernacle for elijah hallelujah because as great as a ministry elijah was hallelujah he is still a person right yeah yes he's a sinner hallelujah saved by the grace of god hallelujah nothing more like you and me it's a special vessel oh by which the lord spoke to the people hallelujah he was not god hallelujah elijah could not save anybody all right exactly hallelujah we have one savior and that's the lord jesus christ that is why uh before even peter uh ended his statement a bright cloud over shadow man hallelujah this this is god and the lord the envelope in his disciples the believers with his presence i see uh to keep them from being deceived right amen and they were afraid right but the lord touched them right amen and they when they when they uh looked up they saw no one there but jesus only amen see god god is um showing them that um that only jesus deserved to be worshipped jesus deserve to receive honor and glory hallelujah yes sir all right bless you praise god okay they actually saw the coming of the lord right or right uh simply paul it is actually the preview of the glorious coming of the lord amen from the son of god all right man hallelujah we read in luke chapter 16 and verse 16 the law and the prophets were until john right since that time the prophets were since that time the kingdom of god is preached and every man pressed it into it right hallelujah amen so they saw jesus amen exactly and moses hallelujah which represented the law right elijah represented the prophets that's actually the old testament right this scripture doesn't mean there'll be no prophets after john the baptist but this scripture actually means that after after the old testament comes christ hallelujah after the old testament comes john the baptist who introduced the new testament in the person of christ john the baptist message was there he is the lamb of god that takes away the sins of the world right exactly is that right hallelujah so god was saying don't be the tabernacle for moses or elijah right right now how many knows that we have a moses today oh yeah right and that's better right yeah mother branham is our moses for today hallelujah he was the one that set us free from denominational bonding amen he got us out of egypt hallelujah but he is also our elijah exactly that's right hallelujah moses and elijah amen bundled together in one person hallelujah glory what does that tell us we're not supposed to build a tabernacle for moses or for elijah all right amen we're not supposed to build a tabernacle for our moses and our elijah today amen for jesus amen hallelujah you know god did not even allow peter to build a tabernacle for jesus hallelujah if he allowed it then he would have a reason to go to that mountain i think it's not mount olives right go to the mountains and be on a pilgrimage that's why god did not allow it hallelujah and what is a tabernacle the tabernacle is a shelter it's like a house exactly and what do you why we build a house it's to shelter and protect those that are going to live in the house right so what was peter's intention i'm going to shelter god oh yeah i want to shelter i want to build a house for jesus hallelujah it's a safe you know he was trying to do a service to god right right and help him it reminds me of one time when the great king david he was looking out the window of his terrace yeah of his great palace and he was probably pondering how the lord has blessed him right oh yeah hallelujah and then he's you know he's living in this house big house of cedars and he happened to look where the lord was living at that time and the lord was in a tent right and david felt so bad that he was living in a palace and he's god that blessed him right he's god of whom he's a servant glory is still living inside a tent right right and so he called nathan the prophet he said nathan i want you to tell god i'm going to build him a house amen so he david thinks he's he's he's doing god's service right oh yeah david thinks you know he feels feeling sorry for god now yeah after the lord has blessed him hallelujah well in the book of elections chapter 2 verse 13 it says for it is god which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure exactly even the will to serve god even the revelation the faith that give god hallelujah in believing god hallelujah it comes from god right now we got it from him right amen you have nothing to offer god right right amen hallelujah you think you're talented yeah you think you're prosperous you can help god hallelujah yeah there's nothing you can offer right we cannot help god right right right hallelujah god will help you but you cannot help god and peter wants to protect god you can't protect god right god will protect you all right amen you know they they like to write books and because they wanted to preserve the purity of the message oh yeah yeah and they wanted to uh protect the message you can't protect the message the message will protect you hallelujah the message is a life of its own all right hallelujah exactly that's why i i think it's ridiculous that some people claim to have a franchise of the message they want to protect the message yeah hallelujah in 1964 going beyond the calm peter branham spoke what hap spoke about that happened on a month of transpiration and he said what did they see after his voice spoke to them even moses and elijah wasn't present right neither was their creed nope right neither was anything left but jesus only amen and he is the word amen that's all they see right now hallelujah so god was trying to veer them away from the personalities of moses and elijah and direct them to jesus only right and he is the word hallelujah god does not want us to to be following men hallelujah he wants us to take the head shape of the word that's right exploits in 1953 i said if you start in your organizations you're going to build the thing right back around personalities of this earth yeah yeah and you're going and you're going to have the same thing that we got now he said don't build it around any certain organization right or any certain person but build it around jesus christ amen that's right amen right now i'm trusting by the tale that this building has been erected by the honor and glory of jesus christ alone amen exactly right not to some to the honor of or to the glory of some organization or some person but build it around jesus christ he said that's the one put it around christ hallelujah fellowship by redemption 1955. listen to this but when you see so many things rise up under flattery and ministers ministries built on personalities right then you are going to be setting on sinking sandwiches right amen all right yeah maybe i'm something already hallelujah because they rally around a certain personality all right that's all they promote that's right we're not here to promote any personality that's right i'm here to promote christ alone all right hallelujah then you're going to be setting on sinking sands he said a ministry must be built totally and holy upon the lord jesus christ all right the bible right no matter what any new thing comes up oh yeah come on glory god yeah i like this brother in in the baby of hebrews chapter one and verse one it says god who at some right times and in diverse diverse honors speaking time past unto the fathers by the prophets he used many prophets in this last day spoken to us by his son amen come on hallelujah whom he had appointed heir of all things moses is not the heir of all things right elijah is not the heir of all things hallelujah now the glorious ministers of the prophets have now been swallowed up in the glorious image of christ amen right hallelujah the prophet of the day of this generation right yeah he's not on the scene now right but christ is still here right amen that's right hallelujah all right when they buried better graham's body yeah when they buried the prophet right they did not bury the pillar of fire right right that's right glory you're still here amongst his people that's right hallelujah amen a denominational church is a church that is led by man right now yeah that's right that's the only difference right right may look a lot look alive yeah i'm sure people may dress alike right right and and the people may believe alike hallelujah but verbum said a denominational church is a church that is left by man right amen the truth church of the living god is headed by the lord jesus christ amen no two ways about it right but said denominationalism is a carnal church system that separates brotherhood right oh amen hallelujah it's not a guaranteed guarantee that you call yourself a message hallelujah that you'll be free from denominationalism come on amen hallelujah all right amen that's right because the system that holds this church is one that separates brotherhood you know i hate believers uh they they can talk about uh nothing else but their church their pastor their choir yeah their young people their missionary and their war yeah hallelujah and they don't care about our believers yeah and they seem to be in a competitive mode in competition with other groups and verb said trying to out do yeah the next church trying to build the biggest church the bigger from the next church hallelujah than the next church i should say hallelujah it's a carnal system that separates brotherhood that's right call yourself a message if you want but you know if you still have the spirit in you hallelujah you're still in the denomination right right that's right if you can fellowship with other without a checks group and if you can if you find it hard to work together with other believers in advancing the cause and all you see is your efforts all you see is your own local church come on hallelujah you become a denomination that's right it's true you know family stops going to church because they couldn't find the perfect church yeah all right so they just stay home and just play tapes and have service in the house hallelujah i call that a denominational family because in reality they can't they're not able to submit themselves to nothing right hallelujah but their own principles their own rules right right hallelujah amen you know that you can be one individual and be a denomination by yourself that's right amen you know people like that everybody's wrong but them thank you jesus jeremiah chapter 17 verse 5 says thus said the lord cursed be the man that trusted in man and make it flat the flesh of uh make it flesh his arm and his heart departed from the lord right how beautifully jeremiah puts this right if a man if a believer of somebody that wants to serve god trust in the arm of flesh meaning follows a man he follows a man his heart departs from the lord look at that right hallelujah he's so dependent on this man on this great litter leader that his heart departs from god exactly hallelujah serpent said did you know barbara said this 1958 he said you tabernacle here i told you we were going to change the name of this it's not right for it to be branham tabernacle that's just a man see we were going to change the name of it make it some other name yeah you said it yeah yeah right as far as i know it's still called branham tabernacle hallelujah he said we'll get on that after a while i just want it to be the church of the living god oh my amen i don't want it methodist baptist presbyterian pentecostal brandon mike right yeah i mean i just added that right right not say that right but it did say you wanted to change the name of the church hallelujah because we are not to build a tabernacle for moses or elijah or some great man hallelujah if we are to build a church it's not to be supposed to be built around certain personalities but it should be built up around jesus christ and jesus christ is the word amen amen he is the true head of the true church of the living god that's right amen hallelujah of the spirit this is very strong quote 1956. he said do you believe you can do that today you can make an idol out of your church you can make an idol out of your pastor you can make an idol out of an evangelist and i'm afraid that that's what a whole lot of it is being done yeah amen but about them saw it in this day right right so a whole lot of this is happening right now right people are not following christ but they are following a man right that's right they're not this under subjection to the headship and leadership of the world but under the headship of man amen rejected king look how verbal said it speaking about saul he said now that's the kind of man that people like to choose today what kind what kind of what kind of a man the people does not seem to be satisfied with the way that god placed his church to be governed and controlled by the holy spirit right they want somebody some man some denomination certain people to govern the church and that they are not able to throw themselves completely into god's hand and to be spiritually led by the holy spirit they want somebody to do their religion for them that's right exactly they want the pastor to to tell the sisters just how to wear their dresses yeah yeah hallelujah and how to lead their families and and there are more and more message churches message churches in our country that are leading this way yeah they're teaching a very strong headship yeah hallelujah right so that whatever the pastor says it's like um it's like the word of god yeah right the pastor's word is infallible hallelujah they're saying now that christ and the church types the pastor and the local congregation the pastor is the husband of the local congregation and as christ is the giver of the sid and the church is only the receiver it's just on the receiving part and and and the church has no right to question whatever the lord teaches oh yeah and and then they they parallel that to the relationship between the pastor and the congregation the congregation is not supposed to question the pastor they say hallelujah but you'd wonder because a lot of people are more inclined to to uh to be under subjection to the pastor oh yeah yeah done to the word of god right sure hallelujah this is better what exactly is saying hallelujah that the people cannot be satisfied with the way with the way god meant for the holy spirit to be the leader of the church there's a reason why that had to be his last sermon right hallelujah leadership was his last sermon before he he preached a message on communion yeah hallelujah and in that in that sermon he pointed us to our true leader he did not point us to some of his trainees to some of his hunting buddies hallelujah giving that point to some great man truly they will not point it away the lamb of god who take it away the sin of the world amen right amen amen hallelujah that's what a true leader will do right amen amen amen they want somebody to do their religion for them somebody that will tell them just how to do it and all about it yeah right so this man seemed to be to suit the place exactly so right because he was a very intellectual man and then he said it's a whole lot like today we like to choose such people too to control our churches to control the church of god nothing that i have to say against it but just merely to make a point that it is not and it was not and it will never be the will of god for such to be right god is to rule his people and to govern each individual right right right how many times did we hear where did him say when he deals with israel he deals with them as a nation as a group when when he deals with a gentile church he deals with a gentile church as individuals right amen that's right amen hallelujah you won't make it to the rapture just because you come to church here very obedient to the leadership of this church your pastor your deacons hallelujah assure you of being in the rapture that's right brother amen said this is not a group revelation that's right it's not even a family the bible says two will be in the bed and what will be taken and right right that's true hallelujah god is to rule his people and to govern each individual right amen right you look at saying saint john in in the book of revelation john types the bride all right but look at him he took the book the open book after the seals have been opened he took the book from the hand of him that holds it right from the hand of the mighty angel of revelation yes not from the hand of revelation but from the hand of the mighty angel think about that lord hallelujah we're thankful that brother ben was used to the lord mightily amen amen to get our attention right and to bring to us a wonderful message amen but we cannot get the revelation of this message from brother brother right right exactly only god can impart it to you all right amen that's right amen hallelujah all right i've heard better dale's preaching brother luis he supplies me with the services here and i love i just love the way brother dale delivers uh his sermons but as good as a preacher but the daily is he cannot impart the revelation to you you can only preach the word hallelujah and it's up to god to give you a revelation amen don't look to any man right regardless hallelujah look to god for revelation all right hallelujah amen amen said you think you understand this message well that just shows that you can read right okay that's right it has to be a revelation no it's not just a confession hallelujah the way i illustrate it back home is like this like uh a man who can walk the wires you know right right right two buildings and he walks it and he has many fans knowing that he's good at it and he tells the people do you believe that i can do this yeah walk on the rope yeah are we just this thick in my hand and they all say yes we believe you and he does it he walks on the road right yeah and then he asked them again now do you believe that i can do it with somebody sitting on my shoulder oh come on bro and they all say yes we believe you're good we believe in you and the next question was well let me have a volunteer yeah nobody wants to volunteer they say they believe him they say they can actually do it but when it comes to laying their life on the line nobody wants to do it revelation is if you really believe it yeah right right you can hang your life on yours that's right let this serve as a warning in joshua chapter 6 26 after the walls of jericho came crumbling down jericho was a city that stands uh between um the people of israel and the promised land and god had to destroy that wall right yeah to the ground amen hallelujah and jericho is a type of denomination right because denomination is putting up walls right right burban said it's a carnal system that separates brotherhood you find it even in the message right people believing this claiming to believe the same thing but would not come together to fellowship and joshua adjured them and at that time saying cursed be the man before the lord that rise it up and build this city jericho he shall lay the foundation thereof in his firstborn and his youngest son shall be set up shall he shall set up shall he set up the gates of it you see god so hates this spirit of denomination come on right and he shows us in types in shadow how much god hated it yeah right he said now i have destroyed this wall of the city right yeah curse be the man before the lord that tries to build it up again right oh yeah amen right hallelujah we have been set free by the message of the hour that's right the denominational wars have been destroyed amen right that's right that's why we can feel it coming fellowship with one another hallelujah oh what a glorious thing to be set free hallelujah by the word of god hallelujah to be set free from denominational abundance right but god so hates this spirit hallelujah joshua curse joshua is the holy spirit today right curse the man that will try to build it up again but guess what in first kings chapter 16 verse 33 and 34 first kings 16 33 and 34 this is what the bible says and ahab made a growth growth and ahab did more to promote the lord god of israel to anger than all the kings of israel that were before him all right in his days did hayel the battlelight build jericho after joshua forewarned him after joshua pronounced the curse to anybody that would try to build jericho up again and here's higher the better life building jericho he lay the foundation thereof in abuyon his first son and set up the gates thereof in his youngest son according to the word of the lord which is paid by joshua the son of none right how sad how sad all right and i believe we should be on the lookout glory hallelujah right in what we call the message movement the message screw because somebody will try to raise up the walls of jericho again right hallelujah yep i feel sorry for that man that's yeah that's right hallelujah so going back to david telling nathan i will build you a house i will tell tell tell god i will build him a house hallelujah well uh in isaiah chapter 9 verse 7 it says here of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end upon the throne of david and upon his kingdom to order it and to establish it with judgment and with justice from henceforth even forever hallelujah i tried i believe god was speaking about another kingdom not the literal kingdom of david when he was here on earth hallelujah right god was referring to the kingdom of jesus christ the son of david amen amen god was referring to the church of the living god amen amen hallelujah first chronicles chapter 17 verse four let let's just read it one thing long verse 4 chapter 17 verse 4 and so nathan talked to god and here's what god had to say to nathan go and tell david my servant thus said the lord thou shalt not build me a house for i have not dwelt in a house since the day that i brought up israel unto this day but have gone from 10th to 10th and from one tabernacle to another wheresoever i have walked with all israel and speak i award to any of the judges of israel whom i command you to feed my people saying why have he not built me a house of cedars now therefore thus shalt thou say unto my servant david thus said the lord of hosts i took thee from the ship code even from following the ship hallelujah god was telling david now now david you're feeling sorry for me and you think you can help me you can do something for me you forgot where you come from hallelujah you said i took you from following the ship david was not even leading them he was following the ship that thou should be the ruler over my people israel and i have given i have been with thee whatsoever thou has walked and have cut off all thine enemies from the 40 and have made it a name like the name of the great men that are in the earth right right hallelujah david don't forget how i blessed you from zero you became a hero hallelujah first chronicles chapter 17 i'm just continuing continuing to read verse 10 and since the time that i commanded judges to be over my people israel moreover i will subdue all the enemies furthermore i tell thee that the lord will build me a house no david you can't build me a house what house will you build me that's right the heaven is my throne and the earth is my footstool right hallelujah don't you know david that the living god dwelleth not in temples made with hands this temple here think about it it's not the dwelling place of god god can grow in this temple right exactly the church is not a place where we go to come on amen we are the church we are the temple right we are the tabernacle of the living god hallelujah amen amen listen so did you don't build me a house i built your house exactly what house was was god talking about all right it is the church of the living god amen that's right hallelujah because david kingdom david's kingdom ended a long time ago right right but the church of the living god is here and will remain forever and ever glory hallelujah in hebrews chapter 10 verse 5 wherefore when he commented to the world he said sacrifice and offering thou would is not but a body right hast thou prepared for man burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin thou has no pleasure then said i lo i come in the volume of the book it's when it's written on me to do thy will of god amen and i believe this is the very essence of church yes the kingdom of god hallelujah kingdom has three elements the ruler the subjects and the actual exercise of rulership right hallelujah and the holy spirit is our king right and there's an actual exercise the subjects are under submission right to the handshape hallelujah of this king a house is actually a king kingdom yeah right a house is a kingdom in old english hallelujah and the church of the living god is a kingdom we can say christ is rain right right right now reigning upon his subjects hallelujah and one of them said the church can only know his his position right now hey you know when we quote that statement the believers they actually think you know a ranking a place in the hierarchy position of greatness it's actually a position of submission hallelujah because the body is always subject to the head right all right yeah amen hallelujah and i conduct a like a couple session in my church and we read the book of efficient where it says wives submit to your husband in everything right right and some of the sisters will come up to me and say brother does it really mean everything yeah right what if they're wrong are we obligated to submit to something that is wrong hallelujah yeah i just tell them sister the lord did not appoint you as a uh as a evaluator right you're not supposed to evaluate whether your husband is right or wrong right now your place is to submit right well there's a difference between submission yeah and agreement yeah yeah right right submission is not agreement right right right hallelujah like when the husband says honey i got some extra money here i want you to go with me to the mall we'll eat in a nice restaurant and afterwards i'm gonna buy you a new dress and a new bag handbag and the wife would say let me think i think you're right i submit how many times when you first read the bible how many times did you find things there yeah hallelujah that was contrary to our upbringing our culture our education hallelujah didn't agree with everything that we believe right nevertheless it was still the word of god right right well he first came into the message many times have we read batman making statements right but we didn't didn't believe us right that wasn't exactly right all right hallelujah but we are not to be evolvators we're not to be assessors right hallelujah our position is to submit right yeah that's right man exactly whether you can believe it or not you submit whether you think it's right or not you submit right thank you that's our position amen how many people think to submit is to show weakness yeah hallelujah but naturally inequality submission is power glory when christ submitted to the will of the father he said i can do nothing except the father shows me that's why he bypassed all the sick people in that pool right and came to this uh uh uh uh a paralytic man who was not even uh in danger of dying because that was where that was to whom the father led him right man hallelujah and afterwards he said all power both in heaven and on earth he is now delivered unto me amen why because he prayed not my will but your will be done right he was completely subverted to the will of the father hallelujah look at god he did not claim to do those miracles on his own unless he shows me i can do nothing right he said hallelujah hey man you know in that movie uh in that video uh deep color to the deep he was he kept on talking he said you know i'm waiting for something right there and then he said you see it right and then after he said he's here he said i take every spirit in this building under my control right right in the name of jesus christ you see submission is power right right submission is authority right amen hallelujah glory to god amen yes someday the bride will know his position but ben said right that's right if the bride can only know exactly position and someday she will hallelujah when is that day right right hallelujah that's right thank you jesus glory you peter was so uh excited about building churches up there building temples we read in revelation chapter 21 verse 22 and i saw no temple there for the lord god almighty and the lamb are the temple amen that's right hallelujah you the believers are the temple of god amen and the spirit of god dwells within us hallelujah that's the kingdom that god sets up for the son of david hallelujah romans chapter 8 verse 18 says for i recon that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us right that's right now listen now this is the rest of the story when the father gave his glory to the son he did not give it to another right why because the father and the son are one person amen amen now look at these verses the sufferings of this present time shall not be worth be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us amen right now hallelujah amen first corinthians chapter 2 verse 7 8 but we speak the wisdom of god in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which god ordained before the world unto our glory amen what are the seven seals for all right it's been revealed to us unto our glory oh man come on write about it we say glory to god glory to god and god says glory to you amen hallelujah which none of the princes of this world knew for have they known it they would not have crucified the lord of glory right what about ephesians 5 27 that he might present it to himself a glorious church where did the glory come from all right hallelujah definitely from god amen hallelujah that he might present to himself a glorious church not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing but that it should be holy and without blemish no wonder when jesus prayed in john chapter 12 verse 26 says if anyone serve me let him follow me and where i am there shall also my servant v talking about the lord the church if anyone served me him will my father honor amen exactly now is my soul troubled and what shall i say father save me from this hour but for this cause came i unto this hour and then he said father glorify thy name right and then there came a voice from heaven saying this is the father speaking now i have both glorified past tense and i will glorify it again i glorified my name in you because you bore my name you are my son and the father and the son bears the name of the father amen and you hallelujah born my name and i glorified that name because of the life that you manifested here on earth that's right hallelujah that's right i am glorified and i will glorify it again right amen how do we see glorified is he going to glorify it again hallelujah he glorifies him again through the church amen exactly right amen the father gives the glory to the son the son gives the glory to the church amen so sound familiar everything that god wants important to the son and everything that christ christ was important to the church of the living god amen yes sir hallelujah including all the glory and all the honor right amen look at this prayer john 17 verse 5 and now oh father glorify thou me with an own self with the glory which i have with thee before the world was the son was saying all right right give me now this glory amen because i shared it with you before the foundation of the world give me this glory now right in verse 22 it says as the glorious thou has given the glory that god gives me i have given them who the church that they may be one even as we are one i am come on brother i have glorified my name in you now i'm glorifying my name again for the second time amen in the bride amen hallelujah but did not the lord say i will not give my glory to another right amen hallelujah well we already discussed it the father and the son is the same person right now hallelujah exactly i have glorified it and will glorify it again the word glorified means to be made known to be vindicated to afford honor to be magnified to be celebrated to cause a person's dignity and work to be manifested and acknowledged hallelujah rising on the sun we are familiar with this quotation and if he being the groom the bride has to come forth because it's part of him it can only be the manifestation and the fulfilling of all revelations and the others that spoke of the bride and it can only manifest and if it does something different from the groom are you listening if the bride does something different from the groom then it isn't the bride right because she is flesh of his flesh bone of his bone life of his life power of his power he is him right amen hallelujah what kind of a grammar is this hallelujah she is him a man and a woman are one right man and the woman taken from his side he was taken from his from he has taken his spirit from defending family spirit from him and flesh from his side and made both mechanics and dynamics the wife the spirit of him and the flesh of him and put it together and made mechanics and dynamics oh my here's another it'll blow your mind it's another quotation questions and answers 1964 when jesus suffered in that body because a man and a woman are one person he was taken out of adam and the church what happened god opened up the side of adam and took out their help mate the bride and god opened up the sight of jesus at calvary and took out the bride how could jesus give his glory to the bride rabbit eight years ago because jesus and the bride are one person do you realize that when you receive a revelation of this message you actually heard from your theophany hallelujah spoke of the king theophany yeah that's christ that's the great logos the king treophony and the kingfield is made up of little theophanies right right hallelujah and we bypass that right come on but when we heard the message and we received a revelation well after we we were baptized with the holy spirit hallelujah we have what we heard from that theology we know there's a connection between us our soul and that word hallelujah how can we deny any part of that word when we are part of it all right your theophany mighty opening believers still believe together said something about the little leak of fire right it was the same little lick of fire uh on the day of pentacles you know at first they saw a big ball of fire and the next thing that happened that big ball of fire separated right itself amongst the believers 120 of them it became 120 licks of fire right and others licks of other believers licks of fire put together makes up the pillar of fire if you can only recognize who you are that's right hallelujah that you are obtained you build your day to do the greater work that's right hallelujah what's the greater works imparting eternal life is the greater words oh my god jesus could not do it in his lifetime why because the holy ghost has not been imparted exactly all right he has fallen upon the bride's lot hallelujah to do this amen second corinthians chapter five verse eight and nine it says after we've been reconciled to the world because god right after we've been reconciled to god then then he delivered unto us the same ministry of reconciliation amen that's right brother exactly that's the reason for our existence right not to make a name for ourselves not to be building camps hallelujah but to continue the work of christ amen all right listen we actually take the place of jesus christ here on earth right amen it's not the pope all right amen not the bishop hallelujah spiritual leader the church of jesus christ takes his place on earth now amen amen we are continuing to do hallelujah right what as christ was the first one to raise from all the prophets and so forth although type in many places he was the first person of those that slept right in the bright coming of christ coming out of the church there will have to be a sheep wait again in the last days amen hallelujah the name of god is glorified again in the bright coming of christ amen amen you might ask what is the bride coming of christ can't you see where we're standing it says invisible union life is in the great again what is it just exactly like the same ring that went in the ground the same jesus in bright form so jesus is on earth again right today hallelujah in what form in bright form he said same power same church same thing same word he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is what she stands for and that she can do the greater works she will be an invincible army that's right that's what you are that's right thank you you can only recognize hallelujah said the seals revealed christ right yes so as we discover more things about christ we just we discover more about ourselves right that's right amen as we know him we know ourselves all right amen hallelujah because we all if you are predestinated you all originated from him thank amen let's all stand let's just
