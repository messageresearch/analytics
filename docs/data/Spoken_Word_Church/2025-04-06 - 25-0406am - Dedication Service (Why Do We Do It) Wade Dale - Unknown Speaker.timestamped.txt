[0:00] Oh,
[0:01] I fly
[0:03] away. Oh,
[0:06] I'll I'll fly away. Oh, glory.
[0:12] I'll fly away in the
[0:16] morning. I won't die. Hallelujah. By and
[0:22] by,
[0:24] I'll fly away.
[0:29] Amen.
[0:31] Praise God again that we can come
[0:34] together to worship.
[0:36] I want to just give a little short
[0:39] testimony. Won't take but a
[0:42] minute. Friday night I I started off to
[0:46] the store and when I got to where I was
[0:49] going, the traffic was so heavy I
[0:50] couldn't get around good. So I decided
[0:53] to take a side road. And when I
[0:56] did make the turn to turn around, I hit
[0:59] a curb and bust the tie.
[1:04] And soon as I got back to a safe place,
[1:08] I stopped. A guy came by and said, "Uh,
[1:12] need some help." Yeah. So, he got out
[1:16] and changed his tie for
[1:17] me. Took the Amen. tie off and put the
[1:22] spare
[1:23] on. And then he said, "You you look like
[1:27] you're about 14." I said, "Well, thank
[1:30] you
[1:31] anyway." And he said,
[1:33] "Uh, and I told him the next said the
[1:36] next day is my birthday." We were
[1:38] talking. He said, "Uh, we're here. Take
[1:41] this $10 for your
[1:43] birthday." So, just thank the Lord
[1:47] somebody for so gracious. Amen. Amen.
[1:50] Amen. Remember me in prayer.
[1:53] Amen. We're going
[1:55] to read this morning from Psalm 105
[2:00] vers 1 through
[2:03] 14. Let us pray.
[2:07] Heavenly Father, we're ever grateful and
[2:09] thankful unto you, Lord, for all that
[2:11] you do, God. You have brought us this
[2:14] far, Lord, and we're going to follow on
[2:16] after you, hold on to your unchanging
[2:18] hand. Lord, you love us and we know that
[2:21] you have given us many things, Lord,
[2:24] that we didn't deserve, but Father,
[2:26] because your love unto us, we ask you
[2:29] this morning to come into the
[2:31] congregation, Lord, touch every heart,
[2:33] Father, stir it, that it may see your
[2:36] blessing, power moving among us. God, we
[2:39] know that this is in late late hour that
[2:42] Satan is raging, but God, you are still
[2:45] loving us and we thank you in Jesus name
[2:47] we pray. Amen.
[2:54] Psalm
[2:55] 105 verses
[2:58] 1-14. Oh, give thanks unto the Lord.
[3:01] Call upon his name. Make known his deeds
[3:05] among the people.
[3:07] Sing unto him, sing songs unto him. Talk
[3:11] ye of all his wondous works. Glory ye in
[3:16] his holy name. Let the heart of them
[3:19] rejoice that seek the Lord.
[3:22] Seek the Lord and his strength. Seek his
[3:25] face ever more.
[3:27] Remember his marvelous works that he has
[3:30] done. His wonders and judgments are his
[3:34] mouth.
[3:36] Oh ye seed of Abraham his servant, ye
[3:39] children of Jacob his chosen.
[3:43] He is the Lord our God. His judgments
[3:46] are in all the earth.
[3:49] He hath remembered his covenant forever,
[3:52] the word which he commanded to a
[3:55] thousand generations.
[3:57] which covenant he made with Abraham, and
[4:00] his oath unto Isaac,
[4:03] and confirmed the same unto Jacob for a
[4:06] law, and to Israel for an everlasting
[4:10] covenant, saying, Unto thee will I give
[4:13] the land of Cana, the lot of your
[4:17] inheritance.
[4:20] Few men in number, yay, very few, and
[4:24] strangers.
[4:26] When they went from one nation to
[4:29] another, from one kingdom to another
[4:33] people, he suffered no man to do them
[4:36] wrong. Yay, he brought
[4:41] Amen. Amen. God bless you. May be
[4:43] seated.
[5:00] Amen. We appreciate that testimony,
[5:02] brother Collie. I tell you, um, Lord,
[5:05] he's a present help in the time of need.
[5:07] Reminded me of the good Samaritan
[5:09] testimony and or the story in the Bible.
[5:12] And um cuz you remember this uh the good
[5:15] Samaritan he helped the person in the
[5:17] time of need then he paid uh gave some
[5:20] money to help him continue to help. So
[5:22] God has people all around us. You just
[5:25] look to him. He knows when you need help
[5:27] and can protect you and bring um who he
[5:32] needs on the scene uh for that. So let's
[5:35] um let's sing that song. The more I
[5:39] surrender. Amen. You know, I don't know
[5:43] if it's just the way the Lord is lead
[5:45] leading this morning, but um the way uh
[5:48] brother Louise again, he's just talking
[5:50] about preeminence. And um I don't know
[5:53] if anyone's noticed years ago, Brother
[5:55] Dell, he he preached on God being
[5:59] preeminent in your life. And there was
[6:01] there's a quote that Brother Brham said
[6:03] in Christ, the mystery of God revealed
[6:06] that sermon. And it was such a um maybe
[6:09] it was just so impactful to the to the
[6:12] people at that time. We put it on the
[6:14] back of the wall back there. And uh
[6:17] maybe sometimes when when you have time
[6:19] just go read that. Um, it it really is
[6:22] what each believer's desire. Each
[6:24] Christian should want is what God is
[6:28] trying to pour into you
[6:30] himself, his will, his mind, his
[6:33] thoughts, his nature, his love, his
[6:35] desires. And uh the more we surrender,
[6:39] we don't have to fight it. A lot of
[6:40] times I'm guilty. We all fight it a lot
[6:42] of times. Um, but when it comes down to
[6:45] it, we just open our heart and say,
[6:47] "Lord, the more I surrender, the lighter
[6:49] my load." We're here for a moment, a
[6:53] vapor, but we're here to do his will.
[6:55] Amen. Hallelujah. Let's sing this
[7:02] together. Just let this be your prayer
[7:04] this morning.
[7:11] Oh, the more that I
[7:16] surrender, the
[7:19] lighter my Lord.
[7:23] The more that I release my cares, oh,
[7:29] the more you take
[7:34] control. The more that I can humble
[7:39] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[7:45] every day I
[7:48] live, Lord, I love you more. Oh, just
[7:53] sing it to him
[7:55] again. Oh, the more that I
[8:02] surrender, the
[8:04] lighter my Lord.
[8:08] The more that I release my
[8:13] cares, the more you take
[8:18] control, the more that I can humble
[8:24] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[8:29] every day I
[8:32] live, Lord, I love you
[8:36] [Music]
[8:39] more. And it gets
[8:42] easier to
[8:45] understand this road I'm traveling
[8:50] down. Oh, no more
[8:53] wering and
[8:56] wondering. I'm standing on solid
[9:01] ground. And I know I'm headed to my
[9:06] future home. And the voice I hear is
[9:11] yours alone. Every day I
[9:16] live. Lord, I love. Oh, just tell him
[9:19] how much you love him this morning.
[9:23] Oh, the more that I
[9:29] surrender, the
[9:31] lighter my Lord.
[9:35] And the more that I release my cares,
[9:40] Lord, the more you take
[9:45] control. The more that I can humble
[9:51] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[9:56] every day I live.
[10:00] Lord, I love you
[10:02] [Music]
[10:06] more. And the problems I had on
[10:12] yesterday are a step in stone to a
[10:16] higher place. The trials that seem so
[10:21] awesome to me are now my better of
[10:27] victory.
[10:29] And I know I'm headed to a future home.
[10:34] And the voice I
[10:37] hear always is his alone. Every day I
[10:42] live. Lord, I love you more.
[10:49] Oh, the more that I
[10:55] surrender, the
[10:57] lighter, my
[11:00] Lord. The more that I release my cares,
[11:06] Lord, the more you take control.
[11:12] The more that I can humble
[11:16] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[11:22] every day I
[11:25] live. Lord, I love. Let's just all stand
[11:28] and worship him this morning.
[11:31] Oh, more than I the more than I
[11:38] surrender, the
[11:40] lighter my
[11:43] Lord. The more that I release my cares,
[11:49] the more you take control.
[11:54] The more that
[11:56] I humble
[11:59] myself, the more you lift me up. And
[12:04] every day I
[12:07] live. Lord, I love you more.

[12:57] Lord. Oh, word of
[13:01] God. Ever true is change in me is change
[13:08] in you.
[13:10] We have come with God
[13:14] and the word of God in
[13:19] part and holy
[13:22] words of our faith is handed
[13:27] down to this age. It came to us through
[13:33] sacrifice.
[13:35] Oh, heed the faithful words of

[13:57] the word of God. Sing it from your heart
[14:00] today.
[14:01] Oh, word of God is ever true. It'll
[14:05] never fail you. It'll never lie.
[14:10] It'll always help you. It's always
[14:12] positive.

[14:43] Amen. It'll never fail you. It's always

[14:49] help you. The only time it doesn't help
[14:51] you is when you don't read
[14:53] it. Hello, somebody. when you don't read
[14:56] it. We can read everything else. As I uh
[15:00] we were talking u last Sunday, you can
[15:03] read all these self-help books you want
[15:04] to. This is the best self-help book
[15:06] there ever was. And it's eternal. It'll
[15:10] give you an eternal quality that them
[15:12] other things can. We like it's okay,
[15:13] Dave Ramsey and all the different ones.
[15:15] That's all right. That's
[15:17] okay. But not the eternal word of God.
[15:20] The eternal word of God will never fail
[15:22] you. It'll never leave you. nor will it
[15:25] forsake you. Good to be in the house of
[15:27] the Lord. Good to have everybody here.
[15:28] We know we're here for a couple of
[15:30] things. We're here for a dedication
[15:31] service. Also here for a baptism and
[15:34] then also for
[15:37] um something about a birthday. I don't
[15:39] know whose birthday that is,
[15:41] but I think it's my
[15:47] sweethearts. Keep it
[15:50] down. But yesterday we had a good time.
[15:54] Uh y'all go ahead and be seated. We're
[15:55] going to we're going to do this uh at
[15:58] first. But yesterday we had a good time.
[16:01] Uh for those of you that didn't come to
[16:02] the house, uh we had a good time of
[16:04] shooting and and instructions and um we
[16:08] found out that Levi and Jonas will be
[16:11] entering law
[16:12] enforcement and don't ever make them
[16:15] mad cuz they shoot the eyes out of that
[16:17] target. But the instructor was there and
[16:20] he actually helped a lot of people. you
[16:22] can see the people develop into better
[16:24] shooters. And uh we're going to be doing
[16:26] it again uh Lord willing next Sunday
[16:30] afternoon. So at my house at 4:00 next
[16:33] Sunday afternoon, my house at 4:00 and
[16:36] we'll uh we'll have water and and drinks
[16:40] and um you can eat grass or
[16:43] something, chew on chew on a stick.
[16:47] But we had a really good time and we
[16:49] appreciate the uh Mike coming and and
[16:51] helping us out. And some of you have
[16:53] some of you have expressed interest to
[16:56] continue the shooting part. So we'll do
[16:58] that next Sunday 4:00, Lord willing. And
[17:01] we did it yesterday because at 1:00 it's
[17:03] supposed to come thunderstorms. So we
[17:05] weren't going to be able to do that. But
[17:07] we sure do appreciate you. Thank you for
[17:09] uh being here with Brother David last
[17:11] Sunday. uh we were at the Methodist
[17:13] church and and uh spoke to them um for a
[17:16] little while and and had a good time in
[17:18] the Lord there. So, we appreciate the
[17:20] Lord being with us. Also, Brother Daniel
[17:24] Martinez will be speaking for us on
[17:26] Wednesday
[17:28] night. Always good to have brother
[17:30] Daniel here. Like every time he comes,
[17:33] but if he didn't leave, he wouldn't have
[17:35] to be
[17:37] anyway. Yeah.
[17:39] Next Sunday we'll have communion and
[17:42] footwashing. Should be today, but we got
[17:44] all this going on. We'll do it next
[17:46] Sunday. Um, good to see sister Tarcilla
[17:50] here with us today all the way from
[17:52] Kenya,
[17:55] Georgia, the country of Kenya. But good
[17:58] to have her with us and she's going to
[17:59] be with us for a little bit. That's
[18:01] sister uh Anna's mom and sister
[18:04] Rebecca's mom. So good to have them and
[18:06] always good to have Steve and and uh Amy
[18:09] with us and and I forget the young
[18:12] girl's name but she knows who it
[18:16] is. Elbert Hubard said, "God will not
[18:18] look you over for medals, degrees, or
[18:21] diplomas, but for
[18:24] scars." But for
[18:27] scars. The great thing to remember is
[18:29] that though our feelings come and go,
[18:30] God's love does not come and go. It
[18:34] never waivers. Our faith waivers. Our
[18:37] love waivers. But God's love is eternal.
[18:40] And he can't change his mind. If he ever
[18:41] loved you before the foundation of the
[18:43] world, he still loves you. There's not a
[18:46] day in the world that God's not going to
[18:47] love you. There's days in the there's
[18:50] times that we think he's gone and left
[18:52] us, but it's just child training. It's
[18:54] just helping us to grow up and not be a
[18:56] spoiled child, not be a spoiled brat.
[18:59] So, as we get started today, we're going
[19:01] to speak actually on a dedication
[19:03] service. why we do it. A lot of times we
[19:05] have these these things and sometimes
[19:07] they become rituals, but they're not
[19:09] rituals. They're for a Christian to be a
[19:12] whole Christian. There's things we have
[19:15] to do that are different from the world.
[19:18] Okay? We believe in the Bible. We
[19:21] believe in scripture. We believe that
[19:22] Jesus Christ was the son of God. We
[19:24] believe that he is God, was God, and
[19:27] always will be God. And we believe also
[19:30] in baby dedications. We do not believe
[19:32] in ba baby baptism. And I'll cover that
[19:34] today where the word of God tells us
[19:37] that in just a few minutes. So, if
[19:39] they'll come on up, we will uh we'll
[19:43] dedicate our little one. Um
[19:47] family, all the
[19:51] family, come on
[19:53] up and we will
[19:58] uh are you going to be able to pull that
[20:00] up on the screen with me plugged
[20:02] in? Just come on
[20:09] up. Yeah, I will. I
[20:13] will. All right. All right. So, this is
[20:15] the newest addition to the family
[20:18] and we sure do appreciate them.
[20:23] Let's go ahead and
[20:25] sing. Bring them in before we get
[20:27] started. Bring them
[20:30] in. Bring them
[20:34] in. Bring them in from the field of
[20:40] sin. Bring them in.
[20:45] Bring them
[20:47] in. Bring the little ones to
[20:51] [Music]
[20:53] Jesus.
[20:55] Amen. Well, we got up on the screen
[20:57] here. This is
[20:59] uh Which one is that? Is that Hudson?
[21:02] That's u dad dedicating Hudson. And then
[21:06] dad dedicating. That was one of the last
[21:08] ones he dedicated
[21:10] um before he passed away. So,
[21:13] um, that's little. Where'd she go?
[21:17] Pooky, where you?
[21:19] Oh, you got your little
[21:21] blankie. We love them and appreciate
[21:24] them. Good to have you here. Good to
[21:26] have you here to uh to do this. And uh,
[21:29] if you can see this, I'll put the camera
[21:31] on it. That my mom made this dress. No.
[21:34] Who made it? Nobody made it. Abby wore
[21:37] it.
[21:39] Anna wore it. You believe that?
[21:42] How many? 50 something years a boy. Uh,
[21:46] okay. And Abby wore it. Okay. What now?
[21:54] H the
[21:56] what? Yeah, I know. That's what I said.
[22:00] Yeah, that's what I said. That's Poke
[22:02] and that's um Hudson. And they've all
[22:05] grown
[22:06] up. Let me have a baby.
[22:14] Okay, it's
[22:16] okay. This
[22:18] is Emerson Dean Dale and we're going to
[22:23] dedicate her to the Lord and then um
[22:26] today we'll sit down and we will um go
[22:30] over why we do this. And it's very
[22:31] important and I'll I'll speak some about
[22:35] it. But as brother Dale always said,
[22:37] this baby is is he's she's a
[22:41] Dale, but she's also a member of the
[22:44] church. So you, the church family,
[22:46] living in front of them as well, and
[22:49] that's your commission. We'll talk a
[22:51] little bit about that in just a little
[22:53] bit. So let's bow our
[22:55] heads. Let's give this little baby back
[22:57] to the
[23:00] Lord. To heavenly father, we stand
[23:02] today.
[23:04] Lord, with a child that's so innocent
[23:07] and
[23:08] pure, heart so
[23:11] right, has no evil
[23:13] thought, has no
[23:15] sin. Although she was born in sin, Lord,
[23:19] you made a way when you came and died at
[23:22] Calvary, you died for the little
[23:26] babies. And they don't have a chance
[23:28] maybe to to ask you to forgive them,
[23:31] Lord, until they get older. And father,
[23:33] I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus
[23:35] that you'll we dedicate this little
[23:37] Emerson Dean
[23:38] Dale back to you, Father. We're going to
[23:41] give them back to the family. But Lord,
[23:42] it's not going to end there. Lord, I
[23:45] pray that they'll raise her in the
[23:47] admonition of the Lord and that these
[23:50] things will be done for your honor and
[23:51] glory. Lord, in Jesus name we pray.
[23:54] Amen. God bless you.
[23:59] Bring them
[24:02] in. Bring them
[24:05] in. Bring them in from the field of
[24:12] sin. Bring them
[24:15] in. Bring them
[24:18] in. Bring the little ones to
[24:24] Jesus. Amen. Let's stand to our feet. We
[24:29] kind of be a little bit out of the norm
[24:30] today. I knew we'd have uh nobody's a
[24:33] visitor, but uh we would just kind of
[24:37] explain some things today. We we're
[24:39] going to explain a little bit to with uh
[24:42] again about water baptism because we're
[24:44] going to have a baptismal service.
[24:46] Brother Joseph's going to be baptized in
[24:47] the name of the Lord Jesus. But we'll
[24:50] talk today a little bit about why we do
[24:52] these things. We don't do them, you
[24:54] know, um nothing against Catholic doc,
[24:58] Catholic doctrine or anything else. It's
[25:01] just that when they come and bring a
[25:03] ritual, that just becomes a ritual and
[25:04] you just you just do the you know, you
[25:06] just do the thing. I
[25:09] u I don't like
[25:12] programs. Um there is a method of
[25:16] worship, but it should be the leading of
[25:18] the Lord, not the leading of a piece of
[25:20] paper. And I know we do have to have
[25:23] structure here. We do have to have
[25:25] certain songs that we need to sing and
[25:26] all these things. But if the spirit of
[25:28] the Lord has our me has our song leaders
[25:32] to go in a different direction, then
[25:35] remember he's perfect. We're not. So if
[25:38] he comes on the scene and changes
[25:39] something, even a sermon, praise God for
[25:42] that. That means he's among us. He's
[25:44] doing the work and somebody needs it.
[25:47] All right. So let's go to Matthew
[25:51] 19:E13 and let's start there. All minds
[25:55] clear. Just remember the announcements
[25:59] um that we'll have a baptismal service
[26:02] immediately following this service.
[26:05] We'll go down to the baptismal pool and
[26:07] then we'll have a um a birthday uh
[26:10] celebration for Jim. She's her
[26:12] birthday's on the 10th. You heard Ryan
[26:14] say that, but we're going to do it
[26:15] today. And uh then next Sunday we'll
[26:19] have foot wash and communion and then
[26:21] we'll shoot my house up. As Ryan
[26:24] said, they kept they kept shooting
[26:27] yesterday and they kept banging it off
[26:29] of the
[26:30] um the wires where the not where the
[26:33] cows are, but you know, barb wire.
[26:35] Finally, they they broke it in half. So
[26:38] that's good. You got to destroy
[26:39] something when you start shooting. I
[26:40] mean, it's just just the way it is. So,
[26:44] but you're all invited if uh next Sunday
[26:47] uh just remember if you've already done
[26:48] it, then probably you won't get to
[26:50] shoot, but you can stand in the
[26:52] background and we can just have some
[26:53] good fellowship. So, Matthew 19:13,
[26:56] let's bow our heads. Lord, forgive us of
[26:58] our sins and many mistakes. First off,
[27:00] Lord, cleanse us. Lord, let us be as
[27:03] you're going to tell us. Let us be as
[27:05] that little child. Lord, be innocent and
[27:09] Lord, be available. make oursel
[27:12] available, Lord, for you to come on the
[27:14] scene, Lord, and speak to each and every
[27:16] heart here, Lord. That's the purpose of
[27:18] us coming, not just to sit here and look
[27:20] over at each other and and and all and
[27:23] even look up here, Lord, but to hear
[27:25] your voice and let it be the word of God
[27:28] spoken by lips of clay, but it may it
[27:31] come from your very thought that you had
[27:33] before the foundation of the world.
[27:35] Father, forgive us, Lord, if we say
[27:38] something maybe that somebody don't
[27:39] like, but we sure appreciate everybody
[27:42] being here. We appreciate the ones,
[27:44] Lord. Bless the ones that are sick.
[27:45] Brother Bob, Lord, being down at uh
[27:47] checking on his grandbaby visit for the
[27:50] first time there in South Carolina.
[27:52] Lord, I pray that you give them
[27:53] traveling mercies. Be with each one
[27:55] that's not here, Lord. Father, I pray
[27:56] that you'd bless us now in Jesus name.
[27:59] Amen. God bless you. Matthew
[28:03] 19:13. Then there were brought unto him
[28:06] little children. This is talking about
[28:08] Jesus now. That he should put his hands
[28:10] on them and pray. And the disciples
[28:13] rebuked them. But Jesus said, "Suffer
[28:16] little children and forbid them not to
[28:19] come unto
[28:20] me, for of such is the kingdom of
[28:24] heaven." And he laid his hands on them
[28:27] and departed. Then you may be seated.
[28:29] The Lord had his blessing. We'll go
[28:30] again to Matthew
[28:33] 18:1. try not to be uh and they went
[28:37] some of them that went with me to the
[28:38] Methodist church last Sunday, I told
[28:40] them, "Forget it. I wasn't just going to
[28:41] preach 35 minutes ever again." So, but
[28:45] anyway, don't get used to it. Matthew
[28:48] 18:1 says, "At the same time, the
[28:50] disciples came unto Jesus came disciples
[28:53] to Jesus saying, "Who is the greatest in
[28:55] the kingdom of heaven?" And Jesus called
[28:57] a little child unto him and set him in
[28:59] the midst of them and said, "Boy, oh my,
[29:02] could you imagine if that child knew
[29:03] what he was what what was going on? If
[29:06] that little child realized that he was
[29:08] he was standing in the hands of the
[29:10] creator, standing in the hands of the
[29:12] one that was going to save his soul when
[29:14] he got older."
[29:17] Wow. Jesus called the little child and
[29:19] said unto him, set him in front of him
[29:21] and said, "Verily I say unto you, except
[29:23] you be converted." Now watch. Except you
[29:25] be
[29:26] converted and become as a little child,
[29:29] you shall not enter into the kingdom of
[29:31] heaven. Who so therefore shall humble
[29:34] himself as a little child. Now that
[29:37] includes all us old ones, humble oursel
[29:39] as a little child, the same as the
[29:41] greatest in the kingdom of heaven. Now
[29:45] watch. And who so shall receive one such
[29:48] little child? Now look, he said in my
[29:51] name receiveth
[29:53] me. But whosoever shall offend one of
[29:56] these little ones which believe in me,
[30:00] it were better for him that a millstone
[30:02] were hanged around his neck and he were
[30:03] drowned in the depths of the sea.
[30:07] Amen. That's pretty real. That's Jesus
[30:11] talking. That ain't that ain't an
[30:12] interpretation. That's exactly what he
[30:14] said. He said it'd be better what? for a
[30:16] millstone to be hanged around the
[30:18] person's neck and they remember Job even
[30:21] said one time he said oh I wish I wasn't
[30:22] even born I just wished I wasn't born
[30:25] that all these things are going on but
[30:26] you know
[30:27] what Job got a revelation one day though
[30:30] and he said I know that my redeemer
[30:33] liveth and he said in the last days I'll
[30:37] stand on this earth and in my flesh I
[30:41] shall see
[30:42] God so what a great thing Technology is
[30:56] not. So
[30:59] anyway, let's stand. We'll
[31:03] dismiss. I just Well, you know, Anderson
[31:06] was back there trying to help me with
[31:08] the uh the printer a minute ago and and
[31:12] uh he just unplugged it. plugged it back
[31:15] in, started working. So before you call
[31:18] a technician at hundred and something
[31:20] dollars an
[31:21] hour, unplug the thing and then plug it
[31:23] right back in. All right, give it a
[31:25] minute to boot up and then plug it back
[31:27] in because that's probably going to be
[31:28] your biggest
[31:29] problem. So now here we go. So now we
[31:33] look and we see that that we've had a
[31:35] baby
[31:36] dedication. And the way I want you to
[31:38] look at this, I want you to see that as
[31:40] dad's always said that we dedicate
[31:43] babies here and give them to the parents
[31:45] obviously, but we also give them to each
[31:47] one of us to live it before them.
[31:51] Now, you can say what you will, but a
[31:55] true Christian does not act like the
[31:59] world. A true Christian is separate from
[32:01] the world. Jesus was separate from the
[32:04] world. Listen, they hated him.
[32:08] They hated their very savior because he
[32:11] was not normal. He wasn't of their
[32:16] quality. But he was a creator of the
[32:18] world and they missed it. Could we be
[32:22] missing it now because of our ideas?
[32:24] Could we be missing it because of our
[32:26] doctrinal issues that as I was telling
[32:28] some of the the Methodists, you know,
[32:31] they they sprinkle. And I said, "Your
[32:34] founder didn't do that.
[32:36] I didn't tell them from the pull pit. I
[32:37] just told a couple guys there. I said,
[32:39] "Your founder did not
[32:41] sprinkle." John Wesley believed in water
[32:46] baptismo. Amen. Is everybody with me? So
[32:49] who who so
[32:50] who told them they could do
[32:53] that? There's only two forces in this
[32:56] world. God and the devil. God can't lie.
[33:00] God can't change his word. So you figure
[33:02] out who the other guy was.
[33:05] And we'll talk about that in just a
[33:07] minute. But the dedication part, I was
[33:11] thinking yesterday of all the and I I
[33:13] was part of it
[33:15] myself. We come and brought Josh and
[33:17] Hannah basically the same way here to be
[33:21] dedicated and then
[33:23] sadly we didn't live the life in front
[33:25] of
[33:27] them. Sadly we've dedicated many people
[33:30] here.
[33:32] Many children have been dedicated here
[33:35] and their parents not show up
[33:38] again.
[33:40] Now the kid's not going to be held
[33:43] responsible, innocent, don't have a bad
[33:47] thought, can't sin like you and I can
[33:49] sin because we know better. They don't
[33:53] know better. Not until they get to the
[33:55] age of accountability, to the age where
[33:57] they know that they're doing something
[33:59] wrong. They know they're sinning. and
[34:01] they know they're doing something
[34:03] against or contrary to the word of
[34:06] God. But here I want to tell you that if
[34:09] we're commissioned to do that, then
[34:12] until you get yourself
[34:18] right, how you going to expect the kid
[34:20] to be right? I'm just going to preach
[34:22] family today. Is that all
[34:24] right? Because I want to tell you about
[34:26] a a woman here in the Bible.
[34:30] I want you to see and it's it's it's
[34:31] kind of strange that her name was Hannah
[34:33] and that was my grandma's name and she
[34:35] had a son in her old name old age named
[34:38] Samuel and that was dad's name was
[34:40] Samuel and granny was 42 when dad was
[34:43] born I think his dad was in his 60s so
[34:46] um let's look at 1st Samuel 1 verse one
[34:50] and let's look and see what kind of
[34:51] dedication we've we have as Christians
[34:55] now not as Christians remember the Jesus
[34:58] said who believe in my name who believe
[35:01] in me. All right? So, if you don't
[35:04] believe that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[35:06] your savior, how you going to get your
[35:07] kids to do the same thing? And we've
[35:09] seen many times before now, not here,
[35:11] but in the denominational world, they'll
[35:13] drop the kids off to Sunday school and
[35:15] then mom and dad goes and, you know,
[35:17] does whatever the they're just that's
[35:19] just a babysitter for
[35:20] them because when they get back home,
[35:22] they're going to hear the cussing, the
[35:24] swearing, the I ain't going to church
[35:25] and I don't love you no more. And you
[35:27] understand what I'm saying? I want I
[35:29] hope you do because when we dedicate a
[35:31] baby, it's not just we put them in a we
[35:34] put them in a capsule and say, "Well,
[35:36] they're taken care of, but I'm going to
[35:39] go live anyway I want
[35:42] to." Then you then you fuss at the kids.
[35:46] I've already always told you, and I know
[35:48] we don't believe in Santa Claus here,
[35:50] but
[35:51] uh we don't beat him up about it. We
[35:54] just tell them the
[35:55] truth that there's a man that'll save
[35:57] your soul, not give you a gift and his
[36:00] name's the Lord Jesus and he don't wear
[36:01] a red
[36:03] suit. But how many of you don't raise
[36:06] your hand cuz it'll be
[36:08] 100%. Taught your kids there was a Santa
[36:10] Claus at about 5 years old, four years
[36:12] old, three years old. I know some of you
[36:15] didn't. But you still got caught into
[36:17] that influence.
[36:20] You lied to
[36:21] them. And you expect them to tell the
[36:25] truth. You whipped them for lying.
[36:28] Somebody ought to have whipped
[36:35] you. I'm going to preach
[36:37] anyway. But it's the
[36:40] truth. That's why and and the whole
[36:42] pretense of this sermon is that is we're
[36:45] not going to just This is an event. This
[36:48] was an event this morning and we looked
[36:50] back on the events and we look look back
[36:52] on the pictures that we we pull up and
[36:55] and certain ones that are being
[36:57] dedicated you never see them
[36:59] again. Well, what have we
[37:01] dedicated? We've dedicated them to the
[37:04] Lord but dedicated you to raise them
[37:07] parents and then for us as a church. But
[37:10] now us as a church, we're not obligated
[37:12] to help you raise your kid if you don't
[37:14] bring it to church.
[37:16] We're not obligated to go in your home
[37:18] and try to change your home. You got to
[37:20] change your home. The first home you got
[37:22] to change is this
[37:23] one. You got to change this home first.
[37:27] When you change this home, the kids will
[37:29] see a
[37:33] difference. So, there was a lady, her
[37:36] name was
[37:37] Hannah. Let's read about her story here
[37:40] real quick. Now there was a certain man
[37:42] of you can pronounce that of Mount
[37:44] Ephereim and his name was Elcana and the
[37:47] son of Jehoam the son of Elahu the son
[37:50] of Tou the son of Ze and Ephriotite and
[37:53] he had two wives the name of one was
[37:55] Hannah name of the other was Penaniah
[37:58] and Penaniah had children but Hannah had
[38:01] no
[38:02] children and this man went up out of his
[38:04] city yearly to worship and sacrifice to
[38:07] the Lord. Remember what did he do? He
[38:08] did the things he was supposed to do. He
[38:11] did all the sacrifices back then. There
[38:14] was no Lord Jesus Christ as as a savior
[38:16] yet. They looked to Jehovah, somebody
[38:19] they didn't understand a lot of the
[38:21] times, but they understood that Moses
[38:23] saw him and they had a law and they
[38:26] lived under that law. And as long as
[38:28] they made sacrifices, everything was
[38:30] okay. But remember, the ultimate
[38:32] sacrifice had not been made yet. All
[38:34] right? The Lord Jesus had not died. And
[38:37] this man went out of his city to worship
[38:39] and to sacrifice unto the Lord of hosts
[38:41] in Shiloh. And the two sons of Eli,
[38:43] Hopnne and
[38:44] Phineas, the priest of the Lord were
[38:48] there. When the time was that Elen
[38:51] offered, he gave to Panih his wife, and
[38:54] to all her sons and daughters portions.
[38:57] Now watch. But unto Hannah he gave a
[39:00] worthy portion, for he loved Hannah. It
[39:03] didn't change that she didn't have
[39:04] children yet. He still loved her. What
[39:07] am I saying is you got to bring love
[39:09] into your family first. You got to bring
[39:12] the love of husband and wife in first
[39:14] into your family. Make your sacrifices.
[39:16] Do your daily offerings. I'm talking
[39:18] about your daily
[39:21] offering. But unto Hannah he gave a
[39:23] worthy portion for he loved Hannah. But
[39:25] the Lord had shut up her womb.
[39:27] And her adversary, now watch, also
[39:30] provoked her sore for to make her fret
[39:33] because the Lord had shut up her
[39:37] womb. You and
[39:39] I have to live so that the world can
[39:44] tell we're
[39:46] different. The Bible compels us. The
[39:50] Lord Jesus compels us. Everything in
[39:53] scripture compels us to live different
[39:55] and look different and act different
[39:58] from the
[39:59] world. Everybody with
[40:04] me? My granddaughter slipped in the
[40:07] door. Is that Ellie with you? Hey
[40:10] Ellie, God bless you. You missed a
[40:17] dedication. But we're compelled to be
[40:19] different. So, so a baby dedication to
[40:21] me is different than just somebody
[40:22] bringing them up and like they do in
[40:23] different places. Even the Methodist
[40:25] church, they have a christening or a
[40:27] sprinkling of the water on the on the
[40:29] baby's head. But that's not according to
[40:31] scripture. There is no scripture that
[40:33] says you're you're not supposed to
[40:34] baptize them. But the only thing was is
[40:37] the disciples were getting a little ill
[40:38] with Jesus and or the people because the
[40:41] children were running around. Dad's
[40:43] always said, and I say 100%. Kids
[40:46] crying, kids going out with their
[40:48] parents to use the bathroom or to eat a
[40:51] little bite of
[40:53] something. Oh, for those of you that
[40:54] went last Sunday, we are not bringing
[40:56] donuts into this
[40:59] sanctuary.
[41:03] Ever. This is the house of
[41:06] God. It's not a place that we just come
[41:08] like a lodge. We come here to just sit
[41:11] down and eat and drink in this
[41:12] sanctuary. That's
[41:14] garbage. Sorry. That's the only way
[41:16] those people have been taught though. So
[41:17] that's the way they did it. Um I believe
[41:21] that you need to put on your best, be
[41:22] your best. If you're going to come to
[41:24] church and see God, if you're going to
[41:26] just come to church to see somebody
[41:27] else, then you know, you need to stay
[41:29] home. You can Amen. Thank
[41:33] you. I know this is simple, but
[41:35] sometimes we need to all be kind of
[41:37] reminded of of these things.
[41:41] But it is a place for us to come. Do you
[41:44] know if you walked into a church,
[41:47] church, tabernacle, sanctuary, whatever
[41:50] it was in the Old
[41:52] Testament, if that high priest didn't
[41:54] have on the exact attire, if they
[41:57] weren't covered in oil, if they didn't
[41:59] walk the right way, put on the right,
[42:01] you say, "Well, it don't matter what I
[42:03] wear." Well, if he wore a blue and
[42:04] should have wore red, he
[42:06] died. You know, they tied ropes around
[42:09] the the high priest because they
[42:11] couldn't go in there. But if they if he
[42:13] fell over dead and did something wrong,
[42:15] they could drag him
[42:16] out. If that happened
[42:19] here, how serious are
[42:23] we? That's why we don't have dos and
[42:26] don'ts here. We
[42:28] don't. But the Bible says, "Dress
[42:31] modest. Be
[42:33] different. Women be women, men be men.
[42:37] But if we come in this house, watch it
[42:40] as he did so year by
[42:44] year. So he did it. He come to church.
[42:46] He did his service to God even though as
[42:50] yet Samuel had not been born
[42:52] yet. Everybody with me? Samuel was not
[42:56] born yet because he come through Hannah
[42:57] and God shut her womb
[43:01] up to give you the opportunity to see
[43:04] what's going on today.
[43:07] Word of God ever
[43:09] true. It was written for us. Bible says
[43:12] it was written for our admonition whom
[43:14] the ends of the world have come
[43:16] upon. And he did so year by year. When
[43:18] she went up to the house of the Lord, so
[43:21] she provoked her, therefore she wept and
[43:23] did not eat. In other words, her
[43:24] adversaries were
[43:27] women. So she provoked her, therefore
[43:30] she wept and did not eat. Then said
[43:32] Elcana her husband to her Hannah, "Why
[43:34] weepest thou? And why eatest thou not?
[43:37] And why is thy heart
[43:39] grieved?" Now today as as we we see
[43:43] that have we ever done that before? Have
[43:46] we ever fasted and and just did without
[43:48] something just to try to get before the
[43:50] Lord? And today coming to this
[43:52] dedication service, I want it to be when
[43:55] you leave here, it was a dedication of
[43:58] you, not of so much of the
[44:00] baby because we've sheltered the child.
[44:04] The child has been sheltered in the arms
[44:05] of God until the age of accountability.
[44:07] But most of us sitting here today are
[44:09] past that
[44:11] point several times
[44:15] over, lest we
[44:18] forget our age.
[44:22] But then you and I then now need to
[44:24] dedicate
[44:25] oursel. We've had dedications. We've had
[44:28] rededications. We've dedicated the
[44:30] building again. We've dedicated each
[44:31] other. We've we've had ma marriage
[44:33] renewal vows. And that's good. That's
[44:37] wonderful. I was thinking this
[44:39] morning, how many people I'm just going
[44:42] to preach. How many people stand before
[44:46] they want to do it either in a church or
[44:47] a venue and they want to dress up and
[44:51] they want to stand before a
[44:55] preacher, somebody you're not supposed
[44:56] to lie
[44:58] to. They stand before a preacher and
[45:00] say, "Hey, read these
[45:03] vows. For richer, for poorer, in
[45:06] sickness and in health, till death do us
[45:11] part." and five years later they're
[45:14] divorced. Somebody lied. You know what
[45:17] the problem was? They didn't bring that
[45:18] third person in into them into the
[45:22] situation. They didn't bring that third
[45:24] person in. They didn't bring Jesus
[45:25] Christ with them when they come up here
[45:27] or you won't get a divorce. If you have
[45:28] Jesus Christ in your heart, you can't
[45:29] divorce. You might have
[45:32] problems. And the men say and the
[45:35] sisters
[45:36] say they're louder than us.
[45:42] for some silly
[45:46] reason. Reason I'm telling you all this
[45:48] is sometimes we don't take things
[45:50] serious. Sometimes we do not take what
[45:53] we vow. And I'm going to preach on that
[45:55] probably somewhere in the seals. I'm
[45:58] going to preach on Numbers 30, which is
[46:00] a a chapter of nothing but vows.
[46:04] Now
[46:05] remember, as I've said many times
[46:08] before, it's not the intimacy and it's
[46:10] not the the um bodily contact that
[46:13] marries
[46:15] you, right? It's the
[46:18] vow. God looks at your vow. If you
[46:22] sisters vow yourself to a man, you are
[46:25] vowed and just as married. Now, is that
[46:27] not correct or not? You say, "Oh, no,
[46:29] they've not." No, the consummation is
[46:31] not the marriage.
[46:33] And many times sorrowful in this age day
[46:35] and age, they've already cons
[46:36] consummated it. They're just going to do
[46:38] the legal
[46:40] thing. Well, I'm going to preach anyway,
[46:43] but it's true. But when are we going to
[46:45] get back to being pure? All of us. I'm
[46:48] talking about men, too. We always preach
[46:50] on a woman being a virgin. Why can't a
[46:51] man supposed to be one,
[46:54] too? And then you and I as Christians
[46:56] are supposed to be virgin in mind.
[46:59] Remember, we're a chasteed version to
[47:01] Christ. Virgin to Christ. We are a
[47:04] version of
[47:05] Christ. But look at this. Now, here we
[47:08] got a man. He's not thinking a thing
[47:10] about
[47:11] it. He knows Hannah's not con not
[47:15] conceiving and still treats her just the
[47:20] same, but
[47:22] she
[47:24] initiates to the Lord what she wants.
[47:29] So Hannah rose up. No, said Elam her
[47:32] husband to her. Hannah, why weepest
[47:34] thou? And why eatest thou not? And why
[47:36] is thy heart grieved? Listen, she was in
[47:39] sore pain that she didn't have a
[47:43] kid. Have we been in sore pain that
[47:46] we've not birthed Christ in our life?
[47:49] That we've not had let the Holy Ghost
[47:51] live and live out through us? Don't be
[47:54] scared of that ghost.
[47:56] It's holy. It'll make you the same
[47:59] thing. Am not I better to thee than 10
[48:03] sons. So Hannah rose up after they had
[48:05] eaten in Shallow and after they had
[48:07] drunk. Now Eli the priest. Now here
[48:09] we're bringing a priest in. All right.
[48:12] So Eli the priest sat upon a seat by a
[48:14] post of the temple of the
[48:18] Lord. And she's she was in bitterness of
[48:21] Saul. Listen, she was in travail.
[48:25] She was in tra. Have you ever just been
[48:27] in travail for something? I'm telling
[48:29] you, you better get in travail for your
[48:31] children because I'm going to tell you
[48:32] something. We're at the
[48:35] archage. Everybody with me on that.
[48:37] We're at the arch
[48:38] age. Remember, Noah built it. Noah
[48:42] preached it. But God shut the
[48:45] door. God shut the door. Noah wanted to
[48:49] keep it open so just in case somebody
[48:50] else would come in. But God shut the
[48:53] door and said, "That's
[48:56] enough." We're coming to that time
[49:00] now. She was in bitterness of soul and
[49:02] prayed unto the Lord and wept sore. And
[49:05] she vowed a vow. Now, here we are. She
[49:07] vowed a vow and said, "Oh Lord of hosts,
[49:10] if thou will indeed look on the
[49:12] affliction of thine handmmaid and
[49:14] remember me and not forget thine
[49:17] handmmaid, but will give unto thine
[49:20] handmmaid a
[49:22] manchild." She was pretty
[49:24] specific. A
[49:26] manchild. Then I will give him unto the
[49:29] Lord all the days of his life, and there
[49:31] shall no razor come upon his head.
[49:36] Somebody asked me one time said, "Well,
[49:38] why they got long hair? Why' Jesus have
[49:40] long hair? And why did people have long
[49:41] hair in in the in the Old Testament?" I
[49:44] said, "Well, they took a Nazerite vow.
[49:47] You read about it in the Bible. If
[49:48] you'll act just like Jesus, you can have
[49:50] long
[49:51] hair." Took care of that, didn't
[49:54] it? All
[49:56] right.
[49:58] So, now watch. It came to pass she
[50:00] continued praying. Now, look, she
[50:02] continued to pray. She didn't just have
[50:04] one little 15-second prayer and and went
[50:07] off. No, she kept praying. She kept
[50:09] praying. She kept
[50:11] praying. She wanted that
[50:14] child. You know why she wanted that
[50:16] child? Not for
[50:19] herself. Not for herself. She wanted
[50:22] that child to give that child to
[50:26] God. And she knew if she give it to God,
[50:29] he'd be different. He would be special.
[50:33] He would have an anointing and you know
[50:36] Samuel was a
[50:42] prophet and watch now. Hannah, she spake
[50:46] in her heart. Only her lips moved, but
[50:50] her voice was not heard. Therefore, Eli
[50:53] thought she had been drunken. And Eli
[50:55] said, "How wilt thou be drunken? How
[50:56] long willil thou be drunk? Put away thy
[50:58] wine from thee." He was just looking at
[51:01] the circumstances. And Hannah answered
[51:03] and said, "No, my Lord. I'm a woman of
[51:05] sorrowful
[51:06] spirit. I have drunk neither wine nor
[51:09] strong drink, but I have poured out my
[51:11] soul before God." My soul before God.
[51:17] Count not thine handmade for a daughter
[51:19] of Bell, which was of evil God. For out
[51:22] of the abundance of my complaint and
[51:24] grief have I spoken here too. Then Eli
[51:28] answered and said, "Go in peace, and the
[51:31] God of Israel grant thee thy petition
[51:34] that thou hast asked of
[51:36] him." God grant the
[51:39] petition that you ask. Not your husband,
[51:44] not me as the preacher, but you ask.
[51:48] Whatever the Bible says, whatever you
[51:50] say, if you say to this mountain, not if
[51:54] you ask your preacher to do it for you,
[51:56] if you say to this mountain, be moved,
[51:58] it'll be moved, and don't doubt in your
[52:02] heart. She said, "Let thine handmade
[52:04] find grace in thy sight." So the woman
[52:06] went her way and did eat, and her
[52:08] countenance was no more sad. Listen, she
[52:11] got
[52:12] her portion that she was asking for. She
[52:16] was settled. She didn't have to be sad
[52:17] anymore. She didn't have to go around.
[52:19] She She knew that she was going to have
[52:21] that child. And they rose up in the
[52:23] morning early and worshiped before the
[52:25] Lord and returned and came to their
[52:26] house in Rama. And Elam knew Hannah, her
[52:29] his wife, and the Lord remembered her.
[52:33] Wherefore, it came to pass when the time
[52:35] was come about after Hannah had
[52:36] conceived that she bare a son, and
[52:38] called his name Samuel, saying, "Because
[52:41] I have asked him of the Lord."
[52:44] And the man Elan El Elcanam and all his
[52:46] household went up to offer unto the Lord
[52:48] the yearly sacrifice and his vow. But
[52:50] Hannah went not up, for she said unto
[52:53] her husband, I will not go up until the
[52:54] child be weaned, and then I'll bring him
[52:56] that he may appear before the Lord and
[52:58] there abide forever. So in other words,
[52:59] he's going to be a child, still going to
[53:01] be a child. She's going to wean him, and
[53:02] then she's going to give him to God.
[53:04] Everybody with me? Well, there's a lot
[53:06] to that, but we'll not get into it
[53:08] because I want to get in the rest of it.
[53:10] And Ela and her husband said unto her,
[53:12] "Do what seemth good. Try until you have
[53:15] weaned him. Only the Lord established
[53:16] his work." So the woman abodeed and gave
[53:19] her son suck until she weaned him. All
[53:20] right? And when she had weaned him, she
[53:24] remembered her
[53:26] vow. She didn't just remember it here.
[53:29] She didn't just remember when the
[53:30] preacher said it. She didn't remember it
[53:31] in the temple. She remembered that vow
[53:34] in
[53:35] herself. Everybody with me?
[53:38] She took him up when she had weaned him.
[53:40] She took him up with her. Now
[53:42] [Music]
[53:45] watch, took
[53:48] sacrifices, flour, wine, bulock, she was
[53:51] doing what the word of God told her to
[53:56] do. Even if her husband didn't, she was
[53:59] going to do it. Everybody with me? I
[54:03] know there's many here that live maybe
[54:05] without a husband or or without a wife.
[54:07] And that's tough. I know it's tough. But
[54:09] you put your sufficiency in God. Let God
[54:12] do the work for you. Let God be your
[54:15] husband. He'll be the best one. He'll
[54:17] never fail
[54:20] you. The child was young. They slew a
[54:24] bulock and brought the child to Eli. She
[54:26] said, "Oh my Lord, as thy soul liveth,
[54:28] my Lord, I am the woman that stood by
[54:30] thee here praying unto the Lord. For
[54:33] this child I prayed, and the Lord hath
[54:35] given me my petition, which I ask of
[54:37] him. Therefore also I have lent him to
[54:40] the Lord. As long as he liveth, he shall
[54:43] be lent to the Lord. Now listen, she
[54:44] goes through all that. She travails. You
[54:46] know, she's got to be pregnant nine
[54:48] months. That's still from the beginning
[54:50] of time till now. It never got quicker
[54:51] or longer. It's been nine months. So she
[54:53] had to wait nine months to have this
[54:56] child. She went through the travail of
[54:57] childbirth. All these things that went
[54:59] on that are not written in scripture,
[55:01] but it's in there. When you bear a
[55:03] child, you know how hap what happened,
[55:04] sisters, you absolutely know what
[55:06] happened. If it was up to us to do it,
[55:08] Steve, we'd have one and then be it.
[55:09] There'd be no more. But it wasn't. It
[55:12] was left up to the sisters to do that.
[55:14] And praise God because he honored her
[55:16] and gave her a son in her old
[55:20] age. For this child I prayed, and the
[55:22] Lord hath given my petition which I
[55:24] asked of him. Therefore, therefore also
[55:27] I have lent him to the Lord. As long as
[55:29] he liveth, he shall be lent to the
[55:33] Lord, and he worshiped the Lord
[55:37] there. Samuel was a baby just like the
[55:39] rest of us. But when Samuel grew up, he
[55:42] became a prophet. He became the voice of
[55:46] Israel. If Israel got anything, they got
[55:49] it from Samuel. But because they believe
[55:51] in
[55:52] prophets, they believed in prophets.
[55:54] They believe God spoke to the prophets.
[55:56] Amos 2:9 tells
[55:58] them we
[56:00] okay. Okay.
[56:04] Okay. Can we just
[56:07] wait? For those of you that don't know
[56:10] it, Brother Luis is interpreting for our
[56:12] Spanish brothers and
[56:14] they're we're getting we're getting a
[56:16] tag team
[56:18] here. But we appreciate we appreciate
[56:20] our Spanish speaking brothers and
[56:22] sisters. We appreciate our
[56:25] interpreters. And for those of you that
[56:26] don't know it, we're working on a
[56:28] program to where as I'm speaking
[56:30] here, when it's archived on I mean I
[56:33] mean when it's live stream here, you'll
[56:35] hear his voice in Spanish preaching the
[56:38] same sermon
[56:42] instantly. God's
[56:45] good. He's good to give us brothers and
[56:47] sisters, maybe sisters, too. Sister
[56:49] Christine has to keep us all straight
[56:52] and keep us keep us throttled down and
[56:56] quietened so we don't run away from the
[56:58] uh from the interpreters. But praise
[57:01] God, there'll be one day we won't need
[57:03] an interpreter. We'll all know each
[57:05] other in our own
[57:08] language. Now, let's look at one more
[57:10] situation and then
[57:12] we'll we'll kind of preach for a
[57:15] minute. This is when Jesus was born.
[57:19] There was a man that lived in a temple.
[57:21] He was
[57:25] old. The Bible tells it about what he
[57:29] did, where he was at, and what he was
[57:31] waiting on. So, we're going to read it
[57:33] here. Luke
[57:34] 2:22. And when the day of her
[57:36] purification according to the law of
[57:38] Moses were
[57:40] accomplished, they brought him to
[57:41] Jerusalem to present him to the Lord.
[57:43] Now, this is the baby Jesus. All right?
[57:45] And they had to circumcise him on the
[57:47] eighth day. Everybody with me on that?
[57:48] That was circumcision time. As it is
[57:51] written in the law of the Lord, every
[57:52] male that open the womb shall be called
[57:54] holy to the Lord and to offer a
[57:57] sacrifice according to that which is
[57:59] said in the law of the Lord, a pair of
[58:00] turtle doves and two young pigeons. Is
[58:03] everybody with me on
[58:05] that? Went to church, did what the
[58:08] scripture
[58:10] says all the
[58:13] time. Are we listen? You don't have to
[58:16] bring two turtle loves and two pigeons
[58:18] and throw them on the altar over here
[58:19] and let's kill them. That'd be blood,
[58:22] guts, and feathers everywhere. You just
[58:24] got to bring
[58:25] yourself. Bring yourself as an offering.
[58:28] You come and offer yourself to God. The
[58:30] problem is is we want to do like just
[58:32] like Aaron was preaching and we told him
[58:34] there. There's many people in this
[58:38] world that want to be saved from hell.
[58:43] They're
[58:45] scared. But do you want him to be your
[58:47] Lord and
[58:49] Master? Do you want him to be your Lord
[58:52] and Savior, not just your savior?
[58:56] Because to bring it up a notch and for
[58:58] him to become your Lord, he has to
[59:00] become the Lord of your
[59:02] life apart from anything else.
[59:07] to a Christian, he we're we're the very
[59:09] center of God and he's the very center
[59:11] of
[59:12] us. And everything every decision,
[59:15] everything we do should be centered
[59:17] around
[59:20] God. And Zach made a made a vow to have
[59:25] the baby dedicated and they did it. So
[59:28] God will honor it as long as he'll honor
[59:30] God. same way with all of
[59:34] us that lived before
[59:36] him. Behold, there was a man in
[59:39] Jerusalem whose name was
[59:42] Simeon. Now, this old man lived in a
[59:47] temple.
[59:49] He was good, devout, but God spoke to
[59:52] him one day and said, "You'll not die
[59:55] till you see the
[59:58] Lord or the consolation of Israel." And
[1:00:02] the Holy Ghost was upon him. And it was
[1:00:04] revealed unto him by the Holy Ghost that
[1:00:07] he should not see death before he had
[1:00:09] seen the Lord's
[1:00:10] Christ. So what a
[1:00:12] consolation, don't you think? I mean
[1:00:15] every even
[1:00:17] even on the Sabbath day that's one thing
[1:00:19] you could do if that eighth day fell on
[1:00:22] the Sabbath day because the Sabbath day
[1:00:24] you didn't do anything but if that
[1:00:25] eighth day of circumcision fell on that
[1:00:28] Saturday you're circumcised. So the
[1:00:31] temple was always full and here's Simeon
[1:00:33] and oh praise God that he was led by the
[1:00:36] Holy Ghost. Why can't we be led like
[1:00:37] that? Why can't when we come to church
[1:00:39] that we want to see the Lord's Christ,
[1:00:41] not see a group of people, not worried
[1:00:43] about what I'm going to preach, but hope
[1:00:46] that God speaks to
[1:00:48] you and helps you. Why waste your
[1:00:54] time? Cuz if you're not a Christian,
[1:00:56] you're in
[1:00:57] time. Time is against all of us. I know
[1:01:01] we sing that song, I'll not die.
[1:01:03] Hallelujah. By and by. And I know that's
[1:01:05] hard for people to see. The graves are
[1:01:07] full of people that go went to this
[1:01:09] church, but they're not dead. They're
[1:01:12] more alive than we are. I'd rather be
[1:01:14] there than
[1:01:17] here. You say, "You're crazy." Thank
[1:01:23] you. But here's a man that devoted his
[1:01:26] life to see one kid, one
[1:01:31] baby. Cuz watch what he did.
[1:01:35] He stood there every day and watched
[1:01:37] that line go
[1:01:38] by. Never felt the move of the
[1:01:42] spirit. Never felt the move of the
[1:01:44] spirit. Hundreds, thousands of
[1:01:47] babies, men, babies. He knew that was
[1:01:51] going to be a manchild. He knew that he
[1:01:53] was going to be the savior. He had read
[1:01:56] Isaiah. He had read Jeremiah. He had
[1:01:58] read all these different things. He had
[1:02:00] known him as Jehovah.
[1:02:04] But that wasn't that baby's name. He
[1:02:07] knew the baby's name wasn't going to be
[1:02:08] Jehovah cuz I see the Lord's Christ.
[1:02:12] That's what he said. Won't see death
[1:02:14] till I see the Lord's
[1:02:17] Christ. And he came by the spirit into
[1:02:19] the temple. When the parents brought in
[1:02:21] the child Jesus to do for him after the
[1:02:23] custom of the
[1:02:24] law, then took he him up in his arms.
[1:02:27] What a
[1:02:29] time. What a
[1:02:32] time. I was thinking yesterday, Brother
[1:02:35] Dutch and Sister April Scott, they
[1:02:36] become grandparents, had the first
[1:02:38] grandchild a couple days ago, and I told
[1:02:41] him, I said, "Listen, buddy, your your
[1:02:42] your world's
[1:02:44] changed. You're going to think
[1:02:46] different, act
[1:02:48] different. They never make a mistake." I
[1:02:50] got my grand baby back there,
[1:02:52] so But they
[1:02:55] do.
[1:02:56] Sorry. But think about Simeon. He's
[1:03:00] getting old. His life's getting ready to
[1:03:02] be over, but he's
[1:03:04] promised by God in a
[1:03:06] revelation by the Old Testament that
[1:03:09] that child was going to be in the
[1:03:13] temple going to be born of a virgin. He
[1:03:16] had heard the
[1:03:17] rumors and here comes this little virgin
[1:03:20] in. She was still a
[1:03:23] virgin. She had not known a man, but she
[1:03:26] had a baby in her arms. And I'm sure
[1:03:29] that there was probably a 10-ft gap in
[1:03:31] front and a 10-ft gap behind her cuz she
[1:03:34] had a bad name. She had a bad
[1:03:37] reputation. But yet God sent that baby
[1:03:41] exactly the way that Isaiah said,
[1:03:44] "Behold, a virgin shall conceive and
[1:03:46] give birth to a
[1:03:48] [Music]
[1:03:51] manchild." But it didn't bother Simeon
[1:03:54] because Simeon was led by the Holy
[1:03:55] Ghost.
[1:03:57] When are we going to start being led by
[1:03:58] the Holy Ghost and not by every other
[1:04:00] ghost there
[1:04:04] is? Then he took him in his
[1:04:07] arms. He knew he had seen what he was
[1:04:10] looking for his whole life. He felt the
[1:04:13] pull. He felt the
[1:04:16] anointing. He felt that today that
[1:04:19] scripture had been fulfilled that he had
[1:04:21] been living for for
[1:04:23] years, years. He was an old man. It
[1:04:27] doesn't say when God revealed that to
[1:04:29] him, but I'm sure it wasn't just right
[1:04:31] then because he was waiting for the
[1:04:34] consolation of Israel. In other words,
[1:04:36] for Israel to come to their right state.
[1:04:40] The Messiah had to be on the
[1:04:43] scene. And he took him up in his arms
[1:04:45] and blessed God and
[1:04:48] said,"Lord, now let thy deserv thy
[1:04:50] servant depart in peace according to thy
[1:04:53] word, for mine eyes have seen thy
[1:05:00] salvation." What about a man lived his
[1:05:03] whole life and brother Donnie one moment
[1:05:07] defined his whole
[1:05:08] life, but he had Jesus in his arms.
[1:05:12] He may not have known exactly what he
[1:05:14] was doing, but I'll promise you, he knew
[1:05:17] that that baby was going to grow up and
[1:05:19] be Isaiah, Jeremiah, and all the
[1:05:22] prophets. He was going to
[1:05:24] fulfill the
[1:05:27] scripture. And he said, "Let me depart
[1:05:29] in
[1:05:30] peace." That's what we should be as a
[1:05:32] Christian. When you meet the Lord, when
[1:05:35] you hold him in your
[1:05:37] arms, you say, "I've never done that
[1:05:39] before. You better try.
[1:05:43] You better bring him so close till he
[1:05:45] gets inside of you and lives your life,
[1:05:48] lives his life through
[1:05:52] you. And then what are you going to be?
[1:05:55] A living
[1:05:56] vessel,
[1:06:02] holy for my eyes have seen thy
[1:06:05] salvation.
[1:06:07] Now, just make a few comments here and
[1:06:08] then we'll go to we'll go to uh water
[1:06:12] baptism. Now, look, as we said before,
[1:06:15] babies have no sin. They were born in
[1:06:18] sin. We're all born contrary to what God
[1:06:22] wanted in the per in the first place.
[1:06:24] All
[1:06:25] right? But God made a provision. He sent
[1:06:28] his son. That baby we've been talking
[1:06:30] about grew up to be a man. And that man
[1:06:32] died on a cross to save every
[1:06:35] person. That's what I was preaching last
[1:06:38] weekend. The very most simple. For God
[1:06:40] so loved the
[1:06:41] world that he gave his only begotten
[1:06:44] son. That love is not the love you have
[1:06:45] for your parents or your family or your
[1:06:47] car or
[1:06:49] your that's a love of God called
[1:06:52] agape. For God so agape this world.
[1:06:56] Agape love is not
[1:06:58] conditional. It is unconditional.
[1:07:02] It never changes. As I said before, you
[1:07:05] may have bad days and good days, but God
[1:07:07] doesn't have a bad day and a good day.
[1:07:09] We need to start yielding oursel to
[1:07:11] what's inside of
[1:07:14] us. Everybody with
[1:07:16] me? But a baby has no
[1:07:19] sin. What's it sin for? What's it sin?
[1:07:22] What's it The process of sinning is
[1:07:24] what? You got to think it here first. Is
[1:07:26] that right? You think it here first.
[1:07:29] This is where sin began. And then it
[1:07:32] what? It develops down into and all your
[1:07:34] body does is displays what's inside of
[1:07:37] you. You can hold it. You can keep it
[1:07:40] secret every once in a while, but all of
[1:07:41] a sudden the real you is going to pop up
[1:07:44] somewhere. And I hope and pray that the
[1:07:46] real you today has already been
[1:07:49] dead, killed as we're going to the grave
[1:07:52] in just a few minutes. We're going to go
[1:07:54] out there and we're going to put our
[1:07:55] brother in a grave. But praise God, they
[1:07:59] put Jesus in a grave, but he's still not
[1:08:01] he's not there
[1:08:02] anymore. He resurrected and we're going
[1:08:05] to resurrect into newness of life. Have
[1:08:08] you ever listen, the Bible tells us at
[1:08:10] the very end of this, he said, "Behold,
[1:08:12] all things have become new."
[1:08:15] But when you get the new birth that's
[1:08:18] here, that takes you to that new image
[1:08:21] that you're heading toward that
[1:08:23] everybody that's gone on on that other
[1:08:25] side has met
[1:08:28] that. They've met that what was inside
[1:08:30] of them. They just developed into that
[1:08:33] had to leave the body here because of
[1:08:34] sin. Because they were born in
[1:08:37] sin. But the soul is what God's worried
[1:08:40] about. He's not worried about your body.
[1:08:42] He's worried about your soul. For God so
[1:08:45] loved the world so agapeed the world and
[1:08:49] agape is non conditional. Even your love
[1:08:53] for your wife is
[1:08:56] conditional. Oh
[1:08:59] please. If your wife cooks
[1:09:02] good, keeps your clothes
[1:09:05] clean. If
[1:09:09] if that's filio love. That's where you
[1:09:13] get the word from the
[1:09:16] um in Pennsylvania,
[1:09:18] Philadelphia. It's called the city of
[1:09:20] brotherly love. Philadelphia or felio
[1:09:23] love is the love you have for your
[1:09:25] friends, your brother. And you I love
[1:09:27] the deer
[1:09:28] hunt. Well, now what am I talking about
[1:09:32] at that at this point in my life? That's
[1:09:33] what I like to do. If I can't do that
[1:09:36] anymore, I'm going to go and love
[1:09:38] something
[1:09:39] else. That's why God's love is
[1:09:41] unconditional. He can't say, "Oh, oops.
[1:09:44] I'm sorry, Regina. I didn't see that.
[1:09:46] She made the biggest boo boo and she I'm
[1:09:48] gone. She gone. I'm out of here." No. He
[1:09:51] saw you making mistakes already before
[1:09:54] the foundation of the world. Before you
[1:09:55] ever come into human flesh, you made a
[1:09:57] mistake. But you were in the mind of God
[1:10:00] in the eternal part. If you have him
[1:10:02] today in your soul, if that soul inside
[1:10:05] of you is wanting something more than
[1:10:07] this stinking world can give you, they
[1:10:09] can put everybody they want to in the
[1:10:11] White House. They ain't going to turn
[1:10:13] this thing around. We are headed for
[1:10:17] disaster. Don't put your hopes in the
[1:10:20] stock
[1:10:21] market. Don't put your hopes in your
[1:10:26] job. You better put your hopes in Jesus
[1:10:28] Christ.
[1:10:30] put him
[1:10:33] first. Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
[1:10:35] God, what can I do? What what what what
[1:10:38] what's in my plan instead of you making
[1:10:40] the
[1:10:41] plan? Because remember, we fail, we go
[1:10:44] in this direction, we go in that
[1:10:46] direction. God never
[1:10:49] fails. But the reason we don't
[1:10:52] baptize or sprinkle babies is this one
[1:10:55] thing. There's two separate things in
[1:10:57] Christianity that we look at. One is a
[1:11:00] dedication and one's a
[1:11:02] baptism. Everybody with me? They're not
[1:11:05] the
[1:11:06] same. There's two different things that
[1:11:08] we do. You can't intertwine them
[1:11:11] together and say that we baptized this
[1:11:14] baby. Well, that per that baby don't
[1:11:17] need to be baptized again. No, that baby
[1:11:20] is covered under the sinless part of
[1:11:23] Jesus Christ dying for it before it
[1:11:25] reaches the age of accountability.
[1:11:27] Everybody with me? But see, baptism
[1:11:30] doesn't make you a
[1:11:33] Christian. I wished it did. I'd go throw
[1:11:37] everybody in the lake.
[1:11:41] I would. If that's all it was was
[1:11:44] salvation, we just started throwing them
[1:11:45] in the water. But that's not it. It's an
[1:11:48] outward expression that God has done
[1:11:51] something in your life because you were
[1:11:55] in sin.
[1:11:58] This baby's not in sin. This baby's
[1:12:01] being dedicated as something delicate
[1:12:04] for us to take care of until it reaches
[1:12:07] a point to where God can deal with that
[1:12:10] child. With me? But baptism, you can
[1:12:14] baptism a 100 babies, thousand million
[1:12:17] babies. That's not what God's talking
[1:12:20] about.
[1:12:24] But it's too young to know what baptism
[1:12:28] is because baptism is not just getting
[1:12:34] wet. It's an outward expression that
[1:12:36] something has changed on the inside or
[1:12:39] is changing or you feel a pull. You feel
[1:12:43] something
[1:12:49] different. Prophet tells us a child is
[1:12:51] too young to be baptized. A baptism is
[1:12:54] an outward expression that an inward
[1:12:55] work of grace has been done. In other
[1:12:57] words, we
[1:12:58] brought the we brought the kids up
[1:13:01] here. They didn't say, "Bring me to be
[1:13:05] dedicated," right? Because they don't
[1:13:07] know the difference. We as as parents
[1:13:10] then that's the connection we have.
[1:13:12] We're going to bring them up here and
[1:13:14] have them dedicated because they don't
[1:13:17] have to be baptized.
[1:13:20] Now when that kid grows up to 7 8 9 10
[1:13:23] 11 years old whatever it is age of
[1:13:24] accountability it's all different for
[1:13:26] others that's up to you and
[1:13:28] God then you've got to come to a place
[1:13:30] and said I have sinned and now I want to
[1:13:34] be different I want to be baptismo or
[1:13:39] changed from one to another one place to
[1:13:43] another remember but it doesn't save you
[1:13:44] but it's there's no way that little
[1:13:47] Emerson is want to to outwardly express
[1:13:50] herself. Oh, she's doing it
[1:13:52] now. But it's
[1:13:58] uncontrollable. That's why I said I
[1:14:00] don't have problems with babies. I have
[1:14:02] problems with adults acting like
[1:14:07] babies. Why cry? Crying means you need
[1:14:10] something. You want something. They
[1:14:12] can't express theirelves, so they cry.
[1:14:16] But
[1:14:19] remember,
[1:14:21] dedication, we're doing
[1:14:23] it for
[1:14:25] them, right? Everybody with me? We'll be
[1:14:28] done here in a
[1:14:29] second. We're doing it for them. We are
[1:14:32] We are But now what you're doing is
[1:14:33] though, you're vowing a
[1:14:35] vow. Come on. You're vowing a vow that
[1:14:39] you're going to bring my ch I'm going to
[1:14:41] bring my
[1:14:42] child. Give it to the preacher. Preacher
[1:14:45] gives it back to them. And somewhere in
[1:14:48] all that we give it to God. But you got
[1:14:50] to give yourself to God
[1:14:52] first. Don't try to say, "Well, my my my
[1:14:55] baby's just my baby's done. She's sealed
[1:14:57] in. He's sealed in. He's he's good."
[1:14:59] Yeah, until the day of
[1:15:02] accountability. But what about
[1:15:04] you? What about me?
[1:15:07] I left of my own accord. And usually
[1:15:11] that means you take your kids with them
[1:15:13] with
[1:15:15] you. And for that, I'm
[1:15:18] sorry. But there's somewhere you got to
[1:15:20] turn
[1:15:21] around. Start doing right. Start acting
[1:15:24] right. Start acting different.
[1:15:29] That's just one of the things I don't
[1:15:30] understand is people uh and I even think
[1:15:33] I've said it in the Methodist
[1:15:35] church. Christianity is a broad brush
[1:15:39] nowadays. Everybody with me? You know
[1:15:41] what I'm talking about. It's a big old
[1:15:43] broad brush. Well, I'm a
[1:15:45] Christian. No, I thought the Bible said
[1:15:48] straight is a way. Narrow is the gate.
[1:15:53] narrow, a little brush, which means you
[1:15:57] got to live different than just saying
[1:15:58] I'm a
[1:16:00] Christian. As Ryan sitting here in the
[1:16:03] front, he started in a Christian rock
[1:16:05] band. May
[1:16:07] I? He called it Christian rock, but he
[1:16:10] called it
[1:16:13] croc. And I was watching one the other
[1:16:15] day and when you can't tell, I mean, out
[1:16:18] of their mouth, they're singing gospel
[1:16:21] songs, but they look just like the rock
[1:16:23] people that are singing for the devil.
[1:16:26] There's got to be a
[1:16:28] separation. Kids, don't get caught in
[1:16:30] all that. Listen to the words. I said
[1:16:32] before, I don't mind if you listen to
[1:16:34] contemporary music. I want you to sing
[1:16:36] that song here, though, with a pure mind
[1:16:38] and with a Holy Ghost, not looking like
[1:16:40] the devil and trying to worship God.
[1:16:42] It's what I said. I'm a Christian. Have
[1:16:45] you ever been to church? No, but I'm a
[1:16:48] Christian. Baptist. I went to church
[1:16:50] when I was seven. I shook the hand of
[1:16:53] the preacher. Got my letter. You been
[1:16:56] back to church yet? No, I ain't been
[1:16:58] back to church yet. They'll be 50 years
[1:17:00] old, 60 years old. Listen, you say, "Oh,
[1:17:03] it happens, folks. I've seen it at
[1:17:06] funerals." That's not the way this
[1:17:08] Bible's written. That's not the way
[1:17:10] Christianity is a walk. It is not a
[1:17:14] halfime every once in a while a feature.
[1:17:18] It is your life.
[1:17:22] So the baptism is an outward expression
[1:17:24] that something's going on different. You
[1:17:28] are now professing to the world.
[1:17:30] Somebody's not bringing you to
[1:17:33] this. You're inside of you expressing
[1:17:36] out now what you're wanting to
[1:17:38] do. You can't keep it inside. Listen.
[1:17:41] When Simeon felt the move of the Holy
[1:17:44] Ghost, he went straight to that
[1:17:46] baby. It pulled him to that child. Why?
[1:17:50] Because he was looking for that child.
[1:17:53] Are we looking? That child's not a baby
[1:17:57] anymore. That child died, grew up, died
[1:18:00] to save your soul.
[1:18:03] Are we willing to let him do it?
[1:18:08] So a baptism is a confession of an
[1:18:10] inward work of grace. It's been done. A
[1:18:12] little infant has no knowledge of sin.
[1:18:14] Therefore, when Jesus died, he died to
[1:18:16] take away the sin of the world. Because
[1:18:18] remember, he agapeed the world. He loved
[1:18:20] the world without condition. You say,
[1:18:22] "Well, he didn't save everybody." Hold
[1:18:25] on a minute. Yes, he
[1:18:28] did. Yes, he did. Or the Bible's
[1:18:32] wrong. You have a decision to make.
[1:18:38] He would have saved Judas. He would have
[1:18:41] saved Adolf
[1:18:44] Hitler. He even told Cain, he said, "If
[1:18:46] you'll do like your brother," God spoke
[1:18:48] to him straight lipped to ear. He said,
[1:18:49] "If you'll do like your brother," in
[1:18:51] other words, I'll accept your
[1:18:54] sacrifice. Why I said we're not a broad
[1:18:57] brush bunch of Christians. I ain't
[1:19:00] saying that again.
[1:19:02] But we're
[1:19:08] not. When Jesus was
[1:19:11] baptized,
[1:19:13] immersed, he went up straight, went out
[1:19:15] of the water, and lo, the heavens were
[1:19:16] open, and he saw the spirit of God
[1:19:18] descending like a dove enlightening on
[1:19:19] him. We talking about Matthew. And lo, a
[1:19:21] voice from heaven said, "This is my
[1:19:23] beloved son in whom I'm well
[1:19:25] pleased." Matthew 28:18.
[1:19:28] Jesus came and spake unto them, saying,
[1:19:30] "All power in heaven and earth has been
[1:19:31] given unto me, me in heaven and in
[1:19:34] earth." There's three things we're
[1:19:36] compelled to do as Christians. Go,
[1:19:39] teach, and baptize. Everybody with me? I
[1:19:42] got it right there. Go ye therefore
[1:19:46] comma and teach all nations comma
[1:19:49] baptizing them in the name. That is not
[1:19:54] names. That is
[1:19:57] name. Father's not a name. Son's not a
[1:20:00] name. Holy Ghost is not a name. I'm
[1:20:02] going to read you here in a minute.
[1:20:03] Jehovah's not God's
[1:20:04] name. It's a
[1:20:06] title. It's a title to a name. So what's
[1:20:10] he saying? Go baptize in the name of who
[1:20:13] you know the father is, who you know the
[1:20:15] son is, and who you know the holy ghost
[1:20:16] is. It's the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:20:20] Teaching them to observe all things
[1:20:22] whatsoever I have commanded you. And lo,
[1:20:25] I'm with you always, even until the end
[1:20:27] of the world. Name means a word or
[1:20:29] combination of words by which a person,
[1:20:32] place, or thing, a body or class or any
[1:20:36] object of thought is designated, called
[1:20:38] or known. In other words, designated
[1:20:41] Aaron Roberts, raise your
[1:20:44] hand. Aaron Roberts, raise your
[1:20:47] hand. Aaron Roberts, raise your hand.
[1:20:51] Oh, there's only one now. Humans, raise
[1:20:54] your
[1:20:55] hand. Fathers, raise your
[1:20:57] hand. Sons, raise your
[1:21:02] hand. That was a lot. Aaron Roberts,
[1:21:05] raise your
[1:21:07] hand. One.
[1:21:11] One person raised their hand because
[1:21:13] he's
[1:21:14] identified with that name is how he's
[1:21:17] identified. He's a father, he's a son,
[1:21:19] he's a human. Like all y'all raise,
[1:21:21] everybody raising their hand, right? But
[1:21:23] only one Aaron Roberts, raise your hand.
[1:21:25] Well, it's pretty
[1:21:29] consistent. Yeah, I know. I know. I was
[1:21:32] a little slow. I kind of give you a
[1:21:33] little time in
[1:21:34] between, but Aaron Roberts, raise your
[1:21:37] hand. Happens every time.
[1:21:41] So now in Acts
[1:21:42] 2:38, Peter said unto them, "Repent and
[1:21:45] do different than what Jesus
[1:21:48] said." That's not what he said. Cuz
[1:21:51] Peter had just received the Holy Ghost
[1:21:53] which was inside of Jesus speaking to
[1:21:55] the people. Am I correct? Or you got two
[1:21:58] or three different Holy Ghost. You got
[1:22:00] one Holy Ghost.
[1:22:03] be baptized every one of you in the name
[1:22:07] of Jesus Christ for the remission of
[1:22:09] your sin and you shall receive the gift
[1:22:11] of the Holy Ghost. What a what a promise
[1:22:13] for the promise unto you and your
[1:22:15] children and Roberts raise your hand.
[1:22:16] Okay, see there it can't even trick
[1:22:20] him because he's
[1:22:22] identified. You know, you sitting we
[1:22:24] were sitting the other day and about
[1:22:26] 1500 people. We were at a um wild game
[1:22:29] supper and I didn't jump every time a
[1:22:31] name
[1:22:33] was It wasn't
[1:22:35] mine. It wasn't my name. They didn't
[1:22:37] call my name. They called Aby's They
[1:22:41] called Abby Grace Roberts and she about
[1:22:45] melted. I was going to have to give her
[1:22:48] some She had to stand up in front of
[1:22:50] 1500 people so they could bring her her
[1:22:52] prize. But there's not another person in
[1:22:55] 1500 people. There's not another person
[1:22:57] stood up that was Abby Grace
[1:23:01] Roberts. One faith, one Lord, one
[1:23:05] baptism. Let's continue. Mark
[1:23:08] 16:15. This is the same version of what
[1:23:11] Jesus was telling them in Matthew. Go ye
[1:23:13] into all the world, preach the gospel to
[1:23:15] every creature. He that believeth and is
[1:23:17] baptized shall be saved, but he that
[1:23:19] believeth not shall be damned. John
[1:23:22] 4:1 when therefore the Lord knew how the
[1:23:25] Pharisees had heard that Jesus, excuse
[1:23:28] me, made and baptized more disciples
[1:23:29] than John, though Jesus himself baptized
[1:23:32] not but his disciples. So the discip if
[1:23:34] the disciples had to be baptized, you
[1:23:35] going to have to be
[1:23:37] baptized because remember Paul's going
[1:23:40] to meet a group of people that was
[1:23:41] preaching and the Holy Ghost fell on
[1:23:43] them, but immediately what what Paul
[1:23:46] tell them? You need to go be
[1:23:48] baptized. Ephesians 3:14, for this cause
[1:23:53] I bow my knees unto the father of our
[1:23:56] Lord Jesus Christ, in whom the whole
[1:23:59] family in heaven and earth is
[1:24:06] named. Exodus 6:3, I appeared unto
[1:24:09] Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob by the name of
[1:24:11] God Almighty, but by my name Jehovah,
[1:24:14] was I not known to them. Jehovah is not
[1:24:17] a name, it's a title.
[1:24:20] Matthew 18:1 19 again I say unto you
[1:24:23] that if two of you shall agree on earth
[1:24:25] as touching anything that they shall ask
[1:24:27] it shall be done for them of my father
[1:24:29] which is in heaven for where two or
[1:24:31] three are gathered in my name there I am
[1:24:36] in the midst of them John 14:13 Now
[1:24:39] listen let me ask you a question who's
[1:24:41] he talking about right
[1:24:42] there Jesus said in my
[1:24:45] name there I'll be in the midst who who
[1:24:48] is who he talking about and
[1:24:50] Roberts he raised his hand when I said
[1:24:52] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ or
[1:24:54] Jesus
[1:24:56] Christ John 14:13 whatsoever you shall
[1:24:59] ask in my
[1:25:02] name that will I do that the father may
[1:25:06] be glorified in the son if you shall ask
[1:25:08] anything in my name I will do it Acts
[1:25:12] 8:12 but when they believe Philip
[1:25:15] preaching the things concerning the
[1:25:16] kingdom of God and the name of Jesus
[1:25:19] Christ. They were baptized, both men and
[1:25:21] women. Acts 8:14. Now when the apostles
[1:25:25] were at Jerusalem, heard that Samaria
[1:25:26] had received the word of God, they sent
[1:25:28] Peter and John, who when they were come
[1:25:30] down, prayed for them that they might
[1:25:31] receive the Holy Ghost. For as yet he w
[1:25:34] yet he was fallen upon none of them.
[1:25:36] Only they were baptized in the name of
[1:25:39] the Lord Jesus. Then laid they their
[1:25:41] hands on them, and they received the
[1:25:43] Holy Ghost. There's something connected
[1:25:45] to that name. Baptism, right name, Holy
[1:25:51] Ghost. Acts 10 verse 47. Can any man
[1:25:54] forbid water that these should not be
[1:25:56] baptized which have received the Holy
[1:25:58] Ghost as well as we? And he commanded
[1:26:00] them. This is Pet Paul. And he commanded
[1:26:02] them to be baptized in the name of the
[1:26:04] Lord. Then prayed they him to tell you
[1:26:07] certain days. Acts 19
[1:26:12] verse1. This is Paul again. He said unto
[1:26:15] them unto, "What were you baptized?" And
[1:26:16] they said unto
[1:26:20] John. Then Paul said, "Johnly baptized
[1:26:22] with the baptism of repentance, saying
[1:26:24] unto the people that they should believe
[1:26:26] on him." Now, who's that him? The Lord
[1:26:28] Jesus Christ. Not a father, not a son,
[1:26:30] not a holy ghost. That's not a name.
[1:26:32] Those are
[1:26:33] titles. That they should believe on him
[1:26:35] which should come after him. That is on
[1:26:38] Christ
[1:26:39] Jesus. When they heard this, they were
[1:26:41] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
[1:26:44] And when Paul laid hands on them, the
[1:26:46] Holy Ghost came on. It looks like that
[1:26:48] kind of connects
[1:26:49] together. And they spake with tongues
[1:26:51] and
[1:26:54] prophesied. Let's read this and then
[1:26:55] we'll close. Musicians, come
[1:26:58] up. A song and psalm and song at the
[1:27:02] dedication of the house of
[1:27:04] David. I will extol thee, oh Lord, for
[1:27:07] thou hast lifted me up and hast not made
[1:27:09] my foes to rejoice over me. Oh Lord my
[1:27:14] God, I cried unto thee and thou hast
[1:27:15] healed me. Oh Lord, thou hast brought up
[1:27:18] my soul from the grave. Thou hast kept
[1:27:20] me alive that I should not go down to
[1:27:22] the
[1:27:23] pit. Why? Because he dedicated himself
[1:27:28] right here. We know he was dedicating
[1:27:29] the temple, but this is the temple. Sing
[1:27:32] unto the Lord, oh you saints of his.
[1:27:33] Give thanks at the remembrance of his
[1:27:36] holiness. For his anger endureth but a
[1:27:39] moment, and his favor is life. Weeping
[1:27:42] may endure for a night, but joy cometh
[1:27:46] in the
[1:27:47] morning. Joy cometh in the morning. So,
[1:27:51] what are we doing
[1:27:53] here? We're
[1:27:55] Christians. All
[1:27:57] right. We have made our
[1:28:00] confession. We have not made a
[1:28:03] dedication
[1:28:04] yet. The dedication was
[1:28:07] brought here. All right. by the
[1:28:13] parents. But we're going to go to a
[1:28:15] baptismal service that our brother has
[1:28:17] confessed that he wants to show the
[1:28:19] world that something has
[1:28:22] changed, that something is different
[1:28:24] than it was
[1:28:26] before. We believe in baby dedication.
[1:28:29] Absolutely. We do it all the
[1:28:31] time. But I'm telling you, don't make
[1:28:33] the mistake of thinking that's all you
[1:28:37] got to do. Let's stand our feet.
[1:28:40] It's the whole Christian walk is a
[1:28:44] life. A
[1:28:47] life. The
[1:28:51] baptism. The whole family in heaven and
[1:28:54] earth is named what? The Lord Jesus
[1:28:59] Christ. Because when I told Aaron to
[1:29:02] raise his hand, I said, "Aaron Roberts."
[1:29:06] Now, there might have been there's a
[1:29:07] couple Rebecca's in here and there's a
[1:29:09] couple of other people in here that
[1:29:10] could have raised her hand if I have
[1:29:11] just said Rebecca raise your
[1:29:14] hand, but Aaron Roberts is his full
[1:29:17] name. Not with the other, but we knew
[1:29:21] who. Did y'all know exactly who I was
[1:29:22] talking about? If you knew Aaron, you
[1:29:24] know he's sitting right
[1:29:25] there. Aaron Roberts, Lord
[1:29:29] Jesus, baptizing them in the name of the
[1:29:32] Father and of the Son and of the Holy
[1:29:34] Ghost. we are, which is the name of the
[1:29:37] Lord Jesus Christ. That's a Catholic
[1:29:39] doctrine and it's wrong. It's false. The
[1:29:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ puts you
[1:29:45] in a good position to receive the Holy
[1:29:49] Ghost. For the promises to you and your
[1:29:51] children, to them that are far off.
[1:29:54] We've read that many times. You ought to
[1:29:56] see those people scrambling in the
[1:29:57] Philippines when we have those mystery
[1:29:59] expose and and a brother stands up and
[1:30:02] says, "I'll give you $10,000 if you can
[1:30:04] show me where anybody was baptized any
[1:30:06] other way than the name of the Lord,
[1:30:08] name of the Lord Jesus or Lord Jesus
[1:30:09] Christ in the Bible. I'll give you
[1:30:11] $10,000." Well, buddy, $10,000 of a
[1:30:14] Filipino to us, too. But that's a year
[1:30:16] salary to them. They tear their Bibles
[1:30:18] up trying to find it. You can't find it.
[1:30:20] It ain't there. God does his things
[1:30:24] right. and he doesn't write the first
[1:30:26] time. So I take today we're going to go
[1:30:28] to a watery grave, but I ask you, have
[1:30:31] you dedicated
[1:30:33] yourself just as we dedicated this
[1:30:36] child? Have you dedicated your life,
[1:30:38] your services, whatever you have, have
[1:30:40] you dedicated it to the
[1:30:42] Lord? If you haven't, it's time to do it
[1:30:46] again. I mean,
[1:30:48] rededication. We baptized some of you a
[1:30:51] couple times, maybe some three times.
[1:30:53] That's okay. But there's somewhere you
[1:30:55] got to put that stake down and say,
[1:30:57] "This is it, Satan. I've done everything
[1:30:59] God told me to do the right
[1:31:03] way. So back
[1:31:06] off. Back off. You have that ability to
[1:31:09] say, "Back off, Satan. I've done
[1:31:10] everything." But now, if you hadn't, he
[1:31:13] can stand right there, know your
[1:31:18] line, and still just keep bothering you
[1:31:20] and bothering you and bothering you.
[1:31:25] Listen, never in my
[1:31:28] life. And my dad didn't do it
[1:31:31] either. He didn't
[1:31:34] preach
[1:31:36] that. You got to be a Christian or
[1:31:39] you're going straight to
[1:31:40] hell. Now, if you're not, you're going.
[1:31:44] But there's grace in there and there's
[1:31:45] love in
[1:31:46] there. Know
[1:31:48] Jesus. Get to know him intimately.
[1:31:52] If not, there is a devil's hell that's
[1:31:54] waiting on
[1:31:56] everybody. I don't care how good you
[1:31:58] are. I don't care how nice you are to
[1:32:02] people. There's going to be a lot of
[1:32:04] nice people in
[1:32:06] hell. But there's not going to be one
[1:32:08] person in
[1:32:09] hell who has Jesus Christ in their soul.
[1:32:13] Not one. Not one. He's already went to
[1:32:17] hell for
[1:32:19] me. He went through a devil's grave. He
[1:32:22] went through hell for me, but as he
[1:32:25] resurrected in newness of life. So when
[1:32:27] we read that out here, that's what's
[1:32:29] going to happen. We're going to
[1:32:30] resurrect in newness of life. My dad and
[1:32:33] brother Tatum and all the different
[1:32:34] ones, they're not coming back here
[1:32:37] old. They're coming back here
[1:32:40] newness of life. But you got to know him
[1:32:44] here to carry him over there and for him
[1:32:47] to carry you back here. Oh, what a If
[1:32:51] you're not a Christian today, I hope you
[1:32:52] don't
[1:32:53] sleep until you find that person. I'm
[1:32:56] talking about not a message, not God
[1:32:58] sent a
[1:32:59] prophet. You find Jesus Christ and I'll
[1:33:02] promise you, he'll point you to the
[1:33:04] scripture. He'll point you to the truth.
[1:33:07] He can't because remember, somebody told
[1:33:09] me one time, God don't make a
[1:33:11] mistake. I think I say it about every
[1:33:13] service. God doesn't make a mistake.
[1:33:15] Never has, never
[1:33:17] will. And he put all he put everything
[1:33:19] he thought right
[1:33:20] [Music]
[1:33:22] here. Let's sing a song.
[1:33:27] Just remember yours.
[1:33:29] When we finish, if you have a
[1:33:32] needad glad I'm
[1:33:35] yours, Lord.
[1:33:38] I'm so glad I'm yours.
[1:33:44] So glad your
[1:33:50] mercy has followed me.
[1:33:57] So glad you
[1:33:59] found me
[1:34:03] and you set me free.
[1:34:07] [Music]
[1:34:09] So it's glad I'm
[1:34:12] yours,
[1:34:14] Lord. So glad I'm
[1:34:20] yours, oh so glad I'm yours. Listen,
[1:34:25] you're somebody's today. You got to
[1:34:28] decide whether you're God's or the
[1:34:31] devil. I still believe in good
[1:34:33] oldfashioned salvation.
[1:34:36] I believe in the works of God. I believe
[1:34:39] the Bible has found and I believe we've
[1:34:42] been given the truth in this end time.
[1:34:46] So glad you found me.
[1:34:52] Have you set He didn't just find you. He
[1:34:55] set you free.
[1:34:59] So glad I'm
[1:35:01] yours, Lord.
[1:35:05] So glad. Let's do it one more time.
[1:35:08] Think about it.
[1:35:11] So glad I'm yours, Lord.
[1:35:17] So
[1:35:18] glad I'm yours.
[1:35:20] Don't turn that voice
[1:35:22] down. That voice is trying to tell you,
[1:35:25] "Come unto me all that are labored and
[1:35:27] heavy laden, and I'll give you rest."
[1:35:30] Don't try to get in the way. The problem
[1:35:32] is we get in the way.
[1:35:35] Let's look to him. He said, "I am the
[1:35:37] way. I am the truth. And I am the life."
[1:35:40] Put all your burdens on him.
[1:35:43] Quit trying to figure it out.
[1:35:46] [Music]
[1:35:47] So glad I'm
[1:35:50] yours,
[1:35:52] Lord. So
[1:35:54] glad I'm yours.
[1:35:58] Amen. God bless you. We're still
[1:36:00] continue the service. We're just going
[1:36:01] to continue it downstairs. Everybody
[1:36:03] knows where the baptismal pool is.
[1:36:06] We're going
[1:36:07] to It's raining a little bit. Okay. They
[1:36:11] said it's supposed to get really bad
[1:36:12] about 1:00. So, let's just pray that we
[1:36:14] we're going to head down there now.
[1:36:16] Everybody just continue down. I'll
[1:36:17] change clothes and then we'll have the
[1:36:19] baptismal service. Anybody else wants to
[1:36:21] be baptized? We got plenty of water,
[1:36:22] plenty of um of towels and whatever you
[1:36:27] need. Then remember, when we get
[1:36:29] finished with that, we'll come back
[1:36:30] inside and we'll have some cake and ice
[1:36:32] cream for June's birthday. So let's bow
[1:36:35] our heads. Lord, thank you so
[1:36:36] much that you give us an opportunity,
[1:36:39] Lord, to speak to the purchased
[1:36:43] possession that you saw before the
[1:36:45] foundation of the world, they'd be
[1:36:46] standing here. Lord, I pray that you'd
[1:36:49] be with each one. Father, Lord, lead our
[1:36:51] lives, Lord. Be the center of everything
[1:36:53] we do. Father, be with us now as we
[1:36:56] continue down, Lord. Just stop the rain
[1:36:58] for a little while, Lord, so we can have
[1:36:59] the baptismal service. We ask it in
[1:37:02] Jesus name. Amen. God bless you. You're
[1:37:05] dismissed.
[1:37:09] Followed
[1:37:12] me and so glad you found
[1:37:18] me. Oh, and he set me
[1:37:24] free. I'm so glad I'm
[1:37:28] yours, Lord.
[1:37:31] So glad I'm
[1:37:36] yours. So glad I'm
[1:37:40] yours,
[1:37:42] Lord. So glad I'm yours.
[1:37:49] So glad your
[1:37:54] mercies has followed
[1:37:59] me. I'm so
[1:38:02] glad you found
[1:38:06] me and you set me
[1:38:12] free. So glad I'm
[1:38:15] yours, Lord.
[1:38:18] So
[1:38:20] glad you are.
