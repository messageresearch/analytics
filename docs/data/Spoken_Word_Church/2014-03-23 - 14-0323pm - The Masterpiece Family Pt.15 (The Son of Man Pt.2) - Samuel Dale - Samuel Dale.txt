him the Lord would bless him as he gets ready to minister unto us and we had a good time down at brother Collins's uh Friday night and brother Burley preach we had a good time there and fellowship with them and so just pray that the Lord would bless them also amen Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your love unto us and thank you for all things and we know that they are given unto us and they're free we don't have to worry about pray paying a price because there's no price we could pay for our Salvation it was already taken care of before we ever came into this world as human beings it was already finished Lord in your mind it was finished before the world we pray that you would just bless us Now guide us forgive us when we fail you because we know we do and we we sin Lord and we ask you to forgive us cleanse us and guide us and just keep us and just have your way with each and every one of us let your love be made manifest in our hearts and our lives in Jesus name amen Matthew 16 verse 13 when Jesus came into the coast of cesaria Philippi he asked his disciples saying whom do men say that I the son of man am they said some say that thou art John the Baptist some Elias others jeremias are one of the prophets he sath unto them but whom say ye that I am and Peter Simon Peter answered and said Thou Art the the Christ the son of the Living God now notice he asks him about son of man but he refers to him as Son of God all right remember he was to be son of man there through the church ages and time after salvation came he's dealing with Son of God so we'll go through that again in a minute so you just you know think about it they he asked them who the son of man was and Peter said Thou Art the Christ all right now watch and Jesus answered and said unto him blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for Flesh and Blood hath not revealed it unto thee see if he dealt with flesh and blood he' went back to son of man right and see it didn't do it said but my Father which is in heaven because it was a reason see he couldn't just jump right over to him he had to bring it forth in a dispensation and I say unto thee that thou art Peter and Upon This Rock I'll build my church and the Gates of Hell shall not Prevail against it what a wonderful church and I will give unto thee the keys of the king kingdom of heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in heaven whatsoever Thou shalt loose on Earth shall be loosed in heaven okay let's go over to Luke 17 and I want you to notice sometimes when you're hearing brother brand he gives you Luke 17 and that's the reason I'm using it because he'll say 17:20 just watch it in the message when he's given 17 instead of saying 1730 he'll say 1720 in a minute maybe he'll correct it and go to 17:30 but he doesn't he just goes on with the scripture we see I love the verse 20 then because look what it says and when he was demanded of the Pharisees because he preached so much about the kingdom of God you know this kingdom of God loen unto so many types and shadows which is the baptism of the Holy Ghost that was to come on the day of Pentecost right now and when he was demanded of the Pharisees these when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation you can't see it it's an inward experience all right neither shall they say low here or low there or behold the kingdom of God is within you now they argued over that through time that was it out here in the field was it here or was it Jesus or was it in Peter was it it wasn't in Peter it wasn't in nobody but Jesus at the time but it would be in in you see all right and he said unto the disciples the days will come when you shall desire to see one of the days of the son of man and you shall not see it and they shall say to you see here or see there go not after them nor follow them see somebody's going to say well he's over here he's over there he's here he's there what for as the lightning that lith out of the one part under Heaven shineth unto the other part under under heaven so shall also the son of man be in his days the future pointing but first must he suffer who son of man who he was di in other words he's saying but first I've got to suffer I've got to die because he can't be a kingdom if I don't die right because I've got everything within me and to give it to you I've got to die to release it all right but first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation and as it was in the days of Noah so shall it be also in the days of the son of man now look at the day where we're living if you can't place that where we're living to see the way that the world is look at the answer they did eat they drank that fits me and you right they married wives they were given in marriage until the day that the entering into the ark and the Lord came came and destroyed them all and now look at today where we are look at the marriage and divorce situation around the world look how people are going and doing likewise also as it was in the days of lot now what happened in lot sodomite condition right look at the world today so now he's saying this is going to be when the son of man comes into being likewise also as it were in the days of lot they did eat they drank they bought they sold they planted they Building look at the world today all right but the same day that lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and brim strong from heaven and destroyed them even thus shall it be in the day when the son of man is revealed you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing I told you it goes on to talk about the destroying of Jerusalem under Titus and taking place in ad70 all right but it comes into being where in the day when the son of man is revealed or made known okay and this is the hour this was the day down through the time they didn't deal with it the ages they didn't deal with it you know all of them didn't write about it it was in this day in the day when the son of man would be revealed but now he's got to be Son of God because that's what he was he was son of man on the earth he never declared himself publicly saying I'm the Son of God why because it was not the dispensation or time for him to do that he was a man came had to die for our sins but when he released that Holy Ghost out of him then it could come back upon the church all right then you would start another dispensation which would be the seven Church ages and it would be Son of God the holy ghost in the people all right that's why it's called Son of God all right but then he's to come back in the last days and the son of man is to be revealed all right the son of man who is this son of man we'll read in a minute in the beginning was the word according to the scripture in John 1 14 it says and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us all right so that was the Lord Jesus Christ all right I'm looking forward to the day and I believe that the word is being now made flesh you may not agree with that but I don't see why you would it was made flesh in Martin Luther the just shall live by faith was made flesh in the man because that was the word of the hour but not like it's to be here in the end time and it's to come back in the end time in restoration right all right we want to talk about restoration as the word being restored and we know the Holy Ghost was never eaten down it was the word that was eaten down in the ages but the Holy Ghost can only manifest himself according to what amount of word you have is that sensible you know you don't expect somebody to walk in and understand everything that's being said that's never hurt it because that's it's not in there so we have to do it that was why I was covering this morning the great things that your Prophet had to say about this end time but he wasn't just speaking down here where we are you remember I said this morning that he would come in that great prophet and everybody thought that brother brandom right just think about it listen to what he says on the message restoration of the Bride tree 62422 paragraph 506 you know what Martin Luther began to shine a little a light there was a little light just a very small strength of justification Al came Wesley stronger sanctification after Wesley come the stronger than him Pentecostals the baptism of the Holy Ghost and another great prophet right he says see he said well that was brother random then why does he continue on paragraph 508 he says but in the LI days of Malachi 4 Elijah is to come with the word the word of the Lord come to the prophet amen see so he what's he plainly saying another great prophet came on the day of Pentecost right amen but see no that was just a gift brother Dale well brother Brandon said it was another great prophet well that's up to you look what he says on questions and answers on the seals 63 324 he's talking about see he one of those ages only taking a dip into the Holy Spirit justification is the work of the Holy Spirit sanctification is the work of the Holy Spirit but the baptism is the holy spirit that's the reason it took a prophetic Prophet to come down listen to what he's saying right no Messenger to the age cuse the Holy Ghost came himself in his fullness of the baptism but at the end of the age as it always ends upon the others we find there then the messenger sent and all these Scruples and things are to be placed in their place see then the Rapture comes for the church how much PL could the man be but yet we've had people oh them was false well that's their dealing that's their problem that's not me I just believe what he said amen CU you see you'd have to come back to the fullness of the baptism before you could even talk about son of man how could Martin Luther talk about son of man surely he probably preached messages he was a great Theologian style you know and he probably preached things on son of man or something but where did they understand see a lot of people heard son of man but what is it developed into can you go on to see it all right well see we're in the day when the son of man is to be revealed that's right all right right we'll read to you after while brother around said I am not the son of man amen see if you made him the son of man you'd make him God you'd be dealing with deity that would be incorrect all right see because you you got to stay with the word amen all right so we went through this morning talking about in Revelations 1:13 where it says one like unto the son of man in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks all right and we went through that like and likeness as it was developing through the scriptures coming through Philippians and thing and coming over to the Book of Revelations we went back to Genesis 1 where it started and he made man in his own likeness not another person not another God that's right amen it's that same God revealed in another form that's why we don't believe in in Father Son and Holy Ghost Blessed Trinity that was never taught until the Catholic Church come along with it and developed it about 606 I tried to start it in 3:25 but it didn't work too good all right but you see we believe in one true and living God am and Jesus was that God in human flesh according to the scripture right he was God changing his form from the great spirit God coming down into flesh all right see then we started off on the day of Pentecost isn't it odd that it started or is it odd it started on the day of Pentecost with the Holy Spirit just like it started up in heaven as the great eternal spirit then he come down and condescended to the son of man well isn't it odd that he started in the church ages as Son of God Spirit right that's same as it was in the beginning it's just a repeat into the church ages bringing it down to the end all right right then we talked about that Luke 17 uh excuse me Genesis 126 and 27 as being God himself showing in mankind all right and then winds up in the end time as we're talking about the revelations 113 and looking from there to hear and seeing one like unto the son of man all right same likeness is the one that started it the same God the bride is just God made manifest in another form a husband and wife is a type of that right right why because the wife takes on the husband as being her head right and that they become one amen amen and and in doing that then you can see the beautiful story that in the end time God is showing his bride completed amen right and we see it before we get there yep amen right we don't have to wait to go to heaven to see what heaven is like we read the book of Revelations we hear the prophet's message we don't know what it looks like we don't know what we're going to look like right Bible says we don't know what we look but we we'll be like him we'll have a body like under his own glorious body amen so be beautiful wonderful time I kind of taxed it this morning voice is aggravating okay croak with me all right but think about it now seeing the bride 126 and 27 amen yes sir the very beginning seeing the bride completed right in Revelations 1:13 that's that's that to me is a glorious thing amen where we can show that see and over here you see Genesis you only see it in a singular form right let us make man but remember remember in terminologies when you say man or mankind uh you're not referring to just a gender of a male you know even in you're talking you'll say mankind well that doesn't just mean it ain't no man nothing but man that's right mankind means overall men women everything you know being as one all right then we see him there is one we see him over here in a mini membered body right that's the great revelation of Jesus Christ to be made manifest by you and I before we leave here that's not going to be no different than what the liest is here right that's the problem amen you remember years ago how long's it been I said this one time wait my Lord daddy 1995 19 and 95 okay that's quite a time ago I preached a series called matching pieces and I said the reason we're going to be able to get D is because he's already showed somebody there and when we match here what that is we'll go there that's right but you see our problem is we don't look at ourselves and realize that's what he's looking at we're looking for great things to happen when the greatest thing could happen is to somebody to realize who they are because you know why until Martin Luther realized who he was he had no results he was trying to convert the Catholic church right right he didn't want to leave the church and got his own writings he wanted to reform that's why it's called a Reformation he wanted to change the church and stay in the church right but yet you you understand what I mean he didn't have the great revelation of everything but he had the revelation of what he needed cuz he's going to be part of it all right and so will you and I because that's our day we are just making manifest the ending because the Bible says the end of all things has come upon us right that's amen all right so now if the end of all things is come upon us then the end of the Bible has come upon us for the Gentile dispensation right then it'll go to the Jews and go on down all right but we're looking at what we are now yes and when we match what he saw in Revelations 13 then we're going to go there right and it's like I've tried to tell you for 40 something years isn't it marvelous you got chapter one of Revelations and you can see that he's talking about God and his people then you go to chapter 2 and you start the church ages chapter 3 is the church age coming to Earth then chapter 4 he's going up right he shows us who we are and what we are before we ever leave here am right I mean that's a marvelous thing to me wouldn't it be something to be able to to to have enough money as the prophet said talking about the future home at time you know wouldn't it be something I've kind of got in my mind a little bit what my wife would like wouldn't it be something to have enough money to just not worry about it and now my wife you know she would tell you maybe something but she wouldn't like gold door knobs she would not like silver Chandelier she doesn't like chandeliers if I bought a house for her and had a chandelier and I tell the people I don't like the chandelier put me a big old light up there now she might turn around later and say hey I like the chandelier but you get what I mean her taste is not the fancy things but just put in place whatever is needed and make a place for everything cuz that's what she wants she gets upset when I take my keys out and my things and I lay them on the little dresser thing that's in the bedroom I never I figured out where she wants me to put them I guess back in my pocket but I don't know about that you know but she's always saying you're laying them things there I said they've been there for a week well I know her taste but wouldn't it be something to be able to build a house for your wife of what you could totally afford if we bought a house with that was two story we have to have an elevator she can't walk up down the steps okay there was a time she could run up and down the steps there was a time that she helped me build houses and she cared shingles up on the ladder on her own back of packs of shingles and and let them up on the house where I could put them on but see we're getting older okay but listen you understand my point yes God knows what we want he knows our desires a whole lot more right you know and I'm honest you know we're not rich we got a few dollars you know and we could afford to go out and eat you know and and things that we used to we couldn't afford I mean there was a time we couldn't afford to do I didn't know what a hamburger was till I got married and that's no joke we didn't raise cattle for for uh meat we raised cows for milk I knew what milk was but not what no beef was all right but what about just being able to now it's not even fun to go to Walmart it's not you know I mean my wife should in Walmart she pick up everything in there we were over it uh hamr one day and I talking to this man that's sitting there he said I tell you what or he's telling me this other man that said it he said I hope this place don't get robbed he said cuz my wife's fingerprints is on every item in here well that's the way you women are he like to do all of that stuff Us Men We Don't Give A hoot you know all right but listen amen just get a point to us to realize who we are is what God wants amen and the purpose we're here for yes right we're here the prophet says to prove to the devil yes that we won't fall like Eve did in the garden well you know somebody's going to do that amen somebody's going to fulfill the scriptures well why can't we believe we're just part of it that's all I'm talking to you about but now let's get to the point see this son of man now he walked on the earth years ago and he was God made manifest in human flesh all right but there come a time that he knew he would have to die and give his life and knew that was the purpose he came for all because there would be no way to get his life into you and I without first him making a way amen so he walked as the son of man upon the Earth he said the son of man don't even have a place to lay his ah head what about the God of Glory that to Bar a stable going to be born in First clothes were those swaddling clothes which is the things you put around that yoke of an ox to keep it from wearing the things we've done it many times when we were we were P plowing mules and things the old collar would wear out and brother H shaking his head we'd have to take stuff and pack it in the ho and run around CU if he didn't it would just cut the shoulders of the animals and things you know and they had to borrow that for him to be born be covered with but he done all of that for you and I that you and I could be saved amen amen he had to give his life for us to be able to live right and he couldn't just impart that by coming down and say I'll give it to you no right he had to make a way so that son of man had to die because there's no way to kill God we know that we understand so he didn't die as Son of God he didn't die as son of David he died as son of man and he released that life that he was a son of man to where he could be my brother my kin man My Savior My Healer all the things and he would be the son of man all right then when he was here in this life as I was quoting and I've been a lot he didn't call himself the unveiling of God paragraph 65 he could not call calling himself the Son of God because it wasn't that dispensation it wasn't that time he was the son of man prophesying to fulfill and reveal to them all the things that had been done and typed what he was he tyed all the way through the old test right all right so think about it now look what he goes on to say on the unveiling of God paragraph 68 he came first as the prophet and they crucified him his own crucified him he came as the son of man then after the Holy Spirit came he was then the Son of God God is a spirit he was the Holy Spirit Son of God he lived through the church ages as Son of God now in the Millennium he be son of David sitting upon the throne of his father you remember the promise to David promis to David that his son would sit on his Al on his throne he did Solomon sat on the throne right all but that was just speaking of the one that would sit on the throne see all right so if he's son of David he's going to be king of the earth that's the millennial right he'll be king of the earth and we'll Rule and reign with him according to the scripture all right but watch what he says and remember between the Son of God and the L you see in church age they put him out now whether you believe it or not but God has been put out of the church amen yeah now listen to the explanation they want him there as a Healer he's not put out like we say the word put out cast out they want him as a Healer they want him as a savior but they don't want him to be God of their life Israel wanted Jesus Christ when he first went out read your Bible right he was very popular because he could heal sick he could raise the dead he could feed 5,000 with just a little bit of boy's food you know man wouldn't it be great today to have a guy like that in the economy we wouldn't have to worry about Obama but think about it but he changed his form see between the Son of God words in the Leo and age they put him out and then Luke he said he would be revealed again as son of man the prophet for fulfilling the rest of it see the scriptures tie perfectly together son of man Son of God Son of David what was it it's the same God all the time just changing his form in morphe he just changes it's a great drama he is acting it out but see when you read and you we'll read you know like in the last days fulfilling the the son of the prophet fulfilling the rest of it everybody locks on brother brandom they just stop and they've made him God they've made him deity they've made him everything and and and I'm I'm I I don't believe that there's only one true and living God he was not the son of man the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ if you make him this son of man you've made him deity come on on now we believe what he T cuz that's what we believe thank God for it but yet we don't make him God we make him a human being that God was using all right so then think about what he's saying the same God all the time just changing his form that's the same God then when you was talking to this Prophet here he's not talking about just the prophet Malachi for or whatever he was the prophet he was the god of the prophets when you say Jeremiah prophesy son of man the man's lips moved but to God spoke through his lips right to the mankind amen right it wasn't God standing there God was using the man to speak but the man wasn't God it was a human flesh so is it with brother random that's where we have to we keep it in the right order but look what he says now on God's provided place of worship 65 425 paragraph 195 look what he says now Jesus himself at the day when the son of man is being revealed in other words the son of man the ministry of Jesus Christ himself okay now in the last days a man came with the ministry of Jesus Christ we believe that all right but that didn't make the man Jesus Christ now watch the church will come through justification through Luther through sanctification ation through Wesley through the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the Pentecostals and go right on into the Perfection of the son of man now he says the church will that when husband and wife will be the same self persons husband and wife becoming one Christ and church becoming one right God will be so manifested into his bride his church till they will both be the same there are one and you see where we at you can't separate God from his people because that's where it's at he's living in his people all right you see what he's talking about God will manifest himself into his bride I preached this in 1969 in Athens Georgia and I done then just what I'm saying and doing now I keep coming back say wait just a minute people's mind is locked on son of man William brandham William Brandon was not the son of man that's right now label me whatever you want to but he was not the son of man he said he was we'll read it in a minute but he said the bride would be the son of man brother Brown is part of the Bride now when we finish this part I will ask for a raise of hands you remember this morning you believe you're born again I believe that amen believe you saved I believe that believe you got the Holy Ghost I believe that you believe that the fullness of the godhead bodies in right your hand goes down you don't want to go that far but that's what he said amen well who are us to deny What God Says About Us right yeah we think of a Perfection we think of a something and when I do I think of the Jehovah the Old Testament busied himself with the children of Israel and they were nothing but garbage cans that's right David had one of his mighty men life taken from him to get his wife right but yet the Bible said he's a man after my own heart you mean God is a murderer no that was David on his home way home from basba that was the woman he took he cries out and he said Lord restore unto me the joy of thy salvation amen that he knew he didn't have none but he had an honest and a contrite heart right and out of all that Israel was doing till even balam would try to show and say look in the Bible says the hinder Parts what does it mean the hinder Parts is the most vulgar things you could see and he was trying to show him what Israel was doing running around with the moabites right every kind of thing even having a meeting one day and Moses was telling them to get rid of the moabites a guy goes by Leading the moabit right to his tent while he's telling them to get rid of him you know what a guy done he just took him a spear and he just walked behind him and killed them both y right God says thank you for doing that right but you see we look at it as my point is we look at it we've got to be to a certain thing the certain thing we got to be at is to not reject God's word right that's it no leaven you remember no leaven among her brings the fullness of the godhead bodily into the bride you remember that quote right what is leav denominational doctrines you know that God don't see our little silly sissified ways thank God he don't if he did he'd have to kill every one of us come on but he can't come over that atonement that he made brother rham when bam was trying to show that to to him there you know and B and all that to hinder Parts the worst thing he said he just didn't see the shout of the king in the camp God comes down every day and fellowships with you and I in our garbage can conditions oh but brother Dale don't tell me I'm a no you're double garbage can when you think you're not a garbage can is that the best way to say it it's just as garbage can to be human but when we think we're so righteous and holy you know that God can't save somebody that's righteous and holy come on is when you admit that and try to get rid of it and save you all right get off and go on brother Dale I'll try to but do you see what I'm talking about the Bride of Jesus Christ is to manifest in the last days the son of man look at what he says on the next message which is a trial number nine 64 427 paragraph 267 Jesus Christ is yesterday today and forever and he's identifying himself as he promised much more could we say in these last days as son of man making himself known among his people well well that's brother Brown made manifest among the people now read the rest of the sentence among his people in the form of his people all right see not Son of God not son of David but son of man Son of God was a supernatural think about it look at the next one unveiling of God 3:14 through 3:15 think about these things now paragraph 314 3:15 but God is still there to make that that just the sign notice what does it do it finally returns back to the original seed again you remember that son of man died went into the ground son of man comes back okay you remember all we went through the seat when he come in the form of Martin Luther when he come in the form of John Wesley when he come in the form of the Pentecostals he is supposed to reveal we say these are right right we believe that he come back there but do we believe this he is supposed to reveal himself again like the same seed went in the son of man he revealed himself as Son of God through the stock age and so forth but in this last age he's to reveal himself as son of man again get it congregation says amen all right like the beginning molded and what does that stalk what does that stalk grow it's growing all the time that little stalk grows still it's not like the original grain you know when you plant corn your shoots come up got a feel of corn but what are you looking at you got a couple of stalks you've not got nothing you can eat cows might can but you can't what does that stock grow it's growing all the time that little grow still it's not like the original grain never was Luther's message no Along come the other messages finish sanki KNX Calvin on down none of them there were still the message but they were still the message but what it was they didn't get the complete revelation of it cuz it wasn't time you can't put the ear on the corn before it's time to come and then finally there comes back again the original seed that went into the ground all right see what he think of him what he saying look at this one this is unveiling of God paragraph 318 through 320 but I want you to think about these things now to the perfect after the stalk has been formed after the tassel has been formed after the grain has come into the cob then has to come to Perfection back to a regular grain again brother Ray gave me something the other day about you know that ever I'm not talking about deformed I'm talking about regular corn okay every corn ears got the same amount of kernels rings and that you know it's amazing how things are so beautiful but look grain is coming to the cob and it has to come to Perfection back to a regular grain again and remember the grain must be gerti if it don't it won't live see none of us out none of that outside of them messages will ever come to life it has to be gered to it but remember the same life that was in the stalk is in the grain but it's just maturing itself right back see he revealed himself what son of man the grain that went into the ground to get the message what went into the ground son of man do you get the message he said all where lost it come that's original grain now what did he revealed himself next in a different form stalk and T and so forth and all of these everything he revealed himself then what Same Spirit but in a different form see but what's the L of that corn it comes back to the original grain is that right and his ministry comes from them reformations back to the original word again the word comes to a prophet and he promised it in Malachi 4 and to restore the faith of the people back to the original grain what went in the ground is here the same now you argue with him the grain is come up through here it come up as Son of God that reveals itself here as son of man and then it revealed itself as son of David on the throne see them three sons just exactly the original grain all right now who is this son of man all right who is this son of man all right let's read and see who it is go ahead with it's the rising of the sun paragraph 93 Now who is the son of man he tells you who it is in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwell he said and the Son of God is alive again with the baptism of the Holy Ghost right among us and that's giving life think about it who is this son of man go ahead with 12a proving his word I'll give these later again but proving his word 1964 816 paragraph 222 and the son of man is revealing himself in the same power that he was not down to the church age through justification sanctification all these things here but the son of man who is the son of man the word who are we talking about the word the word is what's sharper than the two-edged right go on the anointed ones at the end time paragraph 269 I handed these into them extra so all right and look what he says it isn't me it wasn't the seventh angel oh no it was the manifestation of the son of man it wasn't the angel his message it was a mystery that God unfolded it's not a man is God the angel was not the son of man he was a messenger from the son of man the son of man is Christ he is the one that you're feeding on you're not feeding on a man his words will fail but you're feeding on the unfailing body word of the son of man who is this son of man in the beginning was the word the word was made flesh I thought that was what we claim to believe amen go on to 13 let me try to get some of this reading done all right this is taken from the trial paragraph 164 now what did he promise to be what what did he promise to a vindicate himself in a man a human flesh like he did to Abraham when the son of man it would be the son of man not not not not the Son of God now all right here stands brother random and God is using the man that's right to speak outwardly if it's the word that's being spoken then the word is the son of man that's right that's right if it's the word today being spoken the word is the son of man that's right right that's right that's that's not you know and he can use anybody to speak that's right he used a donkey to correct a prophet that's right right he used a rooster to Crow to correct Peter or remind him of what went wrong it's not the person it's the god that you're talking about not not the Son of God now the Son of God in a son of man did you read it the Son of God in a son of man in Ezekiel the first chapter second verse Jehovah called Ezekiel the son of man exactly what Jesus called himself you understand that through the teaching of the weak now we see what is the son of man prophetic what was Miki for to be a prophet what were was these things to happen in the last days now he never said when he said they would happen and they did now you if he is still the Son of God the son of man ready to be revealed in the last days on the throne of David as the son of David see watch then he if that's not ready if if that's right he promised that he's obligated to his word he's obligated to to that word so whatever he says is going to be is going to be that's right we should have at least realize that much whatever go to the next this is taken from the Mighty God unveiled before us and he's explaining Jesus Moses coming Moses Veil now Moses what was it was the Living Word to the people do you have any problems with that no Moses was the Living Word right it was coming through him I didn't make him anything that's right it was the god using the man but God looks at him and says you're the word to the people he said Moses Moses says wait a minute I can't go got this speech ined problem is it okay Moses he I'll show you what I'll do now read your Bible if you don't we'll get in it and read it he said Moses you're going to be God to the people he said I can't talk he said okay I'll just make Aaron your Prophet that's what the Bible says that's right Moses would stand down there probably look around he said and I'm not joking or making fun he Aon tell them go some form of a problem with speech Aaron turned around and said flies fleas frogs that's right brother around him was the voice he said I'm just the one he uses that's the same as all of us that's right does it make you anything to think that you're a child of God that's the greatest thing that could make you but I mean does it make you bigheaded well you see them I used to get tickled back years ago you'd be sitting in rinds or sitting somewhere here come a guy in I punch a wife he's preacher and he comes strutting in I want a nonsmoking place y'all remember that loud moue preacher he wanted everybody in there to know he's a preacher right does it make you anything because God chose you to be a Christian right no it makes you humble you know as Pastor I am your servant that's a Bible that's the way that I do it comes to painting the church it comes to cleaning the church I don't have no problems with it that's what a brother said one day when we had a bathroom problem I just came in asked him to help me oh we needed to figure out something I didn't expect him to do it I took a saw whack that pip in two that was full of you okay all over me he looked at me and he said ain't a person in your church that'll do that that's what he said now you are give I had to go get the pipe at the plumbing place of course I was welcomed they wanted to get me out of there in a hurry because I stunk but I'm a servant that's right right take all of you out to eat at one time I'm a servant I just want to do my job I just want to be what he wants me to be that don't make me big you're a preacher I don't even tell people I'm a preacher we a deer hunting with people now I don't even tell them it's kind of like my brother he's he's a Methodist preacher he he he's got pretty bad mouth and things but he going to couple of guys went down to a place to to hunt quail and they found out the preacher was coming with somebody one of his members so when they got there there was two guys you know they're supposed to take one of each one and this guy he looks over my brother and he said hey you come on go with me well my brother Marshall he goes with the guy well old guy's dog wasn't doing too good so old guy was kicking the dog cussing it raising K you know what he said after a while he said you see why I didn't want that preacher to come I already had him winning I don't go around telling everybody I'm a preacher because I don't what's it what is it I'm a servant Why Can't We Believe like live like that see then we're not looking at brother randam as being something great other than what God brought him you talk about me buying people's food they said you couldn't take a ticket away from him did he get in line he get that ticket some way and the man didn't make nothing but I'm just saying the man fulfilled his office God used the man but God was using his voice to speak you remember the message quote you are not hearing William brandham I'm just using his voice to speak amen will you say well that's making him something David sit down there and sing play that harp and say they pierce my hands and my feet just exactly like he was going to be on Calvary the dogs wag their tail at me like he was hanging on Calvary this is not to make you and I something great but let's just be what he made us oh come on that's right look Moses veil was the Living Word to the people today Jesus Veil is the same Living Word to the people that Jesus in the church the Holy Ghost the Son of God in the people revealing the word by the promise of his day makes it exactly the same go ahead to the next you see church I'm just trying to get you an i to see who we are and what we here for amen I have heard but now I see paragraph 188 look what he says we've heard of it with the ears now we see it with our eye amen do you believe it all our hearts inspiration all in that day when the son of man is being revealed the son of man Jesus Christ made manifest amongst his people well yeah brother there we saw it back there now what's the thing the prophet said was our problem looking back or looking forward God used a man but I just read he said you're not feeding on the words of a man you're feeding on the body word of the son of man was brother random the son of man no no go ahead I've got a bunch more coming up on the next message so don't think this is all of it you on the internet if you want to listen to the rest of it it'll be when I get through and when I get preaching on you'll hear it but watch paragraph 260 of the message called the anointed ones at the end time in the day that the son of man is revealed Revelations 10: 1-7 read it when you get home now brother randam says and I'll be glad to give you Revelations 10:1 is the same as Revelations 1:13 now that's his word I'll get it in the next message right but see Revelation 101 to7 oh that's brother randam he said it was the same as Revelations 1:13 amen which is bride form right Revelation 10 1-7 read it when you get home the seven angels message opening up the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man right but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you and I understand I mean if you walked with that man just the people I've talked to personally that had personal experiences if you walked with a man I mean every day you walked with him and you talked with him and he look at you and he' just tell you what's going what happened something what it is or what it is what you know I mean You' get to looking at him as God I'm not throwing no slangs at a Catholic church but there's a guy ain't even got no signs or whatsoever and they call him God right well here's a man that could stand there and tell you your whole life there was a time that they had some Indians that they couldn't prove because they were trying to get them set up on the government you know to to do and none of them knew when their birthday was CU it didn't Mount nothing to them but when they come down to start trying to draw from the government they required that they know their birthday they told brother brandom now this is the story related he said bring them in they brought them in he went right down the line told every one of them when their birthday was it's I just guessed they got their monies that's all right do what you want to guessing or whatever you want to call it that's right right remember the story about the time that he was there I know brother M them told us about it but it was during while they was there not to them but he was in a discernment line and he called out this person and he said you you live it so and so and so and so boy out the service is over they come running around that he's wrong we know that man the man was standing there he said what said you don't live there he said I just moved there you see if we saw that every day I've had trouble here and I had to publicly denounce it that some of you have said I was a prophet and I publicly from here denounced it twice I've done it why because just the little things of of the ministry get that Ministry out get that person off your mind get the ministry on your mind thank God for what he's used this old dumb Georgia a bunch of clay to use but it don't make me nothing I'm a servant most people you tell them that the church thinks they're Prophet you can't get their head through that door it's a big right this is not set on a man we're not building brother around him up god build him up sir he proved who he was look what he says the S Angels message opening of the seals what is it not the angel is the son of man the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it separated now that's where it seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but the seventh angel the seventh messenger is revealing to the public the son of man because it's left the shook it can't organize it it's the grain itself again one more and we'll quit this is questions and answers 1964 paragraph 291 let's see one minut yeah okay we got it and well we got a 101 up there for some reason but that's the have two in here it's up right way it goes but it's paragraph all some say brother brandham is the son of man now this was a question I thought the pillar of fire was the son of man am I mistaken well that's a good question very good but I am not not the son of man but a son of man there's quite a difference Jesus Christ was the son of man the Son of God the son of man the son of David now if that ain't enough for us to get it settled of his own words of what he said then you can't settle it anyway and quotes I ain't going to convert nobody I told you that we started while ago people are still going to believe but look what he goes on to say I am not the anointed son of man he wasn't watch him about the word Prophet now I want you to think about it and then you think i' I degrade him I want to show you how great that we put him and God puts him now I wish we could hold off and maybe you don't read the bottom of that how many times have you ever heard brother around say say I'm a prophet you know you believe me to be a prophet he said now the prophet means this new testament preacher is the word Prophet have you ever read the rest of it look what he says because you want to give it in terms a prophet in the English term is merely a preacher anybody knows that get the dictionary see a prophet is a preacher under the English dictionary but under the Hebrew are the Greek a prophet is a sear one who foresees things and foretells things but under the English interpretation a prophet is a Seer now you know what he's saying go under the English a prophet is a preacher right under the Hebrew and in the Greek a prophet is a Seer a lot of difference between being a preacher and a prophet that's why I've denounced to here I am not a prophet I don't have the ministry of a prophet if I don't have the ministry of a prophet why am I going to try to sell everybody what I got you said well the word comes to the prophet quote Church a book the word comes and spirit fail right that's right amen don't you believe the word Came To You by way of brother Brandon right but he said I'm not the anointed son of man he said Jesus is son of man Son of God Son of David now if brother Brandon was son of man you'd have to read that this way Jesus was Son of God and Son of David brother randam was son of man we make light of the Catholic church I don't say I do but I most people make light of the Catholic Church they're saying they got a pope that is in God's stad and really he's not saying that he says he's instead of God but you make Li of that but probably at least 50% of the people following this message as elevated brother brandom into the position that they make him greater than even the pope elevates himself you see why I'm against all that I'm not against the pope he's a fine guy I no problems with him he can be what he wants to you can play what you want to you're a free moral agent that's right right but it's what I've got to believe that's what I preach the god I see that I've seen all my life to see him I want to follow him and then that way you won't exalt yourself you'll exalt the other person a good orator every you may big old words a good speaker a good speaker if you got any sense at all if he ain't ain't a good speaker but if he's a good speaker he'll Elevate you right he'll Elevate you right right a good speaker is one who gets the contact you wonder sometimes why I life in some sermons and some I don't but you see a lot of the things that I've said you'll never forget if I had have brought out the illustration of my brother and what he thinks you know that you'll remember that more than you will remember any of the other things I said anybody's got any sense as an orator tries to get you involved in what they're doing you remember that brother brother dick that said and you watch it the preacher preacher will say okay now now now brother Mar you get the scripture of this and brother randam does it and he'll say Brother Gary now you get this scripture sister so and so you get this scripture what's he doing he's getting you involved in his message brother Ernie vill Anda is a perfect orator because that's what he does he gets you involved you remember better that way that's true you not not remember a thing that happened brother Gary remember I read that one scripture I'm just trying my best to get you to see Jesus Christ what good would it do to see him in me other than can help you for God to help you brother R said the gift will never heal nobody but yet he lived so close to God until he said you bring me 24 cases your worst cases and I'll guarantee you healing for every one of them I ain't going to open my mouth that way because I can't guarantee it but there's been times that I've walked out here and said it won't rain till I call for it then I came back to the pull pit and I said you better roll up your windows and your cars going to rain tonight and it did that doesn't make me anything it makes a great God Amen because you can have all of those gifts and still be lost I just want to see everybody saved am I don't care who it is right hell wasn't made for people the Bible said hell was made for the devil and his angels people are going to be trespassers there do you understand what I'm saying come on Brothers the son of man is the Lord Jesus Christ brother brandom is not the son of man you said well you keep saying and youve said it over and over that he he was not the son of man but we're going to be the son of man I didn't say that I correct you brother Bram said it I'm smart enough to not be a dummy I read you what brother bandam says he's the one that said the bride would be the fullness of the godhead bodily he's the one that said the red on grain be restored in the bride he's the one that says the bride is the son of man so now you got to argue with him you see I believe the ministry of Jesus Christ is here today around the world but not in one person no way it's around the world we've only got our little part so let's manifest our little part let's stand go ahead brother think on these things upon the Lord you'll sing on I've lost my voice he'll come back in a few minutes I'll be able to sing think about it giv all the honor and glory to Jesus Christ not to anybody but Jesus Christ thank God how many of you have ever thank God for the church you come from don't bless God Bo I tell you what I hated it you stayed there 30 years and hated it I have told the people of the churches I come from that I thanked them I thank the old brother that was the pastor in the Baptist Church when I left thank you for helping me I've had a lot of problems in this and have been in the message but I've always had the ability to say brother I thank you for helping me can you
