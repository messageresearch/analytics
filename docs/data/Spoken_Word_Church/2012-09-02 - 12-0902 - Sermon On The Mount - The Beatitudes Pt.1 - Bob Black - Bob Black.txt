TRANSCRIPT
========================================
turn over to Matthew chapter 4 and a while back um we were on the the genealogy in Matthew and comparing that with the genealogy in Genesis and talking about the son of David and how Matthew presents him as the king and sets up a new kingdom and that's what I kind of wanted to talk about this this morning a real just simple lesson that kind of goes through the Beatitudes and um The Sermon on the Mount so let's talk uh started in Matthew chapter 4 about verse 12 and remember Matthew is the 40th book in the Bible which sets the the um the theme is is like probation what will you do with this Jesus called Christ and um Matthew is the most maybe the most Jewish book of of the New Testament because it's it's presenting Christ to the Jews in fact um Jesus said in um Matthew 15:24 I'm not sent but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel when the sister came up and asked him for healing for her her child and he called her a dog she said I'm not sent but to the lost sheep of the House of Israel she said but even the dogs eat the crumbs from the master's table and um so this whole think about the theme of Matthew is he's presenting the New Kingdom that he's going to set up not a kingdom that's different than what everyone was expecting and um and the Jews were given a period of what what are you going to do with this new kingdom that this new uh what what's being presented to you and they as we all know they turned it down and Cru um so let's kind of start reading through starting at verse 12 just to kind of set it up as we go into The Sermon on the Mount now when Jesus had heard that John was cast into prison he departed into Galilee and leaving Nazareth he came and dwelt in capernium which is upon the Sea Coast in the borders of zabulon and Neal that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by Isaiah the prophet saying the land of zabulon and the land of Nealon by the way of the sea Beyond Jordan Galilee of the Gentiles the people which sat in darkness saw great light to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up from that time Jesus began to preach and to say repent for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand so let's take a little second and U this might be very basic but um I think it sometimes it's good to just kind of review the basics about what is the kingdom of heaven and so let's turn over to Luke 17 you know J Jesus is let's turn to uh Luke 17:20 his his teachings were very paradoxical when you get into the sermon of the mount it how can you be blessed and be poor how can you be blessed and be um uh you all the different things that he through the Beatitudes how can you be blessed and mourn can you be blessed and reviled it seems like something that uh doesn't quite make sense because his ways are not our ways and um so when you when you think about the Kingdom of Heaven we've got to be part of a kingdom that before we can go into the Kingdom of Heaven the kingdom must be in us first it seems backwards it seems a little bit um than the way we would normally think so Luke 1720 and when he was demanded of the Pharisees when the kingdom of God should come he answered them and said the kingdom of God cometh not with observation because this is what all of the all of the that area of the of the world was looking for was something somebody to ride in with a sword and take over from the Romans they were being impressed by the Romans they were looking for somebody to just change things change set up something natural but it wasn't something natural neither shall they say Lo here or low there for behold the kingdom of God is within you and John chapter 3 let's turn over there real quick chapter 3:3 when he spoke to Nicodemus and this is Nicodemus just couldn't quite understand because it was such a paradox and verse one there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the same came to Jesus by night and said unto him Rabbi we know that thou are a teacher come from God for no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with him and remember when Peter presented the keys to the kingdom in Acts chapter 2 he said this Jesus who was approved of you and brother bam said the way he was approved was because that before them all he did Miracles he he healed him before them all remember the first pull was healing um a pull drawing you into a Clos relationship with God that uh everyone could observe and uh so he was approved before them all no man can do these Miracles that thou doest except God be with it Jesus answered and said unto him verily verily I I say unto thee except a man be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God and we know see doesn't mean see like big buildings or something of a kingdom but to understand that's really the true evidence of the Holy Ghost is to be able to understand the word you can know all these scriptures when it when it really begins to come alive to you then that's his evidence that he's he's been born in you and opened his word to you Nicodemus he goes on Nicodemus just couldn't understand nus said unto him how can a man be born when he is old can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born Jesus answered verily verily I say unto thee except a man be born of water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the kingdom of God so let's go back to Matthew 4 and keep reading and Jesus Verse 18 and Jesus walking by the Sea of Galilee saw two Brethren Simon called Peter and Andrew his brother casting a net into the sea for they were Fishers and he saith unto them follow me and I will make you fishes of men and they straightway left their Nets and followed him and going on from then he saw two other he saw other two Brethren James the son of Zebedee and John his brother a ship with Zeb their father mending their Nets and he called them and they immediately left the ship and their father and followed him we know brother brand talked about how that this wasn't just all of a sudden they just heard this call all at once but all their life their father Zebedee had been teaching them about the coming Messiah about who to look for so they weren't uh they had been taught all their life this wasn't just a drive by witness and they immediately left the ship shiping their father and followed him cuz this is the one that they had been looking for all their life and Jesus went about all Galilee teaching in their synagogues and preaching the gospel of the kingdom and healing all manner of sickness and all manner of disease among the people and his Fame went throughout all Syria and they brought unto him all sick people that were taken with divver diseases and torments and those which were possessed with devils and those which were lunatic and those that had the py and he healed him his first pull was healing and now I've been kind of reading through FF Bosworth's book on Healing The Sick and U not to get too much off the topic but you know brother R said nobody could explain healing like brother Bosworth and he kind of laid out how if you if you look through through all the New Testament and um let me back like up a second you know we've all got script verses that really mean so much to us U and maybe uh different we each have maybe a different verse like brother Wade always says Genesis 126 and 27 is a verse scripture that really stands out to him for me um you know Colossians 1: 12627 stands out to me but one of the most critical scriptures to understand in all of scripture is Hebrews 138 because if you can find something where uh God did it one way you can follow that all the way through scripture know that he'll do it the same way if you can stand if you can approach him the same way and that's how healing is if you can see if you can approach him the way that they approached him when he walked on the Sea of Galilee then you know he's the same today that he was back then and you can it's like a rock that you can rest on and if you examine the scripture and see there's not one time when anyone approached him for healing that he turned them away and you can say what about the little Samaritan woman that he called a dog she persevered and it didn't take long but she got what she came for there's not one time in scripture where anybody came for healing that didn't get it and you know we've got many sick and Afflicted and I just this this has always helped me when I uh when I was um years ago I right right before Estel was born um I I got laid off from my job and I didn't have a job I was in the hospital when she was being born and I just Hebrews 138 came to mind that he's still the same that he was back there on when he walked the shores and I rested on that knowing that he will provide for us the same way today that he did back then right excuse me and this continuing on there followed him great multitudes I was afraid I was going to get emotional they followed in great multitudes of people from Galilee and from decapus and from Jerusalem and from from Judea and from Beyond Jordan and coming to church this morning we were list to the attraction on the mount and this is getting on moving into chapter 5 where brother Brandon where where Jesus went up the mountain and he was all the multitude followed him because they had seen the signs and wonders that he did in their midst and whenever God's word is being fulfilled it always attracts people because people are looking for to see God word being made manifest so he went up the mountain and all of the multitudes from the East and from the West were gathered to hear and Break Forth the word chapter 5 verse one and seeing the multitudes he went up into a mountain and when he was set his disciples came unto him now this going up into the mountain is is ties together with the Old Testament cuz remember in the Old Testament God came down on the mountain when Moses went up and he delivered the Commandments to to Moses he delivered the Old Testament law so now God Jesus has going up the mountain to deliver the the law for a new kingdom that he's setting up and you think well the Old Testament law that was delivered from Moses is now being done away with you look back through the all the Ten Commandments and you think well examine them and see if any of the Ten Commandments were done away with not not a single one you think well okay now we don't have to keep any particular day look that's that's one of the most misinterpreted Commandments the Sabbath now we rest every day because we're in an eternal Rest In Christ and so God on the on the mountain he set up he came this this Sermon on the Mount is to set up um it's the first really recorded long uh it's the longest message recorded in the in the New Testament that he delivered and it's the um the one he kind of sets in order the kind the character of the people that are going to be in in the New Kingdom and how we're going to be in how we're going to be part of that new kingdom and what it's all about and then he opened his mouth verse two and and taught them say now that's a that's a very powerful scripture he opened his mouth because we know that the spoken word is the Original Seed oh yeah and that's you know brother brand talked about why there's not a lot of new births or why why we people aren't born again is because they're not taught wrong if you take anything out of the of the word or add anything to it then you don't have a Foundation that the spirit can water that the spirit can bring to life and he opened his mouth and taught them so think about this the same one that spoke back before the worlds were created and created the world put the moon and the stars and everything in the place separated the light from the darkness is the same one that was sitting there opening to them the way to enter into the New Kingdom into this Kingdom that all down through the Old Testament they had been looking for and here he was standing before him all down through the Old Testament he had been hidden in uh in Moses and Elijah and finally he's revealed before him the revelation of his word and the spoken word is the Original Seed 1962 brother R said now remember every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the Original Seed it will breede itself right back and reproduce itself again I breed it it dies now that's a real short quote but that is so powerful because that that is um that's like the foundation of everything that we believe you stay with the with the original word and that will see you through if you get away from it at all it can never go back to the original which is what the the whole Plan of Redemption is trying to get us back to fellowship with God to be part of him and if you get away from it one bit that's why it it um we're going to get into blessed are the those that mourn and it it Grieves me to see to talk to people that it it seems like it's not um it's staying with the word is not as valuable to many people as it seems like it used to be and you know looking around there's been we've all heard the reports of many people that um or now they're saying well brother brandom didn't know didn't know what he was talking about that he couldn't get it in the straight in line and I was listening we were listening to that sermon this morning the attraction on the mount where he said that critics that the things that people say are we don't have no argument with them we have one goal goal in life and that is to soak in the word and get closer to him that that don't let it bother you the things that other people do but we're on a path to something greater and our main goal in life it should be to soak it in and get closer to God soak up his word because if we take in the spoken word The Original Seed it will take us back to the original see where am and he opened his mouth and taught them say blessed are the poor in spirit for theirs is the kingdom of heaven now the all these Beatitudes are really simple it seems like we've all we've all grown up with these Beatitudes in the back of our Bible you know there's a place for the Ten Commandments a place for the Beatitudes but you know when God comes and opens his word to you then it just takes on a whole different meaning you see you can see Christ and you can see yourself and you know Christ has revealed in Simplicity and a lot of times we think it has to be um is so complicated but really when you get down to it the message of Salvation is just really simple because the people that God called are really simple people the people that will accept it not intellect schs or um people with u big degrees and whatnot but just really simple people that can receive it to be poor in spirit is to realize that I have nothing that I am nothing and can do nothing and have need of all things now that's not quote from Brother Brown that's something that Minister aw pink wrote that I thought was really good and that you know part the one of the hardest things for new Christians to realize is that when you become first become a Christian you think well I'm going to be I'm I'm going to be good enough to be saved I'm going to be good enough to be worthy enough but that's not how it works when God gives you a revelation that there's no way for you in any way to be good enough then you you are poor in spirit you you got that Revelation that the only one that can take you into the kingdom of God and move you up the stature of the perfect man is God himself so the poor in spirit are those that realize that in themselves they can't do it the poor in spirit are those that are hungering and thirsting for the word god brother talked about in the message thirst that there's a there's two kinds of thirst there's a natural thirst and there's a spiritual thirst and you you got that control tower that kind of tells you you need something something and this spiritual thirst draws you to what you need which is God poor in spirit he talked about Lazarus how he was poor in spirit he didn't have anything of the world but he made an investment now there's another Paradox for you how can somebody who has nothing make an investment if you don't have anything like you got to have money before you can make an investment put it in the bank but he had nothing but he was able to make an investment in Christ because he put everything that he had everything into an investment in the things that were not of this world but the things that are Beyond of the the world Beyond and the rich man the rich uh man he put all his investment in the things of this world right when he went uh when he went to see the uh Lazarus in the B bosom of Abraham he saw what Lazarus investment had had got him because Lazarus in himself he couldn't do anything all he had to do was all he could do was just lay outside the rich man's house and beg but God gave him something that in himself he could never have have have achieved the opposite of what Pharaoh said in Exodus 5:2 who is the Lord that I should obey his voice and that's really a problem with why it's so hard you know he said this easier for a rich man uh for a rich man for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to go into the into the Kingdom of Heaven because a rich man puts all of his uh not that it's bad to have money but a rich man is more has more of a tendency to put all of his um he invests in the things of this world instead of um things Beyond and John Wesley said those that know they can't do it by theirself and you're broken up ready to be molded into the character of Jesus Christ and that kind of goes into pouring a contrite heart and a contrite heart is one that's broken so let's look it and we'll just finish up in just a second look look at Psalm 51 verse 16 now all the Old Testament everybody in the Old Testament probably thought what God was really after is for me to just bring an animal what God was really after is in verse 16 for thou desirest not sacrifice else I would give would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a contrite heart of God thou will not despise that's another Paradox because that's what God demanded for those sacrifices exactly and I've got quote in here somewhere about how um even even even today you know people come to church without a broken a contrite heart and just sit there and expect just like they did in the Old Testament come dragging up their sacrifice thinking well I've sinned and I'm just going to offer my sacrifice and that's going to be the end of it but God was looking for somebody that was repentant that was truly sorrowful for that mourned for the sin that they had done in their was in their lives that wanted to that could look past their sacrifice toward the holy of holies and think oh God if I could just get in in there where God is and that's what he's really after somebody that wants fellowship with God not just to go through the motions of going to church and bring in your sacrifice and lay it on the altar just because somebody tells you that's what you have to do but somebody that craves after Fellowship see where I am let's look at I well I'll just read this one Isaiah 66 veres 1-2 thus sayth the Lord the heaven is my throne and the Earth is my foot stol where is the house that you build unto me and where is the place of my rest for all those things hath mine hand made and all those things have been sayith the Lord but to this man will I look even to him that is poor and of a contrite spirit and trembleth at my word so that I think the theme of that is that's wonderful that you build a house where all men of the Earth can come and fellowship and and uh Fellowship around the word but what I'm really after is somebody that's broken in their heart that's yearning for a closer walk with me with with God and the message Investments um this is the quote about Lazareth I'll just read it real quick and then we'll finish and Lazarus suppor and spirit lay there with not even enough medicine to take care of himself and the dogs licked his sore but one night he they both died and when they died the Bible say said that the poor in spirit was carried by Angel Paul Bears to the bosoms of Abraham the one had invest made him his investment in eternal life he didn't live for what he had here for his popularity he had none he was a beggar at the gate he had nothing he had no money he had nothing he had no friends but yet he was a Believer he had made his investment and he died on the street with the dog licking his sores and the body
