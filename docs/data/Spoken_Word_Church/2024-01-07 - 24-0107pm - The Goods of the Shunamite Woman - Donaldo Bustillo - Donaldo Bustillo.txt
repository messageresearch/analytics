TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good afternoon Saints all praise be to God I want to give an update on my knee I didn't fall at work um I didn't stumble I didn't hit it I just squatted down to get a bag off the bottom shelf of my trolley and I felt a little something and I worked the rest of that trolley and then I went on to my next [Music] trolley and within that hour it swelled up like a [Music] balloon the pain was increasing by the minute it hurt to put the ice pack on it so I went to the medical and um what happened was a soft tissue sprain now I couldn't put any pressure on that leg Kendrick brought me home and he had to help me I put out on the WhatsApp for y'all to help me pray for the pain I went back oh kendri came home the next day from work and I was walking around and he said how are you even walking and I said it's the prayer of the sa hallelujah amen amen and I haven't taken any pain medication although they wanted me to the second thing I want to share with you is to me it's an air of Supernatural I was working at wacovia in Buckhead in bu had to be the work at 7:00 in the morning and I'm speeding up 400 and I noticed a brand new Cadillac and I don't recall a license plate on it maybe a dealership plate so of course I passed it and I I thought maybe it was a health issue cuz the car acted like it didn't know where it was going and I looked over at the man that was driving to make sure he was okay he looked over at me and I kept going I pulled into the parking lot and he pulled in beside in back of me now my woman radar went up he came over to my window I rolled it down just a little bit and he said ma'am don't you think you were going a little too fast and I said yes sir he said you want to slow it down you want to be careful he got in his car and he disappeared now I look to my left to see if he was going to park I looked to my right and I saw the tail lights and they just went now the air of Supernatural to me let me describe this man brand new black suit white shirt you know Black Tie but what he looked like it was a black man older close cut hair see some gray but y'all his skin was Flawless no signs of Razor ever hit that face were perfect his eyes had a I don't know bluish every color everything and that's what made me think it was a supernatural visit why was this car on the highway at 7 o' reminds you work this this was 6:30 in the morning I looked at this man like what meeting is he going to at this time of the morning and he doesn't know how to get there I took that as a message and that's why I said it had a supernatural air to me never saw him before that and never saw him after that this came to my memory from last night's Sunday what's that thing called Bible study they were talking about unaware so I wanted to share that with you thanks for listening thank [Applause] you amen God answer God hears prayer amen I was uh telling in my Sunday school class this morning that um Jesus didn't want to perform the miracle because there

we are enjoying of the promised land we are enjoying of the promise of the Seven Seals the Revelation that had been hidden through all the ages in the very back of the God's mind this Revelation have been man has been manifested in this day and it's being declared not to all the people only a special group of people the ones that will be going in the Rapture that Revelation that Rapture Revelation and it's being declar to her and we know that spiritually that we have been already been raptured and our soul has been already raptured but we are waiting a literal Rapture that one day we will come out of the scene so he is sharing with us he is sharing all the mystery that had been hidden but today that is declaring and it's a union it's a spiritual union and that is intimacy between She and Him and the intimacy just like Ruth and Bo and that is the intimacy that is being happening Among Us right now with him do you remember Ruth do you remember Ruth at midnight you know she with Bas with boss you know that rich man you know the the the owner of the you know he's was having intimacy at midnight they were speaking things they were speaking things that the world did not know anything about but she and him they were speaking they were speaking about Redemption you know you know food was given to her you know six measures were given to her you know six measures because the seventh measure and it was boss himself glory to God so I greet you every single one in this hour in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ May the peace of the Lord dwell among you and that is the promise for this hour so we want to continue with this talk you know we are dragging we are dragging that Eighth Day through all the Bible you know the Bible was had the mystery you know after the seven days so today we want to continue with that we're going to ask the Holy Spirit through prayer that he can come that may may he take control of the service we're going to pray heavenly father in this precious night and we feel a great atmosphere there is a great spirit what we can enjoy of the word and Lord may you come in this hour minister to us may may you get to calm down in this place and may the word be coming out and may many things take place in this place and you can see this in this hour in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen so I'm going to ask everyone let's go to the book of Kings the second Kings chapter 8 second of Kings chapter 8 not chapter 7 not chapter n but chapter 8 you know because God has his order you know in chapter eight in in chapter eight you know God placed the life of this woman here you know and she was returning back after seven years glory to God so these things are written in the Bible in this day and that he has given us the privilege because we are living in the Year of Jubilee you know Jubilee was after the seven years you know that was when the slaves were Fred you know that was when the priest would forgive you know that was the year of Freedom hallelujah hallelujah you know and that was taking place you know after the seventh you know it was taking place on the 50 50th when all slaves were free and the one that did not wanted to live and to be free in that hour you know they would put something in their ear you know they would puncher their ear and put something in their ear and he wanted to continue being a slave but the ones that heard the year they heard the Jubilee they heard they were free in that hour glory to God are we seeing right now you know many we see a lot of people that have been punctured and sealed here they cannot hear anymore they canot hear what the spirit is speaking in this hour hallelujah hallelujah glory to God you know second of Kings chapter 8 1-6 the scripture says in this manner okay for then spake Elijah unto the woman whose son had restored to life saying arise and go thou thin household and sojourn whereever though canest in sojourn for the Lord hath called it for a famine and it shall also come upon the land seven years this woman you know this woman is not living in the Days of Elijah you know there's a a particular aspect right there you know she's coming out after the Days of Elijah you know in the Days of Elijah you know that is the picture today and we appeared you know we appeared after the Days of Elijah you know after the days of brother brandham now verse two and the woman arose and did after the saying of the man of God and she went with her hus with her household and so journeyed in the land of the Philistines seven years those seven years you know she was absent those seven years you know Seven Ages you know we were absent those Seven Ages that is the picture right here if you see it you know verse three now and it came to pass at the seven seven years end that the woman returned out of the land of the Philistines and she went forth to cry onto the king for her house and for her land now if you capture something right here you know this is the return of her seven years had gone by when The Seven Ages had gone by and the woman returned back this woman this woman is the mystery of us today and that is that is your mystery now verse four and the and the King talked with gazi and the servant of the man of God saying tell me I pray thee all the great things that Elijah had done you know there was a there was something in between there glory to God there was someone in between there you know speaking to the king and telling him what uh Elijah had done you know while he was out there talking and telling the king things the shite woman appeared Hallelujah verse five and it came to pass as he was telling the King how he had restored a dead body to life that behold the woman whose son had restored to life cried to the king for her house and for her land and J gazi said my Lord oh King this is the woman and this is her son who Elijah restored to life there was a relationship a personal relationship and between her and the King there was no one now intermediate nobody in between now and now she was there in front of the king because that is the mystery of the hour brother Bram he was the elazar he was the mailman that took a letter of love you know and went to look for a bride and went to look for a bride for Isaac you know brother branam toward the Lord that who was him in the Bible you know and God said you are elazar you know now brother Bram as elazar you know they went to called out a w a wife or a bride and once it presented you know after it was presented to joob you know it came he left out of the scene you know now it was a personal relationship between Rebecca and Isaac I'm sorry ISAC you know that was the first thing that brother Bram did in 1965 brother Bram left the scene he was elazar but he left us but he left us with our bridegroom with a personal relationship and between Rebecca and Christ you know that is our story now you know we're having relationship with him personally now verse six and when the king asked the woman she told him so the king appointed unto her a certain officer saying restore all that was hers and all the fruits of the field since the day that she left the land even until now you know in the eighth day you know after the seven days you know the King was given to her what was given back to her what belonged to her you know all the goods that belong to her had been restored back you know after the seven days and after The Seven Ages you know the shite appeared again today so the king can return everything back to us everything that belonged to us that the fall took away from USU and now now in this day and it's being is being given back to us and everything that belonged to to you and the joy was yours you know the faith was yours and everything belonged to you in this hour and it's is being given back to you glory to God may you have a seat in this hour you know I preached [Laughter] already glory to God you know and it was very small but that was the message glory to God now we wanted to look at this woman you know I want to title this and the goods of the shite woman they're given back after after the SE after seven years had gone by hallelujah amen after the seven years years had gone by the shite woman this great woman that had been St that she had she couldn't have any kids or anything that was taken away from her in order to produce a child and she in that hour and she was appearing was appearing back after the seven years and showing and showing in this hour there is one greater than the shite woman in this hour and there is one more greater that the shite woman because over there was the type and Shadow and today is the reality glory to God so in this hour in this hour we're going to start looking we're going to start looking in the mirror of the word and we able and able to say say mother mother that is me and now we are looking at ourselves are looking ourselves in the mirror of the word you know we're looking ourselves we are seeing ourselves in the shite woman you know we are looking at ourselves in Rebecca and we are seeing ourselves in Ruth and we are seeing ourselves in Rebecca and Esther and Sarah in every single aspect you know feminine in the word and today somebody needs to be seeing their themselves in the word in the mirror of the word and to say and to say mother mother that is me glory to God because the life of those wom and it was only showing is only showing the life of this woman today of this church today you know column and Truth amen so now let's start looking now now let's start looking at this sh woman that appears they appears after after the seven years that had gone by and when we speak of the seven years and now we're speaking about seven churches the one that had gone by you know after the seven years you know after the seven that's eight that is returning back to the beginning and that eight is eternity you know eight is matrimony you know two eight eight is two rings hallelujah hallelujah glory to God and then she is reappearing when she was reappearing you know she was reappearing after the seventh you know she was reappearing on the eighth and why is she reappearing again and she's reappearing and to reclaim back and everything that belong to her you know all her Goods all her land everything the one day that we had and she was coming she was coming to reclaim what belonged to her what belonged to her and why do we appear in this day you know we don't appear just to say you know we don't appear here just to say that God sent a prophet you know that is just fine but we reappeared for something more and we reappeared to reappear to reclaim what belong to us that what God gave to us am do you remember the the the the son the prodal son yes glory to God you know the protal son he separated you know he went against the will but being lost and he returned back you know and he said how many servants in the house of my father you know they they enjoy of food you know I'm here suffering you know and I will lift up and I will go where my father is and I will tell my father father you know I have sin against you in heaven you know I am not worthy to be beside you glory to God you know here comes the important part you know the the the older son was right there you know and the father made a feast there were a feast you know there was joy and there was a big Feast you know that were celebrating you know but the oldest son you know the oldest son you know he wasn't very happy he was angry you know he didn't wanted to enter into the feast you know and the father went towards him and he said and he told him why do you don't enter you know and the oldest son said and your son you know your son wasted all the money you know and I've been faithful towards you you know you killed a big cattle for him you know I have never taken anything you know and the father came and told him it's son of mine you know son if you have not taken it it is because you don't want to take it because everything that belongs to me and it belongs to you too amen amen and if you have not taken it and is you have not taken it because you don't want to because everything that belong to him and it belongs to you amen glory to God what do you want joy do you want healing do you want Liberation and all of that is yours and you start taking all that and then you speak to your mountain and that mountain and that mountain been waiting that mountain has been waiting for you to speak to that mountain you know that mountain has spoke to you for many times but today is the hour today is the hour that you speak to that mountain glory to God now we see here that we see that there woman you know a great woman you know a shite woman uh you know a woman that is appearing you know in the days after Elijah in the life of this woman you know it's the mystery of what we are now glory to God in our life was hidden within there into the steps of that woman you know and the works that took place in this woman was only pointing to this right here so when we go to the second of Kings you know that is an event that takes place you know after the Prophet Elijah had gone and now we know we know that Elijah was the continuation of the uh Ministry of Elijah and when Elijah left you know the program of God did not end right there you know God had Elijah was the continuation of this ministry and that's why Elijah asked for the double portion know because it was greater and he said two times I want it I want two times portion of what you have because the challenge was going to be greater and now all of this is showing to us you know all of this is showing to us that after brother Bram left the scene and here are the Elijah in this day with a double portion of Elijah in the same spirit that it was in Elijah that is an Elijah now is in Elijah but double glory to God because the challenge was going to be greater and now Elijah Elijah took double portion two times more you know you know Elijah did twice what than Elijah did you know two times more you know what Elijah did you know what brother Bram did you know what brother brandham did we could say it was Kindergarten but what we are going to do and he said this she she Hallelujah she because he spoke of us and now we're living under the prophecy what a prophet spoke about and he said she and you know she can uh call out a mountain a a to existence and live in it glory to God and she she will be a great Army and she and she will be the final voice you know brother bradam said no I am the final voice and no she he said this she is the final voice because she's the one that is living alive in this day you know the ones that were living in this day are we and she is the final voice for the final age glory to God and the spirit and the bride they say come and the one that is thirsty come and drink and drink of the Living Water and she is the final voice glory to God glory be the name of the Lord oh God doesn't God does not have more mouths but yours you know you know God doesn't have he has your feet to use glory to God okay now we see you know she could not appear in the Days of Elijah you know she appeared in the days of Alicia because you know the types are precise you know the types are clear you know they fit and it makes us look so we can see what it's taking place in this day glory to God now we see you know after the days you know the goods of this shite woman they are returned back to her they're returned back to her they're giv back to her after not before after you know after the seven years had gone by hallelujah hallelujah and we know when the Bible says after the seven years it's speaking after the seven church ches had gone by you know a a woman reappears you know reclaiming what belonged to her a woman a shite woman and a believer you know woman that worshiped God and would serve God and she appeared she appeared to the and to reclaim and everything that belonged to her glory to God and this woman in the life of her life was written in the word you know in a form of mystery but now the scientific people the spiritual scientific people ministers they are capturing Hallelujah and they're are capturing this mystery and they're giving it to the people so in this hour this woman she was only showing and it was only showing the true shite the true shite woman that has reappeared in this hour now and to reclaim what belonged to her what Calvary gave us Calvary and we had we were benefit you know we're benefited of what Calvary gave us Calvary you know Calvary gave us pardons of our sins you know Calvary liberated us Calvary healed us and all of those benefits in this hour there needs to be a woman that is living living under that an anointment under the Revelation what Calvary did for us and for her and now you remember this and before the people of Israel and left Egypt and had been is being was being revealed The Mystery of the Lamb the lamb and the Lambs were in the houses of the Israelites you know in the house of the In The House of the Egyptians there was no lamb in their houses in the house of the Israelites there were Lambs there they had the Revelation they had the Revelation what the atment did already not what it's going to do what the atonment did already and one Time and Forever glory to God in the Old Testament you know the priest the priest would go inside would go inside of the Holy Place one time a year but our high priest entered enter one time only and he entered forever for the sins of the people of his children and he forgave us he forgave us one time only and that was forever glory to God what I see in this evening you know it's people you people that had been forgiven what the holy spirit said through brother Bram you know one pardon you know it's not pardon unless that it's AC accepted as a pardon amen amen you know the president had signed you know he had signed the pardon for that man and was in jail you know but it was no good because he did not accept that pardon you know and they they reach a conclusion you know and they said one pardon it's not a pardon unless is accepted like a pardon so in this hour there needs to be a church you know the Bride of the Lord Jesus Christ his bride and living under that pardon under that anointment of what the lamb did in the cross you know we cannot be living condemned lives you know I cannot work with people like that you know people that is always complaining but when you recognize when in the Revelation what happened in Calvary you know comes to your life and you can accept it that he already forgive you that he already loved you and you know he loved you with eternal life the Bible says you know beloved one in you there is no stain there is no stain you know that's how God sees you nowaday without any stain and just the way that God sees you and you need to see your brother the same way glory to God hallelujah glory to God glory be the name of the Lord amen amen amen and we are happy in this evening you Lord now we see and now you see if you notice something in the life of this woman sh of my woman you know it's placed on chapter uh um verse eight uh chapter 8 I'm sorry Brothers in eight not in six you know not in seven it's not in nine you know it's in chapter eight and why is it placed on eight you know because God has his own ways Hallelujah you know and he's revealing to us that the in the eighth day you know it's it's showing us you know it's showing us what all the the things that happened in her life now the Bible says you know in chapter 8 verse one and then spake Elijah unto the woman whose son had restored to life saying arise and go thou thin household and sojourn where soever though canest sojourn for the Lord hath called for a famine and it shall also come upon the land in seven years you know she couldn't be there those seven years in there hallelujah amen glor glory to God hallelujah amen I'm going to tell this story one time you know a sister was falling asleep you know and the pastor told the Deacon and go and wake up that sister that is falling asleep and the Deacon said and you go wake him up you know he was a very boring preacher you know and I hope I'm not boring you tonight glory to God you know I hope that everybody is here in this hour hallelujah hallelujah now this woman she couldn't be there during those seven years and showing that we that we cannot we couldn't be on the seven Church ages you know those pictures are very perfect and you were not in the first age you were not in the second age you were not in the third age you were not in the fourth
