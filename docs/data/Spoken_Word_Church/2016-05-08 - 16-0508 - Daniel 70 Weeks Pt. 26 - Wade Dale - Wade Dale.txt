========================================

all right there planta she has got Eli today in Eli and sleep up there so she took okay oh yeah yep she's ok but happy Mother's Day to all of you thank you all right Ian I think others died to each and every one of you special special persons yes y'all wouldn't be here yeah well if you put it that way y'all kbl oh that's right this is teamwork okay thanks crap it takes two let's start with a chart let's get back on set this up gave it back on Daniels and a week before we got off on that all right look now make sure we want to make sure that we understand these days because we're gonna fix it to go into it we're fixing to go into them probably next Sunday all right and next Sunday for the first 10 minutes of next Sunday if you got any questions so far don't ask me a question by some we hadn't covered all right so so far that we've covered if you got a question next sunday will take about the first 10 minutes or so an answer try to answer your question right so we are charged so everybody knows now that the first day of the Jewish religious calendar is what its needs nissin nissin nissin is the first God told when they left of Egypt God told them to how old that month as the first month of the year right unless that's the first year that's the first day the first month the gods of that will begin your year we read it in Scripture a long time about 18 or 20 times ago all right so nissen is the start of the religious calendar all right now the start of the civil calendar if you've got your paperwork over here look right here it says civil calendar their civil calendar starts in our september-october that's their civil calendar okay all right right here I wrote it right there its own your paperwork simple calendar hey nice their civil calendar starts here that really has nothing to do with damage them into weeds but it does have something to do with Israel because they go by that time all right just the Kingdom of Israel I want to say or the Israel is instead of state goes by that or as a country all right and the Orthodox you and all the religious world of Israel goes by missing one over there it's January know that mutt start stay here no there which one you don't well their civil calendar if it starts in September and we're in the fifth month here what about that one what's your question it is in April I mean is it over there no no listen this one more time this is their civil calendar not ours there this is their calendar they don't have gained wife everyone march april may right he doesn't know inside cars actually january remember we went back and showed in history the january was a Roman pagan god named Janice and supposedly that was the rising of Janice and that's why they they pick the Romans big game with Merck as their new year I'd say a lot of the names of week and months or name buddy planets which are named by god it's correct right there Lanka flip oh my god it's true last room we're really a lot of our things that we do our come from a pagan origin because we're heathens were Gentiles that's why we're separated from this part of the Jewish nation cocina we never we never used missing and you know we never began with these because these were God's dates that he said for his children of Israel everything else is Gentile everything else just notice there's no number there's no set date you understand one thing but with Israel there's twelve tribe 144,000 / tribe there's a set date God told them that from nissen 12 nissen 14 put the lamb up get it ready and on the fourteenth day you had to pass over now what was that according it was according to the children of Israel have a Passover they killed the lamb right then they left thee to go the 14th day of nisin is to pass over or not now remember i said 14-day it it's not always the date remember cuz you got your calendar swapping back and forth okay cuz you can't make and you can't make Jesus on Palm Sunday 8030 equal a second and then six days later he died from the second third fourth fifth seat going to sell if he died that's not 14 but it is 14 days after that ever that new moon started okay because he was killed it pass over right we know that where it's annette you killed it pass over so remember it technically you don't really count days you got to go last one said the lunar calendar is the closest thing you can get but it's not a hum percent perfect right so months this month of adar they go out remember they look if there's a sliver of moon left they go right back and start that month again it gives you 13 months sometimes it starts exactly on that or a few days different back and forth but it was when two people would go out that's what refresh your memory when two people will go out so we're going to get into some date do people would go out may I whatever may be that may job but somebody in the religious realm or the astronomical around with glad look and they would go back and tell the priest and the priest would step out and declare what it was ok so you priest is the one that declared the time that miss and want miss someone began ok right that's one of it you got to be careful with all your exact dates because you know God's exact he knows exactly what day this is versus the dawn of creation time and that's why the Jews have went back as far as they could and this is like year what 59 they don't have a year nineteen seventy seven or 19 30 2016 they go by year 7452 they have went back all the way to creation and tracked it by days just you know ever 12 every 24 hour cycle they have a day and we're in I don't know what it is but somebody look it up like seven thousands on the day or something like that all right because remember it's been six thousand years first two thousand years he had the flood saving two thousand years he had Jesus next two thousand years now here we are at the end in that six thousand day day you know cuz remember the calendars have been changed things have been flip-flopped back and forth that's one God's hiding it but he does come to a place to where he tells the Jews this is your day this is the day we're gonna have seventy weeks are determined so the seven new is determined let's see if we know one begins we ought to know when it ends because it begins an end no no that's donut day but within that year of that time alright because I've ever for 45pc is when the Edit went out but it took a 52 days to build a wall to finish it so sometime in that year started this first week our first seven years of 70 weeks a day that 49 year then the 62 for the 14 to seven weeks 62 week made 69 and we proved by the Bible and the prophets message that 69 weeks or finish nuts not 67 and are not 69 79 80 k if you can't have a half here and there for the 69 years have been finished for 69 weeks 69 times seven alright so there's one more week left because if you take 483 years is already finished there's a break for the Gentiles then there's one week left after the rapture and we're going to read it next Sunday we'll start reading quotes right but I want you to see this because what happens it pass over now after the children of Israel have left once you come back and start studying Passover once a year once a year they put one lamb up for 14 days all right you had sacrifices all the time for different things okay sin offering trespass all these things but once a year the high priest went in on Passover took one lamb killed that one lamp and that was the symbol of Jesus Christ one man died but what it was they would come in and they would kill that lamb he would sprinkle the blood come back out and Israel as a nation was covered till the next year that's called the Passover right now you know what pass over it okay one more time the Death Angel passed over the children of Israel that had put the blood on the doorpost that's why it's called Passover it really doesn't connect you can't you say Passover it doesn't say let's not commit anything by killing of a lamb but God told them that if they would do when he said kill the lamb remember eat it but the blood over the doorpost that the death angel that came through remember firstborn of every child and first warned about me first one of every family and the first point even of the animals we're going to die right but but God told Moses to put the blood over the doorpost and I tonight I will pass over you if you do what I tell you to do and then the next day they went out they left all right so that's what pass over means God passed over them forgive them of their sin passed over whatever they ain't got them out of Egypt same thing with when Jesus was on the cross he was on the cross he was killed it pass over the Passover lamb one lamb not many lambs one lamb one lamb was killed it pass over got it the blood was sprinkled the priest went in once here remember took the blood in by self novela 20 way by yourself he went in sprinkled the blood where vs. Holy of Holies you went right totally because remember all your other sacrifices were dealing with the outside in that courtyard right you didn't go inside the Holy of Holies and slay a lamb called only one priest could go into the holy of holies I was there so they killed the lamb though and but he took the blood as a symbol and when he walked into that holy moly the dredge came down and it was him and the blood and God if you went out without the blood they haven't dragged him out because he's head all right Murph he did anything wrong right he was dead man I have a checklist posted them up I'd have a hat with a thing postage right here told what to do make sure you don't forget anything but only had to do those take take blood in there once a year sprinkling on the wall them Holies right God would come down and accept that sacrifice if I got that because this is going to be important because the only way to desecrate that is it somebody to go into that Holy of Holies and make it desolate because God will not accept but the sacrifice the heat said that he would accept that's the high priest dress to dress to the way he told them to dress take the blood and sprinkle on the doorpost turn around come out and that's it you know right if I got that let's pass over so Passover is somebody goes into the holy of holies makes one sprinkling and comes back out God accepts that till the next year everybody got that right so this is where we're going to look at some dates now of course the other fees now you got feast of unleavened bread they eat unleavened bread for 14 days they take all the way one out of the house need unleavened bread which is that real flat bread that we eat for communion that's pretty much unleavened bread there's nothing to make it rise all right then to feast of firstfruits remember you had a sheep way then because remember this is all in the spring things are starting to come up they're not mature yet though hear me they're not one to where they're just coming up and get their green you got your hay field and your your wheat fields out there you don't harvest them things when they're green because you know what you're going to get beer that's what Hopsin on it they harvest it in the green time and it's got so much fermentation in it too less how they make beer and stuff lead but you have to wait till it's dead and dry now we're talking about wailing over here in the harvest time but at first the feast of firstfruits priest would go out look at the field and if it was a certain group that was higher than the next that was coming more to maturity than the other ones he'd go and cut that down walk out and wave it across the people and say hey this is growing now this is growing this is the first fruit the first thing to come up that come to the more mature and what happened on the day of resurrection it was the first free Jesus was the birth divided tones he's the first fruit from the dead it was the first one to ever resurrect in any mortal body now remember Lazarus had resurrected several others in the Old Testament had resurrected but they died Jesus was the only one that resurrected into immortality all right so he's the first proof that come up and showing though that that that part had come to maturity and that the rest of the field maybe be a little bit behind but it's coming up to but you don't harvest it right you let it mature you let it keep growing you let the life come up to the stock or the to shoot them into 22 leaves the stock and it begins to start growing them the week but the week seed is not mature until you get over here cuz this is harvest time remember this is the harvest time so that's why they're civil calendars won't fit their first part of the year as is real first part of the year starts right about september-october well how you start something and you know then you go harvest it right then don't tell ones then God has to keep it in continuity planning a spring right harvested in september-october because remember if you'll know by the moon's that this is very striking ailment you listen to this there's two moons that are very important in the world once called the Harvest Moon and once called the Hunter's Moon the hunter's moon is in November that's when usually your procreation of your animals the deer and all the things that come into they come into fertility during the hundreds of men which is in November that's the full moon and no ever but the full moon in October they call it the harvest man in white obviously because the fruit right but in the olden times they harvested all night they couldn't get to listen the other day I went by play a farm to have one of those sickle things that you ride the horse pulls it and it's about this long and it's got the blades and as the wheels turn the blade would do this My heavens to do an anchor it take you half a day now with the tractor we can do 100 acres and a half a day so it took them they literally worked all night and the moon was so bright look at your moon in October that money is so bright it even cast shadows well they would work on that that's called the harvest moon because they would harvest they never stopped when Sun went down it they just kept going to harvesting the product so that's where you get your harvest men so that loan is really important but I want you to realize something that took it's going to be very important so then you got feast of Pentecost which is what happens 50 days after Jesus was killed hmm no this is the feast of pink of Pentecost penta is what why is the pentagon called the Pentagon because it has five sides penta okay they came under the 50th which was the first year of the next forty nine but it was they do on that 50th year they have a day called pentecost and the Holy Ghost fell when that day had fully come to hold those vows but it wasn't an extra one year you got to keep remembering that you can't keep every Jubilee here you can't keep adding years you got to leave it at 49 years then 149 then one but that one year of the next Jubilee cycle is there Jubilee and every 49 years the next year was a golden jubilee number it will right here Leviticus 25 8 we ready number your seven Sabbath or seven you don't want to call us about call it survival why are you going to sabbatical you don't do anything your ass right why it's why you know you professor is going sabbatical if you work for a huge company they'll give you some radical take a month off let's want to sound with his its arrest that's what it's Sabbath means is rest alright so 77 649 all right on that 49 year the next year was the first year of the next cycle but it was a golden pupil they kept up with it if you read back in history though they never literally held that feast I said literally now bad Pentecost just when it was pointing toward you got that the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost fell that's why mad fellows because it was only a jubilee here if you're going again today you are energy bleeder you're not the 49 you're not enough s7 right 777 is what completion but eight is eternity you went from you went from amateur changes into an eighth day go to future home brother branham you run out of tight well if he would have stayed 7 7 we'd never have a raptor but once he said no reading the Medicus if you keep reading Abenakis there's a what and on the eighth day which is minding their watch same thing when you laugh over switches the first exactly same thing was 49 49 years let's make ever how many marked that 49th year then you had this year and if it was seven and sevens from the other that was a jubilee year but it was the you went then you didn't go you didn't have 50 March you only had 40 now marks that next mark started another 49 son oh my god that yeah yeah alright night same thing with one two three four five six seven brother Brown said on the eighth day there's not eight days in a week you go back to the first it's an overlap same way here everything got everything into me got it he overlapped he just lapped over everything he's saying I was here the 49 that 50th year but now remember that 15-year only happened at the 50th year you come up one two three four five six seven you had a jubilee but it was not a golden jubilee correct you have to go 7 times that ok got it bro got an outlet doesn't your said Leviticus 25 88 yes that golden to rights bed sleep on a date how about that he put it in the eighth put it in the eighth day on the 8th verse on the 8th verse talked about that ma'am I'll have you up beginning with the 8th verse see their God showing all the way through but if you stay in if you stay right here that's your church agent we have to be called out of that you see everybody was called out church age in the Jubilee but there's nothing left for us there's not an 8th turkey we have to go back to the first which is what line 2 3 4 5 6 7 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 12 to them there's no 8 day but to be eternal you have to make an eighth day you have to say it's something different listen eternity is different than anything we know about right that's why I look at an eternity of something different I thing but um I was listening to a song the other day about gotta wipe her tears and all those things won't have to you know we have days like this sorrow joy sorrow joy if it was sorry what if it was joy and you don't even know what sorrow is see we can't humanly comprehend that because we have startled or something we're equipped for that star on Joyce aren't going but they'll be one day we'll be just like that line right there maybe all joy you said how's it going to happen listen like some things God is going to have to do that we can't understand cuz in our humanity we know there's joy and sorrow we know about all that but what about a day when there's no fear now listen yeah yeah I'll be keeping you come to a place to where you don't fear those bees and they know that they fear you that's the best the whole thing happened in the garden when Adam and Eve were in the garden and the lion and the lamb laid down together there was no fear factor of the highest form creation which is with adam and eve but once they remember I told you that God said where are you at him out and said I was afraid he had never been afraid in his life that's me that's why I tell about these people thanks Randall millennium I want you to go and I won't throw you in with the lines and let's see how that fear factor takes over i will put you in up in a bowl snakes poisonous ones obviously yes maybe put a couple of boat constrictors in there may be some you're already scared now if I put one in this flooring it right down through there guess what empty room don't make me have to go to hospitals if you run over the other person but so there's things that we don't know but we got to get ready that's what we're talking about life not the bible study whether that whether it ends in 2019 we gotta get ready there is going to be a time when the rapture is going to take place and it can't be far off look at this new club we got a new president coming in 2017 alright whatever whoever it's going to be if we do get out of here in 2019 you know that's another that's another election year something I mean they're coming up to the next of twenty twenty years when the next election in so you're looking at a time period in there whether it's going to be a lot of turmoil I think whether Trump gets it or whoever gets it doesn't matter these next few years are going to be are going to tell the tale close ever taste kind of setup which should be now correct you know is what's looking like they're looking America is now against this room with that's what that's what they said you know Oh down through the ages if you brother Brown said America is enjoying success because of their relationship with Israel now when we break that relationship with Israel the Bible says the nation did that in other words goes against Israel he'll be against the nation is for Israel that's all is keeping the ramp off the bus besides are still being here is that we have been Israel friend but when we turn against Israel trouble big time alright so let's go back to this real quick for a few minutes so everybody got that love to pick off that's when the Holy old spell read your Bible the Bible says when the day of Pentecost had fully come right okay that was that's why they were all gathered the feast of Pentecost these were feast the enjoying him the head they had festivities you know it wasn't he wasn't something that they just love let's go note if you read back in Leviticus there was three feats that you were required to attend the other ones but all males in the household habit of 10 3 feet all right so remember that just hang on to that now watch so you gotta be spent on then you got a long period of time if you read brother branham many times he mentions he said you got the dead Pentecost 50 days ever he said then there's a long period of time what there's a long period of time two thousand years of Gentile when I say this I'm not pointing this way I'm pointing back over here wolf where we were before where you got your little circles on your other chart all right now obviously a Gentile when we get born again that's our damn take off but there is a little time that they have a Pentecostal feast in Israel okay never have a cycle that they go through alright so now there's a long period of time many many days one two three four months physically on the calendar until the Feast of Trumpets they blow the trumpet when brother Ron Cey trumpet means what an announcement at the last Trump on the trumpet shall sound Feast of Trumpets nobody got that all right save time when i'll explain tomorrow you i want to read them or look at Google Feast of Trumpets you'll read for months okay and I'm telling you let me tell you one more thing a lot of these things i did get off the internet but a lot of things brother branham god he got out of books he just didn't have the Internet in out google he had physically search them to both olanna scripts and your eyes smithing and Clarence Larkin he went back and studied those people but when he done though was he was a prophet through the filter of the Holy Ghost he could say all right well that that part's good up to here badness is good up to a certain point Methodist is good after a certain point but what they didn't do is they didn't go on with God to put the wood and having a word to put it together to keep continuing on into the Word of God but now we had a prophet William Brown come raise us up not just him he raised us up so that we can see in all directions have be prophetic that we can take this information there's one thing for sure I put the Bible prophets message and then anything else and I'm talking about me brother Dale anybody I don't care what creature that you've got to go on or profit as a highest or you can go in and then know what brothers profits there you go the Bible which brother brown said face final resting place is in the Word of God let's grow alright if it seems contrary if brother branham seems contrary what he said go back to the Bible running through your filter again and you'll find out there brother Brennan was saying exactly won't even meant to say if it hides it from you hides it from me I'm just I'm sorry that's what i was saying let's not Bible study have you heard any preacher ever preach on 1977 never have I heard of minister stand up say I'm gonna explain to you why the Bradford didn't place take place in that position because they don't know i'm not saying i know but i understand one thing for sure I know if he if he plugged it in to this right here then we can go back to Leviticus 25 8 and find out why the rapture didn't play take place in 1977 cuz it wasn't a 50th according to the benefits 2510 the villages 2510 would have been that was the end of it but he said it was a 70th you believe since the beginning of Jubilees according to Leviticus 25 8 which is seven times seven that's where you had 77 and had 49 years you get 20 26 ad ok cuz the next you believe cycle will start on 20 20 20 27 and that would be the 71st you believe well 71 x 70 is more than four hundred nine so that's that's what I'm concluding is that we can't go past 20 26 because if that's true we got to 71st Jubilee and there is no 74 whew bleep sandwich 7 is 49 49 seventy times seven is 490 all right that's all the time allotted on this earth for God to deal because remember remember what we got a few minutes remember that mark right there does not end time it is the time of the seventy weeks of Daniel got it that doesn't in time add a thousand years to that because even if you'll read if you've been reading I went back in the Old Testament pulling up some real nuggets in Ezekiel and Zachariah there's going to be day and night still not in the temple not in the new city let me tell why not the temple not in the new city then you see the video milk it'll be daylight all the time all right but outside they're going to have day or night they're not they're not harvest I'm planting reaping all the way for a thousand more years so don't get me wrong say well that's when x going to end times not going to end the seventy weeks of Daniel has the beginning therefore it must come to an end that's right seventy weeks are determined God determined seventy weeks for the redemption of Israel he redeems us inside of that then he redeems the city okay so this is the part of okay that's why it's going to take I want to ask one more question how can you do this the six fold purpose has to be inside of Daniel seventy weeks right so many weeks are determined upon by people on the ball now holy city to what finish the transgression make an end of Stan make reconciliation for iniquity bring in everlasting righteousness set up the vision and promised in our North the most holy how you going to do that only three and a half years because you got a battle of Armageddon right here how you gonna bring in everlasting righteous and how you gonna do four or five and six can see the most people don't actually say that they damage they can we can end right here no the Ministry of Jesus Christ ends right here but there's one week left Africa a trip to fulfil the seventy weeks of Daniel that's where the people on the message can't separate it because brother Branham he puts it together for me to hide it God here in front listen if it was so easy to understand everybody would understand it but nobody understands it so there's only gonna be a special group of people it's going to be able to understand it that word determined means divide divide that in that use its means divide seventy weeks are divided same thing it's determined its divided in this three section the other all right but remember don't say that I said that the world's going to end I mean the time hands in twenty twenty six World Order of time Indra here you got meat World Order of time will hand right there the Battle of Armageddon will be man throwing a comic nuclear gases horrible stuff we've never seen before and we ain't going to see para 44,000 nothing to see but there's going to be a physical battle right here of people throwing things at people that you've probably never seen and don't want to see in Zechariah it talks about their eyeballs melting in their socket and their flesh falling off their bone what is that nuclear what nuclear fallout because remember the Battle of Armageddon not gonna kill her plan today you can throw every ball everybody's got there are certain places an angle hit if I got that so they're going to die of nuclear fallout it may take a year they don't matter to me I just don't want to be here when I happened hey man cuz remember your food spurgeon you learn 44,000 and your two witnesses are going to be gone when that battle begin nobody but heathen that's going to be demons fighting demons human demon not that because remember the spirits who don't still live on spirits live on through the thousand-year this is going to be suppressed right that's why it's still time all right until you go into that wat don't get been in the Battle of Gog and Magog Gog and Magog is a spiritual Bible and God's going to kill all them demons spirits and then all right so you got that but watch now we talked about Passover and I want you to see this just before we get started pulling it for next week Passover is in you get it right here Passover is in this and one right inition 14 somewhere in that month of nisin right ok that's when the priests now watch when we leave out of here brother branham tells us that the Jews will set up temple worship that's what they're looking for they need the menorah they need the red heifer they need the ark let's just say let's just some eyes that that treaty that because he's got those things we prove Rome has those things Rome has although when Titus destroyed the temple he didn't leave that go laying around because remember everything was in late and laid with gold all kind of things silver know you think you think that even left that goal in Israel knew he took it all back to mama so Rome holds the whole thing that israel needs to set up temple worship so what the boats going to do is he's just going to say in so many times he's going to say you want temple worship yes alright i'm going to give you because remember you don't the devil got to give you something don't hold nothing in return the Dead will give you something he won't something right so he's going to make a covenant with the Jews Nico say okay here's the menorah here's your holy holy now set up the temple we're gonna have peace for three and four seven years but what he's going to do is he's going to have to deal with two prophets in hundred forty-four thousand during that time they gonna really make him mad so what he's going to do is if you if you look and we're going to read it next Sunday the abomination right now listen I think we'll read it next Sunday but the Bible on my shorty and Daniel 12 and in Daniel 9 the abomination that maketh desolate we know that's that monster or over there that's a building it's a building castles not even worried about that building mom and then went over there and they're they're digging right up against it and even right under it trying to find those things so it's not really the building it's never been building the building has nothing to do with this whole thing if people right God didn't get mad at a building he didn't get match the buildings of Sodom and Gomorrah he got mad at the people that were in Sodom and Gomorrah right right so what's going to happen is what's going to happen is is is to the way I see it is that that Pope is going to walk in on the day of Passover that's going to be a sacred day because for three and a half years they're going to be making sacrifices and they don't think ma'am we got it going the massage fishing to come we're going to have all this together and a heathen tote walks into that Holy of Holies and the Bible talks about desecration the only way you can desecrate something is put something in there that's not supposed to be there if he desecrates the temple he was in after the after and after in the midst of the week the Bible says in the midst of the week he'll cause the sacrifice and the oblation the seats how was he going to cause it he's going to decimate it because once he walks in the gym say we can't do anything anymore you you you made this place unclean he said don't worry I'm to die remember he's got to come to a place to where he's got he said you got to start worshipping me now then then last one all hexagon bracelet really comes by that time I believe 144,000 is going to be closed or even gone to extra going to be gone your your foots burden is going to be dead so all you got standing is you got jus natural and the Pope the mother of all Hartley so if you take Passover in the midst of the week back it up three and a half years you got October of clean I think so remember from here to here in six months he comes in three and a half years he he comes in the midst of the week three and a half years he's coming here will count backwards three and a half years you got one two three I'm at you gotta back it up go go backwards you got October 2019 she'll think about that so we get we gotta go go go go sorry right over a little bit
