pray for brother Wade this afternoon Lord as he comes to minister or may we see who we are in this hour Lord we just believe and we're so faithful we commit all of these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen first Samuel chapter 17. very familiar verse first Samus chapter 17 verse 1 says now the fullest things gathered together the armies to battle and were gathered together at Sugar which belongeth to Judah appears to get shoka and a Zia and Fs denim and soul and the men of Israel were gathered together and pitched by the valley of elah and set the battle in a ring against the Philistines and the Philistine stood on the mountain on one side and Israel stood on the mountain on the other side and there was a valley between them and they went out a champion out of the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of gath whose height was six cubits and a span and he had a helmet of brass upon his head and he was armed with a coat of mail and the weight of the coat was 500 shekels of brass and he had Graves of brass upon his legs and a target of brass upon his shoulders and the staff of his spear was like a Weaver's bean and his Spears had weighed 600 shekels of iron and one bearing a shield went before him and he stood and cried under the armies of Israel and said unto them why are ye come out to set your battle an array am I not a Philistine and ye servants to Saul Choose You amen for you and let him come down to me if he'd be able to fight with me and to kill me then we will be your servants but if I Prevail against him and kill him then ye shall be our servants and serve Us in the Philistine said I defy the armies of Israel this day give me a man that we may be we may fight together amen Lord and the blessing in reading the word and be seated this morning and I want to take a little thought this morning about being in the valley and been on the been on my mind a while I've been doing some reading and you know we all like to be on the Mountaintop you know it's you know that's you know what we always like to be in the victory you know we always you know the Bible's full of Mountaintop experience oh yeah you know we think about Mount Transfiguration and when we talk about the the Abraham and Isaac going up on the mountain meeting God and God being showing that he was Jehovah Jireh because he brought the brought forth the lamb you know Moses was on Mount Sinai when God gave him the Commandments and then you know he was home he was on Mount Sinai when he asked God he said can I see your face and he said no man can see my face and live exactly right but he said you stand in the Cliff of The Rock and he said I'll put my hand over your face and he said you'll come I'll walk past and you can see my behind you know my back part and he sold you know he saw a man come back and you know we think about oh Moses Moses was on the mountain when the children of Israel was fighting amalek right right and it was as the battle Rags you know Moses sitting on the mountain there on the hill and he told him he said I'm gonna hold up my hands on my rod and and he said you know the battle went for Israel while they had his hands up yeah but he said when his arms got tired you know Aaron and her had to come and hold his arms up so they could defeat him a lick and you know Calvary was another was another battle that was fought where the victory was won you know we we look and we won't talk of the mountaintops but you know if the same things go for the things that are in the valleys right and you know the scripture Psalms 121 1 says I will lift up my eyes into the heels for when it's cometh my help from the Lord which made heaven and earth right and then in Psalms 125 1 David writing says they that trust in the Lord shall be as Mount Zion which cannot be removed but abide that's forever right so again we always like to think about the things that happen on the mountain but you know what I want to talk about the things that happen that have happened because brother Branham says here and getting in the spirit he says well you know it's all right to be on the Mountaintop that's good but let me tell you he said your fruits will freeze up there at night and when the cold spell comes you'll lose all your fruit they said that's what's happened now we put too much on mountaintop experiences a dancing is shaking and jumping around instead of all night prayer meetings right down in the valley of decision where you have to come down there and meet God and really pour out your life until something takes place right and then moving on he says what we need is to get down to that grinding place right down there in that Valley dig out that's exactly right it's where the church needs to be tonight amen right so that's where we need to be because brother Brenham all continuing on in the same message he said that's what's the matter today with too many people's experience he said two dry and stiff we need something flexible the wind comes down it blows and rushes and rush it around and pull it around and make it grow get life into it because you know and if you've been in if you've been anywhere especially you go in the mountains water's not in the mountain the water's rolling downhill right and so as the water runs down here that's what he's talking about he said because brother Brandon says he'd rather be a little bit green right because he could move right exactly because that's where that's where the water was at right and he says because because everybody trying to live on the Mountaintop he said God off without God what we need today is get back to God get back to the experience right get back right you know I thought that was really amazing because we want to live on the Mountaintop but that's not where God wants us to be right we have a Mountaintop experience but you know what God has other places for us to be right brethren Davis uh talking because you know they said persecution you know that's a that's a natural part of our life yeah we are to live he said it's a normal part of the Christian Life you're going to go through hard times you're going to go through persecutions you're going to face these things oh yeah and and brother even the Apostle Paul tells us that you know we've got a little bit of suffering left to do all also right because you know what hey each each believer has to go through the next the uh walk that Abraham took right and we'll get in I'm going to show you a few things in the life of Abraham but you know each one of us have to have that same walk the children of Abraham take the same Journey that Abraham and so we have to go through the same things that we're going to face hard times and we're facing on face trials but you know what I I found out one thing you know what it's a wonderful thing because we look at them and say well we don't want to go through those things no right but you know what God's there and you know you look through these things and you see what God has prepared for us you know David said he said you know if I go into heaven he's there right he said do I make my bed in hell he's there he's there with me no matter where I'm at but you know he's as as Psalm 23 tells us you know he leads us he's leading us through that's right right you know he said because you look and he leads me beside the Still Waters he prepares a table in the presence of my enemies you know there there it is it's a time of refreshing in the middle of a battle oh yeah right Amen in the midst of a war right he said yay though I'll walk through the valley of the shadow of death amen he said I will fear no evil for thou art with me he said you know brother random said you bear do you realize that there has to be light in the valley to have a shadow exactly because brother Madam also says well we'll get to it he says the Morning Star comes down and stands in the valley man sure right and so we have light in the valley right yeah so we are not we're not left alone in the valley but we have to go through these things you know so glad and it's talking about the law of contrast they said you know if if we didn't have valleys in our life he said you wouldn't appreciate the good things he said you know we can't appreciate being on on the rooftops or the mountaintops unless we've been in a valley he said you know we have to drink some bad water to appreciate good water he said you know the things that have we have to go through we don't appreciate them unless we go through these things and have to look back on what we've been through that we can appreciate where we are that's right because you know because he Brothers said that the the bride always does better under persecution always does better under pressure so you know what if everything was always on the Mountaintop and everything was always glorious then you know we wouldn't appreciate that and you know that's what Drew Israel into the into the condition that she got in that the children of Israel got into was because when when they become Lacks then then I could just do anything they wanted to because you know what when it was not being under pressure then guess what their their morals and their standards got lacks right and so they they come to uh sink down and get tangled up in a lot of things right all right so we appreciate but we we realize we have to be in living in the valley and uh here we read this morning of David been in the children of Israel facing the Philistines and you're leaving you know the fullest things was one of the groups that they just continually uh give the children of Israel fits they were all they were you know so many times you read in the Scripture it was always the Philistines opposing them but you know here's here's a the children of Israel coming to deface the battle facing the Philistines and you know they're just going through the motions because here you know because Goliath stands up there and he says why have you put your battle in a race right or why why in our terms why are you putting why are you posing all right why are you pretending right because you've set out your armor you have set your battle you've set your armies up like you're going to fight but he said I stand here and I defy the armies of God right he said I'm looking for someone to come and fight me yeah and he said y'all just stand on the other side of the mountain and won't come down you know and there he stood on stood in that Valley looking up at him and saying come on send somebody yeah all right and you know that's the way we act sometimes when we realize hey we're going to have to face a hard situation Lord don't let me go through that right I don't want to go on stand on a mountain all right and here they're all sitting around looking at Saul because he's he's the king he's the he's the man that's Head and Shoulders above everybody else we can't be disturbed because he's he's making battle plans yeah he's in his tent he can't be disturbed right sounds like a lot of politicians yeah they're too busy doing anything else to but then that's neither here nor there yeah it doesn't matter if they don't do anything or if they do anything it's still wrong yeah but you know here they are standing there and looking down on this man and I mean he's a he's a bigger probably bigger than any of them have ever seen in their life right yeah this man standing there and he's looking for someone to come and fight him and nobody wanted nobody wanted to come out to him but you know Dave you can't you know his dad sent him down there to his brothers and he saw what was going on he could not believe that the armies of God stood there and acted the way they did right right and so and such as such a cowardly position again we know that David wanted to go and fight him oh yeah because David had an experience right you know you look at a little ready fella that had a slingshot you know I wouldn't I wouldn't go with uh I wouldn't go with anything with a slingshot no brother Brandon said you probably couldn't kill a rabbit with a slingshot yeah but you know they had used these things and they knew what worked because you know Saul wanted to put his armor he wanted to put armor on David right but he's like I don't know how to use this though I've never proved any of this stuff I don't know anything about this but I know what I've been through all right I've had an experience yeah exactly he said when I was on the back side of the desert he said it was only me between that lion and that sheep right they said it was only made between the bear and the Sheep he said I was put on the back side of the desert to protect those sheep and he said I stood there and he said they came down and he said the spirit of the Lord Came Upon me and he said I killed him yeah and he said now we're standing in front of this uncircumcised Philistine yeah yeah he said I want was only doing what it naturally does eats they went after praying to Bear the same thing but now you've got this man who's uncircumcised defying the god of of Israel right exactly and it's calling for somebody to come and fight him which is the same thing you know that's what the devil does to you he wants you he wants to make you look you know and put pressure on you and make you think oh well you come right but you know what David said I've got it we've got those brother Reynolds up he knew and he said he knew that he was anointed right he said he remembered Samuel pouring the anointing along him all right he said and brother Brandon says where are the anointed in this day he said you've been anointed by the Holy Ghost he said learns the anointed today amen basically because you are anointed right and he said he stood there and he said and David went out there and he said I want to face him oh yeah you know what David went across you you think about it this huge man is standing in this Valley and you're walking this little runny boy still left behind the ears going down this massive Valley this vast area all the eyes are upon him and everybody's standing there saying we're going to be him wouldn't want to be him yeah but you know what David had an experience right right and David stood there and he said you know and he went down through that Valley and he got down there to the water and he went down there and picked those rocks up you know what and then and and Goliath you know he was just beside himself that's all y'all got to send me yeah he said I'm just gonna put him on the end of my spearing fading to the birds this is this is the best job God y'all got Army sitting in a ray all this armor all of these soldiers all you got is a little boy that's the best you can do but you know what it was all that was all that was needed that was all that was needed right and he stood there and when he walked out there he said he said you come at me with a spear and a sword he said but I'd come at you in the name of the Lord right right and he said you know what he said I'll remove your head from you this day yep right see yeah that's all that's all David needed right why because he realized the battle wasn't his all right but you know what he had to walk in faith right because the battle wasn't his right but he walked out there and he faced Goliath made the last come at him but you know what he had power right right brother said David had a hidden power he said it was the blessings that was upon David the blessing that he had upon him well because he was going to be king right he was anointed ain't no nothing was going to say anything why because he knew what God had done for him and what God was going to do all right and you know what it became it became God's battle when when he decided when he defied God right he wasn't David he wasn't the armies it was God but all he had to do is just go out there and be God's representative all he had to do was put that rock in the sling it didn't matter where he threw it right they could throw it anywhere but God had it it was a supernatural event all right that's right there's one he let go of that rock it hit exactly where it had to hit him right you know brother Brandon was talking about um hit uh who's preaching at the at the Tabernacle and he was preaching on the all of the resistance that David had you know he faced all this opposition why because nobody wanted him to do that all right everybody was so afraid they said you know what everybody got encouraged one day we went up there and killed him yeah well yeah right then everybody's like yeah we can take them now then everybody wanted to start following and doing something right they chasing them but you know what we see that this today you know because we stand here this morning and we wonder sometimes I wonder if the Lord's gonna heal me I want I wonder how long I'm going to have to wait yeah yeah man that's right you know I wonder about this and I wonder about that right right well you know what he said he said if you come by faith if you meet the same requirements that someone else has met sure he said he's obligated to do it again that's right or he's a liar right so I mean we stand here this morning we look at we look at all the Miracles that's happened I mean we don't look at the Bible we look at what's happening just in this church right that's right brother you know I I can't remember who it was not an assistant Freedom somebody lost something somebody on Facebook on there somebody lost something and you know what I was thinking about that that I don't know if I I told it here I know to some of you but you know I lost I lost the work keeps them to my work van and I was at the shop and I parked it and I left an awesome I couldn't figure out where they ran nobody could find them we looked all over the place and you know I've got it's a we've got a single door and then we've got a bay door and we've got double doors on each side of the building and I lost them and we started looking for them and we had a job to do next day and I had to find those keys and we look high and low I looked at home they looked at work everywhere and I said Lord I need to find those keys and we've got a and they got a a little Grill sitting right beside the garage door and I looked high and low we all looked through we looked at everything we could find and I couldn't find them and I'm pregnant Madison what we need to find those keys over whether hey brother Ron Spencer coming to me in a dream I walked up too and your brother wrote last time you know where you know he'll wear a coat when he's preaching you know he takes his Jago like we do but he just had a white shirt and that time everything come up to me and I said brother Ron I can't find those kids I said I don't know where they're at they said don't worry brother he said you'll find them it'll be okay don't worry about it I woke up the next morning my boss called me off home before I got to work thank you thanks and I don't know where they came from but you know what God knew where they're at and God know where to put them see I mean just like I think brother brother Dean right I think drove all the way to Greene County with a lock on the back of a pickup truck hand him lock the trailer down yeah drove all that blade now got down there then the lock was going on there yeah I haven't had fallen off right no you think of things like that God's mindful looks little things like that that's right right and here he was David see all God's looking for is somebody to be faithful that's right right we can be faithful we can move on the scene but you know he was he was hindered the brother Brown said let's see this is from the message second-hand Road he said I stood 10 years ago at this platform preaching on David and Goliath he said no it is it isn't that Goliath that's hindered me they said God slayed him before me yeah yeah he said but the thing that hindered me is the lack of faith the lack of something that I know was around yeah see Goliath was dead but the thing is it was a lack of faith right that's what hinders it's a lack of thought about it realizing hey the Goliath is dated yeah yeah you know as the the scripture tells us that all power is permitted of God right now the powers that be are ordained of God right so you know there's God God overdains all things but you know glass glass was already defeated sure but you know what it's a lack of our belief we fail to believe that right and that's what that's what hinders us and your brother Adam was talking about misters maybe somebody the the brothers he said you know they weren't uh educated but he said they follow him because brother Branham went out your brother Adam was uneducated you know Toby was going to pray for kings and potentates you know I'm going to have this great Healing Ministry you know nobody would have believed that Dr Davis sure didn't but you know what he said he went out there and started preaching and he was talking about brother Roberts and all these other brothers started falling right come out on the scene he said you know they were uneducated they didn't he said but they had Faith to bully right to go and take take on these these uh Devils all right the show that God had had the anointing was upon the people right that God had poured out his anointing that you know we could overcome amen and you know because we realize that if um there wasn't questions and answers brother random standing there you know what you know we read this a lot he said because brother I'm talking about the anointing the anointing being upon the people the other day says you know when the when the doors of the Gentiles is closed right they said then God will anoint um a church then all right amen but you know what he said and he's doing it now amen right listen you know people people say oh well when the doors of the gym house is closed and he's going to anoint oh yeah but you know what he's doing it right now all right I try but you know what we'll see we're seeing in a greater fashion then but you know what the anointing is already because you know what we are anointed brother man said this is the rapturing age we've entered into a Rapture name that's right man right and you know we've been anointed for that right yeah somebody's going to come to that place where that Goliath that stands in front of them is going to be defeated amen the death dance is not it's not going to hold them right they can't be held by data Amen brother you know what it's not it's not that you're going to bypass there right you're going to walk through it right you're going to defend him it's not something that you're going to go around right exactly it's not like you're gonna skip it all right it's not like because it's a door that we all have to face we all have to go through that door right right he said door that you know just like the doors back there you have to go through those doors it's not some other way that you're going to go out right but you know what when you reach that door death will have a hold on right right just like just like the Apostle Paul even though the Apostle Paul went down you know what he stood there and said that's where she you know where's the victory that's where's your uh victory yes where's your sting all right you know here he is even though even though he's gonna have his head cut off you know what he realized that even death then didn't have a hold on all right amen that was not that was you know what's your Victory that's right you can lay a hole on this flesh but he said you can't touch me that's right amen because you know what you only have a momentarily hole on the flesh right it'll go down to the ground but you know what it'll come back up all right so you know what you're always only going to be a temporary hold right but you know it's not gonna be permanent okay you know one of the things that always amazed me was in hey brother I was talking on the seals you know this and and the in the seals where it talks about the the rider with the sword you know the the second one came out and he had the sword and he said he comes to take peace from the Earth yeah but you know what you can't take peace you couldn't take their lives and and because they were anointed right right with a with a calf spirit with the ox Spirit they were anointed for sacrifice right you know you can't take something if somebody gives it up freely right amen right you know it's hard it's hard to rob somebody that wants to give you something right right you know because you know what that takes all the victory out of it right because you know what the victory lies with the person that gave it man yeah because when they stood there and I can't remember which one it was but you know the um I was reading the other day you know famous papers you know he didn't even want to be tied to the stake right like a polycarp we want to be tied to the state stood there right I was talking about the fox's book of Martyrs you go back and look at the different ones that was in the in the fox's book of Martyrs you know they was they tied they tied a a millstone around one man's neck and he stayed in the water and he preached for hours before he went under yeah tied to a millstone right yeah see you look at this you know they they had that anointing you know what that was Victory to them you couldn't take that away from them see the thing is you know the Devil comes to try to take things away from us you know what you know we realize sometimes we don't realize but later on we'll realize then you know it's a blessing in disguise anyway we're like well thank the Lord you know because you know what he's the one that drives as those spirits that came out here to that hundred thousand hundred thousand thousand Devils that was poured out you know he came upon the juice he said it drove them back to the Homeland he said it was poured on the right he had to drive her back to the word exactly amen you know we think we think well you know it's it's a it's a hard time it's it's a terrible thing you know what it's glorious if you can look at it because you know that is that is bringing you to the place you ought to be right amen you know people ask me all the time you know how am I doing I'm doing great all the time hey you know what I'm doing bad I'm doing good exactly I do great I do fantastic yeah brother brother Ray I'll take you all right he asked me how I'm doing super fantastic yeah he said that's all right no it's super fantastic but you know what you walk it you walk in in the atmosphere that you create amen you create that atmosphere you walk in you know it's just like just like the Hebrew children you know they had to go into a fiery furnace but you know what they created the atmosphere that that their environment didn't have any effect on them right they went down there and said hey we're not going to bow we've made up our mind even when it was seven times hotter and the guards that were trying to put them in there were killed you know were killed but they they didn't die right didn't have the smell of smoke on them didn't have a sense hair was not anything wrong with them they were bound got thrown in and next thing you know they're walking around free in the midst of the fourth man yeah when Nebuchadnezzar looked in he said you know well I thought we threw three in he said they're not walking around and he said in the midst of the fire he said you see the one that looks like as under the Son of God right right walking around they come out and they were just fine had absolutely nothing wrong with them and we got oil together that happened a long time ago well that was for somebody you know what he is the god of impossibility still here this morning you know what those men those men that went into that fire you know what they were baptized with the Holy Ghost you know what they were not born again right and we know about you know we've reached the Apex because we've received justification sanctification in the baptism of the holiest we've been placed into the body we have become what he is right and then we think well you know that's just too hard equipment no it's not because you know what he takes care of us right right man you know it doesn't matter what what comes our white case there and he's watching over us right but you know what it becomes our confession it's what we believe is what we say because that's exactly what happened to David right David David walked in his confession and walked what he believed amen and he met and even and even later on you know the Philistines came back how many know that yeah yeah and then second and second Samuel we find out that after David was anointed king and became king and rolled you know what the Philistines didn't like him right imagine that yeah the man who had killed who had killed their champion he came back to kill him and you know what he was standing there and looked like and you know he was David was had gathered his armies and was standing there was praying to God about going into the valley to face the Philistines again oh yeah and you know what you know what God told him you know he wouldn't know about how he was going to face them and he said he said when you hear the rustling and the mulberry bushes he said I will be going before you and Gloria he said then you'll go in and he said then you'll Smite the Felicity right that's right amen and you know what Brethren said that's what's happened today you know because the the anointing is still moving the spirit is still moving in the mulberry bushes it's still rustling before us that we are to move forward right and I believe it's a invisible Union is that where he said he said you know the move is on right for the bride he said we have entered into the rapturing game right he said it's thus saith the Lord he said we have we have reached this place because if if the if the move was on for David when the wrestling and the mulberry bush had much more for us today right and that's what he says he says it's it's got to be it's got to be something it's moving right now friends the move is on for the bride that's the truth that says saith the Lord right see the move is on today for us it's moving he's either before us for moving us forward and it's thus saith the Lord right well because there's a place for you and I to go to right right exactly yep see sometimes we wonder God is moving sometimes he's trying to get us to see what's happening amen because you know let his brother and him said you know we always look at the past and we're looking at the future but he's moving right now right he's right before us moving all right he's calling for us to move forward and then we go and I've got some more I want to just not deal with David but uh look at the the life of Abraham and I've got I don't know probably got a dozen dozen characters and and different scriptures and things to look at this one I know we're gonna get all to them but uh I just loaded up I just it's like you start looking at one thing and something else comes and you start looking at that and you find something else there's another one right keep battling yep well because you see it all through the Bible but Abraham brother and says and and uh tested Faith produces goods 1958 he said it was Abraham called from the city of UR the city the land of the child ends the Gentile they said he was down in the valley of shinar yeah and just an ordinary man but God spoke to him when he was 75 years old his wife Sarah 65 been married since she was about 18 no children and God told Abraham that they were going to have a baby right and Abraham believed God and he called anything contrary to what God had said as though it was not believing and that God was able to keep his promise so you know he started out in the in the valley we all did in sin that are worshiping Idols right that's right a heathen right but you know God come and got us all right he brought himself and speaking to Abraham and told and told told Abraham you know it was a it was an unconditional Covenant I'm so glad he has that for us you know where as as the children of Abraham Glory that loyal seed you know he has he has it for us it's not anything that we've done right amen it's his it's by his grace yes we are what we are and you know hey Miss late even through all the things that he had to go through 25 years a walking believing that he was going to have a son right all the things that he went through all the faults and failures that he had you're looking you know a lot of times you'll hear people say you know as well you know Sarah laughed Sarah well you know Abraham did too yeah right exactly but you know all the you look at all the things that Abraham had went through in his life you know he walked with God that he backslid that he walked with God tried to give his wife away walk with God but everybody said boy you know it's a father of faith you know if we look at his life nobody want to follow him I don't you know because we look at him say Well that's that's not the example I want but you know what it's not that he failed it's not that he that he walked away he said he came back right right it's not that when somebody follows or has failures except when they when they get picked theirself up off the ground right and they keep walking like they say you know you're never you're never a failure until you quit that's when you fight yeah I'm right because you know what when you get back up you know what you're still standing you're still fighting all right if you fall down then you know what you can lay there yeah or you can get back up but if you get back up say you're not a failure right well because that's one that's what you know what you had to overcome that right that was something you overcame hey I overcame I failed and then I can move forward right and then we see Abraham all the things that he went through in his life but you know he started out wrong right you know God had to deal with it and keep working on them they had to keep him whittling away and he said you know get away from your family right you get out to the place I'll show you that's right and then he had this little problem with lot they said they said a leaving lot he's do I have to bring a lot along well you know that was just a throwing in the flesh for a while till they got rid of it and he said you know we can't live we can't strive together he said you know what he said you choose where you want to go and he said he said I'll choose the other direction right but you know what a lot had his eye on on the best or he thought was the best but you know what it led right into singing right he got there and he's like oh you know I swear I want to be I want to be down here on the planes boy it looks so pretty he said well you know he won't he wanted to be over by salt yeah well he got so close he got so close that way you know over by he ended up in so right that's what happens sometimes you get too close and you know it's like well I get this close I get this close that's where a lot ended up well you know what he ended up and he said it it vexed his righteous Soul daily to be in the place he was in yeah people in a mess right and then the next thing you know he ends up being captive he got captured yeah when the Kings went to battle they captured him right and he was taking off so you know what his brother had to go after him which I think was actually his uncle but you know he had to go eat three eight 318 men well that's a that's a resounding Army 318. yeah yeah well you know it's a you know I you know I just builds faith in you when you when you're going out to fight all these Kings and you only got 318 yeah but you know that's all they needed right right sink down and get tangled up in a lot of things all right all right so we appreciate but we we realize we have to be in living in the valley and uh here we read this morning of David been in the children of Israel facing the Philistines in your life you know the first things was one of the groups that they just continually uh give the children invisible fits they were all there you know so many times you read in the Scripture it was always the Philistines opposing them but you know here's here's a uh the children of Israel come into the face the battle facing the Philistines and you know they're just going through the motions because here you know because Goliath stands up there and he says why have you put your battle in a rain right or why why in our terms why are you putting why are you posing right why are you pretending right because you've set out your armor you have set your battle you've set your armies up like you're gonna fight but he said I stand here and I defy the armies of God right he said I'm looking for someone to come and fight me yeah and he said y'all just stand on the other side of the mountain they won't come down yeah and there he stood on stood in that Valley looking up at him and saying come on send somebody yeah all right and you know that's the way we act sometimes when we realize hey we're gonna have to face a hard situation Lord don't let me go through that right I don't want to go I don't stand on the mountain all right and here they're all sitting around looking at Saul because he's he's the king he's the he's the man that's Head and Shoulders above everybody else yep we can't be disturbed because he's he's making battle plans yeah he's in his tent he can't be disturbed right sounds like a lot of politicians yeah they're too busy doing anything else to but they need us neither here nor there yeah it doesn't matter if they don't do anything or if they do anything it's still wrong yeah but you know here they are standing there and looking down on this man and I mean he's a he's a bigger probably bigger than any of them have ever seen in their life right yeah this man standing there and he's looking for someone to come and fight him and nobody wanted nobody wanted to come out to him but you know David you know his dad send him down there to his brothers and he saw what was going on they could not believe that the armies of God stood there and acted the way they did right right and so and such as such a cowardly position and you know we know that David wanted to go and find him because David had an experience right you know you you look at a little ready fella that had a slingshot you know I wouldn't I wouldn't go with uh I wouldn't go with anything but a slingshot no brother Brandon said you probably couldn't kill a rabbit with a slingshot yeah yeah but you know they they and they knew what worked because you know Saul wanted to put his armor he wanted to put armor on David right but he's like I don't know how to use this though I've never approved any of this stuff I don't know anything about this but I know what I've been through all right I've had an experience exactly he said when I was on the back side of the desert he said it was only me between that lion and that sheep he said it was only me between the bear and the Sheep he said I was put on the back side of the desert to protect those sheep and he said I stood there and he said they came down and he said the spirit of the Lord Came Upon me and he said I killed him yeah and he said now we're standing in front of this uncircumcised Felicity yeah yeah he said a lion was only doing what it naturally does eats they went after praying to Bear the same thing but now you've got this man who's uncircumcised defying the god of of Israel right exactly and it's calling for somebody to come and fight him which is the same thing you know that's what the devil does to you he wants you he wants to make you look you know and put pressure on you and make you think oh will you come right but you know what David said I've got it we brought those brother Brown said he knew that he knew that he was anointed right he said he remembered Samuel pouring the anointing along him right he said and brother Brandon says where are the anointed in this state he said you've been anointed by the Holy Ghost he said where is the anointed today amen he said because you are anointed all right and he said he stood there and he said and David went out there and he said I want to fight scene oh yeah you know what David went across you you think about it this huge man is standing in this Valley and you're walking this little runny boy still left behind the ears going down this massive Valley this vast area all the eyes are upon him and everybody's standing there saying we're going to be him wouldn't want to be him yeah but you know what David had an experience right right and David stood there and he said you know and he went down through that Valley and he got down there to the water and he went down there picked those rocks up you know what and then and and Goliath you know he was just beside himself he said oh y'all got to send me yeah he said I'm just gonna put him on the end of my Spear and feed him to the birds this is the best job got y'all got Army sitting in a ray all of this Armor All these soldiers all you got is a little boy that's the best you can do but you know what it was all that was all that was needed that was all that was needed right and he stood there and when he walked out there he said he said you come at me with a spear and a sword he said but I come at you in the name of the Lord and he said you know what he said I'll remove your head from you this day yep right see here that's all David needed right why because he realized the battle wasn't his all right but you know what he had to walk in faith because the battle wasn't his right but he walked out there and he faced Goliath all right hey Black come at him but you know what he had power right right brother said David had a hidden power he said it was the blessings that was upon David the blessing that he had upon him why because he was going to be king right he was anointed he knew nothing was going to stand in front of him why because he knew what God had done for him and what God was going to do all right and you know what it became it became God's battle when when he defied that when he defied God right he wasn't David he wasn't the armies it was God but all he had to do was just go out there and be God's representative all he had to do was put that rock in the slang it didn't matter where he threw it right he could throw it anywhere but God had it Supernatural event all right that's right there's one he let go of that rock it hit exactly where it had to hit him right you know brother Brandon was talking about um hit uh was preaching at the at the Tabernacle and he was preaching only all of the resistance that David had you know he faced all this opposition why because nobody wanted him to do that all right everybody was so afraid they said you know what everybody got encouraged one day we went up there and killed him yeah well yeah right then everybody's like yeah we can take them now then everybody wanted to start following and doing something right they chase them but you know what we see that this today you know because we stand here this morning and we wonder sometimes I wonder if the Lord's going to heal me I want I wonder how long I'm going to have to wait yeah yeah man that's right you know I wonder about this and I wonder about that right well you know what he said he said if you come by faith if you meet the same requirements that someone else has met sure he said he's obligated to do it again that's right or he's a liar right so I mean we stand here this morning we look at we look at all the Miracles that's happened I mean we don't look at the Bible we look at what's happening in this just in this church right right you know I I can't remember who it was but it's just assistant Freedom somebody lost something somebody the other day was reading or my admit somebody on Facebook and they come down there somebody lost something and you know what I was thinking about that that I don't know if I I told it here I know I told some of you but you know I lost I lost the work keeps them to my work van and I was at the shop and I parked it and I left an awesome I couldn't figure out where they ran nobody could find them we looked all over the place and you know I've got it's a got a single door and then we've got a bay door and we've got double doors on each side of the building and I I lost them and we started looking for them and we had a job to do the next day and I had to find those keys and we look high and low I looked at home they looked at work everywhere and I said Lord I need to find those keys and we've got a and they've got a a little Grill sitting right beside the garage door and I looked high and low we all did we looked at everything we could find and I couldn't find them and I prayed that night I said Lord we need to find those keys over there hey brother Ron Spencer coming to me in a dream I walked it to him and your brother wrong last time you know where you know he'll wear a coat when he's preaching you know he takes a joke like we do and but he just had a little white shirt and that time everything came up to me and I said brother Rhonda can't find those keys I said I don't know where they're at they said don't worry brother he said you'll find them it'll be okay don't worry about it I woke up the next morning my boss called me I told him before I got to work like I said we found those keys he said they were laying on top of the griggle and I don't know where they came from but you know what God knew where they're at and God knew where to put them see I mean just like I think brother brother Dean right now they drove all the way to Greene County with a lock on the back of a pickup truck hand him off the trailer down yeah drove all that weight now got down there then the lock was still on there yeah I haven't had fallen off right and here he was David see all God's looking for is somebody to be fighting all right right right we can be faithful he can move on the scene but you know he was he was hindered and brother Brown said let's see this is from the message second hand robe he said I stood 10 years ago at this platform preaching on David and Goliath he said no he is it isn't that Goliath that's hindered me he said God slayed him before me yep yeah he said but the thing that hindered me is the lack of faith black is something that I know was around Church see Goliath was dead but the thing is it was a lack of faith right that's what hinders it's a lack of thought realizing hey the Goliath is dead yeah you know as the the scripture tells us that all power is permitted of God right now the powers that be are ordained of God right so you know there's God God overdains all things but you know glass glass was already defeated sure but you know what it's a lack of our belief right we fail to believe that right and that's what that's what hinders us and your brother Adam was talking about misters maybe something about the the brothers he said you know they weren't uh educated they said they follow they called brother Branham went out your brother Adam was uneducated you know Tony was going to pray for kings and potentates you know I was going to have this great Healing Ministry you know nobody would have believed that Dr Davis sure didn't exactly right but you know what he said he went out there and started preaching then he saw my brother Roberts and all these other brothers started falling right come out on the scene he said you know they were uneducated they didn't raise them but they had Faith to bully right right to go and take take on these these uh Devils all right the show that God had had the anointing was upon the people right that God had poured out his anointing that you know we could overcome amen and you know because we realize that if um there wasn't questions and answers brother man I'm standing there you know what you know we read this a lot he said because brother I'm talking about the anointing the anointing being upon the people the other day says you know when the when the doors of the Gentiles is closed right he said then God will anoint um a church then right amen but you know what he said then he's doing it now amen right listen you know people people say oh well when the doors of the gym house is closed then he's going to anoint oh yeah but you know what he's doing it right now all right that's right but you know what we'll see we're sitting in a greater fashion then but you know what the anointing is already here because you know what we are anointed brother remember said this is the rapturing age we've entered into a Rapture name that's right man right and you know we've been anointed for that right yeah somebody's going to come to that place where that Goliath that stands in front of them is going to be defeated amen the death dance is not it's not going to hold them right they can't be held by dead heaven you know what it's not it's not that you're going to bypass today huh you're gonna walk through him right you're going to defend me yes it's not something that you're going to go around right right it's not like because it's a door that we all have to face we all have to go through that door right he said door that you know just like the doors back there you have to go through those doors it's not some other way that you're going to go out right right but you know what when you reach that door death will have a hold on right right just like just like the Apostle Paul even though the Apostle Paul went down you know what he stood there and said death wishes you know where's your pictures uh victory death where's your sandwich all right you know here he is even though even though he's gonna have his head cut off you know what he realized that even death then didn't have a hold on man that was not that was you know what's your Victory that's right you can lay a hole on this flash but he said you can't touch me that's right amen because you know what you only have a momentarily hole on the flesh right it'll go down to the ground but you know what it'll come back up all right so you know what you're always only going to be a temporary hold right but you know it's not going to be permanent you know one of the things that always amazed me was in hey brother I was talking on the seals you know this and and the in the seals where it talks about the the rider with the sword you know the the second one come out and he had the sword and he said he comes to take peace from the Earth yeah but you know what right you can't take peace you can take their lives and and because they were anointed right right with a with a calf spirit with the ox Spirit they were anointed for sacrifice right you know you can't take something if somebody gives it up freely that's right amen right you know it's hard to rob somebody who wants to give you something right right you know because you know what that takes all the victory out of it right because you know what the victory lies with the person that gave it man yeah because when they stood there and I can't remember which one it was but you know the um I was reading the other day you know famous people you know hate anymore to be tied to the steak polycar green want to be tied to the state stand there right you know I know and you know you go back brother and uh brother I was talking about the fox's book of Martyrs you go back and look at the different ones that was in the in the fox's book of Martyrs you know they was they tied they tied a a millstone around one man's neck and he stayed in the water and he preached for hours before he went under yeah tied to a millstone see you you look at this you know they they had that anointing you know what that was Victory to them you couldn't take that away from them 09 uses you know the Devil comes to try to take things away from us you know what you know we realize sometimes we don't realize but later on we'll realize then you know it's a blessing in disguise we ain't gonna thank the Lord did you know because you know what he's the one that drives as those spirits that came out here to that hundred thousand hundred thousand thousand Devils that was poured out you know It Came Upon the juice he said it drove them back to the Homeland he said it was poured on the right by the driver back to the word exactly amen you know we think we think well you know it's it's a it's a hard time it's it's a terrible thing you know what it's glorious if you can look at it because you know that is that is bringing you to the place you ought to be you know people ask me all the time you know how am I doing I'm doing great all the time right now man hey you know what I'm doing bad I'm doing good right exactly I do great I do fantastic yeah brother and brother brother Ray I'll tell you all right he asked me how I'm doing super fantastic yeah he said that's all right no it's super fantastic but you know what you walk it you walk in in the atmosphere that you create amen you create that atmosphere you walk in it you know it's just like just like the Hebrew children you know they had to go into a fiery furnace but you know what they created the atmosphere that that their environment didn't have any effect on them right they went down there and said hey we're not going to bow we've made up our mind even when it was seven times hotter and the guards that were trying to put them in there were killed you know were killed but they they didn't die didn't have the smell of smoke on them didn't have a sense hair was not anything wrong with them they were bound got thrown in and next thing you know they're walking around free in the midst of the fourth man when Nebuchadnezzar looked in he said you know well I thought we threw three in he said they're down they're walking around and he said in the midst of the fire he said you see the one that looks like as under the Son of God right right walking around they come out and they were just fine had absolutely nothing wrong with them right and we know oil together that happened a long time ago well that was for somebody else you know what he is the god of impossibility still here this morning you know what those men those men that went into that fire you know what they were baptized with the Holy Ghost you know what they were not born again right and we know about you know we've reached because we 've received justification sanctification baptism of the holy we've been placed into the body we have become what he is right exactly and then we think well you know that's just too hard no it's not no all right because you know what he takes care of us right right man you know it doesn't matter what what comes our way he's there and he's watching over us but you know what it becomes our confession it's what we believe is what we say right there he knows that's exactly what happened to David right David David walked in his confession and walked while he believed amen and he meant and even and even later on you know the Philistines came back let me know that yeah and and second and second Samuel we find out that after David was anointed king and became king and rolled you know what the Philistines didn't like him right right imagine that the man who had killed who had killed their champion he came back to kill him yeah and you know what he was standing there and looked like and you know he was David was had gathered his armies and what standing there was praying to God about going into the valley to face the Philistines again and you know what you know what God told him you know he wouldn't know about how he was going to face them and he said he said when you hear the rustling and the mulberry bushes he said I will be going before you Gloria he said then you'll go in and he said Daniel samite the Philistines right that's right amen and you know what brother random said that's what's happened today you know because the the anointing is still moving the spirit is still moving in the mulberry bushes they still wrestling before us right that we are to move forward right and I believe it's uh invisible Union is that where he said he said you know the move is on right for the bride he said we have entered into the rapturing age right he said it's thus saith the Lord he said we have we have reached this place because if if the move was on for David when the wrestling and the mulberry bush had much more for us today right and that's what he says he says it's it's got to be it's got to be something it's moving right now friends the move is on for the bride that's the truth that's safe for the Lord right see the move is on today for us yes it's moving he's either before us for moving us forward and it's thus saith the Lord right well because there's a place for you and I to go to right right exactly yeah see sometimes we wonder God is moving sometimes he's trying to get us to see what's happening amen because you know but as Brethren said you know we always look at the past and we're looking at the future but he's moving right now right he's right before us moving all right he's calling for us to move forward and then we go foreign look at the the life of Abraham and I've got I don't know probably got a dozen dozen characters and and different scriptures and things to look at this one I know we're gonna get all to them but uh I just loaded up I just it's like you start looking at one thing and something else comes and you start looking at that and you find something else there's another one right keep battling yep but because you see it all through the Bible but Abraham brother and says and and uh catch his face produces goods 1958 he said it was Abraham called from the city of UR the city the land of the Chaldeans the Gentile he said he was down in the valley of shinar yeah just an ordinary man but God spoke to him when he was 75 years old his wife Sarah 65 been married since she was about 18 no children and God told Abraham that they were going to have a baby right and Abraham believed God and he called anything contrary to what God had said as though it was not believing and that God was able to keep his promise so you know he started out in the in the valley we all did in sin then our worshiping Idols right that's right and even right but you know God come and got us all right and brought us out and speaking to Abraham and told and told told Abraham you know it was a it was an unconditional Covenant I'm so glad he has that for us you know whereas as the children of Abraham Glory well you'll see you know he has he has it for us it's not anything that we've done right amen he see us it's by his grace yes we are what we are yes and you know he was leaving through all the things that he had to go through 25 years of walking believing that he was going to have a son right all the things that he went through all the thoughts and failures that he had you're looking you know a lot of times you'll hear people say you know is well you know Sarah laughed Sarah well you know Abraham did too yeah exactly but you know you look at all the things that Abraham had went through in his life you know he walked with God then he backslip then he walked with God tried to give his wife away walk with God and everybody said boy give us a father of faith you know if we look at his life nobody want to follow him I don't you know because we look at him say Well that's that's not the example I want but you know what it's not that he failed it's not that he that he walked away because he came back right right it's not that when somebody follows or has failures except when they when they get picked theirself up off the ground right and they keep walking amen like they say you know you're never you're never a failure until you quit that's when you fight yeah right right because you know what when you get back up you know what you're still standing you're still fighting all right if you fall down then you know what you can lay there yeah or you can get back yeah but if you get back up see you're not a failure right well because that's one that's what you know what you had to overcome that right that was something you overcame hey I overcame I failed and then I can move forward right and then we see Abraham all the things that he went through in his life but you know he started out wrong right you know God had to deal with it and keep working on him had to keep him whittling away he said you know get away from your family right you get out to the place I'll show you that's right right and then he had this little problem with a lot they said instead of leaving a lot he'd allowed to bring a lot along but you know that was just a throwing in the flesh for a while till they got rid of him and he said you know we can't live we can't strive together he said you know what he said you choose where you want to go and he said he said I'll choose the other direction right but you know what a lot had his eye on on the best or he thought was the best right but you know what it led right into sin right he got there and he's like oh you know I swear I want to be I want to be down here on the planes boy it looks so pretty well he got so close he got so close that way you know over by he ended up in so right that's what happens sometimes you get too close and you know it's like well I get this close I get this close that's where a lot ended up well you know what he ended up and he said it it vexed his righteous Soul daily to be in the place he was in yeah people are going to make us right and then the next thing you know he ends up being captive he got captured yeah when the Kings went to battle they captured him right and he was taken out so you know what his brother had to go after him which I think was actually his uncle but you know he had to go get it 38 318 men well that's a that's a resounding Army yeah 318. yeah yeah well you know it's a you know you know and just builds faith in you when you when you're going out to fight all these Kings and you only got 318 yeah but you know that's all they needed right right man and there he goes out there you know hey hey fights and he is able to deliver his brother lot all right bring him forth good and you know when he when he comes out of when he comes back he comes back to the um back to the valley of let's see it's first it's Genesis 14. it's 14 17. it says in the king of soda went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Shadow Lamar and of the kings that were with him in the valley of Shabba which is in the Kingsdale they may have cancer Nick the king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and was the priests of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abra yeah Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which have delivered by the enemies in the other hand and he gave him uh tides of all that's right and your brother remember says so when he came back as brother said he was he'd come back to conquer the victory he came back with his Fallen brother he said why because it's just like you and I yeah we are to go after right a fallen brother he said you know what because God doesn't leave a predestinated seed behind right we go after and he was going after and he came back when he came back into the valley of Shabba and Melchizedek met him he paid tithes and they had communion yeah and brother and him says and I had to go I done a little a little searching because all right because in in the message the future home brother man says he met Melchizedek the king of it and gave him time which had no father no mother had a beginning of Life or end of life Abraham met him and they took communion amen right on the little spot where the city will be raised up the holy mountains of the Lord where the redeemed bully all right we don't I got I got interesting because they met in a valley amen amen he met Melchizedek in the valley Shava the how in the world is he how's the mountain coming up because he said he's going to split the Mount of Olives right I don't know how is that right do you know what's between mountains when you look to see where the valley of shavai is and you see where Jerusalem is and you see where the Mount of Olives is I was looking on the map and I bet they're within a mile or two right there at that one little spot right there exactly brother Brian said the literal spot where they'll come up you look at that see it's gonna be 1500 Miles Square that's a pretty big spot yeah right but he said right there in that little spot he said that's where they'll come up all right in the valley of Charlotte yeah that's the reason that's the reason I love it so that's good there will be peace in the valley for me yes yes because you know what they're there he met the king of Peace yeah page one because president said that was that was showing it was all over with all fighting see they're coming today we're going to reach a piece all the fighting and War will be over with we're going to be in a place of perfect peace thank you we see continuing on you know Isaac Isaac had to face the Philistines right you know Abraham and Doug Wales oh yeah it had and had whales different places but you know the fullest things filled them in and follow them and you know what he had to go and dig out the whales had to get back to the water Isaac had to because the Philistines had built him in right he had to go out there and did all of them out in the valleys and then he had to keep going and dig other whales right and he was in uh in the city of Guerrera the herdsmen there you know they they were they were fighting over the whales sure he dug one well and then he had to leave right they had to fight another you know then it's all over another right and he had to move from there right right and then he had to go dig another way yeah I'm gonna try and he found out yo there's room for us all man right and so it was always it you know there's always been a struggle but you know what the water came forth amen that's right you know what Isaac got to The Living Water but you know it was a struggle to get there he had to fight his way through there that's right see it's it's you know it's going to be a battle it's going but you know what it's there for you he overcame but you know what God led him to the places and he overcame and he had to dig those Wells to get to that water right right you know that's what you have to do how do I get closer to you right they said reading and then reaching you know brother said read your Bible and pray right which is so hard to do Lord how am I going to get closer to you read your Bible and pray yeah well if you're feeding on that you say Lord yeah every you know how many times have you ever tried to open your Bible or or turn it I can I turn I've got the little iPod brother Nani gave me turn it on and you sit down you listen yeah so why because you enter into that perfect risk right right thank you it's a little slow catching on backpack that's what he said you know talking about pouring out the oil and the wine you know right he said you know stimulation of Revelation was the line I said that's what happens a lot of people they get so stimulated to put something else you know yeah they come to church and they get so stimulated right all right right we've entered into our arrest all right all right it's a it's a it's a battle you've got to work for right right right you you have it's something that you have to work through that's right I mean you know I there's there's other ones and uh you're like Moses and Joshua you know Moses and them have to go through when God told them that they were going to a landfilling with milk and honey so we're coming out of this place right you know this all of the all of the pressure that they were in and Egypt being oppressed and all the things I had to go through we're coming out we got where they ended up first first place they left when they left Egypt well the first thing you know you know it goes through the first thing I want to talk about is is compromising yeah you know Pharaoh Pharaoh wanted them to compromise that's right but you know what they didn't compromise on right there was no compromise no we're all going out right we're not leaving nothing behind We're not gonna leave anything behind and when we leave it's all of us all of us everything that we own everything will be going and where did they go he said well you can go the next thing you know favorites are we drop behind them where do they end up Mountain on one side all right nothing on the other all right ready to see in front of them right they're down in the back and watch the first state where's the first thing they do we're going to let them milk and honey and all of a sudden Moses why did you bring us here all right do you not know what you're doing that's right just a much I'm already complaining all right and you know anything rattled Moses he's like Lord what am I going to do look where I'm at all right and he said what'd he say he said don't don't cry to me he said speak the word and go forward one because your commission was to go into the land of milk and honey he said girl you're going into the land that I show you he said why are you complaining he's what you're doing is going forward yeah I'm gonna try it so what do you do you go up there and he spoke to them to the Red Sea and it parted right and they were able to walk upon all the dry grounds see and so when we have we have these problems that rise before us it's like Lord how am I going to make a way how am I how's this going to work out you know what it doesn't matter it's do you can you put your mind on on his stuff say you know what he'll make a way but because he's promised he's going to make a way but you know what it may not it may not be the way that I want it to work out but you know what it'll work out in his in his time and his to his Perfection all right amen and there he stood and so they were able to cross over into the land flowing we're milking honey right they were able to go into the land that God had made for them you see God had made a way for him and even when they got in and you know they were going into the land and everywhere they everywhere they went they had you know there was a valley yeah they run into running those fine folks called boab people of Moab you know they were wonderful books because Brethren said they were just as fundamental as sure as they were sure they were right mail built five you know built the seven altars had the seven sacrifices had everything set up just perfect oh we're all the same all right but you know the problem was rid of them said Moses catered to God and Balaam was catering to the world right right he was catering to bailock he wanted to do what he wanted to do and so that was the problem see one was catering to what what God wanted oh yeah because that's what he was trying to do right Moab just wanted to muddy the water right and that's what he was trying to do and here there they were down in that Valley but you know what Joshua was just trying to get through right he was just trying to lead the people through right yep and there they are on their way through the biggest problem that the children of Israel had was he said they stopped they said that was their biggest problem he said they kept shouldn't have kept on going but you know what when you stop he said that's when that's when you set up for whatever amen amen oh yeah and he said that was their problem they stopped in Moab and they started dealing with poet right they said it just keep on going man because because God told them before they went in don't look on the things of these people right don't look on the way they act right don't look at the things that they do he said keep your eyes on the prize keep your eyes on the go just keep going through exactly but you know what Moab was a you know they were able to tell them oh you know we're building these altars you know we're just as fundamental As You Are but you know what and I got their eyes off of what they were supposed to be doing and then all of a sudden when that happened the next thing you know they're messed up right right as you know Baylor sent the uh the invitation you know they went to belfior you know worshiping idols getting wrapped up in in all these things that they weren't supposed to do and I believe the scripture says that there was I think it was 42 000. right say God God's not playing around he was trying to lead them through and you know what the ones that the ones that were not did not believe the mixed multitude they fell by the wayside but you know what all the way through God was leading them and God had a place for them right all the way through you know each one of those cities that you come to you know there's a um of a significant to each one of them and uh well one of them I want to get to was there was a city this massive wall of the city that was just so so great probably one of the biggest walled cities there was I believe they had Cherry races on the top of it and it's called Jericho Jericho was this you know Jericho just wanted to win the city I mean it was a monstrosity I guess you could call it I mean it was just this huge massive place and it was in the valley because when you go down into the valley Jericho's there they're close to Jordan when you come down into the valley of the Jordan River there that's where Jericho is right right and you know here they are and you know they go into the end of the land and you're they're gonna drive out the advantage when they come to this place and they and you know you you look sometimes we just talk about the Jericho we just say the name but sometimes if you get it in your mind you look at the massive place this was they're having Chariot braces on the top this huge place and you know what God telling them said you know it's not going to be swords and Spears okay we're not going to try to break down the castle Gates but all we're going to do is March around right and he said you don't look at them you don't say anything you don't do anything all we do is March first day we go down there we walk around and you know that was that was a that was a little bit of a walk if it was that big you know you know you just didn't walk around it and you know it's like it's not like a little brisk walk you know I mean it's like you know you take your lunch with you right right you know make sure you add your good shoes on because we are going to be walking a while yeah and we walk around this thing and then the next day we come back and we walk around it but then he says you know that sound thing we're gonna walk seven times but you know what if you walk around that thing all you know once every day by the time you get to that seventh one you know you better have ate your Wheaties yeah right because you got a lot of walking in front of them that's right to go walking and walking and walking you know sometimes sometimes we just fail it's like well it's like walking around the church you know I think some of us would probably get wind and walking around the church seven times you think about walking and walking and walking and walking and then when you get done while I walk him you know what you got to do someone's got to blow on the ram horns right and then they got a Yale yeah you gotta be a pretty good shape you won't get much out of me I don't think if I had to walk all that distance and then have to do that yeah but you know what that's all they had to do was walk around this this massive and you think about that this huge place that they were standing in front of and that's all they had to do was walk around and then shout right damn it God's working and you know unusual way right and he said the ground just opened up the wall system fall down they fell down in the ground you know when they excavated Jericho you know they they said that the walls actually just opened the ground opened up it just it's down in the ground if you'd excavate a Jericho they actually found the walls are just down in the ground right when it shook and it dropped it just dropped down right and you can imagine all those people said about you know this group ain't you know was it two and a half million two million people come in there children and all right yeah how big do you think they are right yeah I mean you know if they get out there and try to chop on the on the the walls you know the gates to the city or whatever you know it's gonna take a little while you know that's right you know they'll probably get tired but you know what I just kept walking around like what are they planning on doing are they surveying on the land but all of a sudden you're standing there and you think you think everything's okay they had their mind and this great Fortress right but all of a sudden when everything starts shaking yep can you imagine when the all of a sudden opens up and you look out there and there's nothing between you and them right there's nothing there right in an instant you're all your your uh protections no yeah you know I think I think I would just stop right there but you know the scripture tells us even before that you know when Rahab right you know Rahab was in in um Jericho you know the spies had come in and they and then I had left and you know she had made a promise with them about having the silver the Scarlet thread tied in the window and you know her house would not be destroyed everybody that was in her house could be seen right yes yes and you know she stood there and had that one little string tied in there but you know what you know even even she told them don't despise you know again after after what God's done I mean there was no fighting right you know there was no fighting because you know there's no way to stop them right but here they are thinking we're just gonna hide behind the walls oh yeah I think I would have just died right there yep got these huge amount you know massive walls and next thing you know they're gone so there was no fire yep there's no way to fight nope and so you know we look at things that are impossible but you know what With God all things are possible he makes a way when there's no way right so he opens up open up the walls and they went right in right there all the way through he made a way right and I've got a I got a few more though I'm trying to get to it's 20 to 12 now but I'm gonna just hit a few Elijah and Elisha you know Elijah was was uh walking in Elijah started following Elijah and brother Brown said that was the type of of a church in Christ right right he said he went to he went to gilgal and you know every time he followed you know the people were telling him even even the school the prophets are told her told her license all right I'm just gonna be taken away from you right that's right you're actually going to be taken away from you but you know and Elijah kept trying to get Elisha to stay right he said stay in Deal go he's like no he said as the Lord lived your soul living He said I'm gonna follow you right right and he said man from from Guild golf so he goes he's going further down next time you look at you look gilgall's here and then he's coming and the second place thing went was Jericho they come into Jericho and Elijah tells Elisha stay in Jericho he's no he said is the Lord and you're so limited he said I'm following you amen right he said why he said why is it he said why are you following me if you want from me he said I want a double portion of your spirit all right he said the spirit of God that's upon you he said I want a double portion and so he stood there and he said he said he said well that's all you've asked a hard thing he said but if you you know are able to see me when I go he said then it'll come upon you right and so he kept his eyes on him each time he said he went from gilgall Brother random said tight justification he said he went into Jericho with type sanctification yeah and he said he went to he went to Jordan the crossover Jordan he said which tied to baptism of the Holy Ghost which because it was death right but you know he kept falling he said he kept going down and down right now he walked with Elijah through the valley right yeah sure it's a struggle God God just don't give you you know you you don't go through justification just like that right so it's a work it's a process right each one of these things is a process well because some people they've reached justification but they never re-sanctification right some people come and save the vacation but they never come to the baptism of the Holy Ghost well because they're not keeping Their Eyes On Christ right as Elisha kept his eyes on Elijah he kept walking and he kept walking and he kept walking until they got down to Jordan right and when he seen him go then he came back you know picked up that mammal and he stood there and said where is the god of Elijah right I was able to smoke the waters and Colts back right right on dry left there he was you know you know he crossed over one time was able to cross over death and then he stood there had Supernatural powers he's able to smoke the waters and he crossed over he didn't get wet right you know what there's a debt for each one of us to go through you know what there's not another death that's going to hold us right you know exactly because we are dead because you know what I can't die again right I've already died amen right so death doesn't hold and there's and there's no way that you can spiritually die right well because you because you become a part of him you've taken on eternal life amen you've taken on the Life of Christ the life of God so you know what you're just you're just as Eternal as he is right right and then Elijah Elisha was standing there and he took on this and he said where is that where is the god of Elijah they walk forward where was the where was the god of Elijah right yeah there was Elisha and he had a double portion which was the spirit of God coming down yeah and you know what we have received a double portion all right all right man what did Brother Adam say what's the what's the what's the double portion he said it was the latter rain in the former rain coming together what is it he said it's a quickening of the word Glory that's right what have we what have we received in this hour right see we have received one because we've received not just the man we've received the profit right right right right because you know what the word has to come to the prophet sure and that's why and he was and say Elijah walk by what the prophet told me right so he was leading and he was walking with the prophet yeah see if you don't and you know it's not that we're walking with a man but we're walking with Jesus Christ will walk him because you know what with our brother Brandon we never would have had Jesus Christ in our house he had to come through Amanda there had to be someone come and speak to us the words that we can follow right and when we receive those words and we're able to walk then you know what we were able to do what he done right yes because you know what brother Brown passed away brother Brown went into the ground and you know what somebody is waiting for him to come up right right you know what is somebody somebody's got to speak yeah all right Justin Justice they took up that second-handed row and he smoked the waters you know what show you know because somebody's coming to the place that that that Jordan experience is not going to hold us right amen that we're able to cross over so where where is the god of Elijah where is the god of Elijah where is the god of wait and Brandon right you know what is it too old to say he's here exactly right yeah so that's all the bikes that I know where he's at all right yeah because he's got to get in me he's got to be in you you've got to be able to stand today right right and claiming just injustice loaded that where he can raise up and say you know what I've received my double portion right that's right because you know what this morning the latter rain and the floor rain has fallen it's not that something else is coming because you know what you're hearing the word the Holy Ghost is moving all right sure he said he said it was a teaching room the former Ray was the teacher where else are you getting tilt yeah I tell you I tell you what things that people have said in over the years I tell you what I have not ever heard what I've heard in Lula Georgia that's right amen but you know what it's Jesus Christ amen it's been Jesus Christ that's come down and you know we have been taught because you you know I I you know because I could I can look and I don't have times but you you look you take you take Romans 8 I read Romans 8. and you know what as brother Dale has preached over the years talking about Romans saying talking about the enmity of them and he said he said there is therefore now no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you know what I tell you when you come to that place you know what I cannot ever look at the book of Romans 8 as I've ever did in my life because one day it was like it was covered even though I read the words off the page it was like I was looking I was something covered I could not see it why because I was reading what some man said but one day all of a sudden that opened up to me and I was looking at something and you know what it wasn't that I was reading words it was something that I experienced in a place that I could see what was laying upon those pages became an experience because you know what now today I can look and say you know what I've got false and figures but you know what today there is therefore now no condemnation to whom them that walked in the after Jesus Christ walked in the spirits not after the flesh you know what there's no North now no condemnation amen exactly see if you continue on through there he said if God before us who can be against us right see he stood there and he says he said the creation is growing waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God see what he's crying he said we we received the spirit of God whereby we cry by father right right see when you see that you receive that Spirit then you know what it just continues on but you know what I can see just as just as brother Adam said that day when he stood there he said when I received that baptism my Holy Ghost he said I realized he said I was not the son of Charles and Ella Branham exactly see sometimes we just look at that that sounds good but someday one of these days just got to click in your mind to realize I'm a Son of God right now you know what this down here is just a temporal that's that we see right here but he said Paul said to things that we don't see are Eternal right what we're looking at is just a temporary housing but you know what I can see into the eternal thank you Lord see that's where we stand today we can look into the Eternal all right let's all stand this morning to musicians come but can you say that you can look into the Eternal distance amen see God is calling us that we can receive the word amen the Redemption of our bodies amen glory we have received that word exactly exactly to bring us to a Redemption of the body see that's where we stand this morning all right we have received the word of redemption right sure and you know what we've not would not received in its fullness right but you know we're waiting on the manifestation all right so there's a yeah we see that I just want to I want to share with a few of you that ought to get to them I'm gonna stop them probably pick this up some other time Ezekiel 37. the dry bones right Ezekiel was down in the valley of the drive all right exactly brother I'm talking about he said his flesh which was his body has been laying dead for years but it's gradually began to come in the Reformation right and now she's standing up on her face but you know what he said he took the prophet to speak right the word yeah and that's what Ezekiel had to do he had to speak for it to live right and you know what he said become an exceeding great Army oh yeah that's right but he what brother random said he said when the bride recognizes say she is right he said she'll be an invincible amen exactly so we can and and there's there's some other ones that blind Barnabas and some other ones but you know I'm gonna stop there but I think what I I thoroughly enjoyed looking at at those one because each one of those people they went through a valley right but you know what there was a victory there right they came to an event now that's right that's right exactly and you and have some other things I wanted to get to but I won't stop now because I don't want to go past 12. you see what God has done for us that's right God bless all right amen you know you say the Lord right you know we go through valleys but you know what that's where God's at right amen where did what did Brother Madam say grew in The Valleys right right is anybody remember lilies right right what is it what what do they get what do they get from lilies opium right what did Brothers say take out God's hope all right that's right phrase you from all your cares Glory you know they're side effects to God's opium you know that all right love joy peace brotherly kindness amen right well he said it was the fruit of the spirit yeah so you go down in the valley and that's where he's at that's right Psalms one brother goes in here and talks talking about these are those seeds how about the seed the sower sowed no one I'm just gonna share a few things but he said to see the solar sword he said where did it fall he said it fall in good ground right where did he say it fell in the battle right he said that's where the fertile soil is amen he said let me tell you about what happens in this Valley and he starts talking about Psalms one and it shall be planted by the rivers in order they said what were that Rivers he said the Old and New Testament right growing in the rivers of water all right can't be plucked up doing a big flourishing in that Valley I didn't have time to get to all that this morning but I just want to share that with you that's a lot of a lot of good things Glory I hope it's been a blessing to you because it's been a blessing to me man exactly 470 the move is on Amen no one here foreign foreign and I know Amen brother Keith Brown done that one that's the only person that song I remember that he done I think it was other ones that hang out with that one but I always think about that when he says the profits you've heard is giving you the word yeah and I know it's time to move home right I mean we've heard the word that's all right right amen amen thank you brother random said that everything we have needed for this Earthly Journey exactly amen we're blessed all right amen as we go this morning if we're getting anything to say anything when anybody's heart before we go and then look forward to brother Wade this evening and yeah God bless each one of you brother brother boy I remember Jonathan Jaden's been sick and I kind of took a call from cocoa but she had a virus infection bottle and now Jonathan's got his hands were swollen spaces we're getting ready to go this morning we're gonna dismiss the word prayer thanks brother Dale if you don't mind dismiss Us in word prayer father we thank you for the word that we've heard this morning yes thank you for your loving your grace and good thank you for the vegetable that broadcast to us we pray that you would just bless each one of us that in our hearts meditate upon these things and be more positive than you Lord and to look to you and realize that the end of allies we are in the place that we need to be so that would make a molding that will bring us to the mountain s we love you and we thank you God is now in Jesus name if we never foreign foreign foreign
