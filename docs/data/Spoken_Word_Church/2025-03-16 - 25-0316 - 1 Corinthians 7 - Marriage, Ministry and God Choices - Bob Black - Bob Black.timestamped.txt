[0:00] good morning and God bless you it's good
[0:02] to be in the house of the Lord and we
[0:04] sure enjoyed the service yesterday and
[0:06] looking coming from more this
[0:10] morning let's just go to the Lord in
[0:12] prayer before we uh get into the study
[0:14] Lord God we so grateful for your word to
[0:17] give us encouragement and strength Lord
[0:20] I pray God that you'll be with us today
[0:22] as we and guide us through these
[0:24] scriptures as we look at your word Lord
[0:26] grant it now Lord that you'll bless the
[0:28] service be with us today to give us
[0:31] exactly what we have need of we pray in
[0:32] your name
[0:35] amen so 1 Corinthians 7 is getting into
[0:39] I just got a little subtitle here
[0:40] marriage Ministry and making choices
[0:43] making good choices um of course you
[0:46] know Paul kind of he he he gets into
[0:49] marriage and divorce a little bit here
[0:50] and I'm not diving into that but just uh
[0:54] uh cover the high points a little bit
[0:58] and uh so what he says to kind of frame
[1:00] up you know uh if you don't think that
[1:04] Paul is difficult to understand you
[1:06] haven't meditated on it long enough you
[1:08] know many things that Paul says are are
[1:11] like Peter said they're they're hard
[1:13] they're hard to understand not just
[1:15] because of the way that he says things
[1:17] sometimes but because we're living in a
[1:18] different time where where you got kind
[1:22] of have to get into the spirit of what
[1:24] he's saying and and meditate on the
[1:27] context and all of those things so to
[1:29] set the the context in in uh verse 26 of
[1:32] this chapter he says he's he's framing
[1:35] up all of these things that he's talking
[1:37] about with marriage you know be staying
[1:39] single and whatnot he says I suppose
[1:40] therefore that this is good for the
[1:42] present
[1:43] distress so consider those things as we
[1:46] look at the the present distress is in
[1:48] in that time that they were going
[1:50] through there was there was a lot of
[1:52] persecution and it was rough on
[1:55] Believers and uh it it's there there's
[1:58] so many stories that you can tell from
[2:00] the the early Christian faith I was
[2:02] looking at one where
[2:04] um the Roman Empire began to haul people
[2:07] uh and persecute them and kill them
[2:09] because they would go to people's doors
[2:11] and open it up and say well if you have
[2:14] any literature here then you're going to
[2:17] die for it so the the Christians of that
[2:20] time they begin to divide up and and
[2:22] they would say well some said what we
[2:24] should tell them we don't have any
[2:26] literature some would say well uh if you
[2:29] don't if you if you hide it then you're
[2:31] not really a real Christian so you you
[2:34] you're you need to if you're not being
[2:36] frank with them and saying we've got
[2:38] Christian literature in our house then
[2:40] you're not really a real Christian so
[2:42] that's the that that's the day and the
[2:43] hour that they were living in where it
[2:45] was it was rough uh you know we we uh
[2:48] you know in this day we get persecuted
[2:50] at school and people look at you strange
[2:53] and when you go to Walmart maybe
[2:54] sometimes and we're treated as an
[2:56] oddball but in the day and the hour that
[2:58] they were living in uh you you were
[3:00] going to die for your faith so uh and I
[3:04] I apologize I just realized this is
[3:06] super small but you just have to maybe
[3:08] just listen for a second the all these
[3:11] distresses the imprisonment torture
[3:13] execution that' haul you and to be to be
[3:16] killed by lions Jewish opposition on
[3:19] every hand you know the Christians were
[3:21] facing the uh the the the opposition
[3:25] from Jewish authorities which would beat
[3:27] them and stone them and social isolation
[3:31] and rejection and economic hardship you
[3:33] say you're a Christian now you don't
[3:35] you've lost your job you you've lost
[3:37] your trade
[3:38] Partnerships now they're refusing to
[3:40] participate with you because you're not
[3:42] going to the temple the Corinthian
[3:43] Temple and participating in their Pagan
[3:45] practices cultural pre pressures and
[3:47] moral corruption legal and Civic
[3:50] restrictions loss of Rights and
[3:52] privileges they take your property away
[3:54] because they knew that you were a
[3:55] Christian forced Exile push you out of
[3:58] the city push you out of everything that
[4:00] you knew and and risk of betrayal from
[4:02] your family and from from friends and
[4:05] all of that psychological and emotional
[4:07] stress so so that kind of frames up that
[4:10] Paul's saying he's trying to advise and
[4:12] give wise counsel on how to live in
[4:15] these
[4:16] times and and you know there's so many
[4:19] other places where brother where where
[4:21] Paul would say that marriage is a a
[4:23] really good thing and in in Proverbs
[4:25] we'll start with that whoos so findeth a
[4:27] wife findeth a good thing and he Hebrews
[4:30] 13 Paul said marriage is Honorable in
[4:32] all and the bed
[4:33] undefiled and in Ephesians 5:25 he said
[4:37] husbands love your wives even as Christ
[4:39] also loved the church and gave himself
[4:41] for it in Ephesians 5:28 he says so
[4:44] ought men to love their wives as their
[4:45] own bodies he that loveth his wife
[4:47] loveth himself and Ephesians 5:33 he
[4:50] said nevertheless let every one of you
[4:52] in particular so love his wife even as
[4:54] himself and the wife see that she
[4:56] reverence her husband so marriage is an
[4:58] institution is is a is a biblically uh
[5:01] it's it's something that God has always
[5:03] encouraged and and and you know I'm
[5:06] reminded of that table quot where
[5:07] brother R said somebody asked him at the
[5:09] end of his life what what do you think
[5:10] about marriage or whatever and he said
[5:12] if I had it all over to do again I sure
[5:14] would I sure would get married it's it's
[5:16] wonderful it's been
[5:17] wonderful I think anybody that's got a
[5:20] real good solid foundation marriage will
[5:23] say the same thing marriage is the best
[5:25] a good marriage is like the best thing
[5:27] ever it's it's just wonderful to have
[5:29] somebody that you can yoke up with and
[5:31] go through life together and and uh and
[5:35] have the same
[5:38] go uh you know when when problems come
[5:41] and and you're faced with situations you
[5:43] got somebody a buddy to go through with
[5:45] you and and that's why brother Rand
[5:47] would say I'm framing it up here in in
[5:49] the serpent scene message he said he's
[5:51] talking about Adam that a man man in his
[5:54] Spirit was both man and woman and woman
[5:56] is just part of man and that's how God
[5:58] wants marriages Mar a marriage to be ver
[6:01] to be so part of one another until our
[6:04] inheritance our life our thoughts our
[6:07] our desires everything is just yoked up
[6:10] until we're just we're just approaching
[6:12] problems together when a man takes to
[6:14] himself a wife and if she's correctly
[6:16] his wife a god-given wife she'll be just
[6:20] to him as part of
[6:22] him and look what he said that's the
[6:24] reason you have so many Scruples in
[6:26] marriage is because you go out and see
[6:29] some girl with pretty brown eyes or blue
[6:31] eyes or something like that some pretty
[6:33] figure and you fall for her first time
[6:36] she has her first baby teeth baby them
[6:38] teeth comes out and she gets wrinkled
[6:39] and old and then you want to kick her
[6:42] out and some of you women find some
[6:44] little boy with his hair slick down his
[6:47] Mam's lard can half dumped on
[6:52] him so y'all y'all think us preachers
[6:55] are rough sometimes he could lay it out
[6:57] could he and curly it'll all fall out I
[7:01] know that by experience but what happens
[7:03] what is it you fall for that you ought
[7:05] to pray first because a woman is part of
[7:09] you now ain't that the truth you look
[7:11] back in life and you can see so many so
[7:13] many times people will that like this is
[7:16] the most important decision of your life
[7:19] well we'll say second most important
[7:20] most important is to be born again and
[7:22] to follow Christ but but the one of the
[7:25] most important decisions in life and
[7:27] people so many times will just take it a
[7:29] happen passard approach like what he's
[7:31] saying here they fall for somebody that
[7:33] just will will tell them that they love
[7:35] them will tell them something and then
[7:37] then you're yoked up with that person
[7:39] for the rest of your life and it ends up
[7:42] you know ruining many experiences and
[7:44] things like that course you know we've
[7:46] got thank God we've got that promise
[7:47] that now if you ended up if you made
[7:49] wrong choices and somehow you wound up
[7:52] with a a spouse that doesn't believe and
[7:57] uh you know things aren't aren't right
[7:59] that over there everything will be made
[8:02] right but if you pray and and you go
[8:05] into it soberly and you really think
[8:07] about it and you enter in in uh knowing
[8:10] that this is what God wants you to do
[8:12] the marriage can be it'll be the the
[8:15] best thing ever it's it's
[8:18] wonderful and you you you testify those
[8:21] things to your spouse and that that'll
[8:23] make a happy marriage I tell my wife all
[8:25] the time I I I don't know what I would
[8:28] do without you because because a a a
[8:30] good spouse is just better than it's
[8:32] better than
[8:33] gold somebody that can uh I you know you
[8:37] you can talk to your spouse in a way you
[8:38] can't talk to anybody else and and just
[8:40] bounce ideas and things off of them and
[8:43] they become a sounding board almost and
[8:45] and and and that that is something to
[8:48] think that God didn't want us to go
[8:50] through life alone but to go through
[8:52] life with somebody that we can partner
[8:54] with and not just partner with but be
[8:56] part of us so that we have the same
[8:59] inheritance the same everything now so
[9:02] we get into Corinthians and Paul's
[9:04] trying to frame up to the Corinthians
[9:05] he's he's straightening up their
[9:07] thinking now isn't that the wonderful
[9:09] thing about the word of God is we think
[9:11] one way and then we look into the word
[9:13] of God and it starts shaping our
[9:15] thinking it starts changing our mind to
[9:18] where we're thinking like
[9:19] Christ so you saying now concerning the
[9:23] things whereof you wrote unto me it it's
[9:25] good for a man not to touch a woman this
[9:27] is what we tell the young people when
[9:28] they go to camps and everything you you
[9:31] know don't you can't be holding hands
[9:33] you if you going if you're going to hold
[9:35] hands you got to do it with a stick
[9:36] between you because you you you don't be
[9:40] touching uh because that leads to
[9:42] problems he's nevertheless to avoid
[9:44] fornication let every man have his own
[9:46] wife and let every woman have her own
[9:48] husband let the husband render under the
[9:50] wife due benevolence and likewise also
[9:52] the wife under the husband now what's he
[9:55] saying he's so some of the Believers in
[9:57] Corinth They Come Away with all these
[9:59] ideas is that that some thought that
[10:01] abstinence even within marriage was a
[10:03] sign of Greater Holiness isn't that
[10:05] funny how we get get away caught up with
[10:07] these ideas sometimes that you're
[10:09] married and and and if you just you just
[10:11] be real Pious and just stay away from
[10:13] well well we we don't do those things
[10:15] the rest of the world does that but not
[10:17] us so Paul's bringing them back to
[10:19] alignment like I if you're if you're
[10:22] married you know render to one another
[10:25] and I'm I'm saying this in a in a you
[10:29] know what I'm
[10:31] doing other others may have been
[10:33] neglecting their spouses that causing
[10:35] unnecessary Temptation and and in verse
[10:38] four he says the wife hath not power
[10:40] over her own own body but the husband
[10:42] and likewise the husband hath not power
[10:45] of his own body but the wife ha not
[10:47] power means that neither spouse has
[10:49] exclusive control now look look what the
[10:52] devil wants to do the devil's always
[10:54] about control one one will have control
[10:56] over the other the nickan spirit wants
[10:59] to control the balum spirit wants to
[11:00] have control The Jezebel spirit wants to
[11:02] have control it's all about control God
[11:05] wants to have control too so what he's
[11:06] saying is that that this verse is
[11:08] framing it up so that you're not selfish
[11:12] you're not trying to control the other
[11:14] the wife's not using intimacy as a way
[11:17] to control if you don't give me what I
[11:19] want then I'm going to withhold and the
[11:21] husband's not trying to dominate his
[11:23] wife and control but they're they're
[11:25] both yielding to one another neither one
[11:27] of them is having power power over the
[11:30] other but they're both yielding now
[11:33] there's that scripture that that says do
[11:34] unto do do unto
[11:36] others therefore all things whatsoever
[11:39] you would that men should do to you do
[11:41] ye even so to them for this is the law
[11:43] and Prophets but you know we we get well
[11:46] our mind when we look at this we we'll
[11:47] slide right over to the carinal but
[11:49] there's so much other things that's
[11:51] wrapped up in this scripture that you
[11:53] know like
[11:54] let's when your wife wants to spend time
[11:57] with a husband that coffee time in the
[12:00] morning it you know so many times we
[12:04] maybe men don't want to hear what what
[12:06] their wife has to say or listen to her
[12:08] or whatever almost you know you can get
[12:11] maybe caught up and thinking it's like a
[12:12] nuisance or a bother or something but
[12:15] you know spend your wife wants to spend
[12:17] time with you and she wants to share
[12:19] that the same thing with the husband the
[12:21] husband wants to spend time with the
[12:23] wife I I think one of the most one of
[12:25] the most precious times for me is that
[12:28] coffee time and the morning when you
[12:29] wake up and and you're getting the day
[12:32] started and you you get that coffee
[12:34] brewed and I just sit and and talk to my
[12:36] wife and we'll talk about the day and
[12:39] what we're going to what we what we want
[12:42] and uh life and things like that and
[12:44] you're just and you're just talking uh
[12:47] you're spending time with one another
[12:49] right now now that way you're not you're
[12:52] not jostling for power you're not
[12:54] jostling for control and it and it
[12:56] removes all the barriers and hindrances
[12:59] well well he ain't doing this and that
[13:01] she don't she don't he he don't want to
[13:03] listen to me and all this kind of thing
[13:05] but you're you're you're you're you're
[13:07] Partners you're you're together you're
[13:09] spending time with one another
[13:12] fellowship and you you know go back to
[13:14] that other
[13:16] scripture we we always you know our mind
[13:19] always goes to the carnal but brother R
[13:21] would say that he would always compare
[13:23] that bedroom to prayer to Fellowship you
[13:26] you'll find whenever he would type the
[13:28] bedroom EXP experience he Compares it to
[13:31] prayer and fellowship and communion and
[13:33] when you go into the the outer Court
[13:35] holy C holy into that into that third
[13:37] chamber the private chamber with God
[13:39] you're fellowshipping with him and
[13:41] prayer and and that's really what uh the
[13:44] relationship between a man and a wife
[13:45] should be fellowship and communion where
[13:48] you're talking to one another and you're
[13:51] you're sharing those secret secret
[13:53] things that in the bedroom in the
[13:55] bedroom we talk about things uh frustr
[13:59] ations of life and you know your your
[14:01] children sometimes I I wish they would
[14:03] do this or whatever and things that you
[14:05] would not say outside of the bedroom the
[14:08] bedroom is the the place where things
[14:11] where real True Fellowship occurs now I
[14:14] I think that's what this scripture is
[14:16] talking about that one is not over the
[14:18] other this one's not over this one this
[14:20] one's not over this one but you're
[14:23] you're living your life for the other
[14:25] person in real True Fellowship and
[14:28] harmony
[14:29] he said defraud you not one the
[14:31] other except it be with consent for a
[14:34] time that you may give yourselves to
[14:36] fasting and prayer and come together
[14:38] again that Satan tempt you not for your
[14:40] incontinency now now look how look how
[14:42] he's comparing that personal communion
[14:45] intimacy with your spouse with prayer
[14:49] again another the only valid reason for
[14:52] temporary abstinence in marriage is for
[14:54] dedicated spiritual devotion I I I I
[14:57] think I look at these scriptures like my
[14:59] old friends my my buddies I used to look
[15:02] I used to read this scripture when I was
[15:04] just a a young man and what what I took
[15:07] away from this is that a Christian Life
[15:10] is supposed to be so wound up with with
[15:14] God and and you you're not going to have
[15:16] a happy marriage without God so look
[15:18] look what he's saying that you spend you
[15:21] spend your time with one another but
[15:23] then you withdraw from one another
[15:26] periodically to go and pray with God and
[15:30] fast and get along with God and and
[15:34] there you'll find the secret to a real
[15:36] happy marriage that's that's our problem
[15:37] we get so caught up with social media
[15:40] and all these kind of things and we get
[15:42] frustrated with one another and we ain't
[15:43] praying we're not we're not fasting
[15:46] we're not really serious with God and we
[15:48] get CAU up with with TV shows and and
[15:52] things of this world and problems at
[15:53] work and and this is the part that we're
[15:56] neglecting where uh it he he said you
[16:00] you you you Unite with your spouse you
[16:03] stay yolked up together with her except
[16:06] when you pray get give yourself some
[16:09] time to fast and pray now now there's a
[16:13] secret to a real happy marriage there's
[16:15] a secret to raising your kids when when
[16:17] you when you when you've got that
[16:18] newborn baby and they're crying at night
[16:21] that that's the time and your wife
[16:24] frustrated and struggling with it well
[16:26] that's the good time to go withdraw
[16:28] yourself to pray
[16:29] prayer and go pray over the situation
[16:32] and let God go to
[16:34] work and he said but I speak this by
[16:37] permission and not of commandment for I
[16:38] would that all men were even as I myself
[16:42] but every man hath this proper gift of
[16:44] God one after this manner and another
[16:46] another after that some some people are
[16:48] just able to live a single life some
[16:50] people need to be married one after this
[16:52] manner and one another after that I say
[16:54] therefore to the
[16:56] unmarried and the widows it is good for
[16:59] them if they abide even as
[17:04] I it's good and he's framing it up for
[17:09] contentment and and you know let's let's
[17:12] get real for a second we've all seen
[17:14] situations and things where somebody now
[17:16] they've lost their spouse and and they
[17:18] get lonely and they want to fix it and
[17:21] and then they go and make a rash
[17:23] decision and now they're yoked up with
[17:25] someone that makes their life miserable
[17:27] makes their life a living hell and and
[17:30] so he what he's saying is like let's
[17:33] before before you make a rash decision
[17:36] consider your consider the situation
[17:39] consider what's going to happen next be
[17:41] careful before you enter into a a an
[17:44] alliance an agreement that's going to
[17:46] last for the rest of your
[17:50] life but I speak this by permission and
[17:52] not of commandment for I would that all
[17:54] men were even as I myself but every man
[17:56] ha his proper gift proper gift of God
[17:58] one after this manner and another after
[18:00] that I say we just read that scripture
[18:02] but if they cannot contain let them
[18:04] marry for it is better to marry then to
[18:07] burn we all know what that means he
[18:11] saying celibacy and I took this I did
[18:13] not know that there was a an interesting
[18:15] little movie that they just made a few
[18:17] years ago about Paul Paul Apostle of
[18:19] Christ so I took this uh this might be
[18:21] what he what he might have looked like
[18:24] but anyway he say in celibacy singleness
[18:27] is a spiritual gift from God just as
[18:29] marriage is a gift from God he's not
[18:31] suggesting everybody should remain
[18:33] single nor implying that celibacy is a
[18:36] spir has a superior spirituality he's
[18:39] he's not demeaning marriage or implying
[18:41] that married Believers are second class
[18:43] he's not teaching that believer should
[18:45] force themselves into into a particular
[18:48] way he's just plainly stating that each
[18:51] believer must understand and embrace
[18:53] their unique gift from God whether
[18:56] single or marriage and live that
[19:00] way and unto the married I command yet
[19:03] not I but the Lord let not the wife
[19:05] depart from her
[19:06] husband and over on the side I got the
[19:09] three-fold
[19:11] core but if she depart let her remain
[19:14] unmarried or be reconciled to her
[19:17] husband and let not the husband put away
[19:20] his
[19:21] wife why cuz God wants us to just love
[19:24] one another he's we'll get in a second
[19:27] he's framing it up that even if if you
[19:28] got somebody if you got a spouse that
[19:30] doesn't believe maybe you can save them
[19:33] maybe your life can change the way that
[19:35] they look at things and they'll see by
[19:37] your salty life something that they're
[19:40] lacking in their own life but to the
[19:43] rest speak I not the Lord if any brother
[19:45] had a wife that believeth not and she'd
[19:47] be pleased to dwell with him let him not
[19:48] put her away and the woman which hath an
[19:51] husband that believeth not and if you be
[19:53] pleased to dwell with her let her not
[19:55] leave him for the unbelieving husband is
[19:58] Sanctified by the wife and the
[20:01] unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the
[20:05] husband else were your children unclean
[20:08] but now are they holy now is is Paul
[20:13] easy to understand what's that verse 14
[20:15] talking
[20:17] about do you know what verse 14 is
[20:19] talking about is verse 14 saying that if
[20:23] you are a Christian and your spouse is
[20:25] not a believer that that puts them in a
[20:28] state of now they're Justified and
[20:30] Sanctified is that where your mind goes
[20:32] what's he
[20:34] saying does that put make them
[20:36] automatically a Believer does does that
[20:38] make your children automatically a
[20:40] Believer and holy is that what he's
[20:45] saying does that mean that your children
[20:47] don't have to have their own personal
[20:49] experience is that what he's saying no
[20:52] that's not what he say so let's now
[20:55] let's examine it with the little time
[20:56] we've got remaining let's just kind of
[20:58] sit on this scripture the and and this
[21:00] is powerful that the unbelieving
[21:04] spouse is Sanctified by the wife not
[21:08] Sanctified as as it makes them
[21:10] automatically a Believer but look at the
[21:13] power that a believing Christian has to
[21:16] change the atmosphere in their home to
[21:19] change things in your home so much that
[21:21] it begins to affect everybody in your
[21:24] home that
[21:26] because a real Holy Ghost fi Christian
[21:30] is a like brother R said they're a
[21:32] Dynamo and and they're your presence in
[21:35] your home can actually change the way
[21:39] that everybody else in your home looks
[21:41] at things and reacts to things it
[21:44] changes
[21:46] things so we'll we'll frame it up like
[21:49] this the Holiness that the believing
[21:50] spouse lives out creates a spiritual
[21:54] atmosphere in the
[21:56] home the believer acts as a living
[21:59] example and conduit of God's sanctifying
[22:02] grace which spills over into the
[22:04] household even if the partner has not
[22:07] yet come to save in
[22:08] faith you got a believing a believing
[22:11] spouse in the home and and and they're
[22:14] not okay with the children wearing
[22:17] clothes that don't become a Christian
[22:19] they're not okay with that kind of
[22:21] worldly music and that atmosphere that
[22:24] they set well they they might go and
[22:27] pray in the evening or pray in the
[22:29] morning and the rest of the family can
[22:30] hear Mama or daddy crying out to God and
[22:33] that sets an atmosphere in the home I I
[22:37] wonder I wonder if our homes are like
[22:40] that I I remember when I just just
[22:43] before we got married talking to my wife
[22:44] about different things and she she there
[22:47] were there were ministers that had made
[22:49] a profound effect on her growing up and
[22:52] on me as well and and and we remember
[22:55] going into their homes and it's like the
[22:57] atmosphere in that home was such that it
[23:00] you knew this was a Christian
[23:03] home that's what this is talking about
[23:06] it it's not just a a dead letter where
[23:09] you're just doing your religion at
[23:10] church but the home is
[23:13] different well we've had people come to
[23:15] our home and and they they they that
[23:17] were going to do work on the home and
[23:19] they step into the house and they they
[23:20] smell that bread cooking and they they
[23:22] can just tell it's something's different
[23:24] and they're like this this is a a this
[23:28] is a
[23:29] home and and you know you got a home
[23:31] like that and when your kids are doing
[23:34] wrong they come across the threshold of
[23:36] that door and they're going to get
[23:39] convicted now that's that's what it
[23:41] means that the a spouse that believes
[23:44] will
[23:45] sanctify their other the other side of
[23:48] the
[23:49] coin and the message love he said oh I'm
[23:51] so glad to know that by Grace he put
[23:53] that in my heart that powerful thing of
[23:56] love it conquers you can conquer your
[23:58] husband if you won't go to church and he
[24:01] fusses at you for going just pray now
[24:03] don't try to put it on if you do it
[24:05] won't work but if you really get such a
[24:07] love in your heart for his soul he will
[24:10] know it don't you
[24:12] worry the husband is Sanctified by the
[24:15] believing wife vice versa you can't fool
[24:18] it you can't Bluff it it's got to really
[24:20] be there that's the reason we're genuine
[24:22] Faith people sometimes think they got
[24:24] faith when they haven't got it you've
[24:26] got to really have it I've seen thata
[24:29] same conquering power conquer faith and
[24:33] love together can conquer the the
[24:36] atmosphere in your home and change
[24:39] things so that the unbelieving family
[24:42] members start to get
[24:44] convicted the message love he said now
[24:47] the only thing you have to change the
[24:48] situation if that can be done in the
[24:51] home it can be done in a church it can
[24:52] be done in a nation it can be done in
[24:54] the whole world it's the atmosphere that
[24:56] counts the natural way to hatch an egg
[24:59] is put it under a hen because she keeps
[25:01] it warm but put it under the same kind
[25:04] of a heat and it'll hatch anyhow it's
[25:06] the atmosphere that counts that's right
[25:09] so it's the
[25:11] atmosphere and you make up that
[25:13] atmosphere with what you are inside of
[25:17] you Sanctified s i I've got this picture
[25:21] of of a cup that's dirty and it's in the
[25:24] dishwasher but it's got another cup with
[25:27] it and and now that's what happens when
[25:29] you got a Sanctified spouse that they
[25:32] they they're they're bring they're kind
[25:34] of dragging everybody along with them
[25:36] into that
[25:37] atmosphere I ain't dressing like that
[25:40] and my kids ain't dressing like that I I
[25:42] I'm not listening to that kind of music
[25:44] and my kids ain't listening to that kind
[25:46] of music and and you're living by a holy
[25:49] ghost standard and then that standard
[25:51] begins to trickle out into the rest of
[25:53] your life and because you're washed it
[25:57] begins to cause the other around you to
[25:59] have a a a a a have be
[26:04] influenced by your Sanctified
[26:07] condition like look at this picture of
[26:10] this this this this believing spouse
[26:12] that's maybe her husband behind her
[26:14] don't believe but yeah he sees her
[26:16] reading the Bible every day he's got to
[26:18] come home and from work and he sees his
[26:20] wife reading the Bible and and living a
[26:22] Christian Life and maybe it doesn't have
[26:24] any impact at first but over time it
[26:27] starts to have an impact on him on the
[26:29] way he's looking at
[26:31] things and he says else were your
[26:34] children unclean but now are they
[26:37] holy now he he's not saying that their
[26:40] children are not considered spiritually
[26:42] unclean or a disadvantaged because one
[26:44] parent does not believe they have he's
[26:47] saying they have full acceptance within
[26:49] the church having every spiritual
[26:52] opportunity to know God and be taught
[26:54] his
[26:55] truth what he's not saying is that there
[26:58] are automatically saved or that they
[27:00] they they don't need their own personal
[27:01] salvation but what he's saying is that
[27:04] because just like Timothy that his mama
[27:08] believed and his Grandmama believed and
[27:11] and now he he he had he had that special
[27:15] Advantage where he was able to to hear
[27:19] the word and so forth and questions and
[27:21] answers brother said my husband somebody
[27:23] said somebody asked him my husband and I
[27:25] don't see alike on the Bible the truth
[27:27] like this truth that you preach he
[27:28] doesn't understand should I go with them
[27:30] to churches when I don't believe they're
[27:31] teaching I'm very troubled about this
[27:33] yes if you're a wife to this husband and
[27:36] he don't condemn you you don't you
[27:37] mustn't condemn him see because the
[27:39] husband is Sanctified by the wife and I
[27:42] believe if he goes to some
[27:44] denominational church or something like
[27:46] that he wants you to go down there with
[27:48] him you see if you don't see there's
[27:50] nothing there can harm you because
[27:52] you're not going to listen to what
[27:53] they're saying anyhow cuz you'd done
[27:56] said here you don't believe they're
[27:57] preaching see so it ain't going to harm
[27:59] you but you're just showing respects to
[28:01] your husband you're yielding yourself to
[28:04] him now now I want to call this quote
[28:06] out if you ever just kind of look at the
[28:08] difference between a man and a woman a
[28:10] woman always she wants love she just
[28:12] wants love but a man wants respect
[28:16] that's the one thing that a man wants he
[28:17] wants his children to respect him he
[28:19] wants his wife to respect him now look
[28:20] what he's how he's framing this up and
[28:22] he frames this up the same way that Paul
[28:24] does the scripture always says wives on
[28:28] honor your husband respect your husband
[28:30] so forth cuz that's what a man wants so
[28:33] he's saying just respect your husband
[28:36] and maybe you'll win him
[28:38] over you're you're constantly running
[28:41] running him down and and you go out to
[28:43] eat and you're just trash talking him
[28:45] and that's that's not respecting your
[28:47] husband but but if you if you honor your
[28:50] husband even if he don't believe quite
[28:54] right but respect your husband and then
[28:57] maybe you can win
[29:00] him and we'll we'll close on this
[29:02] scripture but if the unbelieving depart
[29:05] let him depart a brother or sister is
[29:08] not under bondage in such cases but God
[29:10] has caused us to peace the musicians can
[29:12] come
[29:13] forward somebody said somebody asked the
[29:15] same question in brother BR he said go
[29:17] with your husband but don't be partakers
[29:18] of what they're doing see you're
[29:20] supposed to love your husband and love
[29:22] is what does it you just be real salty
[29:25] he'll get thirsty if there's anything in
[29:27] him don't join their denomination that's
[29:30] the way you'll win your husband by doing
[29:32] that but don't be arrogant then he'll
[29:34] know he's got just as much as you have
[29:37] but when you can show something that you
[29:39] have that he don't have that'll make him
[29:40] thirst To Be Like You the Sanctified
[29:44] wife sanctifies the husband to think
[29:47] that a life lived by the gospel can
[29:49] change the atmosphere can change the
[29:52] situation so much that it can make
[29:55] people want what you've got
[29:58] the Sanctified spouse sanctifies the
[30:02] other God bless you Saints
[30:05] [Applause]
