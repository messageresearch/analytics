bless you may be seated for a moment brother brand said the nicest thing you can say to anyone God bless you God bless you certain good to see you here tonight thank the Lord for giving us this opportunity as David said in Psalms 133 how good and how pleasant it is for Brethren to dwell together in unity and again our lord said in St John 17 when he was praying to the father that they may be one amen and how thankful we are we know it's the holy spirit that brings that Unity of the body in this time amen as brother Bram said the same holy ghost that justified the Lutheran that Sanctified the wesle that baptized the Pentecostals is uniting the bride for the Rapture in this hour and when we see the move of God how thankful we are for men like brother Wade who under the leadership of the Holy Spirit knowing that it would take the unity if there is anything we want to get that behind us and put it under the blood am we want to do that how thankful we are tonight to have brother Joel brown with us been known brother Joel for many years and we appreciate him and his ministry his lovely family we thank the Lord for our wonderful pastors here brother samale has meant so much to all of us all of us I remember when I was doing missionary work down in the grenan islands in a place called py Mara and I met this saint there and she said to me brother Andre I have a tape and I've learned so much on predestination and I asked her who is the pastor who's preaching on that Tex he said it's a brother Samuel Dale do you know him I said I know him very well am very well BL [Applause] you brother Dale we love you and we thank you amen for the ministry that God has given you has just been a great blessing to us to know our position predestination and for knowledge election ordination many things that you taught us over through the scriptures has helped us to know who we are and where we come from so we thank the Lord for precious brother Dale and we can't forget sister py his lovely wife and she is so special and such a beautiful her hand sister baby I'm not quoting from a country song but we love a lady that stands by her man God bless you rich amen how we thank the Lord for brother Wilson Richard Wilson what a teacher of the scriptures amen you know when I first heard brother Wilson many many years ago and there was a couple of Brothers Brother Joseph Canon and I Brother Moore and different ones and I thought my what a wonderful gift that God has placed in brother uh Richard Wilson's Ministry his life amen and brother Wilson you are indeed when Jesus or the Apostle Paul quoted in Ephesians 5 speaking of the gifts that God gave to his body office gifts yeah that he put for the perfecting of the Saints and one of those gifts not only pastor but also teacher to be able to teach and show us where we are in the scripture so let's just give the Lord a [Applause] hand and and of course his lady too sister James let's give her hand she's so wonderful we're we're their neighbors they've been there many years and so uh they were making reference to the neighbors but the other neighbors and when they were talking about the other neighbors I was telling my wife I'm glad we're not those Neighbors those are the bad neighbors we're the good neighbors but we thank the Lord for Sister Janice she is such a lovely lady and God has richly blessed her and her husband she's got a lovely family we were with him yesterday and just had a great time and and brother uh Terence and his wife they've been looking after his mom and dad there and so it's certainly get and then Brother Wilson's son also am and we want to say this how we thank the Lord Lord for you all making the sacrifices to come up from Georgia well in reality I am a Georgia boy born and raised in Mar so Georgia is always on my mind you know when when my wife is not on my mind George is on my mind that's right but I I'm I'm thankful for the sacrifices you all made all of you so I see you I know your names and when I can just thank Lord they come up I had tears rolling down my face when I thought Lord give them travel and mercies those that are coming up and when they stop to get something to eat or they get gas in their car and so it takes sacrifice to do that you did not have to come some wanted to come or not able to come but you did come and so I want to thank you all for coming and being with us and showing that as the Apostle Paul Paul said we're many members but we're one God Christ is our hand we're thankful for all these wonderful musicians that they brought up and of course I always thank the Lord for my dear friend Brother Joseph Canada and I want to say this you know and and then I'll hush I apologize you know being in the

nervous raise your hand if you're nervous I got mine up God is good I bring you greetings from Word of Life Church formerly Happy Valley brother a radi pastor and God is just good that's all we can say now it's not so much that you know who I am other than Joel Brown I'm just an old simple country boy from Virginia originally grew up in a holler no running water we carried in tote and fetch just like the prophet talked about just simple poor people and um you know but one day I met somebody who changed my life life forever now I grew up in the message per se I was about 2 years old my mom began you going have a seat just a moment my mom uh just to do a little bit of an introduction to get rid of some of my nervousness I know some of you are wondering cuz there's nosy people everywhere you go now this is just me I'm going to be me all right because quite frankly I don't know how to be anybody else so if you're looking for somebody that you can just tweak a little bit make them do and say what you want them to do y need that one okay so if you're looking for somebody that you can manipulate I'm not the man I'm not the person huh just a just a a simple simple guy but coming to know the Lord my mom was about I was about 2 years old and my mom started going to a message church so I grew up in the message and I was familiar with that voice but but one day when I I was uh in college actually almost 21 years old there was just something happened in my life and to this day I I I I don't remember the exactly what was said I went to a meeting on campus it was a minister there uh just a denominational guy and he heeld Services uh periodically on campus and I just went out of curiosity and just something spoke to me and said it's your time it's your your time so there was no uh flashing lights the ground didn't shake and all that but it was just my time and maybe something tonight will be said in this service that will change your life forever now there's two things that I'm certain of two things that I'm certain of for this service is that I'm a simple person and I know that I'm supposed to be here and because of those two things that allows me to know one more thing that there's going to be somebody whose life is going to be impacted now the the Bible tells us that those once you are converted strengthen your brother now I've come to say it this way those of you who are Sanctified who are saved and are okay in your walk with the Lord you can strengthen your brother your sister that's sitting beside you by saying Amen to the word of God because that amen will begin to create an atmosphere amen praise the Lord but God is good little un conventional this is totally completely out of the ordinary for me I was so I was talking about being nervous I was so nervous I forgot to print out my nose so don't don't be don't be fooled by this thing I don't I don't do it you know this this is not me this is not how I normally do things but so with that being so I know God's going to do something [Music] special amen God is good I don't think I'm going to sing I won't I won't do that I I I do sing but I don't think I will now so God bless you musicians thank you amen so this is a youth service how many young folk we got in the place tonight praise I expect to see every hand because see we're on our way to an eternal youth service so we're just getting in practice for that youth service let me ask that question again how many young folk we have in the building tonight okay y'all better catch up you say I'm 82 I'm 7 you're young you're on your way back too amen get stirred up tonight praise the Lord if you have your adoption paper stand with me your Bibles that's your adoption paper saints come on now I need some amens I can't do this by myself but the way talking about left-handed folk preachers and being in our right Minds I hope to give you my whole heart tonight not so much my mind that's the intellect but my heart something that th dropped in my heart to give to you tonight a special gift from God himself amen turn with me to 1st Samuel 17 1st Samuel 17 and verse 40 my my my isn't God good isn't he wonderful while I'm thinking of it my my wife my my two sons and are or three sons are here and some of our friends from South Carolina some of our family friends from South Carolina uh but one of one of uh one of the the young girls had a she had a a seizure episode right before they was getting ready to leave so you all remember her in prayer this the devil stirring once again right but God is good 1st Samuel 17: 20 so they they would have been here my wife would have even been here if she wanted wanted to come um 1 Samuel 17 verse 40 and it reads and he took his staff in his hand and chose him five smooth stones out of the brook and put them in a shepherd's bag which he had even in the script and his sling was in his hand and he drew near to the Philistine let us bow our heads heavenly father it's an honor and a joy to be standing before your purchase father tonight and Lord as I've already shared with the people I'm just a simple person and I have nothing Within Myself to bring I have No Agenda no objective I have uh no ulterior motive other than to show forth your glory and to express your heart to your people tonight oh God may we be changed by the things that we hear May that we be changed by the things that we receive and we know that your word is light and your word is life so illuminate our paths dear God by your very words your very presence change even more so now the the atmosphere in this room and you come on the scene and do what only you can do and do as you've done many times before and it's in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen you may have to se us it's good to know the Lord is it not but you know I was sharing with the brothers yesterday some of them even more so it's better to be known of him there are so many people that can say they know the Lord but does the Lord know you has he came and identified himself Within you the prophet tells us that in the message here ye him I think back in 1956 he says we must be inspired by the word of God listen that will bring God to his word and make it act and do like it did in the days of old so the word in itself will do nothing you can sit and you can read the word of God but the prophet tells us we have to be inspired by the word of God and sometimes I heard this just the other day sometimes when when we read the word of God there there's no effect there's no emotion there's nothing happens it it's just it's just dry but that don't mean we stop just because that's so because how you even in the natural run with natural food you don't stop eating just because you didn't like what you ate you come back and you get some more and eventually there will be something that will so Inspire your taste buds that you want to you want to go home and make that very thing so maybe something will be on the buffet tonight that will suit your taste and you will take it home you say I want to concoct that same recipe at home but to be inspired by this word of God now in our opening scripture and I I pray truly that I won't be long and I'm really not a long-winded preacher but I know a big God with a lot of things to say yeah I'll just I'll just place it that way is that all right but I I I want us to to just think of the thought uh this evening the choosing of the stones we're all familiar in fact this very story David and Goliath is probably one of the most told stories in all of the scripture we've learned it since we were just a little bitty times little bitty things and and so we've heard it over and over and over but something a few months ago activated my heart with just this very act alone of him going to that Brook and choosing those stones he was preparing himself for battle and he didn't even realize what he was up against he didn't even know what he was going to be faced with he didn't even know what he would hear that would cause him to be truly uned or inspired by God himself but the choosing of the stones and so I saying in my prayer we know that God is light and God is life and and we know how the prophet displays it that that that God in his mind he had all of these thoughts and these attributes and he wanted he was just God he he existed by himself he was just God with his thoughts and he began to express those thoughts and and and the way the prophet places it you all forgive me I I I'm going to shut up right here oh my if if you are the folk that have to have every word d d y'all again y'all got the oh God play it on brother Wade he was the one to call me sure fa but the tremendous effect of the word of God as it went forth as he spoke those things the prophet began to say it was like a a a clinker he spoke it and and and and and those words begin to be projected out and it it faed for maybe millions of years and then he stopped it it was a star it was the Earth all of these things beginning to come forth but but as he projected those words there had to be something to receive those thoughts those words there had to be something that that would be a recing post for what God was giving out and there there has to be tonight in this service there has to be somebody someone to receive this word because God doesn't do anything without purpose God has never been without a witness since the beginning of time there has always been someone who could testify to the realities and to the the the fullness of who God was to give an effect to to to respond to what God was doing so a receiving post there's something that that that's going out that's being projected and just because it's not happening within you right now just because it may not be happening at your church does not mean that God is not moving because this is a body move it's not a one man move it's not a one Church move it's a body move as I've often said so many times you get up in the middle of the night and and you stuff that little bitty pinky toe on the bed post woo the little toe I don't know how that thing hurts is that right and what do you do that one m remember you take these five or these 10 things and you go and you minister to that need now God said to tell you that to say this if you know somebody's in trouble don't just dismiss them because of who they are and who what they've done to you or what they said to you you go minister to a need this is a body move I'm meddling I shut up the receiving post the prophet says and if you can be the rece receiving post to receive the word of God then it's real to you listen to how he says this then it's real to you and it'll live like it was then that's right people say well I want to do something for the Lord be a receiving post and the moment that you receive something from him receive the word of God then it's becomes real to you huh the voice of God is a sending post so there has to be a rece post and the voice begins to pulse out and conduit or carrier of the juice as the old folks is as I said I'm just an old country boy we called it juice when I was growing up powder you flip that switch or no forgive me we didn't flip a switch we pulled that chain in the center of the we didn't have switches just pull old chain in the middle of of the ceil a light bulb screwed in to a socket but there was juice there was [Music] power and so here we have in in in the natural realm of that that that very thought the power the juice there had to be a carrier of that current that circuit there had to be something to carry that and and from the line to the transformer into the house and and and all that these reducers and all of these things so all that is the juice or the power once you become that receiving post everything that the juice is everything that the power that the juice embodied is now in you and it'll make you walk right it'll make you talk right it'll make you treat everybody right love we have to love Saints that's that's the embodiment of who Jesus Christ that's what he came to do is to show us how to love and if we can't love right then we missed the whole thing that's right don't care how much you rally around God sent a prophet if you're you're not loving right everybody everybody don't care what they look like what they smell like what they've done what they are doing what they're going to do we have to love not love what they're doing but we have to love but this juice this power sometimes there's an interruption in the connection and what happens there's no more power everything goes quiet you got to flip that switch and nothing happens you sit down to read the word of God and nothing is ignited nothing happens because somewhere the conduit has been cloged somehow some way you've lost power but the reality with that thing is the power has to be restored in order for you to be sustained in your life in your journey you can't go through this Walk of Life without the power the juice of God you can't do it sir especially with the forces and and and everything that that's encroaching in upon the land today yes sir what was once a boys now want to be a girl what was once a girls wantan to become a boy Persian it's encroaching in it's it's it's tight you've got to have power to escape these things yes the choosing of the stones we we're we're here with just a bu Foundation but there has to be a restoration of power and until that power is restored till that force of Life comes back into the house so to speak into the body is is is the the the the house as far as it being a house is no longer effective it can't function in the fullness of it being a house you can't function fully as a child of God if the source of if the power is not fully coming [Music] in yet the pulsation get this yeah the pulsation this is simple I know but I'm a simple person y'all excuse me because you know my I say this constantly my simple understanding is going to Simply get me out of here one day I have no desire to try to complicate this thing in fact I don't know how to do it anyway only thing I know is to tell how I know it tell it how I know it but even though there's an interruption in the the source of power the pulsation is still there the fullness of its potential has not diminished in force the fullness of its potential has not diminished in power or ability God is going to be God with you or without you on you may think that you're all that and that God really needs you to get his work done no he don't really need you it's good if you come along because the power of that juice the the power of the the force the fullness of that power is still pulsating and it's trying to get it's it's still being carried through the line it's trying and it's right there it's right there at at the socket it it's it's right there all we have to do is plug in get connected you think you can stay away from church no that's not going to work no you've got to be connected to the source of power amen h right and often times all it takes is inspiration to get that that power back on inspiration on the spiritual side of things we find out in Matthew 26 Mark 14 and Luke 7 we're introduced to a woman who didn't realize she was re she that she herself was a receiving post for the power of the most high God she didn't know it Mary the prostitute she didn't realize who she was because the circumstances of her life and the things that she had done brought upon her a reputation that was vile and looked down upon a upon by those around her because of the circumstances things that she herself had done regardless if it was something that happened in her life that caused her to be be that way or things that that that took place in her life is is irregardless in respect to what I'm trying to bring tonight but the fact is where she was was was not giving her the the ability to know that she could be plugged into that Source right and as the accusers begin to throw their tongues around at her and all of these things were going on and we know that it was there The Feast at Simon's house you're familiar with the story and I know you're well versed in these things so I'm going to I'm going to skip on a lot of the details you all just fill it in later Bless but even in the midst of where she was in her condition of her life and all of these these these men railing accusations that are wondering why she was here Jesus said to her or the accusers he said let her alone let her alone sometimes we listen sometimes we go to meddling where we don't need to be medling Jesus is saying let her alone because you see Saints self-righteousness will always always cause you to overlook others and exclude them from the economy of God a self-righteous spirit will exclude and keep me oh it's just going to be me this the old song This old com comical song ain't nobody sa but me ain't nobody Sav but me ain't nobody say well maybe two or three ain't nobody say but me self-righteousness will cause you to exclude others and it's always self rightous is always ready to send others to hell and not realizing the state that they're in is going to take them there too is that right it's tight Saints remember the prophet talked about that woman she was walking that line in those High heill shoes and it got a little more narrow the further the closer she got she began to wobble and teet her that's right take off your spiritual high heeled shoes I pray to God you don't have any real ones on it's brother Wade's fault so here she was she was trapped in a condition and nobody would help her think about that trapped in a condition and no one was there to help her she might herself even believe that there was no hope for her because she's gone so long in this lifestyle hear me Saints trapped in that condition she gone so long in that that she began to believe it possibly even herself and after all she was the one that committed these acts it was her it was nobody else that did she was guilty of the act itself and the things that she did yes huh now you cute folk can think that I don't I believe that that you've never done anything wrong if you want to we forget where we come from sometimes Saints I know we're Justified just as I never did I know all those quotes but self-righteousness will keep you out of the Kingdom praise God for our position in Christ and where we are but there's more to this thing than you I got to find a hiding place but the thing is she happened to come upon a scene one day and the outcome would bring power back to her house she came Upon A S Jesus with dirty feet we're familiar with the with the with the the message that the prophet spoke and and I'm always amazed with listening to that how it would just breaking he just begin to weep and cry and he couldn't you know the meatest man I know and all of these messages just break him he couldn't even preach but here Jesus was with dirty feet how could we come to a service and not welcome him in huh young people you've got a role to play you have something to do you can wash his feet too amen you can do these things brother Brenham says of Mary here he says that she only had to be inspired to go into into action she only had to be inspired she wasn't even supposed to be where she was she was already doing something probably illegal or that that that she wasn't even in the proper place but inspiration struck her heart she she peeped through and she saw him there she said how in the world could could this I I've heard about him and now I see him with my own eyes how could it be that he's sitting there with dirty feet how could the people come to the house of God brother Andre how could they be hearing the word of God and just sit there and not be inspired not be I don't understand it I know the prop talks about my people the black people being inspiration will cause these old white feet to move sometimes too tell me I'm wrong huh cuz he says anything without emotion is what dead what do you do with dead things you Buri them huh okay all right that's okay don't be scared don't be afraid but inspiration she only had to be inspired to go into action she went forward without anything listen to how the Prophet wordss this she went forward without anything showing she could do it amen that's right there was nothing that she can lay her hands on there was no scripture there was no quote of the Prophet that she could lay her hands on and say definitively I can do this thing no she was inspired to do what she did and he goes on to say and she went forth on her [Music] inspiration we are well familiar with the story of joob gathering of the stones talking about inspiration being that con being that that that receiving post here we have another individual who who who was uned by inspiration but the thing was even with job he too lost power to his house is that right right everything that he knew everything that he had he lost it was gone even his wife was talking crazy his little sweetheart his queen huh so somewhere along the way he lost power but unlike Mary that we would just talking about Job the prophet talks about job had the mechanics in order he had everything he he he he he knew all the rituals he he had it all in order the mechanics were right there he was just lacking the Dynamics the prophet said now message folk don't like to hear those things well I ain't losing my Dynamics let a storm come ruing in your house you know the thing about homosexuality why am I going here Lord the thing about this that very thing is it's it's it's railed against until it happens in your house till comes knocking on your door to your little baby your grand oh your grandchild oh have mercy is that right but joob he was just lacking the Dynamics and it's interesting I think the prophet says job needed a Channel of inspiration he had it open right Mary didn't even have a channel she didn't even know that she could be a receiver of power and here you have an individual that had a channel and he had he even had his channel open because the prophet says he had a channel to communicate with God by his inspiration job was a prophet Prophet I ain't going there I'm going shut up on that I'll get in trouble but he had a channel to communicate with God by his inspiration he had listen way the prophet I love this he had a way of moving himself out and let the word of God move in oh my job had a way of moving himself out of the way and giving God the opportunity to move [Music] in I shall not be I shall not be moved that's what some people do they sing that song and they moved one been in 50 years shame on you we're going to a land of Eternal Bliss we're going to a land of Eternal youth he said when my back hurts I don't care praise the Lord anyhow my big to S I just had praise the God praise the Lord [Applause] anyhow sometimes we got to praise our way through our [Music] [Applause] circumstances job couldn't get a word from God but the prophet says I love this job couldn't get a word from God but the devil couldn't move [Music] [Applause] him haven't heard God speak and deal with me haven't felt the move of God in years but the devil could not move you young people let that be your foundation tonight you settled it with your walk with the lord the devil is not going to move me even though he slay me I'm still going to trust him cuz the prophet said J had a grip on God could you could you imagine that this Prophet this man of God he had such a grip on God why because it was a revelation once you get a revelation there's nobody anywhere that can take that thing away from you it don't matter if Mama understands it Daddy understands it Grandmama who you love with all your heart understands it it's a revelation that's just for [Music] you I was preaching just a a few weeks back and as I was ministering this little thought just dropped so real into my heart I was just speaking about how Mary when the angel of the Lord came to her and spoke those words and she said be it unto me let it I I will I I'll receive it I'll do this very thing that you that you're wanting me to do yes did she understand it no could she fully comprehend it no she said I will and the moment she did that that eternal life that she was to protect and shield think about it a little teenage girl here we are in a youth meeting a little teenage girl received a word from God and said I will protect this word with all that's within me when that word was birthed forth it changed the world forever and the way the thought came to me then was is this that as the word is going forth even tonight as the word is going forth if you will receive the word of God and allow that word to be birthed in you and you protect and shield the prophet says you protect this message the way that it's going if you were receive it and protect it eventually you will give birth to the very word and that word that you protected that God instilled within you that that he trusted you with it will change your world somebody that you would have an influence in somebody at school you say well I'm homeschooled maybe it'll change your daddy kids pray for your mom and dad pray for your dad m Glory 1st Samuel 17:1 says now the Philistines gathered together their armies to battle and we're gathered together at shoka which belongeth to Judah and pitched between shoka and azika in epes that word shoka means bushing but the thing that captivated me with this verse in particular is this the Philistines had gathered together the enemy had gathered themselves together on land as the Bible says that belonged to Judah what's Judah mean praise the devil done camp out on their praise This Is My Land This is my territory this is my opportunity this is the place where I praise the Lord this is my home this is my daughter this is my son you don't have to back up from the devil because the enemy the Philistines have have come together on the the the land of Judah he's coming to encroach himself upon your land of Praise no doubt they had started out the the the the the Philistines they had sted out the land beforehand and and and and thought this will be a pretty good place to set up C good you don't think the devil is not plotting on you right sis he's seen how you've been reading your Bible he's seen the sincerity of your heart and he's staking you out he's watching you cuz he's going to try to come in and take your praise he's going to try to come in and take your experience but don't let it [Music] am the prophet talked about how the the the uh the serpent how he courted Eve he took his time he staked out that land huh and coming on down through chapter one we'll read it later but again you familiar with the story we learn of and are made very familiar with Goliath we learn about his stature how big he was and we learn about his position his Rank and he was this champion champion we learn about his boost we learn about his armorment how he was dressed and how he was arrayed and all of these things and we also see how his words cover the valley with depression and anxiety hear me now depression and anxiety is such a strong Spirit that's attaching itself to the youth today listen it's time you be set free if you're battling with that thing depression anxiety suicide now the the thing is many times we talk about certain things and and these are real things that are happening in the land today but as parents sometimes we don't want to talk about cuz it's uncomfortable you might being setting your child up for Destruction you have those hard convers listen Mom listen dad you have those hard tough conversations with your child even if you had it last week have it again if you see the needs there that's well you take it whatever you want you [Music] [Applause] know but his word covered the valley with depression and anxiety he made his boast verse 11 when Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistines Watch what it did they were dismayed and greatly afraid because of the words of the devil made them afraid greatly afraid not just fearful but greatly afraid that word dismayed means to be shattered be dismayed be broken be abolished be afraid be scared to be Terri Teri how many's been afraid [Music] before praise God we got some saints Among Us that never been afraid of anything I want to rub shoulders with you tonight get a little bit on me but we're trapped in this thing called time and these sometimes circumstances and things happen that we be shaking in our boots but even yet in that time that present time that the circumstances as they railing around us and the winds blowing we can stand steady in our faith we can stand steady in knowing that our God is more than able because Goliath's message it birth depression and anxiety these people running around saying well I've got like they leaving the messeng say well I'm free not knowing that they're trapped they're on their way to Hell H the devil's pulled one over on them yeah you stay in this word young people you stay in this word young man stay in it you say brother Joel I don't understand it you don't have to understand it be inspired by it said God I I I I I've read and I go to church and I hear the word I don't understand it but I believe it help bow my unbelief huh give me a grip like job had that nothing can shake me even death itself cannot shake me so he said they weren't just afraid but they were exceedingly afraid and I find that just humanly I understand it I get it but yet at the same time I'm thinking what these are the children of Israel choosing of the stones that word Israel means god prevails yes so every time you see the word Israel and you read it in the Bible God prevails but yet because of the words of the enemy they were shaking in their boots and they didn't know what to do and after all Israel was God's favorite people they were called out they were they were the church natural huh they were the ones who were led by the angel of the Covenant which was Christ we've also been led by Angel we received the sure Word of Promise we received the message that has transformed once again the entire world but yet we find ourselves afraid and fearful sometimes because why the enemy comes in and makes his boast so here we have these things going on Goliath and this battle and as we know the stories that unfolds on the scene comes Little David and this particular scripture this story rather it was before David before he was known as as we know him now of course all these great things he hadn't yet killed Goliath we can go David on the scene but see David was just a teenager somewhere the the historians and things say the the scholars and things say somewhere between the age of 13 and some even say 16 but most have it tagged between 13 and 15 but some put him around 16 so that puts him in your category Little David doing this mighty mighty wonderful thing huh so all of this is going on and and David arrives on the on the scene with food for his brothers Prophet says in the message God's commissioning Moses the prophet old Goliath came out and made a great B that's better that's more realistic is it sir okay but it comes out and he makes this great big boast and he's he's he's he's laughing and he said it one too many times he said it one too many times devil it's time for you to shut up under inspiration not even knowing what he was getting ready to do huh there happened to be a little fellow over there just about so high you know with a little sheep skinn coat wrapped around him and he said who's that guy you know probably you know he was coming to bring his brother's food and I can just imagine maybe you know he's making this little stroll he don't know what's happened so far and he's just being David just being a kid you know W who's who's that guy and he looks over here and sees his brothers and sisters that all of the the the host of the army rather and they're just trembling and shaping why isn't David fearful he hadn't yet got the report but even once he gets the report what does he do he stands firm in his faith cuz he knew if God can do it once he can do it [Applause] again but he says who's this fell why they said that's Goliath he he's just got everything stumped around here and David says why do you mean to tell me that you will let that uncircumcised Philistines stand there and defy the armies of the Living God now Mom and Dad you mean to tell me you going to let that little child of yours rule the roost that's the spirit on that child is that right that's the spirit on them and you have the authority dad take your position in the home you have the authority dad's not there Mom you have the authority to bring that Spirit under control thank you Lord is it going to be easy probably not but you're called to do it God entrusted that little character into your care you remember that little baby that you just love so much got done grow up you should have taught it something when it was three and four and five on I know brother Donnie has mentioned so many times he says you you won't raise your kids and then when they get 14 15 16 and they're they're just wavered and they're just crazy then you bring them to me and expect me to wave some magic wand bring him to brother Andre bring to brother W brother Dale bring them to the minist expect them to do something great and tremendous it should have started when they were just we little bitty things listen well I don't want you to come back that's okay you going to hear the truth [Applause] tonight that wasn't David he says no sir Hallelujah there was a lot of fight in that boy n yes sir he know what God had promised and you need to tell me that you'll let these uncircumcised Philistines tell you that the days of Miracles which pass when Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's Hebrews 13:8 he either is or he isn't he either meant it or he didn't now the thing is you either Believe it or you don't that's the summation of my walk with the Lord God either meant what he said or he didn't and I either Believe it or I [Music] don't don't care about all this other stuff get trapped up and have that cow eating grass in the top of a tree how' the cow get up there you put him there could you imagine what it would take to get a cow up in a tree the work and effort that it would take you to get a cow in a tree when all that you have to do is believe the Lord how simple is that and he said oh if some of you guys come out here and fight me this is what goli say I will make you a proposition now when the devil thinks he has the upper hand he's going to make a lot of proposals but the moment that he realized that there's power that there's deity in you young sisters young Brothers Listen the moment the devil realizes there's deity in you you are tabernacling the most high God deity is in you and the moment he realizes that he's going to back up the prophet Illustrated it wonderfully he said we and I love that of all the quotes in the message the one that I love the most is just a three little word with the comma and the word devil and that's boo think about it he said the Devil comes in making his vast and he's saying boo boo we get little and little and little all we have to do is rise up within the strength that's within us and say Boo [Music] back that's simple you say well I got to fold my hands a certain way and I got to scroll through the messenger and find this perfect quote no he simply said boo devil I bet the Methodist Church has never heard that come sh let it echo through these walls and across the way all the way through irn let it Echo out boo devil because he's coming in with such a force he's Mighty in the land he's a self-proclaimed champion of them all but there has to come some little Davids the choosing of the stones and I can imagine as David he heard that boast and he heard the what the enemy was trying to bring I'm sure he didn't just run down to the Bri Brook and just the the the area there and just snatch up some rocks he was deliberate and intentional with what he chose because why he was [Music] inspiring because anything just won't do the prophet tells us don't you let anybody just cram any kind of Revelation down your throat don't just pick up any Stones be intentional be deliberate by what you pick up because God's going to use it to do something tremendous the choosing of the souls God had a little boy back there with a shepherd's coat on who knew God and knew God kept his word how many knows God keeps his word he promised us that he would do these things right there happened to be somebody there that believed God David had that grip I believe David had a grip on God just just uh uh as as as as job had why old goath was covered over with all up and down like that just one little spot and here he comes across to meet him a little bitty fellow about like this and Goliath about like that standing there with his Spirit ready to pick him up and hang him up on a tree somewhere here come little David just a bouncing in the spirit Pentecost D bouncing in the spirit he wasn't doing this he didn't come to church like this come on you happy to be here tonight how many love the Lord no David come bouncing across the territory he come to church excited he come to church already stirred up my yes sir well said brother Joel you want us to be like you know I want you to get a hold of something that will inspire you he had five smooth stones in a sling and five fingers wrapped around the sling the prophet tells us j s u s f a i t h that's what he had he got the things to working out and around and around and around he began to take that little sling he began to go around and around he got it worked out just right he did what he had to do and witness the the prophet says and when you get Faith in Jesus Christ working in a perpetual motion in your soul not lip [Music] service huh but something working and stirring up in your soul a Perpetual that's a big word for a Kentucky hbil perpetual motion in your soul something's going to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scatter young people this isn't food just for Mom and Dad this food is for you as well here David was this a little bitty guy he was a teenager hear me he was a teenager doing these Mighty things he got a perpetual motion in I love that Perpetual emotion in his soul and something's going to take place yes you're discouraged you're depressed you're you're you're you're you're under anxiety you're you're suicidal get some Perpetual emotions maybe something tonight in this message will just stir you up and say I'm going to rise to my feet and I'm going to be that Overcomer the Holy Ghost shot that rock that stone the Holy Ghost took that Revelation right up to that Philistine and killed him he goes on to say when you get Faith in Jesus Christ working in perpetual motion watch this something's going to take place sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scatter like Roaches on a floor in the summertime when the lights turned on roaches brother I don't got roaches the prophet said you do roaches people don't like I'm too clean for roaches brother Joel I'm not talking about the natural roaches he's talking about these spiritual Little Things they are there all you have to do is turn on the light living in darkness you will never see the roaches come out of the condition that you're in come away from sin come away from depression come away from anxiety and flip on the r of the word in your life and allow the roaches to scatter and here's the thing as they're scattering what do you do you go find them you going chase after so un roaches find Roes is well these are my new shoes stomp those roaches I'll buy I'll buy you some new ones stop those roaches that's what the prophet said I'm going to read that again cuz you didn't like it sin and sickness will get away from you Devils will scatter like Roaches on a floor in the summertime when the lights turn on the reason why you don't think you have roaches because you are you're not leaving the light on long enough you done let the power go out in your house and there's no source for the lights to come on and roaches are all around you and they're eating your food the food that you pick up and eat [Applause] too hello cute folk who is this for blame it on brother way brother Andre roaches roaches roaches brother Joy making me feel I hope I do get it out of your [Music] life turn on the light get plugged in you go through that switch and nothing happen you're not plugged in the conduit plugged up somewhere the smoke sack is plugged up somewhere let's let's get it cleaned up I forgot what time I started praise the Lord Brother I'm telling you sitting The Rock to The Killing place I love that and down went Goliath that perpetual motion that around that around and around and around it sent the rock right to the killing Place David didn't construct this thing David didn't figure this thing out David didn't have the intellect David didn't have the ability but he had a God that was on the inside of him that inspired him to do something that nobody else was willing to do [Applause] maybe Mom and Dad won't do it young people you rise up and you do it you call a family time of prayer and I know things are crazy a time has been then time is encroaching we just a't so busy but you call Mom and Dad let's have devotion tonight you watch the atmosphere change it'll drop conviction in your daddy's heart I get I promise you I promise you want to see a change in daddy you want to see a change in mom you call the family alar well I'm a sister you call the Family altar you see the path that Mom and Daddy are on you see the destruction that they're headed toward you love them dearly you call Little David little Mary you call you say be it unto me Lord I'll do it under your inspiration not even having the the the to know how to do it you do it and I promise you God will be there to meet you at your at your say be it unto me I promise you therefore David ran and stood upon the Philistine and took his own sword and Drew it out of the sheet thereof and slew him and cut off his head therewith so the thing with this the choosing of the stones and I know I I said a lot but my thought this inspiration came with just the deliberateness that David took you can't just run through life you can't just have an experience you can't just come to church and and you know that there's there there's more to this message than just this message there's more to God sending a prophet than God sending a prophet there's a life that comes behind it many people that will come up to Calvary and they'll camp out at the base of Calvary and that's a good place to be don't don't don't misunderstand what I'm saying but they'll just come to Calvary and they'll go no further but there's a life on the other side of Calvary there's something yet to do once you come and met this resurrected savior there's more to do first Sam 1751 therefore David ran and stood upon the philistin and took his sword and Drew it out I just read that but the thing is with this one of the points I want to bring is that once you kill once you destroy the bigger Thing Once you destroy destroy Goliath what happens in verse 51 and when the Philistines saw their Champion was dead what did they do they fled they didn't just walk away non shal they didn't go quietly they fled so these little things that are bothering you find out what that big thing is and you kill it you destroy it don't toy around with it don't play around with it you destroy it if you have to unplug your phone if you have to get rid of your laptop your computer you do that if that thing is destroyed leading you to destruction you get rid of [Music] it my Tik Tok keeping you up late at night get up and you irritable in the morning you fuss it with your brothers and your sisters and your mom and your daddy shut it down huh what is it doing it's zapping your life is zapping your energy I least thought that say Amen y'all come with me we don't thing together but you destroy the bigger things and the others of the encampment will flee that word Philistine means an immigrant they don't belong here they didn't belong in the land in verse one which belonged to Judah but they had encamped on that land in an immigrant huh sir the illegals had gathered together on land that wasn't even theirs all in order to wage a war the devil's coming in your house and saying he's going to start a fight no it don't work that way devil Mom Dad listen to me it don't work that way the devil's going to come in your house uh-uh it don't work that way it's all right so the illegals had gathered together this was judah's territory this was a land of praise and worship because David was just a little teenager now giant Slayers don't have to be old so many times we get in our mind and as as young people I did it too and we think well I I got to wait till I turn whatever age that magical age 21 whatever you know we think well I got to be old and and before God can use me no we've heard clearly we we've seen in the scriptures God will use teenagers God will use and has used and will continue to use young people even to the dismay of the older ones that are doing nothing for [Music] him David was a teenager but he took his time when he chose those rocks he had to make sure that he chose the right ones he didn't even know listen to this this he did not even know he was going to kill Goliath he had no idea he just come out now got to bring his brothers some some lunch that's all he came to do you just show up at school one day with your backpack on your back not knowing that you're getting ready to kill a Goliath that thing is com at you at your locker day after day after day and you get more depressed and more depressed and you're more suicidal and more wow more suicidal but today will be the day that you kill that Goliath gain strength gain some inspiration M the people in the Halls they're at school they're not under the same inspiration as you are they're giving vent to vaping and smoking and having uh sex and all of these things y'all know what's going on help me out old people huh we fit back and we're quiet about these things and our children and our children's friends are dying inside well that's not I don't want to say I don't want to offend but you going going to lose your child this stuff is real huh I done told you I know I'm supposed to be here and I know God's going to change somebody's life I know this word was supposed to be spoken it's broken up and it may not make sense to you but it's making sense to somebody yes sir Shemar we're closing Shemar his defeat listen his defeat was aect in his entire family year after year it affect they they took their crops so they were dwindling away in their health it was affecting his family because he was being defeated by something over and over a besetting sin that in your life it's affecting your family yes God Speak Lord yes cuz David's action caus a reaction amen and when David did what he did it brought courage to the Israelites a rock a stone is a revelation and the power of God had been revealed to David and he took that Revelation and he put it into motion round and a perpetual motion he didn't just stick it in his pocket and hide it he didn't put it under a bushel oh no I'm going to let it shine David said huh this little light that I have I'm going to let it shine I'm going to put it into action these books and these tapes this message of the hours not to be kept on a shelf somewhere that's some little Relic as some little thing that we fashion this is my message books on my bookshelf have you read one in the past 10 years huh I leave that up to the preacher he'll come and tell me what uh-uh no what happens if the preacher leaves what happens if the preacher fails what happens if the preacher walks away from the message

but I had it on my shelf my bookshelf I just when I was single so it wasn't my kids it wasn't my wife and and there was a brother that that was was coming into the message and he was living with me

said whatever you need what a food I came home from work one day and brother had opened my red H my little trinket give me some more but we set these things up don't let this message sit on the shelf and die there's life in this message amen David he took God at his word and even among all the clamor of doubt and unbelief David still knew David had a revelation all the noise that's going on in the world today it does not matter if you have a revelation of who you are if you have a ration of what God is and what he wants to do this is more than meat it's more than our natural meat and here we are in a similar scene tonight it's being played out once again thousands of years later we have a brook a stream the washing of the Water by the word the brook the stream is Flowing is that right here we are once again and a giant is coming into our land and he's making a boast and he's telling you young people you can't live this thing you cannot do this that's what he's boasting that's what
