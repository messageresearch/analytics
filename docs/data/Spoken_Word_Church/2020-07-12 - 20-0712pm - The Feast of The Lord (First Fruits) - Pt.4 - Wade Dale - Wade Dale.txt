in the house of the Lord good to be here on Sunday afternoon and we we know that that God's with us he's right here he never leave us or forsake us he promised that amen just talked to brother Andrew Glover he said to tell you she never wanted any hello he's in the Virginia's today so we had a wonderful time last Sunday was with brother Andrew being here so just keep him in your prayers also good and have brother Paul Thompson with us from meanness to older did I do that good Minnesota Minnesota huh you betcha okay anyway we'll get over all that he talks like him and rush talked the same so if you heard rush you hear him too so anyway so he goes to he's brother Don Hoffman we had a real good time up there with him when we were there a couple of years ago in January and about six inches of snow on the ground 20 degrees so that was perfect weather perfect for Minnesota but it's good to have him with us today also I talked to brother Tom Anastasia the brother and sister that started coming to church here his brother has cancer in his blood his name is Joe so he said remember him he's having to either I didn't understand the whole text but he's having to take care of I think and take care of some of the family business so that's why they've not been here and they will return just as soon as they get back from wherever his brothers at so just keep them in your prayers also as far as what we were talking about doing again Wednesday if it's all right Wednesday let's do our put our tape back up and do half since we're not doing anything for Wednesday let's do that and then Sunday start back to where I'll send you a list of who needs to come upstairs and the Sunday service and the rest downstairs now that's been brought to my attention and I agree 100% sisters with children should not have to sit in the car during the service you need to man gentlemen whoever needs to make provisions and make sure that you're your wife and your children come inside the building because it is hot outside but we'll still be doing the 107 point one of em station if you want to listen in your car or at home or you can bring your laptop or computer and stay in the middle room like boys Sunday school class but in my Sunday school class and the big room downstairs there's a monitor there for you to watch so we just want to be cautious again and and not give place to the devil so god bless you let's go to Leviticus today it's going to be part 4 it will be we will be speaking today on the first fruits the first fruits I want you to realize this though if you if you ever do go through and study and look at this there is this is the first the first fruit there is another first fruit it's on the day of Pentecost it's called the feast of firstfruits but it's also called the feast of weeks are the Feast of Pentecost but we'll get into that next Wednesday actually we'll get into that but let's this is the first of the harvest this is the first of the fruits that's being harvested called the firstfruits and we'll see how it applies to me and you and how it applied during Jesus's time and how it exactly fell on the first day of the week the day of the resurrection we actually every Sunday we celebrate the feast of firstfruits because it happened the first day of the week after the Sabbath and what is the first day of the week after the Sabbath it would be Sunday so god bless you let's go to Leviticus 23 let's bow our heads before we get started today only father thank you for this day that you give us Lord this brother John said before any day that we got up and and was breathing and was able to come to church and worship You Lord it's a good day father would pray that you'd be with us Lord as a church here father that you'll take care of us and protect us be with the ones that are sick be the ones that are on the highways Lord be with the missionaries on the foreign fields give them fruit for their labor Lord and all the little bride around the world Lord it will bind ourselves together on to you Lord and not bind ourselves together under a cloud of fear but Lord under a lord a light that shines in a dark place that you've given us Lord a place called Goshen to go to Lord that we can stay there Lord and be protected father we pray that you'd be with Lord the ministers around the world Lourdes we see the day approaching that Lord we need good ministers more and more to be able to preach the word Lord to the people that we're getting ready to get out of here we're getting ready to take truely take a harvest and be taken out of this world Lord and you're gonna separate the wheat and the tares and bind us and take us home father we long for that day Lord but we've got to go through this journey first we pray that you'd help us through it Lord be with us be with the service Lord you'd be the active participant Lord and be the one that gives us revelation in Jesus name we pray amen as brother Dale was talking this morning you know foreknowledge is what God saw predestination is the predetermined journey that he saw the journey is what sent right now on the journeys what's in between this is your journey this is your overcoming this is your blessing party this is your part to do hey man this is your part to do God knows who's gonna make it who's not you just don't yet but if you'll do I was telling brother Bob a few minutes ago I've been reading in chronicles and you reading chronicles that that goddess that God will tell this king he said I'll bless you as long as you do this this and this and he would bless like even Hezekiah he blessed blessed blessed blessed but all of a sudden one day they decided to go after another God you know what the first thing God did he sent some Amalekites he sent some Gebbie sites and he sent some websites and he sent some Palestinians and and he would send two men to remind him to remind him who they were then they will get on her knees and say God forgive us and then he would turn around and give them the Bible and drive him right back out so that you know what that's a that's a type of me and you that's our struggles every day we we get these little ice in us and then we we have to get God to come and say you're not part of that come back and do what I'm do what I'm asking you to do and everything will be fine so we thank God the hand of the Lord is upon us in our journey so here's the Feast of the Lord firstfruits part 4 Leviticus 23 it's kind of a long read but we're going to read it anyway it's the word of the Lord hey if people can stand for six hours and listen to the Word of God being spoken in Ezra's time then why can't we stand for four five minutes for this so and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speaking to the children of Israel and saying to them concerning the Feast of the Lord which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations even these are my feasts so they're not Israel's feasts they're God's feast six days shall work be done but on the seventh day is the Sabbath of rest on holy convocation you shall do no work therein and this the Sabbath of the Lord and all your dwellings now that has nothing to do physically with the seventh feast days he has given an ordinance - they gonna work six days and take one day off which is the Sabbath which would be Saturday all right everybody got that saying man all right these are the Feast of the Lord even holy convocations which you shall proclaim in their seasons now he's fixing to tell them what the Feast are in the fourteenth day of the first month what is the first month Apryl Arneson are march/april ok Nissen are a bit in the fourteenth day of the first month and even is the Lord's Passover and on the fifteenth day of the same month is the feast of unleavened bread we've done been through those two we'll go over them just for a second to stir up your mind seven days you must eat unleavened bread and the first day you shall have a holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein so the first day the holy convocation but you shall offer an offering made by fire into the Lord seven days in the seventh day as another holy convocation you shall do no servile work therein in other words no service work all right because you can cook and do other things but you can't work physically labor for money and the Lord spake unto Moses saying now here's one we're getting to know speaking of the children of Israel and say unto them when ye be coming to the land which I give unto you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheath now so remember they didn't do this during the journey they only did this when they went into got into the Promised Land that's when they held this feast he just said that speaking of the children when ye be coming to the land which I give unto thee now the wilderness wasn't a land that God give them that was a wilderness of sin all right so when they come into the land brother Dale talks about many times the old corner of the land they they didn't they didn't plant this they just harvested and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits in other words the first part of the harvest unto the priest and he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath so now this has a specific date it is done on the day after the Sabbath so that would be Monday the first day of the week kind of strange Jesus rose when everyone and you shall offer that day when you we wave the sheaf and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering unto the Lord the meat offering there shall be two tents deal there's going to be three different offerings a lamb two tense deal the fine flower an offering made by fire for a sweet savor and a drink offering so there's three different offerings in this and a drink offering thereof shall be of wine the fourth part of it him and you shall eat now this is important and you shall eat neither bread nor parts corn not green ears until the self-same day that you have brought an offering into unto your God it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings in other words you can't eat it until the priest way--but a man so the priest had to take it and wave it and then you could eat let's be seated and let's eat for a little while so the first feast we we're going to go over this real quick let's pass over now we know what Passover was so let's go to Exodus 12 and look real quick the Lord spake unto Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt this month shall being you the beginning of month so God told them what was the first day of their year this wasn't man thinking it up God told them this month shall be unto you the beginning of months it shall be the first month of the year to you speaking to the congregation of Israel saying in the tenth day of this month you shall take a mat every man a lamb according to the house of their father a lamb for a house so on the tenth day of the month you took a lamb you had to put it up for the four days and then you made the sacrifice if the household be too little for the lamb let him and his neighbor next to his house take it according to the number of the souls every man according to the eating shall make your count for the lamb your lamb shall be without blemish you had four days to check it out justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost in the word you had four days to check this lamb out it can't be blink can't be wrong can't have a blemish a male of the first year there's your first fruits coz we're going to get into this there was an offering that everybody had to make ever certain a certain period of time you even brought you your first son and offered them to the priests now not as an offering but you did bring them before the priest and the priest was sanctified firstfruits and firstborn always meant something to God why because he sent His only Son the first begotten of the Father your lamb shall be without blemish a male of the first year you shall take it out from the Sheep or from the goat and you shall keep it up until the fourteenth day of the same month and the whole Assembly of the congregation of Israel shall kill it in the evening time all right there buddy got that say a man and they shall take up the blood and strike it on the side of the door so you had the doorpost all right sign of the Cross and the upper doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it every house had to have a lamb every house had to show the blood over the doorpost so we showed that that was a personal relationship with God you have to have your own lamp God had to die for you not for me but no God died for me no you but you had to have a part you had to know that he died for you but most people in the world and I hate to say this but they keep Jesus on the cross and they say oh he died for he died for my sins or he died for the sin of the world no it's personal to me I love that song when he was on the cross you need to sing that for me please do that when because you've sung it before when he was on the cross what I was on his mind if the Bible tells us that we were engraved in the palm of the hand when that nail went through that palm it went right through my name Amen I believe that you believe that if you want to but I believe he died for me you got to make sure that you believe he died for you same way with this lamb this lamb especially the firstborn kids did dad have we've done this thing right you killed it rice you put the blood over the doorpost why because your life depends on it the first guy that was born hit because the first people that were going to die were the first the firstfruits are the first people of the the firstborn was going down that night that's how serious it was they shall take the blood and strike it on this post and the doorpost of the house wherein they shall eat it they shall eat who eat the flesh in that night roast with fire and unleavened bread and with bitter herbs so this is where you begin with unleavened bread and with bitter herbs they shall eat it ain't not a bit wrong or sudden at all with water wife's got a burnt with fire gotta have burnt with fire his head with his legs and with the pertinence thereof and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and we explain that we burned the communion bread every night before the next day because you don't want to hold over type of the manna type of the Word of God we love what brother Andrew said last Sunday but we're not going to go back sure we're going to remember what he said and we're going to roll that around in our head and we're going to let the Holy Ghost take it but we're gonna move on we're not going keep that's why I'm I hate to say this but there's a lot of people living like brother Browne said looking in a rearview mirror God sent a prophet God sent a prophet God sent a prophet we already know that the devil knew it before you did but what are we doing with it we got to move on not going past him no we just got to get fueled up with what he's already saying and you shall let nothing of it remain until the morning and that which remaineth you shall burn with fire and thus shall you eat it with your loins girded your shoes on your feet why told you God it's fixing to put these Israelites in motion all right and your shoes on your feet your staffing your hand and you shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's Passover for I will pass through the land of Egypt this night and I will smite all the firstborn in the land of Egypt both man and beast and against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgment I am the Lord Harrison you'd be in trouble you're the firstborn buddy you better make sure that blood is over the doorpost and the blood shall be for you for a token upon the house you know why because the death angel went by and he would looked at the house and if there was no blood over it he can enter but if there was a blood if there was a blood sacrifice there was something died something died to take his place Jesus Christ died to take our place so that we can't die or we may physically die but you can't die a Christian cannot die we only sleep amen and that's because of the same curse because what we got caught into what like brother Dale said garden you all this I mean this is not a surprise nothing is a surprise to God and all this virus and I that's not surprised you know what he wants to know what you're gonna do about it you can swivel up and die if you want to but I'm still gonna be kicking and going as we keep going kicking and going and the blood shall be for your token upon the houses where you are houses God don't live in brick mortar he lives in houses and the blood shall be for your token upon the houses where you are when I see the Blood I will pass over you and the plague shall not be upon you to destroy you when I smite the land of Egypt and this day shall be unto you for a memorial and you shall keep it as a feast to the Lord throughout your generations you shall keep it as a feast by an ordinance forever amen I love that scripture even more and more so now let's look at the the bullet points that we came up with on that one and we'll just keep on going pull that one up if you don't mind the first month which was a bitter lesson which is March April and if you'll understand what we were talking about a couple of Sundays ago the priest literally he didn't just have a job preaching to the people the priest most time was the doctor and all the other different things and during that time he was a lot more than just a preacher but the priest had to go out on the last day of the year the last day of the month and he had to look up in the sky and he had to see how much of the Moon was left over so that he could say okay let's go to the next month or less add another month or go back and have the same month over again thereby understand it cuz it's a moon cycle it's not it's not we have just a set calendar that's why we have to have a leap year okay we have to have a leap year to keep everything coming back because the feast were starting to be in the summer and in the winter and there's no when they're supposed to be they're supposed to be in the spring and in the fall their buddy got that say ma'am because in the wintertime everything's dead the summertime was everything's hot like right now so on the tenth day of the month they put the lamb up they killed it in the evening each home had to have a lamb you had to eat unleavened bread it had to do with the firstborn they had to be ready to go and the blood had to be over the door but I love these streets I want you to meditate a little bit on these three things here and look how it shows us that could we be in the same spot and need these three things right and then we need these three things we needed a prophet to come in the last day to give us correct instruction amen let's don't have a problem with prophets God sent them all since the beginning of time why did he wait and so he didn't quit sending them in the end time no there's still more prophets to come the two witnesses these two more prophets got to go to Israel in the Bible so we shouldn't stubble at Malachi 4 and he didn't come to bring us another God he didn't come to bring us another Bible he came to bring us instruction of what's already been said amen same way now then God sends them this is what he sent the children of Israel sent him a prophet Moses for instruction sent him an angel to guide them a pillar of fire and a cloud and then gave them right from the get-go that's kind of a southern expression I guess is it that's not wouldn't be in Minnesota okay all right get from the get-go okay so that means from the start he'd give him a lamb he gave him a sacrifice he gave him a sin covering same way with you and I even though as brother Dale's telling us we we definitely walked in a world of sin everybody in the building this is including everyone we walked in the world of sin but God gave us a lamb for protection and then when we accept that blood that's when our sins get washed away and we become the sinless bride of Jesus Christ the Bible says without spot or wrinkle now you say oh now you can't be perfect I don't say I don't say hate I don't like when you talk to people about you know getting bet doing better and and you know doing what the Bible says and the first thing they do is they go you're not perfect no I'm not perfect I said well that's not why my Bible says I don't know why my Bible says I thought my Bible says B therefore perfect even as my father in heaven is perfect and that we are to be without spot or wrinkle white robes so I'm just gonna look what God said I'm not gonna worry about what man said I'm gonna look at what God said amen because you know what inside that house at the Passover night inside that house they might have been some sinners in there but they were still in a part of the family and what did the death angel now that knows like the death angel didn't come up and say I know what you did some will kill you nope that blood was there he couldn't go past it there was a barrier there and there's still a barrier there when Jesus Christ shed his blood at Calvary there is still a barrier there that Satan cannot touch you so I said thank God for these feasts that we can look at this and see that God's already done this took a group of people that kept sinning even down through the wilderness was even scald the wilderness of sin right it was called the wilderness of sin for a purpose because they were kept on sinning but you know what 5-10 times those Israelites end in the in the way and you know what God Act even brother Paul after even they would do some awful stuff the next verse he say when you get in the promised land this is what I want you to do he never even paid attention to that he knew they wasn't but to gonna make it of the original Bunch but he knew there was that young group that was going to come up that was going to listen to what God said that was gonna listen to what the Prophet said and do what the angel told them to do let the angel guide them but we must not walk through this world condemned we must not because if we do then we lose the battle the battle is won by us believing what God's already done for us as brother Dale was preaching chosen not chosen by him the Bible doesn't say chosen by him because Satan was chosen by God to be the anointed cherub Judas was chosen by him by God but they weren't chosen in him go see the lamb the lamb is what the sacrifice that's what that death angel looked at he and look at this situation inside the house he looked at that covering and they were covered he couldn't the angel could not penetrate that blood so he cannot get to you god only allows him in every once in a while just to kind of peek over and give us a little problem to see how we'll handle it but thank God that he sent us a prophet he sent us an angel the baptism of the Holy Ghost to goddess and a sin covering that even as Christians we sin right even the thoughts the very the very reason you're standing here listening to me today and you got to go eat after we get finished and you got to sleep tonight means that you have a sin body that you're living in amen but what about that guy inside that guy inside is not covered by the blood he is the life that was in that blood that was totally weak if if there would have been a touchdown scored right then y'all would have been screaming and hollering and shouting and I told you that you covered the by the blood and you just sit there and go heavy okay yeah but what good is that I had to make you do it Luke 22 verse 1 says now the feast of unleavened bread drew nigh which is called the Passover so we were talking about last Sunday don't be confused there is a day of Passover everybody got that that's on the 14th day of the month but that is also included in unleavened bread because you eat unleavened bread and the Bible even tells us now the feast of unleavened bread room now which is called the Passover so it's included in if you'll bring the chart back up if you don't mind brother Anderson he's doing double duty but I'm glad he's about six eight with about a ten-foot wingspan so he can get over here on this computer he can go over here on this computer in the same room so thank God for brother Anderson being a toll call fella so the fourteenth is to Passover and then the very next day you start unleavened bread but now remember I told you that some some people over there include it and make it an eight-day thief because unleavened bread starts at Passover but Passover separate because you don't kill the lamb on the 15th you kill the lamb on the 14th you don't kill another one on the 15th not for that Passover okay everybody got that all right so it's a seven-day feast of unleavened bread and we were talking about it or matzo we were talking about last time that might some what Shortino minute don't bring it for now but the Feast of Unleavened drew nigh which is called the Passover now what happened is Jesus was killed on Passover right and then the very next day which was Saturday what happened was now remember Friday he was killed on Friday everybody got that same man before 6 o'clock because remember and Jewish time even now the days are not midnight to midnight the days are 6 p.m. until 6 p.m. the next day so in a couple of hours from now Israel would be you would be you would be at 6 o'clock p.m. today if it was the same time you would already be into Monday there buddy got that so that's why that Jesus was crucified on Friday but he had to be taken off the cross before 6 o'clock because it was not only a regular Sabbath the seventh day Sabbath Saturday it was a high Sabbath because she brought in unleavened bread started on that day and you do no servile work on the first day everybody got that and listen he stayed in the grave his body did that whole day on Saturday but now remember he was still working those remember where he went he went to hell to preach to the souls in prison while his body his dead body laid in the grave on that day because he had to didn't have to he couldn't do no servile work hey bad hello this is perfect this thing is so perfect well I mean why would we expect anything different Jesus had to come and fulfill the Old Testament brother branham told us that right so he fulfilled it to the day because remember we're going to talk about in a few minutes we're going to talk about first fruits which happens on the day after the Sabbath but remember remember this and we'll get to it keeping your back you're mine Passover can be on any day that falls on the 14th but firstfruits always happens the day after the Sabbath and it just so happens during that time a t30 that Jesus when he was crucified they all fell coincided within the three days but that happened not coincidence brother and sister and wasn't coincidence at fifty days later on the day of Pentecost that same man came back right here exactly the Bible says when the day of Pentecost was fully come hey men let's read a quote here real quick before we get into unleavened bread brother I'm standing witness 19:56 many was witness of his day and that is cross when he was dying the Pharisees they should have known what the word said the word gave witness when he was killed on he was a Passover lamb killed at the Passover time he gave witness the word spoke of him when He healed the sick when he raised the dead when the lame leap like a heart it was the word can you receive it so he was killed on Passover then the very next day was unleavened bread so let's go to unleavened bread which is the next day Exodus 12 verse 15 God tells Moses seven days shall you eat unleavened bread now what is unleavened bread that is bread that has nothing in it to make it rise right even the first day you shall put away leaven out of your houses on the first day you got to get all the leaven out of your house for those who ever either flemming bread that's another word something added to it just look what's gonna happen this is how serious God was with the people we're talking about just a handful of yeast or a handful of flour and God said if I find that in your house if I find that leaven in your house your soul will be cut off from Israel that's why we must realize that when we receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost that in our soul it cannot sin and will not sin because this god it's the unleavened bread of the word seven days seven Church ages God sent us unleavened bread through paul i rainiest martin Columba luther wesley brother branham seven days shall you eat unleavened bread and now look as we were talking about last Sunday the first day you can put away leaven whosoever eateth leavened bread from the first day into the seventh day that soul shall be cut off from Israel if you don't have the baptism my Holy Ghost in those seven Church ages you're not gonna make it they didn't make it but they had to take the unleavened bread of the word and in the first day there should be a holy convocation and in the seventh day a holy convocation in the first churches in the last churches why did God talk about an alpha bride and Omega bride that in each one now that doesn't do away with everybody else but it makes that this first one got it started and the last one had to turn us back to the first back to the faith of the fathers that was back in the first church age so there was a holy convocation on the first day and on the seventh day first church age in the last church age seven churches there was holy convocation we had to be what the two bookends there shall be a holy convocation to you no matter of work shall be done in them excuse me save that which every man must eat eat eat eat carcass wheat the word but it's not of works lest any man should boast no matter of work shall be done in them say that whichever man must eat that only may be done of you and you shall observe the feast of unleavened bread for in this self same day I brought your armies out of the land of Egypt therefore show you observe this day in your generation by an ordinance for ever in the first month on the fourteenth day of the month that evening you shall eat unleavened bread see just went to the fourteenth day so you see what I'm talking about now until the one in 20th or 21st day of the month that evening seven days shall there be no leaven found in your houses realize that when when even in the first church age when they received the baptism my Holy Ghost leaven was taken out of their house you know why because they're standing in a dimension now in another dimension and they have no leaven the unleavened bread of the word that they received under Paul and I rhiness and Martin and Columba that's what put them in another dimension and that's what put them over there totally sinless white robes waiting to come back here to pick up their leaven because we gotta listen we gotta cover eleven here in just a few minutes well next Wednesday we're gonna cover eleven because when you come back to the Feast of Pentecost you have to take oh and let me give you this little key and my wake okay this harvest of this time that we're fixing to talk about the firstfruits it's not a wheat harvest it's not a fruit harvest it's a barley harvest all right so there's this harvest coming up we're gonna talk about is a barley harvest greeneires the next harvest we're going to talk about is the Feast of Pentecost that's a wheat harvest and then the next harvest we're gonna talk about it's a fruit harvest grapes and all those different things oh yeah so we got three different things that are that pertain to harvest so the first one we're fixing to talk about is a barley harvest it's the first thing to come to maturity is barley in March and April alright wheat does not do that wheat has to wait several of weeks or so after that we'll get into that seven day 7-eleven found in your house whose forever if that which is eleven even that soul shall be cut off from the congregation of Israel whether he be a stranger born in the land you shall eat nothing leaven and all your habitation shall you eat unleavened bread and unleavened bread is what we were talking about its that matzah and it's just a cracker that they roll across it's really flat what we take for communion and it has stripes and holes in it they don't even know what they're eating they're eating a type of Christ that took stripes for them and then we'll head holes put in his hands in his feet they don't even realize that they're sitting there eating matzah and they don't have a clue why well they do think that the holes punched in the matzah is to keep it from bubbling up you know you see if you see a saltine cracker everyone swallow a bubble in it that's what they said they roll this thing across it but if you look at it when I look at it I see Jesus Christ I don't see a cracker I see Jesus Christ because there is the unleavened bread there is the man that had holes punched in him that had stripes on his back for me I see that in the cracker I don't see just a cracker so look there's seven ages the unleavened bread but now also remember we were talking about last Sunday you got to remember that the Passover is a type of what the baptism of the Holy Ghost right when I see the blood okay everybody got that now we know that's gonna happen in Pentecost but you got had you got to start right here to accept that sacrifice so then you've got the very next the very next feast it's seven days born-again it faith faith is not an ADD faith is your Passover and then you got seven ads one two three four five six seven if I got that say man you don't get born again up here you get born again at faith a man so there's the Passover lamb being killed and then you've got seven days to eat what the unleavened bread of the word everybody got that pretty simple we go up the statue of a perfect man I told you that's one of the most ill taught subjects in the message there are seven ads that we are required we are required to have these ads as brother day I was talking about going on to what adoption going on to placing going on to the fullness of the word not just one piece of the cracker hey one piece of the crackers okay but if you're really hungry one piece of the cracker is not gonna do you any good you want the whole thing amen so now let's start with firstfruits pull it back up to firstfruits Leviticus 23 9 don't we'll show you how perfect this is brother Bob and I were talking like this and I asked him I said did you know there was a difference in bar the harvest of wheat harvest he said yeah but we're gonna get into something in just a minute and I had to look it up on the internet it must be true and the Lord spake pause like wait a minute well what am I getting myself into and the Lord spake unto Moses saying speaking of the children of Israel saying to them when you'd be coming to the land which I give unto you all right everybody got that when I shall come and when you shall come into the land which I give you and shall reap the harvest thereof then you shall bring a sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest unto the priest if I got that and he shall wave he shall wave the sheaf before the Lord to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it the morrow after Saturday Jesus had to resurrect on Sunday to fulfill the firstfruits but you're gonna see something just a minute I found on the Internet but you're gonna see the timing of this thing the timing is so perfect to get all three of them in the same slot Passover unleavened bread to hit because you know what Passover can be on any day everybody understand what I'm saying how this is not a coincidence because it's on the 14th day of the first month that may follow Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday but it didn't on that when Jesus was crucified it fell on Friday then the feast of unleavened bread the first day started Saturday and then that was the first Monday first day of the week after the Sabbath that's why they all three fell in the same boom boom boom and that hardly ever happens hardly ever happens but it happened when Jesus was crucified because you've got to be accepted on the morrow after the Sabbath so what are we saying by the way well if the Passover was on Tuesday we've got it if it was on TV now unleavened bread would start the next day not a big deal but your firstfruits couldn't have been the next day cuz it's tomorrow after the Sabbath you gotta wait till the day after Saturday there's a gap in there God don't have gaps he was perfect when he came and died stayed in the grave and came up on the day of firstfruits the day after the Sabbath what a mighty God we serve now watch mm-hmm and you shall offer that day now watch to be accepted for you on the morrow after the Sabbath the priests shall waive it so the priest on Monday morning Monday morning the day after the Sabbath he gets that group of firstfruits and he waves it but what this is what's important and you shall offer that day when you wave the sheaf and he lamb without blemish of the first year for a burnt offering and the meat offering shall be two tents deal of fine flour now this is offering this is not what you eat because you can't eat until the firstfruits has been accepted and you shall eat neither bread nor parts corn there's a green dark green ears until the self-same day that you have brought an offering unto your God it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations and all your dwellings in other words you couldn't just go in there and bring the first fruits to the priest and then go eat you had to wait till he waived it you gotta wait till the preacher preaches it sorry you gotta wait til the preacher preaches it then you can eat then you can eat what you got in your field but you gotta wait for God to do the work first and let that priest waive it before the Lord and be accepted when it is then you can eat proverbs proverbs 3 verse 9 says honor the Lord with thy substance because we're gonna get into something here it's listen tears don't let nobody to door hold it or right there we're gonna talk about tithing well let's see the letter marriage and divorce one of the two so we'll pick tithing cuz it works see I didn't tell you all know that so just now but it gives you time to just continue sleeping or we can talk about it proverbs 3 verse 9 says honor the Lord with thy substance because look let me tell you something God Almighty himself offered his own body say it again brother Amen God himself offered his own body so that you and I can have eternal life he offered himself as the Passover lamb literally the blood was over the doorpost and he took that leaven that he was living in because it was corrupting right he wasn't living in a perfect body and he put it in the ground he put it in the ground but he raised on that one scripture that that bread was not going to corrupt and he rose on the first fruits and he gave everything that was the day remember brother Brown said he proved who he was when he came out of the grave hey man he proved who he was when he said destroy this body and I'll raise it up in three days destroy this temple now raised up in three days if he hadn't come up in that time he'd have been a liar hey man but he did so as he did that we can enjoy everything after that but somebody had to get this thing started and thank God it was God Almighty that started it if God Almighty starts it it cannot go wrong honor the Lord with our substance because we're fixing to get into that that's what I said we're going getting a little bit of tithing here and with the first fruits of all vine increase so shall thy barns be filled look if you give him the increase so shall thy barns be filled with plenty he's only asking for a percentage of your field he's not asking for well I won't have for that no no he just wants enough to where he can wave it before the people so shall thy barns be filled with plenty and thy presses shall burst out oh I think that black kind of burst it out Sunday that new wine got a hold of him yeah I'll clap too I don't know if I to survive that but thank God he's only 20 years old and he can survive that but thank God you know what that new wine took over and it was bursting it was just waiting on a miracle is that all we waiting oh well we had our miracle and that's brother John Durrett said there's a miracle everyday happens in my house with my heat feed hit the floor amen so the feast of firstfruits look the self-same day you brought an offering proverbs says honor the Lord with our substance let's go to Nehemiah near my 10 verse 34 and watch this real quick I want your time real quick Nehemiah and we cast the locks among the priests the Levites and the people and a watch the priests to leave us and the people there buddy got to say man please stay away for a few minutes for the wood offering to bring it into the house of guard God after the houses of our fathers at times appointed year-by-year to burn upon the altar of the Lord our God as it is written in the law now watch and to bring because remember the feast of firstfruits started a feast it started he waved it and then all of a sudden you can eat whatever whatever's out here yeah okay everybody got that but this is talking about giving our first fruit of many things and to bring the first fruits of our ground vegetables okay because we're gonna look God separates tithing there's tithing of your money brother Dale talks about tithing of your time and there's tiling of your fruit every time I get my first harvest of honey daddy gets the first jar because he's the he's a priest my pastor he gets the first fruit y'all don't have to do all that but it is nice to do it God will honor it and all the vegetables the vegetables the other day we were picking corn he took the first two that come to maturity why because I believe in giving firstfruits to the minister to the priest because watch what's gonna happen you look how God's got this thing set up what and to bring the first fruits of our ground watch and the first fruits of all fruit of the trees apples aren't just pears grapes bananas crepes is on the vine free that's okay Oh Lord it's a fruit in it the grapes not a fruit don't look over there look then year by year year by year unto the house of the Lord also the firstborn of our sons we must take them to the remember what Samuel remember what Hanna he said whoever the first one born my first son I'll give to you Lord and put him in service it was Samuel also the firstborn of our sons and of our cattle as it is written in the law and the first wings of our herds and of our flocks so everybody the firstborn to bring to the house of our God unto the priest that minister in the house of our God now I am NOT on the pedestal here today telling you all you got to do all this to pay all this but these people got blessed okay and we've always said if you don't pay your tithe well we can tell who don't pay tithe than he does I'm just telling you that you can see because God promised he even promised the center if he pay his ties he'd give him a blessing but you're willing to pay what I'm fixing to tell you though according to the Bible and that we should bring the first fruits of our dough well you get ready to make your cookies bring daddy oh glob I'm just reading the Bible and our offerings and the fruit of all manner of trees and of wine where you get wine from grapes wine and of oil unto the priest to the chambers of the house of our God and let me let me just get this real quick before we start on tithes and thereby shuts off and go sleep it's not meaning it's meaning that you're giving this unto the Lord listen if you tithe the brother Dale you're wrong but him being the head priest he gets the fruit of that but you're giving it to the Lord if you're not giving it to the Lord then you're just you're just not say I don't know if you give it if you give a 10% of your tithe and you say well I got to do this come on God knows your heart God knows your heart because I'm gonna fixing to tell you in a minute that's the first thing you're why do you call it firstfruits real quiet as soon as I get paid on Friday every other Friday there's a check goes to Lisa's house from the bank with my first amount not after I done paid all my bills that's not right that is not right but what I write I write it on the gross if I make fifteen hundred dollars 150 dollar check those in the mail first fruit first thing not wait to the very end no no come on people you're robbing yourself and we can tell I mean you say we me and brother Dale we can tell we I may be a joker but you know what God doesn't like Jokers every once in a while to really realize what thieves are sorry you can get quite if you want to don't care he put us in this place for something I'm talking about all of us not just me and brother Dalyan but you trust us I trust him to do anything with money I give him I but I'm not giving it to him and give it a guard you know what the Bible tells you you'll be blessed if you pay tithe now you say well brother Dale took it and burn it you've took the burden off for you your run John your blessings operate you've done what the Bible says you've done you've took your tithing and you put it right here and God's gonna bless you now what brother Dale does with it he's got to either get a blessing or curse from it right amen so it's just real simple well if I play my tire bro Dale's gonna get him and you just forget it you paying your tithe to God and the ties of our ground unto the Levites that the same Levi's might have the tithe and all the cities of our tillage or where we raise our crops all right here we go you ready hang on thank you brother dirty I will just because you said go ahead I'm gonna go ahead here we go all right this is first fruits if you don't desire to pay your first fruits to God where's the Christianity part where's the part that were not believing I'm just believing that God said he would pour out the windows of heaven and give us a blessing if we do it so now watch this let's go I got this from the Greek lexicon in Strong's number 11 81 so this is not my deal this is telling you what to do now watch a tenth part of anything a tithe in the Old Testament there were three times most you didn't know that three times one was used to support two Levi's the minister this freed the Levites to provide civil and religious leadership and and you know why just to make a statement here we have some small churches around the message but but a pastor ought to not be tied up with three jobs and then be a pastor this is just me I'm just telling you but look and see that though if brother Colley needed something I believe brother Dale goes right there and he's been doing that for years God has allowed him to do that but there's many preachers that are many pastors that has to work two or three jobs if people will pay their time right you shouldn't have to do that he should be free this freed the Levites to provide civil and religious leadership essentially this ties supported the government of ancient Israel now a tithe of this tithe brother Dale pays tithes y'all didn't know that didn't you've been here long enough you ought to know who's you pay tithe to he pays tied to the preachers that come and preach he pays tithe by 10 percent puts it back into the kitty why a tithe of this tithe went to support the high priest let me get out of the way so you see the next tithe was the tithes of the produce of the land and the firstfruits if you want to read Deuteronomy 12 verse 5 through 18 this tithe was the worship offering the Israelites gave to God and was used to support the religious festivals of the day and I would say to a degree you'll do the same thing because when we have a dinner y'all bring y'all bring food right but now look lastly every third year now this is the one that people don't like but you're supposed to tithe again every three years there's no there's another time lastly every third year an additional tide was gathered to support the state welfare system but watch this went to the fatherless the widows now we do have a fund here that does that and the strangers in the land tithing in the Old Testament represented twenty three and a half percent of the average annual income and corresponds with our modern tax code our modern tax system both John's account that's pretty close twenty three percent that's that I mean that's way back 3,000 years ago twenty three nine third percent of the average annual income and corresponds to our modern tax system both are used to support the government for the good of the people this government the good of our people so how about that so the next time the times were the type of produce is when I was looking at or the first fruits because remember they didn't have Walmart they didn't have Dollar General they might had a Dollar General cuz they're everywhere now but they didn't have a place to where they could go buy produce do you know they literally depended on the people raising a garden and bringing say they had a hundred pounds of tomato I'm loud and I'm sorry you okay okay some people lean back when I especially Russian yeah yeah if you got a hundred pounds of tomatoes you took ten pounds and you took it to the to the priest if you had ten pounds of corn I'm a 100 pounds of corn you took ten pounds of corn and that fed them all year bring into the white storehouse your tithing into the storehouse and I just soon have your time you ever took ten percent of a seven-day week how many hours that is that you're supposed to give the duck hmm but I just want to throw that in there so let's go to Romans eight I know you're real quiet cuz everybody's like oh my lord what am I doing here but to bring the first fruits of the ground so let's go right here romans 8:4 we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth now this is what I was talking about here like going up the Statue of a perfect man because remember we're waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of the body now you and I are not going to be stuck right here some might be here now but the firstfruits have gotten to bring us all the way up a man the unleavened bread we got to eat the pure this is not your godliness or your patience that brother Dale said there's two different meanings to all these there's a godly meaning to lose a godly knowledge of godly temperance and godly patience a godly brotherly kindness sure will you be nice to people but can you be nice to somebody hey sure there's the deal yeah that again and men on that I heard you the first time but we know that the whole creation groaneth and travaileth in pain waiting until now for what us they have the firstfruits and we'll read it in a minute not only they but ourselves also which have the first Paul is telling us we've got the firstfruits of the Spirit in other words we've got the mature part first this is our age our age is the Eagle ages up here we have the firstfruits of the Spirit even when we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body let's go to the next scripture let's go to first Corinthians 15 verse 20 I love this scripture right here and if you just read over it's so confusing says if in this life only we have hope and crops now our only hope is in Christ but if it's only in this life then we just gonna die and go by the grave and they ain't going nowhere that's what he's saying if in this life only we have hope in Christ hope we don't have a hope we have a shirt we have a surety we are of all men most miserable but now is Christ risen from the dead hallelu and become the firstfruits of them that slept now everybody can come out of the grave when he took his feet and he stepped out on the outside he said all power in heaven earth been given unto me he meant what he said for since by man came death for it since by man came death whoa now what's that saying now my man came also the resurrection of the Dead Jesus Christ raised a man because he was the first fruit he couldn't die something else and raised something else no he died in that body he raised in the same body for his in Adam all die even so in Christ shall all be made alive but every man in his own order we're not in the order of to church ages ago or three churches ago or four church days ago we're in this church age right here every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits afterwards us because you know what firstfruits literally means there's more to come because you got a first fruit that means that that's the only one that's the first one that come to maturity we got some corn in it we got a harvest tomorrow there's something that's not ready but there's some that is there's some that got the site a perfect sunlight that got the perfect fertilizer heard the perfect Word of God and they come to maturity first listen you can't put a seed in a soil that has no nutrition and expected to grow look at your seed that God planted by the son of man the difference the different places they fell the last one it says good ground I believe God put it in some good ground and when he put it in some good ground the first one to mature but that doesn't mean you take that and wave it and then the priest says well I'm gonna eat this and y'all gonna die no he's waving it saying hey I accept what you planted and it has come up and it's going to keep coming up and it's going to come to maturity because this is only the first fruits listen if we don't have a resurrection then Jesus Christ died in vain him being though the first one up we're going to see a resurrection brother Paul saw the people downstairs and he was taking pictures of some of the ones that have gone on that we've got pictures of downstairs we're looking for them they're not coming back old either young man young woman Robert items not gonna be with the way I saw him last to hump over like this with his fingers turned sideways because of arthritis no that's gone that's done that's done never will you see that again but in every man in his own order Christ the firstfruits had to have one do it first so we had to have a profit in the end time to go to maturity go to maturity first so that he can proclaim that there's more to come you can decide whether it's you or not but I'm gonna decide that it's me Christ the firstfruits afterwards they that are Christ's at his coming everybody okay with that saying man [Music] now let's go right here now they don't I don't think they have this so I'm just gonna give you what's what the commentator said that really blessed my heart because look it says traditionally in Temple times the first-fruit portion now remember this is now going just I'm gonna be a little bit longer today I'll usually keep it about an hour so I'm gonna go over a little bit extra mm just for Leah and Paul traditionally in Temple times the first-fruit portion of barley was cut at the going down of the Sun on the weekly Sabbath and presented at 9:00 a.m. the next morning in the temple what Casta early in the morning the Bible says the first day of the week there was a first fruit waved and when that grave came open they didn't have to take two or three hundred Centurions to roll that rock all all Jesus did was went and that thing just flipped out of the way because there was nothing gonna hold him down the term firstfruits means that there are more to come when the priest waved the sheaves of the barley harvest before the Lord as the firstfruits he was thanking God for the abundant harvest that they were about to have the firstfruits were the first the very first of the harvest as it was only the beginning of the abundance of the harvest that was about to come when Jesus resurrected that started that started the rapture we know that but that started the ability for me and you to grow to maturity amen Messiah the firstfruits of the resurrection meant that he was the first of the Resurrection that would never see death again the abundance of the harvest of the resurrection means that there will be an abundance of resurrection in the future and we are recipients of that a couple more things right here the timing of the feast it was observed once they entered the land so you you can't you can't be the first one up if you haven't went through Passover if you have a went through unleavened bread and went through that wilderness journey and come to what the Promised Land see when you get born again that's your Promised Land right all right so look the day of the feast on the day of the feast there would be no servile work it was also observed on the first day of the week after Passover which could be on any day of the week the Passover could be only needed a of the week but firstfruits had to be Sunday the day after the Sabbath all right that's why we celebrate the feast of firstfruits every Sunday every Sunday there has been a sheaf waved over the people as the prophet of God told us there's been a sheaf wave that has given us an opportunity to have a resurrection even those that have gone on even those that are down there in the in the room there with their with their pictures they've went on but guess what they're gonna be they're gonna be first fruit coming back this way hey man Passover could be any day of the week but as the Lord gave the feast of firstfruits it was only to be the one day which was the first day of the week after the Passover now a couple more things first fruit pertained to barley harvest now here's the difference in barley and wheat there buddy awake because this is very important and listen to this in revelation 6 verse 6 I just got this sitting back here and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and you get three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and one barley was the poor people's bread mr. Cletus Sagan ahead she's before barley is cheaper the common people I wrote myself a note the common people heard him gladly and barley you say oh now what he's got to be worth more than that the Bible says Jesus who made himself a little lower than the Angels for the suffering of death crowned with glory you know why he resurrected he didn't resurrect so that he could be number one guy now he was barley he came up during the barley harvest but he came up on the barley harvest so that there would be a wheat harvest and the weed is more important than the barley he said oh my momma no God has bestowed all of his gift on herself no he's bestowed all the gifts on you he became barley so that we can become wheat and wheat is harvested at the feast of Pentecost Aaron what will that do for you if that don't stir your soul what your spoon fell out of the boat or your boat think about that for a little while so firstfruits pertains to barley harvest but it is the first crop to come to maturity in April March and April then the feast of Pentecost which is called another first fruit it pertains to wheat it matures second so Christ had to come to maturity first during the barley harvest and then remember what happened in the Book of Ruth what was she gleaning and actually if you go back in the Bible we'll stop right there musicians come in the Bible look at your lows that Jesus turned into multiplying lows it was barley loaves a man so there's a difference there in the barn let that down one more time I got a quote right here let's read this right here when your eyes are open nineteen sixty four but go ahead and come on I'll do it I'll do it I can handle it now let's Gloria scene when we have before us tonight it's Jesus up from the dead in the springtime walking around up from the spring the resurrection the first flower to rise from the dead our Lord Jesus he was the firstfruits of them that slept the Easter flower that came up the first one that struck it stuck his head up after the cold midnight of darkness and saith he had paid the sin pricing God raised him up on the third day we believe that with all our hearts that God raised him up on the third day according to his promise and we believe it according to the scripture that he raised him up the third day he was the first one that raised from the dead the firstfruits of the ones that slept well I got excited when I saw that barley I thought well when you first look at that you it was considered the poor people's bread but when Jesus came he made his staff lower than the Angels he made himself lower than us because you know what he done he took on your sin he took on your sin and my sin we didn't brother brother John we didn't have to go on a cross and have stripes put on her back right we didn't have nails put in our hand but the barley did the barley had to be the first one so that he could come to maturity and then he could look down the line and say I got some wheat that's coming because he told him he said tarry in Jerusalem you wheat you're not ready yet but I'm gonna go off the thing but in a few days I'll be back and the Bible said and we'll get to it wins tonight when the day of Pentecost was fully come that was a sound from heaven like a rushing mighty wind and you could see that wheat you can see that wheat and all of a sudden they was a charge in that wheat and that wheat stood straight up and said man brother this is that it was spoken of enjoy we've had enough of those bugs eaten i got bugs eating my plants at home and i'm gonna take care of them suckers [Music] well they're eating my food don't let bugs eat your food i'm talking spiritually let's stand to our feet get rid of those things but the first fruit he came and made himself us so that he by his graves may make us him he took stripes on his back brother John that you'll never have to take he had holes put in his hand brother Paul that you never have to have he'll walk to an eternity with a body with his hands that are scarred all the pieces for me and you but you and I are gonna walk in a perfect body that has not a spot or wrinkle and as old people say hallelujah no wrinkles I'm just telling you what I'm just telling you what the barley told me I'm just telling you what that common barley that the people eat though bill poor people heard him gladly because he was barley he wasn't anything that's great something but he was the greatest thing that ever came on the face of this earth and man didn't realize it but buddy on the day of Pentecost when the day of Pentecost came they knew who that was they knew who that was because Peter says this is that that was spoken of in Joel and all he preached a sermon brother and he said just for about 30 minutes what a powerful sermon he walked outside and he said this is that we've crucified the Lord of glory and that three thousand congregation downstairs that little wheel was moving back and forth they said what must we do to have what you got what must I do brother Dale to have what you got to have what you got Peter said repent repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ that puts you in the field let's sing a song god bless you from the dead and he is all people every need every time [Music] listen if you don't love Jesus Christ one day you're gonna have to bow because you have to bow to the king but if

flesh [Music] this is the harvest that Jesus told him he's going to send the angels he said don't divide them now because sometimes they look the same you got your mate believers and unbelievers and
