of it but just keep praying far cuz she's real weak and and everything and that's that's a lot of problem we see some that may be visitors among us today so if they are we always say to you welcome but then when you come to times you're just a part of us you know you know so just amen and amen any other announcements I think Terrence made all of the announcements the Easter time is what April

for everything we know you give it to us freely so then we don't have to work for it we don't have to strive for it all we got to do is accept it we thank you and just have your way with us now as we

remember the sick among us you promised it you said you send your word in heal us and deliver us from the destruction so just take care of all of these and just have your way now as we read your words you speak to our hearts we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen then we're going to first Peter 1 we've been reading this but the main part is to be reading verse 23 but we read all of this because we want to make sure we we light up and see you know where we come from for as much as you know that you were not redeemed with corruptible things as silver and gold from your vain conversation received by tradition from your father's now our thought today will be relating to we've been speaking about the new birth being a revelation so it'll be relating to revelation bringing restoration alright so then that's what he's he's covering seeing and laying out that point all right but with the precious blood of Christ as of a lamb without blemish and without spot who've early was foreordained before the foundation of the world but was made but was manifest in these last days for you who by him do believe in God that raised him up from the dead and gave him glory that your faith and hope might be in God seeing you have purified your souls and obeying the truth but now what's Oh bassy you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto unfeigned love of the Brethren since you love one another with a pure heart fervently being born again not of corruptible seed but of incorruptible by the Word of God which liveth and abideth forever now remember being born again is applied two ways we are when you come to Christ you accept him as your savior etc you're being born again all right but then when you get into the statue of a perfect man the pyramid and start talking then you come into the real meaning of being born again because it's something transpiring in your life every day in your Christian experience okay now we go to acts 1 in 6 when that therefore were come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom unto Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the things are the seasons which the father hath put into his own hand now in other words if you read that and don't get it right read it with this thought in other words they've asked him about the kingdom and what's his answer be different as we would think of it with what he's just saying it don't be concerned about the kingdoms and the things here's what you need to be concerned about ok so let's read it over alright and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power don't worry about it because they something far you that'll take care of this because that's what he's telling the disciples now this is right at his ascension huh which he shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost has come upon you and you shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem in Judea and Samaria and to the other most part of the earth and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up in a cloud received him out of their shot you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word so you understand what I'm saying he was trying to tell him don't worry about these be concerned about the fact of knowing where you're at and what's taking place because that's what we're doing now all right then he had sins and goes away all right now we've been speaking about the thought of being born again and we've covered many things and I covered there Wednesday in you know bringing it down to a point that I wanted you to follow I've asked you to read the stature of a perfect man I've asked you to read many of related messages into that area of time and study it I've asked you to read like blasphemous names because but I seen these names and the stature of perfect land blasphemous names as priests I store the statue of a perfect man all right but it's explaining you get a better concept or thought of what's being said in the message of the statue of a perfect man all right now into doing that then we're looking at it as the new birth we've come through the Old Testament all the way through up to her that we are now and we've come to the position of talking about the new birth as coming onto their Pentecost - to the disciples bringing the revealed Word and what have we asked you over and over and what what if I always taught you because this is what I believe I believe the new birth is the birth of the word all right now you tell me something else it would be you know it can't be it's the birth of the word the disciples heard the word for three and a half years all right then the whole ego fell as a prophet said to irrigate that word or make it alive and dar was the new birth they alright then knowing it from that we we can hold a point that the birth of the word is Christ alright as we'll read it in a minute the Prophet says you can't be saved how many times we read that over and over he said you can't be saved without a revelation we see then what people are think but because they're thinking about it as a young child experienced a lot of times of coming accepting Jesus Christ and they say I didn't get no revelation well think sensibly you know cuz I'm not talking to the children they probably understood what took place I'm talking to you adults think sensibly what is the new word the Prophet will say it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well then don't you remember when God called you don't you remember when he dealt with you in your life don't you remember when you accepted him as your Savior and then we've got many experiences and many people tell about the things of great things happening all of that swelling weren't great but what is the birth it's the birth of the word well I didn't hear no word you didn't hear the preacher you didn't hear the Sunday school teacher you didn't hear mom you didn't your dad or our brother or somebody talking to you about the Lord that's what I am trying to get you to see is to look at things instead of what you see we think well what revelation do we need to get you know well see now you're going to tongues is an evidence you're going to experiences like that of the wrong thing the it's the birth of the word of whatever God reveals to you and I'm honest to say that I don't believe a lot of people get the new birth cause they don't know what it is they don't know what it is I remember we read the quote from the Prophet if you don't know what the Holy Ghost is then how you gonna know when you got it see how you gonna know when you got if you don't know what it is well I believe it's this it's just a it's just a something coming down you know that's what he said in blasphemous names he said it's been so the baptism of the Holy Ghost has been so incorrectly taught he said until we just say baptism he said now that a lot goes with it said like it's a car automobile said there's a lot goes with that let's see then that way we don't follow it and listen to the Prophet and that's why it gets confusing when he'll make statements that totally seems like that tur totally out then he doesn't know what he's talking about or that he later got it straightened out that's the great point among the people of the message you know uh-huh he done it but he later he got it straightened out well okay tell me when he straightened it out you know because it was so much that he needed straighten it out then this Shirley Hill were to mark down and said something somewhere what I used to believe this way because he was strict enough and straight enough to say even one time he said I used to believe the evidence of the Holy Ghost was this or was that or as I thought love or he said until the Holy Ghost straightened me out well he used to believe the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost until the Lord straightened him out well then why why would be we can be concerned about things why not just look for him to find out what it is but yet look at it in the right direction to the point that we're we're not trying to find contradictions but we're trying to find truth the truth the part truth is wonderful but D truth all right so now remember what we've been bringing or the thought that we brought this past Wednesday now this is the way I believe it and this way I've always tried to express anything you've heard brother Branham say over and over that our human language and different times like that is so contrary until you know it's hard to understand he said now like the word board he said you can say come on board a ship you say stand on this board because I'm bored with you so you got three different meanings or thoughts of using that but now remember remember what I've always tried to get you to see the before and the after explains what you're talking about so then we should search the Word of God if we think we found something contrary or the message we should search before we should search after to see whatever it fits because then I can say to you and simple understanding about the board come on board stand on this board because I'm bored with you now you know how no problem to understanding what I said do what's the problem with the word board if we've explained it right what's the problem we're trying to to get our thoughts in the right order as we say in Wednesday that there's a lot of things brother Branham says that sounds like a lot of times its contrary one to the other but give it time wait on the Lord to where he can reveal it then you'll find out he's not as contrary as you think right because there's a lot of statements that he'll make that my point is if you take before what he said and then go after what he said the thought you might find out he knew what he's talking about all along right let's see we are so quick to try to find this contradiction or that contradict when I declared the contradictions or not that it's our understanding it's what messes it up it's our thoughts our ideas you know that we have well he said this yeah but I found just that smart ethically very intelligent parts of human beings that were always want to be number one to find out something well I don't care if I'm number ten or whatever it is as long as I get it right but understand the point the before and the after will describe you you take like brother Brennan would say you know we read a book and it says and John and Mary lived happily ever after well you know nothing about who Johnny is and who Mary is and while they're happy but if you take the before of it study the point over to where you're going and then you can come up and and see John and Mary what they they got married today they live happily ever after now you've got your answer and you're not confused that's what I believe about the message it sounds contradictory but sit down and listen to it and then study in the line up of the thought of that because that's what I was trying to do Wednesday night all right try to bring the thought to you know because you can take I can take brother branham's message you can too and I can make it say anything I want it to say about pulling quotes and moving things and declaring this or that right we done it with the Bible you can take the Bible and make it say what you want it to say now listen what was emphasizing Wednesday though that's not what the Bible is saying the Bible doesn't change with my thoughts and my ideas the Bible never called a Trinity right but we swore by it right all right then it's if we get the right idea we see the Bible didn't change and you don't have to change brother Browns message to make it fit now he was a human being let's allow him to have parts abiding that sometimes is misunderstood maybe his speech is some way or maybe he said something and probably a lot of times you know how it is with your own self sometimes you'd walk up to bread around him and you'd say brother around them you said so-and-so it's a if I said that I sure wasn't it was something wrong I don't remember saying that what because it was a human being right and see then we want to go by those things you know to try to determine whether he was a prophet or not I've never been to the basis now you can like this or not I've never been to the basis of thinking that brother Branham would make a slip of a tongue about something 707 seventh out he wasn't no prophet he was no prophet he know the difference I likened that unto her that you remember when the lady came there in washing Jesus's feet and putting the on him but only remember what the man said if he was a prophet he'd know what kind of woman this is that's paraphrasing it but it's close didn't it see if he was a prophet so she's always trying to find out something that demon within mankind is trying to tear down this message in stead of accepting it and waiting on God to reveal it right now that's my whole point that's the way that I've always been it alright so now we've been talking about as I said the new birth and got to the point of the to the day of Pentecost and the coming of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right and that baptism with the Holy Ghost when it came on to their Pentecost remember it came to a hundred and twenty in the upper room they had been tutored and trained of the Lord for three and a half years and then the Holy Ghost fail but outside a few hours later the three thousand heard one message and received the baptism of the Holy Ghost just one message at the house of Kinesis it was one message one thought one point and they received the baptism when the whole to go and I believe that's the one didn't it were this cell talking about how to forbid them to be baptized Liat seeing that they receive the Holy Ghost we did at the beginning well now there's no difference in the basis of the 3,000 of receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the difference there's no difference in them and a 120 in the Upper Room they both received the baptism in the Holy Spirit which was a new birth which was eternal life all right now the difference was was the teaching that had been there that the disciples had been taught that word and then when God quickened it to him see then it was determined in them that they would have the faith of the father's as we call it or looking at the pyramid where brother Brown said statue of a perfect man you heard him he said they had these virtues and I remember he said they didn't have the headstone he said it hadn't come yet so now put that in line and hold that point but they had where it says Holy Spirit one because they'd been talk so Peter and then Peter and Paul was explaining how to come to her that they were because he says they're in accent women in a in Peter that we read second Peter says add to your faith and he says talking about them of like precious faith and brethren said he's not talking to the world he's talking to the church those that are in Christ Jesus all right now see you can't use the group in the 3,000 down stars to teach the word because they had no tutoring of the word now they could talk to the people they could direct and all that but get what I'm saying God never used the novice to write the word how could have we'll call him Sam for Ryan how could Sam walked out on the day of Pentecost get the Holy Ghost was in the 3000 then turn around tell the rest of them how to get tired he couldn't do it it took somebody that had already been there so Peter had been dire Peter had reached that position of the virtues up to where it says Holy Spirit and then he could tell people how to get to where he was because that's what he was doing all right now what was her thought Paul said the same thing Peter said now remember what ROM explains it Paul and Peter had difference in dot and idea about how Peter was behaving but said there was no difference in doctrine so now God used Peter to bring the message of second Peter of the stature of a perfect man all right he used Paul in that I've asked you to read about it because we're getting over to it he used Paul especially like Galatians 4 where he's talking about the tutors and and how the child is a child when it's born but it's under tutors and owners until the time of appointed and then it can be adopted well the statue of a perfect man is the message telling you how to become to that Paul is explaining what happens he's using the natural world life of the adoption of stage that a child is a child when it's born into the family all right but in its tutored and trained until it comes to the position it can be adopted into that family right all right to the full inheritance at that place that's exactly what Peter's doing Peter's explaining how it's done come on if you read the message we read them over and over to you or brother Brian said statue of a perfect man what he said how faith and be born again he said see our whole basis now is based on faith see because you're born again at faith he says and read to Peter they're worse at those that have straight escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust what this person this person that starts up the pyramid that starts at faith of that new birth experience that that person as it does it's a child little brother said now I didn't say the statement but around said that the baptism of the Holy Ghost didn't make you no greater no more Christian than he was he was born of faith I didn't say that he did what I'm saying you are not listening to what he's saying you're not listening to try to understand what he's saying you're listening to put your own thoughts or ideas what I found is all right so what is it Paul and Peter we're not contouring doctrine but Paul never heard Peter teach the statue of a perfect man he went to the backside of the desert because God needed two things remember in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established is that Scripture God needed for another way or for somebody else to teach this so it used Peter two sticks teach it add to your faith virtue or knowledge temperance patience he uses Paul to explain it in the form of the child as long as it's a child when it's born we said it differs not but said then it's tutored and trained they're explaining the same thing and God has his compound part he has his point because it's always in the mouth of two or three witnesses let everything be established then we'll get back to that when we when we get to the message part later I'm just trying to stay with the new birth as to seeing the new birth and what it is and we'll get down to her brother branham see God had the sin brother branham he went up that stature a perfect man by himself now you say wait a minute who taught brother branham same one at all Paul who taught Paul wouldn't Peter the Holy Ghost in the backside of the desert who taught brother branham this message right all right now we got to write line up right Peter can tell you how this being born again is taking place Paul is giving you references to the life and the things in what it does but a random come to bring us back to restoration remember revelation branes restoration all right see it's bringing us but a random had to get the message read it yourself he said 30-something years before he could preach that we get you go back to the inner veil and well those messages and listen to him talk about Aluva living moving instrumentality of Christianity walking into feet he was teaching those things back there trying his best to tell those Pentecostals he said that's where you failed he said you think born into the family makes you fully settled in everybody he said that brought this brought you in the family he said but you've got to have this you got out of the growth development why because God had called him that away uh-huh see then do we believe it that away brother brother never come to straighten out the Bible then he come to tell us what it say it you know what it said it said what it say it right I mean it said what it said as I standing there want to go he didn't have to have something to go over this way but go read to before of the book and after the book and read it all the way through and you'll find out something but it's like I saying the other day I asked a simple question how many people have really read the seal book but I set and taught with ministers and things that didn't even have a Daniel seventy weeks book but they could tell you everything brother Branham say it and didn't even have a book never read one that's pretty good and that kind of reminds me I like he's to these school teachers an amendment and for the Bob family you know it's kind of like steel down our shaving in you in kindergarten you know cuz that's about like our thoughts sometimes okay now listen so then brother branham answered his own question when he said own statue refer I mean on cross the minister of God reveal paragraph 2 33 to 34 brother branham what he is the new birth he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you it's the word that's been revealed to you it's the making alive of the word to you that's why we're being born again see your birth doesn't stop that dis started that's why you put the adoption over with the statue of a perfect man and you can see the the message laid out beautiful Paul explains the natural that of child as a child when it's born it's born into the family Peter tells you born again of those of like precious faith he said and they gave you a whole bunch of quotes were brought around we're talking about like precious faith he said Timothy had like precious faith the one because it was a new birth all right Peter is telling you the new birth get the new birth and then you're growing into grace and knowledge as the word is revealed to you Paul is telling you the natural part of the life to bring you to an adoption and both reach the same position Peter's talking about revelation Paul must be talking about revelation uh-huh so then what did what did he say what is the new birth brother branham he said it's the baptism when the holder goes all right yeah page 154 of the church age book what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost no here he says what is the new bar he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you all right now you got what the new birth is right new birth is revelation personally to you see that's why your revelation never stops if it stopped it would be like a baby growing so much and then quitting right that would be the point of this stop when we say we don't grow no more but we do we grow out okay but listen so Brendan what is the new birth it's revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you he said it's not joining the church to this that enough he says revelation to you now he says what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost well if he answers it did water know what the baptism of the Holy Ghost is because he goes on on into some learning church age 144 and he says now we want to find out what this Holy Ghost is according to the word he says it's not according to me and it's not according to you it has to be according to thus saith the Lord now we're going to believe it but what is the baptism with the Holy Ghost it is the spirit baptizing you into the body of Christ it is the new birth it is the Spirit of God coming in and filling you after you have repented having heard heard his word and been baptized in the water so now what is the baptism went on it's the new birth what is the new birth it's a baptism with the Holy Ghost all right see then that's why that I've always taught it that away and I believe the Prophet taught it into that form that what the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost the being born again is all the same it's not three different parts are three different you know it's not one leading to the other one and then you finally get to this one no but it's explaining what he said when he said it on blasphemous night he said to halt the Holy Ghost has been so incorrectly told you remember where I gave the one where he said they was nine hundred different ways of seeing the baptism of the Holy Ghost because he's referring to how many there are nine hundred and something different denominations and things gonna and just think about that many different thoughts about one new birth no wonder it's so missed in or so incorrectly talk we see I believe when you're born again I truly born again not make believe you believe in to eternal life we've been through that but Ren says your new birth starts when you believe right it starts when you believe the day you believe that new birth star that doesn't mean it's in fulfillment he said it's like a baby in the wound of a mother he said it's conceived but it's not come forth yet see you believe unto eternal life and we went through it over and over but one said if you die in that state he said sure you're going to heaven but he never said you'd be in the bride he never said you had eternal life that stage you're believing on - we've been through the whole time bringing it out where we can come to the point to what we're doing of the new birth the emphases I've been bringing is one time are you born again do you have the new birth then why you know or what's your dollars and you say new birth to most people I spoke in tongues I shouted I cried I didn't got nothing to do with it it's after-effects that's the baby after he gets here that's after comes out of the wound that's the baby after it's born right well you don't believe in that no I I believe in all of the signs and wonders I believe in all of the things of God but I have to also believe where the Prophet would say the recent received the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this day without a sensation but he never talked receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost without an experience now you find that one for me an experience is something you live through a sensation is a stimulation upon your feelings or whatever that's why your anointed ones will work all right but now listen so then if it's true that the new birth the baptism of the Holy Ghost and being born again is the same thing then we can listen to the Prophet as he says things if you keep that thought in your mind then when you come to sounding like contrary things if you'll just simply listen and you'll see him saying things that are wonderful he says I can conclusively prove that you are born again and then baptized into the body now that sounds like it's totally contrary to what he just said about the baptism of the Holy Spirit and what it is are the new birth and what it is i sounds like he's teaching some denominational ID or thought that they had no that's exactly right if you'll just go to the pyramid and look at it you are born again at faith but there's a baptism which is the faith of the father's the opening of the word that doesn't end all about the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's where people miss correct and tout it sees the new birth is a baptism of the Holy Spirit right here this is a baptism in the Holy Spirit here this is the baptism of the Holy Spirit here and every one of these is being born again every one of them at the birth come on ascend statue of a perfect man our blasphemy is named I'm looking at it this morning he says you're birthed into this into this into this and there's not seven new birth a birth means are coming forth into so as you come forward into these things as they come forth into you the Holy Ghost seals them in and you're climbing upward the growth development of God's Word it's simple if we just think of it I remember years ago standing in a churchyard in Athens Georgia and this man said I'll tell you what now that adoption is simple that adoption is simple we said that stature a perfect land is confusing I remember going because I knew if I opened my mouth I was going to have to say you are a dummy it cannot see the statue of a perfect man the born-again experience the adoptions and all that it's one in the same but it's according what you're reading from and what's it being explained what about brother Branham II remember on patents BC and I've been over this and over he said you can't be saved without a revelation well I didn't get rolling so you ain't say you said it I didn't you made a statement I didn't get a revelation then you're saying you're not saved because the Prophet said you can't be saved without a revelation it's Revelation Jesus Christ person to you and what I like in cross the mystery where he talks about the revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person you remember that one the most illiterate person can receive the new birth they can be born again and right into the family of God see we think it's got to be something this out the other I didn't make these statements you argue your prophet but listen what do we find out when spoken word is reading a seat for the birth of the word is Christ not a polluted with denominations in time the early church no denomination just the word and spirit irrigated God laid the word down like that and the Holy Ghost irrigated it in their zeal and what are we going in spoken word to bring out all of God's sons must be the same to be born of the word and spirit brings us back to the spoken word again like in John 3 to be born to the word and spirit brings you back to what Jesus was talking about because that's where John three is right when he said to Nicodemus you must be born again to be born to the word in spirit if Nicodemus could have took that word and held on and went over to Pentecost and receive the Holy Ghost he did note exactly what Jesus was talking about without ain't all of this statement listen to be born of the word ask you to be born to the water in the spirit what does it do then it brings you right back again unto the place of were you should have been at the beginning what was the beginning Adam and Eve in the garden is that the beginning remember you ain't talking about the beginning of that he talked about the real beginning that's why I tried to get you to see that and it was so vital from blasphemous names where brother run said God breathed into the nostrils of Adam eternal life so Adam had eternal life in his soul but his body and his spirit was an eternal alright what happened on the defini couch in the soul of mankind would it be the three thousand nine hundred and twenty they all received the Holy Ghost all right that was eternal life in their soul but their body and spirit still the same every born-again believers is that a way to be born to the word and spirit brings you back like we should have been without a fall you remember this one he said you were supposed to be here this spoken words originally in the right way at the beginning but being that you come the way you did you're subject for the fall but being that you're pretty but being that you're you've predestinated you hear the word it brings you right back where you were predestinated what about the words what about the new birth bringing you back the place use predestinate i just don't see it that could be the new birth - well come on didn't you get eternal life when you got the new birth he's not that the same thing Adam had in the guard come on what does he say then this is what I like brings you right back where you were predestinated he says Amen said never saw that before that's what he said said I never saw that before see shirts if we believe this simple point that the new birth the born-again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one in the sign the brother run says in the church age book it is one of the sign but do we believe it as like I said to the human mind we can kind of comprehend the new birth we can kind of relate to the new birth and the the born-again experience but it's hard to think about the baptism of the Holy Ghost so we think the baptism has got to be something up in here that comes down fluttering across us or something that was not the new birth birth to the disciples in the upper room the new birth was when the lick of fire came on each one of them where God divided itself among them that anointing can do not knowing anybody on your spirit we're not doing away with hogs in the upper room we're explaining it to the point of what that new birth was when that lick of fire came on each one every born-again believer gets a lick of fire burn you burn if we believe that it makes it so easy then to be able to preach the message and you wouldn't be in the mass confusion of the people of this message [Music] you wouldn't be people being concerned I mean it wouldn't be you know all messed up it'd be one thing listen to this when he gets into the church age booth this is right after he says this is dust that you've got to have it according to the staff the Lord to receive Christ is to receive his spirit to receive his spirit is to be born again to receive his spirit is to be baptized with the Holy Ghost he's put them all through in one program amen these folks believe that's wonderful but they stop there you receive the holy goes after you believe it has always been that way and always will be the very word of direction to the people was by Peter at Pentecost but if we believe it that way then all three of what we look at is not three things it's explaining one thing then it'll make it so easy to understand what I was immersed rating very minute ago that Paul is describing or illustrating it from his point of view of looking at the Bible and studying the Bible all of those years and he'd studied the adoption of phases of phases he had studied those things he knew all of that from his background right and then he teaches the baby is a birth it's born again you know it's Apple it's a baby born in the family then it's tutored it's given the Holy Spirit remember we read the scripture you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is California two things is to be considered Jesus was telling the disciples there because he was fixing to his sin he said after you receive the Holy Ghost you're gonna get power right come on the statue of a perfect man we will get to it eventually when we get there you remember virtue means strength and strength is power you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost has come upon you that has a compound meaning that's just like being born again that's coming into the body and being born again as a development in the body that way we don't have to worry about wordings and thoughts and ideas we can consider it all right see then brother branham in the hole matches your statue a perfect man I've asked you to read it over and over and I doubt most of you've read it that's all right go see that way if you don't read it now you're going to get a flunk when you come to the test yeah they used to have a teacher over there in Banks County was all life and and about it always have because they called her flunking Duncan because she was a math teacher and but she didn't bleh you didn't have no brownie points to try to get on her side you either got it or didn't get it but the ones that got it could go to college she was an algebra teacher and state you could go to college on what she had because she taught it right all right let's see if you don't even read the book now what is somebody to come along told her well I'm right never read the books he just staff here zero to start with she wouldn't even flew with you right you won't read the Bible you won't read the message I asked you to I know all about it how do you know all about the book I mean come on Church I didn't mean blame common sense I hate to be rough it that way but why not oh we know all about it they even read the book I don't need to read the book I got it myself you got it yourself all right but now I want to honestly tell you I don't want got you God if you got it yourself can I be honest with that I don't want what you got if you got it yourself because according to my Bible we got to have somebody to help us and lead us they got us injury and according to my understanding to the Bible you have to have to have somebody to teach you but brother Dale I got where the property said we don't need teachers you better read the rest of it he said why did God put teachers into the body I'll get around one of these days preaching on them predestinated fivefold ministry but all right listen do you understand then let me get this in a hurry then it will read a little bit do you understand what I'm trying to bring I don't ask you to believe it I've never asked nobody to believe anything I've talked I asked you to go home and pray about it I asked you to search yourself your soul searching yourself and search out what is saying search out to see if it fits or not because that a way it would be your experience all right so then all the before and all the after brother Branham in the after of the statue of a perfect man he's in the church age book explaining that these are one in the same he's talking about how the people are confused about when he de when he gives an altar call you ever noticed I've asked this question over wonder you thought about it it's not Rutter Branham never say it I want y'all to come up here and and and get justified you ever heard him say anything like that and then we'll put you in a room and then you can get sanctified and then we'll put you in another room you get the baptism the whole goes what do you always say come up and receive Jesus Christ right it's fine to say okay brother Dale I believe I met justification that's good because we believe in that of chopping off you Pisceans a man it's good to be talk about sanctification that's wonderful that's part of the Word of God but you just don't ask people to come up and be sanctified brother Branham didn't do those things listen to what he done from the church age book page 144 he's talking about the people and he said they misunderstood him he said my Pentecostal friends upon hearing me say this believe that I'm inviting people to come forward to be baptized with the Holy Ghost because they're already born again and remember that so when I invite those who are spirit filled to come and deal with those who have answered the invitation to receive the spirit these dear one search for word and deal with the people in such manner as to encourage them to yield to God and believe to speaking in tongues well they've got it up here so what'd he say I want to tell you exactly what I mean now this is exactly what he means I mean for the sinner to come forward and be born again which is to be baptized into the body of Christ by the Holy Ghost which is exactly what took place at Pentecost when the church was launched in other words to be born of the Spirit is to be truly baptized with the Holy Ghost it is one in the same and we can read that's after the seal I mean after the statue of a perfect man here's another one taken from God's only provided way for this day of 1964 he said that's the way out to me today not to be hurted by some denominational coup but come in the way God said come by the baptism of the holy ghost and the new birth forming revival not Church joining soliciting from door to door but of birth being born again filled with the Holy Ghost God's Way put them all three in one paragraph or one sentence that's why I believe the new birth the born-again experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one of the sign yeah there's three stages or phases oh great but that's justification sanctification the baptism will only go so we can say well we know he said this over here but remember what we've read in Wednesday night remember these statements of go ahead brother we're on number 10 now we'll start reading so listen to these statements in relation to the message got number 10 which is a key to the door well I told him I didn't know where we'd jump up and start absent I'd be all right so communion is for Christians that's born again of the Spirit of God and born again does not necessarily mean now that you got the whole together he's just explained you get the holy ghost as a born-again experience what's it and remember now many teach I don't know anybody teaches it like this you know as old brother organ right said that not from the pulpit here see but new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it that sounds like he's saying something contrary how many of you mark them winds did with reading them how about it there's number ten number eleven thank you form you must be born again I suppose maybe just a little different from what the regular church teaches it I teach them to believe and believe can sufficiently proved by the scripture that you're born of the Spirit and then baptized into the body by the Holy Spirit you remember what I said Wednesday when I read that one back before and I read this when I read every one of them I said that's saying the new birth the baptism gonna hold ago in the morning in experience is the same we're gonna read this then we'll drop back number 11 number two oil taken from the message of why 62 I never thought there was a person believed like I believed till this morning I heard Charles Flores are going down he believes to that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth is being born the Holy Ghost is a baptism that's exactly right that's not contrary that's exactly right come on you're born again at faith and then the Holy Ghost baptizes you into all of these things come on so it's not wrong roll it back down we'll get each one of them come back down to the leaven go the other way all right was he say leavin teach the specifically proof that you're born to the spirit and then baptize in the body by the Holy Spirit you're born of the Spirit of God you're born again at faith and you're baptized into all of these things each is a birth teachers are coming for okay back down to ten where will do this is what then he says but the new birth is not in the baptism of the Holy Spirit they just what we just read that the new birth is not the baptism of the Holy Spirit the scripture doesn't support it see of course what's he read communion is for Christians that's born again of the Spirit and born again does not necessarily mean that you've got the Holy Ghost you're born again right here by the baptism of the Holy go but you don't have all of these things it's simple it's not confusing this is the before and the after okay what do we got on the thirteen now twelve excuse me now bones well back down one you know the twelve okay these are why I'm against organized religion I never thought there was a person believed what we'd read that one there okay come on up now what do we got and the message questions and answers on Hebrews what does he say and by one spirit we're all baptized into one body that's correctly the baptism of the Holy Ghost is a different act from the new birth see that's exactly right you're baptized by the Holy Spirit here at your new birth that brings you into the body of Christ but then you're being born again and you're being it's birthing you into these things and it's the Holy Spirit all the way up the pyramid so you say I got it all when I got the new Merton you didn't get it all when you got the new book you just got started when you got the new birth right come on going boy this is 14 taken from you must be born again it goes to its destination you couldn't pull it if you had to that Souls got to be change here born again all right got to be changed mourned again you say what about the Holy Ghost brother branham the Holy Ghost baptizes you into the body for service but you believe until eternal life that's right you believe into eternal life you believe into the baptism when the whole go and then you're baptized into these times now watch him as he keeps on going he that hears my words and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life you're baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body for manifestation of the guilts and so forth but you believe into eternal life for the benefit station of the yes now wait a minute but but brother Branham I thought Gibson Collins without repentance you know we just got gifts where do we read this next another one in a minute where he said you've got to be in the body to how these guilt he's talking about genuine gifts he's talking about true gifts these are true gifts of God these are true virtues they're the gifts of God that's the gifts he's talking about true gifts behind they say statue first man is that right he said the gifts without the virtues as a stumbling block that's his word come on going to the next back on the key to the door you believe into eternal life and are born-again by your faith jesus said in Saint John 5:24 he that heareth my work now watch him take this all the way back down to come back up what's it he that here at my words and believeth on him that sent have that sent me has everlasting life not the Holy Ghost just has everlasting life he's born into the family of God and then baptized with Holy Ghost with power of intelligence of faith to believe the gospel and put it to work and make it act act like a son of God you receive power by the Holy Ghost to do these things what about it come on let's read feist questions and answers now when you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you then how the new birth when you believe on the Lord you receive and you thought a new life but it isn't the baptism of the Holy Ghost see you got the new birth when you believe you got eternal life it's a gift of God this gift to you through Sovereign Grace by accepting the gift that God is giving to you see he that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath eternal life has everlasting life that's the new birth you're converted it means you've turned around but the baptism of the Holy Spirit puts you into the body of Christ subject to the gifts for service now what's this it doesn't make the baptism of the Holy Spirit watching doesn't make you any more of a Christian the baptism in the Holy Spirit don't make you no more of a Christian what is it it just puts you into the body of gifts and once you you have to be baptized into the body to possess one of these gifts they tell my genuine true ain't just give some college without repenting come on roll it up let's give you another one what we got this in this countdown and the new birth if people talks that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is the new birth now that's wrong he said explain he said that's wrong the baptism of the Holy Ghost is different from the new birth the new birth is when you're born again with the Holy Ghost is when power comes into that birth for service you shall receive power after the Holy Ghost is come upon you these are the things to be added after the Holy Ghost comes upon you what about it Church the new birth you have the new birth by believing by being believing on the Lord Jesus Christ see by having faith and accepting him as your Savior that's birth see because you passed from death unto life now I wanted to talk to you don't talk about son 5 here's my words and all the Holy Ghost is power for service so when you talk about you've got to be born again and applying that to the Holy Ghost many of the Methodists they believe it this way they believe see he's taking what everybody else is believing about many were ensuing you what they're believing but it won't work all right what do we got that's 17 go ahead I read these Wednesday night but now I want to read these couple of words that they'll be with this this is off the message blasphemous ninth reason 62 and I believe the reason that there is so much confusion today about the Holy Spirit it's not correctly taught you can see what I'm just saying because the quotes I read to you would be quote used against what he had said in the beginning of what it was now what's what he says I believe the baptism is taught and just say the baptism but there's a lot goes with it you know go spark plugs and light when you talk about the baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot goes with that there's a lot goes with that and here is what I think that God has proven he's proving the Holy Spirit is here alright now watch him hold that back down I don't want you to read it okay cuz we're gonna get into the statue of a perfect man with this one alright watch it now roll it up and let's get it this is from blasphemy that's not he talking about patience and testing them we're only added virtue or knowledge temperance he's up to temperance watching I still ain't got to wholly go that's what you've no holy ghost people used to prove that point there's a quote from brother Branham what's he sayin he's talk truth statue of a perfect man and blasphemy is not both that the new birth is is the eternal life and bringing you in the body of Christ why is he saying I ain't got to hold together exactly right me and you could be right here at patience and I could say brothers and sisters were born again into the family of God we're under Paul's message of the the tutor and the razor and he's to bring in us and we've come to here between got the Holy Ghost yet well you mean we got to wholly go here we ain't got the headstone yet we ain't got where he said the Holy Spirit which is the faith of the father's right no problem with him Sammy ain't got to hold egos you okay so let's go Henry what's this one now it's a birth I've been birthed into this count them into this into this into this into this and into this and there and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that up in me for service seven verse you know how 7 you birth but a birth means it coming forth into a birth of the word coming forth into you understand what I'm trying to say for a second Paul was teaching adoption that's what God brought to him to bring there's one stage of it going to prove it Peter was teaching the stature of a perfect man they were teaching the same time Paul said you're born as a baby then you get a tutor when you come up in your life all right and then that tutor teaches you and then the father adopts you into the family but he said you were just as much a child when he was born as you'll ever be he said your inheritance was the same on the difference was the growth development or the leadership what is Peter and then when it finishes out then he gives you the authority to write the check book he gives you puts it all into your hands what is Peter talking about add to your faith get born again in our faith add to your faith virtue and knowledge different place coming out to where the disciples were on the Holy Spirit letter and said they had I'm looking at yesterday they had these virtues but they didn't have that headstone that's what he says that's why I've always said it I've said this from day one everybody in the world 7 billion people could have the faith of the father's be a wonderful world to live in but that is not the change of the body that is not the headstone for the church that's the faith of the father's you don't hear that talk among the people is imagine we don't need to fight the father's we were up here where we're willing about faith of fathers how did you get there then brother mo tall stature a perfect man 1960 I mean 1971 I was all asking we believe it accept it now how do we get it how do we get to virtues come on how do we get to virtue it's through the opening of the word that God revealed his word to us will take us up the statue of a perfect plan there's no other way of getting there it's not beating each other and we'll get patience it's through a growth development of the same thing Paul was explaining of the tutor tutor trial training the child to bring it to a place to be able to trust it same fine and they concluded it with at one time 327 Church age book this messenger Malachi 4 will do two things one turn the hearts of the children back to the faith of the father to reveal the thunders which is a revelation contained in the seven seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turn our hearts back so if you want to be turned back to the face of the Father why have we turned down the seals words the people of this message preaching seals now I didn't like the statement you know cause to me brother Dale I don't like what you said why don't you tell from Adam you don't like it he was the one that said it he said these though it'll be these divinely revealed literally the revealed truths that literally turned our heart literally these teachers will tell you the word literally means what word by word word by word complete how you gonna complete the statue of a perfect man through the opening of God's Word but how many people would even read a sealed book no wonder we're here fifty years but you see Church gonna renovate a statement one time that was outstanding to me he said it would be a greater thing if everybody understood the oneness of the Godhead you remember that if everybody understood the oneness of the Godhead so they can't be to lower they can't be to this they can't me to that and come out to the right time it all comes to the breath to the point Paul and Peter was saying the same thing Paul tells you what you've got to do Peter tells you how to do it think on these things home uses think on these things revelation brings restoration but that see that's the point that I said want to go when you say you've got to have a revelation to be born again well what what do I need to how reveal to me really you need the fact of knowing that you lost that's number one and number two is the fact that you've accepted Jesus Christ as your Savior that's two pretty good revelations well that's what the whole world is based on Revelation Jesus Christ let's Dan what are we got really anybody have a need the olders Oh course we'll go in now the Lord willing I don't know which one statue of a perfect man are the adoption all stages so study from that point I ask you to at least read Galatians three and four it will help you to understand there is ad optional message this number there's four of them involved in one book of adoption anything on hearing him adoption statue of perfect man black name is night or we go ah [Music] [Music] [Music] ha ah [Music] thank you Jesus thank you you're loving [Music] you love these words see his word is right before and the after proves what the middle of what you're saying hey
