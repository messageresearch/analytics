[0:00] Honor
[0:12] of God and help families, brothers and
[0:16] sisters and children and people and
[0:18] hearts and souls
[0:21] distressed. Father, may you give up.
[0:45] Amen. I tell you if if if if
[0:49] you were there at the uh funeral service
[0:51] for my sister Sharon, I spoke about
[0:53] getting out of your comfort zone. Do
[0:55] something different. You know, share the
[0:57] experience. And I tell you, it's a
[0:59] blessing. God will work in your life. Um
[1:02] I've seen brother Dell do that many
[1:04] times. And um you know, we're here as a
[1:06] servant's heart and that's what we do.
[1:09] Love one another, love God's people,
[1:12] live for each other. And I tell you,
[1:14] there's a blessing and a gratitude in
[1:15] that. Amen. Let's um let's sing that
[1:18] song. He's the Lord of glory.
[1:21] I actually think I got Brother Wade when
[1:22] we ordained him here. I said, uh he came
[1:25] and took up the offering, too. I
[1:26] remember that. That was that was an
[1:28] experience.
[1:30] Amen.
[1:31] Oh behold, what manner of man is this
[1:35] who steals the rage and see? He heals
[1:39] the sick, the lame, the halt, and makes
[1:42] the blind to see. He opens all the
[1:46] prison doors and sets the captive free.
[1:50] Behold, what manner of man is his? What
[1:53] manner of man is he? He's the Lord of
[1:57] glory. He is the great I am, the alpha
[2:02] and omega, the beginning and the end.
[2:07] His name is wonderful, the prince of
[2:11] peace is he. He's the everlasting
[2:15] father.
[2:16] How eternity
[2:19] and behold what manner of man is to heal
[2:23] the lame in all said be forgiven thee.
[2:28] Take up thy bed and wall. He stands as a
[2:32] mighty healer now come unto me. Behold
[2:37] what men from man.
[2:40] Hallelujah. Oh, he's the Lord of glory.
[2:45] He is the great I am. The alpha and
[2:50] omega, the beginning and the end. His
[2:54] name is wonderful. The prince of peace
[2:58] is he. He's the everlasting father.
[3:03] Let's sing that first verse again.
[3:06] Behold, what better a man is this who
[3:09] seals the right to see. He he kills the
[3:12] sick, the lame, the hawk, makes the
[3:15] blind to see. He opens all the prison
[3:21] sets the captive free. Behold what
[3:24] manner of man it is. What manner of man
[3:28] is he? He's the Lord of glory. He is the
[3:33] great I am. The alpha and omega, the
[3:38] beginning and the end. His name is
[3:43] wonderful. The prince of peace is he.
[3:47] He's the everlasting father. Oh, sing
[3:50] that chorus again. Oh, he's the lord of
[3:55] glory. He is the great I am, the alpha
[4:00] and omega, the beginning and the end.
[4:04] His name is wonderful, the prince of
[4:08] peace is he. He's the everlasting father
[4:14] throughout eternity.
[4:19] Hallelujah.
[4:21] Oh, be it unto me
[4:27] according
[4:29] to your word,
[4:34] according to
[4:37] your promises.
[4:40] I can stand
[4:43] secure
[4:46] and carve upon my heart
[4:52] the truth that sets me free
[4:58] according to your word. Dear Lord,
[5:05] be it. Oh, let it be a prayer for this
[5:08] evening. Go and be it unto me
[5:16] accord unto your word.
[5:22] Accord unto
[5:25] your promises
[5:29] I can stand
[5:31] secure
[5:34] and guard upon my heart.
[5:40] The truth that sets me free
[5:46] accord unto your word. Dear Lord
[5:52] be it. Let's all stand as brother Aaron
[5:55] comes.
[5:57] Oh be it unto me.
[6:04] According to your word,
[6:10] according to your promises,
[6:16] I can sense
[6:18] your word
[6:21] and cover upon my heart
[6:27] the truth that set me free.
[6:33] Lord, enter your word, dear Lord,
[6:39] be it unto me.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. How many can say that tonight? Be
[6:48] it unto me according to thy word.
[6:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. Good to see each
[6:53] one of you tonight in the house of the
[6:54] Lord. And uh we just pray that Brother
[6:58] Wade and Brother Danny have a good time
[7:00] and the Lord blesses them while they're
[7:02] there. And uh good to have brother
[7:05] Marcus with us tonight.
[7:07] &gt;&gt; And we always appreciate brother Marcus
[7:08] coming and and being with us here.
[7:11] &gt;&gt; And like everybody said, we just love
[7:14] brother Marcus has a real heart and
[7:17] servant's heart. And I get to I don't
[7:21] remember what country it was, but he was
[7:23] there and he was preaching to the young
[7:24] people and then he had questions and
[7:26] answers. And uh he does questions and
[7:28] answers kind of like I do.
[7:30] They ask you questions, then you ask
[7:32] them questions.
[7:34] But it was really, really good and it
[7:36] just really blessed my heart and uh
[7:39] every time we've heard brother Mark his
[7:41] minister, he's always been just a
[7:42] blessing to us and we always appreciate
[7:44] him taking the time to come be with us
[7:46] and uh looking forward to what the Lord
[7:49] has for us tonight. Amen. So as brother
[7:52] Marcus comes tonight, let's sing. Word
[7:54] of God ever true. Changing me, changing
[7:58] words
[8:00] long reserved
[8:02] for our
[8:06] world.
[8:08] They resound
[8:10] with God's own heart. Oh, let the word
[8:14] of God in our
[8:18] words of life.
[8:21] Words of hope.
[8:23] Give us strength.
[8:26] It builds us home.
[8:29] In this word, wherever we roll, the word
[8:34] of God will guide us all.
[8:39] Word of God.
[8:42] True.
[8:49] We have come with heart for your word of
[8:56] God is far in holy words
[9:02] of our faith.
[9:04] Handed down
[9:07] to this day
[9:10] to us through sacrifice.
[9:15] The faithful words of Christ and holy
[9:20] words
[9:22] don't reserve
[9:25] for all
[9:27] in this world.
[9:34] Oh let the word of God.
[9:39] The word of God
[9:42] ever
[9:44] is changing me
[9:47] and changing you.
[9:50] We have come with open heart. Oh, let
[9:55] the word of God.
[10:01] &gt;&gt; Now, while the music is softly playing,
[10:03] let's bow our heads again. Heavenly
[10:05] Father, we thank you for these wonderful
[10:06] songs. May you speak to us this evening.
[10:11] May you especially encourage those who
[10:13] stand in their own way. Father, those
[10:16] who are giving up a little bit, Father,
[10:19] those who blame themsel and blame
[10:22] themselves. May you just encourage them,
[10:25] Father, to understand we have a father.
[10:29] We have a heavenly father and who takes
[10:32] care of us who is nearer when we forget
[10:36] ourself.
[10:38] Our father never forgets us. Father, may
[10:41] you bring it very dear and very close to
[10:43] our hearts this evening. Bless our most
[10:46] noble pastor Wade. Father, protect him
[10:49] on his trip. Father, bring him safe back
[10:51] home. Bless the church back home,
[10:53] Father. Bless the bride in the US,
[10:56] Father. And definitely, Father, may you
[10:58] bless Israel because those who bless
[11:00] Israel, they are blessed already,
[11:02] Father. So, we thank you for this time
[11:05] of fellowship. Ask it in the name of the
[11:07] Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. And amen.
[11:12] God bless you all. And I really thank
[11:14] the musician, Brother Joe. Thank you
[11:16] very much, my precious brothers. And
[11:18] while we're standing, let's open the
[11:20] word of the Lord
[11:22] &gt;&gt; in the book of Matthew.
[11:29] Matthew 25
[11:34] 15 the book of and it's the very known
[11:37] parable of the talents
[11:41] Matthew 25:15
[11:45] he says and unto one he gave five
[11:48] talents
[11:50] to another two and to another one and
[11:53] please keep that sentence in your mind
[11:55] and to everyone every man according to
[11:58] his several ability and straight away
[12:03] took his journey
[12:05] and in verse 24
[12:09] we see the reaction of one of those 254
[12:14] and he which have received one talent
[12:17] came and said Lord I knew thee and that
[12:20] thou art a hard man reaping where thou
[12:24] hast not sown and gathering where thou
[12:27] hast not stra and I was afraid and went
[12:31] and hid thy talent in the earth. Lo,
[12:33] there thou hast that is thine. And let
[12:37] us read in the book of Revelation
[12:40] chapter 3 verse 17.
[12:45] Revelation 3:1 17. Because thou sayest,
[12:50] I am rich and increased with goods and
[12:53] have need of nothing and knowest not
[12:57] that thou are wretched and miserable and
[12:59] poor and blind and naked and so on. May
[13:03] the Lord add his blessing to the reading
[13:05] of his word. We may be seated. And I
[13:08] think it's fine for you if I put off
[13:10] directly my jacket.
[13:12] &gt;&gt; I I Yeah. Now I I really greet you in
[13:16] the house of the Lord. It's a great
[13:17] honor for me to be here and uh I told
[13:21] brother we will be in the area because
[13:23] we have a another project that we are
[13:26] discussing and so he invited me for this
[13:28] evening and um that is always for me a
[13:31] great honor great respect. I still
[13:34] remember the the time of of the father
[13:36] brother Dale we we we we consider him to
[13:40] be a most noble gentleman. You know that
[13:42] is how we really keep the man in our
[13:44] hearts. A really a really of a father
[13:47] you know a really a really a gentleman
[13:49] and we wished we would have more people
[13:52] like this in this message you know that
[13:54] kind of a caliber that kind of behavior
[13:56] of attitude and and the same for our
[13:59] most brother Wade and if he's listening
[14:01] later to the table greet him very warmly
[14:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. I
[14:06] bring greetings from our local church
[14:08] back in home in in in Germany and uh
[14:12] really we we feel really connected with
[14:14] you. It's it's it's a little bit for me
[14:17] feeling at home. In Germany we have a
[14:19] slogan which says feel at home but be
[14:21] don't behave like that. Okay. In other
[14:24] words, don't put the feet on the table
[14:26] and I will not do this. I'm a I'm a
[14:28] traveler myself and uh and if you travel
[14:31] you learn to respect people you know you
[14:33] learn to respect churches and so forth
[14:35] and and uh so that is exactly and and by
[14:38] the way we became a little bit older of
[14:40] really uh choosing our words right and
[14:44] um so I'm I'm really happy to be with
[14:47] you and uh I'm um yeah tomorrow very
[14:50] early I'm I'm leaving already um and so
[14:54] this will be a short time but really I
[14:56] thanks for for for my host, brother
[14:58] Luis, uh where I'm the family. God bless
[15:00] you all, brother Joe Canada, the whole
[15:02] dream team together. We had really a
[15:04] wonderful time and so really a pleasure.
[15:07] Thanks for the nice words of
[15:08] compliments. And if if if you wouldn't
[15:11] mind, I'd enter directly into a subject.
[15:13] Yeah, because I'm I I I I I I'm not a
[15:16] long preacher, but I need I have to my
[15:19] time to really uh uh develop a little
[15:22] subject and I know it's a Wednesday and
[15:24] so I'm directly entering into into the
[15:26] subject and I would like to entire I
[15:29] have no notes but as usually I always
[15:31] have some some pictures and some quotes
[15:35] and that gives me always a certain uh
[15:38] red red line to follow. Okay. And I
[15:42] would love to to now to to deal with
[15:45] that subject according to the
[15:47] understanding of the message. Now,
[15:50] brother Brandon makes a certain quote.
[15:53] He says, "The Bible has become a new
[15:55] book."
[15:56] And I remember that that uh that when I
[16:00] was young, we had in in German classes,
[16:03] we had to do analysis
[16:06] of uh German poetry. Okay? uh you would
[16:10] take for example a a a a a book of
[16:13] Shakespeare for example it's not German
[16:15] but English okay and then the question
[16:17] is what was the intention of the writer
[16:20] and and I want to want to be honest with
[16:22] you I did not understand anything any I
[16:25] have always bad marks
[16:27] yeah and and one time I thought why
[16:29] don't you ask the writer yourself I
[16:30] didn't write that thing you know was got
[16:32] a bit nervous and when my daughter was
[16:35] in school uh one night I couldn't sleep
[16:38] and And I and I and I found a novel
[16:41] exactly the same novel that she went
[16:44] through that I went through when I was a
[16:46] child now 30 years later
[16:50] and when I read that novel it became
[16:52] everything became clear it was it was it
[16:55] was obvious things that I didn't
[16:57] understand and so I understood the book
[17:00] was the same but the reader changed.
[17:05] Do you understand when brother said this
[17:08] Bible has become a new book? It's the
[17:10] same book, but the ones who read it,
[17:12] they read it now different.
[17:15] &gt;&gt; Because this is the time of maturity.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; We are not babies anymore.
[17:21] &gt;&gt; I mean, God will not rapture a a
[17:23] teenager
[17:25] &gt;&gt; or a baby. God will rapture uh people
[17:28] who came into a certain maturity.
[17:32] So therefore I repeat what I always say
[17:36] this
[17:37] the message that we believe does not
[17:40] come from America.
[17:43] &gt;&gt; It comes from the presence of God.
[17:45] &gt;&gt; It's not an American message.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; It's not brother Brandham's message.
[17:50] &gt;&gt; It's God's message.
[17:52] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham was just a voice.
[17:54] &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a
[17:57] cult. Right.
[17:59] &gt;&gt; Why should I become cultish?
[18:02] &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a a
[18:04] sect. Why should I become sectarian?
[18:08] &gt;&gt; The message that we believe is not a
[18:10] denomination. Why should I become
[18:12] denominational? What's the point?
[18:14] &gt;&gt; You said, brother Marcus, what is the
[18:15] message of the hour? It's our father
[18:18] talking to us.
[18:20] &gt;&gt; The message is for the bride,
[18:22] &gt;&gt; for a special class of people. Brother
[18:25] calls them with prophetic insight. Amen.
[18:27] &gt;&gt; So we read the Bible today through the
[18:30] message of the hour and things become
[18:32] clearer and I hope I could clarify uh
[18:35] that that that that that parable
[18:38] according to the message and it helps us
[18:40] a lot. Okay. So I would like to call
[18:44] that sermon for today uh uh the right
[18:48] perception
[18:50] &gt;&gt; and the wrong perception.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; It will determine our actions.
[18:58] So you understand that uh that God
[19:02] speaks to Laudia
[19:05] and general to the church world in Laia
[19:11] and God tells the church world look you
[19:14] have a problem you're sick
[19:18] &gt;&gt; because your self-perception is that you
[19:21] don't need nothing
[19:23] &gt;&gt; right
[19:24] &gt;&gt; but if you only would know you need a
[19:26] heart
[19:27] &gt;&gt; we need the message of the hour now in
[19:29] my work I changed my work I'm since a
[19:33] couple of years I'm working in the
[19:34] integration
[19:36] integration of refugees I have to
[19:39] integrate them in German courses in uh
[19:44] learning the language
[19:46] and I'm taking care in our community
[19:49] what we call dysfunctional families
[19:53] &gt;&gt; and brother that the sign of a person
[19:56] who is sick, mentally sick, is that she
[20:01] ha he has the wrong perception of
[20:04] himself.
[20:06] &gt;&gt; A person who is mentally sick sick
[20:09] thinks that he is healthy.
[20:13] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you cannot help the person.
[20:14] You only can help a person when he
[20:17] understands I need help.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:19] &gt;&gt; And God tells this to a whole church
[20:21] what he said. You think you have
[20:23] everything
[20:24] &gt;&gt; and you don't know
[20:26] &gt;&gt; that you need the word of the Lord.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[20:28] &gt;&gt; So the self-perception,
[20:30] how we see our yourself and how we see
[20:33] God is so important. It will determine
[20:37] how you read the Bible.
[20:40] I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm dealing with a
[20:42] person uh in that integration and there
[20:45] my colleague, she's an unbeliever
[20:49] and she has in her district she has
[20:52] people that uh come from a Christian
[20:55] church uh mostly Ukrainians,
[20:59] Pentecostals or Baptists but very strong
[21:02] in their church.
[21:04] And she says, "Is Christianity helpful
[21:07] for a healthy
[21:09] uh let me say upbringing of people or
[21:12] upbringing of children or uh socializing
[21:17] people." I said everything depends on
[21:20] the picture of God that that church is
[21:23] painting.
[21:25] If you're painting a God who is always
[21:28] angry with us, who is never satisfied.
[21:33] In other words, whatever you do, you
[21:35] always feel wrong.
[21:37] &gt;&gt; You always feel it was not enough.
[21:40] &gt;&gt; You you and you have a picture of the
[21:41] Lord Jesus that he's standing there and
[21:44] he's hoping that you don't make the
[21:45] rapture.
[21:47] &gt;&gt; Then that religion is nothing else than
[21:49] toxic. Right?
[21:52] &gt;&gt; It is the reason how why people were so
[21:55] hard with and so strict with their
[21:57] children because they had that kind of a
[22:01] of a godly picture.
[22:03] But if you see God as a father,
[22:08] &gt;&gt; a one who loves you,
[22:10] &gt;&gt; the one who cares for you, the one who
[22:14] he he helps you to make the rapture,
[22:16] then you can sing the song, what a
[22:18] friend
[22:20] &gt;&gt; I have in Jesus.
[22:22] &gt;&gt; It depends on the perception of yourself
[22:25] and the perception of God. It can't be
[22:27] toxic
[22:28] &gt;&gt; or we can
[22:30] &gt;&gt; the the the I want to say this in all
[22:33] these years we didn't become more
[22:36] worldly. We kept our standard
[22:40] &gt;&gt; but
[22:41] we now observed what was religion
[22:45] and what was true revelation of God.
[22:49] When we were younger, I remember we want
[22:50] to be more holy than brother Brandham
[22:52] himself
[22:54] and we are not more worldly. But today,
[22:57] the older you get, the more you
[22:59] understand you cannot do anything
[23:01] without God.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Salvation even our children is not
[23:07] our business.
[23:09] &gt;&gt; God is the savior.
[23:12] &gt;&gt; No, we can only make a framework. Right?
[23:16] &gt;&gt; So, we talked this evening and it's so
[23:18] dear to my heart because look, if you
[23:21] deal with people, you must have an
[23:23] empathy for them.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; And I have a church of these refugees.
[23:29] They are all Muslims.
[23:32] &gt;&gt; I always call them, it's my church, but
[23:35] none of them has the Holy Ghost
[23:38] &gt;&gt; because no Muslim has the Holy Ghost.
[23:41] &gt;&gt; But remember this, these people have a
[23:43] soul. Amen.
[23:45] &gt;&gt; They have feelings.
[23:46] &gt;&gt; They are not sawdust.
[23:48] &gt;&gt; They're not just animals. They're not
[23:50] robots.
[23:51] &gt;&gt; They have a soul.
[23:53] &gt;&gt; They have a dignity in life. And brother
[23:56] Bam said, "Life is precious in the eyes
[23:59] of God."
[24:01] &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in respecting people.
[24:03] You're never wrong. Never. Bride is
[24:05] bright.
[24:07] &gt;&gt; But the rest is not nothing. They're
[24:10] people.
[24:11] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you see a a bump in the
[24:13] on the street, for us it's just a
[24:15] vagabond. It's just a bump. But never
[24:17] forget. I mean, for for his mama, that's
[24:20] her son.
[24:22] &gt;&gt; And maybe that man is the father of a
[24:25] little daughter.
[24:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. Life is precious in the eyes of
[24:29] God. You're never wrong in respecting
[24:31] people.
[24:32] &gt;&gt; Never wrong in helping, giving a helping
[24:34] hand.
[24:35] &gt;&gt; I remember when we were younger, we were
[24:37] so revelated, we couldn't even shake
[24:38] hands to somebody else.
[24:41] Amen. But the older we get, the more
[24:43] normal we become.
[24:44] &gt;&gt; He said because revelation comes from
[24:47] God.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; It was not our merit.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. So, so the second thing that I
[24:53] want to say this is is when we preach
[24:55] the message, we don't talk to colors.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; We talk to theophanes
[25:00] &gt;&gt; to the inner man.
[25:02] &gt;&gt; So, so there's no need to have an
[25:04] inferior complex or a superior complex.
[25:07] &gt;&gt; We don't talk to colors. We talk to the
[25:10] inner man
[25:11] &gt;&gt; and there's a connection between the
[25:13] soul and the theophony.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Definitely. So, so, so to make
[25:17] that thing on on on on the right thing.
[25:21] &gt;&gt; Now, please this afternoon uh this
[25:25] evening we make it must make an
[25:27] extinction. There's a difference when a
[25:29] person cannot
[25:32] and when a person will not.
[25:34] So what we heard when brother Brandon
[25:36] spoke about the judgment so forth that's
[25:38] for people who have received truth but
[25:42] they don't want.
[25:45] &gt;&gt; But there's a lot of people they want
[25:47] but they cannot.
[25:49] &gt;&gt; That's a difference.
[25:51] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between do not want
[25:53] or do he cannot.
[25:56] &gt;&gt; There's many people in the message they
[25:57] stand in their own way.
[25:59] &gt;&gt; They're good people. Sometime they leave
[26:01] even the church. Don't throw something
[26:03] behind them. If they are in the hands of
[26:06] God, God doesn't forget them.
[26:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you consecrated your children
[26:10] to the Lord, believe your own practice
[26:13] that you did.
[26:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because when we gave these
[26:16] children to the Lord, the babies, we
[26:17] told God, "Our hands one day will become
[26:19] too short." But your hands will never
[26:21] become too short.
[26:22] &gt;&gt; Believe your own prayer.
[26:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Definitely. So, so we are not talking
[26:26] about people this evening who will not
[26:30] but who cannot.
[26:33] &gt;&gt; There's times in your life where you
[26:35] don't need a doctrine. You need a
[26:37] father.
[26:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's not sufficient. We have some
[26:41] brother Brandon pictures at our wall. We
[26:42] need a reality.
[26:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. When when when when when when
[26:46] everything goes wrong in my life, I need
[26:48] a friend
[26:49] &gt;&gt; and my friend is my savior
[26:52] &gt;&gt; and my father is my bridegroom and my
[26:54] judge is my attorney. Amen. And my king
[26:57] is my is is my husband. Amen. All in
[27:00] all, therefore, the Bible says in
[27:02] Hebrew, Amen. He was not the one who is
[27:06] sanctified and the one who sanctifies
[27:08] both come from the same.
[27:10] &gt;&gt; Therefore, he's not ashamed to call us
[27:12] brothers.
[27:13] Amen.
[27:14] &gt;&gt; Because we come from the same family.
[27:16] Can you say amen so far?
[27:17] &gt;&gt; So let's help let's let's help a weak
[27:20] person. Lord laid it on my heart.
[27:22] Somebody must be weak here this evening
[27:24] or uh a little bit little bit doubting
[27:27] too much.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Okay. And God says don't doubt. It's not
[27:31] your strength. It will be my strength.
[27:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Salvation pertains to the Lord not
[27:36] to us.
[27:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. Please make the next one. I thank
[27:39] I think very much the the the the
[27:43] technicians.
[27:45] &gt;&gt; So you understand that brother Brandham
[27:48] says that the whole world will become uh
[27:52] mentally uh will have mental health
[27:55] issues will become crazy only those who
[27:58] have the Holy Ghost will be the only
[28:01] normal people on this earth.
[28:03] &gt;&gt; So let's understand where we come from.
[28:05] He said brother Bram said it's just like
[28:06] a little due drop. I don't know much
[28:08] about chemistry but it must be that the
[28:12] congelling of humidity on the stand or
[28:14] atmosphere and when it gets cold and
[28:16] dark it falls from heaven and drops upon
[28:18] the ground. It fell from somewhere. But
[28:22] the next morning before the sun come up,
[28:24] it lays there. The little fellow
[28:26] shivering. But just let the sun come up.
[28:28] Watch it go. The sun come up. It's
[28:30] laying there shining. It's happy. Why?
[28:32] The sun is going to caught it right back
[28:35] to where it come from.
[28:38] &gt;&gt; And that's the way with a Christian.
[28:39] Hallelujah. We know when we walk in the
[28:42] presence of God, something in us tell us
[28:44] that we come from somewhere. And we are
[28:46] going back again by that power that is
[28:49] pulling us.
[28:50] &gt;&gt; The little dew drop. It glistens and
[28:52] shines and shouts because because he
[28:54] knows he come from there. And the sun is
[28:56] going to draw him right back again. And
[28:58] a man that's an attribute of God born of
[29:01] God knows hallelujah. When he come in
[29:03] contact with the son of God, he's going
[29:05] to be draw up from here someday.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:10] &gt;&gt; So you must understand
[29:13] your destiny is your origin. That's
[29:16] right.
[29:17] &gt;&gt; Nobody can preach you into the bride.
[29:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:21] &gt;&gt; Because the bride came out of his bosom.
[29:25] &gt;&gt; As Eve was in Adam,
[29:28] &gt;&gt; the bride was in Christ.
[29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. I mean, and I always did that kind
[29:33] of of of illustration. I said when when
[29:36] when the bride was in in in in in Christ
[29:39] on Calvary then the bride must have been
[29:42] in Melzdc.
[29:44] &gt;&gt; In what form ever?
[29:45] &gt;&gt; In what form ever? I cannot explain.
[29:48] Amen. And if the bride was in Melzdc and
[29:50] the bride was in the pillar of fire.
[29:52] &gt;&gt; And when the bride was in the pillar of
[29:54] fire, the bride was in God.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:57] &gt;&gt; Therefore, brother Brandon was the first
[29:59] messenger. He said, "God is not anymore
[30:02] complete without you."
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. Right?
[30:05] &gt;&gt; Because when you were born, God put part
[30:07] of himself into your soul. And David
[30:10] said in the Psalms, he said God made
[30:13] everything fine in his time. He even
[30:15] placed eternity into our hearts. And
[30:17] there's only one who is eternal. That's
[30:19] God.
[30:21] &gt;&gt; There's a difference between the bride
[30:23] and the church.
[30:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. There's still time to say,
[30:26] "Whosoever want, let him come."
[30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. But if you were not in his mind,
[30:33] in his thinking, right? in the
[30:34] beginning. Nobody can join the bride.
[30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:39] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[30:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everybody who was in him will be
[30:43] there.
[30:44] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said, "Before the
[30:46] foundation of the world, God made a
[30:47] picture of us." Quote, "Brother Brandon,
[30:49] &gt;&gt; and I always say it like this." Now,
[30:51] here's the family of God. And here we
[30:52] were.
[30:55] &gt;&gt; I mean, brother, once you understand who
[30:57] you are, there's no need to become
[30:58] arrogant.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Arrogance is a sign of an unsecured
[31:02] person. And revelation drives all fear
[31:05] out.
[31:07] &gt;&gt; Revelation and loves goes together.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:09] &gt;&gt; So, so God took our souls for for and
[31:12] took the family took our soul and
[31:14] throwed it into seven church ages on
[31:16] seven continents. But he put place part
[31:19] of himself he put into us. So when the
[31:22] word came for their age there was a
[31:24] receiver that we could answer.
[31:26] &gt;&gt; When we gave our heart to the Lord Jesus
[31:28] it was not our intellect. It was our
[31:30] attribute answering to that call.
[31:33] Salvation is supernatural. You cannot
[31:36] train your children into it. God has to
[31:38] call them whenever he wants.
[31:41] &gt;&gt; Nobody tells God what to do and when to
[31:43] do and what to do.
[31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. And when seven church age over,
[31:46] the whole family will be will be there.
[31:49] &gt;&gt; Nobody is missing.
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Nobody is missing. Therefore, you are
[31:54] not in the message because of William
[31:56] Brandham.
[31:57] &gt;&gt; You were there before.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; You were there before. You were already
[32:01] children of God in the mind of God. And
[32:03] God had to send a messenger because he
[32:05] had to pass by Samaria.
[32:08] &gt;&gt; And as your part of the word was in you,
[32:10] God needed a prophet to to just call you
[32:14] by that voice.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[32:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. The great person in our generation
[32:19] is not William Brandon. The great person
[32:20] is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[32:23] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Please, please make the next
[32:28] one. So we understand. Here's what
[32:30] brother Brandon said. You can say,
[32:32] "Brother Marcus, if psychology is not,
[32:35] God understands life."
[32:38] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[32:39] &gt;&gt; God is the engineer of life.
[32:44] &gt;&gt; God understands a human being.
[32:47] &gt;&gt; Please understand, God understands our
[32:50] children better than we understand them.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Please understand, God knows us better
[32:57] than we know ourselves.
[33:00] Amen. And here brother Ramos he speaks
[33:02] about a shock or or spiritual amnesia
[33:06] and we know when he talked about the
[33:08] people from World War I brother Brham
[33:11] said now amnesia we are told it's caused
[33:15] uh caused to be at a place where you
[33:17] cannot identify yourself. Now it's an
[33:20] unusual thing. It don't happen too often
[33:22] but it's caused from a shock. It's
[33:25] somebody that you don't even know who
[33:27] you are. They find out from war from
[33:30] war. Sometimes soldiers get it. Sometime
[33:32] people get it. Another thing causes is
[33:35] worry. Worry will cause it. Worry has no
[33:39] virtue at all.
[33:42] &gt;&gt; Worry has no virtue at all. The third
[33:45] thing now worry sometime cause it.
[33:47] Another thing that cause it is among the
[33:49] people is getting between two opinions.
[33:52] That will cause amnesia.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore, we tell the young
[33:58] people, you cannot stream everything.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; One preaches that and one preaches that.
[34:03] You have a pastor.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; He has a reason. He's the gate.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Right.
[34:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. You cannot just stream because one
[34:11] says this and the more you stream, the
[34:12] more confused you become.
[34:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Exactly. So, amen. Amen. Two
[34:18] opinions and you become you you get an
[34:20] amnesia. But look at this. Amen. Now we
[34:24] came from God and and and please
[34:26] understand that I cannot explain
[34:27] everything uh not the person Marcus
[34:30] Beckov was had a predestination but the
[34:32] word in me let me say it like this okay
[34:35] I mean in that sense okay please
[34:37] understand I have to have a red line and
[34:39] and there's a lot of aspects that I'm
[34:40] not touching it's not that sermon
[34:42] doesn't have all the balance it cannot
[34:44] be okay please understand okay so so we
[34:49] were in the mind of God somehow
[34:52] we were that kind of people where God
[34:54] says to Job, "Where were you men?"
[34:57] &gt;&gt; When the sons of God were shouting for
[34:59] joy,
[35:00] &gt;&gt; where were you? Amen. Amen. We can say,
[35:02] "In you, in you, Christ."
[35:05] &gt;&gt; But we came on earth and we didn't come
[35:08] like Adam.
[35:09] &gt;&gt; Please understand when Adam came on
[35:11] earth, he didn't come as a baby. He was
[35:12] an adult.
[35:15] &gt;&gt; Eve was an adult.
[35:16] &gt;&gt; But we don't come as an adult.
[35:19] &gt;&gt; We wanted to come directly in our
[35:21] theophony. Yeah.
[35:22] &gt;&gt; And we landed in Georgia.
[35:26] &gt;&gt; Nobody when you were born, nobody asked
[35:28] you want to be black or white.
[35:30] &gt;&gt; Nobody asked you. You want to be male or
[35:31] female? Nobody asked you. You You
[35:34] couldn't choose your father. You
[35:35] couldn't choose your mother.
[35:37] &gt;&gt; If we could have chosen where everybody
[35:39] want to be part of Rockefellers,
[35:42] you understand? You couldn't choose your
[35:44] out your outbringing. Okay. But there's
[35:47] but but but God choose you because
[35:49] brother Bam said God pre-planned your
[35:51] birth
[35:52] &gt;&gt; for many generation. The message thinks
[35:54] it out to be
[35:56] &gt;&gt; okay. So you live in a body that you
[35:58] don't like.
[36:00] &gt;&gt; You wake up in the morning. You go
[36:01] before the mirror and said I don't I
[36:03] don't know you but I wash you anyhow.
[36:07] You come in family situate brother. I
[36:09] come from a broken family. And that's
[36:12] what I always preach. I I saw my father
[36:14] beating my mother. She was green and
[36:16] blue. You know, I received the baptism
[36:18] of the Holy Ghost, but these pictures
[36:19] are still in my mind.
[36:21] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Holy Ghost does
[36:23] not clean up your subconscious.
[36:25] &gt;&gt; Forget it.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. We were Pentecostals before. We
[36:29] were thinking, "No, no, no." But this
[36:30] message balance us out.
[36:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. That we have a soul, a spirit, a
[36:35] human spirit, a holy spirit, and we have
[36:37] a body
[36:37] &gt;&gt; and we have genes and we have
[36:39] circumstances, we have an upbringing.
[36:40] All these things
[36:42] &gt;&gt; make the man who is sitting right before
[36:44] us.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:45] &gt;&gt; It definitely is. So,
[36:46] &gt;&gt; so we understand. So when we came on
[36:49] earth, Amen. We came through the birth
[36:51] channel.
[36:53] &gt;&gt; I was there at the birth of my daughter.
[36:54] I tell you one thing, my wife needed one
[36:58] midwife. I needed two. Honest.
[37:02] That was for a man that's too much. That
[37:04] that's too much.
[37:07] &gt;&gt; You see? So, so, so the baby comes on
[37:10] earth. The midwife takes a baby. The
[37:13] first thing that you got in life was a
[37:14] spanky.
[37:16] &gt;&gt; The midwife said, "You will get more in
[37:17] life." You will see.
[37:20] You see, but remember, brother Blam
[37:21] said, "A shock
[37:23] &gt;&gt; brings amnesia. Our birth was a shock."
[37:27] &gt;&gt; Was a shock. We didn't come like Adam.
[37:29] We didn't come in our theophony. We
[37:30] didn't come as adults. We came through a
[37:33] shock. And once we were born, we did not
[37:35] know from where we come from.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; That's right. Is that so?
[37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. But one thing, our father knew us.
[37:43] &gt;&gt; The little eagle did not know it was an
[37:45] eagle. But the mama eagle knew there is
[37:46] some part of me somewhere.
[37:49] &gt;&gt; I remember I mean I I was I was just I
[37:51] was just and I always make the same
[37:53] presentation, but this time I don't talk
[37:54] about Schwatzenegger, but I I I always
[37:57] tell my daughter. I always tell my
[37:59] daughter when I was a young teenager, I
[38:01] could dance like Michael Jackson. I
[38:03] could make the moonwalk.
[38:06] Today if I make it I have to go to the
[38:07] physiootherapist later.
[38:11] &gt;&gt; You understand? We we we we act like the
[38:14] world.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; We talk like the world. We want to be
[38:17] cool like the world.
[38:18] &gt;&gt; I remember I went through Hey chicks,
[38:20] how are you? Because we did not know who
[38:23] we were.
[38:24] &gt;&gt; And and and God was not ashamed of me
[38:27] because he knew one thing. Marcus is in
[38:29] time of ignorance.
[38:31] &gt;&gt; Amen. So never be ashamed of your
[38:33] unbelieving children. Don't be ashamed
[38:34] of them. God allows these things.
[38:37] &gt;&gt; He wants to see how we react on that
[38:39] life situation. These are challenges.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; Amen. Take them. Just give him a hug. I
[38:46] remember my little daughter, she was she
[38:49] was she was in kindergarten. And when
[38:51] the children are small, they like when
[38:53] daddy brings them to to uh to school or
[38:56] to kindergarten. Okay. But the older
[38:58] they get, at a certain moment, they
[39:01] said, "Okay, like a like a hundred yard
[39:03] before school. They said, "Oh, you can
[39:05] stop here,
[39:07] &gt;&gt; but it's raining." No, it's it's it's
[39:08] fine. And the older they get, the
[39:11] distance becomes bigger
[39:13] &gt;&gt; because it's not cool, you know, anymore
[39:14] if if the parents bring you.
[39:17] &gt;&gt; But I remember this and my daughter was
[39:19] with all the children in kindergarten.
[39:21] And I passed by as father and before all
[39:23] the children, she stood up. She said,
[39:25] "Hello, daddy." And I thought by myself,
[39:28] "The little one is not ashamed of me. I
[39:30] will never be ashamed of her."
[39:33] I told my I I told my little one, I
[39:35] said, "Honey, pap daddy and mama is
[39:37] always praying for you. But if you leave
[39:39] the message or if you leave
[39:41] Christianity, you become a Muslim.
[39:43] That's up to you. It's your life.
[39:45] &gt;&gt; But never forget, you will always be
[39:47] daddy's friend."
[39:49] &gt;&gt; You are not ashamed of me. I'm not
[39:51] ashamed of you. I pray that you find the
[39:53] way.
[39:54] &gt;&gt; But that love must be unconditional.
[39:57] &gt;&gt; I mean, it's not if you if you bring
[39:59] honor to the family. I mean God did not
[40:01] deal with me like this.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Do you understand that?
[40:05] &gt;&gt; So he gave she gave her heart to the law
[40:08] but he took away all the pressure of
[40:10] trying to perform something.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; If you come to church daddy daddy loves
[40:14] you. If you don't come to church daddy
[40:16] must hate you. That's nonsense.
[40:18] &gt;&gt; I'm the lower they fall these children
[40:21] the more they need a friend in life.
[40:23] &gt;&gt; You're not helping people by insulting
[40:25] them.
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Give them a hand. Give him give him give
[40:29] him give him empathy. Give him give him
[40:30] give him give him give him away.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; He said I I don't agree with your
[40:35] lifestyle but one thing is sure. You
[40:37] have a friend and that's your daddy and
[40:38] that's your mother.
[40:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of it. But
[40:42] that's that that's the way how God was
[40:43] with us.
[40:44] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:46] &gt;&gt; So please make the next one. So we came
[40:48] on earth and we didn't know who we were.
[40:51] So please understand one thing. That's
[40:53] what the Bible says in second Timothy.
[40:56] For men shall be lovers of themselves,
[40:59] conveters, boasters, proud, blasphemers,
[41:01] disobedient, parents, unthankful,
[41:04] unholy. And look what the Bible says,
[41:06] without natural affections.
[41:09] &gt;&gt; Please understand one thing. When I was
[41:11] younger, I was reading it like this.
[41:13] These people outside are monsters. But
[41:15] they're not monsters. They are victims
[41:17] of a society.
[41:19] &gt;&gt; And this is a sick society. We must
[41:22] understand this. And a sick generation
[41:24] will produce a sicker generation.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; Do you understand this? And the answer
[41:29] for a sick generation is healthy
[41:31] families.
[41:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Is healthy churches is warmness.
[41:38] Is the Holy Ghost is understanding is a
[41:41] is an anchor that when everything goes
[41:44] wrong, you know one thing, I have a
[41:46] father.
[41:47] &gt;&gt; I have a natural father and I have a
[41:50] spiritual father. Amen.
[41:52] &gt;&gt; Have you ever thought about that that
[41:54] that that that that
[41:57] scripture and I I so much love it. Here
[42:00] is the prodigal son and it was his
[42:02] mistake. I mean there's there there is
[42:05] no no second thought about that.
[42:07] &gt;&gt; It was his mistake.
[42:10] &gt;&gt; It it was his his decision.
[42:12] &gt;&gt; Okay. But at a certain moment the the
[42:16] miracle starts. The Bible says the boy
[42:19] came to himself.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; That was God.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; Amen. It wasn't a deacon. Nobody came
[42:26] by.
[42:27] &gt;&gt; But God spoke to that boy and the boy
[42:29] came to himself.
[42:31] &gt;&gt; People say sometime today, where are the
[42:33] miracles in our church? I tell you one
[42:35] thing, we are the miracles.
[42:37] &gt;&gt; We are the miracle. What God did in our
[42:39] life? That's the greatest miracle that
[42:40] there is.
[42:42] &gt;&gt; We are the miracle.
[42:46] And remember the first revelation that
[42:48] the boy has. I have a father.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say I have a brother Brandon.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; He doesn't say I have a No. No. He says
[42:57] I have a father
[42:59] &gt;&gt; and and my father is a great man
[43:02] &gt;&gt; brother. And if if if if if everything
[43:05] goes wrong in our life and we remember
[43:08] one thing, I made a lot of mistakes and
[43:10] they are all my fault. But I have a
[43:12] father. That's right.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; The message, the coming of William
[43:16] Brandham is not bringing us a doctrine.
[43:19] &gt;&gt; Because for 2,000 years, we tried
[43:22] Pentecostalism and it never worked.
[43:25] &gt;&gt; We tried legalism and legalism is only
[43:27] good to frustrate people.
[43:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because you frustrate yourself,
[43:32] your children are frustrated, the
[43:33] pastor's frustrated, God is frustrated.
[43:36] Legalism serves to nothing. It's a dead
[43:39] end.
[43:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then we tried liberal liberal
[43:42] liberaliz liberalism doesn't work
[43:45] neither.
[43:46] &gt;&gt; Then we tried reformation but
[43:48] reformation never brought us to to to
[43:50] the capstone.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[43:52] &gt;&gt; I mean then we tried anti-reformation.
[43:55] Then we tried denominationalism.
[43:57] And God watched all these 2,000 years.
[44:00] He says, "Boys, I tell you one thing. In
[44:02] the days of the voice of the seventh
[44:04] angel, the mystery of God will be
[44:06] revealed. Amen.
[44:08] &gt;&gt; The mystery, not mysteries,
[44:11] &gt;&gt; but the mysteries. And today we read the
[44:13] Bible different because we understand
[44:15] God.
[44:16] &gt;&gt; Brother, we are the first generation who
[44:18] understands the writer of that Bible.
[44:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:22] &gt;&gt; We understand God better than Adam in
[44:24] the Garden of Eden because we know what
[44:26] it means to be lost.
[44:28] &gt;&gt; We know what it means when God picks you
[44:30] up.
[44:31] &gt;&gt; We know what it means when we cannot
[44:33] hold our religion, but our religion is
[44:34] now supporting us. Amen.
[44:36] &gt;&gt; We know what it means when we sing Jesus
[44:38] my redeemer. We know what that is.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[44:42] &gt;&gt; We know, brother and sister. I tell you
[44:44] one thing. We're the only people on this
[44:46] earth who doesn't have a religion. We
[44:48] have a father.
[44:50] &gt;&gt; Don't make that message to be a
[44:52] religion. This message is way more than
[44:53] long hair and long dress.
[44:55] &gt;&gt; This message is a relationship
[44:57] &gt;&gt; between the almighty God and his
[44:59] children.
[45:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[45:03] So we understand now we have now two
[45:05] good football players Mr. Beckenbar Mr.
[45:08] Folks
[45:09] &gt;&gt; and both were world champions in
[45:12] football both were very successful
[45:14] coaches but both were completely
[45:17] different in their personality
[45:20] but Mr. Beckenbball he when he was
[45:22] losing a match he said look
[45:26] next time we win where's the problem Mr.
[45:29] Folks, he was always trying to explain
[45:31] himself and you must understand the
[45:33] defenders made that problem and the
[45:35] midfield players they were not and the
[45:36] technical part. Next time we will change
[45:38] this. He was always trying to explain
[45:41] himself.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[45:42] &gt;&gt; And and and and people tried to find out
[45:45] where's the difference because the they
[45:47] had the same success
[45:49] and they found out the key is in the
[45:52] youth
[45:54] because Mr. Beckenbower comes from a
[45:56] wealthy family. His uncle was already a
[45:59] famous player. His father was a famous
[46:02] person. So he heard at home, "Boy, I
[46:05] tell you one thing, your name is
[46:07] Beckenbower."
[46:08] And you're always the best. You will
[46:10] find out. Okay? I don't talk about
[46:12] narcissism and so forth, but healthy
[46:16] personalities,
[46:17] &gt;&gt; right?
[46:18] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, Mr. Folks,
[46:21] he had no father and no mother.
[46:24] He was raised as a foster child. And
[46:27] they found out and they call it in
[46:29] science they call it the bonding
[46:33] &gt;&gt; between the parents and the child
[46:36] &gt;&gt; and how the first three years in a
[46:38] child's life is so important. It is
[46:41] forming the character of that boy.
[46:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. The love between the parents and
[46:47] the child will give that child such a
[46:50] personality that when the when when when
[46:53] the winds of life come they can they can
[46:55] they can survive.
[46:59] Did Jesus say give me a child four years
[47:02] we will form them for the rest of their
[47:04] lives.
[47:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Therefore amen they need father
[47:09] and they need mother.
[47:11] &gt;&gt; All these kind of patchwork things will
[47:13] never work. God ordained a good father
[47:15] and a good mother.
[47:17] &gt;&gt; They need both.
[47:19] &gt;&gt; I mean to make healthy persons.
[47:21] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:22] &gt;&gt; I I want to tell deals. I don't want to
[47:24] see my child only in church. I want to
[47:26] see my child happy
[47:30] &gt;&gt; happy serving the Lord.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Not having a religion. Happy for the
[47:34] Lord Jesus.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[47:37] &gt;&gt; Amen. So I thought by myself look if the
[47:41] bonding
[47:43] in the natural life between the parents
[47:45] and the children IS SO IMPORTANT WHAT
[47:48] ABOUT THE BONDING of father God to his
[47:50] children
[47:52] &gt;&gt; so important the self perception how we
[47:56] see God the beginning of the Welsh
[47:59] revival came in a in a Sunday school
[48:04] &gt;&gt; and the Sunday school it was not brother
[48:06] Evans he was later the prominent person
[48:09] but it started in a Sunday school
[48:12] and the Sunday school teacher asked the
[48:14] class it was 20 30 people he said what
[48:17] does the Lord Jesus mean to you and the
[48:20] first one stands up and he says the Lord
[48:22] Jesus he is the sal he's the savior of
[48:25] the earth he died at Calvary and uh he
[48:28] is he is this and he is this and the
[48:30] Sunday school teacher said I don't want
[48:32] to listen what you learned
[48:36] &gt;&gt; I want to listen what does he mean to
[48:38] you?
[48:39] &gt;&gt; I want to listen what you learned in
[48:41] Sunday school. And then a child, a girl
[48:44] stands up and she says, "I love the Lord
[48:47] Jesus with all my heart." And that is
[48:49] when the spirit fell down. That was the
[48:52] beginning of the Welch revival.
[48:55] &gt;&gt; God was so pleased.
[48:58] God is not searching Muslimic worship.
[49:02] &gt;&gt; God wants heart.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:04] &gt;&gt; God wants empathy. Amen.
[49:07] &gt;&gt; God is a loving God.
[49:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:11] &gt;&gt; He's not only asking obedience. Every
[49:14] Muslim can ask for obedience.
[49:16] &gt;&gt; God wants your heart,
[49:18] &gt;&gt; your soul.
[49:20] &gt;&gt; People say, "I give so much for the
[49:22] church." When God has your heart, he has
[49:24] your money.
[49:26] &gt;&gt; He has your time.
[49:27] &gt;&gt; He has your Amen. Can you say amen?
[49:29] Amen.
[49:31] &gt;&gt; So, so the bonding
[49:33] I'm so interested in my own family, my
[49:36] my little girl.
[49:38] You see, she's now married.
[49:42] And for me, it was so important for her
[49:45] not to transmit a doctrine.
[49:48] &gt;&gt; I don't have to place brother Brandham
[49:50] in her heart
[49:51] &gt;&gt; because brother Brandon never died for
[49:53] us.
[49:55] Amen. In all respect, I want to have for
[49:59] her a relationship with the eternal
[50:02] father
[50:03] &gt;&gt; because maybe brother brother, we tried
[50:05] our best as parents. We tried our best
[50:08] &gt;&gt; but our best was not good enough. Be
[50:10] honest with one another.
[50:12] &gt;&gt; Our best was not good enough.
[50:14] &gt;&gt; And maybe we failed as parents.
[50:16] &gt;&gt; But if I make a connection between her
[50:19] and the almighty God, I know she has a
[50:21] father who will never fail.
[50:23] Maybe her earthly father was was was a
[50:26] loser. That might be so. But the
[50:27] heavenly father is a winner.
[50:30] &gt;&gt; I tell you, if you need a friend in
[50:31] life, the Lord Jesus is the best friend
[50:33] that you can have.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; The love of our soul.
[50:38] &gt;&gt; Honest.
[50:39] Honest. Therefore, you you look the
[50:42] church age book, the last page. Brother
[50:44] Brham said, "I never build up a ministry
[50:46] in my own words to have a follow that
[50:48] people follow me, but I want to create a
[50:50] relationship between believers and the
[50:52] and and the living God."
[50:54] &gt;&gt; Here is here is a woman by the name of
[50:57] uh Joyce Meyer. Now, Joyce Meyer is a is
[51:00] a is a female preacher. Uh we had some
[51:04] fans of her and she is uh
[51:08] how she is.
[51:12] I mean bride is bride
[51:14] &gt;&gt; but please understand outside of bride
[51:16] there is something
[51:18] &gt;&gt; outside outside of the bride there is an
[51:20] economy of God
[51:22] &gt;&gt; bride is bride
[51:24] &gt;&gt; there's people who will get eternal life
[51:26] even at the white throne judgment
[51:29] &gt;&gt; they're not bride but they receive
[51:30] something
[51:32] &gt;&gt; amen so why amen so so as as wrong as
[51:35] she is as wrong as she is in her
[51:39] doctrine but do you know her Sorry,
[51:43] brother. She was she was abused by her
[51:45] own father, sexually abused. She
[51:47] understood her own father because her
[51:50] father came from World War II. So, he
[51:53] was traumatized.
[51:56] She he did not know how to handle women
[51:58] and family. He was abusing his own his
[52:00] own daughter.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; So, she ran away from home
[52:05] w living in the streets throwing her
[52:07] away all her life. And then she said
[52:09] this and the Lord Jesus came and found
[52:11] me
[52:13] and and and brought me back
[52:17] to my call it potential sometime I'm
[52:19] missing some words brought me back just
[52:21] in life and I became a a preacher very
[52:24] prominent she's filled stadiums
[52:27] &gt;&gt; amen
[52:28] even it's not in the message let let her
[52:30] be what she is
[52:32] &gt;&gt; she said the Lord Jesus came and and
[52:35] brought me back from the condition where
[52:37] he said she said He healed the scars of
[52:40] my soul. I saw by myself. If the Lord
[52:43] Jesus can do this in a denomination,
[52:45] what can he do in the message?
[52:48] &gt;&gt; If we have the right perspective, if God
[52:52] brings people back in denomination and
[52:54] heals them from scars, from traumatas,
[52:57] what can he do in our midst
[53:01] &gt;&gt; if we understand that God loves so much
[53:03] his children?
[53:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[53:05] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[53:07] So these people in the world, brother,
[53:09] you see the Hollywood stars, you see you
[53:11] see the girls and and and uh with with
[53:13] with all their things.
[53:17] Amen. It's it's it's it's a sign. The
[53:21] more a a woman I mean when we were
[53:23] younger, we were just blasting these
[53:24] jazzy belts and today we're not doing
[53:26] this
[53:28] &gt;&gt; because we're not helping people by just
[53:29] blasting.
[53:31] &gt;&gt; We're not helping them. But you must
[53:33] understand the more a person tries to uh
[53:37] upgrade the outside.
[53:39] &gt;&gt; Let me say it like this. The more she
[53:41] shows something is missing on the
[53:43] inside.
[53:44] &gt;&gt; Once you find your satisfying portion,
[53:46] you have everything to become happy.
[53:49] &gt;&gt; You understand? People are victims
[53:51] today.
[53:52] &gt;&gt; And we are not better than denomination.
[53:54] But God in his grace put part of himself
[53:57] into us
[53:58] &gt;&gt; so that we can say the deep calls to the
[54:01] deep. Yes.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[54:03] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:04] &gt;&gt; We are the only people who really can
[54:06] sing amazing grace.
[54:07] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[54:08] &gt;&gt; We can really say what a friend we have
[54:10] in Jesus.
[54:11] &gt;&gt; We can sing I have a father.
[54:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[54:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[54:16] &gt;&gt; So please make the next one. So we
[54:18] understand. I mean
[54:21] they found out again. I mean there's a
[54:24] sister and her baby.
[54:27] The first two years, three years in
[54:30] their life, they found out the the
[54:33] contact, the eye contact of the mother
[54:35] and her baby is so important. They made
[54:38] tests that they put the baby over over
[54:42] uh let me say a a a glass and down down
[54:47] under the glass there was nothing. So a
[54:48] baby would never crawl to the mother by
[54:52] fear. But they found out just by the eye
[54:55] contact
[54:56] of the mother, the baby loses all fear.
[55:02] &gt;&gt; How is our relationship to the Lord
[55:03] Jesus? Do we see him as a father who is
[55:06] always always angry with us? I mean, oh,
[55:10] do we have a friend,
[55:12] &gt;&gt; brother? Brother, we are in the message
[55:14] today and people are afraid of the of of
[55:15] the rapture. I said something is it
[55:18] seems that you have a problem, brother.
[55:20] &gt;&gt; You didn't understand the opening of the
[55:21] word. That's right.
[55:23] &gt;&gt; You have a problem. And people people
[55:25] think what what is Trump doing?
[55:26] Tremendous. No, no, no, no.
[55:30] &gt;&gt; It's unbelievable. No, no, no. Hey,
[55:34] we're not looking what Trump is doing in
[55:36] all respect.
[55:37] &gt;&gt; We're looking what the Lord Jesus is
[55:39] doing.
[55:40] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that you make the
[55:42] rapture because you have a father who
[55:43] takes care that you makes it?
[55:44] &gt;&gt; That's right. Yes.
[55:46] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that will never be
[55:48] your own strength
[55:51] &gt;&gt; to make it?
[55:53] &gt;&gt; But you have a father who came down.
[55:55] That is Revelation chapter 10.
[55:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. To help you to make it.
[56:01] &gt;&gt; It was not Elijah finding the chariot.
[56:04] It was the chariot finding Elijah.
[56:06] &gt;&gt; You were not searching for your own
[56:07] theophony. Your theophony will find you.
[56:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please make the next one. Amen.
[56:13] Make make a stop. Here's here. I know I
[56:16] showed it already, but let me repeat.
[56:17] Let me talk from my heart. Can you say
[56:19] amen so far?
[56:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[56:20] &gt;&gt; You say it's a little bit shallow this
[56:21] evening. No, no, it's not shallow. This
[56:23] is the opening of the word.
[56:25] &gt;&gt; This is the effect of the opening of
[56:27] what happened on Sunset Mountain.
[56:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Ramy said it will all it will
[56:30] constantly unfold itself.
[56:33] &gt;&gt; It must have an impact on our life.
[56:36] &gt;&gt; It's not a doctrine. It's a lifestyle.
[56:39] Amen.
[56:40] &gt;&gt; We are the first generation
[56:41] understanding God.
[56:43] &gt;&gt; Therefore, you cannot go into a
[56:45] denomination. There's no way because you
[56:47] said, "No, I need the message for this
[56:49] hour."
[56:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[56:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[56:51] &gt;&gt; So, that man is not grandfather. That
[56:53] man is her father. There are two
[56:55] unbelievers.
[56:57] You see, now that's his daughter. And
[56:59] they made that picture somewhere in
[57:01] Holland because the father has cancer.
[57:04] He would soon pancer of pancreatas. He
[57:07] would soon die.
[57:08] So the father understand his role. He
[57:12] says he says look I will die and nobody
[57:14] will bring my little girl to the altar.
[57:17] So what they did they were playing
[57:20] wedding ceremony
[57:22] and they stopped that ceremony at the
[57:25] point where the father brings the girl
[57:27] to the altar and they stopped there.
[57:29] Amen. So when the girl will marry one
[57:32] day, they will continue exactly at that
[57:34] point. Only that the girl can say my own
[57:38] father brought me to the altar.
[57:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:41] &gt;&gt; Brother, I saw by myself if an
[57:42] unbelieving father can have that kind of
[57:44] an understanding. What about us with the
[57:47] Holy Ghost?
[57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[57:48] &gt;&gt; Do we understand our children need us?
[57:52] &gt;&gt; They need us.
[57:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the and the lower they fall,
[57:56] the more they need us.
[57:59] the the the the the greater the nonsense
[58:02] that they is that they're doing in our
[58:04] life in their life, the more they need a
[58:06] good father and a good mother and a good
[58:08] church.
[58:09] &gt;&gt; Therefore, I always say dear when
[58:10] everything went wrong in your life,
[58:12] don't stay home.
[58:14] &gt;&gt; That is the moment to come in the house
[58:16] of the Lord and speak with your father,
[58:18] your heavenly father. Say, "Heavenly
[58:19] Father, here I am." Amen.
[58:21] &gt;&gt; Have you ever seen on a Wednesday that
[58:24] we have a little bit of a flu like
[58:27] and then you hear a voice don't go
[58:28] today.
[58:30] &gt;&gt; You're not a blessing. Have you ever
[58:31] heard that voice?
[58:33] &gt;&gt; In other words, it speaks English and
[58:34] German.
[58:36] I hear it in German. You hear it in
[58:38] English. Brother, I tell you, if the
[58:40] devil tells you to stay home, you tell
[58:42] the devil, you stay home.
[58:45] You stay home.
[58:49] Do do you understand? You will not
[58:51] become more spiritual by staying home.
[58:54] &gt;&gt; When everything goes wrong, that's the
[58:55] moment to come in the house of your
[58:56] father. Heavenly here I am.
[58:58] &gt;&gt; I'm a you you paid a price. You made a
[59:00] way. You called me. You are the alpha
[59:02] and you will be my omega. I don't know
[59:03] have a solution. A person said, "Brother
[59:05] Marcus, I have no way. Jesus is the way.
[59:08] &gt;&gt; If you have Jesus, you have a way.
[59:10] You're never in a dead end. No matter
[59:11] what you did, he has a solution."
[59:14] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? Right.
[59:16] &gt;&gt; So blessed. Your children need you. They
[59:18] need your hug. Brother, we come from a
[59:20] generation of the old German people. We
[59:22] couldn't our fathers could not tell us
[59:24] how they love us.
[59:26] &gt;&gt; They did not.
[59:28] We we come
[59:32] we we we we we come from a clinical pure
[59:36] generation. Our father could not show
[59:39] emotions.
[59:41] &gt;&gt; That was our our generation. I always
[59:43] wonder myself how my father and my
[59:45] mother got a child.
[59:48] It must be by a spoken word.
[59:52] But I mean that the father comes and and
[59:55] and grabs the boy and says, "Boy, hey, I
[59:57] want to tell you one thing. I love you,
[59:58] man." We we never knew that.
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:00:01] &gt;&gt; You see, and we brought it to the next
[1:00:03] generation because we said we were
[1:00:04] raised that way.
[1:00:06] &gt;&gt; I I took care of young people in our
[1:00:08] church since many many years. Now the
[1:00:10] children of their father they have
[1:00:12] already children and you can see how
[1:00:14] traces go through families
[1:00:16] &gt;&gt; and and and people say and I tell the
[1:00:18] father I said hey your boy is a sensible
[1:00:20] boy he needs sometime a little bit of
[1:00:23] encouragement not only correction a
[1:00:25] little bit of encouragement and the
[1:00:27] father said brother Marcus if you know
[1:00:28] my father he was even stricter or he was
[1:00:31] more hard I said but did your father had
[1:00:34] the opening of the word
[1:00:36] &gt;&gt; I mean we can only become like our
[1:00:39] father. When we understand who our
[1:00:41] father is
[1:00:42] &gt;&gt; and how he acts,
[1:00:45] &gt;&gt; then we become children of a father. If
[1:00:47] not, we become just children of a
[1:00:49] religious system.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen,
[1:00:52] &gt;&gt; brother? Our sisters, for example, now
[1:00:54] we took we take things for granted.
[1:00:56] Don't take it for granted. Here is
[1:00:58] sister. I mean, this is a Wednesday
[1:00:59] evening. I mean, here here's the cream
[1:01:01] of the people sitting here.
[1:01:03] &gt;&gt; It's a cream. I mean, I know people come
[1:01:05] from far. Those who are now in the
[1:01:06] internet, don't misunderstand. I
[1:01:07] understand. But here's Wednesday
[1:01:09] evening. Here's many young people. I
[1:01:10] mean, God bless their hearts.
[1:01:13] &gt;&gt; That's not that's not that that's not
[1:01:15] for granted that they should come.
[1:01:17] &gt;&gt; Okay. So, so Brother Braymond said,
[1:01:19] "Every woman wants to be pretty."
[1:01:22] &gt;&gt; I always tell the young sisters, you can
[1:01:24] be pretty but not sexy.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:01:27] &gt;&gt; If God made you pretty, where's the
[1:01:28] problem?
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; You're not more spiritual by being not
[1:01:31] pretty.
[1:01:33] &gt;&gt; If God made you pretty, you're pretty
[1:01:34] over. But don't be sexy. That is the
[1:01:36] difference. Don't make me sexy but
[1:01:38] pretty. No problem. But who tells the
[1:01:41] girls that they are looking good with
[1:01:43] their long skirt? You think school will
[1:01:45] do it? Nobody will do. But that person
[1:01:47] needs good words.
[1:01:50] &gt;&gt; Now who will tell the girl that she is a
[1:01:52] wonderful young girl and she's looking
[1:01:54] good? It must be daddy.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; We must all tell our youngsters, hey,
[1:01:59] daddy is proud of you.
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Daddy sees you. Amen.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? I know. I know that
[1:02:07] I'm bringing you into trouble right now,
[1:02:09] but tomorrow I'm leaving.
[1:02:12] &gt;&gt; Every every Friday I buy some flowers
[1:02:15] for my wife. I mean, we are German. I'm
[1:02:17] not too I'm not I'm not a hugging type
[1:02:19] of person.
[1:02:21] But but but I show my wife here. I see
[1:02:23] what they're doing. Okay. I mean, and
[1:02:26] and and every just just a little three
[1:02:28] $4. Not too much. Okay. But but but just
[1:02:32] just to make a sign. So when my little
[1:02:35] girl became a woman now, now now she
[1:02:37] asked me and me and me and and by
[1:02:42] inspiration that Friday I got one rose
[1:02:44] for my daughter. Okay. So my daughter
[1:02:47] was at the at the at the balcony and I
[1:02:50] she and she said, "Do you have some
[1:02:51] flowers for mama?" And I put the flowers
[1:02:53] for mama. Okay.
[1:02:56] And then she said, "And for me, she was
[1:02:59] a little smaller." And at that day I
[1:03:01] brought a rose for her and I showed that
[1:03:03] rose to her. It was another color. He
[1:03:04] said, "Mama,
[1:03:10] you see, you must understand one thing.
[1:03:12] I did not only buy these roses for my
[1:03:15] wife.
[1:03:17] &gt;&gt; I know that our daughter will watch us."
[1:03:20] Right?
[1:03:21] &gt;&gt; And I will I want her to teach if you
[1:03:24] marry one time a man, marry a person who
[1:03:27] will treat you the same way like I treat
[1:03:29] mama.
[1:03:30] &gt;&gt; That's what they learn at home.
[1:03:33] &gt;&gt; Do you understand these things?
[1:03:35] &gt;&gt; And can you say amen?
[1:03:38] &gt;&gt; So So let me let me just finish. Amen.
[1:03:41] Let me just just go on. Please make the
[1:03:43] next one. That means we understand
[1:03:47] that people especially the younger
[1:03:50] generation they learned God through us
[1:03:57] &gt;&gt; had to deal with a case in our church
[1:04:00] the father is a schizophrenia
[1:04:02] brother brother and and and we didn't
[1:04:04] see it because we were too naive at that
[1:04:06] time today I I I I I study a lot human
[1:04:10] human human spirits today. But at that
[1:04:14] time they could fool me because we
[1:04:16] thought the Holy Ghost will come and it
[1:04:18] would No, no, no. We have different
[1:04:20] areas. Body, soul, spirit, human spirit,
[1:04:23] holy spirit, genes, upbringing, social
[1:04:26] life, everything has has a little part
[1:04:28] in it.
[1:04:29] &gt;&gt; Must really understand. Okay.
[1:04:31] &gt;&gt; So, so but that person was free. He
[1:04:34] was he was like this in church and it
[1:04:36] was a complete different man.
[1:04:39] The boy said, "Brother Marcus, it's not
[1:04:40] the beating with the fist which hurt
[1:04:43] which hurts the most. It's the words.
[1:04:46] &gt;&gt; The word words can be can be more doing
[1:04:50] more damage."
[1:04:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; Than beatings.
[1:04:54] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:04:56] it became a disaster and I I went to the
[1:04:58] family and I asked for forgiveness. The
[1:05:00] boy was 14 years old. He said, "Brother
[1:05:03] Marcus, you want to help us, but you
[1:05:04] cannot because you don't understand the
[1:05:06] case." And I I mean I was a minister at
[1:05:08] that time. I said, "Who are you to tell
[1:05:10] me?" And then I came to him and to the
[1:05:11] whole family. I said, "Please forgive
[1:05:12] me." I tried my best honestly, but I
[1:05:16] didn't understand where the problem
[1:05:18] lays.
[1:05:19] &gt;&gt; I'm a problem in the psyche.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; And then the boy said something to me
[1:05:24] that I never forgot. He said, "Brother
[1:05:26] Marcus, I do not know God as a father
[1:05:30] because I don't know what a father is."
[1:05:32] He said, 'If God is a father like my
[1:05:35] father was to us, then I have a problem.
[1:05:37] I said, 'No, you saw a complete
[1:05:40] perverted picture of what a real father
[1:05:42] is. A father would die for his children.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; A real father would not eat unless the
[1:05:49] children have eaten.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; Quote brother Brandham, God loves to do
[1:05:54] things for his children. God loves to
[1:05:57] bless.
[1:05:59] &gt;&gt; God loves to heal. Amen.
[1:06:01] &gt;&gt; God loves to have fellowship.
[1:06:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:05] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:06:07] &gt;&gt; So here we understand. Amen. That that
[1:06:09] that that was the picture that that that
[1:06:13] that that Rebecca one of these kind of
[1:06:15] pictures Rebecca had at the wall. And
[1:06:18] she said, "And when we went over to
[1:06:20] Tucson, my father went back, brother
[1:06:22] Brenam, and he got that picture and put
[1:06:24] it into the car and it's just an angel.
[1:06:28] And I think that is now Marcus.
[1:06:32] Brother Brandon wanted to show his his
[1:06:34] little girl. Hey, I want to tell you one
[1:06:36] thing. Daddy's not very long with you.
[1:06:39] &gt;&gt; I tell you one thing. If you're standing
[1:06:41] at the bed of your own child and that
[1:06:43] child has cancer, what message will you
[1:06:46] give?
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; Will you just say God send a prophet?
[1:06:49] Hey, you will trying to make a
[1:06:52] connection
[1:06:53] &gt;&gt; between the almighty God.
[1:06:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "I don't know if you will
[1:06:57] be healed, but if your soul is in God's
[1:06:59] hands, you will wake up on the other
[1:07:01] side in paradise."
[1:07:03] &gt;&gt; Okay? You we will not be offended by
[1:07:06] little things.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; The most important thing for us would be
[1:07:10] just her soul.
[1:07:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:12] &gt;&gt; Find peace with God. Nothing else. The
[1:07:14] rest is just secondary.
[1:07:16] &gt;&gt; So, so brother wanted to show his child,
[1:07:19] look, we are parents. We protect you.
[1:07:22] But never forget even if papa mama is
[1:07:25] not around never alone
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; because you have an angel. And brother
[1:07:31] Brandham explains that our own theophony
[1:07:34] is our angel.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Two questions to brother Brandham. Two
[1:07:38] times he said that's your own theophony.
[1:07:40] Brother Brandham was not the only one.
[1:07:44] The first one he did not invent
[1:07:46] theophanies.
[1:07:48] &gt;&gt; But as brother Brandham was not a
[1:07:50] reformer he was a prophet. He could see
[1:07:52] into the other dimension. He says my own
[1:07:54] theophony called a glorified body. He
[1:07:57] said is right standing here on that
[1:07:59] platform charging me like a battery.
[1:08:01] Quote brother Brandon.
[1:08:04] &gt;&gt; So what why does he say these things to
[1:08:08] tell us look when you feel alone there's
[1:08:12] somebody who goes with you.
[1:08:14] If you're in hospital and nobody cares
[1:08:17] for you, nobody knows your number when
[1:08:19] it becomes difficult in your life, then
[1:08:21] never forget you have a father.
[1:08:24] &gt;&gt; And your father is closer to you than
[1:08:26] you think.
[1:08:27] &gt;&gt; If you're a true believer, you can never
[1:08:29] say I'm I'm alone. You know, I'm never
[1:08:31] alone.
[1:08:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. If you're a true believer, you can
[1:08:35] never say I have no friends in the
[1:08:36] church because you say God God is my
[1:08:38] friend.
[1:08:40] &gt;&gt; He's my husband. He's my redeemer. He's
[1:08:42] my father. He's my mother. He's my
[1:08:44] brother. He's my everything.
[1:08:46] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:08:48] &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. Amen. I'm just
[1:08:50] going through life now. Here's the man,
[1:08:52] Mike Tyson. Mike Tyson, he was he was he
[1:08:56] he was our hero when we were younger
[1:09:00] and and and and he says in that
[1:09:03] interview that I was reading as an
[1:09:04] unbelieving boy, he said, "When I see a
[1:09:07] person, I want to and my enemy, I want
[1:09:10] to force his nose into his brain."
[1:09:12] That's what he says and we would say
[1:09:14] that's a monster.
[1:09:15] &gt;&gt; But in the same interview he says look I
[1:09:18] was always and I hope I said the right
[1:09:20] word I was always a sensible person.
[1:09:23] You could easily hurt my feelings. I
[1:09:25] loved animals. I love doves and I and I
[1:09:28] and I had these kind of doves and these
[1:09:30] boys came to kill all my doves. And Mike
[1:09:33] Tyson says this. I trained all these
[1:09:36] muscles around me to protect my little
[1:09:39] soul.
[1:09:41] A person can have a a great uh presence,
[1:09:45] a great appearing, but in that great man
[1:09:48] is still a little child
[1:09:52] &gt;&gt; that can be hurt
[1:09:55] &gt;&gt; that has a certain feeling that can be
[1:09:58] touched by the Lord.
[1:10:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand that God's
[1:10:04] calls?
[1:10:07] When we were evangelists, we thought
[1:10:09] altar call must be crashing the people
[1:10:12] down.
[1:10:14] Amen. That the altar is full and you're
[1:10:16] breaking these people down. But but God
[1:10:18] can call with love.
[1:10:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:10:21] &gt;&gt; Here's the man, the the colored brother,
[1:10:24] black brother. You understand what I
[1:10:25] want to say. I'm not politically
[1:10:26] correct. Okay. The African, whatever you
[1:10:28] want to call it. Brother calls him Gabe.
[1:10:31] and Gabe and and and and brother Ramy
[1:10:34] said the wife came to church and Gabe he
[1:10:36] just was wasn't interested in religion
[1:10:38] &gt;&gt; and the pastor he was always trying to
[1:10:40] convince Gabe to come to church and one
[1:10:44] evening they were just hunting and the
[1:10:47] pastor goes and Gabe stands there he
[1:10:49] starts crying
[1:10:51] and then the pastor turns around he said
[1:10:53] Gabe why are you crying he said pastor
[1:10:57] the sun is going down and I realize the
[1:10:59] sun of my life is going down too. And he
[1:11:02] says, "Do you see this, pastor?" Amen.
[1:11:05] All these animals that God gave me,
[1:11:08] everybody knows I'm I I I'm not a
[1:11:10] shooter at all. I will I will not make
[1:11:12] any kind of
[1:11:14] pride, you want to call it. Okay. I
[1:11:17] realized God gave me all these animals
[1:11:20] because I I knew he knew that I needed.
[1:11:22] He said, "Pastor, on next Sunday I will
[1:11:25] be in church because I want to serve a
[1:11:28] God who cares so much for me."
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Hey, that's different. That's another
[1:11:32] form of altar call.
[1:11:34] &gt;&gt; If not, if you're not, then God will.
[1:11:36] It's hey, there's no option. He's such a
[1:11:40] loving father.
[1:11:42] &gt;&gt; It's such a pleasure to serve the Lord
[1:11:44] &gt;&gt; that there is no way to leave the
[1:11:46] message.
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:11:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. Especially if we want and we
[1:11:53] cannot. So people asked brother Mike
[1:11:56] Tyson, he said, "Mr. Tyson, are you able
[1:11:59] to overcome the frustration of your
[1:12:01] use?" He says, "We I will never be able
[1:12:03] to for overcome the frustration of my
[1:12:06] youth." And I thought by myself, "Yes,
[1:12:08] by the Holy Ghost, you can overcome all
[1:12:13] scars in your life, but it's a process.
[1:12:17] &gt;&gt; It's not a prayer line. It's a operation
[1:12:20] that the Holy Ghost makes.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; You will be free, brother. I I I have to
[1:12:26] deal with cases of young people to
[1:12:29] trying to commit suicide. One case was
[1:12:32] right before my eyes. I know what I'm
[1:12:35] talking about. I have to deal with young
[1:12:37] people in the message. They cut
[1:12:38] themselves. He said, "Why does people
[1:12:41] cut themselves?" You know why people cut
[1:12:43] themselves? Because they say the pain in
[1:12:44] the flesh is not as terrible as the pain
[1:12:47] in my own in my own mind.
[1:12:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:12:50] &gt;&gt; It's a pain relief. Therefore, they cut
[1:12:52] themselves.
[1:12:53] &gt;&gt; I had to deal with people
[1:12:56] sexually abused. I had to deal with
[1:12:59] people emotionally abused. I had to deal
[1:13:02] with children neglected by the parents.
[1:13:05] All kind. And I always find out there's
[1:13:08] a way.
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; There's a way.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; But it takes time.
[1:13:13] It takes empathy. It's not just a little
[1:13:16] prayer and think God can do everything
[1:13:18] in a moment.
[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; And it starts when people understand I
[1:13:22] need help. And the first thing that they
[1:13:24] must understand my father is on my side.
[1:13:27] &gt;&gt; And now here's the healing process that
[1:13:30] starts that changes a person. Not just
[1:13:32] with some little emotions but heals the
[1:13:35] person from the inside.
[1:13:37] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen,
[1:13:38] &gt;&gt; brother? Brother,
[1:13:41] the best thing
[1:13:43] that I can tell people to get healed
[1:13:46] from the scars of this world is the
[1:13:48] message of the hour.
[1:13:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:50] &gt;&gt; Because the message of the hour is the
[1:13:52] balm of Gilead for a bride.
[1:13:55] &gt;&gt; It's the answer of God for a dying
[1:13:58] generation.
[1:13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please make the next one. Amen.
[1:14:01] Amen. I'm hearing through. Here's here's
[1:14:03] Mary in Monroe. Brother Brham said here
[1:14:06] not long ago I saw in the vision a young
[1:14:08] a young woman dying they said she
[1:14:10] committed suicide it's about a year ago
[1:14:12] I forgot she was some kind of a girl
[1:14:14] that was very popular was up in the
[1:14:17] mountains I saw her die and told me and
[1:14:20] you can say at 4:00 just two seconds and
[1:14:22] submit they say she committed suicide
[1:14:24] but she did not it was a heart attack
[1:14:27] brother said I felt sorry for the girl
[1:14:30] she always seems to be a kind of a woman
[1:14:33] weary she needed something wish I could
[1:14:36] have got to the church. She needed
[1:14:37] Christ. She might have went to some cold
[1:14:40] formal church but she needed a real case
[1:14:43] of salvation with something in her heart
[1:14:45] to give that assurance. Her father she
[1:14:48] has never seen him. Her mother was in
[1:14:51] the insane institution. It was all on
[1:14:54] the girl's mind. She needed Christ. And
[1:14:57] then what? That's what we know. Brother,
[1:15:00] if the angel of the Lord was interested
[1:15:04] in Marilyn Monro who never came to
[1:15:06] church visiting the prophet telling when
[1:15:09] she will die on the second, don't you
[1:15:12] think that the angel of the Lord knows
[1:15:13] where our children are?
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please,
[1:15:20] please believe your own prayers. Yes.
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; Please
[1:15:26] believe in a God who is not not a
[1:15:28] showmaker. God works great things.
[1:15:33] &gt;&gt; Without us perceiving it.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Do you understand when we came on earth
[1:15:39] that the date of our expire was already
[1:15:42] on our front?
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; Because when when when when when the
[1:15:47] angel could say when Mary and Mandro
[1:15:49] will die, God knows already when we will
[1:15:51] die. or if we make the rapture. That's
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; right.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; There's there is a certain movement in
[1:15:57] Germany which says
[1:15:59] healthy living.
[1:16:02] I mean I tell you one thing, you can eat
[1:16:04] healthy but when your time is up you die
[1:16:07] healthy.
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; Die healthy.
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; But I want to tell you this the young
[1:16:15] people.
[1:16:17] We don't have much time.
[1:16:20] If you want to do something for God,
[1:16:22] don't waste. Brother, I never was in a
[1:16:24] false doctrine. Never was, never ever.
[1:16:27] But I have lost too many years of my
[1:16:30] life with immaturity.
[1:16:34] &gt;&gt; And today I I feel sorry. I said, Lord,
[1:16:36] let these these little years that I that
[1:16:38] lay before me, don't let me waste them
[1:16:40] with the nonsense.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; I I I I I I I I made I made stories out
[1:16:46] of nothing. I was always offended by
[1:16:48] this and offended by that. and he said
[1:16:50] this and they said this and I mean and
[1:16:52] today I said Lord let me use my time
[1:16:56] &gt;&gt; for your glory and for your honor
[1:16:59] &gt;&gt; somebody is wrong to me Lord forgive me
[1:17:01] I don't have time now to make a big
[1:17:02] story out of it let me go forward
[1:17:05] &gt;&gt; if you want to do something for God do
[1:17:07] it today
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; if you want to tell a person how much
[1:17:11] you care for them don't wait for the for
[1:17:13] the deathbed
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; tell them now
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; tell your children how much you care for
[1:17:18] them if they serve the Lord or God, God
[1:17:20] has to call them.
[1:17:22] &gt;&gt; Salvation is supernatural. It's not we
[1:17:24] train them into something.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; You want to tell your pastor how much
[1:17:30] you appreciate
[1:17:31] &gt;&gt; do it.
[1:17:32] &gt;&gt; I mean, I'm a traveling minister. As a
[1:17:34] traveling minister, you're always the
[1:17:36] man of the hour
[1:17:37] &gt;&gt; or of the minute.
[1:17:40] Pe people people come and say, "Oh,
[1:17:43] brother Marcus, we never heard it like
[1:17:45] this. It was so tremendous one. That's
[1:17:47] wonderful." But how much do we say to
[1:17:50] the person that are standing there every
[1:17:52] week?
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; You're never wrong in sharing empathy,
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; heart, soul, emotions, respect,
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; LOVE. I'M GIVE IT OUT. IT WILL COME BACK
[1:18:05] TO YOU, MAN.
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; Give it out. Our time is too short for
[1:18:09] for murmuring. Amen.
[1:18:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. How beautiful God
[1:18:15] caring. And here is God understanding
[1:18:17] life.
[1:18:19] Amen. At the white throne judgment,
[1:18:21] brother, God will be just. There's
[1:18:25] people on this earth, they are
[1:18:26] completely underprivileged. People in
[1:18:29] Africa, they are they die as children,
[1:18:33] starving for death. But God, the Bible
[1:18:35] says God is just. Those who are
[1:18:38] underprivileged on this side of the
[1:18:40] earth, of this side of life, they will
[1:18:42] be privileged on the other side.
[1:18:45] God is just. God is love. Sometime
[1:18:49] people stand they they they cannot
[1:18:51] follow because of circumcision or
[1:18:54] circumstances. God at the white throne
[1:18:57] judgment will understand.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; He will really be a just God. A just
[1:19:04] judge. Thank you Jesus. Can you say
[1:19:06] amen? I'm hurrying through. Give me give
[1:19:08] me just a little bit of time. Not much
[1:19:09] but Okay. Please make the next one so we
[1:19:12] understand.
[1:19:13] Please what I said in the beginning
[1:19:17] unto you that fear my name shall the son
[1:19:20] of righteousness arise with healing
[1:19:23] under his wings.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means the opening of the word
[1:19:29] has a healing power.
[1:19:32] &gt;&gt; That's what the Bible says. And remember
[1:19:37] when we came on earth
[1:19:40] we were just subject
[1:19:42] in a body that we don't like with
[1:19:44] circumstances that we don't like not
[1:19:47] understanding who we were but when God
[1:19:51] came down into our generation he opened
[1:19:54] the veil for us that we understand where
[1:19:58] we come from
[1:20:00] &gt;&gt; what we're doing here. Amen. He
[1:20:03] understands. He he he opens our
[1:20:05] understanding. Therefore, brother Bram
[1:20:08] says in the seven seal, he says when the
[1:20:10] supernatural comes in, that's the mind
[1:20:13] of Christ.
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. That means God is giving the
[1:20:18] church now the understanding
[1:20:21] that we can think the thoughts of God.
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; That takes the amnesia away. Amen.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; That takes the frustration of life away
[1:20:34] because you understand I'm the hand in
[1:20:36] the hands of almighty God.
[1:20:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Now here is life and it's so miserable
[1:20:41] for Job and and and his health is down.
[1:20:45] Everything is is is is is
[1:20:48] coming to an end. And God doesn't send a
[1:20:51] social worker.
[1:20:54] I mean first the first one who comes to
[1:20:57] Job is a nice Lutheran. And he says,
[1:20:58] "Job, you just have to believe."
[1:21:01] Brother, when people go to difficult
[1:21:04] situations in their life, they don't
[1:21:06] need Bible slogans.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Sometime no word is the best word.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Instead of ah yes, we have come on.
[1:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then the next person that is now
[1:21:18] Marcus was a nice Methodist. He said,
[1:21:21] "Jope, you need
[1:21:24] that the emotions, you know, that it
[1:21:26] goes your spine up and down." And we all
[1:21:28] love that.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; But that is not the answer.
[1:21:33] &gt;&gt; The third one says, "Job, you need more
[1:21:35] gifts." And I have a gift. We have
[1:21:36] gifts. We're preaching for gifts. But a
[1:21:40] gift is not the answer for the challenge
[1:21:43] of this day.
[1:21:45] &gt;&gt; And the first one is God himself in the
[1:21:48] form of Elihoo.
[1:21:50] I'm El Shai.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Elohim. Elhu. Amen. speaking to Job, he
[1:21:56] said, "Job, I tell you one thing.
[1:22:00] Don't look these 70 years on this earth
[1:22:03] because you will die and there's a
[1:22:05] remedy. Somebody paid the price. You
[1:22:08] become a young man again." He speaks
[1:22:09] about the millennium. And Job now he's
[1:22:12] he understands life is more than just 70
[1:22:17] 80 years in Georgia. Life is much more
[1:22:20] than this.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother, brother, if you God can
[1:22:24] bring God can make your life that you're
[1:22:26] never sick
[1:22:30] &gt;&gt; and God can you can can bring you into a
[1:22:33] life where you are in a wheelchair and
[1:22:34] it's the same God
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; and you are still blessed even in the
[1:22:39] wheelchair
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; because blessing is not outward thing.
[1:22:43] Blessing is God's love in you.
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; So, so Job thought about hey you're
[1:22:50] right. I mean I die and I will be a
[1:22:52] young man again. Blessed be the name of
[1:22:54] the Lord. And then comes a voice and
[1:22:56] tied this to Sabino Canyon to Sunset
[1:22:59] Mountain. And he asked him just a
[1:23:01] question. He said, "Who darkens the
[1:23:03] counsel of God with words of without
[1:23:06] understanding?" And Job must have said,
[1:23:09] "Oh, oh,
[1:23:12] I think I thought." And God just asked
[1:23:14] the question, "Job, where were you men?"
[1:23:17] Amen.
[1:23:18] &gt;&gt; When the sons of God were shouting for
[1:23:20] joy and Job was so he he he remembered
[1:23:24] God brought his understanding. I must
[1:23:27] have been there when the sons of God
[1:23:29] were shouting for joy. Brother, the
[1:23:31] opening of the word is the healing for
[1:23:34] the bride.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; It's more than just nice feelings.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; It's more than I received the Holy
[1:23:40] Ghost. That's what we all receive when
[1:23:42] we were born again. It's more than just
[1:23:44] we have a nice shirt. God is God makes
[1:23:47] us to understand our life
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; and now we can take the challenge of our
[1:23:54] life understanding I have a father
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; and everything that came my way it was
[1:23:59] not my because I didn't perform right
[1:24:02] the time of of blaming myself is over I
[1:24:05] did my best but God allows it to just
[1:24:08] see one thing how do I deal with that
[1:24:11] situation
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; God allows that People come into church
[1:24:16] and they are troublemakers,
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; He just wants to see how we react with
[1:24:21] them.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; We all want to have children, you know,
[1:24:24] they are standing like organ pipes. You
[1:24:26] know, you make a picture.
[1:24:30] &gt;&gt; We all love that. But God allows that we
[1:24:32] get difficult children just to see how
[1:24:34] we react on that. Yeah.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; I mean just to see is my child now
[1:24:40] mature enough to handle that situation
[1:24:43] and into into in his hands. Amen.
[1:24:45] Blessed be the name of therefore the
[1:24:47] capstone came. That is the mind of
[1:24:50] Christ
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; to take the curse of our birth away and
[1:24:54] we now have the mind of Christ.
[1:24:56] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:24:57] &gt;&gt; For the first time God can talk to us.
[1:25:00] Therefore God says to Job, let me say it
[1:25:03] in my own words. Stop being childish.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Stand before me like a man.
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; I'm a stop I job. I will not baby you
[1:25:14] around anymore.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; I will not take all your problems away
[1:25:18] that you feel nice.
[1:25:20] &gt;&gt; I will give you more problem but I make
[1:25:22] you to understand that I am the almighty
[1:25:25] God. Can you say amen?
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. Please make the next one. Amen.
[1:25:30] Please make the next one. I'm finishing.
[1:25:32] Amen. Make the next one. Please. hiring
[1:25:34] them. How many? Three three four quote.
[1:25:36] Can you say amen so far?
[1:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:38] &gt;&gt; This message
[1:25:40] did not bring us a religion,
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; not a doctrine.
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; It brought us a father.
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's what Brother Brham said. He
[1:25:52] speaks about he he speaks about uh the
[1:25:56] prophet Elijah so depressed.
[1:26:00] Amen. wanted to die, wanted to give up.
[1:26:06] And the prophet said, I would imagine
[1:26:08] every all around the place was swarm of
[1:26:10] angels. God came down. He said, "My poor
[1:26:13] little tired servant, he's so nervous
[1:26:16] and tore up. He don't know what to do. I
[1:26:18] want to pick out the angel standing here
[1:26:21] that's got the softest hands. Don't you
[1:26:23] scare him." Walk over and stroke his
[1:26:26] bro, right? Easy. and I want the best
[1:26:28] cook among you and got up there and got
[1:26:30] all the vitamins that you can find and
[1:26:32] put it into his into his cornmeal. The
[1:26:35] world turned him down, but I'm going to
[1:26:38] treat him right. Hallelujah. That means
[1:26:41] praise our God. Don't get scared of
[1:26:44] that. Bring forth the best that we got.
[1:26:46] Cook him a corn cake. Set him down some
[1:26:49] water. And the soft-handed angels went
[1:26:52] down, stroked the little servant of God
[1:26:54] on the bro.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. And then brother Bram said then we
[1:26:58] don't believe in tattoos
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; right
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; I mean we have a German minister he had
[1:27:04] a tattoo of the seven angels somewhere
[1:27:05] said okay all things are possible in the
[1:27:07] message
[1:27:09] but if you want to have a tattoo then
[1:27:11] you make that tattoo okay put it on your
[1:27:14] heart quote brother Brandon remember if
[1:27:18] you have done your best God still got
[1:27:22] those angels in order he loves you just
[1:27:25] the He loved Elijah.
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; Brother, if you did your best,
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; then you count on your father because
[1:27:34] God knows. Do you do you remember what
[1:27:36] we was reading in the in the beginning?
[1:27:38] God gives talents according to their
[1:27:41] capacity.
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; God knew that we were born with
[1:27:46] deficiencies.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; Therefore, God had to explain the life
[1:27:50] of William Brandham. He said, "I came
[1:27:52] from the presence of the Lord to explain
[1:27:55] your peculiar life." Is that correct?
[1:27:58] &gt;&gt; And the opening of the word explains our
[1:28:01] peculiar life that we can go forward.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:05] &gt;&gt; That nothing stands anymore in our
[1:28:07] because we know where we come from that
[1:28:09] our father is with us and he will take
[1:28:11] us home.
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:13] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? So, so, so, brother
[1:28:16] Marcus, do you make the rapture? I make
[1:28:18] it.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because of what? BECAUSE OF MY
[1:28:22] FATHER.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Will you make the rapture? Yes. But
[1:28:26] brother Marcus, I'm weaker than you. The
[1:28:28] weaker you are, the stronger is your
[1:28:30] father.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; God picks you up at the place where
[1:28:35] you're standing.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; If you can raise yourself, God is coming
[1:28:40] in your direction. But if you're very
[1:28:41] low down, God comes even lower down to
[1:28:43] pick you up.
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; Because none of his children is missing.
[1:28:47] Right?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; God is not standing there at the
[1:28:50] rapture. Say, "Okay, we we we see who
[1:28:52] will make it. Okay, maybe the rapture is
[1:28:55] not your making. God came down in
[1:28:58] Revelation chapter 10 and Christ came
[1:29:00] down
[1:29:01] &gt;&gt; to bring you up."
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Blessed be. That's the difference
[1:29:05] between a dictator and a father.
[1:29:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; That's the difference.
[1:29:14] God is not a dictator. God is a father.
[1:29:17] God is not trying to help you to God is
[1:29:21] not happy if you make the rapture. God
[1:29:22] makes sure
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; that all shouldn't make the rapture
[1:29:26] because with you, brother said, God is
[1:29:29] not anymore complete.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; Please make the next one. Brother Mar,
[1:29:33] brother Marcus, but that means I can
[1:29:35] drink, I can smoke and so forth. No, you
[1:29:37] have you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; It will not allow that you drink and
[1:29:41] smoke.
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Make the next one, please. I'm
[1:29:44] hurrying through. I know I'm a little
[1:29:45] bit over time, but give me that just to
[1:29:47] round it up. Okay, here's brother Ren.
[1:29:50] We all know the storm is there.
[1:29:55] He speaks to the storm. He comes down.
[1:29:57] Look what it is. And in a few minutes,
[1:30:00] the sun was shining nice and warm.
[1:30:01] That's true. God knows the truth. It
[1:30:03] stood right there. I got numb all over
[1:30:06] the very God of creation. It's in his
[1:30:08] hand. What is he telling me? And I
[1:30:11] picked my gun, wiped off the scope,
[1:30:13] started walking back, go down the hill.
[1:30:14] And something said to me, "Why don't you
[1:30:17] stroll with me through this wilderness?
[1:30:20] Walk with me." For the first time in
[1:30:23] thousands of years, God
[1:30:28] revealed his heart.
[1:30:31] God does not ask for obedience. God says
[1:30:34] to the prophet, "Why don't you walk with
[1:30:37] me?"
[1:30:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. God loves to have fellowship
[1:30:43] &gt;&gt; with his children.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:47] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:30:49] &gt;&gt; For the first time, God is not only
[1:30:52] showing himself as the consuming fire,
[1:30:55] but as a loving father.
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; And he does not command the prophet, if
[1:31:00] you don't, then I will. God just asked
[1:31:04] him, why don't you walk with me?
[1:31:08] Do you understand God opening his heart?
[1:31:11] How he loves to walk with his church?
[1:31:15] &gt;&gt; You say, "I want to have fellowship with
[1:31:17] Jesus." But I want to say Jesus said, "I
[1:31:20] want to have fellowship with you."
[1:31:26] &gt;&gt; If you pray,
[1:31:28] just wait long enough. He comes
[1:31:32] &gt;&gt; because he wants to have more fellowship
[1:31:34] with you than you want to have
[1:31:36] fellowship with him.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. For the first time, God reveals
[1:31:45] his heart. I would like to to walk with
[1:31:48] you.
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; And and that's not only for brother
[1:31:51] Bren. He was just the first fruit.
[1:31:54] &gt;&gt; God tells his bride, why don't you walk
[1:31:57] with me?
[1:31:58] You know, prayer when we were younger,
[1:32:00] prayer was everything. Lord, do this and
[1:32:02] do this and do that. And do I mean
[1:32:06] PRAYER IS TALKING WITH YOUR FATHER.
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; I mean, and you tell let him know,
[1:32:13] HEAVENLY FATHER, I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.
[1:32:17] &gt;&gt; I mean, we as Germans, we are we are not
[1:32:19] crying people.
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Only in football when we when when we're
[1:32:23] losing.
[1:32:25] But I hope when we are praying there's
[1:32:27] times
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; that we open our heart and so Lord Jesus
[1:32:32] we love you so much
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; I don't find even words to tell you how
[1:32:36] I love you
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; and God looks you back and says I put my
[1:32:40] name Marcus and I love you so much too.
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[1:32:48] Please make the next one Harry through.
[1:32:49] Amen. Here's the beautiful God being a
[1:32:53] father. Therefore,
[1:32:56] I have a good news. You make it
[1:33:01] &gt;&gt; and I make it. Brother, never forget
[1:33:04] gospel is good news.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; Even after 30 years in the message is
[1:33:09] good news.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; Here's brother Brandon 1960. And I told
[1:33:14] you last time here there was a new
[1:33:16] ministry speaks about the third pull. I
[1:33:19] spoke with some of the brethren today
[1:33:21] and was telling them about what
[1:33:22] happened. Just remember that the first
[1:33:25] time I was here, you remember the Lord
[1:33:27] had told me something was going to
[1:33:29] happen. Change in the ministry. It
[1:33:31] happened. Said another one is going to
[1:33:33] happen and it happened. Now there is
[1:33:36] another one greater far greater than all
[1:33:39] the rest of them put together already
[1:33:42] confirmed and ready. I hope it happens
[1:33:45] tonight. I just may say that I don't
[1:33:49] have time to explain it to you but the
[1:33:51] brothers who does know about it it's
[1:33:54] wonderful. It be a such a great thing
[1:33:56] for the people and I'm grateful to God
[1:33:59] that the hour is soon at hand when God
[1:34:03] is going to help his children especially
[1:34:06] and that's now you and me and you put
[1:34:08] your name and I put my name in.
[1:34:09] Especially it will be for those who
[1:34:12] can't master the faith to raise up and
[1:34:15] get a hold of God like they should. I
[1:34:18] believe the Lord is providing a way for
[1:34:21] us now to take care of them. Also, some
[1:34:25] run into faith that they can just reach
[1:34:27] over receive anything. Why that's great
[1:34:30] faith. Some of them has mustard seed
[1:34:33] faith and has to wait so long to get
[1:34:36] through. I believe the Lord is making a
[1:34:38] way for those people now.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; God helping especially the weak ones
[1:34:46] among us
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; because he's a father. Brother, the
[1:34:51] opening of the seal is not to make us
[1:34:53] more arrogant that we know some
[1:34:54] mysteries. You will if you have amnesia
[1:34:57] or demands like me, you forget all the
[1:34:59] mysteries. But we will not forget the
[1:35:02] person.
[1:35:04] Can we not forget what this message
[1:35:07] showed us? A father who comes down to
[1:35:09] help especially the weak ones among us.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; The weaker you are, the more your father
[1:35:16] cares for you.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; That's the difference what I told you in
[1:35:19] the beginning between people who do not
[1:35:21] want and people people who want but they
[1:35:24] cannot.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. people, many people cannot and God
[1:35:28] comes down. He said, "Look, I paid the
[1:35:30] price and I come down to help you to
[1:35:33] achieve what you need."
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:35] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? If the musicians would
[1:35:37] come Amen. And I finish.
[1:35:41] You love the Lord. Now, please please be
[1:35:43] seated. Then we just have uh if if you
[1:35:46] play softly, maybe do you have the
[1:35:48] chorus I have a father?
[1:35:50] Okay. If you just would play that softly
[1:35:52] and if I'm over time, please forgive me.
[1:35:54] But the subject is so beautiful.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Do you can do you love the Lord Jesus?
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Do you understand? We are not brandites.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; We are not in a cult. We're not in a
[1:36:06] sect. But we understand that this
[1:36:08] messenger was
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Eleazar.
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; Bringing the bride to Isaac,
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; our true bridegroom. Blessed be the name
[1:36:17] of the Lord. Look, and here is the
[1:36:19] answer what I was reading. Why did
[1:36:25] one of these three men fail?
[1:36:30] He was just putting that little talent
[1:36:33] into the ground. You You have a father.
[1:36:36] Okay, then we can sing it together.
[1:36:39] Why did he make that fatal mistake?
[1:36:44] because he had a false
[1:36:46] perception.
[1:36:51] Look what he says.
[1:36:54] And he which received one talent said,
[1:36:58] Lord, I knew thee that thou art the hard
[1:37:02] man. How how did he know that? That was
[1:37:06] his own picture that he had, brother.
[1:37:09] And we had 2,000 years of church history
[1:37:13] of portraying a God who is always
[1:37:17] beating his children, especially those
[1:37:19] who came from from reformation like us.
[1:37:23] Amen.
[1:37:25] And
[1:37:26] and he said this, I was afraid
[1:37:30] and went and hit that challenge.
[1:37:32] Brother,
[1:37:34] that is the case. You remember the
[1:37:36] vision that brother Brandham had with
[1:37:38] that three cornet stick and the woman
[1:37:40] want to stand up and here comes that man
[1:37:42] and beats her down again.
[1:37:45] Every sect works with fear.
[1:37:49] If you don't come, if you don't do this,
[1:37:51] if you miss the rapture here, you miss
[1:37:53] the rapture there. I tell you one thing,
[1:37:55] the bride is the rapture.
[1:37:58] She is part of the rapture. But this man
[1:38:01] was so paralyzed to do anything
[1:38:04] because he so much feared that he said I
[1:38:08] was afraid to make a mistake. Brother,
[1:38:10] if I don't see this in the message today
[1:38:12] in people, Amen. Amen.
[1:38:16] And the man and and here comes the Lord.
[1:38:20] He said, "Who told you
[1:38:24] that I'm a hard man?
[1:38:27] who painted the picture of a Lord Jesus.
[1:38:30] Do you know that every song that we sing
[1:38:34] speaks of a gentleman, speaks of a
[1:38:36] father, of his mercy who endures forever
[1:38:40] and ever. We don't talk about
[1:38:41] worldliness. We nobody's worldly here.
[1:38:44] Do you see that? That that every song
[1:38:46] that we sing speaks about a savior who
[1:38:49] is so beautiful. He's so great. Why
[1:38:52] shouldn't we preach like this?
[1:38:55] Why should I preach a hard cause? A
[1:38:57] person said, "Brother Marcus, are you a
[1:38:59] strict believer?" I said, "No, I'm a
[1:39:01] happy believer.
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; I'm not a strict believer. I'm a happy
[1:39:05] believer." We are not worldly. But I put
[1:39:08] all the slavery of religion. I left it
[1:39:11] behind me.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; The opening of the words set me free
[1:39:15] because now I understand my father
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; and I'm a happy person. And we are not
[1:39:20] worldly sins. Not at all because we have
[1:39:22] the Holy Ghost. But that kind of fearing
[1:39:27] and missing the rapture. The bride
[1:39:29] cannot miss the rapture. She is the
[1:39:30] rapture.
[1:39:33] &gt;&gt; And you say, "But brother Marcus, I'm
[1:39:34] not ready." Then your father's waiting.
[1:39:38] When will be the rapture? When you're
[1:39:39] ready. But I'll miss it. No. No. You are
[1:39:42] not missing. You're part of it.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; You cannot miss it. God will wait until
[1:39:48] all his children. That's a father. Amen.
[1:39:51] Many times we make warnings. We go to
[1:39:53] church. We say if you're not ready in 5
[1:39:56] minutes we're going.
[1:40:00] But in honesty, did we ever do that?
[1:40:04] In reality, then we're waiting. Okay. In
[1:40:06] five. Okay. And then when the family is
[1:40:08] there, the door closes and we go to
[1:40:10] church. God God will not forget one of
[1:40:13] his children. Cannot. He's a father.
[1:40:15] He's a father. You're not just a number
[1:40:18] in the church. You are part of that
[1:40:21] word. The whole plan of God is not
[1:40:24] anymore complete without you. That is
[1:40:27] your dignity, not your color. So there's
[1:40:31] no place after the opening of the word
[1:40:33] for minor minority complexes or
[1:40:36] superiority complexes. We talk to
[1:40:38] theophanes.
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; I have a father. God bless you. It's a
[1:40:44] pleasure to share these things. Amen.
[1:40:47] Amen.
[1:40:49] Amen.
[1:40:51] Do you have the song I have a father? If
[1:40:54] if not uh create in me a clean heart. Is
[1:40:57] that fine?
[1:40:59] You have it. And then we pray. If I was
[1:41:02] over time, please forgive me. Amen. Yes.
[1:41:06] I have a father.
[1:41:12] He knows my name
[1:41:18] and he never leaves me.
[1:41:23] No matter where I go.
[1:41:30] He knows my pain.
[1:41:35] He knows my every thought.
[1:41:41] He sees
[1:41:43] here that falls and he hears me with a
[1:41:49] call.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; I have a maker.
[1:41:53] I have a name
[1:41:59] before my heart.
[1:42:05] Before even time be
[1:42:09] my life was in his hand.
[1:42:16] He knows my name.
[1:42:22] He knows my every thought.
[1:42:28] He sees each tear that falls and he
[1:42:33] hears me when I go.
[1:42:39] I have a father
[1:42:45] and he calls me his own.
[1:42:51] He'll never leave me.
[1:42:56] No matter where I go,
[1:43:03] he knows my name.
[1:43:09] He knows by every thought.
[1:43:14] He sings a tear that falls.
[1:43:19] He hears me when I call.
[1:43:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen tonight?
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; Thank God for the journey that we were
[1:43:36] on. Yes.
[1:43:37] &gt;&gt; You know, lots of times in life we
[1:43:40] didn't understand the journey that we
[1:43:42] were on,
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; but praise God.
[1:43:47] You receive the Holy Ghost. The Lord
[1:43:49] leads you. He calls you.
[1:43:52] &gt;&gt; On that journey,
[1:43:55] it's just one step at a time, one battle
[1:43:58] at a time, one valley at a time.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; But praise God, he never left us.
[1:44:05] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus. And one day he come to
[1:44:07] reside inside of you.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; Well, that didn't finish the journey.
[1:44:11] You're still on that journey.
[1:44:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; But as brother Marcus was saying, as the
[1:44:16] word begins to open up, you begin to
[1:44:18] understand the journey that you've been
[1:44:20] on.
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; Lots of things you didn't understand,
[1:44:23] things we still don't understand. But
[1:44:25] praise God, we've been through the
[1:44:28] opening. By the opening of the word, we
[1:44:29] begin to see our journey. We begin to
[1:44:31] see who we are.
[1:44:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father. Yes, sir.
[1:44:34] &gt;&gt; Clarity comes in our lives. Yes, Father.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; And as the word begins to open up to
[1:44:39] you,
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; he becomes more precious to you.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[1:44:42] &gt;&gt; He becomes more dear to you.
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; What a difference, Father. Amen.
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; I thank God for our father.
[1:44:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, Father.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Jesus.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; He really spoke to me tonight. Thank God
[1:44:54] for the word.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Well, before we dismiss, we want
[1:44:59] to make sure all hearts and minds are
[1:45:00] clear tonight before we dismiss. If
[1:45:03] anybody has a need or anything,
[1:45:06] the Lord's here to meet your need. You
[1:45:08] can receive whatever you have need of
[1:45:09] right now. The word, he said he sent his
[1:45:11] word and he healed them and he delivered
[1:45:13] them from their destruction.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; The word has been preached tonight. He's
[1:45:17] here to meet your need.
[1:45:19] &gt;&gt; You just reach up and claim it.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; And if you have a need this evening,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; our brother's here and we brother Joe
[1:45:27] was singing.
[1:45:29] You re come and receive what you have
[1:45:31] need of.
[1:45:32] like these.
[1:45:35] Oh, I sing out
[1:45:38] a song.
[1:45:40] Yes, I sing out
[1:45:43] a love song to Jesus.
[1:45:51] In moments
[1:45:53] like these,
[1:45:55] oh, I lift up
[1:45:58] my hands.
[1:46:00] Yes, I lift up
[1:46:03] my hands to
[1:46:06] the Lord.
[1:46:09] Take
[1:46:16] you
[1:46:20] sing
[1:46:49] moment.
[1:46:57] Yes, I sing
[1:47:00] a song.
[1:47:03] I sing
[1:47:06] my love
[1:47:08] to Jesus.
[1:47:17] Oh, can you praise him? I lift up my
[1:47:21] hands.
[1:47:23] Yes, I lift up
[1:47:26] my hands to you.
[1:47:31] See,
[1:47:36] I love
[1:47:38] you.
[1:47:52] See
[1:47:59] you.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Can I take the liberty to ask again if
[1:48:10] somebody wants to receive the Holy Ghost
[1:48:13] if you allow?
[1:48:19] Oh, I see
[1:48:22] my
[1:48:25] sing
[1:48:29] to Jesus
[1:48:35] in moments like these.
[1:48:39] Yes, I lift up all my
[1:48:45] lift up
[1:48:48] my hands to
[1:48:51] now while the music is playing.
[1:48:55] Thank you. While the music is playing,
[1:48:57] please sit down for a moment and I ask
[1:48:59] our brother if I can take the the
[1:49:01] liberty as I'm a guest minister. While
[1:49:03] the music is softly playing, I want you
[1:49:05] to all close your eyes and please that
[1:49:08] we don't make a filming right now.
[1:49:12] And I want all of you
[1:49:15] that says, "Lord, I want the Holy Ghost
[1:49:20] or Lord, I want to come back
[1:49:24] in that estate
[1:49:27] that I can grasp things that kind of
[1:49:31] relationship to you.
[1:49:33] I want the Holy Ghost maybe for the
[1:49:35] first time of some of the youngsters see
[1:49:37] you. I don't want a religion and while
[1:49:40] all the heads are bow in respect to one
[1:49:42] another, I want you to stand up and
[1:49:44] before the presence of the Lord before
[1:49:45] all his angels and to make sure I need a
[1:49:48] father. Amen. I want you to stand up,
[1:49:56] but not that everybody stands up. Only
[1:49:58] if you know that's your calling for the
[1:50:00] moment. It's not a general thing. Okay.
[1:50:07] I'm Heavenly Father, you see the hands
[1:50:10] and the people standing.
[1:50:13] You just used a little man from Germany
[1:50:16] to speak to the hearts of these people.
[1:50:18] And the deep call to the deep. It was
[1:50:22] not We were not preaching fear this
[1:50:24] evening. We were not preaching
[1:50:27] condemnation this evening. We were not
[1:50:29] preaching judgment this evening. That
[1:50:31] has its place but not for this evening.
[1:50:34] We were just presenting the Lord Jesus
[1:50:36] Christ to be a father, a provider, a
[1:50:40] husband, a bridegroom, a friend in life.
[1:50:43] And Lord, here these people are standing
[1:50:45] and I know many of them are true
[1:50:47] believers,
