i think your mom's got just there she is got a problem with her uh with right so remember sister anna canard still remember sister rebecca with the problem and brother hal thomas keep him in your

them he lost a brother and also brother mark and gina's friend uh lady mary was in a coma was scheduled to they was scheduled to pull the plug and then her daughter talked to her and she opened her eyes so just remember mary is her name so just remember that situation it's the ones i have we want to continue to pray for all the ones that we pray for on a regular basis so just remember that i know we all have unspoken requests let's go lord in prayer heavenly father lord we thank you for letting us come out this morning lord lord be with the ones that are traveling or been traveling lord just be with them and guide them and thank you for giving us a great week lord just bless us here today be with our services and be with the sick the ones we have mentioned the ones that people have unspoken requests lord bless them also forgive us from all of our sins and we love you for your many blessings jesus name we pray amen amen you'll be god bless you saints it's good to be back in the house of the lord let's just bless the reading of the word before we get into this little study lord we're just thankful lord to be able to gather around your word once more and we just ask your blessing upon the services today lord and bless us as we study these things out we ask in your name amen so hebrews we got to hebrews 4 11 and paul was saying let us labor therefore to enter into that rest lest any man fall after the same example of unbelief and the last few sunday school lessons we were talking about what rest is and we're resting on the promises of christ and resting on his revealed word and when you get when you're as you meditate on these things when you begin to realize why paul said in hebrews 4 12 for the word of god is quick and powerful because the word is is what we're resting in and the word is what is actually active in our life and the word is what discerns where we are in our christian walk the word of god is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and mirror and as a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart you think even you know as you just reading like through the ten commandments how that the word can discern if there's something wrong in your life um you know and jesus began to magnify those ten commandments when he began to preach about how if you just if there's something wrong in your heart that would make you want to look after a woman you've committed adultery all with already with her in your heart and and and all those things because the word the word is the discerner is there something wrong with me that's why the bible says and just looking at a different translation of that scripture for the word of god is alive and active sharper than any double-edged sword that penetrates even to dividing soul and spirit joints and mirror it judges the thoughts and attitudes of the heart so the word is like it's it's it's uh like a surgeon's knife that can go in and and root out the the problem areas of your thinking and that if if there's a disease in your soul that can root that out and cut it out and begin to do surgery and i've got that picture of a of a of a pendant at center you know crying out to god leaning over the pulpit or the over the uh the chair there that the pew there because that's what the effect that the word has in a in someone's life it begins to transform them to to realize that they need something from god brother obama in the patmos vision he said now paul said that the word came in power as well as voice the word priest actually demonstrated itself like a flaming cutting sword that went to the consciences of men and like a surgeon's knife that cut out the diseases and set captives free everywhere those early believers went they went preaching the gospel and god confirmed that word with signs following the sick were healed devils were cast out and they spoke in new tongues that was the word in action that word has never failed in the mouths of believing christians and in this last age it is here stronger and greater than ever in the true word bride oh little flock you little minority hold on to the word fill your mouth and heart with it and someday god will give you the kingdom that's the word is is not something just like like a dictionary or shakespeare novel or something that we're reading it's actually something that gives us power over the devil that gives us the ability to withstand his you know when the devil begins to come to you with thoughts in your mind the word is what you hold that sword of faith out and it can block everything that the devil's sending to you the shield of faith the sword of the word and so the word is sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and the joints and mirror and brother branham said it cuts us under the carnal from the spiritual in other words you know you you listen to that sermon anointed ones at the end time and boom all of a sudden the spirit and the soul is divided and you begin to see that the difference between somebody that's just anointed in their spirit and somebody that's really at rest with their soul is somebody maybe that's hopping around in church like like paul said bodily exercise profiteth a little that's great to get anointed in the church service and run up and down the aisles but but you really want that rest down in your soul is what you're after bodily exercise profiteth a little to to jump and run and things that's great to be able to do those things and you see the word when it begins to be preached it divides asunder the soul and the spirit and the body so you know when the word is being preached it has an effect in your life and you begin to understand it gives you confidence and where you are with god cutting us under the cardinal from the spiritual and what does discern mean we cover that a little bit discern means to distinguish so when you're held up when you're faced with the mirror of god's word like i got this little picture of a man being confronted with the law with the old testament the the the ten commandments it it discerns what's in your heart it discerns where you are are you a murderer or you're a thief or you're a liar and you know that's i i love watching videos of street preachers and this is usually one of the things that street preachers will do i have a huge respect for street preachers they'll they'll hold up the law to the people on the street and it can the law will convict people because they begin to realize that if you're a liar and you're a thief or or you've done the things that the ten commandments are saying that you've ever disrespected your mama and daddy and and those kind of things that you're guilty and you need a savior and so the law that's what the word is doing it's discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart now maybe the preacher doesn't even know what's going on in somebody's life but all they're doing is holding up the word to the situation and hope when you hold the word up that begins to discern and in that person's life that there's something wrong so the the preacher is not doing the judging the the word is doing the judging the preacher is not uh doing the discerning necessarily but the the the word is the one the thing that's doing the judging the discerning and discern means to distinguish is it right or not is it righteous or not are you righteous or not and what what the word is it's like a light like a flashlight that shines on the situation as soon as the light comes on you know you go into an old house and you turn the light on and the cockroaches begin to scatter because that's what the you know brother brown priest sermon there's a man here that can turn on the light there's darkness where your your mind is veiled to the truth but when the word is preached then that that's that's the power of the gospel that it can take that veil from over your eye and because you begin to see things to to see uh to see the word as it really is through thy precepts i get understanding david said therefore i hate every false way thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my path like that story that brother brahm told of the little man that was walking home from church and he held his lantern out in front of him because uh and brother brown asked him how are you going to get home i just i just take one step at a time that's how the word is the word you know you know even in your christian journey when you start when you're born again you don't really know where the end of the journey is but you just keep stepping and stepping until the stature of perfect man begins to open up the capstone begins to open up and you know then and it opens up because you just put one step in front of the other walking and walking by the light of god's word and the light of god's word is so powerful that it can it it everything is is exposed to god paul paul said in in verse 13 neither is there any creature that does not manifest in his sight but all things are naked and open under the eyes of him with whom we have to do and you think about it that god knows everything everything about every kind of how much talon that is ever going to have in his eye how many times a mosquito is going to bat his wings he knows the nature of a dove and he knows the nature of that thing way down in the bottom of the sea that that has a little like that that picture of those scary things down in the bottom of the sea and he he knows what is is as good or great in your heart he knows what's horrible in your heart sitting here this morning he knows whether down in your down in your soul you're righteous or down in your soul you need a redeemer right now everything is exposed to him yes so paul said seeing then seeing that we have a great high priest that is passed into the heavens after he's laid out all of these things we've got this great high priest that has passed into the heavens jesus the son of god let us hold fast our profession now paul talked about your confession a little bit in hebrews chapter three but i just want to reiterate that because this is each one of those little things that paul says is so packed with goodness and richness it's like it's like eating just a rich cake it's so full of good things uh and you know whole fast our profession you think about put put this image in your mind that we've got a high priest and he's seated in the throne of our heart and he's waiting on us to take god's word and then to speak it and to say i believe i believe what has already been spoken i believe what god like what god said i believe what the the uh the prophet of this day said i believe what paul said and when you speak it it it something begins to happen speaking profession and brother roman said that profession and confession are really the same thing but when you speak you're you're speaking based on what you believe when you believe it and you speak it something begins to change and where are you speaking from you're speaking from your heart and you know whatever whatever's in your heart is going to come out of your mouth if you got if you if your heart is filled up with evil things and out of out of that evil heart is is going to come evil things that's why that's why you know believers we don't we don't believe in in cussing and swearing and doing all those kind of things like the people in the world do because that's coming from that's evil conversation coming out of an evil heart but when your heart is transformed out of that that transformed heart is going to come treasures and and a good confession and and a confession where you you're saying all things are possible to them that believe you're saying victory is mine you're saying that uh god uh he's gonna restore everything back from what they what they lost back down through the seven church age you're gonna say things like that that's why matt in matthew chapter 12 jesus said oh generation of vipers how can you being evil speak good things how can you being evil speak good things for out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaketh amen a good man out of the good treasure of the heart bringeth forth good things and an evil man out of the evil treasure bringeth forth evil things now how you want to get good treasure in your heart is you pack it in by reading the bible so you're packing your oat as we unpack these scriptures these these are like treasures to us and you pack it into your heart now you've got something that you can speak that you can live off of when when trials come and troubles come you could quote back you can speak back that uh he's the same yesterday today and forever he was wounded for my transgressions whatever whatever life throws at you you speak back from your heart knowing that god is able brother braham said and accept god's gift he said now when you believe you were saved setting in your seed out in the wherever you was you accepted it and began to confess and tell people you were saved well you kept on saying i'm saved the people said there ain't no difference in you but you believe there was see now you got that pact in your heart because why do you believe it is because the bible says it and you got it packed in your heart now you're speaking from that treasure he said is that right and you kept with your confession and after a while it worked righteousness all your neighbors and everybody knows you're saved now because you believed it you confessed it why what happened what changed you he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father making good what you're confessing is making good what you speak brother ram said he's sitting at the right hand of the father to make good anything that we confess that he has done he died on the cross for my sins he paid the price for my salvation he's already done it but you got to speak it so you pack it in your heart and you believe it and then you speak it he cannot do nothing for us until first we confess that he has done it and act upon it he can't do not one thing for us till we accept it and say that we have accepted it and believe it and testify of it i i just ran through and and pulled out all these things just in one it just kind of lumped them together that brother ram said about your confession he said god can't do nothing to you till first you confess that he is then when you confess it then believe it act upon it and stay with it and god will bring you out he said jesus christ is sitting at the right hand of the father to accept you for he's sitting there the high priest of your confession to make good before the father anything that he died for that you're confessing that he done every sinner is saved tonight in the sight in the sight of jehovah god but will never do you any good until you accept it and believe it and confess it and then he's the high priest of your confession to make it right before god jesus is the high priest of your confession whatever you confess that he's doing he'll do whatever you say and three kinds of believers brother said we haven't got no thought coming it's what he said now if i read in the bible what you say it and i believe it and then i speak it something's got to happen he said you deny your own thinking that means if the if you see the cloudy skies and the winds and the waves going everywhere it doesn't matter if you see your children leaving and sickness in your home it doesn't matter all that matters is what god said you just say what he says that's really confession confession means to say the same thing if i confess that a certain thing taken place i say the same thing that taken place that's what real confession is and he's the high priest of our confession see saying the same thing god said see that makes it right because you're just repeating god's word of course you know how do you know what to say if you don't get in the word and you see why god's bringing us up you start off speaking from a baby you start i said you come out of the egg but you don't really know what to say and then the words get packed in the word gets packed in until god brings you to a place where he can open the seals and really open the word up to you and then you're getting to a place where you know what god wants done with the word you know whether god wants to fill people with the holy ghost and you know how things begin to work and so you're coming to a place where you know how to speak it you started from an egg see wherever you are you come out of that egg just like like an eagle does like you know like we stood it out in the greatest battle ever fought you come out that eagle comes out with its mouth and that's how you come out with your mouth by speaking by what you say and accept god's gift brother brown said now healing is not something that you just say well i yeah i believe it i believe it now that's all right if that's the best you can do just mentally or just say well yeah i see it i believe that i accept it then if you accept it on this basis keep saying it over and over say it out loud say it over and over just keep saying i'm healed i'm healed say it until actually you believe it and when you believe it then it's going to take place don't have a negative testimony every time when you confess well i still feel bad today i guess i you go right straight back in the same rut that you was in the beginning there's not a man or a woman in here that is baptized with the holy spirit but what would start your confession i believe i've lost the spirit i believe it's gone for me i believe you'll go right down listen close you'll never live above your confession that's a that's a pretty weighty statement that you'll never live above your confession so if we want to go high let's keep our confession high that i believe god is with us i believe he ain't left us i believe he's here in the building this morning i believe that the bible says that he's nigh you that the word is even in your mouth that you don't have to go running around looking for him that he's here and you you speak that and something will begin to change that's why romans chapter 10 says but the righteousness which is of faith speaketh isn't that interesting that you use those words that faith speaks on this wise say not in thine heart who shall ascend into heaven that is the being cry christ down from above or who shall ascend into the deep that is to bring up christ again from the dead but what sayeth it the word is nighty even in thy mouth you've already packed the word into your heart i just speak it and then that is the word of faith which we preach preach that if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and shall believe in thine heart that god hath raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with the heart man believeth unto and unto righteousness and with the mouth confession is made unto salvation for the scripture saith whosoever believeth on him shall not be ashamed you're not going to be ashamed after this word is packed into your heart to say i believe it to testify to your co-workers to testify to your friends to share the gospel when when bad things come your way to say i believe that god is still with me because his word says it is says he is even in first john john said hereby know you the spirit of god of god every spirit that confesseth that speaks that revelation a present tense revelation amen that jesus christ is come in the flesh is of god that's how you know that's how you can discern is every spirit that speaks to a present tense revelation of jesus christ and every spirit that confesseth not that jesus christ has come in the flesh is not of god and this is that spirit of antichrist wherever you have heard that it should come and even now already is in the world and hebrews 11 that we're making our way to said by him therefore let us offer the sacrifice of praise to god continually what's the sacrifice of praise the fruit of your lips the fruit of your lips is your sacrifice of praise giving thanks to his name now i i think it's so so interesting that even from from your very first the the very beginning of your christian journey you're going to start out speaking you know so many times when brother branham would uh when he would baptize somebody he would just if you go back and study out the way he would baptize somebody he would he would he would weave in there that is he's doing it upon their confession you know think about the stories of where brother ryan would say that that one lady she said i want to be dunked and he said you're not you're not ready to be baptized because what kind of confession did she have that's right maybe look back in your own journey i remember growing up i hear people say well i'm i i i yeah i think it would be cool to be baptized and just thinking in myself i i i don't know if you understand what it is so when you understand what you're doing and you have a confession that i believe jesus christ died for my sins and you you're going down in the water based on that confession you see when you come up something's going to happen and you look at all these places where brother ram would he said upon your confession these are places where he's baptizing somebody upon your confession of your faith and your consecration to our lord i baptist baptize thee my beloved sister upon your confession of the son of god i baptize and baptize thee so then i said in another place he said upon your confession of your faith upon your confession of your sins and your faith in the son of god i baptize thee my beloved brother in the name of the lord jesus christ i said that's the way i baptized he's baptized because of your confession your confession matters amen when you're going down in the water speaking something that you know why you're there and it's not just because somebody told you to go or because that something's happened in your heart and you believe and you're speaking it and that's this there was this little brother uh edward colvin was the 17th person that brother brown was baptizing there on the river on the ohio river and look at the way that he he said he baptized him he said edward do you know what i'm doing now i am baptizing you see he's asking him do you know what i'm doing because if you know something something it changes everything i said i'm baptizing you showing you to show into this audience out here that you've accepted christ as your personal savior when i baptize you in the name of jesus christ you take on his name you rise for a new life and when you leave here you're to walk a new life do you understand that edward and he said i do bow your head and he said heavenly father as this young man has confessed his faith in you see he's speaking out what he's been packing in and as thou has commissioned to us to go into all the world and preach the gospel and and so forth and he went on and baptized him and that light came down out of heaven and and a voice spoke as john the baptist for run i this his message this message will full run my second coming so brother branham said well we're going on to the next scripture for we have a verse 15 for we have a high priest we've got a high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like we we are like as we are yet without sin and brother i'm saying how can i overcome temptation was for him you know that the bible said he was tempted in all points like we are yet without sin he was tempted by drinking and in other words he he he knows what we're going through no matter what your place in life we've got somebody that's touched by the feelings of our infirmities that that realizes that our predicament in life yes he was tempted by women he was tempted by everything that could be tempted by he was tempted by everything that we are he was a man and yet you couldn't put a mark on him in verse 15 for we have not in high priest which cannot be touched with the feelings of our infirmities but was in all points tempted like as we are yet without sin let us therefore come boldly unto the throne of grace that we may obtain mercy and find grace to help in time of need we've got a high priest that has given us rest that is now laboring within us that that uh that understands what we're going through a high priest that's packing us full of of good treasures from his word so why not come boldly if you have need of anything if his word says that you have access to something let's speak it and go forward and come boldly yeah and brother in hebrews chapter five and six that message they preached and we'll be closing there in just a moment he said these five first five chapters are positionally placing jesus as high priest god in sundry times and divers manners spake to the fathers through the prophets but in this last day through his son jesus then on down to the ending up of the fifth chapter we find him represented as melchizedek who had no beginning of days no ending of your life but continually a priest forever think of who was this great man we'll get it in about two more chapters the entire life of him we're going to study this great man who met abraham who never had any papa never had any mama he never had any time he ever begin life or he never will have a time that he will ever in life and he met abraham coming from the slaughters of the king so he's he's positionally placed jesus christ as the high priest and where is he at he's he's working in the throne of your heart now picture this picture of this crowd the old testament high priest now he's he's he's he's he's taken your confession the high priest of your confession and he's working with it he's making it bring it to pass in your life doing something enthroned on your heart as we read through hebrews the first part of hebrews 5 before we close here he said in hebrews 5 for every high priest taken from among men as ordained for men and things pertaining to god that he may offer both gifts and sacrifices for sins who can have compassion on the ignorant and on them that are out of the way for that he himself also is compassed with infirmity and by reason hereof he all is for the people so also for himself to offer for sins and no man taketh his honor unto himself but he that is called of god as was aaron so also christ glorified not himself to be made in high priest but he that said unto him thou art my son today have i begotten thee as he sayeth also in another place thou art a priest forever after the order of melchizedek the musicians can go ahead and come forward who in the days of his flesh when he had offered up prayers and supplications with strong crying and tears unto him that was able to save him from death and was hurt and that he feared though he were a son yet learned he obedience by the things which he suffered and being made perfect he became the author of eternal salvation of all them that obey him call of god and high priest after the order of melchizedek of whom we have many things to say and hard to be uttered seeing ye are dull of hearing for when the time you ought for when for the time you ought to be teachers you have need that one teach you again which be the first principles of the oracles of god and that becomes such as have need of milk and not of strong meat for everyone that useth milk is unskillful in the word of righteousness for he is a babe but strong meat belongeth to them that are of full age even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil god bless you so you
