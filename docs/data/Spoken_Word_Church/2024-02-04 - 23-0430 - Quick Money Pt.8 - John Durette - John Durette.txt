========================================

amen you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning amen praise the lord well it's it's my uh my lot once again by the grace of the Lord and everybody's back for more so praise the Lord by the grace of the lord we were going to talk about financial Jubilee and talking about conform and um you know certainly as we've been talking about financial Jubilee you know I I trust by God's grace that you you're making progress you know in your life wherever you are whatever season whatever point you are in your life and um you know often I I I want to talk about practical things things literal things you could do but it's very important we understand why you know because you could be motivated you could be charged up and I'm I got it but if you don't know why it's going to eventually evaporate so it's very important to know why why why is this important why is this important even the word of God that we've been hearing for so many years you why why and um hopefully by the grace of the lord we can throw some practical things in here as well but let's just go to the Lord in prayer Lord Jesus we thank you this morning Lord once again to together in your name father with your people Lord Jesus we don't take it for granted and we pray Lord God that you just bless this little Sunday school teaching Lord God may it go to the Heart Lord God may it produce results Lord Jesus oh God in all of our Lives Lord Jesus Lord God may we be able to see it Lord Jesus as a just a map Lord God to help us with the the more precious promises Lord that you have for all of us father we commit this day into your hands bless the entire service Lord Jesus we commit it in your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen praise the lord we go to the next slide so always remember no matter how long they had been in bondage or how long they were supposed to stay there when the Year of Jubilee when the year come of Jubilee when the trumpet sounded every man could go free if he wanted to go free so you can see right there if if it depends on what we want to do if we want to go free if we want these promises then we can we just need to understand we need to understand and we need to have that fight that we talked about we got to have that strength to keep fighting to keep pressing every day it doesn't stop no matter what season of life we're in you continue fighting and learning what God wants us to learn then we can be a good example to those under us that's coming up so continue to fight next slide so when we talk about conform conform it means with the word con means with together mean basically to adopt the form of those around us to be similar or identical to be in agreement or Harmony to be obedient or compliant usually used with to conform to another's wishes to act in accordance with prevailing standards or customs basically it means you go with the flow that's the easy way to say it I'm going with the flow and that's exactly what water does water goes wherever is the easiest path it flows right in it'll fit whatever container whatever mold you decide to put it in it will fit and certainly you know coming up with financial Jubilee with me I mean that's what I did I mean although I was born again God changed my life in 1999 I was born again but with finances I didn't know I just didn't know I wasn't taught I I didn't understand it so I was just going with the flow of the world and I was learning so many things that the world has a lot to teach you now believe me it'll teach you all kind of tricks to the trade and my goodness I thought I was just going with it but truly what I was used to I was just used to the form used to the normal flow of the world what they did you know if they happen to have a little money what did they do they spend everything that comes in and so I was doing the same thing I was used to thinking that way I was used to applying my life that way you know just like if you think about a slave and that's typically what the world wants us to be with finances to be just slaves to the world just flow with it don't challenge it don't question it hey if you can get a house with a mortgage praise God thank God you got that loan that's what you Lord I got approved praise the Lord don't matter what the interest rate is you know that's that's thinking like the world that's what it does I can pay all my bills well have you looked at your bills have you questioned them have you said Lord God is this what you want me to be doing so thinking and challenging that getting out of just the form but I was used to that thinking like a slave of course until as brother Louis brought out until God set me up amen he set me up and this is why I'm here today because he set me up and I was just going we were happy oh praise God going with it and then God told me me know let's go to the next Slide the word of God as we talked about conform you can't help but see this scripture and it says and be not conformed to this world but be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God so we know conform means just to go with the flow but there is an intense pressure in this day to conform period doesn't matter what age you are it doesn't matter who you are doesn't matter if you're born again there is a pressure to conform it's so strong you have people with intelligent minds they will call black white white black a girl a boy a boy a girl anything that's the pressure such an intense pressure and and and that's what we will we will just go with the flow but God is saying we have to be transformed in order to get these principles in order for us to get up that statue of a perfect man we have to to be transformed in our minds that mean we have to be changed a different form that picture on the previous slide you saw water there was Water Ice and there was steam so we have to be changed completely in how we're thinking about our finances thinking oh Lord this is just a little map of the greater promises that you have Lord this is where it's a part that I have to do and it's a part that you do Lord you provide my needs but you're asking me to be a steward of this Lord God you have given me these precious promises but it's me I have to be diligent I have to pray and read my Bible every day I have to continue doing that there's a part that you have to play and as we pay play that part then you see God start to move you start understanding oh Lord this is what you're doing and the Devil he's so tricky that's why I have that yes and no because the devil he is like a yes yes seems good and God is like no and that's a shock it's a shock to your system that God will say no no you can't have it no you're not ready for it no you don't need it and the Devil comes along and says well yes you can sure I have a way for you and he's been doing that from the very beginning something as simple as just to know the Garden of Eden there you go God said no you can't eat of that tree the devil says well you can you can do it you actually can there you go then Cain and Abel you know Cain says hey this is what I want this is what I want to offer Satan says if can you do it the best you can God said no no I'm not accepting that that that's a rejection it's like Brother Lou brought I just like no why is he saying no and it's the same thing today you could directly apply that to finances if you don't have the money if you don't have the money and you feel in urged to borrow that is God's way of saying no you're not ready you're not ready for it why don't you have the money CU I'm just telling you no you're not ready but the devil's going to come along and says yes you can there's many ways you can do it many ways you can do it you see and we go down that path it's easy and then we start conforming thank the Lord for this loan and you hear brother say that you hear sisters say that you're like well I'm going go apply for my loan thank the Lord the Lord is good we conforming in the church everybody's just getting their loans we just happy celebrating with our loans conforming just going with it not even thinking about it and that's exactly what was happening in my life just going with the flow just not even thinking about it the devil saying yes you can yes you got it Oh my he is something and he's always applied that and no gets really deep no gets really deep I was talking with my wife just driving in you know it gets so deep that it can break your faith if you're not careful you know we have expectations of what we think things should happen things should be this way things should go according to my plan my I remember raising kids and before we had kids and we would see the other couples with their little kids and we're like soon as we get our kids our kids going to listen they going to sit still we got this I'm telling you how can they let their kids keep slamming the door we're like what in the world our kids going and I would hold somebody else kid like see I held him quiet for 3 minutes I got this I'm telling you when my kids come along my goodness and I you know I man I thought I was good even when they became teenagers I'm like I got we I know if I just talk right they're gonna get it the Lord like uhuh no I'mma keep you on your knees period you know and that's what he does we have expectations who might be your friend who might not be friendly even when we pray we have expectations like Lord You're Going to heal them you're going to do it God says no no no no no no no no not this time why because he has a plan he has a greater plan he's writing a story he's writing a strip as our brother brought out he's writing a play so he has to say no to his children so we can go along and fit his plan right so he says no and all we have to do is realize just as our brother brought out like Lord you just have something greater for me help me to keep that Faith Lord and in every area he's trying to do that but finances is just a area that he's given us that we can start looking at it he says no to something because you don't have the money that doesn't mean go away disappointed said Lord all right Lord then you must have something better you must have a better plan Lord help me to stay there and keep walking and you'll see what he does but the devil has done so much to just get us locked in and as we talk about Conformity of course you got the internet it's just loaded with conforming and pressuring us to conform I was reading something about the internet it said you know what happens we get an idea in our minds and all of the social media comes in right and it entrenches you into your very idea it locks you into your idea so it's harder for you to come out just like ice you fit it in and then you freeze it and that's what he's trying to do freeze our thoughts you want this car he'll show you all kind of images of it bo bo Boop popping up you search once now you got it every moment here's the same car you know you want it hey next thing you know you're get an advertisement for a loan everything just oh my God he's just pouring it and he's always done this but now he's just doing it in Greater intensity greater intensity because he wants to entrench us lock us into a certain form go to the next slide as I said you know this was me this was was a standard and I I we set out by God's grace I shared a little bit of the testimony last last time how you know we were going to nor normal going with the flow and um my goodness you know all the money came in I started saying how much house can I get to the max and uh we got that 40-year loan and uh should have been in bondage just thinking about my brother we the the road that we lived on was called bond avenue that should have told me something bond avenue yes we were locked in for 40 years it was supposed to be that's why Jubilee doesn't matter how long you're supposed to be I was supposed to be in bondage for 40 years but God set me up that business we were were doing great the first house we sold my brother and I you know we were just smart we got $1,000 about $10,000 profit oh man we were like yes praise God I was really imagining Lord you the next one you're going to bless me I'm going to be able to pay cash for a car cuz you're going to bless me while we were borrowing money we had access to borrow a whole bunch of money for these properties and man I was thought Lord this is how you going to work it out Lord you're so wonderful lord said nope no no matter of fact I'm going to say the entire economy in real estate Just For You John my goodness we started seeing that economy go down my goodness money going out the door my my my but we turned around and said Lord you must have something better because Lord I have paid my tithes I have not tried to do anything wrong and I started seeking God and as I sought God we started focusing all we lost ton of money paid it off but as I started learning the principles of God I started questioning what I had done Lord this house I question it I paid off all that business debt accepted that challenge paid it off and I started looking at our house and challenging myself like Lord something something's wrong and this is when I started looking at okay man I borrowed two loans for the house we owed about 300 something thousand but if I just paid that 40 years it's going to cost me $800,000 I did not sign up for that so we challenged that we started taking God's principles and applying them as we read it in the Bible I mean and we would be up I would just be looking at I start talking to my wife about it like I I didn't know these things I didn't know these things I I didn't know but Lord God since I had paid off that business loan I started seeing Lord if I just took what you taught me there and I just applied it directly to my house now now when I'm saying apply it that means there's sacrifices there's things that are happening I'm not going with the flow anymore it's hard we every Sunday we be out to eat every I mean that this was us you know we would just buy whatever we want to we didn't think about it you said but now I started pausing like hold on wait a second what's going on and I took the principles of God so we're going to bring out the principles once again let's go to the next slide so I started learning all right God owns it all the 10% tides are his and the 90% okay that's another no if if you're not hearing it that means a 90% is not yours to say yes to everything it's no it don't belong to you just like your tithes you need to ask God lord what would you have me to do with this father what do you want me to do with it don't go with the world the world will say hey you got 90% especially the younger people leverage that do this do that do this now you better ask God lord what would you have me to do with it manage his resources diligent you have to be diligent you can't just go like water flow with it God has given you money for a reason right a reason you have a job you have assets you have this for a reason you have to manage his resources and it doesn't have to be deep you can take anything to start managing his resources start somewhere write it down on a napkin a piece of paper what am I spending every month today is the end of the month right at it you got a whole month of May write down what you think your expenses are what do you think you're going to spend you know you got rent or bills you electric gas you know how much do you think you spend on food write that down that'll give you an idea okay Lord you given me $3,000 to to take care of my myself for this month I know I make 4,000 you know okay I do I got my ties and things like that Lord I I really if I do this month at the end of next month I should have $500 that means I got my food I got this I should have $500 left at the end of next month and see what happens now if you write it down and you're like Lord look like I'm going to be short 2,000 then you might want to pause and say Lord okay let let me really think about what's going to happen next month can I cut out something doesn't have to be fancy you're just asking God to help you and he will continue to build on it that's what he's doing he's building on the promises that we have step by step so take that be diligent remember money is still your time you're working if you throw that hour away D it's like you're taking your life for granted you're taking it for granted so it should be worth something to you remember patience we got to learn to wait that is so important learn to wait God just has something better he doesn't want you to rush out just because you have it don't mean you rush out to it some of those older ones you're retired you got money you may have more assets through life that means you may have to wait on for your grandchild a little bit longer you know I'm not going to do it right away let me see how this little girl is acting or how this little boy is acting you know is he acting good remember those parents are raising those grandchildren you know they know you know that child may be walking around like I get whatever I want granddad's going to get it for me you know you might need to put a little plug Granddad just give it a little time you know we know it's a season you get to enjoy remember they're in a season as well and they're in a terrible season with ton of influence and they do live in a society where they think it's all yes all yes you tell them no they'll say hey there's a way that's just for you daddy that's just for you Mom but there is a yes for me and so we have to make sure we're laid we're showing them how to wait because God is going to ask us to wait and God is going to say no why because it's not our plan it's not my plan he has a plan so he's going to say no to them and we don't want his no to cause them to walk away from the faith that's right amen so that's so important that we help them to understand like no and hold to those no I know it's hard I got kids you know we've been blessed you know we've been really blessed I know it by the grace of the Lord you know but I know God we got to help him we can say yes to every single thing that they want and whatever they want we saying yes yes yes no it's like Lord they got to hear from you if they think that then they're going to feel entitled and the minute God says no to them they're going to say well see the devil got me he has me he going to take care of me and they're going to go that route next Slide the blessings of the Lord it maketh the rich and he had is no sorrow to it that is nothing but the truth avoid debt avoid it God wants to bless us he wants to do it but we got to do it in his time and we got to learn to wait he is a good father believe me he will hold to his no he really will and he'll let you pay the price if you decide to do it that's a good father for you save for the winter remember it's coming save don't spend everything you got that's God saying just because you got it don't mean you give it all out today save a little bit of that look at the ant he's saying no you can't spend it all the best investment is giving giving that's some of that he wants you to give we know our tithes but it's also more than that it's giving and of course it's learning contentment that means you start learning how to say no yourself to yourself you start learning how to say no like Lord I'm going to say no next Slide by the grace of the Lord as I said when we paid off that debt and this is just to me I I believe this with no doubt after we paid that debt it was 2016 2015 that's when I you know I got some money I got a little bonus on the job after we paid off that debt and I didn't just buy what I wanted I knew we had that debt so I took that money I threw it on our mortgage and I started getting little chunks out of it like okay thank God and a little bit after that contined did that in 205 2015 paid a little bit more things started happening at the job they say okay we're going to let you start traveling internationally went overseas on my birthday 2016 lot more of the house was going I was feeling the momentum they said hey we're closing down to Maryland 2017 when we paid off that house it was 5 months later this is the truck that pulled up with the eagle on the side that packed us from Maryland to Georgia we were debt free by the grace of the Lord so had I waited for 40 years would I be coming down here in 47247 so praise God he has a plan for all of this but he by his grace on those e Eagle wings I like to say brought us down here after we were debt free praise the Lord Jesus next slide that's why I think our Prophet says it so much and I hope as you're hearing debt we talk about debt but it's really about cleaning up your lives it's cleaning your lives up it's handling your life like Joseph just being organized diligent about what's happening in your life and our Prophet says clean your lives up pay your debts oh no man Jesus said get all things off your hand get everything right Make Ready Get Ready remember in the name of the Lord something is fixing to happen my my my that is the word of God spoken to us by that prophet in 19 1965 think about how long that has been for us to have these words so it's clean your lives up let's get everything right that's what God is saying get it right he's waiting on us he is waiting on us to get ready so by God's grace let's take these little practical things and apply them to our life right above that before he said this he said and what are we coming here for what are we doing are we coming here playing a game are we coming here here meeting as a lodge it's Christ it's it's Christ can't come until the church is perfectly right he's waiting on us that's verse 283 so you can see what it means clean up your lives right in there he's saying get it right get organized make ready we are God has gifted us with the talents to do all these things and we can do it by the grace of the Lord Jesus just start somewhere start somewhere he will add to to it next slide let's keep going to the next one so yes and no Prophet just said so many words he said don't you see where the commercial word had commercial world has your nose to the Grind wheel said don't you see it said the world is full of it full of it advertisements television radio newspapers and if the American people fall for such as that and if the American people fall for such as that just falling for it the devil's deceiving us us with all of this yes yes yes yes yes you can do whatever you want you can have whatever you want it's a way you can literally think and do and be whatever you want to be and God in his word is like there's a plan I got something better for you let's go to as we wrap up I want to just share this testimony I know I shared it a little bit let's go to slide 15 keep going keep going this is my dad you know and uh of course my dad was in the message and I'm still in the message by God's grace been through many many battles God told him no many many times and he still pressing on by the grace of the Lord Jesus this was last month when my brother was down and we I shared a little bit of a testimony how my dad the place he was renting the landlord said no he has to go so we spent so much time trying to find the best thing for him we went to mon Georgia he still goes to a church down there and making Georgia so we thought maybe we' go down there so I spent all day looking for him I spent weeks but I spent a whole day we went down there trying to find a home for him by God's grace we were going to buy the house cash by God's grace but we asking God is this your will sought a nice house perfect house we wern't sure if this the best thing for him but we like Dad praying to God lord if this is the best then let it come through we put a contract the house has been available for like it was like I think a month or two the day we put it in got the contract put it in they called and said no it was already bought

time we've spent months and months my dad said he's been looking for two years you know we've been looking time is running out last thing we could do would meet with the landlord that we knew for years just plead with him basically we don't have an option we're done we've looked everywhere every single thing we could do any help from the government is going to take a longer period of time anything so we met met with him my brother came down as you saw him come down we met with him had lunch with the landlord cuz he knew us 25 years ago he hadn't seen my brother so he's really excited to see my brother see us together we met with him had lunch I'm like Gary you going to bring it up you need you need to bring up the the question my brother's like just just wait wait for a little bit we'll do it outside after we finish eating went outside he talked to the landlord he said well you know we we've done everything we can everything we can and we just need a little bit more time basically what are you saying the landlord said no I mean it was like shock I'm like we will buy the house from you you want to sell it anyway we will buy it's like no he has to be out this week I mean by the end of the month he has to be out I mean you standing shocked stunned like all right he said okay great to see you guys great to see you we walked away we walked toward the veh said well God must have something better must have something better I said well let's go bu this house this um this uh this it's called a a personal care home that they told us months before they've gone out of business so we didn't even think that was an option I said let's just go by maybe we can talk to the lady she seemed really nice I was actually thinking about other things she was going out of business I'm like it'd be great to hear about her business so we decided to go by there's no other options we're done we don't know what to do but we go by we knock on the door she come to the door we start saying yeah well when you go out of business and she's like well tell me what's going on she said well tell me about your dad come on in my dad moved in there couple weeks later he's been there by the grace of the Lord getting the best care really enjoying putting on weight all of of that amen amen amen praise the Lord our Prophet said he said but you see what it is a musician just can come on up I said but you see what it is it's God it's God and His Mercy providing sometime a thing gets real low where we wonder how it's going to be that's let just accepting God's know accept it it seems like it's impossible but God has already provided he just holds it up there drawing interest on it you see to give it to you God has a better plan and he know that he has he just have a better plan for you God bless you all
