you Lord holy holy holy holy holy holies holy holy holy I want to see you heaven if you want to see him turn around shake his hand and God bless you good to have you in the house of the Lord tonight good to be here good to have my voice back I feel like a visiting preacher why do you have Daddy do this all the time it's so told Joe and them you just call us up like he used to brother boy it's like a visiting preacher okay Lord bless every one of you brother uh dick you okay you feeling better I am here okay all right just keep praying for brother dick I heard for him every time he walks off of that stage okay uh and truly I do I do a hurt for him I was uh watching somebody yesterday walk down the road um I went to get my license renewed or motorcycle license renewed and I was into calling this man gets out of a car and it must have been he must have been with his dad and his dad was probably in his 80s and and he had a cane in one hand in one of those three fingered things and the other other hand and he could just barely walk but you could see the generation of the dad and the and the Sun and you and when I see that I've grown because because I see that's what sin done that's what sin done sin has taken all of us taken these bodies and just broke them down and and you know it's uh we're going to talk about a little bit tonight but it's put a lot of people in Despair and and you know it's pain and suffering that we see in this world that that thank God we're not going to be around for the real pain and suffering when uh when the Rapture comes but uh it's going to happen and it's going to be a a harsh time but thank God he's going to take us out of that and uh put us into a into like we were talking in the back in an astronaut condition you know you can you can 300 people can ride in an airplane that's easy but only two or three can get in a spaceship only two or three because they're pressurized for the job there's not a big ship for pressurized for 300 and some people it's a small group of people fear not little flock so it's going to be the little flock that's going to be pressurized for the condition of the hour so good to be in the house of the Lord I want to tell you why we're at it that those of you that are going to The Father's Day um um camping trip next Thursday Friday and Saturday we need to meet Sunday afternoon after the second service just to get all of our ducks in a row this will be number five or six so we should kind of know what's going on but we really still need to know who's going to be there Thursday to help set up who's going to be there to cook who's going to be there to do these things because it should not be the burden of one person to do it all and it has not been everybody's helped and we've had a real real good time so after the second service we stand around talk for an hour anyway so let's meet for about 15 minutes downstairs just to make sure that we get our license and all those things so uh just keep us in your prayers those of you that are not going I wish you all would come uh I really wish you would come on Friday night just just to eat and fellowship with us that evening it would be I think it would be a joy to see the kids and and see the atmosphere of of what we do up there so just keep us in your prayers though if you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of John and this is going to be kind of strange tonight but I'm a strange guy in light of thank you brother Chris in light of in light of things that have been going on you know around the message of the hour and the reason I made that analogy about the the spaceship versus the the airplane because uh the message people are going to start out by by millions and it's going to dwindle down to almost nothing that's just the way I see it and and in light of uh and tonight I'm going to call some names because if if they can go on YouTube and if they can voice their opinion and they can put it out to the world I'm going to call their name okay because it's something that I know this church is prepared for we've been pressurized but I I would I would suggest that you maybe go on YouTube and look up Jeff Jenkins and see what he's saying now that he's not a pastor of a message church and just see what he's saying about the things that are wrong and and the things that he has uh encountered and the brother just needs prayer he just needs prayer but but in light of the things that he's brought up I I've been thinking on this and even last Sunday downstairs this is going to connect with the Statue of a perfect man because actually brother Branham after he preached statue of a perfect man that morning he preached a god of my life that afternoon all right so I believe it was real fitting and then he preached Blasphemous names a couple of weeks after that to really solidify the statue of a perfect man but I believe it's one of the most ill-taught subjects is the statue of a perfect man and it's a requirement like brother Dale said and like even brother Brown said it's a requirement you're required to have these things and we'll read we'll read a quote about that in just a little while but here in John 16 I want to thank you for your prayers the Miami trip went really well we had a couple of things happen that that was uh phenomenal and outstanding uh we had one sister that uh actually I was reading one uh Friday night I guess it was I read now to Acts 19 well I flipped the Bible open and there laid my prayer cloth and everybody was kind of looking on the front row and I explained to them that that's why we kept in Acts 19 we kept those prayer claws because that was from you know from Paul and after the service one sister comes up and she says I have a rash from she had it from here up to here see I've been having it for a long time so she said I'd like to have one of those prayer cloths I said sure not a problem so we laid the prayer cloth on her hand prayed gave her the prayer cloth well she came back the next night and it was gone so so we thank God for that we wanted to when we left we didn't say anything about it but I asked God I said perform a miracle just perform a miracle somewhere in the service just perform a miracle just to help the people and you know what helped me that I was there at the right time okay and then also we had uh we were in in the fellowship hall and a brother took a picture of me and another brother and there was a cloud that was shown behind us and it was really they rejoiced over it whether you know I I don't put a lot on that but but they did so so it really helped them understand that that maybe we were in the right place at the right time doing the right thing okay so it's just a Vindication for the people I knew I was but they have to know that that we were all in the same place together so it was a wonderful meeting we had a good time most of you know I lost my voice for about four or five days after that but it is back so you can either say oh me or praise God one or two but tonight we're gonna look at my guide and let's fire heads I love this scripture here family father we pray Lord tonight that you would be with us in a special way father just take care of us you know the thoughts on our heart Lord we've been thinking about for the past two or three days Lord and we pray that you would get it to the people Lord as it was given and it's your bless us Lord be an active participant in the service you be the speaker Lord you be the hearer Lord you'll be the ones that you be the one that takes over and not be one Lord of recording of our thoughts and ideas but Lord be the one that is preeminent in a service we actually just heal the sick and Afflicted Lord you said you sent a word and healed them delivering them from their destruction so Lord as the word Goes Forth we pray if there'll be a need tonight Lord that someone would just reach out and receive that healing father we ask your blessings on each one forgive us of our sins and many mistakes that we make against you every day Lord but we trust in you that we were chosen in you before the foundation of the world and we look to you father the author and finisher of our faith we ask you blessings on each one in Jesus name amen John 16 verse 7. so nevertheless I tell you the truth it is expedient for you that I go away for if I go not away the comforter will not come unto you but if I depart I will send him unto you and when he has come now that's a person that he right so it's a person he's sending a person back like brother Dale's always saying it the new birth is a person that's what he's showing you right here it's a person that's coming to you all right and when he has come he will reprove the world of sin and of righteousness and of Judgment of sin because they believe not on me of righteousness because I go to my father and you see me no more of judgment because the prince of this world is judged I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now why they didn't have the Holy go right right they didn't have the discerner they didn't have the one they didn't have the guide they were just all running wild you know they they were they were even running wild until the upper room they left him at at Pilots Hall and they were not there at the crucifixion and they were just running like a bunch of scared people but on the day of Pentecost they come out the door with the guide in them knowing what they were doing at that time and that's a key we got to know I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now how be it when he the spirit of Truth is come right right now what's President been talking about not a future event is come right he will guide you into some truth a quarter of Truth 99 truth all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come amen you may be seated in the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word he'll show you things to come and I was talking to the brother uh just a few minutes ago from from Boston and he's got some of the sermons and he's going to send them to us in a couple of weeks so if you uh would care to see some of them that we'll have them there for you too to look online and uh you'll probably see a different me but you know if y'all would act like they did I might preach like I did then so but anyway we got a little bit excited but that's all right you get what you come for you're the one that works the gift I don't you work it you trigger every bit of it if you're going to sit there and sleep you can sit there and sleep and I may be a little sleepy myself but we weren't sleepy then that's for sure but they were enjoying the truth now we're talking about my guide and for those of you that hasn't went and looked online about what brother Jeff Jenkins has done but he has denounced the cloud he's he's just really a man confused and the reason I'm bringing this out is I'm bringing I'm making a point because if you watch the videos he keys on one thing message preachers Perugia he names them seven Thunders all those different doctrines he's a confused man but he's not wrong in some of the things he's saying because when he the spirit of Truth has come he will lead and guide you into all Truth All right so now we know that that the new birth is the birth of the word we know that but it doesn't necessarily have to be a birth of the message there's going to be let me say billions there's going to be billions of people that's born again over on the other side that's never heard of this message but they heard the message of Jesus Christ and that was his biggest point is is that and and I want you to see how important this is because he didn't have a guide to lead him through these things therefore it confused him so bad until he's turned the message away because he listened to different preachers because that's what he said he said do I want to see Perugia do I want to see seven Thunders do I want to believe Two Souls Amy he names them all uh which one but his main point was that we have put so much emphasis as a message Church preachers and listen to this in lieu of what happened you know several months ago or six or eight months ago where now that the that the message preachers are just saying well it's just believe in the message you get the new birth just Bible you always was eternal you was it see he brings that out and he said the message preachers have done that they have put a period where brother Brandon said put a comma right right they put a period and said if you don't believe the message you don't have the new birth okay now we know that the new birth is the birth of the word but a lot of people were born again without hearing the word we hear what we call the message but he is they have so confused this poor man until he's left the church his you know his just doing things that they shouldn't be doing his wife cutting her hair and wearing pants already right off the bat but see that spirit will take a hold and I was telling them in the back there's two things going to happen to that man and I'm telling you the same thing he's either got the Holy Ghost and got a devil on him and he won't live very long you remember brother Ramsey right brother Branham with brother Ramsey brother Ramsey was a born-again Believer preacher he said I ain't preaching no more get me some beer God took him off the scene either that or the brothers not born again one of the two you can't stay that's why I want to speak tonight oh my God because you can't stay in one place right you got to move somewhere somewhere one way or the other you if you stand still your back slid right amen if you stand still your back sled right so we look and we see that's what kind of brought me to this because remember Paul and Peter here's the confusion in the message you got people believing return Ministry tint this tent that this and that you got everything in the book there's only one truth people amen amen one Paul brother Brown said in a guy I didn't put it on here he said Paul went three years into the desert came out of the desert was in a church for 14 years met Peter and he said they were eye to eye the same Doctrine amen that's right now show that to me in the message it's like brother now said what's your input what's your angle there ain't no angle right right it's either truth or lie one of the two but we haven't been left alone defend for ourself we haven't been left in a Wilderness you just wonder what we're doing right right there's a Holy Ghost then I believe that me and the pastor down in Miami he was asking me some questions and I shocked him a little bit because you know how I am I'll shock you a little bit if you'll listen he said why well praise the Lord anyhow but he said why do these brothers come to my church and pull the people away and why do they listen and why do they do that seven churches have split from that one brother's Church now I was thinking in my mind somebody don't have the Holy Ghost but I said I said well brother I just don't believe they're born again if they do you that way and if they do that with the intent of stealing your people or preaching another Doctrine then they're just not born again because remember if Peter and Paul saw eye to eye and Doctrine what's our problem right right what's our problem in the message today same Holy Ghost gets the same results if not Peter would have had one idea Peter would have had he's coming on you know this day and Paul's got this but remember when Paul was preaching Paul was preaching the resurrection so clear that it was a resurrection here first that Phillips and hymenius took it that they were the resurrection had already passed and they got it from Paul's quote book right they got it from Paul's sermons but you can't have that when the when when that which is in part is in view yeah you can have that Martin Luther could preach a father-son holy ghost baptism he could he could preach these so he could say the Jews should be took out and killed that was his idea right all right wasn't the Holy Ghost idea it was his idea but God winked at that but when that which is perfect has come that's our hour the perfect interpretation of the word with Divine Vindication is now here I don't care what the preacher says I don't care what the world says right we had a Minister's meeting not too long ago about you know should we put our messages online should we password code them I said password codem password code them they were talking about what happened with brother Donnie I said it came from inside his church right how you gonna password because you know a lot of people just have give the password out to the congregation in case they miss a service they can watch it online and it doesn't go to anybody else they said well that would protect it that ain't unprotected it didn't protect him it came from a woman inside his church so how you gonna password protect no put the message out if Obama's listening maybe he'll get converted I don't want to bring light to this thing but I'm telling you when I came back from Miami I said this is it come on I'm done with this pitter-pattering around with well it's okay to believe the way you believe no it's not okay if you're not right and how can the Holy Ghost be wrong how look at the confusion I want you to watch those videos and if you get confused you need a new birth thank you Josh be what ill he watched this one he watched that one he wanted to do this he wanted to get this one he wanted to get that one and he had no established God he had no person he had no person no pastor his dad was a pastor for a long time and he passed away a couple years ago and I feel for the brother I really do I I can see the pain in it in his eyes I mean it's like you said he's give up everything he had a big church two or three hundred people now he's out of a job so he's give up a lot but I tell you he talks about the spirit of Truth when he's looking right at the Spirit of Truth now tell me one thing where did that come from yeah Jesus was standing there in front of the Pharisees and they said the same thing right right you're illegitimate you're a wine bibber you hang around with prostitutes and thieves same thing if you want to pick on the humanity of the man you gonna find wrong in all of us but if you can't if you don't have the spirit of Truth you've got to have an anchor that's right I sang all day today The Anchor Holds though the ship be battered beat up the anchor hole it's going to hold somebody dumb enough to believe it's me they like that in Miami that's dumb enough to believe it's me and they started saying it dumb enough to believe it's me but let's look at the first quote because we must have a standard now remember brother Branham as a person is not our absolute listen he was the first prophet that had children that lived a semi-normal father Grandpa he was the first prophet all the other prophets were either not married or or married one or you understand what I'm saying he was the first prophet that really was even even the Lord Jesus didn't have a wife but brother Brown had all that yet he kept it together and it was an example for me and you but our absolute is the Bible our absolute is Jesus Christ there's no way you can understand it though without being born again I don't care listen there is no message seniority there is no message seniority I don't care if you've been in the message 30 minutes if you got the Holy Ghost and somebody been in the message 30 years and ain't got the Holy Ghost you're way ahead of him or her don't let me get excited here we go a guide oh that's what people say today oh now wait you don't believe now if I go to church and pay my tithes and I do this the other God is going to cast me down there they're asking that question brother Brian was very specific unless a man is born again he'll not even understand the kingdom of God see no excuses now see that's what brother Brandon was come to do he came to bring Clarity he didn't come to change the Bible we didn't understand it it's been clear from eternity I believe the thing was written before the foundation of the world so who are we to change it right and of course the brother I mean he takes you think one word off see he takes what I just said and he said well who is Brother Branham to insert himself in first Thessalonians or there where it says the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout who is he to insert himself well brother Brown didn't insert himself it's the message it's a message that was the shout not William Branham I thought we were the shout right I thought we were the boys let me tell you some people this thing it's like brother Brown said he said so many people are so narrow-minded you can't even put a pencil between their eyes that's a quote he said you can't put a lead pencil between their eyes without touching both eyeballs they said narrow-minded unless a man's born again now remember brother Branham did not come to change how we get the new birth like I said there's going to be billions of people in The Bride of Jesus Christ that don't know one thing about seals vials plagues Two Souls seventh on diversary whatever you want to call it amen amen never heard of William Branham never heard of him now don't get me wrong this is the spirit of Truth come on and this is the Perfection of that Spirit of Truth but you don't have to see the message to get born again but if you get born again you'll have to see the message hey man that's why I'll get them Born Again first right right there's nothing in the Bible it talks about the message before the new birth it's the new birth no excuses well the poor old man the Pearl woman that's a good old soul the only way they can ever see God is be born again that's all I don't care how little how old how young what they did how much they went to church how many denominations they knew how much Creed they could recite you've got to be born again or you're not you're not even on the foundation to begin amen now I believe he's talking about right here because he preached statue of a perfect man and he refers to the chart on the message my or a guy in my life you're not even on the foundation yet right so you got to be born again how in the world are you going to understand something Supernatural with just a natural brain right you're just going to have intellect right right I've told you many times before I wasn't born again but I can understand serpent seed when I was 10 12 years old I knew one God I knew those things were right I saw water baptism and I wasn't even born again right right I could see it in the Bible but it wasn't quickened it wasn't something that would hold me come on come on because I didn't have the one in me to hold me so you see you need the guide rolled up paragraph 98. there you go so you see you need the guide he will guide you to truth and truth is the word he will guide you and it always has been God don't never have to change nothing right right because he's infinite he knows what's best he's omnipresent he's omniscient he's everything it's right God is so he don't have to change so there we can put our confidence amen he is a confirmer of the way he's leading you the Holy Ghost of God is the confirmer of the same word that he's teaching right right now how are you going to get it you gotta hear it right exactly now Luke was led by the god to say go you into all the world preach the gospel to Every Creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be named these signs shall follow them that believe in my name they shall cast out devil speak when you tongues take up serpentry and dig with things lay hands on the sickness shall recover the Bible says that they went forth everywhere led by the God you know preach the word the signs followed what was it the guide vindicating that was the truth because you've got to have a Vindication right right we're just humans you got to have a vindication how many of you think you're born again don't think you're born again you know we go through these human emotions but there's got to be a typo somewhere because I'm telling you this not going to get easier right right it's going to get more pressure and more pressure you see people falling away go on believe the sign I wish they'd take that stupid thing off the internet they got a list of people that's defected from the message people that they have saved and the list just keeps growing because the people's not been taught right right the people have not been taught the people have been listening to ever this and ever that is the preacher's fault it's not you the laity it's what you're hearing because you take on the spirit of who you're listening to that's kind of scary isn't it but remember when Peter and Paul now remember Paul had a problem with Peter in a normal thing that was going on everybody understand that because remember Peter is the one that give us that formula Peter is Peter gave us that formula Peter wasn't a baby in Christ when Paul took him apart but you know what Peterson Peterson say well bless God who's he think he is I've been in the message longer than he has eyes with the prophet he was with Jesus Paul wanted he had seniority Peter could have said hey I got the keys no he didn't Peter said I'm sure Peter said thank you Peter said Thank you thank you very much I was out of line I'm sorry you ever heard that word repent right right it's one we don't use anymore they're going to take it out of the dictionary because we don't use it anymore I hope everything's okay here because remember there's something we got to be fortified behind right and there's signs and there's things that we got to look at and we got to see because we're going to be pulled into every direction right right exactly and do you know what it's like I was telling brother Joe in the back we're going to talk about what a God is in a few minutes but do you know that even the Holy Ghost be in your guide you can pull him off and go in another Direction you want scripture for that grieve not right the Holy Spirit brother Brown said so you must be able to grieve it he's tempt he's timid he's a gentleman now you take a guy that goes out in Colorado with you and you say look buddy I'm going in that direction and that guy said no we're going in this direction because this is the deer and I know where everything is you say no I'm going to go in this direction he's either going to shoot you right there and get you out of his his misery or he's going to say well you go on I'm not going with you but by our free moral agency though God can be standing there saying this is where we need to go and you can say I'm going in that direction sure you can now I believe once you get closer to the Statue of a perfect man to where that Holy Ghost comes and seals you in that gets more and more where the preeminence of the Holy Ghost takes over exactly right because the headstone is I do the will of my father not my own will amen that's what we've been lacking down Through the Ages we've done our own well Martin Luther he did his own will because the will of God wasn't a father son Holy Ghost baptism amen we still believe in spirits right right you can get a spirit on you but now one thing's for sure it's like I said about about this brother either he's born again and God's going to shut him up and take him off the scene or he's not born again God's not going to let him continue on in that direction he's not same thing with me and you the little miss the full things that we do is driving us to the Grave right I said the little things we do we ought to be forgetting the big things I'll tell you one thing's for sure brother Dale says on Sunday he says those of you that's not going to come back this afternoon you backslid as a donkey if you don't come to church on that afternoon come on people good grief brother Brown said you can't wait for them doors open he didn't say just one time on Sunday oh so we don't want to quote brother Brandon when that comes up but the Bible says the more that we see the day approaching right we should come more now if you're not coming to church more than you were you're backslid or lost one of the two right I'm gonna tell you to your face you backslid or lost one of the two you can't be born again and stay home how can you do that right my God must be different from yours Pearl brother dick comes up here with limping and all kind of stuff but here and faithful you know why because I believe some of us see a goal right they see a spot that they're striving for right they see a place that and that's what this is this is placing if this brother's born again he hasn't been placed he hasn't been taught enough to be placed to know where he is or he wouldn't say the things that he said same thing with all of us right oh we let all this junk get in our way did you read what brother Brown said he said no excuses right right so that's why we don't listen to excuses right because brother Brown said no excuses there's no excuses if you have the same guide now Peter Peter didn't act one way and Paul acts another sure now Peter had a problem with one thing but I believe he corrected it you know what that didn't ever happen again because he saw he was wrong in his Humanity he wanted to bring something or something into that Temple and or a little different way that Peter wanted to do and Paul said you can't do that right and Paul said and Peter said I'm sorry I'm sure he repented said God forgive me for that and you know what they went on and you know what I don't believe that they disfellowship because of that it's like brother Joe's talking in the back talking to a preacher that that this other preacher is wanting to get his Doctrine across to him get his Doctrine across to him get his doctor across to him and the brother finally says I I just can't see it brother and was going to shake his hand said the brother smacked his hand out of the way people I told him in Miami and they had to gulp a little bit before they said amen I said either if you got two opinions either one's right and one's wrong or they're both wrong because they both can't be right when it comes to the word of God they both can't be right so there is a razor edge there is and it's like I was telling them you know Paul stands up and he says you're going to be judged by what I say now some people may say that's arrogant I say it's confident Paul knew he had a message to bring you and I brother Dale myself Aaron Brother Bob all the ones that that do anything in this church you've got to know where you're at right right and you got to know that if your purpose is for this then you need to get into this and forget all the other stuff I can't be an evangelist I just can't I ain't built for that Joel Forney is built to be an evangelist by the way he said hey Hayden talk to him today but listen when you have a guide and that guy if you want to go hunting we've been on several unguided trips and they've been a not a disaster but we really haven't got anything yeah we've been on some guided trips that we really haven't got anything but we've been on some guided trips that the guy knew where to go he knew what to do and that's this way with the Holy Ghost you've got to know number one that you got it amen when he the spirit of Truth has come right right he will lead you and guide you into all truth so we come down to where and even brother Brown said it's the most ill-taught subject is how to receive Christ because like I said before it's not how much you know about the sales hold on a minute vows plagues because I'm going to read you here that we need to go on to Perfection right right but when we get started getting started that God is going to help you in the continuance but you got to have the guide there it's kind of like Dad says about the the ticket for the airplane and the bus well I'm going to say the same thing if me and brother Donnie are going hunting in Texas and we've already called the God and he's there waiting on us and he's already got everything ready and got all the provisions ready and we take a flight to Philadelphia Pennsylvania that guy's not going to do us any good right amen but when we go there and the provisions been made Hey listen I know it's a struggle to live in life I know it's a struggle to get to church but you know what you got to overcome something you got to overcome something you got to be an overcomer come on people like I told them down there and God forgive me if this is wrong but we have wasted our time on do's and don'ts we have wasted our time there was a time for it there was a time but let me tell you something if you've got the God in your life you don't have to run around and watch a holy ghost fail sister how many of you would let me go look in your Pantry or we call them vanity some hands are up some are not do you not know yours it's got all this other stuff in it but would you would you open up well you know what he's already there right I don't have to go but you can't get a holy ghost-filled woman to put on a pair of pants you can't get a Holy Ghost Field woman to cut her hair wear makeup it's just this is just the simple part of it right you can't get a holy ghost filled person said at home when church is going on either and it ain't how much you come to church right but if you're born again you will right that ain't popular but I don't care it's the Bible we just don't believe it's nearer to the end now we think we're all so revelated and we're also way up here in the in the Capstone and we disappear on Sunday told you before I've seen people that thought they were this and thought they were that and if I got to act like that I don't want it where was I hunting now listen that guide will show you around a real true guide he's already been where you're going to hunt he's already been he's already been there he knows about every tree he knows all the Tendencies because he's been there yeah this is just a natural story he knows the country and you know what if it comes up a storm he knows what to do because he's been through one before he's not out there like you would be and I would be running around in the wild not knowing where we're at right that's why we need a guide we got to have somebody to guide us because we are sheep right and sheep have to be led now look you want an example let's turn to Acts 8. now I'm sorry for what I said about the do's and don'ts but we have we have spent our time preaching on women right yeah and I know brother Brown said you got to live white and spit or live right and spit white and all that and I believe that amen but that's in your journey of becoming a Christian right I've said many times before it I only have to speak from my journey and I know you will too we were all legalists when we first started going through justification Saints why because it was do's and don'ts because it was me doing it and not doing it not somebody telling me exactly when I got born again I didn't have to have brother Dale preach to me to quit dipping chewing tobacco right actually that should have went sanctification we got all these steps messed up and that's why that brother's messed up I don't believe he understands justification sanctification in the baptism of the Holy Ghost what about that message preacher been in the message 30 years 30 years seniority don't mean squat nothing God comes in and gets born again six months later if he's got a revelation I'd soon listen to him as Listen to Somebody That ain't got the Holy Ghost living for 30 years and things are in the message and puts their own ideas in it listen to this acts 8 29 then the spirit said unto Philip well here we got a guide the spirit said to Philip go near and join thyself to this chariot because everybody know the story this is the Ethiopian unit he's sitting on his Chariot he's reading the Old Testament and he's having a problem now see this was my question that they couldn't answer when I talked to the brothers and said well you you had eternal life when you was born and it was just quick and when you heard the message well now why didn't why didn't the Ethiopian eunuch if he was born again or had eternal life in his soul why didn't he just read the scripture and get it right exactly and Philip ran thither to him and heard him read the prophet Isaiah and said understandeth thou what thou readeth in the Ethiopian unit said how can I pretty smart fella how can I accept some man should guide me look at the humble attitude The Humble Spirit right that the Ethiopian unit in other words he didn't say hey bless God I've been in a message about as long as you have get off my chariot foreign people I'm sorry you know brother Brown said one time he said God forgive me for being critical remember he had a critical spirit brother Brown had a critical spirit and had to get God to get that thing off well if I got one God take it away from me but I've seen how this is ruining look at that church of 300 people that was following that man and now they're just scattered everywhere and a man sitting there blurting all this out over the internet and letting people hear it somebody's got to stand up and accuse it right and he said how can I accept some man should guide me and he desired Philip boy he wanted to talk to Philip more than he wanted anything else that he would come up and sit with him that's kind of like communion the place of the scripture which he read was this he was led as a sheep to the slaughter like a lambdom before his share so open not his mouth in his humiliation his judgment was taken away and who shall declare his generation now he's reading Isaiah 53 for his life is taken from the earth and the eunuch answered Philip and said I pray thee of whom speaketh the Prophet this of himself or some other man then Philip opened his mouth and said have you not read the quote you know what we do Philip right I wasn't going to say that but thanks for saying it brother dick said that God sent a prophet and he did send a prophet right but the prophets got to guide you to that prophet then Philip opened his mouth and began at the same scripture he didn't pull out his own quotes hello he didn't pull his own quote book out he began at the same scripture and preached unto him Jesus it'll always be that right it will always be that right we need to preach Jesus to these people that come into the message amen because I'll guarantee you if you see Jesus you're going to see the Amplified version amen because he's the word and the Word was brought to us by a prophet right now what we've done is we've tore it into all different pieces I say not us but them because I'm going to get to something in a minute you like me or hate me daddy said if everybody likes you you're a hypocrite so good maybe somebody hates me you know that's the truth if everybody likes you that means you cater to everybody right and you're a hypocrite right that's okay that people don't like me but if I tell you the truth you have to listen to the truth anyway right amen so we look at this God and we see that Philip preached Jesus and then as the story develops we see the Ethiopian eunuch he repents he's baptized and he goes over into Ethiopia and the prophet of God says that he preached the gospel there why because he got to guide someone with the guide brought to God and he took that guide and he didn't go over there and start preaching Ethiopian eunuch Doctrine right he preached the savior he preached Jesus Christ he preached the Redeemer and folks that's what brother Branham brought us amen amen he brought us the way now I want you to read something now we're going to read Hebrews 6 1. because and I want to read you a quote and read your several scriptures and then make a few comments and they'll be finished I've only got two quotes tonight Hebrews 6 1 therefore leaving the principles now that word principles if you look it up in the in the Greek that word principles means Beginnings right all right and leaving is not where you're going to leave it and then not believe it anymore right right it's you have that as a foundation you have that as a foundation and then you're going to grow up therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ Christ let us go on into Perfection right right not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead Works in a faith toward god of the doctrine see all his Doctrine Doctrine Doctrine doctrine of baptism we got to know these things we got to know these doctrines of baptism but listen folks if you repent and you're baptized you get the Holy Ghost you got to see something and it's not different from what I see now you may be you may be a little lacking in a revelation because we all are right I knew what happened in the garden okay but when I got born again 15 years ago all that was quickened or made alive and it put the whole Bible together not just that one section amen now that's what the God will do he'll take you and guide you right through that book and then when you read a quote they marry each other there's a union between what is in the scriptures and what the prophet of God said not at this Union that's what most people have made it to this Union it's got to be this it's got to be that yeah but there is a spirit of Truth amen of the doctrine of baptism and laying on of hands and the resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment that pretty much covers everything yeah that's Resurrection baptism healing resurrection and judgment covered it all right there and this will we do if God permits right now here was here is our problem not ours but most people in the message say well you got to believe the message and that means you're born again they've got it backwards when you get born again you will see the message because you can't be guided into a father-son holy ghost baptism because the because the spirit of Truth is here the Perfection of God not that they were in an imperfection of God they were imperfected in their thoughts right right do you ever understand that they were imperfected in their thoughts Martin Luther was imperfected and it stopped because all he could see was Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism but God said okay I'll wink at that but that just shall live by faith that's what you're going to live by right do you know what it's going to be a lot of people in heaven though that was baptized in the name of father son Holy Ghost bride hello it's not going to have Lord Jesus Christ baptism but God winked at that ignorance of the day of the preaching that's where they got it from ignorance of the preaching God's going to wink at that and he give him the Holy Ghost anyhow because they believed on the Lord Jesus Christ the problem with people is they do put a period they do cabbage down they do say this is it well this message is it but I'm not like him see that brother put a comma and said there's something past what brother Brown and brought no he brought us the truth and you can put a period behind that but in all that there's commas that God's going to lead you through from your human understanding to a supernatural Revelation because you've got to have it in your natural human ability first hallelujah amen amen that the Lord Jesus Christ died for your sins that's why an illiterate person can receive the new birth he don't have to read 14 message books to get the new birth the Bible says believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and thou shalt be saved that's our problem not too many you bursts the prophet said maybe a birth in a way he said false teachers bring false birth amen but that God one more time before we read this that guide has understanding of what the whole Hunt is going to be about now he doesn't know you so you and him are going to have to bond some way right but now that's not the way with the Holy Ghost God knows your character right and even me and my character the way I am that some of you may not like and I really don't care God's if he give me the new birth he likes some part of me right and he said I'm pleased to dwell and I'm working toward here you him how about the rest of you we forget that we should always please to dwell but what if I hear you him what about you got to listen to this dummy right come on the truth anyhow obvious to get you game or to get you from like June and I took a trip to Alaska let somebody put you out in the middle of Alaska and see how long you'll survive but I felt so confident because we paid dearly for a god to guide us on those short excursions right man we went driving back up in a Wilderness in jeeps and I am really glad that that guy out front knew where he was going because that guy that was sitting beside me and June and that girl in the back didn't have a clue but we trusted the guy that was given to us right because you know what he kept going you're going to see this you're going to see that this is going to happen that deer usually come through here and they did while we were there you're right on cue I don't know if he had them for pets or something but he said they're gonna they jumped right across the road in front of us but remember listen I'm trying to make a point here right that God knows what he's doing listen to him but in our human stupidity we go no I want to go that way what if I'd have took that jeep and went off on a road going Side Road I wouldn't be here tonight they'd be one of them crosses sticking up on the side of the road you know where he died but we do have that ability though to say I'm going to go that way long enough to where God will let you go that way and I hope and pray that this brother is born again and I hope and pray that he has just said I'm going to go this way I'm going this way until God's going to tap him on the top of the head and say look buddy you either turn around and get back on track or I'm going to take you out of here now it's the same way with each one of us why do you think we're all dying because we have our own carnal idea sure we got to the purpose if we if we got the guide but are we listening to that God are we listening to the guy that says stop right here move right here we got to turn left here same way with the preaching of the gospel and and the new birth it has to connect together you have to hear right you can't get it on your own right right you got to have five folds of it all of it or you're going to get off the track now let's go and read I want you to see something Joshua 3 . and I read this this morning and brother Joe helped me look this up now let me get you scene for you now what is Joshua a type of the Holy Ghost right right he's fixing to take them across Jordan and place them in the land very important job that was his commission the Joshua commission was to take him across and place them in the land right but he's going to take them across first he's got to get them all across before he can put them in the lands everybody with me say Amen all right that was weak and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant now what is the Ark of the Covenant that's the word of God right right that was the word of God to them which was the two tables of stone in the ark when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priests the Levites bearing it the preachers and remember there was only one Ark so there was only one Doctrine right right it wasn't four or five arcs there was one and the priest of Levites bearing it then ye shall remove from your place and go after it right yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2 000 cubics by measure you know how far that is that's a half a mile the reason for the separation is this come not near unto it that you may know the way by which you must go for ye have not passed this way heretofore right now that art was placed as a beacon it was placed as a guide and wherever they saw that thing that's the way they went but they kept in case anything went on during the journey it kept it was a half a mile distance because that Ark went first the word knows where to go first and Joshua said unto the people sanctify yourselves for tomorrow the Lord will do wonders among you right but you better stay a half a mile behind that Ark because you've never been this way before and that's the problem with people they've never been this way before they're lagging behind I'm talking to you and me the ark's the word remember watch what now will you bring Joshua now watch Isaiah pick the same Revelation up let's go to Isaiah 42. and I will bring the Blind by a way they knew not now is he not talking about the same thing I will lead them in past that they have not known right right what a God I will make Darkness light before them and crooked things straight these things will I do unto them and not forsake them now but if you want a promise of God you write that in your Bible I will bring the Blind by way if they knew not and all of us were blind if you're not born again you're still blind right I will lead them in past that they have not known that's the problem we got to get them born again then I will make Darkness light before them now watch this next quote Peter was led to say in Acts 2 38 this is from a God 1962. how to receive the Holy Ghost he said repent every one of you then be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the mission remission of your sins and then the God will take you from their own Glory there's the thing there's the going on to Perfection right the God you got to get the god in glory and then it's his job it's like I was saying about it it's mining brother Donny's job to get to Texas but once we get to Texas I hope you saw that once we get to Texas that's good the guy takes over and he'll lead you all the way through if you'll just listen to him then the God will take you from their own right yeah that's the thing to do first repent of your sins your unbelief that you've disbelieved these things repent and then be baptized then the God will take you from their own see that's your duty it's your duty to repent it's your duty to be baptized see it was my duty and Donny's duty to get in the car put gas in the car and go to Texas at least we were heading in the right direction because the God says I'm in Texas right then it's the God's Duty to take you from their own lead you from virtue to knowledge to Temperance to patience the godliness to brotherly love and the Holy Ghost seals you man let me tell you some people then you're a pure full stature of God a real man of God a real woman of God anchored away in Christ I love that that anchored away in Christ the God will take you from there on right that's the problem people wanting to go ahead they want to go their own self their own idea their own way their own knowledge I agree with the brother the Holy Ghost is being preached wrong in the message but thank God this church is not built on that right this church doesn't say brother devil doesn't say just because you come church here you've got the Holy Ghost the way some of us Act we ain't got to Texas yet it's the truth the truth the truth hurts right but it'll help you it's like I told them it it's the analogy I always use about the the pill we've got a pill the doctors give us a pill it says this is going to take care of all your needs this is going to take care of everything and they give you the pill and it's a capsule and it's got powder inside but it's got that what is it um glycerin or whatever that is around it that dissolves in your stomach and goes away but remember if you take it home and lay it on the Shelf and don't say do what the God tells you to do you can lay it on the shelf and you know what all y'all come to my house and I'll say that pill is going to make me better you'll bury me you'll bury me in the ground if I don't take that pill ow that's what we're doing with the word of God it's got everything you need but you got to take it and put it in the right environment right once you've taken put it in the right environment what's inside will help you right right but that's our problem we want to say oh it's good oh it's there it's oh it's there it's there for everybody it's this it'll do everything for me and then you put it right there yeah trust you God if you don't trust the god they somebody else going to guide you that's what's happening people I'm warning you look around people are leaving in droves brother Brown said sight and time was man's worst enemy here we are 50 years the prophet's gone and we still got people that ain't Born Again preaching the gospel right that's right or they wouldn't like the way they act right it's a wonderful time but it's a terrible time right right but it's a time for us to either lead follow or get out of the way like my old football coach used to say either lead follow or don't get in somebody's way our problem is we got too much of this and too much of that but I'm going to tell you something when I was down in Miami we had a few discussions and then when this come up with with Jeff Jenkins putting all this online pays one thing for sure I know where I'm supposed to be whether you do or not this church don't stand for a lot of things that goes on in churches out there this church is not built on things that they're being built on out there and it's sinking sand I believe we've had the truth amen the fullness of the word right I don't care what you like me or not but I'm gonna still come to church here and this is that yeah there's not this this is that right that was spoken of Man by Joel but you need to guide people you need to start listening to God right you know you I never meant that brother and I hope this sermon was not built around him but some of the things he said yeah it was it kind of but I was already going to speak on the god of my life because I spoke on it last Sunday at Sunday and Sunday school right brother Bob so it wasn't I didn't know I was going to preach tonight but if you don't have the guide I I promise you you will be led astray and even with the guide you can be led astray because there's two spirits in the framework of the church and you got to be able to discern which one's right but remember either they're both wrong or one of them's right they both can't be right so the two Spears in the framework of message churches right right not out there in here right right because this is where the division has become more than anything it's become a war in a battle I'm telling you go to no never mind let's stand make sure you have the guide make sure that that God tells you and you know what if something tells you one thing contrary to the word you know it's not that God right amen right right man it's time to forget not forget the principles of the doctrine we were built on right but go on to Perfection amen the Bible says the Deep things of God should be understood right and we should plainly be able to understand it because if a seventh grade man could bring it to us in so much Simplicity how can that be deep but it is deep to the ones that doesn't have the Holy Ghost sure I hear preachers all the time say oh you don't need to preach on deep things I said well you need to get the Holy Ghost because they didn't say I'll lead you and guide you into baby food right did it did say I'll keep you on milk all the time I like milk I like a good cold glass of milk but I like it with a steak about that thick right I like some steak I like some strong that's what Paul said wasn't he Paul wasn't listen Paul wasn't shy about what he was saying right he said strong me you need to be eating strong meat why are you sitting around here crying why cry we need to speak and go on right right I was using the same message as brother Dale was using about the masterpiece but man when when Michelangelo when he saw that what he had been working on for years but look the image was always in that stone right it just took a master builder or a master architect to get it out of that stone it was in that stone before the foundation of the world he had to come from somewhere right and that statue was in there well well you know what that's what God's doing as a father as a father he's looking at us and he's molding us and he's cutting this away and cutting that away he's shining this up and Shining that up one day he's going to step back and he's going to say speak see there's adoption speak right right that's what we need to see we need to see that it God is going to once he sees that image and he sees it completely finished and he rubs it and he says it wasn't see my Michelangelo was not making a statue of Michelangelo he was making a statue of Moses of someone else that was a human that was a human example that brother Brandon was using God is making an image of himself let us make man in our image there was that Genesis 1 26 man that God had in that stone that Revelation the whole time and the way to reveal it was it looked like just a piece of Rock people walk by Michelangelo and they just look and they go that just looks like a square Stone piece of Michelangelo said you just wait a little while I got something in my mind and I'm going to bring it out of that stone and I'm going to develop that picture that I saw right in my mind and God's the same way but God's not making an image of Moses right he's making an image of himself he's got a bride that's going to be there he's got a bride that he's holding that he's cutting away that he's guiding if we'll listen that's our problem sometimes we don't listen right but we need to put our listening ears on amen get excited about this thing get it's my brother now said be in a Revival right right y'all's problem is you must keep it inside them people in Miami they show theirs I almost ran with him almost did well they were running so they were happy I am thinking of the rapture are gathering in already his hand when he came into the building today engraved it now you believe it it's that simple just believe it y'all like this song for one reason we know who the redeemed are but there's a verse that saves the Angels they must think we're crazy well they don't have a daddy like we do they had a Creator but God's Our Father we never weren't created we always have been always pray for each one remember two that we're coming up on our Father's Day um thing next week so all the ones that are going to the to the fishing trip needs to meet tomorrow Sunday after the second service just for about 15 minutes so that we'll get everything together make sure we got this some of you that are sending your kids make sure there's somebody going to go with them ain't gonna take care of them all right and we're going to try to maybe later on in the year with some of the fish that we have left over is have a fish fry here at church so everybody can enjoy it so just pray that we catch a lot of fish because there's a lot of y'all to feed brother now said the Fourth of July weekend so the fourth July weekend we will cook some fish here at the church for everybody to enjoy so you gotta like that brother Nick I'll cook it from I will sing
