are echo and what isaiah said and in uh chapter six that we'll read here in a second that he saw the lord sitting upon throne high and lifted up and you think think that's actually what i got isaiah killed when king manasseh heard uh that isaiah saw the lord sitting on his throne he said well i remember over there in exodus chapter 33 it says that no man can see god and live and he got confused about what the scripture said so he chased isaiah down and isaiah hidden a cedar tree and he cut him down and the bible says he over in hebrews 11 that he was sown asunder many are sown asunder but think about that song when you sing it maybe next time somebody got killed for for for what this song is as uh represents so let's turn over in isaiah chapter 6 and we'll read that story tonight and talk about a heavenly influence oh god we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word once more and gather together with the saints of like precious faith lord as we brought our little looks of fire together we pray lord that you'll just be with us tonight lord god and open up these words to us lord that you'll give us strength in this hour help us lord that you'll give us some encouragement in the middle of the week lord god that you'll just lift up our hearts we pray in the name of the lord jesus christ amen now the bible says in isaiah chapter six verse one in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting up on a throne high and lifted up not working yet we'll we'll keep moving on high and lifted up and his train filled the temple above it stood the seraphims each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of his glory and the post of the door moved at the voice of him that cried and the house was filled with smoke then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts then flew one of the seraphims unto me having a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tongs from off the altar and he laid it upon my mouth and said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i sin then who will go for us then said i here am i send me you may be seated the lord is blessing to the reading of the word now so so tonight i just want to speak on a heavenly influence because you know in the earth there's a lot of influences there's a lot of things that you can look at and be influenced by but we really are interested in that heavenly influence in in christ jesus in his word now isaiah that this chapter is talking about isaiah got his eyes on this this man king king uzziah and the bible talks about how uzziah was just he was a little shepherd boy when he became king when he was 16 years old and and the lord he set his eyes on the lord and and and did everything that the the word required of him and he began to be to be to be prospered prosperous and and and uh brother branham said as long as he saw the lord god made him to prosper and he he in second chronicles it said he saw god in the days of zechariah who had understanding in the visions of god and and and he god calls him to prosper and in second chronicles chapter verse 8 it says the ammonites gave gifts to uzziah and his name spread abroad even to the entering end of egypt for he strengthened himself exceedingly and moreover use i built towers in jerusalem at the corner gate and at the valley gate and at the turning of the wall and fortified them and he built towers in the desert and digged many wells where he had much cattle both in the low country and in the plains husbandman also and vine dressers in the mountains and carmel for he loved husbandry and it says in in verse 15 and he made in jerusalem engines invented by cunning men to be on the towers and upon the bulwarks so because i use i began to prosper the lord gave him wisdom and how to build things and and he began to build defenses for jerusalem and build all these different things and maybe if you put it in uh this is this is a i guess this is a prayer request sister sharon had a hard day she's as a uti and has been very tired today please say a special prayer for her at the end of this aid to this church service we'll just leave that there to to remember that help me not forget that too sometimes i get sidetracked but help me not not to um so the uh uzziah began to uh he began to the lord caused him to prosper and and uh you know you you think about that if you if you bring that over in today's in in in in today's day uh you know sometimes you can begin to get so you begin to prosper within yourself and you might have a nice car and might have a nice home and and and all those things but yet you you've got to you got to continue on uzi began to prosper and he got he got in a place where he began to look at himself and all of his own accomplishments and began to get away from god and began to get built up within himself to think that he was he was somebody he began to his name was all spread abroad and he had built all these towers and everything and and he began to forget what it really means to serve god and you know brother ram said if we take the testimony not let's meditate on this just for a little bit if we take the testimony of being christians i think that is one of the most solemn things that a man or a woman boy or girl could do would now why why is that a solemn thing to say i'm a christian to get to come to church and be associated with people that believe in in jesus christ to to take the name of jesus christ why is the solemn thing because people people are looking at you when you say that you're a christian now now that goes for for anybody now it goes for a little child that's going to school that that people are looking at you to see how you act because you know the devil wants to give people excuses he wants to give you know the devil gives one of your schoolmates or one of your friends an excuse to say well they acted that way and so now now now that you've gotten a good excuse if if you can find somebody that's living in sin or doing wrong now now you see what brother i'm saying if we take the testimony of being christians that's one of the most solemn things that a man or a woman boy or girl could do when he takes on the name of christ that he is going to be a representative of christ so when you're a christian you you are a represent you represent you you're a representative of the kingdom of god so whenever you go to church or go to work people are looking at you as as well that's that person represents everything that a christian stands for everything that jesus christ stood for and so brother brown said you should watch every move you make because somebody is watching you now now we're not talking about some kind of santa claus thing where santa claus is always watching you but we're tonight we're talking about every people are watching you your friends are watching you and what a great privilege it would be now think about this that what a great blessing it would be to know that somebody's watching you that to know that that you can be an influence to other people when somebody's down you can be an influence to them you can give them words of encouragement and say and lift them up lift up their heart if somebody's living and sin that you've got a way out and you can be an influence to them when you're when you're when you're when your kids are down you can be an influence to them when your kids are living and sin or doing something wrong then you can be an influence to them and give them words of encouragement and help them help along the road what what a great blessing that is and brother brown said and in this it reflects what god has done for you inside of you so he's done something for you on the inside and now you can reflect that on the outside i'm just talking tonight i'm just talking a little bit now now brother ram said so so we're so what we're talking about tonight is somebody somebody you have the privilege to be an influence just people that are watching you so what what does that mean now that means now when we come to church do we take do we take god seriously are we coming to church just to just uh you know come to uh kind of sit on the pew and keep it warm and everything or or are we coming really really to get serious with god you know when isaiah got in that in that when he when his eyes were opened up to the vision of what god really was and he saw that saw him lifted up on his throne and with all the seraphims all around him and he he began to get real serious about god he began to realize that his eyes hadn't been on the right thing because when you get in the presence of god when you get let's say when you get in the influence of somebody that believes god and knows what they're talking about it it changes your perspective so when we come to church do you do you want do you do you live a holy life are you are you reverent with god do you do you do you take it seriously enough that you're concerned when when you slip and fall a little bit do you do you do you uh do you listen to worldly music or does that bother you do you dress like the world do you or do you do you love the world do you love those things of the world have have you become so cold to christianity and to the things of god that where you you'd really rather rather be out there in the world maybe maybe tonight maybe we can examine ourselves and see see see what's down on the inside because you know a lot of the problems that manifest on the outside what they really are is a heart problem and if we can get our heart straightened up and our heart going in the right direction then it'll fix everything on the outside so many times we beat on the outside but it's the heart that's got to be changed maybe maybe tonight you know what brother brown was really getting at when he preached this sermon influenced that he preached so many times as can somebody tell you're a christian because somebody when they get in the car with you and and listen to the music that you're listening to and listening to your conversation can they can they tell you're a christian or do they do they kind of wonder and stumble and well they go to a church they go to a methodist church but yet something don't look quite right now now so so we we we gotta don't be influenced by the earthy now now the bible says in first john chapter two verse 15 to 17 it says love not the world neither the things that are in the world if any man love the world the love of the father is not in it now you think about that now if you love the world if you love all the things that all if you love all the movies and stuff a whole lot more than you love reading your bible that that's something something's a little bit skewed if you love if you'd really rather be out there partying with your friends and and drinking alcohol and doing things that you shouldn't be doing then something something is not right for all that is in the world the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the pride of life is not of the father but is of the world and the world passeth away and the lust thereof but he that doeth the will of god abideth forever now that gets real serious because that means that the world and everything in is eventually going to peter out until it's no more it gets burnt up in the lake of fire the the world system all that the devil stands for is going to come to an end but there's only one thing that's eternal and that's jesus christ and so we can have no confidence in anything of this of this world system we can have no confidence even in ourselves we can have no confidence in our flesh which is what the bible says in philippians 3 3 for we are the circumcisions which worship the god in the spirit and rejoice in christ jesus and have no confidence in the flesh we have no confidence in the flesh now that's why that's why mothers and fathers when your kids are dating and things you watch out for i'm real careful because we don't have any confidence in the flesh sometimes sometimes our children will say well why why do you want to keep such a close eye on me why do you want to you don't you trust me no cause the bible says we have no confidence in the flesh we don't have con i barely have confidence in myself i don't have confidence in myself not to procrastinate sometimes at work i don't have confidence not to put things off when i when i know it's tax season i put it off i i put off doing my i put off thing and so i have no confidence in things the things that i should should do i don't do there's many things that i don't do so i don't have confidence but there's one that you can have confidence in you can have confidence in his word you can have confidence in jesus christ [Applause] now see see you we'll be you you can't have confidence in one another so what we'll do what we'll do sometimes is we we look we look to one another to try to find an excuse for the way that we act we we looked at what a strange thing that is how we'll look to one another when we can't have confidence in one another but we'll look to one another to try to find fault well you did it so i can do it too you did it and we'll use others as an excuse for sin but they you did it now now now see now this is where this is where a lot of kids kind of the kids the kids will do this a lot they'll look to their parents now think about this now let's meditate on this the kids will look to their parents their past their parents past sins i i want all of y'all children to realize that one day your parents were sinners if you go back far enough your parents were sinners and because listen you can't have confidence you can't have confidence in nothing but jesus christ so now if you go back far enough you're going to find something terrible that your mama and daddy did and it's going to be a lot worse than just stealing the cookie now a lot of times a lot of times we'll go back and the kids will go back and they'll say well now let's get let's get it right down to the nitty-gritty we'll go back and you'll say well well i my parents uh did something out of wedlock or something and so you'll try to use that as an excuse for yourself to go do that or you well well i my parents drank alcohol so now i'm gonna go drink alcohol too i've got an excuse to do that and you realize you realize what you're doing you realize what the devil is doing i i've told my children before i i want i want y'all to be better than i was and what the devil does the devil does is he puts a trapping in the way so that you are worse than your parents that's why the bible says that every generation gets worse and worse first there was flappers and they had their their kind of short dress and they did their weird little dance but then they got worse and worse and every generation gets worse and worse why do they get worse and worse because of that trap that the devil puts you in the devil will make you look at the sins of your mother and father and say well if they did it i can do i can do one better but you're not doing better you're doing worse now think of that why think of the trap that the devil will put you in to think that to make you think that you're doing good by doing worse listen if it you can it almost becomes like a cycle where every generation the grandfather has a problem with alcohol so the son has a problem with alcohol and then and then the grandson has a problem with alcohol and they see that their generation before them has a problem with alcohol so it just keeps moving on moving on and they think you think looking back at your family that you have a right to have to to vape or drink alcohol or be be promiscuous or whatever it is make your list that you have a right to do that but i i want tonight maybe to challenge you that it's time to step out from the cycle and break the cycle because god has given you a word he's given you the power he's given you power to become sons of god and what is that power he's given you his word and if you'll get in that word and realize what god has given to you can step out from that cycle and you don't have to be an alcoholic anymore you don't have to smoke cigarettes anymore you don't have to smoke marijuana to be happy and you sure don't have to be promiscuous to be happy god wants virtuous young men and women he wants somebody to be holy i i i want to come back the idea tonight that that you you know growing up you used to you used to think i know the devil will tell kids lies this lie that you got to have a horrible life to have a real good testimony well listen you don't have to you don't have to have some kind of testimony tonight where you don't woke up in some bar with your arms around the toilet soaked in vomit you don't have to not you don't have to have that kind of a testimony to share now that's great if you got that kind of testimony to say that the lord delivered me from alcohol or from drugs or whatever and that's wonderful but tonight you can have you you think about what a wonderful testimony that would be to say that i never i never kissed another girl until i was married to say that i never drank alcohol or smoked cigarettes now i'm not preaching tonight that we need to be goody two-shoes or something i'm not preaching that do you be a good person like the rich young ruler and then come up and he couldn't give his heart to the lord that's not what i'm talking about we're not talking about goody two-shoes but i'm talking about that there is god has given us the ability and he wants he wants you to be better than the previous generation he wants you to live a virtuous life he don't want you to get tossed out in the gutter so it's time to break cycles now now you look back in the bible and you remember all these examples you remember you remember in first kings where it was prophesied that there was going to be a little boy come on the scene josiah and the bible prophesied that josiah was going what was he going to do he was going to break the cycle of his father ammon and ammon came on ammon had he was an idol worshiper and and i done all those things but one of the when josiah was just a little boy he he came on the scene and first kings had prophesied about him and and 300 years later here comes josiah on the scene and he could look back in the bible and read about himself and you know i i wonder if maybe he realized i ain't going to be like my daddy i am not going to be an idol worshiper i'm going to be a i'm going to be a god-fearing man and he tore down all those idols and he he stepped out in faith believing what what he was supposed to do he he could read in the bible where he was supposed to tear down idols and you know tonight you can read in the bible or you're supposed to tear down idols you can read in the bible where you're supposed to break cycles and you can do just like josiah did and not do not do the sins of your mother and father and not do like they did now now tonight i want to challenge you tonight that you don't have to tonight you don't have to listen to the lie of the devil that tells you to go look back at the sins of your ancestors and that you got to do like they did you don't have to do those things you think about two if you're looking at your parents one day your kids will be looking at you so if you're looking at your parents now to see a justification for what you should do think about what your kids are going to be looking at you do you want one day one day your kids will be doing the exact same thing that you're doing one day your kids will be asking the same kind of questions mama and daddy did you ever have your kids ever asked you that they start going down that list did you ever and your eyes get wide did you ever do this did you ever do that now think about that young people one day your kids are going to be asking those questions how how do you think you're going to feel when those questions come up did you do this did you do that oh the second corinthians i said says such trust have we through christ to god's word not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything is of ourselves we're not sufficient in ourselves at all but our sufficiency is of god you see my confidence tonight my confidence might not be it's not in being a good person like the rich young ruler not just being good but my confidence sitting in being a minister my confidence sitting and having a bible in my home or or the role that i have in church and being a deacon or sunday school teacher and all those things those those are good things and everything but my confidence is in jesus christ you can take away all those things but see you can't put you can't put confidence in anything outside of jesus christ so don't look at other people don't look at other circumstances don't look at you where you're at don't even look at what role you have in the church there's been plenty of people that have had high roles and pastures and all kinds of things around the message around christian life and and it didn't amount to nothing in the end but so you can't have confidence in nothing but jesus christ won't you once you give your life to him once you give your life if if not tonight maybe beside your bed at night when you go home and you begin to cry and call out to god and realize that god loves you that he gave you these promises because he wants to save you and he wants you to pull out pull you out of the pit so that your life does not become ruined if you look the crowd what does that mean look to christ what does that mean look to the word we say that a lot but what does that really mean that means that means if you want to find out what success really is then go look in the bible go look in the bible and find out what success was success might look like it might look like maybe maybe lazarus that the the story that brother that jesus told about lazarus dying and and he went to heaven and the and the rich man went to hell but yet that was a man that was that was that was begging for bread that was poor but that was success so if you want to find out success go look in the bible success is a man at the end of the road after his life has been wound out then he's he's he's resting in the bosom of abraham resting in the bosom of christ success success the word will tell you how to live it'll tell you how to live in a way where you're not you're not when bad times come yet you still got joy in your heart because you know that you you can have confidence in christ he's going to see you through he's going to he's still jehovah gyra he's still out i when i need something i can turn to the breasted one he's still he's still the one from where i get all my strength the look to the word because the word will tell you how to work it'll tell you how to work like solomon said like an ant go look at the ant and and you'll find out how to how to work and how to do how to live how to treat your wife how to not not to beat her over the head with a shovel or something or grab her by the hair and holler off to your cave or something but how to how to treat her in love and and and you young men and young women tonight you know that when you get married you you want somebody that's not just in it so that they can check off that list that now i'm married but somebody that'll really love you and that's what the bible that's what the word will tell you how to do how to love somebody what to look for how to treat others it'll tell you how to treat others do unto others as you would have them do unto you that's how a christian lives a christian is not selfish but a christian a christian looks and sees somebody with a flat tire on the side of the road and they know that if they were in that predicament they need some help so they pull over and help them out a christian sees somebody that's poor and destitute in the church and they need some money for food and so they give them food because they know that if they were in that predicament they'd need some help a christian will give uplifting words to somebody because they know that if they were in that predicament they'd want somebody to come along and give them a little encouragement and stuff do under others that you would have them do unto you and that's how you be an influence that's what what's brother i'm talking about he's talking about that you can be it isn't it strange in this sermon if you go back and listen to it what a strange thing that he says to not be influenced by others by the failings of other people to in other words don't get so caught up in looking at other people but you want people to look at you in that strange that almost seems like a paradox that you can have people look at you and be influenced to the kingdom of heaven but yet don't get all caught up in the failings of other people because there's going to be a lot of failings there's going to be a lot of things to look at don't get all hung up on it but yet let people get hung up on you let people let people look at you and say i i won't i want to love god i want i want to be like that if you're really an influence to others then when somebody looks at your life they want to be more of a christian that's what i want to be i know many times i fail i fail my family i fail my i feel my wife in many many ways but yet when i look in the word i i know that this is the pattern that we've got to pattern our lives out of that we've got we've got to be an influence to others this is what the world needs the world needs somebody that they look at and say and they're drawn to christ because the world is hungry and thirsty everywhere you go you see thirsty people that they need something and what they need is christ and where else are they going to find it but you now brother brown said in the message life he said a brother was testifying to me this morning he was called to the ministry when a little boy and then he fell he said and he said but then he came back with more of a call to preach than ever before and brother around you said you see what it was when he became a christian he got in the wrong environment and that environment influenced him see and you just keep holding around with that kind of environment it influences you i hope you're reading between the lines what i'm saying see it influences you in that environment what's he saying what you your friends that you hang around with they're going to influence you the people that you hate the the place that you hang around with influences that that's why we come to church because so that we can get under the influence of the gospel now he said in the first thing you know you become a part of that environment that's what we do when we come to church we're trying to become a part of the word now whatever environment you're hanging around with that's what you're going to become a part of he said you go into it and just like a good clean man that's clean and moral and he begins to associate with a bunch of people who's not see you take up the spirit of that now now you think about that that that should really influence who we hang around with and what we you when you go when you look at your friends and look at people in the church and you think well that's the kind of person that i want to be like then you go hang around them more and you look at people and they're they're really um the young people call it toxic you know they're always pulling you down and everything you you think you you you'll think well i don't want to be like that and so you maybe you'll distance yourself a little bit from it what what are you doing you're you're you want to get around people that believe you want to i was listening to a sermon where brother i was he was he he told this little girl that she was healed and and uh if you go follow it through this the story is she she went home and she got around the people in her home and they began to tell her things about doubt i don't believe that you're healed i don't believe that there's anything wrong with you and i don't believe that that was a real call man of god and she got in that influence that negative influence as she began to lose her healing and she went back to the prayer line and brother brown explained to her what happened you see how important it is to get in the right environment because your environment is what influences you so what you want to get around people people that tell you the truth people that tell you and that what the gospel is is telling you the truth the word is a discerner of the thoughts and the intents of the heart and because it's the truth and sometimes it's scalding a little bit but listen even when you're you know you want to you want to listen you many times your parents will tell you the truth and you get upset with it but that's what you want because you want the truth is what will open up what the truth is what will help you the truth so you get in that environment now brother roman said in the message influence he said now you know there is somebody that you're influencing your life is a written epistle read of all men therefore if your life isn't according to your testimony or your testimony according to your life you are putting a stumbling block in somebody's way for somebody is watching you some little child is watching his mother watching his dad i think there's something real deep in here because if you if you realize that your kids are watching you if you realize then you can begin to change the atmosphere in your home because whatever you do whatever the way that you act that's the way they're going to want to act whatever things that however you act now brother brown began to go on and explain he said now you go out in this in this in the yard and you look up at the stars and the sun is sitting up there in this position it's got an influence it's got an influence over the whole solar system now what does the sun have to do it doesn't have to do nothing but just sit there it's just sit there in this place isn't that what god's trying to bring us to up to a place where he can position a place us where we know what we're supposed to do what we know like brother wade was preaching on sunday whether we're a preacher or or a a bus driver or whatever or or just a a homemaker or somebody in our a a a godly husband that's running his house that's driving his home bus at what whatever your position is you look at all these all the things that in the sky that the moon that could actually pull and push the tide and move it and it doesn't have to do nothing but just set in its place the sun is it it's got all these all these types it's a yellow light it to bring photosynthesis this is steady it's not pulsating that god put it in his place so that he could give light and warmth and bring life to the earth and all it has to do is set in its place now when you find your place you don't have to work something up you don't have to run you don't you don't even have to lecture your kids if you find your place what does that mean now find your place you remember that story brother i'm told about the the little the little sister that had the drunk husband and he came home with all his friends and they were laughing but but she was now she was in her place and she didn't have to go lecture him and beat him about the head with a broomstick to try to get him to understand what she was about all she did was mop that floor and sing must jesus bear the cross alone and because she was in her place she was just in her place she was doing what a christian does a christian does what a christian does a sinner does what a sinner does but when the life of christ is in you you're going to do what a christian does and you don't have to do nothing but just be a christian and that that little that little man was converted there because he was looking at his wife in her place now you think about the atmosphere that you can create in your home just by being in your place maybe your kids will come home at night and from from from working late at whatever they're doing and doing things that they shouldn't be doing but when they step into your home they hear that tape playing they hear gospel music playing maybe they maybe they walk down the hall and they hear mama praying in the back bedroom you see you see you don't have to do nothing but be a christian i've i've heard somebody i know was given a testimony about how they were growing up and and the dad would would maybe he'd be over there watching tv but they look over in the corner and mama was sitting there with a with a message book in her lap and she had it open she wasn't doing nothing but being a christian but the kids remember that because they look back years later and they remember they remember when the door was closed and they could hear mama in the next room praying and and maybe they didn't go up to mama right then and say mama mama it's you're being a real big influence to me but years later they look back and they remember mama being an influence why because she was in her place and she didn't have to do nothing just like the sun and the moon and the stars and and the earth and everything that you can look up into the sky and see is a testimony of if you'll get in your place if you'll just be a christian then you'll be an influence now you think about that the influence that you can have in your home if you can if you just if you just if you'll just do these things this just think about how simple this is sometimes we won't we want something complex we want somebody to give us give us something that some something something magic or something to change things but listen think about the simplicity of of a home where where you're they're not playing uh sports all the time and playing all kinds of stuff on the tv when you walk in but the simplicity of a gospel home that's an influence to the children the simplicity that that is what will change lives when that when the children late at night i i remember growing up in my home i'll bring it personal growing up in my home and i'd be laying asleep in bed before a big test or something i could hear my dad down the hall praying at night because and that was an influence to me how was it an influence because i began to recognize as his the way that he prayed through the night would change that there was a real god that this wasn't just some kind of made up thing that like brother branham would say we're not talking about scholastics you ever you ever get to the place maybe where you think that the message is just scholastics and learning there's just a lot of education but there is a real spirit of a living god that can move into your home and and if you'll if you'll just approach it in faith god will come in your home and he'll bring peace and he'll bring joy and he'll change the atmosphere then it becomes not just a letter on the page but it becomes a living reality that's the kind of gospel that i'm preaching tonight i believe i believe that this is more than just learning that there's a real god that can come you know you can take advantage of that when you begin to pray for your kids and and you see them going off and doing stuff that they shouldn't a lot of times there's nothing that you can really say to them with your mouth but you get down on your knees and you say god i know that that spirit that you that you're real and you go after them and you watch you watch they'll get to a place maybe where they're sitting on the side of the road somewhere or sitting in a parking lot and they begin to think that this is why it's the spirit of god dealing with them and he'll come down and begin to move on the scene and begin to kind of crush at their heart and twist at it and pull at their heartstrings and begin to do something that you can't do with your own words sometimes sometimes our words are the things that gets us all all messed up your words set in anger will make them make them run away from you but but the spirit of god woo and over their heart will do what he did to the earth seven thousand years ago when the seas began to come up let the spirit of god begin to woo over your children and watch something begin to change amen and what makes it happen your faith your faith when you pray in faith praying faith believing believing that what he did for you he's able to do for your family and brotherhood said now here we find where that a christian testimony no matter how great it's been in the past it must always continue that way now uzziah got to a place where he thought he was a big shot he thought that because put it today he thought because of the he had that that hair style or whatever he thought he had a nice suit he thought he could he could roll up in the church parking lot in a corvette or a big old nice truck or a big something that he was somebody and he didn't have to listen to the ministers anymore that he could just do his own thing because he had been blessed maybe he had a lot of money in the bank account maybe he got to a place where he he was like i don't need nothing from nobody i'm i'm a big shot i'm going to tell y'all how to do it and brother brown said he'd try to take somebody else's place what what did he do he he he got to a place where he just ignored what the ministers are saying all those priests out there telling them you can't go into that golden altar and alter incense it's not lawful for you to do now you can apply that to any scenario in your life you apply that to telling your kids you're not supposed to do this or that or whatever you're supposed to telling your kids you're supposed to dress in a way that sinful men won't look at you oh you could go down the line all kinds of things but you see the the the the end result of uzziah turning refusing to be corrected was a leprosy appeared on his face he reaped what he sowed you know what any any decision you make there's consequences i was talking to a minister friend of mine that he he likens it to there's a shark after you all through your life if you if you don't pay your taxes the shark is going to get you if you don't if you don't uh you know there's so many different things that the sharks will get you if you don't do it because there's the shark has consequences if if you don't if you don't pray before you get married before you find somebody to get married there's there might be consequences you might reap what you sow there's gonna be consequences a lot of times consequences are really bad if you go out there and be promiscuous then the consequences are going to be a little baby in your arms there's consequences to your decisions and you see uzi he got to a place where he didn't have humility when he was strong when he was strong in himself he did not have humility when his kingdom was all built up he didn't have reverence he didn't put his faith into action and brother i'm saying now we find out that it is trying to take the minister's place and someone telling him he is out of place telling him he shouldn't do that he's out of place he became angered angered he was so angered till his face turned red hank why would you be angry if somebody tells you the truth why why would he be angered if somebody tell him you don't have to do go through all the effort and everything of of it's like he's like you know sisters i think should be real appreciative that they don't have to preach but yet so many want to get on facebook and be a preacher on facebook and things there's so many things you know you shouldn't rile up about when when somebody tells you that's not your place what what is the gospel trying to do it's trying to get put us in our place put it if you're a song leader be a song leader if you're a preacher be a preacher if you're a deacon be a deacon if you're whatever you are if you're a homemaker be a homemaker and if you're in your place then you get you get to a place where you just don't have to do nothing it just automatically works and because he didn't want to get in his place god smote him with leprosy he said that brother said the man died in his leprosy which is a type of sin and the influence in the message influence he said now you say well what do you mean leprosy represents sin and when a man won't stand correction by the word of god he's full of leprosy blows up and carries on what does you what do you do you ruin what are you ruining you ruin your influence what do you ruin you because when somebody sees that you won't stand correction it just ruins everything he said people knows and can tell the word that you're corrected by that you're not going to do it therefore you ruin your influence well don't we want influence you want to you want to be able to influence the people that you associate with and i think i think that's going to be maybe just really nail this down to the young people you want to be a leader when others look at you you want to be the one that they that they want to be like that you don't don't want to be like the sinner don't want to be like the world but let them want to be like you let them want to be like you uzziah when he got to the spot where he thought he was secure then he got lifted up in his heart he got to a place that no one could tell him anything my that's a horrible place when you get to a place where lord don't let any of us ever get to that place no matter how much revelation we've got no matter how much word we've got don't ever get to a place where nobody can tell you nothing because when you get to a place where you're above the dust and you are above god is what brother amber said when you were when you get to a place where look at me now look at me now nobody can tell me nothing then you're then you're in a spot set for destruction brother ram said how many great men great servants of who god has used finally come to a place till they feel that they know so much about the word of god till they don't even have time that time off to pray no more it's always social visits visit somebody go out to dinner and they get so high up until they all they want to do is socialize they you see we've got to spend time with god god is where we get our our influence from he's where we get our strengths from and if all we want is just to be around uh to look at one another and things like that he said the time that they should be spending with god alone and preparing to come out and the sweetness of the spirit before the congregation they're out somewhere with some entertainments you can't serve god and man at the same time god's servant should be an isolated person to him only my you think think about that for us ministers that that really you know brother talked about in the stature of a perfect man that he said they were men a few words they just got behind the pulpit and then they spoke and and how they they weren't spending all their time going around uh you know maybe like kissing babies and making every making everybody happy what they were trying to do was make god happy you think about isaiah that he because of the stand he took he got killed he got they healed him down in that tree and and sliced him up because of the stand he took not because he was trying to make people happy because he was he wanted to be an influence of the right thing make sure that you're influenced by the right thing the king got lifted up in pride and he thought he was so secure until god would let him get by with anything until he thought he had a right we don't have any right a christian a christian don't have any rights you don't have a you don't have a right to live loose you don't have a right to smoke you don't have a right to drink you don't have a right to look like the world you don't have a right to live like the world you don't have a right your christian absolves all our rights and the law brother said the law don't say i can't do it he said i know that it don't people will say that the law don't say i can't do it he said i don't hardly say anything you can do anything you want to that's right just about anything but brother it's not in a christian's heart to do that if you'll purpose in your heart that you'll live clean and pure before god nature itself will teach you that those things are wrong you realize that's what the new birth does the new birth will change your heart not not beating one another not hammering on your kids a lot of times we want to change our kids make our kids think right by telling them telling them stories and things but we got to have the new birth the young people need the new birth that's what it you'll be you'll be in a load of grief until you get your kids born again it's it's it's a hard road i'll be honest it's hard road until you get your kids born i remember riding in the car with my kids and it'd be an argument you why don't you do this why don't you i i don't understand why we have to do this i don't understand why we have to do that but but when they got born again it changed everything and it'll be like that until they get born again so so don't worry about telling them all kinds of philosophies and psychologies and going to the bookstore and trying to find a good self-help book that you can share with them what they need to do is like nicodemus jesus told nicodemus you must be born again that's that's your number one mandate for your kids is getting born again and and you know as christian parents you've got you've got you're set up to be an influence to them because your kids can't leave your kids are stuck in your house they can't leave and so you you can be an influence every morning when they're waking up that you can they can look over and see you reading your bible or hear you at night praying and and listen to the tape playing constantly because they're in your house and you can be an influence to the day that they got enough money to leave or whatever they're going to do but take advantage of it that you you can be an influence to your children to change their heart it's heart a heart that's that's the reason why a lot of times kids they want to marry somebody that you're like what why would you why would you do that because their heart ain't right it's not that they need a long lecture it's not that they need a lot of information they need their heart to be changed if we can get that fixated in our mind it might change our approach their heart needs to be changed you can you can parade all the youtube videos and all the lectures and all the different things in front of them make them sit there for four or five hours and listen to all your so-called words of wisdom but they need to be born again they need to be born again all the psychology in the world all the dr dobson in the world ain't gonna change them if they ain't born again they need to be born again it's not gonna help if they're not born again and brother ram said we need influential christians influenced by the word of god call men or women for an influence to the elected chur church for the last days is what we need that's what we need we need some some real christians that will stand for the truth now isaiah in isaiah chapter 6 verse 1 it says in the year that king uzziah died i saw also the lord sitting upon the throne high and lifted up and his train filled the temple when isaiah got in that atmosphere of that heavenly influence it's changed his whole perspective it changed the way he was looking at things and brother abraham said it drove isaiah to his knees now you know you can set that kind of atmosphere that isaiah isaiah saw that he he got lifted up to the to where he saw that a vision but you know you can change that atmosphere in your home with the music and the things in your home so that so that your kids can be drawn into that same situation that isaiah was drawn in that's what brother brown was trying to explain in this the king was sitting on the throne where is he sitting at now he's sitting on the throne of your heart the first throne was christ there's a throne in heaven the throne of christ when he came to the earth but now he's on your throne and isaiah got caught up into that place where he saw the lord sitting on the throne and he saw his train and it and it filled the temple you know what a train is in the old days they would they would uh when when a king conquered an enemy he would he would keep adding to that throne i was reading this thing on the internet that said the king's train was actually made up of pieces or swatches of the royal robes of defeated kings the conquering king would have portions of the defeated king's robes cut and sown into his own robe as a symbol and testimony of the conqueror's strength and power now you think now he got caught up into a vision of the mighty conqueror the one that could conquer every problem in his life i'm talking about i'm talking about you know whatever it be alcohol or depression or or wanting to grow in grace and knowledge and get rid of all the all the vices of the world and let those things fall away this is the mighty conqueror that had come down from glory to and and he he his the evidence of it that he had all the swatches of all those things all those things that he had defeated so isaiah saw he saw he saw a real king in the vision he saw a real example he saw a vision of every enemy defeated you every enemy can be defeated tonight when he got in the presence of the heavenly king he had been under the influence of an earthly king but he saw the vision of the true king and understood he understood what real influence influence really was you know there's a lot of earthly influences now you might have seen an earthly king or been under the influence of some kind of earthly influence and thought everything was okay whether it's your friends or the world or or all these mindless pastimes or tv shows but when you catch the vision that there's a greater influence there's a heavenly king that longs to be reverenced in humility and active worship then it'll change your perspective what that's what the gospel is the gospel preached brings you into relationship and fellowship with that heavenly king it brings you into a place where you know maybe tonight if you've thought where i've never i've never been in the presence of god i've never felt his presence i don't know if he's real or not but yet the gospel preached will bring you into that kind of an atmosphere i've never had my heart moved i've heard people say that i've never i've never had my heart move their heart gets kind of stony but the bible says in ezekiel 36 that he'll take that stony heart and soften it up soften it up so that the word can have an effect in it that's what the gospel does if you feel like you've never been moved into the holy of holies into that influence into that atmosphere of influence that's what the gospel is for brother abraham said in the handwriting on the wall he said dear heavenly father as i look down here and see men and women bow at the altar under the influence of the gospel oh so happy lord that we have something that puts us under an influence it isn't a strong drink it's the wine of pentecost it influences us to do the right thing to do right it takes all the wrong away and makes it right that's the kind of influence that we've got this afternoon tonight now the bible says in verse two above it stood the seraphims and each one had six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain he fly he he didn't fly so we see the first thing that isaiah saw those the the wings over their face you know whenever you get into the presence of god you're supposed to become reverent when we come into the house of the lord we're supposed to be reverend it's supposed to you why because you realize you realize there's somebody here that ain't it ain't just the minister behind the platform and it ain't just the people sitting next to me sorry kaylee i know she gets she said dad you sound so country sometimes it ain't it ain't this and it ain't that but what it is what it is is this the presence of a living god in his people and we know that god is here because wherever his word he's here and that makes us become reverent you know you think about blind bartimaeus sitting there with his eyes closed and we heard them calling out that jesus was coming he began to recognize that christ was there and he began to get reverent and the bible says he heard that it was jesus of nazareth he began to cry out and say jesus thou son of david have mercy on me and he began to humiliate himself that i i need some help i i need some help moses when he got in the presence of a living god and he took his shoes off out of reverence he wasn't he wasn't there at that burning bush chewing chewing gum and gnawing on it like like he was cracking jokes you know like you know when when you come to church it's supposed to be reverent where you're not chewing chewing gums and cracking jokes and and bringing we you know we don't bring drinks into the church or look on our iphones and ipods and everything because we're we're in a place of reverence reverence paul on the ground when he fell only fell on his face when he saw that light because he knew that there was somebody there and what what i think sometimes we we fail to realize when when it's when that's our home ministers and we kind of get into the same rut and we fail to realize that god is here you believe that tonight that god is still with us and you're in your dark times and your bad times when you come to church and it's the same old ministers up there behind the platform and the same old people at church but yet yet god is still on his throne he's still alive and well i have confidence in that tonight i have you know brother i'm said that they had two wings to cover it over their faith but we've got a blood covering we're covered over by the holy ghost in us tonight the life of christ in us is covering us over and we can have confidence in that tonight and he said he said people have no reverence men take a stand for the word of god and say i'm going to have my congregation cleaned up the first thing you know a complaint comes in from somebody else and they asked him he's got to go out on the street why because they're not convinced of his presence people get so used to the same old they just think it's just common and somebody begins to take a stand for the word of god and they think that god is not in it and he's talking about people throwing throwing ministers out on the street i don't want to hear that anymore because they're not convinced of his presence not convinced of his presence and then they had they that with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and and over their feet because that represented humility and brother adam said and he said here's a good example always be conscious of your littleness not your bigness he said today we americans so much that we try to think that we're big somebody it that's strange that even in the church you know sometimes people want to be big because you think listen the way to go up is the way is to go down as far as you can just get so lit brother brown said in one place he said humility is a way to success if you want to be successful be prepared to be removed and not even have your job anymore be prepared to just step out of the way that's the way to be successful to realize that you could be you could be taking you could go out of the scene and the church would still keep going right along you know you never you never stop and think about that if if you were to die right now your family would keep going right along the church would keep going right along and brother brown compared it to sticking your finger in a bucket and taking your finger out of that bucket and see see what an impression your your finger made in that water that's humility humility that's how you come to success he said that's what that's what makes him god to me because he humbled himself god is humility don't never forget that humility is god humility is god never boastful it's always humility you know cs lewis said humility is not thinking less of yourself as thinking of yourself less because when you're thinking all the time about how great you are and how everybody needs to pay more attention to you and how you deserve this and how you deserve that then you're rising above humility but humility is realizing that you could you could be removed from the equation and everything would just keep right going going along like that woman that bro that that she came to jesus and jesus told her that the meat it's not meat to take the children's bread and cast it to dogs but she humbled herself and said yeah but even when when crumbs fall off the table the the dogs get a little bit of that blessing if you can come with humility like the woman at the well the brother on them said she put her wings quickly over her face when jesus began to call out the sins in her life and began to tell her where she had been wrong and she didn't rile up and said you can't tell me i'm this or i'm that but she she humbled herself and she said i believe i believe you're the messiah he said her wings quickly went over her face the wings went over her feet she said sir sir the best i know you must be a prophet and he said then she went into action come see a man and that's what the next verse is their wings were over their their wings in it flying where they were in action because when you come from the influence of the presence of god it puts you into action and brother i haven't said how it's been through the age how that when men of old and all ages when they would really find the word of god and could grasp it faith went into action right away like peter when jesus told him to cast his net on the other side and he said at that word i'm gonna do it he didn't say well i'm not gonna do it when you when you catch a glimpse of the influence of god you'll go down into the water to be baptized because he told you to do it when you realize that that the the the word says you need to be born again you'll go into action i remember when i first saw saw in the word that i needed to be born again i i certainly went into action something began to cry out within my heart that i need something and maybe tonight if something's within your heart if you can feel that pulse setting in your heart like brother ham talked about and looking to the unseen that you need something maybe it's time to go into the action into action tonight maybe it's time to reach out by faith and and claim maybe maybe it's time to go into action for your family and claim your family and say i i put up with with with disjointedness and and bickering and and all kinds of things in my home long enough and it's time it's time to go into action he said that's right when you got courage to put your faith in action when you see you got faith and afraid to let it go your faith is dead but when you've got faith and willing to let it go then god's confirming it with his signs following and you'll see your healing i i believe like brother wade's always telling us it's time to let our faith go you got faith by the new birth so let it go you got faith in there so so put it to work put it into action for your family put it to work in your prayer life put it to work in your job put it to work and see god come on the scene for you brother ram said in faith in action he said no matter how much faith you got if you won't use it it's no good to you what good is the god of moses if he ain't the same god today what good is a historical god you people who go to church and your church only teaches that some historical fact about the holy ghost coming back on the day of pentecost there's no such a thing today that was healing back there what good does that do to you just no more than reading george washington once lived he's still he's still the same yesterday today and forever god is here we recognize it and we believe it we believe that he's still the same god we believe that he's still here to prove his word and brother ram said in the influence of another he said faith faith ignores all the circumstances it doesn't look at symptoms it ignores what people say it's not ashamed it has no hindrance it knows where it stands it says shut up and sit down it won't take no for an answer you think about that tonight maybe when you're going home the faith will not take no for an answer maybe if you're looking at your family and it's all in disarray and your kids are doing things they shouldn't be doing and maybe your spouse is doing stuff they're not maybe you're doing stuff that you shouldn't be doing reach out by faith and don't take no for an answer because if god's promise if it's laying there in his word he promised it and he's going to produce it and mary's belief brother ryan said it's not me to try to figure it out it takes the word of the holy spirit he was the one who made the promise he's the one who confirms the promise and he's obligated to keep that promise so spread your wings out spread your wings out of reverence and humility of action take god at his word because god's calling us higher you know he's calling us higher than those seraphims he's calling us to position of the sons and daughters of the king he's calling us into an atmosphere now the bible says above it stood the seraphims and we'll close in just a minute i don't intend to keep you too long tonight each one has six wings with twain he covered his face and with twain he covered his feet and with twain it did fly and one cried unto another and said holy holy holy is the lord of hosts the whole earth is full of glory and that brought that brought isaiah to a place of confession where he began to he said i then said i woe is me for i am undone because i am a man of unclean lips and i dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips for mine eyes have seen the king the lord of hosts it brought him to a place of true worship where he realized he had been looking at the wrong at the wrong thing he thought he could see all that time he was looking at uzziah but all this time his lips were unclean and he didn't realize it and he began to look inward to realize woe is me he had been misplaced in his reverence your your your reverence is misplaced if you're looking at yourself or looking at others but if you look at jesus christ we're so preoccupied and looking with one another you know but our our enemy is it ourselves our enemies and you know what a confession a confession like isaiah made a confession is when you begin to admit that you're wrong a confession is that a mission or acknowledgement that one has done something that one is ashamed or embarrassed about he acknowledged that he was wrong and that's when the seraphim came down with a live coal in his hand which he had taken with the tones from off the altar and he laid it upon his mouth and said lo and isaiah said lo this hath touched thy lips and thine iniquity is taken away and thy sin purged brother in the message testimony he said i tell you this old-time religion brother has straightened you up that's what this gospel is for us to straighten us up to clean up our lives so we can rock straight he said it'll make a silk dress and a calico put their arms around one another and call sister is that right it'll make a tuxedo suit and a pair of overalls call each other brother that's what it'll do what what does it do it's changing your nature it changes you that's why you've got to be born again it'll change the way you think it'll change your desires it'll change you so that we you won't want to marry a girl you young man you won't want to marry a girl walking around with pants showing herself off to the world and you young ladies you won't want to marry some some knucklehead with his his hair slicked back and don't know nothing about god and doesn't love you or love god it'll change what you're after it'll change it'll change your it he said it'll clean you up it'll it tears down that self and starch and pride that we've got it tears all that down that's right these young men coming around their knuckleheads i'll see it again that makes people laugh but yes sir and listen any god any christian man has a right to stand at the door of his home and say and and and call black black and white white when when you've you've got a right to protect your home listen that cherubim come down with a coal of fire off the altar that he had took with his tongues and and he cleaned things up that's what that's what the gospel is for that's what god wants to do in your life tonight it's clean things up he don't want you living in sin he don't want you living in the muck and the mire of the world but he wants you to live a clean holy life with a testimony where you can influence other people now now you young people and old people are like and everybody in between wouldn't you love tonight to have an influence have a life like that where you could have with you know one of the greatest things that you can have your kids to ever say is you have been an influence to me wouldn't you love to have your children tonight or people in the church look to you as an influence that i know and i'm thinking here tonight as i'm saying these things there's many of you tonight that i think of when i think of prayer warriors and people that are touched by other things that people are going through and people that are helps and people that have helped me that have been an influence to me i'm thinking about you tonight that you were an influence to me you are an influence what a great testimony to be an influence to other people the bible says in in verse 8 also i heard the voice of the lord saying whom shall i see and then who will go for us then said i hear am i send me because when god when god calls you when you made your confession and when he cleans you up he wants to clean you up so he can do something with you that's what the baptism of the holy ghost is for so that he can come and live in you and be an influence to people and he'll commission you he puts you into service into his army that's what a commission is when when a military officer gets this commission is to go and be an officer in the army and you've been commissioned when you receive the baptism of the holy ghost the musicians can go ahead and come forward to be to be an officer in the
