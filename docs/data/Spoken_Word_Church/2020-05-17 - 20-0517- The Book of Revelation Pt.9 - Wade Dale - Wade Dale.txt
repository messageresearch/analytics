========================================

all right ladies mother come in instead around we've got social distancing going on except for the younger people in the back y'all are immune to everything yeah this yeah anyway all right we're on the church ages and we're at we've been in the last church age so this is one we're living in so we see all this happening literally at the moment we see it happening that now we're looking at a sequence where Jesus said he said I know thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot he would that you either be colder hunt when we see now that the lukewarm people being brother Chris alone were discussing this about this modest thing and it really does if the biased thing has done what I said before it's really show dude get up he's got it and don't die and and you can't help it but if you don't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost you go run scared yeah turn that almost like you've got a right scared so that's another thing I thought the day about we need to put that air conditioner in that window before some of them if you don't it's gonna be hot back here for 20 years yeah but we've been sweating it but if you put that out it'll it'll dehumidifier back though the walls so it'll take care of both things somebody I do it with we can buy somebody does but they wants to buy do it - that's but they have such a poor mr. Schue okay we have a lot of suggestions nobody let's just remember sister Barbara's on her way to church and her car backing up a little bit so it's gonna make mention any prayer says unto the Angel of the Church of the Laodiceans write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now why is it saying the beginning of the creation of God as we were talking about the talk a little more about the two and a half tribes in your tights you see that the Holy Ghost came hold the dead Pentecost back in the book of Acts not 1906 but all the way back and it came to a group of people and that was truly the beginning of the creation of God in that point but what happened during the church ages is that the word lost is the fact by a man's tradition and by all these things that come up in the history that kind of deluded you can't it's like I think about this morning you know Bill Graham said the Holy Ghost was a timid person so he just kind of was like okay this is what you're going to believe then you know we just have to go with it he knew that and he made provision for Luther and Wesley to get their inheritance but they come back on this side of Jordan which wasn't the full inheritance which is what the statue of a perfect man the adoption that here you hand the headstone the headstone was over here in the placement land not over here in on this side Jordan right Christ the headstone which is right here yeah they didn't get it down here they got the cornerstone Bible even telling us they get the cornerstone which is the chief in stone but they got him in a little small portion all these Church ages consent before the first church age with a powerful church age though they had to pure unadulterated Word of God for three church ages so there was no denominational churches but there were denominational ideas so there wasn't an ama national spirit because like program said send the Holy Spirit came on the earth the other fare came on the air you know Judas in Jesus twins than ever reliable even on the day of Pentecost 1906 and Lu the street died came on the scene and then I was talking to a man last night a nominal preacher we got some beads out of a recliner but on the back porch it was very easy to get so he's have known the preacher and he was asking me about you know about what I thought about did God create this virus I said no I can't create a virus but Satan can take something in perverted and God can allow it well God will allow down through the turf changes he allowed because he had already said the corn a week was going in the ground so it hadn't gone the ground subway and once when it went in the ground it went in the ground because of the dark ages but now what did he promise I will restore the years that the four that's why that four is so important why that's being on brother the elements be going on forever in and a lot of people miss that because you say well I only goes I'm done well that's not just the holy up and you're done this is God in human flesh not miss it in this age don't see this is not right go ahead this wasn't commanded in any other ad now what happened was in the beginning in the beginning I'm talking about way back before time in the beginning God had this plan it was a perfect plan and he was gonna see it executed that's what program said on Christ amidst regard revealed me a plan of the firm he's going to see achieve but he had to allow all this to happen he had to allow this violence to happen he had to allow in 1906 comes Azusa Street him right after that from 1906 man the brothers were talking about he he realized 1906 22 straight now they were about to finish off the revival but what happened was they didn't see that the bug started eating right then and here you got world war what happened was it's they rejected the 1906 Azusa Street movement I said this other 9:30 Azusa Street revival they rejected that revival god-sent played war and play what brother Graham say he said God sends a messenger on the scene preaches his message and as soon as he comes on the saying God puts and he leaves this thing God puts a plague on the earth right so it's exactly what's happening now the way I see it is is that the true seed is going to have to be hung up on the tour ladder than just being over here in the part of the promised land cuz we'll talk about a little bit more today that we didn't get into last week last Wednesday whatever was that this was not and the promised land but it was part of the Promised Land the Promised Land was crossed door but they had to fight over here but who gave them that land that's important Moses gave them that land Moses gabled that land before he died but Moses said in so many works he didn't say no words he told guards like I can't go over he didn't go over South typing that we have a prophet coming the endtime told us that this was okay luther weston print off was okay that was part of the promised land but it wasn't the promise the promise was full authority over here in the in the promised land and he put Joshua which is our top of the Holy Ghost here is the one that takes us over to what full adoption because brother Branham was at the headstone he was a prophet he was one of the angel one of the prophets that spoke and then he had to leave just like Moses said okay it's all right y'all can have this land but now what you got to do is you kind of Hoover and help your brothers fight this land out then you come back here and you can settle in justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost because remember Luther's justification won't put us in the promised land you can't it won't now it starts your journey but we've talked about for months dad you die you you'll be given eternal life but you're not a bride now if you were in Luther's as though you've been a bride because the corn of wheat was coming up to two shoots they may cover a little bit more today but remember the two shoots don't look like the corn but every like that and they were going to produce is in them to shoot every corn every week every town every watermelon every anything is Indian two shoots because that's where the life is so Luther had life but he did not look like to see one he was over here this part of I went in the promised land that's why I said you gotta remember that the the baptism of the Holy Ghost is I promised land but when the corn of wheat went in the ground God had to start them back from scratch or back from two shoots over in this side of the promised land and then the stock and this side from Flint and part of Pentecost which carried over into the promised land so we got to come to four stages one two three four the fourth stage is the placing in the land and the beginning of the creation of God what is the beginning of the creation of God when Jesus Christ became human flesh on the earth through the womb of a woman that was the beginning of the creation of God that's what should have happened had they not been a father had they not been followed that was what would have happened in the Garden of Eden Adam and Eve would have had children by the spoken word not my said my spoken word but she would have had the kid brother Ivan tells us and I you know you you think sometimes you worry about something brother Brown said he said to Jesus Christ you have come through 80 what do you you kind of think about that yet but the body should have come through it's once you look at it though it's so simple where did Jesus's body come from dude woman man but we wouldn't have needed uses true well he would have walked on earth in human flesh God's always wanted to be a human being with he's always been a human being but he always wanted someplace to walk around me so he gave him part of that he gave me a party part of that to Adam which would make him a son of God gave him full authority but when he had to take him back he said I gotta go now which he didn't say I got to go mammal he needed the whole plan so he comes him into the church ages he works in parts all the way through this is all in parts of the members this is on this style promised land it is part of growling because the baptism the Holy Ghost is the promised land but the baptism the Holy Ghost week plus our plus is that four states which is an unlined ox man an eagle which is just insane take about ten mil ago and what a full restoration of the word are placing our adoption because here's the whole thing no one has never been required to stand on earth and defy death and cause a resurrection to happen it was not in the first stage second third fourth fifth sixth and even in to the seventh age except into the end of it if I got that because Pentecost is part of that age guy blood when God sent a prophet this angel when he sent a prophet to speak these things to bring us up a little bit higher the faithful and true witness now I preached him that one time because remember that wasn't that he was a false witness back over the fact through the Turk ages true is like your tuning fork it's not fall but when you hit that tuning fork and it vibrates see that means it's a true see Sam or a D or near whatever you want to call it so when the true that means that it was false brother groundcovers that church age book but we covered it a little bit further when we looked at that word true brother Branham had to come because nobody but Jesus Christ everyone out of here so this this the reason the Prophet is son this in time messenger and to bring the trim work for us or to get to that place because we've got these body spirit and soul all for leave not that because that's the beginning of Grace in the God though Jesus's body was not eternal when he was born a baby from Mary it became heater it was changed and became eternal when do you rate when he raised from the dead it was the glorified body he was made eternal and that was the same body that was born from the womb of marriage so he didn't change or Eckstein's but what he did in the end time he comes back as you'll see down here that there they put him out of the church with all the dogma they put him out of the church it's a sad thing it's a sad thing to see though that you look out here well then I will come like this other day that's sincere there some people would make us look bad being sincere as far as doing works and thinking that they're but in this age folks if you're not bright your policy so that's the faithful and true witness the beginning of the crease of God that's why look you got real big lot of Christianity in the world within it starts only a brother medicine owns up to where the right here could a razor's edge right there at the point raising things now if you're standing on a Razors Edge well you can't you can't go I can't even go a quarter of a thousandth of a centimeter off if you do like brother Brown said if you get off on this side guess what happens what happens right here if you fall off on one side of the other you keep going off that's why Garnett sent a prophet and we got to know him believe that he was a true prophet now some people think that he's just a prophet or somebody came into the into the land and just preached an extra serving earn an extra few sermons I don't see that he had to bring the pure unadulterated were so we could stand right there on that needlepoint or on that right on that page they not fall off one way in the other but we see people now like that's talking to Mexico we see people falling off and brother Hamza the only way you can get back is go back right there because you can never go there never is a way that you poured water right here that water couldn't come back and do this right here that water just keeps flowing off away from the truth and that's what's happening right here because Jesus said I know that works that thou art neither cold nor hot anyone to table colder tonight why because in a lukewarm state what's with warm man it's just it just feels good and we'll stay right here that's what a lot of people say but we've got to be hot the colder going to get cold the harder going to get hot and then you got that lukewarm individual are the foolish virgin are the people that are deceived that are in a lukewarm condition because what he said I'll spew thee out of my mouth so in other words you don't become a part of me anymore I'm going to expel you because what happened down here they expelled him somewhere somewhere they put him outside the door so then because I was lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew you out of my mouth [Music] because now says I am rich and increased with Goods now you can take that into natural because there's never been a rich or aged even with this coronavirus thing there's never been a richer age of people being this multi billionaire from multi something getting up into the trillion so I don't rinse and increase with Goods and have need of nothing but you gotta take that to the spiritual part we've got internet we've got the message in our pocket we've got every 1,100 sermons in our right now and we cannot do anything yes and we can listen to them somebody around the world we can listen to the message and help you almost if you have a iPhone watch you can do it through that you know so we've come down to where we think man what else do we need I know it's not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and white raiment that thou let us be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with I said that I might see it then brother Daniel Martinez preached this sermon here several years ago and then when it how many is in here that's for the I says all these things beats I'm gonna give you a way to get back you think you're rich I'm going to give you gold tried in the fire that you may be rich what Ramon's that you may be cloak cause you're naked and don't know it and that shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve the time I say so you got miserable poor blind and naked guys gonna reverse that clothe us open our eyes see because the rest of the world blind but the rest of the world says no we got 20/20 we've got LASIK surgery now we can't see we don't need glasses anymore right in the natural so the same way in the spiritual God has to take that laser laser surgery and do surgery on your high not too high up here but I have your understanding that there may be clothed also that you think I brother ransom in an awful if you see some I walking around you go hey buddy any place we call them I'm close that's what they don't have you been go Walmart they'll prove that they have no eyesight that their birthdates is gone yes that's right will smile and buying groceries like nothing's don't know why because what the world's to see the world is blind literally not literally but literally in the spiritual world where they should be the greatest message of overcoming face of the earth and we have full availability of it nobody wants it you tell people we were talking is that brother yesterday he's a preacher and he he started this little assembly praise a long long time ago he said where does your church at know that he's just two blocks back that way I said right to the side bus for Audrey's and he just kind of looked at me and it was either he knew and already heard about us or he didn't even know we were here I said we've been there since nineteen said what you wanted he just never come in it again so you see what I mean you can be right here beside this church let me put it this one you can be inside this jerk and be funny so I don't want the ice out that I may see what's going on as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door knock let's get finished with this and look there they all not stand at the door not know what's he doing they put him outside the church brother Brown said and I believe they put him outside the message church because they only they won't shouting the speaking in tongues and they want the feelings and the emotions but they don't want that son of man in human flesh they don't want that further of the gospel for somebody to come in and teach them how to be not teaching to be a son of God because if you're born again you're selling on but to come up just a little bit higher to come up with that eagle anointing to where you can see further never never think that when this church or any other church talks about other churches not being further in the word they're not lost could be but but if they have the baptism my Holy Ghost they're right but there may be a better name not the arm yeah they got to go by the grave they won't come to this beginning of the creation of God because in the beginning of creation of God when this was supposed to happen before the fall we were going to come to earth and our body was going to be made eternal because what brother Graham said how many buddy was not eternal but it was being made eternal they would keep walking if they would have got to the Tree of Life nice London that's why the scripture says we can't let them get to this tree anymore because they got their eyes open and they know what's going on if they can get to that tree there will be God's like we are well that's why I go I've had to shut it off but now remember that tree life of Jesus Christ what did he do he come right back it was a tree in the garden it was Jesus standing there all right and say yeah tell that's your two forces you know you got a good needle and then what showed up when Jesus showed up Judas so they have you got your good and evil one showed up in 1906 a zoo the street good and evil then here comes World War one with all the nerve gases and all the things they said this was no that was the world war to end all World War several million people will kill and that didn't put a punctuation mark on it God sent a plague Spanish flu or everywhere you want to call it they devastated the world right after that so but then now right after they don't want to happen brother Brad was born 1909 so in 1918 never I don't feel that something in 1918 here comes the flu will grow the grounds nine years old and he's heading toward a revival I told y'all before right and I didn't really bring in the Spanish flu but there was not any cure for any of this so what if I say God sent a healing campaign because the Christian people in the world cried out and God just like now we should be crying that thought would be a vaccine we need something to help us so God sent a prophet with healing campaign so it's really done works in continuity all the time he doesn't kind of the wet over here if you'll see his word just like we've been talking about the journey of a believer all the way from out of Abraham Isaac all the way through and then we jump to Ruth and today we're going to jump over into extra for a little while it's always typing us as believers and our journey that we should be taking leave behold I stand - door knock If any man hear my voice hear my voice and open the door I will come in with him and will sup with him and he would meet what communion God wants communion you don't the water beats atomically through the door and what is that door that door non-physical door it's the door whatever you got even blocked up then to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne now look look how intimate this is and all the other church ages he said I'll give you the tree of life I'll give you the star I'll give you this I'll give you that never was it as intimate as this is today in the end time this is the intimacy of God he's bringing us in to sit not just on the throne with him hey that's it then in in my throne even as I also overcoming them sat down with my father in his drum I my father won and the prize won with him but though there was been talking about building the son of man it's not three different throne sitting up there it's one throne with three different manifestations of the person sitting on the throne even ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches and thank God we were able to hear what was given to us in this end time and even with all this going on with this virus folks we got to remember one thing this world does not know what the end of this is going to be in both Canada from about this he does they do not know so that make what what's better fear is not knowing fear is not knowing what's going to happen but you and I should have no fear we know we already read the paper 60 years ago but what this thing is coming to know we didn't know it was a corona virus but still it's Bible is passed from person to person just like a bad spirit and everything else it but so is the Holy Spirit amen you get around people that love the Lord when you when you love the Lord right so there's the church ages there's no mortar cages and then we come up to revelations forces look after this I'll look and behold a door was open in heaven programs on that that's the rapture go after the church age is over now not literally this church age goes on past I'm working several church age goes all the way through the millennia heaven if I got that that's the old Sabbath day you're not in the 8th Dan you're in the anything-goes you born again but you a day is the new city so the layout and turf days continue to all the lane that whole thousand year that's the old seventh day program explained that mainly meeting in Brad yeah it's not the world no phosphates on and go gone that's right all right let's go [Music] [Applause] [Music]
