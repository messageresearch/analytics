[0:03] we didn't use it last week
[0:06] well what they've done is they said it
[0:07] [Music]
[0:09] they said it
[0:11] for
[0:12] somebody to come down here and watch
[0:13] live streaming when they come in during
[0:14] the middle of service
[0:16] in the morning so it really messed the
[0:18] whole thing up for me
[0:19] because they checked it you have to
[0:21] totally change it
[0:22] so we just changed it back
[0:25] so anyway
[0:27] so now we're in romans 8 we've been
[0:28] reading about romans eight we've uh
[0:32] had sermon after sermon
[0:35] preach to us about us but we're going to
[0:36] read it
[0:37] break it down into three stages of
[0:39] adoption
[0:42] because brother dale always says you
[0:44] have to
[0:45] watch
[0:46] peter peter wrote
[0:48] in second peter and to your face virtue
[0:50] your virgin knowledge you know it's ten
[0:51] percent patience
[0:53] these things be in you and abound they
[0:54] make you want to grow up into the statue
[0:56] of a perfect man so now what's paul
[0:58] doing paul's telling you how to do it
[1:01] peter's telling you what to do
[1:03] paul's telling you how to do it this is
[1:05] exactly the if you want a blueprint on
[1:07] adoption this is your blueprint this is
[1:09] your
[1:10] abc all right this is your a
[1:16] a is right here
[1:22] for as many as are led by the spirit of
[1:24] god they are the sons of god
[1:26] for ye have not received the spirit of
[1:28] bondage and into fear but you have
[1:29] received the spirit of adoption not
[1:31] adopting the spirit of adoption
[1:33] because
[1:36] you're adopted when you're a baby
[1:38] according to christ in the new birth
[1:40] you're adopted into the family
[1:43] uh the prodigal son was a son
[1:46] he was born in family he was a son so
[1:49] you got to get born again to get in to
[1:51] receive that spirit of adoption
[1:53] you were not born with that spirit
[1:56] right we we had to receive
[1:59] the spirit of adoption whereby we cry
[2:02] and abba is father father so we cry
[2:04] daddy daddy
[2:05] we're crying we're babies we're newborn
[2:07] babies like brother we're talking about
[2:08] now
[2:09] newborn babies in christ is right here
[2:12] the spirit itself bearing witness with
[2:14] our spirit that we are the children of
[2:16] god so that puts you in another
[2:18] community it puts you in another
[2:21] family
[2:23] your family here on earth is good and
[2:25] all that
[2:27] but when jesus stood up one day and said
[2:29] can you forsake father mother sister
[2:31] brother and follow me right
[2:34] um
[2:36] seems hard but still
[2:39] uh you know it's kind of like situations
[2:40] i've told you before you
[2:43] and and no reflection to louise but i'm
[2:45] going to say it anyway
[2:47] but you got people coming in that are
[2:48] unbelievers and then you stay out of
[2:50] church to be with them
[2:51] to me that's not a testimony that's not
[2:53] a
[2:54] that's not a witness
[2:56] because you know what they're watching
[2:58] every move you make that's true you know
[3:00] you see people coming and you know what
[3:03] it's good to see people that you ain't
[3:04] seen a long time but that's that's
[3:06] natural family members that's right but
[3:08] they're watching you jim's dad for years
[3:10] would show up on sunday or saturday
[3:12] night
[3:13] what he may not be doing that
[3:15] intentionally
[3:17] right but inside of him the spirit that
[3:20] motivated him was going if you'll go
[3:22] over there visit them they'll stay gone
[3:24] on sunday and and you know uh wha what
[3:27] kind of
[3:28] testimony do they have
[3:30] no we went to church that's right left
[3:33] her down we tell her daddy said you can
[3:34] go with us or you can be here when we
[3:36] get back a lot of times he'd go to amy's
[3:38] house or a lot of times he'd come to
[3:39] church or a lot of times you waited we
[3:41] got back well you know what he knows now
[3:44] not to show up on sunday and if he does
[3:46] show up on sunday or even wednesday
[3:47] night we're going to be a church
[3:50] and he does come to a wednesday and
[3:51] he'll come with us but see that's a
[3:53] witness we there's got to be a witness
[3:55] we we can't witness
[3:58] uh you know taking vacations no it's
[4:00] fine right but you see people when their
[4:02] family comes in town you know from
[4:04] somewhere else and they're not believers
[4:05] well the first thing they do is doubt
[4:06] church
[4:07] well they're going in there in their
[4:09] mind i know they're going
[4:11] they just really you know that ain't
[4:14] really not that different it's not that
[4:16] different you know we're okay being out
[4:18] on sunday they're okay being out on
[4:19] sunday we no you gotta have a witness
[4:21] you gotta be a witness you gotta be a
[4:23] strong witness
[4:24] how you gonna bring them in
[4:26] this right
[4:28] how you going to bring them in and
[4:29] you'll be gone right how are you going
[4:31] to do that
[4:32] you can't
[4:33] you've got to stay there is a witness of
[4:36] our spirit
[4:38] our spirit that we're the children of
[4:40] god and if children then heirs heirs of
[4:44] god now what's he doing here he's
[4:46] showing you that you are a child you're
[4:48] a child of god
[4:50] if you're a child of god
[4:52] you're god's children your god may
[4:54] manifest in another form called a child
[4:56] at that point
[4:58] okay
[4:59] a baby
[5:01] because and if children
[5:03] then airs because you know what i didn't
[5:05] become an heir of the dale fortune
[5:08] when i got
[5:09] 30
[5:10] or 20. yeah no i got it all when they
[5:13] when they call me by name and give me a
[5:16] give mama a birth certificate
[5:18] yeah right
[5:21] hey y'all right i get it all right so i
[5:24] said she should have never had no more
[5:25] kids with me i could have ever been left
[5:27] for
[5:28] ever
[5:30] it would have been his fun though
[5:34] no it would not know just right it
[5:36] wasn't it'd have been a little it would
[5:38] have been different
[5:39] but if children didn't air so what do
[5:41] you do when you come into the family of
[5:42] god
[5:43] he gives it all to you right but now
[5:46] in
[5:47] in an example point
[5:52] know saying
[5:53] mom and dad had
[5:54] 10 million dollars and they were gonna
[5:56] give me a million dollars
[5:58] they're not going to give me a million
[5:59] dollars when i'm 10.
[6:01] right i it's mine
[6:04] it's mine
[6:05] the whole 10's mine if i didn't have to
[6:06] share it with them other kids
[6:08] the whole
[6:11] but the thing about them
[6:13] but the thing about what god don't see
[6:14] he have 10 million dollars and give you
[6:16] 10 million dollars and then he give the
[6:18] next person 10 million dollars
[6:20] so we're just using it as an example i
[6:22] know we're laughing but we it is an
[6:24] example because when you become a
[6:26] children a child of god you get
[6:27] everything that's right but he doesn't
[6:30] give you a key to the car
[6:31] or he doesn't give you the million
[6:33] dollars until you're you know 18 or
[6:34] whatever more
[6:36] you know whatever more age you are
[6:39] because
[6:40] why you can't handle it that's right
[6:43] you
[6:45] as brother brown says power without
[6:47] character you got the million dollars
[6:50] that's the power that's right that's
[6:51] right but without character you'll do
[6:53] just like the prodigal son does give it
[6:55] to me now and i'm going out and i'm
[6:57] going to squander it
[6:59] same way with god god's not going to
[7:00] guess why it took 60 years
[7:03] to do a work of restoration so that now
[7:05] god can hand it to not children
[7:08] but mature people
[7:10] mature sons and daughters of god not
[7:12] children anymore what did paul say not
[7:15] being children tossed to and fro by
[7:16] everyone the doctrine and the slave of
[7:19] man and the cunning is the kindness of
[7:20] man in the slightest
[7:22] of the devil all right
[7:25] but you were a child when you were born
[7:27] yes
[7:28] you had full
[7:29] you got full
[7:31] rights and benefits
[7:34] and then what did your
[7:35] daddy do he come down in human flesh and
[7:37] he died
[7:39] he died to give you that inheritance
[7:41] because look heirs of god
[7:43] now that was the genesis 1 26 man see
[7:46] the heirs of god is before the
[7:47] foundation of the world if you ever was
[7:49] in the mind of god in the eternal
[7:51] section you always within that eternal
[7:52] section amen
[7:54] all right so there's your heirs of god
[7:57] of god back up here
[7:59] and join heirs with christ now who is
[8:01] christ
[8:02] we know he's anointing one but christ is
[8:04] what human flesh the man in his god in
[8:06] human flesh
[8:07] so what did he do
[8:09] he came down and gave us eternal life
[8:11] but remember what brother brown said
[8:12] join heirs with christ christ said to
[8:14] come here get eternal life in his flesh
[8:17] inherit
[8:18] inherit heirs means you inherited he
[8:21] inherited eternal life in his flesh
[8:24] amen and that's what we're working
[8:25] toward
[8:26] but it's not going to happen when you're
[8:28] a baby
[8:29] because you have problems you fall you
[8:30] know you spill your food
[8:33] pop of god sometimes has to clean up for
[8:35] you
[8:36] clean you up right
[8:39] that's why i like the the scripture that
[8:41] says that godhead can be explained by
[8:42] the things you see just our human life
[8:45] you can explain what god goes to
[8:46] especially if you're a parent
[8:48] you look at the kids and you go
[8:52] i didn't do that to you i didn't make
[8:54] you you know
[8:55] but i give you all these provisions
[8:58] i mean he gives you he gives us the
[8:59] bible he gives us preaching gives us
[9:01] teaching he gives us um
[9:04] elders and
[9:05] people to teach if we'll listen
[9:08] if children then heirs heirs of god
[9:11] what eternal life in our soul
[9:13] and join heirs with christ eternal life
[9:14] here if so be that we suffer with him
[9:18] that we may be also glorified together
[9:21] all right so we're coming from
[9:24] from receiving the spirit of adoption to
[9:26] glorification right here in just a few
[9:27] sentences
[9:29] but then paul so graciously tells us
[9:32] what's going on okay for i reckon that
[9:35] the suffering of this present time are
[9:37] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[9:40] which shall be revealed in us
[9:43] in us so what happens is god's going to
[9:45] reveal itself not on paper
[9:48] not in a video right not on the tape
[9:52] [Music]
[9:54] but in us
[9:55] so whatever that is external has got to
[9:58] come in here right because it's got to
[10:00] be revealed in us
[10:03] then what do we do we display it back
[10:06] out
[10:07] from right here this is where we display
[10:09] it back out because what did what did uh
[10:12] let's get on down there for i reckon
[10:14] that's suffering this present time we're
[10:15] not worthy to be compared with the glory
[10:17] shall be revealed enough for the earnest
[10:19] earnest what earnest money the down
[10:21] payment
[10:22] expectation of the creature or the
[10:24] creation waiteth for the manifestation
[10:27] of the sons of god
[10:28] all right
[10:30] waiteth waited we've been waiting since
[10:32] adam fell because that's what he said
[10:34] right here for the creature creation
[10:37] was made subject to vanity not willingly
[10:42] the animals didn't fall that's right man
[10:45] fell which took everything else down
[10:47] okay so if the whole creation is waiting
[10:49] on the manifestation of the son of god
[10:51] it's got to start with the person that
[10:53] that fell
[10:55] man fail so we're the highest order so
[10:57] once we're restored they're waiting on
[11:00] us to come to restoration so that
[11:02] everything else can come to restoration
[11:04] right
[11:06] you don't have to go out there and say
[11:08] when we become manifested sons of god
[11:10] you know i'm saying i treat you don't
[11:12] die no more
[11:13] no it's just not gonna die anymore
[11:15] when we go to when we go even to the
[11:18] future we go to the future home
[11:20] we're not gonna have to walk out all the
[11:21] time ago now trey don't you die
[11:24] no animal don't you that no that's all
[11:26] gonna be not even in our vocabulary
[11:28] because the whole creature is going to
[11:30] be restored
[11:32] we'll talk about a look at that this
[11:33] afternoon we've got to talk a little bit
[11:35] more on restoration before we go back to
[11:36] the sun man man brother that we're
[11:38] talking about some things tuesday
[11:40] that we need to bring to light maybe so
[11:42] that we can see
[11:44] truly what we're doing here so the
[11:45] creature was made subject to vanity
[11:47] which in other words fail
[11:50] not willingly
[11:52] that's why the bear looks at you and
[11:53] wants to eat you now the tiger and all
[11:55] that you know that's not willingly but
[11:57] they willingly don't want to do that
[11:59] that first spirit that they got in the
[12:01] garden of eden was not to kill that's
[12:03] right
[12:05] but it was turned to that that's right
[12:08] by the
[12:10] um
[12:12] which made seventh man willing but by a
[12:14] reason of him who has subjected the same
[12:16] in hope in other words adam couldn't do
[12:18] it so there's another man coming a
[12:20] second adam
[12:22] all creation is hoping
[12:25] now listen
[12:27] all creation you say all creation was
[12:29] was looking for something i was thinking
[12:31] about this a couple days ago
[12:36] let me get this right because i want to
[12:38] talk about it this afternoon
[12:41] the whole creation wasn't waiting on
[12:42] jesus to come
[12:47] no
[12:48] the whole creation is not waiting on
[12:49] jesus to come
[12:51] right he's already coming left and he's
[12:52] still fat all right
[12:55] still falling didn't fat didn't fall but
[12:57] it's still falling
[13:00] who's old creation wait no
[13:02] us
[13:04] now it's not us without christ that's
[13:06] right
[13:07] christ came here to make a way
[13:10] for us for this to happen but the whole
[13:13] creation is not waiting on jesus christ
[13:17] in the form that he came in flesh and
[13:18] walked as a son of man that's right
[13:20] everybody okay with that
[13:22] because what happened as soon as jesus
[13:23] left the earth
[13:25] he didn't restore everything
[13:27] that's what we're going to get to this
[13:28] afternoon christ didn't restore
[13:30] everything he said elijah must come and
[13:33] restore all things well that elijah
[13:34] ministries what's going to restore
[13:36] everything
[13:37] sure but jesus said i am the way the
[13:39] truth and life has got to come through
[13:40] him
[13:41] but he's not going to be physically
[13:42] standing here when it's restored
[13:47] now now he will be in the millennium but
[13:50] that's even not restoration
[13:53] that ain't restoration it's still the
[13:55] old seventh day it's still the devil's
[13:57] still alive there's still days and
[13:59] nights and times and seasons and
[14:01] and all that
[14:03] so
[14:04] full restoration only comes in the in
[14:06] the future home that's right
[14:09] that's right
[14:11] so it'll change our mentality a little
[14:13] bit maybe if we
[14:15] and i think if jesus was standing here
[14:16] he wouldn't say now wait a minute what
[14:18] are you forgetting me for no that's not
[14:20] it
[14:21] the whole creation is waiting on a
[14:22] manifestation of the sons of god
[14:29] he was the son of man that's right right
[14:33] okay
[14:34] maybe we'll get into something this
[14:35] afternoon
[14:36] we got to interject a little something
[14:37] before we keep going
[14:39] excuse me for the earnest expectation of
[14:40] the creature
[14:42] or
[14:43] waiteth for the manifestation of the
[14:45] sons of god
[14:47] and you say whatever you want to if you
[14:49] say jesus was the son of the son of god
[14:51] or the son of man that says sons that's
[14:53] right so it's going to take a group
[14:55] that's right
[14:56] all right
[14:57] for the creature was made subject to
[14:59] vanity not willingly but by reason of
[15:01] him who has subjected the same in hope
[15:04] in other words they are looking for
[15:05] something to come
[15:09] even the prophets i've been reading in
[15:11] jeremiah ezekiel
[15:13] nehemiah
[15:15] zachariah all those small
[15:18] you look if you'll read them with a
[15:19] little bit of
[15:21] of open mindedness a little bit i guess
[15:23] and let the lord speak to you
[15:26] they're not talking about israel being
[15:27] restored that's right
[15:30] that natural part is going to happen
[15:32] but you and i have got to be restored
[15:34] first
[15:35] the prophets were all groaning and even
[15:38] even poor
[15:40] bless noah's heart
[15:42] uh noah comes out and he
[15:44] and he preaches to nineveh and
[15:47] and or jonah sorry jonah preaches to
[15:49] nineveh
[15:50] [Music]
[15:51] and they all
[15:52] repent they all turn back
[15:57] jonah goes up on the hill
[16:00] and steps up there and goes good
[16:03] why don't you do that
[16:04] if he goes you're walking why'd you do
[16:06] that why don't you just kill me remember
[16:10] what was jonah you know what i believe
[16:11] god said jonah god said jonah
[16:14] you started this whole thing
[16:16] you didn't do what i said to start with
[16:19] you were running for me i'm just showing
[16:21] you that i'm restoring you and this
[16:24] whole group of people
[16:28] jonah
[16:29] you know jonah really though those
[16:30] prophets had one thing in mind they
[16:32] condemned the people
[16:33] yeah
[16:34] now they wrote a restoration but when
[16:36] they stepped out they would condemn the
[16:38] people
[16:39] that's what jonah did repent yes
[16:42] repent
[16:44] i've been in a well for three days
[16:45] repent
[16:48] but jonah didn't realize what got him to
[16:50] the whale
[16:52] was his problem
[16:53] and god restored him even
[16:56] even though it didn't look like it but i
[16:58] believe he kind of tapped no on
[17:00] john on the shoulder and said
[17:04] you need to you need to think about you
[17:08] because you saved the whole nation or a
[17:10] whole city here
[17:12] i saved the whole nation city through
[17:14] you
[17:15] and now you're sitting up here moaning
[17:16] and groaning and that's what we do you
[17:18] know what yes but see the new birth
[17:20] though takes that away because all the
[17:22] prophets didn't have the new birth so
[17:23] they could condemn and have that fire in
[17:25] their heart like even
[17:28] um elisha
[17:30] well i shouldn't want to kill them she
[17:32] bears i mean kill those children
[17:35] right but he got a little bit in his
[17:37] spirit realm but he didn't have a holy
[17:39] ghost in his soul
[17:40] the anointing was off of him but the
[17:42] anointing was still there
[17:44] to honor what the prophet said
[17:46] and it doesn't show that but in my
[17:48] humanity and in his humanity i believe
[17:51] he really regretted that
[17:53] i don't believe he stood there and
[17:54] watched him meet the kids
[17:56] i believe he probably run off somewhere
[17:58] and cried and begged to god yeah
[18:01] for what had happened okay but see there
[18:03] was nothing to restore him there was
[18:04] nothing to turn him back
[18:06] right
[18:07] so we'll get into that a little bit this
[18:08] afternoon because the creature itself
[18:10] also look shall be delivered from the
[18:12] bondage of corruption
[18:15] that's what we're doing this is
[18:16] corruption we're fighting right now
[18:18] corruption of the body exactly we're not
[18:20] fighting corruption of the soul if
[18:21] you're born again
[18:23] we're fighting corruption in our spirit
[18:25] realm
[18:26] which is going to change our body
[18:28] automatically
[18:30] automatically it's an automatic chain
[18:33] because the creature itself also shall
[18:34] be delivered
[18:36] from the bondage of corruption now what
[18:38] is the bondage of corruption death
[18:40] into the glorious liberty of the
[18:42] children of god
[18:44] for we know
[18:46] paul knows paul is telling us we know
[18:50] that the whole creation groaneth and
[18:53] travails look at the hurricanes look at
[18:55] the tsunamis look this whole earth this
[18:57] whole earth look at um
[18:59] hawaii lord bless your heart
[19:02] and my humanity i go out for him but you
[19:04] know what this is what it's gotta be
[19:06] judgment's been called and that's the
[19:07] way it's gonna be
[19:10] they want him had much and then the
[19:12] philippines you see but that's the whole
[19:14] creation group god don't have anything
[19:15] to do with that that's right that's
[19:17] right right but you know what he does he
[19:19] does ward off
[19:20] for the people that are here that's
[19:21] right
[19:22] but there's got to be somebody i mean he
[19:24] without us he just wiped the whole earth
[19:26] off
[19:29] so who's he waiting on us
[19:32] he's waiting on himself
[19:33] he's waiting on us
[19:36] look and not only wait oh for we know
[19:39] that the whole creation groaneth and
[19:41] travail it
[19:43] what is travail a woman when she has
[19:45] verses in travail
[19:47] right in pain together until now
[19:51] when you get up in the morning
[19:53] you know that's true
[19:54] there's more pain and more today
[19:57] then you've got a hard acting pain if
[19:59] you some of you younger ones don't have
[20:00] pains in your body yet you've got pains
[20:02] in your spirit around them
[20:04] right got kids
[20:07] you got kids
[20:08] yeah
[20:11] and not only they
[20:14] but ourselves also
[20:17] who's he talking about us
[20:19] the whole creation groaning thing
[20:21] prevails in pain together until now
[20:23] paul looks out and sees the tornadoes he
[20:25] sees the lightning he sees the wind he
[20:27] sees the earthquakes
[20:28] he sees all these things
[20:30] so the bible doesn't leave that alone
[20:32] remember it goes all over the
[20:33] revelations and over into different
[20:35] places says that this you know talks
[20:37] about earthquakes and divers places and
[20:40] and all these other things destroyed by
[20:42] water and all this stuff
[20:43] and not only they but ourselves now he's
[20:45] talking about human the people which
[20:48] have the first fruits of the spirit now
[20:49] what's the first fruits of the spirit
[20:55] the manifestation of the sons of god
[20:57] all right everybody got that yes
[20:59] right because he's got to keep it in
[21:00] continuity he's not talking about
[21:02] something way over there and i'm talking
[21:03] about what he's been doing remember paul
[21:06] when he's writing he keeps his stock
[21:09] of what's above that's right
[21:11] right and not only they but ourselves
[21:13] also which have the first fruits of the
[21:15] spirit
[21:16] remember we were talking about last
[21:17] night the sheaf wave that's the same
[21:20] thing
[21:21] listen that was christ being waved over
[21:23] the people
[21:25] but he was being waived over the people
[21:28] that was going to be the first fruits
[21:29] that was going to come
[21:31] all right okay
[21:33] excuse me so i have the dual meaning
[21:38] and see i can read that
[21:40] in a higher level
[21:43] that we are not only have the first
[21:44] fruits of the spirit in our soul
[21:47] you and i have been brought to a
[21:48] complete restoration by the prophet of
[21:50] god in the end time
[21:51] to bring the first fruits of the
[21:53] resurrection
[21:56] because paul didn't receive the first
[21:57] fruits of the resurrection
[22:00] sure he had an ant potential
[22:02] but he was but he couldn't come to a
[22:04] full resurrection a
[22:06] human resurrection let me put it that
[22:07] way because he did everybody's come to a
[22:10] resurrection out of but i'll read it
[22:12] this afternoon brother brown should have
[22:14] out of dead denominations out of
[22:15] darkness we've all been resurrected
[22:18] but this is talking about physical
[22:20] resurrection redemption of our body
[22:22] right and not only today but ourselves
[22:24] also which have the first fruits of the
[22:26] spirit
[22:27] even we ourselves grown within ourselves
[22:32] that's why you can take and go back to
[22:33] where that is where the
[22:35] the
[22:35] god with the ink horn goes through the
[22:37] nations in the old testament and marks
[22:40] the people that sigh and cry for the
[22:42] abomination that's done in the city now
[22:45] what wouldn't that be we've grown within
[22:47] ourselves
[22:48] i think sometimes we do get too
[22:50] satisfied with where we live and what we
[22:52] do
[22:53] and our humanity and
[22:55] and uh
[22:56] we take appeal and it makes us feel good
[22:58] please that's just temporary that's
[23:00] right
[23:01] that's just temporary that pill will
[23:03] will wear off
[23:05] but the gospel will never work
[23:08] amen
[23:10] but we have the first fruits of the
[23:11] spirit even we with ourselves grown
[23:13] within ourselves waiting now look
[23:16] here's a point i want to make man
[23:17] i'm doing good today i hope that's right
[23:19] that right
[23:30] but watch this right here waiting
[23:33] we ourselves grow within ourselves
[23:36] paul is saying at this point in time
[23:39] he's waiting
[23:42] now if i may interpolate and put a
[23:45] parenthesis not adding to the word
[23:49] waiting on the last
[23:51] church age
[23:54] yeah
[23:57] because he's not waiting on arenas and
[23:58] martin they're all gone
[24:01] uh we're not waiting on william brown
[24:02] the
[24:10] so you see how you can the onion peel
[24:12] the scripture you can read that
[24:13] scripture we've been reading for years
[24:14] and years and years but one day we've
[24:15] got to read it at a different level we
[24:17] got to read it at a higher level amen
[24:20] telling us
[24:24] that was something i was
[24:25] thinking about the other day i was
[24:26] reading and
[24:28] there was a
[24:30] story in it it started with and even the
[24:32] little our little readers who said you
[24:33] know
[24:35] jane and whatever the boy's name was
[24:41] jane dick and james
[24:45] now if you take dick and jam in spot
[24:48] okay and then you continue with the with
[24:50] the book
[24:52] and you see dick and jane and spot and
[24:54] then you see a baby
[24:56] well now it don't have to spell out what
[24:58] happened in between those
[25:00] years of them growing up
[25:03] and getting together and marrying and
[25:04] having a baby now
[25:07] but there is something that went on in
[25:09] between all that
[25:11] and that's the same thing here
[25:13] there's something going on in between
[25:14] the story the love letter that's right
[25:17] that's been brought to us by the prophet
[25:20] so there's a love letter part in there
[25:22] that we see
[25:24] because right here from from right here
[25:26] when paul wrote this which was almost 2
[25:29] 000 years ago let's just stay close to
[25:31] it
[25:32] say you wrote it in
[25:35] well if i had my bible i'd tell you
[25:36] something
[25:37] he wrote it in say 50 a.d well in
[25:41] and this is what the year
[25:43] 2018
[25:45] it's almost been 2 000 years
[25:48] he wrote this we've grown within
[25:50] ourselves
[25:52] waiting
[25:53] for the adoption so you know what
[25:55] there's a whole sixth dimension
[25:57] right here
[25:58] waiting
[26:00] for the adoption
[26:02] to with the redemption of our body
[26:05] now nobody dead
[26:07] or nobody that's passed on can fulfill
[26:09] that
[26:11] you don't adopt
[26:14] you know you hate say it you just don't
[26:16] adopt deadly
[26:17] you're not the children of god
[26:20] now they're going to come under
[26:23] right they're going to come under what
[26:24] we're doing
[26:26] but somebody's got to come to authority
[26:28] to this right here the redemption
[26:31] of our body
[26:35] and you look at this right here and
[26:38] we'll stop we'll cut it off but i don't
[26:39] want to go any further
[26:41] we'll get to another thought watch him
[26:44] watch him get to his thought right here
[26:46] he stops
[26:47] because look he says likewise the spirit
[26:49] also helped with their infirmities he's
[26:50] dropped all the way down here to our
[26:52] everyday living
[26:54] but i want to stay up here
[26:56] for we are saved by hope it's no longer
[26:58] saved by faith no you're saved by hope
[27:02] that's right but hope that is seen it's
[27:06] not hope can you see union birth no
[27:09] just like mary mary
[27:12] hoped she was pregnant she but she
[27:14] believed she was
[27:16] but she had to wait 28 days later
[27:19] to go
[27:21] i got
[27:23] the angel was right i got what i you
[27:25] know because in your mind you you listen
[27:28] in her humanity she didn't we always say
[27:30] be it under me according to that word
[27:31] and she just never had a problem after
[27:33] that no
[27:34] she pondered that thing for 28 days
[27:38] because she's a human
[27:41] she pondered it she wondered but
[27:43] something held like abraham same thing
[27:46] something held abraham abraham said
[27:52] he had to hold he had to have faith he
[27:54] thought but he's like
[27:56] i'm dying i can't i can't do anything
[27:58] you know i cried i messed up abraham
[28:01] said in his humanity
[28:04] but god saw that there was a street
[28:05] there that he was not going to waver
[28:07] from that
[28:08] same way with
[28:10] mary that's why he came to america there
[28:12] was a there was a part of mary that just
[28:13] said being under me according to that
[28:15] word and she went on sure she pondered
[28:17] things in her heart because the bible
[28:18] says she pondered things in her heart
[28:21] for we are saved by hope
[28:23] but hope that is seen is not hope
[28:27] i hope we're going to go upstairs and
[28:29] listen to brother dale preach today now
[28:31] i can say that because i'm in my
[28:33] humanity
[28:34] and something
[28:36] may happen before i get up there but if
[28:37] i get up and sit down and see and he
[28:39] begins to speak it's not hope anymore
[28:44] you don't need faith for something you
[28:45] see that's right
[28:47] you have you have faith with something
[28:49] you can't see exactly
[28:52] when i got i got faith that
[28:54] that
[28:56] that my kids are coming back
[28:58] yes
[28:59] it's part hope
[29:01] but when they come here and and
[29:03] materialize
[29:04] in the vision or we step out of the
[29:06] vision into reality
[29:08] you don't have to have faith for them to
[29:10] be here anymore
[29:14] because remember we live we live by
[29:16] faith not by sight but once we get to
[29:18] sight
[29:20] in our journey
[29:22] when we get to sight where we can see
[29:24] what's going on but we can see
[29:27] what's happening we can see that the
[29:29] spirit growing within ourselves that we
[29:31] waited for the adoption to with the
[29:32] redemption our body and we know now that
[29:34] that can happen
[29:37] sure we were well you know i hope no i'm
[29:40] having faith
[29:41] but it's a hope until you see it but
[29:43] once you see it it's not hope
[29:46] for what a man saith
[29:49] why does he hope for it
[29:53] why why do you hope for something you
[29:54] are saying
[29:56] i hope i made it to church today
[30:00] that might have been an hour ago
[30:03] but right now i'm in the reality of it
[30:08] because we'll get into a little
[30:09] something that that brother dale
[30:10] preached years ago and that's what's
[30:12] kind of bringing in before bless you
[30:14] what we're looking for
[30:17] excuse me
[30:19] excuse me again sorry is that
[30:22] even jesus stood on the mountain and
[30:24] that's what kind of sparkman last
[30:25] weekend jesus said tell the vision
[30:28] to no man until the son of man be risen
[30:30] again
[30:32] this thing a vision
[30:36] this is reality
[30:39] we stepped out of that vision
[30:41] when i preached over in jamaica several
[30:43] years ago a long time ago probably 10 or
[30:44] 12 years ago
[30:46] i preached on the vision that brother
[30:47] brown had in jamaica
[30:49] of the people running up and down the
[30:50] mountains and all that you know
[30:52] well i told them i said look that was
[30:53] the vision brother brown was looking
[30:56] all who prophesied must die but they'll
[30:58] preach that sermon a long time ago even
[31:00] jesus even brother brown because the
[31:02] prophecy is for somebody else it's not
[31:04] for them
[31:06] it's for somebody else
[31:07] brother brown i'm prophesied of a group
[31:09] of people to come
[31:12] it's not for you that's what he's saying
[31:14] in other words you're seeing the vision
[31:16] you're in you're seeing the vision
[31:18] in other words the seals are opening
[31:20] you're seeing the vision but you're not
[31:22] in the reality of it
[31:24] there'll be a real group of people here
[31:26] same way we're here there'll be a
[31:27] there's a real group of people it's
[31:29] going to take a redemption of the body
[31:31] but they keep they prophesied
[31:33] the ones that prophesy even jesus jesus
[31:36] prophesied he ever died
[31:38] when we come to where we fulfill all
[31:40] that prophecy we're living reality we're
[31:42] not prophecy that's right
[31:44] okay
[31:45] same way when jesus said television
[31:47] don't understand man be risen again well
[31:48] that's not a vision anymore
[31:50] it was a vision to peter james and john
[31:53] but that's not a vision anymore
[31:56] it's a reality this is now the reality
[31:59] of what happened on that mountain
[32:02] jesus come to adoption
[32:05] moses and elijah was standing there
[32:07] getting ready to go to israel in the
[32:09] type
[32:10] but what did brother brown say they were
[32:11] talking to jesus about
[32:15] don't remember that
[32:16] his second coming
[32:19] now when is the second coming
[32:22] it's in the bride right now
[32:24] not then
[32:25] so it's not a vision anymore that's
[32:26] right it's come to a reality so when we
[32:28] see that we're in the reality of it
[32:31] it's good to look back sure
[32:33] but all that's what i was thinking about
[32:35] when i was reading all those prophets
[32:36] man they were prophesying
[32:38] prophesy thus saith the lord prophesied
[32:40] this prophet what it wasn't for nobody
[32:42] that was there it was for people that
[32:44] wasn't to come
[32:46] that's what paul's doing he said for we
[32:48] are saved by hope the hope is sin hope
[32:50] that the scene is not hope for what a
[32:52] man seeth why does he yet hope for it
[32:54] what do you hope for if you already got
[32:55] it but if we hope for that we see not
[33:00] then do we with patience
[33:03] wait for it
[33:04] amen
[33:05] waiting on the manifestation of the sons
[33:07] of god
[33:08] to come to what come into the body of
[33:11] christ then come to the manifestation
[33:13] and then come to the redemption or to
[33:14] understand
[33:16] the redemption of our body
[33:18] now there's no way you can understand
[33:19] that redemption of the body
[33:21] without the steel breaking breaker
[33:24] no way
[33:26] because brother branham did do a work of
[33:29] restoration
[33:31] but that work of restoration was not
[33:33] hair and dress right and coming to
[33:35] church
[33:36] and doing good and being good and even
[33:38] receiving the holy ghost
[33:40] that was all before
[33:42] the work that brother branham did was i
[33:44] will restore
[33:46] those four things now the only time he
[33:48] brought those four things in was during
[33:50] the seals
[33:52] the linox man and eagle and the king's
[33:54] wormhole sure it started eating way back
[33:56] there but this is the manifestation of
[33:58] it this is that was the vision of the
[34:01] prophecy i will restore
[34:04] saith the lord all right
[34:07] because remember even
[34:08] even um
[34:10] peter stood up on the day of pentecost
[34:11] and said this is that
[34:13] which was spoken by the prophet joel
[34:16] well that was after jesus was dead
[34:19] risen went to glory come back into the
[34:21] people now peter's saying this is that
[34:26] this is that this is that this 120-3
[34:29] this is that that was spoken by joel of
[34:31] the restoration not of just israel but
[34:34] the restoration of all things because
[34:36] remember we read it we'll read it this
[34:37] afternoon matthew and matthew
[34:40] jesus said elijah must come and restore
[34:43] all things
[34:46] that's why the jews now listen that's
[34:48] why i told you many times you know i've
[34:49] told you before
[34:50] the jews are looking for elijah they
[34:52] know elijah's got to come back before
[34:54] christ comes exactly
[34:56] they just miss the third coming
[34:58] and the fourth coming but some of them
[35:00] will get the fifth coming right right
[35:03] but that's what we're looking at here
[35:05] this is not a prophecy anymore then this
[35:07] is the reality we have become sons of
[35:09] god by the new birth we are coming to
[35:12] the manifestation of the sons of god see
[35:14] that even even the manifest
[35:17] manifestation the sons of god happened
[35:18] in the
[35:19] in the uh
[35:21] peter paul james and john
[35:24] they were at the faith of the fathers
[35:25] they were right here
[35:28] now remember brother brown had to come
[35:29] over because all this got wiped off he
[35:30] had to come back and and do a work of
[35:32] restoration but it's what gets kind of
[35:35] it kind of gets a little
[35:37] convoluted
[35:39] can't see it very good if you just don't
[35:40] pay attention but pay attention but luke
[35:42] or leslie were reformation
[35:45] inside of restoration
[35:47] is reformation
[35:50] because remember restoration is not
[35:53] believing that father son holy ghost is
[35:55] three gods
[35:57] full restoration is not believing
[36:01] baptism in the name of father son holy
[36:03] ghost that's not restoration so martin
[36:04] luther kept that
[36:06] caused him to be a reformer right
[36:10] he didn't restore the catholic church
[36:13] he reformed the people out of the
[36:15] catholic church
[36:17] john wesley reformed them into a method
[36:20] called methodist the method of worship
[36:23] right amen
[36:25] but in this is all restoration
[36:28] so you but inside of that come
[36:30] reformation
[36:31] so what brother brown did is when he
[36:33] come when that elijah come to restore
[36:35] all things he's the only one that's
[36:36] going to do that
[36:38] church age messenger born again believer
[36:40] manifested son of god
[36:42] right here in our own time
[36:44] we got all this sermon that's what he
[36:46] needs to do to restore all things is the
[36:48] body change
[36:50] that's full restoration to us
[36:52] now remember the world won't be fully
[36:54] restored until the future home
[36:55] but we've got to go first the whole
[36:57] creature is waiting on you and i
[37:00] for the creature itself shall be
[37:02] delivered
[37:03] from the bondage of corruption into the
[37:05] lord's liberty the children of god
[37:08] so we gotta
[37:10] we gotta let god work in the womb of our
[37:12] mind a little bit and and you know bring
[37:14] forth
[37:16] not the child of luther
[37:17] not the child of wesley not the child of
[37:19] pentecost
[37:21] which is fine and good that's part of
[37:23] reference even pentecost was reformation
[37:26] but it's restoration
[37:28] because what did the pentecostal do
[37:31] they spoke in tongues they had the holy
[37:33] ghost
[37:34] that's what they said tones they
[37:36] got the holy ghost you know and that's
[37:38] part of it yes
[37:40] you speak in tongues
[37:42] if you get the holy ghost of speaking
[37:44] tongues just correct but if you don't
[37:45] get the old ghost of speaking tongues
[37:46] the devil can do that's right
[37:51] so you take
[37:53] reformation you understand what i'm
[37:55] saying reformation
[37:56] is not
[37:58] it's part of restoration but it's not
[38:00] full restoration
[38:02] full restoration is back to where
[38:04] we come all the way to where there's
[38:08] well here's another one martin luther he
[38:10] took
[38:11] a purgatory or an eternal hell and he
[38:13] brought it right over in his doctrine
[38:15] that's not restoration he brought father
[38:18] son holy ghost baptism out into his
[38:21] doctrine his age god winked into
[38:23] ignorance because god only remember the
[38:25] box
[38:26] god give him a box
[38:28] that said the just shall live by faith
[38:31] and that's it
[38:33] but all that other stuff that he brought
[38:35] out listen was garbage
[38:37] yeah
[38:39] garbage
[38:41] but it was or let's just say baggage it
[38:43] was baggage that he brought so that's
[38:45] not restoration
[38:47] he reformed the people yes but god was
[38:50] doing a work of restoration because he
[38:52] had to start with the two shoots
[38:54] then the
[38:56] then the stalk
[38:57] then the tassel
[38:59] to get the grain you can't come from
[39:01] this to grain no you god has to work in
[39:05] in science
[39:07] or in continuity with what
[39:09] creation
[39:11] excuse me is everybody okay with that so
[39:14] so you see this afternoon you'll get a
[39:15] little extra there that luther was a
[39:17] reformer
[39:18] [Music]
[39:20] because he brought all that other stuff
[39:22] winning that's not restoration right
[39:25] but it's a part of restoration
[39:27] because that's why you hear brother
[39:28] brown say two different times it was it
[39:30] was starting another reformation it was
[39:32] starting a restoration
[39:34] i will restore
[39:36] the years that the all the palm worm and
[39:37] all that eat what they eat it down all
[39:39] here
[39:40] and then god started restoring
[39:42] through reformation
[39:44] he winked at the ignorance
[39:46] of the people
[39:48] evil john wesley now remember john
[39:49] wesley didn't say well now luther was
[39:51] totally wrong
[39:53] now you're going to believe me
[39:55] no he he what he stepped up on luther's
[39:58] he still kept the judge y'all lived by
[39:59] faith
[40:01] but then he added yes now we gotta live
[40:04] with sanctified life
[40:06] we can't have none of that beard
[40:07] drinking and smoking a pie right listen
[40:10] luther was a german they drink beer like
[40:11] we drink water right all right but look
[40:14] at that's what i said before look at the
[40:16] witness that he gave
[40:18] luther could sit there and drink a beer
[40:19] and smoke talk about god and the people
[40:21] in the catholic church is going
[40:23] what is he doing
[40:24] he's just like us
[40:26] but he wasn't like them that's right
[40:28] there was a part of him that was born
[40:30] again that god winked in his ignorance
[40:32] and said i'm going to start with that
[40:34] but that's not it right
[40:37] because remember
[40:40] the protesting of protestant church
[40:42] that's where the protestant church came
[40:43] from
[40:44] he brought
[40:46] protestantism protesting the catholic
[40:48] church but now remember martin luther
[40:50] didn't protest everything
[40:52] right the catholic church had that's
[40:54] right because he took a lot of it that's
[40:56] what i said that so that's not
[40:57] restoration
[40:59] he restored the just shall live by faith
[41:01] no more penance no more dragging
[41:03] yourself down you know you can't doctor
[41:05] walk on nails you don't have to you know
[41:07] pay for novenia's you don't
[41:10] you just believe god and you live by
[41:12] that faith
[41:13] and that was it and god was please
[41:16] listen god was just pleased with martin
[41:17] luther as he is with us because if he
[41:19] hasn't started that way with martin
[41:20] luther king but god does all right let's
[41:22] go
[41:23] [Music]
[41:26] uh did church pray for my brother before
[41:28] his cancer
[41:29] he got the release last night i beat
[41:31] last week this
[41:40] man that's great
[41:55] because they're reforming people
[41:58] he just reported those people that he
[42:00] said
[42:13] go back a little bit
[42:31] anything you do really
