loved the Lord tonight amen are you in love with God but he's in love with you he's madly in love with you amen we I appreciate him amen because we love him because he first loved us and certainly thank God a man think brother Dale for the the trust that you have a man in US a man is being here to be able to bring something to you a man because I believe that you came here to listen to the Word of God amen no I didn't come here to listen to me amen maybe listen to God speaking through me amen but not not not listen to my ideas I mean I don't want to present my ideas I want to present his idea a man his ideas his word praise the Lord Jesus amen so if you have your scriptures tonight I want to go to Philippians chapter 4 phillipians chapter 4 start at verse 1 Philippines 4 verse 1 if you have a say hey man praise God Bible says here in verse 1 it says therefore my brethren dearly beloved and longed for my joy and Crown you notice that Paul here he's speaking to brethren amen obviously you know the majority of the pistils that he's talking to his believers amen therefore my brethren dearly beloved and long for my joy and Crown so stand fast in the Lord my dearly beloved I beseech yo Dias and beseech cinta ki that they be of the same mind in the Lord and I entreat the also true yoke fellow help those women which labored with me in the gospel with Clement also and with other my fellow laborers whose names are in the book of life rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice isn't there a little song like that amen kids sing let your moderation be known unto all man the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things man those things which ye have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the God of peace shall be with you it's so interesting amen okay Paul was so convinced that he was walking in the ways of God that God was dwelling him that he would tell people something like this which those things which he have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do can you tell the people that today what a question to ask my goodness because this is not the only scripture where he tells somebody that he also says be followers of me as I follow Christ again is what a confidence he had in the Lord amen praise the Lord and the God of peace shall be with you amen so tonight I want to just give it a little topic a man I want to just title this the peace of God that passes all understanding okay yeah and let's just go to the Lord in prayer our Heavenly Father we thank you Lord for the opportunity that we have to read your word Lord Jesus father God sometimes we just kind of read these these passages Lord and we just read them fast Lord and we don't realize Lord God the diamonds Lord that are in there father the the the the gems Lord God Almighty that you've placed in the word father God and Lord we just want to take father God this portion tonight Lord and just ask the Lord that you would just help us to see father God something that would help us father in our spiritual walk with you Lord we're scaling father God this statue of a perfect man and Lord Jesus we have to face things here in this life Lord God for the perfection father god of this of coming to this perfection of our bodies Lord Jesus and so father God it's inevitable Lord Jesus but we ask you Heavenly Father that you would just help us Lord and that you would just help us father God to take these things father God and and just and just meditate on them Lord so that Heavenly Father we you could get the glory and honor father bless the people maybe those that might be on their way watch over them keep them safe Lord and ask that you just meet every need amongst us we love you we commit ourselves into you father I commit myself to you Lord you just father God take control Lord because father God I'm nothing without you Lord but you're you're my sufficiency father we pray these things in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen god bless you you may be seated Saints praise the Lord Amen so so appreciate your thanks that I was looking at I was looking at Zak Sunday I think was Sunday and there's certain views that you look at him he looks just like Bob right so there that's how you're gonna look like that feel sorry for you [Laughter] anyways we appreciate the Lord and and thank God for for allowing us to be here another day man just keep brother brother wait in prayer as he travels and that the Lord would just you know he redeemed the time that he's there right man and that would uh you know be an effect to what the purpose of him being there you know and there's a lot of work to be done in so many places I think one of the things that needs to be done a lot is uh a lot of teaching needs to be done and and so pray for him that that he would just deal directly with the ministers pastors there I mean they could take those things they meant to their people like man praise God Amen you love the Lord tonight amen um you know thanks I I've just been you know I've just been been been struggling in the little in the last several days and I was I was going a certain direction and and I just saying Lord you know where should i where should I go and what what should i what should I do and I was going a certain direction making notes a certain direction and then this morning brother Joe and me we were at a meeting this morning and and right there at that meeting and it's just unusual how God does things right there at that meeting where our boss was talking and people were talking God just totally changed the whole thing for you and I was praying for that and I was saying Lord III you know the needs of the people you know the needs of the church you know my needs amen and I only want to say Amen what you want the people to no way men and and and and so the struggling that I was making week uh that I was having all week a man with the notes that I was creating God just gave me this and let me man just put it all together all in just a few hours and I just appreciate the Lord amen and so appreciate your prayers so I just ask that you just pray for me man and I hope something said tonight that will help you amen cuz it certainly helped me praise God amen because uh you know this year I don't know about you but this year it started for us it started with a bang you know this this everything seems like whatever whatever is gonna go wrong is gonna go wrong you know we come back from Honduras and and and and and Satan's rubbing rubbing up Murphy you know they say Murphy's Law you know he's all over your cars and he's all check engine lights coming on and in the house is leaking and then everything whatever's gonna go wrong is gonna go wrong you know and there's just everything's just throwing it at you I don't know if you feel that way or not you know it's been a it's been like that for me I guess I'm the lucky one if you defeat oh if you're nothing I'm the lucky one just have all these things happen but but but you know God a man he's he's in control he's still on the throne you know and and and he hasn't forgotten and you know he knows exactly what you have need of a meant to to make you what you ought to be praise God amen and in John 14:27 he says he said to us he said peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth a men but as I give to you you know and and and everyone is after peace the whole world is seeking peace and in the news you talk about in the news you hear about them calling for peace and cease fires and all these different things amen when in reality the peace that they're looking for is a temporary that they want a long lasting peace but means that they're going by with it it's only gonna lead to temporary peace there's no peace outside of the world there's no peace outside of God amen there's no peace outside of the Lord Jesus Christ amen because if you want to have real peace that is eternal peace when it's done through the Lord Jesus Christ a man we all want peace we all seek peace we all want to get along with one another a man but the world that this peace that because even Jesus says here peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you he said he says peace I leave with you peace I leave with you he's talking to his disciples I leave with you but look what he says my peace my peace I give unto you he's given us his peace amen when you've accepted his word amen when you've accepted him and his life he's given you his peace praise God not as the world giveth give I unto you amen praise God you know whatever kind of reminds me of it about he's not an Indian giver it doesn't give you something and then he takes it away hey man if the peace of God if peace Falls awhile falls off in your life it's your fault amen it's not God's fault amen it's your fault praise glory you know the one time there was a story you know we all have to battle with worrying and and turmoil you know in our lives constantly there was one time I heard I was reading this story one time that there was a death was coming through the town he was coming to a city and he was gonna kill a hundred people there was a man that went up to death and so I saw death and said death what are you doing he said I'm gonna go and take 100 people and the man said that's terrible the 100 that's how it is that's how it's supposed to be that's what I'm here to do that's how I do things I'm taking 100 people so the man you know he frantically he runs into into the city and start selling people and and and it's trust the warmth and so that evening he comes and yes he yes he has death did you take one huh he said he yes death actually took one thousand people so the man asked him and he said he said you said you were gonna take one hundred people why is it that one thousand are dead and he said I did fulfill my word death said I fulfilled my word I took one hundred people but where he took the rest worrying took the rest of the people you see it says when we get those when we get the news amen and in in bad news it comes into into your life and something not everything's not going right is worrying a man it might not be it might not be something uh it might be something small but to you it's something big and it's only big a man because it's how we make the things big amen it might be something that is insignificant to somebody else but to you it's something real amen but God amen it doesn't matter what it is it could be big it can be small God has given us a way Amen for for the peace that passes all understanding praise the Lord Jesus amen so Saints uh you know like I said this we got back from Honduras this this year and and Satan was right there on that on that uh what is that what is that part that they changed on my on my car the uh I forgot what it was now anyways he was right there just rubbing on that thing sitting on top of that that throttle body there you go just sitting on that throttle body just probably stumping it and dancing and everything you know and I know that he was probably stumping and sitting and staying on the under second floor upstairs but we got the leak up there now and he's there you know and yeah you know and with it with everything else gonna start doing our taxes and come to find out we owe so much money it's not even funny but you know what Saints there is no burden amen that God kit there's nothing that God that comes into your life that God doesn't allow amen that God doesn't it up because he knows that you can you can handle it amen he knows that you can head there's nothing that happens in your life just to happen oh my goodness what am I gonna do but God is in full control they meant God knows exactly what you need to make him more like him for you to keep growing in that they may be good Saints we say we all want it so easy we all wanted so so so soft and and so I wish crisis the Christian life was like that but you know it isn't amen you know it isn't and you know I'm just gonna be honest with you Saints well when we got back when we got back from Honduras the thought came to my mind you know thank you lord there's there's some money in the bank and thank you Lord that you know for you know the cars the cars are run have been running great Anke Lord you know that we had a prosperous trip in Honduras Nicaragua the people got the word thank you Lord and you know thank you Lord and it's coming almost like you start getting cocky and you better be careful because when you start feeling that way you know when you start feeling comfortable about things that's when God starts man I love okay you're not you're getting too comfortable you're getting too comfortable and that's when he allows Satan go ahead take care of that car go ahead and rub rub that pitchfork all over that all over that check engine light thing you know and and it's never failed to happen that way it always does and whenever you have that thought in your mind thank you Lord about a week later you Oh God I really thank you that's the time when you really need to thank you amen so that's how it's been but I you know I don't know I guess maybe this hasn't I'm the lucky one this year maybe it hasn't been like that with you but you pray for us amen praise God so st. the thing is is that Satan is not after your possessions he's not after he was not after my car he's not after your car he's not after your house you know Satan doesn't Drive so why is he gonna worry about your car amen but while he's really worried about he's what he's really after he's after that piece he's after your piece and the peace of God he's after a mint because let me tell you saints if he could take the peace of God away from you and you're not settled in your heart with God the way you need to be then that's going to lead amen to you for you to get anxious for you to get fearful for you to get worried and for you to and and and because you're you're allowing all that to start taking place in your life and you're going away further away from the Word of God the Word of God and no and and then finally the Word of God has no more effect on you and then you're backslidden because that's the whole plan that Satan wants you do it and it all started with a throttle body it all started with a leaking your and your roof it all started because you owe the IRS money he's not after those things those are just symptoms he's after that peace amen praise the Lord and so you know he's up to me he's I call Satan II you know he's like a spiritual terrorist you know what a terrorist is right yeah the terrorist is a person who uses unlawful violence and intimidation especially against civilians in the pursuit of political aims yeah you see but saying is not after political aims obviously he the political world he's got it under control see but he's not after that any man who used whatever means whatever terrorist activity amen to try to take the whole the the bigger picture away because when a terrorist strikes Saints you got to remember this when the terrorist attacks and if you can seem terrorists in the news and stuff like that and he's caused damage and he's killed a lot of people he wasn't really to try to to make to do all that hurt to the people that died in that in that incident you know let's say terrorists attacked the bus he wasn't trying to kill the the people in the bus I mean obviously but what he really wants is the people that he didn't kill well he really wants are the ones that view that viewed that to try to bring that fear on the ones that weren't in there you see what I'm saying because what that what that does to you he's like home he's trying to say my you could be next you could be next and so what he's doing he's trying to plant that say he wasn't after the people in the bus that was just that was just a symptom in order for him to get the whole overall picture amen he's after you he's after your peace amen and then and he'll threaten you and he'll send all kinds of threats to you amen to try to rob you from your peace but you have to recognize saints that he's a bluff everything every time he opens his mouth he's nothing but a bluff he's just bluffing he can't do nothing yeah you know he can't do anything with you before you came to when you came to the Lord Jesus because you put all your sins under the blood a man the word convinced you a man and he can't do nothing with you so now what he's gonna try to do he's gonna try to rob you from from from the peace of God tried to rob you from your future a man with a future with God praise the Lord so that's what Satan tries to do he's that's what it is a spiritual terrorist try to rob you from your piece you know Saints when 9/11 took place you know it wasn't really as damaging and nsns chaotic in US and as sad as this as that as that was but it was really the after-effects that took place after that everybody was running fearful everybody was running and that's what the enemy wanted that's what the enemy wanted for you to run around with fear in your life when Jesus said for you not to fear amen praise the Lord Jesus so you know and Satan the more public the attack is the more terrifying it is when Satan strikes the more terrifying it is amen you've never seen a terrorist he doesn't strike private places he wants the work that he's doing he wants it to be known because he's got an agenda amen oh my and your wine and your walking in your life and you might see a certain sister or a certain brother they're going through something in their life hey men there might be going through a sickness they might have cancer or something taking place in their life and then he wants you to look at that and say oh my goodness the brother and sister didn't do this this this and that I better start doing that I better stole mine look what's happening in their life man what God wants you to do is be sitting there praying for that brother in that sister amen be praying they're not favorite secondly Satan's attacking her brothers but what you do it uh-oh I don't want that I don't want that is that fear that that he tries to put on you because a certain brother or a certain sister is going through something in their life amen spiritual terrorism amen and Paul said that we are troubled on every side but yet not distress amen we are perplexed but not in despair and that you're gonna have problems in your life that's inevitable on every side Paul said you look here there's problems you look here there's issues you look over here there you look behind you you look up there's problems amen but he doesn't want you to be perplexed about those issues amen trouble on every side yet not distressed we are perplexed but not in despair persecuted Satan's spiritual terror is a tax a man all over they used bombs and everything persecuted but not forsaken cast down but not destroyed you might be knocked down every now and then but you're not destroyed oh my Satan Satan could knock you down but it's what happens when you're down they man that that really decides if you're gonna keep walking with God or not are you gonna stay on that down there no a true soldier gets up and keeps balking they men are true soldier gets up and keeps going ain't man because he hasn't been defeated it's just one battle Lord with your help praise God always bearing about in the body the dying of the Lord Jesus that that the life also of Jesus might be made manifest in our body Saints you know Saints whenever we're walking in this Christian life that's what that's what it's all about we're always have to be bearing the death of Jesus Christ in our life you know that Jesus Christ talked about more about us taking up our cross than him that he talked about his cross he talked more about him taking up about you taking up your cross and that's what Christian life is all about you take in your cross amen not just one day not just two days not duck duck tomorrow I'm gonna leave it at home because feel like taking my cross today I'll pick it up again when Friday Friday comes around well you know I didn't I didn't take it Friday Thursday so it's okay I won't take it Friday you yeah you know Saturday comes around and you wrap still picking up your cross you know what happens things when you're picking up your cross that cross isn't light it's a heavy cross oh it's so easy to just do the things of the world and to live you know relaxing life and you know I you know that's so easy you know a Christian life is so easy it's hard when you have to resist temptation it's hard amen when you have to say listen I want to watch this movie but I know that prayer is gonna do a better thing for me I want to do this that's gonna just gonna feed the flesh but I know that if I do this other thing I know it's gonna help me grow in Christ amen that that's I guess you don't have Netflix I guess you don't watch YouTube you pray for me then you see we have all these things that try to take our our time and if we let them they will they will that's what they're there for to rob you from their time that you're supposed to have with God been there I've done that got the t-shirt the Hat the mousepad to prove it been there done that and you realize st. as regret is you're getting older you realize none of these things around you are helping you draw closer to God you know Saints brother brother brother Dale he preached a wonderful message Sunday morning brother Wade you know on top of what he brother Dale brought out in the morning and we're still worried about this dentist temporal things of this life brother Dale talking about 1977 brother Wade was talking about about the Jubilee and and all those things and remember that things could take place this year this very year and we're still wondering what's good to watch on Netflix what's good on YouTube what I what I can't wait for the for the sweet 16 the the n-c-double-a tournament you know you're worried about those things you know God help you you you need to repent you need the Lord if you're still if you're worried about those things knowing that the the coming of the Lord is soon at hand my goodness you need you need you need you need to experience with God you need to set your priorities in order you need to set your priorities amen everybody we just want to set it on cruise control amen in some way somehow things were just gonna get worked out at the end that's not how it works you need God in your life now amen you need Christ in your life in your heart now you need to serve Him amen praise God cuz others are watching you others are watching you and the life that you portray a man before others those that have children and the life that I portray before my children the way I go is the way by the way my children are gonna go if you're lazy and if you don't come to the house of God and you don't and you don't meditate on the word and you any besides the word don't don't get upset when your children go that direction don't get upset you're the one that did it you're the one that caused it so Paul here's is saying amen live peaceably with all men and Philippians chapter 4 verse 2 it says I beseech you Dias and beseech cinta k that they be of the same mind in the Lord now here Paul he's talking about before he starts talking about the peace of God he's already talking about Amen he asks you you Diaz in cinta ki to be at peace with one another or in one Accord Amen you hold how wonderful it is for brethren to dwell together in unity they meant it's marvelous it's wonderful praise God and you know what happened in the upper room God came down on the scene Amen when they were all in one Accord Amen not one one here one trying to go this way one trying to pull this way one Amen they were all they had all things in common the Bible says amen in Romans chapter 12 verse 18 it says if it be possible as much as lieth in you live peaceably with all man but if you don't have the peace of God in you then you're not gonna be able to live peace with all man if the peace of God is not dwelling in you because remember Jesus said my peace I give to you it's his peace amen he is peace he has true peace and if that peace is not raining in you if it doesn't dwell in you amen you're not gonna be able to live peaceably with all man you're gonna struggle you'll struggle raise god I think let's continue reading here and in Philippians 4:4 rejoice in the Lord always rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice you see how you see how Paul right there he says it twice so rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice amen oh I owe the IRS five thousand dollars there's no way I can rejoice no that's the time for you to rejoice that's the time to show Satan Satan this is all for my good amen Satan God knows what he's doing and God knows that if I need to pay these five thousand dollars to the IRS it's because he's work he's doing still working on me he's not done with me God knows if I if I if his Satan was rubbing my throttle-body amen he knows that that was for my good hey man praise God you imagine what what job was saying what he was going through hey man I mean and he was a dedicated man of God he was dedicated not only that he was such a testimony probably to because of what the scripture tells us a testimony to his family a testimony to his children that he would even offer sacrifices amen in case they sinned for them if they're not doing it I'll do it so they can see I'm doing it so they can go do it amen and because he was so dedicated and then all of a sudden his children gone his house starts falling apart sickness starts coming on his body he comes he has to come to a point because remember Satan can't touch you unless he gets he gets permission from God he can't touch you unless God has given okay go ahead you could touch brother Boyd in this area in fact I didn't say what you could touch him in this hour God this is God speaking you can touch him in this area because I know he's gonna overcome he's gonna show you a thing or two say Amen praise the Lord but also in the process not only is he saying is showing Satan that he's wrong he's also showing you something that you didn't even know about yourself and about God you see sometimes Saints we think that the issues that we go through the problems and the trials that happen in our lives oh it's just for that issue no God is molding something in you God is trying to show each and every one of us something amen that we didn't know about ourselves and it's most certainly we didn't know about God praise God see God is so detailed like that he knows us better than you know yourself you think you got it all down you think you think you got 1977 all all laid out and and you got everything laid out and it's all just head knowledge to you if Christ is not dwelling in your life amen what is all that matter if you're not serving God if you don't go pray if you don't go meditate on the word I appreciate what the brother Dale brought out but did that help you go and seek the Lord Sunday night or did you go home and just sit down in front of the TV you know Saints we're living in a late hour it's a late hour did it make you gather your family and say children we need to draw closer to God children that hour is late we need to pray more we need to seek God more or did you just put another Netflix movie for the children to watch so you can watch with them yeah my Saints rejoice in the Lord always and again I say rejoice amen and that word that word rejoices says it says here in it says to rejoice be glad to rejoice exceedingly amen praise God God wants us to be rejoiceful I mean the things that we think that might be harming us in turn God is really trying to take us to a certain point in our life amen be careful for nothing Paul says in and verse 6 be careful for nothing now that word careful is not that you be careful you know be careful but in other words don't be anxious about anything right Amen now he says don't be anxious or worried about anything because sayings when you're worried about anything no matter what it is it could be little it could be big and you're worried to death about that thing amen you're putting that thing over the Word of God you're worrying amen your income you're in you're in direct disobedience to this verse right here yeah be careful for nothing in other words don't be anxious for nothing there's nothing so big and nothing so small that you have to be worried about praise God nothing that's why Paul said in another place there's not not death not height not not not you know the different things that he mentions nothing can separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus Amen be careful for nothing but look what Paul says here mm-hmm amen says be careful for nothing but in everything in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving amen prayer in everything by prayer the solution to being anxious and worried it is is praying that's the solution that Paul was trying to give us oh no it can't be that easy it can't be that that that's simple but we try to make we're the ones who make the Christian life difficult God is trying to give us here a remedy for our worrying and for our and for our our life living without peace amen and we know Saints that we all need to pray right I mean that's just the basic thing of a Christian life prayer but do we do it I'm talking about praying I'm not talking about two or three minute prayers I'm talking about praying amen maybe because sometimes it seems have to happen in our life bad things have to happen in our life in order to get down on our prayers to get down on our knees otherwise it's just sit on the lazy boy life is easy when you're up on the mountain amen but it's down in the valley amen when things get hard but you know Saints before you get into the battle you should already be pray it up amen then you wouldn't be panicking and you wouldn't be wearing and you wouldn't be fearful and you wouldn't be all these things amen if you were prayed up you would already know the solution to your problem that's the solution be anxious for nothing problem comes in huh thank you Lord hallelujah but in everything by prayer and supplication now you know what supplication means means to humbly amen come before the Lord amen to humbly say Lord I'm here supplication draws you to your knees supplication amen gets you down to a place where you know how the Bible says that David pray when he was when he was when he when he had sinned before the Lord it was down before he was down on the floor you know I'm not saying that you have to do that but I'm saying your heart shows they man whether you're when you're whether you're really humble before God or not amen you're coming before a king praise God in supplication hallelujah praise God first John 5:14 it says here it says and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he heareth us you see when you come to God you got to know this that he hears you amen and if we know verse 5 of 15 it says here and if we know that he hears us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petitions that we desired of him well the word already says it so why are you so worried are you so anxious you couldn't change the the situation right there and then you can't change it now let him take care of it put it in his hands amen he said that he said in this in confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything there's nothing too great for God according to his will he hears us hallelujah amen so that's so you we have prayer amen when Satan comes in with his spiritual terrorism amen we have prayer to go to use we have supplication to use and then the other thing that it said there what did it say there with Thanksgiving yeah you you add those three elements together you know when you add certain ingredients together when you're trying to make German chocolate cake there's got to be certain ingredients to be added together in order for there to really be a German chocolate cake amen if you only just add supplication you might not get the whole thing to hope the benefit of the whole the whole recipe you see if you just add Thanksgiving you see but amen if you add prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto God then right amen praise God amen so when the enemy starts attacking you a man just start counting your blessings say Lord thank you for that boss that you gave me at work and what gets on my nerves I thank you lord thank you Lord for that person that church that just him or her get on my nerves thank you Lord thank you Lord because I owe the RS $5,000 thank you Lord because you're you're allowed Satan to run around on my throttle body heat on my car yeah you think it's funny it it sounds silly but that's why he wants you to do it thankfulness but we don't we don't want to do that we don't thank him for the bad things that happen in our lives that sounds silly but that's what he's had to do be careful for nothing but in everything not in some things the throttle body is that one one of those things right the IRS is one of those things right amen but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God that's when you can go ahead and let your requests be made known to God amen because now you're entering into what he's asking you to do hallelujah I like I like that when Jesus a man he when he took the FOB was it the two fish in the five loaves it was something little there's not much but when he raised them and he thanked the Lord for that it multiplied into and fed everybody man right it can be a little thing in your life I just say Lord this is all you've given me I thank you Lord and you watch him multiply that in your life amen you watch him take care of that need in your life amen you watch him amen go in there and and do exactly what he promised he said that he'd do in his word whatever is that that you're going through just lift it up to God he'll take care of the rest that's what Jesus did with the little five loaves and the two fish thank you Lord and a miracle took place hallelujah amen now watch what verse 7 says after you've done after you've done prayer thanks we got to pray more we really do have to pray that's one thing that God is just just telling me this this year it's time to pray and no more no more of these five minute prayers at nights and and and no more of these 10 minute things and you say oh I've done my deed I've done my that's good enough oh you're gonna come to a certain point a man in your life that you know that what I wasn't good enough I mean again you're gonna have to be prayed up before the even those times come praise God verse 7 of the brothers could bring that up verse 7 it says and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus amen so I want you to understand Saints this piece a man this is not your piece that's not your piece that's the peace of God amen and remember he said that he is I he is our peace amen when you've done these things then the peace of God and you can go ahead and make your requests known amen you with in confidence that he's gonna answer whatever you have need of and the peace of God which passeth all understanding amen which passeth everything that you know of anything physical that you may have seen in this life or anything that's going on around you the logical things that are going around around you you might be sick you might be going through this issue you might be going through a problem I see a tumor on my leg but the peace of God that passes all understanding I see this problem in my life this financial issue in my life but the peace of God that passes all understanding I understand that that issue is there I understand that there is a problem I see it but those are all lying vanities and I will not believe one of them a man that passes all human reasoning all human understanding a man that's the peace of God Saints that's the peace that he wants you to walk with that he wants you to run with amen his peace that passeth all understanding Amen because that's not your peace Saints better remember the when the when the disciples were in the boat with with Jesus and you know the professional fishermen that were that the disciples were there what wouldn't you know in the boat and you know and they when you're a professional at something you know you're your professional you know you know what you're doing but they're here comes they come into this store into bow and all of a sudden this storm breaks out and the disciples are worried and scared to death because their professionalism couldn't do anything about that that storm was so severe that storm was so harsh that that the Bible says the waters were was coming into boat and they filled the boat about the Bible says and you know what the Bible says that Jesus was in the back of the boat with a pillow is that the Bible says that he had a pillow if you if you read the scripture with a pillow sleeping thermals all around them chaos all around them let me know if they were going to live or die but Jesus is in the back of the boat sleeping I don't know of any other a better example of the peace of God than that right there that's the peace of God right there that you could be gone no matter what's going on in your life and that doesn't make you losing you to sleep at night that doesn't make you lose any sleep amen suppose we catch it up catch up here at church but amen but that doesn't make you a man that's well that's when when you hear good meat when you hear bad news come into your life and you still have a good attitude about it that's the peace of God right there man that's the peace of God oh you know my son did this and in my mouth my daughter did this and they and my my wife this happened to my wife and and this is taking place and no oh and I went to the doctor and they said I had this and when you say well thank you lord thank you Lord because it's already done it's already done healing you've already taken care of that forgiveness you've already taken care of that amen financial issues Lord you said you'd already take care of that no matter what it is the peace of God if it dwells in you doesn't look at none of those things it looks at the word he looks at the promise Amen so that that scene right there Saints it's just one of the best scenes out I know of about the peace of God Jesus sleeping on a boat and then you know what he gets up and he says peace be still and he rebukes the disciples and says why are you so fearful I'm sure the disciples are thinking my goodness our boat is filled with water and I'm sure Jesus is walking all in that water too to get on top Shh peace be still all symptoms all around you but you'd still say peace be still you know why because the peace of God was audible drilling in him a man he is the peace praise God hallelujah amen and and in continuing here in verse 7 Amen it says and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus not that it wit may may keep you but at that it shall you shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus amen you know that the the issue that you may be going through your life in your life he meant you say I'm going crazy going through this I'm about to go crazy but a man if you just practice this a man go to God in prayer take it to God in prayer take it to him in supplication thank God for that situation thank him amen that sounds so weird and radical but just do it and you'll realize that he's gonna keep your heart and mind through Christ Jesus in other words he's keeping giving you the peace of God through his peace he is our peace amen and I like what it says here amen what that word keep means he said it means to keep with a garrison to guard protect by a military guard either to prevent hostile invasion or to keep the inhabitants of a besieged city from flight Amen so when God is dwelling in you Amen through the new birth amen you're that's a garrison right there amen God has taken complete abode amen and there's nothing that you have to be fearful about not only that his whole army is around you with angels and everything praise God he's taking a permanent military installation in you why fear why worry oh this is this took place this took place I don't know what to do but they're all certain that peace of God just cars amen it says this is the way to do it man this is the way to be praise God because Saints going back to this this the spiritual terrorism hmm sometimes Satan what he wants you to do it man because anxiety and fear and none of these things can work on their own they need to have private meetings with you in order for those things to work they need to put you in a corner somewhere in anxiety talking to you and and fear talking to you and complexes and all kinds of things talking to you and and say yeah you see that you see what and you said yeah yeah you're right you're right yeah and just conversating back and forth back and forth back and forth and finally you're in that position you can't even get out of that it's so engrained in your mind you can't even get out of it because there's no peace in your heart you have not let the peace of God work in your life because you don't pray you don't go to God in prayer you don't you don't meditate on his word you're just taking this thing in a rollercoaster ride I mean in a car in a on a cruise control ride amen if we just let amen Satan comes in with those things amen you have you have something to fighting him against yeah amen Tom that's what Jesus did I said all the way here he overcame his those temptations amen he just put the word back to Satan speak the word back to him oh but that's not him that's not important you know in this situation this situation needs more than that what situation those needs needs more than the Word of God there's nothing nothing that the Word of God cannot handle they men nothing that the Word of God cannot not not not solve for you amen praise God so when you've got that new birth in your life amen God is completely amen he's he's a permanent military installation there's nothing that Satan can do hallelujah mmm praise the Lord Saints remember that story about Elijah when he prays for his servants eyes to be opened yeah if you all know this that if you remember the story Elijah found out that the that I forgot the other the other kingdom the other the other people they had a secret place that they had found that they were gonna ambush the Israelite army at that at that spot and nobody knew anything about it except for those people for that army in the king and Elisha found out about it I believe God told him so he went to the he went to the to the king of Israel and the king and told the king of Israel that listen they got an ambush waiting for you do not go to this certain spot and so the king of Israel thanked Elisha and they didn't do it well word comes to the king of that of those people or not the people forget that city or that or that country escapes my mind right now they went to the day who is it is there a spy who is it that told Elijah where is the spot that we were going to to handle the Israelite army and you know the Israelite that army was pretty smart because they said well there's a man under there that God tells him all kinds of things he's not even into our Israel army but God talks with him and it was it was Elijah that told he'll I shall Dothan well instead of that King you know being impressed and they're like wow I want to meet that God no he says where is that city of Dothan let's go over there and we're gonna surround it we're gonna show you like sure thing or two hey spoiled our plan so they go the this army goes and and and with horses and and and soldiers and then they start surrounding the city and Elijah Elisha is there with his servant and the servant his servant all of a sudden starts panicking and says he likes a look at all these so all these soldiers surrounding our city look at all these chariots and all the things and you know what Elijah does he doesn't even look at the problem you know what he starts praying for you know most of us would be like look hard there's nothing about this Oh God you see all that army you see all that no that's not what he did he started praying for his servant he said he said Lord show him what I'm looking at right now so Elijah would not have been in that position if that piece of God was on are already there amen he knew that that that God was on the scene amen and then so he wanted his servant to know that God was on the scene amen and that's what God is trying wants us to know tonight Saints is that he's on the scene tonight amen you may not see it but God sees it you see it in his word and that's good enough you see it in his promises that's good enough he promised it in his word and you know he cannot lie and so Elijah he prays for his servant and he says-- has open his eyes that he may see what I'm looking at and God answers his prayer and all of a sudden he sees that there's more chariots more so more more angels and all kinds of being celestial beings watching over the whole over not just them the whole city of Dothan amen but Elijah was not looking at the problem at first then he goes ahead and addresses the problem after he prayed for his servant then he goes ahead just as the problem then he prays Lord now put blindness on the soldiers he he's he was worried more about the spiritual blindness of his of his servant than his than the physical blindness of the soldiers first he was see he was more worried about the spiritual things amen before the physical things amen that's a lesson for us we're so worried about the physical things of life what we're gonna eat what's Russia gonna do to us what's what's what's uh what we're gonna how we gonna pay this how are we gonna do this how are we gonna take our kids through school are we gonna you know there was a story one time with the lady avocado lady have you ever heard of that the avocado lady sat down under a travaux cadeau tree one time and she said you know what she was about 21 years old she started thinking she said you know when I get to about 25 there's a man that's probably gonna ask me to marry him and then we're gonna marry and we're gonna have about two or three children and then we're going to raise we need to find a good a good house for them to be able to raise them in and be near a good school and in their mine what am I gonna do when when it comes time what with what money am I gonna be able to pay for for their diapers and to buy the milk and to do all these things and when my husband goes to work all day long and I'm there at home with the children and all of a sudden an avocado follows from and hits around the head and kills her and all that worrying was for nothing right that's how it is the avocado lady wearing for nothing worrying about the most pit petty things ain't meant worrying about physical things yeah I reacted the same way when I first heard that story to worrying about physical things of life when God said I've already taken care of that and let's worry about the spiritual stuff first he likes to worried about his servant first open his eyes spiritually first so that then you could go ahead and do whatever you want to with the army amen praise the Lord amen the avocado lady how many of us aren't like the avocado lady sometimes no what's that what don't say that you've never been that way before because I have and then everything that you're so fearful about it doesn't even happen that with the way you thought all it is is just it's just fear it's just presumptions in your head and then Satan's there yes that's right that's it that's right that's what's gonna happen that's right and you're right they're just right but that's what he wants he wants to rob you from your peace so that he can keep you from serving God amen praise the Lord Jesus you love the Lord amen praise God so Saints when when the problems come amen know that God is keeping you when his peace is reigning within when bad news comes amen you don't react all of a sudden you wait and say Lord there's a reason why this is happening that's the peace of God amen John chapter 16 verse 33 it says these things Jesus speaking these things I have spoken unto you that in me you might have peace there's no P there's peace out there's no peace outside of this word Saints it's no peace outside of Christ there's no peace and Fox News there's no peace and in in in what the government can do for you there's no peace there's nobody brother Dale can't even do there's things that Rodell can't do for you amen brother wait I can't do anything for you amen Bible says buh cursed be the man or who trust in a man you see you can't have trust in no man much as we appreciate our pastor but you can't trust no man that's why we pray for brother Dale we keep him under prayer we keep the Saints the ministers everybody here on the prayer amen praise God trust no man the Bible says and I believe is Jeremiah that says that all these things that Satan has throwing all these spiritual bombs all from every angle coming at you from every angle Saints if you're here right now if you're still here amen it's because God has kept you right and you're here because he's not done with you you're here still because he's still you still have a work to finish amen for him amen how many times that you've been riding down the road and all of a sudden you know somebody just pulls out in front of you and you could have had the worst accident ever probably caused you to lose your life and the life of the other person but you know what God stopped that car don't think that just happened just to happen no God did that the Angels amen God's whole infantry was right there right man he took care of that situation amen when the times amen when when my wife when she's lost she's lost both of her parents and by cancer you know and those who've gone through that know what that's like but going through something like that one year after another and yet the peace of God reigns in her you know she came to a point where she had said Lord it's all in your hands and you know what we weren't worried about my mother-in-law amen but I believe at the end time I meant because of my test wife's testimony my wife stayed right there telling my dad about the Word of God teaching him about the Word of God as he was laying on his deathbed and he had so much trust in what she was telling him amen now I believe I believe that we're gonna see him again amen praise God but there has to be that she has pieced she had she had to have that piece in her in order to input and part that piece praise God you have to have peace in your heart in order to impart peace but if there's no peace in your heart you're constantly worried and sick and-and-and-and-and constantly in fear amen you can't impart peace to nobody because the peace of God is not dwelling in you these things I have spoken unto you that in me in me you might have peace how do you get in Christ amen obeying his word believing his word amen in the world ye shall have tribulation but be of good cheer I have overcome the world be of good cheer he didn't say be sad when that tribulation comes will you find out what Russia is doing be sad no he said be be of good cheer because the Word of God is coming to fulfillment amen you know this morning I heard I heard that I heard in the news that that Russia already has targets already in the United States and this is Fox News reporting already has images of targets already in the United States with certain types of missiles that they're that they're using right now in case in case the United States does something that they're displeased with and there's and there's points right now that that could happen Russia doesn't agree with everything that the United States is doing it was like a lot of countries don't you know look what's happening in Venezuela but what's happening in North Korea look at all these things but you know what the peace that passes all understanding that's what you understand that's what I understand but the peace of God that passes all understanding it doesn't matter what that's gonna do is just gonna make me grow closer good get closer to God amen draws closer to see the fulfillment of God's Word in this hard day because it's gonna fulfill that that last vision that brother Branham had yeah saw Americans smoldering ashes and we hear these things all the time amen praise the Lord look what brother Branham says here we're about to finish in the message 1957 the door of the door you see what a condition the church the Full Gospel Church has got into it's the lair to see an age to bring to pass the very word that our Blessed saviours spoke there in the Bible lukewarm danced by them danced by the music shout and clap hands oh them things are alright but if Christ isn't it isn't there when to hand clapping is over when the speaking with tongues are over when the healing service is over when the music stops at that deep settled peace then doors of faith standing wide open to let him be lord over the situation it doesn't do us any good to play the music or clap our hands or speak in tongues or have a healing service that's right as it doesn't it doesn't matter Saint you you're just going through the motions you're going through the motions if you don't know that you know that you know that that deep settled peace amen the way brother branham's here is about to look what he says here in the next one the seal of the Antichrist in 1955 don't let Satan deceive you the first thing you know you'll be marked outside the kingdom you can't come in my spirit will not always strive with men if you're not positive sure that a deep settled love for everybody deep settled peace that passes all understanding if that's not in your heart tonight if I was sitting in your seat I'd raise my hand to God and say God placing that that in my heart tonight for me I want to make a surrender I'm wanting I'm wanting to come now I really wanted I want to reconsecrate myself to you and make my make you make me what I ought to be you don't have that piece you know if you do or not you know if you have that piece you know when the peace of God comes in you it's gone it's gonna let you live this word it's not gonna draw you to the world it's gonna draw you more to God when you're around God amen what happens you become godly amen if you don't know that you have that settled peace in your heart sings there's the peace giver is here I believe hey man cuz he said where there would be two or three gathered in his name there I would be in the mist you don't know that you know if everything's if everything seems to just bother you and everything says Satan just keeps talking to you and and keeps terrorizing your life amen and you don't have that deep settled peace in your heart amen tonight is the night that you can leave with that deep settled peace you don't have to make this another Wednesday night service you can make something different amen out of this service amen it can be here it can be in your home it doesn't matter but get that settled peace in your life Saints get it because the hour is late for you to just be dilly-dallying with the things of God and say yeah this is good enough I go to church I do something at church I do you know it's good enough someway somehow at the end time it'll all get worked out no you'll be surprised maybe surprised how I mean and you know Saints it might be might be the last sermon you hear but you don't know if you're gonna leave these doors and you're gonna get home alive you have no idea amen but when you're in Christ whatever happens Lord I've got peace and I'm ready I'm ready Lord for whatever the world wants to bring me whatever Satan wants to bring me I'm ready because I've got that deep settled peace down in my heart amen you love the Lord - praise the Lord Jesus amen hmm amen
