Lord and uh just just just so glad everything went went well on Sunday and with the with the wedding um and I I I I just kind of want to make a comment about I I hope I hope everybody knows what a testimony and a witness you were that U we had a sister told my my wife I've I've never seen love expressed I'm I'm bad at quoting so I'm probably going to get the quote the statement all messed up but uh something to that effect I've never seen love expressed like the way that you know you could see she looked around and saw all the people from our church working and and stay laid and and helping out and all the all the things that had gone into it and you could see it it made an effect on them on on her and uh and there was there was a young man there too that uh he I just say I'm not going to say names or nothing but he's he's been struggling with seeing you know all the all the Hypocrites and stuff that around the message and I think um it really made an effect on him to see something genuine in the people of our church and uh he yeah so I I I pass out I'm throwing roses tonight we we sure to appreciate everything that that went into it and and uh it just I I can't I I just cannot express the appreciation and everything that that our family has to all of you so tonight I'm going to read from John chapter 20 and just take a little topic um might might be a short sermon I know I when I say that you know uh but uh uh just talk about Jesus The Gardener Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather around your word tonight Lord Jesus Lord each of us are coming with different needs tonight Lord God we know Lord there's just it seems like a constant stream of prayer requests and needs Lord Jesus but Lord we have a God that's here that can answer every need that can meet every need Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll move among us tonight Lord Lord as we open the doors of our heart Lord Jesus Lord to just give you free reign to do what you will Lord Jesus Lord to plant your word in our hearts Lord Jesus to make it live Lord we ask Lord that you'll just feel at Liberty tonight Lord God to make the words that are spoken becoming a living reality in our hearts Lord Jesus to address the situations in our lives Lord we just ask your blessing upon the word now as it's spoken in your name amen so John chapter 20 and uh and starting in verse one and going down to about verse 15 says the first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early when it was yet dark under the Seiler and seeth the stone taken away from the Seiler then she runneth and cometh to Simon Peter and to the other disciple whom Jesus loved and saith unto them they have taken away the Lord out of the Seiler and we know not where they have laid him Peter therefore went forth and that other disciple and came to the Seiler so they ran both together and the other disciple did outrun Peter and came first to the Seiler and he stooping down and looking in saw the linen clothes lying yet went he not in then cometh simth Peter following him and went into the Seer and seeth the linen clothes lie and the napkin that was about his head not lying with the linen clothes but wrapped together in a place by itself then went in also that other disciple which came first to The Seer and he saw and believed for as yet they knew not the scripture that he must Rise Again from the dead then the disciples went away again un their own home but Mary stood without at the seple Weeping and as she wept she stooped down and looked into the Seiler and seeth two angels in white sitting the one at the head and the other at the feet where the body of Jesus had Lain and they say unto her woman why weepest thou she saith unto them because they have taken away my Lord and I know not where they have laid him and when she had thus said she turned herself back and saw Jesus standing and knew not that it was Jesus Jesus sayith unto her woman why weepest thou whom seekest thou she supposing him to be the gardener saith unto him sir if thou H have borne him hence tell me where thou has laid him and I will take him away the Lord had his Blessing to the word word you may be seated I I think you know in the Providence of God if we could just kind of start meditating on on on this scene as it opens up to us to think about how that God uh he in in his in his for knowledge and the way he just playing the scene out he had Jesus uh Jesus buried was burried in uh there in in a in a garden tomb not just a tomb but a garden tomb so that when when uh he rose from the grave that this little scene could play out you think about what that Garden tomb must have looked like it was it wasn't just some dreary looking little place but flowers all over around and things planted and things blooming and and uh and so Mary she she was she was looking for the gardener she thought Jesus was the gardener and you know Jesus was not that Gardener not that Gardener of that of that Garden but maybe just take a little topic for tonight just to kind of study it out that he he is a gardener and and you know Isaac Watts was a songwriter in the 1600s and and Charles Spurgeon uh referred to a lot of his songs and he had a little song that went like this we are garden walled around Chosen and made peculiar ground a little spot in closed by Grace out of the world's wide Wilderness now if you take that thought and kind of think about how that God has pulled us out of all of the the our our spot in life our natural spot and pulled us in planted us into a garden and where where we can flourish and put put us in the ground and and uh like one little scripture will will say in the Bible that he he he'll dig around and and put dung there fertilizer and and get you all situated so that you can grow real good uh and he's got us walled in around so that we're protected and and and he's he's he's taking care of us and that's what a gardener does is he makes sure that the plants and everything is are growing right now see here we are sitting in this building and if you think of us that brother BR would refer to the Saints a lot of times as flowers you know how you don't mix up flowers you you want to be happy the way that you are the kind of flower that God has made you you don't want to kind try to say well I don't like the way the flower that I am so I'm just going to mix everything up you want to because God is God is he's he's made us a flower he's made us a garden and now you you think now really uh sometimes we make the gospel so complicated and so hard to understand but God has made it he made it in a way that using all these analogies and things of of planting something in the ground and something coming up that you could go take this gospel into the deepest darkest jungle and preach the Seven Seals now this is my conviction you could preach the Seven Seals and you could preach the most seems like the most complicated doctrines just talking about plants growing in the field and and I believe that that's what God the way that God growe the Bible was so that the simple you don't have to have a great big mind a great PhD or something to understand it it's something that you can just go out in the field and and and listen to maybe like John the John Wesley would be standing out in the middle of a field and start talking about nature watch the sunrise in the sunset watch the leaves fall off the tree in the fall and they come back the next year and you know there's got to be a resurrection because life goes down and it comes back up everything that you can see in nature so we see as we're looking at we're looking at God's G we're talking about God's Garden you can see that you can see these deep things expressed in in what God has laid out for us to be able to understand even in the Song of Solomon it says Thou that dwellest in the gardens now you think about this is the way that the shulamite woman referred to to to to to Solomon or the bride referring to to God thou that dwellest in the gardens that God is is that's where he makes his Abode because he's he wants to he wants to make sure that this crop comes ight he wants to make sure that you have everything that you need to flourish thou that dwellest in the gardens the companions hearken to thy voice cause me to hear it so he's walking in the garden and he and we want to hear his voice now Isaiah listen to this now it says now will I sing to my wellbeloved a song of my beloved touching his Vineyard that sounds like it comes from the song with Solomon but it's coming from Isaiah Isaiah chapter 5 my Bel my wellbeloved hath a Vineyard and a very fruitful Hill and he fenced it and gathered out the stones thereof and planted it with the choicest vine and built a tower in the midst of it and also made a wine press therein and he looked that it should bring forth grapes and it brought forth wild grapes The Vineyard of the lord of the hosts is the house of Israel and the men of Judah his Pleasant plant so who's the vineyard of the Lord is the The House of the House of Israel and this now is the the the the the true seed of Israel right here the seed the that I'm looking at and the men of Judah his Pleasant plant so you are his garden you are the Lord's garden now now Gardener is a person who tends and and cultivates a garden as a Pastime or for a living it's somebody that goes through the garden and makes sure that it's it's doing right and the Bible doesn't really refer to a gardener as a gardener the Bible refers to a gardener as as a husbandman so when you read the Bible it says it's talking about a when it says husbandman it's talking about a gardener and and and this Gardener now in Matthew Chapter 13 it says he that Seth The Good Seed is the son of man the field is the world the good seed are the children of the Kingdom so this Gardener that we're talking about is that somebody he's going around sewing he's trying to plant something in the ground and what he's sewing he's sewing the Bible says the field is the world a good seed are the children of the Kingdom now Jam I'm going to run through some scriptures kind of fast here and then we'll kind of get into the to the meat of this and maybe not be too long tonight as I as I warned you James chapter 5 7 says be patient therefore Brethren unto the coming of the Lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and hath long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain so now what's the gardener doing the gardener knows that sometimes it takes a while for that crop to come up you plant that seed down in the ground and you try to find some good ground to plant in and and then you wait and you're patient the husbandman The Gardener is waiting for the precious fruit of the earth now he planted something down in the very beginning and he waited and waited down through seven Church ages for it to come up and to mature and now he's finally seeing the fruits of all all of his all of his his all of his sacrifice all of what he did there on the cross he seeing the whole plan being fulfilled and of course you know when you when the whole plan is is is is done and completed you can take the whole seal off and see what God has done but the gardener what's the gardener doing he's wai waiting for the fruit may maybe I can express this afternoon that that God wants to see you bear fruit God if God is The Gardener of your life he wants to give you everything that you have need of he wants to give you he wants to plant the right thing in the ground of your heart he wants to plant the right thing in you and he wants to give you the right the right nourishment and the right rain and and dig around you and and put fertilizer there so that you have everything you need to grow up now in Luke Chapter 13 it says there's a parable that Jesus said and it's a parable that we Overlook a lot of times it says he spake also this Parable a certain man had a fig tree planted in his Vineyard and he came and sought fruit there on and found none then said he unto the dresser of his Vineyard behold these three years I come seeking fruit on this fig tree and find none cut it down why cth it the ground Now isn't that how a lot of times we look at maybe we'll look at our own life or the life of our family or something and say Well they're never going to come to church they're never they're never going to get uh bear fruit and and and this this dresser this person was saying uh uh to the dresser of the vineyard to The Gardener he said why don't you just cut this thing down and the gardener he answered and said unto him Lord let it alone this year also till I shall dig about it and dung it and if it bear fruit well and if not then after that thou shalt cut down so let I I want to say this afternoon let God work with the tree a little bit before giving up on it let God work with that fig tree a little bit before giving up on it but let God work with that with your children a little bit before giving on it up on it and saying well just cut it down that person in the church that seems like they're not doing what they're supposed to do or whatever let the gardener have at it and that's what the gardener is supposed he's got his prun and shears in his hand when we come to church that's what we're come to church for to get the get the things cut off of our life that that are causing us that are hindering us to be able to develop fruit right if we'll just be patient and wait on the Lord the garden will have his perfect work in us that you see none of that fruit none of the fruit would come without first planting the seed none of that fruit would come none of the fruit that we see here would come would have ever come without first planting the seed and so we go back to our original story there Jesus coming up out of the ground John 12 says verily verily I say unto you except the corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit he that loveth loveth his life shall lose it and he that hateth his life in this world shall keep it unto life eternal so you got a pattern there all down through the scripture of planting you see God wants to plant his word in you but first his word was planted in the ground and it rose on Easter morning and the reason the purpose for why it was planted in the ground was so it could be planted in you the Original Seed the original life the original word of God that was with God before the foundation of the world was planted in the Earth was planted in death so that you you could have life and and that original life was called a seed the seed this seed which is Christ that seed was planted in the ground and Galatians 3:16 it says now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made he saith not unto seeds of as of many but as of one unto thy seed which is Christ and Isaiah 53:10 it says yet it pleased the Lord to bruise him he ha put him to grief when thou shalt make his soul an offering for sin he shall see his seed and he shall prolong his days and the pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his hand he will was the word he was the original Life The Original Seed he was in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and brother Ram said and the spoken word is the Original Seed he said every spoken word of God is the Original Seed now see you oh if we could kind of grasp that this morning that when that word was planted that se that word it had it had there had to be it had to produce something when it was planted in the ground it had to rise for to produce life to give life and when that word of God is planted in your heart it's going to produce something if it's planted in good ground if it's planted in good ground it's going to produce oh what a promise we've got laying there this afternoon that if the word if you receive the word of God and it's planted in the good ground of your heart it is going to produce life and I see this afternoon we're not just talking about denominational ideas or our own caral ideas or our own thoughts about what's right and wrong but if we take what's laying here in the Bible and receive it in the way that God wants us to receive it it is going to come up and produce something it's going to actually produce the Life of Christ in us because that's was planted the original word was planted in the in the ground and Christ the word the original word rose up from the ground and when it's planted in your heart the original word will rise up in your life and produce itself again brother said every spoken word of God is the Original Seed God planted everything in the Earth by his word and as long as you stay with the orinal Original Seed it will breede itself right back and reproduce itself again as long as you see stay with that original seed why because that Original Seed is the word of God it's God himself in letter form and when you receive it in your heart it comes off the page into a spiritual a spiritual life manifesting God himself that's what the gardener is trying to do he's trying to seow the word plant the seed plant the seed in your life and he's looking for good ground to do it the Bible says that he said I am the resurrection and the life he that believeth in me though he were dead yet shall he live that that means is live a Living Word the things that that Christ did that you will do also Healing The Sick and raising the dead because the Life of Christ is manifested in you God is a Master Gardener a master husbandman a master a Master Gardener is somebody that knows every in and out of what to do how to cast out Devils how to how to give nourishment to the plant what to cut off when and where what kind of bug is good or bad a Master Gardener know what's knows what's right for his church if the church is the garden that first corn of wheat was planted in the Earth Earth so that you could have a life in Genesis 2: 8 and9 it says that the Lord God planted a garden Eastward in Eden see God's all about Gardens and and in verse n out of the ground made the Lord God to grow every tree cuz he's a Gardener He's a Master Gardener a husbandman and he made out of the ground to grow every tree that is Pleasant to the sight and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and every believer every believer in Christ is connected to his planning and death because he was planted so that we can have life through him in John chapter 15 he said I am the True Vine and my father is the husbandman my father is the gardener every branch of me that beareth not fruit he taketh away and every branch that beareth fruit he purgeth it that it may bring forth more fruit now you are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you abide in me and I in you as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself except that abide in the vine no more can ye except ye abide in me I am the vine ye are the branches he that abideth in me and I in him the the same bringeth forth much fruit for without me he can do nothing if a b if a man abide not in me he is cast forth as a branch and his withered and Men gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned if you abide in me and my words abide in you you shall ask what you will and it shall be done unto you so there's a we've got a principle of Life laying there that if you plant a seed in good ground and you water it it will produce if you plant a seed in good ground and water it it is go it is going to produce now all through the scripture we've got this the story of God's Garden we've got Gardens All Through the Bible you can read about seeds the Tree of Life the tree planted by the rivers of water the Fig Tree and the bride tree there's Vines and trees and rain there's rain that Elijah said there rain ain't going to fall until I call for it and then the rain fell after he got everything in order again after he killed all the priests of Baal and Baal as we'll get into later is is a rain God a fertility God and they were worshiping the rain God and when the When when when when Elijah killed all the priests of baale then the rain fell from the real God the wheat and the tears and all the little foxes that spoil the vine that get in there and mess up the garden that you've got to take care of because the little the little foxes the little things of Life are the things that we've got to get rid of and there's grafting and there's husbandmen and laborers and there's you that are part of God's garden and Satan's scheme all this time is to keep the garden from growing Satan's scheme is to keep that Garden from grow what Satan trying to do this even this afternoon he's trying to keep you from from hearing the word because he wants to mess up mess he wants to make your heart Stony he wants to let make Thorns grow up so that the word can't be planted he wants to get your mind off on something else get you distracted he wants to make you think maybe that the preacher don't know what he's talking about or the people in church or this or that and get you distracted this way or that way because the devil is trying to keep the the the word of God from being planted in you that what's the devil's the devil's tactic is to introduce something else so that you know like hybridization from the very beginning if we'll talk about hybridization you take like a grapefruit and a tangerine and hybridize them together and then you got a tangelo which can never go back to a grapefruit it can never go back to a tangerine because it's not either one of those things now it's a tangelo you've mixed it all together and so you take the word of God and mix it with something else you'll you'll never be able to reproduce The Life of Christ it'll never be able to produce the Life of Christ because you've taken it now now see we a lot of times we'll we'll we'll we'll start thinking about like major doctrines and stuff but you can just you can you you take the the raw word of God and mix in with there some live the devil that you can't get the the Holy Ghost is not for you or I can't get my healing I've been dealing so long with my predicament or whatever that and now you've mixed it up with something and it won't produce but if you let the word of God be sewed into your heart into good ground it's going to produce you see what you see as we grow up the stature of of the perfect man that's what God is trying to teach to us as our faith is home and and as our as as we begin as word precept upon precept is piled we begin to our mind like brother boy's been preaching on our our mind is actually renewed to begin to realize that these things are possible that all things are possible to them that believe where where early on maybe in our journey we began to stumble at things and we we we maybe we even stumbled at whether we were truly born again and the devil would battle at us about those things but then you begin to realize that these things that we really do have have a power in the church that we really do have the power of love and forgiveness and that God really is moving in your life and and there really is something and you see all that hybridization is being taken out as we become in Oneness with God Oneness with God is what we're after not one not Oneness Oneness with God will produce Oneness with one another if we'll just get one with we if we'll look at Christ if we'll love Christ in the way that we should we'll we'll start loving one another the way that we should also hybridization is what the devil the devil wants to keep you from believing to think to think that you're you're fine just the way you are I was reading a quote the other day where brother said that's what the devil's tactic is to think that to make you think that whatever wherever you are you're fine the way you are the young people to think that you can post stuff on Tinder and go look at at websites and all kinds of stuff and that you're fine the way you are old people as well that you're fine cuz that's what the devil's lie is to to make you think well I'm good I'm I'm I'm okay just the the way that I am to think it really or to think that it don't really matter what you believe but it does matter because what you believe is what's sewn into your heart and what's sewn into your heart if it's the Original Seed the original life is going to produce amen what you allow to take root in your life is what will grow and manifest oh you see why it's so important to be careful of what you look at and what you listen to and you you start start listening to some podcast that's got a bunch of weird ideas about what gender people are and all that kind of stuff and before long you you'll start thinking along those line what you what you what you allow to take root in your life is what will grow and manifest that's why you say it matters it matters what you believe that you start you maybe sometimes you come to church and you think well we're just being too critical but no because it matters what's sewn in your heart I don't want any weeds or Thorns growing in my ground I want to get all the Stones rooted out I want to get all the Thorns rooted out because because it matters now you you see you look at Cain's life that had hybridized life that that Kane Cain he wanted to be a a he was like a good a good message believer he was at he was at church all the time he was he was worshiping but he he he his his the way that his when when Abel presented the word to him the true revelation of the hour he said no I don't want that you're going to have to come my way or take that my way the highway my way is good enough you you can take it or leave it and and so Cain was rejected balum balum that H hybrid his hybrid way of thinking was to take his own ideas his own thoughts to say that we're we're just all the same you see why ministers hit on that so much that we're not all the same what makes us different from the rest of the world is what we believe what we believe sets us apart and makes us different what it's Christ that makes us different we're not all the same like balam would have you believe we're we're all the same no there's something that makes us different and a hybrid product what's the difference between a hybrid and and and the real the real has life and the hybrid does not have life in it a hybrid product has no life it ain't no good brother R said it makes a better looking ear but it ain't got no life in it that's the way it makes a better looking church but no life in it hybrid that's right you see the truth the original truth the original life has life in it the Original Seed brings the original life that's where the life comes from because it's the that are it's that original life the lie that Cain believed was his own works and the fruits of the field were sufficient but the truth that Abel believed was that he needed a blood sacrifice and that was life in what Abel believed now see if the life matters if the life matters then the seed matters the seed matters the seed brings a life so it matters what you believe God is still looking for some good planting ground to plant his word somebody that knows that it matters what you believe somebody that's ready to open up their heart to receive God's word no matter what the cost because the Bible says in 1 Peter chap 1: 23 it says being born again not of corruptible seed but of Incorruptible by the word of God which liveth and abideth forever that's actually how we're born Again by receiving the word by that word being planted in your life come on now y'all y'all if y'all if y'all agree with this y'all pull a little bit y'all making me feel like I y'all don't y'all don't believe what I'm saying here we're born by the word of God we're not born by some Incorruptible word Incorruptible man's ideas or anything but we're born by the by The Incorruptible word of God now here's here's the meat and potatoes this afternoon that I kind of want to get into is that when Jes Jesus told this Parable and see how a lot of these deep things that Jesus simplified them down so that we can understand and Jesus told this Parable that about the SE went forth to seow and there was different kinds of ground that the seed went into and that first of all that that he he told about this scenario this situation where the the the seed fell by the wayside and the birds of the the the air came and picked it up plucked it and plucked it away and and so the seed didn't get a chance to root in the ground now what's he talking about in all these Parables I I think we know we we've got the background well we've heard this over and over but what he's what's he talking about he's talking about you he's talking about your ground that he wants to sew his word he's he's the gardener that wants to sew his word in your ground so now it depends whether the word of God takes root and actually manifest it all depends on the ground the ground is the problem the ground is the thing that if we can if we can get our ground tilled up and softened up and so that it's good ground and so now it's going to produce so I I want to know what good ground is don't you want to know what good ground is this afternoon because I want the word of God to be produced in my life I want to have the right attitude I want to have the right mindset for the word of God to be able to take root in my life so that it can produce so that others can see Christ in me now now so we've got all these examples of the birds the fowls of the air coming and picking up the seed that fell by the wayside and the others that fell on this Stony ground and the sun just just burn it up because it couldn't take root down enough to get moisture and others where the the Thorns that all these things grew up around and just choked it out now now see this this afternoon don't get all drawn up on now you don't want Thorns to choke out the life do you we want to get all the stone out of our if we can get the stone out of our out of our ground and get the Thorns take care of the thorn rip up those Thorns take get those thorns out so that the seed can get rooted and really get a good fooo hold so that when so that when the rain comes and the storms and the sleep and the snow that you got you're rooted and it don't bother you anymore because you know what you believe that's what this Parable is talking about a Christian that has received the word so strongly said open themselves up to where God can do something with him now Jesus said he said these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard that talking about the where the where the uh where the SE is cast by the wayside it falls by the wayside and it and the birds of the air come and pick it up he said these are they by the wayside where the word is sown but when they have heard when you've heard it then Here Comes Satan immediately and taketh away the word that was sown in their hearts Here Comes Satan as soon as you hear the word as soon as the word's preached Here Comes Satan to say well the cloud was really caused by a missile and all of the sudden Here Comes The Devil to take put some idea in your head and Away you go and you stop listening to the word and now now you you you the the word can't take root in your ground cuz there's the devil to tell you that well we don't have any newspaper records of exactly how many people fell off the bridge and see these are examples now but let's apply it to your life Here Comes The Devil to tell you well like like that little girl that was healed in in brother Ram's meeting and she was actually healed of being deaf and she went home and started listening to her family and her family told her well I don't think you really got her your healing and what was that doing that was the devil coming to take away that word that had been sown in her heart and now she lost her healing because there was the devil to take it away Here Comes The Devil to tell you well I don't think you can really get the baptism of the Holy Ghost I don't think that church has it I don't some people in brother bram's campaign lost their healing well there was a lot of people in brother bram's campaign that kept their healing listen you know there's so many things to look at like like the the young man that I was talking about at the wedding this Sunday that had looked at so many Hypocrites over the ages but listen that well there's a lot of Hypocrites and a lot of weird stuff that there is a genuine and I that's I I was telling my wife the other day that's one of my missions in life is I want to represent this message in a way that's not weird I I think the message has been there's so much been so much weird stuff around the message and I heard one preacher preaching on it like this he said that you know the the the gospel is for broken people and so is going to attract a lot of broken people but let's not look at the Brokenness but let's look at what God can do to those broken lives that God can pack somebody up and transform you you get so looking at all the Hypocrites and all the trash and all the weird stuff going on but there is a real genuine Holy Ghost filled bride that's being transformed by the word that she has received in the good ground of her heart you know all these things that people look at but you know all those nine visions that all the all the different visions was it seven 7 n how many however many it was the egg shaped car all those things are coming to pass a nation that's one run by a woman a woman's Nation surely you can look around and see that prophecy is being fulfilled all the things about the magin all line and watch Russia not the USSR but Russia watch Russia and now Russia her name was changed from the USSR to Russia to fulfill what brother Brown spoke about all those years ago see the devil the devil will come along and when the word is sown if it's sown if it's not sown in good ground the devil will come and try to snatch it away don't let the devil snatch it away am maybe tonight this is for somebody sitting here maybe it's for somebody listening in online you know the devil will come along he'll he'll tell you all kind of he'll say you well you know better than the preacher you're more spiritual than anyone here and boy that's something that'll snatch that seed away you're more spir you got a better better this better that better experience you have a greater understanding he'll tell you all kinds of stuff or that don't that don't apply to you that don't apply to you you're fine but they see you got to have that good ground because the good ground ground that ain't Stony ground without all the Thorns ground without the where the devil can't snatch it away where you just let it take root it's going to produce oh brother Bob this is simple but you know the gospel is simple not simple not not the go El the gospel is simple enough that anybody can receive it and anybody can be changed what's what's Satan's motive Satan's motive is to discredit the word when the word is preached in truth and in power there's Satan standing right there to come along and say well well I don't think brother Brandon was real honest I I I I went on believe the sign today and I was looking at all their list of all their nonsence and stuff that they they they what it is it's the devil trying to discredit what God has said that brother Brandon was dishonest that was the most honest man you could he even told the IRS guy that that I told I I stepped out of my house and and and and told my wife to say that I wasn't there and he said well now I really believe you because you are so so honest enough to come and tell me all of these things about the cloud and the bridge and the devil even try to discredit your testimony you come out you go home and say well I've been healed I feel like I've Been Changed come back from a camp meeting and say that God did something for me and there'll be somebody waiting for you when you get back from camp to say well I don't think you really got it you just were emotional there's somebody somebody that the devil will work through around every corner to discredit your healing to discredit your salvation but you let that word of God take root in your heart enough where nothing could take it away that's what God wants that word to sink down into that good ground where God can do something with you where the husband can begin to work that's what the devil's job is to discredit the preachers to discredit your pastor to discredit your friends to discredit even your good intentions you try to do something good and the devil will be right around the corner to say well well you are trying to do that out of spite or something oh don't you remember the story when David come up upon the scene where they were that Goliath was making his big boast and all of his brothers were standing there to say oh you're just full of mischief you're coming up here just to stir up trouble but David wasn't there to stir up trouble but they were that it was the devil trying to discredit his good intentions the devil will even discredit the things you can see with your eyes and hear with your ears he will discredit that you can see a picture of the pillar of fire that was taken by the enemies of this gospel he will try to discredit that and say that it ain't real Satan will do anything he can to keep that seed from being planted you see because if that seed is planted and if it takes root it is going to produce what's this going to produce it's going to produce like Christ when he was planted in the ground he rose up in vict Victory and power and when it's planted in your life it will rise up in Victory and power the same way because it's the word that's sown in your heart not some man's ideas but it's the word it's the word of God that we believe it's the word of God that we preach it's the word of God that we've heard and received into our hearts the Bible says Jesus said when he was telling parable of the of the of the the rich man and and Lazarus he said unto him Laz this is Lazarus that told the rich man he said down down in in in the grave he said if they hear not Moses and the prophets neither will be that will they be persuaded the one rose from the dead that's a description of somebody where the Devil comes and snatches that seed away because even if you saw like they saw Lazarus sitting there at the table with Jesus but yet they would not believe and I was reading this in the scripture today even the Pharisees actually conspired to kill Lazarus because so many people were believ in Jesus could you imagine a situation where men's Hearts would get so hard that they would actually see God's word manifested before them and want to kill the proof of it they wanted to kill Lazarus because they knew that people were being converted because of his presence but I want to say to you this afternoon don't let Satan keep you from believing this word is true this gospel is true and it will produce what it says it will now the Bible talks about Jesus talked about the the when the when the word is swn when the seed is swn on Stony ground and he said these are they likewise which are swn on Stony ground who when they have heard the word immediately receive it with gladness so get real happy about it but but it can't take root they have no root in themselves and so endure but for a Time afterward when Affliction or persecution ariseth for the word's sake immediately they are offended now so see they H they hear the good news real and it and it makes them real excited at first but then then Hard Times come and a lot of times hard times don't really come from maybe from your people you work with so much sometimes hard times come from the people that you go to church with and I I think sometimes that ain't really preach preach too much but that's the truth isn't it sometimes sometimes hard things come hard things offenses might come from a preacher offenses might come from a deacon offenses might come from the people that you live with and sometimes sometimes people people will say stuff at church that's a little bit mean or whatever what are you going to do then if you're not rooted and grounded then what are you going to do you're going to say well you started the race well then off you go listen now I I didn't see that at the beginning of my Christian journey and if it's the beginning of yours maybe you won't see it either you look back down the life life's Road and and see all the ones that have just got so offended at something that was said listen this gospel is not not something that needs to be presented to you in a certain way it might be presented one way it might be presented by old Gruff Peter one way or it might be presented on a silver platter or the other but if it's not always presented on a nice gold platter under a little a little thing where they pull it off with or on a on a satin pillow then you can't say well that's not the word of God it's still the word of God even if it's presented from a donkey's mouth like it was when ba to balum even if it's presented to you from a donkey's mouth it's still the word of God somebody that's where the word is St on Stony ground see what is it it's talking about it's talking about people it's talking about us this is a parable of us not of out there in the field somewhere the quick starter like that like that rabbit that that can't finish the race somebody that's real excited about church but without that staying power no endurance because they're not rooted no root and when persecution arise persecutions arise immediately they are what offended there's that forgotten beatitude that keeps coming up blessed are those that are not offended in me you got to be rooted you got to be rooted so you can stand on your own I I think sometimes that fail we fail to understand that God wants us to stand on our own now what that means though in practice now what that means is if somebody says something rough to you you don't just fly off the handle but you're you're rooted and you know you know what you know what you're here for you know you're predestinated you're ordained to fulfill the word of God and you don't just go run it off somewhere oh you oh offense is such a such a strong thing that Jesus even dealt with in the scripture you you you think about even that scenario in the Bible when that little woman was was there washing Jesus's feet and she had went through all the naysayers and all the critics to sit get down at Jesus's feet and begin to wash it and people were mocking her and saying well don't Jesus know who that is and and there was a man Judas over to the side that looked at that scene play out and he started getting offended he started to think well I know better than Jesus he said the Bible says that he says why was not this ointment sold for 300 p and given to the poor he started judging that scene now see a lot of times it it looks like in our from your from a natural perspective that that would make sense that that you'd want to give to the poor that you want to have a cake line and all those kind of things but but Jesus Judas didn't understand he didn't understand what was happening there and it wasn't long before Judas killed the very thing that he claimed to love because he was offended because he got offended you see that that Stony heart when that seed Stone on Stone on that Stony ground you start getting Afflicted and you feel like something's something's wrong and you feel like what it what it does just like it did with Judas is you start you start hating the preacher now I'm telling you you you start but why why why do people hate the preacher why do people get upset at the preachers because they're preaching something that's trying to line up their life to try to correct their life and they they'll start something within them is is causing them to to not like the preacher something within them is like you shouldn't have said it like that you shouldn't have done it like that but what about what about Jesus and that woman washing his feet Judah said it shouldn't have been done like that but and he had a good point maybe that ointment that ointment I I read in one place would have been about like like $220,000 of today's money $22,000 and that woman she broke that glass and washed Jesus's feet with it we get so offended about things we're we're eager to hear we're eager to hear things you know you know brother R was he compared it to like a hot house a hot house plant is a plant that it's not rooted in the ground and you got to you got to constantly move it from one place to the other so it can get when it's raining and sleeping outside you got to move it into that green that hot house plant so that it can be in a nice little spot you you got to move it over here and move it over there do it and the hot that little plant might say well am I supposed to deal with this am I supposed to just tolerate this and that might be a question we're asking today am I supposed to just let stuff go and the answer is yes am I supposed to just let stuff go when things go wrong yes I'm supposed to just let it go brother BR said well I the hot house plant will say well I'll never go again this is all there is to it oh my no wonder you can't hold that swort of Faith no wonder you compromise on the words you go somewhere where you can hear some kind of a little sissify I something put together cuz that's what a hot house plant wants a hot house plant don't want that good nourishment where it's you're digging up around them and digging up all the stone all the thorns and everything but you see the Stony ground the Stony ground is a problem with your ground it's a problem with the ground offenses and trials and tests will come but what will you do when they do will you give up will you throw in the towel or you will you be rooted and grounded and stay the course that Stony ground is the problem but let God speak to your heart this afternoon soften up your heart to his word there's a promise in Ezekiel chapter 36 that that Stony heart can be softened up made a heart of Flesh yield yourself to him don't be critical don't be skeptical somebody come to church and be all critical and everything you're going to get what you expect like brother R said don't be hardened to the preacher don't don't want the preacher to struggle but desire to re receive from God cuz your heart you want you want to have a heart that can receive that word in the good ground and a good ground let let me just say something here listen you can we I think sometimes we battle so much with offenses and things and we think we think we almost normalize being offended but listen you can come to a place where it don't bother you and God wants you to come to a place where it don't bother you God wants you to come to a place where listen it listen I I remember when I started preaching I used to preach about how you need to I I was thinking about this one of my very first sermons was you got to come to a place where if somebody looks you in the face and says I don't think you got the Holy Ghost and it doesn't bother you you got to come to that place where if somebody if somebody says something rude it doesn't bother you now it gets real quiet here I feel like I feel like it does when brother Louise is preaching listen I hope I hope I hope you love me I thought I thought this was going to be a real uplifting sermon and y'all now the Bible says and these which are sown among Thorns such as hear the words and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and the lust of other things entering in choke the word and it become unfruitful now somebody you think about this now somebody that wants to be a good Christian sitting out there and they hear the word but then all these cares and all these other things begin to begin to grow why because what you what you what you allow to plant in your ground those Thorns have a seed too and you've allowed it to get in your ground and begin to grow up around and choke it out all that all them romance novels you listening to and all that stuff you listen to and all the false preaching and all the and all the wrong ideas that you've allowed to root in your mind and in your your heart and what it is is somebody looking for a reason to not believe somebody just Desiring to be a chrisan without being changed I want to be Christian but I still want all these things in the world I still want to I still want to go out and and and Gamble and and I'm I'm skirting around some stuff so I'm so I won't be too rude loving the world more than God loving the when you love the world more than God my my listen my when you say well I I I would go to church but now my family is going to be real offended if I go to church so I I'd rather just I I I want to I want to make sure that I I give more precedence to my family and everything they're having this special event and every other Sunday is having a special event so I'm going to go over there my family is doing something I want to show them my love and win them over to Christ but that's not how you show the love of Christ you show the love of Christ by by obeying his word and doing what his word says putting God first and that what Jesus said when he was telling all these Parables about he said that all these people were invited to a feast invited to to come and gather and one said well I bought a piece of ground and I I must needs go see it I pray the have me excused I bought a piece of ground over here and after I bought it I got to go check it out all these excuses all these reasons all these Thorns that are growing up excuses reasons to not let is preventing that seed of the word from growing and taking root in you I bought five yolk of oxin and I go to prove them I pray that you have me excused I bought five Yol of oxin and I got to got to go see these rather than go to the feast I got to go take care of this over here I'm married a wife and therefore I cannot come a thorn a thorn that pokes and hurts and and and it when you hear the word of God being preached and but yet it's poking at you my friends won't like me if I live like that I I'll be embarrassed if I get up and raise my hands I'll be embarrassed if I say if I if I say Amen I'll be I I can't that thorn that's poking you I I can't go to church on Sunday because we got this special event that only happens every now and again and I got to do this because my family wants me to do it and I got to show them love what about God the first commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy Soul that's the first commandment above every other commandment to put God first above everything else above everything else when you want to be popular so you don't you want you want to dress like the world and live like the world that's that thorn creeping in you want to you go to school and and everybody's dressing a certain way and you think well I got to be I got to dip my toe into those worldly Waters that's that thorn creeping in thorns and Pricks are the problems the problem of a heart that's not right so let's get rid of all those Thorns the prickly thoughts and desires all the lust of anything contrary to the world let's get rid of it let's root it all out so that the word of God can be planted in our heart what's what's all the these Thorns all these video games and romance novels and even housework if there's anything that can keep you from the word of God or from doing what God wants you to do from church and from your prayer life we sometimes we even let family interfere with our prayer life we're let we we're let to to think that we would let birthdays and anniversaries interfere with our prayer life and with with our time with God all those Thorns that are creeping in so that the word of God cannot be planted in your heart because it's a heart problem you would rather go to the birthday party or the anniversary party or something than to to go where you're supposed to go what you allow in your field will slowly take over brother R and I was reading this this message where he he look he was preaching away and he said he said is somebody up in the balcony would say I wonder if he discerned that there was somebody up in the balcony that had a problem he said brother brandom I once had the victory I once was a Godly person but somehow another the weeds and the thorns and things has choked me down I'm not where I ought to be I I know I'm not pray for me brother brandom now he was asking that asking that to the congregation and and I could repeat those words tonight and ask you that if there's all these thorns and things that have encroached on your life to where you know that you're not where you need to be then then maybe tonight that you could just reach out to God by faith and say God forgive me I from now on I want to change I want to be different I want something different in my life I I want to get all those thorns and all that Stony ground cleared up because I want to have a good ground in my heart where the word of God can take root and be planted and reproduce and that's where the Bible says in Matthew 13:8 but other fell into good ground and brought forth fruit some 100 fold some 60-fold some 30 fold into good ground now that's the kind of ground that we want to be tonight isn't it the kind of ground that can produce fruit there's a promise that if the seed falls into good ground it will bring for forth forth I want you to take that home with you tonight and as you're driving home let that Echo around in that space in your skull that there is a promise that if that seed falls into good ground it will bring forth it will bring forth if it falls into good ground so let me be good ground how many wants to bring forth tonight you want to bring forth that be good ground if there's something wrong in my life say oh God take out take out everything that's wrong in my life because I want to be the kind of good ground brother said now the seed you people here who are farmers every seed will produce if it's in the right kind of ground and every Divine promise of God in the Bible will produce if it's met in the right kind of a heart it'll produce the promise now every means every every don't mean some but every promise in the Bible bble will produce if it falls into good ground oh this this is might be a simple sermon tonight but it's a rich sermon because it's a promise there that you can lay claim to tonight that if you'll just open up the door of your heart and let that word of God sink down in there begin to take root and say I believe how do you do that say I believe it I believe it despite everything that I see I believe it despite everything that I hear or feel because I'm not looking to my circumstances but I'm looking to the UN I'm looking to a real that cannot be discerned by my natural eye I'm looking to the promises of God and that will produce it will produce because it's a promise brother said if you have need of Salvation believe that he saves you and accept his sacrificial death and you shall receive what you've asked for if you're in need of Salvation tonight if you'll believe it then you will receive it if you're weary and gloomy and feel like that everyone's against you come unto me all ye that labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest that's a seed accept it and if you're sick he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we're healed accept it it's a seed will produce oh do you see what that seed is that Original Seed was Christ the seed that was the seed that was with God in John 1:1 and that seed was manifested in flesh and planted in the ground and Rose against and every word that we preach and every word that we hear was sown by the son of man that means that every word that we're hearing is part of that Original Seed what I'm preaching to you tonight is not just something that I'm making up on the fly but it's the word of God and if you receive it you are receiving God himself let it take Ru in you and it will reproduce and be born in you that's what what is the seed in Acts chapter 2 it says the promise is to you and to your children to those way off as many as the Lord will call and that's a see that if you receive it you can receive that promise in James 5 verse1 15 it says the prayer of faith shall save the sick and the Lord shall raise him up and if he have committed sins they shall be forgiven him that's a seed that if you will take let it take root in your heart tonight right now your sins can be forgiven you if you will believe it oh you think well I've gone too far I've done something too bad I I I I I I need to do Penance and all these things what you need to do is accept what God has already done for you and believe it and let it take root in your life let it take root in that good ground and accept your deliverance the Bible says in James 5:116 the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much now there's a seed that if we'll take to our prayer chamber something will happen if you go to your prayer chamber and believe that your prayer will do something something will produce in Isaiah 53 it says he was wounded for our transgressions he was bruised for our iniquities the chastisement of our peace was upon him and with his stripes we are healed there's something that I can receive for myself and believe and it will produ what what will it produce deliverance from my my iniquities forgiveness of my sins it'll produce healing in my body it'll produce a body change Psalm chapter 103 says oh my soul forget not all his benefits now that's a scripture we quote a lot of times why because we forget we forget what we've got access to that youve got benefits who forgiveth all thine iniquities who Health all thy diseases plant I want that seed to be planted in your heart tonight and it will produce what produce that all your iniquities will be forgiven all your diseases will be healed if you can believe if you can believe it will reproduce Psalm chapter 92 say those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall flourish in the courts of our God they shall bring forth fruit in old age they shall be fat and flourishing who's going to flourish those that that Gardener has planted if he's planted you and rooted you'll be like a tree that's planted by the rivers of water those that are planted are going to produce amen but when the word if you're when the word is planted in you you got to die to all your ideas for life to be born brother R said you have to die you have to die before you can be reborn any seed has to die before it's regenerated again unless it dies it abides alone a man has got to die to his own thinking he's got to die to the thinking of anything but God's word and come his way that's God's ground so if we can die to our pride if we can lay aside all of our pride and lay aside all of our Envy oh if we can lay aside our pride I think that's that holds us back from receiving so many blessings Pride manifests itself in kind of weird forms sometimes sometimes we'll be so Pride that we don't want to admit that there's something wrong in our family or in our children's lives and our pride will try to cover that up and try to try to have this appearance that everything's good but I I want to encourage you just lay your pride on the Altar and just I remember when my kids were going through I've done many things wrong but one thing I did right was I used to tell these ministers and you can testify of it when you preach you feel at Liberty to preach on my kids cuz we listen if you lay your pride lay your pride down lay your pride Pride on the altars where you're not you're not trying to keep somebody from from preaching something that will help your family lay your pride down so that when you go when you go home from A good sermon that you're not saying well I don't know if he said it right or whatever lay aside all your Envy lay aside all your jealousy you've got to die to yourself and die to the way that you think it should be you don't want to be a Judas that kills the very thing that you say that you love lay aside all of your criticism lay aside everything things so that you'll have nothing left but good ground that the word can be received and be born in lay aside every weight that so easily besets us don't worry about what your neighbor's thinking about be concerned with what God thinks if you're concerned with what God thinks and everything will work itself out oh if we could just forget about what our neighbor thinks forget about what your neighbor thinks about how you praise God or how you raise your hand forget about what your neighbor thinks take what the son of man SW it and receive it into your heart oh we if we could just die you know Jesus when when they heard about Lazarus he waited for 4 days so he could be good and dead so that he could come forth and be a living testimony and sit there beside him at that feast and everybody would look at him and see that God's word was true but he had to wait till he was dead he waited till Lazarus was dead Elijah to that widow woman she had to she had to die to her own ideas when Elijah said you first you going to make make some food for me if she wouldn't have done that would she have received her blessing but she died to her own thinking and and she she first fed Elijah the last little bit that she had because she was willing to die if we can be willing to K up the ground and break up that ground and Grub out all the green briers and all the stickers and all the thorns and all the roots of bitterness it'll bring down the holy spirit in our lives and we can get serious with God cuz why it's the ground that matters the ground that matters the ground is the thing that matters you are actually growing up from the earth you are predestinated to fulfill his word so keep your Vineyard eat the right food like brother Aaron was preaching on the other night look at the right things entertain the right things because it matters what you allow to take root in your life be planted in Christ and you'll grow up like a tree the Bible says in Psalm chapter 1 he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water that bringeth forth his fruit and his season his Leaf also shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper the ungodly are not so but are like the chaff which the wind driveth away what kind of chaff can we see examples of in the Bible that Cain Cain that was just like his life was blown away to nothing because he was fine with being around the message but he didn't want to receive the word that Abel had balum that liked religion but he didn't want to receive he didn't want to recognize that the puler of fire was in that camp of the Israelites lot that liked being real close to the to to the world but not enough he he liked he liked the message he liked Abraham's message but not enough to leave the world Judas that he liked being half in and half out second Timothy says having a form of God un us but denying the power thereof and what is your power this afternoon the power is the word if you'll accept the seed of the word that's sewn let it be swn into your heart you're that good ground like Abel that wanted the word and Moses and Abraham that were the word for their day and when the seed is planted what does every every good Gardener do when the seed is planted what are you going to do you're going to water it yeah when that seed is planted the rain will fall and now I'm closing here in just a few minutes Elijah that story of Elijah that we were telling earlier he destroyed the priest of the of of Baal and destroyed destroyed all the those Priests of ba like baale baale what he was ba was this they believe that he was the fertility God and uh since we're a mixed audience I I try to try to be a little bit vague with this but the rain would actually uh Baal with the fertility God would cause the rain to fall on the Earth and the Earth would receive the rain in in an act we'll say it like that and the the result of the ACT would be the fruit of the earth coming up all the all the the harvest coming up and you see what they were what they were worshiping they were worshiping this fertility God that caused the skies to open up and rain now see Elijah came forth and he tore he he he killed all those all those Priests of Baal and and he first thing Elijah did in in in in First Kings chapter 17 was he says rain is not going to come until I call for it not When baale Calls for it not when all these Priests of bail that say they can do something but when I call for it and Elijah came through and he cleared all those he he killed all the priests of baale and he erected he He restored that all alter of the Living God just like the word is being the Elijah in this day was sent to restore the word that we believe and after he rebuilt the altar then he looked up and he saw a little cloud like a like a the size of a man's Fist and it started getting bigger and he said there's a sound of abundance of rain you see what happens when you receive the word of God in your heart the rain is going to fall and it's going to Quicken it brother said the preaching of the word brings his presence the working of Miracles brings his presence the preaching of the Gospel the word is what brings his presence oh sometimes we say well I wonder if God's going to be with us tonight but if the word is here God is going to be here because there a promise the promise is that God God is always with his word the preaching of the Gospel unlocks the Holy Ghost to the Jews in Acts chapter 2 it the preaching of the Gospel is what did that when Peter came out and he began to preach the preaching of the Gospel is is what unlocked the Holy Ghost to the Samaritans in Acts chapter 8 and this what unlock the Holy Ghost to the Gentiles in Acts chapter 10 that's right and it will do the same today amen whosoever will let him come if the word will sink into your heart the rain will water it there's a promise laying there in the Bible of Joel chapter 2 and it shall come to pass afterward that I will pour out my spirit upon All Flesh and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy your old men shall dream dreams your young men shall see visions and also upon the servants and upon the handmaids in those days will I pour out my spirit brother R said and believ in God he said brother I believe that right now at this minute that the power of the Holy Ghost that's in this room to cheer every sick person there is that you could feel the cloud the size of a man's hand he's talking about that cloud that Elijah saw and holler I hear the sound of perfect healing if you reject and say well I didn't get nothing then they'll die out the hot waves of hell and doubt will faded out of your soul but when you get that little grain of seed stand on it when that seed is sewn in your heart you hang on to that it ain't like the rock of jalter but like the Rock of Ages stand there and you'll feel the sound of abundance of rain the word of faith what was the word given the word of faith was given like like when when when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and preached to the Samaritans and preached to the Gentiles the word was given to unlock every promise it was given to unlock the power of the Holy Ghost in your life that's what the word is for the word of faith was given to open up the windows of heaven so that the word can be manifest in your life the word of faith was given to make the Bible live that's what the Holy Ghost is it's the word on the page living in action in you brother said looking under Jesus as the musicians come forward he said the spirit makes the word to live to the promise in other words it's a seed the spirit gives its life it unction eyeses it gives it its go like rain gives to the seed that's buried in the ground it breaks forth life and in Satan's eating he said the Holy Ghost is the action in you it's a life not an emotion not some sort of a fleshly evidence but it is a person Jesus Christ the word of God established in your heart to Quicken every word of this age and the end time seed sign he said take his word and believe it hold it in your heart and when the rain begins to fall life will take hold and the word will manifest itself how
