[9:06] heading straight to the wedding
[9:09] on Sunday then just remember us in your
[9:12] prayers
[9:13] as we travel
[9:15] so let's go to the where where this this
[9:18] evening
[9:19] how many love the word
[9:21] amen praise the Lord Jesus I want to
[9:23] speak this evening on a tale of two sons
[9:25] amen a tale of two sons and we want to
[9:28] read from Luke chapter 15 Luke chapter
[9:31] 15 and we're going to start at verse 1.
[9:34] first one
[9:39] the Bible says
[9:41] then Drew near unto him all the
[9:43] publicans and sinners for to hear him
[9:47] now I want you to I want you to notice
[9:50] that
[9:51] who was coming to Jesus to listen to him
[9:54] in his word and it was we see here that
[9:58] it was the publicans and the Sinners
[10:00] came to hear him and then in verse two
[10:01] it says and the Pharisees and scrubs
[10:03] murderers saying this man received the
[10:06] Sinners and eateth with them
[10:09] so it wasn't just publicans and sinners
[10:11] that were coming to go hear Jesus it was
[10:13] Pharisees and scribes that were there to
[10:15] listen to Jesus as well
[10:17] so keep that in mind that when Jesus
[10:20] gives these the following Parables and
[10:22] then we're going to talk about the The
[10:23] Prodigal Son uh uh and and concentrate
[10:27] on that but when he gives these Parables
[10:30] and when he talks about this he's
[10:32] talking to two different people there at
[10:34] that moment he's talking to the
[10:36] publicans and to Sinners and he's
[10:38] talking to Pharisees and the scribes the
[10:41] ones who thought that they were right
[10:42] the ones who thought that they were
[10:44] correct that you couldn't put anything
[10:46] on them because they followed the law
[10:49] and he was right there talking to also
[10:52] the Sinners and and and and and and
[10:54] publicans and they were there glad to
[10:57] hear him
[10:59] amen so just keep that in mind
[11:01] in verse 3 it says and he spake this
[11:04] Parable unto them saying what man of you
[11:07] having 100 sheep if he lose one of them
[11:09] does not leave the 90 and 9 in the
[11:11] wilderness and go after that which is
[11:14] lost until he find it
[11:16] and when he had found it he layeth it on
[11:19] his shoulders rejoicing
[11:22] and when he cometh home he calleth
[11:24] together his friends and neighbors
[11:27] saying unto them Rejoice with me for I
[11:29] have found my sheep which was lost
[11:32] Hallelujah I say unto you that likewise
[11:35] Joy shall be in heaven over one sinner
[11:37] that repenteth more than over 90 and
[11:41] none just persons which need no
[11:43] repentance
[11:45] and then he continues here with the
[11:46] parable of the lost coin
[11:48] either what woman having 10 pieces of
[11:51] silver if she lose one piece does not
[11:54] light a candle and sweep the house and
[11:57] seek diligently till she find it
[12:00] and when she had found it she called her
[12:03] friends noticed that in both Parables
[12:05] friends are being called rejoicing is
[12:08] done and and seeking is done in order to
[12:11] find what was lost
[12:13] but it's not so in the parable of of the
[12:15] of the of the of the of the uh the the
[12:19] Lost Sun the uh the parable
[12:21] The Prodigal Son
[12:23] and when she had found this she called
[12:26] her friends and her neighbors together
[12:27] saying Rejoice with me for I have found
[12:29] this the peace which I had lost likewise
[12:32] I say unto you there is joy in the
[12:34] presence of the angels of God over one
[12:36] sinner that repented amen over one
[12:39] sinner
[12:40] amen so what did the brother Brandon say
[12:42] one soul is worth ten thousand worlds
[12:45] sometimes us as preachers we get so hard
[12:47] on ourselves because oh we're only
[12:48] preaching to one person and one person
[12:51] is just enough
[12:52] how God wants is just one person with
[12:56] one person he turned the world upside
[12:58] down with Paul with one person he can do
[13:00] more than we can do with a 600 member
[13:02] congregation praise God all he needs is
[13:05] just one person
[13:06] will you be that one person amen I want
[13:09] to be that one person tonight praise the
[13:11] Lord Jesus so let's let's bow our heads
[13:13] our heavenly father we just thank you
[13:15] once again for the opportunity to open
[13:17] back the pages of your word We
[13:19] Appreciate You Lord
[13:20] your word father and Lord I pray that
[13:23] you would just forgive us father for our
[13:25] sins and our iniquities or anything Lord
[13:28] that we may have said done or even
[13:29] thought Lord that was not like you
[13:31] father place it under the blood of Jesus
[13:33] Christ and we pray Lord that you would
[13:35] uh just guide us Lord this evening as we
[13:38] Endeavor to look at some things here in
[13:41] your word father God this is your word
[13:43] Lord you're the one who spoke these
[13:44] Parables Lord and I pray that you'd help
[13:46] us to understand them Lord God let us
[13:49] get in a fuller understanding from your
[13:52] word father than than what we came with
[13:54] it tonight Lord Jesus granted Lord Jesus
[13:57] meet every need amongst us heal every
[13:59] sick one father God and bless Lord those
[14:02] that just made their the effort for the
[14:04] Lord to be here father not to hear a man
[14:07] Lord but to hear you Father the Son of
[14:09] Man would just commit ourselves now into
[14:11] your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen
[14:14] amen God bless you you may be seated
[14:16] appreciate your patience
[14:19] amen
[14:23] all right
[14:25] so
[14:27] I want us to take a look here at at the
[14:30] at the parable of the Prodigal Son
[14:33] because when we when we read the
[14:35] prodigal son we normally concentrate on
[14:37] the part where the prodigal the the
[14:39] younger son leaves the house
[14:41] and comes back and is restored and all
[14:45] that is good and we're going to talk
[14:46] about that but there is an element to
[14:49] the prodigal son or to this to this
[14:51] story
[14:52] which is the the the the the older son
[14:55] that we sometimes overlook
[14:57] and what is would Jesus talks about him
[15:01] in there there's a reason why he talks
[15:03] about him in there and of course it has
[15:05] to do a lot with what the younger son
[15:07] the with the younger son so let's
[15:10] continue reading here in in Luke chapter
[15:12] 15.
[15:14] and uh we're just gonna we're just gonna
[15:15] read and just and just comment as as we
[15:19] read this this evening
[15:21] praise the Lord
[15:23] it says here in verse 11 and he said a
[15:26] certain man had two sons
[15:28] and the younger of them said to his
[15:31] father father give me the portion of
[15:34] goods that followeth to me
[15:38] all right so when when we look here this
[15:41] the younger son is there's there's a
[15:44] portion that is allotted to him now
[15:46] there was an older son
[15:48] and the older son was supposed to get
[15:50] the majority of the portion of what his
[15:52] father what his father what was you know
[15:55] what he was of his estate of his
[15:58] father's estate so the older son he got
[16:01] like two-thirds of of of of that portion
[16:04] while the younger son only got one third
[16:06] so what the younger son is asking for is
[16:09] give me that one-third or give me that
[16:11] portion that belongs to me right and and
[16:14] and and and so he says here give me the
[16:17] portion of goods that falleth to me now
[16:20] during that time if you're just looking
[16:22] if you're if you're looking at at the
[16:25] history of Jewish Jewish history during
[16:27] that time mainly people the way they
[16:30] showed that they had wealth was by the
[16:32] lands that they had the cattle that they
[16:35] had the the the properties that they had
[16:37] that was mainly how they showed how they
[16:39] showed their wealth so you can pretty
[16:43] much think that that the way the way the
[16:47] father was going to give this portion uh
[16:49] to his son was that he needed to go and
[16:52] sell a piece of land or something in
[16:55] order to give him what what what he what
[16:58] what his son what his son required and
[17:01] his father did not deny him that portion
[17:03] man and in order for him to do that
[17:06] normally the father
[17:08] had to die
[17:11] how how else how else are you going to
[17:13] get somebody you know what's what
[17:15] belongs to you in a will if the father
[17:17] does not pass away first right and here
[17:20] is the same thing right
[17:22] but
[17:23] the father without having passed away
[17:26] still goes ahead and gives him what he
[17:29] was he what he's asking for
[17:31] so what the son is really doing if you
[17:33] think about it what the son is really
[17:35] doing is he's wishing that his dad was
[17:37] dead
[17:39] come on think about it
[17:42] what he's really doing is that he's
[17:44] wishing that his dad is dead so that he
[17:46] can go ahead and get that portion
[17:51] and I know sometimes as as as as parents
[17:55] Saints
[17:57] sometimes we we go through hard times
[17:59] and we go and we feel like that's what
[18:02] our children
[18:03] desire of us just because we're trying
[18:06] to train them in the right way that they
[18:07] should go
[18:09] right amen
[18:11] but you know God God is working things
[18:14] amen and God works in mysterious ways
[18:17] praise the Lord
[18:19] and so it says here and he divided unto
[18:23] them
[18:24] and he divided unto them his living
[18:27] and so so the younger son was basically
[18:29] wishing his dad was was dead he wanted
[18:32] he wanted the father's things but he
[18:34] didn't want the father
[18:38] he wanted the father's things but didn't
[18:40] want the father now when you look here
[18:41] at the word at the word here uh uh uh
[18:44] property here in the next well if you
[18:46] read the in the NIV version that this is
[18:48] what the NIV version says the younger
[18:50] one said to his father father give me my
[18:53] share of the estate so he divided his
[18:56] property between them and then when you
[18:59] look at that word property is the word
[19:01] Bion
[19:02] and and it and what it means it's a
[19:05] primary word which means life the
[19:07] present state of existence by
[19:10] implication the means of livelihood
[19:13] so basically what this son is trying to
[19:16] tell his dad then
[19:18] I want you to tear your life apart so
[19:21] that I can get what belongs to me
[19:24] how many of us parents have ever felt
[19:26] that way
[19:29] I want you to just go ahead and just
[19:31] tear yourself apart break break your
[19:34] your status in in society
[19:37] so that you can go ahead and just give
[19:39] me what I desire yeah
[19:42] some of a lot of us would think my
[19:43] goodness that child just needs wow
[19:48] but that's not what the father did
[19:51] now remember the Father Here types our
[19:54] heavenly father you always have to think
[19:57] that yeah and so normally the way we as
[20:00] parents our first reaction but I've
[20:02] always I've always heard this that
[20:05] normally the first reaction the way you
[20:07] react uh the way you want to react to
[20:09] something the first time is usually the
[20:11] wrong way
[20:14] that's probably not the right way to
[20:16] react
[20:17] right
[20:18] because we don't stop and pray about
[20:21] things we don't stop and think about
[20:24] what we should do and normally our our
[20:27] flesh will react in a way that usually
[20:30] leads us wrong
[20:33] so we must work on that
[20:35] amen right but thank God for the holy
[20:37] spirit that helps us Amen to think
[20:41] according to the word and help us react
[20:44] accordingly
[20:46] praise the Lord Jesus
[20:48] well maybe you came to hear something
[20:49] else tonight but this is what you'll
[20:52] hear amen
[20:55] so in those days that the land a man was
[20:58] a man's wealth in those days so what so
[21:00] that the sun was really trying to tear
[21:03] this father apart and the father went
[21:05] ahead and did went out of his way
[21:09] to make sure that his son that he loved
[21:12] so much got what he was gonna what he
[21:15] what he needed amen praise God he
[21:19] literally tore his life apart in order
[21:21] to cater to his son
[21:23] all right
[21:24] amen sometimes I mean I wish I wish
[21:27] somebody our children amen could see
[21:30] amen that you literally amen sometimes
[21:32] sacrifice
[21:34] sacrifice yourself
[21:36] and have sacrificed yourself all your
[21:39] life in order so that they could get the
[21:41] best when and then as they get older
[21:43] amen they they forget all that they
[21:45] don't see that
[21:47] until they have their own children then
[21:49] they realize wow my mom and dad were
[21:51] really trying to amen they actually he
[21:54] bought he bought that bag of Funyuns and
[21:57] he never ate them so that I could have
[21:59] them
[22:00] exactly
[22:02] he he literally did that for me
[22:06] not just using that as an example
[22:07] because we bought a bag of Funyuns this
[22:09] weekend and my wife was asking me
[22:12] where's that bag of Funyuns we never
[22:13] opened them
[22:15] and and we're like where's it at I think
[22:17] we left them at the hotel room
[22:20] Brand New Bag of Funyuns we didn't tip
[22:22] the the the cleaning lady but she got a
[22:24] Brand New Bag of Funyuns though
[22:28] so
[22:30] amen all right let's continue
[22:33] and not many days after the younger son
[22:36] gathered all together and took his
[22:38] journey into a far country
[22:41] now watch what it says here that not
[22:43] many days after that after the sun came
[22:45] to the to the father asking for his
[22:47] inheritance for his one-third portion
[22:50] not many days after that the son the
[22:53] younger son gathered all together and
[22:54] took his journey into a far country and
[22:56] there wasted his substance with riotous
[22:59] living now we're not going to talk about
[23:01] all that he did
[23:03] all that he got involved in maybe he got
[23:06] into a business and was trying to make
[23:08] money and maybe he went out and uh and
[23:11] went and spent it all on prostitutes I I
[23:13] don't know we don't know but that's not
[23:15] the point because whatever he did the
[23:18] father didn't look at that and neither
[23:20] mentioned it to him
[23:21] when he came back
[23:23] that wasn't his concern it was the
[23:25] concern of the older brother but it
[23:26] wasn't the father's concern
[23:28] all right that's not the point amen
[23:32] whatever your children is doing whatever
[23:34] is going on whatever's happening that's
[23:36] between them and God
[23:38] there's nothing that you can do about it
[23:41] hey man you put him in God's hands and
[23:43] leave them there
[23:45] leave it there and God Amen will take
[23:47] care of the rest you just be salty
[23:49] before your children you be salty and
[23:52] you love your children no matter what
[23:54] son daughter I'm here for you I'm here
[23:57] to to to talk I'm here to whenever you

[24:21] amen sometimes we want to give them a
[24:23] PowerPoint presentation about every
[24:25] single point of the things that we've
[24:28] learned in life and in reality that it
[24:30] never lead them to they don't care about
[24:32] that
[24:34] right because they got to have their own
[24:36] experience that was your experience
[24:38] that's not their experience
[24:40] amen they're interested in wanting to
[24:42] have their own experience and sometimes
[24:45] it takes for them to have to go out this
[24:48] way I'm not I don't want them to neither
[24:50] do you but sometimes that's what it
[24:53] takes for them to go out amen and
[24:55] experience what it is amen the Hard
[24:58] Knocks of life
[24:59] amen the the hardships of life oh my I
[25:03] gotta really save money in order to get
[25:06] this and that yeah you do amen and that
[25:09] you don't get things for free forever
[25:13] amen now it's your turn to pay that back
[25:16] for that bag of Funyuns that used to be
[25:19] a dollar ninety nine now it's 3.99
[25:21] because of inflation
[25:24] four bucks yeah
[25:28] yeah now they they're they're they're a
[25:29] little bit more careful now how they
[25:31] spend their money yeah all right
[25:34] praise the Lord
[25:36] and their wasted something without this
[25:38] living when he and when he had spent all
[25:40] the Bible says when he had spent all
[25:44] all the money that he had gotten the one
[25:46] third portion of his father's wealth he
[25:49] spent it all now I don't know how much
[25:52] he how how long it took for him to spend
[25:54] it all he might have spent it in a year
[25:56] might have took him six months might
[25:58] have taken him
[26:00] 10 years amen but he spent it all right
[26:04] and there arose a mighty famine in that
[26:06] land and he began and he began to be in
[26:09] want
[26:10] yeah kind of like we're seeing now
[26:13] amen
[26:15] and he went and joined himself to a
[26:18] citizen of that Country Now I want you
[26:20] to also think that that when as we're
[26:22] reading this you know we're reading in
[26:24] the physical but think about it also in
[26:27] the spiritual
[26:28] yeah because he had spent it all
[26:31] yeah is that we've given it we maybe
[26:33] we've given it all to the world we've
[26:36] done all and there now there's a there's
[26:38] a famine even in the land for for the
[26:40] true word of God
[26:41] that's right I mean the people really
[26:44] want to hear the word of God
[26:46] I mean our young people really want to
[26:48] know what the Bible says not just our
[26:51] opinions and our theories and our and
[26:54] our challenges to each other yeah
[26:57] because that's what it was like a couple
[26:59] of years ago it's just challenging each
[27:01] other and see who knows more about the
[27:03] word of God but that's not what it's all
[27:04] about
[27:05] it that won't change young people that
[27:08] won't give them Holy Ghost and that
[27:10] won't change you
[27:12] amen who knows more than the other about
[27:14] the word who's going to speak the third
[27:15] pool morbidden no that that that that
[27:17] has nothing to do with it amen it's
[27:19] about changing lives it's about about
[27:21] receiving the Holy Ghost
[27:24] praise God
[27:25] it's about living like Christ
[27:28] amen
[27:30] Christ wasn't there to challenge anybody
[27:33] people were challenging him
[27:36] amen
[27:38] praise the Lord
[27:40] and when he had spent all those their
[27:43] Rose of Mighty fowl right we read then
[27:45] and he went and joined himself to a
[27:47] citizen of the country and sent him into
[27:49] his field to feed swine
[27:53] now in those days you know
[27:55] you know for a Jew to be with with with
[27:57] pigs it was a horrible thing
[28:00] they didn't even eat them much less be
[28:03] around them
[28:04] and he would feign and have filled his
[28:08] belly with the hus that the swine did
[28:10] eat and no man gave unto him and when he
[28:13] came to himself and I like what the NIV
[28:15] version says that when he came to his
[28:17] senses yeah and he said how many hard
[28:20] Servants of my fathers have bred enough
[28:22] and to spare and I perish with Hunger I
[28:25] want you to to look at this uh uh
[28:28] parents and I want you to I want you to
[28:30] see that he came to himself
[28:33] right he came to his senses he didn't
[28:37] stay in that condition the whole time
[28:38] right amen he finally came to his senses
[28:41] he finally that word that he received at
[28:44] some point in time in his life amen
[28:46] something sparked in him and he
[28:48] remembered that amen
[28:49] right amen so our children they've heard
[28:52] the word
[28:53] I mean our kids they've heard the word
[28:55] now let that word do a work in them
[28:58] amen amen let that work do a work and
[29:02] then let that word do a work in them
[29:04] because that that will change them from
[29:07] the inside out you see that that was the
[29:10] father wasn't there amen telling the Sun
[29:12] come on get
[29:14] come to yourself come on no finally he
[29:17] sat down when he was in terrible
[29:18] hardship when when everything was gone
[29:21] when he'd spent all his money at
[29:22] prostitutes and there was nowhere for
[29:25] him to even work or anything like that
[29:28] he finally said you know what I need God
[29:34] he finally said I need God
[29:37] I will arise and go to my father now now
[29:41] you notice that he did not say I will go
[29:43] home
[29:45] because his father was his home
[29:49] he he left home but the relationship he
[29:53] broke was with his father
[29:56] right
[29:58] and so he said I will go to my father
[30:00] and I will say unto him father
[30:02] I have sinned against heaven and before
[30:04] thee
[30:06] amen
[30:09] the father was home
[30:11] that was home that was that was what he
[30:13] was missing amen that relationship with
[30:16] his father
[30:20] and and Saints you know home home isn't
[30:23] home isn't just a place
[30:25] it's not a physical location it's not
[30:28] your house that's just that's that's
[30:29] home is a home is a relationship amen
[30:34] home is a relationship that we have with
[30:37] one another my family is my home that's
[30:40] right amen you could take away my house
[30:42] you could take away my cards you could
[30:44] take away everything but if I'm missing
[30:46] my family amen I don't have a home
[30:49] you don't have a home if there if your
[30:51] family is not there
[30:52] and so that's what this sons was saying
[30:55] he said I will go home I will I will
[30:57] rise and go to my father
[30:59] and he was planning his mind while he
[31:01] was going to tell him
[31:02] he was thinking in his mind this is how
[31:04] it's going to be I will say unto him
[31:07] father I have sinned against heaven and
[31:10] before thee amen
[31:13] and I will go home where I'm belong
[31:15] Where I Belong where I'm accepted amen
[31:18] home for us is where we belong and where
[31:21] we're accepted amen home in the word
[31:23] that's where we belong that's where
[31:25] we're accepted in the Beloved amen amen
[31:27] you're never rejected and when when you
[31:29] come with a True Heart
[31:31] praise God hallelujah
[31:33] in verse 20 it says and he arose
[31:36] and came to his father
[31:39] but when he was yet
[31:41] I love that word but
[31:44] but because if there was a problem
[31:46] before but amen there's a resolution
[31:48] after but
[31:51] amen but is a conjunction that that that
[31:53] makes that that that brings a solution
[31:56] afterwards or it could bring a problem
[31:58] too
[31:59] right but it's a conjunction in this
[32:02] case it was a solution but when he was
[32:04] yet a great way off
[32:07] it doesn't say that he was from here to
[32:09] the doors and he was a great way off
[32:13] a great way off
[32:15] amen
[32:17] watch what the father did his father saw
[32:19] him
[32:21] now most of us fathers amen we would
[32:23] probably we'd probably see our son I
[32:25] mean we're probably there working on our
[32:26] car and we and our son did that you know
[32:29] did what he did yeah and we'd probably
[32:31] be there
[32:36] some better have something good to say
[32:40] you better come in here with something
[32:43] good
[32:44] he don't cause all kinds of nonsense in
[32:46] my family he better have something good
[32:49] to say
[32:53] let's see what this boy got to say
[32:56] most of us would probably do that what
[32:58] our fleshly and instinction that's what
[33:01] we would do
[33:02] it right well this this boy did me wrong
[33:06] I
[33:08] might wait until he actually rings the
[33:10] doorbell before I open the door
[33:13] I ain't gonna wait to open the door I'ma
[33:15] wait till he rings the doorbell
[33:17] and as a matter of fact I'm gonna wait
[33:19] until he talks on the doorbell camera
[33:21] before I actually open the door
[33:23] laughs
[33:27] but that's not what the father did
[33:30] look what the father did his father saw
[33:32] him and had compassion
[33:37] all right man and had compassion
[33:41] and watch and ran
[33:45] and ran
[33:46] and fell on his neck
[33:49] and kissed him
[33:52] now remember his son had done already
[33:55] took in one third of his wealth of his
[33:57] estate his land
[33:59] his his status in in in in the in the
[34:02] community
[34:04] that was already gone
[34:06] but the father didn't care not one bit
[34:08] about that
[34:10] while he was concerned and why he loved
[34:13] most is that his son was returning
[34:16] now I I was looking at this part right
[34:19] here where he talks about that he ran
[34:21] and it's very interested in in Jewish
[34:24] tradition amen because why did he run
[34:28] Jesus brings in there why did he run
[34:31] and there's a reason why now according
[34:34] to the talmud
[34:36] there is a ceremony performed that's
[34:38] called the kizazza
[34:41] all right now this is what this ceremony
[34:43] is
[34:45] if a Jewish son married a gentile woman
[34:48] or he lost his inheritance among
[34:51] gentiles
[34:53] and then returned home the family and
[34:56] the community would perform a ceremony
[34:59] called the kazaza
[35:02] they would break a large pot of fruit in
[35:05] front of him and yell you are now cut
[35:08] off from your people
[35:10] the community would totally reject him
[35:14] not just the community but the family as
[35:16] well
[35:18] amen
[35:19] so what the father did basically because
[35:22] in those days the a man you know with
[35:25] this book because we see that this
[35:26] father he was a man of status
[35:28] he had money
[35:30] all right he was and his garments you
[35:33] know a man you know children ran back
[35:35] then
[35:36] maybe a woman or girls you know they
[35:38] might run back then but a man of that
[35:40] status a man back then didn't run
[35:43] especially man of that status
[35:45] because they would be showing their
[35:47] their legs and it was just embarrassing
[35:49] for them to have to pick up their skirts
[35:51] to be running everywhere you know so a
[35:53] man didn't run it was it was it was kind
[35:55] of like a shameful thing but this father
[35:57] didn't care about that
[35:59] this father picked up his Curts and ran
[36:01] to his son
[36:03] amen amen
[36:06] and and watch what he did he met him
[36:10] outside of that Village outside because
[36:13] he saw him from far off he met him
[36:15] outside before he come into the city
[36:17] because he knew that if he would get to
[36:19] him first before the village would get
[36:21] to him
[36:22] then he could restore him and he'd bring
[36:25] him to his home nobody would know but
[36:28] then once the people and the people in
[36:29] the community would know that the father
[36:31] restored him
[36:34] right they couldn't perform the ceremony
[36:36] this kazaza ceremony because why the
[36:39] father had already made the choice to
[36:41] restore him amen they think about that
[36:47] so I like it because the Bible you know
[36:49] Jesus gives these little these little
[36:51] things and he ran and and fell on his
[36:54] neck and just these little things
[36:55] they're there for a purpose
[36:58] so so the father basically he
[37:00] embarrassed himself
[37:02] he embarrassed himself Amen in order to
[37:04] go
[37:06] restore his son
[37:10] amen
[37:12] by lifting up his skirts in public and
[37:14] showing his legs
[37:16] in order to get to his son first amen
[37:22] the father was not interested at all and
[37:25] publicly shaming his son
[37:29] he didn't care about him being
[37:31] embarrassed he just didn't want his son
[37:33] to be embarrassed
[37:36] I wonder let that sink in parents
[37:40] you shame your your children in public
[37:43] that's not the attitude of this father
[37:47] that's not he was trying to protect his
[37:49] son who deserved all kinds of of of of
[37:53] of of
[37:54] uh of uh you know punishment
[37:58] of rejection
[38:00] yet the father does everything to
[38:03] protect his child
[38:05] isn't that what we're supposed to do as
[38:06] parents
[38:09] we protect our children no matter what
[38:11] the cost we don't shame them whatsoever
[38:15] because in general later on that's gonna
[38:17] hurt them more than to help them
[38:20] just think about that
[38:22] amen
[38:23] in verse 21 it says and the son said
[38:25] unto him father I have sinned against
[38:28] heaven
[38:30] and in thy sight and I'm no more worthy
[38:33] to be called thy son
[38:35] amen
[38:37] this is what the sun said
[38:40] this is how he felt
[38:42] praise God
[38:44] and so what the son was trying to do
[38:45] here is what the son was trying to earn
[38:47] his way back to the family
[38:50] but the father didn't want him tearing
[38:52] his way back
[38:54] that's what the father was not
[38:55] interested in earning his way back
[38:58] he said I'll I'll make sure yeah to do
[39:01] it for you
[39:03] hey man watch what verse 22 says but the
[39:05] father said to his servants bring forth
[39:08] the best robe
[39:10] and put it on him
[39:13] and put a ring on his hand
[39:15] and shoes on his feet
[39:18] amen
[39:20] praise God
[39:24] he wanted him to have the best
[39:27] no matter what he had done no matter
[39:29] what he had gone through no matter how
[39:32] much of his father how much his son had
[39:34] embarrassed him he wanted him to get he
[39:37] wanted to give him the best
[39:40] see the father wanted to let his son
[39:42] know that he was going to be in charge
[39:44] of fully restoring him now this is kind
[39:46] of like a
[39:48] it's kind of like a process of adoption
[39:51] amen if you think about it and what does
[39:53] the road represent it's a robe of
[39:55] righteousness
[39:56] right
[39:57] a ring gay man the ring had the father's
[40:01] seal on it a man of that status back
[40:04] then had a certain seal it was a family
[40:06] seal on that ring
[40:08] And that son amen was he he didn't
[40:11] deserve that but the father gave him
[40:13] that ring and not only that he told his
[40:16] servants of the house come and put that
[40:18] ring on my on my son
[40:20] and also come and put that robe on my
[40:22] son
[40:23] amen
[40:25] a verb of righteousness a ring with the
[40:28] father's seal and shoes
[40:31] yeah amen which means that he was
[40:32] prepared and ready
[40:36] praise God
[40:38] he was prepared and ready now maybe the
[40:40] son may not felt that way
[40:43] but some probably didn't feel that way
[40:44] he was probably still I can't believe my
[40:46] dad is doing this to me
[40:48] I can't believe I can't believe this is
[40:51] happening to me when I'm supposed to he
[40:53] wanted to work for his dad in order to
[40:56] pay him back what he what he lost he
[40:58] didn't even want to be his son
[41:00] but the father wasn't interested in him
[41:01] he said no you're not going to be like
[41:03] one of my hired servants you're going to
[41:05] be my son because you are my son and let
[41:08] me publicly demonstrate that you are my
[41:11] son you're not going to you're not going
[41:14] to serve me you're going to be served
[41:17] amen hence the reason why he told his
[41:20] servants Amen to go and place these
[41:23] things on him amen
[41:28] parents I don't want you to think that
[41:31] your child is gone
[41:33] yeah amen
[41:37] he or she they're only getting prepared
[41:40] amen for for
[41:42] what's coming ahead for them that's
[41:44] right amen I like that song that brother
[41:46] Michael sang last time amen he's there
[41:49] just working on their testimony
[41:53] he is only working on his testimony amen
[41:57] she is only working on her testimony
[41:59] amen there have they have to go through
[42:01] something in order for there to be a
[42:03] testimony there has to be a test
[42:06] in order for there to be a testimony
[42:09] praise the Lord Jesus
[42:12] father here wasn't concerned about
[42:14] anything that the son had done
[42:17] now remember
[42:18] Jesus is the one telling this this this
[42:20] this Parable here and the father
[42:23] represents
[42:25] the heavenly father
[42:27] so how much should you and us you you
[42:30] and I
[42:32] parents should be with our children
[42:37] gracious
[42:39] oh we're gracious with everybody else
[42:41] but we're not with our own children
[42:43] well our own children well we treat them
[42:45] any old way
[42:47] hit them upside the head shame them and
[42:49] do all kinds of stuff but we'll show
[42:51] Grace to everybody else
[42:55] you're you're breaking the word
[42:57] you're breaking the attitude of this
[43:00] father
[43:03] because
[43:04] as Jesus is telling this here to us amen
[43:07] he's trying to show us he's trying to
[43:09] show us a relationship issues issues
[43:11] that are going on between parents family
[43:13] members and and and and and and and and
[43:15] so we need to look at it that way amen
[43:21] all the different aspects
[43:23] amen all right verse 23 and bring hither
[43:27] the fatted calf and kill it and let us
[43:30] eat and be merry
[43:33] this is the father continuing
[43:37] the gifts for the for the for the son
[43:39] for the son that didn't deserve it for
[43:42] the son that spent all his living for
[43:44] the son that was in sin and everything
[43:47] here he brings in the fatter calf now
[43:50] the fatter calf is when you look in the
[43:52] scriptures is only killed and eaten only
[43:56] on special occasions
[44:00] only on special occasions they would
[44:03] they would let set aside a little calf
[44:05] atten him up over time and when a
[44:07] special occasion came I mean it had to
[44:09] be a real special occasion
[44:11] they would take that fatted calf
[44:14] and kill it and eat it share and they
[44:17] would invite the whole Community I mean
[44:19] it was a it was a Throwdown yeah
[44:21] yeah it was a party of parties
[44:24] because it was expensive during that
[44:26] during that time people the the Jews
[44:28] back then they didn't eat a lot of meat
[44:31] right right and if they did eat meat
[44:34] they would they would you know they
[44:36] would find the the you know how we we
[44:37] look at Walmart you know we're looking
[44:39] for the the cheapest meat now you know
[44:41] yeah the the ground beef you know ground
[44:44] beef you're looking at you know it's now
[44:46] uh what is it uh as seven sixty is 70
[44:50] fat you know six seventy twenty or
[44:53] whatever you know that I think that the
[44:55] more fat it has the the cheaper it is
[44:58] right yeah like sister and said it's
[45:01] supposed to be
[45:02] eventually they're gonna make us eat
[45:04] bugs
[45:06] just just see what what Bill Gates is
[45:08] saying about that
[45:09] yeah and you don't you don't believe me
[45:11] you think that's just a conspiracy
[45:12] theory they talk publicly about it
[45:15] about eating bugs and feeling it they're
[45:17] feeding it to children now at schools
[45:20] and they're using Hollywood stars to
[45:22] promote it too yeah yeah I just hope
[45:24] that we're out before that
[45:28] amen
[45:32] yeah
[45:35] but the fatted calf amen they it was for
[45:38] a special occasion and this is what the
[45:40] father was asking to be done for this
[45:44] most disobedient
[45:45] unworthy
[45:47] unfaithful
[45:49] unjust sinner boy
[45:53] who didn't deserve nothing
[45:56] this is what the father was asking him
[45:58] but you know what you know sometimes we
[46:01] think of people that way and you forget
[46:03] where you came from
[46:07] amen you forget where the things you did
[46:11] when you were younger
[46:12] the sins that you committed and yet you
[46:15] were received by people yeah and most
[46:19] importantly by God
[46:24] for this my son was dead and there's a
[46:26] live again
[46:28] he was lost
[46:30] and is found
[46:31] and they begin to be sad
[46:36] doesn't say that doesn't
[46:38] I began to be married
[46:40] amen and this my son was dead now we we
[46:43] see here that he wasn't physically dead
[46:46] but he was spiritually dead which is
[46:48] what the father was saying and is alive
[46:50] again
[46:52] amen praise God
[46:54] now watch so we see here that that Jesus
[46:57] is talking about the the stops talking
[46:59] about the younger son and you think that
[47:01] maybe everything is is done maybe the
[47:04] family's restored back and and uh
[47:07] everybody is happy and they lived
[47:09] happily ever after
[47:11] without one-third of the father's uh
[47:13] portion of course but that didn't matter
[47:15] to the father you know
[47:17] that didn't matter because all he cared
[47:19] was that his son was back
[47:21] right
[47:22] but it wasn't that way
[47:25] and in act two
[47:29] right an actor you know how in stories
[47:31] they have Acts this is that was act one
[47:34] now in act two
[47:36] man amen Jesus continues he says now
[47:40] his Elder son was in the field
[47:47] and as he came and Drew nigh to the
[47:51] house
[47:52] he heard music and dancing
[47:56] I mean they was throwing down up in
[47:57] there
[47:59] it was it was a it was a I mean they had
[48:02] a party
[48:04] she talking about
[48:06] man it was it was good food
[48:08] it was good music it was good Fellowship
[48:11] everything was good
[48:14] but the Father the Son wasn't there the
[48:16] older son wasn't there
[48:18] and verse 26 says and he called one of
[48:20] the servants
[48:22] the son did and asked what those things
[48:25] meant
[48:26] in other words he asked him he said hey
[48:28] what's going on in there
[48:30] now
[48:33] his son was in the field
[48:35] and maybe he was maybe several days
[48:38] working I don't know maybe he was he was
[48:40] but there seems to be a disconnect there
[48:43] with the family
[48:45] because he should have known that his
[48:47] son his brother had returned right right
[48:50] because I don't think that that happened
[48:53] killing the fatted calf and and putting
[48:55] the ring on the finger and all that
[48:57] stuff happened in within within an hour
[48:59] yeah
[49:00] yeah it probably took several days
[49:04] so where was this brother
[49:07] there was some sort of Disconnect in the
[49:10] family already on from his part
[49:14] there was something already building up
[49:16] in him towards his father
[49:19] that he didn't like right oh come on
[49:28] and we got to be careful hey man with
[49:30] the little things this is the little
[49:32] foxes that spoil the vine
[49:34] little things that build up over time
[49:38] and it's usually the ones within the
[49:39] family
[49:40] that we started we have issues with
[49:43] ones within the family
[49:46] and this is what happened here and this
[49:48] is what was happening here with his son
[49:50] things were building up with with the
[49:52] father
[49:53] things were building up
[49:55] and he called one of his servants and
[49:57] asked what these things meant and he
[49:59] said unto him thy brother is come the
[50:01] servant was telling him that brother has
[50:02] come
[50:03] and thy father hath killed the fatted
[50:06] calf
[50:08] because he hath received him safe and
[50:11] sound Amen in other words he told him
[50:13] the good news
[50:15] and isn't that good news
[50:18] that's wonderful news
[50:21] but that's not how the son received it
[50:24] right now in order for his son to
[50:27] receive it in in the way that he says it
[50:29] here in verse 28 something must have
[50:31] been already gnawing in him
[50:35] and he was angry look at the look at the
[50:38] attitude of his son
[50:40] and he was angry and would not go in
[50:46] so now the younger son had already
[50:48] assaulted the family so now it was the
[50:51] turn of the older son now to assault the
[50:53] family it was his chance to assault the
[50:56] family now
[50:59] therefore came his father out and
[51:02] entreated him
[51:04] now I want you to pay attention to that
[51:06] because the father did to his older son
[51:09] exactly what he did to his younger son
[51:12] he didn't wait till his older son went
[51:14] to him amen he came to his older son
[51:17] to try to talk with him when he found
[51:20] out that his son had that attitude and
[51:22] wasn't in there in the festivities and
[51:25] and in the rejoicing of what was going
[51:28] on he was he was worried he was
[51:30] concerned and he went looking for his
[51:33] older son found him outside like this
[51:41] foreign
[51:49] my father's the fathers one-third of a
[51:53] portion spent it all in harlots did
[51:55] everything or that and now they're using
[51:57] my portion to give this this boy a party
[52:02] [Music]
[52:03] yeah
[52:04] this is exactly what he was thinking is
[52:07] that right they're using my portion in
[52:09] other words he was not concerned about
[52:11] his father being happy about his younger
[52:14] brother coming in he was concerned just
[52:16] like his younger son he was concerned
[52:19] also about getting what he could get out
[52:21] of his father but not about the father
[52:23] himself
[52:25] I wonder if we're that way
[52:28] if we are because let me tell you this
[52:31] son the oldest son did everything he was
[52:33] supposed to do he was good he went to
[52:37] church got there 30 minutes on time
[52:39] prayed made sure that his mom and dad
[52:42] saw that he got to church on time made
[52:45] sure everything I mean he was but his
[52:48] heart was not in the right place
[52:50] right right yeah
[52:53] after that he did everything right
[52:57] so you could do everything right for the
[52:59] wrong reasons right
[53:03] and you can do everything wrong
[53:05] as well just like the younger son
[53:08] but this shows me and this is what Jesus
[53:11] is trying to show us that they both
[53:13] needed repentance they both needed God
[53:18] one wasn't better than the other one
[53:20] one wasn't wasn't higher than the other
[53:23] one just because they were able to do
[53:25] everything amen some of us come in here
[53:27] I mean sometimes running 30 30 40
[53:29] minutes late amen some of you all get
[53:31] here on time that doesn't make you
[53:33] better than somebody else
[53:35] amen
[53:36] because God knows your heart
[53:39] God knows what's really in your heart
[53:41] why why you do things and why why what's
[53:44] the purpose of you doing things to be
[53:46] seen
[53:48] or do you really want a relationship
[53:50] with God
[53:54] I want y'all to think about that in
[53:56] light of this story
[53:59] what's the purpose of you doing things
[54:02] that you do
[54:04] is it to be seen and please those around
[54:06] you
[54:08] or is it to please God
[54:12] amen
[54:15] and he was angry and would not go in
[54:19] therefore came his father out
[54:21] and entreated him
[54:24] he talked to his son
[54:27] amen his son this son what he was saying
[54:30] in his heart was I will not be part of
[54:32] this family I'm the heir and I don't
[54:34] want to be in the same family with my
[54:36] brother in it
[54:39] that's what he was saying
[54:41] that's why he wouldn't come in
[54:45] so the father came to him
[54:47] just as just as he went to the to the
[54:50] younger son amen it's always God seeking
[54:53] us
[54:54] amen we're never seeking God
[54:57] there's always God seeking us looking
[55:00] for us
[55:01] because he he's concerned about
[55:03] relationships
[55:05] he he doesn't care about your do's and
[55:07] your don'ts and what you do or don't do
[55:10] that's good
[55:11] but but he wants your heart first
[55:14] where is your heart
[55:16] that's what's more concerning about to
[55:19] him
[55:20] because you could do every single thing
[55:22] just right
[55:24] and your heart be in the wrong place I
[55:27] ain't gonna help you in life
[55:30] they won't help you even with the people
[55:31] at church with your family
[55:33] eventually you will show what's really
[55:36] in your heart
[55:37] at the right time the right moment comes
[55:40] and the right things happen
[55:42] you will eventually show what's in your
[55:44] heart
[55:44] [Music]
[55:49] so
[55:51] make sure that your heart is right
[55:53] amen because out of the abundance of the
[55:56] heart speaks the mouth out of the
[55:58] abundance of the heart Jesus said is
[56:00] what you will do
[56:01] amen
[56:03] and he answering
[56:07] and so I I wanted I wanted to show this
[56:10] that that Jesus says here that the
[56:13] father didn't treat one son differently
[56:15] than the other
[56:17] there was no preferential treatment
[56:19] there
[56:21] yeah isn't that what we're seeing
[56:26] all right so it's not it's not good
[56:27] parents oh my God
[56:29] I better be careful when I tread on this
[56:33] but it's not good parents we treat one
[56:36] child better than the other
[56:39] that's not going to lead anywhere good
[56:42] look what happened with Jacob
[56:46] they did
[56:49] and look what happened to his family
[56:53] so don't give preferential treatments
[56:55] treat them just the same love them just
[56:58] the same they have a soul just as much
[57:01] as all your other children do
[57:04] they need God just as much as your older
[57:07] one does or your younger one does
[57:10] they need God
[57:17] you know I wanna I wanna let my children
[57:19] know that I love them just the same
[57:22] and we know our children we know that
[57:24] sometimes some of our children they they
[57:26] they're different
[57:28] I mean
[57:30] you know with with with with
[57:32] Bella you know we we have to be a little
[57:34] tougher on her
[57:36] a little bit you know more
[57:39] she was a little bit more hard-headed
[57:40] more strong-willed
[57:42] right
[57:43] yeah and I think she's learned
[57:46] with Zoe
[57:48] all we have to do is just look at her
[57:52] and just kind of
[57:56] and I mean she was crying
[57:58] I didn't have to pull my belt off I
[58:01] didn't have to do anything amen and yes
[58:03] because of that reason she did not get
[58:06] as much spanking and as Bella has told
[58:08] us this
[58:10] foreign
[58:12] she did not get much spanking but it was
[58:14] because we knew that that's what worked
[58:17] for her
[58:18] right right
[58:20] so you know your own children
[58:22] you know how you can deal with one to
[58:24] the other amen
[58:25] but don't do one thing for the other and
[58:28] not for the other one they both are
[58:29] doing the exact same thing
[58:32] they're both causing the same problem I
[58:34] have the same attitude but yet you
[58:35] prefer one over the other that's wrong
[58:38] that's wrong
[58:40] that's not teaching neither of your
[58:42] children anything right and it's it's
[58:45] wrong before the eyes of God
[58:49] and he answered in verse 29 and he
[58:51] answered and said to his father Lo
[58:53] watch what this older son says hello
[58:57] and when you read this here in in in in
[58:59] the NIV version this verse 29 look he
[59:01] says but he answered his father look
[59:04] all these years I've been slaving for
[59:06] you and never disobeyed your orders
[59:11] he doesn't even call him father at least
[59:13] the younger son called him father
[59:15] even though he went out into the world
[59:18] and did everything he still had some
[59:20] sort of respect and called him father
[59:21] this older son right here you could tell
[59:23] that he already had something with his
[59:25] dad that he wasn't liking and he tells
[59:28] him low
[59:29] doesn't even call him father Lo these
[59:31] many years do I serve thee neither
[59:33] transgress Ayah any time that
[59:35] commandment I was a good boy
[59:37] I was a good daughter
[59:42] and yet thou never gave us me a kid
[59:45] that I might make Mary a kid
[59:48] that I might make Merry with my friends
[59:53] but watch what he continues saying his
[59:55] bad attitude I mean he was obedient son
[59:58] did everything good but he has this bad
[1:00:01] attitude why because it was coming from
[1:00:02] his heart
[1:00:04] it was hiding in there all these years
[1:00:07] and eventually at the right moment it
[1:00:10] came out that's right
[1:00:12] it eventually it came out but as soon as
[1:00:15] this thy son was come
[1:00:17] so he don't even call him his brother
[1:00:20] as soon as this my brother he didn't say
[1:00:22] that no he said as soon as this thy son
[1:00:24] in the NIV version says when this son of
[1:00:26] yours who has squandered your property
[1:00:29] with prostitutes comes home you kill the
[1:00:32] fattest calf for him
[1:00:35] he's concerned about his own estate his
[1:00:37] own well-being not even concerned at all
[1:00:39] what his dad is feeling for his younger
[1:00:42] son coming home
[1:00:46] matters of the heart
[1:00:49] right here it's matters of the heart you
[1:00:52] can hide it all you want for many years
[1:00:55] eventually the right thing will happen
[1:00:57] and it'll bring it out of you
[1:01:00] just let it happen here to this older
[1:01:02] son
[1:01:04] you just wait
[1:01:06] is it all my child will never do that my
[1:01:09] child you just wait until the right
[1:01:11] moment comes
[1:01:13] whatever was hiding in there in their
[1:01:15] heart that's what eventually come out if
[1:01:18] they haven't gotten God
[1:01:20] I mean they'll play the part for years
[1:01:22] and you know what I'm not exempt from
[1:01:24] that either I'm not saying I'm you know
[1:01:27] my children will never do these things
[1:01:29] amen that's between them and God
[1:01:32] I've given them amen I've told them you
[1:01:35] you got to have your own relationship
[1:01:37] with God
[1:01:38] I can't always be there supervising
[1:01:40] every single thing that you do
[1:01:43] amen God knows
[1:01:45] but I know that that word amen that
[1:01:48] God's put in your heart amen that that
[1:01:50] we have preached for years amen that's
[1:01:53] the word that's going to change you
[1:01:55] right
[1:01:57] I can't change you Mommy can't change
[1:01:59] you hey man the pastor can't change you
[1:02:02] the preacher at the Youth Camp can't
[1:02:04] change you it's got to be the word of
[1:02:05] God Amen that changes you amen and when
[1:02:09] that change takes place that's a that's
[1:02:11] an enduring change
[1:02:14] hey man that will last
[1:02:15] do you think that this young son amen he
[1:02:18] left the house again
[1:02:20] after all the grace that he was shown
[1:02:23] after all that he had done
[1:02:26] doesn't say
[1:02:28] but we are just assuming that he did
[1:02:32] right because the father let God be God
[1:02:36] amen you
[1:02:39] th areas the father just let God do the
[1:02:41] work
[1:02:42] and God took care of the rest amen
[1:02:46] amen so he says here but as soon as this
[1:02:48] dark sound was come which I devoured thy
[1:02:50] living with harlots he start he's the
[1:02:52] one who starts naming his sins
[1:02:56] look what you look what he does I mean
[1:02:58] isn't that what we sometimes do we keep
[1:03:00] record of what people do at church
[1:03:03] I mean we make sure we write it down too
[1:03:06] I mean it's in a notepad somewhere
[1:03:11] came in 30 minutes late
[1:03:13] oh Wednesday
[1:03:16] came with his shoes untied
[1:03:19] um
[1:03:21] I mean we just keep track of it
[1:03:25] when the father God himself wasn't doing
[1:03:28] that
[1:03:29] didn't even mention it to his son
[1:03:34] well the word of God is still the word
[1:03:36] of God
[1:03:37] amen
[1:03:40] amen so this brother refuses to
[1:03:42] acknowledge his brother as part of the
[1:03:44] family
[1:03:46] this brother was mad
[1:03:49] that his father was using his
[1:03:51] inheritance in a way that he didn't
[1:03:54] approve of
[1:03:55] because because that was his inheritance
[1:03:58] that fatted calf was part of that older
[1:04:00] brother's inheritance
[1:04:02] it belonged to him
[1:04:03] maybe belonged to his dad because he was
[1:04:06] still alive he wasn't going to get that
[1:04:07] fatted calf until he died
[1:04:09] but it still belonged to him so so when
[1:04:13] the dad tells him and he said unto him
[1:04:15] son
[1:04:17] now the the he wasn't called father by
[1:04:19] his son but his father calls him son
[1:04:24] he says son
[1:04:25] ever with me
[1:04:28] and all that I have is done I mean that
[1:04:31] was literally true
[1:04:33] remember he didn't have the one-third
[1:04:35] portion anymore because his son his
[1:04:37] younger son had already spent it
[1:04:39] so that was gone but that wasn't even in
[1:04:41] his dad father's mind
[1:04:43] the two-thirds portion that was there
[1:04:45] was belonged to his older son
[1:04:48] so when he told him son everything that
[1:04:50] you have everything that that I have is
[1:04:53] yours that was literally true
[1:04:56] when I die everything that I have
[1:04:59] everything that you see now it belongs
[1:05:01] to you
[1:05:04] it says and all that I have is done
[1:05:09] it was meat that we should make Mary in
[1:05:11] other words it was important that we
[1:05:12] should make Mary and be glad for this
[1:05:15] thy brother he he tells him that this is
[1:05:17] your brother
[1:05:19] he didn't say he's this thy son look
[1:05:21] what he did but now his father tells him
[1:05:24] this thy brother remember he's your
[1:05:26] brother
[1:05:29] remember she's your sister he's your
[1:05:33] brother watch how you treat your brother
[1:05:34] and your sister
[1:05:36] all right
[1:05:39] remember
[1:05:40] he was dead
[1:05:42] and there's a love again
[1:05:44] and was lost and is found
[1:05:49] and Jesus stops right there
[1:05:52] leaves us with a cliffhanger almost
[1:05:56] and leaves you guessing
[1:05:58] what happens next
[1:06:00] leaves you to your imagination to think
[1:06:03] what's going to happen next what happens
[1:06:05] does the brother get restored with his
[1:06:08] with his younger brother the older and
[1:06:10] things you know
[1:06:12] and move on for the common cause of the
[1:06:15] family for the common cause of of of of
[1:06:18] of of of of the work amen
[1:06:21] or does he just leave
[1:06:25] separating and severing severing more
[1:06:29] of the family amen
[1:06:32] so I want you to think about this in the
[1:06:34] last few minutes that were there that
[1:06:36] we're
[1:06:36] that we have
[1:06:38] that Jesus amen he was he remember he
[1:06:40] was talking to publicans and he was
[1:06:43] talking to sinners
[1:06:44] all right the publicans and the Sinners
[1:06:47] represent the younger son
[1:06:50] right
[1:06:52] the older son is represented by the by
[1:06:55] the old uh uh by the Pharisees
[1:06:58] man how do you think those Pharisees
[1:07:00] felt when he was tucking those things
[1:07:02] because this story wasn't just a
[1:07:05] feel-good story that you so that you can
[1:07:07] boohoo and cry the old younger son came
[1:07:10] back with it that's good and that's part
[1:07:11] of it
[1:07:13] but he was trying to make a point and
[1:07:15] you sometimes think you sometimes think
[1:07:17] Jesus is just all about love and he's
[1:07:20] just all about no he he's about publicly
[1:07:23] shaming people when they need to be
[1:07:25] publicly shamed
[1:07:27] all right sure
[1:07:28] yeah yeah all right bro when it's
[1:07:31] deservant
[1:07:33] of it
[1:07:36] because this is what this is the the
[1:07:38] Pharisees were a bunch of Hypocrites
[1:07:41] see in their mind they're thinking that
[1:07:44] they're good works and everything they
[1:07:45] felt like they were slaves to God
[1:07:49] and that God was just their master
[1:07:51] and and they and if they just did
[1:07:54] everything exactly by the law everything
[1:07:58] amen that they would get in
[1:08:00] but see in reality they were trying to
[1:08:03] be their own savior
[1:08:05] and not depending on God the savior
[1:08:09] they were thinking that they were
[1:08:10] dependent on God the Savior but in their
[1:08:13] attitude of their heart by their works
[1:08:15] and by the things that they were doing
[1:08:16] and and the disgust that they had for
[1:08:19] the for the publicans and the Sinners
[1:08:21] and the prostitutes and everything like
[1:08:23] that amen you see from the heart speaks
[1:08:26] the mouth Jesus said
[1:08:29] so see from their heart God knew where
[1:08:32] their heart was even though that they
[1:08:33] did exactly everything
[1:08:35] they had the exact the long hair exactly
[1:08:38] the way they did they were the
[1:08:40] phylacteries everything amen and you
[1:08:42] couldn't put one thing on them
[1:08:46] physically you couldn't Jesus could amen
[1:08:49] because he knew their heart
[1:08:52] and God knows your heart
[1:08:56] God knows your heart so here the older
[1:08:58] son is represented by these Pharisees
[1:09:00] and these the older son he worked hard
[1:09:03] for his dad he'd obeyed him he did
[1:09:05] everything amen but in the end
[1:09:07] there was a heart problem there yeah
[1:09:14] now the younger brother he was trying to
[1:09:16] obtain the father's wealth by by
[1:09:18] breaking the rules
[1:09:22] he was forcibly asking his dad give me
[1:09:25] what I did what I did by breaking the
[1:09:27] rule by being a bad son
[1:09:30] and God gave it to him his father gave
[1:09:32] him what he was
[1:09:35] while the older son was trying to obtain
[1:09:38] the father's wealth by being good
[1:09:41] and then doing what he was supposed to
[1:09:43] do
[1:09:44] but both of their hearts were not for
[1:09:46] the father
[1:09:48] those are their hearts were for material
[1:09:50] things and external things
[1:09:53] amen
[1:09:56] I like silence
[1:09:59] silence is good
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:08] both both needed God just the same
[1:10:12] that's what Jesus is trying to tell us
[1:10:15] both needed God just the same
[1:10:17] your good works ain't gonna get you in
[1:10:20] your obedience to your parents all your
[1:10:22] life and and and and your and you come
[1:10:25] in 30 minutes early to church that's
[1:10:27] good and that's what we need to do that
[1:10:29] I'm not trying to say we don't do that
[1:10:30] but that won't help you
[1:10:32] in the long run if your heart's not
[1:10:34] right
[1:10:38] so the older brother was thinking that
[1:10:40] he was getting in by his Works was
[1:10:41] looking down at the younger brother who
[1:10:43] was needing Grace
[1:10:45] that's what the Pharisees were doing
[1:10:47] with the Republicans and the sinners
[1:10:49] looking down on them when
[1:10:52] when they when they needed Grace
[1:10:55] amen
[1:10:57] and I want you to I want you to look at
[1:10:59] this because what the older brother
[1:11:00] should have done
[1:11:02] if if the older brother really loved his
[1:11:05] brother his younger brother the way he
[1:11:07] should what he should have done is that
[1:11:09] when the older brother went out
[1:11:11] the older brother should have gone he
[1:11:13] said that
[1:11:14] don't worry I'm gonna go out and look
[1:11:16] for him
[1:11:19] I'm gonna go out and seek him I don't
[1:11:22] care what is going to cost me
[1:11:24] I don't care if it cost me all my
[1:11:26] inheritance
[1:11:29] I'm gonna find him
[1:11:31] because that's my brother that's my
[1:11:33] flesh and blood
[1:11:34] that's that's part of me just as much as
[1:11:37] it's part of you
[1:11:40] but that's not what the older brother
[1:11:42] did
[1:11:43] the other brother had already had maybe
[1:11:45] some sort of Vendetta towards his
[1:11:47] towards his younger brother
[1:11:51] and towards his dad because all he was
[1:11:53] thinking was about himself amen
[1:11:57] and isn't that what Jesus did for us
[1:12:01] remember he is our Kinsmen Redeemer
[1:12:04] he he our older brother yeah that's what
[1:12:08] he did
[1:12:09] he came looking for us he came seeking
[1:12:12] us he came he gave up his throne of
[1:12:15] Glory he gave up his inheritance he gave
[1:12:18] up everything that he had amen the peace
[1:12:21] and everything in order to come find you
[1:12:24] amen
[1:12:26] in order to come find you because you
[1:12:29] were the younger son
[1:12:31] you were the one who needed restoration
[1:12:33] you were the one who were out spending
[1:12:35] money with it with harlots and and and
[1:12:37] and and and overspending and spending
[1:12:39] and living living righteously
[1:12:43] and he knew that
[1:12:45] and yet he still came for you
[1:12:49] what a great older brother we have
[1:12:53] once I have an older brother like that
[1:12:55] amen
[1:12:57] well you you and me have him
[1:13:00] our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:13:03] amen amen
[1:13:05] I never had a brother
[1:13:07] I always say I grew up with women in my
[1:13:10] in my household all the all of my life
[1:13:13] it's not a bad thing don't get me wrong
[1:13:17] you know I grew up with two sisters
[1:13:19] my mom my dad he worked third shift a
[1:13:23] lot so I was the one who was in charge
[1:13:25] of the house pretty much
[1:13:27] Tom was always around women and girls
[1:13:30] all the time
[1:13:32] and now is the same thing
[1:13:34] [Laughter]
[1:13:36] it was like God was training me
[1:13:41] I mean I have my wife I have my two
[1:13:43] daughters and even our dog is a female
[1:13:45] [Laughter]
[1:13:48] surrounded
[1:13:50] but you know what I wouldn't I wouldn't
[1:13:52] change it for anything else because I
[1:13:55] know that was my portion
[1:13:56] God prepared me for that amen
[1:13:59] amen amen
[1:14:00] maybe with a son I wouldn't be able to
[1:14:02] handle him
[1:14:04] but see God gave you a son because he
[1:14:06] knows that you could handle it
[1:14:08] all right
[1:14:10] praise the Lord Jesus
[1:14:13] amen
[1:14:15] so he became our Kinsmen Redeemer amen
[1:14:18] he became me
[1:14:19] that I might become him by grace
[1:14:23] that's what the older brother should
[1:14:24] have done he should have become amen
[1:14:27] what his younger son was going through
[1:14:28] in order just to win him
[1:14:31] that's what Jesus did
[1:14:33] and so see Jesus there speaking to the
[1:14:36] Pharisees and to the publicans and the
[1:14:37] Sinners amen I'm sure the publicans and
[1:14:40] the Sinners were just receiving that
[1:14:41] word
[1:14:43] and so you wonder you know how did the
[1:14:46] story end
[1:14:51] because Jesus Lives leaves us there with
[1:14:52] a cliffhanger you know
[1:14:55] you wonder how did things happen what
[1:14:57] what happened if the older son
[1:14:59] represented the Pharisees
[1:15:02] what did the Pharisees end up doing to
[1:15:04] Jesus
[1:15:10] so
[1:15:11] maybe that was the way the story ended
[1:15:14] up in the family I don't know
[1:15:17] but I'm so glad that we have an older
[1:15:19] brother this evening amen I'm so glad
[1:15:22] that we have we we have a redeemer
[1:15:26] parents don't fret

[1:15:33] you don't have to worry
[1:15:36] amen commit him into the hands of God
[1:15:38] just like the father did
[1:15:40] that's it just like the father committed
[1:15:43] him
[1:15:44] hey man eventually all things will work
[1:15:47] together for the good to to them that
[1:15:50] love God and if you know that you love
[1:15:52] God then everything that's happening now
[1:15:55] amen is not the end of the story
