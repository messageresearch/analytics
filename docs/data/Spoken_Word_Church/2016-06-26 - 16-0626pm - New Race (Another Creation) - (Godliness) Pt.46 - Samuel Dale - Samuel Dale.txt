isn't it amen amen thank God any other announcements way Terren are done made all have about their little boy they going to ADT tomor okay Anna and Richard their thing for the adoption and all for the

for being you because that way we can depend upon you you said you change not so we don't have to worry we don't have to try to find you to search you out or look for you somewhere we just know that where we left you the last time you'll be right there waiting on us and we pray that you would just help us and guide us and let your love and understanding be with each and every one of us thank you for being with Richard and Anna getting them back home Lord Lord being with brother Hal Lord bringing him through all this all these others we thank you for your love and your grace to each one and guide us now let your word come forth and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction guide us now forgive our sins and keep us in Jesus name amen Revelations 3:14 and at the angel of the Church of the lady of candr these things sayith the amen in the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now we'll go to Second Peter verse one Simon Peter servant and Apostle of Jesus Christ to them that have obtained like Precious Faith with us through the righteousness of God and our Savior Jesus Christ Grace and peace be multiplied unto you through the knowledge of God and of Jesus our lord according as his divine power hath given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue we by given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by these as a prophet would say these promises you might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through lust and beside this giv all diligence add to your faith virtue and virtue knowledge and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patience and the patience godliness and the godliness brotherly kindness and the brotherly kindness charity for if these things be in you and abound they make you that you shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we're coming up through and getting on into deeper depths and higher points of understanding so I pray that you will just you know go along with us and just stay in those places and come to where that we're talking about the word and knowing that in this hour it's required for somebody you know I believe somebody is going to be changed don't you all right that's a requirement it's it's spoke of in the word and all and it's there and it'll be changed in a moment twinkle of an eye now that way then the biggest portion is not going to be that but they're going to die and go by the grave so that's that's fine too no problem because uh as sister Ceta used to say she said if I die before you do I'll just beat you up so that's a pretty good point you just get up before you do you know because that's the way it is the dead in Christ shall rise for then we shall be changed all right but that's that's just the day and the hour that we're living and I believe now that this is the end of all things of time we never have been date Setters or no points but we've always been to the point of of looking and talking with a sister last night about it I'm not looking as I said this morning about the governments the times you know what all of this is all of that is is there but I look to the revealing of the word of God all right because it's not going to create a Revival to find out Hillary's in the White House amen you know that's not going to do it that's that's not going to bring it it's going to be the revealing of God's word that will bring us to that well it's going to be the revealing of God's word that brings the uh the church World system after us too that's that's the point when God pours out himself among the bride then they're going to come after us according to the prophet well I've never looked forward and been pessimistic nor optimistic I just be at myself we just take it as we come day by day and believe that God will be there to supply whatever we have need of right because it's not something that we if we could try to plan to get ahead on doing something what good would it do because at 90% of the time our plans are are no good anyway they don't work out all right but to wait upon God and that's what we were talking about this morning about patience is to wait on God and believe that he gave the promise all right but we talked about too in the message this morning that God was waiting on us right all right then you know I keep quoting that where the Prophet said he's seen nothing outside of the Readiness of the Bride see all right then that's what we need to do is try to get ourselves ready for the day and the hour and the time and whatever it be and and wait with patience but in patience see not waiting just like we're sitting down waiting if you got a place that you got to be at you know you you're supposed to be at the airplane you know supposed to be down at the airport and you go over to the bus depot and you say well I'm waiting no that's the wrong place you got to be at the right spot the right thing of what's taking place and I do truly believe that we're in the last days you know a time is fastly running out on you and I all right that's not obscure tactic that's telling the truth all right if it don't one way or the other it's going to get us AG is going to get us or something anyway so that's going to be the point but I believe that God is waiting on you and I to stand up and accept a position of where we're at and believe it now every age I believe this church and I've always believed it this way and I've always taught it this way every age had a word for that age which you know what somebody had to stand up and declare that for that age right just because the messenger of the age came out with a message see I like I always said about Martin Luther sure he had the message of the just shall live by faith and you know the Catholic Church wasn't concerned about him I mean he was just one person they didn't get all upset when he began to do all those things and nail his thesis up and do those things that didn't bother him he just one person but when the people begin to stand up for what Luther had taught right and proclaimed for themselves and started pulling away then the Catholic Church got upset about it all right see then I believe that we're sitting here in the end time we've had the message it's been delivered unto us now it's time for somebody to say this is that all right and say it not by just head knowledge remember that was in the message of knowledge it's Holy Ghost knowledge you this is that that was spoken of in the scriptures all right and believing who we are all right why not because it is the last hour there's not another age to be promised anywhere is that true it's not another day or a time to be promised it's this is the day of salvation this is the end of all things all right why can't we didn't stand up and say all right I believe it right I believe it you know as I've always told you you got to confess that you're healed before you're healed right that's Bible before you're saved you got to confess that you're saved right confess with a mouth believe in the heart it's got to be done all right now it's not an automatic process for salvation to come it's on the basis of what you confess then God will come on the scene all right well then wouldn't the Rapture the chains be the same thing would not it be that somebody will say this is that we're here and believe it and let God make it manifest well I just don't believe it you know why that's that way you know why people make that statement because they're not prepared right they're not ready and they know they're not ready why is it you can be talking to somebody you know you mention the P you know I'm talking about denominationalism or people know nobody knows the day or the hour nobody knows these things well you're not saying anybody does you're just talking about the End of Time see they're not ready you know like I said this morning where was the little policeman at standing over there in Scotland or what it was when they ask him where the Revival was he said I'm the Revival well when are we going to start making this person on to you and I right the day and hour We're living to make it personal real to us and start saying we're here amen all right now so we talked about patience this morning and that's what I said in the message this morning you know that God has been waiting on the church we gave that quote this morning God has been waiting on the church the prophet said it's on uh I just ran it all while AG go I didn't give it to them it's on the message what was the Holy Ghost given for he's talking about he's pouring in his Spirit those that are in are resting out under in the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says crying how long how long how much longer what how much longer they're not saying how long how long to avenge our blood right they're saying how much how long how long how much longer God's waiting on me and you the church is waiting on me and you adoption time when God can pour into us his fullness his power his resurrection that when the church and Christ become come so close together till Christ becomes visible Among Us and raises the dead and we go into Rapture all right so God's waiting on you and I now you say well well wait well some of us have been around long enough to know what I'm talking about it's been about 51 years since the prophet left the S don't you think God has been patiently waiting right God has been patiently waiting on somebody to stand up and say where we're at well we're not looking for a worldwide Revival no there's not that I said this morning but the brother randam said it'll take those seven unknown Thunders back in to wake the bride up for her Revival he said she hadn't had a Revival yet it'll take them seven unknown Thunders well whatever you're expecting to come out of that situation you know what I mean by that cuz most of the people are waiting on brother brandom to come back Etc to do this to do that do that all if that's what you're waiting on we see this got to happen right irregardless of what you want to stay in your mind you're waiting on then it's got to happen well what not make why not get PR fired like I said about those Brothers I'm not throwing off on them they said they had that airplane that brother Brown was supposed to fly you know we said we got it out there we said it'll take us two years to get it flyable but the Lord can come anytime you know but it take two years to get the thing flyable he said well I've always told you what I am sorry if I believed it that way that airplane be sitting on that Runway brand new set of tires every day right brand new tank full of gas every day and cranked up and flew out and come back and landed see we make fun of the uh White Horse of Muhammad right we laugh at that but at least they change the horse that's right they don't let the horse stand there and stve to death you see what I'm saying I've always just been plain we are the people that's what God is waiting on that's right and I think his patience is about run out that's about as truthful as I can make it he's going to move on the scene yeah why because he promised it right you know why there's going to be a resurrection and a rapture because God promised it and it'll be right on time you remember nothing I of cater with with God so you think that we ought to be at least thinking about things that we've had you say well why are we here 50 years later God's waiting on somebody to stand up and say we're here right why not but you know what is happening instead people are just falling off falling off dropping off yeah okay but he's waiting on the church 50 years since the prophets going that God has waited but it keeps getting worse and worse and worse and worse okay now get on to the message remember what I said we would put in to each stage first you must have Faith the new birth then you add virtue which is the same material as faith is or it won't vcan IE right Faith virtue knowledge temper all that's the same material called it's holy it's Holy Ghost material all right so then where are we talking about faith you had virtue you had knowledge remember the prophet if it's a right kind of knowledge if it's a right kind of Faith Temperance all right this morning getting down to patience patience you know that God has waiting on you and I to have these virtues what is he waiting on times running out Hillary in the White House coming after what do we got God's waiting on you and I to have these virtues a Rapture can't come without these virtues in an individual I'm talking Rapture chain the M twinkling an eye now those that die and go by the grave are going to come up and go in a Rapture right come on but those that are chained in a moment twinkling I don't tell me you're going to have a novice come walking up through there they didn't start the church off as a novice right he started the church off with a great stage right so what's he going to do now see see you must have patience before you can come to the point of talking about godliness right then remember these are the things that God expects us to add now he's gave us the material and you remember how I preached it how do we get these virtues they have to be by the opening of God's word right right not CA I'm in the message and I've done I'm older seniority and all y'all yeah I know I I I slept with the prophet I I ate with him I don't that's wonderful praise God but we're seniority getting us anything with God no you see that's why I said that like that this Wednesday night why is it that your family is not in the message I know that offend I know it does I know it ties but it ought to I mean for it too okay you mean to hurt our feelings no no I mean to tell you the truth have I become your enemy then because I tell you the truth Temperance our kids are watching us the neighbor is watching you you know right everybody works watching you amen and you claim to be something one day and there you are the other what okay remember these virtues we gave it where the Prophet was talking about it he expects us to have these or why would he tell add patience aders why would he tell it if it wasn't there expecting us to receive it all right now as I say and repeat it what he's given us the material now we've had 50 years I'm talking about since the prophet left to sink 50 years to study the message we've only got one message that proclaims one gospel one God one Faith one Lord one baptism it's all one right right he's give us 50 years to study it you know if you were going to study to be a doctor and you studied 50 years that'd be something wouldn't it what of your requirements to be a doctor what tickles me to death is I think now I'm just going to say I know they have to have the interns but you go like eight years to college to be a doctor you know how how long it takes you to be a doctor to be a a veterinarian 12 years oh I know there excuses animals are not all the same come on garbage can they think more of the animals than they do as humans they require 12 years to be a veterinarian 8 years to be a surgeon you know listen the prophet said these virtues what must come from the inside out right and that we must be partakers of his divine nature so they come from the inside out so then there's nothing we can manufactor and all we got to do is read the book you read the Bible read the message that's all God expects us to do right he's going to supply what we have need of from how much we've done that now you see why some gain quicker than others most of you know more a whole lot more about all these other things you know know than you know about the word of God right but now watch here we come okay can we going going come back to this statement in a minute you know that we come all the way up because we're going to talk about godliness you know that we come all the way up to Godliness and watch this statement you come all the way to Godliness godliness before he expects you to be like God right now let that choke a little while he he comes all the way to to this position all the way through faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience now he expects you to be like God right because what is godliness sure we know the definition is to be like God well now we got the only way you can be like God now listen the only way you can be like God is to have faith now in action not just talking Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience he doesn't expect you to be like God until you come to Godliness W oh I didn't think of it like that well why is it that way to be like God first definition we'll get on down in a minute we'll read it it means Holiness well according to my Bible the it says that without Holiness no man shall see the Lord that's right now I'm laying a foundation for Wednesday night okay so then you got to come all the way to this place before he expects you to be like him now listen folks when you're born again you then have the nature of God in your soul as a child right an earnest right all right now he expects us to act like Christians at that stage right right you not supposed to act like the devil w't to act like a Christian at the new birth if not then he's not going to give you virtue now it don't click it don't click in what I'm saying you mean he waits he you have to you come all the way up to Godliness before you got to be like God yet he expects you to be like God when you're born again but that's only in the baby stage right come on are you following me amen right then it surely is a growth development sir it's not an automatic process that just when we we get born again we get everything well why did Peter say add are you with me this is background for a few minutes to for sun for Wednesday now why is it that it that God would what would be his whole point as you mean that he would give you the new birth he would even give you virtue even give you knowledge even give you Temperance even give you patience and he still doesn't act expect you to be like God come on I'm quoting the prophet whether you know it or not so you already to know I don't make statements without quoting okay so what is it there must be something about this that we're not comprehending and the main the main thing to me is that we're not comprehending the new birth because the new birth brings us the very nature of almighty God right but that's in a baby form that's not a growth that's not a full grown child we're talking about a growing in Grace and knowledge can you relate to any of the things that we've been talking about can you relate to that it's not just there just because you say it's there amen it's not there just because I've been in the message years why is it that most of the people of this message are backslid you said yet there's Millions yeah there's Millions counting the ones overseas but where is there really just an anchored group of people that is holding on okay but when you come to Godliness you've come all this way before he expects you to be like God well I don't I don't understand that I know you don't understand that because you're not listening to you're you're not praying to listen you're listening to refute instead of just wondering what somebody's saying instead of being serious about it and saying brother you're right God gives us a new birth but that's not all of it that's right well how do you get the rest of it like I said this morning people say oh we we right up here cuz we born in this age well how'd you get up there the only question I got Peter tells you how to get there but we there just because of the age or a time or something I'm sorry but one day you'll find out that I've got one goal and that's to try to get you and I to find our place to get where we're supposed to be and let God come on the scene all right okay what is godliness right just remember you can't jump rungs and go up you got to start at the bottom that's right and go up all right go ahead and pull number one up and let's get started this is paragraph 309 of the Statue of a perfect man then we're going to drop back come back through look after you done come from here to here to here to here to here to here now you're coming into the full stature now of a Son of God but you got to have this plus all this and you you can't even start until you get this right what's he saying you can't start till you get the new birth so the prophet what did he say one day the new birth is the most important thing in your life is the new birth cuz you can't even start without it now remember the black bird with the peacock feathers don't forget himc don't try to add it till you actually you're actually born again oh got to drop to don't try to add it till you're actually born again C you it won't work and you you can't make it work until you get a new birth it won't work that's what he said it'll come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere what was we reading this morning where brother Brandon said if you come up and had you Faith virtue knowledge and temperance and your per your patience wasn't correct he said it'll crumble the whole thing why would brother R and say the gifts without the virtues is a stumbling block to the unbeliever okay now remember the black bird with the peacock feed don't don't try to add it till you actually born again cuz it won't work and you you can't make it work it come to this or this here it'll crumble somewhere but when you get down here a genuine Born Again Dove then you don't add nothing it adds to you see it comes on up all right coming into Perfection now all right if you're a true peacock you'll have peacock feathers right right amen you don't have to worry about it look at the next one now let's let's read paragraph 2 299 but if you got genuine Faith then genuine ver then put genuine virtue to it then genuine knowledge then genuine Temperance then genuine patience you're moving right on up the line right now fifthly add godliness oh my godliness to be added what does godliness mean he said he looked it up in four five dictionary and couldn't find it finally brother Jeff they found it in the dictionary godliness means to be like God then what oh my after you got Fai virtue knowledge Temperance then be like God and you thought while ago I was just using my own thoughts right you're no better than that when I'm saying you can't do this you can't do that you can't have ver you can't have knowledge until and he don't expect you to have knowledge until you have all these other virtues that's right are you reading that's not the only quote but after you got Faith virtue knowledge temper patience then be like God God don't expect you to do it right you say I can't do that brother br oh yes you can that's what he says let me just read you a few scriptures here just a minute Matthew 5:48 we'll take this one and see what it sounds like Matthew 5:48 and see if you're supposed to be like God you know the Bible says you're Gods right Jesus said so why all the virtue all the things that's in God is in you Matthew 5:48 be ye Jesus speaking in the Beatitudes now we're stopping right here today we're not going to get on to Matthew 5:48 that'll be Wednesday okay let's stay with what he says here let's stay with the point of what he says what is godliness to be like God to be like God then he brings it to a conclusion or thought of what that you are gods I see that's where everybody goes that's great people of the message no now in a way in a way you can say that brother Brown didn't say it that way did he what did he say he said not such a thing as saying in a way it's either it or not right right all right look now holding it to what holding it to the point that we're going to talk about godliness as to be like God and then our thought will be today of your Gods well if you can't comprehend that you're Gods you certainly can't comprehend godliness cuz the only thing we we think about like uh godliness is be like God we just think about being good that's part of it but there's a lot more goes with it besid just being good is that all you think about God that he was good I can show you a God that one day will destroy every moving living human being that is not in the right place amen right I'll show you a God in the word that says go out and destroy that whole nation men women children babies kill them all that's right and he's God it's not just being good is to say to be like God well I'll just be good that's part of it but that order had its basis in the faith of the new birth okay you're a little slow this afternoon so it's a good point I guess let's continue on but like I said now we're dividing we're not going to get on to that Matthew 5:48 we're just going to get on to the point of to be like God is to be God because that's what the scripture says right but I want to make sure you follow me what I'm talking about cuz I gave this this morning and I want you to follow go ahead number three taking some Blasphemous names brother Brown makes an outstanding statement I want to make sure you get this to have an understanding to my knowledge I had Temperance self-control I like that my country T the crown my soul with self soul with self-control from SE The Shining Seas patience oh my tested don't you worry Satan will come we'll count them for you I'm climing up the ladder now now watch him I've added virtue so he means you have to have the faith right I've added virtue knowledge Temperance now I got to have patience see that was the point we was covering this morning watch him I still ain't got the Holy Ghost that's what I said those are the quotes that people use to prove their point that we don't have the Holy Ghost like the disciples had the Holy Ghost amen I can go along with that to one point but I can't on all the point cuz on the day of Pentecost that's where people don't get it on the day of Pentecost you got two situations one group in the upper room that had been tutored for three and a half years maybe not all of them cuz you got 120 up there but they'd been tutored the group downstairs are the the 3,000 heard one sermon right brother brandham said the disciples had these virtues and I cover up love because he said The Headstone ain't come yet that's better known as what would be called a faith of the fathers so if you're just a born again novice a born again Earnest of our inheritance we don't have it like the disciples had it as the faith of the fathers amen that's sensible that don't mean it ain't here for us right and that's where the people talk about that we don't have the Holy Ghost like they had on the day of Pentecost if you got the new birth you got it exactly the way it was on the day of Pentecost cuz that's the only way to have it right right so what's he saying you get born again it's a great wonderful climb right we're good up to here we get up to brother cless later I can say we don't have the Holy Spirit that's what he says but what's he saying well you're trying to interpret it don't play games with me and I won't with you okay because hey you take that and twist it on the other side and say of the Prophet said we ain't got the Holy Ghost yet that's your interpretation now you've done the same thing I have you've made a statement from your interpretation so don't play with me it's too late it's what I said we're we're we're here at the end of all of these things and we better get settled down into something because it ain't going to be playing games when they come after you I gave you the quotes s the other night about if you didn't get them make sure you get a copy of them I got someone on my desk where brother rown says two times thus sayith the Lord there will be a persecution well if we believe the end of time is close then things better start happening well brother they you scare me my kids if you can't have faith for your kids today in the Rapture to come tomorrow what are you going to have anyway sorry but look what he said he comes up he said I got patience that's a long ways up right Faith virtue knowledge Temperance patience he said I ain't got the Holy Ghost yet when he done told you you had the holy ghost at the new birth and faith that is the Holy Ghost amen then after I had patience I had godliness you know what that is like God I add that that don't misbehave myself go like a Christian gentleman ought to be let that not be a put on something in me that not be a put on something in me the love of God just boiling you see not say boy I could do this but maybe I'd better not see ha it's there anyhow he said it's a birth I've been birthed into this into this into this into this and this and then the love of God Christ comes down and seals all that up in me for service there's not seven new births there's one you birth amen but the seven birth into virtues cuz you birth into virtue you're birth into knowledge you're birth into Temperance you're birth into patience right a birth means a coming forth in two right so then we do need these things to be like the disciples why was Peter trying to tell you where to come to trying to tell you to come where he was at right but that's where we got that point right like I said this morning I wasn't the one that wrote the book over to back close to the back of the book brother Brown say statue of a perfect man he said fill me up Lord with these things Faith virtue knowledge temper fa and godliness brotherly kindness and love he said that I may teach others Apostles prophets evangelist pastors and teachers that they may bring these virtues into the body but see we don't need a pastor we don't need these things we just get it straight from the prophet the most backsliding people you've ever seen is what I told a man one time I said you show me that type of people and I'll show you back toling bunch of people oh of course no okay all right but listen what is godliness strong concordance go ahead number four it means godliness it means Holiness now see the reason to give those words you can take this and go back up and click on and get more wordings with it it'll be different wordings to be used but reason it's got that like that always it will give you the main number first godliness or if it's patience it gives you patience first and then comes down all right listen it means Holiness without Holiness no man can see the Lord it means reverence now that's what this godliness means the prophets done told us is to be like God now it means respect piety which means reverence towards God see piety towards God reverence respect and all toward God it means godliness what a wonderful word of godliness but remember the point I said that we're going to deal with talking about godliness to be like God we know that definition we've got those things there but let's deal with it in the scriptures of what brother random gave us on that quote while ago cuz when he was listed Matthew 5:48 Matthew 5:48 says Be You therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect Matthew 4 5:48 doesn't say you're are Gods right brother BR said he'll give you a couple of scriptures he mentioned Matthew 28 I mean mentions uh they're about to being perfect but he starts off by talking about your Gods you know if you're going to be like God now let's take a definition we think and we've been taught to be like God is means that uh we know we're not really nothing and all but we're doing the best we can do and we're trying the best we can do so we'll just be likeing the best we can be have you ever looked up the word like never looked up the word like the word like doesn't mean a second person you said I don't want to be like brother K that that's our human terminologies but in scriptural terminologies like is the same image that's why it says in in Genesis let us make man in our image and our likeness cuz the word image is not something like it it's not a photostatic copy or a cologne it means the same person just in another body then we know for certain Jesus was God right we understand that perfectly well now let's just read some scriptures that goes with it we'll go as far as we can we'll break off go ahead with number five let's see what Jesus has to say about something my sheep hear my voice and I know them they follow me and I give unto them eternal life his life okay and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand my Father which gave them me is greater than I and no man is able to pluck them from my father's hand I and my father are one now watching you know what brother around said with would bring the World Council of churches after you he said when the bride begins to say I am my father are one and these other things he said they'll come after us cuz that's what they done with the Lord Jesus he turned around he said I and my father one now I wish you would think about it but we don't have to drop cuz it's way on down but he gets on down a little further in this same writing and he says if you don't believe me he said you believe the works cuz he said they testify of who I am was it not true that Nicodemus said we know that thou art a man come from God cuz no man can do the things you're doing unless he be of God right come on when Jesus said I my father one then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him and Jesus answered many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because that thou being a man maketh thyself God and Jesus knew how to answer them didn't he he trapped them with their own words that's a good way to solve an argument with anybody watch him trap him Jesus answered it is is it not written in your law now they were the guys that noted to the letter and he called it their law because it was given to them look is it not written in your law I said you're Gods if he called them unto whom to whom the word of God came and the scripture came not be broken say ye of him whom the father has Sanctified and sent into the world th blasphemy is because I said I'm a Son of God if I do not the works of my father believeing not yours at but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in you Jesus said your own law has condemned you now watch you where's that at in the scripture go ahead to number six Psalms 82 God standeth in the congregation of the mighty he judges among the gods how long will you judge unjustly and accept the persons of the wicked defend the poor and fatherless to Justice to defend the poor and fatherless do justice to The Afflicted and needy deliver the poor and needy rid them out of the hand of the wicked they know not neither will they understand they walk on in darkness that's the other parts of the people right all the foundation of the Earth are out of course I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high the children of God are his offspring right then if you're his offspring you're his child if he was God you're God oh but now that's just a little bit too far no that is stand far enough I ain't far enough right right you're not understanding what it means to be a child of God I thought we believe that Jesus was not a second person that's what I thought now right and by saying he's not a second person then it means he's not even the first person because you can have other persons but he is the person of almighty God Amen now if his offsprings are his children who are they you don't realize what the new birth makes you Church the new birth makes you God made manifest in another form called a bride or called children of God and look what he says in the Old Testament Jesus is quoting back to him he's quoting probably back from some of the thought that you could pick up through the scriptures but I have said you're gods and all of you are the children of the most high what about that going on to the next one number seven Isaiah 41 when the poor needy needy seek water and there is none and their tongue faileth for thirst I the Lord will hear them I the Lord I the the god of Israel will not forsake them him I will open rivers in high places and fountains in the midst of the valley that's what he thinks of his people right I will make the Wilderness a pool of water and the dry land Springs of water I will plant in the wilderness the Cedar and the sidam tree and the Myrtle and the oil tree that's what he thinks of his family I will set it in the desert you know the fur tree and the pine and the Box tree together and they may see and know that I consider and understand together that the hand of the Lord ha done this and the Holy One hath of Israel hath created it produce your cause sayith the Lord bring forth your strong reasonings sayith the king of Jacob let them bring them forth and show us what shall happen let them show the former things that they be that we may consider them and know the latter end of them and declare us things for to come show the things that are to come here after that we may know that you are Gods y do good or do evil that we may be dismayed and behold it together show the things that are to come Hereafter that we may know that you are gods so to be godliness is going to have to deal with being God course we don't want to go it that way do we now that's just going a little bit too far now oh now now a son well what is the Son of God uh you shouldn't agreed with me while ago okay you agreed that Jesus was not a second person that he was the person of God then what are his offspring his sons and daughters I thought the Bible says there in Romans 8 I thought it said something like that we were ARS of Salvation And how that we were join ours with Jesus Christ so every what he's got I've got and what he is I am see that's why people wouldn't understand in brother brandham when I first heard this man talking we call William brandham that was what I was looking at I was looking at a man that was talking a strange language to the religious world no wonder they couldn't follow him but no wonder he would tell it and he'd say you killed him back there for that and you doing it now CU you're killing the the the respect the things that he was speaking of you crucified and there and the Bible said he crucify him again put him to an open shame the scripture says listening to a man that spake like he was God and that he was telling I know what the Bible says about it we' got them in here we're going to read some more you call them Gods to whom the word of God come to that's the prophets the prophets were called Gods amen Moses God said what I'll make you God and Aaron to be your Prophet then we know the human side of it right but Moses stepped out with the word he was God when he stepped back he was Moses but I'll remind you he stepped out and he was God and brought the word when he stepped back as Moses they couldn't look on his face right because it was too much there okay what about it do you think the children of God has God made manifest another form I do there's where you godliness comes in to be like God not to be like God because he's one image and we're another but we're trying to act like him and be like him that's not God in that's not your prophet's definition your Prophet gave the definition we're going to read it again he gave the definition and immediately turned to the scriptures your God's and immediately determined Matthew 5:48 to be his point that you're perfect well ain't none of us perfect I think it's time to get rid of some of that after 50 years of hearing it ain't good to bring it what about it and I thought now come on we're going to solve it all the way through we're going to talk about the prophets were gods to the people but we're going to remember that the greatest of all prophets was John the Baptist right is that scripture but we better remember the rest the least in the kingdom is greater than John we remember that that's why I love the Bible see like what one brother said he said I read it you know I found it still says the same thing well you know that's good it don't change all right now we claim to believe a prophet's message right you know we claim to believe a prophet's message so we claim to say well okay if we have any question about anything we just go to the prophet we ask the prophet what right go we're not like to denominations that got to ask the high priest or the big guy in the front or who this is or that is hey did you see the other day what Trump done you think that old boy ain't smart you know that in the paper now I am quoting that you know that Jensen Franklin Free Chapel Pastor had already been chosen to be one of his advisors so would Jerry fwell Jr has done been chosen not the senior now I don't know he may be dead but Jerry fwell Jr in Jensen Franklin it pastors the Free Chapel Church of in Gainsville and done been pick to be his advisors oh rude right now listen so let's read a few things from Brother randam about this point of year gods and see if we can follow it and see what the that the Lord Jesus is really saying when he says you are Gods he told them you are gods now remember Paul on Mars Hill you remember what he said you know they had all these images and all these images sitting around and then it just probably had one little old Blank Space sitting there you know probably had a little stool fixed or whatever and he he said uh uh what's that father and that said uh well you know we've got about 4,000 Gods up here but just in case we miss one of them said that's to the unknown God God what Paul say Paul said okay that's good I'll just take that he said let me talk to you about this unknown God right and he said you say and so does your poets that we are his offspring now was Paul speaking of a God in heaven or somebody to come need to take the stool in front of him or was he speaking of what he had in his own life right he said you say and your poets are right he said paraphrase just a little and said we are his offspring okay brother Brandon we want to talk about this a little bit let's goe with number8 which is the deity of Jesus Christ 1949 you cannot be saved only by accepting J Christ by the Holy Spirit if he's in you he's the power of God live by it he's God in you the Bible said and we thank God it's is upon me oh God and Jesus said listen the Pharisees answered said you make yourself God said isn't it written in your law you're Gods see they going to have to break that out of their scriptures you know okay he made Moses a God to Pharaoh once and he made you a God to the people that's right and you this morning are written Epistles of God your your lives are of God and even carries that Holy Ghost now what are we goe to the next resurrection of Lazarus that's what's the matter with the Pentecost people they don't recognize who they are you're Sons and Daughters of God you have in your hand look then Jesus it was one time quoted in the scripture you're gods look deity I'm a part of Charles brandom because I was born of Charles brandom my Daddy I'm a part of him I got a forehead like him my hair was like him I'm a small man like him I'm in the nature like him God he's my dad and if we become in spirit sons of God deity dwell DS in the man Hallelujah then you talk about blind eyes being open they said nothing impossible to God God says nothing impossible with you right if you believe not with God but you deity in the man the very God that stood back there on the mythical platform of the eternities and roll World off of his hands and created these things things give you the privilege to be his son and you're a part of him and God dwells in mankind and man himself is deity Allelujah there you are it might choke you but study over that a little while see he is God dwells in man and man becomes the Son of God not him in himself but the Holy Spirit that's in him is God the Creator lives in the creation oh my how I think of that then stand with an unwaver bring Faith and ask God what you will it'll be done unto you there he is which one will God hear an angel or a son of God he said he you're a Son of God first go ahead to the next testimony of Jesus Christ you see if a man does not have the Holy Spirit he cannot believe those things good point because when a man is born to the spirit of God he becomes a Son of God his nature is likened unto God that's the reason Jesus said did not it say in your laws you're Gods because you're an attributes of God an attribute of God is a part of God right go to the next of the discernment of spirits now the spirit of God working in man makes man act like God no wonder Jesus said is it not is not it written you're gods and they called him God to whom the spirit of God came to how can you condemn me then when I am the Son of God if you could see the spirit of God in Moses which he was God Moses was a god Joseph was a God the prophets were Gods the Bible said they were they were Gods because it they had completely surrendered themselves to the spirit of God that they were working for the glory of God and when a man is so Anointed with the spirit now that just go real deep under the fifth rib on the left side when a man is Anointed of the spirit of God his habits his actions and everything is God moving in him sometimes he's misjudged but just think about it one more then we'll get into some scriptures God hiding in Simplicity but an aluer in New Mexico confess your sins upon the blood of Jesus Christ it omits it puts it in the sea of forgetfulness and to be remembered no more against you at all now where is the church today Brethren if we are born to be sons of God and Jesus himself said said if you're law if your own law said ye are Gods amateur Gods with control of the Earth he said if they call them Gods unto whom the word of the God come to which was the prophets the word of the Lord comes to the prophets prophet and if you'll call them Gods how do you condemn me he said when I say I'm the Son of God what about it what do you think about your are Gods well that's only for the prophets well we gave them in there we're talking about the children so it's all right with me but that's you're not going to listen to that anyway you're going to hold to the prophets were Gods well if you're going to hold to that why don't you worship brother brandom as deity oh oh we're not that far well we don't worship deity and E each other do we I don't worship the god in you the God in Me is the one I worship not the god of William bradam no way see you're getting in the wrong place when you start talking about cuz God is a personal God to each and every one of us well brother d i Jesus was in brother brand when I worshiped Jesus be real careful you're getting very close to your deity and I'm a firm believer in deity with we stand up Jeffersonville Indiana right after coming to the message and I walk up to a man up there and he starts talking about brother brandham being deity I said I'll tell you what I'll go along with you if you'll go along with me he said what I said that brother right there he we we say he's got the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's got the new birth he said okay I said right now I'll go along with you if you go along with this way that new birth in him is the spirit of almighty God that's deity dwelling in him that's right right take away gifts and signs and wonders put brother brandom on the other side I said it's the same God isn't it he said oh no well they would no need a talking right because he was believing brother BR was de but I was explaining him brother BR said any believer that takes the word of God upon his lips one time he say is as deity the other time you say that is deity right let's read a few scriptures real fast okay pull all these up on the end brother there they'll be on one you can do like you done this morning we'll just read okay I exhort take it from 1 Timothy 2 1-3 I exhort therefore that first of all supplications prayer intercessions and giv of thanks be made for all man for kings and for all that are in Authority that we may lead a quiet and Peaceable life in all good godliness and honesty for this is good and acceptable in the sight of God godliness 1 Timothy 47 and8 but refuse profane and wi wise fables and excuse thyself rather excuse me and exercise thyself rather unto godliness exercise but Godly exercise profit little but godliness is profit unto all things having promise of the life that is now is and that which is to come so we can exercise godliness we need to but then not godly exercise not to but godliness is profitable to everything you know to live like God to be like God go ahead 1 Timothy 6 3 and 6 If any man Teach otherwise and consent not to Wholesome words even the words of our Lord Jesus and to the doctrine which is according to Godliness oh it's a Doctrine remember Holiness without no man can see God he is proud knowing nothing but dating about questions and stri of words whereof cometh even to strive really okay perverse disputing of men of corrupt minds and destitute of the truth supposing that gain is godliness from such withdraw thyself but godliness with contentment is great gain you remember see it comes to my mind that brother Randon was talking to those guys cuz it was somewhere overseas or something and they got up and told that they were this poor evangelist but yet that God came on the scene with them and they they had Cadillacs and had all kind of things you remember him telling that brother said that ain't right he said game like that is not showing godliness or truth he was telling them oh when I got saved I had to got a fleet of Cadillacs I got all these you certainly couldn't put that in the scripture where Peter and John said what Cadillacs Have I None right I to wake you up okay next 1 Timothy 6:1 but thou oh man of God flee these things and follow after righteousness what are we to follow after righteousness godliness Faith love patience meekness look like he's putting us in a pretty good place with God in this don't it 2 Timothy 3:6 and 7 for this sort are they which creep into houses and led captivity you know ever learning but never able to come to the knowledge of the truth right they don't have no godliness ever learning but never coming into the knowledge of the the truth ain't no godliness to all of those things L after silly go ahead to the next let's see 17 18 Paul a servant of Jesus Christ and apost servant of God and Apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the [Music] truth which is after godliness now you reading that scripture read it Paul and the servant of God and Apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness what should all of our truth be after godliness right last one we don't get on to that one he'll be desol what manner of person ought you to be okay we got something messed up on that when I I gave him the wrong quote cuz what I was wanting was yeah second Peter 3 11 is that it okay now we got it seeing then that all these things shall be dissolved what manner of person ought we to be in all holy conversation and godliness what kind of a person should we be godliness to be like God you know a child of God is God made manifest in another form yeah but see we're supposed that's what we are just remember we get him by measure Jesus had all of it you know what all that was in him if I got a measure it's the same thing that was in him the only thing you're going to do is degree it but remember a spoon full of water out of the ocean same chemical same thing is a whole ocean right amen so then go God living whether it be back there or living now godliness now we're going to go on to that because you come all this way before godliness is required then we'll get Matthew 5:48 to be you therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect but I'm not going that way I'm going to hold it off till Wednesday night Lord winning your gods that's right would it not be feasible or thoughtful enough to think about if you're God then you're supposed to act like him so wouldn't that be the definition of God in this to be like God what would he do in the case I said we used to see the kids with a band on what would Jesus do you know well why don't we take it to be that way if we claim to have his faith his virtue his knowledge his Temperance his patience and now all he wants us to do is just be like him but if you're understanding what I'm saying you can't be like him until you have those virtues that's right you're only a baby when you get to New Birth you're like him because you're a child of God but he's wanting growth development he's wanting that adoption to come and then I thought when adoption came that our name was just as good on a checkbook as his right I've always told you about adoption and I think people going went the wrong way what I've all heard I'm just putting what I've heard it's like that that you're coming on the scene and to be something great and this is lining up with what I'm talking about that you're God's but I take most people's adoption oral form as being that God is leaving and you're coming on the scene look at me no that is not adoption adoption is you going off the scene and God coming on the scene right now you tell me anything else about adoption well he just making it where you yeah he's making it where you and him but he's making it because he's in you adoption is God coming on the scene the tutor is to teach the nature of the father to the child until the child doesn't come the nature of the tutor right he becomes the nature of the father right so who's supposed to come on the scene God's supposed to come on the scene but where's he at he's in his people the new birth makes you God made manifest like a sister told us he used to play the piano fars years ago she said the way you're teaching it way brother mod is teaching it she said it don't make no difference how I live cuz I'm God I said you ain't getting it I said you need to go go back and listen a whole lot I said we ain't never talk nothing like that my teaching is God coming on the scene not leaving the scene and leaving it with me if his nature is in me then I'm to be like him and remember to be like him and like genesis let us make man in our own image come on musician in our own image he said with image is the very same person right we're not talking about another God coming on the scene we're talking about the same God but that's why we're not believing it we're not believing it the way that God is saying it we have our own interpretation to those thoughts and ideas instead of letting him say it I thought the Bible said that he was pleased to well amen wasn't that what it said about Jesus and whom I'm pleased to dwell brother brand saids please to dwell in you to honor your word right why don't we take it to what we are why don't we take it to be what we are what we got L's thing 604 in the spiral why not take it what God says about us right if we never meet again on Earth my preious friend and if to God we have been true and we've lived above all sin then for us there'll be a meeting yes there's going to be a greeting I'll see you in in the Rapture some sweet [Music] day I'll see you in the Rapture anybody else just come and let's I'll see you in the Rapture I'll see you at that meeting in the air there with our blessed savior we live in Brothers got to go for some tests and all Lord but the time that time comes there won't be anything left because you're taking care of it Moment by moment and day by day or they

until now it was everybody just go by the grave go by the grave come up we looking forward to something else come up but see in this age you're talking about a Rapture the word World talking about they're making movies about it they're making all kind of thing because it's the age right like when the prophet was back there and we came into the message' 67 and you could ride down the road and everybody had Eagles on their carports you remember that you know why because there was a prophet had come through the land see now everybody talking about a Rapture you know what that means it's going to be all right I just want to be ready don't you forgive me Father we thank you for this day and we ask you now to just go with each one of us as we go our own ways Lord and just bless and guide and father that your love could be made manifest in our hearts and that we may see you Lord and walk in your love God each one of us forgive our sins and keep us in Jesus name amen your dismiss
