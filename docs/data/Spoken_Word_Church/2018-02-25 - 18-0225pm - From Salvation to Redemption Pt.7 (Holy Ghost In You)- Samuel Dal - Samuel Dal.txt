good afternoon let me just share something right quick I have a little medley that I'm gonna do but us unlearned or untrained people of color tend to pounce all over the keys that's just the way we

not sound right but it's true you're just part of us we don't have anything here to join up with we're just part of the body of Christ and we ask that you just pray for us as you travel along we ask God's mercy on you as you travel amen there from Arizona so good good to see you remember now by way of announcements that this coming Saturday will be Bible study six o'clock and then on the 17th of March it will be the fellowship meeting here and brother Ernie Villanueva will be ministering for us on that day I say to brother Sampson Shetty from India will be with us on April the 22nd so that'll be you know April that's a month away but we go ahead and make the announcements and times and remember these remember don't wait in June and them coming back and rid of Bob brother Louisa and their families and all traveling and I think brother Joe and them was going on to a birthday party or something so remember all of these and prayed to the Lord would bless huh like turning your scriptures turn where we've been reading in Jonah 2 and verse 9 and then we'll go from there to honesty I gave them one I'll start with the other one we'll go to John 14 father we thank you for this day in your grace we thank you for all things we know that Lord all that we have need of is within our grasp and our understanding all we got to do is believe it so we ask you Lord to help us to believe and then Lord helped our unbelief to bring it out of the way and get rid of it to where we can walk in you and the Lord forgive our sins and guide us by your grace and love and just as we open the word here to read we know that nobody has a right to read it until they ask permission so we ask your permission Lord to speak from your word and that you wouldn't come and make it manifest let it not be as the scripture will read and that it not be me or anyone like that speaking but let it be you speaking through each one of us that was we talk about you we love you and we thank you in Jesus name Amen Jonah 2 verse 9 but I will sacrifice unto thee with the voice of Thanksgiving I will pay that that I have vowed salvation is of the Lord they were giving to John 14 we'll start with verse 9 now really what I'm using this for here is two we're going to try to bring over into salvation coming more into the birth and we know that Jesus Christ had to come and die to release that life and that's why we're using this scripture then we'll pick up mark in a minute as we're going through all right but jesus saith unto Him have I been so long with you and yet hast thou not known me Philip he that hath seen me has seen the father and how say us thou then show us the father that word if you understand well he said believe us I just believed like the devil or something believe us thou not that I am in the father and the father in me the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself but the father that dwelleth in me he doeth the works in other words he do it's worse but he's also doing the talking you'll see that's what we're getting to believe me that I am in the father and the father in me or else believe me for the very works sake burley verily I say unto you he that believeth on me the works that I do shall he do also and greater works than these shall he do because I go unto my father you may be seated the Lord at his blessing to the reading of the word now to background a little bit and then continue on it our thought we've been talking for quite a while on a topic we've talked about and called it salvation and now we're talking about going from salvation to Redemption all right the Old Testament people had salvation you know all right they had God living with them they had a thing that but it wasn't called Redemption back daraa because it did not bring God into full view because it was the Old Testament form so then it was really basically speaking of salvation which means deliverance and it come all the way through and then when you see that it will walk into the new testament form of saying then to bring it to redemptive plan of god you'll see that the salvation has been complete alright now we started with our thoughts in genesis of you know bringing forth the plan that God had and we'll repeat these later more with God in the garden in Adam he placed in the are brought into being what his plan for mankind was and that was to be you know to bring forth man and let him live upon the earth it was never meant for us to live up in heaven heaven to me is not what we're gonna go out and float in the clouds and it means I thought we believe that the future home was going to come right here you know and and then that way we will have our heavenly places you know in heaven we'll be here alright see then we brought that down so remain that it now as we jump over to minute and when I say it you remember the point we started out with Redemption you know but it wasn't called Redemption it was called salvation because Christ had not come and died to make the redemptive plan alright so it was through the blood of bulls and goats but it brought him to salvation it provided them a place when they died they had a place to go to called the Blues in the Vapor ahem you know are called paradise and and all in it it supplied a place it was really a form of salvation for mankind but it was covered by the blood of bulls and goats and then Jesus Christ would come and pay the price for bringing it into being you know of where we need to be all right remember I said he started in Adam what he wanted all right you see Adams standing there as what God wanted for mankind all right now we're going to jump up a little bit because we came over and we picked up Christ and bringing him in to make a way to bring it to where it could turn from salvation into a redemptive plan and then this morning we were bringing down to a basis and showing you that we're here now and we can understand what happened on the day of Pentecost all right and see doing that then we're going back to her that you see in a minute that brother Branham said they asked him said or didn't ask him he asked his own civil question he said what is the new earth Christ the mystery of God revealed we'll read it in a minute he said it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you well then that new birth is a revelation okay now watch the point go we ended up right at the end this morning on what it was revealed unto Abel right it was revealed unto Abel that it was through the blood he Cain had a good thoughts and ideas but it didn't work out it just typed like works and things that we try to do to save ourselves you know be able by revelation offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain did and God respect to that and took it so there's your salvation now all right so there's your believing point that we talked about and then we'll bring that on up into me and you you know because we're bringing it up as a revelation all right see then you can see that we have a long journey to go and in time I don't believe we'll run out before we we get out of here but you know that's all right if it does and we'll just finish over there the so salvation started in the basis of when it come over from mankind it started in the basis - with Cain and Abel you know the first two and God accepting Abel's sacrifice because it was a revelation to them right now it's all going to be built on Revelation all right everything's built on Revelation okay now we're going to get to the scriptures in a minute where no man can call Jesus the Christ or say that Jesus is the Christ without the Holy Ghost all right now we'll pick that up in a minute in a in our thought but we want to try to lay it out to where we can see that what have we been talking about now make sure you follow the point we gave you the quotes this morning and the things and we have them laying here if you not like them and but brother Branham says if you're a new birth begins when you believe your new birth we've given over and over begins when you believe now he didn't say that it was in full manifestation are giving you eternal life he said it begins so your new birth begins when you repentance is genuine and you ask the Lord to forgive you God already is working in you to bring about those things that he wants to bring about so he brings you to justification chopping off your pie sins right then he brings you to sanctification which is cleansing and setting aside and then you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost which is the completed point of the new birth for you at that stage now there's more stages to go along later but we're not concerned with that we're concerned with staying with the new birth all right so now then what was we talking about what would we talk about this past Wednesday so you believe on to eternal life I didn't say you got to eternal life when you believe that's incorrect that's what the Baptist believed in etc and the Saints but you believe unto eternal life so if you take that believing and it doesn't stop now remember we covered how if you're believing stops you lose your salvation now that's batgirl when you're just under justification and sanctification it's not under the new bird you can't have eternal life and lose it God not an Indian giver to give it to you and then you do something wrong he takes it away from you no but when you're in justification and sanctification remember you're not born again yet fully you're just in the process of being mourned again all right see then that brings it down to showing you that mankind has so missed out as the Prophet said the baptism with the Holy Ghost until you know he said it's just been so incorrectly talked so if people say the baptism and they'll say this and they'll say that all right they'll say well the new birth is when you cried you shouted you that's not the new birth a baby don't cry in the wound to the mother it's when it comes out you spank it and it cries all right so then your after effects is you're speaking in tongues you're crying your the things that went with it and any baby that comes forth it's going to come forth crying it's going to have emotions so you're going to have emotions that will bring you something that when you did get born again something will happen back through the human element to her that you'll have the correct understanding all right but remember now we know the story that I are in the book of Acts when the Holy Ghost fell and it said how here we ever man in her own tongue wherein word it wasn't the speaking in the tongue it was the hearing right that's what the Bible says then there were people from all over the world basically at dark that time because of it being a set aside time for them together all right we'll see then it was not you know the basis said how here we ever man you know we Baptists we had it figured out that they would like 12 of them you know 11 November 12 and and they all knew he's got a new languages so one was speaking uttered interpret you don't never hear nothing like that been trying to explain the day of Pentecost you know but that's not what it said they said how here we have a man in our own tongue wherein we were born all right the the mystery has always been the hearing if you want to do any evidence of the Holy Ghost place it into the hearing oh I got a little bit for cholera liver what we thought he's into speaking and the doing and then we got to do this but one said they asked them to iring on the scripture what must we do to be saved and said we tell them what not to do they didn't ask that see that's what to do to be safe so we believe ever believing and be baptized and you know in all it all right but see getting to the point of where that we see that your salvation does begin with you believing but now that's not make-believe or just haphazardly believe it you know no Cain believed in God Cain worship God Cain offered the offerings and things to God what was the difference was able to what kind of a guy or a blessed guy or something or was it that that Abel got a revelation well now what was the difference direct the revelation all right as I said in this morning you have in the world today somewhere probably into a 1 billion class of so-called Christian believers where you count all of your churches and everything you know and the Buddha's and the Hindus and the different thing and come out with religious believers you'd have a big inner so are you gonna say those people are lost no I'm not gonna say they're lost I'm gonna say that's between them and God so we're not worried about them I'm not about to appreciate them I'm preaching right here it's to you and I to get us to see salvation and get us to come to the place that God wants us to be all right and see then we could see that if that's believing as I've emphasized over and over you start believing don't stop don't let nothing hinder that well I went so far you know no I did and I I've done pretty good as I told you we used to having a Baptist Church we had a feller that they'd go get him ever revival that we had I'm not joking you year after year they'd bring him get him come to church and he'd come to church and he'd come to the altar and he cried and pray and he'd get up and he'd say I got it I got it well you know what next year you ain't got him he come up he was hurt I got it I got it well it went on for about four or five years and I can remember and the life that I was his way back at fifty years ago but the life that I've heard about it he stayed well maybe he got enough to keep on believing until something happened to it but my point is you got to start with believing no I just miss the Holy Ghost just fell away there's no such thing show me in the Bible anywhere I've read around this message anywhere that you get to Holy Ghost without first hearing the word I mean without first hearing the word you heard it from somebody so or some something it may have been grandma'll you might have heard her praying you might have hear heard somebody say a word but the words got to be planted first before you can do anything all right are you with me on that point all right see then watch now so then our salvation jump up now to where we are our salvation then is based on if i believing will hold out well you're funny preacher cuz i just everything got no no i'm a firm believer so is your prophet in what three stages of grace justification sanctification and the baptism of the holy ghost that's the new birth without that you don't have the new birth all right is that straight enough to put it and that's worth it Luther talks justification when we talk sanctification the Pentecostals taught the baptism of the Holy Ghost and they received that Holy Ghost with signs and wonders following them sure they cabbage down on the gifts and the things but still they got to the birth when the Prophet came he didn't have to start some new thing right he just preached what they had brought before him was that the way the prophets were posed to be they're supposed to look back what's behind him and the previous and what it spoke up I mean all we Old Testament are new or whatever and then lay their foundation upon what was behind her before them so brother Branham he knew that this the plan of salvation was justification same case in the baptismal oligos now you can go through that at one time in the altar praying before God but I'll quote the Prophet back to you he said very few will do that so most of them are going to be kind of like me good old Baptist Deacon hood serving God preaching I mean teaching adults and everything else and then come in this message and I found out I was a baby that needed salvation well you come into message didn't you yeah but I still had that mass in me and so did you okay no I got rid of everything you just lied so you need to repent of that one but listen see then you've got to believe in justification st. casein of apt ISM holders to come out to the new world because they know shortcuts all right and in doing that it starts when you believe and that's what I've tried to teach you all the way through the old test everything was on the basis of what they could blade and it's on the basis for you once you can believe but if you're believing stops or you let something enter enter there and caused you problems and you're believing then is it your father God's fault that you fall away now you know yourself don't kid with me and I won't we you we just talk plain that's the way I am blunt out of all the millions of so-called Christians you know they're not Christians right you know the basis everyone we're not born again Christian no that's no problem that's just truth because they have a form of godliness but that's all they have they just have a believing form of that they don't continue oh you say well how can you say that Hank say it because all you got to go do is go present the word to them and when you present the word to them and they don't accept it then you'll find out if they've got a problem in what they're believing but we shouldn't have the problem in our believing well brother Dan we're born-again Christians we've been in the message in a long time why are you preaching to us that you need to be born again because you need to be born again right cuz if you ain't born again you need to be born again know that solve the problem see this left into your hands whether or not your boy again and everybody as I said this morning has some reason or thought or something basing it of why they believe they're saved well see then that everything that my statements are make everything that you could think of to try to prove that you're saved Satan can impersonate every one of them and is that true I mean you see how did you cried you spoken oh you don't know Satan can impersonate everyone there's only one thing that Satan cannot impersonate nice I said this morning I know what the Prophet said about he said he can't be the holy ghost that started he can't be God we got that straight now but now what is it that he came that he can't do that God can do and you and I can do what is the thing that he and he can't do but you and I can do that God can do believe the word right to believe the word there's your evidence of the Holy Ghost whether or not the spirit in you agrees with the word now watch what it says LaRon didn't say the Holy Ghost in you agreeing with the word or agreed it's agrees it means continue home right if your experience ever stops you got a problem now anything you let get in your way to colleges to stop he's automatically bigger than you are that's one thing I had to settle in the Baptist Church because I had too many problems in front of me because I was 18 years old and and I knew the church in the situation's and and I knew the Deacons that the claim was running around and and everything else I knew the whole ins and out of the church well I had to get that thing out from in front of me before I could even consider about God see so I had to dump that get it away so let's dump all of our thoughts get it out and no matter what anybody's done the message what they're gonna do or anything like it ain't got nothing to do about your salvation in mind now then we can put it on believe in God's Word well I Adam as we said was God's example all right then when it come forth and men came into a lost condition now you got Abel and Cain right and you got it based upon what you need if Adam and Eve had a stayed with God's Word now am i right they had to word to be behind all right when he got out of them behind that word she failed you know what Adam had to get out from behind - we can puff him up all we want - he still went out right all right but see then you start with mankind and you start with Abel by revelation seeing the salvation of that day would be based upon his believing that he was born in his mother's blood from his daddy's blood and he could see what had happened in the garden all right then he knew there was only one way to approach back to that Garden of Eden to talk about salvation was what drew the blood of bulls and goats so he knew it was the blood that brought him out and he knew there was no way to bring him back when God revealed to Abel that it was blood all right that put the whole basis of salvation based upon blood so that put the whole Old Testament based upon the blood right believing that that blood atonement was for them okay all right then when you come to the New Testament you come to Jesus Christ it was not the blood of an animal it was the blood of Almighty God that would come to shed - life the soul that was in that could come back on the believer cause the animal didn't now no soul huh God having a soul he could release that soul and that soul could come back in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost all right now when that came into that being then he now you've come to kind of where we stopped that go to review this quick second then your disciples three and a half years it took them to walk through justification and sanctification am i right three and a half years that they walk with the Lord Jesus they were good believers but they were believers unto they did not have eternal life why because the Bible said that Jesus had not been glorified so the Holy Ghost had not been given you can say what I think is this I don't care that's nothing to me you think what you want to understand with the Bible because the Bible says that you know what you can't do it all right now we're gonna get into some now stating it or that no man can call Jesus or say that Jesus is a Christ without the Holy Ghost now let's hold on to that thought in point for a minute all right see then we'll we'll see that it's still based on faith because what was our final points this morning we'll pick up right there where was that what was the final points from this morning now that we were talking about okay I showed you where I'm a firm believer in the basis that justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost makes the new birth no I've always believed this that's I've heard the message the new birth the born-again experience and the baptism of the Holy Ghost is one of the sign now don't say well one of them is a starting here and then this and comes in and goat here and this one goes dire in front if you want that you go with it I'm just I'm not too interested in that I'm interested in one time because they're the same thing and I gave you two quotes where brother branham mentions the new birth the born-again experience the baptism when the whole goes in one paragraph right and gave it to you out of a message of hearing recognizing and acting on the Word of God did he brings the baptism of the Holy Ghost the new birth and all and he brings them all into one statement that they were filled with the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit is the new birth alright now we went from there to show you he kept the same line as he comes on the end of the message further over and we got on to the message God's provided way for this day 1964 where he's talking about by the baptism of the Holy Ghost then and the new birth no.not and like something jointed know it being the new birth and being born again with the Holy Ghost God brings us into the new birth alright see like I said this morning and I know I've got the human mind I have one it don't work too good but it still does but it's not too hard to talk about the new birth being you know in believing it and things and especially when you talk about it being you got a new birth you can kind of look at that and comprehend it alright but then when you start to talking about the born-again experience you can kind of handle that but the hardest thing for the human mind is to comprehend I said comprehend because we're gonna get into it it's got to be revealed to you we're gonna get into that it's got to be revealed to you but to try to comprehend that the baptism of the Holy Ghost is not signs and wonders we spent the whole time this morning I'm talking about the baby gets here the baby cries right the shouting of speaking in tongues the things you call your experience that's not your experience your experience is the birth and brother branham said I'll give it to you what he said the mystery of this endtime age was one time was receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit without a sensation you remember that incident I gave about the man that found the track you know where were you spend eternity he goes through all of his life spins all of his money sells everything he's got trying to pay the preachers get him to help him and none of them couldn't have him he finally comes to brother Branham he had been through the Lutheran's he had been through the Methodists he had been through the Pentecostals and done everything they told him to do but he wasn't satisfied and he come to brother Branham and brother Branham said you don't need he said you pray for me brother Branham he said you don't need me to pray for you he said the word has already set you free he said you mean I had it all the time he said yes now what he had when he started you can argue what you walk till I ain't gonna argue it I know one thing about it he started believing because he showed his believing because he went on to the next step the next step the next step spend every dime of money he had he said that he had a half a million dollars in the car business it wound up with a clunker car a truck or something but there he was the whole time seeking for God and had had him maybe it took all of that time to bring the man to the position of believing that God is real I don't know that's human God I just know that happened but now listen also I've never taught it and I never found runaround you show me brother round them ever saying you could receive the new birth without an experienced Sumi he said anything about the baptism of the whole to go without an experience show me anything about a born-again experience without an experience there's a vast difference in the word experience and sensation sensation is a stimulation upon your fleshly items talking doing you know anything shouting crying an experience is something you lived through go look it up in the dictionary it's something you go through and do you remember going through the experience that's all I've asked you remember your experience you've heard mine over and over I didn't take it in his 11 years old that I saw God in the Baptist Church then in that I didn't take that as a new birth I didn't take it as a new birth when they gave me the job as a deacon in a Baptist Church at 23 years of age I didn't take it at all of the things that I saw God in those days because when I heard runaround I'm talking about a baptism of the holy go I knew I didn't have what he's talking about yet I had done all the things but I didn't have what he's talking about heart and God had to come and settle that with me as a revelation from God's Word and then when he brought it to that basis and brother said brother mote told me said you got to believe that God is his word in him and his word as one he said you accept that word and when I did that was all I needed right we ended up talking about experience a little bit this morning of where God speaks to you speaks to you by revelation well God ain't never spoke to me see that's what you what I didn't hear it repeat that again no that's not the kind of hearing from God that I'm talking about I'm talking about the Prophet that said which one was it Elisha which one were he went into the cave one of the prophets you know and all he did have the rain and had to shower had to Thunder it had to lightning that everything and he didn't get up and walk out but finally little steel small voice words of still small voice Oh sitting over in the corner hey prophet get it no it was inside him he was inside of him in his being his sold his person of who he is you said you make it could be in his shoulder today yeah why not well wouldn't you think it would be in his soul at that time I'm talking about a thought I'm not talking about something that made him a born-again believer in the body of Christ I'm talking about a thought I'm talking about something that and you've got to get that settle that doubt to come into your mind that comes into your being that you're not afraid of nobody have you ever been that or you're not afraid I quote was run around him but I'd do it if God told me to go tell him what George Washington's gonna raise the dead I'd go to Washington or everywhere he's at my because I believe it he spoke to me and many times and told me things we've had those experiences its own record where I called for rained one time to come it hadn't rained in months and all that once I see you better get out to roll your windows up it rained like everything there's a way this month October I mean the August that was on record and Gainesville was also said to him Carlton to stop the rain I've had God to speak to him and I come tell you well that's not putting it to try to make me something footing that to make God something what are we going to start believing what he says but you see that's our problem he speaks to us and then we begin to doubt or listen we'll do this way we'll go to somebody and say you know the Lord spoke to me and they say we don't believe in in God speaking to nobody anymore but to brother Branham did God spoke to brother Brent we're talking about getting it we ain't talking about getting the Word of God the Word of God come to the Prophet not everyday life to the Prophet could if he wanted to but the Word of God the revelation of the Word of God comes to the Prophet but why can't it be that way why can't gifts operate to where he could say speak through one person and say get out of Loula cause the mark two o'clock is gonna blow away and it happened why can't we believe that while we can't we accept God speaking to us because we're going to get just a little further we're going to get into the basis of whether or not you can believe that not only that God speaks to you but how that he takes you and it speaks through you oh we got a long ways to go ahead all right but listen what is the new birth what is the born-again experience what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I said it's easy to talk about the new birth they're born again but when you say baptism you're thinking about something that comes down out of heaven well read the book of Acts he said the room was filled but nobody get they didn't get the Holy Ghost from the room feel the wind follow in right read your Bible what happened tongues of fire set on each one of them your prophet said that was God dividing himself what was the new birth on the day of Pentecost not the rushing mighty wind some of you know the story of brother Adam was standing really lavell was listening to him the other day on a testimony he said he was there and brother on his clothes was moving and things and the wind went through the belly but you know what it never mentioned boy nobody that are getting born here butter on him never mentioned nobody they're getting morning you you understand you understand what I'm getting at the new birth we will eventually - it is the birth of the word now you tell me anything that is not it's the birth of the word see it's not when you believe this message it's when this message is revealed to you that there's no doubts in your heart what is there so I don't care what they talk about i 200 in Arizona about the he was out there on the wrong date and this date and that date I don't care I didn't care years ago but the thing of it was don't were here was here then when those things they came out in nineteen about seventy that that discrepancy was out there it's not this new point they came out with a discrepancy about the dates I told him in I don't care ain't got nothing do with dates well brother Brennan said if you catch me wrong in one place I'm wrong in all of it well now what are you gonna do answer me what are you gonna do did Brett around make that statement he said if I'm wrong in one place I'm wrong in all of it did he make the statement at least somebody should do or whatever brother Donnie Reagan says that means a man I'm just asking for a truth in you what you see that's were you're thinking then runs you the wrong way because you say brother branham was wrong show me where he was wrong now I know he made human error mistake seven hundred seven thousand that's human error don't talk to me about little Petey Patti doctor and I did come bring me something show me where he changed his doctrine from the beginning to the end tell me anywhere changed it I know where you going I know what your mind hooked on especially out there there's a lot of you here know one where I'm going when brother branham talked at the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost you just remember one time no profit no one knew that mystery until that day it was revealed to him are you with me well then was he wrong when he said to hot horse rider was a holy go words yes but nobody could correct him Clarence Larkin talked to white horse rider was the antichrist way before brother Branham ever come alone with Clarence Larkin with no profit ain't no no message I'm putting you here come show me where brother Branham was wrong now he made human errors and speeches thoughts and things yes but you come to show me you better come prepared like that he said well he talked to heart horse rider long well you didn't know about the white horse rider and nobody out didn't know about it until God revealed it to the Prophet so nobody was responsible for that you can't say he was wrong you see that's what I'm not liked because that's where I stand well now bread run said silly little human statements and letting that rest tell me where he changed his doctrine now listen I'll show you where he progressed in his doctrine right I'll show you where he covered adoption in 50 he come up in the sick of 55 to hit here you him then he comes on up then he hits the statue of a perfect man but that's growth development that's not changing this doctor I want to show me where change this doctor I didn't mean to get into that with this that's just plain enough because listen we got to the point this morning or saying what what is the new birth hey what is the new birth and I've already made mistake much their way I believe it no mountain earthing but I still the way I believe it I don't matter me I put it out why don't you put it out that's where the problem I don't that's where they would go see they'll get out in there go around over here and they'll say I kind of believe it's this way well why don't you go tell brother no he wouldn't understand me and he would you done put it out you doesn't got your mouth ruined and got it among the congregation that you don't agree when I come sit down let's see what it is come on I admit one time I I did we was preaching with my mom Daniel said anyway and I did wait a whole bunch of preachers but 20 of them I guess I said I wish to goodness that she would come and tell me that I'm wrong now you'll go home and tell everybody else I said I'd like to have a raise of hands how many of you in here would say I'm wrong on the Daniel 70 weeks one man raised his hand I said brother I appreciate that I don't I appreciate it at least he said he didn't agree you know what the rest I'm done you know run all over the country all right but listen let's get into it we've come up to the stage of the new birth or come up to the place that we talk about Jesus Christ being a deliverer being the one that paid the price and all like that and he had to give his life to release the life to be able to come back into us to give us the new work that's why the apostles were three and a half years in the stating of it but never received the Holy Ghost until after Jesus Christ was crucified and the Holy Ghost came back onto that Pentecost and that Holy Ghost was their new birth which was their born-again experience which was the back tear them of the Holy Ghost on the day of Pentecost right okay they don't pull over too far just hang with me let's think about something all right let's make sure brother branham answers it to her then we don't have any trouble go to number 11 now we're gonna have to jump 7-eleven back interval go to number 11 which is Christ the mystery of God revealed most of you know how I've stood on this for 40-something years and I still stand on it could I believe it look Christ in you makes him the center of the rely for the revelation see Christ's life in you makes him the center of the revelation Christ in the Bible makes the Bible the complete revelation of Christ Christ in you makes you the complete revelation of the whole thing see what God is trying to do you know it brother Brown said either he said the Holy Ghost or what did he says not complete without you why because it's in you right it's in you it's in you it's in you so you're not complete he's divided himself out he's completing all of us well look what is the new birth in you'd say well wrote around now this 1963 well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen see not you joined a church you shook a hand are you done something different then the words take out all that I done this or do do whatever the Dunn's and that's what he's putting in there right you shook a hand you done something different you said a creek you promised to live by a code of rules but Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you now when you receive what you call your experience or the baptism of the Holy Ghost was there revelation involved if not come on you need me to say it if the new birth is a revelation and you didn't get a new revelation what did you get well you you just show me cuz I got this I don't yeah I may I quote you now quote the Prophet when the guy said to him he said I can't believe it because of Revelation he said it wasn't made for you he said when made for unbelievers well I don't remember well then maybe you didn't see I know that's what I told you this is going to empty the church or gonna make us one we're doing one of the other in the next little while so all right well I don't remember when I anything happened when I got the new birth except I walked up shook the hand with a preacher and said I believe it all right I hope that's right I'm alone but if you didn't get a revelation I didn't make it well what do you mean wrote okay let's keep reading I don't know come on up to 35 what is it what is the new birth it's Christ being revealed and he is the word and when the word is revealed it expresses itself see that's God's purpose for Christ Jesus was to express himself to take it on laws and live by his laws and fulfill that by dying and the death and thing - what - the glorious bride redeemed back that will believe only in the we're gonna redeem back that will believe on the end the Word of God and not slop it like Eve did for intellectual conception as a man you see that cross the idea that's God's idea the new birth reveals you reveals this yeah but I've never had this and I've never had that I've never heard the voice of God and I don't believe in nobody hearing voice oh God but but the prophet well then you're sure cutting off the entire Bible okay go ahead to the next one this is still right in Christ from history the new birth is Christ is a revelation God has revealed to you this great mystery what's the great mystery all God woods he put in the cross all Christ in the church and took her back to the Garden of Eden is that the mystery when he's revealed old but brother daily I could only come up here now it's got to start down here and then it grows up desire it starts down here right this is a revelation of Jesus Christ and grows up here any problem with that God is revealed to you this great mystery and that's a new birth now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the revelation is perfectly in harmony and God expressing it through his word by the same actions the same things that he did making his word manifest or if the church only knew its position it will one day then the rapture will go when it knows what it is now evidently he caught a little unbelief somewhere right and evidently he picked up a little unbelief comes what's then the rapture will go when it knows what it is now notice you say brother branham but that ain't what's he saying he said when the bride all gets the same revelation and it's revealed to her then there's going to be a rapture he said you say that ain't he said oh yes it is - it's the truth right continue on still from cross the mystery now listen to what he says he's talking about do you know I'm believing God and then any real true believer that means you're just that much farther away and you backed off in other words art is not known by education he is not known by how to explain it how is God known now listen I'm trying to show you a point so listen I asked the question when you receive the new birth the God speak to your heart a revelation I asked that simple question this is the answer to the question you think it's got to be this got to be that let's see what it is God is not known about how to explain God is known by simplicity and the revelation of Jesus Christ to the most illiterate person see not your theology it's a revelation of Jesus Christ on this rock I'll be on my shirt the most illiterate person a child that has not developed in mind it's called the illiterate a 90 years old hundred years old if they're illiterate they're illiterate right because it means with a small amount of mental ability to believe and communicate and do and times right so you know what God can come down to the most illiterate little child and speak to their heart in that little child as long as it gets in this mind that I need to ask Jesus Christ to come into my heart and God comes into that heart what is the revelation to the little feller or girl one of them what is the revelation you are my child you've accepted me as your Savior and I've accepted you because remember that is a point right you remember you can say I accepted Jesus Christ but now can I quote the Prophet thank you he said but has Christ accepted your confession now what if you're confessing to be three guards or some kind of outlandish idea is he going to accept that all right so what is the new birth it's a revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you not you join the church not you Dunning anytime it's a revelation personally to you let me see if I can run fast go to number seven let's pick up a few quotes and and then we'll get to it cuz I don't don't want to just put it in 63 and put it and say the Prophet said this and you say what I just one message so we're going through the whole message 30 something whoa okay we go sit on this is going to you keep up with where the dates are and sin we see when he's saying this time we're gonna go through from here to here and see what he's saying cuz listen so if you just only got a mental conception of the Bible if you say well I believe it because I read it God's got to reveal it to you by your heart no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit we're gonna read one after a while where he says no man can call Jesus Christ without the baptism of the Holy Spirit but I'm gonna say it right here at front no man can call Jesus the Christ unless the Christ is in you speaking we're gonna end that in a hurry okay can I quote the Bible they don't have these so just hold on Matthew 19 Matthew 10 19 and when they deliver you up take no thought how or what you shall speak where it shall be given you in that same hour what you shall speak okay hey they picked it up all right now pick up the next one go to Matthew mark 13 and 11 so we'll have that one huh you put it on another mark but when they cells marker let the 13 11 when they shall lead you and deliver you up same basic thought here don't watch what he said take no thought beforehand what you shall speak neither do you premeditate but whatsoever shall be given you in that hour that speak II for it is not ye that speak but the Holy Ghost it's the Holy Ghost that does it speaking so now the difference between justification sanctification the baptism there we go it's you talking a justification of sanctification but when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost it's not you talking is him talking now let me I'll put it this way if I go out and blab something that ain't right it ain't him is that it clear enough if I blab something that ain't right it ain't him well brother Lu said that was God well I just lied if it wasn't but I also know that even baby Balaam prophesied of the coming of the Lord am i right Balaam a false prophet it's written in God's Word what he said about God Balaam so God can use a dumbass to speak he did through the Prophet to tell him that he's gonna kill him he didn't stand back from that all right let's continue on go to number 8 brother the power of the devil is the title of the message 55 jesus said except a man be born again he cannot understand the kingdom of heaven now chose these because of different wording not just to get this word up here different wordings brings better thoughts than just reading one talk he cannot understand the kingdom of heaven except a man be born again there's no way of understanding it until you're born again then God reveals himself to you and then you know what your Pais you know that you've passed from death unto life because no man can call Jesus Christ only by the Holy Spirit so you know you've pipes because of what's happening if something inside of you speaking the only way that you'll ever know that Jesus is the Christ is when the Holy Spirit personally witnesses to you that he is the resurrected Lord Jesus they ever spoke to you anything never spoke to you about the resurrection in him saying no matter what he would do what kind of signs what kind of miracles you'll never know it until your personal experience with God good point right go ahead earnestly contending for the faith Paul were down here in the natural realm with a PhD and he didn't know he had an intellectual faith but he didn't have a divine faith there's quite a difference in me having an intellectual faith than a divine faith there's were you my Baptist friends failed to go on you get the intellectual faith by that but it must be a divine revelation of Jesus Christ to you that just came out that Christ to you that just came out of the heart the intellectual faith is not enough that's alright but it only brings you to the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit is a personal experience of the birth the new birth regeneration making a new creature in Christ 55 he's still going huh Patmos vision 1960 now ask God what we're talking on Revelation ask him to give you a revelation of this where can only be known by revelation you can only be saved by revelation so then why wouldn't your thoughts be then when the Prophet would say the new birth is revelation Jesus Christ personally to you why would you not want to get into that to see that I can go home today and I can read the Bible and God can speak to me and you know what that's more than my life what he reveals to me is part of my life it's part of something happening he's revealing this after me why is it would to be any problem with it to believe that the new birth the morning any experience the baptism of the Holy Ghost would be a revelation to you remember Jesus talking to the disciples he said when he the Holy Ghost has come he'll bring to your remembrance whatsoever I say it putting two scriptures together and brother branham's wording and said even teach you things to come brother in cities not only brought through there what he had said but he said taught him greater things right well why don't you want to believe that the new birth is a revelation I thought we believe that the new birth was a birth of the word that's what I've always taught you that's what I've always believed the new birth is the birth of the word you go into the Gospels with that and the son of man is the only store of the seed and he sowed you and some kept the word some understood the word I'm giving you two or three marks into the Gospels but then the Holy Ghost came and quickened that word to those disciples the next message I don't got it because when they got to the day of Pentecost what'd he say he said this is that that was revealed to the prophets and what you have a knowledge of it you can only be saved by revelation you have a knowledge of it intellectually but you can't be saved until it's revealed to you no man can call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Ghost can I reinstate a word and I said want to know I had druther have as my experience something that I can remember when he spoke to my heart and called me to him and I fathered him I didn't have the sensation got it now the manifestation I just followed him man said nothing I'm funny unknown I'm carnal about the way I think but now let's do it like this you know here's Peter and James and John and and he goes over to Peter and he says come follow me now he didn't sit down with him and spend three weeks now I want to explain to you what I'm gonna do and we're gonna do this we're gonna go through this we're gonna do this we're gonna go through then then you're gonna finally get to believe in it he says come follow me James come follow me he never explained what he wanted him to do he never gave him a great thing but then when they got with him for three and a half years he explained the kingdom he explained the new birth he explained all of those things to him but they still couldn't understand it until the Holy Ghost came and that's why he said it he said when I come back in other words I'm going away and when I come back as an indwelling in you call remember the teachers inside that when I come back and not dwell in you how brain do you remembers what I've said what a Peter say Peter's in there one of them to you he said yes Peter cuz he said they said what can we do he said I don't know what's going on I don't understand all they've done the one thing for sure this is that I like brother branham's on that don't you if this ain't that I'll just stay with this you've gone to all yo - she wants to I'm just gonna stay with this huh so half of word we get - he cannot understand the kingdom of God all right we're still on the Patmos vision that's what the Bible says no man can say Jesus is the Christ until he has received the Holy Ghost and what are you doing he might say the pastor said so the Bible says so they were truth the church says so that is true but you don't know yourself until the Holy Ghost has revealed it to and he's become in you it's an inside teacher right come on I don't mind quote in the scripture it's an inside teacher said you don't need one teach you I scripture said you don't need me then now we've got their answer to that right we Baptist we had an argument over that we don't need teaching so brother they're your teacher so we don't need your ministry we'll get these others you know something like it I'm 77 years old but I still have a memory no man could call Jesus of Christ only by the Holy Ghost not by knowledge not by intellectual now that word we get to okay jump over now and we'll get to get to number 14 what they're doing good that's when the master called faith 1950 say and if you've never had the Holy Spirit no man can even call Jesus the Christ only by the Holy Spirit oh you say but you might say the preachers hit I read in the Bible that's all true but that don't but you don't know it yourself until you've experienced the Bible said that you can't know that Jesus is the Christ only by the Holy Spirit that's right that's truth okay then we went through 14 or did we pick back up yeah 15 infallible proof of the resurrection when the blood of blood sale of Emanuel was broken then his spirit the life that was in the blood sale of Emmanuel returns back which is none other than the Holy Spirit itself now may I quote brother Branham he said he sent back his soul in the form of the baptism the ghost that comes and dwells in each one of us diversity new birth the new birth is Christ coming in you and living outwardly okay and the work for shipper once with the Holy Spirit in him his heart becomes changed now not from an intellectual view of the Bible or a concept or in Crete but from an experience they don't change this Creed's and ideas with an experience when we're witness of the resurrection you know that your resurrection is inside of you you have the new birth today your resurrection is inside of you where's it coming from if it not in you you're my witnesses after the Holy Spirit is come upon you not until the Holy Spirit comes where they were witnesses they could not witness until the Holy Spirit for he is the witness the Bible says no man can call Jesus to cry only by the Holy Spirit what about it what about it how about me just cutting off and picking up next Sunday right where we left off so musicians come on while they're coming let me emphasize or a reenter rate or at what some great words are for let me go back over a little I like to do that because see people get lost in what you're saying because their mind is running on one channel and you say something and that mind hooks it on to that channel and you don't even her hear what the person says now I'm 77 years old and I know that when I fifteen you ought to know it now you or talk to somebody named looking dead at you you ever talk to them them looking dead after you just talking away and they're looking right in your own eyes and you turn walk on this what you say I'm hear a word you say right see what you talking about I didn't hear you say that why cause the mind blocked out but remember the point you cannot call Jesus the Christ unless it be by the baptism of the Holy Spirit not what somebody up says and I'll listen not what brother Branham said not what the Bible says not what God says right but then the key to the whole thing is the inward experience putting the Holy Spirit inside of you and we read it from Mark then it's not you but it's the Holy Spirit in you speaking out as I said while ago he could come back and you think we don't look at the Old Testament as God being able to use there but he entered into to David and he'd say they pierced my hands and my feet right preaching exactly Jesus Christ and what would happen but you know what he also as I said while ago spoke through Balaam and spoke to the coming of Jesus Christ why because the inside of the man wouldn't drive but David knew those people back dark thinks you just see that Old Testament we should think a little that that long in within man's heart to know about God and you know what the Bible says he said I'm sick of your your sacrifices and your offerings and now I'm quoting scripture he said what a man with an honest and a contrite heart what was David an adulteress of murderer but only his way home from the bed of Bathsheba brother Branham says if Scofield gives it to you on his way home from the bed of Bathsheba he's crying out return unto me the joy in other words come Lord and do something for me I can't help these things there's tildes they're coming back I can get rid of them for while I can move out into anointings and dying but I cannot keep it it just floats away from me don't you understand yet he could prophesy exactly like they pierce my till a man over and what is it only in the book of Acts and he was referring back he said is this man talking about himself or another till David was so much he's speaking the first person yet he couldn't be warned again because Jesus Christ had not died may I quote brother Branham he said if he could do those things back daraa what about under the baptism of the Holy Ghost in the New Testament can you say that Jesus Christ is in you then there's one thing for surely we can't do we can't turn down the word yeah but I don't believe you brought the word with no problem cuz that ain't mine I'm just asking you a simple little thought you might have been 10 11 years old a lot of you was when you said you receive the new birth and I believe in that you didn't have to have this great revelation or the deity of Jesus Christ being this that or the other but you had a revelation at one time if it was genuine you had a revelation that you've lost you had a thought coming in you mentally that you was lost you got it from somebody and hearing it and you said you've lost and then you went to the altar and said I want to accept Jesus Christ as my savior I believe in that I believe that happened I believe it happens right over there in that church I believe it happens in the Baptist cemented discipline a call from the Catholics and evidence that a child can come to a basis of understanding that you need to be saved we've listened to Billy Graham the other day and brother Branham on the you know the testimonies I and brother Owen said ain't nobody the message of salvation no greater than Billy Graham because he could just stand right there and he could bring 500,000 people I was listening to him in one place I didn't think he was that spiritual I'm not saying I'm wrong about him just saying the truth but he said I announced when I came here he's gonna be there like a couple of weeks you know for the campaign he said they won't let me close he said I went back to the board and asked him and he said today he said we'll be here through the month of August he could bring the gospel to get people to make a committed commitment of accepting Jesus Christ but what did he say they just wouldn't anybody to take it on any further because why they went back to their church that next week and they said we'd like to know more about yourself we got it when you believe what do you want see blind to poor people I never will forget brother mo what he was saying to come with you Stan he said you know what kind of a main person kind of talking off on Joyce in Holland they know about him but he said uh he he told me one time he said he said I got saved and he said I thought everybody in the communities want to go want to know that early smoked got saved he said I went around and told them people that I got say he said they wasn't too happy you know what that means don't you if you really get saved you're gonna lose your buddies and they're not happy cuz you lose them right but think about it what about your experience I'm not talking about God coming down in revealing great seals and plagues and trumpets and vials and time that was revealed to the Prophet but he can reveal to you said this morning but that was god what can't you take that is something I'd rather have that than all experiences are shouting speaking in - you understand what I'm talking not woody many would like to had to experience I had at 11 years old to see God in a church but when I saw this message and what I didn't in the babies I didn't count that my salvation but there's no way you can talk me out of that but you see if your experience stops then there's something wrong with your experience you go so far down the road and then you backslide there's something wrong something's wrong no salvation is supposed to carry us through go ahead what would God [Music] and I began to cry in my mind by anybody have a need [Music] [Applause] beep with it what is it I feel cool what about it me feeling I [Music] I know [Music] preparation probably maybe two feet so let's just pray with him that everything will be all right don't know exactly what they're gonna do but let's just believe believe it everything would be okay father we thank you Lord Jesus for your love and your grace father we ask you to just reach down and touch our brothers whatever this that they're planning that it'll all turn out to be perfect and right and we ask you to just bypass all of it and healing we believe you and we thank you in Jesus name anybody else [Music] speak to me please [Music] - a testimony of brother Charlie cogs and he was testifying about the things Charlie come collins wilbur college and he was testifying about some of the things you know and he testified of his own that it happened this two-year to ago and he was talking about that he was going across a road with his daughter and everything and he fell they took him to the hospital and the doctors came in and they were done all of their things and he said he hooked up i they hit tickle that him cuz he's 91 years old and his mind is so sharp but he said they put them things on me and said it's shooting out papers and there's written in papers and he said the doctor told him said you you've had a massive heart attack and said you don't preach you don't drive you don't do none of these times i said you've had a massive set all the tests shows and everything and he said i don't know how long he went but anyhow he had to go back and he went to a they sent him from that place to a hospital maybe his wet-look and he got over there and this doctor came in this was a jew doctor here i remember that and he seemed over here to another one and he running through in the doctor crazy hey if they weren't wrong with you he gave him he said i give in the stack of things that showed what was wrong he said he gave me a stack of things doing what it wasn't nothing wrong and he said that doctor said well i don't understand it he said we put you two they put him through even catch scans and and all kind of things he couldn't find a thing in the world they seemed back to that jewish doctor in
