[3:25] sister cleta has a testimony but I'm

[3:28] to her
[3:56] but anyway to spend over at least 25 or
[4:00] over 25 years ago
[4:02] it's putting Grace in the yard anyway I
[4:04] had to have gas and I had put my
[4:07] pocketbook uh purse up on top of the car
[4:11] at the side of the driver's seat
[4:14] well when I went back
[4:16] to get the call it was gone and I just
[4:19] assumed that when I went to get the guys
[4:22] that it had fell off to the right side
[4:25] and I had around seven hundred dollars
[4:28] in there and part of it was my parents
[4:29] money
[4:30] to buy groceries and pay the bills
[4:33] and I was in the house fixing to lay
[4:35] down I thought well I'll never see that
[4:36] no more
[4:38] and up come a car and I looked it was a
[4:41] DVD and I said where did you find it at
[4:44] it was all over half a mile
[4:47] up the road
[4:49] and I put it on the driver's seat
[4:52] and it was on the right hand side and I
[4:56] didn't even know there was a little road
[4:57] went into a subdivision
[4:59] and this gentleman come and he said he
[5:02] was a pastor of a Baptist Church and he
[5:05] saw it set laying in the road and laying
[5:07] in the driveway there
[5:09] and he said the thought just come to his
[5:11] mind but what if your wife had lost her
[5:13] beautiful what would you do
[5:15] so he brought it back to me
[5:18] and I thought that had to be the hand of
[5:20] the Lord I would have thought that way
[5:23] or fell off this way because when I went
[5:25] looking for it I was looking for it this
[5:26] way
[5:27] and it slid over that way and fell just
[5:30] to the right place
[5:31] thanks so many things that maybe would
[5:34] kind of take
[5:35] you know
[5:36] or maybe I do

[23:20] that's just 30 Souls
[23:25] it's good to hear that God's doing
[23:28] something isn't it
[23:29] [Music]
[23:31] you know uh sometimes you can get a
[23:34] little bit afraid to give a testimony
[23:36] you know there's that the devil put in
[23:38] your mind you better not give a
[23:39] testimony because I'm gonna get upset
[23:43] you know you know there's some things
[23:45] that you got to be careful about you
[23:46] give a testimony on the arm of man like
[23:48] boy my kids are perfect kids are perfect
[23:52] you better you better watch out
[23:55] you are in for some trouble then but now
[23:58] don't be afraid to give a testimony on
[24:00] what God has done
[24:02] because you know there's a promise that
[24:04] the devil can't do nothing to you if
[24:07] that God don't allow you remember job
[24:09] had a hedge around him that the devil
[24:12] couldn't do one thing unless God pulled
[24:14] that hedge back so don't be afraid to
[24:17] give a testimony on that account
[24:19] don't be afraid to give a testimony on
[24:21] any account
[24:23] we should if you do if you take any Step
[24:26] In Fear then you're you're uh off
[24:30] balance we should perfect love cast out
[24:33] all fear don't be afraid
[24:36] well that this afternoon I want to speak
[24:38] uh you know you know the pattern we we
[24:40] have a lot of people here on on Sunday
[24:42] morning so we do evangelizing in the
[24:44] morning and teaching in the afternoon
[24:47] so the afternoons where you got more
[24:50] more of the the ones that kind of want
[24:52] some uh you know well just big and
[24:54] plainly maybe want some more word or
[24:56] whatever so we'll
[24:58] we'll do that so we're trying to trying
[25:00] to meet that need
[25:02] so we're going to turn to Hebrews
[25:03] chapter one and we'll read from Genesis
[25:06] chapter one as well so let's just go to
[25:09] the author Lord we're so grateful to be
[25:10] able to gather around your word Lord and
[25:12] look into these things look into your
[25:14] promises the Lord once more and I pray
[25:15] God that you'll just Lord let the words
[25:17] that are said be edifying to your people
[25:19] Lord that it'll give them strength Lord
[25:20] and certainly we won't strengthen this
[25:22] hour we want our faith to be built up
[25:24] Lord God to a place where we don't have
[25:26] any trouble receiving and believing the
[25:28] things that you promised Lord and help
[25:30] us Lord Jesus tonight help us this
[25:32] afternoon Lord Lord you'll you'll give
[25:34] us access into these promises and into
[25:36] these Mysteries we ask in your name
[25:38] bless your people we pray in your name
[25:40] thank you
[25:42] so I want to speak on a little topic of
[25:44] kind of strange separator to Unity that
[25:46] those seem like opposed opposing uh
[25:49] things ideas but um you know before God
[25:53] can unite us together he calls us to be
[25:55] separated separated from the world and
[25:57] and a lot of times separated from from
[26:00] your friends and your family and so that
[26:02] he can deal with you alone and as he's
[26:04] dealing with you alone then he's he's
[26:05] bringing us all back together uh to to
[26:08] his word so let's just read in in
[26:11] chapter Hebrews chapter 1 verses one to
[26:13] three it says God who has sundry times
[26:15] and is dying in diverse manner speaking
[26:18] time past unto the fathers by the
[26:19] prophets hath in these last days spoken
[26:22] unto us by his son whom he hath
[26:23] appointed heir of All Things by whom
[26:26] also he made the worlds who being the
[26:28] brightness of his glory and the express
[26:31] image of his person now we're going to
[26:34] tie that together with Genesis 1 26 27
[26:36] and upholding All Things by the word of
[26:38] his power when he had by himself purged
[26:40] our sin and sat down on the right hand
[26:42] Majesty on high
[26:44] now Genesis 1 26 27 says
[26:47] when God said let us make man in our
[26:49] image after our likeness
[26:52] and let them have dominion over the face
[26:54] of the sea going over the foul over the
[26:56] air and over the cattle and over all the
[26:58] Earth and over every creeping thing that
[26:59] creepeth upon the Earth
[27:01] so God created man and what image in his
[27:05] own image in the image of God
[27:08] created he him
[27:10] male and female created he them you may
[27:13] be seated the Lord has blessing to the
[27:15] reading of the word
[27:17] now just kind of meditate on these on
[27:20] these scriptures that we just read that
[27:22] in Hebrews 1 Paul is telling us that
[27:25] Jesus Christ was the expressed image of
[27:28] God and then in Genesis 1 26 27 he's
[27:32] talking about that man was made in his
[27:35] own image in the image of God oh to
[27:38] think about now and I'll get him back up
[27:40] as like that that uh the Sunday School
[27:43] lesson that brother Ryan was bringing
[27:44] out this morning that this whole uh in
[27:46] this whole uh the statue of perfect man
[27:48] is an image of of Christ it's actually
[27:51] to express the the deity and the
[27:54] attributes and all of those things in
[27:56] that make up the character of God
[27:58] Express that in a bride and you think
[28:01] about how Hebrews 1 is looking at at
[28:03] Christ and Genesis 1 26 is looking at
[28:07] that pattern that God wanted to take
[28:09] that everything that is in God and put
[28:11] it and through the Holy Ghost into the
[28:13] bride into a people so that so that now
[28:16] just to speak plain so that you and I
[28:18] are actually the the entire bride body
[28:21] together all around the world are the
[28:24] express image of God and you just think
[28:26] now oh if we could just look at the
[28:29] promises that we have sitting here
[28:30] before us that God wants us to be
[28:32] completely United with him that God will
[28:35] want us to be so United with him that
[28:37] that we would have the same
[28:39] characteristics that we would we would
[28:41] think the same to say now to think the
[28:44] same means means you're not going to be
[28:46] one word off there's going to come a
[28:47] bride that won't be one word off she
[28:49] would be so in line with the word that
[28:51] when the Devil comes and tells her it
[28:53] ain't possible it ain't possible to
[28:55] speak squirrels into existence it ain't
[28:57] possible for you to be healed it ain't
[28:59] possible for that little fishy to come
[29:00] back for life it ain't possible for your
[29:02] children to be to come back to to
[29:04] Salvation it ain't possible that that
[29:07] you cast down reason uh and sometimes it
[29:10] maybe seems a little bit Out Of Reach
[29:12] for us but but as we as we eat more and
[29:14] more word you see it begins to take
[29:17] place shape you're uniting with Christ
[29:20] as you're partaking of the word you're
[29:22] with him and he's changing us he's
[29:25] changing us back to the pattern that
[29:26] that Adam and Eve represented there in
[29:29] the garden that situation where the
[29:31] Masterpiece family God and Adam and his
[29:34] bride there in complete Harmony and
[29:36] fellowship where he could come down and
[29:38] talk with them
[29:39] and fellowship with them all together
[29:41] that's why in Ephesians chapter 2 verse
[29:44] 13 and 14 it says but now in Christ
[29:46] Jesus ye who sometimes were far off
[29:48] we've been we were separated from God
[29:50] separated by sin separated by what
[29:53] happened in the garden that we were far
[29:54] off are made nigh by the blood of Christ
[29:57] now we're coming back together again
[29:59] we're being nigh the fellowship that we
[30:01] lost now is coming back together for he
[30:04] is our peace who hath what who hath made
[30:06] both one who and hath broken down the
[30:09] middle wall of partition between us oh
[30:12] thank God that through Christ Jesus that
[30:14] middle wall the Gap that was between us
[30:16] now has been torn down so that we have a
[30:18] blood covering that can bring us back
[30:19] together that God is not looking at our
[30:21] sin anymore that he's able to he's able
[30:23] to come and dwell himself in our and
[30:25] Tabernacle himself in us to bring us
[30:28] back into fellowship with God and the
[30:29] way he does that through the pattern of
[30:31] well first he starts off with your soul
[30:32] and then he begins to align your spirit
[30:35] with your soul so that your spirit's in
[30:37] alignment and your cast down reasonings
[30:38] and then then you get into a place where
[30:40] he can work on your body and reveal to
[30:42] you the full complete Plan of Redemption
[30:44] has been accomplished in you and you're
[30:45] going to take a body change now and and
[30:48] the message um
[30:50] brother I'm kind of preached two
[30:51] messages about Oneness and unity and one
[30:53] was called the Oneness of unity and the
[30:55] other was called just Oneness and then
[30:57] the message is the Oneness of unity he
[30:58] starts talking about talking about the
[31:00] Tower of Babel where they built in
[31:04] Genesis 11 it says the Lord said behold
[31:06] the people is one God looked down to
[31:08] that situation where they they had all
[31:10] got together with their their
[31:11] denominational ideas or intellectual
[31:13] understanding and so forth and they they
[31:15] thought well I'm gonna we're gonna build
[31:17] this big Tower of Babel what do you
[31:20] think that was trying to imitate it was
[31:21] a copy of this and they they started out
[31:24] there we're going to build up a tower
[31:25] that goes real high into the heavens and
[31:26] we'll be able to climb up and get closer
[31:28] to God you're trying to trying to cop
[31:30] you see brother out of the city of God
[31:33] flows the River of Life well out of
[31:35] Babylon out of this Tower of Babel
[31:37] flowed the river Euphrates and see the
[31:38] devil's got a copy of everything and so
[31:41] the Lord said behold the people is one
[31:44] and they all have one language as he
[31:47] looked down and they were all woman but
[31:48] see that's the devil's got his way to
[31:50] get you all won but we don't want that
[31:52] way we don't want to be see maybe
[31:55] sometimes you see people in even in
[31:57] church kind of get confused about how
[31:58] we're supposed to be one that well if we
[32:00] if we can just fellowship or do have a
[32:02] lot of Fellowship then that'll make us
[32:04] all one if we could just get around
[32:05] people that don't believe anything now
[32:07] I'm not against I'm not against
[32:08] witnessing and helping people and
[32:10] encouraging and people that are Sinners
[32:12] Like Jesus would sit down with the
[32:13] Pharisees and and the people that the
[32:16] drunkards and so forth and try to win
[32:18] them to win them to the gospel but I'm
[32:20] not I'm not talking about that but I'm
[32:21] talking about the Oneness that that that
[32:23] that brother Branham and one this that
[32:26] Jesus was trying to get us to is
[32:28] different than that it's different than
[32:30] the Oneness that the devil tries to get
[32:32] you to well we'll just we'll just throw
[32:33] our arms around everything and and and
[32:35] and and it doesn't matter if you're like
[32:37] a transvestite or homosexual or whatever
[32:39] we just we're just saying well we're all
[32:40] you not know you how can two walk
[32:43] together except you be agreed you can't
[32:44] now I see I'm not opposed to witnessing
[32:47] now I'm not I'm not what I'm not talking
[32:49] about but but you you got to be you
[32:52] can't walk together with somebody that
[32:53] don't agree the way that you do
[32:55] and see now the devil has a plan to
[32:57] bring Oneness that I don't want one
[32:59] that's to unite together outside of the
[33:01] word that's to unite us together outside
[33:03] of the world you gotta the plan that God
[33:05] has for us is to be United by the word
[33:07] that each as each individual each oh you
[33:11] look out at this congregation here and
[33:13] each there's all these individuals that
[33:14] are going through their own journey and
[33:16] their own problems and their own
[33:17] problems at work and their own strife
[33:19] and their own family problems and
[33:21] spousal problems and children all the
[33:23] all kind of things everybody as an
[33:25] individual but you see God's working on
[33:27] each individual by themselves and then
[33:30] that as he grows you up in this in
[33:33] stature then he's gonna that's gonna
[33:35] collectively bring us all together
[33:37] because then as a as an individual
[33:39] that's grown up in stature the end you
[33:41] can you really be able to have
[33:43] fellowship with one another where you
[33:44] you really be able to put up with one
[33:46] another and have patience with one
[33:48] another and Temperance says we're kind
[33:49] of we're being honed together and joined
[33:52] together by the word not by man's ideas
[33:55] but by the way word of God having an
[33:57] effect in our lives individually now
[34:00] that's God's perfect plan for Oneness
[34:03] now brother around said now the first
[34:05] man and first woman in the Garden of
[34:07] Eden was in perfect harmony with God
[34:09] so much oh you think about this now so
[34:12] much that God could come down at any
[34:14] time he desired and talk lip to ear with
[34:17] Adam and Eve any time God wanted to talk
[34:20] to them they were ready to listen and
[34:23] they were willing to lend their ear to
[34:26] what God had to say is could we say that
[34:28] if if God tells us to turn aside and
[34:29] witness to this person stop stop go over
[34:32] here do you know are we in that same
[34:34] kind of condition that's what God wants
[34:36] us to do he wants us to be like like
[34:38] brother Brown said the early disciples
[34:40] were one whisper from God and they would
[34:42] they would stop they would pull back
[34:43] they would pull over to the side go talk
[34:45] to this like like Philip was told to go
[34:47] talk to the Ethiopian eunuch and he
[34:49] didn't say well he's a Ethiopian you
[34:51] know he's sitting there in a gold cover
[34:52] chair I can't stare at I can't go talk
[34:55] to him no he just listened to what God
[34:57] told him to do you see that's being in
[34:59] unity with God God wants us to be
[35:02] willing to listen to him willing to be
[35:04] uh subject to the spirit moving on the
[35:07] scene willing to willing to know what's
[35:09] right and wrong and all those kind of
[35:10] things that go in with unity now brother
[35:12] Adam said now that that is perfect
[35:14] Oneness God and His creation God
[35:16] speaking lip to ear with Adam and Eve
[35:19] and they were so perfect in harmony with
[35:21] God till they were one with God God and
[35:24] his family was one so now now think
[35:28] about now what is Oneness one this kind
[35:30] of unity that we're talking about here
[35:32] is we study these things out Unity is is
[35:35] communication
[35:36] you know you know really if you just
[35:38] kind of look at look at problems in a
[35:40] church or problems in your home a lot of
[35:41] a lot of most most of the problems
[35:43] happen from communication just somebody
[35:45] I don't understand what the other
[35:47] person's saying or or they don't
[35:48] communicate clearly but if you just stop
[35:50] and communicate and you see that's
[35:52] that's what a lot of the problems in the
[35:54] in the church happen because we just
[35:55] don't want to understand what God's
[35:57] trying to get across to us we don't
[35:58] understand when we read the Bible the
[36:00] disciples they they hear Jesus tell a
[36:02] parable and they didn't understand it
[36:03] what are you talking about but when they
[36:05] begin to understand you see that's
[36:07] that's when Unity comes in when you
[36:09] begin to understand what's being
[36:11] preached across the pulpit and we all
[36:13] know when you started off with your in
[36:15] your Christian Journey when when you
[36:16] first started off you didn't understand
[36:17] it and it caused a lot of confusion does
[36:20] he mean this does he mean that what what
[36:23] does he mean that you come all this way
[36:25] in the Statue of perfect man and you
[36:26] still don't have the Holy Ghost what is
[36:28] it what does it mean that this and that
[36:30] and you have all these questions but
[36:32] then when you when the when it begins to
[36:34] be revealed to you did you begin to have
[36:36] a common understanding a common heart
[36:38] now that's that's the situation that
[36:40] Adam and Eve were there in the garden
[36:42] that they they had a they had a common
[36:44] purpose that they wanted to hear what
[36:46] God had to say they they weren't they
[36:48] weren't we'll say skip it out on Church
[36:50] they wanted to be there when God come
[36:52] down in the cool of the evening they
[36:54] were ready to hear him when he come and
[36:55] had a message for them they were waiting
[36:58] they were they they they were they were
[37:00] ready for Fellowship they were ready for
[37:02] fellowship and and uh I I sure
[37:04] appreciated that conversation I had with
[37:06] brother Aaron in the parking lot about
[37:08] uh what some of the preachers are
[37:10] preaching in a message about Oneness
[37:12] because that certainly ties in good with
[37:14] this and I might borrow some of them
[37:15] things because we were talking about we
[37:17] were talking about that that uh a real
[37:20] Christian Home has got to be has got to
[37:23] be situated on Oneness that that you how
[37:26] would you want to why would you want to
[37:27] be married to a woman that you don't
[37:29] really like that you know that's not
[37:31] Oneness I know that sometimes that
[37:32] happens I'm not talking about that
[37:34] sometimes that happens when you get in a
[37:35] situation and you you know all sorts of
[37:38] things happen but one Oneness is when
[37:40] you you have harmony with one another
[37:42] you you you you won't being around your
[37:46] spouse you want to be around your spouse
[37:47] and and like what we're talking about
[37:49] there I really appreciate that that why
[37:52] would you want to be married why would
[37:53] you want if a man is married to a woman
[37:55] why would you want to spend more time
[37:56] around other people than your wife your
[37:58] wife should be the person that you
[37:59] collaborate with that you fellowship
[38:01] with that you love really more than
[38:03] anybody else I I and I I can say that as
[38:05] my own testimony that I love my wife I
[38:07] want to be around my wife when I in in
[38:10] the evening after work I talk to my wife
[38:12] about my day I talk to my I talked to my
[38:15] wife about my children I talked to my
[38:16] wife about family because she's my buddy
[38:19] she's my friend and that's what we're
[38:21] talking about in the Garden of Eden Adam
[38:23] and Eve were buddies they were best
[38:25] friends it wasn't like well I don't even
[38:27] want to hang out with her I'd rather go
[38:29] fishing with my buddies now you see
[38:31] that's that's the kind of situation
[38:33] really in life if if you'd rather go
[38:35] fishing with your buddies or go out to
[38:36] the bar or something than be with your
[38:38] wife then that's a problem that's a
[38:40] problem and you're going to have a lot
[38:41] of marital problems if you don't want to
[38:43] be with your wife because your wife or
[38:44] your husband will flip it around both
[38:46] ways your wife your husband should be
[38:48] should be your buddy your best friend
[38:50] above everybody else
[38:52] except God of course God your spouse and
[38:56] then then the rest of the world you're
[38:58] because what is it your your spouse is
[39:01] somebody that you're yoked up to that
[39:03] God has given you that help to go
[39:04] through life together and and and uh
[39:07] face the world together and and and and
[39:09] and just look at things look at
[39:11] challenges of life together oh thank God
[39:13] that God give you somebody like that to
[39:15] go through life with that when you got
[39:17] money problems you can sit down and talk
[39:18] about it you have somebody to talk about
[39:20] it and you're not just there all alone
[39:22] that you got somebody with to go through
[39:24] life with and that's that's what Unity
[39:26] is supposed to be now brother Adam said
[39:28] to any man and his family are correct
[39:30] good Noble obedient family is one with
[39:32] another any family and if there's
[39:34] something in the family that moves them
[39:36] apart then it's not right the family's
[39:38] broken somewhere
[39:40] now listen to what he said they should
[39:42] all be one the whole family father with
[39:45] Mother Mother with father children with
[39:47] parent parent with children all in
[39:50] agreement and when you see that you'll
[39:52] see one lovely picture now now remember
[39:54] going back to Unity comes comes back
[39:57] down to communication you see let me
[40:00] tell you if you can have an open line of
[40:02] communication with your children oh you
[40:04] have one as a parent oh you have you
[40:07] have accomplished such a great thing if
[40:09] you have if you have an open life if
[40:11] there if they will come and share
[40:13] frankly with you they're false and
[40:15] failings and I know that's a really hard
[40:17] thing to say you know we all know that
[40:20] kids lie to their parents and you got to
[40:22] be real careful what you say is the
[40:24] truth and what is false and everything
[40:25] but I'ma tell you if you have an open
[40:27] line if you can ever establish a
[40:29] communication with your kids so that
[40:31] there come to you when they have a
[40:32] problem and that you they want you to
[40:34] pray over their tests and pray with them
[40:36] before they go to school and and it's a
[40:38] real open line of communication you have
[40:41] accomplished a great thing you have done
[40:44] a great thing if your children respect
[40:46] you respect the father and respect the
[40:47] mother
[40:48] and we'll come and talk to you about
[40:50] things that you have accomplished a
[40:51] great thing and you see this is I'm
[40:53] brother Madam is panning for us this
[40:55] ain't my picture that I'm painting this
[40:57] is Brother Brown I'm painting this
[40:58] picture for us of what a perfect what a
[41:00] what a what perfect unity and the Garden
[41:02] of Eden perfect unity in your home
[41:05] perfect Unity between you and God should
[41:08] look like this is what no see God God
[41:11] wants you to have a peaceful home if
[41:13] we're sitting here this this afternoon
[41:14] and you're thinking well I don't want to
[41:16] go home I like it hearing this quiet
[41:18] with the air conditioner running and the
[41:20] the quiet drone of the preacher so I can
[41:23] finally get a little nap and it's it's
[41:25] nice and nice and peaceful in here but
[41:27] you see God wants you to have the same
[41:29] peace the same peace at home he wants
[41:31] you to he wants you to have a peaceful
[41:33] home how do I know that because the
[41:35] Bible says in Psalms 128 thy wife shall
[41:38] be as a fruitful Vine by the size of
[41:40] thine house thy children like Olive
[41:41] plants round about thy table now we were
[41:44] talking this morning about promises if
[41:46] there's a promise laying in the Bible
[41:47] you can have access if you just claim it
[41:50] by faith and act on it step on step out
[41:53] on it Proverbs 15 says better as a
[41:56] dinner of herbs where love is than a
[41:58] stalled ox and hatred there with a
[41:59] stalled Ox is Ox that's been put in a
[42:01] stalled until it's nice and fat so he's
[42:03] saying it better as a dinner of Love
[42:04] herbs where love is than a then a
[42:07] fattened up ox and hatred there with
[42:11] better is a dry morsel in Proverbs 17
[42:13] and quietness there with in a house full
[42:15] of sacrifices with strife
[42:17] in Proverbs 24 says through wisdom is in
[42:19] house builted and by understanding it is
[42:21] established and by knowledge shall the
[42:23] chambers be filled with all precious and
[42:25] pleasant riches now if your house is
[42:27] going to be built with wisdom and by
[42:28] understanding it's established then let
[42:30] me give you this wisdom and an
[42:32] understanding that God wants you to have
[42:34] a peaceful home God don't want you to
[42:36] have a home where the the soap operas
[42:38] are running on the TV constantly and and
[42:40] you'd rather talk on the phone with all
[42:42] your friends and go fishing all the time
[42:43] instead of being there with your wife
[42:45] and you don't want to have a
[42:46] relationship with your kids and you
[42:48] don't want to listen to their problems
[42:49] and don't want to help them out and
[42:50] don't want to have a Bible study with
[42:51] them you see that's not the kind of
[42:53] peace and unity that God wants you to
[42:55] have God wants you to have a script
[42:57] scriptural joy and scriptural peace God
[43:00] can give you a home filled with
[43:02] contentment and peace
[43:04] oh if we could compare I think this is a
[43:07] problem we have a lot of times too we'll
[43:08] compare our life with other people and
[43:10] say well there there in this situation
[43:12] so I'm I'm good but let's not compare
[43:14] one another with ourselves let's let's
[43:17] compare it with the word
[43:19] God can give you a home where you can
[43:21] communicate where you can really
[43:23] communicate now brother remember said
[43:24] that's God's purpose
[43:27] that's God's purpose now see this ain't
[43:29] my purpose if it was my purpose you
[43:32] could get upset with me for preaching
[43:33] like this
[43:36] but this is God's purpose and brother
[43:38] Brian said what a prayer what a picture
[43:40] because the very nature of God was in
[43:44] these people yes and therefore what they
[43:46] did they followed just in line with God
[43:48] and God with them made one
[43:51] oh oh you these things are not Out Of
[43:53] Reach of us it's not Out Of Reach to
[43:55] have the character of God to have the
[43:57] patience of God and the love of God so
[43:59] we can love one another and forgive one
[44:00] another and all those kind of things to
[44:02] think well this picture that was that's
[44:04] being portrayed they desired they wanted
[44:06] to hear what God Said when you come down
[44:08] in the in this cool and Eve of the
[44:09] evening because they had the same nature
[44:12] the same mind
[44:14] and the same thoughts now there's a
[44:17] picture of unity that's what God is
[44:19] trying to get us back to
[44:20] that will have the same nature the same
[44:22] nature as God that we would be the
[44:25] express image of God that God that Jesus
[44:28] Christ would be so Tabernacle in us
[44:30] until we could get all of our flus
[44:32] unblocked and get all the reason cast
[44:34] out until we can just look straight on
[44:36] at God's promises at his word and say I
[44:38] believe it I don't care what what comes
[44:40] I don't care what the circumstances are
[44:41] I don't care what uh Susie Q from work
[44:44] or anybody says contrary to the word I
[44:47] don't care I'm just looking straight at
[44:49] what God's promise is
[44:51] and this is what Jesus prayed for if you
[44:53] go back and read John chapter 17. I know
[44:55] you've heard a lot of times ministers
[44:56] talk about how that Jesus prayed for you
[44:58] think about what a great fact that is to
[45:01] know that Jesus prayed for you if you
[45:03] want to read what Jesus prayed for you
[45:04] I'm talking about you right there
[45:06] sitting in that Pew then you can turn
[45:08] over to John chapter 17 in your own time
[45:10] and read the prayer that he prayed but
[45:12] what he was praying for was that we'd be
[45:14] one and Jesus prayed in John the 17th
[45:17] chapter in the 11th verse that the
[45:18] church and he would be one like he and
[45:20] the father were one that the church we
[45:22] as members of the body of Christ would
[45:24] be one together just like he and the
[45:26] father are one what a union a Oneness
[45:29] that would be to see God in his church
[45:30] till every member is just perfectly in
[45:34] harmony with each other and God
[45:37] and that's why brother bam said or or
[45:40] Jesus said in John chapter 14 at that
[45:42] day you shall know that I am in my
[45:43] father and ye and me and I and you
[45:46] you'll be so wrapped up together you'll
[45:48] be so wrapped up until what's the
[45:50] difference
[45:51] the bride will be him you'll be so
[45:54] wrapped up in it you're in him and he's
[45:56] in you yes and he's in the he's in the
[45:58] father and it's just all one see not
[46:00] there's the there's the revelation of
[46:02] the godhead not three different people
[46:03] if you can see that Jesus Christ was God
[46:07] in another form and the bride is God in
[46:10] another form and it's all God the same
[46:12] character the same person the same
[46:14] attributes and that makes that makes you
[46:17] God that's why in the Old Testament they
[46:19] had that scripture ye are Gods ye are
[46:21] Gods them that the word come to are Gods
[46:24] that's why as the word comes it unites
[46:27] you with God until you are God now
[46:30] that's a that's a big Throat full to say
[46:32] isn't it that's a big that's that'll
[46:34] choke us a lot of times
[46:37] but that's the church brother said
[46:39] that's the church that Jesus is coming
[46:41] for that's who he's coming back for and
[46:43] it is a requirement it is a requirement
[46:46] that we come to that kind of unity
[46:49] because God's not coming back for a
[46:51] little immature bride he's coming back
[46:52] for a bride that has come to a place
[46:54] where she and God are the same the same
[46:57] thoughts nothing different nothing
[46:59] different nothing separated but the same
[47:01] thoughts in other words if God said it
[47:03] you believe it amen you believe it and
[47:05] you will speak it because you believe it
[47:07] you'll come to a place we're coming to a
[47:09] place where we're saying the same thing
[47:11] and brother Adam said that's what his
[47:13] prayer will be answered in John 17 that
[47:16] we will be one the Oneness of himself
[47:18] and the people brother Adam said is the
[47:20] only grounds of Fellowship that God has
[47:22] ever laid down for himself in his church
[47:24] that's the only grounds of fellowship
[47:26] and that and the only way that he can
[47:28] have those grounds is by a union to be
[47:31] United with him forever we're talking
[47:34] about eternal life
[47:37] to be United with Christ
[47:40] to have the life of almighty God oh you
[47:42] see how these things come in layers oh
[47:44] you you gotta you as as the word is
[47:46] being preached it comes in layers first
[47:48] first first he he unites you in your
[47:51] soul
[47:52] and then your spirit
[47:54] and so you know honestly it it you hear
[47:57] you hear differently depending on kind
[47:59] of where you're at to be United with him
[48:02] in the spirit of his power his eternal
[48:03] life you're eternally United with god
[48:05] brother Ram said and he said if you're
[48:07] separated from God God don't uh well
[48:10] this is this is my note if you're
[48:11] separated from God God doesn't want you
[48:13] to stay in that tradition condition
[48:18] you think about Eve was United with Adam
[48:21] that she become part of him in Genesis 1
[48:25] 27 God created man male and female
[48:27] created he them now brother Brian said
[48:29] the body part the body was a byproduct
[48:33] now all you think that God God gave them
[48:35] both the same on the inside that same
[48:38] Spirit the same source of their life the
[48:40] same nature the same characteristics but
[48:42] the body come out of Adam's Rib so it
[48:45] will separate the body was a byproduct
[48:47] but not the spirit the body part of the
[48:50] woman was a byproduct after the creation
[48:51] had been finished I'm gonna take this
[48:53] off so I can be at Liberty
[48:57] no now y'all don't draw back on me now
[48:59] y'all help me out stay alert
[49:03] but not the spirit the spirit was part
[49:05] of Adam for he was both man and woman
[49:07] spiritually speaking both masculine and
[49:09] Finnish feminist and then God took that
[49:12] one feminist part of him out and put it
[49:13] in Eve
[49:15] oh you so now now they're they're
[49:17] different on the outside but the same on
[49:18] the inside now isn't that just like what
[49:20] Christ on the bride we're different on
[49:22] the outside on the outside are we got
[49:24] you know our we're in this flesh in this
[49:26] flesh that causes us all this problem
[49:28] and the spirit realm and everything but
[49:30] down on the inside we're the same
[49:33] now that's what brother Brown said he
[49:34] said now don't you see the great picture
[49:35] we and flesh are different we're like a
[49:38] byproduct a created being by holy
[49:40] wedlock but in spirit we are Sons and
[49:42] Daughters not some other Spirit but the
[49:44] spirit of the Living God we are in his
[49:45] likeness and his unity in the perfect
[49:47] image of the Living God because we
[49:49] become Sons and Daughters not separated
[49:52] but the Same Spirit the same God the
[49:55] same person joined in wedlock to the
[49:58] Eternal
[49:59] see how God planned it that we should
[50:01] not be different but him
[50:04] oh if you think about that statement
[50:06] that he just made that we should not be
[50:07] different but him so what are we where
[50:10] God made flesh where God in Tabernacle
[50:14] and individuals
[50:16] and first John 4 13 it says this is how
[50:18] we know that we live in him and he and
[50:20] us that he has given us of his Spirit
[50:22] yes this is how we know that we're in
[50:24] him that he's given us up his spirit and
[50:26] that's how we know because it's the same
[50:28] it's the same life it's the same
[50:30] characteristics that took us out of the
[50:31] world that changed us that makes us act
[50:33] different and think different in Romans
[50:35] 8 11 it says but if the spirit of him
[50:37] that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell
[50:39] and you hit it raised up Christ from the
[50:40] dead shall also Quicken your mortal
[50:42] bodies by what by his spirit that
[50:44] dwelleth in you at the same spirit that
[50:47] dwelt in Jesus Christ dwells in you so
[50:49] we are living by The Same Spirit
[50:52] separated out into his bride that brings
[50:54] us into Unity yes oh now think about
[50:57] that think about that God God took that
[50:59] same spirit and put it in individuals
[51:01] separated so he could deal with us each
[51:04] individually as we go about our
[51:06] day-to-day Life as we go to work and go
[51:08] to jobs people all around the world
[51:09] going to different churches individuals
[51:11] but that same spirit is working in all
[51:13] of us and it's going to bring us back to
[51:16] Unity with him so that we act the same
[51:18] way and and talk the same way oh you go
[51:21] back and read what brother Brown said in
[51:22] Revelation 4 as he was preaching those
[51:24] sermons about how that he saw John saw
[51:26] John saw that image of the emerald
[51:28] rainbow and out of that out of that
[51:30] Emerald rainbow is like a crystal that
[51:32] reflected light into all the seven
[51:34] Church ages that rainbow light now that
[51:36] light was an emerald green the life of
[51:38] God reflecting in all the seven Church
[51:40] ages because it's the same life and you
[51:42] and I and individuals and it's bringing
[51:44] us all back together with Oneness with
[51:46] the with him and brother Brown said and
[51:49] today if we don't live the Christian
[51:51] Life well then what people can say we're
[51:53] not Christians but if Christ is in you
[51:55] he lives his life in you and Jesus said
[51:59] brother Brown said again he said Jesus
[52:01] said if I don't do the works of my
[52:02] father then believe me not but if I do
[52:03] the works of my father believe the works
[52:05] there you are we ought to be reflecting
[52:07] the life of God in our life and I'm not
[52:10] talking about just being good people I'm
[52:12] talking about signs and wonders
[52:14] following I'm talking about you lay your
[52:15] hand on your wife in her bed when she's
[52:17] feeling sick and you see people being
[52:19] healed because we're expecting we're
[52:21] expecting the word of God that we
[52:23] believe will have an effect in our lives
[52:25] that we won't act the same we won't talk
[52:27] the same but it'll change us changes and
[52:29] changes and changes until that final
[52:31] change when we step out of here like
[52:33] brother said what's the Rapture going to
[52:34] be just to change the Rapture will be
[52:36] just to change so I'm expecting changes
[52:39] I'm expecting God's word to be effectual
[52:42] in our lives to changes
[52:44] thank you
[52:47] and what did he say it's the Holy Spirit
[52:49] his life in you working his own life
[52:52] through you and another place he said
[52:54] remember it's still him it's his life in
[52:58] you thank God for the Holy Ghost God
[53:00] gave us the Holy Ghost for more than
[53:02] just to cheer us up he gave it he gave
[53:04] us something to live with he gave us
[53:06] something to power us up the statue of a
[53:08] perfect man to unite us with him to be
[53:10] one with him and he said on the day of
[53:13] Pentecost we find the Holy Spirit the
[53:14] pillar of fire separating itself and
[53:17] setting upon each member of that church
[53:19] God putting himself together now don't
[53:21] think of separating like God chopping
[53:23] himself up God is still one but he's
[53:26] taken part of himself and putting
[53:27] himself in you and I so that my and my
[53:31] own self I'm not the fullness of God and
[53:33] you're not the fullness of God but all
[53:35] together all together we are all
[53:38] together all around the world the bride
[53:41] together is the fullness of God made
[53:42] bodily and he said then with that group
[53:45] of people together what does it do
[53:47] brings back the unified body of the Lord
[53:51] Jesus coming together now there you got
[53:53] the son of man back on Earth again there
[53:56] you've got the revelation of the son of
[53:57] man not like the Son of God in
[53:59] Revelation down through the seven Church
[54:00] ages where they just had partial word a
[54:02] partial understanding but the son of man
[54:04] will be God manifesting himself back in
[54:06] the bride again in fullness without any
[54:09] deviation from the word without any
[54:11] denominational ideas without any
[54:13] man-made ideas she will be God made
[54:16] manifest in flesh again so that's that's
[54:19] where you can stand and say if you don't
[54:21] believe what I preach you can say like
[54:23] Paul did if you don't believe what I
[54:25] preach you you'll be judged by my gospel
[54:28] if an angel from heaven come and say
[54:30] anything contrary to whatever I say Let
[54:32] It Be accursed that's the son of man
[54:35] coming to speak in John chapter 16 27 28
[54:38] it says for the father himself in love
[54:40] with you because you have loved me and
[54:41] have believed that I came out from God I
[54:44] came forth from the father and had him
[54:46] come into the world again I leave the
[54:47] world and go to the father and John 14 3
[54:50] says if I go and prepare a place for you
[54:52] I will come again and receive you unto
[54:54] myself that where I am there ye may be
[54:57] also so God that's the whole purpose
[54:59] that God came into the Earth that Jesus
[55:01] Christ came into the Earth to prepare a
[55:03] place for you to to bring you back to
[55:06] himself to Oneness with himself
[55:09] now brother round said in flesh I become
[55:11] Branham because of my father Branham you
[55:14] become part of your father and mother
[55:16] but in spirit
[55:18] in spirit we become a union with God
[55:20] it's part of God that's the reason that
[55:24] the spirit cannot die
[55:25] oh thank God that by the Holy Ghost I'm
[55:27] connected to a different family tree the
[55:30] family tree that I come born from my
[55:32] mama and daddy from I had all kind of
[55:34] problems and and things that you could
[55:35] trace back as stubbornness and every
[55:38] every problem in the natural of natural
[55:40] life but in my spirit in my spirit it
[55:43] connects me back to a different
[55:45] genealogy that takes over my natural
[55:48] genealogy and will correct the problems
[55:50] that I was born with it'll correct The
[55:52] Temper it'll correct that the judgmental
[55:55] nature and the stubbornness it'll
[55:57] correct all that and take it out bit by
[55:59] bit until I'm like Jesus Christ and
[56:02] you're like Jesus Christ
[56:04] it is what is it it's his own life
[56:06] tabernacling himself in you and Romans
[56:09] chapter 8 verse 1 says there is
[56:11] therefore now no condemnation to them
[56:14] which are in Christ Jesus how are you
[56:15] going to condemn that Holy Ghost that
[56:17] lives on the inside of you there's
[56:19] nothing there's nothing wrong with that
[56:21] there there is therefore now no
[56:23] condemnation to them which are in Christ
[56:24] Jesus who walk not after the flesh but
[56:27] after the spirit we're not walking after
[56:29] the flesh when we're born again we're
[56:30] walking after the spirit this on the
[56:32] inside this quickening our outside body
[56:34] to behave like the spirit on the inside
[56:37] wants us to as we yield to it as we let
[56:40] it as we Feast on the word it's
[56:42] correcting our natural carnal nature in
[56:45] Romans 8 verse 5 says for they that are
[56:47] after The Flesh do mind the things of
[56:49] the flesh but they that are after the
[56:51] spirit the things of the spirit oh that
[56:53] that ought to inform you know when you
[56:55] see somebody that just can't can't live
[56:57] that Christian Life
[56:59] the flesh the flesh will mind the spirit
[57:02] when you're born again it's going to
[57:04] there's a battle going on but you've got
[57:06] to give way to that thing that's on the
[57:08] inside
[57:09] the spirit in you wants to be in control
[57:13] in Galatians 3 16 he says this I say
[57:16] then walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[57:18] fulfill the lust of the flesh walk in
[57:21] this Spirit like we were preaching that
[57:22] Wednesday night get in the spirit
[57:23] sometime if you if you're struggling
[57:25] with things get in the spirit a little
[57:26] bit and find out what God how God wants
[57:29] you to live your life
[57:31] Jesus laid out the formula to eternal
[57:33] life to Martha when he said Jesus he
[57:35] said I am the resurrection of the life
[57:37] he that believeth in me though he were
[57:39] dead yet shall he live and whosoever
[57:40] liveth and believeth in me shall never
[57:42] lie never die you're believing on him
[57:44] until you receive eternal life then
[57:47] eternal life is God's life in you then
[57:50] you're believing in him you're believing
[57:52] on him and then you're believing in him
[57:55] and that's why he said whosoever liveth
[57:56] and believeth in me shall never die
[58:01] brother Brown said so we can be in God
[58:03] United
[58:04] because Adam and Eve
[58:07] I think this is such a wonderful quote
[58:09] when you get discouraged you start
[58:11] thinking about this kind of thing
[58:14] and you look at that that picture of
[58:16] Adam and Eve there in the garden
[58:18] that they were United in the picture of
[58:20] of Union with God and so that is a
[58:22] picture to us that we too can be in that
[58:25] kind of a union with God that's what
[58:27] brother Brown said he said so we can be
[58:29] in God United because Adam and Eve
[58:31] before the fall for the disbelieving of
[58:33] the word was an example of what we could
[58:36] be in him they were an example to us of
[58:40] what we can be what you and I can be
[58:42] to be United with him
[58:45] his life
[58:46] to be separated from him as death
[58:49] if we'll just follow his Commandments
[58:51] now
[58:53] now think about this now
[58:55] I know it's 30 minutes and right after
[58:57] 30 minutes is when everybody starts
[58:59] taking a nap so I'm trying to be
[59:01] I'm gonna slow down
[59:04] that turkey starts settling in that
[59:06] sandwich that you ate for lunch
[59:10] my brother Brian said we know we make
[59:13] mistakes
[59:14] but you mustn't look at that see on the
[59:16] outside our flesh it's going to make
[59:18] mistakes or think about it think about
[59:20] it when you were in sin it's like having
[59:21] a a dark garment on and how you're going
[59:24] to get it white but when you're when
[59:27] when God fills you with his life now
[59:28] you're clothed in righteousness and
[59:31] you're you're but going through life
[59:32] you're going to get black spots on it so
[59:35] uh you know you're going when you you're
[59:37] going to you're going to make mistakes
[59:38] you're going to fall that's what he's
[59:40] saying he said it's it's not your
[59:42] mistakes because you're always going to
[59:44] have them as long as you go through life
[59:46] you're always going to get little spots
[59:48] on your on your on your wedding dress on
[59:50] your garment you got to keep cleaning it
[59:52] off you gotta but you see when you fall
[59:54] get back up when you make a mistake now
[59:57] now we're going to get in here somewhere
[59:59] for a minute oh it's always to think now
[1:00:01] what a blessing it is
[1:00:03] to recognize our mistakes yes
[1:00:07] yes oh you think now which which is
[1:00:09] which is greater to to not have any
[1:00:12] mistakes
[1:00:14] or to recognize when you mistake make
[1:00:16] mistakes so see so many people are just
[1:00:19] blind to their predicament that the
[1:00:21] Bible says in Proverbs chapter 26 do you
[1:00:23] see a person wise in their own eyes
[1:00:24] there's more hope for a fool than for
[1:00:26] them somebody that just won't recognize
[1:00:29] that they made a mistake
[1:00:30] it's such a blessing to recognize when
[1:00:33] you make a mistake and can can get up
[1:00:35] and apologize for it that I think I
[1:00:37] think to me that's almost a greater
[1:00:39] thing than somebody that's just just
[1:00:40] wallowing around in filth and don't know
[1:00:42] nothing it's a greater thing that
[1:00:44] somebody can can recognize that they
[1:00:46] made a mistake and pick up their head
[1:00:48] and go to somebody and apologize for it
[1:00:50] or get on their knees at night and say
[1:00:52] God forgive me I made a mistake you see
[1:00:54] you see the problem really is when when
[1:00:56] you look at when you when you look at
[1:00:57] yourself or look at others and they just
[1:00:59] they just can't see the state that
[1:01:02] they're in there's where you really got
[1:01:03] a problem the pig Walling around in the
[1:01:06] mire that that's uh just doesn't even
[1:01:08] know that he's in a pickle that's a
[1:01:11] problem but oh when you make a mistake
[1:01:13] just get up just get up and keep going
[1:01:15] just don't don't stay down but just get
[1:01:17] up again now brother Ryan said it's not
[1:01:19] your mistakes he said we know we make
[1:01:21] mistakes but you mustn't look at that
[1:01:23] it's not your mistakes because you're
[1:01:26] always going to have him but you see is
[1:01:28] following his rules following what he
[1:01:30] said do stumble and falling doesn't have
[1:01:33] one thing to do with it a real true
[1:01:37] servant if he'll stumble he'll get up
[1:01:38] again if he wobbles God pulls him right
[1:01:41] back in the path as long as he's in the
[1:01:44] path of Duty oh that's where if you got
[1:01:46] the right motives and the right
[1:01:47] objectives and you're you want to be you
[1:01:49] want to be better and you you get in a
[1:01:51] fix and you just stumble I shouldn't
[1:01:54] have told that brother that I shouldn't
[1:01:55] have reacted like that then just
[1:01:57] apologize and go on just tell them
[1:01:59] you're sorry pick up the phone and say
[1:02:01] I'm sorry now there's when you can see a
[1:02:04] real Christian at work
[1:02:06] not not being all goody two shoes and
[1:02:09] walking through life all perfect and
[1:02:10] everything not making any mistakes but
[1:02:13] real Christianity is apologizing real
[1:02:17] Christianity is repentance real
[1:02:19] Christianity is I I know I know I'm
[1:02:21] going to make mistakes in my life but
[1:02:23] there's something down on the inside
[1:02:24] that's going to make me love my brother
[1:02:27] going to make me forgive my brother
[1:02:29] gonna make me ask for forgiveness and
[1:02:31] want to make me reconcile with somebody
[1:02:34] when I do wrong oh what a blessing of
[1:02:36] the Holy Ghost I want to reconcile with
[1:02:38] somebody when you've got something
[1:02:40] between you and another brother it makes
[1:02:41] you want to go to them and did you did
[1:02:43] you really mean that what you said no
[1:02:46] brother listen you took it the wrong way
[1:02:48] or you know maybe I did mean it that way
[1:02:51] but I'm sorry I'm sorry about what I
[1:02:53] said now there's Christianity at work
[1:02:55] right there because something on the
[1:02:57] inside is taking over something and let
[1:03:00] me tell you something that's a
[1:03:01] supernatural at work
[1:03:02] somebody that can apologize you look out
[1:03:05] in the world and the world ain't gonna
[1:03:07] apologize the world ain't gonna admit
[1:03:09] fault the world won't admit wrong it's
[1:03:12] so hard for people to admit when they
[1:03:15] are wrong I I even you know think about
[1:03:17] the story of Noah trying to get people
[1:03:19] to just get on the ark and nobody would
[1:03:21] get on the ark after 120 years preaching
[1:03:23] preaching preaching preaching and think
[1:03:25] about today in this situation that we're
[1:03:26] living in today you can preach and
[1:03:28] preach and preach and seems like the
[1:03:29] people that you want to get kind of
[1:03:31] shook a little bit they just they just
[1:03:33] it's so hard to get people to admit that
[1:03:36] they need God that they need a savior or
[1:03:40] to give somebody to admit that they're
[1:03:42] wrong takes a supernatural life of God
[1:03:45] almost that's why in Proverbs chapter 26
[1:03:47] it says to you see a person wise in
[1:03:49] their own eyes well I know what's right
[1:03:51] and wrong I know what I need to be doing
[1:03:53] I know I I don't make any mistakes there
[1:03:55] is more hope for a fool and for them is
[1:03:57] what the Bible says in Proverbs 12 15
[1:04:00] the way of fool seems right to them but
[1:04:02] the why eyes listen to advice the wives
[1:04:05] want somebody to give them counsel and
[1:04:07] Luke chapter 18 9-14 it says this is the
[1:04:10] parable of the Pharisee and the tax
[1:04:11] collector in the story The Pharisee was
[1:04:13] self-righteous and didn't recognize his
[1:04:16] own need for forgiveness while a tax
[1:04:17] collector humbly acknowledged his
[1:04:20] sinfulness and salt God's mercy now
[1:04:21] there's there's somebody that'll really
[1:04:23] get something from God somebody that
[1:04:24] realizes that they need something that
[1:04:27] they need some not not to stand there
[1:04:28] staunchly and say well I I'll tell you
[1:04:31] what I know I know I'm not going to go
[1:04:34] down and talk to that brother and sit it
[1:04:36] sit across from him at McDonald's and
[1:04:37] make everything right or what I'm just
[1:04:38] making I'm just making up McDonald it
[1:04:40] don't matter what I'm not trying to
[1:04:41] paint a scene where somebody didn't go
[1:04:44] to McDonald's or something like that I'm
[1:04:45] just talking I'm just talking about
[1:04:46] reconciliation
[1:04:48] and to First John 1 to 8 it says if we
[1:04:51] claim to be without sin we deceive
[1:04:52] ourselves and the truth is not in us if
[1:04:54] we claim to be without sin we deceive
[1:04:57] ourselves if we if we get to a place
[1:04:58] where we're like there's nothing I'm
[1:05:01] doing everything exactly by the book oh
[1:05:03] you're deceive yourselves oh we need to
[1:05:06] conduct ourselves with humility and and
[1:05:08] just because brother Brown said as soon
[1:05:10] as you dries above the dust you rise
[1:05:12] above God because you're elevating
[1:05:15] yourself to a place where you don't need
[1:05:16] to get down and repent or ask for
[1:05:18] forgiveness anymore
[1:05:20] it is worse it is worse to stubbornly
[1:05:23] refuse to admit your failure failure
[1:05:25] than to stumble and fall I I really
[1:05:28] believe that it is worse to stubbornly
[1:05:30] refuse I I ain't apologizing for nothing
[1:05:32] that's worse than just stumbling fall to
[1:05:34] begin with because you stumble and fall
[1:05:36] get back up and keep on going dust
[1:05:39] yourself off get a little Rag and clean
[1:05:41] that spot off and get get that white on
[1:05:43] there again get the rag of faith in what
[1:05:45] Jesus Christ has already done and let
[1:05:47] his blood and wash it off of you I just
[1:05:49] get up and just keep right on going keep
[1:05:51] on moving instead of relying on our own
[1:05:53] righteousness and our own good works
[1:05:55] because our own righteousness is those
[1:05:58] filthy rags to God there's nothing good
[1:06:00] about our own works there's nothing good
[1:06:02] about the way that we conduct ourselves
[1:06:04] without Christ where would any of us be
[1:06:06] we need we need a blood covering we need
[1:06:08] we need God to cover us over
[1:06:10] thank you
[1:06:14] I'll tell you what God look I'll tell
[1:06:16] you something else God loves besides
[1:06:17] this morning that we were preaching on
[1:06:18] faith God loves to see faith and God
[1:06:20] loves to see an humble heart that just
[1:06:23] wants God Psalm 51 says My Sacrifice o
[1:06:26] God is a broken Spirit David knew about
[1:06:28] broken Spirit a broken and a contrite
[1:06:31] heart you God will not despise somebody
[1:06:33] that's willing to Humble themselves down
[1:06:35] to the plate place to ask oh God I need
[1:06:38] something from you and Matthew 5 3 4
[1:06:40] Jesus said blessed are the poor in
[1:06:42] spirit for that's the kind of person
[1:06:43] that's going to have the Kingdom of
[1:06:45] Heaven blessed are those who mourn for
[1:06:47] they will be comforted and James 4 6 he
[1:06:49] said God opposes the proud but shows
[1:06:51] favor to the humble God opposes the
[1:06:54] proud but shows favor to the home I
[1:06:56] think the pride is one of the worst
[1:06:58] Spirits you can get on you because Pride
[1:07:01] if you go look up the dictionary
[1:07:02] definition of it Pride's got all this
[1:07:04] all this stuff accumulated around it of
[1:07:07] arrogance and stubbornness and
[1:07:08] defensiveness you can't tell me I I used
[1:07:12] to live next to we used to live the next
[1:07:13] to this guy it he got his whole family
[1:07:15] turned against him and and his son
[1:07:17] actually disowned him and and every time
[1:07:19] I talked to him I used to think this
[1:07:21] this fella is just so stubborn he got to
[1:07:23] a place where he they were going to kick
[1:07:25] him out and I tried everything I could
[1:07:26] to help him out try to find a place for
[1:07:28] him to move into and everything I did he
[1:07:30] just said well I I don't want to listen
[1:07:32] to it that's the worst thing kind of
[1:07:34] situation you can be is prideful and
[1:07:37] just stubborn where you can't even be
[1:07:38] helped by nobody entitlement a disdain
[1:07:41] for feedback all to be like to be
[1:07:44] somebody like that that don't want any
[1:07:46] kind of a feedback I I'll tell you what
[1:07:48] I'm gonna be honest I want all the help
[1:07:50] I can get whether it's mean-spirited or
[1:07:52] good spirited
[1:07:54] yeah
[1:07:56] I I will feedback when I'm preaching
[1:07:58] sometimes I'll ask my wife anything I
[1:08:00] can do better about my sermon she'll
[1:08:02] tell me sometimes well you need to slow
[1:08:03] down or whatever and I'll take that
[1:08:04] feedback I'll take feedback from anybody
[1:08:07] because I want feedback anything I can
[1:08:10] do to better myself but you see what
[1:08:12] Pride does it just cabbages you down and
[1:08:14] says well I don't want to listen to
[1:08:15] nobody I'm gonna do it my way or I'm
[1:08:18] gonna do it like like that's that sounds
[1:08:20] a lot like Kane doesn't it you're either
[1:08:23] gonna come my way or not at all
[1:08:27] and Proverbs 16 5 says the Lord detests
[1:08:30] all the proud of heart
[1:08:32] it says be sure of this they will not go
[1:08:34] unpunished
[1:08:35] we know we make mistakes but you mustn't
[1:08:38] look at that it's not your mistakes
[1:08:40] because you're always going to have him
[1:08:42] but you see it's following his rules
[1:08:44] following what he said to you for we can
[1:08:47] just humble our heart down to the place
[1:08:48] where God said we need to go be baptized
[1:08:50] we go get baptized the right way if God
[1:08:53] said we need the Holy Ghost and we just
[1:08:54] we lay aside everything else until we
[1:08:56] get the Holy Ghost until we're sure we
[1:08:58] got the Holy Ghost none of this babying
[1:09:00] around well I think I got it I hope but
[1:09:03] let's let's be sure let's get in the
[1:09:05] word and find out scripturally whether
[1:09:07] we got the holy ghost or not so we don't
[1:09:08] have to keep keep asking somebody do you
[1:09:10] think I got it or maybe maybe I do maybe
[1:09:13] I don't but let's find out let's find
[1:09:15] out scripturally whether we got it or
[1:09:17] not if we could just be humble enough to
[1:09:19] get in the word and find out things yes
[1:09:21] but around said that's why he said this
[1:09:24] great thing I would this great statement
[1:09:26] that we battled with for over the years
[1:09:28] I would rather be wrong in my Doctrine
[1:09:31] and right in my heart than to be right
[1:09:34] in my Doctrine and wrong in my heart why
[1:09:38] because it's your heart's condition I
[1:09:41] would rather be with a humble spirit
[1:09:43] that can be corrected that somebody can
[1:09:46] talk to me and straighten out my path
[1:09:48] than to be right in my Doctrine but I
[1:09:50] have a horrible hateful attitude there
[1:09:53] won't be no good in this life that won't
[1:09:55] help nobody that every time somebody
[1:09:57] wants to talk to you just push back I
[1:09:59] would rather be wrong in my Doctrine and
[1:10:01] right in my heart because the heart's
[1:10:04] condition is more important even than
[1:10:06] you being right could we say that I
[1:10:09] think we battle that out long enough
[1:10:10] around here the heart's condition is the
[1:10:12] most important thing it matters more
[1:10:14] than you being right it matters more
[1:10:17] than you being right well bless God I
[1:10:19] know I'm right I don't want to listen to
[1:10:21] somebody like that I know I'm right
[1:10:24] oh let's get away from the culture of
[1:10:26] trying to be perfect in ourselves
[1:10:28] a good way how life is full of mistakes
[1:10:33] life is full of mistakes you know God
[1:10:35] don't want a shaky scared Church afraid
[1:10:37] to make mistakes you you if you're
[1:10:40] afraid to make mistakes you'll never be
[1:10:41] good at nothing even at my work where I
[1:10:44] work you'll people make mistakes all the
[1:10:46] time oops I deleted the whole database
[1:10:49] well we'll we'll fix it you made a
[1:10:51] mistake now we know how to recover we'll
[1:10:53] fix it the people at church you're going
[1:10:55] to make a mistake I I shouldn't have you
[1:10:57] know use that microphone or whatever and
[1:10:59] maybe somebody'll fuss on you you get it
[1:11:02] all straightened up but let's don't be
[1:11:03] afraid of mistakes because if you want
[1:11:05] to be if you want to be a blessing in
[1:11:07] anything in life then you're going to
[1:11:09] make mistakes life is full of mistake if
[1:11:11] you make a mistake at least you tried at
[1:11:13] least you got up there let's let's just
[1:11:15] get up get up and give it your all
[1:11:17] because we're in position for Unity and
[1:11:20] Oneness with God we're in position to
[1:11:21] come into Unity where there's no
[1:11:23] difference no difference between our our
[1:11:26] thinking and our acting and the way we
[1:11:28] talk and The Way We Walk between us and
[1:11:31] God that is what we are in position for
[1:11:34] that brother said now look Adam and Eve
[1:11:37] in a position to never die in a position
[1:11:39] to never be old to never be sick to
[1:11:42] never have a worry you say I sure wish I
[1:11:45] could be like that
[1:11:47] and he said I got news for you
[1:11:49] you are in the same position
[1:11:52] oh you think about that
[1:11:54] a position to never die
[1:11:57] position to never be old
[1:11:59] position to never be sick
[1:12:01] position to never have a worry
[1:12:03] you can have that
[1:12:05] you're in that kind of position
[1:12:07] he said God places that to every
[1:12:09] creature on the earth in the same
[1:12:10] position what was the agreement if you
[1:12:13] keep my word now if you keep your word
[1:12:14] if you keep his word you don't have to
[1:12:16] worry you don't have to worry about
[1:12:17] tomorrow you can be like Jesus down at
[1:12:18] the bottom of that boat when the storm
[1:12:20] came up and it was tossing the boat back
[1:12:22] and forth you don't have to worry the
[1:12:23] doctor tell you you got some kind of
[1:12:24] horrible disease but you just you put
[1:12:26] that on God cast your cares upon Him is
[1:12:28] what the Bible says cast it on him and
[1:12:31] you don't have to worry because God's
[1:12:32] got it all in control remember that
[1:12:34] promise that the devil can't do not one
[1:12:36] thing to you unless God pulls back the
[1:12:38] Hedge unless it happen so if God's in
[1:12:40] control of everything and you know
[1:12:42] you're in the word then just that should
[1:12:44] give you confidence you just stay stay
[1:12:46] the course and don't worry you can have
[1:12:48] you got a prompt now he's he's the one
[1:12:51] that said you're in position to never be
[1:12:53] sick you're in position to never be old
[1:12:56] you're in position for a body change
[1:12:58] you're in position for that you're in
[1:13:01] position to to for our bodies to be
[1:13:03] changed and take us home up to the
[1:13:05] wedding supper and on into the
[1:13:06] Millennium and reign with him for a
[1:13:08] thousand years and on into the New
[1:13:09] Jerusalem if you'll just keep my words
[1:13:11] yes that's that's what he's asking us to
[1:13:14] do keep my words keep my words what be
[1:13:16] born again if God said be born again you
[1:13:19] got to be born again amen you got to be
[1:13:21] born again now
[1:13:23] if God said you got to be dressed right
[1:13:25] if God said you got to be dressed right
[1:13:27] say you're not some kind of a lustology
[1:13:29] for men and dressed right men so that
[1:13:31] you look like a real man you got to be
[1:13:33] dressed right if God said if God said
[1:13:35] don't forsake the assembling of
[1:13:36] yourselves together come to church
[1:13:38] because you you recognize the importance
[1:13:40] of that because God's word says it then
[1:13:42] you you got to go to church because
[1:13:44] you're going to keep his words if the
[1:13:47] Bible says do unto others you got to do
[1:13:49] that because his word says that and that
[1:13:51] nature on the inside is going to make
[1:13:53] you make that outside conform to that if
[1:13:56] if God said if his word says to put God
[1:13:59] first in everything
[1:14:00] put God for put God put coming to church
[1:14:03] instead of going to the birthday parties
[1:14:04] and all the family reunions and stuff on
[1:14:06] Sunday can put God first in everything
[1:14:07] then I got to keep his word because you
[1:14:10] oh you see you see I was telling Monica
[1:14:13] the other day
[1:14:14] I read this quote where blood around
[1:14:16] said me and brother Neville are not your
[1:14:18] bosses we don't have bosses in a church
[1:14:20] we don't have bosses where I'm going to
[1:14:22] come into your house and put my thumb on
[1:14:23] you and say you better you know like
[1:14:26] that that's not what Christianity is but
[1:14:28] we are subject to the word you see I
[1:14:29] don't have any authority to tell you
[1:14:31] nothing outside of the word I don't have
[1:14:33] any authority to tell you to do to do
[1:14:34] what I I think is right or wrong but I
[1:14:36] certainly do have authority to preach
[1:14:38] God's word and we've all got to be
[1:14:40] subject to the word so when the word
[1:14:41] says you've got to come to church and
[1:14:43] you got to dress right and you got to
[1:14:44] live right you got to act right and
[1:14:46] treat one another right then I have
[1:14:47] authority to tell you these things
[1:14:49] because the world gives me Authority
[1:14:51] like the policemen that don't have any
[1:14:52] Authority in himself but he stands out
[1:14:54] on the corner and holds his hand up and
[1:14:56] you got to stop or go because he's got
[1:14:58] Authority that was given to him
[1:15:00] you got to keep your words you got to
[1:15:02] keep his words
[1:15:03] Satan is so deceiving to keep you off
[1:15:05] track though Satan will make you all
[1:15:07] kinds of promises and I'm starting to
[1:15:10] struggle here the clock's going around
[1:15:11] I'm trying to
[1:15:17] on the other hand I did give y'all some
[1:15:19] time back this morning
[1:15:21] everybody gets worried everybody gets
[1:15:23] nervous
[1:15:25] Satan will make you all kind of promises
[1:15:27] but he has nothing to give you because
[1:15:28] he don't have nothing he don't have no
[1:15:30] salvation what is Satan anything
[1:15:32] contrary to the word oh no now there's
[1:15:35] where you're getting into something deep
[1:15:36] what is the devil he's anything of
[1:15:39] course he's a being of course but now
[1:15:40] just just categorizing the devil the
[1:15:43] influence of the devil anything
[1:15:46] contrary to the word
[1:15:49] now now you get into some deep water
[1:15:51] here a little bit because you think
[1:15:53] about now that in your soul you can be
[1:15:55] born again but you can still be
[1:15:57] influenced by the devil in your spirit
[1:15:58] in your soul you can be born again but
[1:16:00] you go out in the parking lot and and
[1:16:02] somebody will say something contrary to
[1:16:03] the word and yet they're born again but
[1:16:06] it'll cause maybe a doubt or put a
[1:16:09] complex in somebody's mind like like
[1:16:10] maybe a born-again Christian will say I
[1:16:12] I think you gotta I think you got a
[1:16:14] problem with pride or I got I think
[1:16:16] you've got a problem with uh you just
[1:16:18] say put put a complex on you now you've
[1:16:20] got to battle that out and and it ain't
[1:16:22] it ain't coming from a good place it's
[1:16:24] not coming from it's not coming from
[1:16:25] anything scriptural but but you see oh
[1:16:28] you see how the devil will put something
[1:16:30] in in in your mind your mind
[1:16:33] your mind right here now where's this
[1:16:36] scriptural I'm talking about you go back
[1:16:38] into the Bible and read read where Jesus
[1:16:40] asked who do you say that I the son of
[1:16:42] man am and Peter said by our Revelation
[1:16:44] die or the Christ the son of the Living
[1:16:45] God and they're just a few few verses
[1:16:47] later Jesus has turned around and saying
[1:16:50] him get behind me Satan it's right there
[1:16:52] in the same chapter just a few verses
[1:16:54] later he had just identified Jesus as
[1:16:56] the Thou Art the Christ the son of
[1:16:58] living God but then just turned right
[1:17:00] around and he's Jesus is calling him
[1:17:01] Satan because why because Satan is
[1:17:04] anything contrary to the word of God
[1:17:06] that's that's what this whole growth is
[1:17:09] is the word of God pushing the devil out
[1:17:12] pushing him out just like when you were
[1:17:14] being born again he pushed him out of
[1:17:16] your soul and that's the process of
[1:17:18] sanctification so that God could come
[1:17:20] and live in your soul now he's pushing
[1:17:22] him out of your spirit so through your
[1:17:23] memory or Reason Consciousness affection
[1:17:25] imagination you're not letting you're
[1:17:27] not listening to nothing the devil tells
[1:17:29] you that Satan is anything contrary to
[1:17:32] the word now think about that the next
[1:17:33] next time you're so quick to just listen
[1:17:35] to some gossip or listen to something
[1:17:37] false or fake that that that's I say
[1:17:40] that's that's that's how you discern
[1:17:42] that's the devil
[1:17:44] and brother Brown said he doesn't have
[1:17:46] salvation he doesn't have light his
[1:17:48] kingdom is Darkness the end there of his
[1:17:50] death darkness and death is Satan's
[1:17:52] kingdom yes yes that's why one word off
[1:17:55] brings death one word off
[1:17:57] one word off comes from the devil it's
[1:18:00] not something God God told you it's one
[1:18:02] word see how one word off can be so
[1:18:05] close
[1:18:06] I don't think it's for you
[1:18:08] I don't think you can get it I I think
[1:18:11] you're just gonna have to go to the
[1:18:12] doctor I think and want one word off one
[1:18:16] word off will cause doubt and fear to
[1:18:19] settle in because this of the devil
[1:18:21] the devil's the Satan's whole economy is
[1:18:24] based upon false conception brother
[1:18:25] Brown was even uh talking about he he he
[1:18:28] went uh he saw this advertisement about
[1:18:31] somebody washing dishes that this thing
[1:18:33] you could just you could just get and
[1:18:35] you just put your dishes in it and it
[1:18:37] would wash them and you wouldn't have to
[1:18:38] push them in the dishwasher or anything
[1:18:39] and he believed that ad that he saw uh
[1:18:42] in the newspaper or whatever and and he
[1:18:44] when he got it he thought boy I'm going
[1:18:46] to really be something but he found out
[1:18:47] that they were they were they were lying
[1:18:49] to him the whole time that it was all
[1:18:51] deception
[1:18:54] he said there was just as much egg on
[1:18:56] them as it was when I put in there my
[1:18:58] wife would have lost confidence in me by
[1:19:00] that time
[1:19:01] but the whole thing is based on on
[1:19:03] Deception he said why does the nation
[1:19:05] why does this nation let the people be
[1:19:07] deceived there's death in the drinking
[1:19:09] of whiskey rape murder Insanity in the
[1:19:11] bottle but yet we're allowed to put it
[1:19:12] on our programs and advertise it as the
[1:19:14] kind that grandfather drank more joy out
[1:19:16] of life certain kind of beverages a beer
[1:19:19] and alcohol was it what is it it's
[1:19:20] deceiving uh the only place you can go
[1:19:22] to get some truth is the word of God
[1:19:25] that's something that you can hang
[1:19:27] everything on you can hang your soul you
[1:19:28] can hang your life on it the word of God
[1:19:31] is truth even to the point where truth
[1:19:33] was standing there in front of pilate
[1:19:34] and he asked pilate said well what is
[1:19:36] truth and truth was standing right there
[1:19:37] in front of him truth oh
[1:19:40] brother Adam said no church will clean
[1:19:42] your soul no Creed can clean your soul
[1:19:44] only the blood of Jesus Christ can
[1:19:45] cleans your soul that's God's remedy
[1:19:48] the only way to stay in Divine
[1:19:50] Fellowship was keep that word that's why
[1:19:53] in John chapter 15 it says if you abide
[1:19:55] in me and my words abide in you you
[1:19:57] shall ask what we will what you will and
[1:19:59] it shall be done unto you
[1:20:02] that's the only way you can have Divine
[1:20:04] Fellowship is to keep God's word
[1:20:08] and did you know brother Raymond said
[1:20:10] that there is no better class of people
[1:20:12] in the world
[1:20:14] than those who keep God's word
[1:20:16] that's the best
[1:20:18] so sitting here this afternoon as our
[1:20:21] eyes are starting to look in different
[1:20:22] directions
[1:20:25] I just want to declare to you that this
[1:20:27] is the best class of people there is you
[1:20:29] are the best
[1:20:30] [Applause]
[1:20:35] if you keep God's word you are the best
[1:20:37] class of people that there is period the
[1:20:39] best class of people you are the best
[1:20:40] the better than better than anything
[1:20:43] else that the world can offer better
[1:20:44] than all the millionaire clubs better
[1:20:46] than all the secret societies better
[1:20:48] than better than the president you are
[1:20:50] the best you're the better you're the
[1:20:52] better than all of it Psalm 119 it says
[1:20:54] blessed are the undefiled in the way who
[1:20:56] walk in the law of the Lord blessed are
[1:20:59] they that keep his testimonies and that
[1:21:00] seek him with the whole heart that's
[1:21:01] where it comes from in the scripture
[1:21:03] blessed are they undefiled in the way
[1:21:05] you are our blessed people
[1:21:09] brother Ram said we all know there's a
[1:21:10] God and if God is so correct with his
[1:21:12] word and so determined that he'll judge
[1:21:14] the people by his word that he's got to
[1:21:16] preserve a word somewhere to judge the
[1:21:18] people by and the Bible the Bible is it
[1:21:20] don't you forget that
[1:21:22] the Bible was it don't you forget that
[1:21:25] so you young ladies as you're reading
[1:21:27] your romance novels and your young man
[1:21:28] is you're watching Marvel comic movies
[1:21:30] and things don't you forget the Bible is
[1:21:33] where you're going to be judged by the
[1:21:34] Bible is it the Box somebody needs to
[1:21:37] make a t-shirt with that on it the Bible
[1:21:38] is it don't you forget that the Bible is
[1:21:41] it
[1:21:43] because Psalm 119 says forever O Lord
[1:21:45] Thy word is settled in heaven forever o
[1:21:47] word Thy word is settled in heaven Thy
[1:21:49] word is the thing that settles
[1:21:51] everything you can build your whole
[1:21:52] foundation on that that Oneness in
[1:21:55] Fellowship the Oneness and fellowship in
[1:21:56] the Garden of Eden was broke between God
[1:21:58] and his children the minute she
[1:22:00] disbelieved one little paragraph one
[1:22:03] little word of God
[1:22:05] oh you see how it comes across I can't
[1:22:07] be healed I can't have peace he won't
[1:22:09] back up his promises he's not the same
[1:22:10] as today as he was yesterday God don't
[1:22:13] care about me I know a better way one
[1:22:15] word off one word what's one word off to
[1:22:18] take away a promise from a believer
[1:22:21] or to add some kind of something else
[1:22:23] they got to do on top of it add some
[1:22:24] additional requirement take take one
[1:22:27] word away or add one word to it and now
[1:22:30] you've got the whole situation mixed up
[1:22:31] now you've got death thrown in
[1:22:33] to take one word a or you can't be
[1:22:36] healed you can't have peace
[1:22:38] but God said you can if we'll just
[1:22:41] believe God
[1:22:45] let me skip through some of this
[1:22:47] now
[1:22:48] and I'm gonna I'm not gonna go through
[1:22:51] my whole note shell so be at ease
[1:22:54] have peace
[1:22:57] now look look where brother I just
[1:22:59] really want we got to get this in to
[1:23:01] meditate on what happened when Eve
[1:23:03] disbelieved got one word and compare
[1:23:05] that what happens when you believe God's
[1:23:07] word he said what what happened when he
[1:23:10] said disbelieving God's word caused
[1:23:12] everything to fall apart what happened
[1:23:14] her thinking changed oh yeah her
[1:23:16] thinking changed now how did it change
[1:23:19] her fellowship with her husband wasn't
[1:23:21] right now see God's got this picture of
[1:23:24] what a perfect perfect Fellowship should
[1:23:25] look like how everything should look and
[1:23:28] then one word off breaks breaks it all
[1:23:30] as soon as you break one word off off
[1:23:32] what happened or thinking wasn't right
[1:23:35] so she started passing the book and
[1:23:37] what's she doing Pride starts coming in
[1:23:39] that ain't my fault it's his fault oh
[1:23:42] you see you'll see that Here Comes The
[1:23:43] Devil as soon as she took one word off
[1:23:46] here comes pride in
[1:23:48] that's how you get that family situation
[1:23:50] messed up that's how you get your home
[1:23:52] your church messed up is you one word
[1:23:54] off and then Here Comes pride in to say
[1:23:56] well there ain't nothing wrong with the
[1:23:57] way I'm doing it and then a few chapters
[1:23:59] later see I got a man from God didn't I
[1:24:01] I got a man from God and of course we
[1:24:03] know brother Brown said every child
[1:24:05] comes from God but look at look at the
[1:24:07] Spirit which we see she's saying that
[1:24:09] she's saying that with this prideful I
[1:24:11] know I'm right nobody's gonna tell me
[1:24:13] wrong and she began to pass the book her
[1:24:16] thinking was actually changed now that's
[1:24:19] what happens when you get one word off
[1:24:21] now think about what happens when you
[1:24:23] get all the word restored then your
[1:24:26] thinking is repaired your thinking comes
[1:24:28] back you start thinking right now now
[1:24:31] the brother Brown said why why was your
[1:24:33] thinking wrong she had the life of the
[1:24:36] Devil in Her exactly as soon as she
[1:24:39] disbelieved God's word she accepted the
[1:24:42] life of the devil
[1:24:44] because she accepted his teaching she
[1:24:47] disbelieved God's word and it
[1:24:49] disassociated her from God because in
[1:24:51] her right then was the life of the devil
[1:24:54] she had believed his lie said the fruits
[1:24:56] is good and she'd partake them with him
[1:24:59] that's right oh there's the answer to
[1:25:01] the question why does one word off bring
[1:25:04] death why how did they die because as
[1:25:06] soon as you take one word off then Here
[1:25:08] Comes The Devil in to just take things
[1:25:10] over and now down into the grave you go
[1:25:13] that is how we're going to take a
[1:25:16] Rapture is by not being one word off but
[1:25:19] you see that's sometimes we just kind of
[1:25:21] cabbage down and say well I don't really
[1:25:23] see the benefit of of sitting through
[1:25:25] maybe a long service of listening and
[1:25:27] really really hanging on to every word
[1:25:29] because it's going to take the full word
[1:25:32] of God to bring you back into full Unity
[1:25:35] with God so that you can take a body
[1:25:37] change you're you're going to go by the
[1:25:40] grave if there's one word off one word
[1:25:43] off brings death because why you're
[1:25:46] doubting God and you're you're accepting
[1:25:48] the LIE of the devil and you're
[1:25:49] accepting the life of his devil to to
[1:25:51] move around your memory reason
[1:25:53] Consciousness affection to to mess
[1:25:56] around with your spirit Realm
[1:25:59] instead of loving her husband and
[1:26:00] telling the truth she lied she should
[1:26:03] have said brother Brown said she should
[1:26:04] have said he's innocent I gave it to him
[1:26:06] because what pride pride is failing to
[1:26:09] admit you're wrong the Oneness with her
[1:26:11] and her husband was gone the Oneness of
[1:26:13] them and God was gone and every church
[1:26:15] that doesn't take the whole of God's
[1:26:16] word the same thing happens
[1:26:19] oh to think now to think now that you a
[1:26:22] born-again Christian can still be
[1:26:23] influenced by the devil in your spirit
[1:26:25] Realm
[1:26:27] now that might be hard to swallow but
[1:26:29] think about a little bit and battle it
[1:26:31] out think about what the greatest battle
[1:26:32] ever fought was that God will come God
[1:26:34] will come and tell you tell you the
[1:26:36] truth and the devil will come and tell
[1:26:37] you a lie and in your spirit realm you
[1:26:39] can still battle it out whether to
[1:26:41] accept it or reject it or not
[1:26:45] but God gave us his spirit and his truth
[1:26:48] to overcome to that
[1:26:49] God promised to bring us back into
[1:26:52] Fellowship back into Unity back into
[1:26:54] Oneness that was the promise that he
[1:26:55] made in the garden in Genesis 3 15 and I
[1:26:58] will put enmity between thee and the
[1:26:59] woman and between thy seed and her seed
[1:27:01] it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[1:27:03] bruise his heel that's the reason that
[1:27:06] it takes it takes a union
[1:27:11] I'm trying to find a closing spot y'all
[1:27:13] y'all make y'all make the clock makes me
[1:27:15] nervous y'all make me nervous
[1:27:21] and you'll never
[1:27:22] you'll never be
[1:27:25] oh let me skip through that
[1:27:29] very good
[1:27:37] I'll go ahead with that and do more
[1:27:39] clothes you'll never be United with
[1:27:41] God's word until you separate from the
[1:27:42] word that's where my topic separation to
[1:27:46] Unity that you've got to be separated
[1:27:48] before you can Unite
[1:27:50] and in second Corinthians it says
[1:27:52] wherefore come out from among them and
[1:27:53] be ye separate saith the Lord and touch
[1:27:55] not the unclean thing and I will receive
[1:27:57] you now if you go study this out the
[1:27:58] message one this brother bam explains
[1:28:00] that he said that was God's purpose from
[1:28:02] the very beginning that he told Adam and
[1:28:04] Eve to multiply and replenish the Earth
[1:28:06] and his purpose was for them to go and
[1:28:08] spread out all through the Earth and
[1:28:10] then he would deal with each one
[1:28:11] individually and then he would bring
[1:28:13] them back to himself so that's what he's
[1:28:15] doing he's actually fulfilling that same
[1:28:16] purpose now through the preaching of the
[1:28:18] Gospel as we've spread out from the day
[1:28:20] of Pentecost when the the life of God
[1:28:23] was separated into all the individuals
[1:28:24] and now it's spread out through all the
[1:28:26] world separated and God is dealing with
[1:28:28] people as individuals individually to
[1:28:31] bring them back to himself but you see
[1:28:33] you got to be separate you got to be
[1:28:35] separated from the world before you can
[1:28:37] be United
[1:28:39] it's Ephesians 5 11 it says have no
[1:28:41] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[1:28:42] darkness but rather reprove them and
[1:28:44] James 4 4 it says ye adulterers and
[1:28:46] adulteresses know you not that the
[1:28:48] Friendship of the world is enmity with
[1:28:50] God you you got to be separate you can't
[1:28:52] you see if you're hanging around friends
[1:28:55] that are taking you farther away from
[1:28:56] God they're not really your friends if
[1:28:58] you're hanging around somebody that's if
[1:29:00] you've got a girlfriend or a boyfriend
[1:29:01] that's not bringing you closer to God
[1:29:03] and they're just taking you into the
[1:29:04] depths of Satan they're not they're not
[1:29:05] a good candidate for a good spouse
[1:29:08] you want somebody that's going to draw
[1:29:10] you closer to God so you got to be
[1:29:13] separated God's calling us to be
[1:29:15] separated and first Peter it says as
[1:29:17] obedient children not fashioning
[1:29:18] ourselves according to the former lust
[1:29:20] in your ignorance you've got to be
[1:29:22] separate you can't be going back to the
[1:29:24] way that you used to be you've got to be
[1:29:25] living a separate life in first John 2
[1:29:28] 15 and 16 it says love not the world
[1:29:30] neither the things that are in the world
[1:29:31] if any man love the world the love of
[1:29:33] the father is not even in him so that
[1:29:35] just shows that if your heart's not in
[1:29:36] the right place if you're not if you
[1:29:38] don't love God there's something wrong
[1:29:40] there's something wrong
[1:29:42] brother Brian said here you are a pit
[1:29:44] Brethren you Pentecost the weaklings so
[1:29:45] God separated you and sent you out to be
[1:29:48] an inner denomination you can't
[1:29:49] denominate Pentecost sent you out to be
[1:29:52] his people God see God doesn't want you
[1:29:54] to unite around man's ideas he doesn't
[1:29:57] might want you to unite just around
[1:29:59] Fellowship that's not God's plan and
[1:30:01] purpose but the way that he's going to
[1:30:03] unite us with himself is by his word and
[1:30:06] that is the only way by his spirit and
[1:30:08] by his truth and that's the only way we
[1:30:11] can throw our arms around somebody that
[1:30:13] don't believe like us and say I love you
[1:30:14] we're United but that don't make you
[1:30:16] United what's going to make us United
[1:30:18] together is like on the day of Pentecost
[1:30:19] then when they got together in one
[1:30:21] Accord they started thinking together
[1:30:23] about the promise of God that God had
[1:30:25] given them and they began to get in one
[1:30:26] Accord because they were sick in the
[1:30:28] Holy Ghost the spirit and the truth is
[1:30:30] what is going to bring us together in
[1:30:31] Union Unite with God through what a
[1:30:34] separated individual experience
[1:30:37] a separated individual experience you
[1:30:40] and God alone and then we can join
[1:30:43] together and have Fellowship that's
[1:30:44] what's going to unite us together as the
[1:30:46] musicians come brother around and said
[1:30:48] you took the Pentecostal church and
[1:30:49] United it into an organization God never
[1:30:52] did want it United he wanted it
[1:30:54] separated never United with the world
