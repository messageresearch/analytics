========================================
more than I that I Surrender yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] amen amen is that your desire every day I live what we think sometimes like brother John said you know we we think we're losing but nothing a Believer can't lose a True Believer a born again Believer cannot lose uh you may have some battles that you get knocked down a little bit but the war is already won amen and uh sometimes you know I uh Robert E Lee said one time at Gettysburg they won't even continue on continue on and Robert E Lee he looked at his captains and he said we're finished with this battle he said let's live to find another one and so they retreated back or he knew they was going to get wiped out amen so we we listened to our general sometimes we have to we don't retreat we just have to stop for a little while let the captain of the host take over he takes over we can't lose right but if we try it sometimes we fail good to be in the house of the Lord good to have each and every one of you here good to

we're still on son of man part 83 now so uh Stevens 200 and something so yeah well we're going to talk a little bit about adoption like he his pastor's brother Stephen Shambo and he's a teacher kind of like we are and and of course he preaches about three hours at a time right John thank you okay yeah time flies when you're having fun so anyway let's remember brother Aaron he's a brother JT Padgett today uh ministering for him remember brother JT he had an accident with a saw and it got the better of his finger so uh we pray that uh what the Lord's already healed him but we pray that the doctors put everything back Wednesday and I talked to him yesterday and he's doing fine but just keep him in your prayer brother Aaron's preaching for him today also brother Aaron will be preaching for us Wednesday night so just keep that in your prayer thank you for those of you that come to the prayer service last night I enjoy him more and more because it makes where you just kind of get in your little bubble and you pray all right I like that uh remember Bob and Louise we're all keeping up with them on what's out in the different um social media and and looks like brother Bob was not holding back the other night when he was preaching so and bro pray for brother Louise because he's preaching and then preaching when Bob preaches so just remember him you know for uh in interpreting so but they'll be back on the 23rd so they've still got you know a whole week next week to uh to be moving around traveling around and then when they get back on the 28th of this month we'll have our youth service starting at three o'clock brother Daryl Ward will be with us he'll also be with us the next day one service and we want that's kind of usually when we have our prayer services we have a special meeting afterwards and I believe that the special meetings we've had last year all were wonderful they were good preachers and we got some good out of it all right also remember February the 11th is the Valentine's banquet our brother Dutch Scott will be speaking for us for a little while that Saturday night and then he'll be with us on Sunday one service sign up she is downstairs uh you can bring a guest with you um a guest couple it has to be couples if not singles has to be couples all right so we would all like for all of you to come we'll have a catered meal and we will uh we'll have some fun we have some games and prizes and different things and what goes on there stays there somebody said thank you so I'll remember that also we got a wedding on March 24th I'll get these in here in a minute downstairs there's a thing you can look at you know and go online and do kind of like you did with um with Lily and Zach so remember hmm everybody has to RSVP by February the 10th so says the bride to be February the 10th all right and it will be in Beaufort South Carolina about a four hour drive from here so just keep that in mind if you want to go all right remember Sister June this morning she's doing better yesterday was her third day and it was a little rough but she's made it through and the pain is just very minimal and she's doing well so we appreciate the prayers and all the cards and the letters and the teddy bears and all those things we appreciate that sister June loves you all and y'all love her I know amen that's why brother Brown said please love my family it doesn't matter if you love me love my family all right also remember we're gonna when we pray we'll need to pray for sister Freda she can't breathe very well this morning she just called in so let's just remember that in prayer and I want to tell you something a little comical my talking about brother John was talking about you know saving all that money you know and I I used to buy a lot of stuff from Bass Pro Shop but I was telling a friend of mine I said man he was an older gentleman and I said man I said John I said I said they were giving us 20 percent I said I spent a hundred dollars and and they give me 20 back or you know I I saved 20 he said no son he said you spent 80. and that's what they wanted you to do so don't don't get it wrong that you're saving 20 no you're spending 80. all right so so keep that in mind when they give you a discount listen those people don't make money and have them big towers and big buildings and big salaries by giving you all their money they still make it only 80 so let's that you know like Walmart's not gonna go out of business if they give you 50 off okay so just remember that and also well sister Gwen remember her and the family there went and saw the family last night at the hospital uh Kip the one we've been praying for let's just keep him in Praise the Lord raise him up out of that and they've got a decision they need to make tomorrow so we're going to pray that the Lord will help them to make the right decision and uh I pray that his soul gets saved that that's more than anything more than anything is pray for salvation of his soul so let's remember all these things in our prayer remember Sister Freda and let's just go to the Lord in prayer remember Bob and Louise they've got a lot of work to do so we're praying for them so let's bow our hands Lord Jesus thank you for this day that you give us father we stand here Lord with the cream of the crop nowhere else would I want to be Lord and with the bride of Jesus Christ and Lord now we've assembled together as you said together to listen to you father so move this vessel out of the way Lord move this move these lips of clay yourself that I won't say anything Lord against you father I pray this should be with each one in the building there'll be any sick among us Lord we pray you should heal them Lord a Special Touch for sister free the Lord that she'll breathe better father we know she's struggling and going through but Lord you're you're the provider you're Jehovah Jireh You Are the Healer Lord You're all the different compound names but we know you as Jesus Christ and we know you as our personal Savior and as the holy ghost that lives in our soul father we pray that you would just be with each one Lord in the Foreign Fields Luis and brother Bob there Lord speaking and going around with all the group there brother Michael and Sister Jordan and sister uh Nyla and the girls and Christine Lord we pray that you should bless them give them fruit for their labor father that's what we've been praying Lord if we see something that will help our youth Lord to know that that what a privileged place we do get to live in America and Lord at the things that we have that we take for granted I pray Lord that we'll not take those things for granted anymore that will cherish them Father the time we have here in a good air conditioner and heated building with lights and and restrooms inside the building Lord we've been to many places where they had none of that and Lord they still worship you but God you made them a home you give them a future home that promised it by the baptism of the Holy Ghost we're all going to the same place we're not going to have big eyes and little Hues we're not going to have a HUD or a shack you said we'd have a mansion you said it'd be a transparent goal and that we would live there for an eternity father Lord just hasten the day that we can see you in that form Lord we pray now Lord until then that you'll touch us Lord be with us keep us safe dear brother John and sister eat it they travel back lord we love them with the love of the Lord and we appreciate the spirit Lord that they bring with them Father we pray now that you're being with us in the furthermore this service in Jesus name we pray amen we're still on who is this son of man this would be part 83 and we're going to talk a little bit about uh we're going to insert adoption just for a moment because when we start up this statue of perfect man you've got to be able to talk about adoption because that's what it is growth development that's what the statue of perfect man is adoption that's growth development that's what it is all right so make it real simple I want to read you a quote real quick brother round said try and do God a service I was thinking about this morning we were talking about this me and somebody the other day said watch how close it gets to that Razor Edge between right and wrong remember it'll fall on one side or the other you better get off the fence because that's the sharp edge you better get off the fence amen because you're going to go one way or the other it's a honed razor between the difference of right and wrong it's got to be every word of God not just almost every word not just almost every word but every word and it's got down today not lutherans not Methodist not Pentecostal but to the home days in this age where the Antichrist anointing is so perfect it would seem to deceive the very leg amen so let's come back to the razor's Edge and get on the right side okay let's read in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt Among Us that's not two thousand years ago that's today and if you're born again today you are the word made flesh you know the second person of a trinity you're not the third person of a trinity your God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory of the glory the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth and we're going to talk a little bit we're going to get through virtue and into knowledge maybe the Lord within this afternoon we touched on a little bit the other day but there is a tree of knowledge of Good and Evil and then there's a tree of life all right so there's two different types of knowledge it's okay to have worldly knowledge to live in the world and do your math and do your science and do your social studies and all that but that's all contrary to the word of God and that's the knowledge that we're looking for now because history can tell you their slant this is not a slant this is what happened and this is what's going to happen all right so it's our absolute is the Bible amen so out of the ground may the Lord God to grow every tree that's Pleasant to the site and good for food then it stops that's talking about trees with roots right these two next trees don't have Roots except feet that's what he's talking about now he says stop right here see that little thing says stop the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge I'm going to even look where it places the Tree of Life in the midst or in the middle of the garden we're going to look at it just demand a chart this is where God the tree of life is in your soul the tree of knowledge of Good and Evil can work all the way around that but if you're born again today that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil will not enter in your soul if you're born again if you're not born again you are that tree of knowledge of Good and Evil I know that hurts your feelings but I'm sorry it's time to tell the truth you're either born again or you're not that's just the way it is you may be seated Lord has blessing to the reason his word Isaiah 28 verse 9 says look who shall teach knowledge and Whom Shall he make to understand Doctrine who them that are weaned from the milk and drawn from the breast in other words I had a little bitty glass of milk this morning I had it with my gravy and biscuit but I'm not going to have a glass of milk today with my hot dog that my son so graciously brought today don't let don't talk about hot dogs just leave it alone it's round steak just like bologna round steak don't tell me where it come from all right because I know where it came from I'm not gonna have any milk with that I'm gonna have something else because I'm going to eat meat and that's what we need to be we need to God's not going to come back and get a group of people that are novices he's not going to get a group of people that are babies remember I'm going to read your scripture in just a few minutes we've been reading before in Revelations 19 it says his wife has made herself ready I mean we become a bride we're sure you have a bride and you get married and you do things but man when it comes to like June and I'll be 44 years coming up in in October this year and and you know it's kind of scary but and it is true we kind of think alike a little bit y'all think June yeah June thinks like me sometimes that's on tape it's scary for some of you but she does and then I think like her and because why because we've been together so long we've been connected together so long so what about with the word of God though because we're two separate people with two separate ideas could be but with God there's not two ideas there's just one idea and man that's God's idea and that one works every time so we just need to be what part of that don't have in the mind of Christ as we've been talking about and that's what all this is going to be is we're going to hone it down to having the mind of Christ we'll skip this uh this one right here let's go uh pull the chart up please and we'll look at the chart we've been working on and for those of you that's not seen this chart it's a chart that brother uh I think brother Joe got it from somewhere but it's a chart that uh make it a little bit bigger please there you go thank you Abby let's give Abby a hand back there and Mercy that's the only two back there right man goodness gracious two girls that'll tell you guys something so this is what we're talking about this is the real you this is your soul this is only Faith or doubt there is no in between there is no special something I'm sorry I know there's doctrines in the message said you had this little got this little seed laying here well brother Brown said to see the faith or doubt they both can't be in there at the same time faith is God doubt is the devil all right so God is not in your soul when you're born I am so sorry to tell you that oh I got quotes well you know what brother Brown said I read you one the other day for brother Brown said I was born a kookaburra and then a wheat germ was put inside of me okay so it's just it's terminologies a lot of times that we get to I just know one thing's for sure what I did in my life before I was born again God was nowhere to be seen inside of me or I wouldn't have done what I did so let's just keep it at that let's look at good old-fashioned salvation all right I was born in sin shaping iniquity especially my mother's womb born a liar and brother Brown said doomed and on your way to hell how you going to be in hell if you got faith all right so God gives us the new birth listen a woman doesn't come here with seed she has to be given seed all right the seed word of God God don't have seed like we do like sperm the word is the seed so inside the word somewhere what did we have faith in James Dobson Walmart we have faith in what the word the seed of life is the word of God but anyway down in our soul is Faith or doubt one of the two and we got to understand I was thinking about this yesterday now brother Brown talks about he says about uh you know you could be born again and and you know how not have a real emotion but it will be an experience all right I just believe one thing's for sure brother John if I was over in another dimension the day I got born again there was a lot of screaming demons trying to claw their way back into my soul I'm just I'm just honest because that's where the unclean Spirit comes out that unclean spirit is in your soul it's attached to your nature because you're born in what a damn it world of damn it nature you were born with doubt then we come to the realization that we're lost I needed something I needed a change all right so what happened inside of here the unclean Spirit goes out of the man walks in dry places seek his wrath findeth none comes back and see a little hole right there comes back in and finds the house swept in garnished or sanctified you're coming to church you're reading your Bible you're doing the things of God you're not going to The Honky tones you're not going you're not you know doing the things that you used to do before you're you're what you're trying you're filling this up with with the Holy Spirit not the spirit you had before everybody with me say Amen all right so what you got to do is is you got to cap that thing off God will seal you in and he can't get out the devil can't get in I say that God said he can't get out God's not going to give you the Holy Ghost right here and then pull it back away from you we'll read here in just a minute on adoption you got to learn that when we're when we're born again it puts us in the family of God we are a son and daughter of God all right with faith in the word of God then we have to come to adoption or growth period to where we can all these listen we're born with memories and conscious affection imagination but guess what that was all used for the devil at one period in time right so now if we're born again in our soul our soul doesn't need redeeming it's already redeemed everybody with me this part is what we need redeemed remember don't worry about the body I don't care you can be born again for 80 years if the Lord tears your body's gonna die because the curse but this is not sin it's under the same curse but this doesn't make you sin it is sin but inside of us what to while we're looking for a body change because this isn't because this is not this is going to die this is going to deteriorate so don't say my flesh made me do it no your flesh didn't make you do it that guy right there made you do it he didn't listen to this guy this guy if you're born again well come on somebody you're not listening to the end what I tell you a year ago let it out well we want to not we don't want to take and put a a a big ring around that and not let it out we need to let out what's inside of you whether it's good or bad all right because that unclean Spirit has got to come out of you it can't stay there anybody with me so then we got memories and conscious faction imagination now those flus you God can't look I'm sorry God can't stop those up because he gave you this is where you got to be in the word of God be in the Bible listen to the correct word of God that tells you that Satan can still play with your memory Satan can still play with your affection listen you don't love your wife in that inner Realm no no you either love God or the devil right here this is where you love your wife anybody with me but if you got the love of God it'll teach you how to love your wife it'll teach you how to love your brother and listen you know what he'll do right up there he'll teach you how to love people I hate you yeah yeah it's real easy to love people that love you but it's not real easy to love somebody that you know hates you but that's what that's growth development that's all of us growing up in Grace and knowledge so sanctification in that real inner realm if all that unclean Spirit goes out you have faith in your soul you are born again you are a son and daughter of God there's no way you cannot be if you're born again now if you're not this is where brother Branham is real clear and the spirit of this age is what you can have the Holy Spirit where on your spirit Realm thank you love God Prophet said but you love the devil you can reason memory card you have all these working in a spiritual religious Realm and be dead right here and lost and go to hell that's right brother so you can have it you can have the Holy Ghost on your spirit every day in your life and dying go to hell why because you never as we're going to read I think I've got it for either today or or this evening where they come say Lord have I not done Mighty works in your name have I not spoken tongues have I not in other words preached the message of the hour for 40 years but it never came from here it came from anointing of God anointing for this age Joel says I'll pour out my spirit on what All Flesh everybody's anointed listen the devil was the number one anointing guy right so he put his anointing out and God's got an anointing that he put out and thank god brother Brown priest I you know you've heard why I said it brother one time said when he first came in a message that he was doing just fine until he listened to anointed ones at the end time Bill Johnson said it scared him to death it should because that's the deception of this age not another age this age if you can sit in church listen praise the Lord a preacher can stand up here how many times have I told you I listened to a preacher preach about the Millennium that he preached it so good I still have notes off what that brother preached and while he was standing in the Pulpit he was sleeping with a 14 year old girl he didn't have anything right here he was he had got under an anointing and he preached the gospel you know what God allowed him to do it but your Folly will be made manifest somewhere down the road all right somewhere down the road you're gonna fall off somewhere down the road that Razor's Edge you're either going to go what this way or this way and with a razor once you slide off one side how you ever gonna get back to Center you can't you got to go back to here and get on this side all right that's why it's a Razor's Edge this whole thing is a is a fine line between an anointing and Truth all right so now if the unclean Spirit goes out of your soul and God fills your soul with the Holy Ghost then what are we working on now what are we working on now we're working on the spirit Realm we're working on the memory region conscious affection imagination because that's where you are going to come to adoption that's where brother Brown said power without character it's satanic power without character that's those people that preach and have all kind of power and signs and lying wonders and we're going to read about that in a little bit but they never come to the what knowledge of the truth well I believe brother Brown was a prophet yes the devil does too folks he knew when that man stood up there he said do you don't you hear that demon screaming to that demon over there I pray that one day we get to that spot right I don't care if I wanna I don't know if I want to hear him or not I'd scare you to death but I want them to be so scared that they don't even want to come into this building didn't brother Brown Say didn't the Bible say a sinner would not be able to sit in the congregation of the righteous toward the end I'm just telling you Bible why because that thing inside of you is going to be screaming I don't want that but oh there's going to be a group of people it's gonna say that's not me that and nothing else there's a group of people on the Earth today brother John I believe that I believe I'm looking at some of them I you know you always uh the devil does the devil ever talk to y'all hey Mike okay well then I just thought maybe it was me the devil told me that I said I was praying the other day I said Lord I want this church to be like the church at Ephesus now we got more than 12 obviously but they were all filled with the Holy Ghost they were all 12 people but they all felt were filled the Holy Ghost I said I want all my people filled with the Holy Ghost everybody I come in contact with everybody in this building I want to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their soul make your job easier about that much but not that much because we still got that other man to work on but you know what the devil said the devil said he said now you don't think brother you don't think the devil quote brother random he said you know the prophet said they'd be made Believers True Believers and unbelievers in every every congregation sometime on Wednesday night the other Wednesday night when I was home with June they went to the field y'all here y'all just look around see what's going on sometime boy you get them quiet don't you that's what the devil said but you know I said devil I said that's okay but you did say we have Believers in there all right so we got Believers make Believers unbelievers in every congregation but you know what I want those unbelievers and mate Believers to become Believers because they can it's not it's not it's not unfathomable that every one of you can have the Holy Ghost and that you can all have an experience with God inside your soul and then what does God want to do he doesn't want to leave you a baby he doesn't just take the baby and put you over in the corner and say good looking baby now he wants you to feed the baby he wants that baby to grow up we'll talk about that in just a few minutes if he'll give me a little Grace here but listen to this you want to know how in the world why how are we going to get this power how are we going to get these virtues how's these things going to work in our life go ahead and pull the next quote up blind brought a mess brother around said just like the brass serpent the serpent didn't have no virtue it was a piece of brass they brought up out of Egypt neither did the poll have any virtue not a bit but it was obeying what God Said do God tells us to forsake not the assembling of ourselves together if you don't do that you're not obeying God's word obey is greater than what sacrifice well my kids are home this weekend I've done told you that's the worst example of a Christian you could be is stay home because you're unbelieving kids are home with you drag them to church or tell them to do something else while you go to church I told you a long time ago Jim's dad when we first come back to the Lord Jim's dad lovely man I wish you I wish he was born again he'd be a real good believer because he thinks goodness is going to get him to Heaven just being a good man and we pray for him we still pray for him that the Lord will turn that into a new birth but you know they always said always we you know they know your family knows your life more than anybody else they see you every day of the week and they see you in your history of what you were before oh he'll be he'll you know he will he that that's just something temporary he'll he'll be right back you know the way he does and then he comes over on Saturday him and his wife comes over on Saturday and then they stay for Sunday and they want us to stay home so we can go do something because he's going to take us out eat or he's going to give us some money or he's going to do something well guess what the first thing we did we said Eugene that's fine you stay right here the coffee's over there food's in the refrigerator we'll be back about five o'clock or you can go with us and meet these great people that we're around I know I told you many times before I tell John and eating my my father-in-law thought my dad was the only person that believed brother around was a prophet just a little crazy cult that we had but you know what God did you've heard my story before you know what God did God allowed him to come to our house and their step brother prakash from India he allowed him to come one weekend and that was brother Keith Reed from Jamaica that was brother George Quinn from Ireland and all these brothers come and then they're like he's like well who believes this thing and I I said this worldwide it's not just something that Samuel Dale uh you know concocted up and found us this one prophet and we're all believing it and that's it no but God allowed him to see that there's more than just a cult sometimes we're not even a good cult because the cult does what the leader tells him to do come on somebody haha just saying what brought the power or The Virtue is obedience to the word of God amen okay you say how can I do that read your Bible and pray that is your obedience this is the curriculum there is no other book this is the curriculum all right we have 1100 enhanced versions of that amen nobody with me the prophet of God had to because we'll read it here in just a minute well a little bit later on where that he had to come back there had to be an anointing come in the end time to take us back to the word of God the true word of God men had a part of the word of God Luther had a little bit of light Wesley had a little bit of light Pentecost had a little bit of light but they didn't have the full light like I said before you tell the people when you're talking to them say look they said well you just you know they call Brother Donny's Church the skirt Church well now the Bible tells the sisters not to wear pants right it's in the Bible I don't care if it's in the Old Testament or new because the Ten Commandments is in the Old Testament too you're going to throw them out huh Jesus was in the Old Testament you want to throw him out amen but who told you you didn't have to wear them dress Ed wasn't God and the devil that's only two powers that they are all right same way with cutting hair and all that other stuff all the other things that we we it's in the Bible we can read it out of the Bible who told you you could do something different that's where all these denominations come from that's where all these and look at the Methodist Church now the Methodist Church is getting ready to implode they don't know what to do have a gay priest Martin Luther John Wesley would have a heart attack if they were here watching what happened to their because look but remember Razor's Edge got off the word and just kept going off if they elect gay priests and all that stuff in the Methodist Church well you know they're dead anyway but it's really going to be people are going to pull away maybe we'll get them to the truth there's a lot of people looking for truth out there folks you talk to people they are not satisfied with their denomination because it's not taking them anywhere there's nothing for them oh yeah we'll just go to church and you know you can do that in a lodge you can do the things they do in the Baptist Church in the lodge then you can go outside and smoke and drink do whatever you know must be like the world but we're different we're different because God's inside of us because God's different because they they said Jesus your bills above you're you're the prince of devils you're a Wine Drinker you you run around with Sinners and prostitutes they called him a devil and he was the word of God he was all this right here plus the head and they called him that what are they gonna call me and you same identical thing brother Ryan said we're not building an organization I'm not here in the building organization Christ never said sent me to build organization Christ sent me to build individuals Christ sent me to build individuals to the stature of Jesus Christ that they might be what the powerhouse dunamis Dynamite blow all this other stuff out of the way that they might be the PowerHouse look and the dwelling place of the Spirit by his word by his word see build up the individual to that place then we were talking about the third pull because brother Ram said one time he's talking about virtue he said the woman the woman at the uh that touched the Hem of His Garment she pulled virtue out of him all right so let's look at the third pull just for a few minutes or three pulls because we want to I know there's some new ones here that don't understand this but just put this this is justification sanctification this is your walk all right this is our walk interpreted by a prophet that told us the first pull was what sign in the hand outside signing a hand right the second pull was discernment he actually pulled the virtues out of the people because the people would walk up to him and he said oh I see that you're you live on 29th Street and you see you saw a doctor yesterday that wore glasses and and had a a nurse you know she had on a blue suit I mean she he was so vivid so he could he could have just said I saw you sitting there talking to the doctor now he gave him the color of the things that was in that room I said oh I see you now though I see you later on or I see a baby in your lap well what was that that was what was inside that person that person wanted to know what God had for their life and that discernment pulled the virtues out and you know what it done it cleaned a group of people up and set them aside for service brother the people would walk up to him he said oh I see you have a a warm spirit but he would also say remember I told you that one I didn't read it but I quoted it the other week that guy came up said I want to quit smoking cigarettes well brother Brown discerned that oh I see you want to quit smoking he said but your greatest problem is is you need to be born again so if you'll go get born against them cigarettes or go away you know what he's exactly right if 94 Bush should tell you sitting right there you get the Holy Ghost you don't smoke no more this is not alcohol it's Anonymous this is not Reformation this is an ex this is a change of your whole nature that's the kind of God I just I love him for that because he took a ranked Center like me and like you just took us and give us the Holy Ghost give us the greatest message that ever fall on the face of this Earth gave us a place to live gave us a place to go to church gave us an ear to hear gave us eyes to see and sometimes we just sit there and stare so the third poll then or the third part of your journey is the opening of the word God can't open the word if you don't have the Holy Ghost now look he can give you part he can give you little crumbs he gave what Ruth he gave her a handful of purpose he gave her some things he didn't give her the whole crop she went after the crop she was after the man that owned the crop amen so the opening of the word is the son of man that's the Seven Seals that's that's once we get all the way up to the top because I want people to understand that I know that those of you that are in the message you've been in a message a long time we talk about being third pool people we are not third pool people until we're second poor people we've got to have the sanctifying of that man in our spirit and soul working to where we as brother ram calls us the powerhouse and brother Brown also said he said power without character is satanic but Power with character is fit to rule so the second poll will look at the loudest in church age I took this in two parts because uh brother John you know we sometimes we quote these things and we quote them and then people go well what do you really mean by that because brother Ryan tells us now this messenger Malachi 4 and Revelation 10 7 is going to do two things why is he going to do two things one according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children to the fathers so he's going to put us back to the faith of what Paul come on Matthew John Peter that's where the faith of them bring it back to here now that's not going to take us in a Rapture though that's not going to change our body it didn't change theirs we've got to come to a place though to where God can use us by the statue of perfect man or the revelation of the Son of God which is the Holy Ghost inside of you in that what in that control room working his way out everybody with me on this but the third poll then is number the second part that brother Brown would come to do are the messenger of Malachi for he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelations 10 which are the revelations contained in those Seven Seals it'll be these divinely revealed mystery truths so in other words we got to go up a little bit higher that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal fathers exactly so so watch the seals the seals are the son of man that's the headstone coming back to the church that's what we need for a body change and that's also what we need to draw us or pull us up into that statue of perfect man to pull us up into another dimension because you know what we're not of this dimension we're of another world people look for aliens we're not green we're humans but we're hidden by God to walk into this world Jesus was so hid they thought he was the devil he was so hid they thought he was that he was a wine bibber they thought he was he didn't wash his hands we'll read that in just a minute because I want you to see what he called these people we're going to get to that if we don't get anything else everybody with me because you think oh here's the Prince of Peace he's just so lovely he's so wonderful he's so kind he's the same guy that planted ropes he's the same guy that's fixing to call call his disciples stupid remember brother Dale he said I want to use that word I need to use it three or four times I don't want to use that word no it's okay to be ignorant okay everyone else said it's okay to be ignorant everybody's ignorant of certain things I'm ignorant of I can't put a car together but if I wanted to try there would there's a certain what school I got to go to somebody with me there's a certain school I got to go to to learn how to do that all right I want to learn how to be a better Christian I want to learn how to be a Powerhouse of God I want to learn how to be whether that there's a nod in my heart that I can go pray for somebody do you not want that that's what I want oh I pray don't make a mistake you're human but if it's God doing it he never will make a mistake we gotta let God take over the evening Messenger will bring back the church to the word now what is this master of Malachi for to do restore back the original Faith look the resurrection faith that's why we're heading toward folks we're not heading toward a body change yet we got to have enough Faith to bring the dead as brother John will say we got to get the dead out of the ground first what you're allowing to remain shall be changed and then we'll go on a rapture restore back the original Faith the resurrection faith that they seen Jesus after he had raised from the dead seen him working among them they were men of few words they went forth and preached a word oh they preached long that's where Stephen gets his brother Brown's quote right there they preach long enough where Paul preached 190 priests all night and a man fell out of a building and he killed him and you know what he thought here's Paul possible bless God he fell out of there because he won't listen to me no he said Hey listen he said God that's my fault I preached so long to the the humanity that the guy was sitting there and he was trying his best I believe to listen to Paul and he just got sleepy and fell out well Paul Paul if it was me I'd feel obligated to go down and pray for the guy because that partly my fault I'm going to try to keep him up all night so we're not going to do that today all right he laid his body over and brought him back to life but see what that showed power that showed the power that Paul had Paul didn't have to go fast for three days he didn't have to go do something special something he just knew in his heart you know what he did what brother Brown say how these people get healed because I enter into their situation that little lady that the little kid was healed before brother around me even touched a kid he said she was healed right over here because that mother that knew what that mother was going through with the baby and so he prayed for her and she was healed right there hard for people to realize that women can pray for the sick well praise the Lord anyhow foreign he laid his body over him and brought him back to life again look wait a minute he kept on preaching after he preached all night kept on preaching don't read that in this brother Stephen y'all be in trouble three hours is good now what's he gonna do he's going to turn the heart of the children to the fathers we're talking about this man that we caught William Bradham now it's not the man it's the message it's the anointing that he had on him now listen him and his message was one he was the Elijah of this day he yielded himself to that and became the prophet in the end time remember he was always a prophet but he had to listen it's hard to see where you that brother Brown said I used to wash my car on Sunday and watching people go to church a prophet yeah he was lost he needed saving he was going to be a murderer he was going to commit suicide twice twice he was going to kill that boy he was going to kill that man and he would have if it hadn't been for God that's the same way with me and you Satan had loved to kill us all right now but there's something God has for each and every one of us that's why you're here that's why you're listening today that's why you're at least giving God some time to soften you up remember what I we preaching a long time ago that Stony heart we're all born with it but God didn't take that Stony heart out I'm Stony heart out and put a heart of Flesh in there and then put his flesh from I mean his Spirit remember he said then he puts his Spirit that's your spirit he said that's so you can get along with yourself that's so that God can get along with you then he puts the holy spirit in then he puts his spirit in after he siphoned you up to me that's the journey that we take I know some people get born again just like that but I was just slow I'm a southerner I it took a while maybe it didn't y'all but it took me a while but I do know brother John I do know my journey I can put you through every part of that Journey can you you ought to be able to if you're born again if you're not then you're an idiot born again then you'll look back and say oh that's what that Journey was all about that's the situation I was in that's the things I'd done or didn't do to get me to where I'm at today he'll be taking the message of Pentecost to turn the children to the faith of the fathers because he'll be rebuking them what because they didn't keep this same faith they went off into tongues of the evidence they went off into trinitarianism and Tunis and all these different things Oneness so he's got to bring that Faith back to where we look when we stand here today as Christians take away the message part we stand here as Christians you gotta believe something if you say I'm a Christian today you either gotta you gotta attach yourself to Methodist Baptist Pentecostal independent Church of God you got to attach yourself to somewhere because when you say I'm a Christian then the world says why or how do you follow well sure we follow Christ I know that but if you try to follow the Methodist Church and they're fixing to put a gay woman as your leader God forbid that's in the Bible too so what are they doing though the Methodist Church is supposed to be found their foundation's supposed to be on the Bible yet they're doing what the Bible said not to do all denominations have a part of that now I've got a quote where I'm gonna read you this afternoon brother Brown says that the Church of God has the Holy Ghost now this is back in his time each one of them has the baptism of the Holy Ghost for their time for their day that was Baptist that's going to be in heaven that's going to be that's been that's born again but once you're given this message once this message is presented to you you have no cloak you either gotta accept it or rejected brother Brown said word rejecters go to hell right I'll read to you a little bit in Romans said remember when you come to the knowledge of the truth there's no more sacrifice for that sin and notice here the first to last was to come he turned the hearts of the children to the fathers and he met he correct itself because it's the hearts in other words The Saul of man in the Old Testament could not be born again right the Old Testament Saints did not have the new birth in their soul because they were only capoed or covered by the blood of bulls and goats which had no life to come back into the believer they were covered though they had an anointing they were in the Old Testament they're going to be there but they're not bride because they didn't get it in their soul because Jesus hadn't come yet the Bible plainly says they didn't get the Holy Ghost because Jesus hadn't died yet or been glorified is what the scripture says all right but they had their part they played their part how many times did Brother Brown said Moses without the Holy Ghost called down flies fleas and frogs what about me and you with the Holy Ghost that's a dish to us Joshua without the Holy Ghost standstill wow that's why brother John when he read that about you know I quoted it the other day about brother I'm saying if you had the Holy Ghost you had enough power in you to go create a world and live on it right but there's a bar holding us there it's called our Flash and it's called others that need to get burned again we don't want to go off on an island by ourselves somewhere it would be nice sometime to create a world and go live on it but I want people to be around me I want people to be with me see the old patriarch fathers the old Orthodox the legalists the law he turned it back to the faith of the fathers what John was saying behold now the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world this is a new message this is not the old message the old message was bulls and goats one priest go behind go behind the veil put the blood on the Altar and what did Brother Brown say he said they come out if they were adulterer when they walked in they were adulterer when they walked out now I'm going to tell you something you go behind this holy of holy into that Holy of holy I was talking about if you wasn't an adulterer you won't be one because that piece of you is gone that part of you has been destroyed not just covered mm-hmm the hearts of the children this new message that John was preaching of the coming Messiah hand he turned the hearts of this but watch the next time John appears now he's talking about John the spirit of Elijah not John John's not coming back everybody with me you know what he's talking about he turns out he's talk he turns the hearts of the children back to the Pentecostal fathers so it'd be back to the original message what the book of Acts and you'll know when it gets here in other words he says you got the Holy Ghost you'll know today if you got the Holy Ghost you can't go very long in another church I'm not talking about this building y'all kind of quiet you asleep I'm not looking at all of you wake up but am I not telling you the truth thank you well you can say yeah okay it'll be a restoration look to send that lukewarm letter saying church back to that original Faith back Yonder again and he will be anointed to do so so that's the anointing that we're under that we are not just Pentecostals we're Pentecost plush we're back to this plus we're Baptist plus because they all have a piece listen the very method of our worship came from the Methodist Church that's why they called it Methodist thank you because it was a method of worship and God was pleased with that method of worship all right but now what's going to happen to me and you I will restore this is the promise I will restore to you the years the Locust eat the canker worm caterpillar Palm a worm so what happened is when Jesus left the Earth they started eating on what they started eating a church and they started eating a tree it was a bride tree then brother Brown says the bride tree he started eating at the bride tree and he almost ate it down to a stump but Lord thank you that you're going to restore all that back yes to the faith of the fathers he's going to restore that gift back I not only restore the gift back to us but he's going to give us a place of adoption to where we can be placed where God can use us like he wanted to use the first church he did but they fell from their first love why they accept decrees and denominations they accepted false Doctrine and you shall eat in plenty what a promise and be what satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God you all ought to try that sometime some of you let half doubt what wondrously with you and my people shall not I'm not ashamed to stand here today I'm not ashamed to tell the world God sent a prophet I'm not ashamed to tell the world I understand what God said I'm not we have the mind of God it's not some thought over there or some idea it's the mind of God and why because we've opened ourselves up for the word not for the world you know there's only one word there's only one letter difference from world and word and that's an l loser listen we're all lost without God we're all losers that's what the man said one time he said I can't understand why brother Branham would call women or refer to him as dog meat I said brother if you're not born again you're a dog meat boy they don't like that I didn't like that at all he changed the subject but that's the truth you're all cannon fodder the Bible tells us that we'll walk out on the ashes of the wicked you're not gonna walk on somebody's been born again you're gonna be the one that walks out I'm not telling you this the Bible's told you that you're gonna walk out on the ashes of the wicked and be under your feet so let's look real quick for about because this is what we're preaching about I thought I'd insert this a little bit I know brother Stevens preaching on adoption too and this is all on adoption because it's going to be uh placing because brother Brown said what when when the the bride realizes what who she is and what she's doing here she'll be an invincible Army listen we're getting whipped all over the place we've got sickness we got our kids are not in them or not saying our friends are not saved our husbands or wives we can't beat around all over the place I don't care give me what the prophet said he said when you can do all stand right there and see the salvation of the Lord while the children of Israel they probably got all kind of nervous but you know what happened it was water that way there was some real mad Egyptians that way yeah they were standing in the middle they said we're done sometimes we have to get in that place till we say we're done and Moses stop your whining ain't nobody said Moses why cry speak and go forward he didn't say speak El backwards he said speak and what did Moses say this day those Egyptians that's been bothering you all your life you'll never see him again they'll be dead to you your life will be what heading toward the promised land head toward what all the great Miracles that God did over that way not back that way oh but we got a group of people that sits around going I wish I was back there no you don't does anybody ever eat a leek it's a real strong onion the strongest onion you ever eat in your life a leek is more than that it don't even sound good to eat a leek it's kind of like guacamole well here we go all right well at least it'll wake you up but leeks and garlic put those two together and eat it they'd rather eat that than to go on with God come on somebody that's ignorance the position of a believer now just a minute give me five more minutes to be real reverent give me a little more nap before the foundation of the world he's talking about Ephesians 4. that we should be holy Without Blame perform in love we read the scripture many many times brother Dale also having predestinated in other words for knowing not just predestination you got to look at foreknowledge first because that's before hand he has what predestinated US unto what the adoption children Christ to himself according to pleasure of his good will now brother that was the scripture now this is Brother Brown I want to read this this is probably this quote puts everything together there's a hundred quotes that you can talk about adoption but this one kind of just places it and we'll read it and then we'll close we'll start back this afternoon I don't want to tell you too much John and him is going to be gone so I want them to hey now let's take the loss of the Old Testament for a shout out watch this real quick and will you bear with me just a moment before closing now under the law the order of the law of the old ultimate which is the title which is the type of this day remember the Bible says that all that was given for an example Moses was given an example for this day Moses had given Isaiah was given all the different prophets were given looking what to us every one of them said we want to live in that day remember when Jesus was here they said the prophet they said they desired to see this day in a family of man when a child was born in the family as soon as the boy was born he was the son of that family all right so how many how many messages did we spend of those 80 showing that faith is the foundation it is the birth it is putting you into the family of God is everybody with me all right the father loved him of course listen we all love our children right I don't care what they're doing we love them you better he said Well mine's got doing this so I ain't got I take a bullet for any one of my kids I don't care if they're just the SARS people ever lived on the face of the Earth they're still my kids they're still mine you know what got to take one for your sorry rear end too amen he did he got hung on Cross for me and you hey man let's not forget Calvary let's don't forget what he did for us do not ever forget that when we get the lowest of low just remember he did all that for us and you know what he knew you'd make it as soon as the boy was born he was the son of that family if you're born again today you are right and you are in the family of God and you are what though but you're put into the family of God to what to get these gifts to get these wonderful things you know Mom and Dad gave us some wonderful gifts at Christmas didn't give y'all one well they did but you understand what I mean family to family right I love bro John and sister Edie but I didn't invite them to my Christmas party because they're not Dales right same way with God listen God's a jealous God he wished everybody would come he compelled them to come but they so what does he do he holds his attention on his bride he holds his attention on his family I'm gonna send you the best of the best I'm gonna give you the best message at the best time it may be dark out there it may be dreary but I'm going to give you the best I'm gonna give you a chance to get out of here he loved us more than just that it's not feel your love it's agape love and agape love look has no boundaries listen all we can do is love our husband and wife and our kids conditionally I say humanly humanly now when we get the love of God that's when we love him unconditionally but man I ain't like my kids when I wasn't born again I like my kids I ain't like well you know what my dad didn't like me either my heavenly father don't look over him he loved me because he knew we were coming so that's a good thing that that the Lord showed him amen the father loved him of course then if you get over in Galatians you talk about you know tutors and governors then the father had so much work to do over the whole Kingdom what do you want to do you know God can run let's just stop for a second God can run this world without us yes God can run the universe without us he can make every Star go in the right direction he can make everything go according to his plan but he decided to use you he decided to defeat the Devil through you yeah that's what he decided and you know what if that's my daddy and he decides that and he's gone he don't make a mistake yeah put me there the father had so much work to do over the whole Kingdom you know why that's why God's got angels those those angels do the work for for God well be quiet he sends angels he sends angels he was an angel Jesus said Angels talk to him and strengthen him and comfort him am I still in the Bible so we've got Angels today there's Angels standing around here and you know what they're doing there's an Angel going with you because I'm going to tell you what this is this tutor is an angel that sent to a Believer to go back to the father and say hey he's doing good or hey he needs a whipping everybody with me look he placed a tutor or a teacher over the Sun and this tutor brought word to the father all the time how the child was progressing a teacher anyone knows that was the Old Testament rule a tutor Paul speaks about the law being a tutor or School Master to bring us to Christ or an educator now as this the tutor began to watch the boy grow now remember he was already a son he was already a Christian let's just put it that way he was already in the family of God he was already what under the blessings of God all right but he had something to do to continue on to be what an adopted son of God because adoption is not like we say adoption we take somebody else's kid and we adopt him in the family now listen God don't adopt Satan's kids he adopted his own kids all right and adoption is really placing in the Bible not bringing somebody into your family listen we're not adopted kids we're born Sons and Daughters of God if you're born again you're not adopted but you have to come to adoption watch this he was a son the tutor began to watch the boy grow but yet the father didn't know what to do with him or what he would be when he growed up now our father does but he you know what he stands back unless you make the choice now to full to my full opinion friends listen real close now let's pray for me if I'm wrong what happened when the Full Gospel Church began way back Yonder years ago they became sons of God when they received the Holy Ghost that's right they come sons and the Holy Spirit is the tutor to raise them in the admonition of God now as the tutor has been watching the children and the church has been progressing coming up they've seen the age of birth you say born again that's right correct you're just as much sun as you'll ever be when you're born again but but the tutor bringing word to the father then if the Father the tutor comes to the father and the boy become about age about where the church ought to be now comes of age brightened up the Microsoft brighten up a little bit seasoned according to the time when the boy become of age the tutor come to the father and see the boy being a son already but yet he wasn't a worthy son he was the son power without character right he wasn't a worthy son listen those people that went to nicaea brother Brown said the bride went there in other words prophets went there they never got adopted they got beat down because it wasn't time it wasn't time for them to grow right you know who beat them down Satan beat him down they lost their first love and they started father-son Holy Ghost and all these different denominational ideas that's not even in the Bible if he wasn't a worthy son the father could not adopt him or place him into his own family he couldn't do it because the boy would run through what he had kind of like The Prodigal Son he was a Restless child in church out of church this time doing the other I can't do this I can't do that he didn't have the ability to carry on with the father's work now this is the sign so the father just let him go on as a son a lot of people when brother Brown stood up 60 years ago and said we're living below our privileges that's exactly what he meant he saw people that were born again but they got cold they got four four but if he was a fine boy he was about his father's business and the tutor brought word to the father saying that the son is fine he's eligible he's all right then the father took the son out into a public place as a public testimony I believe God took William Branham out to the mountain and produce that cloud I said this is my son hear ye him because remember he come back and preached his message to the seals we'll get to that later on and set him up before the people and the father looked by doing so give the son the authority over his kingdom over his business and so forth the son had a right to go out and do certain things in the Kingdom with the same kind of authority that his father had that's why we're living below our privileges because we don't believe that we don't believe that oh yeah well you get born again you're a child you you're able to do things but wow when we start going up this statue of perfect man which we've already in the virtue of knowledge what is that that's the father saying that a boy or I'm just going to let him be what he is that's what he did hold on man go down here a little bit further if he wasn't a worthy son the father cannot adopt him or place him he couldn't do it because the boy the Boy would run through what he had he didn't have the ability to carry on with his father's worth so the father just let him go on as a son that's why we live way below our privileges that's why we're so tossed about it's because we don't believe that we can be more than a son we can be an adopted son that's what I should have preached this you know back in about part 40 something because that's what we're heading to we're heading to adoptions we're heading to a place into where it's not you listen that Temperance right there well we gotta work on the knowledge when we're talking we're going to talk about knowledge you have to have knowledge for this world we have to Natural that don't don't drop out of school because we think that school is is of the devil or that brother Brown says the education is of the devil so people start pulling people out of school when we were 15 16 years old and look at people now right look at people now so get an education it's required in this time for you to get a good education and listen it's required that you get a good education here too it's required and then when you do guess what you get to do as my granny always said you get to gadget I got to read this over here because you got to hear it what what Jesus said right here and then we'll close musicians come on it may be for tonight we'll see I'll look and see oh here we go Matthew 15 verse 16. and Jesus said are you also yet without understanding that phrase means foolish unintelligent without understanding stupid Jesus said are you without understanding have I not told you said do not you understand that whatsoever enters into your mouth goes into the belly and out through the drop but those things which proceed out of the mouth come forth from the heart that's what defiles a man for out of the heart out of that throne room proceeds evil thoughts murders adulterers fornication thefts false witness and blasphemies these are the things which defile a man let's go be stupid so that's what Jesus said right here that comes from the Greek Greek Lexicon strong number 801 that means foolish unintelligent without understanding I'm stupid I tell you what folks if we miss this thing it's because of us it's not because of God he has given us let's stand our feet he has given us a prophet he's given us a five-fold Ministry he's given us now that 1100 sermons that we couldn't even put on this wall when we first was in this church because of the eight to take the seven inch reels now you can carry it almost in your watch if you've got an Apple Watch you pretty much got the whole message in a watch there's no excuse there's no excuse but I want us all to have virtue because what is virtue of virtue is strength and power it's dunamis we live an unfulfilled life because of our Disobedience to the word of God and brother Ryan said every word entitles you to the token in this end time we've got to have it to get out of here it's not some man listen it's not a man-made idea it's the Bible the Bible tells us to be Sons and Daughters of God to be a full age to not eat to not just drink milk but eat what strong meat not just meat strong meat that we can what grow thereby let's don't be malnourished this year let's eat everything God give us and grow in God I adore you get born again go to church read your Bible believe believe in what God's already done for you and what he's going to do for you listen we've got so many different people in this church that could stand and testify for hours of what God's done in their life why don't you try to be one of them well I don't have no testimony well I do you know why I had a journey I've come to a place where all that's quicker now I know why that happened you know why these things happen to you always mean well this thing happened to me I don't say that no more I know why those things happen to me just I'm a child of the king his Royal Blood now flows through my veins not literally but brother Brown said we're the bride is the blood by the spirit in the end time we're the only thing keeping this world together you and I as bad as we oh bro wait I got all these problems you ain't got no problems to live out there for a little while well I can't listen to what problems they have and you'll get on your knees and you'll thank God for the things that he's given you number one I'm thinking for the Holy Ghost because that's eternal life regardless it doesn't matter if I have shoes like like I read that I know brother Terry you wouldn't think he'd come from from that but he did and I was thinking the other day I thought Lord I drove by some oh and we were coming to Atlanta and I looked up under a bridge and there was a homeless shelter they had built out of tarps and had all kind of trash throwed around just a real junky place but you know what some of those people like to do that if you were to give them a hundred thousand dollars they would probably spend it all and still live under that bridge that's what but I'm telling you that's the same thing with me and you stop being that stop being a vagrant you're a son and daughter of God you get the new birth he'll put you in a palace he might not give you one here but you got one there you love the Lord don't be a vagrant don't be a vagabond don't be don't be somebody that ain't got nowhere to go that's miserable could you imagine as cold as it's been the last several weeks and you have to live under a bridge because you don't have any money because somebody won't give you a chance thank God God give us a chance he'd give us a chance regardless of what we've done he gave us a chance we're all on equal basis when it comes to that listen if if [Music] um save for a fact that Sam Walton made it to heaven his Palace ain't going to be no bigger than mine his bank account ain't gonna be no bigger than mine his Street's gonna be gold my Street's gonna be gold because as I was telling somebody the other day do you know this if you took your life at this moment that's about all your life is right now that I've known y'all 20 or 30 years that's all a part of your life you've got a lot that we wasted you've got a lot coming this way but what about the one going on further you die today without God there's no hope but you got hope because God's here to save your soul he's able to build us up in the Statue of perfect man he's here to give us the things that we need let's sing a song just one verse if you have a need [Music] in this world they reach out when God's Own Heart oh let the word of God [Music] give us strength in this world where Are We Wrong the word of God will guide us home changing me changing you we have come with Open Hearts oh left on a word of God imparting to him words of words [Music] [Applause] all that is right here sacrifice oh he the faithful Words of Christ holy words [Music] many a man died to get this to you [Music] one real good man died so that they could

Photoshop this if you read it it draws a picture and that picture is always true this right here so why worry about all the other things word of God ever true listen there's thousands of men give their life to write this yes and publish it and get it to me and you and then we just lay it up on the shelf or we don't do behalf of it let's commit ourselves to do better this year it's not this is not a New Year's resolution no this is like I said before brother John let's have a New Year's revelation a revelation will never fail you and a revelation will not carry you away from the word of God it'll put you more in the word of God I I I it Marvels me at some of the people I used to know a bunch of Catholics and when we worked at the chicken plant and for Lent they would give up something they didn't like well I'd do that Lynch supposed to be giving up something that you like you know something that's that's going to be a uh you know something that's going to really hurt to give it up listen God doesn't ever want us to be to have Lent he wants to give us the word of God and he has given us a word of God and you know what you can make it where it's bitter in your belly you can make it that way but if you'll eat it it might be John said sweet in my mouth sour my belly but you know what it didn't kill John didn't kill him you know what he done it made him prophesy it made him go out and talk to Kings and Priests and all these different things give this message to the world yes whole word of God say it one more time we'll go home [Music] [Applause] we got you're dismissed be back at two o'clock we have come with Open Hearts [Music] it's ever true on preserved for our walk in
