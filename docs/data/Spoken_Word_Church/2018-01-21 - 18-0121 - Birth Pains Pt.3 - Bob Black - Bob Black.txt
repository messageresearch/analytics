========================================

all right so we're going to continue on birth pains and what I'm gonna you know my family's kind of going through getting the fluid and everything this weekend so what I'm going to talk about this week seems a little bit odd with all that going on and everything but you know I really want to talk about why why there are birthdays just last last couple of Sundays we just kind of looked at what my friends are and how they've been going down through the seven regions as each church age misinterpreted because each brought their misses and then either the different ministers only brought their message then it created birth pains we created a struggle and brother Branham explained that in the myth today and the message birth pangs he said the reason there's a fight is because there's there's two coming out there's a Jacob and Esau coming out and well there's a one can't quite do along with the truth and so what the reason for birth pains is because the truth is coming out and so when you have truth being preached then it creates a struggle that creates and it creates this this squeeze medicine eventually it will produce God it back inflicted again the son of man lay back in his people here and so really what what produces Burt birth pains is when the people begin to catch the message of what's being preached and they began to speak him back and that's why I was going through back Romans chapter 8 starting off with crying Abba fathers because that you went even when you come for the baby you come forward speaking the word you come forth saying I am a Christian and I believe God word and you say I believe the correct way of baptism and you start speaking even though you know a little baby doesn't click can't quite formulate the exact way to say things or or doesn't quite know what to do with the work but yet he's crying I have a father because he recognizing how he's born out and grow you he knows where his sustenance is coming from he's looking at the father in the face so to speak because he's cut as he comes forth he's looking at him and he's recognizing who he is and and he keeps any speaking the word because you grow old based upon your confession and I got a lot of slides here to go through but that's pretty much what I'm going to be talking about this morning as that birth pains are based upon the Church's position the churches the bride's confession and when the bride begins to speak it produces something and the brightest is is the word isn't being squeezed out so it's all based upon your confession no there's lots of examples in the scripture think about when when the very first one able and it will have a little talk with Cain and explain some things and it's not written in the Bible exactly what he explained but I think we can make a pretty good guess at the conversation that they had and whatever that wasn't discussed it produced a birth pain that produced a pain so great that Cain took a rock and walked him over the head with it and and that print reproduces all the way down I was looking at kind of studying that about how programs was talked about the one of the three woes that that war will one there were two or three that the earth is going through and and you begin to look at what happened in war or two about how that the Kristallnacht the night the night of broken glass when they began to pull Jews out of their homes that first night in there and and why were they doing that because it was you confession because of what they're going to eat because of who think because it was time for them to return back to the homeland and so all of these things are producing they're producing the pains are producing a a new world coming in to be getting everything straightened out and and so you with the expression birth pains comes from in Matthew 24:7 through nine with this Scripture that we're all familiar with but the wades gone through it a lot when Jesus preached the seven seals and and this verse 7 for nation shall rise against nation and Kingdom against Kingdom there shall be famines and pestilences and earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows and if you pull up a like on a Bible hook command where you can see a translation of this with all just about all the other different Bibles there's like 50 different Bible you can see translated side by side and this scripture is translated in many different Bible versions as the beginning of birth pains and that's where that that that comes from the beginning of birth pains beginning of Sorrows because all these things are producing what I've just kind of illustrated and then shall they deliver you under to be a leader and we know how the background the context of all these things but really why did they deliver them up to be afflicted because they had a confession because they believed something because they were saying I believe like in the in the days of Nero and the date going all the way back I don't believe that Nero is that is the true God I believe that Jesus Christ is the one true God and then they really began to kill the people for that think about all the times when they would say well if you'll just give us over your material your the message books of the day the books that had the power are the different writers of the New Testament had written just give us those books and then we won't kill you but yet they so many who were unwilling to even do that they stood upon the action and and they lost their lives because of that and you can just come a little illustration I put together just kind of showing some of the squeeze that's been taking place and you've got brother brown over seven the different seven visions the seven things that he saw that we're gonna have to take place about how Mussolini and who was representing factories I mean Hitler representing non-seasonal drives Nazism and then those two would would combine to form communism he said they wound up in one abysm and that one isn't will dominate the world and will burn the vatican city watch rush of technological advancements the car that could drive itself or the the bubble and then moving them down into a more okay a powerful woman who rise up and one day America will be in ruin and all these things are squeezing out to produce this a bride coming back to to a millennial and to a millennial reign it's all this is producing on and you can even see them the rise of the that going on with it's difficult to illustrate this but all the way back to the one when Paul was preaching and he said the mystery room a committee already works the Antichrist spirit working moving on to false prophet and then it comes in Carla and the Beast Satan incarnate sitting on his throne and and it mirrors what God is doing in his church taking us through the four stages to put himself back in human flesh birth pain that's what birth pains are and he said and you can see I didn't even realize that so Billy Graham and all Roberts were born in the same year I if you ever want to know what how close we are looking look at things like this we've got to be at the end times of times when something is because oh yeah and then oh the whole earth has gone through birth pains and look at these now and all three of these these birth pains for the cleansing of the earth that brother Branham talked about in the future home can and other messages are they they started with a man it wasn't us and that's really the point of that the birth pains come because of a message and because the people catch the message and they begin to believe it and they begin to speak you know what caught the message and he began to speak it and his family got there in the are committed and only these three things you know the distinctive you their justification of air of the sanctification and then in purification about five maybe one day will be there will be God's power or not may inspire ain't but all of these are our birth pains because they but the birth pains are taking us from the things of the earth the believer that the birth pains are doing many different things the one thing is they're cleansing the earth they're preparing the arm for the bride to come and walk not only cleansed earth where there ain't no singing but another is it's changing us from this earth from this earthly realm as you eat the word you come from the realms of this earth that's why programs the Bible says if you love the things of the world the love of God is not even in you because the word is taking you from the world and taking you from two to a is it seated in heavenly places in it with Christ Jesus in another Kingdom in another dimension that only your soul right now is in contact with one day with through full Redemption your your entire being will be in contact with that that other world that you're being birthed into and see why it's hard to preach it sounds like we're going to another world but we're gonna be here because God has changing this then he's changing this place so that we can come back and do it a little bit yeah and so what birth planes is is delivering the manchild which programs sat down here so I'm gonna get to that so let's read some folks delivering the manchild that seems like a strange thing to say that it because you start off with a little baby being born again and it grow and then there's got to be that manchild come forth and to deliver that manchild of a message had to come forth a message had to come to get the people speaking the same thing because that's what birth pains is is when that people begin to realize that place and who they are well what makes the shuffle away is when the people begin to clean the bride begins to speak again when she begins to say I and my father are one then the shuck pulls away anything all down through scripture you can follow that pattern when the people begin to realize who they are then when you begin to realize who you were that the denomination that you were in kicked you out and you can follow that all the way they said it did that all through the ages I'm sorry finally the church delivers to them a man-child that man child was the work itself made flesh and in the beginning was the word the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us he conquered every devil every power upon the earth that come against him when the fathers were only every temptation that Satan gave him he repeated he rebuked Satan not with his own powers that he had but with the Word of God it is written it is written it is written the firm was the word and didn't brother Brown teach us but that's the same way that we attack the weak we direct the devil and in the message of harvest-time he talked to us about how that you defeat the devil the exact same way that Jesus did because that corn of wheat has grown all the way down to the church of the seven churches until it's right back to the way it was at the beginning where God and manifest and his people and he's equipped us with His Word come on in brother Lewis better late than one Satan flew against Eve she wasn't the word sort of failed when he flew against Moses it did the same thing but we need to enter the Son of God he was ten thousand volts and not the loose feathers out of him when he come back and said it's written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God there was that man child made flesh God's eternal word himself manifested in a body of flesh here on earth to represent the word and then he says in birth pangs which is really where I'm getting a lot of this you know you know that you did a lot of this but you also have to put everything together because you can't look at messages and it's kind of discrete entities everything fits together like a puzzle so it all fits together the word must deliver the word broadchurch I think we'll think about that statement the word must deliver the word broadchurch you come from the word you're born from the word and you become the word and so the word is delivering a word bride church we got make those hand moves and the church has got to be delivered out for a bride for Christ then that fell asleep in all ages will make up that bride that come out on the word that they come out on a lot from your feet coming to your head and she gets greater and more you have to have and so forth as the body grows up so does the body of Christ grow up and then finally the head will come to it they hit a bit will now if we notice because it's all linked to the end and this is this is a this is a quote good quote I'll share on brother wheat Louie's last Sunday the head does the turning and pulling the head does the turning pulling now there's a lot that could be said about that you're you being thrown up you're being birthed by the head it's been pulling you guys I don't know how's it pulling you didn't didn't Jesus say no man can come to me except the father draw him and he's drawing you by the word what does that mean he draws you by the word he draws you by and I put together a lot of quotes about this that I don't have but the bottom line is if I could just share with you my revelation and you could God gave us a brain in two hands of two feet to go look in the word and see if it's true or not but he's drawn us by the revelation of his word because when you get a revelation of what the word says and you draw closer to him its draw and you can pulling you and that's what's drawing you into an in the image of him is is this in it and what is the head then is this message that brother Branham brought to us that is more than just clothes and dress and things like that but it's a message of full redemption to know who you are and know that God is able to redeem your body I can't start crying down color this day the scriptural fuel program said saying that the world is in birth pains now the old has to be done away with so the new can be born just like a seed has to rot away in order to give a new life and how the pain is birth pains from the world in a world once you had a terrific pain because they had poison gas and so forth that almost could destroy the world and in world war two those that she struck another harder pain they had blockbusters and also an atomic bomb she cannot stand another labor pain with these missiles and things today one more world war throw her out into space for she will now be delivered and there will be a new earth if you think we're not close III get news it pops up on my phone and one of the articles that popped up last week was that Donald Trump is planning or however you want to say at the government whatever is planning a is secretly moving things into position for a nuclear war with North Korea and and and so you say well that could never happen or whatever uh you know things are moving into position you're a brother and said now one bomb will drop until we are going but now how close do you have to be it could be it could be pretty close things are exactly things are moving too quickly and and so I believe that the Brian should be more consecrated now than ever something's happening of course now the bride is gonna know what she's not gonna be duped and deceived and she's gonna have an understanding of what's taking place I know her position I know what needs to be done with the work and that's what I'm really speaking of this morning is that a word has to be spoken there's got to be a people that know what the word says and out of her lips come the word that she can her confession is what what calls it that's why I mentioned last Sunday I believe the bride right now is preaching herself into a body changed because she is speaking a word just like that baby a when you come forth crying Abba Father you grow up and to manifest its sons just like Adam was in the beginning Adam was a manifest that son his body had not been changed his body needed to be changed but he was in the Garden of Eden telling the trees where to go and stop him snowstorm her whatever her what needed to be done by the spoken word but then there's something even beyond that - Adam was to wit the redemption of the body to understand what it takes for your body to be changed and when the pride begins to realize what that is then she can begin to speak it and it will happen yeah yeah and so look what I'm really getting to one of the things that has to be spoken is that the dead have to rise from the ground first before you can take the body change and so that's got to be spoken somebody's gonna speak it I'm getting ahead of myself a lot sorry but I'm sorry about my voice you know just hang in there with because this is good so this is what I meant about putting all that all the things together that brother Adam spoke about because if the birth pains come happen because the people are catching something because they're catching a revelation now what are they kitchen in this day we're catching the revelation of what the shout was and we know what we know brother ground solidly it hadn't grabbed her message he he explained he preached a sermon that was so different than anybody else had ever preached to rapture message anything about the rapture that and that there would be a shout of orders a trump command and a you know when I began to read that message the first times I look at it and be like I don't really know what he's talking about what I know but as you begin to study the message it begins to unfold exactly what is taking place and first of all there has to be for you to catch a message there has to be a message first and then and this is what produces the birth pains is this message that God gave us between not the only thing now not necessarily the years of preparation but when he began to sound his message in 1963 from 1963 to negative 65 that represents the capstone here you see that's that's what I'm referring to with the shell he came down with a shout and then then the people begin to catch that he said and there's a man here that in turn on the light the Luther's mana was the message of justification Wesley's message was the manifestation of sanctification Pentecostal was the restoration of the gifts but this is introducing the headstone the last day the bride treat which is contrary to all of it and yet it's the same life for the material and there's just the scripture for you to tell the kids that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep and there's no reason we're not going to hinder them that are in the ground is because we've heard the shout and the shout is the word for this age that prepares us give way to all of the complete swage of the Spirit of God so that you can have preventive preeminence and so that there's no leaven there's nothing but the pure unadulterated Word of God to be spoken there's nothing and that well will provide a way for them which are asleep to come forward and so we will not prevent them went to our sleep they will be able to be able to freely come back to this dimension for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel with the Trump of God and the dead in Christ shall rise first when the showers what brother branham it compares right over with four five six but I will send you your line into the profit before we come into the great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse and obviously I think I was a little bit inspired by that sermon that for the way preached up there brother Tim hymns and I forget if you preached it somewhere else as well but about how that the the message this message is literally turning us this message is literally turning the hearts of the children to deliver us and to make the word be forward is that's what that's what's delivery turning us literally turning it that's what the shout is to do is to turn literally turn us so that the work can be born in this day the shout what is the shout is the message going forth first the Living bread of life bringing forth the bride now you said what the shout is if the shout is a birth pain because the shout goes forth and it stirs up denominations and everybody's wondering what what's going on and and causes a great big terminal everything but like I was I was I was quoting the last time I was reading that that scripture and Ruth that says that Ruth was better than seven sons and I compared that with looking at the seven church ages the the birth pain really happens when the bride catches what is being asked what is being said that's when the when the people began to catch ahold of what's being said that's when the real can happen that's why Ruth the bride is better than seven sons because that's the ultimate goal of all of these seventeen messengers is to produce the Word made flesh again if you just have the seven sons and put them over to the side then that would be that would be all well and good but you would be able you would be without your products right right that's right does that make sense yes yeah you know that that's a little bit controversial today because when you say smiie you make statements like that people think that you're trying to diminish brother brandon will say we don't need a prophet anymore no we need a prophet more than ever we need to we need bill or the word we need we need them if we didn't have this message that you brought but where would we be in ain't we be backing out you know in the denominational system you want to write right on Almont with the rest of them but what the message was for was to catch a bride and get her to realize her place and and see where she came from where she's going who she is and all those other things which is why you said I can make a statement the bride all together that's the main thing the producing of the brightening according to Malachi 4 he will turn the hearts of the shooter to the fathers he will reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which other relations contained to the seven seals it will be these divinely revealed truths that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal followers it will literally turn us back to the original faith that's right this shout that's what I was speaking on earlier about when God speaks you'll come no man can come except my father drawls it God draws you then you'll come and I think so many times we try to reason one another into things but it's not by reason is by a revelation of the word not we can't beat one another into seeing it we put enough one another in a headlock we can't happen but we all we can do is talk to one another and share it well but it takes God to reveal himself to somebody and you know a lot of times you want just kind of open your kids heads up and pour for early and then hey horses anybody or one another but unfortunately it doesn't work like that and it takes God to speak and now you just have faith to believe now these things and then he goes only he's talking he's giving some kind of some examples and the anointing ones at the end time message and he said I've got lots of quotes here so I'm going to help me to just kind of piece some of these together come on with my saw to a tube anointed prophets how was the difference in them one had this speaking of the word and the other one didn't and that goes back to my earlier thought that the birth pains are bringing forth two children Jacob Panisse halt track one has the spoken word one didn't now if you go back and look up Hananiah when they came against the jeremiah he was he had a very interesting background the Bible says that he was a prophet and he was the son of a prophet and so you don't look so much at people's credentials and things like that you want to look at what that comes out of their mouth and what the word is and I think so many times we look at somebody's reputation or somebody's credentials and things like that out of the reputation and the message big people in the message or whatever and and ignore so much was coming out of their mouth we listened to them because of what somebody said they believed or whatever or didn't believe but it's what comes out of your mouth that makes the difference it's not what goes into the belly head and defiles a man but what comes out of his mouth yeah two anointed prophets Jeremiah and Hannah and iy was the difference and then one had to speaking to work and the other one different Jeremiah say they mean and that's what produces the birth pains is when somebody gets to speaking somebody gets to say in the same thing and so then we get into the voice now see you the shout was from 1963 to 1965 a message was delivered and then the brother branham goes off the scene and and and seems like it left a lot of people in terminal they didn't know what to believe didn't know what to expect and so there's a period from then on to right about now where it's time for the bride to begin eating and to begin to realize who she is and so that's what I'm calling this period of the voice because the voice has to be in somebody not believe is in you because there's a quote I buried a little bit that the voice has there's got to be somebody on earth for God to speak through and if brother Branham is not on earth anymore and Jesus is not on earth anymore and and you are on earth then you are a prime candidate if you will open the doors of your heart and let God come in for God to come and speak through you and that's what I was at is there even from your birth you come from from the womb of the word you come forth speaking the word as you grow you speak the word it's your confession there speaking the word but one day you are you understand and I believe the bride is beginning to understand what to do with the word and how to speak it and you actually comes into authority maturity where God lets loose the reins a little bit more because he knows that the bride knows what to do with it and she could speak it she could speak it because she's been studying at all these years she's been feeding on me she's been eating it eating eating he just like in Revelation chapter 10 verse 7 it says it in the days of the seventh angel the mistress will be finished but if you keep reading John took the book and he represents the bride he took the book and then it says the angel said these things must be prophesied again her Reeth him those things have to be spoken again somebody's got to speak what they read in the book didn't work for a second and and so that's that same the same voice brother I was talking about that what the voice is and he said the same voice that summoned John to come up in revelation 4 chapter 1 is the same voice that some of his dead Lazarus out of the grave that same voice of the Archangel Christ is the voice of the Archangel and all that trophy the voice of Christ summons John to come up the same voice summons Lazarus and keep reading in the answer to here am i and he come from the dead after he was dead and his body rotten and you talk about birth pains birth pains to come up from the grave with grave clothes all over you and and and not really realizing where you are and things like that to come up from the grave that's birth pains and that's the birth pains that I'm talking about that we we have come from death to life and there's no there will be a day when the dead rise from the graves and they come forth so that we can go in a rapture because you're not you're not gonna take a body change until first the dead come for most that's the order of events first came the shout then came the voice comes the voice to raise the dead from the grave and then the Trump to call us into the air where is his voice this is one that brother Adam spoke spoke about many times the scripture John 14 and whatsoever you shall I ask in my name that while I do that the father may be glorified in the son if you sho ask anything in my name I will do it and the oneness of unity he said if he shall say what is it when you are out from Babylon you're out from under unbelief you're out from under superstitions you're out from under all these things and you're filled with God's own life your voice is his voice you are I spoken in my room while ago God to do this and here it is he's confirmed it right now I'd against us say how that he's speaking something the Lord showed him and he said the wind swept through this platform here just now as the Holy Spirit crossed over here because it was the spoken word of God that did it and see I think that's wonderful the prophets spoke the word you hear the word and then you speak the word and and you follow your confession through your life brother Graham said it when you begin when you're when you're sick you speak it anyway that I'm healed when you when you were in lost in sin you began to tell everybody I'm a Christian I am a Christian and the people around you might say well I don't see it yet but you kept saying it I'm a Christian and after a while it began to work righteousness because you were speaking it you got to speak it and then looking at the message the masterpiece were round talked about how and when when when the great sculptor but finished that masterpiece he struck it across the leg and the harder speaking and they made a flower and they put a flower on the image now what was the flaw remember the flowers that was put out the denominational system all the world system couldn't take they put it out they struck him to put it out it was it was put out of that system and and it then it began to speak the speaking produces a birth pain it was perfect and that's why he cried how speak because he had seen before him and then he was been able to achieve to bring to pass the vision that was in his mind and therefore under inspiration he done something out of the reason out of the ordinary he struck it and hollered speaking and so going back to Romans 8 if you follow this line amen whereby we cry Abba Father now we've been taught that God is not a God of sympathy the only way you can't cry oh god please I'm feeling bad and that kind of thing the only way to get to God is to cut to approach him with his word that's the only thing that moves God has faith in his word he's not a God of compassion if he was a God of sympathy like that then then everybody there at the Pool of Bethesda would have been healed as he just walked from one person to the other but he went the one that would respond to the word and would believe and rise to his feet and so this crying is not just crying out for on some some some vain idea or something but it's crying out the word is speaking the Word of God and a baby phone but then you keep growing on up for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God as it speaks about all this growing birth pains are happening and not only they but ourselves also which have the firstfruits of the Spirit even we ourselves groan within ourselves waiting for the adoption to wit the redemption of our body and where is this voice this voice is is in you all the way from your birth to to the material to being a mature Christian because when you're sick listen you don't have to wait till you're adopted to stick a fish you're healing when you're sick you speak the word and watch it come to pass and remember it's not based upon your it's not based crying out for just some vanity or something but when you when you cry out to God put the word before like when I when I was began to seek the Holy Ghost it seemed like everybody in the message would tell you reasons why you couldn't get a rope it couldn't be saved and so I began to look through the scriptures to find reasons why Skippy the reason why this message was for me and when I found that I laid it in front of gods who you promised it now let it come to pass that's what that's what this whole journey is as you say you promised it now let it come to pass he promised to rapture he's promised a body change hey Scott Robin Williams priests to the rapture he said has been spoken now let it come to pass and he spoken but now you've got to speak it you got to speak it and the only way you can speak of this if you've been eating the word and you understand what needs to be spoken and then out of your belly will flow living waters as it comes forth from your lips and you speak exactly what was written the true interpretation of the word not just something that was inscribed from an intellectual standpoint on paper but the real spiritual understanding of what God wanted you to see at the spin I know my voice is activate the voice of the Sangha realm so what does that do then there has to be human flesh on earth to speak his voice there has to be human flesh on earth that's one of these big giant quotes I think that God just gave us to just wield as a like a big old mallet up against the devil's he did there had to be human flesh over and if brother branham's not on earth this is whatever I say that they try to say whether the shout out is brother Brandon divorce is gonna be some minister or somebody some great man the shout they try to make some some reason why it can't be you buddy but jesus said does not the scripture say that ye are God's Word came to you can speak the word any brother this is one program city even said now when I'm praying I like this enough now think about this God don't see me he just hears my voice and through the blood of Jesus right see he don't see P he hears my voice now this is a real true son God speak in the word and he's all he does is hear that voice speaking the word and I'll be honest I believe that's what real prayer is is not just saying the Lord helped me with my schoolwork or whatever although those things are good but real prayer is laying the word of God before him and saying you said and then what God move pull the scene and bring in the past that's right and I'll stop right there crazy [Music]
