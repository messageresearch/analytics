your prayers as we travel and uh may the lord bless us in what we're doing so if we have your bibles like i said turn to genesis 1 26 then we'll go to genesis 2. let's bow our heads before we get started heavenly father we pray tonight that you would be the active participant in this service but you would not be a bystander lord recording our thoughts and our ideas of our old natural adamic ways but lord that you would just break through all that lord just take the spiritual eye and the spiritual ear and the spiritual mouth and may we all connect tonight may they be a oneness father like you said in the garden that you and adam and eve was true oneness where man could walk in front of you father and and be able to converse with you and lord we know that was lost in the fall and we know that there was a chasm there that man could not get back to but now we see that that chasm has been drawn together by jesus christ and he is the way for us to get back to that tree and lord we pray that you would just bless us now give us a good service tonight father just keep us strong and healthy be with the ones that are on the foreign fields lord the missionaries you bless them and give them fruit for their labor father bless this day lord take care of us bless the sick that are among us and the ones that are not here lord for many reasons the ones that are watching in father we ask that you would just come down and bless each one father just be with us now take care of us we give it all to you father in jesus name amen genesis 1 26 and 27 the bible says and god said now i was i as you preach this it just keeps unfolding because and god said so nobody this is not secondhand information this is not coming from a son that heard it from a father right that's right god said amen let us make man in our image after our likeness so you know what god must be a man amen exactly if we're a man and we were made in his image then he must be a man amen and actually he's the only man there ever was the only complete man there ever was and then you and i were made in his image after our likeness and let them so there's plurality there that has come into being let them have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over the cattle and over all the earth not just certain elements not just certain continents not just certain things all the earth so whatever this group of people is because it is plural it says them right right they have control of the earth all right and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth so god created man in his own image now not as far as we see as created as far as there was nothing and then there's something amen right because cars were in genesis that's right television was in the garden of eden where do you think everything came from right right this earth that's why they call it mother earth everything comes from the earth the bible says there's nothing new under the sun it's just that man had not been able to take the elements and put them together to build the car because the car physically comes from the dirt where do you think it comes from it comes from the dirt so the dirt was in the garden of eden so there's nothing new so god created in other words in other words he fashioned something before the foundation of the world and god created in his own image created man in the image of god created he him male and female created he them so god had a purpose that there was going to be a man and a woman all right but now look verse 28 whatever group of people this is was blessed before they got here that's right right if we believe god who's who he is and can't change his mind god can't have a better thought two thousand years from now right god's thoughts are eternal everything he thinks and everything he says happens not like human beings but god blessed them so whoever that group of people is is already blessed amen right all right and god blessed them and god said unto them in other words he spoke straight to this group of people right okay them all right now we know it wasn't a group of people before the foundation of the world we're not we're not mormons that believe that we were all up there somewhere because this is probably the scripture that they get it from but we were not we were there in the form of god that was eternal but it was not you go to galatians 3 16 the bible says not as unto seeds as of many which these are seeds of many but one seed which is christ all right so god blessed them and god said unto them be fruitful and multiply right now we went through all that a couple weeks ago told you all the definitions of multiply and replenish the earth and subdue it so in other words whatever this group of people is the earth is theirs right right amen complete control of the earth all right and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth you may be seated in the lord that is blessing to the reading of the word but tonight we're going to speak on part 3 genesis 1 26 part 3 the tree of life all right because there was in genesis 2 if you'll read genesis 2 verse 9. now i want you to watch something here what's your punctuation you say oh that doesn't mean anything yeah it does or they wouldn't be there right all right and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is pleasant to the sight and good for food pause pause the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil now god didn't cause them to come out of the ground right pause he created the trees then paul's the writer of this is moses we know that for a surety right all right so moses is seeing a vision he's seeing a vision of two things in the garden that is not necessarily trees because when they start eating off of these trees there's some funny things happening if it's just regular fruit like apples and oranges and pears and pomegranates and apricots i like apricots but that had nothing to do with what was going on here in verse 16. now look at 16-17 and the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat that's right pay attention but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil funny tree you see one today no okay they call it a metaphor they call it a uh something and jesus said thank you god for hiding this from the wise and prudent it takes the holy ghost to bring all these things to our vision to show us the same thing moses saw right right if moses wrote it by the holy ghost and we have the holy ghost amen it's not two holy ghosts right we're gonna prove something tonight all right that we've been looking at this tree of life as something out yonder somewhere or something we must go to to get and i'm going to let the prophet bring it right down to you which we believe that in the end time that god did send the prophet no no you say that's bad that's not good well he sent paul he sent peter he sent john he sent james he sent uh john smith to the baptist yeah right so you say well we don't we fought we don't follow no man yeah you follow somebody somebody you follow i don't care who it is if you're catholic you follow the pope right if you're methodist you follow the method way of of worshiping which was john wesley he created the method that's why it's called methodist he created a method of worship all right now luther and lutheranism now martin luther probably would would throw up at the lutheranism today but true lutheranism was that just shall live by faith it wasn't penance it wasn't something that you do or don't do it's the just shall live by the faith of god all right so that was a revelation for him but we come here in the end time and we see that that all that got scrupled up and something had to come and bring it bring all the loose ends in other words back together again that we can see that you take this bible and and you know we say catholicism is the great and and the the baptist and the methodists or the are the daughters to the and but they get their they get their sermons and they get their quotes and they get their denominational ideas straight from the bible that's right that's right i don't get it from anywhere else they get it straight from the bible all right so misinterpreted theology has caused a lot of people to see things a little bit different but tonight we want to look at this and we want to see and break some of these words down because look the lord god commanded the man saying of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat but of the tree of knowledge of good and evil thou shalt not eat for in the day that thou eat thereof thou shalt die now god never told him not to eat from the tree of life right that's right exactly that's right he never said don't eat from two trees he said just don't eat from that one tree in other words what does the word eat mean partake right so don't partake of that tree all right and you'll be all right but we know what happened now in genesis 3 let's read a few scriptures and then we'll get started genesis 3 and the lord god said behold the man is one of us become one of us now this is after what happened in the garden this is after the fall god is saying behold the man has become as one of us to know good and evil now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life now remember he ate of the tree of knowledge of good and evil right right but he didn't eat the tree of life but god said now if we don't stop he's going to try to go eat that tree of life right all right but he's already perverted that's the problem he had already messed it up or he could have went to the tree of life because god never tells them do not eat from the tree of life he tells them don't eat from the tree of knowledge of good and evil all right and the lord god said behold the man has become one of us to know good and evil and now lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life and eat or partake right all right and live forever right now remember this tree of knowledge of good and evil the day you eat there of the day you die now the tree of life let's just assume that that's the tree of life life eternal life because there was good and evil in the garden all right so let's just let's don't say let's assume let's just know that that there was something that adam and eve was going to come to eventually from that tree of life if they would have left that tree of knowledge of good and evil alone now you say well were those trees absolutely not no they weren't a maple or an elm or an oak or a pecan or tree is going to do you any good because god said in a later verse he said i see man as trees you remember the man that had his eyes open you know he said i see men as trees and then then there's a a tree and i'll i'll i didn't know this until i read it but uh the tree of life is mentioned three times in genesis and three times in revelation so there's three times in genesis and three times in revelation so there must be something to this tree of life if we know that genesis is the beginning everything comes out of genesis and then revelations is the ending of all things all right so there's something that god wants us to look at so genesis 3 23 says therefore the lord god sent him forth from the garden of eden to till the ground from which he was taken so he drove out the man and he placed in the east of the garden of eden cherubims and a flaming sword which turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life so there must be a way to the tree of life this is just simple english if there if he's now if there's something happened to man and he can't get to the tree of life yet there's a way to it and the cherubims are stopping the way there was a way there for him to come to the tree of life all right so he drove out the man and he placed at the east of garden eden of eden cherubims and the flaming sword was turned every way to keep the way of the tree of life now let's read in revelations 2 let's get the scriptures here that we want to out of the way this is one of them and we're going to speak of the other two later on but i want you to keep something in your mind tonight you remember when we went through genesis 1 26 and we took all the to me and to to you i know you believe it that that this is the characteristics of god this is the the dna of god because it's how god looks because that's the first thing he said we're made in his image we're made in his likeness he's given us dominion over the fish of the sea and the fowl of the air he's given us control over everything adam had complete control over the earth in other words in layman turns god said look i'll take care of heaven adam you take care of earth amen that's right just as simple as that i'll be the big g and you be the little jesus amen because it says ye are gods in the bible not a big g but now this big jesus been talking he's a big g right he's a big god but he wants us to be little gods okay he the health and here let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches now this is in the ephesian church age the first church age all right so the first church age to him that overcometh will i give to eat of the tree of life which is in the midst of the paradise of god all right so it's moved from being exactly where it is in eden it's moved to somewhere where somebody can partake of it right because ephesians it says if you overcome i'll give you to eat of the tree of life so there must have been a way made to get back to it somewhere in there from genesis to revelations there was a way made somewhere for us to get back to the tree of life all right so now i want us to read uh in the ephesian church age out of the churches book or the rep this is the this is the individual books all right and let's see what brother ryan said summary of ephesus fruits without love led to apostasy the promises paradise promised to the overcomer of the saints of ephesus and the church aids given to the tree of life here's a beautiful thing the tree of life is mentioned three times in genesis three times in revelations the first time it was mentioned in genesis was in eden and christ was the tree so there's your key it wasn't a tree in the ground it was a man we've been through this glory the first time it was mentioned in genesis was in eden and christ was the tree the three times it was mentioned in revelations was christ in paradise oh that's rich the lord bless so from genesis to revelations there's three times mentioned the tree of life three times mentioned in the end of the bible but remember the first three times in in the beginning of the bible there's a way been stopped to get to that tree in the book of revelations whoever is overcoming is going straight to the tree of life all right and then the ephesian church age remember started right after pentecost so there's another key i want us to look at these characteristics of this tree of life this is what i was was thinking about when when dad was preaching it the other day and and we put that tree of life we said well it's jesus and it's and and we know it's him and and you know he's the way and he's the truth and the life and he's the one to get back to but remember there's one thing that's got to happen is he's got to be somewhere listen he's got to be somewhere doing the work not waiting to calvary to get here we know he was a lamb slain before the foundation in the world but i'm going to read you something that you've probably how many of you re read christ the mystery guard reveal 25 or 30 times at least read something the other day that i'd never seen before never happened to you right didn't think i thought it was but it did it just it just stuck out in my head and i'm like wow couldn't have said it no other way now let's read the next quote and just kind of break this down a little bit and take it from the bible because remember like i said before the bible was written jesus said thank you father that you have hid this from the wise and prudent and revealed it to babes such as would learn the tree of knowledge of good and evil you'll not learn anything but man's knowledge it will take you nowhere but death literally you and i come off the tree of knowledge of good and evil because adam and eve took of that and that's where we came from they did not partake of the tree of life at first right that's right okay so there's another key all right because we're going to look at this characteristics of the tree of life i've been looking at that now instead of just just looking at words and looking at phrases and looking at genesis 1 26 look at the characteristic of what that is all right i want to look at the characteristic tonight of the tree of life we say well the tree of life was jesus well let's hang on just a minute jesus the flesh wasn't in the garden yet brother branham here says i'll read it to you in just a minute he says the tree of life was jesus but now remember it wasn't jesus in flesh standing back there in the garden of eden but remember hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever that which was which is and which is to come all right the almighty so now let's get into this a little bit i want to break a couple of words down just for reference let's read god's provided way of worship 1953 now in the garden of eden there were two trees one of them was a tree of knowledge one was the tree of life and man can never know god by knowledge so no matter how well you get educated how smart your pastor is exactly how many degrees he's taken which we know he didn't he didn't get a high school degree talk about brother branham and we're talking about our pastor here he got ged later on but what i'm saying is there the ministry of this church is not built on phds and and and how much we can how much we can quote the bible and how much we can quote it backwards to make it say something different but it is a love letter from god glory and the love letter from god we can read that love letter between the lines but it's got to compare with all the line and that's what we're going to try to show this afternoon or this evening so now the garden of eden one was a tree of life and man can never know god by knowledge so no matter how well you get educated how smart your pastor is how many decrees degrees he's taken you can't god is not known by education now you say well how can you prove that peter couldn't write his name right right peter could not write his name when he signed his fishing report on friday he put an x but yet god used him for the spokesman on the day of pentecost to preach the very first sermon from a holy ghost filled man so it's not knowledge peter walks up to the guy at the gate beautiful and he said silver and gold have i none in other words my fishing ain't doing very well right now i ain't even got no money but such as i have i give unto you it wasn't something he could reach in his pocket and get it was something that peter came with on the day of pentecost that came to him and he accepted it and that's the way you and i the same way we received the new birth the same way they received the new birth on the day of pentecost all right god is not known by education neither he's known by scientific research the only way god is known is by faith no matter if you don't know the difference between split beans and coffee now most of us do but if you absolutely by faith except god it's bound to be an act of faith and when man was eating on this tree of life he had eternal life all right because he was heading toward something now remember adam's body was not eternal right okay adam's soul was eternal all right he was given the newborn he was it's not a new birth he was given the holy ghost according to blasphemous names and i truly believe it myself that for adam to have control over all these things he had to be an amateur god so he had to have godlike qualities to be able to handle the situations he handled could you imagine running the whole earth we got presidents that can't and i'm not talking about just obama we got presidents that can't run countries we've got mayors that can't run cities there was a man on earth called adam he run the whole world right so he had to have a godlike quality to be able to do that all right he had to be a mini creator because he had part of the creator in him all right but he couldn't get to the tree of life to get eternal life the way god wanted him to have eternal life all right which was in his flesh but when he left that tree of life and went on the tree of knowledge the first bite he took now remember the word eat means to partake so the first time he partook of this tree of knowledge of good and evil he separated his fellowship with god right and every time that he bites off that tree of knowledge he destroys himself and we go on to see that he made illustrations about cars they want to do away with all these guns and they want to do all with all this stuff cars kill more people than every war that's ever been fought cars kill more people right but now we're not going to turn our cars in and go back to riding horses you will get killed some idiot will hit you with his car all right so let's not say that you know everything's we look at life and we see that electricity is wonderful amen i love thermostats that work but you know that comes right off of the tree of knowledge in glory you're not going to find there's not going to be sorry aaron's not here but we're not going to need an ac man in in glory why because we're going back to the tree of life to where we don't need that anymore adam didn't need it all adam had to do was say peace be still i need some coolness here i need some warmth here adam could control he was his own thermostat so he could control and that's what we're going back to we're going back to you and i being the rulers and the reigners of this earth so so revelations 5 tells us all right that we're going to rule and reign here on the earth and god made the earth in isaiah 44 he says i've made the earth to be inhabited and if we agree that god when he says something he can't take it back if he said he's going to be inhabited it's going to be inhabited but it can't be inhabited by the tree of knowledge because the tree of knowledge is death we're all getting older we're all dying why because we ate off the wrong tree right you say well what about this trees and this fruit and all this stuff all right let's go and just break it down just a moment let's go to the next one i kind of inserted this it's kind of like daddy this is a quote 2a but i wanted to do this because i want us to see we get hung up on words of of don't protect from the fruit of the god of the of the uh tree of knowledge of good and evil you can't partake of the fruit he says we can eat of all the fruit except that one well now watch this in psalms 127 verse 3 the bible says lo children are the heritage of the lord and the fruit of the womb is his reward you're the fruit of your mother you're the fruit of the womb you're what comes forth from the act between the mother and the father you're the fruit or the product all right so what he's telling us he's told evie and adam he says don't eat of that fruit that's not that's not the way i want it to come remember the spoken words original seed not through man's loins all right not through the loins of man and ver in luke 142 talking about mary and elizabeth she spoke out with a loud voice and said blessed art thou among women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb so let's go back to the garden in just a second but look right here what this says that word fruit means offspring children progeny produce right man or produce whichever one you want to say because that's what fruit is fruit is produce it's what's produced from the ground that's why it's called produce so whatever this happened in the garden of eden there was a product made from this don't eat of that fruit all right so literally we know it wasn't an apple that he made wasn't a pomegranate it wasn't something she reached up and got off of a tree amen what did i tell y'all before say amen thank you i'm not the only one that believes this but remember the things that we talk about we talk about the fruit of the womb we talk about our family tree why do we call it a family tree because it's our progeny it's where we come from it's what we do as a family because we all come from the same trunk and i know that many people their tree doesn't have a lot of limbs on it some look like telephone poles but it still comes from a tree right you have a family tree so god is talking he's bringing trees and fruit and he's confounding the wives and prudent and revealing it to a bunch of people who just said well god you know you didn't put fig leaves on eve's mouth and adam's mouth and adam's hand right that's right he gave him lambskins to cover their body all right so we believe and we see through the scripture all the way through because i'm going to have to bring this out to get through the rest of the message that god saw that when he would put man in flesh that he would fall because man is just a higher form of animal this is animal flesh but he put a soul in a man to choose right or wrong that's what he said to adam and eve you'll do okay if you don't eat of that you can eat of everything else but don't eat that well now he didn't tell the animals that it's not it's not uh it's not vulgar for a female dog to to you know procreate in front of a million people we don't think a thing about that we think it's awesome i kind of helped zach a little bit today deliver that calf he was hollering for help down in the barn and i happened to walk up and and thank god i had my boots on all right i had poo all the way up to my knees so i got running down there and there's a calf hanging out of a cow that's the way it happens right but you know what that's the way it happened in the garden right animals were procreating before man right right right so we were to come to that in a sense to where we were supposed to come from the spoken word of god not a sex act amen that's right all right that's the tree of knowledge of good and evil not that the sex act is wrong we're all here we got children so we don't believe that it's wrong all right but we believe if it's not done right it's wrong all right so what happened was is eve let somebody get to her before adam did and that polluted that tree that's right our progeny or what was to come forth from eve the fruit of her womb amen was to be pure right holy amen she was supposed to know nothing but that right but when she started listening to satan's lie through the beast which the bible says the beast is the most was the most subtle creature he was an upright creature he wasn't a snake he was made into a snake we understand that okay he was made into a snake so he must have been something different before he was made into a snake all right that's what i've always said and and we believe here that darwin could have just looked in the bible and if he had a revelation he'd saw the missing link there was the missing link between man and monkey there's a gap there a chimpanzee won't coincide with a woman but remember though in evolution evolution says one evolves into the other and man's the highest form so something's got to evolve all the way up to man the chain was broke somewhere right so satan knew that he knew that that beast standing in the garden the serpent the upright creature because how could a s how could a serpent a snake be guy leave now that's what she said she said he the beast has beguiled me now you can say whatever you want to say but defile if somebody come up to you and said i've been defiled or beguiled you wouldn't think of an apple or an orange or any other fruit but one thing there was a problem somewhere between a man and a woman so we believe that you know trying to add a little something comical but it's really not it's it's a great revelation that we see that it ties all of genesis right into revelations all right we see that it was the beast that started in the garden it's the beast that ends in the book of revelations it's that same old devil that got into that beast and told eve a better way of doing something he's trying to get into this even it has not this eve but that eve out there he's got into her and give her another lie and what is she producing bastard children right exactly sorry that's just the way it is all right but now look so we look at these words of eating and partaking in fruit and trees so let's not be carnal and see that it was a a tree in the garden of eden it was a it was a person right it was a person now and then what happened in the garden there was fruit produced there was two fruit right that's right one was cane one was able twins all right one by the beast came because he produced exactly remember if you are an apple tree pears are not going to fall off of your limb right right if you're an apple tree that fruit is going to fall off and it's called an apple because you have apple life in you well kane showed he had a problem that adam was not his daddy the beast was his daddy and you know as i was telling june the other day we were talking about something and excuse me you know brother branham said that that where did somebody ask himself where did cain get his wife and he said we married his sister well actually it wasn't his sister it was his half sister because adam was the daddy of all the girls the beast was the daddy of cain do you know that beastly that beast's dna is still around somewhere remember they asked brother branham that he said it's in that serpent remember that's what he said he said lord explain to me because you know that seed that came out of the beast that went into eve to produce cane cain didn't die came produced children so there's a progeny of of that fruit that come off the wrong tree but now remember once that happened then we all come from that tree because abel needed a sacrifice just like cain did amen right that's where people in the message they said oh abel was so and abel was righteous he knew what to offer right because he come from a godly lineage his dad adam took care of him right procaine didn't have a daddy his daddy was crawling around in holes yeah let's be honest really that's where the beast went but you see that cain comes from this progeny or from this tree but once that happened to eve it moved us all over onto the tree of knowledge of good and evil because even adam moved from the tree of life to the tree of knowledge of good and evil and sold all of us out because we're going to see that's what was that's what was kind of um burning in my heart and we'll finish this but i want to kind of give you maybe the end of the story that tree of life standing in the garden was genesis 1 26-27 because i'm going to read you a quote in just a minute where brother brown said it was the holy ghost right exactly and it they ain't too holy ghost if you've got the holy ghost and this genesis 1 26 and the holy ghost was standing in the garden because see that's what we were supposed to get to right we were supposed to get to that we were supposed to come and be given eternal life but since we eat off the tree of knowledge we're polluted that's why we're dying that's why death is in the camp exactly but with the new birth i was preaching on a new birth this weekend and and uh deanna went with us and and she punched june i was talking about you know i was born from samuel and peggy dale and then i got a new birth because my first birth from samuel and peggy dale i'm dying but my second birth from heaven the new birth which is that genesis 1 26 calling my name and i responded she punched june and said paw paw was born two times that's right she listened and that's absolutely correct right because my first birth was off the tree of knowledge of good and evil my name's got to get transferred somewhere to that tree of life all right and i want to i'll read you a quote on that that i really found that was that was striking that brother branham you say well now i don't know about this brother brown said in a paradox don't put it up but i'm going to read it to man it says you and i are hanging on the tree of life after we've accepted christ right what i want you to see tonight is that tree of life there's not something out yonder it's not something we got to get to it's not something right that's right we're hanging on it glory because we're the fruit of that production of that tree which is jesus christ not by sex anymore by the spoken word which is the way it should have been all right so now dad read this the other night an exposition of the seven church ages but we're going to read it again because we're going to kind of go through it a little slow now that we have come this far let me try to crystallize your thinking on this subject so you can see the necessity of our going into the serpent seed doctrine as i have we start with the fact that there were two trees in the midst of the garden the tree of life was jesus the other tree is definitely satan because of what came forth of the fruit of that tree amen got it all right the fruit of that tree in other words the production of that tree was death all right obviously the production of the tree of life would mean life all right now then we know that both of those trees had a relationship to man or they would never have been placed there right so now how do we have a relationship with a physical tree oak palm pine we have no physical relationship with a tree but yet the two trees we had a physical relationship because it was part of what we were satan on this side god on this side you're sitting there today with satan on this side god on this side all right you still have a choice they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god in their relationship to mankind and to himself or we could never impute omniscience unto god all right in other words he's all-knowing he knew all this was going to happen there was no crisis meeting in heaven when satan did what he did with eve god knew that he knew when he put us in flesh we would fall because the flesh is weak all right it's just animal flesh until you get the holy ghost right that's why we were trying to get to the tree of life amen and the way stopped to get there not now but it was then right all right they must have had a part in the sovereign plan and purpose of god and their relationship to mankind and to himself or we can never impute omniscience unto god this is all true so far is it not now the word most definitely sets forth that from before the foundation of the earth the purpose of god was to share his eternal life with man to me that's just i mean before the foundation of the world our names were put on the lamb's book of life he was a lamb slain before the foundation of the world adam was covered before he got here eve was covered before he got here all right i'm talking about before jesus got here all right and we'll read something in just a minute it may shake your bones man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first right amen all right because the genesis 1 26 man all of that manifestation of that genesis 1 26 man was not all in adam adam was going to be able to produce that he had the control to do it right but we weren't all that genesis 1 26 man is not a flesh man that's a spirit man and when gen and when god created or brought adam out of the dust of the ground he put part of that 126 man into adam all right everybody okay with that all right that's why he could be what he was all right he was the son of god the bible calls him a son of god so i agree with the bible all right man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first so the tree of life was eternal amen all right so there's a characteristic the tree of life was eternal whatever come off of that tree of life whatever that tree of life was it's eternal life and it's like i told them this past weekend there's only one form of eternal life there's not two eternal life there's not three eternal life there's not a different eternal life over here that god's got and a different eternal life that you and i have hello not different same all right now he had it in the fullness because remember he was born right the first time jesus christ was born right he was born without sin you and i were born in sin shaping iniquity spouse from our mother's womb the fruit of the tree of knowledge all right whether you like it or not but there's a way back he didn't leave us without the way back and i'll read you something just a minute that really struck my soul last night i wasn't really looking for it but if you'll just pop up tree of life as about 198 quotes and read through there and they'll really bless your heart because a lot of times we just say well the tree of life is jesus and and he's this and he's that i want to make it more personal now you and i weren't standing in the garden of eden watching all this going on but you know what the reason that we can see what's going on in the garden it's because what's inside of you was standing there in the garden that's what we've got to see and if we're going to ever take a body change we got to see that that genesis 1 26 man never sinned right that's right never had a bad thought you and i've had one today i'm sure this is yes this is no if you're perfect that's fine pray for us we're not as far up the tree as you are all right but we did we had bad thoughts we had bad ideas but that was in the human realm that was in the realm of human flesh that that we come into satan's domain and he is bombarding our brain there's no way that you can uh repent enough to get good enough right that's right brother brown said the other day i was talking to brother claude he said and he read me the quote he said brother brown said own our best day we're a failure now if you'll approach it that way on our best day brother chris never misses a note he plays right through 25 songs and never misses a note and he misses one note on number 26. he's a failure yeah i don't think so but anyway i mean that's the way you got to look at it the best we can do now that's a profit telling us the best we can do were failures right so if we'll approach it that way and see that it has to be in christ we have to be in christ it's not that we're this great tree of life and and we're this great thing with the you know with a uh tnl on our on our chest tree of life you know we're not a superman in other words but what it's what god has made us though if we go and partake of that tree of life then we get life but it's a choice that we have to make all right it's a choice it's it all still comes down to choice all right even when you're born again you've still got choices to make right because we're still human this thing right here is subject to sin it's subject to bad thoughts in our brain don't try to don't try to do away with the thoughts i i see a lot of people and and i want to make this known i see a lot of people that that they just listen to brother branham and hey listen don't get me wrong but what they're doing i'm seeing is is they're trying to ward off demons by listening to the prophet 24 7. you drive yourself crazy live a human life we're human beings i was thinking coming up the road today i was thinking god brother branham wanted to be a prophet to storm out save thus saith the lord and walk back into the wilderness now that didn't happen but remember there was no prophet that ever came on the face of this earth that was as complete as that man was he was a father he had children he enjoyed his wife he enjoyed her company he enjoyed millions of people at one time in his ministry he was given a million and a half dollars and he turned it down handed the check back to the people because there were stipulations involved and he knew that but we see that that he's come to where he was a a prophet of prophets he wasn't like elijah elijah's never had a i never saw in the bible where he had a wife you know elisha some of them gave their life for the gospel of jesus christ or the gospel that that they knew and then here you got brother branham who who was a father he he was a son to a daddy and he loved his mother and he got to she got to sit under his ministry for years and and he baptized all of his family i mean look how complete he was so i'm glad he wasn't a prophet that stormed out and said thus saith the lord and went back in the wilderness i'm glad he was a man that walked among us that that could put up a christmas tree that won't go too well but that's all right praise the lord anyhow man could not directly let's go back man could not directly come and partake of that tree of life in the midst of the garden that eternal life of the tree had to become flesh first now the reason it didn't become flesh back then it's what what eve and the beast did god said i'll not come through an unclean vessel when eve was polluted when she had the relationship with the beast thinking she was doing right because it did say multiplying replenish the earth she was trying to do what god said she wasn't a perverted woman right right she underperverted woman right all right she was trying to forward god's plan but that's why your sisters can't preach you've got an emotional side it's like somebody said the other day you know what satan got to first eve's motherly instinct because she was a woman he got to her motherly instinct and that's exactly what he did that beef said hey look at those puppies having puppies look at how that mother mothers that puppy look at the mother part and she just stepped right into it not knowing what she was doing right remember she was deceived but adam wasn't adam knew what went on but adam in portraying christ he took eve because he was literally a part of him literally it literally that was adam in another form all right but she was to reproduce off the tree of life right because they said multiply and replace the earth did it not right in genesis 1 26 that's what she was supposed to do but satan got there first injected his plan first in this womb this is the greatest womb right here is the womb of your mind then she just acted the part of the mother and cain came forth well god said hey i can't do anything with that anymore you can't get to the tree of life adam you can't even get back to it because they're so holy you can't have you can't get a body change from this you can't get you're going to die because he said the day you eat thereof that's the day you're going to die all right okay so everybody got that but before god could raise and save a sinner he had to have a sinner to raise and save man had to fall all right the fall which would be caused by satan had to have flesh to make fall now remember daddy preached this other day wonderful wonderful message satan had to come through flesh also right but it wasn't through human flesh he had to use animal flesh all right satan had to come to flesh also but satan could not come through human flesh satan vicariously entered that beast and produced his product to eve and she protook it to make the fall as would christ come in human flesh to restore the fall amen all right everybody got that say ma'am all right let's go to number four and i want to kind of set a stage here this is a i love this quote because remember even cain as bad as he was and as bad as the product that was produced god still cain was a soul cain had soul right right right cain wasn't cursed and was black and all these other things like people said that's not true cain was cursed because of what he did right he's talked to god like he like he was a dog almost all right he didn't have the right attitude he didn't he didn't approach god but listen this puts everybody on equal basis right here 1957 thirsting for life and i thought what makes people do that how come that men and women will do these things and i thought this god created man to thirst for life all right that thirst that's in you is a creation of god amen now that's everybody exactly adolf hitler had a thirst for god he wanted a superhuman race right well what's god gonna have right a superhuman race what adolf hitler's problem was is he ate off the tree of knowledge right right and stayed on the tree of knowledge he didn't ever get the new birth if he got a new birth he wouldn't have done what he done all right so he stayed on that tree and right and wrong is set before you as a tree of life and death in the garden of eden and god made you to thirst and how dare you take that blessed thirst that god has put in you to thirst after him and try to quench it on the things of the world because see everybody says well you come with this seed in you and that's why you could respond to eternal life or you could respond to the word well brother brown puts everybody on equal basis right here right the devil trying to make men and women run the nightclubs and cocktail parties and live immorally because they are thirsting and that thirst that's in you is of god hey even man in his fallen condition has a god-like quality adolf hitler had a god-like quality what he had an anointing he could get people to literally die for him right all right so he had an anointing but he turned that anointing that god was going to give him elvis presley had an anointing he sold that anointing out for a fleet of cadillacs or for money or for fame or for fortune right so there was a thirst and that thirst that's in you is of god all right and it'll never be satisfied until christ that fountain of everlasting life fills your soul it is totally impossible because until you eat off the tree of life you're going to eat off the tree of knowledge of good and evil there's only two trees there's not a tree and a half somewhere there's not a tree and a quarter there's two trees all right because they are thirsting christ the fountain of everlasting life filled your soul is totally impossible the devil will make you believe that you're living but you are dead in sin and trespasses how could you take that blessed holy thirst all right so everybody's own free moral agency everybody's come here the same hey listen cain and abel were born the same way right amen that's right they were born from their mother by their father's natural seed it was just satan's or the beast on one side and adam on the other all right you say how can that happen well many times it's happened many times even recently i know when brother branham preached it remember there was a white woman had a black baby and a white baby she had been with a black man that morning and a white man the afternoon and she had a set of twins and one with black one was white that happened not too long ago i think it was in chicago that there was a a woman had two babies by two different men so it's not it's not so far-fetched to say that that happened which we read in the bible we see that absolutely that's what happened all right so let's go to the next one this is where i want us to to hone in on here and and finish up and look at these characteristics this is from a paradox i was thinking of death and we're on we're on leaves a leaf hangs on a tree to serve a purpose now he's talking about natural type and the spiritual we look at the trees outside right now what are they they're dead but they're not there's life in it somewhere it just an intelligence told it to go into the roots until this until the sun comes out and then when the sun comes out it comes back up out of the now man didn't tell it to do that right right it's by nature it's by god he said it that way same thing with you and i all right this is what the prophet is is showing a leaf hangs on a tree to serve a purpose and you and i are hanging on a tree of life after we've accepted christ we didn't come here in this world hanging on the tree of life we came here hanging on the tree of knowledge of good and evil whether you like it or not right you were the product of that product right right that's why brother brown said you could you were born between satan and eve swank could say that because that's the that's what he came from right all right every death every sorrow every heartache every war every funeral home every funeral service everything started in the garden of eden right right because there was no death before that they could go to the tree of life and have life all right but they chose to go to the tree of knowledge of good and evil you and i are hanging on a tree of life after we've accepted christ and after a while when the season's changed life goes out of that leaf down into the root comes back again next year bringing a new leaf now remember we christians who believe in christ have eternal life and hanging on the tree of life glory but someday this old leaf will drop off now he's talking about this guy it'll go down into the ground die but there come a resurrection just as sure as the leaves come back on that tree next year in about march or april that same life that's in that tree if it's got an apple life in it there's an apple tree gonna that apple sap is gonna come right back up it's gonna go right out to the end of the into the branches and guess what there's an apple going to be produced all right same thing with you and i that's why it says those who are dead in christ shall rise first it didn't say dead because all the dead's not coming up i've always said that don't mean physical death if you're dead in christ you'll rise first because you never died that's right but if you died in christ you got to do that here right you got to die to yourself and get on that tree of life all right because we are on a different tree i'm sorry countdown 1962. tree hangs this leaf and they explaining the same thing and we are on a tree of life when we're born again not when we're born the first time right right one more time do y'all not believe that oh amen that means so be it and we are on a tree of life when we're born again amen and when life leaves this the life goes back to the god that gave it to come again in the millennium with a leaf that can't drop off the tree there you are eternal that's perpetual life we have eternal life now remember that tree that was in the garden of eden was eternal right tree of life was eternal now we're going to read in a little while that tree in the in the book of revelations is inside the city and it's eternal amen amen all right let's go to number seven and i'm so glad that the tree of life is still blooming the holy spirit here amen so the tree of life's the holy ghost or the holy spirit if ghost bothers you it's the holy spirit right that's right hey it does bother some don't say holy ghost to a baptist they'll get all shivering say holy spirit but it's the same thing the holy spirit here where one time it drove us away from the tree because remember once that was cut off between adam and eve and what they did in the garden there's no way the holy ghost could be given to anybody until the way was made back how simple can it be just looking at the tree of life if you can't get back to it then that must mean that nobody in the old testament had the holy ghost amen but when jesus came and give us the way back he said i am the way the truth and the life amen on the day of pentecost that tree came back the way was jesus remember he didn't come dated ready like sunday he didn't come to bring us an inheritance our inheritance was hanging on the tree of life our inheritance was the holy ghost glory our inheritance was our name in the book before the foundation of the world that's right amen amen there's the tree of life standing in the garden it had the ability to bring me and you the same holy ghost you've got in you tonight it's the same one that was standing back there that's why we can understand these things i've already said this and you won't you'll understand it one day when you get a revelation it ain't your knowledge man's knowledge says fully on genesis where it was an app it said i had to be an apple hey don't think so right that's right adam and eve did not go around with skins on their hands and their mouth right their private parts were covered up right now they were naked before what made them find out that was dirty right and it's not dirty if you do it right i'm so glad that the tree of life is still blooming the holy spirit here right all right that's pretty neat i like that quote i'm gonna keep that one that's in my favor hall of favorites right there because see that's what struck me when daddy was preaching that he's talking about the tree of life something that had life had to be in that garden because there was death there too exactly all would have died if there hadn't been a tree of life standing there away was marred in genesis but when jesus came he brought that tree with him right glory that's right then he opened himself up at calvary and said now i'll read you a quote in a minute now i'm going to have a bride tree right we've missed that one right but the bride three in the tree of life is the same thing if not you've got two different eternal lifes again all right i love this where one time it drove us away from the tree until there was could be reconciled to god through a blood sacrifice animal blood had no eternal life in it exactly that's right and no man born from the tree of knowledge of good and evil could have eternal life in it exactly not before jesus amen jesus came with eternal life in him amen therefore he could give it to us so the eternal sacrifice was a blood sacrifice absolutely it was a man but absolutely it was the blood of god mary had nothing to do with it neither did joseph had nothing to do with it it was god almighty created egg and sperm placed it in an oven called mary so he wasn't a jew he wasn't a gentile he was god gloria he lied if he said i come from god and i went to god if he said i come from mary and went to mary he didn't say that he said i come from god and i go to god so he came straight from the hand of god god created an egg created a sperm put it in mary you say how in the world that hey like mama said they're proving it every day now there was a grandmother the other day had her own grandchild right they took the egg from the mother egg from the father some way she couldn't produce they put it in grandma and she had the baby y'all saw it i saw it on the internet she had her own grandchild why law of god he said multiply and replenish the earth he even said it when they were in flesh so guess what he told the animals he told noah after the flood he said multiply and replenish the earth there's a law there when an egg and a sperm comes together if you put it in a warm environment it's going to have a baby so let's don't think so much that it that we can't see that a creator that created all the universe he created every star he created what you're standing on he actually created you could create an egg and a sperm and put it in a woman that's right that's the only way he can be virgin born all right so let's get off of this junk about mary producing anything mary produced nothing god almighty created that's why in revelations 3 14 it says he's the beginning of the creation of god you know why because that is what we were supposed to be in the garden that's why i can look back in the garden and i can see exactly what happened because christ came to come in here that i can look back now i told him the other day that's why brother brown said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's doing here should be an invincible army now remember we got to see where we come from the seals shows three things right that which was which is and which is to come right right and then what he said many times on the seal but that which was which is so we can look back to what was and realized that that new birth that we have in us was that tree of life standing in the garden of eden not another person not god sending a son amen no he created himself a body and then he stepped into that body as a baby hello as a baby because he had to be a blood sacrifice he had to be our brother he couldn't be an animal animal sacrifices only push sin to calvary because remember that animal blood had no soul that had no eternal property about it right but when god came in human flesh he had an eternal property glory yes sir exactly caused us called the soul of almighty god amen the very one who said let there be hey even the bible says you're the creator jesus christ is the one who created all things not jesus the flesh amen but he was born we see now that we come up to christmas time the bible says he was born lord the christ so you take that christ that identity of that christ and you take it back when we were talking about genesis 1 26 there was the christ there was the one that said let there be and that's the one that come into you and i if you're born again tonight that same person amen that same person no smaller or no greater came into me and you and gave us eternal life amen and you can't deny the word if he did oh right because it is the word it'd be word denying word it'd be god denying god you can't do that that's why i'm telling you we can understand things people can't understand because people think they got the new birth because they live good judas lived good right that's right remember he fooled all 11 of them disciples the only person he didn't fool was jesus right because they were asking questions well who is it lord is it me is it me is it me he said the one that stops the bowl and there was judas probably stopping the bowl and they still didn't see it why their eyes were blinded because judas was so close to jesus satan is so close to god oh it's not the honky tonks in the bars and he doesn't wear a red suit with a red tail and horns no the bible says he was made beautiful he was the anointed cherub he'll anoint you and make you think it's god when it's the absolute devil himself but the way you can find out is if you deny this word that's who it is if you don't deny this word if something rings in your heart if something rings in your heart that that ain't nothing but the truth that's what mary said that ain't nothing but the truth be it unto me according to that word and that's what you and i got to get to but we see that somewhere down the line though you're going to produce what tree you're on right because the truth the tree will always produce fruit right all right so you're going to produce one way or the other you're either going to be on the tree of knowledge stay on the tree of knowledge it's not have a problem we don't have a problem being on the tree of knowledge the problem is it's staying on the tree of knowledge yeah because that's the way we came we could not determine the way we came here right exactly right what my uh we were talking about a certain cousin of ours and it was a in-law that we were talking to and he said well you know he said your cousin didn't have a thing to do with him getting into the dale family and i looked at him and i said but you married into one yeah you're the one who's got the problem he didn't have a choice you did so in other words we were born between satan and even there was nothing we could do about it right we were born into that family because of our adulterous parent adam and eve now is that what the prophet said adulterers of parents put us onto this tree but we don't have to stay on that tree anymore we've got a way made back to the tree of life but we got to realize it's not a tree up in heaven right that's right or a tree in the garden that we got to go to that tree is living and abiding in the believers of the end time amen that's right because the ones that are dead are going on and they're hanging on that tree absolutely but they're in their theophany they're standing there pure just like genesis 1 26 where one time it drove us away from the tree until there could be reconciled to god through a blood sacrifice which was somebody that like brother claude always says that had the goods right jesus had the goods right he could back up everything he said glory he had the goods them caiphas and all them high priests i was thinking today i thought man the very ones that should have absolutely just fell at jesus's feet they were the highly religious they were the only religious people in the world there wasn't a religious sect over here that that that accepted jesus and one didn't all religions denied him just like they are today right that same one that motivated them is the same one that's motivating here remember the people die but the spirits lives on all right could be reconciled to god through a blood sacrifice and now the holy spirit's running us back to that tree i don't know how it's done i just believe it that's all that's the way to do it just simple faith we got to hurry all right let's go to the next one this is let's go to yeah there you go true and false witness the holy spirit guarded the tree of life until the atonement was made now who's he talking about jesus at calvary right that was the only atonement and now the holy spirit is running the people to the tree of life adam and eve was trying to get to the tree of life now their children are trying to stay away from the tree of life right the holy spirit was guarding it now it's bringing them to it and they refuse to hear the holy spirit's voice because the same adversary that caused them to sin in the beginning is keeping them away from the tree of life and jesus christ is the tree of life now here is the characteristics you say well i don't know if the holy spirit was a tree well i want you to watch this right here in adoption 1960. next one number nine god buys elected election grace called you god by his election election grace sanctified you god buys election grace and his power baptize you and put you into this land of rest they which have entered into this rest have ceased from their going astray they cease from their works like god did from his they have joy unspeakable and full of glory now is this a part of your life the tree of life is blooming in them that gives us an eternal quality exactly they have long suffering what this is fruits on the tree remember the fruits of the spirit love joy peace that's what he's saying all right they have long suffering gentle goodness patience faith faith faith meekness gentleness and so forth the tree of life is blooming in them because their hope is anchored in christ jesus the witness of the holy ghost bearing record with signs and wonders following the believers these signs shall follow them that believe as they go along they heal the sick they cast out devils we still believe in this amen they speak with tongues we still believe in that saying amen they see visions we still believe in that say amen they walk with god let's say amen they talk with god let's say amen no devil can move them amen wow this is a pretty powerful group of people they're steadfast looking for eternal life forgetting those things that are in the past they press toward the mark of the high calling in christ jesus there they are there they are that's that church now remember he's quoting scripture like dad said many times that's he's quoting scripture because he says forgetting those things which are past that's paul said that right okay so now let's go to number 10. now it would be funny i should have put this quote up in the front but it would be funny if these trees was just a natural tree of wood because you notice right here it says these cherubims that john saw here must have been interested in keeping the tree of life so they must be interested in human beings not spirits right not other trees right human beings are read genesis getting back to genesis again they kept the tree of life guarded it the way of life the way of life how is the way jesus said i am that way i am that bread that come from god out of heaven if a man eats this bread he'll live forever ever now there's a way back to that tree of life you get it all right now watch this right here now remember don't turn it up there yet genesis 3 15 shows that i'll put god says i'll put enmity between what thy seed so the serpent had to have a seed because it said thy seed and the seed of the woman right which we put that is as christ coming as a baby right yeah christ the mystery of god reveal 1963 now remember he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he's that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden you should be shouting there stood to see to the woman it didn't have to be what was coming that's what struck me the other day that's what struck me i read christ the mystery for probably a hundred times and i never read this quote unless they put forth their hand and moved this tree they'd eat that tree and live forever in other words they couldn't get back to that because of the serpent seed but god promised that he's going to send the seed of the woman but we thought well that's down here in december 25th when jesus was born well we know he wasn't born on december 25th anyway you know lambs were born in april they're not born december 25th remember that's the sun god's birthday not the son of god's birthday all right a catholic dogma that we still celebrate because the world does i like this kind of year you i told somebody the other day i said you throw me under the message bus if you want to back over me twice i don't care i like christmas some people will throw you under the bus and they'll you'll hear that they're backing up but anyway i'm still human that brother branham was human we're all human we're still human he is that tree of life contrary to the serpent seed you see he's that seed the woman's seed the tree of life in the garden he didn't have to wait to be born a baby we know he did but we know that god was standing in that garden and he was prophesying amen but he was standing there because he's the one that said that and he's the one that was born sometimes you say well well that was god talking there and that was jesus being born a baby no that was jesus talking there in the form of the father that's why he could say before abraham was i am that's why he could say he knew all these things unless they put forth their hand and moved this tree they'd eat that tree and live forever he's the only tree that can be taken that you can live forever his word is life and that be the word then the word of god which eve turned down in the garden then here is christ the word made manifest what a wonderful quote the woman's seed was the tree of life standing in the garden didn't have to wait it was already there amen i love god he knows what he's talking about and what he says has to come to pass so there it was standing in the garden right the tree of life is the woman's seed standing right there in the garden of eden but he couldn't be our brother there he had to become flesh remember the last quote he had to become flesh because we fell in flesh adam didn't fall in his soul adam fell in his flesh amen amen his soul was eternal he said why how can he do that you and i do wrong don't we right that's right he was trying to save his wife right all right so it's not so much that that uh we're immune to things but adam was the son of god and that's what the bible says so i take the bible brother brother claude i love brother claude because he always said he said faith's final resting place is in the word of god you take a quote that seems contrary to the word you go to the word and let the word reveal i said reveal the quote to you all right so face final resting place places in the word of god all right so if adam was the son of god then and you and i are son of god then we all come that way with the holy ghost with eternal life there's not two eternal life adam didn't have a lesser eternal life and thus a greater one no he create he control things see and that's what we're coming back to because remember the holy ghost has been bound the prophet said for two thousand years well remember it was loosed on the day of pentecost right the holy ghost was loosed on the day of pentecost the tree of life came into view on the day of pentecost but down through the church ages man has injected their own idea just like there's old satan you remember satan don't take vacations you might and i might but satan doesn't when you're not at church he's sitting here right he's always here all right let's finish right here 1964 is a man here that can turn on light i like that other quote though that's a good quote from christ the mystery how many of you read that before yeah okay god's wonderful he'll reveal it to you if you'll just wait well i've read that 47 times well you know what he may come to you on the 48th exactly he just may be waiting on something to clear out of the way so that he can talk to you because you know what you and i control how god talks to us no remember you're god's right so i told him that brother tom crushing that you see the bible says grieve not the holy spirit of god brother brown said the holy ghost was timid that he was a gentleman and and the holy ghost would go out on a limb if you do something wrong and you start misbehaving now he doesn't leave you and go it's a metaphor in other words he goes somewhere where you can't find him for a little while because you you you get these thoughts from god and you get in the channel and everything's going great and then the kids start screaming and the wife starts screaming and you know this one calls you and the lights go off and the air condition well what is that that's the devil he sees god coming before you do oh yeah right bro chris said amen so everyone should say amen amen remember satan is a spiritual being he's not an idiot he's a spiritual being so he feels that spiritual part of god coming to you and then he tries to cut that thing off right right maybe some of you not maybe i'm a little different i guess but it's the way it happens to me satan seems to get there first but you know what somewhere in there like brother brown said i can't explain it he said but somewhere in there god comes through all that right and you read christ the mystery god revealed you know what you may be reading it one day and angelic beings start appearing and and everything's just so nice and sweet and you don't get a thing from the sermon yeah but you may be like brother brown told that guy he said you fought your way here right well the guy said i didn't just got in the car and come to work but he just didn't realize the spiritual world those demons were fighting in that spiritual world you don't think there's demons oh yeah geez i'm looking at a bunch of them i'm looking at all of us but we are we have a lot of demons that we need to get rid of we all do all right so we've got to fight that though remember the kingdom of god is taken by force joshua did not tell those people go into that land and possess that land and the people are just going to fall over dead you're not going to have to fight no they fought for every inch but now god promised them he said if you'll keep under joshua's control which is the holy ghost he said if you'll keep under his control you won't lose a man but they still had to fight what a miracle that's a better miracle than to walk in and people just fall over what a miracle brother marty today was 600 000 people killed in the civil war 600 000 killed joshua fought battles just like that maybe not with the same armament but they were hand to hand it was close combat with them they didn't lose a man until aiken did what he did they didn't lose nobody i mean you go out there with 5 000 men you figure well i may come back with 4 000 on a good day on a good day you send five out five comes back send eight out eight comes back but see remember they got out aiken got out from under the leadership of the holy spirit right and thought he could do something over here and he couldn't got found out about it okay somebody said one time said remember now aiken was in the land he just messed up so think about that turn on the light man here they can turn on the light this is the last one sorry to hold you a little bit long i was going to try to quit it's a bride tree jesus was the bride he was a tree jesus was the bride yeah he's the one that makes us bride right they cut him down he was the tree of life that was in the garden of eden they cut him down and hung him on a roman tree to make fun of him what did he do god raised him up on the third day from the dead and today there's a bride tree it started back there at the beginning way back at the day of pentecost all right so now let's turn to revelations 22 because this is going to show you that it's the holy ghost all the way through from the beginning to the end you read here in revelations 22 let's turn to it because that they've got it up here but i don't have it i got to read it out my bible and i want to personally thank my sunday school class for getting me an ipod and i was going to use it but brother joe's in in new mexico and i failed to get him to put it on my computer he put it on another computer and my iphone but he didn't put it on the dell computer that i do all this from so i couldn't put it in dropbox and put it on my ipad to bring it here tonight so if you understand all that praise lord but i didn't have but i don't have my but i think the uh sunday school class for getting men an ipad that's what i wanted for christmas and they so graciously uh thanks to all the brothers and sisters that go to my sunday school class i've always wanted one because the reason i do is because it's easier for me to put that on there and to do this um from that ipad i can put all my information in one place and that's all i'm going to use it for is just use it for putting sermons in and checking emails and stuff from people all right so revelations 22 this is now where are we at now now we were in the garden of eden with a tree of life right and it was the holy ghost it was eternal life right it hasn't changed so now what is going to be excuse me what is going to be in the future home the holy ghost everybody that has the holy ghost is going to be inside the city right so watch what appears inside the city verse two in the midst of the street of it and on either side now what what it is is john has already seen the city come down right let's go back to revelations back here in 21 and i saw a new heaven and a new earth we don't believe brother that we're going to heaven because the bible says heaven and earth will pass away but we're coming to a new heaven and a new earth which is going to be this earth this is where we're going to live you say well how do you know that well that's where adam started adam was the god of the earth he lost it guess what redemption is not replacement god's going to redeem everything that adam lost and bring us right back to the adam condition right and we're going to rule and reign on this earth this is where glory is going to be we're not going to walk around on a cloud what a boring thing i'm sorry and play harps i can't hardly play spoons but no we're gonna live right here as human beings we're gonna live on this earth enjoying all this in the bible and i saw a new heaven and a new earth for the first heaven and her first earth would pass away revelation 21 and there was no more sea and i john saw the holy city new jerusalem coming down where was john on the earth coming down from god out of heaven prepared as a bride a dorm for a husband now he's showing all the things that's inside the city and he showed me a pure river of water clears crystal produ proceeding out of the throne of god and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bears 12 matters of fruit and yielded their fruit every month and the leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations now you can believe that's a natural tree if you want to that's okay but whatever it is if it's not eternal the branches are all going to be gone after a while let's just be sensible right all right you can believe it's a real one or you believe it's us whichever one you want to believe because there's 12 tribes there's 12 apostles okay it's just something to think about because we don't have time it's almost nine o'clock was there the tree of life which bear twelve matter of fruit and yielded their fruit because remember you can't fruit doesn't heal a nation but the fruits of the spirit heals a nation love joy peace long suffering meekness gentleness and what that those kings do they come in and they get that glory and honor and they take it back out and they say hey people there's a group in there that's right this god right that's right man what did you see i just saw one person in that whole city no there's millions upon millions upon millions it says not as seeds as of many but one seed christ so when they see the multiplying of god it's god let's go back to genesis 1. let us make man in our own image let him multiply and replenish the earth that's what that was it just got stopped in the garden by satan he actually stopped sons and daughters of god from being born in the garden but he didn't stop god from coming down into satan's eden satan went into god's eden and messed it up now god's coming right down into satan's eden and he's going to have a group of people he said the world will see me no more but you'll see me because i'll be with you even in you to the end of the age and then what's going to do it's going to carry it right up here to the tree of life and everybody that lives in that city has got the holy ghost born again here not some purgatory that we were prayed into just randy you know all that she was a catholic before what a pitiful thing you can act like you want to kill as many people as you want to you can smoke drink cuss run around with women do whatever but when you die you go into purgatory and then we'll clean you up once you get in there my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness not some purgatory no no give me god here amen not there that's right give me god here because if i got god here brother gary he'll take me there i got a free ride i got a free ride on the tree of life and it'll take me right into the paradises of god then you've got revelation 22. i got to hurry verse 12 through 15 behold i come quickly now look watch this and behold i come quickly and my reward is with me to give every man according as his work shall be i am alpha and omega i'm the tree of life in the beginning i'm the tree of life in the end i am alpha and omega the beginning and the end the first and the last bless now where did i where did you see that word when we first started and god blessed them right right where'd that word bless come from all the way now it's right back into the into the garden into the garden of god now blessed are they that do his commandments that they may have right to the tree of life and may enter in through the gates into the city for without or dogs and sorcerers and whoremongers and murderers and adulterers or whatever loveth and make us a lie now that scripture has always bothered me because inside the city it says the tree of life and there's the people live that has the holy ghost but i you know i told claud the other day i said i hate you with a godly hate because he can sit at home he's retired he's only 57 he's retired but he can sit all day in research scriptures uh anything in the on the internet he can research and he says and researches all this but the way he sees it and i see it the same way because remember the people that are given eternal life for a cup of water in my name and all those things like that they're still what they were but god has given them eternal life they were dogs they were sorcerers they were whoremongers and murders but you know what somewhere down the line a murderer is going to get eternal life you say all murders can't enter into the kingdom well they won't but they were right but they won't know anything about jesus christ and what a blessed thing you and i can do is take them up under a tree somewhere and sit down let's stand set them under a tree that tree of life not a tree of life we got to go to you and i are the tree of life come on we got to believe this thing is more personal than we've ever believed in our life that the tree of life is not something up there somewhere that we got to go to it's right here and it's going to transform us off of the tree of knowledge of good and evil right that's right transformed by the renewing of our mind what this is what we thought before but now this is the way we think now because we have a part of the thinker the very one the very one that wrote this bible dwells in you and i right the very one that wrote the bible the very one that created heaven and earth the very one dwells in you and me what you got oh there was a uh request sister charlotte called that's why they're not here tonight brother richard marlow is going tomorrow to the kidney specialist to have some test run looks like or going to kidney specialist tomorrow so we need to keep him in our prayers it was uh brother richard's not here tonight he sent me a text and said that he would be listening in so we'll be praying for you buddy still god still believe god heals that tree of life never got sick the tree of knowledge of good and evil got sick the tree of life never got sick now if we have the tree of life in us that's what we're gonna have to see if we got that in us residing right residing in us we have the same power he has right amen right that's my whole thing when i saw that the other day i thought man god had it all wrapped up in that tree of life standing in the garden man what a confidence we ought to have what a confidence we ought to have we ought to be so confident not arrogant but confident that god's going to do what he said he's not going to do it through a tree or a blade of grass or a cow it's good to have cows but that's okay they're not filled with the holy ghost but people that will do what god said and it'll be led and guided by the same one that said let there be light i've always said and it'll it'll strike you one day the reason we can read this bible with with spiritual intelligence is because the one that wrote it is inside of you paul said we have the mind of christ glory and the mind this is the mind of christ that's why we can look at that tree of life and we can see all these characteristics of that tree brother ryan it's not somewhere moses even said you ain't got to go get it you ain't got to go find it hey that's not thee even in the mouth the word of faith that we preach what we got that's right 2 30 in the red book i've about lost my voice let's worship him just for a few minutes and oh my father i pray me all same know my thoughts i pray think about him see if there be thank you lord somewhere can we in me cleanse me from everything and said me free worshiping now for cleansing me from sin fulfill thy word and make me pure within me pure willing where once i burned with shame is listen now oh lord take my life and make it hold thy great are you willing to do this take all my will my will not my will lord in me but we're saying this last one if you have a name oh holy ghost thank you lord all comes from the sins of revival start to work in me the word in me thy word declares that's what we were talking about tonight supply our needs for blessings now oh lord i how fitting cleanse me o god and know my heart today not this thing that's thumping with blood but the inner part of me the inner being you love the lord amen god bless each and every one of you thank you for coming remember the schedule next week no wednesday night service because it'd be christmas day and we'll have regular service this weekend so we'll be making that announcement again and just keep june 9 in your prayers uh for taking a little trip but let's remember as we pray brother richard marlow going to a kidney specialist tomorrow he's a healer and he'll supply our needs but you know what he's already done it that tree of life if you eat off of that tree he's already done it now if you eat off the tree of knowledge of good and evil the doctor says maybe we can help you because remember it's a practice right yeah that's right that's right you've lived a long time without help from doctors right it's been help from the almighty glory right we all you know what we're one breath from death we all are one breath from going out of here one breath life is so precious let's remember that in this uh this time of uh of holiday season that uh jesus is the reason for the season but he's 24 7 for us do what he is yeah he's the reason for any straw season he's a reason for the season of us getting out of here all right so we love you with the love of the lord just greet our visitor as he as we go out the door and tell him god bless you and always uh seats available for anybody who wants to come we appreciate visitors coming and we may seem a little crazy sometimes but paul said in a way it's called heresy in other words crazy people and the way it's called heresy paul had to forget everything he knew paul had to literally forget his phd his lld he had to forget all that because that's what got him in trouble he forgot that but he never now remember he never got illiterate he didn't he didn't become dumb no what god done is he used what paul had and paul yielded to him he said we have the mind of christ and paul could sit and pen 80 of the new testament right god god through paul could pen 80 he yielded himself so much because paul kept saying paul a prisoner of christ now if you and i if you're a prisoner you've done forfeited all your rights if you become a prisoner for christ that's the real reason for the season let's bow our heads to heavenly father we pray lord that you just bless each one on the way home we ask that what we've said lord would strike to the heart of the enemy and drive him back that we can look to you father the author and finisher of our faith father we pray for brother richard marlow that you will just whatever tomorrow the situation is that man's idea says there's something wrong but but we look to the tree of life we look to the to the author and the finisher of our faith and we we say that it's not it is not so because it wasn't so from the beginning it was not so adam was was perfect he was walking around in a perfect body but lord we know satan got in to your garden but now lord we know that you've come into satan's eden you've come into the garden of the devil himself and you're raising up a bride tree a tree that will never fall that will never be cut down again one that will abide forever and lord it's people not wood not brick not mortar you said a body thou has prepared me not of badger skin not of wood not of cedar but of flesh and that's where you said you were going to dwell so father we believe that we take the name of jesus with us and in jesus name we declare that brother richard marlow will be fine that all things will be done for your honor and glory lord that all of our faith will rise up together and be with him lord anything that goes on in the church lord if we have any other sickness or anything among us lord we pray that you would just absolutely just cleanse us and wash us from that lord just take care of us lord be with us on the highways be with our pastor lord and bless him and keep him strong be with him lord as he labors to minister the gospel to us lord and we pray that you'll be with all of us take care of us in jesus name amen you're dismissed uh me
