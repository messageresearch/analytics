really appreciate all of them and had a good time resting and you know my voice and things and and all of that so maybe we can holler a little more now we do that I want to thank everybody for your prayers and and the visitings and the things that for my wife she came home yesterday went in Friday had the operation came home yesterday and the knee replacement and she's doing one side better than she did before but naturally it's hurting and she's watching this morning the Lord willing there and she's really having a lot of hurting you know so I I was going to ask brother Benny if he would to kind of swing it around and let everybody wave better you know and and give her a little high from the congregation brother Benny can you swing that around and show her that everybody is is missing her and and everything else because we really do but we pray that this would be uh the thing she said this morning said I'm sure I'm glad I don't have another knee so uh you know cuz she's had both of

now with your presence this morning you've been here with the singing The Worship the Sunday School the teachings the doings and the things and all and the reading of your scriptures and things Lord and we pray that you would just come now as we read your word and speak about you for a little while that you'd come on the scene and open our eyes because that's our desire more than anything else to recognize the day and the hour that we're living is our desire we love you and we thank you forgive our sins cleanse s reach down touch your wife there Lord CU we know that you can as well as heal you can take away the pain The Agony and the things and just touch her and let everything be all right we love you in Jesus name amen we're going to read from Hebrews 11 1-2 and then verse 11 and then be seated and we'll read some more out of Hebrews okay so we're trying to I don't know where we going to make it today or not but uh we'll try to get through if we can on most of it today uh the Lord willing brother Bob will be preaching for us Wednesday you be here okay I have to check with some of these sometimes because they they miss on us and we have to make sure they're going to be there they're you know out traveling and doing their their preachings and the different things but so let's read a scripture now Faith is the substance of things hope far the evidence of things not seen for by it the elders obtained a good report all right now remember what we've been doing is covering the report that these Elders have made all right now we get over and we'll get back to her in a little bit but we go to verse 11 it says through faith also sah herself conceived strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised so you may be seated to the Lord at his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been covering for quite a while on and I thought it was uh good and and lined up real good with a lot of the brethren in their speaking of talking about a positive attitude you know because that's what we're trying to to talk about but what is our point of a positive attitude you can only have a positive attitude if you're sure of where you're at if you're sure of where you stand then you can be positive about it if not you will you know wish you wash you backwards and forth you'll have doubts and problems and things and what has always been my point everyone in the Bible that ever amounted to anything which we know no matter what would be the amount that they did did but all of those in the Bible did amount to something and each one of them had a positive attitude about their part and God would take that and write it and make a book out of it and it would be a beautiful picture to line up for all of the 66 books and all of the things to line up together to show the uh the understanding of God and bring it out to the right place but now what I want to do is because I don't want to take each each individual see you could be on what I've here in this Revelation I mean Hebrews 11 you could send another two or three years on it because we're taking each one but what I want to do is just kind of read each one not comment a lot but take that and then move into our thought so go ahead brothers and pull up Hebrews 11 and we'll start with verse 17 now I'm leaving out some reading purposely that we will the Lord willing if we get to it this afternoon we will pick up some of the things and my point today now don't get down we will read down to they without us cannot be made perfect but just hold that point and don't get on to that until maybe the Lord willing this afternoon all right but get to point of what I'm talking about that a positive attitude you know and all of the people in the Bible had that positive attitude you know these Warriors of faith and there is a quote brother random I got it on the desk there he said to think about all of these in Hebrews 11 and what they were and what they done and then think about ourselves and how little we are you know but now you know you know what I've tried to do and I've told you that I've Bend this away and you don't believe it that's all right cuz I I was praying yesterday and I thought Lord just get me on with preaching and forget all the other but from the time that I came in this message I saw these things in the Bible because I always um love to read the word all right and I studied the Bible you know before I came into the message and uh then when it did it began to open up and I could see and I've always had this positive attitude I mean even you know yourself you call me up on the phone and I'm dying I'm hurting I'm and this how you doing wonderful then wife says well what are you going to tell the doctor so I'm going to the doctor today and he says what's wrong with you are I'm wonderful I'm feeling great well I'm telling it like it is so I had to start telling the doctor said Doctor I'm doing wonderful feeling great oh but I got a headache can you get rid of it you know help me to do that you know or this is hurting or that but see now you'll be the point I want in a minute is to get something across to us about all of these that we're talking about but a very positive attitude and I've always had that about this message I've never been down about the message I've never had you know the wowy wowy Woos as brother fory says people do I've always been in an upbeat State about the message if anybody can show me I've been down I would like for you to speak up now I'm human hey yeah I do have a lot of downs and when you do have a positive attitude most people will never know it but you will have more Downs than people who don't have a positive attitude all right because you're going to be attacked on every hand right but you know yourself from the time that I've come that most of you have known me over 40 years going in towards 50 years that you know that I've always had one thing and that's driving to try to get the people to see who they are the first sermon here in 1971 July the 4th going Beyond man's camp that was what I preached on for us to go on forget all these other things quit running around horb you remember don't run around horb and just stay there let's go on in we've got a lot of wonderful things and we're going to talk about the the promise of the Bride or the bride's promises or our our our things because if we don't recognize the day that we're living see and most people take that recognizing your day and its message what do they say brother Rand was a prophet brother R was a prophet he brought the message we got the message we got the that's wonderful but what part of the message are we that's right well my part of the message just believe brother randam was part of the message well I mean we know that the devil knows that but what about your part you remember all these years we've been talking about that even Pentecost that brother randam said represented Mary but said they were only carriers but he said somebody's got to come back to the grain we'll get to that at the end of the message Lord will it see we've got to be the grain that went into the ground not just be a carrier you say yeah but I just don't understand because look like you know this would be that way this way what kind of a world do you think you're living in I mean you think this is going to be a flowy bed of ease and we're going out of here of a great hoopla I believe there will be a hoopla I've been in a Revival ever since I've been in in this message cuz I've never had a downtime in this message of not being in a Revival and it may be that I might go three months before the Lord speaks to me about something but I'm still up about it and I'm more up then than I am when he's speaking to me constantly because I know the devil is trying to hinder me from getting something so I just keep laying right in there cuz that's the that's me now and I I I'm just that way and that that's the way that I want to be because I want to have a positive attitude you know and and stay in that point but what is a positive attitude that's the reason I've been taking all of these of the Warriors of Faith you know and to see what their positive attitude was and when then the Lord willing if we get to it this afternoon if we don't we get next week we're not worry uh we'll get down to talking about they without us can not be made perfect all right so then they're waiting on you and I brother R said to the church is waiting on you and I those that have died and went on waiting on you and I adoption time he said when God can pour in his fullness and there be a resurrection and there'll be a Rapture why can't we believe that and look for forward to it instead of being and I know I was talking with Brother Gary the other day at the hospital there about it I've talked to you about it I've tried to preach to you that the world today see there's no more advancements we've gone to the Moon we've gone to this we've gone to that and it's just kind of the world is down the only thing they doing now is killing each other right I mean they're just working on killing each other they ain't working on trying to go up and do this or do that because we've done achieved the things that would represent the prophet said that interplanetary travel would represents the Rapture all right or going to the moon or whatever the statement he was making on that because that's the point that we're to do but somebody's got to do that right well we can keep on dying if you want to I mean you just keep on doubting and dying cuz that's what's keeping us here that's right I thought death was The Last Enemy to be destroyed I thought somebody would look at death and life at it but see I've watched this for now 20 30 years in the people of the message especially it's just kind of down have you noticed very new doctrines that even started in the past 10 years even wrong doctrines very few started and just kind of flattened out you know going to church church and being good and doing this and building churches and things you know well I'm not at that point I've never got that down yet I look forward every day to the things that God will make known to you and I all right let's read these Warriors of faith that we won't take time to cover we make comment upon a few few of them but go ahead with Hebrews 11 and we'll start with 17 picking up on Abraham and try to read pretty fast but I want you to see what each one of these is doing and then like the prophet said then look at what we are well all these are to give us the the thing because all of these now we'll get back to in a message eventually all of these in Hebrews 11 are warriors of the Old Testament faith it only speaks of there's only one time brother around uses it in that form it only speaks in the Statue of a perfect man that he backs up a little bit but then he comes over into the bride and the bride to be waiting but all of these are really Old Testament people you know without the new birth right come on but yet they achieved that's right and see I want you to think about it and Heaven helped me to try to get this point to you we'll cover it in a minute we tried to cover it everybody wants to build on Abraham and Abraham was a warrior of faith and never doubted and Sarah she just doubted the whole time well now I want you to show me in the Bible where Sarah doubted other than the one time that's right and you know what Abraham was doubting before she doubted I want you to show me that in the Bible that's right and I I'll tell you this when before we get into it in case I miss it in the Old Testament the name SRA is s a r a in the New Testament the word is used s a r a for SRA just in case you get into trying to to run something to do but all right listen by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac he that receiv received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence also he received him in a figure Now by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning things to come see you could you could stop on each one of these script scriptures and preach for a week or two on them taking what happens but you are supposed to by now at least have a background Foundation enough about these that are in the Bible that you've read about to be able to understand a little so we don't have to back up and just get on each one Al that would be wonderful to do see all right by faith Jacob when he was dying blessed both the sons of Joseph and were worshiped leaning upon the top of his ti so you could take each one as to why it speaks of that and see that was their positive attitude right amen you understand amen that was their positive attitude by faith Joseph when he died made mention did listen Jacob and he was dying bless the sons of Joseph and worshiping all right by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of is Israel and gave commandment concerning his bones he said don't leave him down here so you could preach all of that him going down there and coming out look by faith Moses when he was born was hid three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he come to years refused to be called a son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer Affliction with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproaches of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsook Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of the blood lest that lest he be he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the Red Sea as by dry ground see each one of these you could stop on right with the Egyptians are saying to do were drown by faith the walls of Jericho now you jump into who Joshua right walls of Jericho coming over all right by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compassed about for seven days by faith the Rahab Harlot perish not with them that believe not when she received the spies with peace and what shall I say more for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Baro and of Samson and of jeepy or how you pronounce it je of David also in Samuel and of the prophets watch who through faith subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtained promises stopped the mouths of lions quenched the violence of fire escaped the edge of the sword out of weakness were made strong wax Violet and fight turned to flight the alien the armies of the aliens women received their dead raised in life again and others were tortured not accepting Deliverance that they might obtain a better resurrection and others had trials see you could stop on each one make a sermon of each one and determine what that's speaking of all right but we're trying to get to the point and others had trial of cruel mockings and scorching yay moreover and bonds and imprisonment uh let me let me start right here and say something um I meant to say it to start with but you that are on the platform you are on internet so I would behave as on internet I sit back in the office and see some of you while brother col is reading the scriptures you're walking around you're doing things you're feeling things you're doing that's not good I thought we were supposed to respect somebody reading the Bible I thought I've seen you even walking around doing things while brother collie or brother Mark is praying now that don't not be done right right that shouldn't be done out there that's right right we should honor praying maybe that's why God's not hearing your prayers okay brother Dale get out of it go on I said I was going to do it I'll just flop it in from now on Let It Go and others had trial of cruel mockings and scourging yay more of a bonds and imprisonment they were stoned they were sown aund were tempted were slain with a sword they wandered about in sheep skins and goat skins being destitute Afflicted tormented of whom the world was not worthy they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens and and caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report now I want you to follow that and hold it especially this afternoon having obtained a good report they made a report all right and they obtained it through faith they receive not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they without us cannot be made perfect as I said we don't want to get down to that part because I want you to stay with me on thinking I think that we set our goals our standards or whatever you think about sometimes not high enough uh you know okay because honor respect as I were saying about praying and people reading the Bible and people walking around and doing things and if I was going to whip my kids I would reach over with a spoon and tap that kid while the Bible's being read or somebody's praying because that can be disrespectful all right now but the point that I want to make is we set our goal sometimes too low that's all right we set our goal sometimes too high I've been around in this message now going on to 50 years and I've watched this point that most of the people in the message today when you speak of a Rapture or a change it's just a bus pulling up or a date or a time or a season or something happening it's nothing to do with them personally it's just something they're depending upon just like uh Muhammad to get on a white horse and ride the world all right yeah and and my point is one thing if we can't recognize who we are then we don't have a position it's not for us but if we can recognize who we are and what's taking place I thought that we believe that we were the end time people you know I thought we believe that I thought We Believe The Prophet's message spoke of us but see everybody thinks it only speaks of him all right sure it speaks of him because he was the one brought the message it spoke of Paul it spoke of Peter it spoke of all of them but it spoke of all of these that we just read of Warriors of faith if any one of them had not achieved in their life the thing that God promised for them to do you and I wouldn't be here today today that's right boy no because you would be taking out part of the word that's right that's right and you can't leave out part of the word and expect it to come forth perfect that's right all right then we've got our place we got something to do it's not to go to church be good claim to believe the message read a book every day that's one wonderful but to recognize who you are you remember the Welch Revival man a police officer and the guy went over there a little cop standing there I I want to know where the Welch Revival at he said you're looking at it well when are we going to get to the place that you're looking at the word but yet we make it so big we can't attain unto it and then some make it so small till you just fall into it I don't agree with either way that's right I believe we need to find our own salvation the Bible says with fear and trembling and not just talk about Abraham and Sarah and David and the things and think we got it oh we we understand we understand more than all them other people cuz we don't know about these things these these secret things that's in the Bible where those secret things change you and I the Mysteries was preached 40 something years ago is that right is there any new Mysteries but you know what everybody wants every once in a while and I'm not throwing off on I'm just playing all right every once in a while they'll find some new tapes that they didn't know existed everybody wants them cuz there's going to be something on there there's where it's at yeah it's going to be the entire message but think about it God promised sah that she would bring forth a child yes now as I said we spent all of our time talking about the great warrior of Faith Abraham and that's good all right and there was a believing in Abraham when Sarah probably couldn't believe or didn't believe but you never see her going against Abraham okay we got some quotes where the Prophet said Lot's wife said she was out there doing this that and the other said but it's not so for sah she followed right along with Abraham everywhere he was going and even though lot went into the Great Plains of Sodom and the wonderful thing Abraham went over on the hillside and Sarah went with him you see that's what I was trying to get out way told me the other day he said Daddy you better go through that again said them people ain't understanding you he's probably out in Colorado today talking about it to understand we put the emphasis upon Abraham like Sarah had nothing and Abraham took it and give it to her finally convinced her of it oh she met God she wound up with her own private experience personal experience and became a great warrior of Faith right but we look at it like well she ain't too much of a warrior of Faith well what about the one we just read about Rahab the Harlot you know I mean can I call her a and get by with it you know I'm not supposed to but Rahab to harlot you know what she just let some guys down a rope and save their lives but is wrote in the Bible that she had a positive attitude about God in his ways and his doings that's right yes sir now I don't believe she went on being a prostitute now I never believed that cuz I'm too far and too old I don't believe that when which one of Mary Magdalene kept on doing prostitute for a living I don't think so that's right things got changed sir right but now listen there's only one verse in the Bible in the book of Hebrew Hebrews about sah you know I'm talking about that or the warrior of faith I'm talking about where that she was able to conceive seed and things we see Abraham was doubting God after even his name had been changed from Abram to Abraham he falls on his face and lifs when God says you're going to have a child and he gets up and he says Lord forgive me for lifing but would you mind just taking ishmail and letting him be the promise come on is that right it's got to be somewhere close to the time of them being turned back to a young man and a young woman because his name is changed and and then you got a basically about a year of of lapping backwards and forth there and yet he's laughing at God and God says Ishmael is not going to be the promise that it's going to come true sah he really does get Almighty life in cuz he done live with Sarah all those years and there was no children right but see he doubted oh now brother you got it wrong what have you got according to the scriptures he laughed he doubted God and actually tried to uh Finagle a away that he could get to to come through ish right but you see when God wrote of him that's what he done right right true never stop God from going on and doing the things meeting with him Chang his name turn him back to a young man and after all of that's done he wants to give his wife away when you read what he done you see a lot of doubt and problems more than actually recorded as Sarah because she only had one time she doubt it right but see we don't want to mention Sarah we want to talk about the great warrior of Faith Abraham wonderful right but see sah she hears from God also right well Abraham explained it to her well okay let's read a couple of scriptures if I don't get through I'll finish up this this evening and go on something more to El Genesis 17 brother let's read it all right so this is in the name changing period of time because Abraham Abram's been changed to Abraham but sah is still sah and she gets a sah all right God said unto Abraham as far as Sarah thy wife I shalt not call her name Sarah but but I can't never get that say right or say raw I don't know which way it goes you know you just pronounce it shall her name be I will bless her now this is when it gets on over into the situation that a lot of things has taken place and Abraham is still having problems he gets his name changed he still got problems cuz he really don't know where the child is coming from cuz God has not explained it to him so he thought it might be ishma right so God actually now said okay hold on a minute I will bless her talking about Sarah and give her a son give thee a son also of her y bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart now in his heart God reading that part not out loud we laugh at Sarah just you know we say sah snigger just a little and it says here that Abraham in his heart fell upon his face and laughed and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is 100 years old and shall sah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that ish see he's got him already in the workings my live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shalt call his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him as for Ishmael I have heard and all do but my Covenant will establish with Isaac which Sarah shall bear unto thee at this set time in the next year all right God is speaking to sah telling it's going to come through SRA now as I said we put the emphasis upon Abraham if it wasn't for Abraham s would be in trouble okay we know that cuz she got killed right all right but now we see that God's made the promise to bring it to sah so without sah Abraham can't get Isaac that's what way said you better explain that good daddy cuz they're not getting it all right we talk about without Abraham it couldn't have been done but now we look at it that without Sarah it couldn't be done now remember to Abraham it was said and to thy seed right all right now swallow all right you swallowed you got to B go up where you can listen do you know that according to the Bible are you awake listening now Sarah was more the Seed of Abraham than Isaac was that's what it said did you swallow are you listening Isaac was an offspring right Sarah wasn't an offspring Sarah was a part of Abraham oh so Sarah being a part of Abraham being in Abraham they become one I thought we believe that a husband and wife was to be one right I thought that's what we understood about the the tops and the Shadows that even though they're two different people they they become one is that scriptural we see then sah was more of the promised seed than Isaac right because without sah Isaac's not coming right yeah but I look at all the problems how about it in a minute we get down to the bride of Christ without the bride of Christ there is no way the promise can be made fulfilled in the last days that's right that's right that's right yes sir come on sah was the only way that Abraham was going to get Isaac why because God said it is that enough amen he said Sarah's going to have the child Sarah's going to have the baby Isaac Sarah was more of the promise than Isaac you so I don't really know about that now well then you don't know what a husband and wife I'm talking about a true husband and wife right a true husband and wife is the type of Christ in the church and I thought they were to be one I didn't know there was a him and a her and a third in all of this this stuff I thought a real husband and wife was the type of Christ in the church not every woman and man went down to the justice of peace or the preacher whoever those that are really one is that right in Adam was Eve taken from Adam then there had to be some other thing things take place before Abel got there Eve was part of Adam right you listen you'll get the whole story all right but see we want to look at it we only want that that s that Abraham is this and Sarah's a piece of hamburger meat or something Abraham's a go p a half steak or you said why are you bringing it out this way brother Dale there's got to be a reason my reason is one thing we're making this thing so big the people of this message has made the Rapture the change the things so high and mighty above until there no way that the human possibility of mankind could ever achieve unto it I've watched that 50 years almost now one day one day the Bible don't say that the Bible says today sir is the day of salvation for one of these days one of these days some brother in this message going to get it so what happens young guy comes along he gets the message he got a little move he's got a little pull he's going everybody runs after him don't they after while they find out he run out they run back right and I'm not against them because you know what I say I appreciate them for being that way cuz at least they got some move about them instead of the dead heads of the message that are sitting still in Lula Georgia waiting on nothing to take place I said Lula Georgia I didn't say nowhere's else I'm not preaching nowhere's else on one of these days I just don't see nothing going on we've had about four five six times the Dead's been raised we've had all forms of healings to take place among us but nobody talks about it right I think brother D you shouldn't be that way why shouldn't I be that way it's true right yeah but you're throwing off I'm not throwing off on you if you're lined up ain't no way you lined up running right I'm not talking about you right would you see people are saying though if you have the word at Lulu why not the signs and wonders and you never hear a word said about the dead being raised but you let the dead be raised right over here in this church it'll be in ever paper in this country you let the pope call back a dead person and to see if it ain't in the world news but yet we don't see things going on right what are we looking for I'm not looking for I'm looking at the promise of God I'm happy to be here and if I'm in jail tomorrow for preaching it I'll be happy to be in jail tomorrow that's no problem why because I know and realize that if you do get thrown in jail at least you stirred up a little problem right but you see we make it so big until it's unattainable we read the quote I've got it in the message to be later we read the quote where brother R says no leaven among her brings the fullness of the godhead bodily well if we can ever get rid of all of the leaven there was no when there's no leaven no leaven whatsoever no leav none wor so let sweet you know they done that you know they have that every year in their doings and that they they have a thing and they hide a little Le and the the lady has to get together and they have to hunt till they find a living and they take it out and burn it that's a ritual they go through in the Jewish Traditions finding the leaven because there no leaven to be among them you know well that's good we should sweep a house clean up do whatever this house okay amen and get rid of all the Le right but what I'd like for you to explain one thing to me and I know I'm sorry for being sarcastic IC arrogant hateful and an old dude but is it the truth the Bible speaks over in Exodus uh 12:19 I think it is it says there is to be no leaven among you for seven days and like I said they go through their house they literally sweep it clean it they have a good old spray cleaning you know that my wife the other day she got mad at me saying this but here she is going to the hospital she said we can't leave this house like this I look around and I don't see a thing wrong she said you start on that wall and you clean and I'll go here and her hurting like crazy and we clean the house we cleaned the walls she changed the beds we cleaned everything just cuz she's going the hospital and she want nobody to walk in and see it well now that was frantic for this that point what would it be if you knew that say we're going to have a certain way like the Jews had and they they literally the story is they literally somebody puts a little lean somewhere hides it all right they've got to search that house to clean it to the top to the bottom to find that leaven because that's their tradition because if they go any further it's death right it's death if you got a Le in there huh now as it said the scripture says there's no leav among them brother R said uh it's in paragraph 58 I think of the Rapture he says uh no Liv among you he said that represents seven Church ages do you know the way that God looked at Abraham he never saw his doubts and his frustrations and his problems and he never wrote of them you remember the prophets explained the obituary written by God about Abraham said no way said it said he staggered not at the promise of God never saw a thing he done well you know never saw a thing sah Done Right Sarah is the type of the church we read that in the minute right now look down through you seven Church ages I've watched this with the people of the message until it begins arrogantly hatefully sickly to me and could I make it any worse than that I don't know what would be the worst cuz everybody's always talking about the bad part right Luther's bad he wanted to kill the Jews he was a trinitarian well brother D you do too yeah but you always hear me talk about his fact of faith right now if there's no leaven among you and that represented seven Church ages then God had to be looking at the ages From a Different Light than mankind was looking at the ages or that you and I can read about it he was looking at it like he did with Abraham that he saw nothing in Abraham he saw nothing in sah he saw nothing in Rahab right you explain that one Rahab finally winds up and marries that Israeli General and out of there comes the seed of David right you explain that one but God didn't see that I thought we believed what he put in the sea of forgetfulness could never be remembered no more amen but we think as long as we can remember it he can remember it is that the guy you know standing up Lord thank you I've done this I fasted done and I'm not like that guy over there now he's all right over here right cuz he he done all those things but he not like that guy but what did that guy say just forgive me Lord who went home Justified now if there was no leav in the seven Church ages then why is there so much preaching about the wrong that was in the ages instead of the truth that was in the ages am I right could it be that the people are not seeing the way God sees right could it be that the preachers even in this message are not looking at it like brother Brandon was looking at it or that God was looking at it when he says I'll give it to you in a minute the godhead is not complete without you that's what your Prophet said say she's the fullness of the godhead bodily but you don't hear that preached what's the worst thing in the world is everybody wants you to tell wants you to speak good to them then you start trying to speak good to them to tell them about who they are and they don't want you to do that they'd rather you beat them over the toes and heads and and bodies and then they can go out the door boy that was a good message was man he beat me he told me right where I'm standing well why don't you sit down and shut up do something move amen right but no I'm the special one it can't be done without me and when I ever get it I'll tell you about it right well I wish you'd get it and tell me about it cuz I'm getting tired of being here right is that serious or is it straight but you see if God looked at the ages and put it in Exodus that there'd be no leav among the church for seven days the prophet said that would represent the seven Church ages so there's no living in the seven Church ages what Brother D says look what they done look what they that's not the bride read where it said to him him that overcometh that's in every Church age that's what I said wait said you better explain Sarah Daddy because the people are not listening without sah they would have been no Isaac without the Bride of Jesus Christ there will be no Rapture right without you there is no God yeah but my little part well I got some fingernails I sure do love you when I itch right very small they're very handy when I need them right I've never figured out yet why you got herir in your nose they say it's to filter everything but I have more trouble with that than anything but you know what they're there for a reason right they say it's your appendix you can do totally without it will God give it to you for some reason one of these days they'll come up with the idea and say wait a minute we found out all of these diseases come because people had their appendix taking out yeah but you see Church listen talking about sah brother brand him in the message called Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever he's talking about lot and how that Lot's wife lived and there Sodom but he said that's not according to sah she lived the way she wanted to are you reading it no she lived the way she wanted to she was very popular woman now he's falling back to who you can take that to go to both of them Lot's wife lived the way she wanted to Sarah lived the way she wanted to go back to with it all but look but not Sarah she was up there with her husband she was called out sealed Away by a promise that she was going to have a visitation from God a son was coming so has the sah typed church today called out of Sodom with a waiting promise of his coming son don't sound like that sah just don't amount to nothing sir as we would see Jesus just keep pulling him up be number four he's talking about Lot's wife and how she was then he says but sah was the most beautiful woman in all the world girl and she took her choice with her husband and lived that there on the poor of the land so she could serve God in the air of the promise says what a difference we want to throw off on all of the things you know what if I would have been sah I know you're going to hate me go ahead if I'd have been sah I'd have told that King hey boy we're going the other way kill that old guy and get him out of the way cuz he ain't done nothing but give me away two times and I can go with you and I own the world you're the king I'm the queen right but Sarah wouldn't that way she wasn't that kind of a woman right why because she typed the bride of Christ sah restoration of the Bride tree sah type of the Church the true church the Free Church the free woman with a free child type of the Born Again Church with the promise what about the promises to you and I sure as we would see Jesus that we're living in a day that the Gospel made many great promises for this day now now is this is those promises true and if they are true then we should live by them and if they're not true we should get away from them and find out what is true so then you ought to realize what brother Dale been pointing at for all these years is a people that would finally get down to believing who they are yes and stand on it CU if not let's get away from it let's find some who you do to follow let's get a rabbit and hat let's get something let's start the victory march I thought about that I thought I love these kids and I them kids they come walking down to here they the little ones be singing this after you know what I want to come down yeah will I'm still as a kid I i' love this said why because they're kids and we just all kids but think about it if it's not true let's get away from it I've never said anything about anybody leaving this church it's up to you right that's your choice I've never said anything about you coming that's your choice right all right the presence of God unrecognized so many things look in this days what he said would take place look at the promises that he made would take place this day and then examine it of what is going on and see where we're at then you see where he is still in his word or not they wanted to see the sign of Moses the sign of David that was not their age it was promised for moses' age and them age the promise for this age has to come to pass he had clearly showed them he by the scripture invited them to search the scripture to see what day they were living in he doing the same thing right now search for scripture you who believe the Bible what is supposed to take place right here before his coming all right Feast of the trumpets remember God is the word and each age has lotted the word for that a for each age that would be on earth he lotted it in the church age and the Seven Seals revealed every bit of it promises for you and I God's only provided place of worship no leaven among you that brings the entire fullness of the godhead bodily among you now see we like to read the rest of that in a in a negative form couldn't do it in the days of Luther age do it in Luther's age couldn't do it in Wesley age couldn't do it in Pentecostal age that's right but does that mean they wouldn't part of it I want to read one in just a minute cuz you know the quote where brother R says that God isn't complete without you well you know God isn't complete without Luther you know God isn't complete without Wesley you know God isn't complete without a zeusa street Pentecostal people that really had to genuine but we only want to make see that's what I said we make it too much this way are we it can't be attainable no leaven now remember my point so evidently God must be looking down at the ages not as we think he looks we want to take the seven Church age blind wretched miserable and naked you know it not but we don't see the first he says the beginning of the creation of God we don't see the promise of the Overcomer in this age as to inherit every Overcomer age before them we only want to look at the negative Wy Wy W if I could just see something take place I would believe it you lying hypocrite is that the best way I can say it but you see we're looking at things the way we want to look at it instead of the way God wants to look at God said there's no leing among the seven Church ages well he sure must be looking at the good side not the bad that's right right he surely had to be looking at Abraham the good side not the bad Sarah and the good side Rahab the Harlot the good side the David the lion sticking Rascal that was a m murer but he was a man after God's Own Heart yet we want to make it so perfect until it's unattainable I have no problems with seeing your problems the problems I have is when you won't do anything about your problems and you keep leaning back on your problems as a crutch you could at least say help me to get rid of this am I've never expected to find a church that everything would be perfect everybody would be just perfect just everything sitting just perfect and every move and I say Bri and everybody say hey man I told you about the time I was listening to a certain brother and he would say a few words and they'd be rejoicing well that's fine but then he'd say you may be seated now must have been a lot of people come in you know well in a minute he' say something they get rejoicing then he'd say you may be seated now well about six or eight times after he said that you know I finally figured it out that wasn't people coming in that's people jumping up about what he said I've never seen any of you jump up about what it said it was a surprise the other day when we were singing and the spirit of the Lord came in and two sisters stood up right over here that surprised me I don't expect to see a perfect church that there's no problems and heartaches and troubles that would be contrary to the scripture but I do expect to see a church that when God looks down he looks at the atonement and he doesn't see our false and failures and in his eyes we're perfect sir but never in the eyes of the people will we be perfect why can't we believe what he says about us look what he says on what was the Holy Ghost given for 1959 God's purpose we find here is sending the Holy Spirit was one purpose that God himself might dwell in his church and continue his plans through the church that God was in Christ continuing his plans through Christ out of Christ into the church continuing his work through the church drop down all that God was he poured into Christ because he emptied himself say it like this all that God was he's emptied he he poured it into Christ Christ was the fullness of the godhead bodily all that Jehovah was he poured into Christ and all that Christ was he poured into the church not into one individual brother random wasn't the fullness of the godhead bodily brother Dale's not the fullness of the godhead bod and you are not either I don't care who you are and what you think cuz this is what the the prophet said not into one individual but into the entire body right what about the next one lean not to your own understanding you know I've read this a lot to you I love it and the only way you can be a Son of God or a daughter of God you had to be a part of God and God isn't complete without you he has to be that's right because there's only one source of eternal life right look at the last one Mighty God unveil it was God in Christ God in man fullness of the godhead bodily in a man God in a man now it's God in men the fullness of the godhead fullness of God in the godhead bodily in his entire church manifesting himself fulfilling his word so we want to get away from Downing sah and start thinking about sah represents the bride she's my representation and get away from looking at our own faults and failures now here's where we got to say it plain he said well brother Dale I know I got faults and failures and I can't help it you just lied you just lied that's right yes sir I mean you're smoking and you can't quit just don't put one in your mouth yeah but I can't stand it all the well get rid of them demons is that right but you see we're wanting some rabbit in a hat trick to carry us out of here when we've had all these years of the word being revealed to us to try to get us to a place that we could believe who we are and what we're doing here was that what he said he said when the bride realizes who she is and what she's here for she'll be an invisable army yes sir amen Satan won't be able to handle her you see even job in all of his d and God called him a just and upright man yet when elue came to him which was a Christ he told job he said the only thing I see paraphrasing putting it together with what brother BR said he said job got just a little bit too exalted in his own self that's paraphrasing it he said that was really the only thing could be found wrong with job did he got just a little bit too righteous in his his own self see instead of depending upon the offering to make him righteous he was dependent upon not doing it made him righteous that won't work you're better off to go on and do it and then plead the blood people don't like that right cuz you say brother Dale okay and for you to go do it I did not say that you just lied I said it would be better to do it you know what brother rown said about polygamy he said America would be better off if they believed in it do you need that quote may be a paraphrase but it's our was he okay in prostitutions was he okay in polygamy and things no he was just telling it like it is we don't agree with these foreign countries oh we think the women over in in Iraq and this that or the other ought to be freed then you free them and make a bunch of prostitutes out of them yeah what would we be if brother Brown said where would it be if the women had to take a mergency test before they got married he said they do that in Africa I wonder how many weddings would be but you see church if we keep looking down on our own selves and looking down on everybody else we're not going to get nowhere you come and tell me and you know it's true a lot of you and said brother Dale I've had this problem I had this problem I said okay let's pray and get rid of that problem I don't come to the pull pit and explain it I'm not going to tell you who it is but a sister come to me and she's brownhead and wa so much but I'm not telling you her name no somebody tells you something and tells you not to tell it it's supposed to be kept a secret but of course we've got the good idea what if you tell the other you tell it somebody tells you and you say well okay it's a secret and you go out and tell them said now now brother collie won't tell you something but you don't tell nobody else if you do you tell them it's a secret Facebook I hate your Facebooks it has been proven over and over divorces and everything in the world is happening because of Facebook and yet you still read the garbage you know why because your mind wants to read garbage I mean me talking to somebody on a Facebook and they say I've got to go to the bathroom well I'd say put it on the world they got to go to the bathroom you know why Facebook and stuff are working cuz you're not looking at nobody I don't care if you're looking at a picture or whatever you're looking you're still concealed in the point but you can say what you want to because you're not looking eye to eye with the other person so you're not condemned you right here you got your Facebooks you know one thing for certain brother Dale's against it because you get on there and you talk and you know My Philosophy if you on the phone over 5 minutes you're gossiping if you're on Facebook over two seconds you are right come on you get on the computer you get on the things like that and you're looking at all that junk why well I want to know what so and shows do it you now you're just in a good old gossiper is brother who was it brother uh Jack Co it said that lady said I want to lay my tongue on the alar he said lady this this is just 14t across this platform so ain't enough room say that today and where are you right but do you see what I'm talking about God never looked down and saw Abraham's problems but he never saw sra's problems that's right he never saw the church ages in their problems Luther yes was a trinitarian yes Luther said the Jews ought to be took out and be killed because of Killing Jesus Christ they a lot of problems but you don't never hear the the point that that message he brought was so vital until it attacked the whole world of the just shall live by faith and you and I today are standing on what Luther taught if we are a Christian God don't see our faults and failures well then I can just go do what I want to I do what I want to to that's right right I do want to Sarah done what she wanted to did we read that she set up there with Abraham when she could have been down there you know right she could have stayed with two kings she had a double two kings but instead she went off with her lying husband who wanting to give her away but God don't write that in the New Testament he don't write about her problems he don't write about his problems he don't write about our problems he writes about who we are and what he hath made us and not we ourselves we are his people the Sheep of his Pastor right come on musicians let's stand think on these things if we keep looking at our faults and failures we'll never get nowhere but now if we keep making faults and failures we're not going to get anywhere come on so don't be R wishy washy and floppy floppy well brother Dale said it's all right for me to go do this I didn't say that you sin a sin as a Christian what did the prophet say do you need to quote he said you sin a sin as a Christian you'll reap a tub fool you go out here boys and get some little girl pregnant you got a baby to deal with the rest of your life right you'll live with that right you Reaper t for what we got brother 170 170 in spiral I'm sorry that I can't preach like these other brothers can to make you feel good and happy I make you feel bad but when we get over there you'll say thank you for telling me like it is God don't see our faults and fails he have to kill us that's why we got to have an advocate we got to have a comforter we will do wrong did the prophet said we don't really do wrong he said we make mistakes good way of saying it right cuz you don't want to do that but you make a mistake of letting Satan deal with where could I go to the Lord ntion are i l him everyone we get along sweet when man above where could I go to the Lord if you don't plan on being here this evening I would ask you to please listen to the message if you don't plan on being here this evening I would ask you to please a to he said well I already know what you going to say it might be surprising I would listen
