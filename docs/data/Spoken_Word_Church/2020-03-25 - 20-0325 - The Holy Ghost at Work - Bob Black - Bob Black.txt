========================================

relax brother Bob comes to minister the word of the Lord unto us and pray that God would open her eyes of our understanding that's the main thing right let's just sing that open the eyes of my heart Lord open the eyes of my [Music] services now Sunday will stay like it is until we tell you a change [Music] and we sing [Music] holy holy Oh [Music] to see amen I saw a desire to not greet you in the name of the Lord all the ones that are at home and the ones that are here it's a small little group but you know I was thinking I just to quote mr. Rogers he said he said his mama used to tell him when emergencies and things would happen bad things would happened and you could look around and see all the you see all the people helping out and I see all the helpers kind of and you know when bad bad things kind of come on the scene it really exposes a lot of good in people you can see we think about how all the things we've got to be thankful look for tonight we've got all these all these nurses here that our sister Sarah and and I'm forgetting somebody's sister Ruth and all the different ones that are Amy that's right that are that are working hard and and then and then this group here that's come together and we thank brother Dale and brother way for you know opening up the church so that we could keep keep this going so we're just so grateful you know I was thinking coming up the road tonight what we're serving the great Shepherd and and he's the Bible says he's the door of the sheepfold and if he's the door that means nothing can come in and get the Sheep unless the Shepherd allows it unless you kind of test aside for a little bit just kind of train us up or get us get us home down I believe it's honing down time art our faith is being hold up a little bit sometimes it takes a little bit of pressure and things to to kind of see what we're made of but I believe this it's time so listen tonight I'm gonna read from Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 and just just a real just one verse really and they will go into the message let's just go to the Lord in prayer well God we're so grateful to you tonight Lord a bit to be able to gather together around your word Lord and and we know your your bride is not really even located in one particular place but spread all around the world and tonight Lord we're spread amongst all our different homes and but we're come we're gathering together just the same around your word Lord and as we all gather together around your word where the carcasses the Eagles will be gather together as the scripture says Lord I pray Lord that you will open the eyes of our understanding and help us to Lord to be encouraged tonight and to be edified and that something will be said to strengthen your little bride and to give faith to her we ask Lord Jesus that you'll be with us tonight not just in this building but in all the little homes that are separated all tonight Lord because of the conditions and things that you'll be a neat little home Lord a little lick of fire everywhere Lord we ask Lord Jesus these things in your name amen so Philippians chapter 1 verse 6 says being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ you may be seated the Lord is blessing to the reading of the word now tonight I want to take maybe a kind of a strange topic I just want to talk about the Holy Ghost at work and and this is not gonna be a really deep lesson or anything I just want to kind of take a look at at the change that the Holy Ghost will wrought in the lives of the disciples you'll have to change that the Holy Ghost has wrought in the lives of us and the thing that the things that the Holy Ghost is doing us in us to identify us with the were doing encourage us and help us and when I'm talking about the Holy Ghost the Holy Spirit I'm talking about the that that thing that in sundry times in divers manners spoke to the Father see the prophets that thing that in the in the Old Testament it said the spirit moved over the waters and and out from the earth came forth all those seeds that were lying there that sprouted up that that spirit that was in Jesus Christ and when that spirit came back in that in that dead body that was laying in the tomb that spirit rose up that body and caused him to come forth from the tomb that spirit that the Bible says if that same spirit is in you it will quicken your mortal body just the same way is that quicken Jesus as dead body laying there at a tomb with that that spirit will quicken your body so you see the Holy Ghost is it worked many times that look at my scene because of circumstances and things you get down in life and it looks like the Holy Ghost is still not moving that God is still not with you the Bible says he was is a present help in time of need he is all he'll never leave you or forsake you the Holy Ghost is the thing that brings the word to life it's the thing that will bring bringing that dead letter to life off of the page of the Bible it living living inside of you you see the Bible says that if you if you can just open up your heart to let that spirit in to quicken the word that you've heard then that that puts God Himself inside of you that's what that spirit will produce let's see let's read that first the first quote in Jesus Christ the same yesterday today in forever he said if the Christian Church is the vine or the branch that's in Christ they'll do the works of Christ and bear the life of Christ by their fruits you shall know them now then the way that he is today he's here in the form of the holy spirit working through his church performing the same things that he did there that makes him the same yesterday today and forever his life the life that was in Christ which was God produced the kind of a life that he lived in that same life comes into his churches his church members since they have been purged by the blood and given the Holy Spirit access to work through them bears the same fruit that he bore so therefore the world can see then that Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so there we kind of start off with the identification of the characteristics of the holy spirit the holy spirit and you would produce that same life that was in Jesus Christ and I believe tonight that we should be looking for that in our lives we should be looking for the for the impossible we should be looking for the miraculous because when you become when you become expecting to see God move on the scene than you you will see miracles you will see signs and wonders follow the Bible says the son and waters would follow them to believe why because the holy spirit within them is the one that is producing the effect of them believing the Holy Spirit in you is the one that agrees with the word it's the one that is doing the thing it is the one that per foot is performing his word you see what as we kind of get into the lesson tonight the the Holy Spirit had an effect on the lives of the disciples when it fell on them at the day of Pentecost it changed their whole makeup it changed their whole attitude and it began to produce in them the life of Christ and what happened on the day of Pentecost was it made them witnesses of of an experience it made them witnesses that something had happened to them they could go forth and tell us as Peter went down downstairs from the upper room he wouldn't begin to proclaim what had happened to him that this is that and he identified it with the scripture he was a witness and when when the Holy Spirit begins to do something in your life it makes you a witness that you know that something has happened you know that the Holy Spirit has come upon you and filled you with us with his power and changed you and taking you from out of the world and change you to make you like Jesus Christ the book of Acts it says in chapter 1 verse 6 it says when they were therefore come together they asked of him saying Lord wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father had put in his own power but ye shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth you're going to be a witness in other words a witness a witness means to have a knowledge of an event or a change from personal observation or experience you were there when it happened and and along and along it along through your through your Christian journey you're gonna be a witness of all the things that have happened to you at the time that you got sick for the time that you lost your job at the time that everybody around you has fallen sick - a plague but whatever it might be and you can look back and say I was a witness that God was on the scene he came down when he didn't leave me alone he didn't leave me helpless and Deuteronomy chapter 31 6 it says be strong and of a good courage fear not nor be afraid of him or of all the enemy that in the land that they were coming to for the Lord thy God he it is said doeth that does go with thee he will not fail thee nor forsake you and that's the scripture that Paul quoted in Hebrews when he said the Bible says that I will never leave you look forsake you he is a present help he is a God that's what the Holy Spirit does in your life if you'll just yield yourself to him and let him come in and work with you and move in your life he will be there they take care of your problems he'll be there to handle the things that you can't do within yourself because what it what it does is it makes you a witness that God is able that God is faithful that God is present he's a present help that God is working the Holy Spirit is working on the scene he's moving you're a witness that you're not afraid to take the witness stand because you know what you've seen and what you've experienced that's what Jesus told Nicodemus he said you must be born again the born again his experience is something you could try to explain and you can try to tell somebody but it's something that you can only know if you have experienced it for yourself you must be born again and I encourage you implore you in this hour this hour is more than ever you should be looking upon the things that are happening and realizing that you need to run to the cross that you need to run to the altar and seek deliver a pit for the hours at hand I believe I believe that now is the time now is the manifestation time and the end time avenge ilysm brother Branham says in 1962 he said now today we try to take the written word we have in letter form creed form and so forth to all the world and there's been missionaries going everywhere but what do we find when we get there a native that can't read his name holding a tract in his hand he knows no more about it that he does which is which is right and left hand but when jesus said go and preach the gospel he never said teach the word I don't believe he's meaning that we don't need teachers what he's made it is we don't need a laying out of it to replace going into the Holy of Holies for yourself if you look to somebody else to give you an explanation that that bypasses you going for your own personal experience you going through justification sanctification baptism and Holy Ghost going into the Holy of Holies where you look God in the face and you know for your own self that God is real that's the kind of teaching that we don't need he said never said teach the word he said preach the gospel and the gospel came not in word only but through the manifestation of the word for the only way that it could be done was to make his promise come to pass and I believe that's what the preacher of the gospel does did I did push the Holy Ghost into action because when the word goes forth and you sit there and you open yourself up to it and you say that it's got to be the truth that God begins to effect a change in your life someone God can read like that in William Jennings Bryan when he was debating with Derek Darrell on the door ethics of Darwin see he could only say what Darwin had said William Jennings Bryan could see what the Bible had said that was the debate but in this case God comes along the people and proves that his word is made manifest and the only way you can do that is not by track but by the Holy Spirit working through you your life becomes his life he's in you do you realize that's the kind of change that the Holy Spirit makes the Holy Spirit makes the Word of God manifested in your life so much that you become the proof of the scripture your life is the proof that the word is true because God is making that word that you have read come to life it is living in you a living voice a live device to living out in you thundering out you say well how do I get healed Paul the Gospel of Mark says and he said unto them go you into all the world and preach the gospel to every creature he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved but he that believeth not shall be damned and these signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils they shall speak with new tongues they shall take up serpents and if they drink any deadly thing it shall not hurt them thank you lay hands on the sick and they shall recover in other words this is not a dead religion that we're following this is a living manifestation of the power of God the power of God is still in this church because the Holy Ghost is still working the Holy Ghost is still affects you all these people it makes you a witness because you have lived some through something in John chapter 4 verse 23 23 Jesus was talking to the woman at the whale and he said the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship in spirit and truth and as he began to speak to her about those things something quickening her not to take her to a new birth experience because Jesus had not died yet but she began to she began to realize who it was that was talking to her in the spirit began to work in our life and she began she ran into the city to be a witness to tell who she had talked to in 1st Kings chapter 17 13 to 14 that says it Elijah said to her fear not go and do as thou has said but make me thereof a little kick first and bring it unto me and after make for thee and for thy son for thus saith the Lord God of Israel the barrel of meal shall not waste neither shall the cruse have all failed until the day that the Lord send us rain upon the earth and that little woman became a witness that she obeyed the word of the prophet that God kept her through perilous times because she was a witness that God did not depart her in the time of trouble in the time of need she was a witness you see what the Holy Ghost does is it transformed it transforms people that are powers into its a from powerless prayerless doubting and faltering witnesses of Christ to bold and effective service in his kingdom the power the power of the Holy Ghost is to transform you the Spirit of the Lord is changing us the 2nd Corinthians chapter 3 it says now the Lord is that spirit and where the Spirit of the Lord is there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory from glory to glory even as by the Spirit of the law in other words you're looking into the mirror of God's Word and you see it a little bit like it's looking through a foggy glass but as you as you keep walking the Spirit of the Lord is changing you to match up that match you up with that image that you see in the word the Spirit is changing you by because the one that started that work is going to finish it if God starts this work in you he's going to see you all the way through he's not gonna leave his work halfway finished he's not gonna abandon you halfway through the Potteries working on you and he's gonna what he's gonna mold you into a finished work he started on you and he's going to see you all the way through it Romans chapter 8 verse 30 and 31 says moreover whom he did Preston ate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified what shall we then say to these things if God could be for us who can be against us you know what I believe that saying is that God is on your side if he's justified your soul by the new birth if he's filled you with His goodness he is going to see you through and do you realize the power and faith and believing and knowing that God is on your side God is with you as you walk through the valley of the shadow of death God is with you the cause you did not fear no evil God is with you he's walking it he's walking with you he's carrying you through all these troubles and when their eyes were open they knew when brother Bram said and I think that today we've had much preaching many fine ministers able ministers that has brought us the word your pastors and evangelists are so forth that comes through the city but I think the main thing that I'm trying to bring to you is the reality of the presence of Christ that you might see him and know that it's him by his identified promise for the day you know I believe that's what the message was set for that I believe that's what the preacher in the world is sent for the preaching of the gospel is said - I did - to you that God is here he's a present health he's not a god of history raising God out of history he's here with you working and changing and molding you if you'll let him because God is on your side God is still on the scene he's still real he's still saving and he's still healing and the Holy Ghost is still working tonight I want to witness what the Holy Ghost is doing the Holy Ghost is overcoming the things of this world so let's listen I just kind of kind of take a few moments to look at the lives of the disciples before and after they were transformed by the Holy Ghost following on the day of Pentecost and look at the change that was wrought on them you could identify your your own life with those Scripture by by looking at the things that happened to them and you can look back and say that happened to me too I believe tonight I believe that'll encourage you and strengthen you and Luke chapter 22 verses 31 to 33 this says and the Lord said Simon Simon behold Satan hath desired to have you that he may sift you as wheat but I have prayed for thee that thy faith fail not and when thou art converted strengthen thy brethren because you see before he was converted he was not evil able to be any kind of use to his brethren how could he strengthen him how could he give encouraging words how could he help anybody without that love of God than on the inside inside to love somebody even if they would smite him on the cheap to love somebody even if they're wrong to love people in the church even even when they don't treat you the way that you think that you should be treated but after the Holy Ghost fail let's read what happened to the disciples in in Acts chapter 2 verse 44 to 47 it said all that believed were together and had all things common what why did they have all things common because the word that they had had been quickened and now they didn't care for themselves more than others now they cared for the whole body of Christ that wanted good for one another they were all joined together in one Accord and I wouldn't declare to you tonight being in one Accord does not come by just trying to manufacture something but being in one Accord comes by the revealing of God's word as you eat the word you become the word and that will bring you more into one Accord there might be some like law that'll go away from Abraham but hey this little small group is going to get hold more more together until war like that little group in the upper room all in one Accord all believing the word of the hour all believing and waiting for the word for the spirit to come and quicken that word that we've held and sold their possessions and good and part a part of them to all men as every man had need and they continuing daily with one Accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house did eat their meat with gladness and singleness of heart praising God and having favor with all the people and the Lord added to the church daily such as be saved I believe that tonight that same Holy Spirit can work that same kind of effect in the people of God I believe it is working that same kind of effect I believe that's why you see the Church of the Living God coming together and ours like this work what might be closing doors but yet there's something down on the inside of your ordinances I'm still gonna I'm still gonna gather together whether it's in my home whether it's a little small group in the church like we are here tonight because there's something in me that's desiring for the world to see God's word for feeling something inside of me that's pressurized that's push that I push it out in Matthew chapter 20 verse 21 he said he said unto her what wilt thou she say honey I'm grant that these my two sons and sons of Zebedee may sit the one on that right hand and the other on the left and thy kingdom and then also in Luke chapter 9 verse 46 to 48 then there arose of reasoning among them which of them should be the greatest and Jesus perceiving Jesus perceiving the thought of their heart took a child and set him by him and said unto them wheresoever shall receipt whosoever shall receive this child in my name receiveth me and whosoever shall receive me and receiveth him that sent me for he that is least among you all the same shall be great and you could see that before this change was rolled every one of them that wanted to be they were constantly bickering and fighting who among them would be the great and Jim then Jesus laid it down if you want to be great be the least something something changed after the new birth after the new birth they began to one another after the new birth they began to do for one another after the new birth they began to love one another in a way that could not be expressed before the Spirit of God fell him then at the day of Pentecost you see even in John chapter 18 verse 10 and 11 it said they were Peter Peter did not know how to react to somebody that disagreed with him he pulled his sword out and he whacked the air off of malice the high priests servant but in Acts chapter 5 verse 41 it says they departed from the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer shame for his name they went from trying to hack one another with a sword to rejoicing that they would that somebody would would rebuke him openly that somebody would would ridicule them and revile them and with them and beat them in the street the Holy Ghost is changing you the Holy Ghost will change you if you let him well you know what one example I believe in the in the Old Testament there kind of talks is a type of this kind of change is when Jacob he was ready to cross over to meet his brother Esau and that night he was scared to meet Esau because he there's a there's a before and afters to this story here before before he met the angel of the Lord he was afraid to go mean Esau and brother branham breaks it down and he says he says Jacob was afraid because to go talk to Esau because he knew of the way that he had treated him he all these things in other words all his past began to come up he was afraid because of all his sins were coming up before him he was afraid to go mean Esau I wondered tonight many listening in tonight if you might be afraid to meet he saw you might be afraid to go meet all the things that you've done in your past life the way that you've treated others your past sins or you're lying or your thievery or your back talking or your evil ways the way that you treated your mom and daddy or the way that you treated your children all these things afraid afraid to meet Esau but you know Jacob did something that I believe many maybe tended to take witness oven and learn from it and he got serious with God and he began to and not that night he met God came down and he wrestled with the angel of the Lord the Bible says he was yeah you know I believe I believe that wrestling with the angel of the Lord is when you you read something you read the promise of God in his word and you say that promise is for me and I'm not going to take no for an answer you know many times God will God will tell you know and and you need to just kind of accept that but when you read in the word and says you're healing us for you salvation is for you the promise of the Holy Ghost is for you and you think that you're being told no you just stay right there and you wrestle it out until you until you're walking different like by the way was preaching on until that that sign even the hip is touched so that you walk different so that the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost changed your life and I believe I believe there's something that that same kind of change that was wrought in Jacob's life can be wrought in the believers life now what Jacob was not afraid to go meet Esau he rose up and with gladness went to meet he saw on the next day brother Branham said in US as I thought on my ways he said there might be meaning here tonight it's thinking about going home old age is catching up with you sicknesses got you in a grip better think on your ways before you get there in my in that timely and as Jacob on his way with his wife and his children here at a message coming that I saw he saw where the great army was coming to meet him and he began to think on his ways the way he had done Esau cheated him and it drove him to prayer all night long he arrested with the angel of the Lord went it let's go down to verse 40 when the angel of the Lord touched Jacob he walked different from then on he was a big fine runnin coward on one side but a limping limping prince on the other side of the brook you walk different and you think different he wasn't afraid to meet uh Esau then because he had wrestled with the angel think on your way he had wrestled it out with him saying you promised it I want my blessing and he stayed there until God blessed him and then he wasn't afraid anymore let's go to Luke chapter 9 verse pretty 141 here's another example of believers of the the disciples not knowing how to react to those that did not did not believe the message that that they were preaching and it came to pass when the time was come that he should be received up he steadfastly set his face to go to Jerusalem and sent messengers before his face and they went and entered into a village of the Samaritans to make ready for him and they did not receive him because his face was as though he would go to Jerusalem and when his disciples James and John saw this they said Lord wilt thou that we command fire to come down from heaven and consume them even as Elias did but he turned and rebuked them and said you know not matter of spirit you are if they could think I mean it made me look back in your own life or the lives of others that you've been acquitted with and how quick we are sometimes they want to rain down fire on people that don't believe the same way do we do for the Son of Man is but Jesus said for the Son of man has not come to destroy men's lives but to save him and they went to another village you know these are the the sons of Zebedee Jesus called them the sons of thunder because they were like this they were there already just boom just get right get right to it but you know one of these sons of thunder one of these sons of zebedee was John and went to the Isle of Patmos and you know his his life was changed by the Holy Spirit as he went through his journey until what by the time you know by the time he he got off the Isle of Patmos the story goes that he went to Pastor the church at Ephesus and they said Oh later on in his life they would bring him kind of carry him in and he would lay there on his cot or how in his chair or ivory was position and he would tell everybody little little children just love one another just just love one another because you see that man that had once desire to call down fire from heaven all the people that disagreed with him now the Holy Spirit had changed his life to where he loved that's that's the kind of change that the Holy Ghost will rock or will will will affect in your life the 1st John chapter 4 613 he says we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error listen he's telling you how to have discernment beloved let us love one another for love is of God and every one that loveth is born of God and knoweth god he that loveth not knoweth not God for god is love and this was manifested the love of God toward us because that God sent His only begotten Son into the world that we might live through him herein is love not that we loved God but that he loved us and had sent his son to be the propitiation for our sins beloved if God so loved us we ought also to love one another no man I've seen God at any time if we love one another god dwelleth in US and his love is perfected in us there's some other quote I got here about Esau and everything that's going to skip over there but listen because you see what the Holy Spirit did in the lives of those believers had conquered their natural the natural way of the flesh that when on the day of Pentecost when they were filled with the Holy Ghost it began to conquer them so that it took out all of that anger and enmity and all of that strife it took it out and changed them and transform them and I say these things that I to declare to you that God is transforming you now if you'll just be cognizant of what is going on in your life to realize that your ain't the same as you used to be to realize that God has taken you he's taking you through a journey and you're different than how you used to be brother Brown said in faith is our victory said faith is a conqueror faith is an overcomer it just isn't a peacemaker it overcomes faith is the victory that overcomes the world what does it do what is faith what is the Conqueror conquer and victory is the same to conquer it means to beat down to override to handcuff to throw into prisons it means that the sin that once ruled you you rule it now it means that you have overcome it you are you've whipped it you're greater than it is oh I feel religious right now which was first a sinner or savior a savior for a savior is more powerful than a sin that's how powerful the Holy Ghost is in the heart of a believer that's given over to it the Holy Ghost can conquer all that ails you they can conquer that temper it can conquer that bad attitude they can conquer that enmity at home with our husband or wife that our fuel at feuding and fighting with one another it can conquer a home where whether children are at enmity with the parents because the Holy Ghost is love and love is the thing that will cast out Devils you know brother Branham said you can cast out Devils more easily by giving your own waffle or roses and putting on an apron and washing the dishes and and all these in other words by showing love not not necessarily by laying on your hands and causing the great big commotion and casting out the devil like that love is the thing that will cast out the devil because love is the thing that will conquer all faith is the Conqueror faith and love is what God write what war effect in your life by the Holy Ghost and you see that spring spirit is guiding you to the word you see you see one of the effects of the Holy Ghost is it God it takes you it leads you to the word it's changing you it's changing your attitude and it's causing you to to desire the word more than the things of this world and that's one of the effects one of the examples in other disciples is before the Holy Ghost failed they could not bear the truth they could not bear that they could not receive all of the true they could not it was too much for them that's what Jesus said in John chapter 16 verse 12 he said I have yet many things to say unto you but you cannot bear them now howbeit when he the Spirit of Truth has come he will guide you into all truth for he shall not speak of himself but whatsoever he shall hear that shall he speak and he will show you things to come he shall not speak of himself that's the way a lot of people want they want to just kind of go sit under a tree or sit in their home and not come to church and not read the Bible and just have the Holy Ghost tell lay it all out for him but he says he whatsoever he shall hear in other words whatever what word you bring it whatever word that when you're sitting in the congregation and you hear the word what he hears what the Holy Ghost hears when you bring it when you receive it that's what he's going to speak back to you because the Holy Ghost in you and speaking back the word that's speaking about the true interpretation of the word that you hear when you go to church when you press play at your home when you're riding in your car listening to the word he's speaking not of himself but he's speaking what he's hearing what the Holy Ghost in you is hearing receiving he speaks it back the correct interpretation and that's why when you get the Holy Ghost now you've got the true interpreter of the word of you where you can receive the word you can receive the deep teaching of the word and that's why John at first John chapter five he said he said we know he began to speak of the assurance of understanding by the new birth the things that we know now we have understanding he said we know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not but he that has begotten of God keepeth himself and that wicked one toucheth him not and we know that we are of God in the whole world lieth in wickedness and listen I wanted to clear to you tonight that if you are not this kind of a certain maybe it's time to do like Jacob but get to wrestling with the angel a little bit and find out where you stand because I believe especially in this hour we need to be at a place where we know that we are of God and he said and we know that the Son of God has come and has given us an understanding giving us what an understanding you understand the word because that one that gave the root the word is inside of you and he's speaking what he hears he's speaking the true interpretation of the word that we may know him that is true and we are in him that is true even in his son Jesus Christ this is a true God and eternal life what does the Holy Ghost do it calls you out of confusion it calls you out of Babylon it calls you you know Babylon goes back all the way to the Tower of Babel but Babel means confusion Babel became babble on and babble on became the Roman Catholic Church in the Roman Catholic Church had daughters and all it was was a bunch of confusion but we've been called out of confusion to a perfect understanding of who Jesus Christ is a perfect understanding of who he is in this hour we know I believe just the same as John knew because we've heard the same message that John was preaching back then the same troops that we've that he was preaching but ever and said how be it when he the spirit of truth is come he was talking acquitting the scripture he will guide you into all truth he said the evidence would be that you would be in the truth you would be in the Word of God for your age evidence has to do with receiving that word that is the evidence the evidence of the new birth is that you can receive that word the evidence is that you agree with that word the evidence says that you understand the word you know the word you understand the word and you agree with the word why you do you know when you get the new birth with God because even before you get the new birth I was talking to Zack the other day about how when he was a 10 years old the Holy Spirit was moving in his life and but but even when you're young you you might resist a little bit but it's the Holy Spirit guiding you and moving you and taking you go over here step over into this little missionary Automation Church off to the side of the road going in this place listen to what these people have to say it's the Holy Spirit leading you and guiding you to all truth and when you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost he will continue to lead and guide you he's a god you got just as much of God as those Shepherds did when they when that angel appeared to him and said he's get the one that you're looking for has been born in Bethlehem go and yet they told him exactly down this the angel told the Shepherd's you're gonna find him in a manger go to Bethlehem go to the manger and this is where you're gonna find him and you know that you do know God leads you just like that you might not realize it but if you can look back in your life and find out you went from the over here to over there but God was holding you down keeping you in line with his guiding you and keeping you listen listen church tonight what what do we had to be afraid of because God is on our side God is with us he's moving us he's moving us to line up right with his word he's taking care of his word he's taking care of his people John chapter 14 and verse 25 it says jesus answered them I told you and you believe not the works that I do in my father's name they bear witness of you meld me but you believe not because you're not of my sheep as I said under you my sheep hear my voice and I know them and they follow me and I give unto them eternal life and they shall never perish neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand another word that voice is the thing that is leading you that voice the sheep will follow the voice do you know that Lazarus was one of his sheep and when Lazarus was down in the grave he heard that voice and the voice called him up from the grave and because he was one of the shepherd sheep he had to follow that voice that voice is so powerful to the sheep that you gotta you've got to follow it because the Shepherd is living only on the inside of you and he's he's causing you to follow you can't help but follow you the Holy Ghost is a God to bring back to your remembrance the things that have been spoken to to reveal these the Holy Ghost is it's a God to see what was in the heart of the Prophet to have an understanding of these mysterious things that he talked about the shout the voice in the Trump and the threefold mystery on the day of seventy weeks in the seven thunders and the seven seals and how it all ties in with a statute of a perfect man listen we've not heard just man's ideas but we've heard a voice that has brought us from captivity to Liberty to the great Liberty and love divine to understand the mind of Christ to see where he was placing things in the Bible that voice is the thing that guides you and eliminates confusion brother brems said in what was the Holy Ghost given for and that's a good message to listen to he said if you've got it and are guilty of these I wonder what's the leading you God will never lead you off the word he'll keep you with the word because that's God's own laws of his church for his people for women and for men what you say it don't harm me to do this or that it doesn't you see what he's saying there you say you've got the baptism and Holy Ghost and yet you're saying that you don't have to stay lined up with the word that you can get off the word the Holy Ghost in you will make you want to get lined up with a word it will make you want to get as far away from the world as you can just stay right lined up with it he said it doesn't the word says it does and if the Holy Spirit is in you it'll lead you right to the word there'll be no excuses God don't make alterations or excuses he makes the mark and you tell it my my oh I wonder how many of that would hit tonight think meditating on that he makes the marking you told but yet we want to make excuses so many times I wonder if the church doors were open how many would be hit or not if the situation was a little bit different because we make excuses for the excuses for not following the Word of God excuses for not doing what the word says excuses for not believing the word excuses for not for not I wonder if there's still a lot of the world and many of us where we want what's what's right for us more than the things of God where we want we where we want what our way more than God's Way but if God is leading you to the truth we'll lay down our own idea that our own thoughts and lay down everything and say do like Jacob did and say Lord I want your promises give it to me whatever it takes I'm willing to die right here in Matthew chapter 26 jesus saith unto them all ye shall be offended if because of me this night for it is written I will smite the Shepherd because it look another thing before the Holy Ghost before the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost the disciples had no constancy had no no no foundation to keep them steady in the faith no foundation to just to make them consistent all ye shall be offended to me this night for it is written I will smite the Shepherd and the Sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad but after I'm risen again I will go before you into Galilee Peter answered and said unto him though all men shall be offended of thee yet will I never be offended he was so full of himself he thought that within my own makeup within my own lineage or whatever I if I just try hard enough then I can do it I can overcome jesus said in him verily I say unto thee that this night before the crow thou shalt deny me thrice Peter said unto them though I should die with thee yet will I not deny thee likewise also said all the disciples look don't matter how sincere you are before you get the Holy Ghost you are not pressurized to withstand the things of the world you have not been given been given power to overcome until the Holy Ghost it dwells you but after after the Holy Ghost comes that you know when an ego is pressurized to fly up into the heights and stare into the Sun why because he's built in that makeup the makeup of the ego is to fly high look straight into the Sun and go higher than all the other birds because God has put in him he has quipped that eagle that bird with the ability to do that and the baptism of the Holy Ghost equips the believer to fly high to be pressurized to withstand the atmospheric pressures to withstand the things of this world pressurize like a like a like a blue whale that can go way down into the deeps you can be pressurized to go down into the depths of God's Word pressurized to understand the deep hidden mysteries pressurized to withstand all the things that the devil can throw at you because there's something on the inside that's pushing out something out yeah yeah you know think of it like an astronaut an astronaut has that helmet on their head because there they've got that pressure on the inside of their suit to withstand that the lack of atmospheric pressure on the outside so that they can go up to the moon they can fly way high and brother Brown said now we're in the atmosphere age where you can see the natural in the natural they've gone from from the Wright brothers to the airplanes all up to the astronauts because in the spiritual we're flying high also we've we're ready to escape the gravitational pull the natural bonds and God has equipped us well he's given us the things that we need to take this plane he's pressurized in this hour he's given us something to pressurize again listen when when all the world begins to be in broke gross darkness and pressurized on the outside with sickness and frailties and misery there's something on the inside that's pressurized to push out against all that a pressure that that you know what you stand because you've got they understand her on the inside you see Peter Peter made his big boast but in John chapter 21 in 1819 something had been changed he said verily verily I say unto thee when thou wast young thou Gerdes thyself and walkest whither thou wouldest but when thou shalt be old Jesus talking to Peter thou shalt stretch forth our hands and another shall gird thee and carry thee whither thou wouldest not this spake he signifying by what death he should glorify God another or the man that once boasted that he wouldn't he would not deny Jesus and then denied in three times before the crow this man had been transformed into a man that said I'm not worthy to die in the same manner that my Christ died let me be crucified upside down this man had been transformed into something that was willing he was he was willing and able to be a witness of the things that God had done for him in his life brother Graham said in down knowest all things all things he said it's in me eternal life now we are the sons of God now not we will be we are now that's what the trouble of it is people you beget the you people that's born again he said you let the devil kick you around like a football he said stand on your ground you're in Christ he said let the devil kick you around that's the trouble of it today another Christian person that's sitting here sick if they only knew that they were sons and daughters of God now living with Christ not you will be now you are the sons of God now you've got that the day of Pentecost fully come nineteen hundred years ago now is the hour now is the time now is the accepted hour this is the acceptable year of the Lord now is when healing is supposed to be now is when the hip miracles take place now is when Christ is revealing himself here we are now not in the future the devil keeps pushing it off that's Catholicism now is the day this is the hour this is the time this is the place right now this is the day you know I believe he was doing the same thing that I'm trying to do tonight is to reveal to you to expose that God is still working in his church that he's effecting a change in you even now as you listen to the word being preached he's doing something in our midst even though it might not look like it but yet something is being wrought and his home is honing down time and now is the time he says as he's saying now is the time for healing now is the time when God is revealing himself in this bride now is the time don't look to the future like the Catholics do don't keep pushing it off but now is the time now is the hour because look what does the was another thing that the Holy Spirit does the Holy Spirit makes you agree with the word before before the Holy Ghost fell on the day of Pentecost they could not understand the will of the Father they could not agree with the word because they didn't know what they were agreeing with they didn't they had no they had they had nothing within them to say this is that in Matthew chapter 16 verse 27 21 it said from that time forth began Jesus just show unto his disciples how that he must go into Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day then Peter took him and began to rebuke him saying be it far from me from the Lord this this shall not be not be under thee but he turned and said unto Peter get thee behind me Satan thou are an offence unto me for thou savourest not the things that be of God but those that be of men in other words he had no understanding of the requirement of that was what it took to fulfill the Word of God and that day now now apply that in this day I believe now that God has given to us by the preaching of the message an understanding of what it takes to fulfill the word of God in this day and that day Jesus had to die on a cross but in this day there's a bride this that's predestinated to fulfill the New Testament by receiving the word that she's heard the word that was preached by Jesus as he preached for three and a half years now that full preach the full unveiling of that word has been received by a bride and that is your that is your part in fulfilling the word in Acts chapter 2 verse 30 37 and 38 we know Peter Peter then was given an understanding of what it what what it would take to fulfill the word and he said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost because the scripture became open to him his understanding began it was open and he it was revealed to him who Jesus Christ was and and identified what had happened with this with this Old Testament Scriptures that this is that and and and and and then even even was able to explain that this is a promise that that is given and who the promise was given to because he had understanding in Matthew chapter 26 verse 21 to 25 it says and as they did eat he said verily I say unto you that one of you shall betray you betray me because listen before the new birth before the new birth was given on the day of Pentecost they had no spiritual discernment' and let's not let's see how John explains spiritual discernment and in 1st John in a second he said as Judas was sitting there he said they were exceedingly sorrowful and began every one of them to say unto Him Lord is it I and he answered and said he that dip of his hand with me in the dish the same shall betray me and they began to look around and everybody was wondering who is it even though he plainly told him it did you just even asked him but he says it me and he said pretty much yes and yet they they looked around without any kind of a spiritual understanding imagine all the the deception that Judas had portrayed as he walked with him and and the things that he had done but yet their eyes were veiled to what was going on in their myths but John and at first John chapter 4 he says hereby know ye the Spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God notice how he explains discernment now we know brother Brandon had prophetic 'old that that kind of gift of discernment where he was able to see the spirit and a person but I believe that there is a certain type of discernment that every every born-again Christian has by discerning with the word in other words you listen to what comes comes out of somebody's mouth and you know what's in their heart because out of the heart from out of the heart of the mouth speaketh you know what's going on about whether somebody resists the word whether someone when you preach the word whether they say well I don't believe that I that can't be true you know the state and the position of that person here by know you the Spirit of God every spirit that confesseth that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is of God he said it is come in the flesh in other words the testimony is that God has come into the flesh of his people that he's caught he is come right now in this building sitting here in your homes right now listening in he has come in your flesh right now if you hear somebody say he is God know that he identifying with Colossians 1:26 27 this mystery that was hidden from ages the ages but now is revealed to the Gentiles the mystery that Christ in you Christ is in you the hope of glory God is tabernacling himself in you and you know that when somebody does not confess that there's something wrong and that is how you know the two spirits he said in every spirit that confesseth not that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is not of God and this is that spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world in other words that spirit of Antichrist confesses that there are no witnesses that nobody has the right to witness the Word of God that nobody has received the Word of God for their self that the Holy Ghost is tabernacling in themselves they do away with the witness of the word they do away with the preaching of the gospel because the preaching of the gospel is a witness that the Word of God is true they said witness the preaching of the God is the manifestation of the Word of God this is that spirit of Antichrist whereof you have heard that it should come and even now already is it in the world you are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is He that is in you than he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world heareth him we are of God and listen how he explains this we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error think about coming to a play a position of understanding where you know the word and you know your maker so well that you know that if somebody does not agree with the words that you speak something is wrong with them I believe that the bride is coming to that the bride is the final voice under her messenger not a verb or without her messenger but under her messenger then she will be able to speak the words that the messenger has said and if you do not agree with the words that the messenger has said there's something wrong you see you see agreeing with the word is the identification of the Holy Spirit that that story that there brother Wade was preaching on about how Sarah Sarah I before the type of the báb stirred all of us in the Old Testament Sarah I mean contentious and whenever the word goes forth you'll see people begin to rise up in contention maybe not maybe not openly but in their homes they'll begin to speak out against the ministry they'll begin to speak about how turbidity guy gets the things that are preached or maybe not even missive many times lately they're even speaking out without realizing speaking out against the things that the prophets spoke that they proclaim to believe when you when you objector when you disagree with the word when you are contentious just like Sarai that shows that there's something wrong down on the inside of your heart something something is wrong because the base shows that there's something that is not believing down on the inside that's why Sarai said she said well I don't know if I can go along with you having a child let me let me find another way to do it yeah and that's what contention does it finds another who tries to find another way an alternative to fulfilling the Word of God maybe maybe I can just maybe I can just get the word for myself maybe I can just figure it out on my own I don't need let the Ethiopian eunuch because somebody to kind of help me along the way maybe maybe a contention is disagreeing with the word in 2nd Timothy chapter 3 verse 5 date Paul's talking about all having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof from search turn away he's laying out that spirit that Antichrist spirit that that went down from Balaam and Janus and Jambres and and and Jezebel and all the different types that we know of he said for of this sort of a which creep in the houses creeping creeping the house sneak in and lead people away where what you'd find out a wife is leaving her husband so she can follow after something that she's been led away so all these things that are going on I almost can't speak openly but that's alright they words creep in their houses and lead captive captive silly women lady with with sins led away with diverse lusts ever learning and never able to come to the knowledge of the truth now as Janice and Jambres withstood Moses so do these also resisted the truth men of corrupt Minds reprobate concerning the truth resisting the truth not agreeing with the word not agreeing with the word no matter how simple and I'm not I don't let's don't get it confused too but with things that happen as you grew up the statue for perfect man things that you don't understand but when you openly say that that that cannot be truth I don't believe that it's true that I have to dress that particular way or I have to walk that particular way or I I can't smoke this particular thing or I can't drink this thing when you begin to disagree with the world and say I disagree with the with the law and the prophets and all these things that have been laid out in the message of the hour that shows that there's something wrong brother Brown said whether we're Methodist Baptist Presbyterian or Pentecostals or what more Bale to die he's talking about the doctrine of balaam the doctor of Balaam was all we're all the same that there's no different he said ye are a separated people holy under the Lord dedicated to the word in the Spirit of God to bear fruit and his promise of this day and you're not of them I know that's awful strong but that's the truth just the same dedicated to a servant in this last day you think about the doctrine of Balaam was to say that we're just all the same that there's no difference that we don't have to separate but God told you that you are special people you were a separated people he's we're not making something special of ourselves he's the one that said you're especially he's the one that said I'll never leave you or forsake you he's the one that made all these promises and told you not to forget his the benefits in the faith of Abraham let's go down to paragraph 21 he said then you can understand because the Holy Spirit within you every time the Bible said Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever a good intellectual person wants to be popular will say no Jesus Christ is a great healer Gogi into all the world these signs shall follow them that believe the unbeliever shakes his head but if the Holy Spirit is in you he will say amen amen it'll agree with the word every time the spirit and word has to agree and then that's the reason the children of Abraham believe those things because they are God's Word and it's God in them vindicating his own word amen now if you can receive that that's not skim milk that'll help you put vitamins spiritual vitamins in you in other words if the Holy Ghost is eating you that's the thing that is making you putting you in the input and putting in you that desire to come to church to listen to the word to open up your Bible and it's that thing that is causing you to agree with the word because without the new birth you cannot agree with the word but with the new birth you have to agree with the word it will agree with the word that is the evidence of the new birth as you were agreeing with the word when the word is priest you say that's got to be the truth and it keeps unfolding and unfolding and you know that it's true because that thing in you is agreeing with you he said in the perfect strength by perfect weakness because faith will always agree with the word then if your faith is contrary to the word if you think it is then you haven't got faith and the faith can only be built upon the Word of God correct faith and then the Great Commission he said we are so intellectual everything has moved away from the Spirit it's the word it's word it's word but sure I believe in the word but if the spirit don't agree with the word in other word if you don't have a revelation a an understanding of what the word is then you got something mixed up somewhere look at when Cain he was just as religious and just as much with the word as Abel was it was a revelation that made the difference they both worship they both brought sacrifices that both built an altar that both belong to church they both were sincere they both worship so if God altar respects sincerity and fundamentalism why didn't he respect Cain but through revelation Abel being just by revelation no scriptures in them days God had revealed it to him that it wasn't fruit apples and oranges taking us out of the Garden of Eden it was blood the life do you do you agree tonight I want to read this recent quote some scriptures real quick you don't have to scroll through them I'm just going to go through quick some of these promises of God in this Bible then I believe it now in this hour the real believer will agree with and the Bible says the sick of salmon when citizen the afflicted people that we'll save for the hour my lamp of God and the Lord will lighten my darkness for by the I have run through a troop by my god have I leaped over a wall and brother Browne said the troop of death will have no holders to it to this bride she'll run right through it leap over the wall between natural and supernatural and go into the arms of God and I believe these kind of scriptures are the things that now we are able by the baptism at all he goes quickening the word that we've heard to agree with we can look at these promises and the Bible and say I agree with this brother Graham said even death will come and say he's coming up your sleeve and you'll say giveaway Jordan I'm crossing over Psalms chapter 46 verse 1 to 5 it says God is our refuge and strength a very present help in trouble therefore will not we fear though the earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea though the waters thereof roar and be troubled though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof there is a river the streams they're aware of shall make glad the City of God the holy place of the Tabernacles of the Most High God is in the midst of her she shall not be moved God shall help her and that ride early Psalm chapter 34 said the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are upon their cry the face of the Lord is against them that do evil to cut off the remembers of them from the earth the righteous cry and the Lord heareth and deliver out of all their troubles the Lord is not unto them that are of a broken heart and save earth such as be of a contrite spirit many are the afflictions of the righteous but the Lord delivereth him out of them all in other words I believe that these scriptures are all saying the same thing that the Holy Ghost is with you he's on your side he's changing you don't be afraid because God there he's with you many are the afflictions of the righteous listen if I get sick I know somebody that can heal me if I die I know somebody that will get me out of the ground I know somebody that could redeem that's redeemed me I know somebody that's paid the price I know the antidote they're all that I've been inoculated with the Holy Spirit inoculation the Holy Spirit vaccination to take us to protect us brother Branham said and he swore by himself he said then if you were Abraham's seed you can't dispute with God Abraham's seed as a part of this spirit for God gave Abraham a sign of circumcision cutting off the flesh for a witness he had received him in this last days has took the Holy Ghost and circumcised to every believer of cutting off all doubts and unbelief to believe God's Word is pure and holy and it's the truth circumcision cutting all away all unbelief everything cutting loose every shoreline saying God I believe you live or die sinker or drown it's your word I believe it and I believe that is the evidence of the believer in this day that says I they because the believer has been changed to a person now they can take a hold of God's Word and say I believe it come with me I agree with it I agree just like Mary did I agree for the impossible because God's Word promise that God would do the impossible do you know that brother Branham said that we are called in this hour to believe for the impossible when you see that God's Word says that he is going to do the impossible and you agree with it watch signs and wonders follow you because you're agreeing with what God has already said in your believers that the disciples when they saw Jesus cursed that fig tree it looked like something that impossible and then the Bible says that they marvel but then that same promise is supposed to be fearful filled in this hour you were able to speak the word you know it looks impossible it looked impossible when Hattie writes children she said I want the salvation of my children it looked impossible but it was it came out of her mouth and it came to pass you know it looked impossible when that angel came to Mary and said you're gonna a virgin shall conceive and that promise is going to be fulfilled in you you are gonna be fulfilled the fulfillment of that promise and she said be it unto me according to that word and she believed what looked like it was it was impossible she she believed to be impossible because Jesus said well that angel said to Mary he said for with God nothing shall be impossible and brother Branham said in the unchangeable Word of God he said that word was good enough for her she said Behold the handmaid of the Lord be it unto me according to thy word and she started to rejoice over it not wait see she had to believe the impossible she had to believe something that never happened that's what we have to do we have to believe the Impossibles to see new life how can we believe the impossible except we be equipped with the Holy Ghost to give us power to agree with the word to give us power to see the change that God has wrought in our life to know that God is present and on the scene now and now those of you at home just kick back and relax in your recliner a little bit I'm just gonna go a few a little bit more I know we now see you have the Liberty to just take your rest and pull that comfort up around your knees and maybe get you a little sip of water or whatever I had just be blessed because I'm saying these things to encourage you to bring to your remembrance that God is with you that God is on the scene that he's with you in this hour of need he hasn't left you yeah maybe it looks like impossible how in the world has cygnus falls across the land it looks like an impossible situation as more and more people are getting sick but listen God is I believe he's holding us down to where we can believe for the impossible what looks like the impossible to call the Dead sinks from the ground to call the to call the dead from that we're going to see the dead what looks like something impossible moving among us we're going to see our bodies changed something that looks impossible because God is God is a God of miracles he's a miracle working God he's a sign working God he's a wonder working God you know the disciples when they when they began to when they saw Jesus begin to break bread and fed the 5000 fed all the multitude that was a thing that looked impossible but you know it identified him with the one that fed the children of Israel as they journeyed through the wilderness and the disciples looked on that and I said ah I know that that is the same one that's got to be Jehovah Jireh that provided that lamb for Abraham as he was about to slaughter Isaac as he was about to sacrifice Isaac I know that that is the same one that's got to be the same one that provided water for the children of Israel in the wilderness that's got to be the same one and I believe we can look into the word a night and say I know that that same one that provided manna in the wilderness and provided those loaves and fishes for the people gathered around I know that that same one is still on the scene to provide from for me healing in the time of trouble salvation for my family whatever it is because why because I agree with the word I agree with his promise I'm trying to find a place to stop here now brother Graham said and believing God he said you've got a soul beside your census God never give you those senses to trust him where the God give you a spirit to trust your senses only to contact see taste feel smell in here but to you yourself as that spirit that lives in you and when that's been cept when that's been regenerated and the old man died and the new man born again that is a part of God then you become a son of God an offspring of the creator then you can believe that impossible things because you're made up of the miracle-working God you're a part of him brother understanding the message influence he said it's the holy God in that church not the holy man but the holy spirit working in that man do you know what that means that means that it's that hold that's the Holy Spirit that is agreeing with the word that's the Holy Spirit that is accomplishing and fulfilling his word and that takes all the burden off of you because all you have to do is just believe it and watch God performing you know I love I say that maybe to relieve you from the burden this is maybe I know many people have been burdened with what what if I get sick everybody's gonna look at me and say well that person doesn't have faith listen well this is not an hour of judgment now is the hour of faith and you are not the one that has to fulfill the word of God all you have to do is believe it he's the one that made the promise if you remember that good that that that sermon and what brother Brennan was preaching and and then God just took over brother branham's body and began to speak out through him and he said he said brother Brennan has nothing to do with this it's me I'm the Lord and he said I'm the one that made the promise he's the one that made the promise he's the one that is going to fulfill it oh you are obligated to do is believe it see that takes the burden of proof off of you just put it put it back in God's lap all you got to do is just lay I believe that's what Jacob did when he was when he was wrestling with the angel he just took God's promises and laid it in front of him and said you promised it now bring it to pass but to pass I believe that God wants us to see us to see us do that but you got to know what he promised get into the word and find out what he what he said what what he promised for you and this age and then I believe that you will see you will see God fulfilling miracles and what now now is the day for miracles I know we don't we don't put much much stock as far as a proof and signs and wonders but listen where there is faith signs and wonders will follow Sunday's signs and wonders cannot help but follow because the Creator is living on the inside and he is the one that were produced he will he's the one that were produced the word he's the one that will fulfill it you know I I believe that God has been preparedness for such a time as this and preparation comes in and strange form as many times a preparation when you're when you're ready getting ready for a battle in the military they then make you crawl through muddy ditches and they make you crawl under barbed wire and do things that are unpleasant it'll rub shoulders with one another I'm getting into the church now rub shoulders with people maybe they disagree with you and and and we're hard with one another and things like that but but yet that comes when we come to a place like like Noah did there was a preparation time there was a time where he was building up and then he got locked inside of the ark and the door was shut and he was in there Rahab there was a preparation time where she was listening and then she she hung the Scarlet core out her window and then she was stuck inside that room preparation time was over all she had to do was wait and just have faith and watch God do wonders God would perform a miracle and all you talk about something impossible with all the city of Jericho fell down around her in their little house protected by that scarlet cord showing that inside that house was a believin house all around her fell down but she was safe inside of that Noah was safe inside inside of there listen there there comes there comes a time where all that preparation comes to a head and then you see the fruit of your labor listen we've been preparing all this time and I believe I believe now the preparation time oh yeah yeah and I'm saying all this because I don't mean I'm gonna go ahead and say it out on the internet many people are saying we've been preparing because we we have just stayed home and not going to church anywhere and that's been preparing us for staying at home and not going to church anywhere I wonder what kind of thing you are prepared for if you don't agree with the word if you don't or if your life is not matching up with what the word says should we should be doing are you truly prepared and I don't say these things to to shake you or anything but maybe that's the time now that that you should be checking up the day and the hour is now that you should be checking up where where you're standing preparation time is where you're stocking up your storehouse your personal store out you're packing yourself in with the word you're maybe jostling with the stranger in the camp and people that disagree with you you're coming to a revelation of what this message is to you something that's happening in you to change and because of that then you are prepared to do like Noah and be locked away then you were prepared to do like Ruth and to do like like Esther and Abraham to be to be set aside and then you've come to the preparation time now you're prepared brother what are you the word because the Word of God the Word of God in us agrees with the word and that is our joy that's what the Word of God has brought us to because the Bible says in John chapter 15 if you abide in me and my words abide and you you shall ask what you will and they shall be done unto you and that is our comfort that we have the word that we understand the word that we know the word and his word is abiding in us the musicians can go ahead and come forward listen to the Spirit of God the spirit of God is a affecting change the Spirit of God is with us now the Spirit of God will call seed to come up it will cause a reaction and God is still on the scene he's still real heals he's still saving he's still healing he's still a provider and the Holy Ghost is still working in the hearts and lives of believers he's still here don't be downhearted and downtrodden know that God is still on the scene he's still alive and his people I hope that you're encouraged tonight at home listening in all the ones around the world maybe people overseas or wherever you might be and that you're encouraged tonight to know to know that God but you know thinking about Noah and all the ones that that they have prepared God is God is bringing us to a place where we know for ourselves and we can stand on our own two feet maybe one day you'll come to a place where you don't have your pastor with you or you don't have anybody the ministers the deacons you don't have anybody close at hand to come and lay hands on you but what you'll have is the revelation of God's Word to keep you 3 and that will keep you and I believe that's what we've been preparing for packing it in so we prepare go ahead let's sing a song stand to our feet [Music] he's leading us
