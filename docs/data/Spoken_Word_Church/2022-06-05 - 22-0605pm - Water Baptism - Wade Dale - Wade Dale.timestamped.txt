[30:50] all be gone pretty much so
[30:52] i want to read you this
[30:54] uh my quote of the day
[30:56] from the testimony of a true witness
[30:58] brother brown said god's witness the
[30:59] holy ghost the holy ghost itself living
[31:02] in us would never affiliate in an
[31:04] organization
[31:05] you can't organize god he's god
[31:08] what will it do go back the same way it
[31:11] was in the first place that's what we're
[31:13] going to be speaking on today water
[31:14] baptism
[31:15] it'll go back to the beginning back to
[31:17] the original black back to where it
[31:19] started from
[31:21] it'll baptize the same way they did
[31:24] what
[31:25] early church first church
[31:28] it'll teach the holy ghost the same way
[31:30] that it did they'll teach the people the
[31:33] same way that it did it'll abstain from
[31:35] organizations like they did
[31:37] it will have a room for all like you did
[31:41] who will come they'll be clean and holy
[31:44] like they did
[31:45] they'll be filled with a spirit like
[31:47] they were they'll be fearless like they
[31:49] were the same thing that happened to
[31:52] them will happen to those in the last
[31:53] days in the evening lights like it was
[31:56] before
[31:57] god send that
[31:58] voice god
[32:01] sent us
[32:02] that voice
[32:04] amen the voice in the end time so let's
[32:06] bow our heads dear lord thank you for

[32:15] father is going to come straight from
[32:17] your word but let it may be in may it

[32:24] newspaper but we're not here to read
[32:26] newspaper we're here to hear from you

[33:12] amen and lord we need some rain
[33:14] we need some rain my poor little garden
[33:16] needs some rain
[33:18] all right so let's go to matthew now
[33:19] we're going to talk on water baptism
[33:20] since we've since we've had water
[33:22] baptism for the past uh today if only
[33:24] three get baptized that will be 19 that
[33:27] will be baptized so that's a pretty good
[33:29] group of people to be baptized some were
[33:32] re-baptized and some had never been
[33:33] baptized before but like i said
[33:35] sometimes some people just get baptized
[33:37] because their neighbor gets baptized or
[33:39] their brother gets baptized so their
[33:40] sister gets baptized
[33:42] and
[33:43] but we're going to talk about today
[33:46] correct baptism and we're going to show
[33:48] it in the bible
[33:50] listen we don't need quotes to prove
[33:52] these things
[33:54] god did send us a prophet just like he
[33:56] sent peter james john paul
[33:59] people have problems with prophets i
[34:01] don't have a problem there's been
[34:01] prophets god sent prophets since the
[34:03] dawn of time
[34:04] there's been prophets moses
[34:06] isaiah jeremiah
[34:08] you know why people are afraid of
[34:09] william branham because he was different
[34:12] he preached the true word of god like it
[34:14] was in the first church age he didn't
[34:15] compromise with anything amen
[34:19] and i appreciate what he did but like i
[34:20] said before this is not william brown's
[34:22] message it's my message
[34:24] it's god's message to me and you it's a
[34:26] he was a spokesman a conduit just like
[34:29] um brother paul was playing the trumpet
[34:32] that trumpet just sits there it's
[34:33] totally mute without somebody picking it
[34:35] up and blowing into it and knowing how
[34:37] to
[34:38] play that trumpet so what we're going to
[34:40] do today i pray that god will help me
[34:43] just blow through this trumpet
[34:46] and show you some few things maybe that
[34:48] you've never seen on water baptism but
[34:50] maybe some things that you had just a
[34:52] refresher of course so just pray for us
[34:54] let's go to matthew 28 verse 16.
[34:57] so then the 11 disciples went away into
[34:59] galilee i'll do the birthdays in a
[35:01] minute and then or after service is over
[35:04] i'll read the birthdays for june into a
[35:06] mountain where jesus had appointed them
[35:08] now look this is right at the ascension
[35:11] everybody with me
[35:13] this is the ascension at the ascension
[35:15] he's getting ready to go up
[35:17] the day of pentecost is getting ready to
[35:19] be fulfilled 11 days later everybody
[35:21] with me
[35:22] all right this is jesus now look listen
[35:24] all the disciples are standing there
[35:26] except judas he's already hung himself
[35:29] so all the disciples are there all 11 of
[35:31] them everybody with me
[35:33] all right
[35:34] so they're listening to what you're
[35:36] listening to right now
[35:38] and matthew is writing it in his
[35:40] commentary he's writing his part
[35:43] of the gospel
[35:45] that jesus said because jesus didn't say
[35:47] this in every one of the gospels he said
[35:49] it in this one we're going to show that
[35:50] in just a minute then the 11 disciples
[35:52] went away into galilee into a mountain
[35:54] where jesus had appointed them and when
[35:56] they saw him they worshipped him but
[35:57] some doubt it wow
[36:02] man just rose from the dead
[36:04] showed himself did mighty miracles and
[36:07] he's standing there alive again and some
[36:09] doubted you son listen some people would
[36:12] argue with a stop sign
[36:15] amen
[36:17] but some doubted and jesus came and
[36:19] spake unto them what those that are
[36:21] going to listen
[36:23] yeah i wasn't going to say who it was
[36:25] but all power
[36:27] is given unto me in heaven and earth so
[36:28] there was no other power anywhere else
[36:31] because he was almighty god
[36:33] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[36:35] all right baptizing them not sprinkling
[36:39] not just barely getting them under no
[36:41] baptized we'll see what that is in just
[36:43] a minute
[36:44] go you therefore and teach all nations
[36:46] baptizing him in the name of the father
[36:50] and of the son and of the holy ghost not
[36:52] in the name of the father name of the
[36:54] son the name of the holy ghost because
[36:55] they're not names
[36:57] he says in the name singular one name
[37:00] of the father and of the son and of the
[37:01] holy ghost teaching them now look he's
[37:04] telling the disciples
[37:06] take what i've got
[37:09] take what i'm telling you i'm god
[37:10] almighty and human flesh you know that
[37:12] all power has been given unto me and i'm
[37:14] fixing to leave but i'm going to come
[37:16] back on a dependent day of pentecost and
[37:18] i want you to listen to what i'm saying
[37:20] and i want you to do exactly what i tell
[37:21] you
[37:24] because that's going to be the first
[37:25] church
[37:26] go you therefore and teach all nations
[37:28] baptizing in the name of the father and
[37:30] of the son and of the holy ghost
[37:31] teaching them to observe what all things
[37:33] whatsoever i have commanded you
[37:37] and lo i am with you always even unto
[37:39] the end of the world
[37:40] amen acts 2 verse 37.
[37:44] now this is 11 days later
[37:47] on the day of pentecost
[37:50] everybody with me
[37:51] it's not where we got like amnesia it's
[37:53] like 10 years later five years later two
[37:55] years later it was 11 days from when
[37:58] jesus said what he said in matthew to
[38:00] this right here in acts 2. now when they
[38:02] heard this they were pricked in their
[38:04] heart what peter peter peter steps out
[38:07] and says men and brethren he preaches
[38:08] them about a 30-minute most powerful
[38:10] sermon ever been preached
[38:14] because 3 000 people
[38:16] get converted
[38:18] praise god
[38:21] now when they heard this they who the
[38:23] three thousand now remember it was not
[38:25] three thousand jews they were gathering
[38:27] on the day of pentecost because it was a
[38:28] festival
[38:29] so there was people from all nations
[38:32] that were that were gathered there not
[38:34] just the jews all right they're by with
[38:36] me
[38:37] then peter said oh wait a minute now
[38:38] when they heard this they were pricked
[38:40] in their hearts something something's
[38:42] different
[38:44] we've never heard this kind of preaching
[38:45] before
[38:48] he said unto peter and the rest of the
[38:50] apostles so now look
[38:51] the all the apostles are there
[38:54] did i not just tell you the bible said
[38:56] the 11 were there well there's 11 plus
[38:58] there's a hundred and something 120 in
[38:59] the upper room they got the holy ghost
[39:01] and here they come out on the porch and
[39:03] they're preaching
[39:04] then peter said unto them repent
[39:07] repent
[39:08] and be baptized every one of you
[39:11] in the name of jesus christ for the
[39:14] remission of sins and you shall receive
[39:16] the gift of the holy ghost what a
[39:18] promise
[39:19] for that promise isn't to you and to
[39:21] your children and them that are far off
[39:23] thank god the united states of america
[39:26] even as many as the lord our god shall
[39:28] call and with many other words he did
[39:30] testify in his word saying save yourself
[39:32] from this untoward generation then they
[39:34] that gladly received his word were
[39:36] baptized and the same day they were
[39:38] added unto them about 3 000 souls
[39:42] it took them 11 disciples a long time to
[39:45] baptize 3 000 people but the bible said
[39:48] they were baptized
[39:49] in christian bapti baptism according to
[39:52] acts 238
[39:54] everybody with me because look what it
[39:56] says it says then they continued
[39:58] steadfast in the what apostles doctrine
[40:03] and fellowship
[40:05] it wasn't they got baptized and then
[40:07] heard matthew said no no i didn't hear
[40:09] matthew was there
[40:11] now mark wasn't luke wasn't but matthew
[40:13] and john were there
[40:15] and when paul peter stood up and said
[40:17] repent everybody be baptized the name of
[40:18] jesus christ matthew said praise god
[40:26] because there's only one baptism
[40:28] but we're going to get into that in just
[40:29] a minute so they continue steadfast in
[40:31] the apostles doctrine and fellowship and
[40:33] in breaking of bread
[40:34] and in prayer you may be seated in the
[40:36] lord in his blessing to the reading of
[40:37] the word
[40:39] now the greek lexicon right here we see
[40:42] in strong concordance this is baptism
[40:46] and baptized
[40:47] all right because there's two different
[40:49] things in the way we're going to look at
[40:51] it because you can be baptized with the
[40:52] holy ghost are baptized in waters
[40:54] everybody with me all right stay awake
[40:56] today i want y'all to stay awake that's
[40:57] why i had to stand up long time we're
[40:59] going to stand up some more all right
[41:00] this word call is baptizo
[41:03] now i want you to love this is going to
[41:05] be a little bit funny maybe to some
[41:06] people but i want you to watch this
[41:08] it means to wash or baptize in other
[41:10] words immerse because we want it to
[41:12] symbolize a death
[41:15] death burial resurrection all right
[41:18] that's what we're going to read in
[41:18] romans before we go outside to dip
[41:21] repeatedly or to immerse to submerge to
[41:24] cleanse by dipping or submerging to wash
[41:26] make clean with water to wash oneself
[41:28] or debate all right now watch this to
[41:30] overwhelm now what's this not to be
[41:33] confused with
[41:34] 9 11
[41:36] with bapto because it's baptized
[41:39] in baptism
[41:40] these are the two words he's talking
[41:41] about right here the clearest example
[41:44] that showed the meaning of baptizo is in
[41:46] text from the greek poet and physician
[41:48] niconder who lived about 200 bc so he
[41:51] lived 200 years before christ that's
[41:53] what bc means before christ
[41:55] it is a recipe for making pickles
[42:07] i'm just reading what it says
[42:09] it's a recipe for making pickles
[42:12] and it's helpful because it uses both
[42:13] words
[42:15] nyquinder said that what in order to
[42:18] make a pickle
[42:19] the vegetable should be first dipped
[42:24] listen to what i'm saying a pickle is
[42:26] what it's a cucumber
[42:28] and it's going to go through a change or
[42:30] a baptism
[42:32] and it's going to change into a pickle a
[42:35] cucumber is going to change into a
[42:36] pickle
[42:37] but remember once that change happens
[42:41] you can't go back
[42:42] can't go back to the cucumber listen
[42:45] nycander says in order to make a pickle
[42:47] the vegetable should first be dipped
[42:49] bapto which would be baptizing into
[42:52] boiling water and then baptized
[42:55] in the vinegar solution
[42:57] the baptism of the holy ghost both verbs
[42:59] concern the immersion of vegetables in a
[43:02] solution
[43:03] but the first is temporary
[43:05] your water baptism doesn't save you
[43:09] it just wets the pickle i mean where's
[43:11] the cucumber
[43:13] sorry
[43:14] it wet's the cucumber but now what
[43:16] happens when you boil it and put it in
[43:18] this vinegar solution
[43:20] the second the act of baptizing the
[43:23] vegetable produces a permanent change
[43:27] when used in the new testament this word
[43:30] often refers to our union identification
[43:32] with christ than to our water baptism so
[43:34] but he is believed and baptized shall be
[43:36] saved christ is saying that mere
[43:38] intellectual ascent is not enough
[43:42] there must be a union with him and a
[43:44] real change like the vegetable to the
[43:47] pickle
[43:49] pickle me lord
[43:52] i don't know how you doing that in
[43:54] spanish luis but pickled a pickle
[43:59] so that's the word baptism look right
[44:01] here
[44:02] ephesians 4 verse 5 says what one lord
[44:06] one faith one baptism
[44:09] now i just read you two different ones
[44:12] seemingly different ones
[44:14] right
[44:15] i read you matthew 28 19 and i read you
[44:17] acts 2 38. you can't do away with the
[44:19] word of god okay change the word of god
[44:21] okay make it fit your idea there's one
[44:23] lord one faith and one baptism
[44:26] all right so how we're going to get this
[44:27] thing started matthew 3 verse 4 says in
[44:30] the same john now this is john the
[44:32] baptist why in the world was he called
[44:34] john the baptist because he baptized
[44:35] people
[44:36] and the same john had raymond of
[44:38] campbell's hair and leather girdle boy
[44:41] and his meat was locust and wild honey
[44:43] he ate healthy i don't know about the
[44:45] locust
[44:48] then then it went out to him jerusalem
[44:50] and all judea and all the reasons about
[44:51] jordan and what and we're baptized of
[44:53] him in jordan confessing their sins
[44:57] john gets a revelation that they need to
[44:59] be baptized
[45:01] confessing their sins but not calling on
[45:03] a name because he didn't know who that
[45:04] was yet
[45:05] everybody with me
[45:07] all right so let's go to matthew 3 verse
[45:09] 13. now look
[45:10] jesus
[45:12] if we have to start our christian
[45:14] journey with water baptism
[45:16] then jesus he figured he better do hit
[45:19] start his earthly journey
[45:21] in water baptism
[45:23] amen then come jesus from galilee to
[45:25] jordan
[45:26] unto john to be baptized to him but john
[45:28] forbade him saying i have need to be
[45:30] baptized of thee and cometh out of me
[45:32] and jesus answered and said unto him
[45:34] suffer it to be so in other words you're
[45:36] right but
[45:38] thus it becometh us to fulfill all
[45:39] righteousness then he suffered him what
[45:41] was he doing john was washing the
[45:43] sacrifice
[45:45] the sacrifice in the old testament the
[45:47] paschal lamb the passover lamb had to be
[45:50] washed before it could be sacrificed so
[45:52] jesus came to be washed
[45:55] as the ultimate sacrifice he kept the
[45:57] ultimate lamb of god he came to be
[45:59] washed
[46:01] before his sacrifice
[46:03] and jesus when he was baptized went up
[46:05] straight way out of the water and lo the
[46:06] heavens were opened unto him and saw a
[46:08] spirit of the spirit of god descending
[46:10] like a dove and lighting upon him a
[46:12] little voice from heaven saying this is
[46:14] my beloved son and who i am well
[46:16] pleased in other words jesus must have
[46:18] done something that pleased the father
[46:20] amen isn't that what we're here for
[46:22] all right so now look for jesus to start
[46:24] his earthly journey his teaching was
[46:27] john's teaching was baptized jesus
[46:29] teaching was what the kingdom of heaven
[46:31] in hand you must be born again
[46:33] everybody with me
[46:34] but now what did he say in john 5 43 he
[46:37] said i didn't he said i came in my
[46:39] father's
[46:40] name everybody with me
[46:44] i came in my father's name john 5 43
[46:48] and we know that the church started in
[46:50] the book of acts
[46:51] everybody with me
[46:53] the church the real church started in
[46:55] the book of acts
[46:57] in 1830 at the holy ghost fell on the
[47:00] day of pentecost started this new church
[47:03] started the bride started what jesus
[47:06] told them to go and get new converse
[47:08] baptizing them in the name of the father
[47:09] and of the son and of the holy ghost
[47:11] and then 11 days later they baptize them
[47:13] in the name of jesus christ somebody's
[47:15] either confused or we're confused one of
[47:16] the two
[47:17] all right
[47:19] and and the man that wrote it matthew
[47:21] was standing there when all that was
[47:22] going on he should have said no wait a
[47:23] minute jesus told us something something
[47:25] else
[47:26] because you know you listen in the
[47:27] denominational world they'll tell you
[47:29] they said well we'll take jesus baptize
[47:30] baptism over peter's
[47:34] we'll explain it in just a second
[47:35] because there can't be a contrary in the
[47:37] the bible cannot be contrary to each
[47:38] other
[47:39] amen so the church started in the book
[47:41] of acts everybody with me on this
[47:43] the beginning of the bride body
[47:45] the most important thing the foundation
[47:48] the first church age
[47:51] god had to start his church right
[47:54] he could not start his church wrong he
[47:55] had to start his church right
[47:58] and he did amen
[48:00] so he gave the institution to the 11
[48:03] disciples of what to do in the book of
[48:06] matthew and we'll read that again in
[48:08] just a minute but he said go into all
[48:09] the world preach the gospel get new
[48:11] converts baptize them in the name of the
[48:13] father and of the son and of the holy
[48:14] ghost and then we're going to see some
[48:16] other places where it talks about
[48:18] raising the dead healing the sick
[48:19] casting out devils
[48:21] but now look there was three and a half
[48:24] year
[48:25] spot that jesus preached remember from
[48:26] the day he was on on jordan's river he
[48:29] started his preaching
[48:31] that the kingdom of heaven is here and
[48:33] you must be born again
[48:34] and then he expounds for three and a
[48:36] half years is everybody with me
[48:38] all right he expounds for three and a
[48:40] half years
[48:42] now look
[48:43] then there's four gospels that comes out
[48:46] of that three and a half years everybody
[48:47] with me
[48:48] amen three god four gospels matthew mark
[48:51] luke and john
[48:53] they cannot be contrary to each other
[48:55] they are complementary to each other
[48:57] everybody with me say amen
[48:59] all right there's four not different
[49:02] ways of looking at it it's four ways of
[49:05] looking at it amen
[49:08] everybody with me
[49:10] now what god instituted though
[49:13] is that what
[49:14] i'm going to have a book of acts
[49:17] i'm going to come back on the day of
[49:19] pentecost and i'm going to enter into my
[49:21] people and i'm going to start my church
[49:24] and i'm going to start it right
[49:28] and i'm going to use these four gospels
[49:29] these four men matthew martin luke and
[49:32] john to put a guard around that book of
[49:36] acts
[49:37] because what does the book of acts mean
[49:39] it means the way that the apostles acted
[49:42] that's why it's called acts
[49:44] so it's the acts of the apostles
[49:46] actually it's the word put in action
[49:50] because remember in matthew mark luke
[49:51] and john not one person got saved while
[49:53] jesus was here except the thief on the
[49:56] cross and he got eternal life imparted
[49:59] to him when he got over into
[50:02] paradise not here on the earth
[50:04] so jesus was what talking about a future
[50:06] event that was going to be
[50:09] written down or pinned or whatever you
[50:11] want to say by four different individual
[50:13] people
[50:14] everybody with me on this
[50:17] don't be quiet
[50:19] matthew mark luke and john four gospels
[50:21] we read them
[50:22] all right remember there's a fifth
[50:24] gospel
[50:26] right
[50:27] mama
[50:29] that's what the prophet said and i
[50:30] believe it
[50:32] but there's four gospels
[50:35] matthew mark luke and john and they
[50:36] guarded the book of acts
[50:39] whatever they said in those four gospels
[50:42] had to coincide with the book of acts
[50:43] because the book of acts the church
[50:45] wasn't started in matthew mark luke and
[50:46] john
[50:48] anybody with me the church was not
[50:50] started in matthew martin luke and john
[50:52] it was started in acts acts 2 38 i just
[50:55] read it to you the holy ghost fell on
[50:57] 120 people
[50:59] changed their life entirely and they
[51:01] were so scared beforehand that they
[51:02] locked herself up now they got fulfilled
[51:04] with the holy ghost that burst the doors
[51:06] open went outside and the men said they
[51:08] must be drunk
[51:10] they were staggering around they were
[51:12] praising god
[51:13] they didn't care who saw them
[51:18] matthew and john were there
[51:22] all right
[51:25] they missed something up there mine's up
[51:27] there we go
[51:29] so now you've got the four gospels
[51:31] matthew mark luke and john and we know
[51:33] that according to the bible that there's
[51:35] four beasts
[51:37] we're going to read it here in
[51:38] revelations there's four beasts that
[51:40] guard
[51:41] the altar or that guard remember
[51:43] remember back in the old testament
[51:45] when you had the ark of the covenant
[51:46] which was what the word of god
[51:49] everybody with me that was the word of
[51:51] god
[51:52] they were protected by a lion ox man an
[51:55] eagle
[51:57] banner you had three tribes three tribes
[52:00] three tribes and three tribes that made
[52:02] 12.
[52:03] even in banks county we can add
[52:05] well that's multiplication
[52:07] but they were guarding the mercy seat
[52:10] they were guarding that
[52:12] that thing that they cherished the most
[52:16] so in the new testament as the new
[52:18] testament begins god
[52:20] the book of acts
[52:22] is the acts of the apostles it's when
[52:24] it's when his children were born it's
[52:26] when he was going to start his church
[52:28] the right
[52:30] way so he had a guard
[52:33] matthew mark luke and john
[52:36] lyon oxman and eagle if you don't
[52:38] believe me look in your scofield bible
[52:40] if you've got a bible look in the flower
[52:41] and when you come to every matthew it
[52:44] says the boldness of a line says the
[52:46] labor of an ox from math for mark it
[52:49] says to the intelligence because what
[52:51] was luke luke was a physician
[52:53] he was smart intelligent so there's the
[52:55] man and then the eagle anointing was
[52:56] john there was a lot of prophetic things
[52:58] that john said that nobody else put in
[53:00] the gospel
[53:01] but those four together though they
[53:03] dovetailed just like this
[53:05] they don't come apart but then what they
[53:06] do is to they guard whatever that is in
[53:09] acts that's what they guard
[53:12] am i okay with that
[53:15] let's read revelations four
[53:17] verse one it says after this what after
[53:19] the church ages this is john after all
[53:21] the church ages he's being caught up and
[53:23] after this i looked and behold the door
[53:25] was opened in heaven
[53:26] and the first voice which i heard was as
[53:28] it were a trumpet talking with me which
[53:30] said come up hither
[53:32] and i will show thee things which must
[53:34] be hereafter.
[53:35] and i and immediately i was in the
[53:37] spirit and behold the throne was set in
[53:39] heaven and one
[53:40] not three
[53:41] one set on the throne
[53:45] and he that sat on was to look upon like
[53:47] jasper and sardine stone there was a
[53:50] rainbow around the throne and in sight
[53:51] like emerald and round about the throne
[53:54] were four and twenty seats which is what
[53:55] the 12 apostles and the 12 patriarchs is
[53:58] everybody with me on that 24 elders all
[54:00] right
[54:00] and upon the seats i saw four and 20
[54:02] elders sitting clothed in white raiment
[54:04] they had on their head crowns of gold
[54:06] and out of the throne preceded lightning
[54:09] and thundering in voices
[54:10] and there were seven lamps of fire
[54:12] burning before the throne which are the
[54:14] seven spirits of god now we know that
[54:16] was not god doesn't have seven spirits
[54:19] he's one spirit but he has seven
[54:21] dispensations that he works in all right
[54:23] everybody with me on that
[54:25] and before the throne there was a sea of
[54:26] glass like in the crystal so here's a
[54:28] sea of glass
[54:30] and in the midst of the throne and round
[54:32] about the throne were four beasts
[54:34] full of eyes before and behind
[54:37] and the first beast was like a lion
[54:39] the second beast was like a calf or an
[54:41] ox
[54:42] the third beast had the face of a man
[54:45] he said brother wait what's this guy do
[54:46] water baptism if i wasn't reading you
[54:48] this it wouldn't have anything to do
[54:50] with it
[54:51] it'll go in there somehow
[54:53] the third beast had the face of a man
[54:55] and the fourth was like a flying eagle
[54:58] and the four beasts had each of them six
[55:00] wings about them and they were full of
[55:01] eyes within and they rest not day and
[55:04] night saying holy holy holy lord god
[55:06] almighty which was and is and is to come
[55:09] now these four beasts the lion ox man
[55:12] and eagle we know as believers that that
[55:15] was the holy ghost it was shown to us in
[55:17] ezekiel there was a wheel the middle of
[55:19] the wheel part of the wheel it was right
[55:21] there with the children of israel but it
[55:23] it's the baptism of the holy ghost
[55:26] it's the holy ghost in your life the
[55:28] believers but now remember these are not
[55:30] beasts there's two different kinds of
[55:32] beasts in the bible is that correct one
[55:34] is a therion beast which is an untamable
[55:38] irreverent beast and that's the beast
[55:40] over in revelations but these beasts
[55:42] right here are called zunes
[55:45] i'm reading it right here out of the
[55:47] greek lexicon they're zooms
[55:49] they're living beings
[55:53] so in other words it's not just a an
[55:56] allegory
[55:58] it's something living and those four
[56:00] beasts as the bible says make up one
[56:03] they have eyes before and behind
[56:04] revelation they see ever they see in the
[56:06] past they see in the future they see on
[56:08] either side
[56:09] it's the holy ghost helping me and you
[56:11] see what's going on
[56:12] everybody with me on that
[56:14] all right so it's matthew martin luke
[56:16] and john they guard those four beasts
[56:18] the lion ox man and the eagle
[56:20] would be matthew martin luke and john i
[56:22] tell you again read in your scofield
[56:23] bible look in the very front of it it'll
[56:25] say the book of matthew it'll say lion
[56:27] book of mark ox and you can look at
[56:29] their commentaries and you can see that
[56:31] matthew was really bold
[56:33] go forth into all the world preach the
[56:34] gospel baptize in the name of the father
[56:36] and of the son of the holy ghost mark
[56:38] didn't even say that
[56:39] mark was laboring the whole time he was
[56:41] in the in the in his commentary or in
[56:43] his chapter and then luke was very
[56:46] intelligent there was a lot of things
[56:47] that he knew because remember luke
[56:48] wasn't there when all this happened god
[56:50] had to show it to him and he had to
[56:52] write it down all right
[56:53] and then john was the prophetic and
[56:55] there's a lot of john you know do you
[56:58] know that about 75 of john
[57:01] was written
[57:02] in the upper room
[57:06] john 14 15 16 17 18 all those about five
[57:09] or six chapters jesus spoke to him and
[57:11] then it said they went to the garden
[57:14] so he's the only one that wrote that
[57:15] whole sermon that jesus preached about
[57:18] us being one and and about them
[57:20] protecting you and i mean about god
[57:21] protecting you and all that was written
[57:23] in the upper room
[57:25] nobody else wrote about it but john
[57:28] but yet matthew was uh he was there with
[57:30] him
[57:31] all right everybody with me on this
[57:32] we're getting to we're going to make a
[57:34] point here to where we'll nail this
[57:35] thing down all right so now you've got
[57:38] the book of acts
[57:40] all right the book of acts which is the
[57:42] acts of the apostles it's the acts of
[57:43] the holy ghost and the apostles
[57:46] and they acted right
[57:48] right
[57:49] everybody with me they acted right they
[57:51] didn't start this thing wrong they
[57:52] started it right on the day of pentecost
[57:55] god wanted his church started right and
[57:57] he wants his church as i read that quote
[57:59] he wants the church in the end time to
[58:00] be right
[58:02] he requires that it's right
[58:04] anybody with me
[58:06] so now look
[58:07] matthew
[58:09] what do you say about this
[58:11] well
[58:13] this is how i'm going to guard the book
[58:15] of acts
[58:17] then the 11 disciples went away into
[58:18] galilee into a mountain where jesus had
[58:20] appointed them and when they saw him
[58:21] they worshiped him but some doubted and
[58:24] jesus came and spoke unto them saying
[58:25] all power is given unto me in heaven and
[58:27] earth
[58:28] go ye therefore and teach all nations
[58:30] baptizing in the name of the father and
[58:32] of the son and of the holy ghost
[58:34] teaching them to observe all things
[58:36] whatsoever i have commanded you
[58:38] now listen
[58:40] he's given them a commandment
[58:43] jesus himself god almighty human flesh
[58:45] is giving them a commandment
[58:49] and 11 days later they turn around and
[58:51] don't do it
[58:56] think about it
[58:58] matthew
[59:00] how are you going to guard the book of
[59:01] acts
[59:02] well this is what jesus said
[59:05] this is the lion this is the line of the
[59:07] tribe of judah this is exactly what
[59:09] jesus said on that day right before the
[59:12] ascension
[59:13] teach them to observe all things
[59:14] whatsoever i have commanded you and lo i
[59:17] am with you always even unto the end of
[59:18] the world
[59:19] amen now let's see what mark has to say
[59:21] about it this is the ox
[59:23] mark 16 verse 14 says and afterwards he
[59:26] appeared unto the eleven as they sat at
[59:28] me this is the same exact scenario that
[59:30] we're in matthew everybody with me
[59:34] as they said it meet and um upgraded
[59:36] them with their unbelief and hardness of
[59:38] heart now this is the same thing that
[59:39] happened over there in matthew
[59:41] m but mark is writing his version of it
[59:43] or his part of it it's kind of like a
[59:45] preacher said one time and i agree with
[59:47] it that that matthew had a strand of the
[59:49] rope mark had a strand of the rope
[59:52] luke had a strand of the rope
[59:54] and john had a strand of the robe and
[59:56] jesus was a rope
[59:58] they just twirled it together to make
[1:00:00] one
[1:00:01] because they couldn't be different
[1:00:03] had to be the same
[1:00:05] afterwards he appeared unto the leaven
[1:00:06] as it said it meet and um upgraded them
[1:00:08] with their unbelief and hardness of
[1:00:09] heart because remember back up there in
[1:00:11] matthew it says
[1:00:12] that many what some doubted right there
[1:00:15] some doubted
[1:00:17] this is the same thing marx mark what
[1:00:19] are you writing how are you going to
[1:00:20] protect it mark
[1:00:22] afterwards he appeared in the eleven as
[1:00:23] they said it meet and upbraided them for
[1:00:25] their unbelief and hardness of heart
[1:00:27] because they believed not them which had
[1:00:28] seen him before after he was risen
[1:00:31] and he said unto them go ye into all the
[1:00:33] world and preach the gospel to every
[1:00:35] creature
[1:00:36] he that believeth and is baptized shall
[1:00:38] be saved but he that believeth not shall
[1:00:40] be damned
[1:00:41] now matthew
[1:00:43] you told your part
[1:00:44] here i'm going to sell my part
[1:00:46] by the holy ghost because remember the
[1:00:48] line ox man and eagle is the holy ghost
[1:00:50] not two holy ghosts not two different
[1:00:52] opinions one opinion
[1:00:53] and it's god's and i believe it
[1:00:56] he that believeth and baptized it shall
[1:00:58] be saved he that believeth not shall be
[1:00:59] damned and these signs here we go now my
[1:01:02] mark
[1:01:04] how are you gonna
[1:01:07] how you gonna protect that book of acts
[1:01:11] well i'm going to tell them what they're
[1:01:12] going to do
[1:01:15] matthew told them what jesus said
[1:01:18] mark's going to tell them what's going
[1:01:19] to happen after they get the holy ghost
[1:01:22] and these signs shall follow them that
[1:01:23] believe it in
[1:01:25] my
[1:01:26] name
[1:01:29] not in my title
[1:01:32] in my name they shall cast out devils
[1:01:36] they shall speak with new tongues they
[1:01:37] shall take up serpents and if they drink
[1:01:39] any deadly thing it shall not hurt them
[1:01:41] and they shall lay hands on the sick and
[1:01:43] they shall recover
[1:01:44] so then after the lord has spoken unto
[1:01:46] them he was received up into heaven same
[1:01:49] scenario we're going to look over here
[1:01:50] in john same one in luke same one in
[1:01:53] mark is the same one in matthew they all
[1:01:55] four had four different versions four
[1:01:57] different strands of the same rope
[1:02:00] but it was still the rope
[1:02:02] because he said in my name
[1:02:05] my name
[1:02:06] so then after the lord had spoken unto
[1:02:08] them he was received up into heaven and
[1:02:10] set on the right hand of god now look
[1:02:12] and they went forth and preached
[1:02:14] everywhere the lord working with them
[1:02:17] confirming the word with signs following
[1:02:20] how you gonna protect it mark
[1:02:23] i'm gonna tell them what's gonna happen
[1:02:25] when they get the holy ghost
[1:02:28] after they're baptized in correct
[1:02:29] baptism
[1:02:30] in the name
[1:02:32] of the father and of the son of the holy
[1:02:33] ghost which is the lord jesus christ now
[1:02:36] here's the man anointing here's luke 24.
[1:02:38] now watch this i really had never read
[1:02:40] it like this before until the lord had
[1:02:42] me go back and read it but every one of
[1:02:44] these has something to do with a name
[1:02:49] matthew said in the name of the father
[1:02:50] and of the son of the holy ghost mark
[1:02:52] said in my name they shall cast out
[1:02:55] devils
[1:02:56] now watch luke here's the man anointing
[1:02:58] the smart guy
[1:03:00] how are you going to protect it luke
[1:03:02] and said unto them thus it is written
[1:03:04] and thus it behoove christ the suffering
[1:03:06] derives from the dead the third day and
[1:03:08] that repentance and remission of sins
[1:03:14] what acts 2 38 say repent and be
[1:03:16] baptized in the name of jesus christ for
[1:03:18] the remission of your sins
[1:03:21] what does a man say luke
[1:03:23] and that repentance and remission of sin
[1:03:25] should be preached in his name
[1:03:29] among all nations beginning at jerusalem
[1:03:31] isn't that the same thing jesus said
[1:03:34] and you're a witness of these things and
[1:03:36] behold i send the promise what's the
[1:03:39] promise acts 2 38
[1:03:42] baptize the name of the lord in the name
[1:03:43] of jesus christ for remission of sin and
[1:03:45] you shall receive the gift of the holy
[1:03:46] ghost
[1:03:47] for the promises unto you and behold i
[1:03:50] send the promise of my father upon you
[1:03:54] but tarry ye in the city of jerusalem
[1:03:56] until you be endued with power from on
[1:03:59] high so they're going to the upper room
[1:04:00] to be endued with power
[1:04:02] and a false baptism
[1:04:06] no
[1:04:07] that ain't happening
[1:04:11] luke how you guarding it
[1:04:13] i'm going to say it just like matthew
[1:04:15] did but just in a little bit different
[1:04:16] way
[1:04:19] and he led them out as far as bethany
[1:04:21] lifted up his hands and blessed them and
[1:04:23] it came to pass while he blessed them he
[1:04:25] was parted from them and carried up into
[1:04:27] heaven
[1:04:29] all right let's see john what you got to
[1:04:30] say about this here's john here's the
[1:04:32] eagle anointing here's the prophetic
[1:04:34] anointing of god
[1:04:37] john verse 21 verse 21 verse 15 through
[1:04:41] 17. so when they had died jesus said to
[1:04:44] who simon peter
[1:04:46] simon son of joseph
[1:04:48] jonas
[1:04:49] loveth thou me more than these
[1:04:52] now who is this he talking to
[1:04:54] peter
[1:04:56] he says unto him yea lord thou knowest
[1:04:58] that i love thee and he said unto him
[1:05:00] feed my lambs
[1:05:04] feed
[1:05:06] my
[1:05:07] lambs
[1:05:08] jesus talking it's in red letter if you
[1:05:10] don't mind that's red letter i didn't
[1:05:12] put that there that was there from the
[1:05:14] bible feeding my lambs he said to him
[1:05:16] again the second time simon son of jonah
[1:05:17] loveth jonas loveth thou mean he said to
[1:05:20] him yea lord and thou knowest that i
[1:05:22] love thee he said unto him feed my sheep
[1:05:25] he fed his lambs on the day of pentecost
[1:05:28] but he fed his sheep later on in his
[1:05:30] life
[1:05:31] there's a difference in the lamb and the
[1:05:32] sheep a lamb is a little bitty thing
[1:05:33] sheep has been what grown up a little
[1:05:35] bit everybody with me
[1:05:37] feed my sheep in other words peter i am
[1:05:41] going to give you the responsibility
[1:05:44] to feed my people
[1:05:48] and not feed them faults
[1:05:51] feed them true
[1:05:54] he said to him again the second time and
[1:05:55] he said feed my sheep he said unto him a
[1:05:57] third time simon son of jonas loveth
[1:05:59] thou me peter was grieved
[1:06:02] but peter didn't have a lot of brother
[1:06:03] economy he didn't have a lot of patience
[1:06:05] and temperance because he wasn't born
[1:06:06] again yet
[1:06:07] but when he got born again he
[1:06:09] probably knew he should not have said
[1:06:11] this but peter was grieved because he
[1:06:13] said unto him third time the love is now
[1:06:14] me and he said to me lord
[1:06:17] thou knowest all things
[1:06:19] they'll know us that i love thee and
[1:06:21] jesus said unto him one more time
[1:06:24] feed my sheep
[1:06:29] peter was the spokesman on the day of
[1:06:31] pentecost
[1:06:33] jesus
[1:06:35] we're going to see you here in just a
[1:06:36] minute
[1:06:37] peter got something that jesus didn't
[1:06:38] have
[1:06:41] maybe you'll stay awake for a minute
[1:06:43] jesus answered them i told you and you
[1:06:45] believe not john 10 verse 25 the works
[1:06:48] that i do in my father's name
[1:06:51] now remember father's not a name
[1:06:54] what was the name of the father jesus
[1:06:56] christ
[1:06:59] brother's a title jehovah's a title rose
[1:07:01] of sharon is a title we'll read what a
[1:07:03] title is it's a word put before or after
[1:07:06] a name to signify a position
[1:07:09] it has nothing to do with person
[1:07:13] but you believe not
[1:07:15] because you are not my sheep
[1:07:18] as i said unto you
[1:07:20] my sheep
[1:07:22] peter
[1:07:23] my sheep is going to hear my voice
[1:07:26] through you
[1:07:29] that's how peter's going to feed him
[1:07:30] he's going to speak the voice of god
[1:07:33] through peter the voice of god is going
[1:07:34] to feed through peter and feed his sheep
[1:07:39] my sheep hear my voice
[1:07:42] and i know them
[1:07:44] and they follow that me
[1:07:46] and i give unto them eternal life
[1:07:50] and they shall never perish neither
[1:07:52] shall any man pluck them out of my hand
[1:07:54] praise god
[1:07:55] matthew 16 verse 13 says when jesus came
[1:07:58] to the coast of caesarea philippi
[1:08:00] he asked his disciples saying whom do
[1:08:02] men say that i
[1:08:03] the son of man am
[1:08:06] and they said some say you're john the
[1:08:07] baptist
[1:08:09] some say you're elijah
[1:08:10] some say you're jeremiah or one of the
[1:08:12] prophets
[1:08:14] he said but who do you say that i am
[1:08:16] and simon peter the one that's going to
[1:08:18] feed his sheep the one that's going to
[1:08:21] stand up on the day of pentecost and
[1:08:23] proclaim this new beginning of how to do
[1:08:26] this in your christian journey this is
[1:08:29] how you're going to do it because jesus
[1:08:30] said feed my sheep
[1:08:33] peter was given the commission to feed
[1:08:36] that first church age
[1:08:39] jesus said unto him blessed art thou
[1:08:41] simon bar jonah for flesh and blood had
[1:08:44] blood had not revealed it unto thee but
[1:08:45] my father which is in heaven and i say
[1:08:48] unto thee that thou art peter and upon
[1:08:50] this rock i'll build my church and the
[1:08:51] gates of hell shall not prevail against
[1:08:53] it and i will give unto you a set of
[1:08:56] keys
[1:08:59] jesus didn't even have jesus gave them
[1:09:01] to him
[1:09:03] and i will give unto thee the keys
[1:09:05] of the kingdom of heaven
[1:09:08] and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth
[1:09:11] i'll bind it in heaven
[1:09:14] whatsoever i shall loose on earth you
[1:09:16] loose on earth i'll loose it in heaven
[1:09:21] he gave that to peter
[1:09:24] and i give unto thee the keys of the
[1:09:26] kingdom of heaven whatsoever thou shalt
[1:09:28] bind on earth shall be bound in heaven
[1:09:30] whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth
[1:09:32] shall be loosed in heaven he didn't give
[1:09:33] them to john
[1:09:35] he didn't give him to he didn't give
[1:09:36] them to paul
[1:09:38] hello
[1:09:40] he gave them to peter
[1:09:42] so peter's got the keys of the kingdom
[1:09:43] whatever he's going to unlock god's
[1:09:45] going to unlock it in heaven whatever
[1:09:47] he's going to close down here god's
[1:09:48] going to close it in heaven
[1:09:50] everybody with me
[1:09:52] matthew 11 verse 25 says at that time
[1:09:54] jesus answered and said i thank thee o
[1:09:56] father
[1:09:57] lord of heaven and earth because hit you
[1:09:59] have hid these things from the wise and
[1:10:01] prudent and reveal them unto babes
[1:10:04] by four different
[1:10:06] gospels
[1:10:08] four different men's
[1:10:10] vision
[1:10:11] of the same rope but they have their
[1:10:13] strand
[1:10:14] but when you weave them all together
[1:10:17] it's got to be revealed to babes
[1:10:20] by the holy ghost
[1:10:23] because thou has hid these things from
[1:10:25] the wives in prudence i'm saying this
[1:10:26] morning god never wanted the bible to be
[1:10:29] read like a newspaper
[1:10:31] it's a love letter it has it has no
[1:10:34] power read as a newspaper
[1:10:37] sure it gives you wonderful history it
[1:10:39] gives you stories it gives you people
[1:10:41] and it gives you all these different
[1:10:42] things but without the inspiration that
[1:10:44] it was written with
[1:10:48] it's just like reading the newspaper
[1:10:52] and how many know that the newspaper is
[1:10:53] a real reliable source of information
[1:10:57] just like the internet
[1:11:00] even so father for it seemed good in thy
[1:11:02] sight
[1:11:03] all things are delivered unto me of my
[1:11:05] father and no man knoweth the son but
[1:11:07] the father neither knoweth any man the
[1:11:09] father saved the son
[1:11:11] and he to whomsoever the son
[1:11:14] will reveal him
[1:11:17] in other words if you're not revealed if
[1:11:19] you're not revealed in that correct way
[1:11:21] right there you'll have a trinitarian
[1:11:23] doctrine
[1:11:24] you'll have three persons in the godhead
[1:11:26] and ain't no such thing a person is a
[1:11:28] personality
[1:11:29] personality is an individual
[1:11:31] they're not three equal gods
[1:11:34] you can't have three equal gods which
[1:11:36] one was born first who created one first
[1:11:38] they just all appear at one time no
[1:11:40] there's only one god with many
[1:11:42] manifestations so now we're fixing to
[1:11:45] open a door
[1:11:48] matthew
[1:11:50] you're on this side
[1:11:51] mark you're on this side
[1:11:54] luke you're on this side
[1:11:57] john you're on this side and inside of
[1:12:00] you is a book of acts
[1:12:02] inside of you is a way to get the holy
[1:12:04] ghost
[1:12:06] so we're getting ready to open the door
[1:12:09] and somebody's got the key
[1:12:12] amen
[1:12:13] we know who's got the key peter's got
[1:12:15] the key
[1:12:17] peter now what do you got to say when
[1:12:19] you open that door
[1:12:22] now when they heard this they were
[1:12:24] picked in their heart and said unto
[1:12:25] peter and the rest of the apostles
[1:12:27] men and brethren what shall we do
[1:12:31] amen
[1:12:35] click
[1:12:37] repent
[1:12:39] and be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:12:41] christ
[1:12:42] for the remission of your sin and you
[1:12:43] shall receive the gift of the holy ghost
[1:12:47] he unlocked it down here and god was god
[1:12:49] wasn't up in heaven going on peter
[1:12:52] that's not what i said
[1:12:54] when i was on earth i didn't say that he
[1:12:56] said there's my son doing exactly what i
[1:12:58] saw he would do from eternity
[1:13:01] i gave him the keys i wanted him to have
[1:13:04] the keys
[1:13:05] because he was the one that was going to
[1:13:08] start that church right
[1:13:11] the most vile of all of them
[1:13:16] most of us
[1:13:18] peter cursed
[1:13:19] through stuff cut cut somebody's ear off
[1:13:24] went fishing
[1:13:25] when jesus wanted to talk to him
[1:13:28] but peter
[1:13:30] once you get the holy ghost
[1:13:33] you're going to be different
[1:13:36] then peter said then repent and be
[1:13:37] baptized every one of you in the name of
[1:13:39] jesus christ for the remission of sins
[1:13:41] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:13:43] holy ghost
[1:13:44] for the promises unto you and to your
[1:13:46] children and them that are far off as
[1:13:48] many as the lord our god shall call and
[1:13:49] with many other words he testified in
[1:13:51] his word is saying save yourself from
[1:13:53] this untoward generation
[1:13:55] then they that gladly received his word
[1:14:01] gladly received that baptism
[1:14:06] matthew was standing there
[1:14:08] all the other disciples were standing
[1:14:10] there
[1:14:12] and they didn't say peter that's not
[1:14:14] what jesus said
[1:14:18] if you ever thought about that
[1:14:20] they were standing there in all four
[1:14:22] gospels the 11 disciples were standing
[1:14:25] there with jesus when he said what he
[1:14:26] said now they're everyone standing with
[1:14:29] peter
[1:14:30] and there's no distension there's no
[1:14:33] controversy
[1:14:34] they gladly received this word
[1:14:37] and they were baptized that's what i was
[1:14:39] shouting about out in the in the garden
[1:14:41] i thought man
[1:14:43] look at that they gladly received it the
[1:14:46] open the door peter
[1:14:48] you got the key what are you going to
[1:14:50] say about it
[1:14:52] matthew
[1:14:53] how are we going to get to acts 2 38 he
[1:14:55] said through matthew 28 19.
[1:14:59] luke how you gonna get
[1:15:01] tax 238
[1:15:04] we gonna go
[1:15:06] and tell
[1:15:08] to baptizing my name
[1:15:10] john
[1:15:12] we're going to tell a story about peter
[1:15:13] feeding sheep
[1:15:14] because that's what's going to happen on
[1:15:16] the day of pentecost
[1:15:17] that's how we're going to get listen the
[1:15:19] only way to truly baptize is to baptize
[1:15:20] in the name of the father and of the son
[1:15:22] of the holy ghost
[1:15:24] in the name
[1:15:25] of the lord jesus christ
[1:15:29] and the same day were added about 3 000
[1:15:31] souls
[1:15:33] so they got baptized the right way
[1:15:36] there was 3 000 people added to the
[1:15:38] kingdom
[1:15:39] and they continued steadfast in the
[1:15:41] apostles doctrine they went to church
[1:15:45] the apostles church
[1:15:48] and they continued steadfast in the
[1:15:50] apostles doctrine and fellowship and
[1:15:52] breaking bread and in prayer
[1:15:54] amen
[1:15:56] i want to ask you something while we're
[1:15:58] stopped right here just for a second
[1:16:01] i know we've all heard this
[1:16:03] but when we went to the philippines and
[1:16:04] brother ernie villanueva and some of
[1:16:07] them started the mystery expo
[1:16:10] what did they put on their banner
[1:16:13] ten thousand dollars to the first person
[1:16:15] that will show
[1:16:17] anybody being baptized in the bible in
[1:16:20] those titles
[1:16:21] of father son holy ghost
[1:16:23] oh man them brothers and denominational
[1:16:25] brothers they were heading through the
[1:16:27] bible
[1:16:28] you can't find it i'll give you 10
[1:16:29] million dollars
[1:16:32] if you can find one person ever been
[1:16:34] baptized in a title the father-son holy
[1:16:36] ghost
[1:16:39] is the bible that confused
[1:16:41] is the bible that wrong
[1:16:43] no it's just hidden from the wise and
[1:16:45] prudent
[1:16:46] do you remember when somebody said
[1:16:47] something about water baptism to you and
[1:16:49] you could you're like
[1:16:51] my mama was baptizing father son holy
[1:16:53] ghost i i got aunts and uncles that were
[1:16:55] baptized named fathers and hogan what
[1:16:56] are you talking about but when you saw
[1:16:58] it what happened
[1:16:59] when you really see water baptism you'll
[1:17:01] see it
[1:17:02] and there's no other way you can be
[1:17:04] baptized
[1:17:06] i'll prove to you in just a minute that
[1:17:08] was a catholic
[1:17:09] doctrine started by the catholic church
[1:17:12] had a friend of mine one time mark
[1:17:14] he got converted and he was real zealous
[1:17:18] and he was a baptist
[1:17:19] and he was talking about the roman
[1:17:21] catholic church being the old mother
[1:17:22] horn about them praying to saints and
[1:17:25] and about you know this that and the
[1:17:26] other and i looked at him i said mark
[1:17:29] that's wonderful
[1:17:31] i said but you baptized exactly the way
[1:17:33] they tell you to baptize
[1:17:36] no we don't know it
[1:17:38] let's go to the let's go let's go read
[1:17:40] something right here
[1:17:42] nowhere in history until the roman
[1:17:44] catholic church was anybody ever
[1:17:45] baptized in the name of the father and
[1:17:47] the son and the holy ghost
[1:17:48] they were all baptized in the name of
[1:17:50] the lord jesus christ or jesus christ of
[1:17:52] the lord
[1:17:53] until the catholic church changed it
[1:17:56] and nowhere in the bible
[1:17:58] has anybody ever been baptized
[1:18:01] in those titles
[1:18:04] acts 4 verse 8 says then peter filled
[1:18:06] with the holy ghost so he's not just
[1:18:08] some guy that walking around on the
[1:18:09] street that they picked up off the
[1:18:10] street and said here say this
[1:18:12] then peter being filled with the holy
[1:18:14] ghost sending them you rulers of the
[1:18:16] people and elders of israel
[1:18:18] if we this day be examined of the good
[1:18:20] deeds done to the impotent man he's
[1:18:21] talking about healing the man
[1:18:23] at the gate beautiful by what means is
[1:18:25] he made whole be it known unto you all
[1:18:28] and to all the people of israel that by
[1:18:30] the name of jesus christ of nazareth the
[1:18:32] name
[1:18:33] whom you crucified whom god raised from
[1:18:36] the dead even by him doth this man stand
[1:18:38] here before you whole now see he's he's
[1:18:41] magnifying what mark said
[1:18:46] how do you get in mark
[1:18:49] some people got to be healed
[1:18:51] that's what he's telling them right here
[1:18:53] whom you crucified whom jesus god raised
[1:18:55] from the dead even by him doth this man
[1:18:57] stand here before you whole
[1:18:59] this is a stone which said it not of you
[1:19:01] builders which has become the head of
[1:19:02] the corner
[1:19:03] neither is there salvation in any other
[1:19:07] for there is none other name
[1:19:11] not title there is none other name under
[1:19:14] heaven given unto men whereby we must be
[1:19:17] saved
[1:19:19] now when they saw the boldness of peter
[1:19:21] and john and perceived that they were
[1:19:23] unlearned and ignorant men they marveled
[1:19:25] and they took knowledge of them that
[1:19:27] they had been with jesus
[1:19:29] can you neighbor take knowledge that
[1:19:31] you've been with jesus
[1:19:33] can your friends at work take note that
[1:19:36] you've been with jesus
[1:19:39] acts 8
[1:19:41] but when they believed philip preaching
[1:19:43] the things concerning the kingdom of god
[1:19:45] and the name of jesus christ they were
[1:19:47] baptized
[1:19:49] why they heard the name of jesus christ
[1:19:52] and what did philip do he didn't baptize
[1:19:53] him in titles he baptized the name of
[1:19:55] who he was preaching about
[1:19:57] in the name of jesus christ they were
[1:19:58] baptized both men and women
[1:20:00] then simon himself believed also when he
[1:20:02] was baptized he continued with philip
[1:20:03] and wandered beholding the miracles and
[1:20:05] signs which ever done and when the
[1:20:07] apostles which were at jerusalem heard
[1:20:08] that samaria had received the word of
[1:20:10] god they said unto them peter and john
[1:20:12] who when they were come down prayed for
[1:20:13] them that they might receive the holy
[1:20:15] ghost for as yet listen for as yet he
[1:20:17] was fallen
[1:20:18] upon none of them what the holy ghost
[1:20:21] only they were baptized in the name of
[1:20:22] the lord jesus
[1:20:24] then they laid their hands on them and
[1:20:26] they received the holy ghost
[1:20:28] acts 10 verse 43 says to him given to
[1:20:30] him give all the prophets witness that
[1:20:32] through his name
[1:20:34] whosoever believeth him shall receive
[1:20:36] remission
[1:20:38] of sins while peter yet spake these
[1:20:39] words the holy ghost fell on all them
[1:20:41] which heard the word
[1:20:42] and they have the circumcision which
[1:20:44] believed were astonished as many as came
[1:20:45] to peter because that on the gentiles us
[1:20:48] bunch of heathen dogs
[1:20:50] also was poured out the gift of the holy
[1:20:52] ghost
[1:20:53] for they heard them speak with tongues
[1:20:55] and magnify god then answered peter can
[1:20:57] any man forbid water that these should
[1:21:00] not be baptized which have received the
[1:21:02] holy ghost as well as we and he
[1:21:04] commanded them now listen they got the
[1:21:07] holy ghost
[1:21:08] they're born again believers and peter
[1:21:10] said that's okay
[1:21:12] but you still need to be baptized
[1:21:15] and he commanded them he didn't ask him
[1:21:18] amen he commanded them to be baptized in
[1:21:21] the name of the lord
[1:21:24] then pray they him to tarry certain days
[1:21:26] acts 19 it came to pass that while
[1:21:28] apollos was at corinth paul having
[1:21:30] passed through the upper coast
[1:21:32] came to ephesus finding certain
[1:21:34] disciples he said unto them have you
[1:21:35] received the holy ghost since you
[1:21:37] believed
[1:21:38] and they said unto him we got a seed
[1:21:42] we don't need the holy ghost oh i didn't
[1:21:44] say that we have not so much as heard
[1:21:46] whether there be any holy ghost and he
[1:21:47] said unto them unto what then were you
[1:21:49] baptized and they said unto john
[1:21:51] all right they were baptized by a
[1:21:53] prophet
[1:21:54] amen but not not in the name
[1:22:00] this said paul john barely baptized with
[1:22:02] the baptism of repentance saying unto
[1:22:04] the people that they should believe on
[1:22:05] him which should come after him that is
[1:22:08] on christ jesus and when they heard this
[1:22:10] they were baptized in the name of the
[1:22:12] lord jesus amen amen
[1:22:14] now here this is a name i want you to
[1:22:17] listen to this
[1:22:18] listen
[1:22:19] this is the definition of name all right
[1:22:21] everybody wake up
[1:22:23] ah this this excites me more and
[1:22:25] preaching on the son of man for a moment
[1:22:26] here if you don't mind i'm sorry
[1:22:29] but to be so right
[1:22:31] the world is so wrong
[1:22:33] they'll fight you over this
[1:22:38] because of what misinterpreted theology
[1:22:41] ill-teaching
[1:22:43] a name our names are as incredibly
[1:22:46] important is are an incredibly important
[1:22:49] part of our what identity
[1:22:53] they carry deep
[1:22:55] personal
[1:22:57] cultural
[1:22:58] familial or family and historical
[1:23:01] connection
[1:23:03] they also give us a sense of who we are
[1:23:06] the communities in which we belong and
[1:23:08] our place in the world
[1:23:11] now what is the title i had to write it
[1:23:12] down because i couldn't get it to come
[1:23:13] up on the computer
[1:23:16] it's one it's a words it's words used
[1:23:18] before or after a name signifying a
[1:23:21] profession or a position
[1:23:24] dr sam jones
[1:23:27] father samuel dale
[1:23:30] director of operations
[1:23:33] fall bush
[1:23:34] see what i'm saying
[1:23:36] but now
[1:23:37] when he signs the check
[1:23:39] he's not going to sign director of
[1:23:40] operations
[1:23:42] he's going to sign his name
[1:23:45] [Music]
[1:23:47] he can put director of operations but if
[1:23:49] there's no name behind it
[1:23:52] it means nothing
[1:23:58] so it's words used before or after
[1:23:59] that's a title a title gives you a
[1:24:01] position
[1:24:03] so
[1:24:04] matthew
[1:24:05] what are you doing
[1:24:08] he said i'm giving god
[1:24:11] i'm telling you what jesus said this is
[1:24:13] his position
[1:24:14] he is the father he is the son he is the
[1:24:17] holy ghost but for you to get baptized
[1:24:20] the right way you got to go through my
[1:24:21] door
[1:24:23] you got to go through my lion anointing
[1:24:26] l-i-o-n anointing
[1:24:28] and then when you get into the book of
[1:24:30] acts and you get into the holy of holies
[1:24:32] you're going to baptize in the name of
[1:24:33] the lord jesus christ
[1:24:37] but our names are incredibly important
[1:24:39] part of our identity
[1:24:41] they carry deep personal and cultural
[1:24:44] family historical connection they give
[1:24:47] us a sense of who we are
[1:24:51] hallelujah
[1:24:52] jesus said in john 5 43 i come in my
[1:24:54] father's name and you receive me not
[1:24:58] if another shall come in his own name
[1:25:00] him you'll receive
[1:25:02] ephesians 3 verse 14 for this cause i
[1:25:04] bow my knee unto the father of our lord
[1:25:06] jesus christ of whom the whole family
[1:25:08] in heaven and earth is named
[1:25:12] 3 verse 16 said let the word of christ
[1:25:14] dwell in you richly in all wisdom
[1:25:15] teaching and admonishing one another in
[1:25:17] psalms
[1:25:18] and hymns and spiritual songs singing
[1:25:20] with grace
[1:25:22] in your hearts to the lord and
[1:25:23] whatsoever you do in word or deed
[1:25:26] word or deed
[1:25:29] do all in the name of the lord jesus
[1:25:31] giving thanks to god and the father by
[1:25:34] him
[1:25:35] philippians 2 verse 8 says being found
[1:25:37] in fashion as a man he humbled himself
[1:25:40] and became obedient unto death even the
[1:25:42] death of the cross
[1:25:43] wherefore god also has highly exalted
[1:25:46] him and given him a name
[1:25:50] not a position
[1:25:52] not yet give him a name
[1:25:57] which is above every name
[1:26:00] that at the name of jesus every knee
[1:26:02] shall bow
[1:26:04] of things in heaven and things in earth
[1:26:06] and things under the earth and that
[1:26:08] every tongue should confess that jesus
[1:26:10] christ
[1:26:11] is lord to the glory
[1:26:13] of god the father
[1:26:15] galatians 3 verse 26
[1:26:17] said for you are all the children of god
[1:26:19] by faith in christ jesus for as many of
[1:26:21] you have been baptized into christ have
[1:26:24] put on christ
[1:26:26] not a title
[1:26:28] there is neither jew nor nor greek no is
[1:26:30] either bond or free male or female for
[1:26:33] we are all one in christ
[1:26:35] and if you be christ then you are
[1:26:36] abraham's seed and heirs according
[1:26:38] to the promise
[1:26:40] colossians 2 verse 11 says in whom also
[1:26:42] you are circumcised with the
[1:26:43] circumcision made without hands that
[1:26:45] means the circumcision of the heart and
[1:26:48] putting off the body of the sins of the
[1:26:49] flesh by the circumcision of christ
[1:26:52] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[1:26:54] you're risen with him through the faith
[1:26:56] of the operation of god who hath raised
[1:26:58] him
[1:26:59] from the dead
[1:27:01] um thomas if you'll give those out
[1:27:05] there's a little um
[1:27:07] we found those long time ago
[1:27:09] and it's uh
[1:27:11] well you can read it but if you look
[1:27:13] down at the bottom
[1:27:16] when you get one of these you'll look
[1:27:17] down at the very bottom or look up to
[1:27:18] the top it's really funny because they
[1:27:20] they put
[1:27:21] which of these practice were practiced
[1:27:23] by the apostles in the early church
[1:27:24] which former baptism and jesus name's
[1:27:27] over here and father son holy ghost is
[1:27:28] blank
[1:27:31] blank
[1:27:34] blank
[1:27:36] because it's not going to happen
[1:27:39] everybody all right with it
[1:27:44] while you're looking at i'll read some
[1:27:46] of it
[1:27:48] the baptism in jesus name was
[1:27:50] to the jews repent and be baptized
[1:27:52] that's acts 2 38 samaritans they were
[1:27:54] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:27:55] acts 8
[1:27:56] gentiles he commanded them to be
[1:27:58] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[1:27:59] acts 10.
[1:28:01] peter taught baptism there's none other
[1:28:02] name given whereby we must be saved acts
[1:28:04] 4 verse 12.
[1:28:06] paul taught whatever you do do all in
[1:28:08] the name of the lord jesus colossians 3
[1:28:10] 17.
[1:28:12] matthew 28 19 was a command by jesus to
[1:28:15] baptize in a name
[1:28:17] the apostles did not repeat the words of
[1:28:20] the command but they did obey it as seen
[1:28:22] in the scriptures above
[1:28:24] since father son and holy ghost are
[1:28:25] titles of the manifestation of the
[1:28:27] almighty spirit and his body the
[1:28:29] apostles understood his saving name to
[1:28:32] be jesus
[1:28:33] can you dare say that the apostles
[1:28:35] disobeyed the lord or failed to baptize
[1:28:37] properly
[1:28:39] the name of the father son and holy
[1:28:41] ghost is lord jesus christ
[1:28:43] the actions of the apostles in the book
[1:28:45] of acts prove this
[1:28:47] to be true
[1:28:50] baptism in jesus name let's continue
[1:28:51] reading this is then this is an
[1:28:53] encyclopedia britannica volume 3 page
[1:28:57] 365 the baptismal formula was changed
[1:29:00] from the name of jesus christ to the
[1:29:02] words father son and holy ghost by
[1:29:04] catholic church in the 2nd century
[1:29:08] britannica encyclopedia again everywhere
[1:29:10] in the oldest source
[1:29:12] it states that baptism took place in the
[1:29:14] name of jesus christ volume 3 page 82.
[1:29:17] the candy encyclopedia of religion the
[1:29:20] early church always baptized in the name
[1:29:22] of the lord jesus until development of
[1:29:24] the trinity doctrine in the second
[1:29:26] century that's page 53
[1:29:29] catholic encyclopedia oh my goodness
[1:29:32] this is coming right out of the beast i
[1:29:34] mean i'm sorry right out of the catholic
[1:29:35] church
[1:29:36] own book
[1:29:40] catholic encyclopedia justin martyr was
[1:29:42] one of the early fathers of the roman
[1:29:43] catholic church and he's the one that
[1:29:45] changed if you'll read on down a little
[1:29:46] bit further
[1:29:48] hastings encyclopedia of religion name
[1:29:51] was an ancient
[1:29:52] synonym for person payment was always
[1:29:54] made in the name of some person
[1:29:55] referring to ownership
[1:29:57] therefore
[1:29:59] one being baptized in jesus name became
[1:30:01] his personal property hallelujah
[1:30:06] 2 page 377 of acts 238 new international
[1:30:09] encyclopedia the term trinity was
[1:30:11] originated by tetralum a roman catholic
[1:30:14] church father volume 22
[1:30:16] page
[1:30:17] 477.
[1:30:19] so when the when they developed the
[1:30:21] trinitarian doctrine that's when the
[1:30:22] fathers and holy ghost baptism come it
[1:30:24] had to be the same devil
[1:30:27] it was the same devil doing the same
[1:30:28] thing
[1:30:30] all right
[1:30:30] so now let's read this and then we're
[1:30:32] gonna then we'll be ready to go from
[1:30:34] we're gonna sing a song before we go
[1:30:37] but this is what i'm going what i read
[1:30:38] out there so i'll not read it out there
[1:30:40] i'm gonna read it here for those of you
[1:30:41] that are gonna be baptized listen to
[1:30:42] this
[1:30:43] so what shall we say then shall we
[1:30:45] continue in sin that grace may abound
[1:30:46] now this is paul talking to the romans
[1:30:49] god forbid
[1:30:50] how shall we
[1:30:52] that are dead to sin live any longer
[1:30:54] therein
[1:30:56] know you not that as many of us as were
[1:30:58] baptized into jesus christ
[1:31:00] into jesus christ not into father son
[1:31:02] holy ghost
[1:31:04] were baptized into his death
[1:31:06] therefore we are buried with him by
[1:31:08] baptism into death that look
[1:31:10] death
[1:31:12] burial
[1:31:13] resurrection i've always said we're
[1:31:15] going to a funeral today something is
[1:31:17] going to die and you will decide whether
[1:31:20] it dies or not
[1:31:23] hello somebody you will decide when if
[1:31:25] it will die
[1:31:30] that like as christ was raised up from
[1:31:31] the dead by the glory of the father even
[1:31:33] so we also should walk in newness
[1:31:36] of life
[1:31:37] what i say before all those that we saw
[1:31:39] back in 2015 2016 different ones we've
[1:31:41] never seen them again they did not walk
[1:31:44] in newness of life
[1:31:46] it actually made them worse
[1:31:52] so i won't just i wouldn't just go to
[1:31:54] the water and say i'm gonna get baptized
[1:31:56] because my friend did
[1:31:58] because you're identifying supposedly
[1:32:00] who you're married to
[1:32:02] to jesus christ
[1:32:03] not to a father or a son
[1:32:06] or a ghost
[1:32:07] amen
[1:32:09] even so we also should walk in newness
[1:32:11] of life for if we have been planted
[1:32:13] planted
[1:32:15] together in the likeness of his death we
[1:32:17] shall also be in the likeness
[1:32:19] of his resurrection
[1:32:21] knowing this that our old man is what
[1:32:24] crucified what happened on the day of
[1:32:26] crucifixion three people died
[1:32:30] i don't know of anybody that came off of
[1:32:32] a cross
[1:32:33] alive
[1:32:34] the sole purpose to put him on that
[1:32:36] cross was to kill him
[1:32:38] so the sole purpose of today for you to
[1:32:40] nail your sins
[1:32:42] nail those demons to that cross
[1:32:45] and forget about it
[1:32:48] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:32:50] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:32:52] for he that is dead
[1:32:54] is freed from sin
[1:32:56] now if we be dead with christ we believe
[1:32:58] that we shall also live with him
[1:33:00] knowing that christ being raised from
[1:33:02] the dead diet no more
[1:33:04] death hath no more dominion over him
[1:33:06] for in that he died he died unto sin
[1:33:08] once but he liveth he liveth unto god
[1:33:11] likewise reckon ye also yourselves
[1:33:15] think about this to be dead
[1:33:17] indeed unto sin
[1:33:19] but alive
[1:33:21] unto god
[1:33:23] through jesus christ our lord
[1:33:26] water baptism
[1:33:30] is essential
[1:33:32] very important but you can receive the
[1:33:34] holy ghost
[1:33:36] without being baptized but i don't
[1:33:38] believe you'll receive the true baptism
[1:33:39] of the holy ghost and not want to then
[1:33:41] be baptized
[1:33:42] to make sure everything is right the way
[1:33:45] it's supposed to be
[1:33:47] to make sure that you're doing
[1:33:48] everything because you know what one
[1:33:50] little crack who is in the crack
[1:33:53] satan the devil's always in the crack
[1:33:56] because he's waiting on it to make it
[1:33:58] wider
[1:33:58] and we're not going to make that thing
[1:34:00] wider we're going to what we're going to
[1:34:01] put him to death
[1:34:03] he's going to die today
[1:34:06] in a group of people
[1:34:08] and if you've not been baptized or you
[1:34:09] want to be baptized again if you think
[1:34:11] you just got baptized because your
[1:34:12] cousin did then please
[1:34:14] be re-baptized today in the name of the
[1:34:16] lord jesus christ matthew
[1:34:20] what are you saying
[1:34:22] you got to go through me first
[1:34:24] you got to know what jesus said
[1:34:26] but you got to look to acts 2 38 and see
[1:34:28] exactly what was going on
[1:34:30] because i'm guarding this thing this
[1:34:32] precious book of acts this precious
[1:34:34] group of people matthew mark luke and
[1:34:36] john were the guards that guarded that
[1:34:38] book of acts
[1:34:39] and they didn't tell you anything
[1:34:41] different than what the book of acts was
[1:34:43] but they guarded it to make sure listen
[1:34:45] to make sure not everybody went in
[1:34:49] listen this is for everybody but
[1:34:51] everybody's not going to accept it
[1:34:53] they're going to stop when matthew 28 19
[1:34:56] well i think i'll take this baptism and
[1:34:57] that'll be it
[1:34:59] they never got to acts 238 so they never
[1:35:02] fulfilled they think listen they i say
[1:35:04] the world the denominational world they
[1:35:06] think they're fulfilling what jesus said
[1:35:11] they are not
[1:35:13] they're not fulfilling what jesus said
[1:35:17] they got about halfway there
[1:35:22] but christian baptism was on the day of
[1:35:24] pentecost
[1:35:26] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:35:28] because that's who we're identified with
[1:35:30] musicians let's come we're going to sing
[1:35:32] a song
[1:35:33] we sing this song this song was written
[1:35:37] by george brother george canada
[1:35:40] and it was written by brother george

[1:40:05] baptized in jesus now listen to this
[1:40:08] we're going to see this a little bit
[1:40:09] different
[1:40:10] if you have
[1:40:13] to cross
[1:40:15] chili jordan
[1:40:20] before
[1:40:22] i
[1:40:25] do
[1:40:27] just tell all paul
[1:40:30] that you made a change
[1:40:33] and you've been baptized in jesus name
[1:40:37] oh
[1:40:38] just tell paul
[1:40:40] that you've made a change
[1:40:43] and that you've been
[1:40:45] baptized in jesus name sing of course
[1:40:48] one more time oh if i
[1:40:51] were you i'd make a change
[1:40:55] if i
[1:40:56] were you i'd make a change
[1:41:00] if i
[1:41:02] were you i'd make a change and i'd be
[1:41:07] baptized in jesus name
[1:41:11] if you want to listen to that i think
[1:41:13] it's still on the
[1:41:14] sixth seal
[1:41:16] they sang that at the tabernacle before
[1:41:19] the service started and on certain tapes
[1:41:22] you can hear it if you'll get some of
[1:41:23] the old tapes you can hear them singing
[1:41:24] that song
[1:41:27] and the place just went bonkers
[1:41:31] because because the baptism in the name
[1:41:32] of the lord jesus christ had really just
[1:41:34] came to the forefront of brother brown's
[1:41:36] ministry even in the 63 while he was
[1:41:38] preaching the seals
[1:41:40] and here they are
[1:41:42] god helping them to write this song
[1:41:44] if i were you i'd make a change and be
[1:41:47] baptized in jesus name
[1:41:49] [Music]
[1:41:53] yes to jeffersonville yes they wrote it
[1:41:55] yeah didn't that right charlotte didn't
[1:41:57] they write it on the way to
[1:41:58] jeffersonville your daddy
[1:42:03] i just hope god let him look over
[1:42:06] look over the banister of time and just
[1:42:07] see that we're still singing that song
[1:42:10] 60 years later
[1:42:12] and it still means as much to me as it
[1:42:14] did 60 years later to that group of
[1:42:16] people
[1:42:17] that were that were gathered in the
[1:42:18] tabernacle to listen to the prophet of
[1:42:20] god preach
[1:42:22] and i'd be baptized
[1:42:24] in jesus name
