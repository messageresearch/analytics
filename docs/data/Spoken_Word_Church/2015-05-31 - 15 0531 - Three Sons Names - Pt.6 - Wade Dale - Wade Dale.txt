========================================

now let's go to John 1 or you can just let me get it here and what we've been speaking on is you got to make a little bit higher than that three sons name there you go for three son's name now what are the three sons names son of what God I'm sorry if y'all can't see it over there I can't turn it Son of God Son of what amen and Son of David three sons names now remember it one God right let's read verse one John 1 verse one in the beginning was the word now if you look up that word and just kind of background a little bit before something hadn't been here that word is logos if you remember we spoke on that a couple of Sundays ago and I from what I've gathered it's helped a lot of people because it helps explain what that logos is it's it's the logo or the poster child of what God always is to me that logos covers everything Son of God Son of Man son of David all in the low God because remember it's all wrapped up in the Sun all right and then the only way we can understand God is for him to condescend or step down in a form of what speech it does no good if you don't say anything all right so you gotta you know you can have all this intelligence in your mind but unless you speak it and then develop it what if um what if a man like Albert Einstein which had one of the greatest Minds in history what if he even never said a word we would have fallen way behind in technology but he began to speak what his thoughts were and just being a a normal well he wasn't normal but he had a human brain just like me and you do his brain was no bigger his capacity was the same as ours because you know even when Albert Einstein died they took his brain out and they studied his brain now since the whenever he died in the in the 50s or the early 60s he died and they've been trying to um they tried to um see if his brain was more special than anybody else's it wasn't he just was able to use his more than anybody else so in the beginning was the word which is the logos the speech are what the word of God and the Word was with God and the Word was God so the word is God the word is not a separate person from God the same was in the beginning with God what God and His Thoughts dwelt alone all right we're going to go back in like we said in the chart here that brother Dale did before the eternal but remember in his great mind he always was all these attributes okay the great eternal God even before there was an atom on the earth he was a Healer because by his foreknowledge he already looked down through time and seen everything I I was using this the other day and for those of you that weren't here last Sunday I was eating cashews or peanuts cashews I was eating cashews and I looked down and there was one left in my hand and I said God you know you could tell me what dirt this came from see that's that's an infinite God and he could trace that dirt back to the Garden of Eden he could show you the whole process all the way up to where it came to the plant come into the tree come into the fruit come into the cashew the cashew went to California to be processed it was processed in the big back and it was sent to Gainesville Georgia or would you buy them Walmart Aldi went to Aldi Warehouse Aldi Warehouse to my house and here I picked it up and there the cashew what that's got it now how you gonna understand that you can right man can only trace it back so far to maybe a lot number or what tree it came up of but God can actually take those elements and go all the way back in the beginning of time and show you where that cash you came from we'll see that's an infinite dot so being infinite God he knew what we needed before we got here he was a savior a Healer a redeemer all these things and this this big great God funneled himself down to a form called a logos and the logos when we look at the logos we see the all of God that we can understand because like I said now go back and try to understand how he knows all these things brother Brown said he knew every Knack that would be on the earth Nat you know how many trillions and sub zillions of gnats have been on this Earth gotten you every one of them brother Brown said he knew how many times he would bat his little eye and how much time will it make see that's why a lot brother I'm like brother Joe then you just you just sit there and shake your head because you don't but see that's not for us to understand at this moment we'll never be that God but he did give us a part of himself which is the same substance because look in the beginning was the word now watch brother Dale been preaching on how did that what got planted what got planted in you was the word right now listen let me tell you how to connect that God knew that was the word you needed before the foundation of the world and he wrote it so you could see it and hear it while you're down here everybody get that say Amen or old man right and what age you'd live in absolutely see so he he put it all in 66 books like we were talking about the analogy of McDonald's when you see the golden arches you think of what McDonald's but in the forming of McDonald's you go all the way back to the McDonald Brothers in the 40s and you go to Ray Kroc then they sold billions of hamburgers patties pickles salt pepper why'd be a volume of a book you couldn't even read but when you look at that golden arches you're worried about eating a hamburger you're not worried about when they got started and what place they started from you just want a hamburger same way with God you cannot go back and understand everything about God but he's put something forward enough so that we can understand him so he put it in 66 books so we can carry it around with us because this is the mind of God this is the understanding that we needed every one of you have a favorite scripture right every one of you should have heard a word from the preacher and something pricked your heart like it did on a day of Pentecost right well now what God did before the foundation of the world was before the foundation of the world he knew what Peter was going to say he knew what them 3 000 people what would prick their heart more than anything because remember God's infinite he's not finite like we are we go down One path he's infinite he knew what they would need to prick their heart what he let Joel write it way 2 000 years before he put it in Joel's mind the mind of God came to Joel Joel remember what what Peter said Peter said repent be baptized and then he started talking about Jesus right or you're talking about Jesus before he said this is that spoken by the prophet Joel well Joel spoke it but what was it was a mind of God right before the foundation of the world he knew Joel would speak it and what Joel spoke to beat the 3 000 people that's what they needed to prick their heart Ethiopian eunuch he kept reading and he kept reading and he kept reading right okay well something of his understanding that needed to be open well what did God do God can't God can but he doesn't do it that way God could have come straight down to that Ethiopian unit but that's not the way God's plan is God planned life has to come through the body amen all right because that was my question to the people said well there was a seed laying in there I said well what an Ethiopian unit when he why didn't the seed just come alive why do you need Philip all right exactly why did he need Phillip if he was reading and it just quickened and he found out he was that's right but why didn't God just come down to let Ethiopian you know why did he go get Philip send Philip down there why does God have to do that because remember God don't do anything right that he doesn't get results God doesn't do something like we do sometimes we'll do something we go uh we shouldn't have done that right or whatever you know but God doesn't go God doesn't go I didn't see that Ethiopian unit before the world what am I going to do now no God already knew all this he knew what that unit would be reading and by free moral agency he saw the Ethiopian unit reading the Bible so God sent Philip that had the word already quickened in his heart to what to go do what brothers irrigated the water to put some Spirit life on the what that Ethiopian unit was reading that's right because I asked my whole question I Want Somebody explain that to me if he would if the Ethiopian unit was the seed of God why didn't he just Why didn't God just Quicken it while he was standing there exactly he was confused right he was not born again he was confused about when Peter came and expounded the Bible said Peter I mean no I'm sorry Philip expounded on what he was reading then what happened God come and quickened what he had heard through what Philip said right that's why I 100 show me anywhere in the Bible that somebody got the new birth or the Holy Ghost fell on them before they heard the word cannot happen you can't quit that's why brother random says you can't Quicken non-see all right you can't quit the non-state there's nothing there to Quicken but God knowing that you'd be reading Genesis 1 26. and I go that's me Lord that's me that's where you began not where you begin but when I began to understand who you really are that's where and so you know what God knew that I'd be thinking that so before the foundation of the world when he was back here still had the same attribute because the logos is a speech so he sent the logos down and had Moses right Moses wrote Genesis so he had Moses write that down he had John write this scripture I hope you realize things like that I hope you realize there that there's how many millions and billions of sermons has been preached how many millions let's don't say a bit but how many millions of sermons have been preached from this Bible since it was put in print in the 1500s and even before that because Peter and all of them were actually quoting the Old Testament preaching the gospel Paul was quoting the Old Testament preaching the gospel well you know what you know what if that sermon was from God that's why he put it in the Bible so that you could preach that sermon so that brother Dale could preach whatever scripture he reads today and it quickens in somebody's heart somebody's heart God knew you needed that in the Bible that's my brother Brown said every a and thee everything in this Bible is perfect what one man said it's perfect from cover to cover even the front page says holy okay all right but that's what God did so this word is is not to be tampered with because to me this is the mind of God this is what we need on this side of Eternity you know in this in this Dimension this is what we need to put everything back together we didn't need a book of The Maccabees right we didn't eat and they were written we didn't need a uh what they call these a book of Anna as a book of this there's a book of that you can read that if you want to but brother around said this is God's word that's right this is God's thoughts expressed in just 66 books sick but in 66 bucks look how many sermons even false has been preached from this right here all over the world today somebody's going to take a text out of this and preach right and if it's the word of God and if it quickens to somebody's heart and somebody grows up in the Statue of a perfect manner if somebody gets saved guess what that's why God put it in there everybody get that that's why I love that you you love the continuity of God that's one thing for sure if God puts his stamp on this okay and we know this is the love letter because remember Here We Go Again McDonald's great big huge volumes to tell every pickle and every ounce of juice and every ounce of Coca-Cola it'd be volumes enough right and same with this if God would have written every sermon that come out of here that was true if he had written it in here this room couldn't hold the book right yeah but it's a love letter remember between the lines there's those millions and billions of of quickening of the word that's God to me that's the mind of God the mind of God puts a puts in the beginning was the word and word was with God and the Word was gone you got a prophet comes along says in the beginning was the logos as a low golfers with God and then he starts explaining the Logan well then you know what this is the way I think the only way for us to understand God Is by that scripture being right there if you took that scripture out yeah yeah right come on if you took that scripture out and God didn't write that in the word any of these any of this if he didn't write that you wouldn't understand the Loca that's right now we understand in the beginning was the logos of the word the speech whatever God was going to say he's already said right right he said it it's done but I want his man done man's Twisted it and turned it into all different things right and God has let us ignorantly do that but in the end time let's think about that this morning in the end time though we look back at all the denominations and false teachings there's a truth in there somewhere right and that truth has come through every age even with Martin Luther there's a truth but you and I can't smoke a pipe and drink a beer and be in this age right right Martin Luther could do that because what what happened was is what false teaching right amen false teaching but now we don't to me brother random when he come he he you know the book's open now so there's no way that uh even Paul you know he looked through a glass dark because brother Brown explained that very well he's talking about a fence you know he said there's a circus on the other side of the fence he said I'm a little short guy he said maybe somebody can look through the knot hole well if you look through a knot hole you're not going to be able to see but a certain part of the circus or the word right but that doesn't mean that whole surface is not there going on they got elephants and big tents and and uh wheel you know a big uh Ferris wheels but if you only can see that much you're seeing part of the circle it's the true circus yeah but you're only seeing a part of it what brother Ramsay but now if I got on somebody's shoulders right and looked over the fence he said there's the whole circus well see that's why in the end time they took him he was talking about himself he really was but he's talking about God in him doing it knowing that we needed somebody to go on top of the fence somebody like said the eagle it goes up and can see in every direction okay that's so beautiful what God now the lion Ops man and eagle remember the lion he's very strong right very strong powerful but he can only see past if the grass is this much taller than the lion's head he can't see no further than that no matter how powerful he is no matter how powerful that word was in the first days they only could see this far above you know right if they were walking through the grass they couldn't see right all right but now the ox is a little bit taller but he's not as powerful as far as ferocious but he's powerful pulling and he can see a little bit further because he can see above the grass but he can't see past the trees or even the horizon all right the man the man's caller he's intelligent he can he can say well I can't see that far but maybe I can climb up on a tree something artificial you can climb up on a tree and that's what Martin Luther he didn't have an artificial Doctrine right right Luther didn't have an artificial Doctrine but part of what he saw was artificial because there was no father son Holy Ghost baptism in the Bible but yet he taught that so that was the part that God said okay I'm going to wink at that but the intelligence of man allowed him to see a little bit further and then now what does this say this is the eagle age no limitations that eagle can get up so high he can see that way that way that way and back behind him right so that's why we have the eagle anointing and you and I as as what brother Brown called us eaglets brother Brown's not the only one that can look over the fence now all right exactly sorry now we might be on his shoulders looking over the fence all right but he wasn't the only one and you know what nobody knocked him off of it either he he was able to get up there and say this is what the circus is this is I can see it all and then what he was saying was was come on up here where I'm at right okay come on up here where I'm at and you can see the same things that I see now listen we're not prophets but we are we do have a prophetic message and to preach a prophetic message you got to be prophetic right you got to be up you got to be in a prophetic ministering I'm talking about the whole any ministry that's true is a prophetic mission it's a prophet he can see further and I've always said the reason that brother Brown he said let's go back in the back from part of God's mind is that God allowed him into a place like I said we can see but like I said he he didn't say I'm going back in the back part of God's mind he said let's let's he opened the door let's go back into the back part of God's mind in other words come on with me because remember if he went up into the mind of God and he's the only one that did that we can't even understand what he says right right we've got to come into that Mind Of God that's why this this here this son of God logoth to me covers everything because that logos was standing in eternity and he's the one that did the speaking so he had the intelligence not that God wasn't intelligent he just dropped down into the form to where you are intelligence can understand that all right then what we do is we take the book and we read between the lines and we see exactly what he's talking about because remember God said a lot of things in the Bible to confuse the wise Intruder right that's what the scripture says all right uh when he was standing there I said eat my flesh and drink my blood I mean you know you get up and you start preaching a sermon and this guy gets up and he says you got to eat my flesh and drink my blood you're this man he lost out the door you're going wait a minute but the problem with those people they didn't have the mind of God they had the mind of intellect of a man right got that they had the carnal mind of the intellect of man now I believe when Peter and Paul got born again they saw that and said that's communion yeah the flesh and the blood the wine and the wafer not the wafer like the Catholic said but the wine and the bread because that's what Jesus said he summed it all up that night at the at the Last Supper he said this is my body that's been broken for you well what was he saying eat my flesh in his body his flesh yes okay but you know literally then he says this is my body which is broken for you this is my blood which so he was telling them the same thing he said it was just then a revelation a higher revelation when he was out there among the people he said eat my flesh and drink my blood walked off when he got in the upper room with the disciples that was going to take this Revelation to the other Christian after Jesus left he had to explain it a little bit better but remember I've always said before Peter was there James John all those people were there but not one of them explained it in the scripture Paul was not there he said I have received of the Lord what happened on that night I have arrested why Paul was he was a prophet he could go up a little bit higher and see what even what Peter and then Peter were sitting there when he said that and I'm sure it quickened to a degree to Peter but Paul had the perfect understanding yeah Paul said I have received the Lord that which you know in other words that which they did that night I'm going to explain to you what they've done Jesus Took bread and said this is my body which is broken for you this is my blood you just do in remembrance of me so it was explained by what Paul with the new birth now Paul that was running around having Christians put in prison he didn't understand that but when Paul was born again he probably had listen I he probably was sitting in a sermon one day because remember there was no written there was no battle remember there was no Bible in Paul's age Paul was writing the Bible Peter was writing the Bible each one was writing the Bible but it wasn't correlated it's where Paul could sit down only the Old Testament so Paul could but see he may have sat in a sermon one day and Peter said you know who lives in the upper room Jesus said this is my blood what you said for you because of that communion remember the Bible says the the disciples had communion after the day of Pentecost they had communion together all right so what he was doing was but see it might not it wasn't revealed to Peter to write it down it was revealed to Paul to write in the book of Corinthians so that we can understand it more Peter may have been a little more crude kind of like me you know Peter was a little crude guy but Paul was able to explain it because remember remember if Paul wrote it in the Bible and it's in the word of God somebody needed that right in that way and that form that it was spoken they needed it that way not the way Peter had been preaching for probably 10 or 15 years Peter would probably preach him we gotta take communion Jesus City to eat my flesh and he might have never said eat my flesh and drink my blood but he might have said Jesus said for us to break bread and drink wine as a communion and Remembrance and Peter is struck him one day and he said that's what Jesus was talking about so he took to the Corinthians and he penned I have received of the Lord what the Lord revealed to him right what was going on but now remember like I said Peter probably preached it to a lot of people but God said well Peter you're not saying it in the right way you're using a lot of your a lot of your words but Paul I'm gonna put that in here because that's the perfect way to say it yeah because remember you say well well sometimes I don't understand listen you gotta you gotta remember one thing this is what God Said and this is what people get salvation from not from an interpretation of this but sure when the between the line part but not another written interpretation it's not another written bible somewhere else like the Mormons have another you know another Bible or another revelation of Jesus Christ I thought there was only one revelation hey man I just want to ask him one time I said look I had two girls that were Mormon I said that's your Bible they gave me one I got one at home somewhere and it's another revelation of Jesus Christ that's what it says and I said how many times because I knew that the thing had been changed since Joseph Smith supposedly got these golden tablets like Moses did he supposedly got these tablets and this Angel Moroni came and and when I turned the Bible open the first thing it says it says John Smith was met by Jesus and God both okay so I knew then I said well it's false from here on further from right there forward I don't I don't have to read this if God and Jesus appeared to one guy I wasn't gonna say no more but I did I asked him I said look how many times has that thing been changed been changed like 1100 times since it was written and just in the 18 or 1700s been changed because what they evolved when they see something different because remember they thought they won the 144 pounds so once they grew to 145 000 they said we've got to change their Doctrine there's more of us but remember Joseph Smith brother Robert never say anything about about him he said the Methodist will give an account for killing him because imagine this is the ones that killed Joseph Smith they shot him on his way out to to where they were going to Utah or wherever they Salt Lake City that's why Brigham Young took over when they shot Joseph Smith and killed him he said they'll have to give an account for that but Joseph Smith in his mind he read the Bible and he said that's 144 000. well they probably wouldn't but a hundred it's that time he thought man we get 144 pounds we want to go in the Raptor they gotta kept going he kept going to 145 000 and they had to change it well that's not who we are we're not the 144 now so you see their their Bible evolved see God don't evolve to us we have to evolve to him right what they were doing they were evolved they were taking God and saying no God didn't really mean that he meant this you know but no you take this I told him I said look this thing's not been changed and I said this is where I got my salvation from I don't need another revelation of Jesus and and gone both standing at the same time I don't need it all right but this is all I need this is where I got mine from sure it's nice to read all these other things but there's no quickening power behind it no quickening power behind anything but the word of God everybody got that so that's where that's where I believe that this Son of God the logos is so important because it's the beginning it's the parts you can understand the part we can all understand because remember if an illiterate person can receive the new birth now you literal person can't read but blessed is he that here so you can hear the word of God you can hear a preacher and never been able to read that but what's he saying to you he's saying what's in here right he's saying what's in here and when he says what's in there and somebody says like I said for Harry rock that ain't nothing but the truth now Harry's name wasn't in the Bible Hattie Rock's kids what name of the name wasn't in the Bible but ask anything in my name yeah say to this mountain be moved say to this mountain because brother Brown said whatever you say you know what I'm saying he didn't say say it to me and I'll say it he said whatever you say he said she could have asked for a million dollars and God would have filled that table with a million dollars right she had entered into a wall that God said whenever you asked and then he went on further and said whatever you say to this man if you say to this Mountain Bee move because he broke around he moved to that he said I couldn't really understand he said whatever you say because God told him said what do you want he said well I'm hunting squirrel and I believe brother roundman is in his Humanity he was waiting on God to say well let there be because that's the man that created he said let there be and God said I'm waiting on you yeah but what was it it was the mind of God being transmitted to a man right and I don't think he was so special I think he was the first fruit he was the one that's that that God could show that you could do that through a human voice but you and I have the same abilities what I'm trying to get saved you and I have that same ability because if the Creator lives in you that makes you a program said we were a little creative but you're only a little Creator when the Creator's in you you can't be a little Creator when that's not in you because remember this is what this is the creator this right here created all things amen the Son of God the logos was the creator because he said what let there be let there be let there be now remember when the son of man came on the earth and we'll get back to this in a little bit we're going to stay with the Son of God for a little while the son of man never created while he was on earth now remember the Creator was in this man but he never you know there was even in the book of Maccabees that's my brother around said it was wrong the book of Maccabees is just a historical view of what went on when Jesus was there but they said to Jesus one time it was reported that he threw some sand up in the air and birds flew out if it's not in the word I ain't gonna believe it okay so what I'm saying is is the creator was in the son of man but his but his dispensation and his order was was to be an Earthly man anybody got that that's why I said Son of Man Son of God is his spirit this is Spirit here right right this is Spirit God this is we're going to put some flesh on him down here but remember when he was here on Earth he always used the word or something that was already there that's right sure the creative power went through the bread and the fish but he didn't create the bread and then feed the five thousand he took something that was already there because he was a son of man so he took something that man had already done all right same way with us he took something that man had already made now the creative power began to like brother Brown said watch cell broke when he handed that bread to the disciples and it was probably it was probably went from cold to warm you know when he was creating that bread shirt but he took something that was already there okay same thing with you and I when he creates in us a clean heart and all these things we're talking about creating it's the same bread same bread you got it yeah yeah but God by creative power what breaks his word to you and I and this doesn't get bigger this doesn't get more honorable right brother Dale's been telling us stuff five outside senses has zero to do with anything it's just something to hold you together honestly to hold all your organs together and your brain and all that stuff it just it holds you together on Earth because you think that my my soul if I was to die today you didn't have to have to open the door to get my soul out passes into another dimension right but now that can go but remember when you come from here to here back to here that man had Flash and he went right on through we just need to step right on there I don't think he even hesitated because look if you hesitate there's fear right amen Jesus didn't go well maybe no he just went right on through that wall he had the power remember he said all power and Heaven and Earth has been given unto me heaven and earth foreign we'll get into that because because there is a difference between these three but the only difference is is mine and your understanding not God 's not different he's the same but in our understanding of the development into our brain and from the Bible we have to come from and know that God is the spirit that's what Jesus said God is your spirit and that it works to be much worship me spirit and in truth right but it's not a spirit like a like a just like a sheet you know when we as humans when we think of spirit the first thing you think about I do is like Casper the Friendly Ghost something's floating by and a white sheet you know just floating here floating there you know we gotta no God's a man because we were created in His image up here not down here you understand that we were created in a damage when he was in the logos form right right so that logos form was like was a man a human being if not we if not we weren't made any damage right and we'll get into something when we come down to the son of man because it was asking me it's just something to think about and we'll go something to think about a a certain person asked me one time said well why were we put in this form flesh with with um we're all human I mean all adults with with our organs with our sex organ you know why when we created this way if this is not the way we were supposed to be remember brother Brown said when you move that 126 man into the 2-7 man we'll read it because I read it another day he said that's animal flesh this is a higher form of this was the in in Creative Evolution this is where God stopped right here but if the if the chain of evolution Creative Evolution was that there were male and female dogs with their fleshly organs you understand what I'm saying rest and private part then when God put that 126 man into the 2-7 man there was Adam sure they were naked they were covered by Holy Ghost Veil to where Adam didn't have a lustful Spirit even didn't have a lustable spirit but you know what they can do they can stand and watch all those animals because they were procreated there's nothing wrong with an animal procreating because if they didn't listen somebody said one time said how do you know that they were procreating I said one thing for sure God took this and killed I took him to the court where brother Brown said God killed the animal the lamb threw the skins in I said now if I'd been the only two animals the only two Lambs there's no more lamb right because remember God was finished creating right right so they were all procreating before all this was going on okay so there's nothing wrong with procreation but God but you'll realize one thing soul that soul of man is different from the animal the animal can walk down this road they can they can mate right out here and you go well that's wonderful they're gonna have puppies all right now if a man and a woman went out there and did that what you do you'd call law same Act right man goes walking naked through Walmart they take him to the jail you take a dog a male dog through there and you understand what a no man you make a male dog through there and there's this part hanging everywhere and you go all your beautiful little dog you play you don't think nothing about that wine our carnal mind is what killed us all right it's the difference of the Soul God put a soul in a man to no rap or wrong that animal don't know right from wrong that's right but that's the way God created them people so we have to deal let them deal with that right remarriaging divorce brother Man's real clear you know they just were there just for the puppies and there's no you know there's no shame right I mean in that crew you watch them you watch them mate and you go well that's beautiful we're gonna have some puppies now little man and a woman go do that out of the public you'll go I'll put them in jail why because we have a conscience we know right from wrong because remember God said they'll you'll know good and evil or Satan they said you're no good and evil so you see we gotta but see we have to come from here if we didn't come down into flesh that couldn't we could have never fail but God had to put us in flesh to contact the Earth right God had to put us in flesh and it had to be the highest form of animal flesh that's why we're
