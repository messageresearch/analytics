[2:09] with you and we we just try to go on as
[2:12] much as we can with a normal form of
[2:15] services and things too until time comes
[2:18] and they get through with all of their
[2:20] doings with the government or whatever
[2:22] then it'll be alright but we don't know
[2:25] we had talked about maybe having this
[2:28] coming to Easter services we still got
[2:30] to check that out so you that are
[2:33] listening that would be able to drive up
[2:34] on next Sunday you know or drive to come
[2:39] we would start like 10 o'clock or
[2:41] something like that we'd have a service
[2:43] and have that people outside sitting in
[2:45] your cars and hook up a system to where
[2:47] that we can do and all and we won't be
[2:49] doing in the church we'll be doing that
[2:51] away so just keep keep a listening ear
[2:55] until we find out we'd love to how
[2:57] services called it to me it I know I've
[3:00] been able to be here every service but
[3:01] when you're not able to come to everyone
[3:03] it gets kind of wondering what types
[3:05] what happened to that day you miss it
[3:07] during all but just yes we're doing the
[3:10] best we can and working from that and
[3:13] just you at home just listen in and do
[3:16] that just like you would do here respect
[3:19] and everything and do everything you
[3:21] know connected around the service don't
[3:24] be running and going and doing dire in
[3:26] your home you know do it just like it be
[3:29] in his regular services and that way we
[3:32] can all have a good time too in the Lord
[3:34] and the presence of the Lord would be
[3:36] with this honor if you like turning your
[3:37] scriptures turn to Luke 17 and we'll
[3:41] begin reading about verse 20
[3:42] - and through 20 well through 30 I guess
[3:47] we had mark 37 well we'll go all the way
[3:49] so do that father we thank you for this
[3:53] day in your grace and we thank you for
[3:55] your love and took each one of us we ask
[3:57] you now that you would just come among
[3:59] us in a mighty way and open our eyes to
[4:02] that understanding of that word
[4:04] that's your light and love Lord be with
[4:06] us we thank you for these opportunity
[4:09] that we have here Lord to use the
[4:12] internet systems and things like that to
[4:15] be able to steel house services and have
[4:17] a good time to fellowship in you so just
[4:20] have your way with each and every one of
[4:22] us that you're loving grace be with us
[4:24] forgive our sins in order to remember
[4:27] each one be a brother dict our Lord
[4:29] they're saying that he has just a short
[4:31] time to live so we know who the true
[4:35] liver is and the one that would take
[4:36] care of all the time so you just
[4:38] manifest yourself that's your loving
[4:40] grace be with him and then remember all
[4:43] the others father we love you and we
[4:45] thank you in Jesus name
[4:47] you mean like to go to verse 22 we'll
[4:51] read this because the reason is reading
[4:54] so much of it is because you'll see that
[4:57] it covers the entire Bible that was the
[5:01] purpose of choosing this because as we
[5:04] will get to it in a minute when we get
[5:07] to the facts we're saying like son of
[5:08] man son of God son of David we just
[5:11] remember each one of those had a
[5:12] position in their time and see he was
[5:16] son of man as in the Old Testament as
[5:20] Jehovah God you know that would still be
[5:22] counted as son of man the Prophet all
[5:26] right then you go to son of God in their
[5:29] ages and then son of David in the
[5:32] Millennium so keep those in mind that's
[5:34] reason were reading the whole thing here
[5:36] alright and he said unto the disciples
[5:38] the days will come when you shall desire
[5:42] to see the days of the Son of Man and ye
[5:45] shall not see it he is coming down he
[5:47] was fixing to be crucified they shall
[5:49] say unto you see hear or see there go
[5:53] not after them nor follow them see
[5:56] coming on down to where we're at now
[5:58] president lightning that light us out of
[6:01] the one part under heaven shina 'then to
[6:04] the other part under heaven so shall
[6:07] also the Son of Man be in his day is he
[6:11] all right now that's going to be back
[6:14] there but it's going to be in over here
[6:17] ok but first must he suffer many things
[6:20] and be rejected of this generation had
[6:25] to be crucified and as it was in the
[6:27] days of Noah so shall it be also in the
[6:30] days of the son of man they did eat they
[6:34] drank they married wives they were given
[6:36] in marriage until the day that Noah
[6:38] entered into the ark and the flood came
[6:41] and destroyed them all see coming down
[6:43] to our day now ok
[6:44] likewise also as it was in the days of
[6:48] lot they did eat they drank they bought
[6:50] they sold they planted they builded but
[6:54] the same day that lot went out of Sodom
[6:56] it rained fire and brimstone from heaven
[6:59] and destroyed them all even thus shall
[7:02] it be in the day when the Son of Man is
[7:06] revealed or is he coming even to the
[7:09] great destruction and finishing all
[7:12] things of in that day he which shall be
[7:16] upon the housetop and his stuff in the
[7:19] house that have not come down to take it
[7:22] away in he that is in the field that him
[7:26] likewise not returned back remember
[7:29] Lot's wife who so ever shall seek to
[7:33] save his life shall lose it and
[7:35] whosoever shall lose his life shall
[7:37] preserve it I tell you in that night
[7:41] there shall be two men in one bed once
[7:45] you'll be taken you know to see a secret
[7:47] rapture come on sorry two women shall be
[7:50] grinding together the one shall be taken
[7:52] the other left two men shall be in the
[7:54] field one shall be taken and the other
[7:56] left they answered and said unto him
[8:00] were Lord in other words not they were
[8:06] saying when but the word is were
[8:09] because it covers so much all right you
[8:14] know you understand why I'm reading this
[8:16] to show you this comes through the Old
[8:18] Testament through the church ages out
[8:20] into where we're at and finishes it all
[8:22] up so it doesn't say when to bring it it
[8:26] says were we're Lord and you sent them
[8:29] to them or whatever the body is there
[8:33] will the eagle's be gathered together
[8:35] you may be seated to the Lord that is
[8:37] blessing to the reading of the word hmm
[8:40] you know I want to try to keep on the
[8:47] thought with us and trying to hold it
[8:50] into a yeah a part that we can
[8:54] understand and then we'll pick up some
[8:55] more things we have a couple of more
[8:57] messages or no to go with this coming on
[9:01] out and we've been talking about how the
[9:04] bride is part of the mystery all right
[9:08] go to cry so mister God revealed read
[9:10] that message over and over Christ is
[9:13] part of the mystery all right how many
[9:16] times as I said to you how many times
[9:18] his brother Brendan said all God was he
[9:21] ported the cross all Christ he poured
[9:24] into the church and to take her back see
[9:27] all right because it's a great mystery
[9:30] to wind up in the end to see the you and
[9:33] I are part of that mystery the
[9:35] indwelling are in grafton of the
[9:37] Gentiles I said the other day that's the
[9:39] great mystery that was bringing into the
[9:41] Gentiles it would just barely spoken all
[9:43] throughout the Old Testament all right
[9:45] and brought into view
[9:46] but just remember now what we're talking
[9:48] about here the final final lysing are
[9:52] bringing the this mystery to the great
[9:57] mystery of revelations 10 and through
[9:59] there then we're talking about the bride
[10:02] being part of the mystery alright see
[10:05] the Gentiles will spoke of down through
[10:07] the ages and we we're a lot of times
[10:09] just take you know the Gentiles being
[10:13] well that's the mystery well that's
[10:15] great that's that's alright we do but
[10:17] just remember there's plenty of Jews is
[10:21] into this too
[10:22] so remember coming down as I said we'll
[10:25] get to it in a minute and try to
[10:27] emphasize that part or you know express
[10:30] it to talk about how that he was son of
[10:34] man the Prophet Old Testament you call
[10:38] it Jehovah God you know or whatever
[10:40] you'd want to but it's really dealing
[10:43] with the son of man cuz he talked about
[10:45] those prophets then we can see there
[10:47] that the mystery was more than as trying
[10:50] to express more than just the Gentiles
[10:52] being brought in it was to see the
[10:55] complete mystery of what the whole
[10:57] entire Bible is about and bringing in
[11:01] the mystery of Christ being revealed in
[11:04] his church all right now and that's what
[11:06] we're trying to hold the point to okay
[11:10] all right now let me say it to you like
[11:14] this see we say well well you know
[11:18] you've emphasized the mystery you Vince
[11:20] massaged the point of God coming and
[11:24] living in his church and and all in your
[11:27] you'll be going in to the fullness of
[11:29] the Godhead bodily and talking about the
[11:31] Son of Man and and the things like that
[11:34] but let me say it to you like this why
[11:38] would you not agree with the word now
[11:45] listen why would we all of us not agree
[11:50] with the word if we're part of the word
[11:54] I see being part of the word why would
[12:02] we not agree with it well you know I
[12:04] just don't know about this about the
[12:06] bride being the fullness and the son of
[12:08] man and the things like that you know
[12:10] you know I just that's just making a
[12:13] little bit too much out of the bride
[12:15] were how would it be the entire Bible is
[12:17] the revelation of Jesus Christ in His
[12:20] Church and the bride we look back and we
[12:26] see Ruth as a Gentile that's great but
[12:30] just remember you got the whole story of
[12:33] Naomi
[12:35] to be put with Ruth to come forth to see
[12:40] that it's more than just see he was
[12:42] redeeming he wasn't let me say it
[12:45] correctly mote Boaz didn't go out and
[12:48] redeem Ruth he couldn't do it that away
[12:52] he had to redeem Naomi all right and in
[12:57] doing that then he could claim what was
[13:00] of that that Ruth would be involved so
[13:03] then there's the mystery see you got
[13:06] more room in Surrey you got more you
[13:08] said well the in grafton of the Jew of
[13:10] the Gentiles you got Ruth no right but
[13:12] you got Naomi the boys had to actually
[13:17] take Naomi not has his wife we'd say but
[13:24] took his her possessions her properties
[13:28] her things that belong to her that was
[13:32] granted to her you know about her
[13:34] husband being a Jew and and the things
[13:36] like that all right now you keep that
[13:39] thought in mind and you'll see why I'm
[13:41] saying why would we not agree with the
[13:44] word and what it's speaking of if we are
[13:49] that word and I thought that was what we
[13:54] were supposed to be all right now what's
[13:59] this now and if you do not agree with
[14:02] the word then it would be sure to show
[14:07] you that you're not part of the word
[14:11] right you're not part of it
[14:14] if you don't believe it well I just
[14:17] never have heard it before well now you
[14:19] hearing it now so you know now open up
[14:22] your ears of understanding and start
[14:24] trying to believe it because we're in
[14:26] the last days we were to the point to
[14:30] where this thing's and closed out any
[14:31] day you sold no it can't well it's
[14:34] already closed pretty good all it is
[14:36] takes is just a pen and that's it you're
[14:39] you hear this that or the other just put
[14:42] it in you know I'm not a doomsday try to
[14:46] scare you - nothing like that
[14:48] there's one thing about it we should
[14:49] realize we should all agree that someday
[14:54] I think even the Baptist Methodist
[14:57] Presbyterian someday it's going to come
[15:01] to an end well they don't know the
[15:05] mystery see the mystery of this already
[15:10] come to an end because it's being made
[15:13] manifest in the bride what the prophets
[15:15] say about how did he's that first he
[15:18] does it then he reveals it makes it
[15:22] known does it reveals it and makes it
[15:25] known so if he's making it known it's
[15:28] already here first we're concerned it's
[15:31] already over that's my whole point of
[15:35] like a brother asked me you know what
[15:37] was myself
[15:37] I think positive I think right here now
[15:41] this is it if not when when is that
[15:44] gonna get here and I'll do like brother
[15:47] Brown said let me keep this until that
[15:49] gets here let me rejoice in this let me
[15:53] be uplifted in you know all of this to
[15:58] see whether we're here or not and what
[16:01] the Prophet is saying I go ahead and
[16:02] pull up number one brothers and we'll
[16:04] just get a little bit of something I
[16:09] want you to think on because we remember
[16:13] the question now why would we not agree
[16:16] with the word if we are the word and if
[16:19] we are the word then set we say we don't
[16:22] agree with that well I just can't
[16:26] believe that why it's the entire Bible
[16:31] why why would it not me now look what
[16:35] the prophet has to say about it go ahead
[16:37] and roll it up to her the same ministry
[16:41] that Jesus had Jesus had is in his
[16:45] church tonight same sign same wonder
[16:47] same spirit well I just don't see that
[16:50] we'll see now you don't believe it
[16:51] I thought you supposed to believe it I
[16:54] wouldn't believe the see not seem to
[16:56] believe on look same sign same wonder
[17:01] saying
[17:02] spirit same kind of works that Jesus did
[17:04] here on the earth earth the church has
[17:07] to do the same thing if it's not if you
[17:13] don't agree that it's going on now read
[17:16] what your prophet said or tear that out
[17:19] all right because he said if it's not
[17:24] it's not the seed of Abraham it's not
[17:28] the Church of Jesus Christ can't be
[17:31] let's see no we don't like for that to
[17:34] be said that strong why we're at the end
[17:41] of all things that be number one but yet
[17:45] when are we gonna start believing the
[17:46] Bible is speaking of us
[17:51] I was giving the illustration our the
[17:52] other day how did the Prophet say we're
[17:54] supposed to speak about healing by His
[17:57] stripes Rhine is healed put your name
[18:00] dart well why can't you put your name in
[18:02] Genesis one that we just want to pick
[18:10] out a little bit of things from the
[18:11] Bible to make our own thoughts why can't
[18:15] we believe all of it
[18:17] see because believing all of it then
[18:20] we'll come out to see it as a finished
[18:22] product
[18:22] all right look at number two go ahead
[18:29] man now God is trying to find a church
[18:34] that he can project his word true you
[18:38] see God watches over his word to to
[18:43] vindicate it and how can he vindicate it
[18:46] when we deny that it's the truth if you
[18:53] don't believe the minister of Jesus
[18:56] Christ is here in the same way except
[19:01] for the corporal body or whatever you
[19:02] want take it of that if you don't
[19:05] believe that then how can you believe in
[19:08] to be Hebrews 13:8
[19:11] well I don't see it well that's what I'm
[19:14] saying
[19:15] you're looking for something to try to
[19:17] prove it instead of believing it and
[19:20] letting God take care of the proof it is
[19:24] not up to you and I to vindicate God's
[19:26] Word the God had already Finnegan it's
[19:29] up to us to believe it is vindicated and
[19:33] to believe that it's talking about us
[19:40] talking about who we are what we're
[19:43] doing here the whole Bible is that way
[19:46] the whole Old Testament whole New
[19:48] Testament everything is speaking of the
[19:50] bride of Jesus Christ and she's part of
[19:55] the mystery and remember if she's part
[19:58] of the mystery she's got to be revealed
[20:01] do we believe it that strong that
[20:06] dogmatic or what you'd want to use the
[20:09] terminologies of being so stern to say
[20:12] this is it or are we waiting on somebody
[20:16] else to come along
[20:17] we're waiting on this to happen we're
[20:19] working on that to happen
[20:21] and then we'll believe it what if God's
[20:24] waiting on us to believe it where he can
[20:26] make it manifest if not see did we wind
[20:36] up denying the word if you say in a way
[20:42] he's the same
[20:44] run-run said that's enough such a sign
[20:45] you can't say in a way it's not in a way
[20:48] he's either the same or he's not well I
[20:53] could believe it back in when brother
[20:55] Branham was here
[20:56] thank God I could too if I'd have been
[20:58] there no I'd love to seen those days but
[21:03] I have the Bible that puts it in a more
[21:05] positive attitude because it's what does
[21:07] it say blessed are they that believe
[21:10] that have not seen okay they were not
[21:21] trying to make somebody believe
[21:22] something or
[21:23] convinced you the new birth is the only
[21:27] thing that can convince you of anything
[21:28] being right or wrong anyway we'll see
[21:33] it's time to stand up to the point
[21:35] because what if the next what if the
[21:37] next move is something that they say we
[21:40] can't come to church at all what are we
[21:46] gonna do I mean what if they come in and
[21:49] say you can't house services like you're
[21:51] having them what are you gonna do
[21:58] we better get prepared now I think this
[22:02] has been the 50 years a sense of going
[22:04] of the profit and and the things for you
[22:06] and I too got prepared to study this
[22:13] thing out to the to see and understand
[22:16] where we're at and what's going on and
[22:19] see our day in this it's messy see that
[22:24] way then you know I do I emphasize over
[22:28] and over because that's what I want it
[22:30] to be I want it to be to her that you
[22:34] and I know who we are
[22:39] my brother dick and I used to talk about
[22:41] it it's pretty good to talk about what
[22:43] you believe until they stick the gun to
[22:44] the head and said what do you believe
[22:46] you know can change a lot of thinking
[22:51] but if we're not ready now we won't be
[22:53] ready then do you realize that it's a
[22:58] very dangerous situation for someone to
[23:01] hang around this message without coming
[23:03] in and accepting it and being true
[23:06] it can mean their death that just hang
[23:11] around it at least let me believe it let
[23:18] me let me say it's true and believe that
[23:20] to be true and stand on it all right
[23:24] see that's that's my whole point of
[23:26] trying to get us to to talk about this
[23:28] look at number three
[23:33] it's taking these few and then
[23:36] get into a little thought in a minute go
[23:39] ahead and roll it on up till we get
[23:41] there you go said oh brother now listen
[23:45] to this I remember years ago quote in
[23:49] there some people said where'd you get
[23:50] that I said the Prophet said it well I
[23:55] mean you know a lot of times I said the
[23:57] Prophet said it and and I couldn't
[23:58] produce it Carter didn't have enough
[24:00] memory to be able do it and it took a
[24:01] while to produce it and I remember one
[24:04] brother one time he said something I see
[24:06] that ain't right
[24:07] he said well work the Prophet said I
[24:10] said I don't know but I'll find it well
[24:12] I did one day and I laid it down I said
[24:14] now read it you know not being arrogant
[24:18] or hateful or whatever being trying to
[24:20] get me not to think about what's going
[24:22] on hey look what he said
[24:24] oh brother give me a church full of the
[24:30] Holy Ghost God will do in one year we're
[24:34] all theologies I guess what Vanessa
[24:36] failed to do in 2,000 years now listen
[24:41] you wait till the anointing of the
[24:46] church really strikes strikes home to
[24:55] that fateful little remnant now watch
[24:58] him he's putting more of a time element
[25:03] situation may be laying within this
[25:05] anointing that we should consider after
[25:10] the doors of the Gentiles is closed well
[25:16] brother Dale I thought we supposed to
[25:18] get out here for the door the Gentiles
[25:19] closed a lot of words you get that out I
[25:21] mean bring that to me I'd like to read
[25:24] it I can read this so you're not looking
[25:28] at it the way that the Prophet is
[25:30] bringing after the doors agenda on this
[25:32] quote Oh God would have known a church
[25:34] then he whose filthy let him be filthy
[25:36] still he who's righteous let him be
[25:38] righteous feel and then he who is holy
[25:40] let him be holy still
[25:41] and God will anoint the church with the
[25:44] power of God and things will be taken
[25:47] place not only
[25:50] that then but he's doing it now all
[25:56] right
[25:57] he's doing it now you remember how we
[26:00] lay down the anointing and things like
[26:02] that summer Jesus was anointed on the
[26:04] River Jordan sure he became the fullness
[26:08] of the Godhead bodily
[26:09] yes not that he wasn't God already not
[26:14] that he wasn't already the fullness and
[26:15] all but it's just a statement when that
[26:17] anointing came on him I've tried to
[26:20] emphasize to you see they couldn't kill
[26:21] him why light of morning was on him but
[26:25] now we're not anointing left him in the
[26:26] Garden of Gethsemane he was subject to
[26:28] death and died that's how much they're
[26:32] known here but what about you and me
[26:34] what about that same anointing come into
[26:36] you in me what do you think it was done
[26:40] the anointing came on him in the garden
[26:42] I mean came on him at the river and it
[26:45] left him in the garden or to be able to
[26:48] come back on me and you sure it's the
[26:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost that has made
[26:53] us down through all of this time but now
[26:55] look at the Prophet how he's emphasizing
[26:57] it that something's gonna happen that
[27:00] God will unknown a church one time he
[27:06] was saying I hate it easy to be very
[27:08] short well short period of time a long
[27:13] time that's fine all right
[27:15] when the main thing is is we better be
[27:17] ready for the time you know and see it's
[27:22] not ready for the time like we we tried
[27:24] to do everything else try to get
[27:26] everything in order try to do this try
[27:27] to do that it's not that away that much
[27:30] I've emphasized to you a lot of things
[27:32] over the 50 years that I've been
[27:34] pastoring I think you ought to be
[27:36] sensible I think you order to work upon
[27:40] not being so head over heels in debt
[27:43] especially when you don't need it for 3
[27:46] or 4 new cars you know you understand my
[27:48] emphasis you know there's not no problem
[27:51] about being in debt as long as you make
[27:54] your payments that's no problem
[27:55] all right but see get prepared I've
[28:00] always told the church to not to not to
[28:02] be a
[28:03] a church you know that's out there the
[28:05] one that stores up the year supply food
[28:07] ain't talking about that I'm done not
[28:09] just being sensible new order see how
[28:13] sensible that I've been who would have
[28:16] ever thought toilet paper would become
[28:18] to be a dollar a roll or more and you
[28:28] think that I'm just being ho he just
[28:30] don't trust God he don't trust God God's
[28:35] gonna take care of us well he might give
[28:40] you enough sense to buy a couple extra
[28:42] can of Green Bay I mean beans and put
[28:44] them up in the cabinet because when the
[28:48] power goes off no wonder like I've
[28:51] always told you we're done on the end of
[28:52] the road when the power goes off we're
[28:54] the last one to get it back
[28:55] I got a generator system I got all kind
[28:59] of thing but why just for surviving now
[29:04] you know and it's good to have you go
[29:09] down to baselet and get a can of beans
[29:10] and you know put it on and cook it now
[29:13] some deed that's that's where no
[29:16] depression we're not talking about
[29:17] depression er we're talking about normal
[29:20] everyday living it's good to how things
[29:23] provide it a little bit right then when
[29:28] you need it you got it you ain't gotta
[29:31] worry about it that's that's not being
[29:32] well you don't trust the Lord yeah I'm
[29:35] like all of these others and I've tried
[29:37] my best to be honest with people when
[29:40] when the brothers this message you know
[29:43] what I'm talking about a lot of them
[29:44] said I ain't gonna pay no income tax
[29:49] children of the King don't pay no taxes
[29:52] you know I ain't even played on taxes
[29:55] well it didn't pay any they're poor old
[29:57] wives wind up cleaning homes and I
[29:59] remember once I got in mind she's she
[30:01] was well over 80 years old still having
[30:03] to work why because her husband didn't
[30:06] pay no taxes you know what I told her
[30:09] husband and told all them of rent
[30:11] because they was around here and hanging
[30:12] about it you say well the children of
[30:16] the King don't pay no taxes
[30:18] how about the king paying taxes
[30:21] oh that's sarcastic and now it's true
[30:25] Jesus told Peter go down there and take
[30:27] this hook and flick it over in there and
[30:29] said come back and pay your taxes and
[30:33] mine too
[30:34] you said well that was a different okay
[30:36] you can argue different in country
[30:38] outcomes or whatever I ain't arguing
[30:40] with you about it I just made their
[30:42] statements back then I said you're
[30:43] you're failing on what you're doing but
[30:45] it didn't change it you know what love
[30:48] you know the people's personally because
[30:50] she was around a lot of it didn't change
[30:51] it well I'm not against him I didn't
[30:53] down them and beat him to death about it
[30:55] I just always said that's the sensible I
[31:00] think it ought to be sensible to just
[31:02] work that you say well I I need to do
[31:04] this I need to make sure and get my
[31:06] bills paid up he's everything to running
[31:08] good you know we can get by without this
[31:11] new car honey well we'll do that might
[31:14] even get better without that now but
[31:20] there's nothing wrong
[31:23] come on your prophet told us there's
[31:26] nothing wrong with this as long as you
[31:27] can make them
[31:28] that's nothing wrong with it it's not a
[31:32] problem don't you pay you - no me
[31:36] neither
[31:37] that's fine okay all right we get off of
[31:39] that part because see what did he say
[31:45] that God will anoint a church it's gonna
[31:49] come to a certain spot in time I don't
[31:51] know what that spot in time is when that
[31:53] spot in time is I don't know I don't
[31:56] believe you need to know that away I
[31:58] believe you just need to be prepared for
[32:00] that you know you've got a spare tire on
[32:03] your car and I dare say that any of us
[32:08] ever even checks to our pressure in the
[32:11] spare tire I have well what if I need it
[32:19] well
[32:25] the main thing that I'm trying to get
[32:27] you to say is exactly what I'm gonna
[32:30] read right here now let's go ahead with
[32:33] number four taken from the message
[32:38] oneness he's explaining the never her
[32:44] that kills you out yeah but we just
[32:48] receive enough Holy Ghost in us to make
[32:51] us to a place where we don't want to lie
[32:54] we don't want to steal we don't want to
[32:57] do anything but God wants to fill every
[33:02] fiber of his being I mean it sure felt
[33:06] fiber of his church he wants to feel
[33:09] you're thinking he wants to feel your
[33:11] mind our statute of perfect man or he's
[33:13] fitting in water tumbler he wants to
[33:16] fill every bit of you just make you
[33:18] completely totally dead to yourself
[33:20] our to Europe you're thinking just to
[33:23] surrender in God till his words just
[33:26] living right through you you don't know
[33:29] nothing else but God's Word just stay
[33:32] right with his word wants to feel every
[33:36] fiber of our being stature a perfect man
[33:40] adoption etc right talks about those
[33:44] things you know is it something that
[33:50] he's trying to be some different or
[33:52] something no it's expected
[33:58] it's expected of a Christian alright now
[34:03] listen I want to emphasize something but
[34:08] I want you to thank with me because
[34:11] we're gonna connect a little bit with
[34:12] with the Bible and bring it in to the
[34:16] way that it would lay out you know your
[34:19] prophets spoke of son of God son of man
[34:21] son of David that's not three gods
[34:24] that's God changing this form from one
[34:27] form to another
[34:29] alright and he started out in the Old
[34:33] Testament as Jehovah God yes Jehovah God
[34:37] was water a prophet talked about the
[34:40] prophets sons men was prophet all right
[34:45] and see now once he had to come in that
[34:48] way to die because son of god couldn't
[34:51] die son of david couldn't die but he had
[34:56] to come in that form to where he could
[34:58] die and the only way he could do it
[35:00] would be to come the son of man all
[35:03] right and then when it would come forth
[35:05] into that order then he could face
[35:09] everything and be crucified and give his
[35:12] life and things like that we just
[35:15] remember where you'd ever thought them
[35:17] that idea the son of man was was the Old
[35:21] Testament prophets but that was Almighty
[35:25] God through those prophets not them
[35:30] being God but God working through those
[35:34] prophets getting ready to come to a time
[35:39] that he could give his life that son of
[35:43] man like I said he couldn't do it a son
[35:46] of God he couldn't do it his son of
[35:48] David he had to come the son of man to
[35:54] be able to be crucified
[35:55] alright now to take that point now let's
[36:00] just read a little bit go ahead to the
[36:01] number five I guess he did the trial now
[36:09] watch what he's saying
[36:11] Jesus Christ the same yesterday today
[36:12] and forever he's identified himself as
[36:14] he promised much more can be said in
[36:16] these last days as son of man now he's
[36:19] coming to the last days because that's
[36:23] what I'm telling you you've got to have
[36:24] it and keep it in the right order to
[36:26] understand he's son of man in the Old
[36:29] Testament prophets and the thing
[36:30] son of man while he was walking on earth
[36:33] he gave his life he came back on the day
[36:36] of Pentecost the Son of God through the
[36:39] church ages the baptism with the Holy
[36:41] Ghost then he becomes son of David but
[36:44] just in between gar he comes back to
[36:47] fulfill Luke 17 30 in between the son of
[36:51] God and the son of David he has to
[36:54] return again as the prophet all right
[36:58] see the entire comes brother Branham on
[37:01] the scene he wasn't the Prophet no more
[37:04] than all of those Old Testament prophets
[37:06] were not the Prophet they were a prophet
[37:08] to make manifest the Prophet brother
[37:11] Branham was a prophet to bring forth the
[37:14] word he was not the prophet the Lord
[37:16] Jesus Christ his deep prophet so we got
[37:18] our story correctly as long we keep it
[37:20] right and if we don't win we'll go back
[37:23] and read what we started with are we
[37:25] gonna believe it no good now listen in
[37:29] these last days the son of man making
[37:31] himself known among his people in the
[37:36] form of his people and like I've always
[37:41] said it I know people they don't like to
[37:42] point but 1969 in Athens Georgia that
[37:45] was the first sermon ever preached and I
[37:48] preached on the son of man now preached
[37:51] on the bride of Jesus Christ would be
[37:54] the son of man I'll preach that then I
[38:00] still believe it today more today than I
[38:02] ever did before because I believe it's
[38:04] among the people now all right you say
[38:06] brother Branham was the son of Matt no
[38:08] for the random was a son of man the son
[38:14] of man is the Lord Jesus Christ all
[38:19] right so then you put Christ will read
[38:22] one in just a minute here you
[38:24] Christ in His Church what have you got
[38:30] see she can be the son of man he said no
[38:39] no no you're not listening brother
[38:42] branham was a son of man the one the
[38:47] word came to the Lord Jesus is the Son
[38:50] of Man put the Lord Jesus in Bride form
[38:53] now what you gotta do we believe that so
[38:59] when I just don't I don't know that's
[39:00] that's just too much putting it making
[39:02] us the son of man brother Branham was
[39:05] part of the Bride of Christ right so I'm
[39:07] not leaving him out as I was covering
[39:09] our last Sunday I'm not leaving him out
[39:11] of the story
[39:12] he's a very a main player part of the
[39:16] story because he's the one that's
[39:18] letting us know who we are but he's not
[39:22] the son of man but put all of the bride
[39:26] of Jesus Christ together you got the son
[39:30] of man you ain't got in the last days
[39:32] group of people as these on a man and
[39:34] the others left out no all the way down
[39:37] through it's been son of man but that
[39:39] was your mystery come on now that was
[39:43] part of your mystery that's trying to
[39:44] bring out the other day he said well I
[39:47] can see Martin Luther with the Holy
[39:49] Ghost well most people can't see that
[39:51] within huh you know ice can't see he's
[39:55] son of man he's not the sort of than him
[39:58] that's what he's saying here he's coming
[40:01] back in the end time for a reason he has
[40:04] to go through the acts of the play he
[40:07] was son of man in the Old Testament
[40:09] bring it then he caught crucifixion all
[40:12] of that brought him into view then he
[40:14] turned as to the seven churches as son
[40:17] of God he changes from that and son of
[40:22] David in the Millennium to the Jews see
[40:27] then it's all laid in perfect order if
[40:30] we believe it but you say well I don't
[40:35] know see that's what I'm saying back in
[40:37] the old days
[40:38] I'm telling the other day about that
[40:40] tape recorder I used to turn it with a
[40:41] pencil to make it work where we could
[40:43] listen to tapes what I was doing I was
[40:46] only it's arising the Sun and in that
[40:51] message is when it finally clicked with
[40:53] me because I could see son of man
[40:55] I could see son of God but didn't go -
[40:59] son of David
[41:01] well that just blot out in my mind see
[41:03] because I knew there was some more
[41:06] connection see then here comes it and
[41:12] we'll read it who is this son of man in
[41:14] the beginning was the word he said it
[41:19] opened all that once Timmons was riding
[41:21] down the road hey he's come back in the
[41:23] last days as the son of man right
[41:28] brother branham was a son of man but he
[41:32] was that part that was within him with
[41:35] so much close to God until that part was
[41:38] the son of God you know son of man right
[41:41] but not he himself not by belief or not
[41:45] things are those orders you can't put
[41:47] him in order but the Lord Jesus Christ
[41:51] came back in the last days through a
[41:55] prophet thank God to bring us the word
[42:02] there's your son of man what's it as
[42:06] we'll go through some time and then
[42:08] we'll pick up then you can understand
[42:09] how the bride can be the fullness of the
[42:11] Godhead bodily then you can understand
[42:14] the quote always give you worth it well
[42:17] run said the guards not complete without
[42:19] you I didn't say them things you already
[42:23] seen it during anthems and I'm looking
[42:27] more than blank faces and then that's
[42:30] okay come on we're gonna go through it
[42:31] one more time one more time the random
[42:35] is not lease on a man he's a son of me
[42:40] me you by ourselves without the fullness
[42:45] of the Godhead being in the bride
[42:51] she's not the son of men either because
[42:54] they sparks left all but once you get
[42:59] the whole puzzle together and it comes
[43:00] together you see a beautiful picture in
[43:02] these life days
[43:03] that's a man making himself known among
[43:06] his people in the form of the people now
[43:10] see that what people was arguing with me
[43:12] about it and I always had argued they
[43:14] say he was in brother branham well
[43:18] praise God I believe that that's where
[43:22] we got the message but now he's saying
[43:28] he's among his people he's in his people
[43:33] wanna see the hour that we're living see
[43:37] what's one in the form of his people are
[43:39] the M morphe changing this form what
[43:43] Brad and see you'll understand then what
[43:48] people can't follow you you get over to
[43:51] revelations 10 what did it want I'm
[43:54] running our own Novus revelation 10
[43:55] where brother Branham says revelations 1
[43:59] in revelation 10 is the same revelation
[44:06] 1 says one standing in the midst of the
[44:08] seven golden candlesticks like unto the
[44:11] Son of Man Girt about the paps with a
[44:13] golden girdle he said that's the same
[44:15] one that's in Revelations 10 well
[44:18] brother Branham wasn't alone in
[44:19] Revelation 10 brother Brenton wasn't one
[44:21] in Revelations 1 he's part of it
[44:27] he's part of the word right now just as
[44:32] we say the bride was part of the the
[44:34] mystery and got to be revealed brother
[44:36] Branham was part of the word right I
[44:38] agree with that I believe it could
[44:40] whoever always taught it he was part of
[44:42] the word and that's to be revealed but
[44:46] you don't make him thisan a man you make
[44:50] him what his wife see not the son of God
[44:55] not son of David
[44:57] but Son of Man the Son of God he said
[45:00] was a supernatural cuz that's the
[45:03] baptism with all the ghosts
[45:05] you know the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[45:07] is the supernatural what do you see what
[45:10] he's talking about
[45:12] it's to be made known in his people he
[45:16] amor fees to be made known okay go ahead
[45:22] to the next number five yeah that's it
[45:27] that's part of the same quote so we read
[45:28] it when the Son of man shall be revealed
[45:30] the son of man being revealed not the
[45:33] son of God in the church age he's put
[45:35] out of that
[45:37] now he's son of man revealing himself
[45:40] the word is becoming flesh among us now
[45:44] listen he's put out now you're gonna
[45:49] have to catch this and hold on for a few
[45:51] minutes till we do some more reading the
[45:54] son of man wouldn't put out the church
[45:55] ages because he never would hire the son
[46:02] of God was what was put out now you're
[46:05] gonna have to swallow a lot to think
[46:06] about brother Dale are you saying the
[46:08] Pentecostal people and all the rest
[46:10] didn't want the baptism and hold ago
[46:11] no you're not listening they want to
[46:15] shouting they want the emotional they
[46:17] want to think they don't want to reveal
[46:19] word the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[46:22] the reveal word they don't want it that
[46:24] away they won't accept it on that basis
[46:27] they want it after shouting the crime
[46:30] that we pinned the the feelings so he's
[46:34] put out he's outside of his church as
[46:37] the son of God because he never was
[46:41] Darris or sort of man he has to come as
[46:44] son of man is he coming to that place go
[46:50] ahead to the next one should be sure as
[46:58] we would see Jesus number six Jesus was
[47:03] God in flesh now listen I mean you know
[47:10] you say I believe everything the Prophet
[47:13] said
[47:17] see if you do he was God in flesh and if
[47:22] Jesus is in you tonight it's still God
[47:29] manifesting himself in the last days in
[47:32] the Son of man revealing himself in his
[47:36] church can you read if Jesus was God in
[47:48] flesh now he's in your flesh by the
[47:51] baptism of the Holy Ghost right the new
[47:53] birth all right then if he is then
[47:58] you've got the same God and made
[48:01] manifest again you've got the
[48:06] opportunity to be able to the bride to
[48:09] become the full word and then you've got
[48:12] the great opportunity to come forth as
[48:14] the bride being the fullness of the
[48:19] Godhead bodily well how can we be the
[48:23] fullness of the Godhead bodily
[48:25] ask the Prophet ain't gonna argue with
[48:27] you caught up reached this 45 years or
[48:30] maybe ain't no need of trying to never
[48:32] to argue than anybody about it I'm just
[48:33] gonna tell you what I believe and I
[48:36] ain't gonna are y'all help you find your
[48:38] quotes I'll do anything I can to try to
[48:40] help you but I'm just telling you what I
[48:43] believe I believe what the Son of Man is
[48:49] now revealing himself in his church look
[48:54] the human flesh he's in our human flesh
[48:59] the church making himself known you get
[49:05] it see God down here in his church
[49:07] making himself again the word the son of
[49:10] man being revealed in the last days as
[49:12] it was in the days of Sodom okay fall
[49:15] back now what was the days of Sodom son
[49:18] of man
[49:22] now that was Jehovah altes son of man he
[49:27] revealed himself in the Old Testament
[49:28] son of man
[49:30] now I'm gonna say something maybe I
[49:34] shouldn't but I'll say it according to
[49:37] the Bible the Son of Man creates his own
[49:40] bride bride that's according to
[49:42] Scripture alright that's in the Matthew
[49:48] Mark Luke and John or you know the word
[49:51] is what creates the bride okay that
[49:56] would it be any problem to see him
[49:57] standing back there in the Old Testament
[49:59] to say let her be and that comes forth
[50:04] Adam was created by the word Eve was
[50:13] created by the word any problem being
[50:16] you being it created by the word the
[50:18] word is creating a bridegroom that's the
[50:21] point I'm trying to get us to see yeah
[50:25] but that's too much of a for me to
[50:28] understand my god my little I just don't
[50:30] know no you don't want to understand
[50:32] that's the problem what is it to
[50:35] understand alright well I don't
[50:41] understand the got it what is it to
[50:42] understand the Prophet took it and uh
[50:50] more than and then they I said it the
[50:54] right way and in this day we had a
[50:57] prophet that had the understanding
[50:59] straight from God greater than Paul and
[51:03] Moses and all of them because of the
[51:05] opening of the seals all right but where
[51:09] was his emphasis always put I ask you to
[51:13] just do a simple thing just turn over to
[51:18] get your little book that shows the tape
[51:20] sometime and just turn over there about
[51:23] somewhere close 62 is the best to start
[51:26] off and and just start reading the
[51:30] titles to the sermons from 62 to finish
[51:36] in 65 just read the title
[51:41] Christ is a mystery the unveiling of God
[51:45] mighty God unveil who is the smell
[51:47] charity just read the titles ever title
[51:56] is related to the bride now we're gonna
[52:00] get to this probably a couple of weeks
[52:02] but you see this corn of wheat that went
[52:05] into the ground comes back in Luther
[52:08] come back in Wesley comes back in Azusa
[52:12] Street but in a great marvelous
[52:15] masterpiece falls in there and the
[52:18] Prophet preached two messages one called
[52:20] a masterpiece the other one see not
[52:22] error to show if you'd read them you'll
[52:24] see what he's talking about you'll just
[52:26] listen to those tapes you'll see what he
[52:28] told me he's talking about a bride form
[52:31] and he says it's so strong until you
[52:35] know what his point was sounds odd he
[52:38] said that Mary was not to seed well you
[52:47] said what she was a seed yeah but she
[52:51] wasn't the seed he's talking about he's
[52:55] talking about the finishing of all
[52:56] things the seed Jesus Mary see had Jesus
[53:03] within her she carried the seed but she
[53:06] was not to seed the seed was in her see
[53:09] we'll get to that because we've been
[53:10] through this over and over and all this
[53:12] keeps from unfolding more and more but
[53:15] it all now listen to my point it always
[53:17] if you'll watch the way I preach I come
[53:19] out here like it and I go right back to
[53:21] pointing to the bride right back to
[53:24] pointing to the bride that's the way
[53:27] it's always been
[53:28] cuz that's where it whines okay they
[53:30] don't wind up in Jesus standing there
[53:33] you know what I'm saying he winds up in
[53:36] bride standing there over the book of
[53:38] Revelation it says one lock under the
[53:40] son of man Girt about the paps brother
[53:42] and said that finish but who was that
[53:47] that was the Lord Jesus Christ in bride
[53:50] form because that's what it is now that
[53:55] I'm talking about now that's what I'm
[53:56] trying to bring alright go ahead with
[54:02] the next one if we get going number
[54:06] seven I guess okay
[54:08] the mighty guard unveiled Road ago and
[54:11] when the son of man is being revealed
[54:15] the son of man back in in in the church
[54:20] again revealed in human beings
[54:29] brother Brown had his part amen
[54:33] but he's being revealed in human beings
[54:37] more than one see because it takes the
[54:40] Bride of Christ the Son of Man back in
[54:43] the church again revealed in human being
[54:45] not son of God but the son of man again
[54:48] back in his church again in the last
[54:52] days we find that he promised that in
[54:55] God's promises in the church that's
[55:02] that's what I can't I can't understand
[55:05] our thinking really I'm sorry but we can
[55:09] believe the Godhead as the Prophet would
[55:11] explain that your father your son you're
[55:14] a human you're this we can follow that
[55:16] we're going on with it and thank God
[55:18] farther happen because that's the only
[55:20] way we could go along with it is to see
[55:22] what it is but then the minute you start
[55:26] talking about the bride and what she is
[55:28] everybody just instead of shot and glory
[55:34] hallelujah and getting up and running up
[55:36] down the aisles and all the way over and
[55:37] say that's right brother this is like a
[55:44] spellbound hitch well you know what that
[55:47] means to me I mean I'm sorry it means
[55:49] you just don't believe what's going on
[55:51] I'm sorry
[55:53] sorry to say it but it simply means that
[55:56] you don't know exactly what I'm talking
[55:58] about
[56:00] we've closed what greater thing could be
[56:03] then to realize that God's entire Bible
[56:08] all the word Old Testament all the way
[56:11] through the writings of Paul and Peter
[56:13] with some eight or consummate in a
[56:17] little bride of Jesus Christ standing
[56:20] there in Revelations one like unto the
[56:25] Son of Man Girt about the paps with a
[56:27] golden girdle Sarah Shourd standing out
[56:29] in feminist form then all the way to the
[56:31] book of Revelation everything is her her
[56:33] her she comes riding back in Revelations
[56:43] not seen on white horses his wife has
[56:51] made herself ready everything there's
[56:56] got to do with a relationship of wife
[57:02] showing how much he thinks of his wife
[57:08] does what he's trying to get us to see
[57:11] who we really are
[57:12] go ahead number eight in this life days
[57:21] there would be a ladder rain poured out
[57:23] upon the people in the last days
[57:26] I think the Greek word dire is quino's
[57:30] Kenosha's every pronounce which means
[57:32] the that he emptied himself out not in
[57:36] the way that we would say it like
[57:38] something was inside of somebody that
[57:42] emptied out but he poured himself out
[57:46] now listen he changed his m morphe was
[57:51] changing his form after the word it more
[57:53] freeform he changed from what he was to
[57:58] what he is he changed from the Old
[58:02] Testament son of man New Testament son
[58:07] of God now he's gonna change the son of
[58:10] David this is used in the Millennium
[58:13] alright listen
[58:16] he never changes his nature now that was
[58:18] one I like I love that point he never
[58:21] changes his night
[58:22] but on the day of pentecost he changed
[58:25] himself from being the son of man to the
[58:27] son of god he came not with the people
[58:32] Old Testament he was with the people
[58:35] right coming through and then even him
[58:38] him here for he was with the people now
[58:41] the day of Pentecost he came not with
[58:43] the people he came into people see the
[58:46] same guard to carry his ministry on
[58:47] through in this great age go ahead get
[58:51] the next one who is this Melchizedek
[58:55] which that would be number nine I guess
[58:58] got him or if he matched in the pillar
[59:00] of fire god and morphe in a man called
[59:02] Jesus God in morphe in his church now he
[59:09] don't seem to have any problems to
[59:11] dealing with Jesus to dealing with
[59:13] Church he seems like he could just make
[59:15] it all one and I thought that's what
[59:19] it's supposed to be God above us God
[59:22] with us God in us the condescending of
[59:24] God up there holy no one could touch him
[59:28] he settled upon the mountain and then if
[59:31] an animal touched him you got to die
[59:32] okay quit yeah there was God above us
[59:38] God with us is God in us the holy spirit
[59:40] not the third person the same person see
[59:45] I'm trying my best to get you to see if
[59:48] you can see I'm trying to think how
[59:51] brother Gary and I'm talking that day he
[59:54] said I see God in me try know that I got
[59:59] to God head straight well you know I
[1:00:04] mean I'm trying my best to get that him
[1:00:06] see it that way but it clicked I said
[1:00:08] you're wrong he's what I said you got to
[1:00:11] see him in Christ first then you see
[1:00:13] them in yourself you see them in
[1:00:15] yourself you can be all messed up see
[1:00:20] that's what I'm trying to get you to see
[1:00:22] that it's Christ in you the hope of
[1:00:24] glory amen
[1:00:24] what was the life Sunday services or the
[1:00:27] mind of Christ that if it's mind being
[1:00:29] you the mind of Christ is the baptism
[1:00:33] when the Holy Ghost coming and living in
[1:00:34] you
[1:00:35] in bride form its God in a soul the
[1:00:40] spirit not the third person the same
[1:00:41] person go ahead what we got this is
[1:00:47] number 10
[1:00:47] God was in one person then his son
[1:00:53] Christ now he's in the entire church
[1:00:56] universal I'm gonna roll it on up a
[1:00:58] little he's in the entire church
[1:01:02] universal he's the same God now
[1:01:06] according to my understanding and I'm
[1:01:08] sorry I'm not too good on English and
[1:01:10] everything but when you're talking about
[1:01:12] something being universal it would boast
[1:01:16] to me meaning it's all over all the
[1:01:18] whole thing right
[1:01:19] so it's universal he was universal I go
[1:01:23] ahead and read it now that was the
[1:01:24] entire Church Universal go ahead to the
[1:01:26] net I'll be with you even in you to the
[1:01:30] end of the world he comes to the
[1:01:31] Apostles and then now he said and then
[1:01:34] the Holy Spirit wasn't only in one
[1:01:36] person it's in the entire Church
[1:01:39] Universal next time the Holy Spirit
[1:01:42] right cuz that's the we believe the
[1:01:44] baptism of the Holy Ghost we believe
[1:01:45] this the the Son of God the new birth is
[1:01:48] in everybody right
[1:01:49] not in every body and everybody that has
[1:01:52] received it right so look what he's
[1:01:55] saying the entire Church Universal doing
[1:01:56] the same works that Jesus did hallelujah
[1:01:58] now this is what I like I challenge the
[1:02:02] world to believe that and you're sealed
[1:02:06] revival break through this country these
[1:02:12] challenges just to believe what
[1:02:15] believing that the Holy Spirit was and
[1:02:17] only in one person it's in the entire
[1:02:20] Church Universal doing the same works
[1:02:23] that Jesus did so if it's the same as
[1:02:27] son of day son of God what about son of
[1:02:31] David I mean son of man to go with the
[1:02:33] neck go ahead to the next one
[1:02:38] because he just represented in one
[1:02:40] person there Jesus Christ but now he is
[1:02:43] among his church everywhere I love that
[1:02:47] don't you
[1:02:48] he's everywhere there's the bottom there
[1:02:52] is that same pillar of fire that same
[1:02:55] light among us burning forth the life
[1:02:57] that it did when Jesus in Christ Jesus
[1:03:00] doing the same thing in the bride church
[1:03:03] today see will you believe it he's doing
[1:03:08] the science
[1:03:09] I ain't now well I can't see you see
[1:03:13] when you you say things like that people
[1:03:15] say well brother Branham could stand up
[1:03:17] there and say and if we just had that
[1:03:19] ministry you know I mean I remember when
[1:03:23] it coming into the message and how it
[1:03:24] was the people are saying you know if we
[1:03:27] had the Ministry of brother Branham well
[1:03:29] praise God but you know what according
[1:03:32] to my Bible it was never to be that
[1:03:33] again now I'm calling like that now I'm
[1:03:37] talking about I'm talking about it was
[1:03:38] to come into its finality and the bride
[1:03:40] yeah but it was never to be one man
[1:03:43] again we're not expected to be for one
[1:03:47] man well of course you've got all of the
[1:03:51] returns and everything goes for that now
[1:03:53] that's people to me that ain't mine and
[1:03:55] you gonna argue a nobody about none of
[1:03:57] their returns or what are their do it
[1:03:58] I'm a firm believer in return I believe
[1:04:03] there's going to be an Easter next
[1:04:06] Sunday
[1:04:06] that's why I'm hoping we're gonna have
[1:04:08] the services outside because that Easter
[1:04:13] Sunrisers means a lot my whole thing
[1:04:16] okay what we got the next one there
[1:04:23] would be a time come forth when he could
[1:04:26] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:04:29] Godhead
[1:04:31] now look where he puts there would be a
[1:04:35] time come forth when he could express
[1:04:40] himself in fullness of his Godhead now
[1:04:44] evidently he's saying there would come a
[1:04:47] time that means is to come into
[1:04:49] manifestation now watch
[1:04:51] but their time come forth when he would
[1:04:54] express himself in the fullness of his
[1:04:56] Godhead deity through his church having
[1:04:59] the preeminence in this church oh my the
[1:05:04] anointed man now the anointed people Oh
[1:05:10] mah to bring back the anointed bride and
[1:05:14] the bridegroom anointed by Huang
[1:05:17] accepting what Eve turned down what does
[1:05:21] he turn down
[1:05:23] who knows what Eve turned down brother
[1:05:27] Brennan said he turned down Hebrews 13:8
[1:05:29] now this is the exact word Eve turned
[1:05:32] down Hebrews 13:8 you say well how could
[1:05:34] she turn down Hebrews 13:8 when he
[1:05:36] wasn't even back there she turned down
[1:05:38] the fact that he was the same he was the
[1:05:44] same God the whole time all right
[1:05:47] now once Eve turned down and Adam coming
[1:05:50] back with the anointing of the word
[1:05:52] because he said my word is spirits he
[1:05:54] anointed with a with a word what he
[1:05:57] turned down he comes back and we accept
[1:06:01] the word go ahead let's get a couple
[1:06:04] more okay
[1:06:08] so forth
[1:06:09] why but why ain't there there is nothing
[1:06:13] beyond the grain now this is laid down
[1:06:15] for later messages okay there is nothing
[1:06:19] beyond the grain it is back without an
[1:06:21] organization oh my a blind man could see
[1:06:24] that it cannot organize it so firmly
[1:06:27] against it it's the grain of wheat see
[1:06:29] if we itself the Son of Man will be made
[1:06:32] manifest the grain of wheat will come
[1:06:39] back to itself again the son of man in
[1:06:43] the life stage now that's got to be here
[1:06:49] that was brother Branham now he was a
[1:06:51] son of man he couldn't fulfill all of it
[1:06:54] he said he couldn't go ahead to the next
[1:06:58] one now he's been revealed through the
[1:07:03] church ages
[1:07:04] now watch through the church ages a son
[1:07:07] of God God be in a spirit the Holy
[1:07:11] Spirit he revealed himself in the church
[1:07:13] ages as in the congregation as in the
[1:07:17] congregation as the Holy Spirit among
[1:07:20] the people now watch him and we find in
[1:07:24] the lady of see in church age the life
[1:07:26] search aid he's put out of the church
[1:07:27] son of God put out of the church
[1:07:32] nowhere else was he ever put out in any
[1:07:35] age but in a lady of seeing age because
[1:07:38] they said he's rich we're we're rich and
[1:07:41] have need of nothing and no it not that
[1:07:44] you're miserable poor naked and blind
[1:07:46] and don't know it he was put out of the
[1:07:49] church the age and then according to
[1:07:52] Luke 17 he said as it was in the days of
[1:07:56] Sodom so shall it be in the coming of
[1:07:58] the Son of man now he was reading the
[1:08:00] same Genesis that we read notice that
[1:08:03] sort of what takes place what was in
[1:08:05] Sodom they Brown coming back to the
[1:08:09] finish seat I think we've got one Lord I
[1:08:11] said go ahead is it the last one 16 no
[1:08:15] got a couple more notice now he came
[1:08:18] first as the prophet and they crucified
[1:08:22] him his own crucified already understand
[1:08:24] what I would emphasize that to start
[1:08:26] with
[1:08:26] son of man he came as a prophet you said
[1:08:29] well that was the job of the old title
[1:08:31] he was a prophet because he over the Old
[1:08:33] Testament Jesus is the new same God okay
[1:08:36] watch and now he came first as the
[1:08:38] prophet that was the Lord Jesus being
[1:08:41] spoke of by all those prophets then he
[1:08:44] came to his crucifixion his own
[1:08:46] crucified him he came as the son of man
[1:08:48] then after the Holy Spirit came he was
[1:08:51] then the Son of God Church ages God is
[1:08:54] the spirit he was the holy spirit son of
[1:08:57] God he lived through the seventh through
[1:08:59] the church ages as the son of God now
[1:09:03] watching in the Millennium he'll be son
[1:09:05] of David sitting upon the throne of
[1:09:07] David father David his father David he
[1:09:11] is the son of David now he's to you and
[1:09:13] I he's already the son of David
[1:09:16] don't you think like that he's already -
[1:09:18] son of David - me and you we're not
[1:09:20] gonna try to go through something -
[1:09:22] where we get connections huh
[1:09:23] no he's the word he's the word now what
[1:09:28] you never what I told you and remember
[1:09:31] between the son of God now you're coming
[1:09:36] over in the church ages what's it now
[1:09:41] now between the Son of God and a lady
[1:09:43] see an age they put him out and in Luke
[1:09:46] he said he would be revealed again
[1:09:48] that's not a man after he's put out the
[1:09:53] prophet fulfilling the rest of it see
[1:09:55] the scriptures type perfectly together
[1:09:57] see it's together son of man son of God
[1:10:01] son of David what was it it's the same
[1:10:04] God all the time just changing this form
[1:10:06] in morphe he just changed it it's a
[1:10:09] great drama - drama - him he is acting
[1:10:14] it out acts of a play okay we've got two
[1:10:18] more when he was on earth here the first
[1:10:23] time he was the son of man he could not
[1:10:25] be son of God then he never claimed to
[1:10:28] be he said he was son of man that's why
[1:10:31] they asked him he always takes on a man
[1:10:32] you know when anybody would have
[1:10:35] questioned him he said you see this on a
[1:10:36] man the son of man now son of man is a
[1:10:41] prophet he had to come that way because
[1:10:44] the scripture can he cannot come
[1:10:47] contrary to the scripture so he came son
[1:10:50] of man son of God son of man for a
[1:10:54] little space and son of David all right
[1:10:58] let's get to life's 100 at that part of
[1:11:00] it let's see okay so we find that in
[1:11:05] this man he had to be a prophet not son
[1:11:08] of God there he had to be son of man
[1:11:11] Jehovah himself called the prophets
[1:11:13] Jeremiah and them son of man when you
[1:11:15] see the son of man who is the son of man
[1:11:17] they kept saying then he served his
[1:11:20] office as son of man then he served his
[1:11:23] office now as son of God God is a spirit
[1:11:27] and when now he served through the
[1:11:29] Church ages and son of God now in the
[1:11:31] Millennium he'd be son of David when he
[1:11:33] sits on the throne of David he'll be
[1:11:36] heir to the throne son of David son of
[1:11:38] man son of God son of David and it's the
[1:11:41] same man all the time just like Father
[1:11:45] Son and Holy Ghost the office of God he
[1:11:47] was God the Father then he came god the
[1:11:50] son now he's God the Holy Spirit not
[1:11:53] three guards one God three manifestation
[1:11:55] three attributes or the same God all
[1:11:58] right is that clear now let's get the
[1:12:00] last one who is this son of man now you
[1:12:07] asked the question in the beginning was
[1:12:10] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:12:12] the Word was God and the Word was made
[1:12:15] flesh and dwelt among us now who is this
[1:12:18] son of man you remember that little
[1:12:19] statements I made a moment ago who
[1:12:25] created the world he saw what God did
[1:12:32] okay that's fine but what form was he
[1:12:34] back there he was the son of man he
[1:12:43] created the world he created all of
[1:12:44] these things he come down through the
[1:12:46] Old Testament that son of man prophet
[1:12:50] form he comes through the church ages
[1:12:54] and what's the key that it connects to
[1:12:58] now you fall back as I said to there in
[1:13:01] one of the Gospels and it shows you that
[1:13:04] the Son of man created all things he
[1:13:09] created his rod room on the day of
[1:13:13] Pentecost the baptism with the Holy
[1:13:15] Ghost and watching Luke 17:30 Malachi 4
[1:13:18] and different scriptures that we are
[1:13:20] acquiring quaint idli that word again is
[1:13:23] waved over the people that the dead
[1:13:26] traditions of man is dead and the Son of
[1:13:28] God is alive again with the baptism of
[1:13:31] the Holy Spirit right among us giving us
[1:13:33] life who is this son of man in the
[1:13:37] beginning what's the word
[1:13:41] the Creator God the Creator God was the
[1:13:49] son of man he still that Creator God
[1:13:53] he's still creating his bride that's
[1:13:58] what I like you know that every time a
[1:14:00] born-again person comes into the body of
[1:14:02] Christ God is creating varying part of
[1:14:05] his own being and when that's all
[1:14:09] finished now it's all finished then
[1:14:11] she'll be the fullness of the Godhead
[1:14:13] bodily we'll take that up next and when
[1:14:16] it does it'll turn out to where we take
[1:14:17] it on to the life to where that seed and
[1:14:21] you'll see why brother Branham would say
[1:14:23] cuz I remember when I first read that
[1:14:25] when retirin said Mary was not to see I
[1:14:29] thought I think they've made a mistake
[1:14:32] here I think the printers made a mistake
[1:14:36] her brother branham made a slip of the
[1:14:38] tongue but when he got through
[1:14:40] explaining it I seen I was so far wrong
[1:14:42] because I was the one who had the mess
[1:14:45] up not him he was exactly right Mary was
[1:14:51] a carrier but the seed was in her Mary
[1:14:55] gave birth sure but she gave birth to
[1:14:59] the word see that's what you and I got
[1:15:02] to do give birth to the word that has
[1:15:07] been brought to us come on come on I
[1:15:12] hope you understand I hope you'll follow
[1:15:14] the thought I'm not trying to make
[1:15:18] nothing out of anything other than one
[1:15:19] time the bride of Jesus Christ is God
[1:15:23] made manifest in another form called the
