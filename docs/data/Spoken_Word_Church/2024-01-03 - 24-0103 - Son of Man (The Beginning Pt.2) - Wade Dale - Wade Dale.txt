tonight bless you thank you all for coming amen appreciate your presence thank you again for this weekend for all of you that were here amen we had a wonderful Service uh Saturday night and Sunday night and uh everything went well we had plenty of food sent some food home with brother Luis and Christine for for um brother Eric and his family so we we got fed well in the pull pit we got fed well downstairs so I thank you very much for helping to clean up put up put out get in and get out so everybody did good so so reach out take your hands like this do like this and go okay if nobody will do it for you Donnie did it for his sweetheart over here so that's wonderful but good to be in the house of the Lord good to be back uh back in the saddle if you got your Bibles or you we don't even do that that anymore we go to the computer so let me get this up 350 is where the the older generation can can see it okay this is the son of man the beginning you wow part two we're going to cover we're still on our son of man but we're we're head we're at The Headstone now so all this that we've been talking about for a year has been what we need to do to get to that place right add to your faith virtue virtue knowledge knowledge Temperance Temperance patience and then have the Holy Ghost mold it all together but let's just back up just a minute because we started with the baby because that baby was the son of man and The Headstone was the son of man all right or is the son of man so that's where I want to just kind of back up and go all the way back into eternity now because there's something we got to see we've got to see the difference in the son of man and the Son of God and sister CLE and I were talking she just the little comment that she makes it's always very powerful um she said he didn't say Jesus came down in Revelations 10 he said Christ came down it wasn't jesuses Jesus the body is on the right hand of the father Jesus the body that son of man part the flesh can't come down here but he's transferred that power to a group of people all right when he said all power in Heaven and Earth they we'll read it in just a minute he meant that but that power was then breathed into the disciples as a potential receiving of the Holy Ghost so that's why the Holy Ghost is the most powerful thing you can have because without the Holy Ghost number one you're lost number two without the Holy Ghost you have no power so it's pretty important to living a good Christian life is to have the baptism of holy ghost in your soul not just um not just on your spirit realm so remember as brother Ryan said this weekend coming up we're kind of get back to a little bit of normaly we'll have our prayer service between 5: and 6 then we'll have questions and answers from 6:00 to 8: I already have a couple but um go ahead and bring them if you got them remember brother Lise tonight he is at brother Martins with brother Eric and he will be at brother Stan prices this weekend also with brother Eric brother Donaldo will be here this Sunday both Services normal Services just like just like regular but he will have brother Martin's brother-in-law will be here interpreting for him because brother Luis won't be here so we will have an interpreter so remember that also at the end of the service we're going to have we're going to pray over some prayer claws to give for brother Dale sister Johnny called and requested that we all take a prayer cloth and put it in our Bible on Psalms 23 and and pray for brother Dell cuz he needs it and we all do and then brother Boyd wants some prayer clo to put in in the Ashley's house so we believe they work amen we're we're firm Believers and and we've got uh oops we better get some more I think I gave all them for that Louis and them out y'all took a bunch down there to uh Honduras we may have to cut some more but we got plenty for tonight so just remember that also remember February the 17th will be our Valentine's banquet it will be at the same place as usual and brother Dutch will be speaking that night and he also will be speaking Sunday morning just one service so Brother D Scott will be with us just like he was last year and U pray for him he's having some hard times he's having Uh something's going on in his nervous system and he's he gets real weak that's why they weren't here Saturday Sunday night he preached Sunday morning he said he just couldn't hardly get out of the car uh after the service was over so much less come here so just remember him the devil would just love to put us all out of business but guess what we got a God that keeps us in business cuz he's a Healer and we'll we'll look at that um here in just a minute but we're going to talk about the beginning part two because part one we'll review a little bit and then start with that so let's bow our heads Lord thank you for this assembly that we have a good warm place that we can come Lord in safety and worship you father I pray that You' just cover each door and window Lord and just protect us Lord now from all not just regular um disturbances but the disturbances of the demons and Devils that are out here flying around in the fourth dimension I pray Lord that you'd rebuke them just in in your precious name and hold them back lord so that we can hear from you father so that we can hear straight from the logos as we're going to talk about tonight that that's where you had to come you had to bring that to to speech before anything could happen and father I pray now that as we speak Lord I pray that you'd heal the sick that you'd bless the ones Lord that are that are backslid Lord the ones that are that we haven't seen in church in in weeks and Lord I pray that youd just touch their heart Lord more than that touch their soul and Lord I pray that you'd bless each one Lord that is here thank you for the assembly that we have and the people that are here that assembled together under this roof and the support to ministry here father I pray that you'd be with each one be with the ministers be with Brother Louis Lord as he's working overtime Lord next couple of weeks father I pray that You' give him physical strength and that you'll bless the family brother Eric and different ones Lord all their families we pray that you'd touch them Father we ask a special blessing tonight Lord as we pray over the prayer Closs at the end of the service Lord for our brother Dale Lord that you would give him Comfort Lord as as we see as a family we see that that he gets torment tormented and anxious about different things and that's just not him father and I know it's I know it's just the devil and he's trying to do what he's trying to do but Lord there's a greater God and we pray Lord in your precious name in the name of the Lord Jesus that you take care of that right now in Jesus name amen John 1:1 in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God verse two the same was in the beginning with God all right so brother Brown said one time he said the logos all right the logos in the beginning was the logos all right so we'll cover that in a second all things were made by him all right so this is this all powerful guy everything's made by him there's nothing there's no there's no extra something he made everything the way it's supposed to be the first time all right and all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made and the Word was made flesh verse 14 so that word had to transfer down into something of a kinsman redeemer or someone that was like us cuz that's how we fa and we'll get to that in just a minute and we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth you can be seated Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word Isaiah 7:14 says therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign Behold a virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name Emmanuel now let's go to that that little spot of Jerusalem just for a moment and let's look at Mary as she walks as brother R tells she walks to the water with a water pot she goes and gets water and she's thinking on the Lord and she different things and what happen she didn't just all of a sudden up and say I'm pregnant right there had to be something brought to her there had to be a message amen there had to be a message Gabriel had to come with a message speak that message and then she had to accept that what that person said that she'd never seen before in her life amen uh I would say maybe he just appeared and there he was behold Mary you've been highly favored and she's like who's this guy but she pondered it in her heart in her soul in her being and she said well if that's what it says and I can read where the scripture and Isaiah says that brother Brown said you know him her and Joseph may have been reading that same scripture says Behold a virgin shall conceive and and his brother there there was many many virgins back there in that time why I was married well she was the one that was that was going to receive it without any doubt in her heart all right now she pondered it and she also she may had doubt later but at that time something dropped down and Gabriel was bringing a message from God that wasn't Gabriel's message he was a deliverer he he delivered the message all right thereby with me that was God speaking into her there only one person can create and that's God all right but he sent Gabriel on a mission knowing that Gabriel was the spokesman to the Jews right Ain that what he said he was a spokesman to the Jews so maybe even Mary kind of felt comfortable when he says hey I'm Gabriel I've been sent from I've been sent from God and I've give you this this this uh opportunity to fulfill the the scripture and she just says what be it unto me according to Thy word all right she didn't have to do anything else she just said hey I'll accept it if you're bringing the message so that's what we got to see when the when we see a a minister or someone speak we've got to get the humanity part out of it because if the logos is bringing us a message if that speech is bringing us a message and it comes from God it cannot be wrong right now I can have my ideas and you can have yours they're like noses we all got them right but if something drops down and we get into a key or we get into a a slot and and we call it the anointing or but you can be anointed by the devil but when you but when that logos that was in the beginning when he starts speaking his word see that's what happened in the life of William brandham we understand that he was a a mortal human being a a common man just like the rest of us uh couldn't speak a very good language didn't have a very good education that would have just gotten his way but when he stepped in that pull pit it was so much God speaking to us that one day on the tape it says this is not William brandom you're hearing right right and he didn't change the pitch of his voice either he didn't say I'm God no he just kept right on talking just like brother randam he just like it just it was him but God had took over his vocal cords and was speaking through him to us and that's why we call it the voice of God recording cuz it was the voice of God it had to come through somebody though my point is why didn't God just come down and say Mary he sent a messenger he sent a messenger that was comfortable and I'll explain something to you later God couldn't see Mary face to face right God couldn't come down himself he had to send a messenger cuz remember we'll read in just few minutes where he told Moses he said Moses you can't see my face and live why there was no Holy Ghost Inside of the people to reflect back cuz we see him face to face is what the Bible says we can do that we can see God no man has seen God at any time but what we see him through the Lord Jesus Christ to Matthew 1 ver8 now the birth of Jesus was on his wives when his mother Mary his his mother Mary was spouse to Joseph before before they came together she was found with child of the Holy Ghost all that scene that I told you a few minutes ago now all these things was done and it might be fulfilled which was spoken of the Lord by the prophet saying behold the Virgin shall be with child so they're going back to the Old Testament and shall bring forth a son and they shall call his name Emmanuel which being interpreted is god with us and that's what it was it was God with us but now remember we going we're going to separate the two people just really quick tonight with Adam Adam was a Son of God but Adam was not born like you and I everybody with me um mecdc was not born like me and you but yet that it was God with a filtered listen a filtered voice a human voice that spoke to Abraham and told him the what the truth right now the problem with with us is I say all of us even down Through the Ages that filter we didn't allow God to to speak what he wanted to speak man got involved the devil got involved I'm going to read it to you in a few minutes where brother R said the father son Holy Ghost baptism come from the pits of hell it was hatched out of hell that's pretty rugged but that's exactly what happened listen anything contrary to the logos of God is from Hell anything that's why God had to send a prophet in the end time to tie the loose ends up to bring everything back to where it was supposed to be and then open the seals am which was God himself talking to us amen through a human body Colossians 1:12 says giving thanks un the father now watch how Paul brings this down giving thanks unto the Father which ha made us meat to be partakers of the inheritance of the Saints in light all right not Darkness but light who ha delivered us from the power of darkness in other words if you have the baptis the Holy Ghost today you have been delivered from the power of Darkness the power of Darkness may want to get inside of you but it cannot get in your soul all right it can Cloud your mind it can make you go crazy but it cannot if you're born again in your soul it cannot change you then you'd be changing God cuz you can't have a soul that wants to come to church that wants to forget all the stuff and read and study and God speak to them and all of a sudden you don't have that anymore more that's not God he's not an Indian giver he gives you the baptism of the Holy Ghost he's pleased to dwell in you and he's got a he's got something for you right there for you not the guy sitting beside of you the lady sitting beside of you your mother your father even the preacher he's got something for you cuz he's going to give you a part of himself all right and God don't have to do that remember he's self-existing he doesn't need all this but he wants it amen there's something inside of him that compels him to have children that compels him to be a savior A Healer a redeemer all those compound names of Jehovah that we we see that we know now every one of them was wrapped up in one man called Jesus Christ and I'll read it to you right here and whom we have Redemption who ha delivered us from the power of Darkness translated us into the Kingdom look of his dear son Jesus our dear son in whom we have Redemption through his blood all right even the Forgiveness of sins who is the image of the invisible God the fir look the first born of every creature remember we we read Revelations 3:14 that's what we get in the end time we get the beginning and I'll read it in a minute 3:14 that's what we get in the end time we get the beginning and I'll read it in a minute the beginning the firstborn the the beginning of the creation of God see that's the unique part of this church age the unique part of this age is we get it the way it's supposed to have been right praise the Lord ought to make you happy that's what we get we get that part right for by him were all things created Now watch how Paul brings this that are in heaven and that are in Earth visible and invisible Thrones principalities Powers all things were created by Him and for him and he is before all things and by him all things consist now keep that in your mind cuz we're going to talk about something in just a second and he is the head of the body Now watch how Paul brings you right back down he's the head of the body of the church or the bride who is the beginning the firstborn from the dead hey Jesus did die right God didn't but Jesus did that's what made him our brother that's what made the connection between us and God that in all things he might have the prence now what for it pleased the father that in him should all fullness dwell and you see where I said not in Adam Adam was not the fullness of the godhead bodily Adam was a being that was created and then the breath of eternal life a part of God was put in him but he did not have these compound names he did not have this he did not have this desire that God had right he had desire sure he named all the animals he was God of the earth he did all this he did that but remember he fell right he's the one that took us down not Eve Eve did what she did but Adam's the one that sold us out amen but Adam couldn't see Adam thought he could save Eve went out to get her and couldn't get back in himself now listen this man that created all things and before all things and by all things consist he he could praise God he could he was the son of man Adam was the son of God he was the son of man Genesis 2:7 said the Lord God formed man of the Dust of the ground and look and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life and Man became a living Soul now we know one thing's for sure we'll read it in a minute animals don't have soul right we do we have we have a a free will to to make better stuff but they don't John 20:21 then Jesus said unto them peace be unto you as my father has sent me now look as the father has sent me what was he the fullness of the godhead Bly he was everything in bottled up inside of that one man there was not another man anywhere that had anything in like he did I'm going to send to you and when he had said this he breathed on them now watch this word breathed is the same over here where he breathed on Adam because it's the same holy ghost He breathed on them and said unto them receive ye the Holy Ghost now we know brother Bram told us and thank God for a Propet because there aren't people that believe that right then they receed the Holy Ghost you can't receive the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was standing there talking to him the dispensation had not changed they had to go to Penta they had to go to Pentecost they had to go to the Jubilee to get a release of that life that was in Jesus to release into the people but it was a potential that was telling them you can do it and I'm going to do it I'm going to do it I'm going to release the Holy Ghost and you're going to receive it remember he said go to Jerusalem you'll receive what power or dunamus from on high but that was a promise brother BR said before he left the Earth he made sure somebody was going to believe him he made sure there was a group of people that when they went to the upper room they said this is that Peter said this is that cuz he was standing there or maybe sitting there when when Jesus said receive ye the Holy Ghost they didn't forget that whosoever sends you remit now whoa hang on a minute that's just a little bit too much p there brother now I'm going to read you this red letter it's not what I put in here it's red letter cuz that's what Jesus said whosoever sins you remit they are remitted unto them and whosoever sins you retain they are retained Blasphemous names brother R says look the church is the mystical Body of Christ born of the Breath of God oh did you get it congregation says amen the Church of God is born of a breath of the Breath of God God breathed breath into the nostrils look spiritually of Adam and he became a living Soul now remember Adam was a living being God had already given him life right cuz you watch what I'm going to tell you and he became a living Soul now watch did you know the Pentecostals or the true Pentecostal church is born of the Breath of God now if he put those two together listen to me if he put those two together those Pentecostal people when they were born babies they didn't have the Holy Ghost they had to receive it everybody with me they had to receive it so Adam had to receive eternal life he just wasn't born with it amen amen all right so let's look at what happened here this this word logos don't get so caught up with it but it is it is terminology that God wanted to use so we're going to use it if God wanted to use it then we're going to use it all right so that word logos is the simple definition it's the appeal to logic now how do you appeal to logic you got to talk to somebody right right speech you can think of things all you want to but if you keep it in your head it's not going to come to fruition means to appeal to the audience's sense of reason or Logic the whole the whole Bible seems illogical to most people cuz they haven't heard the logos of the Bible right amen they see the letter of it how can a virgin conceive how can this man you call God die how can this man you call God come back on the day of Pentecost how can this man they're not listening to the logos they're listening to just speech but this lust is the power behind it is God amen and listen it can't be changed it cannot be changed nothing in this Bible can be changed so when he stood and said in the beginning was the word the word was with God and the Word was God and that word was made flesh that's the way it was going to be but you go back to Genesis 1 said God created God spoke and it came to fruition even brother Ram said it was a thought once a thought is spoken it's expressed and with God whatever he thinks is going to come to pass praise God I'm glad we're not that way think about it just for about 5 seconds while I scroll this up here cuz all the stuff you think all day long that's what I thought to use logos the author look makes clear logical connections between ideas and includes the use of facts and statistics as we read the Bible we look and like I said before God's not a very good mathematician cuz he can do with one what we can't do with 10 million all right he can do with one person so he he's not into big numbers but he is into the power behind the number logos or the appeal to logic means to appeal to the audience's sense of reason or logic to use logos the author makes clear logical connection between ideas and includes use of facts and statistics using historical and literal analogies to make a logical argument is another strategy there should be no holes in the argument as known as logical fallacies listen God has no logical fallacies but when they began to start re man began to start arguing about one God versus three father son Holy Ghost baptism versus the Lord Jesus Christ they analyzed the word but but they didn't hear from the logos of the word that's right they heard from the devil that got so close to the logos amen till it sounded just like him that's right right but there's no holes in the word of God God is in continuity everything is in continuity with God but we got to remember though that brother R talks about Loose Ends what was loose ends that means that something got cut the word of God got cut it got cut down diluted watered down that's right there should be no holes in the argument as known as logical fallacies which are unclear or wrong assumptions or connections between ideas that's what all false Doctrine is amen it's somewhere it disconnects you from God somewhere a false doct will take you to a person not to God amen amen so that speech had to become a a form cuz they had to have something to speak through because remember we were made in the image of God we weren't just a cloud we weren't just a a floating uh Casper the Friendly Ghost type thing right so there was a body that was standing a theany body that he stepped into that he could use to speak to me and you now remember brother randam calls him in one place King theophany so he's the king of all theophanies any theophany that's ever was or will be he had it in him everybody with me Satan can't make one he can pervert one one but he can't make one all right only God can make remember he created all things and it's a noun and it's a visible visible manifestation of a deity so then you got something to look at but remember God is always hid himself behind something after the fall now before the fall I believe Adam it never was recorded that Adam and God couldn't talk to each other face to face brother Bri and say come down and say hey buddy how you doing hey hey children how y'all doing today there was no problem before the fall there's not going to be any problem after the fall listen you're not going to hide your face from God maybe right now today you might hide your face from God for something maybe you did in humanity but when we get over there we're not going to be hiding from God in a new city we're not going to be hiding from him there know where to go but it's a visible man visible manifest of a deity so God had to come down so that we can understand him he had to come into a form then he had to speak something that we could understand remember the Bible if it's written to where you say I can't understand that then that's your problem right right I say that not not not saying it to be mean but that's your problem because God wrote it so that everybody can understand it if it is articulated right right through a filter thank you okay a theophany is the combination of two Greek words Theos which is God and Phan which is to appear so a theophany then is an appearance of God to human beings right now theophany is typically for the purpose of revealing something about the character of God you know how God's character is revealed through you amen King theophany gave you one that's the soul then you have a choice whether to follow on and receive him or to let that theophany stay black and you die and you go to hell or you go to judgment let's say go to judgment the term itself does not appear in scripture but the concept appears throughout even theologians will tell you even you look at Scofield brother Brown didn't come up with these words logos and theophany he read it in the Bible he read it in the commentary of Scofield in different ones where they would there had to be some explanation of God coming from this great big thing that you can't understand down to where you can hear him speak and you can see that he's standing there in eternity and then when he becomes Jesus Christ it's the same guy it's not a different person now in the trinitarian doctrine that's a different person no that's God if he was the fullness of the godhead bodily where was anything else brother bar said the deity of Jesus Christ I love this CU this is 1949 like someone was speaking the other day he said God what was he when he was back under millions and millions of year ago when he was no just like this space here and then he gathered up into the logos he gathered it up and said I've got to be this form so that Humanity will understand because remember before he began he knew the end he knew who wouldn't who wouldn't understand him he knew he had to make it where some of us dummies can understand it then he came from the lust down into Christ remember that's not Jesus Christ that's Christ right the anointing Jesus Christ was the anointed Messiah he got an Earthly name of Jesus the flesh body that he inhabited so that we can call that connection to the father is through Jesus Christ now Paul picks that up many many times the only connection we have to the father is through Jesus Christ no man seing God at any time but the what the son has declared him now as the son declared him though what did he do he transferred that to me and you to declare him for us to declare him right here today see it's just God coming down like this to the Earth then going right back into God again Jesus stood and we read it on the the um communion scripture he says he knew that he had come from God and he was going back to God he had a clear understanding maybe when he was 13 or 10 or 12 or 9 or six or every how maybe he didn't have a clear understanding you say well yeah he had to have a human brain like me and you did the Bible said he grew in Grace and knowledge and he became perfect this thing don't you see what I mean just revolving coming down from space from eternity rolling together coming down into the logos and the logos down into the man then returning back again for one purpose to redeem that man that fell he didn't come down like many would say as brother R tells us he he well I'm I'm just going to feel sorry for him I'm just going to go down there Earth and I'm going to just see who will feel sorry for me and get saved no he came to get the ones that heau wanted him before the foundation of the world now that's what he came for to be a redeemer and before God could be a redeemer he had to be according to the law a kinsman redeemer in other words he was born the same way you were but without sex all right he he had to be birthed he was birthed to a birth canal water broke blood came out uh umbilical cord was hung on him and that's something Adam didn't have right so Adam couldn't be our brother Adam was different created full grown you and I some of us that our age are not full grown well praise the Lord anyhow he had to be K folk to us so 1951 resurrection of Lazarus there's where science get mixed up they say no he might give me my hand like a monkey and face like a chimpanzee might give him a foot like a bear but God put a soul in a man that listen now look this white cloud deity came down not in the animal in man and now if they want to go back and dig up some old bones let them dig up as many as they want to fossils and doesn't have a thing to do in the bearing of the word of God there he is then here's this man and now the man sinned all right talking about Adam and when he sinned and fell then that little cloud in there became marred and black right the only problem with Adam was is he didn't have a chance to go back right he lost it because he had a position right you understand what I'm saying he couldn't go back and get saved and clear all that out no that had to stay with him all right you'll see a little something there then the lo you see how important me you are you important me and you are we get a choice we were born in sin shape of iniquity dying on our way to hell and we had a choice to get back then the Loos came down and was made flesh and dwelt among us to redeem this man back to the love of the father and he came in by the baptism of the Holy Spirit and chased sin now praise the Lord Chase sin out of the human and brings him back again again in fellowship with God everybody with me so now look questions and answers on Genesis 1953 now if God created man his own image and his own likeness then he wasn't a cloud he was a tree he wasn't a dog he wasn't a cat he was a human he was a man what kind of man did he create now look a spirit man so there we come from we come from logos to theophany a a a word formed body a body that formed the Loos could speak through and we can understand him because he said you're going to be made in my image whatever I'm fixing to make all right whatever I'm fixing to bring onto the Earth it's going to look like me right right see that's where we are different because in our Humanity we were made from different seed and different cells and different you understand what I'm saying we come from different lineages all right so that had to be what done away with and brought us into a new creation right he made all the creation and created a spirit man the close reading of this now to the one that asked the question will find this that God gave Dominion of the cattle and the fishes and everything to the man but in his making up there he made him in his own image what to lead the cattle lead the Beast of the the field just like the Holy Spirit leads the believer today Here's my thought remember Adam Adam was formed in Genesis 2:7 out of the ground the the flesh body of Adam was in Genesis 2:7 before that though in Genesis 1:26 something came out of God come on something came out of God to lead the animal So Adam Walked In the Garden of Eden in his theophany first can you believe that he walked in his the AL because that's if it's not there's two three different people running around here right right cuz out of him he made this in his own image he said here you take over the Earth I'll take over heaven I'm going to put part of me inside of you cuz remember Adam wasn't the fullness it wasn't time for the fullness to show up just like the Holy Spirit look leads the believer today he was in other words look Adam the first man in the lower creations of God the first creation was God himself what logos theophany we can see somebody standing there his name is not God but he is God remember God's not a name God's an object of worship the and out of God came to logos which was what the Son of God the Bible calls Adam the Son of God everybody with me I'm reading Bible then out of God comes a logos which was the son of God so there was a part of God went out look then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning was the word word was with God the Word was God and the Word was made flesh out of the Loos comes forth the man okay cuz let me give you a little background what are they in in the sixth Dimension right now flesh bodies flesh bodies still here because of sin it can't go through there's a Chasm there's a gulf there's something fixed that that human body can't get there so it has to stay here so what happened their theophonic mention and just as alive and got eyes and got ears and got nose and got mouth cuz they're praising God remember they saw brother brandom and they were hugging him saying my precious brother that was their theophany but now remember the ones in the Fifth Dimension they're in their theophanies too right cuz we all got one that's right that's where our choice comes from a deer doesn't have a theophany a deer has Spirit right when we take an animal or animal gets hit it that that that life just disappears and goes back into God right cuz a deer is not an individual you're an individual though so whatever happens to you it's got to go one place or the other you're either here now or somebody's in that Dimension five and that Dimension six everybody with me on that it's pretty simple You're Building whatever you are now you're Building inside of you amen your future you're building your future either your future's going to be over there in The Fifth Dimension or your future's going to be in the sixth Dimension can't be in both got to be in one or the other all right now look watch but when he died he rose again and come up the Bible said no one has ascended up but he that came down first when he was in heaven he was the lust that went out of God in the beginning all right what's that that's the Christ remember he got the name Jesus 2,000 years ago before that he had titles cuz they didn't know what to call him they called him they knew he was a great God they so they called him yahovah or Jehovah Jehovah God something above us something that that told us what to do and if we didn't do it you know we suffer the consequences everybody with me right but then remember brother BR said I I used to think God hated me and Jesus loved me come to find out that great Jehovah just Whirled itself down into a human and he walked into this world and projected love but remember if you don't accept him you get the Judgment part right but he came down here and was judged for me oh don't ever forget what happened on that cross we can talk about seals and Bs and plagues and all that stuff don't ever forget what happened at Calvary that theophany was hanging there inside of that flesh man and he was saying oh let me out I got work to do am so it's theop he went where went to hell uh Satan must have knew who he was uh Abraham must to knew who he was remember brother brand say he come back up to Paradise knocked on the door and open the door and Abraham said hey that's guy we fed the calf to Ezekiel said I saw him as a wheel in the middle of a wheel he he had he had fire from here down and fire from here up everyone knew him in assemble form right right but he was getting ready oh come on somebody he was getting ready to make it real he was getting ready to make it so real that on the day of Pentecost those people became little jesuses and they had that lust that speech there's no way Paul could could bring us 80% of the Bible that we say God wrote without the logos taking over and speaking same with Peter James John we we use Paul because obviously he wrote the most of the of the New Testament and with a lot better understanding than the rest of them but now look he came on Earth and was not to be made an angel he came down on Earth and took the form of abolishment now we're seeing Angel is not a flesh person right right Angel's a spirit stays a spirit now they may come and inhabit a body cause you to do things or first one thing and another but I'm just like you said before here's Joshua Joshua's out there fighting his fighting his uh his his I mean he probably was so tired he couldn't move he comes out to battle and he walks over a hill and he sees a guy standing looks like he' never lost the battle in his life fully array in his armor though because David saw him as a I mean Joshua saw him as a very formidable opponent he said are you for us or against us when Joshua heard that voice that voice said oh I I'm here to take over I I'm the captain of the host you don't have to worry about it Joshua I'm with you but while you at it it's kind of you're on Holy Ground how about taking you shoes off like Moses did how much reverence should we have when God Appears to us he came down on Earth and took the form of a bondsman not an angel he didn't come down in the great Jehovah Glory but he came down as a man to redeem man to die for man to die as a man he never died as God remember God can't die and we agree with that you can't die the real you can't die he died as a man the sin of man was upon the son of man why because that's our kin folk right amen and he had to become a man in order to pay the penalty what did he do the Bible said he was made a little lower than the angels in order for death that he might take away and abolish sin and take away sickness from the world now when he came down from the highest look lust from God he came down through Ang angs came down and was made a man he said I am not even a man I'm a worm brother Luis preached about that several months ago I am a worm and no man for he was despised and rejected but he was God Almighty hidden in human flesh now here's a statement I love brother brandham here's 1957 I believe that Jesus is the son of God I believe that in his body he was a man he was born of a woman just like I was but his blood was was not of a woman it was of God and Jehovah God look Jehovah God the Loos who brewed it over the Earth and brewed the first man Out of the Dust of the earth overshadowed Mary see listen Gabriel didn't give her that seed Gabriel can't create God gave the seed and the and the um and the Egg okay but she had to hear it from a messenger that's right that's why we need a five-fold Ministry yes sir to break the word down to get us to realize don't I don't want you believe me believe what I say we were talking this past weekend you know that talking about Christmas trees and stuff you know everybody saying well brother Brown said don't believe what I what you know don't pay attention to what I do just pay attention to what I say now that's hogwash if he live two different lives we're in trouble we're in trouble if I I can't look at his life and see Christ that's right and then see him preach Christ and they be two different lives uh wrong answer I believe in a body he was man I believe in his soul he was God he was God's manifestation here on Earth God was in Christ reconciling him or the world to himself I believe he's not just a mere man though he was not just a mere man he was the fullness of the godhead bodily all right you and I can never individually one person be the fullness ever again but he's give us power to be that as a collective body of Believers I believe he was not a mere man neither was he a prophet he was God Emmanuel I believe with all my heart that being the truth I can't prove that truth because if I could then it wouldn't be a faith right 1957 you shall see me that better all right you shall see me now if Christ has risen from the dead and we are given the invit invitation and the scripture that he promised that he we could see him and that we would be the same yesterday today and forever then would you desire to see him would you if You' desire raise your hand would every Christian believe it that I would with my hands up I would love to see him well now how can you see him we still believe brother Brown was a prophet right okay and God will speak through him okay the way we can see him is by his works the logos to the theophany into flesh now into your flesh now he hasn't come in a Corporal body yet so we're not looking at that one person Jesus Christ to be here right he hasn't come in a Corporal body yet Among Us he's here in a spiritual body you believe that a spiritual body called the Holy Spirit now where is that Holy Spirit if you're born again it's inside you that's right he's in the form of the Holy Spirit now in the beginning God was a spirit and all the Fountain of goodness and mercy and power and all the good things of love God was the center of that Fountain and then the lust that went out of God in the be beginning remember not something different become what we would call theophany in other words a supernatural body but it was a body hands feet arms legs eyes right God's Not Just Like the Wind he's in a body Moses seen him pass and say it look like the back part of a man and so forth why couldn't Moses see his face I'll read your scripture in a minute God said if you see me face to face you die wow the sin curse hadn't been took off yet that's right hello it was only covered blood of bulls and goats Hey listen they saw him they saw him at 29 years old and 30 years old and 31 they saw God face to face we've seen God face to face is what they said remember he was veiled though by human skin but it was still God I don't think God look no different than he did when he was here on Earth if it was a different person then that's why Mary Magdalene didn't realize who he was when he come out of the Tomb he was back to a young man again and she didn't know him at 18 or 20 years old everybody thinks God says some Moses looking thing with long hair and the beard and no he's a young guy he's in the fountain of his youth if we're going to get changed back to the Fountain of our youth you don't think he's already done it because we're made in his IM image thank you if he never gets old we never going to get old that only make the old people shout I'll be 64 in a few weeks good grief did I tell yall i' be 6 you for in a few weeks God is just not like the air he's in a body Moses seen him pass and said it looked like the back part of a man now listen even God in theophany that had not took on the form of Jesus flesh yet everybody with me he still look like a man right but he saw the back part the hinder part yeah didn't couldn't see the front and then that same theophan now look that same theophany was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld him in the only begotten of the father who Christ Exodus 33 this is the account and the Lord said unto Moses I will do this thing also that thou has spoken for thou Hast found Grace in my sight look God had found so much grace in Moses give him so much grace excuse me and I Know Thee by name so he's had a relationship with him lip to ear and all that in the scriptures but finally Moses said hey I want to see you I saw you in a pillar of fire I saw you in these certain things I want to see you face to face and God said mm can't see me face to face cuz he said look now watch I want you to see how this develops for thou Hast found Grace in my sight and I Know Thee by name now see that's the only way he couldn't enter Moses come on he couldn't reside in Moses he could anoint him Moses could feel him but he never resided as the Holy Ghost resides in me and you and he said I beseech thee show me th look show me he didn't say show me your body he said Show Me Your Glory and God said look you know what the goodness of God is he's fixing to tell you right here we talk about the goodness of God and we sing about the goodness of God the only goodness of God is is that he's a human being and he's Eternal and he's perfect and he's imparting it to me and you that's the goodness of God cuz he he said look I will make all he didn't say I'll make my body he said I'll make all my goodness pass before thee now watch and I will proclaim the name of the Lord before thee and will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and show Mercy on whom I will show mercy and he said thou cast not see my face for there shall no man see me and live amen how holy a God but that God became and I'm going say it like this became so Unholy he came into a human flesh that was stinking rotting getting ready to getting ready to die he came into something like that to show itself to me and you so that he could take us into the Holiness of himself and he'll have scars all over his body and nail prints and we won't have that and the Lord said behold there is a place by me and thou shalt stand upon a rock and it shall come to pass while my look he never says my body he he says my Glory passest by that I will put thee in the Cliff of The Rock and I will cover thee with my hand while I pass by and I will take away mine hand and thou shalt see my back Parts but my face shall not be seen now brother Bram continues I I don't think I found the quote but brother Bram says Moses saw the back part of Jesus Christ all right that wasn't the flesh that theophany had become so real into this Dimension till Moses looked at it it looked just like a human being right cuz it was a human being it was a human being when we talk about humanity and human being we think about this rotten and getting older and dying and getting gray and getting bald God's in a human body right and it's perfect amen cuz listen if he can't get into one we can't right if he didn't come to Perfection we can't well don't get quiet on me if he can't come to Perfection we can't we know he came to Perfection therefore we can come to Perfection all right now brother Brown we he talks about this about Loose Ends the loose ends now watch I want to read this quote in 59 I want to take this scripture Matthew 28:19 go ye and teach All Nations baptized in the name of the Father and Son and Holy Ghost how was you baptized in the name of the father and the name of the son in the name of the Holy Ghost that's not even written in the scripture and I want some man the Blessed Holy Trinity find me the word Trinity anywhere in the pages of God's Bible it said look it's a manmade scheme it's not the logos an old dirty Church rag right wrapped around to take the place of the sapine of God's holy spirit that's why God couldn't move through the church ages he got bound right so something got cut there's no such a thing there's no such a thing you find it and come to me your duty bound to do it as a Christian if you find it it's not in God's holy writings and the father Son and Holy Ghost is hatched out of hell that's pretty strong you believe the L people in what year was that 1959 there's a lot of people left him and didn't walk with him after that and father son Holy Ghost is hatched Out of Hell there's no such thing as three Gods amen Revelation chap 5 1961 now if that was all hatched out of hell hell being Eternal was hatched out of hell you know what he's saying he says that Doctrine didn't start in heaven in in layman terms that he's saying he separate said that Doctrine didn't start in heaven the Lost never spoke that when the Lost was in Christ said baptized in the name of the father and of the Son and the Holy Ghost that Locust wasn't thinking three titles but he hid it from man so that man had to come to a revelation pise the Lord man had to come to a revelation that that was saying the same thing because that logos that theophany of God that was standing there that said that he just moved over into Peter and said the same thing but he told him exactly cuz now you know something there's a name attached to it in the name of the father son Holy Ghost what is the name of the father son Holy Ghost Lord Jesus Christ right right that's why all the lose s that's why brother Ram had to come because listen when the son of man Ministry hits the Earth and I contend it's here now can't have one error to it right did Jesus have one error was there a time when he said I didn't oh whoops I'm sorry I didn't do what the father said today right you said boy that's that's just insurmountable well listen if the guy that spoke it and the guy that wrote it is inside of you Romans 8 says if that same spirit that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you it'll Quicken your mortal Body by that same spirit that dwells in you but listen to this boy I thought this was pretty neat we talk about Jubilee now remember just a background some of you that hadn't been here along we are living under the seven Jubilee years in the Bible according to Leviticus you could read it Leviticus 25 24 and 25 everybody with me if you've been here a long time you know brother Dell's already covered this because the church ages they couldn't get all the way out of their denominational idea so they were under a seven cuz remember every seven years there was a the Jubilee year and certain amount of things got to go free certain amount of things had to stay just for just for an overview we may cover it later on but did everybody understand that every seven years was not a golden jubilee it was a seven years Jubilee that every seven years something got to go free but not everything remember if you m just read it cuz if you Mar somebody and you married them over they gave you a wife you had to leave her and all this it's kind of complicated because listen you had to leave something right am we're not living in an age of leaving something they and Luther they left something Wesley they left something Pentecost they left something and this message we'll leave nothing cuz listen we're in a 50 now we're in a jubilee we've been called out of the church ages the church ages is seven Church ages times seven years is 49 yes we're at the Jubilee we preached this before brother Dev preached it before when they got the Holy Ghost it was on pente cost that's right 50 and let me tell you something they got to go free in their soul but they didn't get to go free in their body CU it wasn't time because another seven years started or another church a started there is no other Church ages so we've been called out of the church ages you stay in the church ages you're going to die that's right but watch now okay I said all that and now look watch what brother R says Watch the watch the logos speak to us they could not hold it for that past that 50th day he means 50th year cuz that was the day of Jubilee when everything back went back to its original beginning now just for an overview real quick when they had a jubilee over seven years they let something go and something had to stay right but that 49th year that next year was a supposed to be a jubilee year where every listen if you ow $10 million and had 300 slaves at the end of that year you went back to zero dollars and zero slaves and you started all over again that's why the Jews have never celebrated a physical Jubilee year now you can read that on the internet they've never done it cuz you know what the Jew ain't going to give up $10 million just because the Bible said so a holy ghost fill one would amen but not a but not a but not a a regular Jew that's got all this wealth and all of a sudden he's back to zero cuz it it it levels everybody out right so now watch though watch what he says watch what he saying real quick cuz that was a day of Jubilee when everything went back to its original original beginning now remember Jesus was the beginning of the creation of God right the beginning of the creation of God the power of God was taken back to its original the 50th day or 50th year he means the Year of Jubilee when all things went back what did Jesus say he came out of the Tomb he said what all power in other words lay your ho down take your shackles off turn your books back cuz everything's went back to zero now I am going to bring everything back and I'm not going to leave one thing but they didn't believe it right exactly and it started right back to that seventh year again seven years again and it just kept on that cycle of seven seven years seven Church ages and they didn't get all the way out they had to go right back into bondage because they had a false doctrine that took them back into bondage amen false Doctrine cannot set you free never will never has set you free but Jesus came and spake unto them saying all poers given unto me in heaven and earth now where'd he give it to after that we'll see you in a minute because remember he breathed on them after he came out of the Tomb and there will come another Year of Jubilee and that we've had it just about this time if you notice Pentecost has been falling in America for about 50 years somewhere on that time just about 50 years ago Pentecost began to fall now what's happening the church is receiving the seven sealed book of the revelation of Jesus Christ of the Seven Seals not one tenth of them can receive it cuz remember even though they blew the trumpet they blew the message right got on the highest mountain they could get on got brother said get up the highest tree they could get on and when they sounded that trumpet you laid down your hole and you went free but remember there was a group of people that didn't want to there's a group of people that enjoyed the life they were living they enjoyed come on somebody they enjoyed the world more than they enjoyed God so what happened was the priest would look and say hey all these people have left what's wrong with you well I just think I'll I'll take this old false Doctrine and and I'll just live any way I want to I just can't help it he said come here I'm going to give you a sign right that's right I'm going to take take and I'm going to take an all and I'm going to put your ear up against the temple post everybody understand that they were in church put it against the temple post and Bard a hole in your ear that's right that's right EXA right if you wear earrings you bound I guess whatever ESP guys but anyway so you Bor that and that was a sign that you could never ever never didn't matter the next seven years didn't matter the next seven years brother Danny it didn't matter for the rest of that person's life that Mark was on them and they died lost right they died in bondage just because they made a choice not to go free cuz everybody could go I mean the priest didn't go now you can go and you can't no you laid your hold down you laughed if you stood there and you stayed in the field and you were happy where you was at they marked you and you stayed marked the rest rest of the time it wasn't just let oh I forgive you a little bit later no I was the rest of your life am so let's don't be bored in the air tonight he that have an near let him hear what the spirit says to the church the logos that's the spirit of God but when you begin to see the year Jubilee where we don't have to fuss and strain and pull like this but we're already secured in Christ we already have the name of the the Lord Jesus Christ now watch him he's putting his loose hands together he's telling them listen you got a pathway now thank you amen we have all these great Mysteries that we're going to bring up in the Seven Seals and prove to you that them was the seals that were sealed from the eyes of the people right of God being my helper I'll prove to you that they could not see that by the Bible amen even though they looked at the letter of it then sure if the Bible said so you'll believe it that they could not see nothing but father son Holy Ghost until this time come on you see that how that was so that ingrained in that third Church age when n see a Rome when those Catholics come out and said this is the way it's going to be we're going to baptize like this if not you're going to die and they accepted it right B the air right they got bored in the air that's right they could not see that there was no eternal hell until this time they couldn't see the father son Holy Ghost was false until this time they could not see that there was an eternal security I mean for the real believer of course there's been a mock of it all the way around an uncertain sound they give that's the reason the people they say why look at them Presbyterians and so forth smoke and drink and everything else and say they got eternal security yeah but you see that's to throw off the real trumpet he said let's find out back here find out whether the trumpet sounded we we know we've the the trumpet's already been sounded the shout The Voice the trumpet it's here we're not looking for it man may be looking for it but I'm not if you don't come Plum back to Genesis revelations back and forth when this seal is open see these things being revealed Revelations 3:14 to the angel of the Church of LA to s write these things sayth the amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God now the beginning of the creation of God began as brother R said in the womb of a woman not Son of God the title of Son of God was over here the Creator he's the one that was the logos he was the one that that took a body form amen perfect complete Eternal no flesh he had his own flesh I believe a theophan got flesh okay it's just ain't a flesh that you brother Brown said an eye better than your eye ear better than your ear you see what I'm see what I'm saying cuz he had to be in that form to say I'm going to make something in my form right I'm going to create something in my image but the beginning of the creation of God made him the son of man back the way it should have been had there not been a fall don't get quiet remember a couple Sundays ago this Revelations chapter 4 remember a couple Sundays ago we got to it that big diamond but it's cut many different ways to reflect the fire and light from it that's the way Jesus Christ is the beginning of the creation of God Revelations 1 is that right then when was God created he is the beginning of the creation of God and God is eternal is that right but when God was created when a little baby that was conceived in the womb of a mother a virgin and she began to develop these cells within her to bring forth this little baby that was the beginning of God's creation cuz remember God may have gave you a soul but your body wasn't spoken into existence right everybody sitting in this building and everybody that lives in this world knows how well not Young on but we all know how that happens amen and it might be a Wonder ful thing but we men own the one side of the germ and the woman owns the other side there's nothing Supernatural about it now the bringing it together and bringing you was pretty Supernatural but he's talking about man have nothing to do with it right just believe that's right that was the beginning of God's creation for God was made flesh and dwelt Among Us and became Emanuel God With Us the beginning of the the creation of God now watch then in that great Jewel that come from the dust because he was he was made of dust is that right eat food like we did talking about Jesus Christ eat food like you do dust of the body he became Cal and potach petroleum Cosmic light but in him dwelt Eternal Light okay now we don't start out that way he did all right but we end up that way if we accept that he started that way everybody with me on that right he started with eternal light we didn't but when we receive eternal life it's just like he started remember because we're a new creation everything goes back that's the only time you need to go back no wonder the wise men said to the star guide us to thy Perfect Light they were just reflecting the light of one Perfect Light and there he was the perfect light of God the beginning of the creation of God and then brother Brown tells us later on he says you are a Contin uation of that creation if there's a beginning there's got to be something that that progresses from that cuz remember in the beginning God created heaven and earth well are we stuck back there no we're here today just a few more minutes God himself came down into a blood cell and wrapped the blood around him the blood cell The Germ of Life Of God himself wrapped in this blood cell that brought forth the son Christ Jesus now what he did does by that to make you perfect and to bring you back into Fellowship he brings you through that blood cell by Supernatural birth everybody with me into himself you get it through the blood cell of the Lord Jesus that unveiled the life of Jehovah and we coming through the blood cell becomes a part of that life not what you're sitting in today right he's talking about eternal life so deity itself lays in the man that's received the Holy Spirit you are a son I'm a Brandon by birth and a part of Mr MIRS brandom is in me and if you become a son or a daughter of God part of deity lays in you amen do you believe that sir we better start believing it cuz that's what's going to emanate from now on that's what's going to come out when we to that statue of perfect man when we get up to the top what happened all that water started coming out took all the trash out of it and became really Pure Clean Water that's what we're going to work on this this uh this year if we make it through another year did you never ever notice a baby when it's born it's little muscles twitching and jerking we've been through this before it becomes a living soul and as soon as a soul goes back from that little body there's another one waiting for it now that's not two souls okay cuz I'm going to read you a quote here in just a minute to make sure that we know where where that Soul's at and stays because first God makes the soul in spirit it just goes into the body so what's happening when man and woman gets together and they they have the act and and the the the muscles start making and and they're connected to the mother and the blood flows through the mother into the into the baby and she eats and it gets bigger and it makes parts and then it comes out all right but before that it's just Wiggly muscles It's Not a Human Being now they can say all they want to about all this and I agree abortion is totally wrong but brother R tells us that unless it breathes breath it's not a human being right right right cuz listen there's not a bunch of souls hanging around over here that ain't got a body to go to God ain't that way right he knows exactly what he's doing and he knew that was going to happen but that's just the devil perverting what's supposed to be good and when we leave here we only change Dwelling Places and go to another for if this Earthly Tabernacle be dissolved we have one already waiting so that's our consolation the comforter 1961 now watch it's just like a little baby when a little baby is conceived in the mother's womb it's just Flesh and Blood jumping quivering amen reaction to um neurons and and and all that you know it's it's firing cuz you do have a heartbeat I mean the thing starts beating after how many weeks six weeks or so after the conception but as soon as it's born you don't see it but there's a spirit in the soul hanging near that mother to come into that baby just soon as it's born do we believe brother R was a prophet I believe he could see in another dimension and I believe he could see that just as soon as that baby is born God has created a soul and created a spirit to be in that baby just as soon as it's born into this world that little baby becomes matured and it begins to learn then it becomes a living Soul when it knows what's right or wrong now listen it's not a dead one it has a choice to make amen cuz remember all babies go to heaven if you're under the age of accountability there's nothing held against you so that soul will become Eternal it's not Eternal it'll become Eternal when we get over on the other side everybody with me now this is it's just as simple as to me it's the simplest way to to you know man can say this and say that but this is is very simple what happens to a human being at Birth and at death and while we're here and it becomes a living soul that knows what's right or wrong then it's got just like Adam and Eve set before a tree of right and wrong it makes its Choice and then it becomes intelligent it's growing all the time in God's Great economy finally it comes down to the end of the road for this physical body and just as this body is deteriorating and going away there's one being prepared to receive it not one over there it's it's you it's your soul it's inside of you you know you may be all humped over a hundred years old but if you're born again today your soul is 18 years old I just wished it would come out every once in a while there's one being prepared to receive it just as soon as it leaves here this Soul that's in us now and look this Spirit leaves this body and goes to another a young one a good one a better one a one that won't get old or one that won't pass away he's a good god certainly is am so listen to this this a church age book we'll stop right here now this is going to explain a lot of things CU you can say well he's explaining I got a soul over there and then I just migrate over to this one uh-uh cuz the soul is a being it's a real you there's not another soul of you somewhere come on thatd make you another person somewhere you'd be a schizophrenic or whatever they call that that multiple personalities you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence now watch God he just explained that God is waiting there with life not eternal life life just like he did Adam he put life into Adam he breathe that's why you smack the baby it starts breathing what God give it life he didn't give it eternal life he gave it a life to make a choice but that soul never will leave your body until you die unless God decides like he did Brother randam to take you over into another dimension and show you what's going on that was one man is your if you well some of us may have took a trip but who knows so anyway I got a cousin is he said my sister takes a trip and never leaves a recliner so you will want to know if I believe in the doctrine of pre-existence now watch this is how he explains it I don't believe in that Mormon doctrine of pre-existence of souls all right Mormon Doctrine is we were all people in another dimension with God I mean with god well God in Jesus okie dokie and Lucifer was there we all kind of lived around each other and all of a sudden somebody got an idea Jesus got the idea that we need to come to Earth to display the father pretty much what it is it may not be everything but I had two Mormons work for me and they tried to explain it it's it's really confusing this is very much more less confusing is just I'm right here and I go there but they believe that pre-existence so then you come down here and inhabit bodies but Lucifer had a better plan he thought so they presented it to the father Jesus did and Lucifer did and of course the father's going to take the son's side and Lucifer got left out well Lucifer got mad as any other devil would and so he said I've gather me a bunch of people and we'll go do our own thing well that's their pretty much their Doctrine so that's how we got down here so brother R said I don't believe in that Mormon Doctrine the pre-existence of souls so look any more than I believe in reincarnation or transmigration which means God forbid I can go into your body and you could come into mine God see that's why you you're not switching around you are who you are from birth to death you're that person you're here to make a choice if you make the wrong choice you're going over there to be judged if you make the right choice you're going over here to have eternal life you have eternal life here but it's taking you somewhere into a place of Refuge a place to stay all right so he don't believe in reincarnation either we're not going to come back as somebody else we're not going to come back as a tree or a set of drums or anything like that that's what the Islamic people or whoever that is they believe that I that is why they don't kill bugs and all that stuff because they believe it's their ancestors that'd be horrible be careful here and see this it's not the person watch that comes predestinated eternally from God it's the word or seed listen I'm not interpolating but I'm telling you it's the seed that develops it that's what develops this whole thing the word are we not word born children and know what you we're word born children all right now listen we're born of Samuel and Peggy de to make a choice to become word born children then that Soul then is not exchanged that soul is not killed because when your if your soul dies you're way over under because there's only one person that can kill the soul soul and that's God amen amen remember he stood here on Earth he said don't you worry about them people that can kill your body you better worry about that guy that can kill your soul and send it to hell now who is that that ain't the devil that's God but it's because of the choice you make that's right be careful here and see this it's not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word of SE or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grow grasp the god Eternal god with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Jacob have I loved but Esau have I hated and neither was born neither had done good and evil but God saw in his mind by for knowledge which one would and which one wouldn't put them down here give them a choice but he already knew what the choice was see it was the thought look then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed part of God Jacob alone had the seed that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ so there's a there's not just you you already had it right you'll hear the word then the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you will receive the word for your day and age see how clear the true evidence becomes when the word is revealed to you Jesus was the royal seed he lived in the human body when the spirit called to him he went to Jordan it was baptized in water upon obeying the word the Holy Spirit came upon him and a voice said this is my beloved Son hear you him the voice did not say this is become my son Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost positioned him see remember brother brother Brown made it clear and I'm we made it clear here Jesus was not just a mortal human something and then he received the Holy Ghost to make him God on the River Jordan the Bible says he was born Emmanuel God With Us how much more plain can you be anything past that I don't believe amen if you want to make him something common yeah he was common he was common God Amen Jesus was the son the Holy Ghost positioned him as that son before them all just like you will me and you then having been filled thus in the same pattern holds at Pentecost and Ever After he went and demonstrated power receiving the full revelation of God and from God for that day Paul says I pray God your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless until the coming of our Lord Jesus look Faithful Is He that calls you who also will do it he's the only one that can preserve you you just got to make Choice all right let's read this when it come musicians come on when that sacrifice is received by the fire and it goes up like that and the smoke goes up you rise up with your sacrifice into the heavenlies and you're sealed away from the things of the world then our souls on his altar what are you done then after you have been died then what are you to do then you are conceived a new you are conceived a new you was first first conceived in iniquity let's stand to our feet now you're conceived in something new right what is it the Living Word all that changes it now doesn't it now we're through the struggle after seeing what you got to do now what happens you're conceived a new in the Living Word all right you begin to see things different where once you couldn't see that once you couldn't see water baptism what you couldn't see there was no eternal hell couldn't say about the the not the legalism of the of the word of God but the truth of the word of God Amen it's like what brother said we're not legalists people call us legalists we just doing what the Bible said all right where once you couldn't see that now you do see it there's something different now makes all the scriptures come together makes everything dovetail just right then now now something begins to happen now you die to your own thinking now you're conceived because we are Washed by the Water of the word is that right what do you do with a baby as soon as it's born you wash it is that right as soon as a man has died to himself and born of God he's Washed by the Water of the word amen if it says Jesus name you say Jesus name if it says You must be born again let's say the same thing ever what God says you're washed by that water of the word amen now look now read this right here now you're ready now for for life you thought you had life back then you're dead while you're alive that's what the Bible says you're she's dead while she liveth has a name she's dead they're ready to be start out now now you're born a new born in the family of God with new parents yes sir your tutor used to be now you got tutors that is now you got a new parent you can't be born without having a parent so if you're born in the Brotherhood of a church that's what you got if you're born in a Creed there you are but if you're born in God conceived in his word you got a new parent that's God ready to make his word known among you with you and speak it through you the logos oh a new parent that parent is God he's ready to take his word now that he's already spoke and lay it in you and make it come to life now look we've been talking about training we've been talking about Statue of perfect man he said now now you have your training now you're ready to go into training now child training that's the hard part when you think you ought to do this and the word Cuts you around and shows you something else huh while they believe that over that don't make any difference what they believe here's what God said you must be about the father's business now you're getting born again now you're getting right getting straightened out you have a new parent so in order if you're born again and got a new parent then you got a new nature the old Nature's dead and you got a new nature you listen your soul didn't die that old nature that was attached to your soul has died all right you once was going one way now you're going another way you once was going in this way down now you're going this way up your affections are set on things above a new affection I want to ask this question has this happened to you has this happened to you if not you're not born again maybe you're in the in the in the motion but this is what it ends up to amen right you once was going this way now you're going this way your affections are set on things above a new affection you don't love the things of the world no more your affections of God you don't care what man says how they laugh at you and say you're an old model or whatever it is like that you don't care cuz you're born of above and your affections are set on things above God's not ashamed of you God's not ashamed of you and you're not ashamed of him amen that's right read the 11th chapter of Hebrews I got it wrote down just why people in that day how they did how they wered about sheep skinn desert destitute everything else of whom the world's not even worthy of read it it'll be good for you you can see there what people when their natur's changed what happens amen not an exchange of a soul is your soul changed into the image of God Amen you're turned back you have a new thought process if that hasn't happened to you this year please say I'm working on it or he's still working on me right because that's what it's going to take you've got to realize it though I can't realize it I'll see the works of it amen it's got to start with you in your bedroom or you in your closet or you and your wherever you in your house it's got to start with you then it will emanate out if there's a change yeah we'll see it amen I used to didn't go to church didn't care a thing about it right for about 20 years it never even I mean well Mama call you and make you come a couple times a year but that was just to make Mama happy and she knew that but she called anyway but she was wanting me to be saved she was wantan me to get under the fountain she was want me to get somewhere close to Believers and get all that junk out of the world out of me well until I told God I was done with all that and he filled me with the Holy Ghost I still did the same thing amen amen you see me a couple times a year that's why I said we don't have to preach to Believers about coming to church it's the unbelievers that we preach on sorry about that let's sing a song God bless you but born by the Breath of God the literal Breath of God he changes you by that he's the only one that can you be breathed

give you any Joy all he's going to get listen all satan can do is give you temporary Joy a high a fix uh um um some kind of emotion um but it's not Eternal that's why we need to let go and let God if we let go and let God that's something Eternal and that Eternal will open up and let him in remember he's standing at the door knocking standing at the door knocking hallelu he is here amen he is here

now if you're at home and watching in and you don't get one of these prayer cloths just cut your a little section of cloth off of something and and um a handkerchief or something while you're at home and and be a part of us we don't want you to be excluded we can't send you a prayer cloth right now but just cut your little piece off and and hold it in your hand and pray cuz that that listen those are handkerchiefs okay I mean we had some bed clothes that brother R prayed over and we had some of this that we prayed over and U but it it's the believing that God's going to do what his word said it was going to do okay so so you can cut a cloth off of something and and and just hold on to it and pray the prayer of faith we're not going to pray just a regular prayer we're going to pray a prayer of faith that God will move on that situation at our house and that situation at Ashley's house okay cuz cuz Ashley's got um she's got a sister Ashley's got a uh um a disease and uh if y'all have not seen her she's about as skinny as that and I know she's bothered and worried and and there seems to be a spirit following her or spirit in her house according to brother Boyd said Jeffrey had seen it in different ones but um we're going to pray listen the Bible said not only people were healed he said evil spirits left that's why we got one over these doors that's why we got one in our home that's why we got one in different places cuz I can't pray every 10 seconds two seconds but that prayer cloth can be there as a symbol for me same way Paul wasn't probably around when they cut the coats up but they they knew Paul had War them they knew there was an anointing on Paul they knew according to the Bible that there was an old man that was dead and they throw his bones in on a dead man and they jumped to life because there was life in those prophets Beyond just their regular life and they believed that so Paul they cut the they cut the things off of Paul and Paul didn't have to be there brother Brown's not here brother D's not here different ones are not here to pray but we're here we're here to pray the prayer way that these cloths are going to go in our Bibles to Psalms 23 and sister Johnny she's at home I'm sure watching now and thank you for um uh standing up for that am and we sure appreciate that appreciate them doing that but as we pray if you're at home but Danny if you're at home just get you a just get you a cloth cut you a piece off put it in in the Book of Psalms there and and just believe just believe that we're listen we're moving some we're move something's moving that's what we want we want something to move just give all them around there and when y'all get finished praying is we sure appreciate our musicians sometimes they get kind of left out in certain things but I don't want to leave them out I want them to to be able to uh to join in and and pray and let pray and let's see God move I believe he will I mean why do we come to church why do we struggle if we don't think God's not going to do anything oh yeah he might not do he might do not do what I want him to do at the time I want him to do it but he's going to do it in the time he wants to do it exactly but you know what we can do we can call on him create an atmosphere brother Brown that's what he said create an atmosphere that God can move into he ain't going to move into an Era of Confusion he's not going to move into to to us being irreverent in church and all the different things I mean I mean man you ought to go to some of these to uh denominational churches it's totally just like a lodge and I'm sorry but that's what brother rown said amen they're just talking about everything in the world and they call it Fellowship well it's just talking about the ball game and about the grocery prices being up and and good to have you and you know all this stuff but no reverence at all none just like going in sitting down hearing something you know and then going back home I didn't say it brother BR declared them lodges so they're not going to be anything but that because we believe God sent a prophet everybody got one now all right so let we're going to dismiss with this put them in your Bible let's see God work every one of you at home put this in your Bible let's see God move let's bow our heads dear heavenly father Lord I pray that what we've said tonight has been the logos of God it's been the truth and Lord as the truth Goes Forth and it lands Into the Heart of believer of a Believer then that creates a power an atmosphere of faith that they can believe that you are God and you change not you are God with a body but now you're in a body of Believers that are now with our as we would say our our old carnal hands that we have but Lord you said you were going to come down into human flesh and make us perfect so Lord I pray in the name of the Lord Jesus that that as our sister has spoken that we do what is it she said put it in Psalms 23 and and we pray for brother Dale we pray for sister Ashley and anybody else that we have on our heart Lord I pray that you'd save our children and and and Lord in this year Lord may we not add members to the church but Lord may we add Holy Ghost filled people somebody that God you can use and that and that we can have the gifts working in our life and the gifts working in the church Lord and the things Lord that we that we know you require as having worship father I pray that that we'll become under that Lord and that we'll become more like you Lord as this year continues there'll be challenges and and changes and and life lessons and life ups and downs Lord but let us know one thing for sure that you're God and you change not Lord You're thoughts are Eternal and your thoughts are not ever going to change father but I pray Lord that youd change our thoughts to your thoughts that you would change our ways to your ways that you would keep us and bless us L Lord I
