[24:31] congregation father through your word
[24:33] we commit these things into your hands
[24:35] now in the lovely name of the lord jesus
[24:37] christ
[24:38] amen amen praise the lord jesus genesis
[24:41] chapter 2
[24:43] genesis chapter 2 verse 4 through 9 and
[24:45] then we'll read
[24:46] verses 15 and 17 of the same chapter
[24:49] and then we'll go through revelations
[24:51] chapter 2 verse 7.
[24:53] bible says here genesis 2 4 these are
[24:56] the generations of the heavens and of
[24:58] the earth
[24:58] when they were created in the day that
[25:00] the lord god made the earth and the
[25:02] heavens
[25:03] and every plant of the field before it
[25:05] was in the earth and every herb of the
[25:07] field
[25:09] before it grew for the lord god had not
[25:11] caused it to rain upon the earth and
[25:13] there was not a man to till the ground
[25:16] but there went up a mist from the earth
[25:18] and watered the whole face of the ground
[25:20] and the lord god formed man of the dust
[25:23] of the ground
[25:24] and breathed into his nostrils the
[25:26] breath of life
[25:28] amen and man became a living soul
[25:32] and the lord god planted a garden
[25:35] eastward
[25:36] in eden and there he put the man whom he
[25:39] had
[25:40] formed and out of the ground made the
[25:43] lord god to grow
[25:44] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[25:48] all right and the good for food
[25:52] and and then it says notice that there's
[25:54] a differentiation
[25:56] there these trees right here at the
[25:57] beginning are good for food but then now
[26:00] this one this tree here says
[26:02] the tree of life also in the midst of
[26:05] the garden
[26:07] and the tree of knowledge of good and
[26:10] evil
[26:10] so to me it sounds like it's just these
[26:12] these are the tree of life is is
[26:14] something
[26:15] the tree of good and evil is something
[26:17] and then the trees they're
[26:19] good for food that's something else amen
[26:22] praise god
[26:23] and the lord god took the man at verse
[26:25] 15
[26:26] and the lord god took the man and put
[26:28] him in the gar into the garden of eden
[26:30] to dress it
[26:31] and to keep it and the lord god
[26:33] commanded the man saying
[26:35] of every tree of the garden thou mayest
[26:37] freely eat
[26:39] watch but of the tree of the knowledge
[26:41] of good and evil thou shalt not
[26:43] eat of it for in the day that thou
[26:45] eatest thereof thou
[26:46] shalt surely die amen
[26:50] and we'll stop right there uh rev let's
[26:51] just skip down to revelations chapter 2
[26:54] verse 7. revelations 2 verse 7
[26:59] he that hath an ear let him hear what
[27:01] the spirit saith
[27:02] unto the churches to him that overcometh
[27:06] will i give to eat of the tree of life
[27:10] amen which is in the midst of the
[27:12] paradise of god
[27:14] praise the lord you may be seated this
[27:16] morning
[27:18] amen
[27:22] amen as we were reading these scriptures
[27:23] you notice that in all all of these
[27:25] trees that were mentioned
[27:27] they are all trees that you eat off of
[27:32] but some amen are trees that you eat off
[27:35] of physically
[27:37] and some are trees that you eat off of
[27:39] spiritually amen
[27:40] now you can eat you can eat from the
[27:43] from the tree of the knowledge of good
[27:45] and evil
[27:46] amen just as much as you can eat from
[27:49] the tree of life
[27:50] amen you can you can you can eat from
[27:52] that tree amen uh
[27:54] and you will live by that tree or you
[27:56] will die from that
[27:57] by that tree depends on just what tree
[27:59] you're eating
[28:01] you see amen so but in all these trees
[28:04] amen you
[28:05] are you have you you you you can eat off
[28:08] of amen
[28:09] in other words because i'm going to get
[28:11] to something here just a moment in other
[28:12] words
[28:13] you choose how you want to live your
[28:15] life
[28:17] you choose how you want to serve if you
[28:19] want to serve the lord or not
[28:21] god does not make you do anything in
[28:24] your life he does not force you amen
[28:26] it's your choice amen just as much as it
[28:28] was a choice for
[28:29] eve and for adam there in the garden of
[28:32] eden amen god has given us that same
[28:34] free will

[28:49] because i want to hear the word not
[28:50] because brother dale was not going to be
[28:52] there or not
[28:53] no amen you chose to come to the house
[28:54] of god because you wanted to hear the
[28:56] word amen
[28:58] amen not a man a motivation from a man
[29:01] not a motivation from anything else but
[29:03] the word was the one who should have
[29:05] motivated you amen
[29:07] praise god and if that motivation is not
[29:10] in you amen then
[29:11] today is the day that you can receive
[29:13] that motivation amen
[29:14] some people ask you man how in the world
[29:16] can you get so happy about god and

[29:39] can say amen that

[32:08] everything that he has to offer through
[32:09] his word amen
[32:11] praise god yes and it was granted amen
[32:14] god had that's the reason why god had to
[32:16] send the message in this day that's why
[32:18] god had to do what he had to do send us
[32:20] a prophet in this day amen to provide to
[32:24] give us the way amen
[32:25] so that we could have full access to the
[32:27] things of god amen
[32:29] it's been laying in the word all these
[32:31] years but man had been probing
[32:33] here and there trying this password
[32:35] trying this password what does this mean
[32:37] what does this mean and maybe seeing a
[32:40] little bit here and there amen but today
[32:42] amen as message believers amen we have
[32:44] full
[32:45] access to the kingdom of god in this
[32:47] hour now if you don't want to if you
[32:49] don't know about the word you don't know
[32:51] what this message talks about
[32:53] that's uh that's that's that's your
[32:55] fault
[32:56] it's not god's fault the message has
[32:59] been here the word has been
[33:00] open the book has been opened amen it's
[33:03] because
[33:03] you don't get into it amen
[33:07] and so or i don't get into it you see
[33:11] sometimes amen we allow ourselves to
[33:13] become
[33:14] the very thing to prevent us from
[33:16] accessing the blessings of god
[33:19] we ourselves we are our worst enemy
[33:22] we're our worst stumbling block amen us
[33:25] ourselves praise god
[33:26] so we have no excuse in this hour amen
[33:28] we have full access today
[33:30] to the full blessings of god now the
[33:32] word access uh the definition of the
[33:34] word access
[33:35] i'll just read you these definitions it
[33:37] says permission liberty or ability to
[33:40] enter approach or pass to and from
[33:43] a place or to approach or communicate
[33:46] with a person or thing
[33:47] amen a permission praise god
[33:50] it's a freedom or ability to obtain or
[33:53] make
[33:54] use of something amen now we love we
[33:57] we love freedom amen here in america we
[34:00] we where we love freedom we
[34:01] we were founded upon those those those
[34:04] uh foundations of freedom
[34:06] and liberty you see it's something
[34:07] that's very dear to us amen and that
[34:09] and god created us to be free man free
[34:12] women amen
[34:13] praise praise god so we like freedom we
[34:15] like that access
[34:17] access to to everything freedom or
[34:19] ability to obtain or make use of
[34:21] something
[34:22] a way or means of entering
[34:25] or approaching amen a way
[34:28] or means of entering or approaching do
[34:31] you believe that jesus christ has made
[34:32] the way
[34:33] not only has he made a way but he is the
[34:35] way the bible says that he is the way
[34:38] the truth and the life
[34:40] and no man comes to the father except
[34:42] through him
[34:43] praise god you want full access to the
[34:45] blessings of god you want full access to
[34:47] the
[34:47] to the word of god to understand the
[34:49] word amen you do it through jesus christ
[34:51] amen there's no other way to understand
[34:53] the word but by his spirit
[34:55] amen again if you have the spirit of
[34:59] something else in your life a spirit of
[35:01] a singer
[35:02] or a spirit of of some a rock star or
[35:05] some rap star
[35:06] you're going to act like that person but
[35:09] if the spirit of god is in you
[35:11] if the spirit of jesus christ who god
[35:13] raised from the dead dwells in you
[35:15] it will quicken your mortal body you
[35:17] will act like jesus christ you will live
[35:19] like jesus christ
[35:20] you will you will you will think like
[35:22] jesus christ amen
[35:24] i like that concept because it's it's an
[35:26] easy concept to understand amen
[35:29] so if somebody says they're a christian
[35:31] and they acting like somebody else
[35:34] outside of christ you got to question
[35:37] that
[35:37] do they really have the spirit of christ
[35:39] dwelling in them amen
[35:41] praise god now what is the tree of life
[35:44] and we're reading here about the tree of
[35:46] life
[35:47] and so the phrase the tree of life you
[35:50] you find it in the bible only six times
[35:54] only six times you find that phrase the
[35:56] tree of life
[35:57] now there's there's uh uh and you find
[36:00] it three times in the book of genesis
[36:03] and three times in the book of
[36:04] revelation that's interesting
[36:07] the phrase the the phrase the tree of
[36:10] life now there's other places in the
[36:11] bible where you see where it says
[36:13] a tree of life amen for example uh in
[36:17] in proverbs chapter 11 verse 30 it says
[36:18] the fruit of the righteous is
[36:20] a tree of life and he that when his
[36:22] souls is wise proverbs 15 4 says
[36:25] a wholesome tongue is a tree of life but
[36:28] perverseness therein is a breach in the
[36:30] spirit
[36:31] but the phrase the phrase the tree of
[36:34] life is only found
[36:35] six times in the bible now
[36:38] six we know is the number is the number
[36:40] of men you see
[36:42] if you know the numerology of god for
[36:43] example three the number three
[36:45] represents perf uh uh perfection amen
[36:49] the number five represents grace the
[36:51] number seven represents completion
[36:53] the number eight represents eternal life
[36:56] or a new day or
[36:57] resurrection you see so it's it's it
[37:00] there's
[37:00] the numerology of god is is very
[37:02] important now it's interesting that
[37:05] the tree of life that phrase the tree of
[37:07] life
[37:08] is found in the two books that satan
[37:10] hates the most
[37:14] it's found in genesis and in revelation
[37:16] which is the two books that are attacked
[37:18] the most by man today
[37:22] and for us as christians we uh sometimes
[37:25] nominal christians uh uh don't have that
[37:28] try to probe here and there
[37:30] what does the book of revelation mean
[37:31] what does it mean about a seal what does
[37:33] it mean about a beast
[37:35] that rose up from the waters what does
[37:37] all that mean and because they don't
[37:38] understand it because the revelation
[37:40] hasn't come to them
[37:41] they just kind of leave it alone and
[37:42] just don't even preach about it don't
[37:44] even touch it amen
[37:45] that's and it's it's nothing but satan
[37:47] trying to bring him from a revelation
[37:49] that god
[37:50] god wants to give them amen that's how i
[37:52] was when i was in
[37:53] in in the nominal churches you know and
[37:55] but when god
[37:56] opens that thing to you amen when god
[37:58] reveals his word to
[38:00] amen you'll never be the same again
[38:03] you'll never see the word of god in the
[38:05] same light that you've seen it amen
[38:08] praise god so it's mentioned three times
[38:11] in the in the book of genesis and three
[38:13] times in the book of revelation six
[38:14] times in total amen and we know that the
[38:16] number six
[38:17] represents the number of man so that
[38:19] means that this
[38:21] phrase the tree of life is has a
[38:24] relation
[38:25] to man there's a relation there to man
[38:30] amen we're going to see about this the
[38:33] prophet says have you ever noticed how
[38:34] satan hates two books of the bible more
[38:36] than all
[38:37] others through liberal theologians and
[38:40] pseudoscientists he is always attacking
[38:42] the book of genesis
[38:43] and the book of revelation in both of
[38:46] these books we find satan's origin this
[38:48] is why satan hates it
[38:50] because in both of these books we find
[38:52] satan's origin
[38:53] his awful ways and his destruction
[38:57] satan is is on the rampage
[39:00] especially today because he knows he's
[39:04] his hand is coming soon
[39:06] and so he does not want to he he's
[39:09] already
[39:10] made his choice yes he's already made
[39:12] his choice he's already done what he's
[39:13] doing amen so he's just going all out
[39:16] and we see it represented in all these
[39:19] presidents and governors and stuff like
[39:20] man they're just going all out now
[39:24] we find satan's origin his awful ways
[39:26] and his destruction that is why he
[39:28] attacks them
[39:29] he hates to be exposed
[39:32] and in this book and in those books he
[39:34] is exposed for exactly what he is
[39:38] amen that's what sometimes when when a
[39:41] preacher is ministering and all of a
[39:42] sudden he's preaching on something
[39:44] that's hitting your life a little bit
[39:46] either
[39:47] you start you start getting mad and you
[39:49] start getting
[39:50] because if you have that devil that
[39:52] demon sitting there on you anointing you
[39:54] anointing that in your life he's being
[39:55] exposed
[39:56] and he hates it he hates being exposed
[40:00] praise god but he needs exposure amen so
[40:02] that you can see
[40:03] fully who he is and so that way you
[40:06] could kick him out of your life
[40:07] amen because if you don't know what's
[40:10] there to kick amen you won't be able to
[40:12] kick him out of your life amen but when
[40:13] you see him in plain view amen you know
[40:15] exactly what you need to take care of in
[40:17] your life
[40:18] praise god jesus said about satan he has
[40:22] no part in me and i have no part in him
[40:24] the devil would like to prove
[40:26] that different but he cannot so he does
[40:29] all he can to destroy confidence in the
[40:32] word
[40:33] and we see that today amen we see it in
[40:37] even in our very ranks but when the
[40:39] church disbelieves
[40:40] satan and believes the spirit's
[40:43] revelation of the word
[40:45] the gates of hell cannot prevail against
[40:48] her amen
[40:49] praise god so when you
[40:53] lay to the side of the word amen and you
[40:56] hear what the spirit has to say
[40:58] amen that ex that exposes satan that
[41:02] the gates of hell as the prophet said
[41:04] here cannot prevail against you
[41:06] so six times this phrasal tree of life
[41:09] is mentioned in the bible
[41:10] and um now i'm skipping down here
[41:15] so this tree has always had a relation
[41:18] to man amen
[41:20] and in all six of these places the this
[41:22] this phrase the tree of life
[41:25] signifies the same thing and doesn't
[41:28] ever signify anything different it
[41:30] signifies the same thing or in this case
[41:32] the same person
[41:34] praise god amen so before we see this uh
[41:38] uh tree of life i want to read here some
[41:40] scriptures
[41:41] where where god refers to man as trees
[41:44] amen
[41:44] in psalms chapter 1 verse 3 very
[41:47] familiar scripture to us it says blessed
[41:49] is the man
[41:50] i'm sorry psalm chapter 1 verse 1 2 3
[41:52] blessed is the man that walketh not in
[41:54] the council of the ungodly nor standeth
[41:56] in the way of sinners
[41:57] nor sitteth in the sea of the scornful
[41:59] but his delight is in the law of the
[42:01] lord
[42:02] and in his law doth he meditate day and
[42:04] night and he
[42:05] shall be look what the bible says and he
[42:07] shall be
[42:08] like a tree planted by the rivers of
[42:12] water
[42:13] amen that bringeth forth his fruit
[42:16] in his season his leaf also shall not
[42:19] wither
[42:19] and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper
[42:21] amen so there is
[42:23] there is an example there of god typing
[42:26] man with a tree
[42:27] praise god mark 8 24 another familiar
[42:31] scripture
[42:31] where jesus came and healed a blind man
[42:34] and when his eyes were open they asked
[42:37] him what he saw and the blind man said
[42:39] and he looked up and said
[42:41] i see man as trees walking
[42:44] amen i see man as trees walking so so
[42:48] many times in the bible
[42:49] uh where where trees are mentioned is a
[42:52] representation of man
[42:54] praise god so therefore if we are
[42:57] represented as man in the scripture
[43:00] then this tree of life that it talks
[43:03] about in genesis
[43:04] and that we read about in revelation
[43:06] must mean that it's a person as well
[43:09] must mean that is a is a it's a it's a
[43:12] it's a is an individual as well praise
[43:15] god
[43:16] and so if this tree of life is a person
[43:20] amen then the tree of the knowledge of
[43:22] good and evil
[43:24] must be a person as well
[43:27] amen yes because remember there was a
[43:29] differentiation there there was a
[43:31] differentiation of the trees that they
[43:33] could eat
[43:34] that adam and eve could eat and enjoy
[43:36] you see
[43:37] of the fruit of those trees but then now
[43:39] it comes to a tree of life
[43:42] in the midst of the garden in other
[43:44] words it was in the midst it was there
[43:46] the
[43:46] his presence was there but so was
[43:49] satan's presence
[43:50] now it goes back to the things that
[43:52] brother wade has been preaching about
[43:53] the two
[43:54] about the twins about the two the two
[43:56] spirits
[43:57] you see because wherever wherever jesus
[43:59] christ is satan is on the scene as well
[44:01] amen wherever there was a jesus there
[44:03] was a there was a judas
[44:05] amen wherever there was wherever god is
[44:08] amen satan is present there
[44:10] not to create something originally
[44:12] because satan cannot create
[44:15] but to copy what god has already done
[44:18] or to or to uh corrupt it
[44:22] that's why he has man the way he has him
[44:24] today and
[44:25] man is acting the way he is today it's a
[44:28] corruption
[44:30] it because man wants wants to worship
[44:33] man wants uh uh wants to worship god
[44:37] wants
[44:37] to serve a god he knows that there's a
[44:40] being
[44:41] there's something out there greater than
[44:43] he himself
[44:45] but satan comes in and interrupts that
[44:47] and and and
[44:48] and and corrupts that and gives them a
[44:51] lust
[44:52] or or and perverts that lust or perverts
[44:55] that thirst
[44:55] sorry perverts that thirst for god to
[44:58] the things of the world
[45:00] towards politics towards movies towards
[45:03] cigarettes towards alcohol towards
[45:05] sex towards all these things amen
[45:08] he perverts each and every one he
[45:10] perverts that thirst
[45:11] for god for all these other things and
[45:14] when you and when you and when you've
[45:15] had your share of all those things
[45:17] you realize you're still empty
[45:21] you're still empty and there but and
[45:24] you'll
[45:24] you cannot receive full satisfaction
[45:27] until you get to the tree of life
[45:29] amen i've been there done that
[45:33] i know many of you have as they say i've
[45:36] gotten the t-shirt
[45:37] the hat and the mouse pad to go with it
[45:41] nothing satisfies like the word of god
[45:44] in this hour
[45:45] young people nothing satisfies nothing
[45:48] satisfies
[45:49] like god amen now i've failed him many
[45:53] times
[45:55] and sometimes i don't do what i'm
[45:56] supposed to do amen
[45:58] but i tell you what there's nothing in
[46:00] me amen nothing in
[46:01] nothing in this world would ever cause
[46:03] me to disbelieve this word
[46:05] god help me amen because where
[46:08] like peter said where else could i go
[46:11] he's the only one that has the words of
[46:13] eternal life
[46:14] jesus christ peter knew it he peter said
[46:16] where else could we go lord
[46:19] you're the only one who's showing us the
[46:21] way
[46:22] amen and where else could we go amen
[46:26] thank you praise god there's no
[46:29] so so this person this tree of life must
[46:32] mean that it's a person
[46:34] it's it must be a person of life or the
[46:36] person
[46:37] of life amen and we know that the only
[46:40] person of life the author the originator
[46:42] of life is the lord jesus christ
[46:44] amen there is there's no original life
[46:47] in in anything else amen
[46:49] there's no original life in politics
[46:51] there's no original life in in in
[46:53] in in a president there's no original
[46:55] life in in in
[46:56] anything in this hour amen outside of
[46:58] the word
[47:00] praise god those things only bring amen
[47:03] just a temporal pleasure and when that
[47:07] excitement goes away
[47:08] then what you're empty that's the reason
[47:11] why a drug addict continues to take
[47:13] drugs
[47:14] because he's he that that that
[47:18] that weed smoking or whatever he's doing
[47:20] whatever drug he's taking
[47:22] that high is only for a temporary
[47:25] you see it's only for just a day or two
[47:29] right and then he's out looking and see
[47:31] see what he can sell or seeing what he
[47:33] can
[47:33] steal from somebody to sell so that he
[47:35] could go get more because he wants to
[47:37] feel the exact same way again
[47:39] amen but with the holy spirit in your
[47:40] life eternal life in your soul amen you
[47:42] can feel that high
[47:43] and more amen every single moment of
[47:46] your day
[47:47] amen if you choose to
[47:51] if you choose to feel it and it's not
[47:53] through some smoking it's not through
[47:55] some shooting up
[47:56] it's through the word of god coming to
[48:00] church
[48:01] being around the brethren amen that gets
[48:03] me high
[48:05] know about you that gets me high and man
[48:08] and it's a good high
[48:10] gets me higher above looking up
[48:13] where my redemption is drawing now amen
[48:15] praise god
[48:18] amen now john chapter six
[48:21] through eight uh we see there uh that
[48:24] jesus he declares himself there to be
[48:26] the source
[48:27] of eternal life amen just to just to
[48:30] point back amen we haven't lost our
[48:31] thought yet
[48:32] all access granted amen but there in
[48:35] john chapter 6 through 8 jesus declares
[48:37] himself to be
[48:38] the source of eternal life jesus there
[48:40] in those chapters calls himself the
[48:42] bread of heaven
[48:43] and the water of life and that if you
[48:46] ate from
[48:46] from him you would live forever now how
[48:49] how many would want that
[48:51] amen i i i i want that i mean
[48:54] i don't know who who doesn't want to i
[48:55] mean even portray it in the movies amen
[48:59] uh to for man to want to live forever to
[49:02] live
[49:02] to have eternal life to get access to
[49:05] something where they don't ever have to
[49:07] die anymore
[49:08] but the way they portray it is a
[49:09] perverted way the way god's portrayed it
[49:12] amen throughout the word amen is the
[49:13] true and only way amen praise god
[49:17] it's the true and only way now first
[49:18] john chapter 6 verse 35 jesus says
[49:21] and it says here and jesus said unto
[49:23] them i am the bread of life
[49:25] he that cometh to me shall never hunger
[49:29] amen and he that believeth on me shall
[49:31] never thirst
[49:32] now he was not talking about physical
[49:34] hunger and physical thirst there
[49:36] he was talking about a spiritual hunger
[49:38] and a spiritual thirst
[49:40] amen that hunger in that thirst that i
[49:41] was just speaking about
[49:43] that man come to this world with and
[49:45] they get
[49:46] and they're perverted to do other things
[49:48] amen that's the hunger and thirst that
[49:50] jesus can fulfill that he's talking
[49:52] about here
[49:53] john 6 1 51 says i am the living bread
[49:57] which came down from
[49:58] heaven if any man eat of this bread
[50:01] he shall live forever so the
[50:04] the the prescription is right there in
[50:07] the word
[50:10] it's just satan tries to keep our our
[50:12] our eyes
[50:13] away from the word to something else
[50:20] don't think that the word of god saints
[50:22] is only for the preacher
[50:23] to read that's right don't think that
[50:25] the word of god is only for just uh
[50:27] some scholar or some uh uh no the word
[50:30] of god is for
[50:31] you to read from the youngest to the
[50:33] oldest amen the message of the hour is
[50:36] for you to get in
[50:38] in it from the youngest to the oldest
[50:39] it's not just for the minister the
[50:41] pastor
[50:41] or the deacon amen it's for you amen you
[50:45] that's why this is an individual
[50:47] relationship between you
[50:49] and christ amen this is not a group
[50:52] access this is an
[50:54] individual access amen to this tree of
[50:57] life
[50:58] you've got to do your part in order for
[51:00] him to do his part
[51:02] and you say oh why can i see i don't see
[51:04] god i don't see
[51:05] i don't see god moving in my life i
[51:07] don't see god
[51:09] i want to see greater things in my life
[51:10] but what are you putting
[51:12] into the access are you what are you
[51:15] putting into it a man to get
[51:16] out of it you see that's why i said at
[51:20] the beginning
[51:20] what are you putting into the service
[51:22] amen in order for you to get out of the
[51:24] service
[51:25] amen whatever you put into the service
[51:27] that's what you'll get out of
[51:30] amen if you come here to criticize
[51:31] you're going to get some critics
[51:33] critical spirit
[51:35] amen you come here amen to say lord i
[51:37] want that word that's going forth to
[51:39] change me
[51:40] forget the man that's saying and forget
[51:43] the the preacher that's preaching it
[51:44] i want that word to come in me and
[51:46] change me from the way that i'm living
[51:48] today
[51:49] lord we live in perilous times we're
[51:52] living in troubleless times
[51:54] things are happening insecure
[51:57] insecurities are taking place unsure
[51:59] things are happening but
[52:01] god you're the only source of light
[52:03] you're the only protector in my life
[52:05] you're the only true source
[52:06] of joy in my life amen
[52:10] so i'm going there amen to receive some
[52:12] strength praise god
[52:15] and so jesus declaring about eternal
[52:18] life in first
[52:19] john chapter 5 verse 11 11-12 and it
[52:23] says there
[52:24] and this is the record that god hath
[52:27] given to us eternal life
[52:31] and this life is in his son
[52:35] amen not in anybody else
[52:39] his this life is in his son this life is
[52:42] not in president trump
[52:43] this life is not in joe biden this life
[52:46] is not in anybody else that's right
[52:48] there's no life in that i'm sorry to
[52:51] tell you
[52:52] i'm sorry i've crushed your dreams but i
[52:56] didn't crush them the bible did
[52:58] and you as a believer should know better
[53:00] all this stuff
[53:01] getting into politics and all these
[53:03] things amen you should know better than
[53:05] that
[53:06] and getting on facebook and things and
[53:08] and and becoming a politician yourself
[53:10] especially some of your sisters
[53:12] being politicians on facebook amen
[53:15] knowing amen that you should you should
[53:18] be
[53:19] you're not going to change anybody with
[53:20] that that's right the only way you're
[53:22] going to change somebody is with the
[53:23] word of god
[53:24] amen when you when you come in with the
[53:27] word of god amen that changes
[53:29] that helps somebody that gives hope to
[53:31] somebody amen but with the politics no
[53:33] it doesn't give hope to anybody
[53:36] amen praise god i don't know how i got
[53:39] into that
[53:40] lord help us he that hath the son
[53:44] hath life amen and he that hath not the
[53:48] son of god
[53:49] hath not life i just plain as black as
[53:52] day
[53:53] i mean black and white amen
[53:56] he that hath the son hath life not he
[53:59] that hath the president have life but he
[54:02] that hath the
[54:03] son hath life and he that hath not the
[54:05] son of god
[54:06] hath not life so the question is do you
[54:09] want the son of god
[54:11] in your life so that you can have full
[54:15] access to eternal life
[54:18] i want full access in this hour praise
[54:20] god amen how many love the lord
[54:23] are you still with me amen
[54:29] amen again i'm going to try to keep my
[54:31] word i'm not going to keep you
[54:33] now we see in genesis chapter 2 there in
[54:36] verse 8 and 9. let's just read this real
[54:38] quick and the lord god planted a garden
[54:40] eastward
[54:41] in eden and there he put the man whom he
[54:43] had formed
[54:45] and out of the ground made the lord god
[54:47] to grow every tree that is pleasant to
[54:49] the sight
[54:51] and good for food see
[54:54] then he goes and immediately it says the
[54:56] tree of life
[54:57] also in the midst of the garden and
[55:01] the tree of knowledge of good and evil
[55:04] amen
[55:04] so we see that there in the in the
[55:06] garden there was two trees standing
[55:08] there
[55:08] amen in the midst of it amen so
[55:12] as we said earlier if this tree of life
[55:14] is a person
[55:15] then logically this tree of knowledge of
[55:17] good and evil must be a person as well
[55:20] amen praise god this tree of good and
[55:23] evil if we if we
[55:24] if we know that the tree of life is
[55:26] christ amen
[55:27] let's just bring it down we know that as
[55:29] believers amen we know that that tree of
[55:32] life was christ amen
[55:33] christ was there amen adam and eve had
[55:36] access amen to to christ whenever
[55:39] because the bible says that he was in
[55:41] the midst of the garden in other words
[55:42] they could
[55:43] the bible says that god come down amen
[55:46] would come down
[55:47] and fellowship with them in the in the
[55:49] cool of the evening amen
[55:51] but it wasn't just then it wasn't just
[55:53] then amen it was they had access to him
[55:55] at all times amen praise god it wasn't
[55:58] just in the cool of the evening amen
[55:59] that's why amen you don't have access to
[56:01] god just here when you come to church
[56:04] amen or just on a wednesday amen you
[56:07] have
[56:07] access to him every time maybe no matter
[56:10] where you are amen you can be in the
[56:11] middle of the woods
[56:12] in the woods uh hunting but you have
[56:15] full access to
[56:16] him there amen praise god
[56:19] because he is the same yesterday to them
[56:21] forever and he's omniscient and he's
[56:22] omnipresent amen praise god
[56:25] and so this tree of good and evil is
[56:27] none other than satan himself that's
[56:29] right
[56:31] satan himself was in the garden
[56:34] and if you want scripture to back that
[56:35] up you just read ezekiel chapter 28
[56:37] verse 13. the bible says talking about
[56:39] satan
[56:40] it says thou has been in eden the garden
[56:43] of god
[56:45] every precious stone was thy covering
[56:47] the sardius
[56:48] topaz and the diamond the barrel the
[56:50] onyx and the jasper
[56:52] the sapphire the emerald and the
[56:54] carbuncle and gold
[56:55] the workmanship of thy tabrets and of
[56:57] thy pipes was prepared in thee
[56:59] in the day that thou was created
[57:03] so satan was in there was there in the
[57:05] garden of eden
[57:07] and he is he is beautiful you see as we
[57:10] just read
[57:11] he is not anything ugly he doesn't have
[57:14] horns like the way they portray him in
[57:16] the in the movies or in the cartoons
[57:19] he is a beautiful angel a beautiful
[57:21] being the bible in another place calls
[57:23] him an angel of light
[57:26] i thought god was the source of light
[57:29] he is the source of light the originator
[57:32] of light but he can
[57:32] he can he can imitate himself and turn
[57:35] himself the bible says into an angel of
[57:37] light
[57:38] and he's turned himself to an angel
[57:40] light to many people today amen people
[57:42] thinking that that's god
[57:46] fooling them fooling them and thinking
[57:49] and
[57:49] thinking that they're worshiping god
[57:52] when they're actually doing satan a
[57:53] service
[57:55] doesn't the bible say that man that
[57:58] would come to a point where they're
[57:59] killing you you know persecuting you
[58:03] thinking that they're doing god a
[58:04] service when in reality they're serving
[58:06] god
[58:06] i mean satan and they're serving satan
[58:10] amen satan is not any satan is not going
[58:13] to come at you like a like like a demon
[58:16] uh uh you know like a zombie looking
[58:18] type person
[58:19] he's not going to come at you that way
[58:21] he's going to come at you with something
[58:23] very nice
[58:24] very subtle subtle and
[58:27] and very soft-spoken very very meek
[58:33] very gentle he's not going to come
[58:36] bashing you in the head
[58:37] with anything his no he that's how he
[58:40] comes
[58:41] and that's how problems start in your
[58:42] life when you
[58:44] give access to satan in your life it's
[58:47] little by little
[58:49] that's why that that's why the phrase
[58:51] you give him you give him a finger he
[58:53] takes the whole arm
[58:56] you give you give satan his little
[58:58] finger he takes the whole thing
[59:00] because he's not satisfied with just
[59:01] your pinky little finger
[59:04] he wants he wants all of you but god
[59:06] also wants the same thing
[59:10] and so with with god he only he only can
[59:13] use what you give him
[59:15] you give him your pinky that's all he
[59:17] can use but you give him your whole life
[59:20] amen he uses your whole your whole being
[59:23] amen
[59:24] i don't know why we don't want to just
[59:25] give him our whole being
[59:27] we just give him just a little part of
[59:29] our life amen
[59:30] we give him just a little lord you can
[59:33] come into this door in my life but don't
[59:35] come in here
[59:36] this is first for me this is just i you
[59:38] leave that alone
[59:40] and you know what you're telling god god
[59:43] you have limited access
[59:46] amen when when god himself has given us
[59:50] full access to
[59:51] every blessing amen praise god
[59:54] praise the lord jesus so satan doesn't
[59:57] come at you
[59:59] he comes at you very sly and until he
[1:00:01] gets you to full destruction
[1:00:03] and then you realize what in the world
[1:00:05] have i done
[1:00:06] what in the world where why wh where am
[1:00:09] i at
[1:00:10] praise god now so we see that those two
[1:00:13] trees were there in the garden
[1:00:14] and man was to live by the tree of life
[1:00:18] adam was to live by that tree by that
[1:00:21] tree
[1:00:22] by the tree of life amen they were had
[1:00:24] fellowship with that tree of life on a
[1:00:26] daily basis amen
[1:00:28] praise god the prophet says here in in
[1:00:31] the ephesian churches god's intention
[1:00:32] for his creation
[1:00:33] man is to express his words
[1:00:37] in genesis adam was given the word to
[1:00:39] live by
[1:00:40] amen in other words to give in that tree
[1:00:42] of life to live by
[1:00:44] yes you see a life lived by the word
[1:00:47] would be the word expressed let me say
[1:00:50] that again
[1:00:51] a life lived by the word would be the
[1:00:54] word expressed
[1:00:56] when you live the word of god when you
[1:00:58] put the word of god into action that's
[1:01:00] the word expressed in your life
[1:01:02] amen and who is the word is jesus christ
[1:01:06] that is true is it not but did adam live
[1:01:08] by that word
[1:01:11] no because he was to live by every word
[1:01:15] and he failed to take heed to every
[1:01:19] word amen to every word how important it
[1:01:22] is amen when you leave
[1:01:24] something off when you leave something
[1:01:25] off from the word amen
[1:01:28] you don't have access to the full word
[1:01:30] you see
[1:01:32] just one word off is not full access
[1:01:37] just one word off amen it's limited
[1:01:41] access
[1:01:42] praise god and that's what satan wants
[1:01:44] us to to have his limited acts
[1:01:46] he doesn't care if you come to church he
[1:01:48] doesn't care if you read the bible
[1:01:50] amen it may seem that you have full
[1:01:54] access to the word
[1:01:56] because you have a bible in your house
[1:01:59] and you have a bible on your phone and
[1:02:01] you have a bible on your ipad
[1:02:03] it may seem that you have full access
[1:02:05] but full access
[1:02:06] amen is when you when that with the
[1:02:08] revelation of that word comes into your
[1:02:10] life
[1:02:11] amen that's getting into full access
[1:02:14] then
[1:02:14] praise god amen the church ages amen it
[1:02:17] was
[1:02:18] limited access
[1:02:21] to at the church ages amen but the full
[1:02:24] access through the holy spirit amen was
[1:02:26] right there
[1:02:28] full access to the word to all the
[1:02:30] blessings that god has for you amen
[1:02:32] that's what we are at in this hour
[1:02:35] that's where we are at in this hour amen
[1:02:37] to
[1:02:37] full access to his blessings amen so we
[1:02:40] are to be living by
[1:02:41] every word of god in order to truly be
[1:02:44] the word expressed
[1:02:45] amen and that was the purpose of god
[1:02:48] amen it was to share his eternal life
[1:02:50] with man
[1:02:51] in ephesians chapter one it talks about
[1:02:53] how uh
[1:02:54] in verse four four through eleven i
[1:02:56] don't wanna i'm not gonna
[1:02:57] read it all but just take certain points
[1:02:59] it says there that according as he had
[1:03:01] chosen
[1:03:02] us in him amen that we should be holy
[1:03:05] and without blame before him in love
[1:03:07] he wanted to share that love with us he
[1:03:09] wanted to share that eternal life with
[1:03:11] with adam with eve amen he gave them a
[1:03:14] man eternal life in their
[1:03:16] soul yes right amen
[1:03:19] but they did not have eternal life in
[1:03:21] their body
[1:03:24] amen think of that think about that for
[1:03:27] a moment
[1:03:28] if in there having predestinated us unto
[1:03:31] the adoption of children by jesus christ
[1:03:34] to himself
[1:03:35] amen wherein he hath made us accepted in
[1:03:38] the beloved in whom we have redemption
[1:03:40] through his blood
[1:03:41] the forgiveness of sins look at all
[1:03:44] these
[1:03:45] axes all that we have access to
[1:03:48] he hath abounded toward us having made
[1:03:51] note unto us the mystery of his will
[1:03:54] in other words it's not a mystery
[1:03:55] anymore it's an
[1:03:57] open book amen
[1:04:00] he might that in the dispensation of the
[1:04:02] fullness of times he might gather
[1:04:04] together in
[1:04:05] in one all things in christ both which
[1:04:08] are in heaven
[1:04:09] and which are on earth even in him
[1:04:13] amen all things not just limited things
[1:04:16] all things he might gather unto him in
[1:04:18] whom
[1:04:19] also we have obtained an inheritance
[1:04:22] being predestinated
[1:04:24] amen praise god
[1:04:27] that's how much god wants to give you
[1:04:29] full access
[1:04:30] he's done it all yeah now what are you
[1:04:32] treating no what are you doing
[1:04:35] we have no excuse in this hour i'm
[1:04:38] getting a little warm here
[1:04:41] praise god you love the lord i mean are
[1:04:44] still with me
[1:04:45] amen praise god
[1:04:50] now so i want you to keep that in mind
[1:04:54] that
[1:04:55] adam did not have eternal life in his
[1:04:57] body
[1:04:59] that's the reason why he had to con he
[1:05:02] had to keep eating from the tree of life
[1:05:05] that's the reason why he had to
[1:05:06] continually fellowship
[1:05:08] with the word with jesus christ with god
[1:05:12] the tree of life in order to come to
[1:05:14] that point
[1:05:16] amen he had he had eternal life in his
[1:05:19] soul
[1:05:20] but not in his body amen so
[1:05:24] what happened they got ahead of the word
[1:05:28] and we know the story amen they got
[1:05:29] ahead of the word amen
[1:05:31] and they did amen they disobeyed the
[1:05:33] word that's why they didn't take the
[1:05:35] full word in their life amen
[1:05:36] and that's the reason why amen when you
[1:05:38] get ahead of god amen and no matter what
[1:05:40] it is in your life when you get ahead of
[1:05:42] the plan of god amen
[1:05:43] it leads you to destruction it leads you
[1:05:46] to death
[1:05:47] no matter what it is that's why it's so
[1:05:49] important amen that we
[1:05:50] commit things to the lord lord is it
[1:05:53] your will for me to do this
[1:05:54] yes amen is it for me to be
[1:05:58] your will for me to be in that church is
[1:05:59] it for me your will for me to have this
[1:06:01] job is it your will for me to
[1:06:03] to go this route amen to be with this
[1:06:05] person in my
[1:06:06] in my life is it your will lord because
[1:06:10] most of the time we want to get ahead of
[1:06:11] god
[1:06:15] and eventually getting ahead of god it
[1:06:17] leads us amen to
[1:06:19] to death it leads us to a life not with
[1:06:21] not satisfied
[1:06:23] to a life with no full access to god
[1:06:26] but there's forgiveness and there's
[1:06:29] there's there's grace
[1:06:31] and there's mercy amen but the scar will
[1:06:34] still be there
[1:06:37] how many how many know that that's amen
[1:06:40] i've i've been there the scar will still
[1:06:43] be there
[1:06:44] as a reminder not as a reminder that not
[1:06:47] not as a reminder
[1:06:48] necessarily of what happened but as a
[1:06:50] reminder of the grace and the mercy of
[1:06:52] god in your life
[1:06:54] amen amen praise god amen
[1:06:58] so and so adam and eve they reasoned
[1:07:02] with the word of god
[1:07:03] when the serpent came to eve and said
[1:07:06] you shall not surely die
[1:07:08] amen just one word off you see see
[1:07:11] just one word off and it was god it was
[1:07:13] satan giving eve thinking
[1:07:15] making eve think that she had full
[1:07:17] access when in reality it was limited
[1:07:19] access
[1:07:20] right amen and so when they
[1:07:24] the when they reasoned with the word of
[1:07:26] god amen i'm just trying to move along i
[1:07:28] can't believe time's going so fast
[1:07:30] when they were when they reasoned with
[1:07:31] the word of god amen it led them to
[1:07:33] death
[1:07:34] the bible says that that day amen they
[1:07:36] shall surely die
[1:07:38] when they sinned that same now they
[1:07:40] didn't die the same day
[1:07:42] no they didn't they didn't fall over
[1:07:44] dead you know
[1:07:46] when they partook amen of the sin
[1:07:49] of the unbelief no they they eventually
[1:07:51] their bodies started to die
[1:07:54] they started to get old when in reality
[1:07:57] they should they were not supposed to
[1:07:58] get to that point
[1:08:00] because if they would have continued
[1:08:01] eating from the tree of life
[1:08:04] their bodies would have been
[1:08:05] rejuvenating their bodies would have
[1:08:07] been
[1:08:08] amen and it's the same thing with you
[1:08:09] and i saints in this hour amen
[1:08:11] as we are partaking of the tree of life
[1:08:14] jesus christ the word
[1:08:16] amen that's amen that holy spirit is
[1:08:18] rejuvenating us amen
[1:08:20] from the inside out amen amen
[1:08:23] you may feel old on the outside but the
[1:08:26] spirit man inside is young
[1:08:29] amen sometimes they might feel so young
[1:08:32] like that man that brother brandon was
[1:08:33] talking about there that preached that
[1:08:35] 90 year old man that preached that
[1:08:36] sermon talking about the the
[1:08:38] the rainbow and how he preached there in
[1:08:40] job and where were you when i laid the
[1:08:42] foundation of the world and he got so
[1:08:43] excited 90 something years old and he
[1:08:45] just
[1:08:46] jumped up you know nobody i had there's
[1:08:49] no room enough here to
[1:08:50] for me to preach amen if the word of god
[1:08:53] can do that for a 94 year old man amen
[1:08:55] how much more
[1:08:56] man can it do for me how much more can
[1:08:58] it do for you michael how much more can
[1:09:00] he do for you zach praise god
[1:09:02] amen i want that same i want that same
[1:09:04] life i want that same spirit
[1:09:06] to rejuvenate me from the inside out
[1:09:08] amen
[1:09:10] the problem is is that we get tired and
[1:09:12] we get sleepy and we get bored with the
[1:09:14] things that god has for us
[1:09:18] we get so we have so much full access to
[1:09:20] the word nowadays
[1:09:22] that we get bored of it oh my
[1:09:27] we get bored i've heard that i've heard
[1:09:30] that
[1:09:31] ever since i was little i grew up in the
[1:09:33] message
[1:09:34] and you get bored of it and you don't
[1:09:36] realize the treasure that you have
[1:09:37] before you
[1:09:39] when you really realize what the
[1:09:40] treasures that you have before you
[1:09:42] amen you're not going to start
[1:09:44] experiencing exactly what the joy of the
[1:09:46] lord is in your life
[1:09:48] listen david had joy he said lord
[1:09:50] restore to me the joy of thy salvation
[1:09:53] that was with limited access
[1:09:57] that was with limit he didn't have the
[1:09:59] revelation of the seven seals
[1:10:01] he didn't have the revelation he didn't
[1:10:02] have the holy spirit in his life
[1:10:05] yeah he was talking about lord give
[1:10:07] restore to me the joy of my salvation
[1:10:10] and he was excited when the ark of god
[1:10:12] was coming down
[1:10:13] down the road amen and he got so excited
[1:10:16] he started dancing and
[1:10:17] amen until his clothes fell off the
[1:10:19] bible says that's right
[1:10:23] what should what what would the word of
[1:10:25] god what should the word of god do to us
[1:10:27] in this hour
[1:10:29] amen now i i don't want you to dance
[1:10:32] until your clothes fall off
[1:10:35] don't do that
[1:10:40] but i'll tell you what i've heard
[1:10:41] stories of people and i think brother
[1:10:44] branham talks about people got it
[1:10:45] getting excited in the spirit
[1:10:47] and they get so excited in the spirit
[1:10:49] and they and they'll and they'll be like
[1:10:50] a stove
[1:10:51] up a stove one of those hot stoves thing
[1:10:54] like you sister monica have in your in
[1:10:56] your house
[1:10:56] and they and they and they were holding
[1:10:59] the stove that hot pipe amen and they
[1:11:01] didn't even get burned
[1:11:03] so so into in the spirit that they got
[1:11:05] to that
[1:11:06] it didn't even get burned i've seen
[1:11:08] people getting in the spirit amen and
[1:11:10] the holy spirit amen just taking care of
[1:11:12] the sisters as maybe they fall on the
[1:11:14] floor amen or something like that
[1:11:16] just watching over their clothes nobody
[1:11:18] there making sure they're closing no the
[1:11:20] holy spirit just kind of takes care of
[1:11:21] that amen
[1:11:22] you see god could take care of amen the
[1:11:24] problem is we don't get in the spirit
[1:11:25] enough
[1:11:27] amen we like we like routines
[1:11:30] we like routines it's out of the routine
[1:11:34] we don't know but see the routine can
[1:11:36] lead you to death
[1:11:39] now when sometimes gets excited oh i
[1:11:41] don't know about that
[1:11:44] do you realize that's the spirit of a
[1:11:45] baptist church
[1:11:48] when you act that way spirit of a
[1:11:51] nominal church amen but let the holy
[1:11:52] spirit have free reign amen
[1:11:55] in your life if somebody gets excited
[1:11:56] about the word amen
[1:11:58] about the word of god in their life they
[1:12:00] must have heard the word first and god
[1:12:02] have the word in their life first before
[1:12:03] they can act that way
[1:12:06] amen i've i've been there done that
[1:12:09] amen i've i've been that way amen praise
[1:12:12] god
[1:12:13] now i don't know how i got into that but
[1:12:16] as brother wade said wednesday that
[1:12:18] didn't cost you anything
[1:12:19] praise god
[1:12:22] amen so sometimes we get ahead of the
[1:12:25] word amen
[1:12:26] ecclesiastes 3 1 tells us to everything
[1:12:29] there is
[1:12:30] a season and a time to every purpose
[1:12:32] under the heaven
[1:12:34] everything has a time has a purpose amen
[1:12:36] so back to this tree of life the first
[1:12:38] adam he never
[1:12:40] obtained the eternal life for his body
[1:12:42] never
[1:12:43] due to his unbelief to the word and he
[1:12:46] lost access to the tree of life
[1:12:48] yes amen and so we see what happened
[1:12:51] there in genesis chapter 3 verse 22
[1:12:54] through 24 it reads and the lord god
[1:12:56] said behold
[1:12:57] this is after adam and eve disbelieved
[1:13:00] the word
[1:13:01] sinned and the lord god said behold a
[1:13:03] man has become as one of us
[1:13:06] to know good and evil and now lest he
[1:13:09] put forth his hand
[1:13:11] and take also of the tree of life and
[1:13:13] eat and live forever
[1:13:15] in other words god did not want them to
[1:13:17] eat from the tree of life to have access
[1:13:19] to the tree of life
[1:13:20] and they're in that condition sinful
[1:13:22] condition that they were in
[1:13:24] they had sin they disbelieved the word
[1:13:26] that's the reason why you and i saints
[1:13:28] we can't live we can't have full access
[1:13:30] to the tree of life and your life living
[1:13:32] in sin
[1:13:35] you say that you're a christian you say
[1:13:37] that you're born again and you're doing
[1:13:38] the things of the devil
[1:13:40] on the side you don't have access to the
[1:13:42] tree of life
[1:13:44] you don't have access to the full word
[1:13:45] of god you might come in here and play
[1:13:47] the part
[1:13:49] god bless you
[1:13:52] hey man but you don't have full access
[1:13:55] to the tree of life when in your heart
[1:13:56] you really want to do the things in the
[1:13:58] of the world you don't have full access
[1:14:01] don't tell me that you're a full blood
[1:14:03] you're you're a full christian
[1:14:04] amen you're you're there you're partly
[1:14:07] there
[1:14:08] amen but you can't have one foot in the
[1:14:10] in the world and one foot in the world
[1:14:11] in the in church
[1:14:13] it doesn't work that way amen
[1:14:16] maybe you came here to hear something
[1:14:18] else today
[1:14:20] hopefully this is helping somebody now
[1:14:22] therefore
[1:14:23] the lord god sent him forth from the
[1:14:25] garden of eden to till the ground from
[1:14:27] once he was taken
[1:14:28] verse 24 genesis chapter 3 so he drove
[1:14:31] out the man
[1:14:32] and he placed at the east of the garden
[1:14:35] of eden
[1:14:36] cherubims and the flaming sword which
[1:14:38] turned
[1:14:39] every way to keep the way of the tree of
[1:14:42] life
[1:14:44] so god was the one who placed cherubims
[1:14:46] there
[1:14:47] to the tree of life what does that mean
[1:14:49] in other words when adam and eve sinned
[1:14:52] god did not want them to have full
[1:14:54] access to the to to him
[1:14:56] anymore in that condition they had they
[1:14:59] had to have
[1:15:00] a man a a a a a redemption work done in
[1:15:04] their lives that's why god killed a lamp
[1:15:07] and and and and clothed them with skins
[1:15:09] of that lamb amen
[1:15:11] representing jesus christ well what he
[1:15:13] was going to do later on amen
[1:15:15] but then uh they but they lost
[1:15:18] access to that tree of life in its
[1:15:20] fullness amen
[1:15:22] and that's why they started getting old
[1:15:24] eventually they died
[1:15:26] they lived 960 something years adam did
[1:15:30] i think is how much he lived can you
[1:15:32] imagine living that long
[1:15:36] my it's probably it was better than than
[1:15:39] it was now
[1:15:40] than it is now i mean you get you
[1:15:43] getting out to 50 60 years old i'm sure
[1:15:45] right
[1:15:46] and you're probably like man imagine
[1:15:49] living 500 600 700
[1:15:51] 900 and something years that's a long
[1:15:54] time
[1:15:56] but eventually adam died when from the
[1:15:59] from the beginning it was not so they
[1:16:02] were not
[1:16:03] they were not to die if they stayed
[1:16:06] eating from the tree of life
[1:16:08] amen praise god
[1:16:12] amen so there was no way for them to
[1:16:15] have access to that tree of life amen
[1:16:18] in the in the old testament when god
[1:16:20] when god made the
[1:16:21] the tabernacle and and we have here
[1:16:23] we're not going to use this so
[1:16:25] just this is an example yeah they had
[1:16:28] access to the
[1:16:29] tabernacle of moses amen thee and inside
[1:16:32] was the ark of the covenant
[1:16:34] all right the tabernacle of moses amen
[1:16:36] had three layers to it
[1:16:38] amen the outer court the ho the the holy
[1:16:41] place and then the holy of holies
[1:16:44] in the holy of holies was this right
[1:16:46] here
[1:16:48] the tabernacle of god amen the the the
[1:16:52] the the ark the ark of the covenant
[1:16:55] amen and in that ark in
[1:16:59] in that tabernacle only one person could
[1:17:02] go in there
[1:17:03] only one person had access to it and
[1:17:06] they had to have the right password
[1:17:10] they had to have the right password to
[1:17:12] get in there they could not get in there
[1:17:13] with with with half of the password or
[1:17:15] the wrong password they had to have
[1:17:17] everything in order they had to be
[1:17:18] dressed a certain way they had to even
[1:17:20] smell a certain way
[1:17:22] that's how much god amen
[1:17:25] what god wanted them to be in there amen
[1:17:27] but they had to do it the way he said to
[1:17:29] him
[1:17:31] it's not the way you want it amen it's
[1:17:34] not the way you want to approach god no
[1:17:36] there but the bible says he is the only
[1:17:38] way
[1:17:39] he is the only truth he is the only life
[1:17:42] amen so when they got in there him and
[1:17:45] the priest the high priest would go in
[1:17:47] there with blood
[1:17:49] from an animal that was sacrificed and
[1:17:51] he would go in there
[1:17:52] and when he would go in there inside
[1:17:54] that holy of holies that that there was
[1:17:56] a there was a veil
[1:17:58] between the holy of holies and the holy
[1:18:00] place
[1:18:01] and in the ho and when he would go past
[1:18:03] that veil amen
[1:18:06] he had access because he had he had he
[1:18:08] had fulfilled everything that he was
[1:18:09] supposed to do
[1:18:10] and he would go in there and sprinkle
[1:18:12] the blood upon the upon the
[1:18:14] ark amen representing amen that
[1:18:18] here's lord hears blood to represent for
[1:18:21] the sins of the people
[1:18:23] and that was enough to cover them for a
[1:18:26] whole year
[1:18:28] and to represent for the for his his own
[1:18:30] sins as well
[1:18:32] now in that holy of holies saints amen
[1:18:34] was
[1:18:35] was so much the the the presence of god
[1:18:38] was so much in there
[1:18:40] amen there was there was the the the
[1:18:42] tablets
[1:18:43] of of of of moses the the word of god
[1:18:46] was in there the ten commandments was in
[1:18:48] there
[1:18:48] the the the aaron's rod
[1:18:52] amen who in that aaron's rod
[1:18:55] just think about the saints aaron's rod
[1:18:58] that was supposed to be a dry stick
[1:19:01] inside that presence was blooming amen
[1:19:06] inside that holy place inside that holy
[1:19:08] of holies was blooming and that and that
[1:19:10] branch that rod was not even attached to
[1:19:12] a tree
[1:19:14] think about that saints it was not even
[1:19:16] attached to a tree yet it was blooming
[1:19:20] but if you think about it it was
[1:19:21] attached to the tree
[1:19:24] because the tree of life was in there
[1:19:26] jesus christ his presence was in there
[1:19:29] and so aaron could go back in there the
[1:19:31] high priest could go back in there and
[1:19:32] see that
[1:19:33] not only that go back in there and
[1:19:35] partake of the manna
[1:19:36] the original manna that god had given
[1:19:39] them at the beginning when he started
[1:19:41] sending manna to them
[1:19:42] he could partake of that original manna
[1:19:44] in there
[1:19:45] and take some of that manna and eat to
[1:19:48] remind him lord this
[1:19:50] is the foundation for where we are right
[1:19:52] now
[1:19:53] amen and you and i have access to all
[1:19:56] these things
[1:19:57] to the original manna amen to the
[1:19:59] original word
[1:20:01] to the to the to the whole holiest of
[1:20:03] holies now
[1:20:06] aaron or the high priest was the only
[1:20:07] one that had access to that
[1:20:09] but when jesus christ came on the scene
[1:20:11] the high priest of our confession
[1:20:13] amen the the high priest amen the the
[1:20:16] the one that's why he died and he took
[1:20:18] and he shed his own blood
[1:20:20] his own life amen and when he did amen
[1:20:24] and that earthquake took place the veil
[1:20:26] was rent from top to bottom
[1:20:28] that veil was ramped from top to bottom
[1:20:30] so now
[1:20:31] nobody had an excuse to not go back in
[1:20:34] there
[1:20:35] now it's death if you don't go back in
[1:20:37] there
[1:20:38] it was death if you went in there
[1:20:40] because only aaron could go in there but
[1:20:42] now it's death if you don't go back in
[1:20:44] there
[1:20:44] so now you have full access to this tree
[1:20:48] of life
[1:20:49] in this hour praise god aren't you happy
[1:20:52] for that
[1:20:53] amen you have full access
[1:20:57] to the tree of life in this hour and now
[1:21:00] amen you don't have to
[1:21:01] it's not just about seeing an aaron's
[1:21:03] rod or it's not just about seeing
[1:21:06] and taking some man amen but now you can
[1:21:08] have the revelation of the seven seals
[1:21:10] now you can see amen those two spirits
[1:21:12] amen working in in
[1:21:14] tanzania now you can see amen what the
[1:21:16] church ages are about
[1:21:18] now you can see all these things why
[1:21:20] because there's full access to
[1:21:22] to that to that place amen
[1:21:26] praise god so
[1:21:29] that's why that second adam that's why
[1:21:31] jesus christ is called the second adam
[1:21:34] because it was the second adam jesus
[1:21:36] christ the word he came himself to do
[1:21:38] what adam failed to do
[1:21:41] adam failed to to to believe all the
[1:21:44] word of god but jesus christ came on the
[1:21:46] scene
[1:21:47] amen to to believe and to
[1:21:50] obey the full word of god because he is
[1:21:52] the word
[1:21:53] and i know a lot of you that you already
[1:21:55] know this amen amen but some of you amen
[1:21:57] this might help you amen
[1:22:00] praise god so jesus he defeated the
[1:22:03] enemy by the word
[1:22:05] amen he died and resurrected in order to
[1:22:08] obtain
[1:22:08] eternal life for his own body
[1:22:12] you see and for our souls and our bodies
[1:22:15] as well
[1:22:16] amen and he was the only one that could
[1:22:19] do it
[1:22:20] he was the only one that could give you
[1:22:21] the the full pat the full
[1:22:23] the password to have full access to it
[1:22:25] amen
[1:22:26] when he raised from the dead amen that's
[1:22:28] when he came up and he says access
[1:22:30] granted
[1:22:33] full acts is granted amen
[1:22:36] he said it about himself he says all
[1:22:38] heaven and earth amen

[1:23:41] that so today
[1:23:42] we have the promise of not just
[1:23:44] receiving eternal life
[1:23:46] in our soul but also eternal life in our
[1:23:49] bodies
[1:23:51] think about this saints jesus christ
[1:23:54] raised from the dead in order to obtain
[1:23:56] eternal life for his body because as
[1:23:59] jesus christ was living here on earth
[1:24:01] and walking here on earth he didn't have
[1:24:02] eternal life on his body
[1:24:05] he had he was he was god yes full he had
[1:24:08] he had full access
[1:24:09] the fullness of the god had bodily
[1:24:11] dwelled in him but he didn't have ac
[1:24:13] eternal life on his body man it wasn't
[1:24:15] until he raised from the dead in that
[1:24:17] glorified form
[1:24:19] but now saints we have the promise today
[1:24:21] that we don't even have to die
[1:24:24] amen we don't even have to die amen and
[1:24:27] we have access to that full resurrection
[1:24:30] amen in our lives from the inside out in
[1:24:32] other words a full body change
[1:24:34] i know i keep talking about the body
[1:24:36] changing this hour because it's becoming
[1:24:37] a greater thing for me than it ever has
[1:24:39] before
[1:24:40] amen and it should be to you too as well
[1:24:43] because that's the thing that we're
[1:24:44] facing right now
[1:24:46] the resurrection i'm not looking forward
[1:24:49] to joe biden getting in the presidency
[1:24:51] or
[1:24:51] donald trump winning the election that's
[1:24:53] not what i'm looking i'm looking for a
[1:24:55] resurrection amen
[1:24:56] to see those dead saints raised from the
[1:24:58] dead and we know that we only have about
[1:25:00] 30 40 days left after that
[1:25:02] that's right yes sir amen yes sure it's
[1:25:05] okay you keep up with the news and all
[1:25:07] that good stuff that's fine but that's
[1:25:08] limited that's limited access
[1:25:11] actually that's no access at all that's
[1:25:14] not going to get you to glory
[1:25:16] what gets me the glory is this word amen
[1:25:19] this word is the only thing that can
[1:25:20] transform my body
[1:25:22] and if it was enough to transform my
[1:25:24] soul a man they can transform this body
[1:25:26] amen praise god so that that way of the
[1:25:30] tree of life has been restored in this
[1:25:32] hour saints it's been restored and now
[1:25:35] amen we're looking forward to great
[1:25:37] things to happen in our midst
[1:25:40] to happen in our lives to see great
[1:25:42] things amen
[1:25:43] we have so much of the word that's still
[1:25:45] not been fulfilled
[1:25:49] it's mostly in revelation and you know
[1:25:52] in isaiah in different places there's
[1:25:54] still word to be fulfilled
[1:25:56] but only the bride are going to be able
[1:25:57] to see that word fulfilled
[1:26:00] amen praise god the prophet says but
[1:26:04] there are no cherubims with flaming
[1:26:06] swords to guard the tree of life now
[1:26:09] you see when that cherubim was placed
[1:26:11] there to guard the tree of life when
[1:26:12] adam and eve sinned and were kicked out
[1:26:14] of the garden
[1:26:15] those cherubims aren't there anymore you
[1:26:17] have full access to that to that tree of
[1:26:20] life now
[1:26:21] and if you don't want to eat the fruit
[1:26:22] from that tree amen it's your fault
[1:26:25] it's not god's fault amen it's your own
[1:26:29] fault

[1:27:08] as he did because he raised from the
[1:27:10] dead amen he triumphed from the death
[1:27:12] hell and the grave and if that same
[1:27:13] spirit dwells in you

[1:27:44] whatever it is
[1:27:47] you have full access to overcome praise
[1:27:51] god
[1:27:52] amen romans 8 11 says but if the spirit
[1:27:55] of him that raised up jesus from the
[1:27:57] dead dwell in you
[1:27:59] he that raised up christ from the dead
[1:28:01] shall also quicken your mortal bodies
[1:28:03] by his spirit that dwelleth in you amen

[1:28:10] we have access to fully overcome
[1:28:12] whatever it is in our life you know in
[1:28:14] in our in in the day and hour that we
[1:28:16] live in we give trophies to everybody
[1:28:18] who just
[1:28:19] participates
[1:28:23] i like what it was somebody uh there's
[1:28:26] actually a cartoon character in the
[1:28:27] movie said we celebrate mediocrity
[1:28:32] when god is he has no second place
[1:28:35] winners or third place winners or
[1:28:37] fourth place winners we do we give a
[1:28:39] trophy because you
[1:28:41] participated we don't want to leave
[1:28:43] anybody behind
[1:28:45] that's just being mediocre amen god
[1:28:49] doesn't want mediocre people
[1:28:51] god wants somebody amen who is a no true
[1:28:54] overcomer
[1:28:56] amen and if there's something if you
[1:28:58] want to be an overcomer that means
[1:29:00] there has to be something for you to
[1:29:02] overcome
[1:29:04] amen that's the reason why people acting
[1:29:06] the way they acted they acting
[1:29:08] today out in the streets rioting and all
[1:29:09] this stuff they're acting like they
[1:29:11] they deserve things it's the spirit and
[1:29:14] the age that we're living in
[1:29:16] you may not like to hear this but that's
[1:29:17] exactly the spirit that these people
[1:29:19] have out here
[1:29:20] like they do we we deserve we
[1:29:26] we deserve this and when they didn't
[1:29:28] even work for it
[1:29:30] and they get upset at the man who who
[1:29:32] has worked hard for it
[1:29:34] and has got to that place and they're
[1:29:36] trying to go in there
[1:29:37] wanting the same thing kicking windows
[1:29:39] out and burning buildings
[1:29:42] that's right you think they deserve that
[1:29:44] when the man that has worked hard for it
[1:29:47] and has labored and studied and done
[1:29:49] what he was supposed to do
[1:29:51] to obtain the same thing amen that's to
[1:29:53] me that's communism
[1:29:55] okay i don't know what i'm gonna get
[1:29:56] into that amen
[1:29:59] that's exactly the spirit of communism
[1:30:01] that everybody gets equal
[1:30:03] equal share in everything it doesn't
[1:30:05] matter if this person worked hard for it
[1:30:07] or if this person is just a lazy bum
[1:30:11] everybody gets equal share that's
[1:30:12] exactly where this country's heading
[1:30:14] right now
[1:30:14] as a matter of fact it's there right now
[1:30:17] full set communism
[1:30:19] god is not interested in that god is
[1:30:21] interested in overcomers
[1:30:23] amen not mediocrity overcomers
[1:30:27] and if there's if you want to be an
[1:30:29] overcomer there's something for you to
[1:30:31] overcome
[1:30:32] there's something for you to do praise
[1:30:34] god
[1:30:35] amen so that process amen should be
[1:30:38] taking place now
[1:30:39] in your life amen that process of of you
[1:30:43] overcoming should be taking place now in
[1:30:45] your life as you're eating the word
[1:30:49] amen as you're feeding on the word in
[1:30:51] other words as you're coming to church
[1:30:54] with sincerity in your heart and say
[1:30:56] lord i want that word to change me from
[1:30:58] the inside out
[1:30:59] amen then that word can change you from
[1:31:02] the inside out
[1:31:04] praise god but if it's just another
[1:31:06] church service for you then that word
[1:31:08] won't do anything
[1:31:09] for you i i challenge you saints to take
[1:31:12] the things that are preached
[1:31:14] from behind the pulpit any pulpit and go
[1:31:17] read them and study them on your own
[1:31:20] amen
[1:31:21] don't just don't just take you know
[1:31:25] our word for it amen read and study on
[1:31:27] your own
[1:31:29] get into the word yourself because i i
[1:31:31] promise you you will get more of god
[1:31:33] that way
[1:31:35] do you pray there's many times that i've
[1:31:38] prayed
[1:31:39] and i've even gotten a revelation from
[1:31:41] god as i'm praying
[1:31:45] and i didn't i wasn't in a church
[1:31:46] service i wasn't reading the bible at
[1:31:49] the moment i was just praying i was just
[1:31:51] talking to god and god all of a sudden
[1:31:54] put something in there because that's
[1:31:56] why the bible says that the lord knows
[1:31:59] exactly the spirit knows exactly what we
[1:32:01] need to pray amen and sometimes he
[1:32:02] intercedes for us
[1:32:04] amen praise god amen and i want to
[1:32:08] finish with this in revelations chapter
[1:32:09] 10

[1:32:35] fullness all pages are not sticking
[1:32:38] there's no pages that's sticking amen
[1:32:41] it's
[1:32:41] it's it's it's it's full access to the
[1:32:43] word
[1:32:44] and the bible says there in revelation
[1:32:46] chapter 10 that that
[1:32:48] the mighty angel which is jesus christ
[1:32:51] came down with an
[1:32:52] open book and gave it to john
[1:32:56] and told him amen to eat it to eat
[1:33:00] not just a portion of it not just the
[1:33:03] parts that he likes
[1:33:04] kind of like some like little kids when
[1:33:06] you give them food and they don't like a
[1:33:08] certain
[1:33:09] they don't like the onions they leave
[1:33:10] the onions aside
[1:33:13] yeah my daughters they man they would
[1:33:15] leave they would have a little pile of
[1:33:17] onions right there on the side

[1:33:21] eat the rest
[1:33:22] or they don't like the tomatoes they
[1:33:24] leave the little pile of tomatoes on the
[1:33:26] side amen
[1:33:26] but you see god
[1:33:30] this there's so many ingredients in the
[1:33:32] word and when you just take it all
[1:33:33] in then you really can taste what what
[1:33:37] you really can you really can know what
[1:33:38] you're eating
[1:33:40] amen but when you just say uh lord i
[1:33:42] don't like that the word says
[1:33:44] uh that i'm supposed to congregate you
[1:33:46] know go to church
[1:33:48] whenever the doors are open i don't like
