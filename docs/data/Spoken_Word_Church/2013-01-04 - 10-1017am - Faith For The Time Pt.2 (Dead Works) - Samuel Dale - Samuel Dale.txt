for a little while and be able to rest and Lord be able to listen to you because that's what we depend on we believe your word is true and we ask you that you would just bless us now and guide us and keep us in understanding forgive our sins most of all cleanse us from all unrighteousness and Lord Lord just let your light shine in each one of our hearts and our lives bless the sick among us cuz you said you promised it you gave that you You' send your word and heal us and Deliver Us from destruction remember those that are not here not able to come like brother da brother George brother Tom Lord and the ones there that's that's sick that's not able to be here just remember them and touch them in all to take care of them have your way now as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts in Jesus name amen Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 9 verse one Hebrews 6 therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on unto Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward god of the doctrine of baptisms and of laying on the hands and of resurrection of the dead and of Eternal judgment and let's go down to the next and verse three and this will we do if God permit now if he permits it we'll do it all right we'll get back to that in a little while now Hebrews 9:1 Christ being come and high priest of good things to come by a greater and more perfect Tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and of calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy Place having obtained Eternal Redemption for us for if the blood of bulls and of goats and the ashes of an hepher sprinkling the unclean Sanctified to the purifying of the flesh cuz see that's all it could do that's right it couldn't I got a message on that sometime to get to it it couldn't get into the soul and and do so it could only do into the purifying of the Flesh and the covering of sin so he says verse 14 how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead Works to serve the Living God you may be seated the Lord had his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've been taking some thoughts and you know know trying to cover it a little bit and help us to to see and had a chance this week to be able to go back cuz I really haven't viewed any of them of the the videos that's been made and so we got a chance to go in video a few of them and I tried to cover the last three messages and I saw in that that maybe I need to try to explain myself more of what I'm saying as to what I believe the word is saying uh to you so you know uh bear with me this will be this morning and this afternoon it'll be a couple of messages or more or less to to make sure you understand cuz I don't want you to misunderstand me and go off and and other people to hear me say something and and you know go off and say the wrong thing about it uh when that would not be what I'm talking about now we we I said we've tried to cover and Paul here in Hebrews 6 he says leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ he said let us go on to Perfection now this is the only age that we could understand Hebrews 61 and Hebrews 9:14 to be able to understand it right all right so now by with us in a minute we'll get to what I'm talking about but Paul said the you know leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ now we covered you know we don't you don't leave the principles like destroy it doing whatever the principles are your beginnings and and Foundation all right so now there's nothing don't if you through out the message today if you think I'm trying to say this way just remember remember one thing you don't do a away with anything that God gives you all right and he gives it to us right and perfect for the time it may not be what we think or whatever but it's perfect and right for the time and that's what we're talking about the title is Faith for the time for that time you know that the prophet of God said the little woman there that touched the him of His Garment she had faith for that time that's right all right now I won't try to go back through all the other and I listen very carefully to what I was saying about Abraham and all of those people there and and I'm pretty satisfied with that to try to go on that the those people were not born again Believers right now because Jesus hadn't died right see if he hadn't died and you read there in Hebrews 9 especially that he is the uh mediator of the New Testament well it was necessary for the new before the New Testament could start you had to have the death of the testator right all right that's that's simple and and doing you know we should understand it but we'll get you know our point of what I'm trying to say you don't leave the the principles of the understanding of one God of the understanding of water baptism of the understanding of the resurrection of the Dead uh you know our Eternal judgments that's where a lot of people say well you know that's not necessary anymore we've got deaths you know well uh remember what I brought out the last service I was preaching that remember you try to do stuff like that you're hanging your soul on a sky hook right and there is no such thing as a sky hook cuz there's nowhere in the sky to hook it too all right so you know don't do that let's stay with the the word all right now two I want you to make sure and understand this point that when you're talking about one God water baptism resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment remember the Apostle Paul was the one that was saying this that we then we must go into Perfection so you're looking at a man that had a true revelation of these things not maybe your idea my idea or concept about what would be one God water baptism Resurrection or Eternal judgment but it would be Paul which was preaching the faith of the fathers right all right so now now surely we're not going to try to leave the faith of the fathers that would not be what brother randam would be talking about nor would it be what the Apostle Paul was talking about he was trying to lay that Foundation into the church to where the church would have that foundation so don't try to leave it and go on like the people of the message today see and take like the the one God and they go into the two Lords and and you know Jesus wasn't god Till The River Jordan and all that I don't believe that's a true revelation of the principle right I don't believe that will tie together with the Bible you know I'm just honest I'm not against anybody that's their business what you believe is your business what I preach is mine I have to say what I believe and then try to believe for God to help us all so the true Revelation are the principles Paul is saying for us to leave is the true revelation that he was bringing right now what was he meaning see what was he trying to get us to see what is the point see see we've got to have the faith of the fathers before we can even talk about going on to Perfection right but when you have the new birth say it Faith you know at the faith at the bottom of the pyramid then we have a long ways to go to go on to Perfection to bring to the place that the disciples were right right all right see then the disciples brother random was covering see that what did they have the face of the father now he couldn't come and add something different right he couldn't come and and bring us a different message everything he brought was related right back to what those Apostles had already taught right so because if not he'd have been hanging it in a Skyhook right you know he'd have been putting it somewhere that it had no foundation and it would be like the uh the doctrines of man that's come out of teaching the one God and the the resurrections and things and they' turned it out to be uh damnable heresies as the Bible would call it and and being things that would would not be of any value but now I I tried to cover on that too and I wanted to make sure you got me right I saw it and you know these are like I said a few things I want to make sure you understand uh when we was talking about the principles I was talking about you know that uh people today basically a lot of preachers in this message and that's their business now we're not there we're here all but they preach hair and clothes and dress and stuff like that right all right I believe in that all right I believe that men order to dress like men order to dress dress in order to cut their hair like they're supposed to cut it and women order to wear the kind of clothes they're supposed to wear and and be dressed you know modest as the Bible says and and not modern modest and and all right then you know putting that then the men ought to you know cut their hair and be right because the scripture said it the women ought not cut their hair at all trimming it burning it whatever you do it wouldn't be correct to do any of it see you know in any form I believe in that right but I don't believe I believe you can do every bit of that and not be a Christian all right you could do everything and not be a Christian that's not a Christian because you do that that doesn't make you a Christian because that you you do it and even like you know I con a phrase many years ago that people want to preach and they preach really is your wife They Don't Preach is your life worthy of the Gospel they they preach as your wife worthy of the Gospel you know and if we can get our wives lined up we'd all be ready to go well I I don't I don't agree with that but cuz I think the men was one that messed it up but you know you say well the woman started it yeah but the men took it up all right but now listen I believe in all of that and I believe anyone that's not doing those things you know in the correct way the higher the close address the thing if you're not doing it in the correct way then I doubt the Christian experience now I'm you know I'm sorry you know brother de you're saying I'm not saved because of the clothes I wear well you tell me the clothes you were is is Godly right could you turn around and face Jesus Christ men women whatever you know all right so I I I I know I'm blunt but that's why I don't preach on clothes and hair and dresses because that's not even the principles right that's what I was trying to get out in that like in that message there see that's not the principles the principles is a doctrinal thing which is one God water baptisms a resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment see you shouldn't even it shouldn't even be considered whatsoever about dressing right you know that that shouldn't be considered you mean you you you've got to you know if you left this church today and went to one where they were any dresses you know women you say well I just work with them cuz we're in the crowd you know now there's something wrong with you I mean you know men women come on right right that's not the principles no that's right now but we we you know we I try to do the best I can to preach the way that I I do and and and everything I I try to get you born again if you get born again it'll take care of the high the dresses the clothes if not then you're not born again that's as honest as I can be right you know what else can I say well you don't understand my case get born again that's right I mean I I thought we believe the life that was in US was supposed to come out well if the life within me is a lired hippie and you know slued off days like we do and my wife got on to me the other day she said get your belt on because I didn't have a belt on and my pants was dragging get your belt on you I wouldn't out I was just a house okay but see those things are to be natural okay see there's no salvation in that you say well it's proof of Salvation it can be right it can be but you can do every B of that and still be lost right see there's some things you know that you you try to preach and and when you do you always leave people with a question you know what does brother Dale believe about this all right see here's what I wrote down see if that's all that we need to preach hire dress clothes and things and I said it now that needs to be preached to young people that are coming in right but like I said too you don't have to preach it a lot of time if you sisters live it you Brothers we live it you know they're going to see what it is and they're going to go that away if they don't then they don't have what you have that's just simple that's but see if that's all we need to do then why did Paul say now that's not principles right you understand me right that's not what Paul said Paul said the principles was one God water baptisms or because he said baptism is plural the water baptism Holy Ghost baptism right you know and resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment now Paul said that was principles okay so then these other things are not principles they should be a part of our Christian Life right okay now that should put it cuz like I wrote it this way see if that's all we need to preach then why did Paul say to leave the principles and go into Perfection right that's right yep yeah but I want to ask as us to to make sure that we understand why did Paul say leaving the principles now Paul what are you talking about you call the principles go back to to chapter 6 now and let's look at what he said therefore leaving the principles now verse two is the principles right right the principles is what verse two doctrine of baptisms UNL on hands resurrection of the dead and Faith toward God and things all right what is it now therefore leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection now watching not laying again the foundation of repentance listen from dead works now what is your thought of dead works okay turn over to nth chapter while we at it and he's laying down the thought of what he's saying in verse 14 look what he says again how much more shall the blood of Christ who through the eternal spirit offered himself without spot to God Purge your conscience from dead works that's right to serve the Living God right now Paul says two times dead works now what is your thought of dead Works see we could bring up a definition we could sum up a uh point of what Paul is saying and we can make it fit whatever we want right right see we can make it fit as I said and try to say that the higher the dress the cloth Etc right that we need to go on in the word and we could make that dead works right we can make uh and we'll read some in a minute we can make dead works as being false Doctrine sure we need to know that we need to go on and and not have false Doctrine right and and some dead works now the best definition I could come out of what brother randam is saying in my own understanding and you know because I just try to preach what I see right we look at Dead works as being something that we can do in any way to try to make us better right you know something that's away and we try to do something different you understand yes it may have been said wrong you know for your understanding but it's what I'm talking about see we look at Dead works as as something that we say now okay now brother day we know that we don't we don't uh have to do these things because that would be dead works we can say clothes dress hire Etc oh that's just just dead works because works is something that you do to try to make yourself better amen right all right but see he says dead works now what are dead Works Paul brother brandom what is your definition of dead Works he said well I know what brother BR how he'd be dead works is is anything that you think think that would would save you we call that dead Works CU we know better than that that's right but is that his definition of dead works that's right what was his definition of dead works now remember Paul said two times now he says going on to Perfection and not laying again the foundation of repentance right from dead works and a faith toward God and he says over in Hebrews 9:14 he's talking about Christ and the the word of God and the things and he says leaving those dead works now you're going to have to to think with me because I saw that that didn't come across the way I wanted it to be brought and I really didn't cover a lot about it so I knew that I would be bringing a message brother brandom what is dead works okay let's see what he had to say about it okay paragraph 18 4 Hebrews Quest Hebrews chapters 5 and 6 57908 we would take it verse by verse each one of those things baptism we believe it there's one hope one Lord One Faith one baptism now that's not according to denominations right right that's not according to a lot of the people this message right right so that's a whole lot deeper than just talking about well we believe in one God the Baptist Doctrine is one God you talk to any Baptist and he'll tell you he believes in one God right that's right but when you narrow him down he'll say God in three persons bless his Trinity right because that's what I said right cuz that's the way I believed it see the basic doctrine of the bap his church is one God that's right go talk to one and find out but see the doctrine then is not true of their idea and we don't want to take that as a principle because it would not be correct see right to believe that he's God in three person Blessed Trinity right and get it right there's one hope one Lord One Faith one baptism we believe that there's a baptism we believe in the resurrection of the Dead absolutely we believe Jesus Christ Jesus died and rose again we believe that laying on the hands for the sick that's what it said these signs shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover we believe that but what is that now are you reading but what is that Paul said it's all dead works it's something you do now let's look go on to Perfection now brother Randon are you and Paul in agreement Paul sums up his thoughts in Hebrews 6 and Hebrews 9 was saying that it looks like the understanding of one God the water baptism the no eternal hell the you know the things the judgments his dead works now what are you saying Paul what are you saying saying brother brandom what are you saying now to sum that up then let's make a statement and see if we can prove it going through if you take the message of Luther Wesley Pentecost just say the Pentecostal you know and you stay with that and refuse to move on now we're talking about the truth now we're not talking about Pentecostalism you know as a garbage kin right now I don't mean that wrong God knows it I'm just trying to make a blunt Point not talking about the the the the problems they've got I'm talking about there was a truth brought in the days of Martin Luther right of the J shall live by faith we must believe that there was a truth bought in the days of John Wesley of sanctification we must believe that all right there was the truth of the Pentecostals with the restoration of the gifts and the person of Jesus Christ coming back into church we must believe that but now if we we took that and we stay with it and do not go on with the message what does it become are you with me don't ask you to agree with me I'm just asking you are you listening see if we take anything why is it that we burn the bread after we take the communion you know we take the communion we burn the bad bread as quick as we can why because we believe that God gives a word for each day right and that we don't want to try to hold it over because the children of Israel that took the bread and tried to store up a little bit of it what did it do it rotten am real good one day right the next day it was rotten right now I believe Paul and brother brandom is explaining that and and I'm up for anybody that's got a different idea see if we don't go on with the message the message becomes and forgive me God and I'm just human I don't know how to talk it would become stale right right stagnated right right you're a Pentecostal and you won't go on with the message of the hour right what you have becomes dead works right is that Paul's definition is that brother brandom's definition but brother Dale you mean you can understand one God water baptism no eternal hell Resurrection all of that and it become dead Works brother brandom said that's what it is we believe that but what is that Paul said it's dead works is something you do y oh no no no no no he he he he meant to say well you meant all you want to right but I can that's the only way I can see it to be able to keep a line up of the message the way that it is now Martin Luther had the message with the just you live by faith you know what that gave him the new birth right you agree gave him a new birth but it won't give us the new birth today right what is justification today a work of the Holy Spirit yes but it is not the new birth you must go through justification signification the baptism and the Holy Ghost have the new birth see what we have will then become dead works amen if we don't go on right now remember my titles of the subtitle or the main title is Faith for that time and I tried to explain on there that all of those days were wonderful Luther Wesley Pentecost Etc but that was faith for that time that even the faith of the father to be restored to the Bride of Jesus Christ if we don't go on it is only faith for the time and will only reserve us a place you know in glory but we have to have a resurrection that's right now Paul said let us go on to Perfection he said we will if God permit it but you know what I'll get this this evening again you know what God didn't permit Paul and him to go on to Perfection that's right amen right mean is that true he didn't permit it right he withheld that until the end time am right Perfection there in the the scripture let us go on to Perfection is what a full age same as Matthew 5:48 where Jesus said be therefore perfect even as your father in Heaven is perfect right by the new birth you're perfect but the new birth doesn't automatically put you in the res in the rapture you know what I'm talking about the change the change the change I'm not talking about the New Birth will'll get to it this see and automatically puts you yes in the Rapture yes but not the ra you know you may have to die and go by the grave right all right I believe Paul is trying to explain to us that we need to go on and I was noticing brother randam used Paul a lot in statements like this he said Paul was one that did not want to stay in one place you remember that so he was constantly traveling and said doing that he was constantly wanting to travel in the word you know the depth of the word he didn't want to just quit even though it would be said about him about Peter that Paul says things hard to be understood see he wanted to go on now I I didn't bring them for you to read but uh I guess left it laying in the office but brother brandham says that Paul took five chapters to bring him together in the laying down of the deity of Jesus Christ and the things you know cuz I've made that statement that you come on over and Paul is saying you know the sum of this you know that he made all those chapters to bring it together H but you see if we don't go on in God's word that is what causes organizations to appear right that causes denominations to come on the scene why because the people didn't go on right you said no brother Dale are denominations when he got off well okay we we'll know what we're talking about but you'll know what I'm talking about too that they started out right right Luther started out right yeah true but he didn't continue on and it wasn't meant for to be continued on so thereby the people took his message and denominated it now Luther didn't denominate that's right wesle didn't denominate they denominate his message okay try to make those things plain dead works then as I was saying a moment ago works is something you think you do that's going to help you or make you better and dead work shows that there's nothing you can do there's not a thing we can do to make oursel better that's right quit this quit that that makes you a good person right come on it doesn't say you to quit this do that now it makes you a good person okay simple as can be now Paul in no way or neither was brother Brown and I got a big circle around this and got it highlighted heavily Paul was not calling the truth of one God water baptism right uh the resurrection Etc as to be a dead works that would be something wrong right right right no had he brought that he would be contrary to his own self right because he was the one saying this is where we're at and we will continue on if God permits now he's the one that said that so he knew that God was not going to permit it like I said the other day Paul was trying his best to get it out of the mind of the people that Jesus Christ was coming at that time right but see we think he was trying to get him to see what coming now he trying his best to get it out of their mind cuz he said there got to be a fallen away right amen now was he in any way calling the faith of the fathers would surely you think Paul was there would you right amen was he trying in any way to call that dead works as a false Doctrine now let's move away and you're going to read some things from Brother brandom that's going to sound like and it will be but when they took the doctrine of one God and twisted it into a trinity that truly became what de dead works right so as we're reading that think of that dead works is our carnal concept upon the word of God Amen our carnal revelation will be dead work yes but remember also that Paul and brother randam is explaining dead works as being that we don't continue on with God all right does everybody understand that now there are dead work when you twist the word of God and you make the go the word of God say anything contrary it automatically becomes a dead works right right cuz there's no salvation in it God is not obligated to that Twisted word now he did wink at ignorance because Martin Luther brought the message of the just shall live by faith but he said in a pub and drank beer and talked about the doctrines right right why because the message of sanctification has been lost in the Dark Ages so he didn't have the truth on that lineup there but he had the truth of the just your live of Faith amen all right now you understand do I need to repeat that again cuz I know that when I say things I look at you and some of you going that way that way some sleep some of them's playing with the kids and some of them's writing notes and some of them texting on your telephones and I've asked you to cut them off but you still sit in text with them that's right now you say well that's that's important to me well all you got to do is explain to anybody between this hour and that hour we're in church right don't call me during that time the only one that sort of call you or anybody that would call is a telemarketer do you want to talk to to them right you know what I'm saying cuz they don't have no hours anybody that knows you they know that you're in church at that time amen they don't nobody but a Jehovah Witness ever pull up in my yard after 8:00 on Sunday morning cuz I'm not there my family don't come they know where I'm at my sister one time something went wrong with it was a problem years ago and my sister come running up here to tell me about it you know you understand what I'm getting at that's right let's let's be Christians about everything all and don't get hurt when brother Dale brings out things to you if it's the truth just say thank you Lord you know and go on and forget it but now I'm going to State it one more time then Paul is not saying that the truth is a dead works now he's not saying that brother randam is not saying the truth is dead works that's right and he's not just saying that perverted truth is dead works right see he's saying that if we don't go on to Perfection what we have can become dead works I explained it that's what causes denominate organizations and then that goes on and causes denominations is people that won't go on all right does everybody understand that if you don't agree with me meet me after your service that's fine with me but I'm I want to hear your understanding about it but you see brother randam and Paul is saying we've got to go on if you to asked brother brandom in 1965 the last message he preached was what communion if you to asked him that day said brother Brandon what do we need to do you know what he said we need to go on right because we've not reached the completion right amen we've not reached the Perfection that we need to be because the completion and Perfection that we need to come to is the resurrection and the Rapture right right so now I hope you understand then and then we'll read what brother R said so just remember he's not making the faith of the fathers the truth of the Gospel any form of dead Works he's making it the fact that we stop and refuse to go on now you tell me now I'll make this statement and just leave it for whatever if brother Bram preached the seals why can't we understand him right if he preached Daniel 70 weeks why can't we understand it that's right see but we don't need to understand them things dead works that's what you just done you died when you say we don't need to understand the revealed word in its highest Apex of ever what could be brought to change this body you're making the message dead works right am that's right all right let's go on number two in your notes Hebrews paragraph 1 I was 84 and this is just the the next one right on that now First Corinthians let's read number one over again cuz some people forget what you read and then they got their computers cut off and they got to arguing about what you're saying and they running their quotes in their mind to where they thinking you don't write it down to where they can argue with you later about it so now let's go back cut the computers off start let's reread that first quote okay then we ought to take it verse by verse each one of those things baptisms we believe it there's one hope one Lord One Faith one baptism that's a faith of the father's statement right from a man that would understand we believe that there's a baptism we believe in the resurrection of the Dead absolutely we believe Jesus died and rose again we believe that laying on the hands for the sick that's what it said that's right these Sons shall follow them that believe if they lay their hands on the sick they shall recover we believe that but what is that Paul said it's all dead works it's something you do now let's go on to Perfection now what's he saying that's something you do cuz you see if you think that that makes you something you have made it dead works right if you think just believing the message makes you perfect you're making the message dead works okay he says let's go on laying on the hands them all as orders of the church but let's go on into Perfection there's only one that is perfected that's Jesus amen Now 1 Corinthians 12 how do you get into that body by shaking hands no sir by joining the church no sir by being baptized backward forward in the name of Father Son and Holy Ghost the name of Jesus Christ am come on the name of Rose of Sharon the lily of the valley the Morning Star anything that you want that has nothing to do with it it's just an answer of a good conscience towards God and yet we fuss and stew and argue and split and make differences that's right but all those are it works we're going on to Perfection now those statements has been laying before me for a long time whether they lay before you or not that's all right when brother brandom is calling it and Paul is calling the word of the truth dead works you better perk your ears spiritually speaking up and start listening because I never had the answer if You' have asked me I could have read these quotes but I didn't have the answer as to saying that Paul is saying if we stay in one place right we will make what we've got dead works so we must be constantly moving and I thank God for that because that's my goal ever since I've been here that I constantly are trying to climb higher and higher well you just preach the same thing over again I would advise you to go listen again you might find out we move up just a little bit you know into a little higher realm of course if you get all tied up in it and fussing and stewing about it you ain't going to see the higher R Hebrews chap 5-6 1957 908 morning service paragraph 188 he's bringing down about the religious man and the Bible and the schools and the things and moving mountains and everything well they say that's man's religion but he's nothing Paul said never become nothing for where there tongues they shall cease and where there's prophecies this shall fail right where there's all these other things will fail but when that it is perfect is come that which is in part will be done away see that's perfect what is perfect love what is love God let us lay aside all these little dead works and ordinances and ordinance and go on to Perfection you see it we're perfected through Christ how do you get into it by the Holy Ghost baptism I like to hear you preach about how perfect we are but just remember we can't be perfect if we don't walk in the light of the age right amen right right right and that in a daily walk not just in a 40-year period that we're in the message you know but continually going on same message paragraph 210 we'll read right on down through this because it's just a continuation I would advise you to read the Hebrew Book especially chapter 5 6 7 if you get that in your mind that he's speaking here that forms of reformation causes death now what's he talking about where's he at he still right in the book of Hebrews Paul said leaving the principles go on to Perfection not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works and of Faith toward Faith towards God doctrines of B baptism laying on of hands resurrection of the Dead Eternal judgment Reformation forms causing death was the right words that's actually what Paul wrote see what he's trying to do now all these things like baptism one baptism backwards so you say oh now he's attacking all these bad doctrines okay they're dead works I spoke that they're dead works but just remember he's using the truth now all of these baptism one baptized backward one forward one in the name of the father Son and the Holy Ghost one Jesus's name one this way and that way and all these different little things of baptisms and of laying on our hands bless God I got the gift of laying on our hands Hallelujah you can get it this way and Hallelujah the people trying to explain how to get it laying all P that aside because that's dead works these reformations reforming see he's speaking of another class cuz this other classes don't want can go in Perfection okay he said let's get away from that and go on to Perfection the church is still lingering back in those things that's what they were trying to do the early Hebrew church was trying to say well I was baptized by our mercy and and I was got this and this and all these things he said lay all that aside leaving it behind but now did he say we shouldn't do it now listen to what he said about that and this will will this we will do God permits and the original said the same thing this we shall do do if God permits us see this we shall do if God permits us baptism lay on hands and things but that isn't perfect that's only the carnal reform right and that's where the churches leave off at today is on the carnal reform right one of them said well oh well the water the word baptized means it's this and it means that they set up organizations and one sprinkles the other one poures the other one baptizes his face forward the other one backward and all of those things some of them laying on the hands for the sick and some making Apostles and some making prophets and so forth by laying on the hands and preaching the resurrection from the dead and which is all right and the Supreme deity of Jesus Christ that's all right but he said all these are carnal reformations we've just been reforming now let us go into Perfection did you get the picture now let us go into Perfection dead works well not sure yeah we can see now brother Dale that all of it's about them denominations formed all these things where did the denominations come from that's right right every denomination there is came from the truth right misinterpreted of mankind they took the truth and made a denomination turning out to be carnal reform now did you get what he's talking about see that's why the AES went the way they did I thought we believe that Luther Wesley now listen and Pentecost I'm talking about zeusa street right you understand me do I need to bring these if you I'll be glad to he didn't just cover Reformation in Luther and Wesley he covered Reformation in Luther Wesley and Pentecost because they were carnal reform proved it because they denominated and died now the true Bride for that age was sealed Away by the revelation of that age in the time right sure but it took him to the Grave by reforming it took the people to the Grave John Wesley taught that sanctification was the baptism of the Holy Ghost he didn't treat this sanctification like everybody says about it they don't even read they don't read like read around talking about Martin Luther with all the gifts but John Wesley believed that he was Sanctified by the blood that's right that's Bible all right you took a truth made it a carnal reform you made it a dead Works cuz you're not saved you're not you're kept saved by the blood your Prophet said he said you're saved by grace through faith you're kept saved by the blood right but you understand what I'm saying and you'll see the point look at your song books and see if all of them about blood wasn't written in the age of of John Wesley right along in that period of time I know it was the blood I know it was the blood they didn't say about the life cuz you're saved by grace through faith the blood Keeps Us saved but it's not the chemistry of the blood that keeps you saved that was put on the ground and covered as a part to cover us to keep us from being killed with all the rest you know made a bu for blood but it wasn't the blood right but you see that's what they believed right and that made the word carnal reform I trying to think of the one that's listening brother brother said he said I used to believe that he said don't believe it no more though and it was from night to day of the truth I'll think of it minute but do you understand Hebrews chapter 6 paragraph 241 you read all of it though they be members of the church members of the Earthly body may they go on and lay aside those carnal dead works and press on to the Perfection you read all up and down Hebrews chapter 5 ver and six paragraph 188 let us go into Perfection how can we be perfect through the death of Christ not through joining church not through through any good works what we do that's all all right not because we were baptized this way or that way not because that we've been healed by laying on our hands not because of any of those things these any of these other things we believe in the death Burl and the resurrection right where we going paragraph 209 chapter 6 let's go on to Perfection now we got that this morning morning how that we're perfected perfected absolutely spotless and blameless not one sin on us are we above Temptation never do we sin every day yes sir but yet we are perfected see now that's going on why it's not just under understanding that Jesus saved us but understanding that by being in Jesus Christ we become Perfect Right trying to inter relate just a little bit to you cuz I'll come back to this turn over and look at number eight on your notes Hebrews chapter 6 and 7 57 9:15 the morning service paragraph 254 255 continued reading then in last Sunday we takeen leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ in the sixth chapter we read this let us go into Perfection and we found out that the people today in many churches along with the brandham Tabernacle and different ones oh now look what he says we late too much studying on studying about the principles of Christ brother brandham what do you mean that we lay too much emphasis We Lay too much study about the principles of Christ he was the son of Abraham he was the son of of of so and so and on back to genealogies but the Bible said let us lay aside those things and go on to Perfection now that's getting down in are deep where you live at folks right cuz without a revelation what are you going to say right first you must know the doctrine because he said leaving the principles and then we must know all these things then let's lay them aside he said of resurrection of the Dead lay on hand baptism and all those dead articles of God and yet they have no life in them but the church today just goes to those things oh we believe the deity of Christ we believe in the water baptism we yes sir laying on our hands in other words let me put one in here we believe the message you know Paul said we do all of this we'll do all of this if God permits but in the face of all of that let's lay aside lay it aside now and going to Perfection the church cannot be perfected through organization it gets further away from God all the time or further away from each other we draw barriers we separate ourselves seemingly not having the faith but then we leave those principles of Doctrine if we move on to Perfection then those little things become of not much use we go into a relationship y now what's going on to perfection we go into a relationship see it's not arguing in the head of the doctrines right right and we find that the only way that we can be perfect perfected is to be in Christ and you find out then by the teachings of the Bible how that we get into Christ not by water baptism not by laying on the hands not by teaching of teach not by teaching but by one Spirit we're all baptized into one body and become perfected through his suffering then we look different we think different we act different we live different not because it's a Duty or we belong to church but because the love that God has shed abroad in our hearts by the holy ghost that makes us fellow citizens of the kingdom of God then there's no denominations or barriers in that we're all we're all one great body okay paragraph 179 chapter 5 and 6 Hebrews 1957 908 now you brand them Tabernacle I know we have healings that's wonderful we have visions oh that that's fine and you can have spiritual dreams and sometimes they're not spiritual dreams and sometimes we we try to help the poor we do all that we can that's all right but that's not we're not what we're talking about now we're entering into another phase leave the doctrine oh yes we got the doctrine of Christ we believe he was the son of God and virgin born we believe that with all these things that is wonderful but leaving that let's go on to Perfection okay I won't get to the rest part of it so I'll take that up this evening leaving the principles of the doctrine of Christ let us go on to Perfection amen I hope you understand what Paul was saying what brother Randon was saying but you never leave the word of God that's right that is your principle your beginning your foundation you always tie everything to that and that's where I see the people of the message the problem is they can't put their Doctrine back to the principal that's you know go back in the word of God and take the word of God so they got their ideas and on across all right but now I have no problem with that my problem is me and you and as I sit there a moment ago then why would you be afraid of the teaching of the seals uh Daniel 70 weeks uh marriage and divorce uh what else why would you be afraid of it right right man my be your idea well let's come and let's see if it was my idea I'll be glad to sit I talk with anybody about what I've preached and let's see if that's what brother Ram said right well that's your idea what brother bram's idea I mean you ain't going to convert nobody but by preaching the truth to them it takes God to convert people ain't no way to convert nobody to any if you do then they just reconvert You by deprogramming you you know like brother would used to say you get them in with the hot dog they'll get them out with a hamburger but you see church if you and I don't go on even what we have taught and been taught can become dead works right amen dead works it can become carnal reform or we can show that we're still into Reformation CU you see if we don't go to a change you know what's wrong with us Reformation right right oh no we're not in the age of reformation I don't care what you say that's right that's right amen message is Reformation to most people No it's h dress clothes Etc a big part of them then it's all kind of this and then it's just jumps up and becomes all kind of false doctrines to other that ain't got nothing to do with you and I amen ain't thing in the world to do with you and me right amen it's whether or not Lula has dead works oh my right the prophet said that the the Pentecostals was doing good with what he say in the seal book he said they cabbage down on it right that's right so you and I can do that and say look what we've got look at the message we've got look how it's been preached to us and we can cabbage down on it of course that's what a lot of people thinks today we've done okay right right A lot of people think maybe some of you if you don't move on that all we've done is just cabbage down that's up to you because like I said I can't convert you right that's what I've said you think right now that I've dropped back you think that I've come up and I've dropped back to a very low form if I was you i' change you thinking we had and drop back we've taken one giant step I told you the other night what I believed I went back and listen to that two or three times two times T not I said I believe the headstone is here to bring his own message come on now it ain't going to be no different than Brother randam come on now he brought the message so now you think that brother Dale was saying The Headstone going to bring his message going to be something different brother randam then I'm sorry for your soul that needs woring by the water of the word that we went this long and you think that's where we would be heading but you see I believe the headstone Here Am cuz the hi and body of the Prophet said you not in the last days to bring the message the message can't be anything contrary to brother brandham but if we don't take brother bram's message and go on to Perfection come on brother now remember brother bradam whether or not you believe in a return Ministry or whatever you believe now it's no problem with me cuz I don't it's nothing to me right you believe in a return Ministry brother randam at this time is in the grave righten come on now you believe in return Ministry okay he's in the grave right so then something's got to bring him out of the Grave that's exactly right y see because you're not just playing games with me I don't play games I believe in return ministry that's sir I believe in the resurrection brother Brandon will be the first in that Resurrection yes amen yes sir but it's that's what's keeping him from what's keeping you in ey from a change right now is because we're not to where he was we can have the faith of the fathers we can stand in higher places but until we reach the position as the bride of Christ around the world not one individual but as the bride of Christ around the world becomes one with that message he brought then he'll come up out of the gra that's right amen that's right I believe that and I believe he can preach to us after he raises too but it won't be a message of redemption right and I believe the headstone is here bringing its own message amen and see then I would be if I was you I would listen but not listen with the ears of trying to play games but to see if we are progressing instead of saying we're only playing around yeah I don't generally talk this way to years so i' listen for you we can take what we've heard of R R's message and we can make it carnal reform right that doesn't mean we're lost is Luther and Wesley them lost is the Pentecost you know the're genuine are they lost no no no no come on but they went into the grave because of carnal reform therefore leaving the principles of the seals M oh of Daniel 70 weeks there you go the Rapture let us go on to Perfection until we manifest what that Prophet has taught in our hearts and lives let's stand come over don't make it dead Works let's try 224 in red book 224 in the red book anybody have a need take on these things are we going on or are we sitting down you know could you see I believe in an eternal God an eternal word that cannot be exhausted and once we get out of this world we will get according to the prophet and message of cheer it'll still be unfolding we will still be seeing the Perfection of the perfection and still enjoying iten let's sing step My Savior go GL and with hising hand he leads the way and with each bread I whisper I do you each each step by one at a time is all we can take leaves me home until some will be each step by day just be closer have you ever been here Faith begin to w we I see a change that we got to go to I see the Paul said we don't see all things the man that taught us all of he said we don't see all things but said we see Jesus we see Jesus don't make it dead work sit down and P it down step by me listen church we can get so exalted in in our thoughts look what we've got and what the other people don't have that's right all right but let's don't cabbage down on it now brother Dale is never one to want to stop I want to keep going that's keep preaching until we walk through that gate that's right to glory amen that's all all I've ever tried to do if I say things that I'm sorry that you think I'm exalted but I'm not I'm praising God we're around the world go call your ministers and ask them do they understand Daniel 70 weeks and they'll tell you no they don't understand it who ask them about the seal oh yeah we understand the sealed that's the Antichrist if I was you just asking and saying it do what you want do if I was you I'd start in the seal book and I'd read because we're headed there I would start reading in the seal book and read page one just keep going how long it'll take to get there I don't know because you got to have a foundation but you see let's go on to Perfection I trust in God no matter for life eternal in his hand he holds the key that opens up the way that will anybody have a each step I I know that he will guide me to high he ever amen our
