[0:02] don't want to stay later time they'll
[0:06] leave down that cord a custom yeah all
[0:11] right we cannot discuss how many know
[0:15] what nostalgia is right hey everybody
[0:19] always have experienced nostalgia at
[0:21] some point or another I tend to be a
[0:24] very rustic type person I can leave it
[0:27] at the Latino and you know yes you know
[0:30] feelings and all that stuff you know
[0:32] this but uh still careful okay yeah you
[0:36] wish for better times and uh you know
[0:39] some of the things that make me
[0:41] nostalgic and of course childhood
[0:43] memories and you know for me it was a
[0:49] it's music it's a video game that I used
[0:54] to play you know sometimes I have fun
[0:58] you can have access to video games now
[1:00] that used to be Jewish to play and
[1:03] sometimes I get into that and like wow
[1:06] but then it kind of leads to a point
[1:09] where like man it doesn't lead anywhere
[1:11] right it doesn't really fulfill you
[1:13] fulfilled you for a moment but then it
[1:15] doesn't really bring anything - you
[1:17] can't relive those days again right
[1:19] right same thing with I don't know maybe
[1:21] a smell of cologne or perfume or
[1:24] something like that
[1:25] you smell that and I you think mine that
[1:27] takes me back to when I was with
[1:30] such-and-such girl or with such as that
[1:32] guy where I used to wear this trying to
[1:34] impress yeah such and such a part of you
[1:37] know yeah but wait does it have that
[1:40] right it's another very
[1:43] what you got there you know sometimes
[1:47] you're at a restaurant and you hear a
[1:48] certain song and you remember oh my that
[1:50] was at such a place this was happening
[1:53] my not that's a feeling of nostalgia now
[1:56] the feeling of nostalgia there's nothing
[1:59] wrong with it within itself right but
[2:01] it's you dwelling in that feeling
[2:04] thinking that that feeling is going to
[2:06] change your present situation when it's
[2:09] never I change or you're in the
[2:10] situation and I think I broke in and so
[2:13] sometimes we uh you know we grab things
[2:16] to fulfill that but we realize it only
[2:20] brings temporary pleasure now the
[2:24] Webster's dictionary of the words of
[2:26] saga means a wistful or excessively
[2:28] sentimental yearning for return to or of
[2:32] some past period or
[2:34] irrecoverable condition you can't bring
[2:37] back you can't recover those times back
[2:39] certainly you can recover things that
[2:41] were recorded from that and kind of live
[2:44] it in the moment but you can't you can't
[2:46] fully live back those days again right
[2:48] now and also a pleasure and sadness that
[2:51] it's caused by remembering something
[2:53] from the past and wishing that you could
[2:56] experience it again I was questioning
[2:58] that God wants to be said the other time
[3:02] trying to live in the past now we're
[3:04] going to look at something here in a
[3:05] moment that God does want us to remember
[3:07] and the past is very important because
[3:11] that's where we grow that's where we
[3:13] learn things right now I want to get
[3:16] ahead of myself but this is what Solomon
[3:21] said in Ecclesiastes say not thou what
[3:24] is the cause that the former days were
[3:26] better than these for thou does not
[3:29] enquire widely concerning destroy my
[3:31] question is to you do you think that
[3:33] Solomon is saying that is that
[3:35] nostalgia's is bad come as you obviously
[3:39] he's talking about uh nostalgia
[3:41] we haven't rust out or thinking about
[3:44] the former days right but it's nostalgia
[3:47] that within itself
[3:48] no but it's bad when you try to think
[3:53] that going back to that time is going to
[3:56] change your present condition right
[3:57] that's what's wrong
[3:59] the atonement is not talking about the
[4:02] actual feeling of nostalgia but the
[4:04] foolish attitude that nostalgia can lead
[4:08] someone to have you know sometimes we
[4:12] don't feel that the past is there in
[4:14] some way or another than your present
[4:16] condition especially if you're going
[4:18] through some trial in your life or
[4:21] you're some sickness in your life you
[4:22] think my things were better back then
[4:24] but you have to realize that God has you
[4:26] in in a in a position in our place that
[4:30] you are right now if you're a Christian
[4:32] if you're one of his children he's
[4:33] trying to mold your character right he's
[4:36] trying to make you into his very image
[4:39] whereas right now you're closer to the
[4:41] very image than you were 10 15 20 years
[4:44] ago
[4:44] but where at least you should be Roger 7
[4:47] so dwelling in the past our thinking the
[4:50] things were better back then it's not
[4:54] going to make things better now you have
[4:55] member Christ is a living Christ he's
[4:58] the same yesterday today and forever
[5:01] he's a ever-present God and he wants us
[5:03] to recognize that he's always present
[5:06] ever-present help in the time of trouble
[5:08] it's what the Bible says right and and
[5:13] you know not not trying to be critical
[5:15] but you know I've heard testimonies of
[5:17] people especially older older
[5:19] individuals where they said I wish we
[5:21] could go back to the good old days the
[5:24] good old days not you know
[5:25] and I'm cinder thinking you know and it
[5:29] kind of make you feel like my good old
[5:32] days what about my good old days this
[5:35] now I have teared old things - yeah my
[5:38] my good old days don't matter but their
[5:41] good old days is just if you're not
[5:42] there but what if I feel young people
[5:45] for a young person now about oh my
[5:47] they're nothing like my good old days
[5:49] you know
[5:49] they'll think what about my fiddle
[5:52] didn't what about my days my former days
[5:55] you know so it almost makes you feel it
[5:59] makes me make you look a little bit
[6:01] self-centered when you talk about how my
[6:04] days were better than yours and your
[6:05] present situation now so so that's just
[6:10] uh that's just something we got we got
[6:13] to be careful to be mindful of people's
[6:15] situations now you know be mindful of
[6:18] people's present conditions but now what
[6:21] they're experiencing now certainly what
[6:24] you had it was was great and that's your
[6:27] experience that's what you experienced
[6:29] but also remembering there's other
[6:31] things that people experience in now or
[6:33] that the words very important to other
[6:35] people as well even younger than you
[6:37] right right I don't need that be
[6:39] critical and saying I don't know if
[6:41] anybody here has done that just I just
[6:43] heard of people other people in the past
[6:45] kind of like the attitude they take but
[6:48] now let's bring it down home spiritually
[6:52] the agree that living in the past is a
[6:55] form of losing touch of reality of the
[6:59] present today
[7:02] get in and unfortunately that's how many
[7:06] Methos believers live we live with a
[7:09] spiritual nostalgia exactly how they
[7:14] live a lot of room left and you see it
[7:16] now even more than ever go
[7:18] I've talked to two to two believers who
[7:23] believe this madness for a long time who
[7:27] lived in the times of brother Branham I
[7:29] noticed that just say man I wish we
[7:32] could just get back to those times not
[7:34] realizing that you're never going to
[7:37] relive those days in Contra but you are
[7:40] going to live should be living the
[7:42] message that was preached there you know
[7:44] that's what we need to be concerned
[7:45] about level brother Bob was talking
[7:48] about you know on Wednesday I want to
[7:50] know what he said not just what he did
[7:52] but I don't know what he said that's
[7:55] right because what he said is what's
[7:56] going to change me into what he is in
[7:59] manhood see it as if we're trying to
[8:02] relive the day and you have a lot of
[8:03] people nowadays they're trying to relive
[8:06] those days back Lederman's listening to
[8:08] the tapes we're going to get back to the
[8:09] tapes yes definitely we got to get back
[8:11] to the taste we currently do over to win
[8:14] we got to listen to the tapes we've
[8:17] never
[8:17] I don't think anybody here has ever
[8:19] stopped listening to the tapes but to
[8:21] try to use the tapes to join right to
[8:24] try to relive moments in the past even
[8:26] listening to them in places where there
[8:28] or even preach that to think that that's
[8:31] going to bring you know things and stir
[8:34] a revival of some sort that's not going
[8:36] to do it if it's not Christ in you the
[8:39] hope of glory it's not going to stir
[8:40] revival no matter how much how much the
[8:43] tape won't change where the brain is
[8:46] message the screws through the tape
[8:48] won't change you if you just have it up
[8:50] here but you don't bring it down to your
[8:52] heart you can do it that to appetit to
[8:55] our present day right because Christ
[8:58] wants us to remember Christ wants us to
[9:01] the unwanted stuff
[9:03] to be stolen in the past just as well in
[9:05] the factor but he wants us to dwell on
[9:08] the past in order to learn from the past
[9:10] and to it - to our to put it into
[9:13] practice
[9:14] - that right there amen so a lot about
[9:18] you know messes believers that you know
[9:21] they live in their lives looking at what
[9:24] was the good old days of the message and
[9:28] telling to live what the message is
[9:29] producing today but there is you know
[9:32] some some some of us we get criticized
[9:34] for saying for being like Jesus Christ
[9:37] I'm saying I I'm a father of one yeah
[9:41] and you're going to get criticized
[9:42] that's really revealed to you and that's
[9:45] really a revelation that has come from
[9:48] here down to here and that you're living
[9:51] that you're going to get criticized then
[9:53] you're going to even get persecuted not
[9:55] by the world my people is claimed to
[9:57] believe his mattress Brooke food if the
[10:01] people within it was Judas trip within
[10:04] the disciples that Jesus said this thing
[10:10] would be so close that it will deceive
[10:11] the very life if it was toxic that's
[10:14] right it'll come down so close they'll
[10:16] believe the same message is my cue I
[10:18] believe that God sent a prophet in their
[10:20] families our prophet just like you but
[10:23] they think but they can't produce what
[10:25] God has revealed to you which is you are
[10:28] one of your his you are God amen amen
[10:33] that's very powerful sure that's very
[10:36] powerful saying yes so there's some
[10:40] scriptures some scriptures that dumb
[10:47] actually here in Ephesians is that
[10:49] wherefore he says awake thou that
[10:51] sleepest and arise from the dead in
[10:54] Christ shall give thee life see them
[10:56] that ye walk circumspectly not as fool's
[10:59] but as wise redeeming the time because
[11:02] the days are evil so when you're
[11:05] constantly brother just dwelling in the
[11:07] past and thinking that the past is going
[11:09] to change you is that redeeming the time
[11:12] now you're living in the past that
[11:14] you're not living in the present than
[11:15] what God is doing now right my god and
[11:19] you know these days are evil this part
[11:22] we need to do whatever we we can we can
[11:25] in order to redeem the time in order to
[11:27] to to to to two things that will help us
[11:30] to grow into as well as to help people
[11:32] in in the present time right wherefore
[11:37] be ye not unwise but understanding what
[11:39] the will of the Lord is now what the
[11:41] will of the Lord was but the will of the
[11:44] Lord was is always it wasn't a beginning
[11:47] it was now right okay so then
[11:51] entertained all these things I'm not
[11:53] saying you know I'm not I'm not trying
[11:55] to be critical lucky prophet or nothing
[11:57] like that that he had this place just as
[12:01] Moses had this place and he fulfilled
[12:04] they fulfilled their pledge subject but
[12:06] it was there was a time that Joshua had
[12:08] to move on with the payment right right
[12:10] really midnight and that's the same
[12:12] thing that the holy ghost wants it's
[12:14] trying to do with his people with his
[12:16] bride it's to carry them on to another
[12:19] to another position I'm into it - Canaan
[12:21] right not to have your tent put your
[12:24] tent there in the 1950s in the 1960 and
[12:28] leave it there no but we're living in
[12:30] 2017 but it's guys doing now that tent
[12:34] need to go up then their nail to get
[12:36] rusty in this states again trust the
[12:38] unit we need to bring them up and move
[12:40] on
[12:41] this Christ is moving on it if you don't
[12:44] you don't move the crowd huge is going
[12:45] to be left there you gonna be left there
[12:47] and that's the thing I like about Donnie
[12:49] the gentleman he's not going to force
[12:50] you to do anything that you don't want
[12:52] to do if you like living in the 1950s
[12:55] and the 1960s and was in the glory days
[12:57] of the Prophet and all these things but
[13:00] that's up to you but Christ is moving on
[13:02] era right the message is still here and
[13:05] that now one economist I want to say
[13:06] something about that here just a moment
[13:08] because it has to do with the voice not
[13:11] the not not not the not the actual
[13:14] messenger but the voice of the seventh
[13:17] angel what the Bible says right right
[13:21] this what brother Brennan says here and
[13:24] in it I can't find really a good good
[13:27] quote about this I'm I'm not the best at
[13:30] the at the search software and I know
[13:32] evolving Joe and several ways probably
[13:35] better than it that I didn't than I am
[13:37] but rather when I mentioned this a lot
[13:39] of time he said now we find out that the
[13:42] churches to are always promising
[13:44] something like television so for that
[13:47] they never get to the thing they
[13:49] promised as I have often said an old
[13:51] quotation man is always praising God for
[13:53] what he did
[13:54] praising God for what he will do looking
[13:57] forward to what he will do and then
[13:59] ignore what be doing better
[14:01] see they failed that's the way they
[14:04] become history after a while of the
[14:06] polluted sea because they fail to
[14:08] recognize now you can talk of the
[14:11] comfort Christ yet once you talk about
[14:14] the things that that does it through
[14:15] brother branham point right and say that
[14:18] that that a comfort he will give it in
[14:20] the ages to come but refuse the comfort
[14:24] that he's got here now for you that's
[14:27] terrible see it's on the same basis we
[14:30] find that amen now
[14:36] so so so spiritually nostalgic believers
[14:41] you know they're just living it and that
[14:43] they'd gone by and you want to find a
[14:47] lot of I went especially who lived
[14:49] during that time and and it's great to
[14:54] be able to reminisce and for them to be
[14:56] able to tell us their experiences with
[14:59] the Prophet and things like that but for
[15:02] them to not move on with what this
[15:04] message has was was really all about
[15:06] because we're a brand appreciation for
[15:08] him this message to us for you in there
[15:10] amen you know he came to his position we
[15:14] got to come to our pepper and it was
[15:16] this word that brought him to that
[15:17] position is the same word that's going
[15:19] to bring us to that same position right
[15:21] amen so try to relive the days of the
[15:25] Prophet again you know plain tapes and
[15:26] even claim them in the same place of
[15:29] those tapes were recorded at but they
[15:32] fail to bring the word preached in those
[15:34] days into their present lives ever
[15:36] that's it a lot of I would say I would
[15:38] venture to sell the majority of message
[15:41] believers so-called masses relievers do
[15:44] that and you know I think we can only
[15:48] learn from the past you can't learn from
[15:51] the present you can't learn from the
[15:53] present you can't learn from because
[15:55] we're living it now now what I just said
[15:59] is in the past you can learn from that
[16:01] but you can't learn from the present you
[16:03] can't learn in the future because it
[16:04] hasn't happened yet but you can learn
[16:06] from the past right and all of the tapes
[16:10] the Bible was even written in the past
[16:12] were special right the physical body so
[16:15] that's what we learned from men we learn
[16:18] from this media and all you think
[16:20] everything a video that you watch it
[16:23] took place in the past therefore you can
[16:25] learn from so I'm not saying we need to
[16:28] get rid of the tapes or anything like
[16:29] that there's nothing we need those tapes
[16:31] amen
[16:32] we need the Bible even though it was
[16:35] written the past and there's a history
[16:38] behind us
[16:39] those things right and we can only learn
[16:42] from those things but a lot of people
[16:44] take the past to bring up grudges or to
[16:47] bring up a sadness and things in their
[16:50] lives that bring them to a standstill
[16:52] and they can't move on anymore but God
[16:55] doesn't want us to bring the past to
[16:57] bring us to a standstill to sadness and
[17:00] to to have a you know jealousy and all
[17:03] the things not what's not for that it's
[17:06] to learn from it and to give us faith
[17:08] for the future evident in it and to give
[17:11] us faith and to bring us to repentance
[17:12] true and all those things God wanted
[17:15] because there are many scriptures that
[17:17] got in the scripture many scriptures
[17:19] that God says to remember remember
[17:21] remember but it wasn't for them to
[17:24] reminiscence and just have that
[17:26] nostalgic feeling but you know it was
[17:30] for them to remember to learn from it to
[17:32] move on with what they've learned from
[17:34] right that's what God wants us to do
[17:36] they're not just to be spiritually
[17:38] nostalgic right right so so to have
[17:44] those feelings it's not the purpose for
[17:45] us to revisit the facts we need to pass
[17:47] amen
[17:51] and here's some scriptures of there's
[17:55] some scriptures just dip it just as a
[17:57] example Deuteronomy 7 thou shall say in
[18:01] thine heart these nations are more than
[18:02] 9 how can I just possess them thou shalt
[18:04] not be afraid of them but shall shop
[18:07] well remember what the LORD thy God did
[18:09] unto Pharaoh and unto all each of my 1st
[18:14] chronicles said if they come to the lord
[18:16] call upon his name make them make known
[18:18] his deeds among the people sing unto him
[18:22] sing song something I'm talk to you of
[18:24] all his wondrous works glory in the Holy
[18:26] Name
[18:26] let the heart of them rejoice that seek
[18:28] the Lord seek the Lord in his trench
[18:30] seek his face continually remember his
[18:33] mark remember his marvelous works that
[18:35] he has
[18:36] his wonders and the judgments of his
[18:38] mouth man but when you remember it
[18:41] causes you to seek the Lord to seek his
[18:44] face continuously Revelation 33 this is
[18:48] this is Jesus talking to the Church of
[18:50] Sardis remember therefore how thou has
[18:52] received and heard and hold fast and
[18:55] repent that's the purpose of remembrance
[19:01] so
[19:12] skipping out here
[19:14] so those resources there the message and
[19:17] all those things that were there for us
[19:18] to teach us and do I just have nostalgic
[19:22] feelings over those packs but I'm into
[19:24] future so that we can have we repent now
[19:27] we need to repent now and to give a safe
[19:31] for the things that we need faith now to
[19:33] give us faith for the things that we
[19:35] need them in the Tetra right now to
[19:38] dwell in the past or to obsess over
[19:40] former days when brother Brendan was
[19:42] allowed and his works is to yearn for
[19:45] something we can never attain we'll
[19:49] never live those days again right but we
[19:51] could certainly live the message he
[19:53] preached that's what we can live right
[19:55] Dave I'm gonna try because if you try to
[20:00] live it not the step but in any any
[20:03] other way if you try to live in the past
[20:05] or bring the past back to try to get
[20:09] satisfaction out of it it's just going
[20:11] to lead to a heartbreak you know you're
[20:13] not going to lead you anywhere
[20:15] and so the Bible doesn't say but in the
[20:21] days of the messenger right revelation
[20:24] 10 7 I said but in the day to avoid a
[20:28] become a seventh danger now that voice
[20:30] is the same voice that's going through
[20:33] you and me as well and I know right
[20:36] because this is the same God working
[20:38] through brother random as it is working
[20:39] through you and me and it's the same
[20:41] Holy Spirit and this bride has just as
[20:45] much of a voice not the same position
[20:47] that brother Baron had as a prophet but
[20:50] has just as much of that voice as the
[20:52] Prophet had because it's Christ it was
[20:55] it it was Christ speaking through those
[20:57] tapes I tried it was in its Christ
[21:00] speaking to us and that's right it's
[21:04] it's uh it's not your own word the
[21:07] brides and I'll speak her own thing
[21:08] neither the brother branham speak his
[21:10] own saying but of course he has it his
[21:12] opinions
[21:13] just as a man and that's what a lot of
[21:16] people felt to see to that he was a man
[21:18] just like me who had opinions who had
[21:20] thoughts who had who had ideas but when
[21:23] he came to the Word of God it was the
[21:26] workshop and I it was dust that the Lord
[21:28] the truck and he wasn't infallible he
[21:32] did you know we're not we're not we're
[21:34] not him felt a certain style building
[21:36] righteous or fallible estate you can
[21:38] make mistakes it was an empowering
[21:40] we're not infallible but spiritually
[21:43] through him we know we are talking if
[21:47] we've been born again inside America
[21:50] the soul is empowered amen they took
[21:55] taken us back to that Genesis 1:26 man
[21:57] right where's others working so well
[22:02] when I'm talking to my trying to say is
[22:05] it's pointing us back to that so put it
[22:10] there right absolutely
[22:12] because he is they meant so now you look
[22:19] like my train itself I'd okay I got a
[22:21] little is okay never for me I went for
[22:24] you fell for me I got something okay
[22:27] going so if I will extract the Prophet
[22:30] yes and probably the top thank you think
[22:33] if you think these people again no no so
[22:39] that's what that's what crisis is trying
[22:43] to is that's what Christ well that's
[22:46] what a lot of people you know feel that
[22:47] you know they've been programmed in a
[22:49] game of dates and one as a man he made
[22:52] it mr. old yet another person that
[22:54] didn't make mistakes of human was there
[22:56] anything that I do otherwise he wouldn't
[22:59] been able to die for a second and
[23:03] the Savior that he is for cement
[23:05] demanding Great God but so in Revelation
[23:11] 10 sentences but in the days of the
[23:13] voice of the seventh angel when he shall
[23:16] begin to sound the mystery of God
[23:17] shrinking things on try and it's that
[23:20] voice that we need that we need to
[23:22] listen to a pay attention to it and take
[23:25] in our lives again
[23:26] not for not to just reminisce not to
[23:30] just wish those days were back again but
[23:32] to move forward with what God is trying
[23:34] to show us now timing things gracious
[23:37] every time you go now
[23:39] there's the less scriptures Paul said
[23:41] here delicious 3:13 brethren I count on
[23:43] myself to have apprehended but this one
[23:45] thing I do forgetting those things which
[23:47] are behind and reaching forth unto those
[23:51] things which are before I press toward
[23:53] the mark for the prize of the high
[23:56] calling of God in Christ Jesus and
[23:59] that's the same thing when you can do
[24:01] they meant take your things politics
[24:03] everything that was in the Old Testament
[24:05] and the thing that happened in through
[24:08] Christ is alive of Christ and and moving
[24:12] forward and then but not just what nice
[24:14] to always what if Paul would have just
[24:17] stayed I wish I was living in the times
[24:18] of Christ again you know what I wish I
[24:21] you know I wish I didn't do to whatever
[24:22] whatever with with Stephen you know when
[24:25] he was stoned what if he was distraught
[24:27] I'm sure that probably bothered him was
[24:28] right you know him being a compass of
[24:31] Stephens death with it Stephen right
[24:32] sure it was Stephen but he had to move
[24:36] forward because he had to attain amen
[24:39] Christ you know thinking with what
[24:43] talking to people I think I'm wanting to
[24:46] go back to that ethnic peace in World
[24:48] War II and you had a lot of miracles
[24:51] happen
[24:52] the word was going out and that's not
[24:56] here today in that tradition they didn't
[25:01] individual gold around the world filled
[25:03] your pockets not beer yeah so he tears
[25:06] that's right well I guess the word go
[25:08] important and add to what you're saying
[25:10] on the guest one point a glance of the
[25:13] lecture what you're talking about what
[25:16] we think of the things we think of it
[25:19] sometimes we don't want to think of but
[25:21] we build on that
[25:22] see those are those are those have
[25:24] fallacies they're they're fallible
[25:26] they're very things that we made
[25:28] mistakes because that's the first thing
[25:30] our members the mistakes I made
[25:32] well but the infallibility of God's Word
[25:36] takes you all day all the way back that
[25:37] Denson 1:26 man and it never we go back
[25:41] to that it never had a beginning never
[25:45] had em but it is develop this so those
[25:49] thoughts are eternal and really you're
[25:52] not because Paul's telling us east and
[25:55] you say in here he said forget those
[25:56] things which are behind in other words
[25:58] not to take that - well Paul said now we
[26:00] need to forgive the old testament that
[26:01] just living use it as my way saying
[26:04] perteet it forget the things in other
[26:05] words this bothering you that hinders
[26:07] you from behind the temporal things but
[26:11] the infallible thing we have to build on
[26:13] that because they all God's Word is
[26:16] infallible so as far as we look back
[26:18] it's okay to have because I read in
[26:21] Corinthians they were model said Paul
[26:23] tells us that the Old Testament giving
[26:25] does for example and their examples but
[26:29] for us to live on are for us to change
[26:32] shadows correctly but it's but it could
[26:35] be even being shadowed this a reality
[26:37] yet because God's Word how a shadow is a
[26:40] reality so what we're looking back is
[26:42] creating and building on things that are
[26:44] returned build your hopeful thing you
[26:47] but we look back those the things that
[26:49] we look back nostalgia would jump music
[26:53] and cars on that temple
[26:55] all that's temporal even the things you
[26:56] did is a center that temple and you're
[26:59] watching it I think you know that I've
[27:01] done I was talking to Lord open or not
[27:03] I'm sorry but what I did in the past you
[27:06] know and I didn't have to list them you
[27:09] know what came to my song he's ever
[27:11] going we go doesn't mean hope you began
[27:14] to panic we don't I'll really sit in
[27:17] your business sit on the throne
[27:19] somewhere you know he's there Lord
[27:20] forgive me my family yes we believe that
[27:27] there's a sea of forgetfulness that has
[27:29] because that's why it's got something
[27:31] like this 126 man is infallible we hear
[27:34] that he was all these things but he's no
[27:36] power because it's infallibility of God
[27:38] boarded what mate is what produces that
[27:40] destined one conceived and that's what
[27:42] we must live there's got to be empowered
[27:45] because it's the Holy Ghost themselves
[27:47] man is the is that bear believe believe
[27:50] it better be empowered
[27:51] yeah but the things we look for behind
[27:54] it where the human that stuff goes away
[27:57] but there is a spiritual nostalgia that
[28:01] is good because because it takes back in
[28:05] and you learn from the things of the Old
[28:07] Testament even the things in the
[28:08] prophets life even thing to the prophets
[28:10] man that's what we learn from yes so we
[28:12] have to look back you had that is we
[28:15] have to look and really if it's hard on
[28:17] you don't look like but it is this is
[28:20] the continued no they just know but
[28:23] forgetting the things which are behind
[28:25] Paul should know he killed Stephen he
[28:29] persecuted the Christians that's what he
[28:31] taught he talked about let's forget
[28:33] about the word that was preached you
[28:35] know no because it's really not
[28:39] flash is here is here never present work
[28:43] so it's good to do the bucket you're
[28:44] gonna vote with the in 2010 we but that
[28:50] second time that costs about I was there
[28:53] my instead of me okay look at that until
[28:57] unknown and we got loud min so you don't
[29:00] have my momentum all right not good good
[29:05] good looking wishing real able teach
[29:26] about what answers
