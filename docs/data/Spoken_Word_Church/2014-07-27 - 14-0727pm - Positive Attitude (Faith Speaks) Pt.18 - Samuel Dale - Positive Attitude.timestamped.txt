[18:33] way back when I started out going to
[18:36] Jamaica now not the first time was there
[18:38] cuz I won't try to make them that old
[18:41] but the second time I think it was that
[18:44] we went uh we went over to brother
[18:46] Reed's home and there was one of those
[18:49] little girls was a little bitty thing
[18:51] and she just took to me and Wade and and
[18:55] we had a good time and you know
[18:57] Fellowship in and and with the little
[18:59] kids cuz I love them you know and
[19:01] they're all this little kids I'm just
[19:03] little kid too but sister Monique we
[19:06] were there at one time and she
[19:08] introduced me to her graduates from I
[19:11] guess 8th grade to the ninth or
[19:14] something like that ninth tth or
[19:16] something and she went around
[19:17] introducing me to them as her white
[19:20] grandfather from

[20:03] certain but you know they keep putting
[20:05] it off it's down to about the 29th now I
[20:07] think but you know that gives us more
[20:10] time to pray for the Lord to come on the
[20:13] scene and we not you know we we believe
[20:15] it and uh we thank God for doctors and
[20:18] for doing things but we still believe
[20:21] God's going to take care of it you know
[20:23] they can cut apart and put in a knee but
[20:25] they can't knit it back so we know who
[20:27] the Healer is so just remember that
[20:29] remember all the other announcements are
[20:31] right uh Hebrews
[20:35] 11 Heavenly Father we thank you for this

[20:39] time upon the Earth that we able to come

[20:53] directing us Lord into Thy word that we
[20:56] may be able to have a part to do in the
[20:58] end time with being the little bride of
[21:01] Jesus Christ on the earth for the last
[21:04] days and we truly believe that we're
[21:05] there and we ask you to just come on the
[21:08] scene now and make yourself manifest in
[21:10] our hearts and our lives because that's
[21:13] what you promised you would do so then
[21:15] we believe your promises and they are

[21:21] your way with us remember the sick touch
[21:23] each one and just Lord have your way
[21:27] father we pray as we read your word that
[21:30] you would come and open that word to our
[21:32] hearts that we may walk in it in Jesus
[21:36] name
[21:37] amen Hebrews
[21:42] 11 now Faith is a substance of things
[21:44] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[21:46] Seen for by it the elders obtained a
[21:49] good report through faith we understand
[21:52] that the worlds were framed by the word
[21:53] of God so that things which are seen
[21:56] were not made of things which do appear
[21:59] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[22:01] excellent sacrifice than came by which
[22:04] he obtained a witness that he was
[22:08] righteous and God testifying of his
[22:11] gifts and by it he being dead yet
[22:15] speaketh now I hope we get this
[22:18] far Hebrews
[22:21] 12 we'll start reading at verse 21 now
[22:25] this is the description of Paul talking
[22:28] about about SII you know and the and the
[22:32] Lord coming down and the different
[22:33] things uh the voice of words and
[22:36] trumpets and all and so terrible was the
[22:38] sight that Moses said I exceedingly fear
[22:41] and
[22:42] Quake but ye are come now ye us us are
[22:47] come unto Mount
[22:49] Zion and unto the city of the Living
[22:52] God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an
[22:55] innumerable company of angels to the
[22:58] general assembly and Church of the
[23:00] firstborn which are written in heaven
[23:03] and to God the judge of all and the
[23:05] spirits of just men made perfect and to
[23:08] Jesus the mediator of the New Testament
[23:11] New Covenant right and to the blood of
[23:16] sprinkling that speaketh better things
[23:19] than that of Abel you may be seated the
[23:21] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[23:23] the word all right we got through the
[23:26] part this
[23:29] morning of uh speaking
[23:33] about Abel and how that
[23:39] uh it was revealed unto him that it was
[23:44] blood and not fruit or flowers or you
[23:50] know things and and we wholeheartedly
[23:53] believe in the fact that if Cain had a
[23:58] accepted the way Abel did you know even
[24:01] after he kind of rose up kind of against
[24:03] him and that but had he accepted him the
[24:07] prophet verifies it the Bible verifies
[24:10] it that Cain could would have been
[24:13] accepted had you know had he done right
[24:17] but he didn't do right proving his being
[24:21] and who he was and what he
[24:22] was but he the point is he rejected
[24:26] God's way he wouldn't accept
[24:29] it now even
[24:32] though he had two witnesses against
[24:36] him all right he had Abel's
[24:40] word he had Abel's
[24:43] thoughts Abel told him I'm sure he
[24:45] probably as I was trying to express this
[24:47] morning this is over a period of time
[24:49] that they talk not a f minute
[24:51] conversation and he explained to him the
[24:54] things of evidently what happened in the
[24:56] garden
[24:58] problems you know evidently you know I
[25:01] mean surely these things were talked
[25:03] about and how that God offered the blood
[25:07] sacrifice well why not them to offer a
[25:09] blood sacrifice see Abel had a um a good
[25:15] foundation to put it on and uh you know
[25:19] and God was able to speak to him from
[25:22] that Revelation he had so he had to
[25:24] witness of Abel against him and he had
[25:27] God's witnesses that Abel was right
[25:31] because he accepted Abel's sacrifice and
[25:33] rejected Caines but then he talked to
[25:36] him so I guess you'd make that three
[25:37] Witnesses against him you know God came
[25:40] down to talk to
[25:43] Cain and said you why are you
[25:46] mad why are you
[25:49] upset you
[25:51] know why is it today you talk to
[25:53] somebody about a doctorine and the place
[25:55] gets
[25:56] red
[25:58] you know and they'll start hollering and
[26:00] screaming at
[26:02] you I'm not talking about the world I'm
[26:04] talking about the people this Mage I'm
[26:06] not out there too much not out too much
[26:09] now
[26:10] but just cross them on a Doctrine you
[26:13] can cross someone who's going to be
[26:15] president and get by with
[26:17] it but you cross somebody over their
[26:19] little Doctrine and I like what
[26:23] Armstrong said I believe him said one
[26:25] time if you destroy a man's Doctrine
[26:27] you've destroyed the person and I think
[26:30] about that a lot if you tell somebody
[26:33] they're wrong and you show them they're
[26:35] wrong you've destroyed their doctr you K
[26:39] that of
[26:40] that surely look like AEL would I mean
[26:43] Kane would have accepted it when
[26:46] God personally talked with
[26:50] him you say if God would just tell me
[26:53] I'd believe this Doctrine was
[26:56] wrong he told
[26:59] Cain and Cain wouldn't accept
[27:04] it now that's a bad situation is
[27:07] it but
[27:09] anyhow The Story Goes On that he finally
[27:13] killed him because of his Doctrine I
[27:17] remember preaching years ago about 1979
[27:20] basically on the seals and I used it as
[27:24] like in the garden there that you know
[27:27] that you had the white horse rider the
[27:29] black horse rider you know the White
[27:31] Horse Rider red horse rider black horse
[27:33] rider because you see Cain you put it
[27:35] every bit in there did he turned down
[27:37] the
[27:39] Revelation and the second horse riders
[27:41] read he killed
[27:44] Abel and then he went to total darkness
[27:46] because he went to the mark of the beast
[27:48] and out of the presence of
[27:51] God turning down the
[27:54] word okay see think about these things
[27:57] but what we're wanting to do is more
[27:59] relate to
[28:02] now not just talk about what Cain was
[28:06] you know or even speak about
[28:09] Abel but to speak about you and
[28:12] I to see where we're at because to
[28:15] preach about Cain or preach about Abel
[28:17] is not the point we'll get that when we
[28:20] get to it of even like uh another
[28:24] message on over of Noah or or Enoch
[28:28] I believe Enoch
[28:30] believed Abel's
[28:32] Revelation he didn't believe
[28:36] Cain's he believed Abel's Revelation but
[28:39] you know that still didn't do anything
[28:40] for him God had to speak to Enoch
[28:45] himself and you know to get it right and
[28:48] see we think we know a lot and we want
[28:49] to argue points I'll say this about the
[28:52] message when we get to Enoch about it
[28:54] you got better go read your Bible the
[28:57] first Enoch in the Bible is a direct
[28:59] descendant of
[29:05] Cain you better go read your Bible the
[29:08] Enoch you want to talk
[29:10] about has to come over on the other
[29:12] lineage in the fifth chapter I think it
[29:15] is maybe sixth chapter right in there
[29:18] all right see we get those names and we
[29:21] think we know somebody' say well what
[29:23] you talking about Enoch he come from
[29:25] Cain no he didn't come the one about
[29:28] and walking off the Earth didn't come
[29:29] from kan's lineage because he had
[29:32] nothing to walk on all right but now
[29:36] we're talking about a positive
[29:39] attitude for you and I to
[29:42] have because the only way they amounted
[29:45] to anything was for their attitude to be
[29:49] right and their wording to be right all
[29:53] right but we covered as I said this
[29:54] morning then about Abel
[29:58] he had a
[30:01] revelation about what happened in the
[30:04] garden because he come out with the
[30:06] Revelation that he must offer
[30:09] blood well wouldn't that be sensible let
[30:12] alone speaking natural I mean look like
[30:16] natural I mean you walk out of the
[30:18] garden and God drives them out of the
[30:21] garden and kills the animals and put
[30:23] skins on them it looked like anybody
[30:25] would have known the way back in has got
[30:27] to be connected to an animal
[30:30] sacrifice and it was a lamb that was you
[30:34] know taken not a bar elephant
[30:40] monkey it was a
[30:42] lamb well
[30:46] Abel he began to ponder these things and
[30:48] God spoke to him and told him what to
[30:54] offer all right
[31:00] Revelation all right so by Faith by
[31:06] Revelation Abel offered to
[31:08] God a more excellent
[31:12] sacrifice right you remember that this
[31:14] morning Abel offered a sacrifice Cain
[31:17] offered an appeasement trying to appease
[31:20] God so what are we trying to
[31:22] do well we want to we want the the blood
[31:26] out of the song books
[31:28] we don't want to talk about the blood
[31:30] scare the kids you know all right so
[31:35] looks like it's sitting in the same
[31:38] shape all right now did you you did you
[31:42] follow the point then Able by
[31:47] Revelation by
[31:49] faith that God had spoken to the heart
[31:53] of Abel
[31:56] soul soul of
[31:58] Abel and Abel got the revelation of what
[32:02] had taken
[32:05] place now I I can give you these quotes
[32:08] if you like them as we go along sometime
[32:11] brother randam says that I was looking
[32:13] at it this morning and he says that Abel
[32:18] actually saw the seed of the
[32:21] woman which the seat of the woman is
[32:23] Genesis 3:15 you know I'll put imity
[32:26] between th seed seed of the woman he
[32:28] said he saw the seed of the
[32:31] woman all right now get my
[32:34] point he might not have been looking at
[32:37] the seed of the woman like we
[32:40] think but anything that was speaking
[32:43] when the blood was offered by God
[32:46] himself of the animals it would be
[32:49] speaking of the coming of that seed of
[32:52] the woman or the coming of Christ
[32:56] right
[32:57] so then when brother Brandon would speak
[32:59] and say he saw that you know well we
[33:04] need to consider that he saw that so
[33:07] what did he see he saw a
[33:11] revelation that Revelation he saw would
[33:14] eventually stand on
[33:16] Earth in the person of Jesus
[33:20] Christ now what would Cain's Revelation
[33:25] bring
[33:30] right a world full of people that
[33:34] are
[33:36] religious that are spending their lives
[33:41] working giving their
[33:44] money doing all the the things to try to
[33:48] promote
[33:52] Christianity but it's like I told you
[33:54] and I knew that see cuz I always pay
[33:56] paid attention I knew when I was in the
[33:59] Baptist Church and that was
[34:04] 1958 when I joined the Baptist
[34:07] Church I knew then that we were sending
[34:10] money by the Baptist Association was
[34:12] sending money to incite rights in
[34:14] foreign
[34:18] countries and the reason was if we can
[34:21] get that Country open we can send our
[34:23] literature
[34:24] in oh it's a good point not a bad thing
[34:30] see but to think about
[34:33] it Abel had a revelation brother brand
[34:38] says by Faith by
[34:41] Revelation he said Abel
[34:44] offered the
[34:46] lamb all right now then offering that
[34:52] lamb would be speaking of the coming
[34:55] Messiah right
[34:59] he offered to lamb speaking of the
[35:01] coming Messiah you'll see that each one
[35:03] of
[35:03] these Warriors or people we talk about
[35:07] giving their report they're all going to
[35:10] report about a coming
[35:13] Messiah all right if you miss everything
[35:16] I'm talking about just remember that all
[35:19] of them back there spent their lives
[35:22] speaking as an example a
[35:25] type
[35:27] we get around to Noah and Enoch and
[35:29] thinking about
[35:30] it see we want to take the opposite it's
[35:34] always man's way of doing it Enoch
[35:37] represented Rapture Noah represented the
[35:42] bad bad
[35:46] what that's the way our minds
[35:50] go that Noah is not the
[35:55] bride but without Noah Israel wouldn't
[35:59] come
[36:06] in you see we think we got it all
[36:09] figured
[36:10] out and we're facing something that
[36:17] we say to God this is the way I believe
[36:20] it take it or leave
[36:24] it is that the way we're doing
[36:28] okay to Able by
[36:31] Revelation by a revelation from
[36:34] God about the coming
[36:37] Messiah offered the lamb
[36:41] sacrifice that's why I ended up talking
[36:46] about will our
[36:50] Revelation produce a
[36:55] lamb we don't have to produce it God's
[36:58] already done it oh you're so
[37:04] wonderful will your Revelation speak of
[37:08] the atonement of
[37:15] Calvary could you take your
[37:18] Revelation how many times have I asked
[37:20] this question could you take your
[37:22] Revelation and go to Israel and see them
[37:25] converted
[37:29] no we know the two witnesses going to do
[37:31] that well you know what they going to
[37:33] take this
[37:37] message Abel didn't see everything but
[37:41] what he saw spoke of the coming
[37:46] Messiah do you speak of the coming
[37:52] Messiah that's my point this
[37:55] morning
[37:58] and if you do speak of the coming
[38:08] Messiah can your Revelation
[38:15] speak I ain't talking about babbling
[38:17] with words you know that right I'm
[38:22] talking
[38:24] about could I take you
[38:31] can I take you you take me whatever it
[38:35] is and go over here and talk to these
[38:39] people in this church
[38:42] across way
[38:45] here and could I take your life and talk
[38:47] about Jesus
[38:50] Christ now I'm not talking about your
[38:52] goody goodies I go over there oh brother
[38:55] so old s they was just the best person
[38:58] there was a good
[39:00] person which would convert the
[39:05] People by you being so
[39:09] good or would it be that you were so
[39:12] bad and you got converted to
[39:16] good which would be the Revelation that
[39:19] would bring the people to Jesus
[39:24] Christ they know the stories about being
[39:29] good but do they know the revelation of
[39:32] Jesus
[39:34] Christ you know Abel see we could spend
[39:36] all we spend a year speaking on Abel I
[39:39] could right now because Abel saw one
[39:42] true and living
[39:46] God you said why he didn't see them you
[39:50] tell me what he
[39:54] saw he sure had an opportunity to talk
[39:57] to
[39:58] him and once he even was
[40:04] killed his voice was not
[40:13] stopped
[40:16] right come on cuz that's the point we're
[40:18] just moving up into because what did it
[40:21] say
[40:22] now by faith
[40:25] revelation
[40:27] Abel offered unto
[40:30] God a more excellent sacrifice than
[40:33] Cain
[40:36] now the prophet said it like this one
[40:38] day he
[40:41] said would your
[40:44] Revelation you know paraphrasing it
[40:47] bring God to the
[40:55] people
[40:57] would your Revelation bring God to the
[41:01] people you know that we are supposed to
[41:04] be able to take back may I quote this
[41:06] one we're supposed to be able to take
[41:08] back to God what we see him to
[41:13] be
[41:16] right and we're supposed to take what we
[41:19] see him to be to the people that we're
[41:22] talking
[41:25] to
[41:29] right that's why I don't start out
[41:31] talking to a new person you know about
[41:34] the seals of plagues of thunders of vows
[41:36] of serpent seed the no Eternal Hils and
[41:39] all of the
[41:41] things I start talking to him about one
[41:45] God and about three or four months later
[41:47] asked brother dick how long it took that
[41:49] I finally got to talking to him about
[41:53] what
[41:55] baptism
[41:57] because it's a pretty good way to trap
[41:59] somebody to get them off of their
[42:01] Trinity and to get them down till they
[42:03] say okay it's three
[42:06] manifestations that's a better way of
[42:08] saying it than
[42:09] Trinity
[42:11] okay now let's see if you believe
[42:15] it if that's true now that there's just
[42:18] one God manifested in three
[42:22] offices then they can't be father son
[42:24] Holy Ghost as a baptism
[42:29] right we see we want to take the great
[42:32] big
[42:34] things you know
[42:37] why we want to make it look like we know
[42:41] something right we want to be something
[42:46] big
[42:48] right
[42:51] okay I'm going to try for a while
[42:55] to revert back to an old Ministry that I
[42:58] once had and I've been aiming to for a
[43:01] while and I saw it reverting back this
[43:03] morning to where I'm going to stop
[43:05] reading so much I'm do a lot of quoting
[43:07] but stop reading so much now if you ever
[43:10] want to know where I got it at you just
[43:11] raise your hand CU I'll try my best to
[43:15] give you the quote some quotes we will
[43:17] select and read but I just want to
[43:20] preach to you to talk to you a
[43:24] little what about your
[43:28] Revelation does it compare to Abel's
[43:38] Revelation simple
[43:42] question see then you can't
[43:45] take two Lords Two Souls seven under
[43:48] virtues Prov his you know River Jordans
[43:52] none of that will compare with Abel's
[43:55] revelation
[44:03] so if it don't compar to Abel's
[44:05] Revelation it must be off of the tree of
[44:07] knowledge of Good and
[44:10] Evil where Cain got hears
[44:17] from are you with
[44:19] me all right so will your Revelation
[44:25] speak
[44:27] because according to what we read here
[44:29] about
[44:31] Abel he not only
[44:34] offered the right
[44:40] sacrifice and by
[44:43] that listen by which he obtained
[44:47] witness that he was
[44:54] righteous
[44:58] you know what righteous
[45:00] is have you ever just looked up
[45:02] righteous righteousness and the
[45:07] things it's the actor state of being
[45:12] right you know what that simple
[45:16] enough righteousness
[45:19] right righteous is simply simply a
[45:23] state of being right
[45:26] now you give me another definition for
[45:28] that oh righteousness brother Dale is
[45:31] where you're so you're just so high
[45:34] you're so grayed
[45:37] up I don't you just bring it back down
[45:40] to human terms and say the fact of being
[45:43] right all right so to Abel what does it
[45:47] say by which he obtained
[45:49] witness that he was
[45:54] right able offered unto God a more
[45:57] excellent sacrifice in
[46:02] cane and by doing
[46:06] that it proved he was
[46:09] right you know what proved he was right
[46:12] God accepted the
[46:15] sacrifice
[46:17] right rejected Ables right now let me
[46:22] put it a little closer he accepted I
[46:24] mean he that came he accepted Abel's
[46:29] Revelation and rejected Cain's
[46:32] Revelation
[46:36] okay and by doing that he proved able to
[46:40] be
[46:45] righteous he proved able to be right
[46:49] that's what got Cain all stirred
[46:52] up is when he done all of his works and
[46:57] God said may I quote later on in the
[47:00] scripture I've done this I've done that
[47:03] I've worked this but depart from me
[47:06] because I never knew
[47:10] you is that the word of the
[47:14] Lord all
[47:17] right so we obtain
[47:20] witness you remember now what we were in
[47:23] the
[47:24] message
[47:27] to be a
[47:28] witness you have to have a substance you
[47:31] remember
[47:32] that you remember the prophet to be a
[47:34] witness you got to be a substance CU you
[47:36] can't go to court and witness something
[47:38] what somebody else saying you got to be
[47:40] personal witness you remember that all
[47:42] right you see we're still in the message
[47:44] we're on all
[47:49] right
[47:51] God
[47:54] testifying to his
[47:59] gifts there
[48:02] plural they wouldn't speak in in tongue
[48:04] shouting Glory
[48:08] Hallelujah right that's all we talk
[48:11] about
[48:12] gifts you know there's nine spiritual
[48:15] gifts and you know there's a gift of
[48:17] wisdom there's a gift of
[48:22] knowledge because is he simply saying
[48:24] that God
[48:27] testified now
[48:29] listen God testifying of his knowledge
[48:33] that he had being right his discernment
[48:37] he
[48:38] had his
[48:42] gifts it wasn't something he was passing
[48:45] out he was testifying to the fact of
[48:48] what he had within
[48:51] him as
[48:54] gifts
[48:57] and by doing that he offered to right
[48:59] gift right the
[49:03] lamb all
[49:09] right and
[49:11] he and by
[49:16] it he being
[49:18] dead yet
[49:22] speaketh all right you go back over in
[49:24] Genesis 4
[49:26] and about
[49:27] 10 and you'll find that God is
[49:31] conferring with
[49:34] Cain and God says to
[49:37] Cain where's
[49:40] Abel well of course big righteous
[49:44] guy am I My Brother's
[49:48] Keeper why don't you go
[49:54] hunting and God says
[49:59] Cain he said your brother's
[50:03] blood is crying out to
[50:06] me from the
[50:14] ground
[50:16] now blood can't
[50:19] cry that's
[50:22] chemistry if you need these raise your
[50:24] hand we glad to read them off blood
[50:27] can't
[50:29] cry but it says the blood
[50:33] speak we get an opportunity we get far
[50:35] enough over until we'll talk about the
[50:38] blood of Jesus
[50:40] Christ how it speaks better
[50:47] thing what is the Bible talking about
[50:50] when he says your blood his blood is
[50:53] crying out to me
[51:02] now are we silly and stupid enough to
[51:05] think that AEL was down under the ground
[51:07] saying Lord he killed
[51:10] me hear my words
[51:15] Lord not that dumb I
[51:19] hope what does it
[51:22] mean his blood is chist crying
[51:28] out under
[51:33] me let's look at number five on our
[51:35] notes of brother randam and this
[51:37] there'll be some of these things we will
[51:38] give and we'll use them
[51:41] periodically but I want to give you this
[51:43] one because if I quote this one and you
[51:45] go and and don't pay close attention you
[51:48] will totally Miss what he's
[51:50] saying since he taken from the token
[51:53] 1964 to0 8 which is preached in
[51:56] Bakersville
[51:58] California paragraph
[52:00] 127 listen now he actually says it so if
[52:04] you blot this out look what brother BR
[52:07] well I can't blot it out I'm block that
[52:09] way the soul that was in cane cried
[52:19] out I just told you what the prophet
[52:21] said he said the soul of Cain cried
[52:24] out
[52:25] okay but what it are in
[52:31] able so now he's saying the soul of Abel
[52:36] right the soul of Abel cried
[52:43] out it was the
[52:46] life that was in
[52:52] Christ he's talk about
[52:54] able it was the life that was in Christ
[52:58] that cries out better things than any it
[53:02] speaks and it speaks loud it's the holy
[53:07] spirit all
[53:10] right so Abel's
[53:14] Soul cried
[53:18] out at this specific
[53:23] point you don't even have it mentioned
[53:25] until comes later NE bosom of Abraham to
[53:27] be that but we know that Abel's Soul was
[53:31] in what would be known as
[53:34] Paradise
[53:36] right am I
[53:38] right if you ain't awake holler yeah
[53:42] wake
[53:43] up because I'm trying to make some good
[53:45] points
[53:48] okay so now we read that God
[53:53] said he
[53:56] voice is
[53:58] crying from the
[54:04] earth do we know it's not the chemistry
[54:06] of the blood
[54:09] speaking but where was
[54:15] Paradise as I said we going later come
[54:17] on case anybody get smally about it I
[54:20] know what it is in scripturally that
[54:22] paradise in the Old Testament was
[54:23] basically the bosom of Abraham which
[54:25] don't mean the belly of Abraham it meant
[54:28] Abraham's
[54:30] Faith
[54:32] right but we look and think
[54:35] about Abel being in Paradise so he's in
[54:40] another
[54:43] dimension and we talk about how that
[54:46] Jesus died and went to
[54:49] paradise and the prophet says
[54:53] down right
[54:56] are you with me I'm trying to establish
[54:59] why the Bible says it he said it cried
[55:01] out of the earth there out of paradise
[55:04] spoke
[55:10] Abel it was his
[55:13] soul his soul was in
[55:17] Paradise I don't think it's the heart of
[55:20] the Earth come
[55:21] on but just the point that it's downward
[55:26] and Jesus had to go there to bring them
[55:31] out and then is odd when we get over to
[55:34] Abraham how that when God goes there and
[55:38] knocks on the door that Abraham says
[55:40] Sarah here is the man we F fed the cave
[55:44] to
[55:46] okay in
[55:48] Paradise all right so it was a soul that
[55:52] was in AEL that cried out
[55:57] all right now let's get it a little
[56:00] closer it was the
[56:03] revelation of Abel that God was
[56:06] listening
[56:09] to
[56:13] right and not to hear voices you have to
[56:15] hear this or that or the other not down
[56:17] in the ground looking up and crying out
[56:19] and blood speaking and what does it
[56:23] mean
[56:27] and when it says that his the blood of
[56:30] Jesus Christ speaketh better
[56:34] things let's just read a few things
[56:36] brother brandham says about this and
[56:39] let's think about it go ahead to number
[56:42] six which is from the
[56:43] token this is in uh
[56:49] sort Paul tells us talking about
[56:52] speaking of blood Paul tells us that the
[56:55] blood
[56:56] speaks you believe the blood
[56:58] speaks in Genesis 4 1 R
[57:02] 410 God told told Cain he said where's
[57:05] your brother he said his blood his his
[57:10] voice the blood of his
[57:13] voice of his blood's calls against out
[57:17] against
[57:23] you
[57:27] it was Abel's Revelation that God was
[57:32] hearing he didn't have to tell him Cain
[57:34] killed him God knew all about the whole
[57:35] story
[57:37] right listen to what he's
[57:42] saying so he goes on to tell us what
[57:45] then the blood has got a
[57:50] voice and the blood's got a voice now
[57:53] listen and and the voice of the
[57:56] blood is the
[58:01] word now are you getting it together
[58:04] about the
[58:05] Revelation that the faith of Abel the
[58:08] revelation of Abel is what God is
[58:11] hearing from because it's
[58:13] what saved Abel in
[58:17] himself was the Revelation he had and
[58:20] God honored that listen and that's what
[58:23] makes it better it's right or wrong the
[58:26] word is identified by the voice of the
[58:28] blood the voice of the blood is the Holy
[58:32] Ghost now we getting some
[58:35] more the voice of the blood is the holy
[58:37] ghost that brings life and it's life and
[58:39] it brings life to the word and quickens
[58:42] it amen amen sure the blood speaks it
[58:46] speaks a better
[58:49] thing the Old Testament the blood spoke
[58:52] of
[58:53] guilt
[58:57] in the New Testament it speaks of
[59:02] redemption you some are getting sleepy
[59:05] again Shake Yourself ha
[59:12] high in the Old Testament it spoke of
[59:14] death and
[59:16] sorrow in the New Testament it speaks of
[59:19] resurrection and life speaks of healing
[59:22] speaks of Joy speaks of Heaven
[59:27] he called out after his dead brother or
[59:30] it called out after his brother that had
[59:32] killed him the blood of Jesus Christ
[59:36] covers all right now just the point you
[59:40] don't get N Out of the message today get
[59:42] this Blood don't
[59:45] speak not listening to words coming out
[59:47] of the ground not doing those things it
[59:51] was Abel's
[59:53] revelation
[59:55] Abel's Revelation is what got him
[1:00:02] killed and God
[1:00:07] honored and accepted his
[1:00:11] sacrifice
[1:00:13] now it placed Abel in a
[1:00:17] position that we would call
[1:00:23] Paradise he made a way a place for him
[1:00:26] to
[1:00:28] stay Cain had one too but it wasn't the
[1:00:31] same
[1:00:35] place there's no mention of Cain being
[1:00:37] able to cry out so brother R said the
[1:00:42] soul of Abel cried
[1:00:47] out the soul of AEL was in
[1:00:53] Paradise calling out to
[1:00:58] God and saying
[1:01:01] God I stood for
[1:01:04] you I made the offering that you
[1:01:07] revealed to me was to be
[1:01:13] made I said now I done all I could do
[1:01:17] speaking of the coming of the
[1:01:19] Messiah so now you come on the
[1:01:23] scene
[1:01:25] by my
[1:01:29] Revelation I'm trying my best to make
[1:01:32] A's Revelation as personal as I
[1:01:35] can
[1:01:37] right CU remember only those that had
[1:01:40] this personal contact or personal was
[1:01:43] the only ones that had a positive
[1:01:44] attitude and the only ones that God was
[1:01:47] concerned
[1:01:51] with the blood of Jesus Christ speaketh
[1:01:54] better
[1:01:56] things it speaks
[1:02:01] Redemption speak
[1:02:03] salvation and all of that that Abel had
[1:02:07] was a part of that
[1:02:10] Revelation you
[1:02:13] know right Enoch will'll find had
[1:02:16] another part of
[1:02:18] it we'll find Noah had another part of
[1:02:21] it we'll find Abraham at a big
[1:02:27] chunk
[1:02:31] right but the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:02:35] speaks see that's why Paul
[1:02:39] said Hebrews
[1:02:41] 12 he's laying it down that Moses is up
[1:02:45] at the mountain and they hear the voices
[1:02:47] and the Thunders and the
[1:02:50] th and he
[1:02:53] says
[1:02:55] but we're not come to
[1:02:59] that that was Mount
[1:03:02] Shi he said we're not come to
[1:03:06] that Paul said we're come to Mount
[1:03:10] Zion the city of the Living
[1:03:17] God do an innumerable company of
[1:03:23] angels
[1:03:25] to the
[1:03:26] firstborn who's the
[1:03:29] firstborn
[1:03:32] Christ we've come to where that the
[1:03:36] blood of this one speaks greater
[1:03:41] things Abel could only speak of
[1:03:44] Salvation to
[1:03:46] come Jesus doesn't speak of Salvation to
[1:03:49] come he spoke of Salvation being
[1:03:53] present but you just think we're
[1:03:56] compassed about by an innumerable
[1:03:59] company of
[1:04:00] angels like I've always heard him say
[1:04:02] they say you say well you don't like it
[1:04:05] ca he got empty pews that there's an
[1:04:07] angel sitting in need one of
[1:04:09] them no the less people's here there
[1:04:11] more angels can be
[1:04:18] here
[1:04:21] okay but think about it
[1:04:28] when Jesus Christ died at
[1:04:33] Calvary
[1:04:35] right did that stop his
[1:04:46] voice it might a way that it could be in
[1:04:49] many many
[1:04:52] people it spread the
[1:04:57] gospel you know then after 2,000
[1:05:02] years his
[1:05:06] soul is still
[1:05:11] speaking his life his being is still
[1:05:19] talking he speaking
[1:05:23] Redemption
[1:05:26] it says we're even coming to the city of
[1:05:28] the Living
[1:05:32] God the city of the Living God is
[1:05:37] Jerusalem but not the natural
[1:05:40] city right it's the future
[1:05:46] home what about
[1:05:48] innumerable innumerable every how you
[1:05:51] say that word without Crossing
[1:05:53] it company of
[1:05:56] angels that at one time was trying to
[1:05:59] keep people from getting
[1:06:01] to the Garden of Eden is now trying to
[1:06:06] get us into the Garden of
[1:06:13] Eden you see what I'm talking
[1:06:16] about so then what was God hearing
[1:06:19] crying
[1:06:21] out Abel's voice
[1:06:25] that was in which his soul his being
[1:06:29] that was in
[1:06:32] paradise and he was crying out for
[1:06:36] Redemption
[1:06:39] right Lord you got it started now you
[1:06:43] got to get me out of here cuz my body's
[1:06:45] up there Abel just took a cane just took
[1:06:48] care of that old garbage can put it in
[1:06:50] the
[1:06:52] ground I got to have a way to get out of
[1:06:54] here and somewhere to
[1:06:57] go when I get
[1:07:01] out and he says just hang on a
[1:07:05] while a way will be
[1:07:08] made I hear your voice I hear your
[1:07:14] Revelation you see Church you don't like
[1:07:16] it when I say a lot of things but is
[1:07:19] this the best way I know to say
[1:07:22] it
[1:07:25] Abel never had no revelation of a
[1:07:33] trinity let me say it in the backward
[1:07:35] reverse way a trinity speaks of a of an
[1:07:39] eternal
[1:07:42] hell now did you get that I'm going
[1:07:44] backwards okay Trinity speaks of an
[1:07:46] eternal hell because that's their
[1:07:49] Doctrine that's the scare
[1:07:51] tactics right the one true in God speaks
[1:07:55] that there is no eternal
[1:08:00] hell what kind of Revelation you
[1:08:04] got if you passed
[1:08:12] on is it
[1:08:14] possible
[1:08:17] that your voice could
[1:08:21] speak now let me say it this way
[1:08:26] but I just got it
[1:08:29] okay Jesus's
[1:08:32] voice was not there to
[1:08:37] speak he moved into another form called
[1:08:40] a
[1:08:41] bride and spoke through them and they
[1:08:44] became his voice but it wasn't his
[1:08:47] physical voice are you with
[1:08:52] me on the dep Pentecost it became in The
[1:08:56] Bride of Jesus
[1:08:57] Christ they became the voice of
[1:09:03] God they become the way God would
[1:09:07] speak brother Randon made it Point like
[1:09:10] this one day he said and if you hear
[1:09:12] anything things in adoption he said you
[1:09:15] going to listen to
[1:09:18] them is that a paraphrase but close oh
[1:09:22] you hear from God today where you going
[1:09:24] to hear from
[1:09:26] him goes let me go on now you're going
[1:09:29] to drop some of you going to drop your
[1:09:33] lip when brother Randon passed
[1:09:36] on now you listen to what I'm saying all
[1:09:41] right when brother R passed on his voice
[1:09:45] no longer is
[1:09:46] speaking you said but we got to taste
[1:09:49] got listen a
[1:09:52] minute
[1:09:55] they recorded what Jesus
[1:09:58] said but his physical voice was not D
[1:10:02] they became his
[1:10:06] voice
[1:10:08] right so we can quote brother random
[1:10:11] quote brother
[1:10:12] random may I give you an example it's in
[1:10:15] the
[1:10:17] Bible I adure Thee in the
[1:10:20] name of the Jesus Paul
[1:10:26] preaches that in the Bible the man said
[1:10:29] Jesus I know and Paul I know I don't
[1:10:33] know nothing about you you know what no
[1:10:37] Revelation no
[1:10:40] voice all
[1:10:42] right if you put that same insane man in
[1:10:46] front of Paul and what would have
[1:10:52] happened
[1:10:55] he wouldn't have said
[1:10:57] that the brother random has died and
[1:11:00] gone on we thank God we wouldn't have
[1:11:03] nothing to stand on right but I'm not
[1:11:05] standing on his
[1:11:08] voice oh brother D it says in the days
[1:11:11] of the voice I would advise you to go
[1:11:13] back a little bit in the message and
[1:11:15] listen what I've been saying his voic is
[1:11:17] his
[1:11:21] Revelation brother rand's natural
[1:11:25] voice said the white horse
[1:11:30] rider was the Holy
[1:11:36] Ghost am I
[1:11:40] right but then when he was
[1:11:43] corrected his voice said the white horse
[1:11:46] rider is the
[1:11:49] Antichrist so now are you just dealing
[1:11:51] with the voice of are the
[1:11:55] Revelation remember Abel's Revelation is
[1:11:59] what God
[1:12:01] heard Cain had an opportunity to hear it
[1:12:06] and a verification from God that it was
[1:12:10] right a personal
[1:12:14] contact with Cain to tell him it Abel's
[1:12:18] right and what he can't
[1:12:21] do bless God you can't tell me right no
[1:12:25] you
[1:12:29] can't you can't tell
[1:12:36] people you can quote all you want to the
[1:12:38] Bible you quote all you want to about
[1:12:40] brother brandom and may I make another
[1:12:44] statement that he says as long as this
[1:12:47] message is laying in books and tapes
[1:12:52] right it can be questioned
[1:12:55] right is that a
[1:12:59] quote but he said once It's Made Alive
[1:13:02] it can't be
[1:13:04] questioned if I die today and go on you
[1:13:08] know what a lot of you will
[1:13:10] do let's get together and play brother
[1:13:13] Dale's
[1:13:14] tapes we'll go back to the 60s and we'll
[1:13:17] start over because we missed
[1:13:20] it we need to know what he said
[1:13:24] that won't honor me one
[1:13:31] bit there won't be no shouting in heaven
[1:13:34] out of me about
[1:13:36] that but if
[1:13:38] somebody stands up and
[1:13:41] says by what the man has preached I now
[1:13:46] see Jesus
[1:13:49] myself heaven will be rejoicing and so
[1:13:52] will I
[1:13:54] why because the blood
[1:13:59] speaks and brother brandom's Revelation
[1:14:02] is what I'm talking about not his
[1:14:07] wordings the Revelation that he had of
[1:14:11] the same God that Abel saw because it's
[1:14:13] by him we know what happened to Abel
[1:14:17] right oh we've heard great theological
[1:14:22] explanations but here was a man that
[1:14:24] could
[1:14:29] explain how the blood
[1:14:35] speaks but yet he himself be glad to
[1:14:38] read it to you he said chemistry can't
[1:14:44] speak here's a man that could explain
[1:14:47] the great mind of almighty
[1:14:52] God
[1:14:56] and how that he came down to
[1:15:02] mankind but do we have that
[1:15:05] Revelation or do we have it like some
[1:15:08] brother brandham right over here on the
[1:15:10] road used to be I don't know what
[1:15:11] they're doing now brother brandham just
[1:15:13] come and swep off the foundation now we
[1:15:16] got to do the
[1:15:22] building
[1:15:23] they quote scripture Foundation Apostle
[1:15:26] Prophet Jesus Christ being a Chief
[1:15:27] Cornerstone I said before you start
[1:15:29] would you mind telling me something it
[1:15:32] was in my home I had a right to
[1:15:35] talk I said you got say you go beyond
[1:15:37] brother brand and go on out yeah brother
[1:15:39] random just swept off the foundation we
[1:15:41] got to do these things sounds beautiful
[1:15:44] because we believe this statue of
[1:15:46] perfect man is to be brought into being
[1:15:48] by the preaching of the ministry in the
[1:15:50] last
[1:15:52] days but I said all right you go beyond
[1:15:55] brother
[1:15:57] Brandon
[1:15:59] yeah I
[1:16:00] said tell me what he
[1:16:06] taught oh I'm mad arrogant hateful old
[1:16:10] dude a got a right to be I'm 74 Reagan
[1:16:13] had a right to be able to not
[1:16:21] remember but I said tell me what taught
[1:16:23] on the seventh
[1:16:25] seal and this is his
[1:16:28] wording he said you are the teacher you
[1:16:31] tell me what he said I said oh
[1:16:34] no oh
[1:16:35] no you've went beyond brother
[1:16:39] Brandon you tell me what he
[1:16:42] said I said you can't even tell me what
[1:16:45] he's already
[1:16:49] said of course he left the house CU he
[1:16:52] didn't didn't come after me to talk to
[1:16:54] him he come out there wanting to borrow
[1:16:56] about $30,000 to buy a
[1:17:00] house
[1:17:02] and he said you can just write me a
[1:17:04] check I said how many you
[1:17:07] want I said I'll write you all a checks
[1:17:09] you won't you going to have problem with
[1:17:11] the
[1:17:14] bank
[1:17:15] okay but listen
[1:17:19] folks see people can argue quotes
[1:17:24] but you can't argue
[1:17:29] Revelation there's no way to argue
[1:17:32] Revelation but you can argue quotes with
[1:17:37] people Abel had a
[1:17:41] revelation by having that Revelation
[1:17:44] from God
[1:17:46] that it was
[1:17:49] blood and that that would speak of the
[1:17:51] coming of the Messiah
[1:17:55] and that he would see the seed of the
[1:17:57] woman which would come
[1:18:00] forth right and when he passed
[1:18:06] on
[1:18:09] right God could hear him in
[1:18:15] Paradise his soul was speaking
[1:18:19] out not mad at Cain
[1:18:26] right
[1:18:29] right I I don't think those people had
[1:18:32] that
[1:18:33] idea I think that we're supposed to be
[1:18:35] able to say father forgive them they
[1:18:40] don't know what they're
[1:18:42] doing I believe Cain Abel was saying
[1:18:46] father
[1:18:48] happy he's killed
[1:18:51] me
[1:18:55] it's hard to think about that Cain could
[1:18:56] have been saved after he
[1:19:00] killed
[1:19:02] able that's hard for us to
[1:19:05] comprehend and we think he' done gone
[1:19:07] too
[1:19:13] far but his problem was was a little
[1:19:15] later if you'll read you'll find it
[1:19:18] saying that Cain went out from the
[1:19:21] presence of the Lord
[1:19:25] there's where his problem
[1:19:27] was the mark of the beast was not a
[1:19:30] Blackness put on
[1:19:32] him it was an unbelief point that
[1:19:36] culminated in him walking out of
[1:19:38] anywhere close to the garden and he goes
[1:19:41] over to the Land of
[1:19:43] Nod I think that's try to go
[1:19:50] somewhere but I'm simply asking asking a
[1:19:53] question that's why I like to talk to
[1:19:55] you I like for you to tell me what you
[1:20:03] see and I mean we Dicker Dicker pet p a
[1:20:06] little bit on
[1:20:07] wording you
[1:20:12] know but you tell me you see three gods
[1:20:15] and I tell you I see one they ain't no
[1:20:17] Dilly dating about
[1:20:19] that that's got a problem
[1:20:26] right do you understand what it means
[1:20:28] that his
[1:20:29] blood was crying
[1:20:32] out and even though Jesus
[1:20:35] Christ came and
[1:20:38] died Satan ought have left him alone his
[1:20:41] brother Harris used to say there was a
[1:20:42] good point he ought have left him alone
[1:20:44] he only had one but he said he had 120
[1:20:49] the next whack and 3,000 the next time
[1:20:53] that's 3120 little jesuses he ought have
[1:20:57] left him
[1:20:59] alone Hallelujah now he's got all of
[1:21:02] those to face their
[1:21:04] Witnesses see then I can preach Luther's
[1:21:07] just shall live by faith I can preach
[1:21:10] Wesley's
[1:21:11] sanctification I can preach the
[1:21:13] Pentecostal baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:16] and I can preach the word coming to the
[1:21:19] prophet to be able to be manifested into
[1:21:21] a bride of Jes Jesus Christ but I can
[1:21:24] also preach it in the days of Luther
[1:21:26] that the Catholic Church wasn't upset
[1:21:28] with Luther that much it was when the
[1:21:31] people begin to say what Luther said
[1:21:34] they got upset
[1:21:37] then no is it been an Ever
[1:21:42] age you see I can take what I believe
[1:21:44] and go all the way back to the
[1:21:48] garden and say I know it was the blood
[1:21:56] and even though Jesus had to
[1:21:58] die his blood just keeps on
[1:22:02] speaking brother random come to where
[1:22:05] that the word could be brought in the
[1:22:06] end
[1:22:08] time and even though he passed
[1:22:15] on his
[1:22:18] Revelation is still speaking
[1:22:21] right
[1:22:24] not just letters on the page cuz they
[1:22:26] can confuse you that's right right did
[1:22:30] you understand what I said while ago R
[1:22:32] said one day you say the voice that
[1:22:36] voice said to white horse rider was the
[1:22:38] Holy
[1:22:40] Ghost that was not a
[1:22:47] revelation but then when he saw it he
[1:22:49] said the white horse rider is the an
[1:22:53] Christ now he's got the Revelation
[1:22:56] that's right and what did he say on the
[1:22:58] first seal he said if God hadn't to come
[1:23:01] to me I was fixing to speak on things
[1:23:04] that I had written down from former
[1:23:06] messages and he said I'd have made a
[1:23:08] horrible
[1:23:12] mistake what he
[1:23:15] said he walks out that day and he
[1:23:19] says now I see why e was confused in the
[1:23:23] garden over Hebrews
[1:23:26] 13:8 and said now I
[1:23:31] see that Hebrews 13:8 is
[1:23:34] right do we have the
[1:23:36] Revelation that the prophet spoke of or
[1:23:39] do we just have the letters on the
[1:23:45] page well brother Dale my problem is
[1:23:48] that every one of these doctrines that
[1:23:50] you call the names of they every one
[1:23:51] claim
[1:23:54] that brother Brandon was a
[1:23:57] prophet well if you ever hear me come up
[1:24:00] with something the first thing I'm going
[1:24:01] to come up with that brother Brandon
[1:24:03] wasn't a
[1:24:04] prophet if I'm going to come up with
[1:24:06] some idea of my
[1:24:08] own
[1:24:10] right and then you'll know right real
[1:24:12] quick I'm saying I'm
[1:24:14] him
[1:24:17] right brother Randon what did he say he
[1:24:20] said I'll be glad when they look him in
[1:24:22] the eyes like they said to Paul he said
[1:24:25] they looked to him in the eye and said
[1:24:26] Paul didn't teach that he said I'll be
[1:24:29] glad that the day comes the people will
[1:24:32] say you never T
[1:24:35] that of course everybody's love you
[1:24:38] to don't you think they have a right to
[1:24:40] believe
[1:24:42] it Constitution wise
[1:24:45] yeah Bible wise
[1:24:49] no right come on there's only one Faith
[1:24:54] one Lord one
[1:24:57] baptism one Revelation that's got to tie
[1:25:00] all the way back and be the same
[1:25:03] Revelation that Abel walked out and
[1:25:07] believe because it listen this is my
[1:25:08] last statement because that Revelation
[1:25:12] is the only one that can
[1:25:16] speak Jesus had that Revelation because
[1:25:19] he didn't just have it he was the
[1:25:20] Revelation and he could speak better
[1:25:27] things what was Abel's off Cain's

[1:26:29] that you better have the

[1:26:41] that we mean Doo guys get

[1:26:50] that on the internet and you knew knew

[1:27:08] see now you're chickening out all
[1:27:15] right you see for folks where we at
[1:27:18] because every day I'm right here on that
[1:27:21] little thing back there called an
[1:27:23] internet is preaching what I believe the
[1:27:26] Bible
[1:27:28] says and I want to know if I'm
[1:27:32] right but don't call me up and tell me
[1:27:36] the two Lord guys is
[1:27:38] right you know come on at least be
[1:27:41] gumption enough to come and sit
[1:27:45] down let's talk it
[1:27:51] over because you see I'll tell this
[1:27:54] story one more time we had a meeting
[1:27:57] with a great big man one
[1:28:00] time and we were to talk about marriage
[1:28:03] and
[1:28:05] divorce and we came to church here on
[1:28:07] Friday night CU we were leaving Saturday
[1:28:10] the old building little part up here all
[1:28:12] it
[1:28:14] was and they always wondered about where
[1:28:17] the scripture says that there in
[1:28:19] Deuteronomy 24 that if you know if a man
[1:28:22] put away his wife and said she may
[1:28:26] go marry
[1:28:28] another I'd always wondered on that and
[1:28:30] I knew in some way that maybe that would
[1:28:33] be the thing that would be brought
[1:28:35] up and I prayed seriously Lord I don't
[1:28:39] have no
[1:28:45] answer he dropped down into my heart and
[1:28:48] he
[1:28:49] said that's not giving her okay that's
[1:28:52] just saying she will do
[1:28:57] it thank you
[1:28:59] Lord went on up you know what quick as
[1:29:03] the big person got a right to ask the
[1:29:05] question that's what he
[1:29:09] asked one of his cohorts said it's even
[1:29:12] in the Bible that she can go be another
[1:29:15] man's wife I said were I was up
[1:29:18] speaking the man said Deuteronomy 24 oh
[1:29:22] boy I stred not like this it humbled
[1:29:29] me I all God let him go on I got the
[1:29:36] answer and everybody was just dead
[1:29:41] still cuz they didn't want to tackle
[1:29:43] that
[1:29:44] question and I simply turned around to
[1:29:46] him and I said th set the scholar th set
[1:29:50] the Theologian and he was B
[1:29:54] and I said you tell them which one's
[1:29:57] right
[1:29:58] brother I said that means that she will
[1:30:02] go do it not saying it's okay for her to
[1:30:05] do it because the next few verses says
[1:30:09] you can't go back and remarry her and if
[1:30:11] it she okay he could go back and remarry
[1:30:14] her I said the Bible answered his own s
[1:30:17] the man just sit there I said answer it
[1:30:20] brother
[1:30:22] is he
[1:30:24] right or is it what I said is
[1:30:27] right he wouldn't say a
[1:30:30] word it was one of his
[1:30:34] buddies I said brother at least move or
[1:30:38] do
[1:30:39] something and I said is that man right
[1:30:41] or am I right I said if I'm right at
[1:30:43] least you could shake your head and
[1:30:44] shook his head I said Let It Go tap that
[1:30:47] the man is agreeing with what I
[1:30:50] said cuz it would wasn't what I said it
[1:30:52] was a revelation from almighty
[1:30:55] God cuz the words right after then says
[1:30:58] that if she puts away by the second man
[1:31:00] he dies even why couldn't she go back to
[1:31:02] the first one it was okay you can't do
[1:31:05] it I said the Bible itself is
[1:31:11] self-explanatory you see folks I'm
[1:31:14] afraid of
[1:31:16] questions
[1:31:18] unless I know the
[1:31:20] answer
[1:31:24] another brother one time he said it this
[1:31:25] way he said I asked a question he said
[1:31:28] he got up behind me and he said I hate
[1:31:30] it when a man asks a question he's the
[1:31:32] only one in the building got the
[1:31:35] answer that's what he said I said
[1:31:38] brother I wouldn't asked a question if I
[1:31:40] didn't have the
[1:31:43] answer I
[1:31:45] wouldn't listen I believe God can still
[1:31:50] speak to you
[1:31:52] and tell you the right
[1:31:55] answer and it'll come and verify the
[1:31:59] word of God all the way
[1:32:01] back come on musician like sister Birds
[1:32:05] you remember her and I preached on he
[1:32:07] come from God and he went to God and I
[1:32:09] spent an hour and a half trying to
[1:32:11] explain that we was on the way home she
[1:32:13] said brother Dale I saw what you talking
[1:32:15] about I said you did she said
[1:32:19] yes she said he come from God he went to
[1:32:22] God said he was God all the
[1:32:25] time I said why didn't I Let You Preach
[1:32:29] that's what I said she had in just a
[1:32:31] minute's time the direct answer to the
[1:32:35] point did he come from God he went to
[1:32:38] God he just got all the time that was a
[1:32:40] simple-minded person with a revelation
[1:32:43] from God's
[1:32:45] word not according to
[1:32:49] education according to revelation
[1:32:55] and I thought we believe that his body
[1:32:58] was built on
[1:32:59] Revelation what do we got let's stand
[1:33:01] 107
[1:33:04] 107 think on these
[1:33:10] things could they take you the
[1:33:13] Revelation you have and go to
[1:33:16] Israel even though you had already
[1:33:18] passed
[1:33:20] on
[1:33:25] but would you say that I'm just saying
[1:33:28] what the prophet said because that's
[1:33:31] what the two Soul people said under vir
[1:33:33] people two Lord all those God they say
[1:33:35] we say what the prophet
[1:33:39] said tell me in your words what your
[1:33:42] Revelation
[1:33:47] is put it in your
[1:33:49] words talk to me about the God God you
[1:33:52] see that's what I do to
[1:33:58] you I try to talk to you about what I
[1:34:00] see what he is
[1:34:02] right it should be that go ahead brother
[1:34:06] anybody have 107 in the red book 107 in
[1:34:09] the red book at the sounding of the
[1:34:12] trumpet when the
[1:34:16] saint think about it I'm talking about a
[1:34:19] God that lives
[1:34:22] God
[1:34:23] is Hebrews
[1:34:29] 138 we are compassed about by
[1:34:33] so
[1:34:35] numerable company
[1:34:41] of why because we stayed with the
[1:34:49] word we don't have all the
[1:34:52] but we certainly know a little
[1:34:59] bit we certainly know a little about a
[1:35:02] God that's
[1:35:05] real anybody ever mounted anything
[1:35:08] believed in a real
[1:35:20] God is
[1:35:23] juile
[1:35:34] what you have a need just come let's
[1:35:39] see see if that God is
[1:35:50] real
[1:35:52] I still believe he
[1:35:59] speak you're listening to a tap you're
[1:36:02] listening to somebody God speaks to you
[1:36:04] about something right don't you think he
[1:36:07] can still
[1:36:13] speak what a wonderful God we
[1:36:18] serve and we can follow our lineage
[1:36:22] all the way through the
[1:36:23] Bible stand right there with
[1:36:30] a say I got a
[1:36:48] revelation remember the service
[1:36:50] Wednesday pray the Lord would bless and
[1:36:52] lead
[1:36:54] us remember Bible study
[1:36:57] Saturday just think about
[1:36:59] him think about what we're doing
[1:37:02] church I'm trying to speak from my own
[1:37:06] heart of what I see God to
[1:37:11] be have you got any trouble with the
[1:37:13] same God in your
[1:37:16] heart we may vary over wording but we
[1:37:19] can't veryy over Doctrine
[1:37:22] well that's the way that brother
[1:37:24] believes it well something wrong with
[1:37:26] his believing if it ain't
[1:37:29] right but if it's
[1:37:32] right our two brothers in a Minister's
[1:37:35] meeting one night they were just going
[1:37:36] at it and I was the moderator so I had
[1:37:39] the right to do it they was going at it
[1:37:41] just hot and heavy and I just stopped
[1:37:44] them I said brother just hold it I said
[1:37:47] brother now are you saying so and so and
[1:37:49] so and so yeah I said brother are you
[1:37:51] saying so and so and so on he said yes I
[1:37:53] said everybody in the building knows
[1:37:56] that both of you saying the same thing
[1:37:58] but you to because you're too
[1:37:59] hard-headed
[1:38:00] to admit it both of them agreed with
[1:38:07] me but everybody in the building knew
[1:38:09] they were saying the same
[1:38:11] thing they just wouldn't
[1:38:14] agree but you see
[1:38:17] Church Abel had a revelation
[1:38:22] and it cried out to God from his soul
[1:38:25] that was in
[1:38:28] Paradise now let me give you one
[1:38:30] more because Paradise was taken
[1:38:34] up now up in
[1:38:37] heaven according to the Book of
[1:38:39] Revelations it comes a time to where it
[1:38:44] says told under the altar crying
[1:38:48] out how long how long
[1:38:54] can't you hear
[1:38:56] that how
[1:38:58] long how long will you argue and fuss
[1:39:01] over
[1:39:02] Doctrine how long will you grip and
[1:39:05] complain about a building too hot or too
[1:39:08] cold or too many services or not enough
[1:39:11] services or how
[1:39:16] long they're still crying
[1:39:19] out and come on get
[1:39:24] it but I want to come back to
[1:39:27] earth Pi up my
[1:39:34] body what about it but you see we're so
[1:39:37] smart until we say but brother Dale you
[1:39:39] don't understand your scripture because
[1:39:40] that's only speaking of the Jews you
[1:39:43] don't understand the prophet's message
[1:39:45] cuz brother Brown was one that
[1:39:47] said they were solds under the altar
[1:39:49] crying how long how long and calls it
[1:39:52] bride but he left off the end of it
[1:39:54] where it says to avenge our blood he
[1:39:57] said that's
[1:40:02] Jews you see the prophet's message has
[1:40:05] got the
[1:40:07] answer all of our
[1:40:10] questions if we'll just
[1:40:14] pray Lord Jesus bless the people on the
[1:40:17] way home may we all Lord gather together
[1:40:20] in hearing that voice voice though we
[1:40:22] still hear today the soul of almighty
[1:40:24] God as he cries out and speaks to each
[1:40:26] and every one of us speaks to this inner
[1:40:30] being part that we are the soul of
[1:40:33] mankind and we line up with you
[1:40:36] Lord we open those doors and the things
[1:40:38] the prophet would speak of that was
[1:40:40] closed in our heart and we yield the
[1:40:42] things unto you and let you walk into
[1:40:46] each one have your way Lord bless and
[1:40:49] take care of everybody give us journey
[1:40:51] in Jesus name amen you
[1:41:03] dismiss
