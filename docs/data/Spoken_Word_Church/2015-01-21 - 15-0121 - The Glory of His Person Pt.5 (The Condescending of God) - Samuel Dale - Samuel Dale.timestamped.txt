[3:17] each one we love you you said you sent
[3:19] your word and healed us and delivered us
[3:22] from destruction so we can believe it
[3:24] and we thank you guide us now as we read
[3:27] your word and keep us in Jesus name
[3:31] amen Revelations 1 we've been reading
[3:35] from verse 10 through 13 I was in the
[3:38] spirit on the Lord's day and heard
[3:40] behind me a great voice out of a trumpet
[3:43] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[3:45] and the last and what thou see us write
[3:48] in a book and send it unto the seven
[3:50] churches which are in Asia unto Ephesus
[3:53] and unto samna and unto pergamus and
[3:56] unto Tara and unto Sardis and unto
[3:59] Philadelphia
[4:00] and unto lady OA so we've got our own
[4:03] message right that the Lord has given to
[4:05] us and I turned to see the voice that
[4:08] spake with me and being turned I saw
[4:10] seven golden candlesticks and one in the
[4:13] midst of the seven candlesticks and in
[4:15] the midst of the seven golden
[4:17] candlesticks one lik unto the son of man
[4:19] clothed with a garment down to the foot
[4:21] and gir about the paps with a golden
[4:24] girdle all right
[4:28] John
[4:33] 118 no man has seen God at any time the
[4:38] only begotten
[4:40] son which is in the bosom of the father
[4:44] he hath declared him you may be seated
[4:48] the Lord at his Blessing to the reading
[4:50] of the word now the word declare is
[4:56] to in other words bring out into the old
[4:59] open amen or to show or to give
[5:03] understanding or you know of those forms
[5:07] and uh we know that's what God has done
[5:13] in his condescending because that's what
[5:15] we're going to be talking about
[5:17] tonight we're still on the glory of his
[5:20] person all of this is still a background
[5:22] for when we get on to see in the things
[5:27] but the word condescend
[5:31] now listen to what it says or
[5:34] condescending is showing or implying a
[5:38] gracious or
[5:41] patronizing
[5:43] uh descent from dignity or
[5:48] superiority now from coming down all
[5:51] right the word condescend is to wave
[5:57] superiority volunt
[6:00] arily and
[6:02] assume
[6:05] equality with an
[6:09] inferior now that's what the word
[6:11] condescend means so you look up a lot of
[6:13] things brother around says about the
[6:14] condescending of God but it's to wave
[6:18] superiority
[6:21] voluntarily you
[6:23] know all right and to assume
[6:27] equality with an inferior
[6:30] because there would be no need of of
[6:32] talking about condescending if you
[6:34] wasn't coming downward you know for some
[6:37] purpose and what's God's purpose for
[6:41] condescending is to reveal
[6:45] himself to his
[6:48] creation all right and that would mean
[6:51] that he would condescend all right now I
[6:55] want you to listen real carefully with
[6:57] me tonight because
[7:00] uh I told Wade some things the other day
[7:03] that I was studying on and uh it's going
[7:09] to take for a while now some thinking
[7:13] amen all
[7:15] right it's going to take some natural
[7:18] thinking and it's going to take some
[7:20] praying for God to speak to
[7:24] us about what's being said and if I was
[7:28] you I would listen I made a statement
[7:32] years I've made it I forgot I imagine
[7:35] probably 10 times in the pce 40 years I
[7:38] said one of these days I'm going to
[7:40] preach on the
[7:42] godhead you remember
[7:45] that uh and I warned you I said if I
[7:49] were you I would listen because I might
[7:54] be doing it without just taking a text
[7:58] you know to to preach on that so uh I
[8:02] would pay close attention if I were you
[8:04] and I invite you to I invite you to
[8:07] listen and to try to comprehend but
[8:11] mainly now is like I've always
[8:15] said I can't convince you of anything
[8:18] and I can't reveal anything to you
[8:21] brother brandham couldn't reveal
[8:23] anything to us he was the vessel God
[8:26] used Jesus said even my own body in
[8:29] other words I couldn't do it myself page
[8:32] 45 I believe it is Christ of mystery he
[8:35] said the only revealer of the word is
[8:39] the Father which is the holy spirit all
[8:42] right so then he uses mankind to speak
[8:45] to us and bringing it and that doesn't
[8:49] by saying that doesn't anull a statement
[8:52] the prophet would say that a prophet is
[8:54] a Divine interpreter of the word all
[8:57] right we go along with that amen but
[8:59] just remember he cannot
[9:03] interpret the word the way we think it
[9:07] is done he can only bring it to us as
[9:11] God reveals it to
[9:13] him because outside of that it would be
[9:16] his own idea and that would be no
[9:17] different than you and I although I like
[9:19] his ideas better than mine most of the
[9:21] time I don't know whether you do or not
[9:23] but you know he you listen to him you
[9:26] figure out a lot of things but now I
[9:31] know I repeat
[9:33] myself but repetitive things according
[9:36] to Paul is
[9:37] necessary for us to understand and I
[9:41] want to keep holding up some things
[9:43] before you to get you
[9:46] to
[9:48] study to show yourself
[9:51] approved you know a Workman that needeth
[9:54] not to be ashamed rightly dividing the
[9:56] word of Truth Now
[10:02] last
[10:03] Wednesday we tried to preach some about
[10:07] it and I want to go over that and reread
[10:10] it because I want you to see it I've
[10:14] asked you a simple question people say
[10:16] brother Dale you're so
[10:19] deep how can you be any more simple than
[10:23] asking a simple question or
[10:27] deeper what do you believe about
[10:31] God that's
[10:33] simple all I'm asking is an
[10:37] answer what do you believe about
[10:40] God when the Bible says God is a spirit
[10:44] what do you
[10:47] believe well he's a
[10:50] spirit all right now interpret that
[10:54] right amen right
[10:58] okay is he just with no
[11:01] form
[11:05] nothing he's
[11:07] just a
[11:11] spirit is that's your interpretation of
[11:14] the word
[11:16] spirit all
[11:19] right that to me is very simple I don't
[11:22] understand why people to me I I I get so
[11:27] uh perturbed I guess or disturbed when
[11:30] people say brother Dale is so deep we
[11:32] don't understand him now what it is
[11:35] you're not listening
[11:37] right is there any more simple language
[11:40] to speak in than my old southern
[11:42] language that is very poor and and to
[11:46] just simply ask you a simple
[11:50] question is your god real amen that's
[11:54] right of course we we we understand the
[11:56] message so much until we we we
[11:59] immediately when our mind we click but
[12:02] God is an object of
[12:05] worship and he wasn't even
[12:09] god well what was
[12:15] he simple
[12:18] question what was
[12:24] he did he gain any
[12:27] attributes
[12:30] after the fall of
[12:34] mankind or did he always have those
[12:39] attributes simple
[12:42] question did he always have the
[12:44] attributes of Father healer savior
[12:49] God whatever words you want to
[12:52] use didn't he have them before he ever
[12:56] started in any way to condescend
[13:02] cuz see you couldn't go with the
[13:04] scriptures like that and think about
[13:06] where it says that he's Hebrews 13:8 the
[13:09] same yesterday today and forever all
[13:12] right we'll use those again in a minute
[13:15] but you couldn't go with with
[13:17] uh Malachi 3 and I believe it's six
[13:21] where he says I'm God and I change
[13:25] not but see we got it all figured out
[13:27] but he wasn't he not God until some
[13:30] worshiped him well Glory Hallelujah you
[13:34] know how to
[13:38] read but what was he before the Angels
[13:41] worshiped him oh he just
[13:47] Spirit Well I thought and we're really
[13:50] going to get into a few things going
[13:52] down the road a little on this
[13:54] but I
[13:56] thought that the Bible speaks of God is
[13:58] is having a
[14:01] heart that's
[14:04] right I thought it spoke of even even
[14:06] having a
[14:09] stomach I thought it spoke of him as
[14:11] having eyes that's right
[14:15] sir hands
[14:23] feet he pretty real isn't
[14:27] he and then this ask you a simple
[14:35] question is he more real than we
[14:39] are right
[14:43] amen but we want to
[14:45] make that's real that's that's hard
[14:52] wood but remember somebody created
[14:57] that and who was was it that done those
[14:59] things that's
[15:02] right but see thank God that we have
[15:05] received a
[15:07] prophet that could go into the
[15:10] scriptures and break them down and show
[15:14] us the things that we used to wonder
[15:19] about right you
[15:22] know but is your god real
[15:26] amen now was he
[15:30] before he became God right
[15:37] amen and my point is what form did he
[15:45] have and he turns around and he
[15:48] says let
[15:55] us the prophet said that was father and
[15:57] son
[15:59] right right amen right better way of
[16:04] understanding that's why I try to help
[16:05] you and I'm
[16:07] so called an intellect because what why
[16:10] don't you just say word and
[16:15] spirit
[16:17] right now if the scripture is right
[16:19] where he said let us make man in our
[16:23] image then whatever image the man came
[16:27] out to be would be the image of the son
[16:32] that's
[16:33] right and the son would be the image of
[16:36] the father amen that's right right amen
[16:40] that's
[16:42] simple right we just got out of
[16:46] kindergarten we found out English is a
[16:49] language that we can
[16:54] use you don't ever think like that
[16:59] see now we've argued all the way down to
[17:02] about let us oh there must be two see we
[17:05] didn't try to have any comprehension
[17:08] about who we was talking about or any
[17:11] way of looking at that we were only
[17:13] arguing if there was one or two or
[17:16] three
[17:21] right well see then you don't never
[17:23] think about let us make man in our image
[17:27] and our likeness
[17:29] right yep so we can go back and we can
[17:33] do all of the great layout of the
[17:35] message of the theop the the Loos the
[17:38] things and well it was just in the image
[17:40] of that well then what image was
[17:47] that did not your Prophet go beyond the
[17:51] curtain of
[17:53] time did not your Prophet say those
[17:56] people were in theophany
[18:02] did not your Prophet say he could feel
[18:06] them and see them hear
[18:10] them must been pretty
[18:13] real he didn't talk about that just
[18:15] being some spooky world over there
[18:17] floating
[18:21] around all
[18:24] right
[18:26] then if you even use the
[18:30] logic that well well what it's talking
[18:33] about when you're bringing God into
[18:35] something real is you got to get on over
[18:36] into the logos and the theophanies and
[18:39] the things and and we got those big
[18:41] words and we think we really are
[18:43] theological
[18:49] Giants well one plus one equals
[18:54] 2 if the
[18:57] theophany
[19:01] could be failed seen by Moses talked to
[19:06] by
[19:10] Abraham if that's
[19:13] true then what form would the father
[19:23] be oh you just buffle you just buffle my
[19:26] mind you just jungle my mind
[19:29] I didn't juggle your mind I un juggled
[19:32] it if you'd
[19:34] listen well God is just a Spirit Well I
[19:38] tell me what a spirit
[19:43] is would we wind up like they did there
[19:45] when Jesus said after his resurrection
[19:48] he said feel
[19:49] me he said because the spirit hath not
[19:51] flesh and
[19:57] Bone
[19:59] we're going to get to a little quote in
[20:01] a minute that
[20:03] uh you know we were talking Sunday and
[20:06] they didn't know I was going this way
[20:08] and I'll let it go a lot of times don't
[20:10] mention much
[20:14] but have you ever heard this statement
[20:17] from Brother brandom on who is this male
[20:20] chz in the
[20:22] beginning
[20:24] before the Eternal right amen right sure
[20:30] now ain't a theologian in the world can
[20:32] handle that
[20:33] quote and a Lula or whatever you want to
[20:36] call us we can't handle
[20:40] that because that's beyond any human
[20:47] comprehension but a seventh grade
[20:49] education man could express
[20:55] that what about it
[20:59] what about a man that you know those
[21:01] theologians they just sat there and
[21:02] listen to him and we knew some of them
[21:05] personally you know we're listening the
[21:07] other day to some that brother Brandon
[21:08] was talking about and uh met a few of
[21:12] them you know after coming into the
[21:13] message
[21:14] and and uh you
[21:18] know he he'd bring out something and
[21:21] they just you know they just went under
[21:23] the table as we call it or shook their
[21:25] head or just
[21:29] but then once it was
[21:33] said if they were really born
[21:36] again they would know that there was no
[21:39] other way to say it than
[21:45] that right or at least ought to right I
[21:49] mean it ought to be but is your God
[21:55] real or has he just become real
[22:01] yeah
[22:03] you the further we go he becomes more
[22:07] real that's not logical
[22:16] sense because Hebrews 13:8 says whatever
[22:19] he was he is and will forever be right
[22:24] that's
[22:25] right so whatever we see to
[22:31] be had to be back there before we would
[22:36] even talk and he would use in the
[22:38] beginning before the Eternal
[22:48] amen I know I say things that I
[22:50] shouldn't say but you know what I I do a
[22:52] lot of times I think about what brother
[22:53] Brown said he said I'm not doing this to
[22:56] preach Doctrine
[22:58] you remember that one he said I'm doing
[23:01] this to straighten out
[23:05] Doctrine I'm trying my best to get you
[23:08] and me me off of that thing of thinking
[23:12] about Spirit
[23:15] God
[23:18] things to get us to a position that we
[23:20] can see the
[23:23] reality amen that's right of a living
[23:26] God Amen
[23:30] and how real he really
[23:37] is see because you well all right I'll
[23:42] try to get on with the
[23:44] message we've been talking about how
[23:46] real God is and and that he's not a
[23:51] myth and that he's not like the
[23:56] wind
[23:59] and getting it to a position to try to
[24:04] understand to see to
[24:08] understand about
[24:12] God and how great he is yeah all
[24:17] right but you see I give these quotes
[24:20] from The
[24:21] Prophet but I don't just give you one
[24:24] quote I've got four five where he's
[24:28] talking about God is not like the wind
[24:30] and God is not like the air I can give
[24:32] you a quote where he says God is like
[24:34] the
[24:40] air I generally just try to give you
[24:42] both sides of it where you think it
[24:45] over but go back and check the position
[24:48] or situation that he's speaking of at
[24:51] the time that he says those things
[24:53] that's right when maybe in the same
[24:56] message he might say God is like the
[24:59] wind and then the same message I don't
[25:01] think it is but I'm just giving you that
[25:03] it's within a close year or something
[25:05] and then he would turn around and say
[25:09] oh God is Not Like the
[25:12] Wind he's not like the
[25:15] a the amoya the air we breathe you know
[25:18] in and
[25:20] out why do you think he said those
[25:22] things so many
[25:25] times to try to get us to understand
[25:29] stand you know
[25:32] right but look let's read these cuz I it
[25:36] doesn't bother me to read them over to
[25:37] you now it may bother you and you maybe
[25:39] get dull well go ahead and get dull
[25:43] about it and do whatever you want to do
[25:45] I'm just trying my best to help you all
[25:48] right and uh have I become your enemy
[25:52] because I tell you the
[25:54] truth that is my point all right go
[25:57] ahead with number one let's read these
[25:59] over again that we read some of them
[26:01] last
[26:02] Wednesday and look what he's
[26:05] saying you
[26:07] know he's on the adoption series 196 522
[26:12] paragraph 48 and I said he's not
[26:15] omnipresent in the way that the word
[26:18] speaks
[26:20] omnipresent he cannot be a being and
[26:23] then be
[26:25] omnipresent that's right right if he's
[26:29] omnipresent why would you pray for the
[26:31] Holy
[26:33] Spirit see that's the way I love the
[26:36] prophet he this up here may be the
[26:39] attacks that goes with I don't mean the
[26:42] word attack about but I mean this part
[26:44] here is straightening out the
[26:47] theologians right
[26:49] right because he's telling
[26:52] them you say he's
[26:56] omnipresent if he's a being he cannot be
[27:01] omnipresent
[27:03] all then he gets down to us
[27:07] peons small
[27:09] mind and he said if he's omnipresent why
[27:13] would you pray for the holy
[27:16] spirit is that
[27:18] deep it's deep because we don't want to
[27:21] believe it cuz we don't comprehend it
[27:24] because we've got our mind set on
[27:27] something
[27:28] else that's right and it's destroying
[27:32] our
[27:36] thoughts if he's
[27:39] omnipresent he feels ever crack Corner
[27:42] crevice ever saale fiber everything else
[27:45] there
[27:46] is
[27:48] okay I said why did he hunt for
[27:52] Moses if he's
[27:55] omnipresent at the end
[27:58] why did he run up and down the Garden of
[28:01] Eden crying Adam Adam Where Art Thou if
[28:04] he's
[28:07] omnipresent see he's omnipresent because
[28:10] he's
[28:13] omniscient he
[28:15] knows omnipresent is ever omnicient is
[28:19] to know all
[28:21] things he knows everything because he's
[28:24] infinite being infinite makes him I'm de
[28:27] press
[28:28] do because he knows to be there he
[28:30] doesn't have to be on the moon today if
[28:32] nobody's on the moon right that's right
[28:34] is that too hard to believe that's a
[28:37] simple statement but it's truth isn't it
[28:40] being omnipresent then being infant then
[28:42] he sets in the heavens he abides in a
[28:46] place because he is a
[28:50] being I just can't believe that I've
[28:53] been taught all my life he's a
[28:56] spirit
[28:59] you see what I'm talking
[29:06] about if it gets brokenhearted to me I
[29:09] wonder what that Prophet
[29:11] was when he knew people wouldn't getting
[29:15] it what about when he gets on the seals
[29:18] our seventh seal I'm sure he said it's
[29:21] gone from
[29:23] you it said right around the coming of
[29:25] the
[29:26] Lord
[29:29] how do you think he felt how do you
[29:31] think Jesus felt when he looked over
[29:33] there at Phillip and said Phillip have I
[29:35] been so long with you you want to see
[29:40] God I am him made
[29:45] manifest how do you think he
[29:48] fa look at number two which is taken for
[29:51] Fellowship 196
[29:55] 611 go ahead roll it up
[30:01] some time ago I was dedicating a
[30:03] tabernacle they asked me to bring I
[30:05] watch his wording a brother down in
[30:07] Tennessee I forgot what his name was now
[30:10] the Church of God down there and I said
[30:12] God is a
[30:17] being now God's just not like your like
[30:21] the
[30:22] a if he would you would never have to
[30:25] seek the Holy Ghost would be in you cuz
[30:29] he's filled all space and things God's
[30:32] omnipresent sure by being omniscient
[30:37] knowing all things but God has a
[30:40] Dwelling Place he speaks of his house he
[30:43] speaks of
[30:45] right because he is a
[30:48] being exactly right and God dwells with
[30:51] f dwells with Fellowship under the shed
[30:54] blood of his son and that alone amen and
[30:57] denomination can't figure it out all
[30:59] right won't me him go to number
[31:02] three things that are to be paragraph
[31:07] 38 he's omnipresent because he's
[31:10] omniscient omniscient because he's
[31:13] omnipresent therefore by his for
[31:16] knowledge see all right now he can't be
[31:19] just like the wind over the Earth
[31:22] because he's a
[31:24] being he just isn't a myth
[31:29] he's a
[31:30] being he dwells he even dwells in a
[31:33] house he dwells in a place called heaven
[31:36] and therefore by his Omni being
[31:38] omnipresent being omniscient knowing all
[31:41] things then he's omnipresent because he
[31:43] knows all things all right look at the
[31:47] next wasn't so from the
[31:51] beginning God could not be just like the
[31:53] a is because God has a Dwelling Place
[31:57] God is not a myth God is a being God
[32:02] Jesus he God pronoun he's a being
[32:06] therefore he's omniscient omnipresent
[32:10] omnipotent infinite amen and who is
[32:14] he he's
[32:17] God going on to 4
[32:21] a which is we would see Jesus 1957
[32:28] God was the center of that Fountain he's
[32:30] told me in the beginning God was a
[32:32] spirit at and all the Fountain of
[32:35] goodness and mercy and power and all the
[32:36] good things of love God was the center
[32:39] of that Fountain and then the logos that
[32:41] went out of God in the beginning become
[32:44] what we call a
[32:45] theophany or a supernatural
[32:49] body God is just not like the hour but
[32:54] he's in a body Moses saw when he pass
[32:58] by all
[33:01] right look at who is this male
[33:04] chdc number
[33:08] 4B he is a being he's not like the wind
[33:12] he's a being he dwells in a house but
[33:15] being omniscient knowing all things
[33:16] makes him an omnipresent because he
[33:18] knows everything that's going on
[33:21] now so we have by the prophet
[33:25] established the fact
[33:28] that he's not like we think of
[33:33] AR and just being an
[33:35] amoya Ever how that word
[33:39] there he's not like the
[33:42] wind he's a being oh but but Brother D
[33:46] he become a
[33:54] being I'm glad you thought of that
[33:58] so if he become a being he had to be a
[34:00] being before right or he
[34:04] changed
[34:05] right he's not Hebrews 13:8 if he become
[34:09] a being that was not a being
[34:12] before amen that's right is that
[34:17] deep whatever he is he had to be
[34:23] exactly or he changed right
[34:28] amen see I'm talking about a real God
[34:32] Amen I spent 50 years trying to explain
[34:39] this I saw the other day how to explain
[34:41] what I saw 40 years
[34:44] ago maybe we'll get to it in 40 years
[34:47] from now right I don't worry about
[34:51] it but listen
[34:54] Church you know I know it's like I told
[34:59] Wade was going down to pick up brother
[35:03] Louise I said I have no desire to go
[35:06] anywhere to preach I used to I had a
[35:08] desire to preach wanted to go and preach
[35:10] and try to help people I have no desire
[35:12] for that
[35:14] anymore because I know and realize that
[35:17] if you don't listen to what I'm saying
[35:19] you're going to wonder what in the world
[35:21] I'm
[35:22] saying and if you have no background for
[35:25] a time to live
[35:28] listen then you're going you are mly
[35:31] confused I realize that not that I'm
[35:33] that deep I no I'm trying my best to
[35:36] tell you I'm that simple that's
[35:39] right am your intellectual mind is the
[35:43] Deep part
[35:50] right he's not a
[35:53] myth he's a
[35:55] being all right
[36:00] and out of that
[36:04] being he begin to bring
[36:06] forth number five read it paragraph 51
[36:13] adoption but he is a
[36:18] being God is a being and out of this
[36:21] being begin to bring forth
[36:25] these everything that there is had to
[36:28] come out from
[36:32] him
[36:34] right so what are we talking
[36:37] about look at number six God's provided
[36:45] way now God put man first in his own
[36:49] image which was in an image of
[36:53] God and God is a supernatural being
[36:59] he was a supernatural man now you can
[37:02] say well now brother D you I'll go along
[37:04] with you he's talking about natural man
[37:06] that he created all right natural man he
[37:09] created was a supernatural
[37:12] being or you can say God is a
[37:14] supernatural being cuz that's what he
[37:15] just
[37:16] said he just said he was a supernatural
[37:21] being and a Man created in the image of
[37:24] God would be a supernatural being that's
[37:25] why he was created Spirit man first
[37:28] that's right that's right
[37:30] amen
[37:33] amen so
[37:35] remember let us make man in our
[37:40] image so then whatever Man was created
[37:44] is in the image of
[37:48] God so it would mean God has
[37:54] that if it's in the image of it there
[37:57] had to be something here for this to
[37:59] come out over here to be the same that's
[38:02] right
[38:04] am right
[38:06] am what do you
[38:09] think see God's a supernatural
[38:13] being look at the next
[38:17] one if God be for us where all the
[38:20] Miracles be with us that God is a
[38:23] supernatural
[38:25] being and wherever supernatural being is
[38:28] he'll do Supernatural signs because The
[38:30] Supernaturals in him you can't get out
[38:32] of it he said it's all of this is doing
[38:35] is a working of a supernatural
[38:40] being all right so what do you think
[38:43] about
[38:46] God and how many gods do you
[38:51] have that's right am now how many gods
[38:55] does the Bible talk
[39:00] of I I I thought it spoke of one God
[39:04] that's right but Paul could say the God
[39:07] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ one
[39:10] two
[39:12] three come on you remember the Trinity
[39:16] days when we argued with people they was
[39:19] three of
[39:23] them right you remember the trinity in
[39:27] days when we said can't you see are you
[39:30] blind on the river there one was up here
[39:33] one was over here and one was down
[39:36] there there's got to be three of
[39:42] them but how many B how many gods does
[39:45] the bible believe in amen one that's
[39:48] right how many gods did the prophet
[39:51] believe
[39:52] in but yet I can give you a quote where
[39:55] brother R said let's stand and address
[39:57] the third person of the Trinity right
[40:00] that's
[40:02] right
[40:06] right you see
[40:11] Church the prophet could say things and
[40:13] it was
[40:15] really it was
[40:17] mindboggling and it's still
[40:21] mindboggling to us with that we try to
[40:24] run everything with our mind
[40:28] he said if you just simply sit down and
[40:34] think is that the
[40:37] terminologies said well I can't
[40:39] understand what he said if you just
[40:41] simply sit down and think
[40:47] right just simply think if there's three
[40:50] Gods who created who who got here
[40:53] first y
[40:57] just simple
[41:00] things
[41:02] right well what do you think about it
[41:06] let's read a statement and see what you
[41:08] think go ahead to number
[41:16] eight and I want to pick a part out of
[41:18] there and then go back to the to the
[41:22] other
[41:25] uh
[41:27] roll this up and then we'll bring it
[41:28] back down because we'll read the whole
[41:30] thing together he was in other words
[41:33] Adam the first man in the lower creation
[41:36] of God the first creation was God
[41:45] himself
[41:48] now then out of God came to
[41:51] Loos which was the son of
[41:55] God
[41:59] look
[42:00] look that that's at least
[42:10] three I guess we're so spiritual we can
[42:13] correct a prophet so we just tear out
[42:14] what we don't want and you know and then
[42:17] we claim the message that's what it
[42:18] gives me
[42:20] yeah what gets me is the people of this
[42:23] message that's got all these two Soul
[42:24] sth anniversary perus no Holy Ghost uh
[42:27] River Jordans and all these Doctrine and
[42:29] every one of them saying what the
[42:30] prophet
[42:36] say
[42:40] yeah why don't the people stand up and
[42:42] point their fer in their face and say
[42:44] you ain't saying what the prophet
[42:46] said that's
[42:48] right yes sir well now that brother has
[42:51] a right to believe that let me say it
[42:54] this way the brother has a right by the
[42:56] Constitution to believe what he wants to
[42:59] but he does not have a right to say
[43:01] brother brandham taught that now I
[43:04] resent that for him to say brother
[43:07] brandham taught that that is not a
[43:10] constitutional
[43:14] right
[43:15] right but think about
[43:19] it in other
[43:21] words the first creation was God
[43:25] himself
[43:26] then out of God came the logos which was
[43:29] the son of
[43:31] God then out of the
[43:33] logos which was the
[43:36] word what about
[43:40] it how many gods do you
[43:47] have and I
[43:49] know I try to help you but I know what I
[43:52] do I hurt your feelings I can just say
[43:54] this one statement and and I just see
[43:56] people in the building just
[43:58] go I asked you in
[44:04] 1984 somewhere right about then I said
[44:08] when when you say son of God when do you
[44:12] think the Son of God came into
[44:14] being and everybody in the building said
[44:17] 2,000 years
[44:21] ago brother brandham has just put the
[44:24] Son of God before the foundation the
[44:26] world that's right and I thought that
[44:29] we'll prove by the scriptures
[44:31] that Jesus Christ created all things am
[44:35] that's right right
[44:41] sir but see you get offended because I
[44:44] try to dig you out of a
[44:47] hole I went to a Minister's meet one
[44:49] time and these these brothers they were
[44:51] trying to prove polygamy was okay and I
[44:55] just got up up and made a flat
[44:57] statement I said if you think you can
[45:00] believe in one more than one wife and
[45:01] polygamy then go right ahead you ain't
[45:04] got nothing but a lust devil on
[45:06] you well you know they wouldn't even
[45:08] speak to me for
[45:10] years and I was trying to dig them out
[45:13] of a hole that they had already planned
[45:16] who they were going home
[45:18] with the women had already set aside who
[45:22] was going home with who because of their
[45:25] Doctrine
[45:27] and yet I dug them out of the pit of
[45:28] Hell and wound up being an
[45:32] enemy well I ain't going to back
[45:34] off I don't give a hoot about anything
[45:39] but this
[45:41] word and what you think about me that's
[45:43] your business I don't want you to think
[45:45] that about
[45:48] me I want you to think that I love you
[45:51] and try to help you amen
[45:54] amen we sure don't act like it sometimes
[45:57] well I have a funny way of being who I
[46:02] am all right I don't imagine them people
[46:06] down there when Jesus drove them out of
[46:07] the temple with a whip thought too good
[46:10] of him
[46:11] either you trying to make yourself like
[46:13] him no I don't have to worry about
[46:16] it I ain't got the
[46:19] whip okay
[46:22] yet
[46:24] huh but let's read something from this
[46:27] one and I'm sure this is the only quote
[46:29] we'll get but so this is two quotes
[46:31] above where we or one quote above where
[46:33] we were last Wednesday
[46:36] but go back to number eight there and go
[46:39] back up above where we
[46:41] were and I want you to think
[46:44] about paragraph 21 is where we
[46:49] start now if God created man in his own
[46:53] image in his own likeness what kind of a
[46:56] man did he
[46:58] create a spirit
[47:02] man now if you'll
[47:05] notice after he had made all the
[47:07] creation and created a spirit man the
[47:10] close reading is this is to the one that
[47:13] asked the
[47:15] question God give dominion of the C
[47:17] cattle and the fishes and everything
[47:19] over to the
[47:21] man but in his makeup up there he made a
[47:26] man in his own image to lead the animals
[47:29] now that's not the flesh man he made the
[47:30] flesh man later right Genesis 1 f is the
[47:34] first man Genesis 2 is the second man
[47:37] first man read the animals Nam the
[47:41] animals all right
[47:43] okay he made man in his own image to
[47:47] lead the cattle lead the Beast of the
[47:48] field just like the Holy Spirit leads a
[47:51] Believer today he was in other words
[47:53] Adam the first man in the Lord four
[47:56] creations of God the first creation was
[47:59] God himself then out of God came the
[48:01] logos which was the son of God then out
[48:04] of the logos which was the word in the
[48:07] beginning was the word and the Word was
[48:08] with God and the Word was God and the
[48:10] Word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[48:12] out of the logos came forth the the the
[48:16] man
[48:24] let's now
[48:32] question why did Brother
[48:35] brandham
[48:38] constantly reject the doctrine of the
[48:42] Catholic
[48:44] church that said
[48:46] that they believed in eternal
[48:54] sunship
[48:58] he said we don't believe in that he said
[49:00] that's the Catholic
[49:04] doctrine of Eternal
[49:07] sunship yet he has just
[49:12] said this is before the world this is
[49:14] before the creation this was
[49:18] back there and he
[49:20] says that God's first creation was
[49:23] himself and out of that creation came
[49:26] the logos the
[49:28] theophany the Son of
[49:32] God now that's before time ever started
[49:35] we got plenty of writing if you want to
[49:36] go home tonight take your computer and
[49:39] just run it in on your computer and just
[49:43] read run in Son of
[49:46] God put Loos with it we'll cut down your
[49:49] times of searching and just listen to
[49:52] what that Prophet has to
[49:54] say
[50:01] was
[50:06] Jesus God made manifest in human
[50:09] flesh amen that's
[50:13] right called a
[50:16] son right so you'll see immediately that
[50:19] most of your Catholicism Catholic
[50:22] Doctrine is dealing with Jesus 2,000
[50:24] years ago right of Eternal
[50:30] sunship when brother brandom is back for
[50:33] the foundation the world talking about a
[50:35] Son of
[50:39] God you said you just confuse me simply
[50:43] listen cut off that thing you call a
[50:46] brain that is sitting there I can't F of
[50:49] this out I don't know what he's just
[50:50] saying he's got me
[50:52] confused stop and say say a
[50:56] prayer Lord right help me
[51:01] understand
[51:04] amen because the man has just made a
[51:08] statement brother Brandon spoke of the
[51:11] Son of God before the world cuz he knew
[51:13] the scriptures the Son of God is the
[51:15] creator the father never created
[51:17] anything there's no scripture for that
[51:20] right all things were made by him and
[51:23] without him there was not anything made
[51:24] that was made right Hebrews 1 John 1
[51:29] Colossians 1 Ephesians 3 that all things
[51:33] were made by Jesus
[51:37] Christ now we know Jesus the flesh never
[51:39] created
[51:42] nothing true amen all right so we got it
[51:46] in the right
[51:49] understanding but I wish you would just
[51:52] just just for a second now listen to me
[51:55] for for a second with your computers cut
[51:58] off and I didn't say blank your mind I
[52:00] got enough sense to know how to read I
[52:02] know what your Prophet said they get
[52:04] people to blank their mind I ain't
[52:06] talking about blank your mind you ain't
[52:07] going to blank it
[52:11] anyway you're going to sit there where
[52:13] you're still the same ideas you had when
[52:14] you got
[52:17] here you ain't going to BL it
[52:20] out and that's why it's so hard for it
[52:23] to come through and that's why it takes
[52:24] Contin
[52:26] repetitious things to break through that
[52:30] mind right why you think it took brother
[52:34] brandom you want a quote from him it
[52:36] took him 33 years I believe it is before
[52:40] he could preach this that's his
[52:47] words yet you can go back to 1956 when
[52:50] you were giv the other day where it's uh
[52:53] the old one is called inter Veil and
[52:55] he's talking about the very nature of
[52:56] God and the Very God living through you
[52:59] and speaking through you and using you
[53:00] and all that's what he taught all the
[53:02] way down but he said I just got this the
[53:05] other day how to explain
[53:10] it right amen I don't mind keep
[53:14] repeating things I do it to try to
[53:17] help well all right now what do you
[53:20] believe about one
[53:22] God now we're not trinitarians the
[53:25] father son Holy Ghost has three Gods
[53:28] right all right we're not Oneness who go
[53:31] to one like your finger position
[53:33] situation and their point is that Jesus
[53:37] was the life manifestation of
[53:40] God that's the oness
[53:43] doctrine all right so we're neither
[53:48] one without Father Son and Holy Ghost
[53:51] God is not
[53:52] complete need that quote
[53:58] he said we don't believe the Trinity
[54:00] Doctrine but said we don't believe the
[54:01] Oneness Doctrine either he didn't say we
[54:04] go in the middle to try to figure it
[54:06] out he said them trinities has got
[54:09] scripture he said them Oneness is has
[54:12] got
[54:17] scripture but what was his
[54:20] Doctrine and simple terminologies about
[54:22] the
[54:24] godhead
[54:27] now when he spoke of the logos of
[54:29] theophany the Son of God coming out of
[54:32] God did that mean God stayed here and
[54:35] outw
[54:38] something that we'd call a Loos or
[54:43] theophany is it that a way or is it a
[54:46] simple form that he
[54:51] said God stepped over in another form
[54:54] right
[54:57] called a son
[55:01] right he just stepped over to another
[55:05] form he said it's a part of God but said
[55:09] not a part like an arm or
[55:15] things he said he just stepped over to
[55:17] another form
[55:22] condescending all right
[55:26] so now the great
[55:29] Eternal and let me say this to you while
[55:32] I'm at
[55:34] it when you use the word
[55:39] Eternal then you are meaning it is
[55:46] something we say it's like a
[55:49] circle but eternity is not like a
[55:53] circle that's only signifying that it
[55:56] has no beginning and no
[55:58] ending
[55:59] right we don't want the three ring
[56:02] circles put up cuz you can get into the
[56:04] Trinity with all of that
[56:08] right but
[56:10] now back before the world ever
[56:13] begun the prophet said to FS you can go
[56:16] back and just say he was
[56:18] Elohim which he said that was
[56:20] self-existing
[56:26] and he said out of that
[56:29] Elohim came the Son of
[56:33] God how beautiful the man could explain
[56:36] the
[56:38] scriptures you know that the father then
[56:40] the great Eternal one this one that was
[56:43] on the other side of before the
[56:47] Eternal he didn't
[56:50] create because that would have not been
[56:54] bringing him out out in the
[56:56] open he stepped over in another
[57:01] form called of logos
[57:04] theophany word
[57:09] speech and then you're right with the
[57:12] scriptures that the Son of
[57:15] God not the human flesh element the Son
[57:18] of God is the creator right how
[57:22] beautiful a prophet could make it
[57:27] that we simple-minded people could
[57:30] comprehend what he was
[57:34] saying not another person went
[57:42] out it wasn't one person standing here
[57:45] and another person went over
[57:51] here it was simply one thing
[57:55] and I emphasize heavily on this because
[57:59] I've seen these drawings that make it
[58:01] look so
[58:03] beautiful you know like one man draw it
[58:06] here was God father and then all of it
[58:11] went over in the
[58:14] sun well it wasn't but one
[58:19] problem he left a hole right here that's
[58:23] right
[58:26] that's what he
[58:29] done he left an empty
[58:32] space I don't believe
[58:35] that I believe all of God can come out
[58:38] and go
[58:39] into the L go and he's still
[58:44] God he's still there and listen that's
[58:53] how f
[58:56] father
[58:58] right glorify
[59:00] me with the glory that I had with
[59:04] thee before the
[59:08] world that wasn't a flesh man as we call
[59:12] because the flesh man was not before the
[59:14] world
[59:19] right see that's where people go Haywire
[59:22] trying to figure it
[59:23] out when they just take simple
[59:27] terminologies because see you know what
[59:29] I'm saying if you say all of God he
[59:32] poured into
[59:33] Christ then there's nothing there here's
[59:37] Christ you're doing pretty good and
[59:39] you're thinking but what about an all
[59:41] Christ poured into the
[59:43] church you're leaving nothing back that
[59:47] way and you got just exactly what the
[59:51] devil wants you to think that you are
[59:53] the almighty God
[59:55] but see now you don't like that and you
[59:57] don't like my terminology you think I'm
[59:59] mad at you or something but if you say
[1:00:02] all God was he poured into Christ all
[1:00:04] Christ poured into the church without
[1:00:06] having an understanding of who God is
[1:00:08] and what's taking place then you've done
[1:00:10] away with God and you're making yourself
[1:00:12] the god that's
[1:00:14] right come
[1:00:18] on well that's what the prophet said
[1:00:21] well
[1:00:23] amen
[1:00:25] but he didn't say it like we say
[1:00:28] it he said out of the
[1:00:31] father we're going to read it in a
[1:00:34] minute out of the father came the
[1:00:38] logos the
[1:00:40] theophany the Son of
[1:00:43] God he didn't do away with the father
[1:00:46] because Jesus didn't do away with the
[1:00:47] father he spoke to him while he was here
[1:00:49] on Earth
[1:00:53] right what what are you doing away
[1:00:57] with that's why I just say what the
[1:00:59] prophet
[1:01:04] said
[1:01:06] yeah
[1:01:08] okay just forgive me for being just what
[1:01:11] I am and just leave me alone I'm happy
[1:01:16] about it because I don't have to do away
[1:01:19] with something here to bring it over
[1:01:21] here and talk about a fullness
[1:01:25] well I brother Dale all means
[1:01:30] all you remember the
[1:01:32] statements all God was he poured into
[1:01:35] Christ all Christ he pours into the
[1:01:38] church how do you think about that if
[1:01:41] all is here there's nothing back there
[1:01:43] you don't have a Christ you don't have a
[1:01:45] God you have you and that's the Devil's
[1:01:51] Playground amen because you're thinking
[1:01:53] you're that God and that's exactly what
[1:01:56] he
[1:01:58] wanted
[1:02:00] okay now I'm going to tell you what I
[1:02:04] believe and then we'll read what the
[1:02:05] prophet
[1:02:07] said is that simple if I ask you
[1:02:11] something you say I just say what the
[1:02:13] prophet
[1:02:15] said now you going to stop and say
[1:02:17] something in the middle don't worry
[1:02:20] about it I done Beyond those days I just
[1:02:22] say what the prophet said
[1:02:25] like I told you the two Soul people have
[1:02:28] quoted for 40
[1:02:30] years the soul is just the nature of the
[1:02:34] spirit and everybody in the message
[1:02:36] quotes that give me one quote from
[1:02:39] Brother brandham Where he said the soul
[1:02:41] is just the nature of the
[1:02:44] spirit they added one
[1:02:48] word but everybody around the world is
[1:02:51] just soul is just the nature of the
[1:02:54] spirit
[1:02:57] it the brother around didn't say that I
[1:03:00] told you what he said no you didn't you
[1:03:03] interpreted it by putting words
[1:03:08] in
[1:03:13] right I
[1:03:16] believe that back before the
[1:03:19] world and we'll draw it out when to get
[1:03:22] back to preaching on it we'll draw line
[1:03:24] and put there where brother R said in
[1:03:26] the beginning before the Eternal and
[1:03:28] we'll go back behind there and talk
[1:03:31] about
[1:03:33] that but just
[1:03:37] remember whatever come into being in
[1:03:40] this world or ever comes into
[1:03:43] being had to be an attribute before
[1:03:47] anything ever come into existence that's
[1:03:49] right that's right
[1:03:51] okay so he was already a father
[1:03:55] he was already a Healer he was already a
[1:03:57] savior he just couldn't display it
[1:03:59] that's right
[1:04:01] right cuz if you don't you mean he
[1:04:03] gained ground when he come this way he
[1:04:06] only gained the ability to display what
[1:04:08] he was that's
[1:04:14] right watch in a minute when we get down
[1:04:16] we around and said it's like a child
[1:04:17] playing before the father's door and he
[1:04:19] says Let There
[1:04:21] Be he didn't do away with a father
[1:04:27] see we take that all God was he pour
[1:04:29] into Christ all Christ he pour we make
[1:04:31] that all not realizing that when we make
[1:04:34] it all we're doing away with all except
[1:04:42] us well I never thought of that brother
[1:04:46] Dale okay maybe that was worth you
[1:04:48] coming tonight to think about
[1:04:52] that but I want you to show me where
[1:04:54] it's
[1:04:59] wrong you see then I have no
[1:05:02] problems would before the world we'll
[1:05:05] call him father where we won't get into
[1:05:07] that word
[1:05:09] god of course he wasn't a father until
[1:05:12] he had something to make him a father
[1:05:15] and you know that how far you want to go
[1:05:17] with that you know he wasn't a father
[1:05:20] the way he wanted to be a father until
[1:05:23] he was the son of man that's a quote
[1:05:27] exactly from your Prophet when he become
[1:05:29] I believe it's Christ of mystery I'm not
[1:05:31] certain that was the only way he could
[1:05:33] be father was be son of man why because
[1:05:36] he's a father of this race of
[1:05:40] people he couldn't be the father of that
[1:05:43] other than be
[1:05:46] Creator Those Old Testament saints were
[1:05:48] not born again Believers right they were
[1:05:52] anointed right right but not bornn again
[1:05:56] Believers that's why they'll be
[1:05:58] servants not born again
[1:06:03] Believers the way God wanted his
[1:06:05] children from Adam he got lost in the
[1:06:08] first day on the day of Pentecost he
[1:06:10] started looking back at what he wanted
[1:06:14] right all right that's
[1:06:20] right
[1:06:23] father
[1:06:25] he had all these attributes in
[1:06:27] him how's he going to get them
[1:06:33] displayed and when the prophet said his
[1:06:35] first creation is himself what's he
[1:06:38] saying is not he simply putting it in
[1:06:41] human
[1:06:42] terminologies to where we will
[1:06:44] comprehend not to confuse us but
[1:06:48] comprehend that God is going to do
[1:06:51] something right he's going to be a
[1:06:54] creation Now we won't get it tonight I
[1:06:56] know
[1:06:57] that's but why does it say to
[1:06:59] Revelations 3:14 and it's speaking of
[1:07:02] Jesus Christ the flesh man that he's the
[1:07:07] beginning of the creation of God and
[1:07:09] that we are the rest of that
[1:07:13] creation that's right when he says back
[1:07:16] here right that the Lost of the AL the
[1:07:19] Son of God is the beginning of the
[1:07:22] creation of God
[1:07:28] you see church do you believe in one God
[1:07:30] or what do you
[1:07:31] believe I don't know there's a father
[1:07:33] and there's a son and there's a Holy
[1:07:34] Ghost and there's
[1:07:38] a but remember we can't be one like your
[1:07:44] finger
[1:07:45] am so here's the
[1:07:52] father right
[1:07:55] right out of the father simply steps the
[1:07:59] form that he wants to use to
[1:08:01] condescend and he calls it logos theop
[1:08:04] the Son of God
[1:08:06] word and then th is where you start
[1:08:10] with the Son of God saying let there
[1:08:14] be it was not the father that said let
[1:08:17] there be he always used a son that's
[1:08:20] what I'm talking about that's why the
[1:08:21] scripture in John 1:18 is saying that
[1:08:23] the only begotten in the
[1:08:25] bosom what does it mean
[1:08:29] bosom oh here here we standing God and
[1:08:32] in his bosom was another
[1:08:36] person in that bosom he steps out of
[1:08:39] that and becomes another person ah you
[1:08:41] got back in your trinitarian
[1:08:47] concept he says he will declare
[1:08:50] him that's right bring him out in the
[1:08:52] open as brother Brandon would say amen
[1:08:54] right all right here's the father never
[1:08:57] be comprehended never be understood
[1:08:59] never be seen because we're on this side
[1:09:02] he's on that side
[1:09:05] right amen right is that right we use
[1:09:08] the Scripture it can't be seen that's
[1:09:10] right no man has seen God at any
[1:09:13] time all
[1:09:17] right out of that father
[1:09:20] steps not another person the same person
[1:09:25] steps over in another
[1:09:30] form I wish every who's got their phone
[1:09:33] fixed on where you wanting to be so nice
[1:09:35] about it to keep it from pling pling
[1:09:39] plinging I mean we got a telephone back
[1:09:41] there if you're not nice enough to cut
[1:09:44] off your phone you think oh my kids
[1:09:46] might get sick and I need to know about
[1:09:47] it what are you going to do
[1:09:51] leave we got a phone back there
[1:09:55] they need us give them the
[1:09:57] number but if I can hear a phone pinging
[1:10:00] and doing this as hard as I am a hearing
[1:10:03] everybody else in the building done
[1:10:04] heard
[1:10:05] it but you ain't going to tell me what
[1:10:07] to do I know that and as this went P
[1:10:10] your mind you won't shut off them phones
[1:10:12] because we ask you to out to I'm going
[1:10:15] to keep my phone on bless
[1:10:18] God well now that's what you call
[1:10:20] stubbornness which in the Bible is
[1:10:22] called witchcraft right
[1:10:26] right you see where it's good to preach
[1:10:29] ain't it real good to preach when
[1:10:30] everything starts going
[1:10:33] wrong I'll let you do it one
[1:10:37] day will you see what I'm talking
[1:10:42] about it's not father doing way and it's
[1:10:46] not him three4
[1:10:48] here but a quarter of him went over here
[1:10:52] or a half or three
[1:10:54] ERS
[1:10:56] no it's the same
[1:10:59] father
[1:11:04] uh
[1:11:06] brother Marlo you're a father
[1:11:10] huh you know there's no way in the world
[1:11:12] you can prove that to me
[1:11:16] tonight right how come mys AR cuz none
[1:11:21] of your kids are
[1:11:22] here
[1:11:24] you can prove that you're a husband cuz
[1:11:26] your wife is sitting there so you can be
[1:11:30] that form of husband and wife but you
[1:11:32] can't be the form tonight of father with
[1:11:35] a bunch of children CU it's not
[1:11:40] here do you understand what I'm getting
[1:11:44] at it wasn't that part of God went
[1:11:47] out and left a part of sticking over
[1:11:50] here and it went over here
[1:11:54] you're not listening to the
[1:11:57] quotes he can be
[1:12:03] omnipresent right right and him be a
[1:12:08] being right why because he is omniscient
[1:12:14] that's right
[1:12:19] amen right am he can be the presid and
[1:12:24] him be a
[1:12:25] being because he's omniscient right that
[1:12:29] knows all things
[1:12:31] right it's not one here and it's up
[1:12:35] no it's God as the Bible as we read the
[1:12:40] son is going
[1:12:42] to bring him out in the open right who's
[1:12:46] he going to bring out in open God the
[1:12:50] father right father
[1:12:54] moves over in another form called a
[1:13:00] son there's something I'm holding right
[1:13:02] there I don't won't say anymore I
[1:13:03] explained it to way
[1:13:06] because you know if something goes wrong
[1:13:09] with me then I don't have to worry about
[1:13:11] it he can explain
[1:13:16] it all
[1:13:17] right cuz he knows my
[1:13:20] thoughts all right something that's very
[1:13:22] very very very valuable to understand
[1:13:27] but I can't bring it
[1:13:28] tonight we're dealing with this and I
[1:13:30] got enough problems as it
[1:13:32] is but out of the father comes the
[1:13:37] son the logos of theophany may I use
[1:13:41] another words your Prophet will use the
[1:13:43] Christ
[1:13:45] amen Amen brother brownon said if you
[1:13:48] can't see Christ in every verse right he
[1:13:53] didn't say say if you can't see the
[1:13:54] father in everse he didn't say if you
[1:13:56] can't see Jesus in every verse he said
[1:13:58] if you can't see Christ in every verse
[1:14:00] so then down to the Old Testament was
[1:14:02] the Christ the logos the theophany the
[1:14:04] Son of God that was in the Tomb in the
[1:14:08] where the fire was at with the Hebrew
[1:14:10] children right the
[1:14:13] Christ he was in the lines Den with
[1:14:15] Daniel the
[1:14:18] Christ
[1:14:19] right but then one day that Christ
[1:14:21] became flesh
[1:14:23] all right come on but
[1:14:27] listen see then it's not
[1:14:29] trinitarianism but it's not Oneness
[1:14:32] because we haven't done away with this
[1:14:34] position if you do away with this
[1:14:36] position and move it all over into
[1:14:37] another position you are a strict
[1:14:40] Oneness I don't give a hoot who says
[1:14:44] well you're
[1:14:46] Oneness if you do away with any part of
[1:14:49] God I want to know where you got that at
[1:14:54] amen I want to know where the audacity
[1:14:57] of a human being would have enough
[1:14:59] stupid sense to think about that they
[1:15:02] could do away with a something of
[1:15:05] God I thought we were making a circle to
[1:15:08] go
[1:15:14] back right
[1:15:18] right but see if you do away with the
[1:15:21] father what are you going to do
[1:15:24] so
[1:15:26] father a part of him if you want to call
[1:15:29] it that's the words of the Prophet moved
[1:15:31] over in another form called a
[1:15:34] son and begin to
[1:15:39] create that's not two people that's one
[1:15:45] person but it's two people the way our
[1:15:47] brains
[1:15:48] go well let's read now we got plenty
[1:15:51] more of these all I ask you you to do is
[1:15:53] go home sometimes and just get it sit
[1:15:55] down and do and just run in logos
[1:15:58] theophany Son of
[1:16:00] God in your computer and just read all
[1:16:03] you want
[1:16:04] to go look what he says here on the it's
[1:16:07] on the adoption we done done to part of
[1:16:09] it and look what he says now what a
[1:16:12] wonderful thing that a man with a s
[1:16:13] great education could tell you what
[1:16:15] happened for the
[1:16:17] world what about a man didn't have no
[1:16:19] education at all could write what
[1:16:21] happened in the garden yeah right
[1:16:24] Moses
[1:16:26] right let's go back a 100 million years
[1:16:30] before there was a star moon or anything
[1:16:34] in the
[1:16:35] world now there was a time when there
[1:16:38] wasn't nothing here it was just all
[1:16:42] forever and
[1:16:44] Eternity and all ever and Eternity was
[1:16:48] God he was there in the
[1:16:52] beginning all
[1:16:54] right let's go on the edge of the
[1:16:56] banister and watch he says no man has
[1:16:58] seen the father at any time no man can
[1:17:00] see God in a bodily
[1:17:03] form right because God is not in body
[1:17:09] form keep on reading he talking about
[1:17:13] this kind
[1:17:14] right this kind of bodily form
[1:17:18] right he's not saying he don't have no
[1:17:21] form right
[1:17:24] we'll read on
[1:17:26] down God is not in body form God is a
[1:17:28] spirit is see all right no man has seen
[1:17:30] the father but the only begotten of the
[1:17:33] father had declared him first
[1:17:35] John now just notice now there's nothing
[1:17:38] there's just space there's no light
[1:17:40] there's no dark there's no nothing it
[1:17:43] just seems nothing but in there is a
[1:17:46] great supernatural being amen Jehovah
[1:17:50] God who covered all space and all places
[1:17:53] at all times he was from Everlasting
[1:17:56] from Everlasting he is the beginning of
[1:17:59] the
[1:18:00] creation that's God can't see nothing
[1:18:04] can't hear nothing not a move of an atom
[1:18:07] in the air not nothing not no hour no
[1:18:11] nothing but yet God was there that was
[1:18:14] God now let's watch for a few minutes
[1:18:17] and after a while no man has seen that
[1:18:21] no man has seen the father
[1:18:23] now that's the father that's God the
[1:18:26] father now notice then after a while I
[1:18:29] begin to see a little sacred light begin
[1:18:31] to form like a little Halo or
[1:18:34] something you can only see it by the
[1:18:36] supernatural eyes to look now while
[1:18:38] we're looking the whole church
[1:18:40] now we're standing on a great big
[1:18:43] banister watching what God's doing and
[1:18:46] we'll get right down to the question
[1:18:47] here and you'll see how he brings it in
[1:18:50] now no one has seen God and now the next
[1:18:52] thing thing we begin to see by eyes of
[1:18:55] Supernatural looking we see a little
[1:18:57] white light forming out
[1:18:59] there what is that that was called by
[1:19:03] Bible readers logos are the anointed are
[1:19:07] the
[1:19:08] anointing are the as I was going to say
[1:19:11] the part of God that begin to develop
[1:19:13] into something so human beings could
[1:19:16] have some type of an idea what it was
[1:19:19] that's it now God's going to do that not
[1:19:22] a
[1:19:25] it was a little a little light moving he
[1:19:27] that was the word of God now God gave
[1:19:30] himself birth to his son which was
[1:19:33] before there was even an Adam in or a to
[1:19:37] make an Adam that was see Jesus said
[1:19:40] glorify me father with the glory that we
[1:19:42] had before the foundation of the world
[1:19:44] see way back in
[1:19:46] Yonder he gave himself birth to a
[1:19:49] son that's not a second person right
[1:19:52] amen you see the reason I love to preach
[1:19:55] is this
[1:20:01] way Jesus is not a second person right
[1:20:05] are
[1:20:06] you that have the new birth Sons and
[1:20:09] Daughters of God Amen that's right right
[1:20:14] all right then you just admitted that
[1:20:18] God was in you cuz that's the only way
[1:20:21] you'll ever be a son of God that's right
[1:20:23] that's
[1:20:25] right
[1:20:27] right if that don't blow your head to
[1:20:30] the other way of trying to think how
[1:20:32] much intellect is intellect it's simple
[1:20:36] terminology it's taking away those
[1:20:39] things what s one he said in the
[1:20:42] beginning was the word what the first
[1:20:44] and the Word was God and the Word was
[1:20:45] made flesh and dwelt Among Us God
[1:20:47] unfolding himself down to a human being
[1:20:50] Now watch how he did it now back there
[1:20:53] then when this little Halo comes now you
[1:20:55] can't see nothing yet but just the eyes
[1:20:57] are just Supernatural we see a Halo
[1:20:59] standing there and that's the Son of God
[1:21:02] the Loos now I can
[1:21:04] hear him playing around like a little
[1:21:08] child before the father's door with all
[1:21:13] eternity that's not another God church
[1:21:16] that's
[1:21:18] right if it is we're
[1:21:21] trinitarians right
[1:21:26] that's to where you can say let us make
[1:21:30] man amen in our own
[1:21:37] image and knowing that there's not two
[1:21:42] people well I just can't see how he
[1:21:44] could be a
[1:21:46] son now we're going to get down into
[1:21:49] some
[1:21:51] wordings
[1:21:53] you know that all sons has
[1:21:55] Beginnings that's
[1:22:00] right right am I
[1:22:03] right sons have
[1:22:07] Beginnings that's why we don't believe
[1:22:09] in Eternal sunship
[1:22:11] right but we do believe in what Eternal
[1:22:17] godship is that a quote
[1:22:21] right all
[1:22:24] right sons have Beginnings but remember
[1:22:27] that beginning was not a beginning like
[1:22:29] we think we think the father created the
[1:22:33] son come on are we in the church age
[1:22:35] book about 10 messages later where it
[1:22:38] says that we talk about that and we
[1:22:40] think that one made the other
[1:22:43] one come
[1:22:45] on it wasn't one making the other one it
[1:22:49] was that same God just stepping over
[1:22:52] here
[1:22:53] to unfold
[1:22:55] himself but not leaving a vacuum back
[1:22:57] there or a
[1:23:00] place because you
[1:23:03] see now this is where you better swaller
[1:23:05] and I'll
[1:23:11] quit the father stepping over into the
[1:23:14] son is
[1:23:17] correct but the father creating a son as
[1:23:21] a separate person is is trinitarianism
[1:23:24] right that's
[1:23:27] right
[1:23:30] right
[1:23:31] so his first creation was God himself
[1:23:35] that's
[1:23:35] right then out of God came the Lo Goos
[1:23:38] the theophany
[1:23:41] the the condescending of God down to so
[1:23:45] that we can understand him
[1:23:49] amen see when you start doing away with
[1:23:52] things
[1:23:53] that always gets
[1:23:59] me I've heard that quote all God was now
[1:24:04] brother all means
[1:24:11] all you want to read what we just read
[1:24:14] and say
[1:24:15] all the way you're saying
[1:24:17] it you don't realize that you got a
[1:24:20] trinitarian concept
[1:24:26] CU I
[1:24:30] thought I thought the Bible said that in
[1:24:32] him dwelt the fullness of the godhead
[1:24:34] bodily that's right is that scripture
[1:24:37] now what's the fullness of the godhead
[1:24:40] bodily father son Holy Ghost
[1:24:43] right
[1:24:47] sir I thought the new
[1:24:49] birth was the father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:24:52] coming to live in
[1:24:57] you well that's three
[1:25:00] people no it
[1:25:05] ain't no it
[1:25:07] ain't it's one
[1:25:09] God
[1:25:12] see the condescending of
[1:25:16] God for God to bring himself out in the
[1:25:20] open and then come down on Earth and
[1:25:23] stand there and say if you seen me
[1:25:26] Phillip you've seen the
[1:25:29] father didn't say if you seen me you
[1:25:31] seen the son or
[1:25:34] whatever and he was all of that God
[1:25:36] dwelling right there
[1:25:41] right
[1:25:42] right what do you
[1:25:45] think well you just confused
[1:25:49] me maybe you'll go home and pray right
[1:25:53] why don't you do something for me why
[1:25:56] don't you go home and study and try to
[1:25:59] prove me
[1:26:04] wrong you know that was the way I
[1:26:07] learned a lot of
[1:26:11] things don't tell me you don't do it I'm
[1:26:13] going to call you a liar to your face
[1:26:15] you say I don't do that you do you study
[1:26:18] to show people
[1:26:21] wrong
[1:26:24] you study to show thing people that are
[1:26:26] wrong because you want to show how smart
[1:26:28] you
[1:26:31] are boy I straightened him out on
[1:26:34] that well it's kind of like an old
[1:26:37] brother was comeing here one time goe
[1:26:39] musicians come on the old door used to
[1:26:41] be right here and we were coming in the
[1:26:44] door and I wasn't being sarcastic with a
[1:26:47] brother I loved him and uh I was
[1:26:50] carrying the communion cups and walking
[1:26:52] in in and to the internet people you
[1:26:53] know we use many cups but I wouldn't
[1:26:55] care if they want one cup we'll go one
[1:26:57] cup don't worry about it but I found out
[1:26:59] Tabernacle use many cups so we don't
[1:27:01] worry about that but anyhow we started
[1:27:03] in the church that old brother he he
[1:27:05] looked down he seen them cups and he
[1:27:07] says brother
[1:27:08] Dale he said all the Believers of the
[1:27:10] message use one
[1:27:14] cup well I had a good time to went
[1:27:17] through all of the things with him
[1:27:19] wouldn't I that they what did they do at
[1:27:21] the Tabernacle at make brother Brown a
[1:27:22] false prophet if it had to be done this
[1:27:24] way and he done it that or what you know
[1:27:26] what I said to him I just opened the
[1:27:29] door to let him come in I said brother
[1:27:31] we believe part of the
[1:27:36] message
[1:27:37] okay we believe part of the
[1:27:45] message but the ones that's going to get
[1:27:47] out of here is going to know all the
[1:27:48] message not know all the message but
[1:27:50] know the truth is that right what we got
[1:27:53] brother let's stand
[1:27:55] together I'll try to get a little more
[1:27:58] onto this
[1:28:00] later trying to get it down to where we
[1:28:02] can see
[1:28:03] something a beautiful Plan of Redemption
[1:28:07] that has been made known to a little
[1:28:09] bride in the end
[1:28:14] time see then we'll understand one of
[1:28:17] these days why brother brandham would
[1:28:18] say he said you can have the baptism of
[1:28:20] the Holy Ghost every day of your life
[1:28:23] that's a paraphrase quote and it's off
[1:28:25] just a hire but it's close you can have
[1:28:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost every day
[1:28:29] of your life die and go to hell that's
[1:28:32] paraphrase just a high I can't remember
[1:28:34] all of it exactly but it's very
[1:28:38] close and he said you know that Kus had
[1:28:40] the baptism of the Holy Ghost you know
[1:28:43] he named a lot of people in this message
[1:28:46] that later went off and you know what he
[1:28:48] said he said they had the baptism in the
[1:28:50] ho G
[1:28:58] but he said if you're born again you
[1:29:00] can't be
[1:29:04] deceived he said and if you have the
[1:29:06] Holy
[1:29:07] Ghost you cannot deny the
[1:29:12] word now you can say I don't understand
[1:29:14] I don't know what's right and what and
[1:29:16] pray for me but when you say no that
[1:29:18] ain't
[1:29:20] right then right there you're on the
[1:29:23] borderline for good traps and things of
[1:29:27] Satan but I'm trying my best to get us
[1:29:29] to see one
[1:29:31] God because if you remember the thing
[1:29:33] that I was saying there while ago about
[1:29:34] it that I was intending to I had been
[1:29:37] preaching on one God back there in ' 84
[1:29:40] and I was intended to move on into
[1:29:42] preaching some of the son of man and I
[1:29:45] said that day I said if you don't
[1:29:46] understand the Son of God they ain't no
[1:29:48] need of going the son of
[1:29:50] man I said what and it took me five or
[1:29:52] six years before I ever got back to
[1:29:55] preaching on Son of God a son of
[1:29:58] man because I had to preach to one
[1:30:02] God and I'm still preaching one God
[1:30:05] every message is one God cuz that's what
[1:30:07] I believe in we've had one Prophet one
[1:30:10] message one
[1:30:13] God go ahead
[1:30:15] brother there are some
[1:30:20] things I may not
[1:30:26] know there are some
[1:30:31] place that I can't
[1:30:36] go but I I am
[1:30:41] sure of this one
[1:30:46] thing that God is real where I can feel

[1:35:31] go most of you know that I've been going
[1:35:33] to the doctor now for a few months but
[1:35:36] because my heart's out of
[1:35:37] rhythm all right a lot of people's
[1:35:39] heart's out of
[1:35:41] rhythm well we can believe about
[1:35:45] it but they put me on blood thiner I
[1:35:49] told the doctor I said I go along with
[1:35:51] your program because I believe in
[1:35:52] medical
[1:35:53] science I said
[1:35:56] but I know who's been taking care of me
[1:35:59] all these 74
[1:36:02] years well I didn't know what he going
[1:36:04] to say he said I depend on him
[1:36:08] too he said when I get back against the
[1:36:10] wall he said I go down I come out with
[1:36:13] the
[1:36:14] answer
[1:36:16] well now they say on February the 2nd
[1:36:20] that they're going to shock my heart try
[1:36:21] to put it back in
[1:36:22] Rhythm so it gives us that long to
[1:36:27] pray right what are you are you scared
[1:36:30] brother Dale
[1:36:31] no what is it to be scared
[1:36:35] of
[1:36:39] death the only fear I'd have in any form
[1:36:42] I do is for to leave you my family the
[1:36:46] kids the grandkid that's only fear I
[1:36:48] have no
[1:36:49] fear when I had that attacked and hit me
[1:36:52] down in the
[1:36:54] woods I just went out and sat down by
[1:36:57] the campfire I said just as good a place
[1:37:00] as anywhere to go from I'm not afraid of
[1:37:05] dying that end Ender that was done away
[1:37:08] a long time
[1:37:12] ago but I'm just afraid that we don't
[1:37:16] put all of our confidence in
[1:37:18] him and that's what I want to do yeah
[1:37:22] you pray that it'll all be back well
[1:37:24] brother Dale what if it ain't all back
[1:37:26] well okay I ain't going to worry about
[1:37:27] it I'll let him shock my
[1:37:29] heart unless the Lord tells me between
[1:37:32] now and then to not do it if he tells me
[1:37:36] I'll tell them they're not going to do
[1:37:38] it and they told me that I had
[1:37:41] leukemia I didn't ask them what and how
[1:37:43] much or what it do I said we'll go along
[1:37:46] with your program but there will be no
[1:37:50] chemo
[1:37:53] because I said I'm on this side of the
[1:37:55] business you're over there what good
[1:37:57] does it do with Kyo extend you 3 months
[1:37:59] 6 months I said we're too I'm too
[1:38:04] old well come find out I had the kind of
[1:38:07] they say you'll die with
[1:38:09] well well don't I care where I die with
[1:38:12] it or without
[1:38:14] it they can't prove it I got it because
[1:38:16] all they can do is go by their test and
[1:38:19] it goes like this it'll be up and it'll
[1:38:22] be
[1:38:23] down and I just
[1:38:27] life that's why when I go into the
[1:38:29] doctor's office I'm not going
[1:38:33] in can't stand it they say how you doing
[1:38:36] I'm doing
[1:38:37] wonderful okay I got fussed out long
[1:38:39] enough to where I do I go in I say Doc
[1:38:42] I'm feeling
[1:38:44] wonderful but I got a bad cough can you
[1:38:48] help
[1:38:50] me
[1:38:52] see I'm not agreeing with them then
[1:38:54] because all the doctors I go to know one
[1:38:56] thing for
[1:38:58] sure they are not the healers cuz I tell
[1:39:02] them they're the help and why can't
[1:39:07] we brother brandom come up you know I
[1:39:09] told you I was going to preach one of
[1:39:10] these days on that comparing Divine
[1:39:11] Healing and and natural doctors medicine
[1:39:15] man walks up to brother brandom and said
[1:39:16] I got this problem he said there's a
[1:39:19] doctor right down here that specialist
[1:39:21] izes in that
[1:39:25] operation why didn't the prophet say
[1:39:27] you're
[1:39:29] healed you know what he was healed it
[1:39:32] just had to go through that
[1:39:34] doctor but you understand we want to
[1:39:37] quote the prophet but do we quote where
[1:39:39] brother Rand said you have no right to
[1:39:42] go to be pray for until you've been to
[1:39:44] the doctor
[1:39:46] first now we don't put it that way to
[1:39:49] where that we do it we put it where one
