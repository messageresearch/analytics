[40:51] stand here and speak to you and God
[40:53] bless you brother Samuel good to see you
[40:54] and the church here god bless you and
[40:56] just want to look here this morning the
[40:58] book of Romans the sixth chapter and the
[41:01] first verse Paul here writing says what
[41:04] shall we say then shall we continue in
[41:07] sin that grace may abound
[41:09] god forbid how shall we that are dead to
[41:13] sin live any longer therein
[41:17] know ye not that so many of us as were
[41:19] baptized into Jesus Christ were baptized
[41:23] into his death therefore we are buried
[41:25] with him by baptism into death that like
[41:29] as Christ was raised up from the dead by
[41:31] the glory of the Father I love this even
[41:34] so we also should walk in the newness of
[41:39] life so what I love here is Paul is
[41:41] showing you that serving the Lord is not
[41:43] taking away your life but it's actually
[41:46] giving you life if you've been planted
[41:49] together in the likeness of his death we
[41:51] shall also be in the life of his
[41:54] resurrection now knowing this that our
[41:57] old man is crucified with him that the
[42:00] body of sin might be destroyed that
[42:03] henceforth we should not serve sin for
[42:07] he that is dead is freed from sin now if
[42:09] we be dead with Christ we believe that
[42:11] we shall also live with him knowing that
[42:13] Christ being raised from the dead
[42:15] Dyess no more death hath no more
[42:17] dominion over him friend that he died he
[42:20] died unto sin once but in that he lived
[42:23] liveth he liveth unto God likewise
[42:25] reckon ye also yourselves to be dead
[42:27] indeed unto sin but alive unto God
[42:30] through Jesus Christ our Lord I think
[42:34] this is a powerful thing he says let not
[42:36] sin therefore reign in your mortal body
[42:38] that you should not obey it in the lusts
[42:41] thereof neither yield ye your members as
[42:44] instruments of unrighteousness under sin
[42:47] but yield yourselves unto God as those
[42:50] that are alive from the dead and your
[42:52] members as righteous as your members as
[42:55] righteousness under God fresh for sin
[42:58] shall not have dominion over you for ye
[43:01] are not under the law but under grace
[43:03] well then shall we sin because we are
[43:06] not under the law but under grace god
[43:09] forbid in the book of matthew the fifth
[43:11] chapter we just have one verse we would
[43:14] like to read there and we'll let you be
[43:15] seated and then how many come to receive
[43:18] something from the Lord today amen in
[43:20] the book of Matthew the fifth chapter we
[43:22] want to look here in the sixth verse
[43:24] very familiar scripture I'm sure we
[43:27] could all quote it by memory this
[43:29] morning
[43:30] but in Matthew the fifth chapter in the
[43:32] six verse Jesus you're speaking the
[43:34] Sermon on the Mount in the Beatitudes
[43:36] and blessed are they which do hunger and
[43:41] thirst after righteousness for they
[43:44] shall fall a shall be filled hey man we
[43:49] asked Lord this morning to add the
[43:50] blessing to the reading of his word as
[43:53] you may have your seats this morning we
[43:55] thank the Lord for the reading of the
[43:57] word of God amen
[43:58] the Word of God we believe is inspired
[44:01] we believe it's true we believe it's
[44:03] infallible we believe it's an arrant we
[44:05] believe it's the perfect Word of God
[44:06] we've come here this morning
[44:08] amen to receive from that word and I
[44:10] just want to for a few moments here
[44:12] speak to you from these scriptures and
[44:14] if I will title it this morning I'd like
[44:16] to talk to you on satisfied by being
[44:19] identified satisfied by being identified
[44:24] very much a well aware the world we're
[44:28] living in today there's two types of
[44:29] people there is there is a people that
[44:32] is satisfied and then there is a people
[44:34] that is dissatisfied amen there's a
[44:36] people Amen that are content there is a
[44:39] people that is happy there is a people
[44:41] that is a prospering that is growing
[44:43] that is going somewhere and at the same
[44:46] time there is a people that is
[44:47] dissatisfied and I I think it's quite
[44:49] amazing that we look around in our rural
[44:51] today and we find that even in our
[44:54] government it is dissatisfied and
[44:56] politics it is dissatisfied education it
[45:00] is dissatisfied and the thing about it
[45:02] is is then when when one person is just
[45:04] satisfied then people begin to satisfy
[45:07] them try to try to do something to
[45:08] satisfy them everybody
[45:10] eight minutes trying to satisfy each
[45:12] other can you say man and when we look
[45:15] here at the word satisfied it means to
[45:18] meet the expectations the needs or the
[45:21] desires of someone it means to fulfill a
[45:23] desire or a need it means to provide
[45:26] someone with adequate information or
[45:29] proof so that they are convinced about
[45:32] something adequately meet or comply with
[45:36] a condition an obligation of the man or
[45:39] it means to pay off a debt or to satisfy
[45:41] amen
[45:43] redditor so the word satisfied could
[45:45] actually mean convinced bourbon would
[45:47] sit this way he would preach a message
[45:49] called convinced and then concerned he
[45:51] would say I am convinced that this is
[45:53] God I am convinced that Jesus is coming
[45:56] I am convinced that this is his first
[45:58] appearing in the form of the Holy Ghost
[46:01] in the last days because the Prophet
[46:03] said it shall be light in the evening
[46:05] time I am convinced he meant that the
[46:08] Scriptures is fulfilled I am convinced
[46:10] that the world's on the threshold of
[46:12] destruction I'll think of this in 1962
[46:16] he's telling us that the world is on the
[46:19] verge of destruction and he's convinced
[46:21] to that he said but at the same time I
[46:24] am convinced Amen that the coming of the
[46:26] Lord is at hand
[46:28] Amen I am convinced that we have what we
[46:31] have is the Holy Ghost so this morning
[46:33] young people Amen we have not come
[46:35] together ain't meant to convince you of
[46:37] a Creed we have not come together to
[46:39] convince you of a dog more to convince
[46:41] you of some Church idea
[46:43] Amen but we have come here this morning
[46:45] that you may see they meant that the
[46:47] resurrected Lord Jesus Christ is not a
[46:49] God of history Amen he's not a
[46:51] historical God but he is an ever-present
[46:54] help in the time of trouble now amen you
[46:57] must realize this morning that that
[46:59] satisfaction amen or that convincing
[47:02] must be in your soul it's not good
[47:04] enough amen just to be convinced in your
[47:06] flesh it's not good enough Amen just to
[47:09] be convinced in your spirit but you've
[47:10] got to be convinced in your soul a meant
[47:13] because the soul is the place where the
[47:16] Holy Ghost has got to seal and then the
[47:18] Holy Ghost does not seal your flesh off
[47:20] it does not seal your spirit but it will
[47:22] seal your soul amen until the day every
[47:25] day I mean can we can we preach this
[47:28] morning amen and I think that's what
[47:30] we've come together for a mint there's a
[47:32] lot of things we could tell you you need
[47:33] we could tell you Amen that you need an
[47:36] education and that'll only satisfy your
[47:38] temporary we could tell you that you
[47:40] need a a job that'll that'll pay you a
[47:42] lot of money that will only satisfy
[47:44] temporary amen but we have come there
[47:46] this morning to tell you
[47:47] meant that if you get the holy ghost
[47:49] amen it is not a temporary satisfaction
[47:52] it is not a partial satisfaction but the
[47:55] Holy Ghost is an eternal satisfaction
[47:58] that will put an assurance of convincing
[48:01] in your soul Amen that no matter what
[48:03] tomorrow holds I know who holds tomorrow
[48:06] Amen mind to think this morning that we
[48:08] have get it here
[48:09] Amen not that just our flesh would be
[48:11] fed we have not come that just our
[48:14] spirits would be fed Amen but we have
[48:17] come that our souls would be fair I
[48:19] think here of how that David would say
[48:21] in the Book of Psalms 42 verse 1 he
[48:24] would say as the heart panteth after the
[48:25] water Brooks he would say so panis now
[48:28] that word panis means too long for amen
[48:31] so in other words he's saying so my soul
[48:33] isn't longing after the old God he would
[48:36] say my soul thirsteth for God now notice
[48:39] what David says he says my soul
[48:42] thirsteth for the Living God amen when
[48:45] shall I come and appear before God in
[48:48] the message thirst he said not some
[48:50] historical or something that happened
[48:53] some years ago or some tale that someone
[48:55] told but for the Living God somebody say
[48:58] the Living God he meant for the Living
[49:01] God a god that's ever-present and his so
[49:04] first it for that God not for some
[49:06] historical something now in Psalm 63
[49:09] verse 1 David goes on to say O God thou
[49:12] art my god and early will I seek thee my
[49:15] soul is thirsty for thee my my flesh is
[49:19] longing for the and a dry and thirsty
[49:21] land where no water is amen see I think
[49:26] this morning what we've come here for is
[49:27] because our souls amen is crying out
[49:30] amen our souls amen is needing a drink
[49:33] of water now let me sit this way
[49:35] Amen I'm gonna preach amen and if I
[49:37] gotta do the preaching and the amen and
[49:39] it's gonna take twice as long to get out
[49:41] of here amen so if I preach and you Amen
[49:44] we'll get downstairs and eat a lot
[49:45] quicker amen amen now think of this our
[49:47] souls amen our screaming out they meant
[49:50] our souls are crying amen for something
[49:53] this morning amen and the world is in
[49:55] the same condition amen
[49:57] morning their soul is crying out and
[49:59] then their soul is trying to find
[50:01] somewhere Amen that they can find
[50:03] satisfaction and do you realize what
[50:05] that first is doing it is driving them
[50:08] to the worldly pleasures amen but thank
[50:10] God this morning young people that the
[50:12] first inside of your soul it did not
[50:14] drive you to the things of the world
[50:16] this morning amen but the first in your
[50:19] soul and it has driven you into the
[50:21] house of God amen that the word could
[50:24] penetrate that alive and could change
[50:26] you
[50:27] amen could satisfy you Amen I don't know
[50:29] about you this morning but I want a
[50:31] drink of that water hey man hey I want a
[50:33] drink of the water I I want to go
[50:35] somewhere this morning
[50:36] amen where my soul cannot just be
[50:38] stimulated where my soul cannot just
[50:41] receive a feeling Amen but there might
[50:43] come a satisfaction in the message life
[50:47] with him since now but God is great
[50:49] economy for mankind has made man in
[50:52] their way that he wanted man to beat now
[50:54] he made man to first amen do realize
[50:56] young people you were actually made you
[50:59] were actually created to thirst amen now
[51:02] that first he said did you notice David
[51:04] said my soul thirsteth for thee just
[51:06] imagine my soul is thirsty god I am
[51:09] thirsting for you just like I was in a
[51:11] land where there was no water he must
[51:13] find water a mental parish now you see
[51:16] Amen if you've got a thirst this morning
[51:18] you've got one of two options admit
[51:20] you're either going to find water and
[51:22] you're going to live or you're going to
[51:24] perish since God made a man with a
[51:28] thirst that's a part of the human being
[51:31] is his thirst but God made the thirst in
[51:33] man to thirst for God and the devil has
[51:37] perverted it and make it thirst for his
[51:40] kingdom for the world do you get it the
[51:43] first in man is godly for God made the
[51:47] man to first amen now we find then that
[51:49] God gives the control tower to you he
[51:52] gives to you the things that you need
[51:54] now the control tower in you is what
[51:56] directs you and his thirst runs in on
[51:59] control tower and tells you what you
[52:01] have need of spiritually speaking now
[52:03] the control tower is in the body and in
[52:06] the soul also he said there is a
[52:09] trol tower in the body that tells the
[52:11] need in your body and it's brought to
[52:14] you by first also there is a control
[52:16] tower in your soul that tells you the
[52:18] spiritual things that you have need of
[52:20] something in your spirits and you buy
[52:23] this can tell what kind of life is
[52:26] controlling you Amen seat then you
[52:28] cannot have an unholy ruler on the
[52:31] control tower and that unholy ruler
[52:34] Drive you ain't meant to a holy first he
[52:37] meant you cannot have a holy ruler on
[52:39] the tower ain't meant and that a holy
[52:41] ruler drive you to an unholy first see
[52:44] aim it the control tower or the one
[52:46] that's on the control tower is what is
[52:49] going to drive you to the thing that
[52:51] satisfy the thirst he said when you can
[52:53] see he meant what your desires are than
[52:56] you can tell by that what kind of
[52:58] something that's in you that's creating
[53:00] this desire that you have Amen seat
[53:03] there is a certain thing that you thirst
[53:04] for it can tell you and your so what
[53:06] your desire is and by the nature of the
[53:09] thirst you have I hope you can
[53:11] understand that you are women this
[53:13] morning they meant that if something
[53:15] does not change on my heart even if
[53:17] something that's not changing the soul
[53:19] ain't meant then the thing that's
[53:21] controlling you is going to drive you
[53:24] amen I think of how that God the
[53:26] probably God said God created the first
[53:28] amen will you agree with me that God
[53:30] created that first how many how many
[53:32] thirsty here this morning amen let me
[53:34] just stop see if you ain't first ain't
[53:35] no need preaching on thirsty are you
[53:37] thirsty this morning amen are you hungry
[53:39] this morning
[53:40] amen then that is not something you did
[53:43] on your own that is something God
[53:45] created in you amen seat now God created
[53:49] that first Amen in the profit sense but
[53:51] Satan come in and he perverted the first
[53:54] you look with me in Romans 1:25 the
[53:56] Bible says who changed now that word
[53:58] changed actually means exchanged Amen so
[54:02] who exchanged the truth of God into a
[54:04] lie and worshipped and served the
[54:07] creature more than the Creator who is
[54:09] blessed forever a man now for this cause
[54:12] God gave them up to vile affections for
[54:15] even their women did change the natural
[54:16] use into that which is against nature
[54:19] and likewise also the me
[54:21] leaving the natural use of the woman
[54:23] burned in their lust one toward another
[54:24] men with men working that which is
[54:27] unseemly and receiving in themselves
[54:29] that recompence of their error which was
[54:32] meet and even as they did not like to
[54:35] retain God in their knowledge Amen God
[54:38] gave them over to a reprobate mind and
[54:40] Paul says to do things which are not
[54:43] convenient now you gotta agree with me
[54:45] they meant that reading Romans one right
[54:47] there is describing Amen that day and
[54:50] the hour we're living in it is
[54:53] describing the world we're living in see
[54:56] because there was a thirst there he
[54:58] meant because there was a God created
[55:00] first there he meant they were driven by
[55:03] that first but because they did not find
[55:05] the place where that first could be
[55:07] satisfied he meant the Bible says that
[55:09] God give them up
[55:11] amen God give them up amen and then Paul
[55:13] says God gave them over see what
[55:15] happened was they were given over to a
[55:18] perverted thirst you see what that word
[55:21] perverted means it needs to be changed
[55:23] over it means to be made something
[55:25] different the body God will say when God
[55:27] made everything in the Garden of Eden
[55:29] it was lovely then when Satan come in
[55:31] and perverted he said see Satan cannot
[55:34] create nothing there is only one creator
[55:36] and that's God but Satan perverts the
[55:39] original creation and now he's got into
[55:42] this perverting the original creation of
[55:44] first he said seat now a woman as I said
[55:47] before she wants to be pretty Amen
[55:49] there's nothing wrong with it whether
[55:50] young girl desiring to be pretty Amen
[55:53] that was something that God placed in
[55:55] her there's nothing wrong with a young
[55:57] man desiring success ain't been desiring
[56:00] to go somewhere there was something that
[56:01] was placed in him amen but see if you
[56:04] don't dart that first he meant with the
[56:06] Holy Ghost in the devil will pervert
[56:08] that verse and he will exchange that
[56:10] first for a holy first until an unholy
[56:13] for are you with me this morning ain't
[56:15] it seat by the way they are on the
[56:17] streets hair cut like a man wearing
[56:19] man's clothes man turned around wearing
[56:20] women's clothes now come on you got to
[56:23] preach with me this morning
[56:25] amen it's it's not a mystery that man
[56:27] looks like women today and women look
[56:29] like me and amen amen it's almost
[56:31] dangerous to say sir
[56:32] ma'am anymore amen because you don't
[56:34] know what you're talking to admit but
[56:36] you see what it is it's an example Amen
[56:39] that first has driven them there and
[56:41] then they were thirsting for something
[56:43] and that first has driven them to where
[56:44] they are today Amen see he said women
[56:47] we're wearing men's clothes and men
[56:50] wearing women's clothes and a haircut
[56:51] like a woman see it's a perversion the
[56:54] whole thing is perverted your food is
[56:57] perverted
[56:57] he said the life is perverted your first
[57:00] perverted your desires perverted it's a
[57:02] day of perversion it's a day of
[57:06] perversion amen oh we find them that in
[57:09] these last days there are two spirits at
[57:11] work in this age he would say the two
[57:14] spirits one of them is God's holy
[57:17] spirits and the other one is the devil's
[57:19] spirit working in deception he said the
[57:21] people of the earth are now making their
[57:24] choice than if I could somehow or
[57:26] another Amen maybe get it across to you
[57:28] this morning that this is not just a
[57:30] service Amen this is not just a youth
[57:33] meeting this is not just two coming
[57:35] together to fellowship a ment but this
[57:37] is a decision time amen this is a choice
[57:40] time this is a time Amen where you're
[57:43] either going to choose Christ amen or
[57:45] you're going to choose the devil this is
[57:47] a time where you're going to choose the
[57:49] Holy Ghost and you're going to choose a
[57:51] life of holiness or you're going to
[57:53] choose a life of perversion amen and
[57:55] I'll say this you will not control that

[1:01:42] realize what that does that describes a
[1:01:44] meant a life without the Spirit of God
[1:01:47] it describes a young man without the
[1:01:50] Spirit of God it describes a young lady
[1:01:53] Amen without the Spirit of God it is a
[1:01:56] life without form it is the life that is
[1:01:58] void
[1:01:59] it is a lot for this Park remember can I
[1:02:02] tell you that's not the way you gotta

[1:02:08] moves it will move you a mint from
[1:02:11] harmlessness and voidness and emptiness
[1:02:14] and darkness into a Garden of Eden in
[1:02:18] Genesis the first chapter the Spirit of
[1:02:21] God moved upon the face of the waters
[1:02:23] and the Bible said in the beginning back
[1:02:25] there that this world was without form
[1:02:27] and was void you ever been there before
[1:02:28] and then have you ever been there where
[1:02:30] you felt like your life was just was
[1:02:32] just without any purpose ain't it when
[1:02:34] you felt like the day and then the
[1:02:36] things you were doing without any
[1:02:37] purpose have you ever been there Amen
[1:02:39] you know what that is that is the first
[1:02:42] that is the first in your soul that is
[1:02:45] telling you you was brought up on this
[1:02:47] earth for a purpose Amen I think there
[1:02:49] was nothing just darkness and chaos
[1:02:51] what a horrible shape it must have been
[1:02:53] and nothing Amen go away in the darkness
[1:02:55] shondor notice this earth that we're
[1:02:57] sitting all right can I preach to you
[1:02:59] this morning
[1:03:00] Amen how many loves to go sightseeing

[1:03:12] amen there's all kinds of beautiful
[1:03:14] things but do you realize at one point
[1:03:15] it was not like that
[1:03:17] hey Minton you realize at one point it
[1:03:19] was not a beauty spot it was not at all
[1:03:21] it was a formlessness it was a voidness
[1:03:24] it had no Beauty to it Amen but the
[1:03:27] Bible said he meant that the Spirit of
[1:03:29] God moves and when the Spirit of God
[1:03:31] moved it moved the world from nothing
[1:03:34] into something and I see this morning
[1:03:37] that same spirit is in this building
[1:03:39] today maybe you may be here you may be
[1:03:42] feeling like you're void you may be
[1:03:44] feeling like you're empty but the Spirit
[1:03:47] of God is here this morning amen to move
[1:03:49] you amen from chaos into the power of
[1:03:53] the resurrection of Jesus Christ I say
[1:03:55] this morning come on in Holy Ghost I say
[1:03:58] come on in this morning amen move across
[1:04:00] our young man young ladies move across
[1:04:03] our elders move across the church once
[1:04:06] again the power of God amen transform
[1:04:10] amen hearts and lives amen see said no
[1:04:13] it was dark and then there was no light
[1:04:16] he said there was wandering star twisted
[1:04:19] around the orbits out there somewhere it
[1:04:21] must have been attacked it must have
[1:04:23] been a terrific mass or something lost
[1:04:25] like it was didn't find its way and
[1:04:27] that's the way we become when we become
[1:04:29] wandering stars away from God just
[1:04:32] without hope without God without just
[1:04:34] just churning around out in darkness not
[1:04:37] knowing where we're going see and I took
[1:04:40] that great chaos of darkness and he
[1:04:43] transformed it into the Garden of Eden
[1:04:46] see by his word then that's how we are
[1:04:49] transformed is by God's Word it done the
[1:04:53] perfect will of God for it was
[1:04:55] transformed Amen from a chaos into a
[1:04:59] Garden of Eden by the Word of God amen
[1:05:01] now think of this amen until the Spirit
[1:05:04] of God moved up on this hurt it was not
[1:05:06] serving any purpose he meant it was not
[1:05:08] doing anything it was just turning it
[1:05:10] was just wandering it was just moving a
[1:05:12] Mentos in the Spirit of God Oh
[1:05:15] mercy when the Spirit of God moved upon
[1:05:17] it it actually moved it ain't meant from
[1:05:21] just being there to being in the perfect
[1:05:23] will of God now he wants to transform us
[1:05:27] this morning do you believe that how
[1:05:29] does he want to transform us he wants to
[1:05:32] transform us by the renewing of our
[1:05:34] minds see now Satan comes in and puts in
[1:05:37] a deforming to the word but the prana
[1:05:39] God said see is this that the DES former
[1:05:42] came in to how many knows that it took
[1:05:44] six thousand years to create the surface
[1:05:46] took six thousand years Marissa said it
[1:05:49] took the Creator six thousand years he
[1:05:51] said with the original word to bring
[1:05:53] forth every word he said is that right
[1:05:55] is that they said now see the DES former
[1:05:58] came in and as God had took six thousand
[1:06:01] years Amen with the original word to
[1:06:03] bring forth every word of his kind
[1:06:06] everything that he made would be God's
[1:06:08] own word bringing forth of its kind
[1:06:09] now the deformers somebody say the de
[1:06:11] former now the de former has took six
[1:06:15] thousand years amen and is to form the
[1:06:18] Word of God and what has he done he has
[1:06:20] brought his self to a new type of Eden
[1:06:24] he said it's now Satan's Eden amen
[1:06:27] that's where we're living today he meant
[1:06:29] brother if you can give me more back in
[1:06:30] my ear I'd appreciate it
[1:06:31] amen see he was brought himself to a new
[1:06:34] type of Eden now think of this the
[1:06:37] Spirit of God moved and changed the
[1:06:40] world
[1:06:40] amen from a chaos to a Garden of Eden
[1:06:43] but in the last days amen the deformers
[1:06:46] going to come in this stage in the world
[1:06:48] truly the end and he's going to
[1:06:49] transform it or deform it rather from a
[1:06:52] Garden of Eden in this Satan's eater
[1:06:54] amen now let me just go and preach her
[1:06:56] to you for a second and then because the
[1:06:58] devil hates you are you awake you got a
[1:07:03] pulse
[1:07:04] admit the devil hates you you know why
[1:07:06] he hates you it's because you are living
[1:07:09] in the middle of Satan's Eden now think
[1:07:12] of this Amen and you're controlling him
[1:07:15] in his own either
[1:07:17] right here in his own Eden there is a
[1:07:20] young man there is a young lady there is
[1:07:23] a young man there is a young lady that
[1:07:25] is living right here in the middle of
[1:07:27] all this chaos but they've not been
[1:07:29] given to that chaos because they've been
[1:07:32] called by the Spirit of God my then I
[1:07:35] think of how in this day we're living in
[1:07:37] an Satan's Eden how the problem of God
[1:07:39] is going to come with not a casual
[1:07:42] message he is not going to come with a
[1:07:44] lukewarm message but he is going to come
[1:07:46] with a message of zeal he is going to
[1:07:49] come with a message of passion he is
[1:07:51] going to come with a message of fire
[1:07:52] amen to declare the church it is now
[1:07:55] time to arise to your identification
[1:07:58] amen let me just tell you this morning
[1:08:00] you're not just a school student Amen
[1:08:02] you are not just you are not just a
[1:08:04] teenager young man you are not just a
[1:08:06] young boy this morning Amen you are the
[1:08:08] Church of the Living God
[1:08:10] you like the pride of Jesus Christ and
[1:08:12] bad now see this morning it is time to
[1:08:15] rise up it is time to rise up it is time
[1:08:20] to stand in the position that God has
[1:08:23] called you in
[1:08:24] amen I'll just share this with you as I
[1:08:26] was as I was coming home from some
[1:08:27] meetings last week and I was praying and
[1:08:29] just listening to a tape and this let's
[1:08:31] just begin to unfold to me it's a tape
[1:08:33] called identified with Christ amen and
[1:08:35] then I don't know about you but I love
[1:08:37] those tapes amen in the message
[1:08:39] identified with Christ but they're going
[1:08:40] to come along and he's going to say now
[1:08:42] he's going to read Romans six and he
[1:08:45] said now if I should take a text not for
[1:08:47] about 20 minutes I would say this
[1:08:49] identification identified with Christ
[1:08:52] now what amazed me is when Billy Graham
[1:08:54] actually begins to speak on
[1:08:56] identification and then he doesn't
[1:08:58] automatically go into identification he
[1:09:00] starts with satisfaction he says you
[1:09:02] know there is in the country today so
[1:09:04] many dissatisfied people it's amazing
[1:09:07] when you get around and find out so much
[1:09:09] dissatisfaction
[1:09:11] people hardly know what they want to do
[1:09:13] amen they come down the road in about 70
[1:09:16] 80 miles an hour in a 30-mile hours home
[1:09:19] slide the brakes turn around the corner
[1:09:21] start up with such speed we're all
[1:09:24] guilty a that until they burn a new
[1:09:27] tires half off now you want to know
[1:09:28] something there's a difference in
[1:09:30] somebody that's
[1:09:30] the paying for their own tires amen and
[1:09:33] mom and daddy still paying for it are
[1:09:36] you with me
[1:09:36] I mean if mom and daddy's still paying
[1:09:38] for them they're making doughnuts and
[1:09:39] burnouts and everything remember when
[1:09:41] they're paying for their own tires and
[1:09:43] then they don't hit that 70
[1:09:44] mile-per-hour zone so quick all right
[1:09:47] with me
[1:09:47] Ben see but because they're trying to
[1:09:49] find satisfaction amen see they'll go
[1:09:51] with city block he said they'll go crazy
[1:09:53] to go sit and talk a while seems like
[1:09:56] people don't know what they want to do
[1:09:57] now brother Andrew what are you talking
[1:10:00] about see what they're doing is they're
[1:10:01] trying to achieve something
[1:10:03] amen they're trying to achieve something
[1:10:04] now what is the greatest thing that we
[1:10:07] can achieve if I would pass this
[1:10:09] microphone around this morning and I
[1:10:11] would ask you what's the greatest thing
[1:10:12] once again ain't no doubt with this many
[1:10:14] people there will be different answers
[1:10:15] amen but let's go back to what the
[1:10:17] Prophet said he said the greatest thing
[1:10:20] we can achieve is life somebody shot
[1:10:23] life life is the greatest thing that we
[1:10:25] could achieve see if you would go to
[1:10:27] heaven this morning and you would walk
[1:10:29] around by the weight and you would find
[1:10:30] Abraham you would say Abraham what's the
[1:10:33] greatest name he would say life admit no
[1:10:36] matter what anything else a mental life
[1:10:38] is the greatest thing that anyone could
[1:10:41] achieve amen now see when you've got a
[1:10:43] life then there comes a struggle with
[1:10:45] wives and then I think it's amazing how
[1:10:47] can overcome but it says what are you
[1:10:49] living for he said so you can I he said
[1:10:52] what are you struggling for so you can
[1:10:54] live what are you living for so you can
[1:10:55] die he said wouldn't it be most foolish
[1:10:58] if we didn't make Christ our absolutes
[1:11:00] Amen now think of this this morning
[1:11:02] church we are going to struggle to live
[1:11:05] all right young people maybe y'all know
[1:11:08] what I'm talking about they go around
[1:11:09] saying this struggle is real
[1:11:11] are you hearing me and then they ain't
[1:11:13] got a clue about what they're talking
[1:11:14] about and then they're just going around
[1:11:15] saying something amen all right you got
[1:11:17] a kid eight minutes going to school
[1:11:19] don't have to pay no bills amen each
[1:11:21] each mom and daddys food amen don't have
[1:11:24] no phone bill they got mama paying the
[1:11:26] and then they go around saying the
[1:11:27] struggle is real and I come on
[1:11:29] yes struggle ain't real they don't know
[1:11:30] what a struggle is amen
[1:11:32] but you want to talk about a real
[1:11:33] struggle a real struggle is when you set
[1:11:35] forth the foot to serve God amen a real
[1:11:38] struggle is when you surrender your life
[1:11:40] to the lordship of Jesus Christ amen
[1:11:43] I'm looking at some young people this
[1:11:44] morning that knows what the struggle is
[1:11:46] and then they know what it's like to
[1:11:48] live in this world they know what it's
[1:11:50] like to feel the pressures of hell amen
[1:11:52] but at the same time there is a holy God
[1:11:54] inside of them that is sustaining them
[1:11:57] that is keeping them that is providing
[1:12:00] for them that is guiding them in the
[1:12:03] midst of a chaotic world oh there is
[1:12:05] some young people here this morning that
[1:12:07] knows what the struggle is they met they
[1:12:09] they they are witnesses Amen that there
[1:12:11] is a God that will release an overcoming
[1:12:13] power in your life my I said see that
[1:12:16] then there becomes a struggle now what
[1:12:18] is that struggle it is living between
[1:12:20] desires
[1:12:21] do you realize what produces the
[1:12:24] dissatisfaction in the life of people is
[1:12:28] living between two desires he said see
[1:12:31] that control tower of the soul that one
[1:12:33] for the body for instance the flesh
[1:12:35] first to satisfy the desires it's in the
[1:12:37] body and the spirit desires for the
[1:12:40] things that's in the soul see and many
[1:12:42] times these war one against the other we
[1:12:44] find there what's a great trouble today
[1:12:47] that too many people try to live between
[1:12:51] two desires a meant for one of them
[1:12:53] desires the things of the earth and the
[1:12:55] other desires the things of heaven and
[1:12:58] then one time as a young man I heard a
[1:12:59] preacher preach a sermon he called it
[1:13:01] cross-eyed Christians and then I want to
[1:13:03] title whatever he's going then she said
[1:13:05] cross-eyed Christians hey man he said a
[1:13:07] cross-eyed Christian Amen is a Christian
[1:13:09] that's got one eye on the world and they
[1:13:11] got one eye on the own heaven and
[1:13:13] they're trying to live between the two
[1:13:15] worlds they're trying to satisfy the
[1:13:17] earth then they're trying to satisfy her
[1:13:19] ain't been there to live it and I'll say
[1:13:21] this this morning amen there's people
[1:13:23] here this morning this building that
[1:13:25] knows what I'm talking about
[1:13:26] amen because you battled the same thing
[1:13:28] they met young people we battle the same
[1:13:30] thing
[1:13:31] Amen to live for God ain't meant to live
[1:13:33] for the devil they meant to fit in with
[1:13:35] my friends or to stand out for Jesus
[1:13:37] Christ amen but can I tell you this
[1:13:39] morning why that every time you try to
[1:13:41] fit in something raised
[1:13:43] inside of you and says you ain't want to
[1:13:44] work every time you try to change who
[1:13:46] you are something speaks in your heart
[1:13:48] and says you're more than that you know
[1:13:51] why because there's a soul in there and
[1:13:53] then there's a thirst in there that's
[1:13:55] telling you you was not born definian he
[1:13:58] was born to stand out Haman he was not
[1:14:00] born to be a part of this chaos the
[1:14:03] Spirit of God is here calling you he is
[1:14:05] here calling you this morning he is here
[1:14:07] to transform you
[1:14:09] amen to think this one of the prophets
[1:14:10] said the world is full of people then it
[1:14:14] become dissatisfied now you know that's
[1:14:16] the truth they mean you go to the store
[1:14:19] I'm just going to preach to you for a
[1:14:21] second one thing that drives me crazy is
[1:14:23] when I go to the store and I stand out
[1:14:25] there brother and I hold the door for

[1:19:27] and you can be satisfied
[1:19:31] amen you see then the first amendment
[1:19:33] doing ok on time amen the thirst in your
[1:19:36] soul amen is becomes becomes the first
[1:19:39] for an example now you realize in this
[1:19:41] world there are two types of examples
[1:19:43] there are good and bad examples now in
[1:19:47] 1st Thessalonians 3 and verse 6 let's
[1:19:49] look at that together
[1:19:50] 1st Thessalonians 3 and 6 Paul writing
[1:19:52] says now we command you brethren in the
[1:19:55] name of our Lord Jesus Christ that you
[1:19:57] withdraw yourselves from every brother
[1:19:59] that walketh disorderly and not after
[1:20:03] the tradition which he received of us
[1:20:05] for yourselves know to follow us for we
[1:20:09] behave ourselves disorderly among you we
[1:20:10] behave ourselves this early among you
[1:20:13] neither did we eat many neither do we
[1:20:15] need any man's bread for nought but
[1:20:18] wrong with labour and travail and they
[1:20:20] not that we be not chargeable to any of
[1:20:24] you now thinking burst not hear of 2nd
[1:20:29] Thessalonians 3 verse 9 now because not
[1:20:32] because we have not power but to make
[1:20:34] ourselves an example unto you to follow
[1:20:37] us now see if the word example there
[1:20:40] means a pattern it means a son it means
[1:20:43] a suggestion of anything representation
[1:20:45] figure copy an example for imitation or
[1:20:48] if the thing to be imitated or other
[1:20:51] thing to be shunned now notice there is
[1:20:53] a good example which is something that
[1:20:55] is to be imitated which is the pattern
[1:20:58] which is the standard which is what you
[1:21:00] should embrace then there is a bad
[1:21:01] example which is to be shunned now when
[1:21:04] Paul was writing to young Timothy in 1st
[1:21:06] Timothy 4:12 he said let no man despise
[1:21:09] thy youth but be thou an example to the
[1:21:12] believers in Word and conversation in
[1:21:14] charity in spirit in faith in purity you
[1:21:17] see not now notice here Amen in the
[1:21:19] Bible there is good examples at the same
[1:21:21] time there are bad examples you lookyou
[1:21:23] me in Hebrews 4:11 the Bible says let us
[1:21:26] labor therefore to enter into that rest
[1:21:27] what is the rest the Holy Ghost lest any
[1:21:30] man fall after the same example of
[1:21:33] unbelief they may not see those that did
[1:21:36] not enter the promised land they set
[1:21:37] forth an example of what unbelief can do
[1:21:41] can hinder you from the promises of God
[1:21:43] you look here at a bruise chapter 4 he
[1:21:45] says what is it he said the pillar of
[1:21:47] fire is here amen the angel of the Lord
[1:21:49] is with us he's doing the very same
[1:21:51] things he said he would do and people
[1:21:53] stumble around and say oh well I guess
[1:21:55] it's all right that's pretty good oh I
[1:21:57] guess it's ok be careful that you don't
[1:21:59] fall in the same snare of unbelief you
[1:22:03] take you with all your heart all right
[1:22:05] now look here amen Sodom and Gomorrah
[1:22:07] amen an example of a city of what
[1:22:10] happens when you welcome in perversion
[1:22:12] amen now we're gonna have Church here
[1:22:14] today okay it's an example when you
[1:22:17] welcome perversion in amen Sodom and
[1:22:19] Gomorrah stands today as an example the
[1:22:22] Bible says turning the cities of Sodom
[1:22:25] and Gomorrah into ashes condemned them
[1:22:26] with an overthrow making them an example
[1:22:30] unto those that after should live
[1:22:32] ungodly Oh Church when you look at Luke
[1:22:35] 17 31 in that day he saw where he saw me
[1:22:38] up on the housetop and his staff in the
[1:22:40] house stuff in the house let him not
[1:22:42] come down to take it away and he that is
[1:22:44] in the field let him I Christ not return
[1:22:46] back now he says remember Lot's wife
[1:22:48] said that with me together remember
[1:22:50] Lot's wife amen remember now why would
[1:22:53] he say remember Lot's wife Amen because
[1:22:56] Lot's wife is going to become an example
[1:22:59] of what happens to a person when they
[1:23:01] look back the Bible says
[1:23:04] remember Lot's wife she merely looked
[1:23:06] over her shoulder Eve merely stopped for
[1:23:08] a moment that's all she done Lot's wife
[1:23:10] just looked back and God turned that
[1:23:13] righteous man not his wife Amen to a
[1:23:15] pillar of salt by just a little bitty
[1:23:18] thing just disobeying his commandments
[1:23:21] enough to just look back and see what
[1:23:23] all that fire was about and she turned
[1:23:25] and then are you thinking about
[1:23:26] something even a woman there one second
[1:23:29] and the next second she's a pillar of
[1:23:30] salt
[1:23:31] aim it right there well I memorize down
[1:23:33] there preaching for brother blue one
[1:23:34] time some of you may know him we sit
[1:23:36] around the table eating lunch and he
[1:23:37] said hey he said pass me Lot's wife
[1:23:40] anyway this is the salt let's eat one
[1:23:43] one woman in just a mint just in one
[1:23:45] second went from Oh from from a pillar
[1:23:47] from a woman to a pillar of salt
[1:23:49] Amen see that's an example young people
[1:23:51] it seems the time to look back a minute
[1:23:53] and I'll say this with everything within
[1:23:55] me Amen if you look away from this
[1:23:57] message you will go from being a young
[1:23:59] person with a future a meant to being
[1:24:02] just somebody else in society we're just
[1:24:05] another life but church the message of
[1:24:08] the hour has come young people Amen to
[1:24:10] set you apart
[1:24:11] Amen to identify you to put a seal upon
[1:24:14] you and somebody that is a satisfied oh
[1:24:19] my Amen if we could look at Sodom and
[1:24:22] Gomorrah and see what they become if we
[1:24:24] can look at Hebrews four and see what
[1:24:25] they become then this morning Amen let's
[1:24:27] not just look at the bad examples Amen
[1:24:30] but let's look at our example which is
[1:24:32] the perfect example which is the Lord
[1:24:34] Jesus Christ
[1:24:35] in John 13 15 for I have given you an
[1:24:38] example that you should do as I've done
[1:24:40] to you now Paul poem says see and
[1:24:42] identify with Christ paragraph 65-62 but
[1:24:45] they are trying to find something to
[1:24:47] identify themselves with and they're I'm
[1:24:49] not gonna hold you all day okay amen and
[1:24:52] the reason they are doing it is because
[1:24:55] there's something in them that God made
[1:24:57] them match but God made them an example
[1:25:00] to be identified with and that was when
[1:25:02] he made Jesus Christ to become your
[1:25:04] Savior that's the example that's what
[1:25:07] people should want is to be identified
[1:25:09] with Jesus to be like him in Matthew
[1:25:12] 11:29 take my yoke upon you and learn of
[1:25:15] me for I am meek and lowly in heart and
[1:25:18] you shall find rest unto your souls see
[1:25:21] you're to learn of your example Jesus
[1:25:23] Christ Matthew 16:24 if any man will
[1:25:26] come after me let him deny himself and
[1:25:29] take up his cross and follow me you are
[1:25:31] to follow your example
[1:25:33] Hebrews fell to looking unto Jesus you
[1:25:36] are to look unto your example amen 1st
[1:25:38] Peter 2:21
[1:25:39] for even here and to where he called
[1:25:41] because Christ giving us an example that
[1:25:47] she should follow his steps
[1:25:50] see the human nature is why there is so
[1:25:53] many dissatisfied people God gave them a
[1:25:55] nature they've got a nature that makes
[1:25:57] him want to have something to identify
[1:25:58] themselves with they must have something
[1:26:00] that they want to be like they must have
[1:26:03] an objective in life even see the
[1:26:05] poverty little boys want to be Hopalong
[1:26:07] Cassidy let's bring that today little
[1:26:08] boys want to be Michael Jordan amen or
[1:26:10] they want to be Shaquille only a mint
[1:26:12] they're looking at all these examples
[1:26:13] ain't mint little girls he said they
[1:26:16] want to be Annie Oakley's amen you
[1:26:17] thought you look at girls today amen
[1:26:19] they see they see a filthiness on the on
[1:26:21] the television they see filthiness in
[1:26:23] the in the internet and they begin to
[1:26:25] pattern themselves why they're trying to
[1:26:27] satisfy that first inside of them I hope
[1:26:30] I'm getting through this morning they're
[1:26:32] trying to satisfy that first and that
[1:26:34] first is driving them or if they only
[1:26:37] wanted to be like Jesus as much as they
[1:26:39] want to be like earth examples set the
[1:26:41] sunday schools would be running over
[1:26:43] everywhere now I'm just going to preach
[1:26:47] here for a few minutes because I take
[1:26:48] young people services very seriously
[1:26:50] especially ones like this morning
[1:26:52] because I'm not just preaching to a
[1:26:53] bunch of young men and the younger and
[1:26:55] young ladies I'm preaching to the future
[1:26:57] hey man I'm preaching to the Church of
[1:26:58] today I'm preaching the young men that's
[1:27:00] gonna grow up and be beacons they're
[1:27:01] gonna be preachers amen let me say this
[1:27:03] what we need is we need integrity and
[1:27:06] that we need character amen we need a
[1:27:08] young lady's center that better not
[1:27:10] better not model themselves after the
[1:27:12] things the world but they're modern
[1:27:13] themselves had to the power of the Holy
[1:27:14] Ghost and then I said my my room this
[1:27:17] morning they're the hotel get ready I
[1:27:18] listened to a tape and I could hear
[1:27:20] people walking down the hallway you know
[1:27:22] and they were carrying on well I didn't
[1:27:24] care they were disturbing me so I was
[1:27:25] playing my taping to sturb them fair
[1:27:28] enough
[1:27:28] they preach along he's sitting a listen
[1:27:31] he said any woman that guess how the
[1:27:32] kitchens out of her place I thought all
[1:27:34] that that could get me kicked out of
[1:27:35] this hotel real quick but you got to
[1:27:39] come back to scripture it's Bible well I
[1:27:44] kind of figured it get taught to
[1:27:45] everybody admit but better substandard
[1:27:47] changed has Satan's eaten is it changed
[1:27:51] to what we preach listen friends that's
[1:27:52] the world that's the problem with the
[1:27:53] world today amen they're changing
[1:27:55] changing trying to satisfy
[1:27:57] amen
[1:27:58] let's come back to the landmark let's
[1:28:00] come back to what God has vindicated my
[1:28:02] to think this morning the Prophet City
[1:28:04] people let this stay with that great
[1:28:05] design great ambition to be like
[1:28:07] somebody for an example if they took
[1:28:09] Christ as their example then we could
[1:28:11] weaken the hell right now I won't get in
[1:28:13] trouble here brother way but stay with
[1:28:14] me
[1:28:15] amen oh we want to talk about defunding
[1:28:16] police let's talk about it if you would
[1:28:18] take Christ as your example he said we
[1:28:20] could fire every police there was in the
[1:28:23] nation
[1:28:23] I just might run for office with that
[1:28:28] code Amen we want to talk about it let's
[1:28:31] go back to Bible principles
[1:28:33] amen amen defunding police ain't gonna
[1:28:35] change this world amen he said the only
[1:28:37] thing that's going to change this world
[1:28:38] is let's come back to Bible principles
[1:28:41] let's come back to Christ being our
[1:28:44] example they said if class was our
[1:28:46] example he said everybody would be meek
[1:28:49] and humble everybody would be kind that
[1:28:51] had brotherly loved one for the other
[1:28:52] there would never be divorce case ever
[1:28:55] played in our country there would never
[1:28:57] be any sickness
[1:28:58] we could even dismiss hospitals if they
[1:29:01] tried to make Jesus Christ their example
[1:29:03] we would have need of nothing else but
[1:29:10] the satisfaction is identifying yourself
[1:29:13] with Jesus Christ let me say this this
[1:29:15] one in the world isn't an identity
[1:29:17] crisis this morning an identity crisis
[1:29:20] is a period of uncertainty confusion in
[1:29:23] which a person's sense of identity
[1:29:24] becomes insecure typically due to a
[1:29:29] change in their expected aims or role in
[1:29:34] society young people we go through the
[1:29:40] energy crisis
[1:29:43] oh my lord with all the Angels come from
[1:29:45] this morning anybody ever go through
[1:29:48] those identity crisis you've been there
[1:29:50] we've all been there over the under

[1:30:10] a hobby horse trying to be the Lone Star
[1:30:12] Ranger it's no more than what people

[1:34:10] to get there
[1:34:14] well brother Andrew God don't want me in
[1:34:16] the church I well if God don't want you
[1:34:18] to church why did he provide a way for
[1:34:19] you to be here Oberlander God he he I
[1:34:24] don't know why I'm here this wonder why
[1:34:26] does God even want me here
[1:34:28] why why am i hearing this you service I
[1:34:30] God don't want me in this you service
[1:34:32] well I guarantee a lot of you had to
[1:34:34] ride with somebody to get here well
[1:34:38] let's just preach a while why did God
[1:34:40] give you the opportunity to get here
[1:34:41] this morning because he wants you here
[1:34:47] he wants you here this morning for a
[1:34:49] purpose and I'm gonna close with this in
[1:34:52] the Old Testament when a man want to be
[1:34:54] identified at the house of God he took
[1:34:55] the most innocent thing he could find
[1:34:57] which was a lamb and he know that lamb
[1:35:00] was free from sin caused it nope no sin
[1:35:03] and he went and took the lamb and put
[1:35:05] his hand upon his head and confessed his
[1:35:09] sins
[1:35:10] now catch this I'll tell you I was I was
[1:35:12] setting this another night in my office
[1:35:13] and I about about shouted the place down
[1:35:15] I know you wouldn't believe that bet I
[1:35:17] did
[1:35:18] by faith he transferred his sins on the
[1:35:21] lamb and the innocence of the lamb back
[1:35:25] on him are you hearing me then the lamb
[1:35:28] died because it was a sinner so through
[1:35:31] the transmission of sins to the lamb the
[1:35:34] man went from being a sinner to be
[1:35:36] enough to be an innocent amen and the
[1:35:38] lamb went for holkar's
[1:35:40] the lamb went from being innocent to
[1:35:42] being a sinner notice and died a sinner
[1:35:45] and man lived by an act of faith obeying
[1:35:48] what God said but what did he do he went
[1:35:51] right back out of the temple with the
[1:35:53] same desire that he had when he come in
[1:35:55] because when the blood cell is broken he
[1:35:58] said and when that blood cell was broken
[1:35:59] the life of that lamb would not pull
[1:36:02] inside or come back into human life
[1:36:04] because it was an animal life he meant
[1:36:07] the man went out with the same desire he
[1:36:09] had so therefore he committed sins
[1:36:11] continually all the time again amen but
[1:36:14] here's the thing about it that was under
[1:36:16] the blood of bulls and goats it only
[1:36:19] provided a temporary satisfaction
[1:36:22] amen are you with me Amy can you imagine
[1:36:24] coming in the church Amy in your let's
[1:36:27] put it this way
[1:36:27] amen in the old days am i holding too
[1:36:30] long brother sit brother wait in the old
[1:36:33] days you've been out and done something
[1:36:35] wrong and so in those days you had to go
[1:36:37] get a lamb now I tell you we ought to be
[1:36:39] thankful for the blood of Jesus Christ
[1:36:40] today Amy because in those days you had
[1:36:42] to go get your lamb and bring it to
[1:36:45] church now your lambs got to come get
[1:36:47] you and bring you to church shouldn't be
[1:36:53] that way but anyhow they would go get
[1:36:56] the lamb and they would bring that
[1:36:57] lament and they would kill that lamb and
[1:36:59] that bleeding buddy lamb they would lay
[1:37:01] their hands upon it and that lamb would
[1:37:03] take away the guilt it would take away
[1:37:06] the shame Amen maybe they went out and
[1:37:08] stole something he would take away the
[1:37:09] shame him stealing maybe they went out
[1:37:11] in total lie it would take away the
[1:37:12] shame of line Amen but brother when they
[1:37:14] walked out the door the desire to do it
[1:37:17] was still there so all they received
[1:37:19] under the blood of the bull and goat was
[1:37:21] a temporary satisfaction oh this morning
[1:37:23] people as I close amen I want
[1:37:26] announcement to you that we are not here
[1:37:28] this morning under the blood of bulls
[1:37:30] and goats under temporary satisfaction
[1:37:32] we are here this morning under a perfect
[1:37:36] under an eternal satisfaction which is
[1:37:39] an eternal blood which has produced an
[1:37:43] eternal Redemption for he has made him
[1:37:49] to be sin for us who knew no sin that we
[1:37:55] might be made the righteousness of God
[1:37:57] in him but there come a time when God
[1:38:01] somebody say God say with everything
[1:38:04] with any of God made us an example
[1:38:09] and he gave us the Lord Jesus brother
[1:38:15] way this is Rob out tour my office now
[1:38:17] and when a sinner puts his hands up on
[1:38:20] his precious head and confesses his sins
[1:38:23] and his sins is transferred from the
[1:38:28] sinner to Jesus and the innocence the
[1:38:33] innocence of Jesus is transferred by the
[1:38:37] Holy Ghost back into that person o
[1:38:41] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:38:43] young people are you hearing me this
[1:38:45] morning Wilbur that I've done this and
[1:38:47] I've done that amen but I come to tell
[1:38:49] you this morning amen raise your hand
[1:38:51] raised hands raised hand up amen if
[1:38:54] you'll take your hand this morning and
[1:38:55] in symbol just lay it on the head of
[1:38:58] your lamb amen identify yourself with
[1:39:00] your life you know what you'll come in
[1:39:02] here amen carry on that sin but you
[1:39:05] leave here carrying the innocence of
[1:39:07] Jesus Christ Oh glory to God what I'm
[1:39:13] glad what a lamb by the Holy Ghost that
[1:39:21] individual becomes as innocent as Jesus
[1:39:24] himself there's where I want to be
[1:39:29] identified for by one spirit we all
[1:39:33] baptized into one body now let me say it
[1:39:35] this way to be identified with Christ
[1:39:37] it's to move from this satisfaction in
[1:39:41] life to satisfaction I've got to leave
[1:39:49] you this and remember what satisfied
[1:39:52] means satisfied means to meet an
[1:39:59] obligation or to pay off a debt and
[1:40:05] David said behold I was shapen in
[1:40:07] iniquity and in sin did my mother
[1:40:10] conceive me so in other words David is
[1:40:13] saying I was born in sin I was born in
[1:40:18] debt Oh
[1:40:21] Bible says there was a Jubilee year calm
[1:40:23] though people that were sold out for
[1:40:25] dancing they had old noted that they
[1:40:27] could not pay so they went and sold
[1:40:29] themselves to people for slaves but ever

[1:40:50] serving how much longer he had to serve
[1:40:53] when the trumpet sounded the slave was
[1:40:56] made free he can lay down the whole he
[1:40:58] could go home to his children he didn't
[1:41:01] have to work any longer the trumpet gave
[1:41:04] not an uncertain sound but it gave a
[1:41:06] certain sound and the man can lay the on
[1:41:08] his trumpet and go home free from
[1:41:10] slavery then brother Andrew what are you

[1:44:38] debt is paid for I'm happy and the
[1:44:42] Devils mad because the debt is paid for
[1:44:45] I am sinless I am spotless I am innocent
[1:44:49] about the satisfying portion of the Holy
[1:44:51] Ghost oh he paid our debt but you know
[1:44:58] what John I'm trying to quit but you
[1:45:00] know what John
[1:45:01] in a few days somebody come along and
[1:45:05] say do you really pay that $20 debt off
[1:45:09] you didn't you didn't pay that debt but
[1:45:12] when when the debt was paid to me I
[1:45:14] wrote him a receipt paid in full when
[1:45:21] they tell him that that's not paid
[1:45:23] brother Samuel he can take the receipt
[1:45:26] and he can waive it in the accusers face
[1:45:30] and say but wait a second I've got a
[1:45:33] receipt and the problem of God said what
[1:45:36] is the Holy Ghost
[1:45:37] what is that pillar of fire it is that
[1:45:39] abstract it is that receipt that your
[1:45:42] debt is paid I'm done here this morning
[1:45:46] Church but if you want something to
[1:45:47] shout about I'm gonna give you something
[1:45:49] to shout about your ticket in the
[1:45:51] rapture is paid for and then your
[1:45:53] ticketing the glorious paid for your
[1:45:55] body changes paid for young people you
[1:45:58] don't have to go to the world you don't
[1:46:00] have to go to pleasure you'll have to go
[1:46:01] to entertainment it's paid for this
[1:46:03] morning you are they innocent children
[1:46:06] under the Living God won't you stand to
[1:46:08] your feet this morning paid for this
[1:46:11] woman brother Wayne the devil can holler
[1:46:14] mount the Dan all he wants to but I got
[1:46:16] a receipt I got a receipt
[1:46:22] and when I hear the Spirit of God say
[1:46:25] you can overcome these things I raise up
[1:46:28] and say hey man but that's been paid for
[1:46:33] that that is satisfied this morning you
[1:46:41] know when people they become debt free
[1:46:42] they they do crazy things they really do
[1:46:45] the craziest thing so when they get out
[1:46:48] of that they go back in there they
[1:46:51] celebrate getting out of that by going
[1:46:52] back that makes a lot of sense don't it
[1:46:56] but you know what the freedom has come
[1:46:58] to their life a freedom has come in
[1:47:02] their heart and there's not a restraint
[1:47:06] there to control they'll go out like I
[1:47:11] said go and debt celebrate and being out
[1:47:12] of debt but when Paul wrote that in
[1:47:15] Romans 6 and said the grace of God
[1:47:20] so because grace is here they thought
[1:47:22] well let's just go sin and Paul said god
[1:47:24] forbid god forbid that the debt was paid
[1:47:28] and you would go dead again brother
[1:47:34] sister I'll leave you since this morning
[1:47:36] but REM said on the day of Pentecost it
[1:47:39] come down that pillar fire broke apart
[1:47:40] like that tongues of fire sit upon him
[1:47:42] he said not their tongues but tongues of
[1:47:44] fire set upon each of them an elected
[1:47:46] selected group identified by this pillar
[1:47:48] of fire showing that God has separated
[1:47:50] himself in the man do you get it
[1:47:53] he said God below God separating himself
[1:47:56] man God not in one person he's in the
[1:47:58] church universal that's the reason Jesus
[1:47:59] said the works that I do shall do all
[1:48:02] show you do more now King James says
[1:48:03] greater but the right translation there
[1:48:05] is more than this show you do God was
[1:48:07] bottled and confined in one man Jesus
[1:48:10] Christ somebody sit with me but now
[1:48:13] button how he's bottle and Kotori bottle
[1:48:18] and confined in the whole universal
[1:48:20] Church of Living God
[1:48:22] and how many's got the Holy Ghost here
[1:48:25] this morning Haman you have got the
[1:48:29] receipt your debt is paid you know my
[1:48:36] peoples out there drinking this morning
[1:48:38] they're in debt they were born in debt
[1:48:41] they rub em said you can't blame them
[1:48:43] they were born they were born in debt
[1:48:44] that's the nature they was born where's
[1:48:46] all born with sin shapen iniquity but
[1:48:50] didn't need something it's something
[1:48:58] that the devil that because of that
[1:49:01] nature drove you to do the things you
[1:49:04] did there over you to do trying to
[1:49:05] satisfy that thirst then when you come
[1:49:10] and get the Holy Ghost and get born
[1:49:12] again and get changed
[1:49:14] that same devil comes in church and then
[1:49:17] that devil tries to put condemnation up
[1:49:19] on you for doing what that nature that
[1:49:21] was in you drove you to do that he was a
[1:49:23] pervert or of but I heard a quote
[1:49:28] yesterday about blew me away

[1:55:58] she didn't know that she was naked Adam
[1:55:59] didn't know he was naked but Lord when
[1:56:02] they swapped those veils they received
[1:56:05] knowledge and it put a lust fell upon
[1:56:08] them and your prophet would come and
[1:56:11] Satan Zi then say now here we are and
[1:56:12] Laodicean Church age and one of the one
[1:56:15] of the characteristics of this age is it
