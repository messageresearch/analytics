finish it but I feel like God know how to do it you know I just I don't worry about it I just put it is in that God take over that point versa so by God grace does he appreciate it one preciate Bob's and everyone here today and just looking for the holy spirit that they give us what we have near similar even to places in the scripture this evening Matthew 7:21 through 27 I didn't have it all wrote down then and I was over read Matthew 2:16 chapter the Matthew and I will read all the way down from the 16th to the 19th and everything so and we'll begin reading at the 21st verse down through the 27 right here the Bible says not everyone that says unto me Lord Lord shall enter the kingdom of heaven but he that does the will of my father which is in heaven for many many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have not we prophesied in thy name and in thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful words and then I would profess unto them I never knew you depart from me that work iniquity therefore never would ever see here these sands of Mines and does them I will liken unto him as a wise man which built his house upon a rock and the rain descended the floods came and the winds blew and beat up under upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock the next one says and everyone that heard the sounds of my hands it does them not shall be likened unto a man a foolish man which built his house upon sand and the rain this is and the flood came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall all of it a few 16 chapters started 260 verse down through the nineteenth and this is her Jesus beginning the accident no new questions in here and some of you dancers said how the Christ the Son of the Living God and Jesus he renamed in and jesus answered and said unto unto Him blessed art our salmon born of Jonah for flesh and blood has not revealed it unto thee but my father which is in heaven and I say also unto deed thou art Peter and upon this rock I will build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it the nineteenth verse and then I directed and I would give unto thee the keys of the kingdom of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven let's pray i gracious father lord help me one more time you're my body mine mine and my spirit my soul to you father help me O God to get myself out of the way Lord but as I give you all my script for this service father take full control of this service in Jesus Christ's name we pray father amen I bless you maybe see the one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God just this evening right we find here we see the scene over here but we find here dad we see the scene open here Jesus dealing with he what howdy bill in the house and what you build at all and at the words that we finally tell one man built his house upon a rock and another man billions out upon saying I my title years I would be on my church in other words and I look at the standard I study this out I've been thinking I said you know really build something here we must have a foundation how do you just don't go build a house on saying even though saying is a rock dog divided substance Halloween hit it way ain't none what wouldn't you go to the beach if you had a beach in the wind beginning to blow saying go everywhere but when you go to the Grand Canyon in the wind blowing it still setting how do you don't work on that rocket going the world others so that we realize here that we must have I have the correct foundation to build on I built a faithful and I'm beginning to think I'll say you know God go to a vegan village church he gonna build a church just like him how do you know we gonna have a foundation if we gonna lay a foundation for church that foundation he that I build my church you know bit man try to build his own church and it was a problem a I'll bill your own idea or bill your only thought debtors are dead if that wasn't probably but with God build his church the gates of Hell cannot stand against that church and it was so we you begin to look here I begin to think on them things right there and I begin to realize her and the gays al you call God want us to come to the point haloo discharged right girl will be a glorious church be able to stand and get all the blows of the devil you know some people say we're brothers you'll be in this church right how do in other words the churches go to a store but a church they've been built by Christ does not lose its foundation honey don't worry don't worry when the wind blow ordered they said the probably because that when a tree it's been attacked by a solid foundation we know we're beginning to rock a tree and then we're beginning to come up against that tree you say what do that tree do and begin to dig deeper and the roots beginning to get a scrub aho your trial do not stop you your trials help you how do you know where your trial don't stop your child in a way of you know where you stand in the word your trousers ever you how do we go through tribulations and trial how do not just to say well I need to give up the devil fight me this way and is that what is doing god has proven his revelation here proving the foundation that you build on how do another one go to the enemy come in like a flood but you'll learn the trust of Jesus Christ so I began to think on them same foundation you know foundation must have something to give us support how do you know the foundation must have something to give it support how ludus searching you know you build a church you you you all stablish the church the church it to put it in this putting it on this foundation of this piece of ground and what builds the church but you did you've put things in order you put diggings and oil and trustees and on how anything do you got elders that's a mature way to do it build the foundation for this church and then what is your this church a bit standing all the years are not no years got out of 25 23 first time I come here you done 58 now so you can see I look at being so but she won't say but it was built to stand halu that way it was built to stand so now do we go through all the trials in this truck don't doubt been through the same matter trial and tribulation that we all go through up and down the light but something keep holding on you said what did that that's not you holding on it's God the Word of God by the power Toni go it's only you solid be another when I begin to think on them things that I would live here and Big W were telling Peter he's at Peter about this rock I'll build my church I'm gonna build this church in such a way how do you did Peter write that the gates of Hell will fight this church but the gates of Hell won't prevail and I'm not going to give you a kid will give you keys I'm gonna give you keys in other words I'm not going to give you one revelation I won't give you a buttons of Revelation how do you I'll never give you enough keys here that when the enemy are coming like a flood you got a key to ever something ever so cursed and you go unlock every door that God got I will give you the key Peter how that God will give you the key to revelation for healing I will give you a revelation for delivery I will give you a revelation for salvation I will give you the key Peter uglier than the gates of Hell will not be able to stop you how do you go say they don't even got a key to the house I've been saving up in script from his old house he had no foundation he's a body of our bondage the pit he have no foundation the bride got a foundation and foundation is built upon the revelation of Jesus Christ say yesterday that I've ever had were the foundation ears I let them script look at it raw I look at soldier soul said adrenaline songs 11 verse 3 say if the Foundation's be destroyed what can the righteous do we got no foundation this message was built on the foundation of a prophetic anointing they said brother Brandon could not build his own foundation he built the same foundation that Paul built that why he said when he act brother Ben he's I preach what Paul preached how do I become Paul preached the revelation of Jesus Christ and Paul David man help me preach any other gospel and what I have preached to you let it be a curse Holly if we preach another gospel let why even preach the foundation in Jesus Christ he built the revelation on the foundation of Jesus gray how do you even know if that one polgár's say when doing trials come his way and in tribulation coming away then why Paul would say I am persuaded that nothing could separate me from the love of God what does it grudge you because it was a foundation it's a foundation you built on and we all got every we got to have a foundation that we won't be able to stand Holly code to Revelation 21 verse 47 and the walls of the city head the names of the Twelve Apostles and of the Lamb how destroyed as a foundation here as it doesn't revelation that keyboard from day to day we got something to stand on how do we got something that's solid we go in a word we know when everything come against us we got to know what we stand that man that built his house old saying what you got so many people then blow it around hell you don't know what it come from how they don't know where they going but we know what we go in other words they never what you know I tell myself you know man we some time we had them we had to might have to move out to do something to get a word that a hold of because you to remember her we gave we got a help Jack we gotta have a stronger revelation now how do did that we had that we had on the Luther when we had to have a scroll the revelations everywhere and underwear underwear now we need all we know for revelation we need this wine the lay up the longer you keep it the scroll bigot why does not get weak in age why gets conquer that what some of you still been sending 50 or 40 years and all this because what your revelation got scrub till you learn how to give it all to Jesus Christ I learning how to lean on him and we don't give up in this age right here so we gotta it must have a foundation here it must be strong in network and it must possess the gate of his enemy in this revelation must take over and that way that were you fighting the devil we're not fighting the devil we're just going out there we fighting the devil with divine revelation Christ is in full control how do you even know we sometimes we don't realize it but we we sometimes say try to blinders and get us not to looking at circumstances but circle says don't stop revelation how do you know you know even uh probably God's easy to determine Allah he said long as you confess you save you say just something as simple as long as you hold on to your revelation I'm saying how do don't let the devil change your mind about your yo-yo the work of grace that Christ gave you Lo and you confess you save you are saying don't don't change your confession stay the same confess the Lord Jesus Christ and believe in your heart let's not say be you are say hundred salvation come to believe it and accepting the word of Jesus Christ that is not nothing you do we gotta have a foundation I looked at the fire here we find him when Abraham went up and did what he did offered up as it God told Abraham you're blessed that blessing not only do Abraham but to his seed not see to you see Holly when we come out there that blessing here come on for Abraham it come down through the lineage and all of our churches of god that's blessed by the baptism of the Holy Ghost be overcomers God and create a brazier Gupta's age to be overcome not wowsie wowsie Woo's happy that you had people today and so it's so hard for people to be happy how do you know they saw other people to be happy today because you know there's so much going on and so much in the world going on it's so much here it's so much stuff it did we pick up the dumb the news and everything is going on in the world all kinds of things going on in the world howling and if you look at all this stuff you can't get discouraged in a way Hello Dolly lies it them it told in this a bit but we got to get our eyes on Jesus Holly when Peter plea remember her Peter Logan Peter had the word in front of him and he will look at dead at the word Holly we had a foundation he could walk on water right now we know that don't happen in reality never don't happen in reality so for him to walk on water he had to get away get his eyes on Jesus and when he got his eyes on Jesus the revelation that he had the water become a foundation and Peter got off the boat and begin to walk on water but it's dead the water was now holding in the world where he looked into Jesus Jesus had the power to take the water it make it become concrete but the circumstances was the wind be getting the blow it will be getting the blowed stones beginning to rise just like I said in other words when he did see Jesus is the foundation so when the store begin to blow the sweating wind began to blow this way Peter begin to Bank and begin to look around and get his eyes off Jesus and when he got his eyes off Jesus the foundation that he was running to let go holler then he started to say it he cried out save me Lord and cheetah reached down and picked him up how do people do what we got to do we got to overcome in his age is they ever gone that Satan God is trained on human what soldier is such about it people say this is not a band of ease right here this is not just we fighting against world we fighting against demonic worlds and demonic powers and and unseen forces all the time man battles just a neck going up but what keeping us serving God it's the revelation of Jesus Christ and it were just sort of that is you know now let us look at our foundation we gotta examine our foundation see will it stand the test yeah you build a foundation with a crack in it if you put a foundation with a crack in it next thing you know you got a plant growing up through it hello government light he don't care what it see they will light him for that see they're gonna be a reservation so you know that is just that way in other words I've seen some put some cracks in it but if you got a good foundation a good solid foundation it ain't nothing gonna move that foundation so that what we got it that's what we got to be sure is the message of foundation to you and when I say the message Jesus Christ was saying yesterday today and forever brother Brandon brought a message not himself he turned your heart back to Jesus how do you know where he'd say I preach what Paul bridge so what the ball preach Paul preach Christ how do you so he I come with the same revelation that turn your back this is not no mysterious revelation how do you the raptures not a mysterious pain the raptures receiving the baptism in the Holy Ghost if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead if it's in your body your body got to change because it probably if the same spirit that raised Christ from the dead they make the rapture mysterious the Matt rapture will you receive the baptism no no you go you got everything you need for a rapture have you got all the power you need to get out of here how do it would change your life quicken your mortal body I got the paint on inside to change my body a butterfly caterpillar does not need anything to change him all you gotta do is keep me keep me holy doors you do need because the power to change him within him because he's not just a caterpillar he's the mystery of a butterfly so the power that's on the inside of him with one day taking off desert here we come a bug that's crawling on her will come a heavily flying bird that's a power that's already and that's what your father God put that in you the rapture is already in you everything you need to get out of here is already in you once you receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit now you so people don't preach on it no more but no people wanted to be intellectualism so you didn't come to learn God you come to be God's we didn't we didn't go we don't go to church just to say well how would the church I'm learning about God how do we going to church to become that word we go to church to hear that word and accept that word and keep eating on that world into our bodies obeyed it how do you know what so we find here the foundation here now beginning to realize well you say brother Joel you say what what do we need to get out of here all you need is the real experience with the baptism that holy go now you know not just not just a day at work here not just a day when they hear they was dumb guys that win in the upper room when they win he never rule no guys win in the upper room basically afraid of the people Fred of the public here they go they run they go set up a room her name was in the upper room everybody was Cowboys in other words everybody was cowards how do they heard Jesus preach Holly but they didn't have enough faith to stand up against the public they didn't would enough faith to stand up and face to people he was up in the upper over to about ten day Holly and all of a sudden there come a sign for heaven like a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled how 21 and when they received baptism nother holy go they come outside on a foundation of a boat as they start preaching Jesus later preaching the power the Holy Ghost that's simmering go we have not but such as we have we give to you in the name of Jesus Christ rise up it won't what they become the words they become Christ the Holy Ghost living in a body that way this message is there it to put Christ with skin on it we got to get this message back with skin on it honey we got to put we got to put Christ back where you belong then you know we prayer we pray the Old Testament proud o how Father which art in heaven hallowed be thy name thy kingdom come thy will be that's Old Testament it has Old Testament prayer they would hit eight the kingdom come Jesus is already in here they come without observation he's at the kingdom of God is already to you how do you waited right when 899 he come he's already her in you that kingdom of God is living on his side of you how did he not God he need to come he's already in you right now the kingdom of God is living through you how do we gotta recognize who the seals that got to control our life we got a record at this wooden since they kept a seal there by the baptismal holy go whenever devil he'll ever spared a deal then let loose oh you are you still holding on that's the Holy Ghost he's a brother you've been preaching a lot on the Holy Ghost that's what's the problem man ain't nobody give me I find him I found out that people deal the people haven't got a message but they ain't got the person to go with it how do you don't worry but you can't over just come to devil and I believe the message you better had a person meta message have you better know the author of the Bible how do you never work so big in the little domains right there foundation I'm foundation here we had a so we begin to realize he says here then he gonna elevate us and we gonna become kings and priests well you got a new name now healthy he's gonna make us kings and priests but Jesus says Jesus has a foundation and that foundation have power in it and on how will you know what kind of power will you have except you get a revelation what kind of power he had you know you know how can you understand who you are and what you all be doing if you don't know what he's doing so there was let us look at something he done let me look at ax T in verse 38 exchange chapter and verse 38 verse let watch what Jesus did you know he looked dead at real quick and exchanged Bertoni now Bible says here God God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with what holy goes you gotta have the same person you gotta have the same anointing how do you regard to an end if God knowing into God knowing that Jesus is with the holy go the vessel hollow in the Spirit of God come on the vessel and knowing with the holy God and with what and they were any who went about doing what and or what what with the what how do God was what with him so now we realize Jesus did this and this was the foundation that God anointed Jesus with what you for having you deed demon spirits they've been hanging around have no right they're building God property how do Casa has no right to be on your property have you hot blood pressure have no right to be on your property have no right to be your problem whatever you battle or they're bound in heaven why don't you lose solar revolution heaven how do you lose diseases that heaven because there's no disease in heaven the only thing is in heaven is healing and Reaper in hell how do you did the babies in heaven but take the phase at on earth and leave them on earth I don't talk about you cast your mouth how did Jesus say that's the power of God he wants you to use you know we told so many times we put things in heaven there don't blow in heaven oh well I'll do what ad ever done this to me I can't overcome I need to get work that ain't in heaven that language that language didn't come from heaven that God that's the kind of language the whole yo nerve right there Holly about we need when you feel like you ain't got no screen to go easy let the weak look up and say I'm strong how do you let the we begin to praise God for being scroll how I'm getting out of here on the scope here how do you death why what are you trying to hit trying to get a now help fire faith in the Word of God to the point that we could change our body it's about the church because we got to fight against so much in a human part of us the human part of us and it was so we begin to realize her and he's I build my church and the gates of Hell shell be able to stand against it in the word not that there won't be against it but it won't be able to hold you back right and it was we we did it's just that way Church in this authority that he had in Jesus just same Authority if you notice that he put right back in the bride same power same Holy Ghost every edge here that you're known him forever age Howland you if you if you follow down through that Paul had his anointing for his age how did God broke a seal frenzy and put the spirit of boating on line up on that a lion in order to come upon them and them guys became bold and it were they they had the foundation they had anointing for that age how do enough guys went about and everyday was standing in the face of death or whatever was the guy's head you know Nana boldness upon them God release the seal upon him here elusive knowing and upon him for that age they didn't when it come on up down through the age I do the doggy anybody put him for anointing an ox up on him that was a bound that with the anointing for that it is no guys get her life walked right in front of their hey I went to Rome and I wasn't wrong for but the couple days went to the where they killed him and burn them at the stake it down here Elena but they've got heady anointing to do that then it comes up you know no one ever man how do God put there knowing the wisdom I want and they begin to take the Word of God and put it in before me and I'll do you think take play double D anointing that Holly but when it get down to the last day Halu God put her noted on the bride and call it evil order when he said we gonna fly above it all church how do we go go into a different I prefer she's not just older she's in heavenly places she goes into another dimension right here then Brian got faith will not listen we live did we find a Bobby thing that's holding the world by how did the faith that we need right here we are flying above all this criticism in everything else every Devon Hill in other words I said serum so many things going on around us around this message right now people's is giving up people's letting down is this a been a testing time or your faith in Christ or your faith Aziz are in a man and in other words in if your faith is in man the Bible say have no confidence but if your faith is in college didn't your rocker stand you know that means you know the butters they have no competition in the flesh every say yes but how confidence in the revelation of the word that's what the rapture in favor lady go never say did you uh you said well you said Brook jewel say I got companies to my pastor you have confidence in the revelation II brain you got confidence in the faith that he stands for but as a man we all forgot phase and if you start looking at me and you see all phase but if you start looking at the God the Christ he's trying to get you to that way you see the power of God in hundred of what it is today everybody see everybody when I thought so so look at you got only had problem right now that's why you got a problem you know why I got probably you know why I got a problem he needs you to pray for it how do we need each other prep each other huh we didn't have no problem nobody wouldn't had to prep and we didn't have no problem everything in the truck would be perfect but we had to keep praying each other I had to keep hold I need keep calling out to God help my brother help my sister get a little weaker we will pray until the time I changed and God that's just the way it is sometimes we think he's gonna happen right now I'm gonna be the perfect person we're no scene did you let me know when you find a solution I found the only perfect thing I found me nobody saying is we ain't no words die in Christ that didn't lead us earlier then that someone is always but right now you won't bother young people you gonna batter you got us grapes you got a great age just age and stops crumble for you to batter then it was fifty years yo you got a lot of use young people you got about a different matter because technology have opened the gates of hell hallelujah Edward you gotta fight against a different dimension here I say you know but III go I live in my community and I just realized something for the first time back in the summer had you ever thought about just the school get out when I was in school with school without you hear people hauling his churches all day long and it were Christmas time come you hear people run and do the neighborhood kid but now school without a whole summer I might have sold three I didn't see nobody happy honey only everybody on everybody in the computer yeah even in my grandsons like to run them out y'all go outside and play what's that you know ball you can play cowboys man everybody play cowboys on the game now I mean you know I mean it's nothing physical taking place like that what what happened to technology they took that out so every generation get weaker and wiser how did my grandboy my little grand boy he telling me I was trying to do something on the computer he to rebuke of me probably you don't do it anyway look what you mean I don't do it you don't know what you don't let me show you you don't Papa no idea but it just did to technology does but you got a different battle to fight and it was when we fight it you fight against when the gates of Hell bento off hey what we were trying to get it off you already got it okay so yeah in other words so now you gotta you gotta go at your mind in there and guard your spirit that you don't open up a door that you'll be the only way for the rest of the days of your life there's no way you could overdo that you gotta get the Baptist another holy go cuz Satan got everything that they're opened the door one time I'll let the let down one time nearly stop for a moment she only stopped for a moment and the devil stepped right in line you can open the door and all of a sudden you become subject to the kingdom of Satan just because it was just a click away I know how this spirit work I've been down the roads and done anything just a click away you can open the dimension did you beat oming in the rest of your day how do you never try your face you know were you trying to get the victory over it in yourself try and hide it in yourself but you know you should open the door and only way you can get rid of it to get that demon cast out cuz we don't get a cast out it's gonna lead you down the wrong road I don't know what I'm saying this either maybe there's somebody but that's what it that's what Satan comes do to open up your door that's what my the day we we living in the agent I'm running through the I'm running through the 8/9 I'm seeing so many woman's and husbands is separating and he meet the guys my cousin is laying in prison my second cousin it's laying in the hospital right now because she

walking in the Word of God looking like a crystal get rid of the bar now you know how to scooped out on that level right there you got to let then you got to stay with this word you would not be able to overcome in your own screen you would not be able to overcome your screen I tried it I don't try to be my best lead overcoming my own screen I found myself on the floor I've tried it all right there it don't work in the human swing and it didn't work try to come to that point that I needed Jesus Christ to come down and burn and help me give me the strength to overcome in this age but you said brothers you're good I know what it is for you two don't stop gonna try this drugs they ain't never tried and I need a testimony you got a testimony if you live it with Jesus Christ you gotta test tomorrow you don't need no other test about the greater chance about you guys that God kept you in this layout's it ain't that I didn't defile myself if I had it [Applause] if God did you don't believe God it never survived if I could keep myself by the grace of God that I didn't get out there in law and got myself integrity and drugs and then more living and all these though that is a victory that is a testimony right there we've got a hell that you can't do it yourself it got to be God now I say this right here when it come down to the end of the day I needed to God give me the syringe because I realized brother mother that I had let all that this enemy and completely took over and I know that this power that was holding me was not the power of a human screen but it was a power of a demonic power called drugs and different things that couldn't break that on my own I needed a power I needed something that was more powerful than what I this grip has got in my life and the only thing I could find that could break this power was Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and I didn't know why to get to this man I I tried to Pentecostal Church I went to the Baptist Church I tried different churches and they didn't release and I tried to be a good person I tried to be there but that one day I heard a prophet start talking about the eagle that was down in the barnyard Holly started at where he heard and all of a sudden died down in that and that revelation right there God reached down through the dark dimensions hollering I heard my name something said come up here what what if the power the Holy goes something let go and if we let go here you won't be able to re have a devil you got to get rid of a devil by the power the Holy Ghost you gotta cast demons out demons don't leave demons don't get up and say I'm out of hurl you gotta catch them out we're sewed up our dough today they could cast out the devil in that same anointing that was old Jesus how did that cast out Devils in here to say but you got to believe it first and if you bow bow spirit he's heard the challenge every demon but first you got to be want to get rid of it the drug in order to get rid of a drug dealer or any addiction you gotta be ready to let go of it if you're not ready to let go of it it would never leave you you can go to rehab it and everything that but it'll never leave you but when the minute you realize I'm ready to let go of it I'm gonna lay it at your feet no that's when that demon gonna leave I'm gonna all these things that I'm just I'm in a different realm of thought I'm just preaching by inspiration but Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and I want you to young people so I want to let you know that thing that you had that nobody know about it would never leave you know you had it it gotta be it gotta come clean if you've got something you doing husband wife's if you don't come clean that demon oh never leave you've got to come clean Satan and distant voluntarily once he's exposed then brother said you watch that demon he's calling for this demon over here for help because he know he gonna be exposed demons that what

and if you ain't got about a Bible with paper but paper on it is a dead Bible but will you get a Bible with skin on his alive that's the one wood that we need to have we need to have the one with skin on it we need one with power behind it challah bread Pruden Jesus crisis to say yesterday today if ever the probably got say if I could get two people believe all things are possible honey if you're gonna get the people they accept I'll do is one cheater crap move to say yesterday today they're not even cats a good set in your way this is getting people to believe all things are possible you know that's what we a right now is trying to put the people back on a foundation that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today that was brother Brennan thing Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever that's what we a right now that's what his thing was and that's the same thing you today Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so that's where we a we want God to move the same way and now I'm gonna do a little something different right here God given us power over the devil over the world over lust all the things that we can hide but one thing Satan can't do Satan can't hold the son of God in prison you know you say brother do you say I look at look at look at listen here man listen God look at this demon that had Paul on his bondage Paul was so under the grip of the devil that he became vicious became a murder in his spirit Paul was willing to kill it and persecute the Church of the Living God he was so bout my religious devil that just religious spirit put a murdering demon over all and he was here but God had a power and come through the power of forgiveness through the power of delivers that deliver power and Paul got delivered from this thing and then Paul say I'm persuaded at the end of the day and the musicians come we're saying that Tsonga we are standing on holy ground you know that and when we sang this song here young people's when you think his stop for a moment and ask yourself are you ready to meet Jesus Christ if this was your last moment on earth would you be ready to meet Jesus Christ or the devil's got you in a spot that you say I
