========================================

God bless your Saints good to be in the house of the Lord this morning you come expecting you come expecting we've got a promise you will receive what you expect let's just go the Lord in prayer as we get into our study Lord we just thankful Lord to be able to gather together around your word this morning in order we just ask that you'll bless the service today I pray God that shall just give the people what they have need of Lord and Lord that you'll bless our brothers he's preparing and studying and brother Louise with him Lord Jesus this bless the remainder of the services today we pray in your name now excuse me I I we about got to the end of uh Hebrews chapter 12 but I just began to meditate on these a couple of verses here 14 and 15 that I just kind of wanted to look at a little bit closer in the Hebrews 12 14 it says follow peace with all men and holiness without which no man shall see the Lord looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God list any root of bitterness bringing up trouble you and thereby many be defiled now let's look at the example he's using of what the scripture means he said let's lest there be any fornicator or profane person as Esau who for one morsel of meat sold his Birthright so misaw made a decision and then after afterwards he'd regretted that decision and um so it says for ye know how that afterward when he would have inherited the blessing he he was rejected before he found no place of repentance though he sought it carefully with tears and if you go back to Genesis 27 you can read how Esau just cried out it says with with bitterness he cried out bitterly and that's the example that Paul is using here in verse 15 he says it lists any root of bitterness you can see how bitterness will rise what causes bitterness really is uh I mean uh Esau was was expecting to receive the birthright and then because of the choices that he made his expectation was not met he did not meet the expectation was not fulfilled and that's what caused the bitterness to rise up now Paul is telling us to let's let's be careful that you know that the thing that we're expecting of course we're all expecting the the blessings from God and all these things that we're expecting so he's telling us he's warning us to make make sure we make right decisions but he's also wanting us to watch out for any root of bitterness and the root of bitterness will rise up if someone is expecting something and they don't get exactly what they expect and then that calls us something to begin to take place so let's narrow the focus down on these two verses follow peace with all men and holiness and looking diligently lest any man fail of the grace of God lest any root of bitterness springing up trouble you so as we examine bitterness this morning look at what brother Brandon said in Christ The Mystery of God revealed he said stay right together brother to write together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't never not see these these lessons that we're we're learning about is how to deal with one another how to deal with situations so this morning I maybe we can just take a moment to inspect ourselves as you know it's it's helpful sometimes to expect inspect yourself and I'm you know just kind of compare yourself the way that you react and and and you know all of ourselves how we do things because like as one time I was sharing that uh experience with brother Marcus Becker where he said you know if you can really what we're really doing here is is we if you can understand yourself if I can understand myself and understand the re the way that I react and the way I respond to things and how things happen then that's what that's what this journey is really all about is understanding why why I am the way I am and how I can overcome and so here brother random said stay right together if the brother you think he's a little wrong or the sister say Lord don't love never don't let me never have the root of bitterness bring up because it'll affect him and it'll take the Christ right out of my life that poison acids of malice and jealousy and hatred that will just take the Holy Spirit right away from you it will run him or run him from the Tabernacle Hill here it'll kill the spirit of God or drive it away from here hurt your pastor it'll do everything see don't you do that so now we want to examine this morning how do I if if I can examine myself and find that there's a root of bitterness or something how do I get rid of that what how do we tackle this problem it's like a gardener you know figuring out there's there's something I need to I need to pull up and and you go to Whedon and you pull up the things that aren't supposed to be there and you leave what's supposed to be there and and you're you're attending a garden Max Lucado said bitterness is like a rock thrown into a plastic pond it's like something that's small that gets started and it starts trickling out and becomes bigger and bigger until after you were like whoa where did that come from but this starts off real small after its initial Splash it sends out circular ripples that affect the whole pond Charles Spurgeon said The more bitterness you have in your heart the less room there is for the spirit of God unforgiveness chokes out the life of God when C.S Lewis said to be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable because God has forgiven the inexcusable so now what what really where does with that bitterness that Paul was talking about that he was using the Esau as an example of that bitterness comes from anger and disappointment at being treated unfairly resentment so another let's let's take it take it deeper it's your expectation you're expecting to be treated in a certain way let's say for example maybe at work you go into your boss's office and you're and you're expecting him to be to agree with you and and he doesn't and you come out of there and something begins to start festering well I don't think I was treated it fairly or whatever and that little resentment begins to grow maybe maybe throughout your childhood you you didn't get the love that you felt like you needed to and it starts growing this This Bitter bitterness because you expected you expected something that you didn't get you you uh maybe maybe there's you just feel the devil's got you thinking a place where you don't you don't feel like you're worth nothing and uh you don't you know maybe somebody maybe you had a relationship where somebody cheated on you uh uh you know in in high school or wherever maybe maybe I hate to say it but maybe somebody's marital vial was broken and that caused you begin to to to be bitter and resentful and so these are the things that we're talking about maybe maybe somebody didn't have clothes or food on the table and they began to look at other people and think well why do they have a blessing let's see where that's what resentment can come to where you look at somebody else and their their life is blessed and it seems like that their every all their needs are being provided for maybe a young person looks at somebody else and sees their looks like their life is perfect or whatever and but because you think that you don't you're not getting what you deserve in your mind bitterness and resentment begins to grow and so all these things what it's all based on unrealistic expectations unrealistic expectations are premeditated resentments because you're going into the situation thinking I you got this expectation you already got it laid out how everything's going to pan out sometimes you know you you start coming to church and you've got an expectation of what church life is going to be and then it won't meet your expectations and the bitterness begins to grow in resentment because maybe maybe somebody is is invited to to sing a song and you feel like you should have been the one to sing it or something happened where you you know somebody else got treated a little bit maybe better somebody's name was mentioned from behind the pulpa and your name wasn't mentioned and then something begins to grow and fester something begins to like like that that uh what Max Lucado said that the pebble thrown into the pond they just looked and then it starts to grow and grow and grow now what are we talking about we're talking about how to how to deal with ourselves and with others because Paul said don't do like Esau where you you know you but you you you have these expectations that are not met and of course they weren't met in Esau's case because he made a bad decision and when he when his expectation for the for the birthright was not met he cried bitterly so you see where bitterness comes from it's from your expectation in Ephesians well let's go back to this quote so we want to brother Brown was saying God's provided a way of healing it you know he would explain how a a a a cancer or whatever starts from a bruise sale and he and it explains a sale that's backslidden they don't have a good healthy blood supply so what what the point is I'm not going to belabor the labor through reading all these quotes and everything but but just get to the point if you're you want to be a real healthy cell that has a real healthy relationship with God because God is where we get our supply maybe not so much from you know if you're relying so much on other people to to kind of feed you with a constant stream of adulation and and pats on the backs and things you know that's great and everything but one day that might fail and and where you get your your joy and your your your the Wellspring of everlasting life bubbling up within you your joy is from God so we want to be a real healthy sail in the body so that when when that little bitterness starts to grow out you can just you can you can stop it right in his tracks so that's what we're talking about this morning how do you deal with that bitterness like like Paul was saying Ephesians 4 Paul said let all bitterness and Wrath and anger and clamor and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice and be kind one to another now see there's here's how you deal with listen the devil don't know how to deal with love the devil does not know how to deal with somebody being kind to somebody that's evil and that's you can see how the whole everything that Jesus preached was about reconciliation and restoration when somebody smikes you on the face you don't Smite them back and that was the Old Testament way an ear for an ear an eye for an eye and all those things but when somebody does so or you can stop it right in its tracks if you're in touch with God and have communion with God a relationship with God where you're not relying on external feedback for your joy and your strength but you're trusting in your maker you're trusting in your father for all your strength amen and that will stop the devil writing his tracks when you can show love to hate be kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you now let's look it's bitterness is like a little plant growing it's like a seed and you can if you if you recognize what it is the devil trying to plant something in you you can say uh-uh I I don't want that and stop it right in this track so that's the best way to stop bitterness to stop it before it's planted right let's see look what it does and I know these are kind of small so I'm just going to skim through some of these it starts off with just bitterness starts off with just a little hurt experience and then it grows into resentment you start dwelling on it and then you're ruminating on it bitterness leads to constant rumination you all every day you wake up in the morning you're thinking about it and you go to sleep and you're thinking about it and it just rolls around in your head and then it turns into Grudge holding right yeah where grudges are prolonged feelings of bitterness where it might last years or months where you look back for years later and think still remember what somebody did to you because you never released it you never forgave that person and you see what what bitterness does it it hinders not the person that did the thing to you but it's hindering you that's why if you can understand yourself if we can understand ourselves then then we can be free of these things that the thing the trick of the devil to let some somebody do something maybe that hurts you and stung you and then it just impacts you maybe it was a bullet years ago in school that said something to you and the bully don't even remember but you've hung on to that and let it hinder you and and and and mess with your mind and uh building all these grudges and then it'll it'll it'll it look look what it does it keeps growing until it starts leading to manipulative Behavior where you're trying to control situations and people it escalates to hurtful Behavior because that's that's the Ripple in the pond it starts off with just bloop and now you're hurting other people in your life relationships you're hindering things it escalates out to stealth even to where people you know young people cutting themselves and doing all these things because they had expectations that were not met and that rippled and grew and grew and grew to the point where it started hurting and the Queen of Sheba brother Brown said somebody told me not long ago said brother Brown you know what happened this great organization is talking about that's always sponsor you you know what they did they ousted you they won't have nothing to do with you no more said they drove down their stake and said nobody received brother Brown anymore no think about that that would be something that's hurtful my goodness I've heard people tell stories about how that they were that one place brother random was supposed to speak at and he was supposed to be the speaker that night and then they got up behind the platform and said never mind uh brother Brown couldn't make it tonight and the brother looked over on the side and saw them escorting brother Brown him out and he was like what all these strange things happening in brother around his life and but brother random was mature enough to be able to handle it and look how he handled it he said I well I drove mine now I drove mine down too and went way out of past him and took them in that's just all of it that's that's all I take them in because a lot of God's children in there and that's right the message is to God's children not to any certain organization but to God's children they put me out I'll take them in by spreading mine a little wider and just take it in that's all so we must love one another keep the roots of bitterness out of us then God can go to working through us but till we get that then we're just fighting the wind true we got to love one another Jesus said by this all men will know you're my disciples right or wrong love anyhow so what can we do to keep bitterness from taking root let's go real deep okay let's study this out so we can examine ourselves first thing don't let it take root to begin with if the bitterness is like it's like a damn busty if the crack starts forming and before long the dam just all of a sudden you've got all this water coming through Proverbs 17 says the beginning of strife is as one one letteth out water therefore leave off contention before it be meddled with and uh second Samuel chapter 10 I was actually last night I was listening to brother Chad Lamb he was preaching a Wednesday night on this scripture the story of David and King noon and that is a that is a really awesome story if you go to listen to that what the story is about is David Goes King hanoon's father passed away so David's gonna go we'll say it like in modern terms he's going to send in some Hallmark cards and some greetings and some comfort and he goes and sends all these men to help him out well King hanoon his man got to tell him it's the devil got to tell him King David just wants to destroy you now see in that just like how the devil does sometimes and he got he got in his head that David wanted to destroy him but David was out he wanted to show love he was like I'm trying to help you out I'm sending you some casserole dishes I'm sending you some some broccoli surprise or whatever you know I'm I'm I'm sending you some help all these wagging loaves of help but King hanum got it in his head that David was out to destroy him that he was out for his hurt and and so instead of returning to love he said all right we're going to take these emissaries and we're going to cut half of their beard off and we're going to cook half of their garment off so that their their ear shows so that when they walk home they're walking home in shame and when David heard that he said okay and what did it do it started a war and see oh that's that's what the devil's tactic is he just wants he just wants to do stuff like that so there's step one don't don't even let it take root if you can recognize that it's the devil putting a thought in your mind about a brother or sister or something and say no I listen here's how you tackle Wilderness you begin to think about all the good things that that brother or that sister has done for you think about all the good things that your mother and father have done for you think about all the good things and that will begin to change your perception of the situation after king of noon had done that and begin to think well David was always there for my daddy he was always a comfort in time of need that would have changed the situation and they wouldn't have gone to war acknowledge your feelings now there's a there's a good first step the heart knoweth his own bitterness and a stranger does not enter medal with his Joy now what that means is is you know down in your heart whether you've got Joy or bitterness a stranger doesn't know you got joy if you've got real Joy nobody they're not really going to be able to enter into your joy like you can because it's in your heart and you you got that the same way with bitterness nobody really knows what what's in your heart but you so if you if you just really meditate y'all know how I'm a real fan of meditation and introspection if you just sit maybe in your car in the morning praying to God and thinking about you know is there anything like David used to pray is there anything wrong in my life is there anything that's that's off kilter you've been to think and really begin to acknowledge and think about your relationships is it is the reason why I act with this person or the reason why they treat me like this is it because of anything that I've done and you begin to acknowledge the things that are wrong in your life now so there is the first step to acknowledge now because if you don't know that there's bitterness in your life you can't handle it but if you recognize that there's bitterness then you can start to take action seek forgiveness forbearing one another and forgiving one another Paul said If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so also do you do ye no so there's the thing that if somebody does you wrong just be ready and quick to forgive them and to just release that from your life practice gratitude in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus concerning you like we were saying when you come to church you come expecting to receive something and you'll you'll you you when when you oh when you look at things it how you look determines how you will see it like that Deacon that that roll around talked about that that little girl wanting to run around asking everybody how can I see God and everybody said no until she finally got in touch with that Deacon who said everywhere I look I see God so if you're looking for a fault in your brother or sister you'll find a fall because I tell you what we all got plenty of Falls if you if you're looking for a laundry list of things that you can point out with somebody you'll find plenty but if you're looking for the good if you're looking for something that you can say well wow that's I I'm glad that that person is in my life that's what this is about practice gratitude how about how about this let go and let God in Romans chapter 12 it says dearly beloved avenge not yourselves but rather give Place unto Wrath for it is written vengeance is mine I will repay saith the Lord and when you examine really what forgiveness is forgiveness is the ability to release that desire for vengeance because when somebody does you wrong it's a natural human inclination to say I I'm going to restore I'm going to repay them for what they did for I want this to be exposed I want this to be revealed I want everybody to know what a what a grievous thing this is but it's a supernatural thing when you say I'm just going to release it I'm gonna I'm gonna turn it over to God whatever God wants to have happen let it's it's up to him but it's not it's not my it's not my job to to seek out retribution or or Vengeance vengeance is the Lord's and how about this cultivate a forgiving heart Matthew chapter 6 said for if you forgive men their trespasses your heavenly father will also forgive you so if we want to be forgiven to forgive others but if you forgive men not not men their trespasses neither will your father forgive your trespasses let's dive a little bit further what what is forgiveness forgiveness is pardoning someone for a wrongdoing or offense pardoning is wiping it wiping it away and choosing not to hold their actions against them choosing not to hold so you're not like holding it in your heart and saying I'm I'm not going to hold it against them now but give me six months and then I'm going to release it thank you letting go of negative feelings resentments and the desire for revenge or retaliation towards someone who has wronged you an intentional decision to let go of resentment and anger now that's why prayer and introspection is so important for when you get along with God and you begin to Lord you know help me to help you know you sometimes you can pray help me help me to release this okay it's beyond my ability help me to help me to let these things go oh it's something Supernatural is happening in the life of a Believer when you really forgive somebody that's we're coming up we're coming up to brotherly kindness and all those things that's why Colossians 3 12 says put on therefore is the elect of God holy and beloved bowels of mercies Mercy coming from within from deep within kindness humbleness of mine meekness long suffering now what's what's the devil going to do with something like that the devil gets in amongst the people but they've got something flowing from inside that's so kind and long-suffering that you can just berate and beat and and uh conk somebody over their head over and over but because they've got a relationship with God and there's a bubbling Wellspring of Life coming up within you just can't do anything to that person forbearing one another and forgiving one another If any man have a quarrel against any even as Christ forgave you so do also he Matthew Chapter 5 said you have heard that it has been said an eye for an eye on a tooth for a tooth I got this picture over here of Jesus putting that man's ear back on but look what look what the lesson Jesus is trying to Peter he saw Jesus being wrong and he immediately whipped his sword out which is our reaction a lot of times when we see something you know something a little bit off here comes the sword I love you know where you really start studying things out and you can see these little relationships between the disciples why why I'm just putting a little question why is it that Matthew said you know I don't know who cut the ear off of this garden and Mark said I don't know we can't say Luke said I don't know but John was like it was Peter you did it your first Peter said for for even here unto where you call because Christ also suffered for us leaving us an example that ye should follow his steps who did no sin neither was God found in his mouth who when he was reviled reviled not again when he suffered he threatened not but committed to him committed himself to him that judgeth righteously now every Christian wants to be like Jesus and that's all of our road map that we're trying to we're trying to get to a place where we're like Jesus he is our example that's what we're trying to model our life after in trying to be like to where there's no guile in our mouth to where when somebody reviles us we don't revile back that when we suffer we don't threaten back when anything was uh he was able to deal with any situation in Luke chapter 6 it says but I say unto you which here love love your enemies do good to them which hate you bless them that curse you and pray for them which despitefully use you and unto him the samothy on the One Cheek offer also the other and him that taketh away thy cloak forbid not to take that coat also that's a that seems like a pretty big ass doesn't it but that's what God is asking us to do in first Thessalonians 5 15 he said see that none render evil for evil unto any man what's something else I can do to keep bitterness from from overtaking is practice self-control and James 1 it says be wherefore my beloved Brethren let every man be swift to hear be quick to listen just listen to somebody we're so quick to just talk over one another and Buddy in and not listen like but listen oh you find all these Proverbs all these lessons in the New Testament about close your mouth and open your ears oh if we could follow those simple rules that would take care of a lot of things Swift to ear here slow to speak slow to Wrath for the wrath of man worketh not the righteousness of God amen and let's get rid of all the negative thoughts that's what Paul or in Philippians he said finally Brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things so when you're driving home from work and you're thinking about how your wife ain't cause she probably ain't gonna have dinner ready for she's get rid of those negative thoughts think something positive when when you're when you're riding around you're thinking about that person at church that just did something wrong to get rid of that negative thought and think about all the good things because I guarantee you that we've got plenty of good things to think about we've got all we've got things to think about the benefits of God what God did for us to people that just so many things that go on and on and Release Control just put it in God cast everything over to God be still and know that I am God I will be exhausted among the Heathen I will be exalted in the earth yes and pray because Bible says he healeth the broken and heart and bindeth up their wounds and practice love be your kind one to another tenderhearted forgiving one another even as Christ even as God for Christ's sake hath forgiven you yes brother Brown said love one another above everything love one another no matter what the devil tries to say now this is supposed to be a picture of somebody in church spreading poison it's kind of hard to make that out maybe but he's in a church spreading poison he said now you're all one great big sweet group now but remember my warning see Satan won't let that stay that way Satan's gonna do just like he tried to do the king Hanan get in there and spread put a lie in somebody's mind somebody's trying to come with love and you uh they're they're out for evil he'll shoot everything if he has to bring somebody in to make his Target he'll bring some critic or unbeliever in and sitting down and cause him to fellowship with you under the quietness and things and then he'll shoot that guy with some kind of a poison stuff just like in this picture here and he'll start through the church with it don't you take sides with it don't you have nothing to do with anything else you stay right loving and sweet and kind to one another pray for that man that he'll be saved too or that woman or ever who it is just pray for them and stick one with another now that's what Paul was talking about as we close and the musicians come forward Paul was talking about don't be bitter like Esau was and the Esau was bitter because his expectation of the of the promise was not met of course he made the bad decision but when our expectations are not mad let's don't be bitter God bless you foreign
