[7:41] thank you for the day thank you for the
[7:43] time that we have this night to be able
[7:45] to come together Lord and just to to sit
[7:47] down for a little bit under the shade
[7:49] trees of your gospel and let you speak
[7:51] to our hearts that we may Lord learn
[7:54] from you so we ask you to just guide
[7:57] each and every one of us forgive our
[7:58] sins bless those Lord that are not able
[8:01] to be here tonight and just be with each
[8:03] one forgive all of us of our failures
[8:06] and let your love be with us we ask you
[8:08] to just keep us and guide us in the
[8:12] understanding because that's our desire
[8:15] we desire one thing from you that you
[8:17] open your word that we may walk therein
[8:20] have your way now Lord and we commit it
[8:22] all to you now keep us in Jesus name
[8:27] amen Matthew 5 that we've been reading
[8:30] verse 37-
[8:34] 48 but let your communication be yay yay
[8:37] nay nay for what soever is more than
[8:40] these cometh of evil you have heard that
[8:42] it hath been said and I for an i Toth
[8:45] for a tooth but I say unto you that ye
[8:47] resist not evil but whosoever shall
[8:50] smite thee on thy right cheek turn to
[8:53] him the other also and if any man will
[8:56] suo thee at the law and take away thy
[8:59] coat let him have thy cloak also now
[9:02] remember the Beatitudes before this and
[9:04] now the Lord Jesus is setting in a in
[9:07] motion or are defining what would be a
[9:10] real true Christian and what he was
[9:13] doing because this is what he done these
[9:16] things and he's setting this down as a
[9:18] motion to the disciples and things to
[9:21] see what it would be when they would
[9:23] come on over into the kingdom all right
[9:25] and see then that would be for you and I
[9:28] also
[9:31] and whosoever shall compel thee to go a
[9:33] mile go with him Twain give to him that
[9:36] asketh thee and from him that would
[9:37] borrow of thee turn not thou away ye
[9:40] have heard that it hath been said Thou
[9:42] shalt love thy neighbor and hate thine
[9:45] enemy but I say unto you love your
[9:47] enemies bless them that curse you do
[9:50] good to them that hate you and pray for
[9:51] them which despitefully use you and
[9:54] persecute you that you may be the
[9:56] children of your father see if we walk
[9:59] in this we the children of the father
[10:01] expected to walk in this like this that
[10:04] you may be the children of your father
[10:06] which is in heaven for he maketh his son
[10:07] to rise on the evil and on the good and
[10:10] sth rain on the just and on the unjust
[10:13] for if you love them which love you what
[10:15] reward have you do not even the
[10:18] publicans to same and if you salute your
[10:21] brethren only what do you more than
[10:23] others do not even the publicans also
[10:26] publicans so be therefore perfect even
[10:29] as your father which is in heaven is
[10:32] perfect now we'll go to Hebrews
[10:38] 7 begin reading CU this is kind of where
[10:42] we left off on our
[10:44] thought if therefore Perfection were by
[10:47] the levitical priesthood or under it the
[10:50] people receive the law what further need
[10:53] was there that another priest should
[10:55] rise after the order of mzc and not be
[10:59] called after the order of Aaron for the
[11:02] priesthood being changed there is made a
[11:05] necessity a change also of the law for
[11:09] he of whom these things are spoken
[11:12] pertaineth to another
[11:14] tribe of which no man gave attendance at
[11:17] the altar now that's you know that be
[11:20] whole message in itself CU they come out
[11:23] of the tribe of Judah right for it is
[11:25] evident that our Lord sprang out of
[11:27] Judah of which tribe Moses nothing
[11:29] concerning
[11:30] priesthood and it is yet far more
[11:34] evident or that after the similitude of
[11:38] MDC there ariseth another priest who is
[11:41] made not after the law of a carnal
[11:44] commandment but after the power of an
[11:47] endless life amen you may be seated the
[11:50] Lord add his Blessing to the reading of
[11:53] the
[11:54] word now remember our thought when we
[11:57] left off was as we've been speaking on
[12:01] be therefore
[12:03] perfect and
[12:05] we I hope that it hasn't been boredom
[12:09] right to you know to you to keep on
[12:13] repeating these things that's right
[12:15] because the one thing that I I believe
[12:20] and we'll get to it after a while if
[12:22] it's not revealed to
[12:24] us then we're just following after the
[12:28] letter of the law that's right and now
[12:31] if you ask people
[12:33] today you know
[12:36] 99.9% of the people of the religious
[12:39] realm if you ask them when did the law
[12:42] end they would say that it ended at
[12:44] Calvary
[12:48] right but
[12:50] remember if we don't have the new
[12:54] birth now I've taught you this ever
[12:56] since the beginning of what I tried to
[12:58] to preach I mean talking about 40 years
[13:02] if we don't have the new
[13:04] birth the law is still in existence amen
[13:08] that's right now you might not like that
[13:10] or whatever but it's still true right
[13:14] and we will be condemned by the law y
[13:16] right because the law was spiritual
[13:19] right amen you remember Paul yes sir he
[13:22] said but I'm carnal so understand he
[13:26] said but see then that spiritual law
[13:31] would be have only the effects of being
[13:33] able to condemn
[13:36] mhm and it couldn't save us cuz there
[13:39] there is no salvation in the law right
[13:42] that's right all right that was the
[13:44] point we were trying to bring when I
[13:46] asked the question uh were the people of
[13:48] the Old Testament made perfect
[13:52] by keeping of the
[13:55] law or were they made perfect by the
[13:59] atonement that they made all right so
[14:03] now I tried to bring that to a
[14:05] conclusion to see that no matter how
[14:08] good you can keep the law it would still
[14:10] not save you right amen all right we're
[14:14] going to get to that on righteousness
[14:15] next and we'll find out a few words on
[14:18] it you know of taking it and going
[14:21] through it
[14:24] but see if we could keep the law
[14:26] perfectly to the letter Paul said he was
[14:29] blindess
[14:31] sureen well why didn't Jesus just drop
[14:33] down on the on that you know there when
[14:35] he was on his Road uh and the pillar of
[14:38] fire came down why didn't he just drop
[14:39] down and say Paul you've been doing
[14:42] great you already Sav I don't need to
[14:45] die for
[14:48] you now you say well we don't think that
[14:52] way brother
[14:54] Dale but listen church if it's not
[14:58] revealed I don't care who you are I am
[15:01] who or anybody
[15:04] is our carnal part of our
[15:07] mind will
[15:10] always try to make some
[15:13] form of a way that we didn't do
[15:17] something or we did do something or this
[15:20] that or the other as trying to be part
[15:22] of our Salvation
[15:24] right that's right and then especially
[15:27] after coming to Salvation
[15:29] we will try to make some form of
[15:32] works as to show you know what we are in
[15:38] in
[15:39] in Saving ourselves well if you don't
[15:42] get anything out of the message tonight
[15:43] you get one
[15:44] thing we'll read it in a minute the
[15:46] prophet said if you could do one thing y
[15:49] to save yourself y Christ died and Bain
[15:52] that's right amen all right
[15:55] now so we better believe in it mhm and
[15:59] accept it right and see For Heaven's
[16:02] Sake don't go into the realm well then
[16:05] if I'm saved by grace it don't make no
[16:08] difference what I
[16:09] do I'm
[16:12] saved now that's disgrace
[16:15] amen you turn the grace of God into
[16:18] lasciviousness to believe Satan's
[16:20] lie right all
[16:23] right but
[16:27] now if the keeping of the law Paul says
[16:32] here in
[16:34] Hebrews if it could have done any good
[16:37] why did they change the priesthood right
[16:41] why didn't Jesus come of the order of
[16:43] error
[16:45] right he came after the order of
[16:48] MDC and there was even no
[16:52] mention of this
[16:55] one it was only speaking law Aaron the
[16:59] priesthood and all the priests only
[17:01] spoke of Jesus Christ
[17:03] right because even Moses never even
[17:06] mentioned him right the scripture said
[17:10] you know as far as a priest the
[17:12] scripture said that he would come out of
[17:14] the tribe of
[17:16] Judah that's
[17:18] right see not after the order of
[17:22] Aon but after the order of Aaron see you
[17:25] went right back under the levitical
[17:26] priesthood the law
[17:29] all right we see if if we look at the
[17:33] law and the keeping of the
[17:36] law as to what has saved us Jesus Christ
[17:39] there was no purpose for him dying right
[17:42] amen so then there had to be another
[17:45] priesthood
[17:46] come and even now
[17:49] watch even as under the
[17:53] law to show that what would be the right
[17:56] one melz
[18:00] came into existence right while the law
[18:03] was in existence right with
[18:08] mankind all
[18:10] right now I know that that was back and
[18:13] I know the Bible of what it was back
[18:14] before so just don't get the wrong idea
[18:17] get what I'm
[18:19] saying now chdc came in a position to
[18:23] were that man was only going to be able
[18:27] to follow the law by the
[18:30] letter and it was added because of the
[18:33] transgressions of man and because we
[18:36] wanted it that's right that's right yep
[18:39] the prophet of God said they didn't get
[18:42] what they thought they got that's right
[18:45] he said they got God in letter form amen
[18:49] that's why Paul would call it
[18:53] spiritual but he said my understanding
[18:56] of the law yep that's is what's killed
[18:59] me that's
[19:02] right our understanding of life is
[19:05] what's killed us
[19:08] amen we teach our children to be good
[19:11] that's
[19:12] wonderful but do we teach them that to
[19:15] be good is going to save
[19:21] them see that's not correct
[19:25] right he said we need to teach them to
[19:28] be good
[19:31] yes right
[19:33] sure but don't teach them that that's
[19:36] going to save them right
[19:41] right the prophet of God said you women
[19:43] don't think because you got long hair
[19:45] and long dresses that that means you're
[19:47] saved that's right am he was blowing
[19:50] about
[19:51] it but you see what I'm trying to do is
[19:55] to break that spell that Satan has over
[19:57] our eyes and the biggest spell he has
[20:01] over our eyes is one
[20:03] thing is the thing that we thought we
[20:06] think that he don't have it over our
[20:08] eyes
[20:10] yeah that's the biggest
[20:13] spell you understand right wording right
[20:17] see the biggest Spell satan can have
[20:19] over our eyes is to tell us there's
[20:21] nothing over our
[20:23] eyes that's
[20:25] right that's right he tells us we're
[20:27] good yeah right well look if You' done
[20:31] like other people God wouldn't have
[20:32] saved
[20:34] you you said well I I never have
[20:36] believed that brother Dale but what do
[20:38] you
[20:41] believe well now what it is is I always
[20:45] was this then now you're going the other
[20:48] way I always was eternal I always was
[20:52] this and seeds and doctrines and ideas
[20:55] and say you can't get it to go in one
[20:56] way you go the other way sure he sees
[20:59] the people getting a little
[21:01] free from the bondage of of legalism
[21:05] that's right yeah bu you know keep of
[21:09] letter and when he does he'll
[21:11] automatically jump right
[21:13] over and start throwing us
[21:15] into a greasy Grace situation you know
[21:19] that's right they don't matter what I do
[21:22] then Jesus died for me it don't matter
[21:24] what I done that's why I spent so much
[21:27] time
[21:30] expressing that under the Old
[21:34] Testament that it was an honest and a
[21:36] contract heart that God forgave that's
[21:39] right that's right everybody that
[21:41] offered a sacrifice wasn't forgiven
[21:44] that's right
[21:46] right now that's the reason I kept
[21:49] bearing on to that
[21:51] point because then coming over where
[21:53] we're at
[21:55] now see we're going to follow one of the
[21:58] the two right that's right yeah it's
[22:00] hard to fall or follow the middle of the
[22:03] of the road right in the natural it's
[22:07] tilted off so Bri's going water's going
[22:09] to run off it's hard on me and you to
[22:12] try to find the middle of the road and
[22:14] walk therein amen amen because our human
[22:18] element will automatically lean back to
[22:21] legalism y I don't do this I don't do
[22:25] that God saved me because I was a good
[22:28] person well if he saves you because he a
[22:30] good person you didn't need saving no
[22:34] right that's why I used a Rich Young
[22:36] Ruler he said he had kept the
[22:40] Commandments true amen
[22:43] right but when he asked the Lord about
[22:45] eternal life because evidently he'd
[22:48] heard this man speaking on something
[22:50] else more than what we've got you
[22:54] know when he asked him he said they said
[22:57] they said I've kept it from my you you
[23:00] know what Jesus loved him because of
[23:02] that you know he's looking at a good
[23:04] righteous
[23:06] man
[23:07] y but he said one one thing like
[23:12] us he knew exactly where his trouble
[23:16] was and see that's what I'm trying to
[23:18] get me and you to look
[23:20] at right said I'm trying to bring this
[23:24] down to a to a conclusion of talking
[23:27] about
[23:28] being perfect then we're going into
[23:31] righteousness and peace and joy and
[23:34] different things you
[23:35] know
[23:37] but I want you to see one
[23:41] thing our carnal mind will lean
[23:48] automatically and we'll try to figure
[23:50] out some way or some
[23:52] reason that God would save us
[23:56] right
[23:59] see then if that don't work as I said
[24:02] Satan will throw us over on the other
[24:03] side and he said well see there then if
[24:05] I'm saved it don't matter what I
[24:08] do
[24:10] right yep ain't no law going to condemn
[24:14] me brother was riding down the road one
[24:16] day listen brother R him on the tape and
[24:18] he began to lay down some things about
[24:20] what was in the man's life you know he
[24:23] took the tape out and throw it in the
[24:24] back seat and his wife said and said he
[24:26] said there ain't no man going to tell
[24:28] me well they just said what most people
[24:31] have in their mind
[24:34] right see then there's a middle of the
[24:37] road to find what it
[24:42] is the middle of the road is the new
[24:44] birth amen
[24:48] right and even with the new
[24:51] birth that's
[24:53] right Satan will try his best to sir
[24:57] take us one way or the other amen
[25:02] right and if I'm wrong you come and
[25:04] correct me now I'm talking about you and
[25:07] me amen me first you second
[25:12] okay that Satan will do everything he
[25:15] can to get us off of that middle of the
[25:17] road that's
[25:18] right but the middle of the road is the
[25:20] New Birth the revealed
[25:26] word how much has your Prophet
[25:29] preached against the things of
[25:33] life
[25:36] right I mean wasn't it the hardest
[25:38] preacher that's ever been on those
[25:40] things right of
[25:42] Life
[25:44] yep and
[25:45] yet seemingly turn around in the same
[25:49] sermon and say what you do and don't do
[25:52] don't have anything to do with it
[25:55] right right why because he's trying to
[25:58] explain a
[26:01] truth the Bible said salvation I believe
[26:03] it's Jonah 2:9 said salvation is of the
[26:06] Lord amen that's
[26:09] right works is supposed to be our faith
[26:15] expressed that's
[26:17] right so then salvation is not what we
[26:20] do or don't
[26:22] do it's based upon whether we can accept
[26:25] what he has done right amen
[26:31] if we can accept what he's
[26:34] done then he can pay the price amen
[26:37] right I thought we believe that he made
[26:39] intercession Upon Our confession right
[26:41] right amen our profession and which way
[26:43] you want to use the
[26:47] word well then he's depending upon us to
[26:51] confess the truth that's right mhm he
[26:54] said You shall know the truth and it'll
[26:56] make you free amen right
[26:59] well see then the new birth don't give
[27:00] you a right to just live like the devil
[27:02] that's right you think it that way you
[27:05] are the devil that's just I don't you
[27:07] know that's where people say brother
[27:09] Dale You Don't Preach against this or
[27:11] you don't preach against that that's the
[27:12] way I preach
[27:16] it don't tell me sisters you're still
[27:18] cutting your hair and tell me you're Sav
[27:22] that's right no you're lost
[27:26] amen you p your face you're
[27:31] lost you see I don't spend weeks
[27:34] preaching sermons then so then people
[27:36] think she just you know just don't make
[27:38] no
[27:39] difference how much stronger can I get
[27:41] it that's
[27:45] right if we live like the devil we are
[27:48] the
[27:49] devil right well just a little bit what
[27:54] did he
[27:56] do that's
[27:58] right that's the way I preach it and I
[28:01] know it's
[28:03] hard see because I'm I'm trying to get
[28:05] you and I to get in that middle of the
[28:07] road amen amen that's
[28:10] right that by the new
[28:14] birth he has saved us and gave us
[28:17] eternal life amen that's
[28:22] right and he made the way to cover amen
[28:26] are the atonement
[28:30] see the difference between the old and
[28:31] the new in the Old Testament they had to
[28:34] make an
[28:35] atonement they had to take an animal
[28:37] they had to do those
[28:42] things but you see we don't have to do
[28:45] anything right all we got to believe is
[28:46] what he done
[28:49] right see we believe what he does he
[28:52] takes care of everything right that's it
[28:55] amen see now there's the middle of the
[28:59] Road and see then if I do do wrong I
[29:04] Repent right right amen cuz if I don't
[29:08] repent I'm going to have to answer for
[29:10] that right how much straighter can
[29:12] anybody
[29:14] preach
[29:16] right if I don't repent of any sin I
[29:19] commit I'm going to have to answer for
[29:21] that one
[29:24] day all right then I have to explain
[29:27] that that doesn't mean I'm lost right
[29:30] but if I keep on going in that
[29:32] line you know and I say well it really
[29:35] don't make no
[29:37] difference he saved me then I prove I'm
[29:40] lost that's right do you
[29:46] understand see we prove whether we're
[29:48] saved or we're lost by the life we live
[29:50] right
[29:54] right you say well what about our
[29:56] trouble Christians have troubles sure
[30:00] Christians have an advocate with the
[30:02] Bible
[30:04] says we have an atonement that was made
[30:06] for
[30:08] us we don't even have to take the animal
[30:11] up and do it right he paid the price
[30:15] right but because you're a Christian
[30:17] doesn't mean that you can live like the
[30:23] devil see we ought to be more
[30:26] conscious conscious that's right you
[30:29] know people on the internet sometime
[30:31] hear my words and Southern I'm sorry but
[30:34] we want to be more concerned about our
[30:36] lives after becoming a Christian than
[30:39] before right
[30:44] amen because the prophet of God said we
[30:47] s a sin as a Christian we will reap a
[30:50] tub full off of it
[30:53] amen well it don't make no difference
[30:55] I'm a Christian I'm going to
[30:59] heaven not with that
[31:02] attitude not with the attitude it don't
[31:04] matter what I do
[31:07] right so I'm more conscious of my life
[31:10] today than I ever have been in my life
[31:12] anywhere
[31:17] right cuz I want it
[31:21] right it's not that I don't want to have
[31:24] to answer
[31:25] there for it but because we have as
[31:28] Christians we have the Judgment of the
[31:30] Deeds Done in the body whether good or
[31:31] bad right not the white Throne judgment
[31:34] that's not a decision of eternal
[31:38] life it's Deeds Done in the body whether
[31:40] good or bad and we're going to have to
[31:42] answer for those times
[31:44] right so that's why marriage and divorce
[31:46] had to be preed right to where it could
[31:50] take care of those
[31:53] situations cuz if not we would have had
[31:55] to answer for that all
[31:59] right but see then that don't make it
[32:03] disgrace nope that's right see if we
[32:06] think that well it doesn't matter what I
[32:09] do I'm saved anyway where's the Bible
[32:13] for
[32:16] that he said look at David how bad he
[32:19] was yeah I'm glad you thought of that
[32:21] one but you better look at David and see
[32:23] what he had
[32:25] too David had and a contrite heart David
[32:29] had a repented attitude about him that's
[32:34] right he was concerned about
[32:37] himself going home from the bed of basba
[32:40] the prophet of God said he done that
[32:43] scripture part where it says return unto
[32:45] me the joy of thy salvation
[32:50] right see I'm trying to get you and I to
[32:52] see what really true Grace is what True
[32:55] Perfection really is remember how we
[32:58] brought it out perfect means that your
[32:59] the Old Testament people were perfect
[33:01] right because when they offered the
[33:03] atonement God couldn't see them
[33:07] right we have an atonement made God
[33:09] can't see
[33:12] us but
[33:15] Perfection has to do with the inward
[33:18] part of God coming down and revealing
[33:21] his word to bring us into those
[33:24] situations that we need to be brought to
[33:26] right reveal
[33:30] word then if we believe and this is the
[33:32] way I do believe it I believe the new
[33:34] birth is the birth of the word amen
[33:38] right I believe it's the word revealed
[33:40] to you that saves you that's right not
[33:43] reading
[33:46] it not how much you can read
[33:52] it but when it's
[33:55] revealed
[33:57] right you think Paul hadn't read
[34:02] it you think he hadn't studied
[34:05] it you think he couldn't have quoted it
[34:07] to
[34:10] you but he said I found that to be death
[34:14] of my
[34:18] understanding then he said it's Christ
[34:20] in you the hope of glory
[34:23] amen he went to Rome to die yeah he
[34:28] wanted to die because of his life that
[34:31] he had lived before becoming a
[34:35] Christian never argued and complained
[34:37] about the daily life of of beat what
[34:41] five times shipwreck two or three
[34:43] times peils of Brethren Perils of this
[34:48] you know what argu about
[34:50] right cuz he was headed
[34:54] Calvary he wanted to give his life for
[34:56] what he done
[34:57] done he knew that wouldn't save
[35:00] him he never thought giving his life
[35:03] would save him
[35:07] right what do you think about Paul you
[35:09] ever thought about him what about a man
[35:12] that would be a Christian come to be a
[35:15] Christian I've heard tals of some of you
[35:19] heard brother R speak of in Pat Tower he
[35:22] was a
[35:23] gangster they said he would drive by a
[35:25] cemetery and say I wonder how many
[35:27] people I put out
[35:34] there you mean to tell me me that you
[35:37] and I can live like the devil and then
[35:39] become a Christian and then not be not
[35:42] ever think about our former life in the
[35:43] basis of sure what we
[35:47] were and how much grace it took of God
[35:50] to save us amen that's
[35:55] right and the concern that we have of
[36:00] what we used to be that we certainly
[36:02] don't want to be that anymore amen Paul
[36:06] said causing people to
[36:10] blashe he was putting a Christian he was
[36:13] resting them but he was putting them to
[36:16] death he said causing them to
[36:19] blaspheme y you think that didn't bother
[36:22] him all of his life
[36:25] am you think he didn't think about all
[36:28] of those people that he made
[36:33] blasphemy and you know what he's meaning
[36:35] by
[36:37] that he's meaning that some of those
[36:39] people recanted their
[36:43] thoughts that's right they took back
[36:46] their confession that they were
[36:51] Christians come on or why would he be
[36:53] saying causing them to blashe right
[36:59] he he caused them to deny the Lord
[37:02] Jesus
[37:06] right why shouldn't you and I be
[37:08] concerned about our lives right
[37:13] amen why why shouldn't we be concerned
[37:15] every moment of the
[37:18] day of how that we live before others
[37:20] and what they see
[37:25] right he said well it ain't my
[37:30] fault
[37:33] well could it be
[37:37] though you remember what your prophet of
[37:40] God said one unconfessed to sin in a
[37:43] church would cause a church to bitterly
[37:45] fail
[37:46] right did you say that amen and he said
[37:50] that and that judgment you'll have to
[37:53] answer for that we don't quote the rest
[37:56] to what he
[38:01] said what about
[38:08] it did I get off my man
[38:11] on but
[38:15] listen there was a
[38:18] necessity that they be another
[38:22] priesthood after the order of mzed right
[38:28] which was was not after a carnal
[38:30] commandment but after the power Paul
[38:33] says of an endless life
[38:36] y that mzd with almighty God Amen
[38:40] according to Hebrews about 7:4 even
[38:42] calls him a
[38:44] man brother Brown said we see no more of
[38:47] mzc he said because he became Jesus
[38:50] Christ
[38:54] amen what about a a
[39:01] priesthood that knew the priest would
[39:04] have to
[39:06] die none none of the others wanted to
[39:09] die right I mean come on we're on his
[39:11] people Aon didn't want to die none of
[39:13] them wanted to die right and they done
[39:15] everything they could dress right to the
[39:17] tea done everything make sure it's right
[39:19] to make sure they didn't
[39:23] die but our savior had to die right half
[39:29] right for you and I
[39:35] amen that we could
[39:38] live a high priest that would have to
[39:41] die how many people want to volunteer
[39:44] for high priest if you know the high
[39:45] priest got to
[39:46] die that's
[39:49] right I mean probably be small
[39:52] priesthood would it
[39:55] right
[39:58] but
[39:59] yet that
[40:02] atonement and
[40:04] listen
[40:06] mzd now listen to what I'm
[40:09] saying mzd coming into existence under
[40:14] the form of the Old
[40:16] Testament could not bring eternal life
[40:20] oh that's
[40:24] right oh
[40:26] he couldn't bring eternal
[40:29] life he was eternal life amen right
[40:32] that's right but he couldn't transmit
[40:34] that no right no
[40:39] way but the only way that we could get
[40:43] eternal life was for
[40:45] mzd
[40:47] yep which is almighty God Amen he had to
[40:51] become human flesh amen yes
[40:55] sir in order to die to make the
[40:58] atonement for us CU see mezic only spoke
[41:03] of the coming Messiah amen that's
[41:08] right M jic only spoke of the coming
[41:11] Messiah that's
[41:13] right he only spoke of the time that he
[41:16] would have to come into flesh y to die
[41:21] amen that we could get eternal
[41:24] life what about it
[41:30] and that true
[41:32] atonement that was made back there was
[41:34] the blood of bulls and goats right M
[41:37] amen right that Jesus Christ couldn't
[41:41] come over and say okay go get me some
[41:44] Lambs
[41:47] right no that wouldn't work right
[41:52] right but see male chesd stepped into
[41:55] human flesh
[41:58] almighty God into human
[42:02] flesh to where that we could have an
[42:08] atonement that would be
[42:11] made to cover us which is the blood of
[42:15] the Lord
[42:18] right all
[42:21] right the blood of the
[42:25] Lord right
[42:27] what about
[42:29] that go ahead brother Anderson pull up
[42:32] number
[42:35] one what about that blood of the
[42:38] lord well brother D was just a man he
[42:41] born a man he died a man he just a man
[42:44] Lord
[42:47] mer what about that blood
[42:51] right whose blood was
[42:53] it what good would it be for for one man
[42:56] to die for another man that's
[43:02] right would that save
[43:06] you so look what your Prophet had to say
[43:10] page 34 Church AG book which is really
[43:15] Revelations the revelation of Jesus
[43:17] Christ Church age
[43:20] book the word was is actually
[43:24] loosed loosed us from our sins in his
[43:27] own
[43:32] blood in his own
[43:37] blood isn't that
[43:40] wonderful but are you spiritual
[43:43] minded did you catch it in other words
[43:46] has it been revealed to you
[43:49] right it was his own
[43:51] blood that loosed us completely from our
[43:54] sins amen it was not human
[43:58] blood it was the blood of God yes
[44:02] sir and watch
[44:05] it Peter called it the blood of
[44:12] Christ Paul called it the blood of the
[44:15] Lord the blood of
[44:18] Jesus he said that's not three person
[44:20] that's just
[44:24] one now
[44:32] it's called the blood of Jesus in
[44:33] Hebrews 10 and
[44:37] 19 the blood of Jesus 1 Peter 1 and
[44:42] 2 1 John 1:17 is called the blood of
[44:48] Jesus now this got these where I could
[44:51] put them in and I didn't ask them to put
[44:52] them on
[44:54] there it's it's called the blood of the
[44:57] Lord in 1
[44:59] Corinthians
[45:04] 11:27 it's called the blood of Christ
[45:08] Ephesians
[45:10] 2:13 1 Corinthians
[45:12] 1016 1 Peter 1 and 19 Hebrews 9 and
[45:21] 14 it talks of the blood of
[45:24] God
[45:26] amen Revelations 1
[45:28] and5 Hebrews 13 and 12
[45:33] yeah Hebrews 9
[45:35] and10 he calls it Jesus
[45:40] Christ the blood of God Acts 20 and 28
[45:45] right talks about God's own blood right
[45:48] amen
[45:49] amen so now if the prophet's right and
[45:52] there's not three persons in that quote
[45:54] we were reading
[45:56] there just one person
[46:00] right then it was the blood of God that
[46:03] loosed us amen that's right it was the
[46:06] blood of Jesus it was the blood of
[46:08] Christ it was the blood of the Lord amen
[46:11] so there's no Foundation whatsoever to
[46:13] believe anything other than that that
[46:15] blood was the blood of almighty God Amen
[46:17] that's
[46:18] right oh I am just created you know well
[46:23] it's God's blood that he created amen
[46:29] and see we're loosed by the blood
[46:32] amen but is that being revealed to
[46:38] us she were
[46:41] perfect by the
[46:43] atonement right and the atonement
[46:46] required the blood of
[46:49] God that's
[46:52] right it required the blood of Jesus yep
[46:56] right it required the blood of Christ
[46:58] amen and the blood of the Lord amen so
[47:02] it's now all of that is not the selfs
[47:04] same
[47:05] person then brother randam couldn't have
[47:07] said that that omnipotent right Jehovah
[47:12] God came down in flesh that's
[47:17] right what is our atonement right well
[47:21] we in the New Testament we don't need an
[47:22] atonement we that's what they're saying
[47:24] now
[47:27] no I mean this is 10 15 years ago they
[47:29] saying we was already in the Millennium
[47:31] so it didn't matter how many wives you
[47:33] had how much he done what was wrong
[47:34] didn't make no difference because we
[47:36] under another
[47:38] Covenant now show me that in the Bible
[47:41] the prophet's message that's
[47:43] right if not that's a
[47:47] lie right but you see people don't want
[47:50] you to be set
[47:54] straight but why not
[47:58] amen why can't we be straight
[48:02] right in this day
[48:06] especially you know the prophet of God
[48:08] said the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[48:11] the most important thing in your life
[48:13] that's right now that quote is just a
[48:14] little different and I hadn't been able
[48:16] to find exactly the wording of it but
[48:20] it's in there I'll just have to keep
[48:22] searching and I'll bring it to you cuz
[48:24] we quote a lot you know sometimes we
[48:26] miss a word and it won't come up with a
[48:28] computer but if you look at the number
[48:31] two quotes you'll see the unchangeable
[48:33] god working in an
[48:36] unexpectable way preach 1962
[48:43] 120 and now you must make that the first
[48:46] thing in your life whether you eat again
[48:49] or whether you drink again or whether
[48:50] you sleep again or whatever you do you
[48:53] must find that that's right that must be
[48:56] the first thing that's it just stay
[48:58] right with God's promise he promised it
[49:00] to you so you just stay right with it
[49:03] see and God will bring it to pass
[49:07] amen what the New
[49:11] Birth the new birth is the most
[49:13] important thing that we could ever think
[49:16] of cuz if we don't have the new birth we
[49:18] can't even start talking about being
[49:22] perfect
[49:24] right cuz you
[49:26] see the atonement of the animal couldn't
[49:30] be brought in no
[49:35] right now the natural Jew is still under
[49:37] the atonement of animals and they're
[49:39] still trying to do those things and
[49:41] sacrifice them and they're waiting on
[49:44] the red heler and the different
[49:50] things but we don't have an atonement
[49:52] that we have to keep making cuz the
[49:54] Bible said he died
[49:56] once
[49:58] amen but if we don't have an atonement
[50:01] where are we
[50:06] right Paul says we have an advocate with
[50:09] the father Jesus Christ the righteous
[50:12] one who stands in our
[50:15] place where could we ever think as I've
[50:17] read you quotes over and over to think
[50:19] of anything that we you know could stand
[50:22] before
[50:24] God
[50:26] and think that we were in any way
[50:29] righteous right or just or Pure or
[50:40] perfect would it save us if we could
[50:42] find something that we could
[50:46] do what about that's right look at the
[50:50] next
[50:51] one adoption 19 6522 morning
[50:56] service he said I needed
[50:59] saving there was nothing could save me
[51:03] there's nothing I could do about
[51:06] myself I could no more save myself than
[51:08] nothing amen but I needed saving because
[51:11] I believed in God look
[51:14] at and God sent his son made in the
[51:17] likeness of sinful flesh to suffer in my
[51:19] place and I was saved by grace alone was
[51:23] I saved not one thing could I do or you
[51:27] do to save yourself yep and those who he
[51:30] fornew before the foundation of the
[51:33] world thank you Lord amen what about it
[51:36] amen anything you can think
[51:41] of as a reason for God to save
[51:48] you that's right no better believe it's
[51:53] by Grace amen that's right
[51:56] and then just don't run off into
[51:58] disgrace look what he said here you am
[52:00] 1957 3:10 the evening
[52:04] service oh we don't want
[52:07] Justice would you dare to say that you
[52:10] want Justice would you dare to try to go
[52:13] to heaven on your own keeping of the
[52:15] laws and legalistic things you do if
[52:18] that was all right Christ died in
[52:23] vain the law is not a remedy right there
[52:27] amen a law is the magnifying GL to show
[52:31] you
[52:33] sin it's the one who can put you in
[52:36] prison it's the law but it has no
[52:40] redemption in
[52:41] it now listen I made this statement over
[52:44] and over to where people won't
[52:45] misunderstand you there was Redemption
[52:48] under the law right to those who made
[52:50] the atonements and things right but the
[52:52] law had no
[52:54] Redemption
[52:56] the law spoke of a redeemer
[52:59] right but there was no
[53:03] Redemption now there was forgiveness of
[53:05] sins under the law right
[53:08] sure but not by the law
[53:13] right by the law of the scripture said
[53:15] nobody can be saved that's
[53:18] right but what about people that kept it
[53:21] all their lives and that's all they ever
[53:22] believed in and all they ever done and
[53:24] and live and all and thinking that that
[53:26] was what it
[53:30] was see now folks I keep coming back to
[53:32] this because I want this to dwell into
[53:35] your head maybe and maybe it'll someday
[53:37] drop into our soul and be become
[53:41] quickened you said Brother D I don't
[53:43] have
[53:44] anything people talk to me and they say
[53:46] I I don't I don't have anything that I
[53:48] think made me be
[53:52] saved and I'm standing there saying Lord
[53:55] why is this person telling me
[54:03] this cuz see you don't have to tell me
[54:06] that I know you don't have anything
[54:09] right you're telling me that to try to
[54:12] convince
[54:15] me that you do think you have some
[54:18] reason cuz that's
[54:22] human he said no no no no
[54:26] come
[54:29] on why don't you just be honest one time
[54:31] and
[54:34] think see we
[54:38] think that because I don't do
[54:41] something I'm a
[54:44] Christian where's that
[54:51] at where is that supposed to be what is
[54:53] that what mentality what form is it of
[54:57] us that would ever think
[55:02] that as a prophet we just read he said
[55:05] do you want
[55:08] Justice
[55:10] Mercy man I want Justice
[55:14] no no no amen I don't want Justice man I
[55:18] want Grace amen
[55:21] yeah I want
[55:24] forgiveness
[55:26] and see that's why I say that we should
[55:27] be more concerned today about our lives
[55:29] than ever
[55:31] before
[55:34] right but I'm just trying to tell you we
[55:36] as human
[55:40] beings we try in some way one way or the
[55:43] other that we think it was something
[55:45] that we done or didn't do or this that
[55:48] or the other or or something you know to
[55:50] bring us into this message

[56:00] you and I know you ain't going to like
[56:02] it so go
[56:05] ahead you know the only thing that you
[56:07] can call that would help you in any way
[56:10] to cause you to come into this
[56:14] message is because I'm standing here
[56:17] looking at three right

[56:32] bring you to the
[56:35] truth right amen you admit it amen

[56:59] while and build a house and kind of get
[57:01] going with it the little money paid down

[57:28] this other man run the other I mean he
[57:30] talked with him that's what he

[57:50] his finger cut off right side of when
[57:51] the same saw I just got through using
[57:54] cuz that was this natural
[57:57] things but I just simply asked the Lord

[58:53] guy
[58:55] and I loved it first day I went to work

[59:09] straight
[59:11] down and I had to walk out there and
[59:14] help them put that
[59:16] together I wasn't afraid of that I loved
[59:19] it
[59:21] right I used to life at me hang because
[59:23] I was a tall I could hang my L up over
[59:25] the beam and and just drive wedges
[59:27] underneath that they couldn't do I
[59:30] enjoyed it I didn't want to go back to
[59:32] joh
[59:34] M but you know for a living in the mind
[59:37] of the Lord and I didn't know he was
[59:38] going to bring me in contact with other
[59:41] people I was already in the message I
[59:43] already comeing we already had the
[59:44] church
[59:49] here but you see it ain't something good
[59:52] that we've done right it's amazing what
[59:56] he's done amen that's right to bring us
[59:59] to himself amen
[1:00:01] amen that's right how did you hear of
[1:00:03] the message that's what that was what I
[1:00:04] enjoyed I
[1:00:06] really I just I'd love to go back and
[1:00:09] listen to that tape again where we had
[1:00:10] that watch Night Service at
[1:00:12] time and everybody here gave a testimony
[1:00:15] amen children and all singing and
[1:00:18] reading scriptures and giving a
[1:00:20] testimony and we started at 8:30 got to
[1:00:22] it I started at 8:00 got to at 1:30
[1:00:25] that's right yeah you see I heard your
[1:00:29] testimonies of how you come to the
[1:00:33] Lord you know it was God seeking after
[1:00:36] us amen right amen it's never been that
[1:00:40] we were seeking after him that's right
[1:00:43] he said well I quit this and I quit that
[1:00:45] and I quit the Bible says the goodness
[1:00:47] of God is what leads us to repentance it
[1:00:50] ain't what we we
[1:00:53] are that's right he brought us to
[1:00:56] himself
[1:00:59] man it wasn't something we done
[1:01:04] right sister G I don't mind me saying it
[1:01:06] she said she come in screaming and
[1:01:10] kicking she told Brother dick one day
[1:01:12] said don't tell me no more and I won't
[1:01:13] be
[1:01:15] responsible
[1:01:17] that's pretty good
[1:01:21] point but you see
[1:01:25] he saved us
[1:01:27] amen Lord above
[1:01:30] ourselves that's right it wasn't how
[1:01:33] good we was but it wasn't how bad we was
[1:01:36] right but I do like the last part you
[1:01:38] know that the the like three pools and
[1:01:42] things and then the LI was to go out in
[1:01:43] the highways and hedges and compel them
[1:01:45] to come in that's right get the bad and
[1:01:48] everything else then just compel them to
[1:01:50] come in that's what I consider all of us
[1:01:52] to be
[1:01:53] right
[1:01:55] not how good we are but how much we can
[1:01:57] depend upon him that's right amen and
[1:02:00] believe it amen that's on my heart and
[1:02:02] I'm sorry amen look at the next one
[1:02:05] Perfection 1957
[1:02:08] 4:19 if there is anything that I can do
[1:02:11] to make myself perfect in the presence
[1:02:13] of God then Christ did not have to die
[1:02:17] for me if there's one thing that you can
[1:02:20] do that would Merit anything in the
[1:02:22] presence of God then Christ died in vain
[1:02:26] no lawke keeping no legalistic ideas of
[1:02:29] your own none of your own Holiness Y and
[1:02:33] listen no things that you could quit
[1:02:36] doing quit lying quit stealing quit
[1:02:40] smoking toaca quit going to the picture
[1:02:43] shows still you're lost nothing can do
[1:02:46] it joining churches rituals ceremonies
[1:02:49] baptisms orders of the church reading of
[1:02:52] Creeds sing of prayers all those things
[1:02:56] would count nothing you are lost not one
[1:02:59] thing can you do in yourself for you are
[1:03:02] a sinner under condemnation and there's
[1:03:05] not no way within yourself or any Creed
[1:03:08] or anything that you could do or think
[1:03:11] of of yourself that would could Merit
[1:03:14] one thing in the presence of God because
[1:03:16] you're a sinner to start with yes amen
[1:03:20] what about it right but you know what
[1:03:26] you can read all day
[1:03:30] long if God don't reveal it you know
[1:03:33] where we're at right where we was we
[1:03:36] started still got some thought in our
[1:03:39] mind of some reason my mother was a good
[1:03:42] person my daddy was this my my uncle was
[1:03:45] that my you know he was a preacher or
[1:03:49] something you talk to people and they'll
[1:03:51] always have some connection mhm and
[1:03:55] that's
[1:03:56] wonderful that's life you know and that
[1:04:00] is like I said I worked at J
[1:04:04] Motors and introduced him to you to the
[1:04:07] message I working there I'm glad of that
[1:04:12] but that didn't save you and it didn't
[1:04:15] save me no
[1:04:18] right I Don't Preach because that I'm
[1:04:21] I'm afraid to being
[1:04:23] lost
[1:04:25] you want to quote brother R but you
[1:04:28] better quote him good on this he said if
[1:04:30] I sat down go out here and sit down and
[1:04:33] Don't Preach another
[1:04:36] sermon he said I'm Sav anyway amen
[1:04:39] that's
[1:04:41] right true he said I preach because I
[1:04:43] love him amen that's
[1:04:47] right I Don't Preach because of of money
[1:04:51] don't need
[1:04:52] it they bother me
[1:04:58] I preach because I love you amen yes sir
[1:05:01] I love my family that's right and most
[1:05:04] of you are my family and you know what
[1:05:06] I'm talking about that because most of
[1:05:08] you I spanked you a little bit when you
[1:05:09] was
[1:05:13] little remember Joy running around the
[1:05:16] little skinny things she never has got
[1:05:17] out of
[1:05:19] that kids but you know what they're just
[1:05:23] part of her family man that's right
[1:05:25] that's right right
[1:05:27] amen see I preach because I I want you
[1:05:30] to know what's within my heart amen not
[1:05:33] because I'm
[1:05:36] saved it's because I want you saved amen
[1:05:40] that's right I want to see you in glory
[1:05:43] that's right doesn't matter if I miss it
[1:05:45] that don't have nothing to do with it
[1:05:46] you say oh you're not that way okay
[1:05:48] that's
[1:05:50] fine look what he says on the mighty
[1:05:53] conqueror 1950 8
[1:05:56] 329 have you my bewildered friends have
[1:06:00] you never tasted the Lord's goodness to
[1:06:03] you do you not know that it's nothing
[1:06:07] you can do in
[1:06:08] yourself if salvation come by
[1:06:12] works then Jesus died in vain that's
[1:06:20] right he died in
[1:06:22] vain serpent 1958
[1:06:26] 9:28 brother if there's one thing that I
[1:06:29] have to do Jesus Christ died in vain
[1:06:31] Grace I am saved and that by not by
[1:06:35] myself but by the will of God and by the
[1:06:38] goodness and mercy right wasn't so from
[1:06:41] the beginning 1963
[1:06:44] 306 now some of them say if we keep the
[1:06:48] Commandments that's all we have to do if
[1:06:51] keeping Commandments was all that God
[1:06:54] required Jesus died in vain the Holy
[1:06:56] Spirit didn't have to come because they
[1:06:58] had the Commandments before the Holy
[1:07:00] Spirit came but it takes the Holy Spirit
[1:07:03] to keep the Commandments right right
[1:07:06] right you get it you have to have it ins
[1:07:09] sign 62
[1:07:11] 1119 if you tried to achieve say brother
[1:07:14] Brandon now just a moment I keep the
[1:07:17] Golden Rule now the golden rule is Ten
[1:07:19] Commandments
[1:07:20] okay brother if that would have stood
[1:07:24] Jesus would not have would have not had
[1:07:28] to die say brother Brown I become a
[1:07:30] member of a very prominent church that's
[1:07:33] all right my brother I appreciate that
[1:07:35] and I appreciate you keeping the Golden
[1:07:37] Rule I appreciate you keeping the Ten
[1:07:39] Commandments but if the Golden Rule a
[1:07:42] church joining or any the any of those
[1:07:46] things would have saved you Jesus died
[1:07:49] in vain Jesus himself said himself in St
[1:07:53] John the third chapter except a man be
[1:07:55] born again he will in no wise in her
[1:07:58] hand do you see what I'm talking
[1:08:01] about he took my
[1:08:07] place that I can take his place right
[1:08:11] amen I have a lot more about it but if
[1:08:14] you don't understand what I'm talking
[1:08:15] about let me say it one more
[1:08:17] time if God don't reveal it to us right
[1:08:21] we are still legalist m
[1:08:25] and even a born again
[1:08:30] Christian has to be very careful because
[1:08:34] we can be very
[1:08:37] legalistic we look at what people do or
[1:08:40] don't
[1:08:42] do well they well I agree we they not
[1:08:46] and we are not too
[1:08:48] right but just remember one little thing
[1:08:51] that's always helped
[1:08:52] me
[1:08:54] I always thought we believed in a God
[1:08:56] that looked down at Mankind and didn't
[1:08:59] see you
[1:09:01] know one person doing a whole lot of sin
[1:09:04] yeah and the other person doing just a
[1:09:06] little bit of sin and he said I like
[1:09:08] that
[1:09:09] fell I thought he saw everybody as
[1:09:12] Sinners amen that's right condemned
[1:09:16] that's right and he had to pay the
[1:09:20] price I thought he looked at all of us
[1:09:22] as the same
[1:09:25] that's why brother Dale can look at it
[1:09:26] like
[1:09:27] that and not look at something you do or
[1:09:30] don't do but look at the end of the
[1:09:33] road I told
[1:09:36] you and brother dawn again years ago one
[1:09:40] away I told my wife I said you'll come
[1:09:47] back I believed it you know what he did
[1:09:51] that's
[1:09:52] right
[1:09:55] but you
[1:09:57] see you say well there's no hopes for a
[1:10:00] person that does this or
[1:10:03] that there's only one sin that there's
[1:10:05] no hopes for right and that's
[1:10:07] blaspheming the Holy
[1:10:09] Ghost and that is to attribute the works
[1:10:11] of God to the devil is what your Prophet
[1:10:13] said right marriage and divorce is not
[1:10:15] Blasphemous
[1:10:18] right there's no difference in one sin
[1:10:20] and another sin that's right there's no
[1:10:23] big sin little sin nothing like that in
[1:10:26] God he doesn't look at it that way he
[1:10:29] looks at all of us the
[1:10:33] same he loved a Rich Young Ruler because
[1:10:36] he knew he kept the law right yeah but
[1:10:39] he didn't give him eternal life right
[1:10:41] there right cuz he's the one that wound
[1:10:43] up remember over in hell
[1:10:48] right so he never did receive it
[1:10:52] right what do you think is the reason
[1:10:55] that God saved
[1:11:02] you
[1:11:04] amen you see I wasn't going this way I
[1:11:06] was going to go in
[1:11:07] representation brother Brown said he
[1:11:09] don't see me he only sees my
[1:11:11] representation that's
[1:11:15] right he only sees me through the blood
[1:11:20] yes thank God for the blood amen amen
[1:11:24] like some of us were talking the other
[1:11:26] day about it you know sister said when
[1:11:28] we leave out of here the blood's
[1:11:30] gone absolutely because it's going with
[1:11:34] us only things left is for the Jews and
[1:11:38] and things you know that'll be under the
[1:11:39] blood
[1:11:40] yeah but he only sees our representation
[1:11:44] that's
[1:11:48] right
[1:11:50] now seriously let me ask you a question
[1:11:53] this a simple simple
[1:11:56] question and let me make a simple
[1:12:00] statement do you know that as far as
[1:12:02] life and doing and our righteousness and
[1:12:05] our
[1:12:06] doings we'd have been better off if
[1:12:08] Jesus Christ had never
[1:12:12] died now you going to go Haywire there
[1:12:15] right you're trying to figure out what
[1:12:17] I'm talking about I'm just telling it
[1:12:20] like it
[1:12:22] is if he had never come and died in our
[1:12:25] place we could have been our good works
[1:12:28] and our good things and we could have
[1:12:30] paved the parking lot and put new pews
[1:12:32] in and painted the church and worked all
[1:12:34] around right y put Swain sets out in the
[1:12:38] thing we could we could really just be
[1:12:41] going
[1:12:45] good but when he came
[1:12:48] see that's what I've been reading in
[1:12:50] Matthew so we'll get out of that and go
[1:12:52] on
[1:12:55] Jesus Took the Beatitudes to say blessed
[1:12:57] are you blessed blessed blessed then he
[1:12:59] turned around and said now listen and I
[1:13:01] want you to just think about what I
[1:13:03] wrote cuz this is what I wrote in my
[1:13:05] Bible a long time
[1:13:09] ago and you'll see what I've been
[1:13:11] driving
[1:13:12] at you notice I'll stop every once in a
[1:13:15] while and express something from
[1:13:17] Matthew now say that what Jesus was
[1:13:20] laying down what a new thing was going
[1:13:22] to be it was going to be a new king om
[1:13:23] it was going to be different thing cuz
[1:13:25] he already talked about how blessed they
[1:13:27] were right then he starts telling them
[1:13:29] said now you heard it said I for n a two
[1:13:32] for two that was the law yeah that was
[1:13:34] exactly the letter of the law that's
[1:13:36] right but he said I
[1:13:40] say love your
[1:13:43] enemies he was showing what God would do
[1:13:46] and I wrote it in my Bible right
[1:13:52] here God
[1:13:55] God does it this
[1:14:00] way God does it this way what he loves
[1:14:04] his
[1:14:05] enemy loves his
[1:14:08] neighbors He blesses them that curses
[1:14:11] him he does good to them that hates him
[1:14:14] he prays for them that despitefully use
[1:14:20] him and he's perfect
[1:14:29] and he's perfect
[1:14:33] amen but how do we
[1:14:38] do if
[1:14:42] we love our
[1:14:46] neighbor love our enemy pray for them
[1:14:50] that despitefully
[1:14:52] uses
[1:14:54] that don't mean we're
[1:14:55] saved right it means we've had a change
[1:14:58] of heart
[1:14:59] right we think under the New Testament
[1:15:02] that that it's that's why everybody
[1:15:04] thinks that we're in the New Testament
[1:15:05] why I said that about the law the law
[1:15:07] still in existence until you're born
[1:15:08] again because the Bible says Christ is
[1:15:10] the end of the law for
[1:15:14] righteousness if Christ is not in our
[1:15:16] hearts and lives living in a new birth
[1:15:19] we're still lost amen right and we're
[1:15:21] still under the condemnation of all
[1:15:24] right so if we train ourselves to be
[1:15:32] good you know what good is it right
[1:15:36] that's a good
[1:15:41] neighbor I wrote that in my Bible when I
[1:15:43] started this
[1:15:45] series to make sure to explain that when
[1:15:48] it would come
[1:15:50] time you and I could be all so goody
[1:15:53] goody and never have a thing
[1:15:56] wrong and still be lost
[1:16:01] righten but if we have the new
[1:16:05] birth we've accepted the atonement and
[1:16:09] let him pay the
[1:16:13] price we can be as he said the children
[1:16:16] of God
[1:16:22] right we may the children of
[1:16:25] God and can never be lost right
[1:16:30] amen right because we have eternal life
[1:16:35] that's right
[1:16:36] amen so if the keeping if we're doing
[1:16:40] what we're doing because of a of a a
[1:16:43] fact that we've been trained to do
[1:16:46] that that's not salvation right
[1:16:51] man but if it's just flowing from our
[1:16:54] heart that that's what we want right and
[1:16:57] that's what we
[1:17:00] are it shows our
[1:17:03] Salvation that's right our
[1:17:06] works displays our faith right
[1:17:10] right you say well you trying no I'm not
[1:17:13] trying to get us to be good that's what
[1:17:14] I've told you that people don't
[1:17:15] understand me when I preach I don't want
[1:17:17] you to be good right right you said you
[1:17:20] don't want us to be good no I don't want
[1:17:22] you be
[1:17:24] good everybody Mis understand that I
[1:17:27] want you to be
[1:17:30] saved if you're
[1:17:33] saved then it won't be you being good it
[1:17:36] be Christ in you the hope of
[1:17:39] glory that's right why did Paul say that
[1:17:43] I struck it a little bit down at brother
[1:17:45] col why did Paul say it's Christ in you
[1:17:48] the hope of glory
[1:17:52] right
[1:17:53] we use the word hope is well I hope I'm
[1:17:55] saved I believe I'm Sav maybe I hope I
[1:17:58] am was that what Paul was talking about
[1:18:05] no Paul was saying it's Christ in
[1:18:08] you the hope of coming to a glorified
[1:18:13] State that's right the new birth brings
[1:18:16] a hope this body can be redeemed that's
[1:18:19] right
[1:18:20] right but you know what don't
[1:18:22] automatically do do it right then right
[1:18:24] takes time right right so Paul's right
[1:18:27] it's Christ in you the
[1:18:31] hope Christ comes into our heart it
[1:18:33] makes a hope Paul had a
[1:18:37] hope he prophesied or would change the
[1:18:39] moment twinkle of the night we had to
[1:18:41] die hoping somebody would catch what he
[1:18:45] said
[1:18:47] right but then he didn't die with doubt
[1:18:50] believing nobody
[1:18:51] would cuz he knew if there's going to be
[1:18:54] a change of moment between the life
[1:18:55] somebody's going to get it so his Hope
[1:18:57] was not hope somebody gets it his Hope
[1:19:00] was an anchor of the Soul he said
[1:19:03] right why can't we find the middle of
[1:19:05] the road
[1:19:07] church and quit looking at everybody and
[1:19:10] condemning everybody because of what
[1:19:11] they do or don't
[1:19:15] do if God ever let you do one thing you
[1:19:18] quit
[1:19:19] that I stood one day and looked at
[1:19:21] somebody
[1:19:24] and I was condemning him to
[1:19:27] death and all it was it was like a set
[1:19:29] of
[1:19:31] monoculars like a single Vision come
[1:19:34] down and I went right back into my
[1:19:38] mind and I looked out at that
[1:19:42] person and I saw what they were wanting
[1:19:45] to
[1:19:50] do sure they was doing wrong but I saw
[1:19:52] on what they were wanting to
[1:19:55] do don't ask me to explain I can't it's
[1:19:58] just it's just I was looking like that I
[1:20:00] just went back and there was just one
[1:20:02] vision and it just changed my thinking
[1:20:05] totally about
[1:20:08] people I don't look down at what you're
[1:20:10] doing I look at your desire thank
[1:20:13] you I'm sure we all got sense enough to
[1:20:16] know if we keep on doing living like the
[1:20:18] devil we ain't nothing but the devil
[1:20:21] right but also know that it takes time
[1:20:24] sometimes
[1:20:25] right you know what I've always
[1:20:28] said a lot of people say brother Dale I
[1:20:31] saw that the first time you said
[1:20:33] it and I think sure it take me 6 months
[1:20:37] to explain it to
[1:20:40] him but see we get to the point when we
[1:20:43] come in we come we become so righteous
[1:20:45] we think we see it
[1:20:48] no right we're still seeing it amen
[1:20:51] right that's right right yes sir what
[1:20:53] does it take to be
[1:20:55] perfect nobody can be perfect I'll agree
[1:20:58] with you but in God's eyes a prophet of
[1:21:01] God said it let me say it with him that
[1:21:03] ever born again believer is perfectly
[1:21:06] totally sinless before God because
[1:21:08] they're not trusting in their own merits
[1:21:10] of any form but they're trusting in the
[1:21:12] blood of Jesus Christ that's right
[1:21:16] right is there any
[1:21:21] hope
[1:21:24] that's what job said is the whole
[1:21:27] Lord I would that
[1:21:30] somebody could come and take God's hands
[1:21:33] in other words say what like a prophet
[1:21:35] said about reach up and get God and
[1:21:38] reach the hand of man and be able to
[1:21:39] pull them together that's right that's
[1:21:42] right then one day it struck him and he
[1:21:44] said I know my redemer living I found
[1:21:48] somebody that can stand between yep
[1:21:50] that's right he saw Jesus Christ that
[1:21:53] would come
[1:21:55] sure that's why I don't look down on
[1:21:59] people and I'll just tell you something
[1:22:01] you'll find out one of these days you're
[1:22:03] looking down on somebody you better
[1:22:05] believe there's somebody looking down on
[1:22:07] you that's
[1:22:09] right and brother Perry green made this
[1:22:11] statement so I can state it he said
[1:22:13] brother randam said brother
[1:22:15] Perry he said from where I stand to
[1:22:17] where you're standing he said all you do
[1:22:19] is
[1:22:21] sin
[1:22:23] he said but where I stand where God
[1:22:25] stands everything I do is
[1:22:33] sin because that's way we're all think
[1:22:36] about we're all think about our
[1:22:42] soul and think about our Salvation
[1:22:45] right my salvation is dependent upon
[1:22:48] whether or not Jesus Christ was accepted
[1:22:50] I've got one in here that says that it's
[1:22:52] not what whether or not you VI or
[1:22:55] accepted it's whether or not he was
[1:22:57] accepted
[1:22:59] right yeah we said what I got you know
[1:23:02] it's whether or not he was accepted if
[1:23:05] he wasn't accepted then there ain't no
[1:23:07] need of you and I trying to be accepted
[1:23:09] right amen but we know he was amen yes
[1:23:13] sir he took my place right therefore I'm
[1:23:17] accepted in
[1:23:19] him my whole Perfection lays in Jesus
[1:23:24] Christ and he's the revealed
[1:23:27] word has it been revealed to
[1:23:32] you what it means to be
[1:23:38] perfect are you still thinking well is
[1:23:40] none of us perfect well I agree we we
[1:23:42] all all know that there's don't need to
[1:23:43] talk about that we all know that you
[1:23:46] know well there none of us perfect what
[1:23:48] are you talking about we all know
[1:23:51] that
[1:23:54] ain't never been one perfect person that
[1:23:55] was Jesus
[1:24:03] Christ but have you accepted the
[1:24:05] atonement
[1:24:09] right what about it
[1:24:11] that's do you believe he paid the price
[1:24:15] right tell them children that they need
[1:24:18] Christ in their heart by the new birth
[1:24:21] right tell them sure we need to live
[1:24:24] good and act good and be good cuz that's
[1:24:28] good but don't tell them that or save
[1:24:31] them that's right tell them they need
[1:24:33] Jesus Christ into their hearts to save
[1:24:36] them right amen if Jesus Christ comes
[1:24:39] into our hearts he'll live in our heart
[1:24:41] the way he lived in his
[1:24:43] body but did he go around condemning
[1:24:48] everybody little woman there you know
[1:24:51] down in a door adultery he said neither
[1:24:53] did I condemn them that's
[1:24:59] right what about it Church let's
[1:25:04] stand just totally change the message so
[1:25:06] I just preach whatever he gives me
[1:25:09] sorry I want to preach on representation
[1:25:12] but if you don't
[1:25:14] see that he represented you and I am he
[1:25:18] took my
[1:25:20] place that I could take his place
[1:25:25] let's just be what we're supposed to
[1:25:28] be try not to be anything great just be
[1:25:31] what we are that's
[1:25:33] right Sinners saved by
[1:25:39] grace like I told was it here or did I
[1:25:41] tell it down at brother Collins is about
[1:25:43] the the time that the man up at brother
[1:25:47] uh bisco's
[1:25:51] Church drove down the street most of you
[1:25:54] heard
[1:25:56] this I saw a lady walking down the
[1:25:58] street and he knew what she was she was
[1:26:00] a
[1:26:02] prostitute the man stopped and roll down
[1:26:04] the window and said how much for your
[1:26:07] time she told him he said get in the
[1:26:11] car he got in the car and pulled over
[1:26:14] and
[1:26:16] parked he said
[1:26:18] lady he said I don't want your body
[1:26:24] he said I want your soul that's right
[1:26:26] they' like to scared her to death
[1:26:28] imagine
[1:26:31] so he's talked to her about and said God
[1:26:35] told me to stop and talk to
[1:26:39] you she had been thinking about God in
[1:26:42] her life and her ways
[1:26:46] Y and she accepted Jesus
[1:26:49] Christ and got away from her life MH how
[1:26:53] many of us would even think about doing
[1:26:59] that see when brother Brandon was riding
[1:27:01] down the road one day and saw this young
[1:27:02] girl walking down through there cowboy
[1:27:04] boots on shorts and whatever you
[1:27:07] know he said I need to stop and talk to
[1:27:09] her about the
[1:27:11] Lord he said the voice said you stop and
[1:27:14] talk to her you'll be in
[1:27:21] jail one was the Lord being led the
[1:27:23] other was a prophet telling you exactly
[1:27:27] right that voice must have been God
[1:27:30] because he sure listened to
[1:27:33] it but you see who would ever thought
[1:27:36] about paying for the time of a
[1:27:38] prostitute to talk to her about her
[1:27:42] song bless God I'm too
[1:27:45] righteous I'm too
[1:27:48] holy
[1:27:50] yeah just just remember somebody's
[1:27:53] looking down on
