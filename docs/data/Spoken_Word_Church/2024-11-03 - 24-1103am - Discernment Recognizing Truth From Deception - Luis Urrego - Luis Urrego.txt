========================================

not exactly what I wanted but it's you guys see it so we're trying to work it to where presenter view so where I can see certain notes on my end but you're just seeing the slides and and can't seem to get that working so but anyways um well I want to talk this morning about uh discernment and I want to uh recognizing truth from deception how many believe that we live in an age where you need to have discernment I mean you need to have discernment uh uh definitely spiritually politically you need to have discernment in every area of your life financially uh it's an age uh you know it's an age of deception and and and it so much of an age of deception that Jesus said that it could deceive the very elected if it was possible that's how close things are so if it's like that in the spiritual then how much more in the in the natural right and so that's what kind of what we want to talk about this morning so let's just bow our heads real quick Lord Jesus we appreciate Lord God your your word father and thank you Lord God for the opportunity that you give us Lord to to look at your word and to and to speak about it Lord and I pray that you'd bless us through your word Lord God and we just Commit This Time into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen so in Hebrews 5:14 it says but strong meat belongeth to them that are full age I know you can't see that there but I'm just reading it to you even those who by reason of use have their senses exercised to discern both good and evil and I think it's very very important in the hour that we live in that we just not take everything for face value right you can't do that you really can't do that you have to be Discerning and sometimes people might think well your your cup is always half uh either half full or or what what is it half empty some people are made different some people look at people or and their intentions in a different way uh maybe some uh I think we should always give people the benefit of Doubt however in the age that we're living in it's just so deceiving that you can't really do that especially not online so you can't do that with people online so uh and so that's that's that's what we sort of want to tie it in and in 1 John 4:1 it says beloved believe not every Spirit but try the spirits whether they are of God because many false prophets are gone out into the the world Amen so the importance uh to discern uh which discernment is one of the spir non-spiritual gifts and uh I believe that God gives us all a level of discernment naturally physically but there are levels of discernment where you where they're they're higher than others just because it's a gift that's that's given to you so uh it's it is a spiritual gift so the importance of of to discern what is true from false cannot be overstated because look how John John says it here beloved he's not talking to the world he's not talking to to people who don't go to church he's talking to Christians he said beloved believe not every Spirit believe not every Spirit but try the spirits amen it it it's a it's a commandment to all Christian Believers try to try every Spirit you have to be Discerning of every spirit that comes uh whether it's behind the pulpit or whether it's in your physical life amen what is it that the people or this person is trying to bring out to me you need to discern amen and that's why it's so important for us to to to get in the word and to be in the word and to know what the word says so that you can discern what the brother behind the pulpit is saying right or what the person you know is that that you're talking to is is is trying to tell you because there are people that are out there to push their own agendas uh and and they they have ways to do it uh that they can get in your head so good that it that you everything that you learned all your life that you've been in the message you'll be out there following that just like that because it sounds so good and that's the exact reason why you know Eve was deceived because whatever the the the the Satan was trying to bring or the or the or the uh serpent was trying to bring to her he got to her head he made sure that he knew that she knew that he was an a a reliable source right and so so that's why she was deceived and it takes time you know discernment or or or people that deceive usually the good ones are the ones who actually wait and they take their time they take their time with you those are the good ones the ones that try to just come at you and and and ask you for money can I have some money those are probably you most of us can can probably not you know we we can look at those and really discern those but it's the ones that actually work with you and take time those are the ones and that's how Satan Works Satan is not a fool he takes time to work with people because he knows that eventually he'll he'll be able to get get them now so how how do we start Discerning properly in 1 Peter 5 says says this be sober be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a royal lion walketh about seeking who he may devour now this is what we have to do how to start Discerning properly first you be sober amen and sober is I had the definition here in in the notes but it it's it's knowing or being awake being being alert you know when you say hey he's sober she's sober that means they're not drunk right that means they're not under the influence of something else but you are under the influence of the word amen be sober right be alert be alert be vigilant that's the next thing to do that's that's what that that which kind of means the same thing you know be vigilant always looking out it always reminds me of the of the of the people in the in the towers you know when they were look out the Lookouts you know they're always Vigilant why because they're making sure that the enemy amen doesn't get too close to them or they can see them way before the actual the enemy gets near the towers right and so you don't want to wait until the enemy amen comes right there to you at your Tower he might not be in the gates yet of the of the Kingdom but if he just gets right there to the Watchtower he's gotten too close right and so the Watchtower has to make sure that he sees the the the enemy coming in from way far so that's what vigilance means you have to always be vigilant in in in in the day that we're living in right and then you have to know your enemy look what look what Peter says here because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walketh about seeking who he may devour now I was looking at this very interesting the way Peter mentions says it here because he says your adversary the devil as a roaring lion and you think you would think that a roaring lion um a lion he's very crafty he's very cunning and he and he's very sneaky when he's trying to get his prey however he is he does get his prey that way but you have to also realize that when a lion roars and if he's roaring in front of his in front of his prey that Roar paralyzes them because he get he lets them know that he has dominance over over that prey and therefore it's easier for them to snatch to for for him to snatch his prey so that is what That's what Satan does he exercises his power in that way because he constantly bombards you with all kinds of things in your head all kinds of things out here physically constantly bombarding he's constantly roaring and if you are not careful amen you will be paralyzed by the culture of the day and you will be deceived and and gotten gotten taken for everything that comes that comes at you so so that's what that's what Satan does he is a roaring line walketh about seeking who he may devour and the Bible says and it continues to say whom resist steadfast in the faith and no KN that the same afflictions are accomplished in your brethren that are in the I have it I guess I missed in the world I think is what it says all right now sometimes it's hard to pinpoint who the enemy Isen it's easy if we see a a a a devil out there with horns and and and and slobber coming down his face and and it's very easy you you know anybody can say that that's a deceiver right there but the deceiver comes in a way that you don't know that he's a deceiver right amen so just uh you know I work in the in the internet on the internet I'm always on the internet there's several Brothers here that we work together and we're always amen one of the main things that we that we that we have to look at is Security in in the workplace uh online and um and it's being stressed even further further in the last couple of years more than any other time so what they do is they'll send out they'll send out like uh campaigns of emails to all of the employees and it pretends like it's coming from the from the boss the email is coming from the boss and it has some sort of link you know hey the boss is trying to he's trying to share this file with you you know make uh look at it make sure you know because it's it's a deadline that you need to meet or whatever and you look at it and it looks so so like so real I mean the the the the campaigns that they keep giving us more and more they look more and more real Richard you probably get them and so and some of us we've fallen for for some of those we'll click on the link and if if you if you click on it then you have to take a little course you know you you have to and it's for you and that's your punishment right that's your punishment because you clicked on the link right all right it it might say your boss's name but if you don't recall that at all hey what file are you talking about what the best thing to do you they teach you look at the email address right look and see where it's coming from look at look at certain aspects of the email right they're training you right they're training you and then the next best thing to do is actually email your boss or call him say hey did you just send me something no I didn't okay then this is a test and I can just delete this right but hey it it is so close that it has even deceived I've had to do the little training two times already in the past five years and I'm on the internet all the time and and so that's how that's how deceiving it is but they do it they do it because they're training us now that's that's what the Lord is trying to do to us when we have to make sure hey the word says this here the word says this here let how do we connect this but then this brother behind the pulpit is saying this right now you all have been here you know Nanny you've been here for a long time and you know that we've been trained well in the word here right but still you know in the hour that we liveing because you can't let that you can't say well I I I go to Lula and I'm well trained and and and and I can't fall for anything yes you can right yes you can because they are there are deceivers out here that that are trying to deceive you spiritually and they'll do and say whatever they they they they can because it sounds right it sounds good but you have to be Discerning of what what's being said and compareed to the word compareed to the message right right because the that the word is our absolute so fishing fishing is is one of the things that are out there and it's what scammers when they send fake messages that appear to be from trusted sources to trick you into revealing personal information like your social security or credit credit card number and uh it's very very uh a very uh um it works for them that's why they keep doing it you know when you receive those messages on Whatsapp from somebody overseas and stuff like that and you have not even met the person I I get them all the time I get them and I Hey Brother come we need your ministry over here what I don't know you you're talking to me like we've already met and and and and and I don't know you some of the most sometimes those things lead to hey well U you might not be able to come but uh can you go ahead and send us an offering for uh such and such most of the time I just ignore those those messages and I'm sorry if they're True Believers or not but honestly I can't you cannot waste your time and and you really you really just have to be Discerning because I'm sure that they have some sort of help over there they got a pastor if they go to your pastor talk to your pastor you know you don't know me and I don't know you so so so I'll pray for you I tell I'll pray for you and that's it but but you just have to be Discerning and you can't fall for anything and everything that everybody says just under the name of the message or just because they have a cloud picture on their profile picture or or something like that you can't do that and that might sound bad that might sound well you don't have feelings but I'm sorry I I got assets that I need to protect I have a family that I need to protect I got to protect the church I got to protect my testimony I got to I got to protect all those things you see and I don't know you from from the person you know out here any other person out here in Street even though you say you believe the message you know let me meet you first right right and then maybe we can talk but all right so the best scams seem the most harmless right Genesis 3 1-6 we read when we were talking about this this uh past Wednesday about the voices right the serpent he took his time to get into Eve's head you know I remember brother Dell you know he he he said it could have been it could have been years where he got he worked with Eve right and it would have been maybe five minute chats here and there you know just get Eve to the side a little bit away from Adam you know and just get into her head and eventually amen he leared her to think that she needed what he was offering all right and that is what a good scam is it makes you think that you need what is being offered that you need it and then if you don't get it right now and if you don't if you there's no time to wait you have you have to get it right now that there's not they put that time element in there you're going to miss it you're going to miss it a good I mean if you don't get it right now at this price I mean tomorrow it's going to go go up I'm telling you you're going to and you and you realize next day it's the same price you right but the coupon says I mean it the popup window came came up to you when you went to walmart.com get it now you know well and it's all just the tactics it's psychological really selling and and and and scamming somebody is really psychological more than anything else they know how to get into people's head and so the same thing is with a a good a a preacher maybe he doesn't necessarily want to deceive but in order to get people to view to look at his Viewpoint he has to use psychological things in order to do it right he'll use the word because Satan always comes with the word right 99% word but then he'll use that little 1% psychology in there that really gets you my praise God hallelujah you know you start you know and then you see all the doctrines that have come up you know since the 80s 90s everybody's jumping and shouting and screaming and stuff for that man you know and that man you know he's you know he's very yeah you know and and people fall into that trance under the name of the message under the name of the message that's right so so the best scam seem the most harmless you know uh I remember one time my wife can remember this we were in Atlanta and uh we were just walking my wife and me and uh a man comes up to us and says hey could I have some food uh could I have some money could I have some money for food and I said well I don't have any money with me and I don't remember if I did have cash with me or not but I said but I'll be I'll be more than glad to buy you some some food said okay I'll do that for anybody that asks now we'll look at here something for if you want food I'll buy you a food if you need gas I'll buy you a little bit of gas normally I don't have cash with me so I I don't give people normally cash I have in the past but but but I limit my my my my amount however I went in the subway down there in downtown Atlanta went in there I said go get get you what you know get you something and I was just thinking he was just going to get a 6 inch sub you know something you know tuna you know something like that he he starts ordering a foot long put this on there put I mean he was he was ordering everything from from the from the from the line from uh he was ear the chips and and everything and and I just I just all I kept thinking was you know Lord you said in your word he that asks give give freely it's what you said in your word so maybe he needs this and he probably went and sold half of it to somebody else one of his one of his friends but that's up to him I gave him food right that that's between him and God what he did with the food then right you're only commanded Amen to to do what Jesus said in the word you know I have a friend one time in Greenville he he he went to a Burger King parking lot and he he the guy was asking for food and he said I'll come in here and buy you a burger he said no I don't want that one that's too greasy Beggars can't be choosers that means he really really want the food he wanted to see if he could get something else so you um but but you know that that's that's that's that's how it is um there was a verse here that that I wanted to look at I think it's later on but now the best scams seem the most harmless in Matthew 24:24 says for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show you great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect my these was Jesus's own words right that if it was possible this thing would would be so close that it would deceive the very elect if it was possible that's why we have to be very very Discerning amen what's going on in our day amen around the world Amen you have to be don't take things for face Valley there are men out there really trying to deceive politically spiritually amen they might just look like exactly exactly what you want to hear but you don't know what's behind that person's intentions right he might have said he he might have said hey I'm going to change this I'm going to change it and he said it in 2016 nothing happened what would make you think that he would change things now just saying exactly right just saying all right there's a woman that has a candidate right now who's saying hey I'll change this for you but she's had four years to change it why won't they change it now right just looking at it politically okay be Discerning right because these people have alliances with with with with other countries with other other uh uh entities and they are looking to fill their pockets that's one thing but they also have agendas to push right so be Discerning they're saying that this this this this uh election season I'm not trying to be political but what I'm saying is this election SE it could be the last one that we'll ever see even Trump said that I don't know why he said it but who knows what they got what they got in store and Christians are falling for it head over heill like he's the Messiah like like like you just they talk about the golden age that he's a m the you know and and so you just be careful be careful be Discerning be very very I'm not trying to tell you who to vote for or not to vote for but this is coming up on Tuesday right but you be Discerning right if if you if you think voting makes a difference that's fine be Discerning right be discerning just that that's all I'm going to say just be Discerning um because uh look into the man that's all I'm going to say look into his background so uh just as fishing attempts look genuine to lure victims spiritual deceptions often seem attractive and plausible spiritual deceptions they seem yeah they make sense yeah what they're saying in in the middle of the rah you don't think because everybody is wow everybody is RA that means it must be right but that's that's not how it goes that's not how it is right you know you have to know the word for yourself you have to know the the situation for yourself the cost of fallen for deception second Corin I'm going Tove little quickly 2 Corinthians 11:3 says but I fear lest by any means as the serpent begal Eve through his subtility so your minds should be corrupted from the Simplicity that is in in Christ why why did why does uh Paul say your minds because when Eve when the serpent came to Eve he didn't force her to do what what he did he got into her mind first right right that's that's a good deceiver is going to get into your mind first he's not going to force you he's going to talk to you he's going to he's going to make sure he works with you he's going to massage that that he's trying to you know as much as he can so that you feel so relaxed this can't possibly be bad oh and then he'll get you right after see just like physical or internet scams like the serpent half truths to Eve they lure with false promises and can lead to Serious consequences and then you're wondering what in the world just happened they massaged you you got massaged by the devil all right now this is what I was talking about Jesus said give that's up to you if you want to obey what Jesus said Jesus said in Matthew 5:42 give to him that asketh thee period right and from him that would borrow of thee turn not thou away but there's a c caveat here because you don't see the person behind online you don't know the person that's trying to reach you you don't you don't know that person right so you you're you're not bound you don't need to give anybody any money that ass online you have never met this person you have never seen this person but a person that comes to you physically you see it and asks hey um can I have a dollar you know I'm they might be lying and you and they probably are but Jesus said give to him that ask thee now sometimes what I do is I I start talking to them like hey so what made you you know uh I was talking to a girl one time in in in a parking lot in Atlanta she was asking for money and uh just talking with her talking about things of the Lord that's an opportunity for you to witness right hey you want my money you want then then you you'll hear about the Lord for a little bit yeah that you sometimes we say we just use we say those you know leave them alone they're just scammers they're just but the the opportunity maybe the the Lord is doing that opportunity so that that person might need the gospel you know that's right then hey you listen to me for a little while I'll give you you know a couple of bucks whatever but what you do with it that's up that's between you and God that's right right exactly so so uh but some people like no absolutely not I will not give anybody I know what they are they're going to go smoke weed with it they're going to go that you just follow what Jesus said and let the Lord do the rest that that Jesus said give to him that asketh thee it doesn't not say that it says that all right so if if a random person ask me personally for help I give with reason within reason they they're going to ask me for $10,000 you know I'm not going to give them $110,000 right right but but but but the person you know online that's asking for that amount then you give them that amount that that's that's that's totally different you see that's that's that's foolish we wouldn't do that physically why would we do it online you see so this verse uh doesn't apply to anyone online that you don't know asking for money right you know so sometimes people ask hey can I have a little bit of guest now there's the ones out there they're they're out there with the with the cardboard you know and and say I'm I'm hard times you know I normally don't give people them because they're not asking me personally they're just out there for anybody to to and I I have my reasons you know I that hey look look there's Mexicans that come to this country and they they find jobs for you to be out there you're an American citizen you have sources resources these people for come from other countries they got work they can come and work they find jobs easily why can't you you see so that's just what I'm going to say about that I'm very strong that's my wife I just can't I the ones with the cardboards those are scammers I mean my wife but she'd tell you there was a one in a lady in Toronto that would do the same thing Toronto Canada and come to find out I mean they'll follow these people back for their sources they're driving Mercedes they got nice uh penth houses and that was the same with this lady in Toronto lady out there in the streets you know but they take turns they have shifts they do this all together it's it's a scam don't fall for it so building a strong defense is really really one of the things that we need we should start doing the putting on the full armor of God right I know we're we're dealing a lot with the physical things but but it if if you see it in the physical it ties in with the spiritual the natural ties in with the spiritual you see put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the walls of the devil you know and then I got here just as we install antivirus software uh or things to protect our computers we need the armor of God as spiritual defense right with each piece uh strengthening our discernment res and resilience against worldly influences so if if we want to protect our computers or our phones or things like that from those things how much more our souls right how much more our souls from we need to put on the whole armor of God right and so the power of knowledge and wisdom amen Hosea 4:6 says my people are destroyed for for lack of knowledge they don't get in the word right because thou has rejected knowledge I will also reject thee this is this is the Lord saying this so scams often exploit a lack of knowledge because you don't know and you don't understand you fall for it much easy so it's it it's good it behooves us for us to study right just like I'm in I'm on I'm online all the time I have to study and see what the latest scams are and what's going on out there right because I have I have assets to protect right I have things that I need to protect and so so the need for Godly wisdom and knowledge of scripture to prevent spiritual deception is a must just as Internet safety education helps us to avoid fraud amen Proverbs 4:23 says keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of Life internet scams pray on our fears desires and good willll reminding us to God our hearts by letting faith and wisdom rather than fear or urgency guide our actions amen and that's that's where the scammers like to they like to make it urgent amen and we fall pray for that so we also and I believe this is the okay being wise stewards of our resources Proverbs 3:9 says honor the Lord with thy substance and with the first fruits of all thine increase amen we we're called Amen to protect amen what God has given us right for us to just easily fall prey for anything that that that the devil brings in our lives right the the the devil is out there to try to steal kill and destroy right and he'll use whatever person whatever individual to do it right but we're called to be wise stewards of our of our money our time and our relationships amen and recognizing that our resources are gifts from God to be used while wisely so it's okay for you to say no to that WhatsApp message don't think you can I'm sorry just delete it I don't know you I I'm I'm sorry you might be a brother in Christ just delete it right delete it unless you sure you definitely know that person beyond the shadow of the doubt you know their their Pastor you know and then you maybe you can consider it but but then at that point consider with reason brother brand says this and with this deis come up many are like Eve Eve just stopped long enough to be deceived she stopped long enough to be deceived if she hadn't have stopped there had there there have never been no deceiving but Eve stopped and when she stopped there were there's where she got her deceiving instead of pressing on you stopped you stopped and listened to the devil's lie uh and and listen to what he had to say see to the devil you can't Li you can't listen to him right right you can't listen to him because he's lying he's telling he's he's he he's saying truth but at the same time mixing it with lies and you can't stop and listen to him at all so that's what Eve should have done she should have recognized she should recognized that this can't be from God because it's going against what God had already originally told us therefore it would have that knowledge would have been able to stop the incident but she didn't follow through and therefore what happened happened so God bless you all let's be Discerning especially in this coming year if we're still here let's be Discerning because uh um we have to be in this hour God bless y'all [Applause]
