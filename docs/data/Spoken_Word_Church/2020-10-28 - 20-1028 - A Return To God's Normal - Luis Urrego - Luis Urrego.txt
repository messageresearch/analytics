okay from tennessee hope they had good relaxing time like that shirt is that amen praise god so um i want to while we're standing before we go to prayer i want to ask that each and every one of you remember a family in nicaragua in prayer they just they lost their one-year-old uh little boy last uh this this afternoon and this around 11 o'clock this morning and uh they've been having issues last time when we were there the sister was pr that was their second child the sister was pregnant with the with this child and uh i never got to meet the little baby but after a few months after the baby was born there were some complications i don't know exactly all the details but they were just back and forth back and forth in the hospital with the baby for for the last i'd say last five months of this year and and so finally the baby just passed away so you just remember that family in prayer best brother his name is brother mario and sister sister scarlett amen and and their their family that sister scarlett's brother is is a brother that i that i'll travel with when i go down there to nicaragua around so doing mission work so you remember that family in prayer and also continue to remember that baby uh in the philippines that we've been uh praying about baby sean uh they were gonna send him uh home uh this week i think it was and then they they just they they said that they're not now because he was tested positive for coronavirus so i don't the the families to the point where they don't even believe the hospital now so they see it seems like it's a it's a insurance milking thing so but but that's that's terrible it's terrible for the for the parents this is their first child amen and they can't even take their child home so you just remember that family in prayer they're just been very patient and so just put yourself in their shoes so if you had a baby how would you feel if you were in there in their place same thing with the family in nicaragua amen so before we uh before we read the word let's just bow our heads and and let's ask god to intervene for these requests our heavenly father we thank you lord once again for the opportunity to come and feast upon your word lord jesus and we just ask you father god on behalf of these requests lord for these families lord father god delusion of the little baby there father and sister scarlett and brother mario there in nicaragua lord father god you know every detail of that situation father you know what the family's going through lord it's been a very rough last five six months for them lord

with that situation father god and lord uh also just help us father to receive from your word this evening lord we come not to hear a man lord but we come to hear from you lord god lord knowing our lips lord and anoint our ears father god that we may draw closer to you through your word we pray lord now that you just blessed this time in jesus christ's name amen amen praise god amen so if you turn with me to isaiah chapter 43 i'm going to do my best not to keep you long tonight i know that inclement weather is coming through and so we want to get you all home as soon as possible so uh we'll not will not take you take too much time tonight isaiah chapter 43 verse 18 the bible says remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old amen now isaiah was not talking here to not think about of course if we put the context in there he was talking to israel god obviously he was a prophet to israel but he was not telling israel don't think about the past obviously we have memories we have we have things that that experiences that we've had and and good memories and bad memories and and uh but what he's telling them is is it which is in the next verse he's telling don't get so consumed about the the things of old or the way of old because here god was about to introduce a new way amen in verse 19 it says behold i will do a new thing remember this is god speaking through isaiah now it shall spring forth shall ye know it i i will even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert the beast of the field shall honor me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people my chosen the people have i formed my this people have i formed myself they shall show forth my praise amen you may be seated this this evening i'd like to just give this a little title a return to god's normal a return to god's you know we've been hearing a lot lately especially this year about a new normal that's a new phrase that we've been hearing a new normal and we have to remember that what god what's happening in the in the natural god it's also happening in the spiritual amen praise god so i i was just looking at reading this scripture and and and just thinking how god is telling here isaiah to tell the children of israel do not remember the former things amen it was great when we the former things and the way we used to walk and the way we used to do to to live and carry on our our way neither consider the things of old in other words don't get so fixated on the way things were you know sometimes i believe that that we we get we as uh as human beings we get so nostalgic sometimes i preached the message uh well i taught a sunday school lesson a while back called spiritual i did the things that happened in the in the 40s and the 50s and the 60s and the 70s and 80s and we forget what god is doing now we forget the present god that's walking amongst us and living amongst us and speaking amongst us and thinking through us amen because we're so fixated on the things of old amen and the things of old were great they were light for that time amen but god is still walking amen just like the children of israel when they were walking in the in the wilderness amen they could not stake their their post to the tent in the in the area where they were camping at for forever and think oh that's just how this is where i'm going to be it couldn't be that way because why that pillar of fire and that cloud was moving amen and they had to move along with it and if they didn't amen they would just be stayed back and the same thing goes with us saints if you don't move with what the what god is doing now amen you're just going to stay god's a gentleman he's not going to force you to do anything but you've got to move on with him in order amen to uh to receive from him amen praise god amen so he says here he says remember remember ye not the former things neither consider the things of old behold i will do a new thing now it shall spring forth shall ye know it in other words how this is going to happen and you will know about it amen this is something that you will know it's going to be visible it's going to be tangible you will know about it and it says and i will even make a way in the wilderness amen think about that amen that god can make a way in the wilderness god can make a way in the wilderness that you're in right now amen god can make you know those for for those of you who hunt there's probably not many trails in the in the woods amen and and sometimes you got to walk in the middle of trees in the middle of you have to use tools in order for you to get out amen if you didn't have these tools you probably end up getting lost but god is able to make a way in the middle of a wilderness in the middle of your wilderness in the middle of of what problem you may be having he's able to make a way for you in this hour amen it doesn't matter what it is that's right no matter if it's sickness if it's death if it's no matter what it is god is able to make a way and he continues to tell the children of israel and rivers in the desert now you don't find too many rivers in the desert amen but god is able to make rivers in the desert amen praise god so whether you can feed on so that you can drink and be satisfied amen it's like the the woman at the well amen when she came to the to the to the real living water she thought she was receiving uh the the water from the well and that was sustaining that was sustaining her physically but there was a man there that could sustain her spiritually amen that could give her the living water and that's what she was looking for that's what she needed and that's why jesus gave her amen praise god and she came running back and she told the the the the the city she didn't tell them about anything else she didn't go talk about her uh her dress or or her hair or anything like that she said come see a man who told me everything that i've done isn't this the very messiah and that's what's going to happen with you when you drink from the water of life amen you have no you don't want to talk about anything else you don't want to be engaged in anything else but amen to talk about jesus christ amen and his power and what he's done for you amen i will may even make a way in the wilderness and rivers in the desert the beasts in the of the field shall honor me the dragons and the owls because i give waters in the wilderness in other words those animals will be satisfied amen and rivers in the desert to give drink to my people watch my chosen amen are you his chosen tonight praise god to give my people my chosen this people have i formed for myself they shall show forth my praise amen you're not going to show forth your own thing you're not going to show forth anybody else's praise amen you're going to show forth his praise amen when you've really drunk from these from these rivers of life amen so we thank we thank god amen for for what god has done you know we thank god for what god will do amen but you know brother branham told us that there's a problem that we have as human beings even as christians is that we thank god for what he's done and we thank god what he will well he will do and we neglect what god is doing right now it's so easy to do that amen we think that right now with what's happening right now with what we're going through right now or whatever problem it is that god's not in our midst yet god is more in the midst than you realize that he is amen oh if we could just go back to when brother branham was here and the when the prayer lines and and those things those things were great for their day and as a matter of fact they were stepping stones for where we are at now we needed that in order to get to where we are now amen but we can't live in those days amen and neglect what god is doing right now because you're going to be like the children of israel being left behind you see they were walking in the journey they stepped through different phases instead where god was god was there in the phase of the 1940s and the 1950s and the 1960s in the in the wilderness amen but god moved on to the 1990s into the 2000s and to the 2010s and to the 2020. amen praise god and god is here amongst us i believe it because each and every one of you who have the holy ghost god is here amen i hope you believe that amen so brother branham says we thank god for what he did in the past and what god will do in the future and fail to thank god for the present amen we failed to do that and you have to realize that when god god is a present god he is a god of the future and he is the god of the past but he what did he tell moses when he appeared before him in the in the in the bush he said where moses asked them what why am i supposed to tell the children of israel when i go down there he said tell them that i am that i am american that i am that they serve that's the i am that i that i am amen he didn't say i will be or i was i am dead i am amen praise god an ever-present god amen in the time of trouble praise god amen amen but branham says in in um he says that all the natural things of the earth type the spiritual and then everything in the natural types types the spiritual amen everything amen so things that that that we're looking at i just want to mention a few things amen that uh just to lay a foundation to where i want to go amen but we see that the what we've been going through in the last several months and and it's been uh it's been weary it's been tiresome amen it's been it's been a lot of changes amen but god you have to remember that god is allowing it again always think about this god only cares about fulfilling his word and whatever needs to take place in order for the word to be fulfilled that's what that's what will happen he knows us better than we know ourselves we think that we're in the in in a position in a certain position and we're probably million miles away from that position that we think that we are therefore god puts us in positions in places and in certain situations to make us realize hey you're not where you think you are to make us think in our on our ways to make us think about what it is that i believe who it is that i'm really serving praise god what kind of example i'm being for my family my friends my the people around me you see god cares about those things and therefore he puts things in certain ways amen that makes you amen do according to his will amen praise god now the bible tells us in ephesians chapter 6 verse 12 he says for rewrestle not paul speaking for rest are not against flesh and blood but against principalities against powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world amen against spiritual wickedness in high places amen we have to remember amen that this is a spiritual battle right this is not a physical battle although we see so many things in this hour that make it seem like it's a physical battle everybody fighting amongst each other the race wars and all this kind of foolishness and nonsense politicizing everything and and we see it it's it's it's it's sinful it's gross and it's it's it's heartbreaking almost that's right but that's what's happened am i right to make us think see satan wants us to be fighting each other and failing and failing so that we can forget amen what's going on behind the scenes right so while we're fighting amongst each other amen we we we we're falling spiritually we're falling and we fail to forget amen the greater purpose and so that's what god wants us that's what satan would want us to do it's a spirits it's a spirit that is out there amen anointing people it's nothing but satan yeah that's right fighting each other all these riots all these things all these things going on that you see in the media there's nothing but the spirit of satan in this hour but we know that these things have to be these things have to be amen but you have to remember that you're not rest you're not wrestling with flesh and blood i'm not wrestling brother zach i'm not i'm not fighting brother don that no they're not my enemies amen as a matter of fact brother brown said that i am my own enemy that's right that's right satan's not even the greatest enemy satan just comes in and anoints your fl your your mind that anoints your your thinking and anoints your spirit amen and you have to wrestle with your own self every morning that you get up you have you have somebody there to wrestle with you as soon as you look in that mirror and it's you uh what decisions you will make what choices you will make that day what attitude you will have that day what things you will say that day because the your flesh and your spirit would want to go a certain way because it's the easiest way it's the easiest route somebody flips you off while you're driving hey man it's it's the easiest way to do it back it's the easiest way to to to to to to honk your horn and and then and do something back that's the easy route the hard route is not to go that way about that amen that's that's the that's the tough route now don't tell me that none of you all had had that problem have had that temptation somebody cuts you off or something like that you just stay nice and quiet i kind of doubt everybody has has acted that way [Laughter] amen but god's calling us i mean so so the the more often the more often you get cut off the mo for you to learn that lesson the more you're going to get cut off the more you're going to get flipped you know the more because god wants you to learn that lesson amen praise the lord jesus amen so thinking back on these changes amen remember returning to god's normal amen and we saw that there were very abrupt changes amen from the beginning of the year amen they were placed upon us pretty much overnight we were living january and february amen just normal like like nothing was had nothing was going on yeah we heard about a virus in china and you know kind of hearing the news and didn't think it was going to come here amen all of a sudden things changed amen and they they told us they told us that life amen was not going to be the same anymore and that everything is going to be different from now on the life that you knew before amen that's totally gone that's exactly what they're telling us now amen the world leaders and powers and powers that be they're all talking about a new normal as a matter of fact in the next few months you will probably continue to hear these phrases more out more and more a new normal a great reset and in the fourth industrial revolution now i don't say this you go to their websites and you can read about their in their own literature they talk about these things matter of fact they talked about these things even before the coronavirus hit this is what they want right oh yeah and if you if you know anything about the new world order this is exactly this is just another phrase for the new world order which the pope is in line with and and all the all these things all these people they're in line with with all of this and you're going to continue to hear amen so they want a radical change to take place what is the great reset what they're talking about is a complete change of the way human beings used to live they can't live the same way anymore and then they say they say they quote they say we've got to take advantage of the current pandemic in order to implement this change is there is there is there uh opportunity is what they say amen in the industrial revolution in a nutshell because we had for example the first industrial revolution made made uh was about using the steam and the coal a man to produce the engines and and things like that the second industrial revolution made use of electricity and petroleum and assembly lines that was around the turn of world war one all the way to around world war ii that was the second industrial revolution the third industrial revolution made use of digital electronics around the 70s till now right amen and then people also refer to it as the information age that's the age that we are living now that's the and they call that the third industrial revolution that's the age that most of us lived in that's right right amen it's the age i grew up in and it was it was nice it was it was nice the technology you know the smartphone came you know we didn't have to use the dumb phone anymore the smartphone came and not realizing that that smartphone you know it just tracks you wherever you go and then and it's it's just but because it takes pictures and everything like that you know it's all nice it's all pretty and on the back end they're doing things that you have no idea what's going on but now we're involved we're getting into what's called the fourth industrial revolution now you don't believe me you go and google these things it's there i'm not making none of this stuff up this is what they say the fourth industrial revolution is it says it's not only about smart and connected machines and systems it's a scope of the scope is much wider it's what they say it is the fusion of these technologies and their interaction across the physical digital and biological domains in other words what they want to do is they want you they want to mess you with machines some way or another i don't know how they're going to do it where you don't have to physically hold a tablet hold a keyboard use a mouse use a smart watch no you are the the machine right it's in you i hope we don't get to that oh you got that yeah i hope i hope i hope that i want to go home but this is the this is the this is what they want to take us this is the perversion that they want to take remember satan is the god of this age satan is the god of this of this evil world that we're living in and all satan does he hates the image of god he hates he and we and he knows that each and every one of us are created in the image of god and he hates it amen so he's trying to distort the image of god in this in this hour and i the things i've been i listen to the speeches of these people when they uh where they have the davos uh meetings and the world economic forums and all these things i listen to what they what they say and it it it it's almost creepy what they talk about but they talk about things regarding uh and it's almost it's almost like they're just blaspheming god they said our our our uh our data the data that they that they can they can grab from us that's the reason why you have smart watches that they monitor your health monitor your heartbeat and all that kind of stuff you think that's going that's going somewhere and they're going to use it and it's going to get it's just going to get it's going to get even worse but they say all this stuff is going to the clouds and it's going to be an a.i they're they're going to have an ai there to uh you know to manage things and then they say but it's not managed by a god above the clouds is what they say they say it's not has nothing to do with a god above the clouds but a but a god but the but the clouds that we have the microsoft cloud and the apple cloud and all these things and it's just such a blasphemy and then they talk about that these things this data that they're grabbing from you will be able to tell you if if for example the guy that was giving the speech he said he said i i didn't know that i was gay until i was 21 years old he said if i would have had this data if this data was being was being taken from me even at a young age it would have told me that i i was i was gay before i turned 21. see and that's what they want to they they they want to come to they want to they want to tell you the data wants to tell you the ai wants to tell you if you're a girl or a boy it's crazy it's crazy amen but that's what that's that's what the the that's what this world's coming to amen so this new normal amen that these that these elites in the world want it's it's anti-god it's satanic amen it's a dictatorship over you and i yeah amen but you know what saints god god has wanted the same people but not over a people and not a dictatorship over a people amen but he's been wanting to do the same thing but through a people amen he's been wanting to do the exact same thing but through a people amen ever since he created adam amen his idea was for for him to use man amen to rule this domain as a matter of fact adam had that domain had that had had that rule over the earth and he said he said adam you rule the earth and i'll take care of heaven that's right brother and of course we know that that sin came in the picture and it took all of that and that's the reason why animals now they they fear us and and when those things didn't even used to be you could go and pet a lion you could go pet a tiger and you could be with a deer and he wouldn't even run away but now all that's changed but you see the the reason why you desire to go for those things is because that is out there for you right yeah how many have not been a deer and and wanted to to be next to a deer you know to maybe pet it or something like that i know maybe some of you girls maybe might have felt that way i know my little girls i mean when they were younger i wish i could go pet the squirrel you know but the squirrel runs away you see so but that's not from the beginning amen god always wanted to rule amen and god has always been interested in sharing everything that he is with this group amen that's why he said in the word that we are heirs and joiners with christ if we are his children amen everything that he owns everything that he is we are amen when we receive the new birth in soul praise god and that is going to drive us a man to a body change amen the world wants a a technic a technocratic body change amen but god is going to have a body change for us amen and it's going to be a body that's not ever going to die an eternal body making this body that you live in amen this past house that you live in right now eternal amen right amen amen what great things amen that we're looking forward to amen see we are heirs and joint heirs amen when i got married with my wife amen i i didn't have much i had a little 98 honda civic red honda civic and and a little bit of money in the bank and then didn't have much but everything that i had became hers too that's right that's right you see everything that i owned the bank account the my honda civic even my clothes if she could wear them they were hers and that was hard for for for a guy who's used to being living single for 25 years but it but but it became hers yeah right now she's still you know she still let me use them i'm just missing but everything that i had became hers why because we got married there's no such thing that you're you when you get married your bank account you have a bank account here your the wife and and the husband has a bank account here by him so that that's that shouldn't be that way that's not how that's not how god intended it to be and as a matter of fact you're going to realize you're going to have problems by having living your life like that you having separate banks accounts and then you're going to you're just going to bring problems you everything when you get married you join everything together because why it keeps you accountable to each other for one amen and and and it removes barriers of confusion amen you know where the money is going because it's one account amen but one has one account and one has another account or two or three accounts over here and you're wondering where's all the money going at why it's because it's not centralized amen i don't know how it got to that but maybe somebody needed it praise god so those that maybe that want to get married later you know think about those things amen think about those things so so everything that i had belongs to her amen because we got married see the marriage takes place here spiritually the marriage takes place here that's the reason why when you receive the holy ghost amen praise god that's a marriage amen that's a marriage and when we get to glory amen when we get that's that's just the wedding supper then that's just the celebration of the marriage praise god that took place down here that's the reason why when we're married down here amen is just that's why we become heirs and joiners with christ everything that he owns everything that he conquered everything that he is amen belongs to us praise god amen i love that amen praise god now we know that jesus christ he's the he's a he's a true leader amen amen and a true leader is one who is out there with the people right he's out there a true leader is out there working with the people getting his hands her hands dirty with the people not just telling people what to do go do this go do that good thing that no no he's out there doing it with them and even showing them how to do things that's a true leader and jesus christ this is that's that's what he did for us amen he experienced what it was to be sick to have a headache so that when you have it amen you re he knows what you're going through he knows what it is to be tempted when you're a young person why because he was a young person right amen he knows when he knows when you when there's a death in in the family why because he has experienced that as well he had family as well and they died as a matter of fact look what happened when when lazarus died he cried he cried as a human being but as god he said lazarus come forth amen and he had to come forth amen praise god amen so uh just remember in thinking about this this thought amen returning to god's normal amen now isaac newton said said something and and the brothers can bring it up i think i gave it to him as isaac newton being a scientist he said this he said everything continues in a state of rest unless it is compelled to change by forces impressed upon it let me read that again everything everything including us continue in a state of rest unless it is compelled to change by forces impressed upon it right amen that's how we were before that's all this stuff hit and we were just relaxed resting we go to church we go to work we come home we get and do this that we play with our children we do this nothing you know it's all just relaxing and restful and until something hits and it impresses upon you changes have to make have to make have to take place amen praise god something for example something uh something lands that's bigger over this pulpit if it comes down from the sky and crushes the pulpit amen it's going to make a change to the pulpit because that item that that it's it's bigger than the pulpit it's going to crush it it's going to make a change because forces have been impressed upon it you see and the same thing with you and i amen sometimes god saints has to impress a force upon us amen in order for us to change otherwise we're just pieces of daily daily and relaxing and thinking that everything is fine and dandy when in reality it is not in reality amen you're you're in a state of of mind that that oh it makes you want to uh because you're so relaxed you start devin into things that you really shouldn't be doing right brother amen have you ever noticed that when you're bored when you're bored when you're not really engaged in doing something that you should be doing or keeping your mind busy it's when satan comes in don't tell me you've never experienced that if you're not then you're not human if you're if you don't keep your mind occupied especially on on the things of god or doing something good amen that glory brings glory to god you better believe satan's going to come in there some way or another and totally distort that right amen because he knows your weaknesses he knows exactly what he can do and what buttons to press in order to get you to do something that later you feel condemned doing that's right you you feel condemned and then now it makes it worse now you don't want to read the bible now you don't want to pray not why because you feel so condemned and you feel like god won't hear you anymore amen i'm talking to somebody amen you feel condemned you feel you feel like you don't even want to go to church anymore i don't even want to see the people at church anymore and every time that preacher preaches up there amen i just get bored and i just sleep because why you've accumulated so many bad wrong things that you've been doing and now because you don't want to confess them you think that god won't hear you now you're living in a in a state of confusion in a state of backslid and the only one that can save you is god right right and the only way that you can he can save you is if you turn to him amen with all your heart amen amen praise god amen so so let not much rest be uh get get among you amen too much rest uh among you in your life amen eventually something's to come in as god's got to come in and take that rest too much rest too much relaxing too much thinking i got i got money in the bank i got two or three cars uh you know i'm paying high insurance on them but big monthly payments on but but it's all right i've got as long as i can make the monthly payment i know it's okay no once some way or another god's gonna make it to where you're not gonna rely on these things those things will be gone one day and all that's left is what you've done for others and what you've done for christ amen your bank account won't save you no right nope even president trump can't save you that's right everybody's just pull oh after november 3rd we can't wait well amen everything's going to get back to normal when president trump becomes president again and he gets elected i'll give you some news president trump is not going to make everything better he's actually one of the ones that visits these world economic forums he was there last year so whatever they talk about over there he's in on it so he's not gonna make everything better that's the reason why we got to amen look to the word amen jesus christ amen the president changes hey man your dad changes your mom changes your brother might change but god never changes hebrews 13 8 jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever and that is the only person that i can put my faith and confidence in that he will never fail me is this word this word never has and never will fail me no matter how much pressure comes in my life no matter how many changes come in my life no matter how many new normals they put in amen this word never fails amen the word never fails amen brother branham says this he says strange sometimes god does things off of the color that we think it ought to be in amen we thought that hillary clinton was going to be in the white house four years ago it didn't happen because why we put in our mind we we we fix things in our mind that it's got to be this way and and two plus two equals four and and this but yeah it's got to be that way and nothing can change you yeah until god totally does everything totally different from you and you have to re lower your head then and realize you were wrong but some of us don't admit it we just can't if you if we could just admit that we were wrong sometimes right that we fail and that we and that we did somebody wrong you know it would take us more a long long way our relationships amongst each other would be so much better amen strange sometimes god does things off of the color that we think it ought to be in this fellow you see was born talking about jesus this fellow was born to their opinion at an illegitimate birth his mother gave birth to him before her and her husband was married as brother don so greatly stated this morning it was a turning the corner amen a turn in the corner they didn't recognize it it usually happens that way it comes to that corner time amen that's what god is doing right now he's turning the corner he's moving amen and you've got to be following praise god and when a man overcomes in contact ever comes in contact with jesus christ he is different from he is a different he's different from man you're never the same when you want to see him if there's any spark of god about you amen again god's going back to god's normal god's normal has always been from the beginning it's never changed it's still the same amen and that's why he's trying to get us to come back to his standard and his standard is his word [Music] his normal is his word amen praise god praise god and god loves making changes yet he himself doesn't change he loves allowing you to get in situations where you don't know what to do and that's a good thing amen that's a good thing that's not a bad thing if you're a child a son and daughter of god god has a purpose for those things if you just hold on you will see the purpose amen amen i want to i want us to look at some examples amen let's look at job for example amen job was living his life he had uh according to the bible i think he was one of the wealthiest man in the world at the time you see had lots of things he had cars he had uh you know chariots he had nice things anything that amanda a wonderful family he had lots of children and and a wife amen what more could a man ask for and he also served god see he was a church-going man he he went to church he paid his tithes he he was good to the brethren he shook the pastor's hand and he listened to the word and took notes as he was listening he never fell asleep in church the bible says that even he even would offer sacrifices to god and would offer sacrifices for his children in case they had sinned and he didn't know anything about it right look how devout he was and one day satan comes to him and says have you considered have you consider what about job how come he he prospers so much because you are always backing him up and so because god had so much confidence in job he says okay touch him but do not take his life that's right you can take everything from him do everything that you want to but do not take his life and that's exactly what he did and in a moment's time saints in a moment's time when at one day joe had money in the bank he had his cars he had he had everything that he could want a good family and all those things in a moment's time all that was gone right his house was gone his everything was gone right except for his wife and then his wife even changed he started mouthing off of him telling him just curse god and die amen so there was a change but we know the end of the story the purpose see god was using god was trying to show satan something but was also trying to make job realize something about himself as well that he didn't know and would not know if that would not have happened in his life he came to a point where he said now i know my redeemer lives and in that day i'll see him amen in this body that's right amen praise god he would not come to that point if he had not went through that amen let's look at the children of israel for just a moment amen the children of israel amen when they were in goshen remember goshen after after they uh pharaoh told them that they could stay in the best part of of of egypt it was goshen they lived in the united states of america they were the land was was pl it was plenty it was it was good land they could grow anything i mean they had they had everything and for years they were prospering they were growing they had bank accounts they were making money buying new cars chariots they had gadgets everything and they went to church and it seemed like god was on by on their behind it was backing them up oh god amen i could i know god is is for me in it for us because look how our nation prospers look how we prosper look how look at the god is another business account that's come in oh thank god yes and no doubt god was allowing that for their lives but you have to remember that that back in early in genesis chapter 15 i believe it was god had already given abraham a word and told him that your that your ancestors or the ones that were coming before you they were going to be enslaved for 400 years and that had to come to pass some way or another now the children of israel is they were living they didn't know anything about this that that word was given to abraham maybe they did maybe they did it but somehow it was it was it was out of sight out of mind and it had to come to pass all their comfort and all everything that they had and all the good things and everything all of a sudden came to knock came to a halt came to a screeching halt when when that pharaoh came in that new pharaoh that didn't know joseph came on the scene amen in this hour amen we might have a pharaoh that doesn't know joseph he sounds like he knows joseph but we don't know how do we know that's why we can't put trust in a man we can't put trust on anybody i'm telling you we cannot put trust on anybody outside of christ do not put trust in trump i'm telling you do not do it right because eventually trump will fail you and then what he wasn't able to stop a virus from coming in right so man can't do these things only god can praise god and so that word that was given to abraham needed to be fulfilled amen then what happens israel crying out for a deliverer for 400 plus years they were there crying for deliverer and it took those circumstances of them being whipped at them being enslaved amen for them to get down really sincere with god and say lord the promise that you made amen you've got to bring it to pass and we believe it and they got such desperation and god then came on the scene then right god then came on the scene when they got into desperation don't wait until you get into desperation or something terrible happens in your life for you to come to god don't wait for for your for for you to have a car accident or for one of your children something happened to your children for you to get closer to god amen don't wait amen for for for your bank account where you to lose your your money or go bankrupt or something like that for you to get closer to god amen get prayed up now for that time because we know bad times are coming so get prayed up now get prepared now get in the word now amen god is on the scene god is present amen he's ready to give you exactly what you need amen don't wait till then you think things are going to get better and you think that things are going back to normal they're not they already said that they're not amen amen it's time to get serious with god saints quit your foolishness put your plane around and get serious with god so the children of israel they were crying out and finally they were delivered but the deliverance didn't come to them the way they thought it should [Music] the deliverance came totally different from what they thought and so because it came that way then they started murmuring and complaining and then they started thinking in their journey to the wilderness to the promised land they were so excited at first and then in the middle of their journey they because everything got so hard and they they felt like there wasn't any food they started looking back at the flesh spots of egypt and had the garlics and the onions of egypt not realizing that there was those same flesh pots in those same pleasures amen also brought to them enslavement and torture but but because when when when you're in total when you forget that god is present and something's going on in your life and you forget that god is allowing this in your life amen you become blind and you start thinking you start thinking negative and you start thinking you start thinking that god is not unseen when god is on the scene you think god had forgotten them while they were in the journey when they didn't have quail god was right there the whole time god was right there in the form of a pillar of fire form of a cloud and they had a prophet with the word of the lord there but they had a hard time believing the prophet does that happen to us in this hour people that that have believed this message 30 40 years ago oh yes god sent a prophet praise god yes and they've shouted and jumped and screamed and they probably even spoke in tongues and then all of a sudden in the middle of their journey oh that prophet he says he's a prophet but i don't know now i don't know now i think i'd rather go back go back to what that's right that's what i want to ask these these people i pray for them i i you know i be i believe as long as they're still alive there's mercy for them that's just what i believe you can believe whatever you want to but i believe that there's mercy there for them but how in the world can you go back amen when you've experienced this wonderful word to go what to a baptist church how in the world can i go back to a baptist church when i came out of the baptist church and thought that that when i came out that was the greatest thing that had happened when this word came into my life to go back to the baptist church or to the pentecostal church no amen but that's what the children of israel were desiring to go back to the baptist church where they were enslaved amen because we don't believe the prophet anymore nah i don't even know how i got into that amen we also see an example with daniel amen daniel also they were living their life just fine comfortable and all of a sudden babylon came in took over amen took them to babylon and then they were enslaved and and but you see the story that that all that worked together for good amen praise god and so at this at this time look at the disciples amen when the disciples were were with jesus jesus was with them everything was just fine and dandy miracles were taking place uh uh great wonderful things were taking place amongst them and they thought that jesus would always be with them and then jesus would tell them listen the day will come i'm going to have to go away this is going to happen and they didn't even believe what they were what he was saying peter actually rebuked him one day and said not far be far from the lord be far from thee that can't happen denying the word and the word telling him what was going to happen so i wonder if we do that sometimes deny the word as the word is going forth amen you might not be doing it verbally but you might be doing it from your heart when you're there thinking about what i'm going to do at home as soon as i get home because i got something to do at home when you should be listening and paying attention to the word you're denying the word when you're thinking and you're wondering i wonder if such and such is listening to this uh uh uh oh this is for them yeah yeah get em get em get em get em preached yeah yeah yeah you're denying the word right right you're denying the word when you should be saying lord that's for me let me change so that that change can take place amongst others amen let me be the change you see right but we're there thinking about oh i hope i hope she's getting it yeah yeah preach on them skirts preach on oh yeah preach yeah all right buddy you're right a little bit down home right that's good sometimes but see jesus eventually went away and then everything changed it was a big change that took place for the disciples amen amen in hebrews it talks about god doing away with the old covenant and establishing a new one in hebrews chapter 8 the bible says but now hath he obtained a more excellent ministry by how much also he is the mediator of a better covenant which we was established upon better promises do you realize that the great things the the the the the superheroes of the old testament that we so say you know the david's the the the the the moses the the you know elijah and all these things they did every they did the things that they did and they did not even have the new birth they they did not have the new birth the way you and i can have it today in their soul they had a form of salvation they had they had an anointing you see but they did not have the baptism of the holy ghost because why could not come because jesus had to first die resurrect and come back amen in the form of the holy ghost that's why they could not have it that way but what about you and i am with the holy ghost in this hour what great things can you and me do amen amen what what kind of things if we are called amen for doing something like that that doesn't mean you know that you can just go do it randomly whenever no it's if god needs you to amen god will let you know amen amen if god told me tonight that i need to go to the hospital there in gainesville and go pray for somebody because they're dying of cancer amen and when that when i pray for them they're going to resurrect amen they're going to get better amen i better go do it amen and yes you can go and do it amen and something may happen or not happen but you you know but it's when god tells you to do it best you go do it praise god verse 8 says for finding fault with them he said behold the days come say the lord when i will make a new covenant with the house of israel let's go down to verse 10 i'm trying to make this quick for this is the covenant that i will make with the house of israel after those days said the lord i will put my laws into their mind and write them in their hearts and i will be them to them a god and they shall be to me a people isn't that what happened to you and i right he's talking about the children of israel amen but that's exactly what has happened to us too amen and verse 13 it says a new covenant he have made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away ah i've always wondered why that was the word of god to vanish away did you see uh well all what it is is god's building on top of it not not vanishing his word can't go he can't go that's the foundation but it's building on top amen praise god amen amen and we see in second corinthians chapter five we're trying to move quickly that if any man be in christ he is a new creature all things hath passed away behold all things have become new amen you cannot be doing the same things that you were doing when you come to christ if you were if if you were drunk you can't be a drunk anymore when you really come to christ if you were a drug addict when you come to christ you can't be a drug addict anymore because all things that you were done that you were doing were old all old things have become new amen see god's about making things new amen bringing us back to that normal amen that has always been right amen ephesians 4 22 tells us that ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after god is created in righteousness and true holiness amen praise god brother brown says here you know that's what's the matter with the church today it don't get in the spirit enough we're too much in ourselves my if you'll just get off of yourself long enough you say well you know our churches we have a regular routine oh who cares about your routine brother brandon says i wish you'd get out of the routine long enough to get saved anyhow amen get saved get out of the routine we don't care about the routine get in the spirit then you can see things done brother branham says amen when something gets out of cater oh well that's not what we do i wonder if sometimes if we hinder the spirit because we do that right because we're too much into the routine oh we don't do it like that around here and you may be quenching the spirit of god and you'll not even know it that's right so maybe god is using all of these changes saints amen for us to examine ourselves amen to examine our prayer life to examine our bible reading and studying amen if we're doing it enough to examine our sincerity are we sincere how are we sincere with each other or sincere sincere with with god amen to examiners to examine our motives what are what are our motives what's your motive for coming to church what's your motive for doing the things that you do on a daily life is it to glorify god or is it another reason god knows god knows your heart amen and to examine our relationships amen to for us to check our examine our relations check our relationships with each other i believe it's time for us to talk about things and to bring things out amen that still are bothering you if something something is going on amen in your life and you can't go away amen examine yourself right with that person make it right love the example that brother wade did the other day amen that thing that was bothering him and man he called the brother up amen i had a phone call with a brother just the other just last week about a certain thing and when we talked about it everything was cleared up it feels good to know the truth about things right right i think it's time for us to do that but sometimes we don't want to do it because we don't want to admit that we're wrong or you know if i'm wrong i want to admit that i'm wrong don't wait for for you for things to get worse for you to get things right with your brother or your sister for this first people to be dying amongst us and things like that or or something terrible to happen in your family for you to realize you know what i wonder if this is because this happened and this still has not been made right think about that amen just give me a few more minutes saints amen make you laugh for just a moment one time i was i was reading something and there was a man that was living in the backwoods of tennessee and think you know this is about regarding change change is not bad all the time change sometimes is good there was a man living in tennessee and back in the early 1900s he had never been to the city before he was a farmer he was a backwoods type of person and him and his family they lived there in tennessee and and one day he got the opportunity to visit the city amen and in the city he stood before in front of a building and this building there was a there was an elevator there of course he had never seen anything like this before and he sees this old lady you know this older lady just you know just walking in dirt with inside and pushes the button and gets inside the elevator door and he's just sitting there looking at her and like wow how this works and he just waits and he waits for a few minutes and and next thing a minute or two minute two or three minutes later this young woman comes out young woman comes out and you know she's nice looking and then and and my and all of a sudden he looks at his son he says billy come get your mother over here bring your mother over here he realized something amen maybe maybe that thing right there can change my wife he thought that was the same lady that walked in that was a good change amen that was a good change so changes changes aren't always good and this i want to finish up with this saints god right now amen everything remember in mount transfiguration amen when during the mount transfiguration god said uh uh there you know what happened and god said uh it's all it was all in him amen hear ye him amen it was all in jesus amen amen the fullness of the godhead bodily dwelled in him amen praise god but now we got to get that same fullness amen that same that same jesus amen it's got to live in us amen in the form of the holy ghost amen and in this hour that's what's happening amen god is transitioning now amen it's not just god speaking through the prophet or god speaking amen but now god is using a man a bride to speak through in this hour amen praise god amen we know the we know these quotes amen we know what brother branham said about for example in this last day there is again another people in the land who under the under their messenger will be the final voice to the final age do you believe that i believe that with all my heart amen i believe that i'm seeing them right now you and i amen the final voice to the final age it's not just in the man not just why but but in in in the prophet amen the prophet's not here with us amen but the voices amen and that voice is christ's voice amen another one and the same and you can read these in the church age book yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of god speaking of the nominal church it is in it is its own mouthpiece in other words it went and did his own thing so god is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of god will be in her amen that's the that's the normal that's that's the normal that god's trying to get us back to the normal from the beginning amen when god created adam amen and adam had just to speak anything he wanted to yes sir god's trying to bring us back to that to that place amen oh and he says oh he has given a voice to the bride that voice is in the bride so if you deny that you're denying the message that you say you believe that's right you don't believe the church age book when you don't like when people sing about the voices in the bride and those types of things like that there's something wrong with your experience with god because that's what exactly what the prophet said and that's what the word says amen look what the word says in revelations chapter 22 it says and the spirit and the bride say come if if the voice if the bride didn't have a voice say man why is she saying come on amen the bride has a voice amen praise god and and in revelations chapter 21 look what look what god is gonna gonna do and god shall wipe away all tears from their eyes and there shall be no more death neither sorrow nor crying neither shall there be any more pain look for the former things are passed away amen and he that set up on the throne which is jesus christ said behold i make all things new the world wants a a great reset amen in the physical and they might get it but it won't last but this new that god is creating it's eternal amen it's forever and ever and we're part of it saints and he said unto me right for these words look are true and faithful that means they're not gonna fail amen they are not going to fail amen so saints it's time for you to make a decision right now it's the time of decision amen if you love him praise god then throw everything out throw everything that you have amen if you really believe his word amen throw let it go let everything else go amen and stay with the word if you say that you really love god and you really believe his word then let everything else go and get into god do the things that you need to do to get you to get you in step with god because if you don't feel that you're in step with god maybe you're not doing that thing that you know you need to do and when you're not doing that thing that you know you need to do in order for you to get closer to god that is iniquity that is iniquity and i pray amen if i have iniquity in my heart i want to make it right god show me amen i want to make it right i hope that's your desire tonight amen let's stand to our feet praise god returning to god's normal it's not a new normal god doesn't have new normal he doesn't change god's normal was established amen in in the book of genesis or before the foundation of the world amen amen god's normal was there and god knows what we are going through god knows what our futures will be and you just stay and stay concentrated in god you know sometimes when we get off of looking into the word the way we should and looking into other things and amen we get sight off of the main thing and we start getting fearful and we start getting we start getting uh uh we start disbelieving the word that god would not be able to take care of us when in reality god is more than able amen god has made a way remember that's why i read there in isaiah that he has made a way in the wilderness and has made rivers in the desert all right god can do that amen praise god brother boy amen 2 37 i once was lost in [Music] and
