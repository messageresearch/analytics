TRANSCRIPT
========================================
good morning and God bless you it's good to be in the house of the Lord and we sure enjoyed the service yesterday and looking coming from more this morning let's just go to the Lord in prayer before we uh get into the study Lord God we so grateful for your word to give us encouragement and strength Lord I pray God that you'll be with us today as we and guide us through these scriptures as we look at your word Lord grant it now Lord that you'll bless the service be with us today to give us exactly what we have need of we pray in your name amen so 1 Corinthians 7 is getting into I just got a little subtitle here marriage Ministry and making choices making good choices um of course you know Paul kind of he he he gets into marriage and divorce a little bit here and I'm not diving into that but just uh uh cover the high points a little bit and uh so what he says to kind of frame up you know uh if you don't think that Paul is difficult to understand you haven't meditated on it long enough you know many things that Paul says are are like Peter said they're they're hard they're hard to understand not just because of the way that he says things sometimes but because we're living in a different time where where you got kind of have to get into the spirit of what he's saying and and meditate on the context and all of those things so to set the the context in in uh verse 26 of this chapter he says he's he's framing up all of these things that he's talking about with marriage you know be staying single and whatnot he says I suppose therefore that this is good for the present distress so consider those things as we look at the the present distress is in in that time that they were going through there was there was a lot of persecution and it was rough on Believers and uh it it's there there's so many stories that you can tell from the the early Christian faith I was looking at one where um the Roman Empire began to haul people uh and persecute them and kill them because they would go to people's doors and open it up and say well if you have any literature here then you're going to die for it so the the Christians of that time they begin to divide up and and they would say well some said what we should tell them we don't have any literature some would say well uh if you don't if you if you hide it then you're not really a real Christian so you you you're you need to if you're not being frank with them and saying we've got Christian literature in our house then you're not really a real Christian so that's the that that's the day and the hour that they were living in where it was it was rough uh you know we we uh you know in this day we get persecuted at school and people look at you strange and when you go to Walmart maybe sometimes and we're treated as an oddball but in the day and the hour that they were living in uh you you were going to die for your faith so uh and I I apologize I just realized this is super small but you just have to maybe just listen for a second the all these distresses the imprisonment torture execution that' haul you and to be to be killed by lions Jewish opposition on every hand you know the Christians were facing the uh the the the opposition from Jewish authorities which would beat them and stone them and social isolation and rejection and economic hardship you say you're a Christian now you don't you've lost your job you you've lost your trade Partnerships now they're refusing to participate with you because you're not going to the temple the Corinthian Temple and participating in their Pagan practices cultural pre pressures and moral corruption legal and Civic restrictions loss of Rights and privileges they take your property away because they knew that you were a Christian forced Exile push you out of the city push you out of everything that you knew and and risk of betrayal from your family and from from friends and all of that psychological and emotional stress so so that kind of frames up that Paul's saying he's trying to advise and give wise counsel on how to live in these times and and you know there's so many other places where brother where where Paul would say that marriage is a a really good thing and in in Proverbs we'll start with that whoos so findeth a wife findeth a good thing and he Hebrews 13 Paul said marriage is Honorable in all and the bed undefiled and in Ephesians 5:25 he said husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it in Ephesians 5:28 he says so ought men to love their wives as their own bodies he that loveth his wife loveth himself and Ephesians 5:33 he said nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverence her husband so marriage is an institution is is a is a biblically uh it's it's something that God has always encouraged and and and you know I'm reminded of that table quot where brother R said somebody asked him at the end of his life what what do you think about marriage or whatever and he said if I had it all over to do again I sure would I sure would get married it's it's wonderful it's been wonderful I think anybody that's got a real good solid foundation marriage will say the same thing marriage is the best a good marriage is like the best thing ever it's it's just wonderful to have somebody that you can yoke up with and go through life together and and uh and have the same go uh you know when when problems come and and you're faced with situations you got somebody a buddy to go through with you and and that's why brother Rand would say I'm framing it up here in in the serpent scene message he said he's talking about Adam that a man man in his Spirit was both man and woman and woman is just part of man and that's how God wants marriages Mar a marriage to be ver to be so part of one another until our inheritance our life our thoughts our our desires everything is just yoked up until we're just we're just approaching problems together when a man takes to himself a wife and if she's correctly his wife a god-given wife she'll be just to him as part of him and look what he said that's the reason you have so many Scruples in marriage is because you go out and see some girl with pretty brown eyes or blue eyes or something like that some pretty figure and you fall for her first time she has her first baby teeth baby them teeth comes out and she gets wrinkled and old and then you want to kick her out and some of you women find some little boy with his hair slick down his Mam's lard can half dumped on him so y'all y'all think us preachers are rough sometimes he could lay it out could he and curly it'll all fall out I know that by experience but what happens what is it you fall for that you ought to pray first because a woman is part of you now ain't that the truth you look back in life and you can see so many so many times people will that like this is the most important decision of your life well we'll say second most important most important is to be born again and to follow Christ but but the one of the most important decisions in life and people so many times will just take it a happen passard approach like what he's saying here they fall for somebody that just will will tell them that they love them will tell them something and then then you're yoked up with that person for the rest of your life and it ends up you know ruining many experiences and things like that course you know we've got thank God we've got that promise that now if you ended up if you made wrong choices and somehow you wound up with a a spouse that doesn't believe and uh you know things aren't aren't right that over there everything will be made right but if you pray and and you go into it soberly and you really think about it and you enter in in uh knowing that this is what God wants you to do the marriage can be it'll be the the best thing ever it's it's wonderful and you you you testify those things to your spouse and that that'll make a happy marriage I tell my wife all the time I I I don't know what I would do without you because because a a a good spouse is just better than it's better than gold somebody that can uh I you know you you can talk to your spouse in a way you can't talk to anybody else and and just bounce ideas and things off of them and they become a sounding board almost and and and and that that is something to think that God didn't want us to go through life alone but to go through life with somebody that we can partner with and not just partner with but be part of us so that we have the same inheritance the same everything now so we get into Corinthians and Paul's trying to frame up to the Corinthians he's he's straightening up their thinking now isn't that the wonderful thing about the word of God is we think one way and then we look into the word of God and it starts shaping our thinking it starts changing our mind to where we're thinking like Christ so you saying now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me it it's good for a man not to touch a woman this is what we tell the young people when they go to camps and everything you you know don't you can't be holding hands you if you going if you're going to hold hands you got to do it with a stick between you because you you you don't be touching uh because that leads to problems he's nevertheless to avoid fornication let every man have his own wife and let every woman have her own husband let the husband render under the wife due benevolence and likewise also the wife under the husband now what's he saying he's so some of the Believers in Corinth They Come Away with all these ideas is that that some thought that abstinence even within marriage was a sign of Greater Holiness isn't that funny how we get get away caught up with these ideas sometimes that you're married and and and if you just you just be real Pious and just stay away from well well we we don't do those things the rest of the world does that but not us so Paul's bringing them back to alignment like I if you're if you're married you know render to one another and I'm I'm saying this in a in a you know what I'm doing other others may have been neglecting their spouses that causing unnecessary Temptation and and in verse four he says the wife hath not power over her own own body but the husband and likewise the husband hath not power of his own body but the wife ha not power means that neither spouse has exclusive control now look look what the devil wants to do the devil's always about control one one will have control over the other the nickan spirit wants to control the balum spirit wants to have control The Jezebel spirit wants to have control it's all about control God wants to have control too so what he's saying is that that this verse is framing it up so that you're not selfish you're not trying to control the other the wife's not using intimacy as a way to control if you don't give me what I want then I'm going to withhold and the husband's not trying to dominate his wife and control but they're they're both yielding to one another neither one of them is having power power over the other but they're both yielding now there's that scripture that that says do unto do do unto others therefore all things whatsoever you would that men should do to you do ye even so to them for this is the law and Prophets but you know we we get well our mind when we look at this we we'll slide right over to the carinal but there's so much other things that's wrapped up in this scripture that you know like let's when your wife wants to spend time with a husband that coffee time in the morning it you know so many times we maybe men don't want to hear what what their wife has to say or listen to her or whatever almost you know you can get maybe caught up and thinking it's like a nuisance or a bother or something but you know spend your wife wants to spend time with you and she wants to share that the same thing with the husband the husband wants to spend time with the wife I I think one of the most one of the most precious times for me is that coffee time and the morning when you wake up and and you're getting the day started and you you get that coffee brewed and I just sit and and talk to my wife and we'll talk about the day and what we're going to what we what we want and uh life and things like that and you're just and you're just talking uh you're spending time with one another right now now that way you're not you're not jostling for power you're not jostling for control and it and it removes all the barriers and hindrances well well he ain't doing this and that she don't she don't he he don't want to listen to me and all this kind of thing but you're you're you're you're you're Partners you're you're together you're spending time with one another fellowship and you you know go back to that other scripture we we always you know our mind always goes to the carnal but brother R would say that he would always compare that bedroom to prayer to Fellowship you you'll find whenever he would type the bedroom EXP experience he Compares it to prayer and fellowship and communion and when you go into the the outer Court holy C holy into that into that third chamber the private chamber with God you're fellowshipping with him and prayer and and that's really what uh the relationship between a man and a wife should be fellowship and communion where you're talking to one another and you're you're sharing those secret secret things that in the bedroom in the bedroom we talk about things uh frustr ations of life and you know your your children sometimes I I wish they would do this or whatever and things that you would not say outside of the bedroom the bedroom is the the place where things where real True Fellowship occurs now I I think that's what this scripture is talking about that one is not over the other this one's not over this one this one's not over this one but you're you're living your life for the other person in real True Fellowship and harmony he said defraud you not one the other except it be with consent for a time that you may give yourselves to fasting and prayer and come together again that Satan tempt you not for your incontinency now now look how look how he's comparing that personal communion intimacy with your spouse with prayer again another the only valid reason for temporary abstinence in marriage is for dedicated spiritual devotion I I I I think I look at these scriptures like my old friends my my buddies I used to look I used to read this scripture when I was just a a young man and what what I took away from this is that a Christian Life is supposed to be so wound up with with God and and you you're not going to have a happy marriage without God so look look what he's saying that you spend you spend your time with one another but then you withdraw from one another periodically to go and pray with God and fast and get along with God and and there you'll find the secret to a real happy marriage that's that's our problem we get so caught up with social media and all these kind of things and we get frustrated with one another and we ain't praying we're not we're not fasting we're not really serious with God and we get CAU up with with TV shows and and things of this world and problems at work and and this is the part that we're neglecting where uh it he he said you you you you Unite with your spouse you stay yolked up together with her except when you pray get give yourself some time to fast and pray now now there's a secret to a real happy marriage there's a secret to raising your kids when when you when you when you've got that newborn baby and they're crying at night that that's the time and your wife frustrated and struggling with it well that's the good time to go withdraw yourself to pray prayer and go pray over the situation and let God go to work and he said but I speak this by permission and not of commandment for I would that all men were even as I myself but every man hath this proper gift of God one after this manner and another another after that some some people are just able to live a single life some people need to be married one after this manner and one another after that I say therefore to the unmarried and the widows it is good for them if they abide even as I it's good and he's framing it up for contentment and and you know let's let's get real for a second we've all seen situations and things where somebody now they've lost their spouse and and they get lonely and they want to fix it and and then they go and make a rash decision and now they're yoked up with someone that makes their life miserable makes their life a living hell and and so he what he's saying is like let's before before you make a rash decision consider your consider the situation consider what's going to happen next be careful before you enter into a a an alliance an agreement that's going to last for the rest of your life but I speak this by permission and not of commandment for I would that all men were even as I myself but every man ha his proper gift proper gift of God one after this manner and another after that I say we just read that scripture but if they cannot contain let them marry for it is better to marry then to burn we all know what that means he saying celibacy and I took this I did not know that there was a an interesting little movie that they just made a few years ago about Paul Paul Apostle of Christ so I took this uh this might be what he what he might have looked like but anyway he say in celibacy singleness is a spiritual gift from God just as marriage is a gift from God he's not suggesting everybody should remain single nor implying that celibacy is a spir has a superior spirituality he's he's not demeaning marriage or implying that married Believers are second class he's not teaching that believer should force themselves into into a particular way he's just plainly stating that each believer must understand and embrace their unique gift from God whether single or marriage and live that way and unto the married I command yet not I but the Lord let not the wife depart from her husband and over on the side I got the three-fold core but if she depart let her remain unmarried or be reconciled to her husband and let not the husband put away his wife why cuz God wants us to just love one another he's we'll get in a second he's framing it up that even if if you got somebody if you got a spouse that doesn't believe maybe you can save them maybe your life can change the way that they look at things and they'll see by your salty life something that they're lacking in their own life but to the rest speak I not the Lord if any brother had a wife that believeth not and she'd be pleased to dwell with him let him not put her away and the woman which hath an husband that believeth not and if you be pleased to dwell with her let her not leave him for the unbelieving husband is Sanctified by the wife and the unbelieving wife is Sanctified by the husband else were your children unclean but now are they holy now is is Paul easy to understand what's that verse 14 talking about do you know what verse 14 is talking about is verse 14 saying that if you are a Christian and your spouse is not a believer that that puts them in a state of now they're Justified and Sanctified is that where your mind goes what's he saying does that put make them automatically a Believer does does that make your children automatically a Believer and holy is that what he's saying does that mean that your children don't have to have their own personal experience is that what he's saying no that's not what he say so let's now let's examine it with the little time we've got remaining let's just kind of sit on this scripture the and and this is powerful that the unbelieving spouse is Sanctified by the wife not Sanctified as as it makes them automatically a Believer but look at the power that a believing Christian has to change the atmosphere in their home to change things in your home so much that it begins to affect everybody in your home that because a real Holy Ghost fi Christian is a like brother R said they're a Dynamo and and they're your presence in your home can actually change the way that everybody else in your home looks at things and reacts to things it changes things so we'll we'll frame it up like this the Holiness that the believing spouse lives out creates a spiritual atmosphere in the home the believer acts as a living example and conduit of God's sanctifying grace which spills over into the household even if the partner has not yet come to save in faith you got a believing a believing spouse in the home and and and they're not okay with the children wearing clothes that don't become a Christian they're not okay with that kind of worldly music and that atmosphere that they set well they they might go and pray in the evening or pray in the morning and the rest of the family can hear Mama or daddy crying out to God and that sets an atmosphere in the home I I wonder I wonder if our homes are like that I I remember when I just just before we got married talking to my wife about different things and she she there were there were ministers that had made a profound effect on her growing up and on me as well and and and we remember going into their homes and it's like the atmosphere in that home was such that it you knew this was a Christian home that's what this is talking about it it's not just a a dead letter where you're just doing your religion at church but the home is different well we've had people come to our home and and they they they that were going to do work on the home and they step into the house and they they smell that bread cooking and they they can just tell it's something's different and they're like this this is a a this is a home and and you know you got a home like that and when your kids are doing wrong they come across the threshold of that door and they're going to get convicted now that's that's what it means that the a spouse that believes will sanctify their other the other side of the coin and the message love he said oh I'm so glad to know that by Grace he put that in my heart that powerful thing of love it conquers you can conquer your husband if you won't go to church and he fusses at you for going just pray now don't try to put it on if you do it won't work but if you really get such a love in your heart for his soul he will know it don't you worry the husband is Sanctified by the believing wife vice versa you can't fool it you can't Bluff it it's got to really be there that's the reason we're genuine Faith people sometimes think they got faith when they haven't got it you've got to really have it I've seen thata same conquering power conquer faith and love together can conquer the the atmosphere in your home and change things so that the unbelieving family members start to get convicted the message love he said now the only thing you have to change the situation if that can be done in the home it can be done in a church it can be done in a nation it can be done in the whole world it's the atmosphere that counts the natural way to hatch an egg is put it under a hen because she keeps it warm but put it under the same kind of a heat and it'll hatch anyhow it's the atmosphere that counts that's right so it's the atmosphere and you make up that atmosphere with what you are inside of you Sanctified s i I've got this picture of of a cup that's dirty and it's in the dishwasher but it's got another cup with it and and now that's what happens when you got a Sanctified spouse that they they they're they're bring they're kind of dragging everybody along with them into that atmosphere I ain't dressing like that and my kids ain't dressing like that I I I'm not listening to that kind of music and my kids ain't listening to that kind of music and and you're living by a holy ghost standard and then that standard begins to trickle out into the rest of your life and because you're washed it begins to cause the other around you to have a a a a a have be influenced by your Sanctified condition like look at this picture of this this this this believing spouse that's maybe her husband behind her don't believe but yeah he sees her reading the Bible every day he's got to come home and from work and he sees his wife reading the Bible and and living a Christian Life and maybe it doesn't have any impact at first but over time it starts to have an impact on him on the way he's looking at things and he says else were your children unclean but now are they holy now he he's not saying that their children are not considered spiritually unclean or a disadvantaged because one parent does not believe they have he's saying they have full acceptance within the church having every spiritual opportunity to know God and be taught his truth what he's not saying is that there are automatically saved or that they they they don't need their own personal salvation but what he's saying is that because just like Timothy that his mama believed and his Grandmama believed and and now he he he had he had that special Advantage where he was able to to hear the word and so forth and questions and answers brother said my husband somebody said somebody asked him my husband and I don't see alike on the Bible the truth like this truth that you preach he doesn't understand should I go with them to churches when I don't believe they're teaching I'm very troubled about this yes if you're a wife to this husband and he don't condemn you you don't you mustn't condemn him see because the husband is Sanctified by the wife and I believe if he goes to some denominational church or something like that he wants you to go down there with him you see if you don't see there's nothing there can harm you because you're not going to listen to what they're saying anyhow cuz you'd done said here you don't believe they're preaching see so it ain't going to harm you but you're just showing respects to your husband you're yielding yourself to him now now I want to call this quote out if you ever just kind of look at the difference between a man and a woman a woman always she wants love she just wants love but a man wants respect that's the one thing that a man wants he wants his children to respect him he wants his wife to respect him now look what he's how he's framing this up and he frames this up the same way that Paul does the scripture always says wives on honor your husband respect your husband so forth cuz that's what a man wants so he's saying just respect your husband and maybe you'll win him over you're you're constantly running running him down and and you go out to eat and you're just trash talking him and that's that's not respecting your husband but but if you if you honor your husband even if he don't believe quite right but respect your husband and then maybe you can win him and we'll we'll close on this scripture but if the unbelieving depart let him depart a brother or sister is not under bondage in such cases but God has caused us to peace the musicians can come forward somebody said somebody asked the same question in brother BR he said go with your husband but don't be partakers of what they're doing see you're supposed to love your husband and love is what does it you just be real salty he'll get thirsty if there's anything in him don't join their denomination that's the way you'll win your husband by doing that but don't be arrogant then he'll know he's got just as much as you have but when you can show something that you have that he don't have that'll make him thirst To Be Like You the Sanctified wife sanctifies the husband to think that a life lived by the gospel can change the atmosphere can change the situation so much that it can make people want what you've got the Sanctified spouse sanctifies the other God bless you Saints [Applause] [Music]
