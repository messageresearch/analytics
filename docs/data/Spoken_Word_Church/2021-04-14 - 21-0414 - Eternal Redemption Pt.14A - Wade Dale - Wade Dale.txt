open the eyes of my heart to see [Music] open the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you i want to see the eyes of my heart lord open the eyes of my heart i want to see you [Music] to see [Music] pour out your power in love as we sing holy [Music] shining in the light of your [Music] holy holy holy [Music] thank you lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] hey man good to be in the house with the lord good to be here on a good wednesday night we uh you know i was thinking today we it's a sad time but it's a glorious time and i found this quote i want to read it to you for you know brother brown i tried to find the quote maybe somebody can find it where brother brian said somebody you know will meet you across the river because you've never been that way before and it's a dark place listen to this 1950 brother brown life story said one morning the doctor will probably leave the room saying there's nothing else can be done loved ones will be standing and ringing their hands crying the cold vapors of death floating over the bedside cold chilly winds of death sweeping their pulse coming up your sleeve then breaking through the mist will come that old ship of zion the morning star will come down in the valley of death and light it up they'll see two glossy wings of the holy ghost reach across the jordan and say come on you blessed of my father i seen you that day in that little old tent meeting down there in cleveland tennessee cleveland ohio when you came and you accepted me said now i'm accepting you that makes feel good oh yeah there's a big question mark but to have the morning star come down to the valley of death and light it up for you the bible says in psalms 116 it says precious in the sight of the lord is the death of his saints we get it but we get it so backwards because we we cry to death and we we rejoice at a birth but the bible tells us in ecclesiastes 7 1 says a good name is better than precious ointment and the day of death than the day of one's birth so we get it kind of backwards so we're sad for the family we know that's for sure but we know one thing's for sure i'll promise you he got met on the river brother dick was standing right there because brother dick died about a year ago he was standing right there he said come on brother ray i know where to go you know brother dick he doesn't scope to everything out probably he said couldn't find no chick-fil-a over here but uh but he said come on brother ray i know what to do he said brother tatum met me then you just keep going down the string of the different ones that met you and on this side that you'll meet on the other side because as i was reading before and i think i may read it again today where brother brown says your your spirit is familiar there it's not familiar in the fifth dimension listen our our soul is not even familiar with this down here amen that's why we're striving to get there or bring them here so we can go in a rapture and we can take a a flight over into another dimension and then you know what they're going to continue to beat each other up on this side until we come back in the millennium but i thought those that was a wonderful quote he said the two glossy wings of the holy spirit will reach across jordan if you don't have the holy ghost though none of that will happen right you'll be thrown over in the dungeon of the fifth dimension and they ain't gonna ain't nobody gonna be there to care how you feel but boy before the foundation of the world god set this plan up that when the saint did go home he had everything prepared and ready for him so thank god for that amen that's the god we serve that's not a god that says oops i'm sorry you're in the wrong place or no he knew exactly what day he knew exactly what hour he knew exactly what time he that brother ray needed to go home he was his journey was done it was finished and he didn't need to be here anymore because god saw that he was finished but we do pray for the family of brother ray and also this sunday there will be a love offering taken for brother ray and his family um to help with some of the funeral expenses so uh so get your cookie jars out and bring some money for brother ray's family amen so we'll do that this sunday i love offering for the family also uh brother bob we'll be preaching next sunday next wednesday wednesday all right you got that on the calendar so i'm going right now i like that calendar who's every idea that was a good idea thank you we're going to postpone sunday school until may the 9th for those of you sister rachel's going to be gone since the monica's going to be gone so i don't want substitutes to start the first day of the things so we'll start on may the 9th which will be the second sunday in may we'll start back with our sunday school class now we have everything situated pretty much for the children to the young adults but my sunday school class we're still going to have to do some work because it'll be really crowded in there if if most people come that have come before okay so we're going to do that also remember june the 17th 18th 19th will be the father's week day trip for all of us fathers brother chris long brother ronnie long will be with us and then on july the 3rd and 4th we'll have our 50th anniversary here at the church brother juleforney will be preaching saturday night and um then brother michael oltek will be doing sunday morning service then we'll have a dinner cater dinner after that right okay so just remember that keeping you you said that's a long way off it's almo it's april middle of april middle of april let's go ahead and give brother dale a hand clap because his birthday is friday we don't want to do it after we won't do it before amen be 81 years young thank god for that amen all right i think that's it um and then we'll have cake and ice cream after sunday service for that so keep those things in your heart wheel there's not an announcement for brother ray's anything at the moment but uh sister mary never gonna be here for a few weeks so um they're going to uh make those pretty soon and we'll let you know so if you got your bibles let's go ahead and turn to hebrews again hebrews 9 and continue on and then um there's still something in that sixth dimension that i'm i'm running around going around i'm going around horrible somewhere because i can't get i can't get it right so we'll we'll we'll stab at it until we do we'll kill somebody we'll kill a height until we get this thing done all right so let's pray before we get started dear lord thank you for this day you've given us being lord a little bit of sadness in our heart for our brother ray lord knowing that that pew will be empty there along with brother dick right here up front lord and being wonderful cheerleaders but lord we've only lost him for a moment because you've got him over there on the other side that young man running down through the hills of glory through that sixth dimension praising god with all the other saints that are there waiting on us to come to a place father may we come to that place be with us and lead us and guide us by your holy spirit and may the day lord hasten that we are able to see them again lord not ever to be old again not ever to have an ache or a pain not have to worry about this that or the other but lord would just walk down through the streets of glory father for an eternity but lord we've got work to do on this side we've got to fight a battle we've got to take this kingdom by force you told us while you're here and we got to press the battle fight as hard as we can we'll lose a soldier here or there but we are already victorious we've already won the war we just got a few battles that we need to fight father forgive us of our sins bless this day lord you be the active participant in this service be the ones that are not here lord the ones that are sick you know who they are the ones that are sin sick father we pray that you speak to the heart today lord not a lot of time left father for us to be playing around lord we need to get in or get out father we ask you blessings in jesus name amen hebrews 9 verse 11 but christ being coming high priest of good things to come by a greater more perfect tabernacle not made with hands that is to say not of this building neither by the blood of goats and calves but by his own blood he entered in once into the holy place having obtained eternal redemption for us and let's read first john 4 this is where we're going to get to a little bit later and we have known now this is john little john's this is all john's already back from patmos he's already seen the antichrist he's already seen the bride taken up in the glory he's already seen the future home come down so they ain't nothing but love in this old man's heart he's probably in his 90s by now he's lived his life and listened to what he says and we have known and believed the love that god hath to us god is love he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in god and god in him herein is our love made perfect now now listen that has nothing to do with filial love that has nothing to do with the love you have on this earth nothing remember that love is the love of god that is agape love that is the baptism of the holy ghost that is the new birth in your soul that is loving god i'll read a quote here in a little while you can't love with this thing you can't love god with any of this amen all right hearing is our love made perfect that we may have boldness in the day of judgment because as he is so are we in this world who is the he jesus christ so heirs and joint heirs he overcame on this earth you and i he didn't overcome in heaven he overcome on earth amen sure he overcomes michael the prince but as jesus christ our savior our joint heir our our boaz he overcame down here amen for me and you there is no love no fear in love but perfect love casteth out fear because fear hath torment he that feareth is not made perfect in love we love him because he first loved us that's agape love that is not filial love if a man say i love god now watch and hateth his brother he is a liar that cuts it right there for he that loveth not his brother whom he hath seen how can he love god whom he hath not seen you may be seated in the lord at his blessing to the reading the word but we're going to continue in background just for some of the new ones some of the ones that have been here we're going to go back to and see that read ephesians 1 verse 1. i hope you're not getting tired of this because i'm going to read ephesians 1 all day long and keep reading it all over again amen because of what is in it it's the eternal word of god and if you can't stand to read it then that spirit that you got in you ain't going to the other side well it may go the other side but it's not going where brother raised that right according as he has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world so now listen like i said before according to god's mind this thing is set dried and done it is predetermined but not that he pulled you through a tube he predetermined because he foresaw by foreknowledge and we're going to read that here in just a minute because the accordionist has chosen us in him before the foundation of the world what he saw us look he saw us holy and without blame before him in agape not filio amen right right here in in agape not in filio right a lot of love that we have for god that people in this world have for god is filial love because if they don't have the new birth they can't love god without the new birth you can't you love everything else but you cannot love god without the baptism of holy ghost you cannot love god you don't know how to that love is different than feeling your love because filio love will take you to lust which will take you you notice i was thinking about this yesterday and i think i was telling some of the brothers we look and we see people leaving the message and and we see people that are now condemning the message and we we see people that are questioning the message questioning questioning the message leaving the message i told the brothers and i hope you agree with me and i'm not i'm not raising this church up to any i'm just telling you what god's done when you have good solid teaching that will not sit in a congregation that thing will leave but now you can shout and you can love god with your whoo with your feelings and your emotions and you can be in love with him but what brother brown say you're doing you're actually in love with the devil am i right because the bible says he'll give them a strong delusion and let them believe a lie but you take any church and any preacher that's been a strong teacher and had a strong teaching ministry and had ministers that come in that have a good strong teaching ministry you don't see splits in the church you oh sure we got problems we're family but not the problems like others like questioning marriage and divorce questioning the seals questioning the daniel 70 weeks questioning whether the cloud was there or not there but with good solid teaching you can rest assured on one thing you've got agape love and that agape love is going to have to coincide with the word amen because feel your love will take you off every time why you look at and and you be careful i'm telling ministers too we need to all be careful why do brother brown say money women in popularity was the three things the minister had to watch out for money stimulation women and popularity now that has nothing to do with god right but you watch and be careful because you don't want to ever get yourself because you have an anointing on you ministers because that's what we're doing we're taking a female bride and we're making love to a female bride in spirituality bringing them to the head church i mean the head person the head of the church christ not to ourself to christ but if you don't if you have filial love instead of agape love where is it going to take you it's going to take you downward to that lust and then filth and all that that brother adam will talk about in a minute so be so be careful even with the holy ghost listen you can be deceived but listen you won't be to stay long if you're under a good teaching ministry or you hear a good teacher or you hear some a good sermon from somebody that strikes to your heart but if you just love with just regophilio love anything like brother dale says you you get him i told brother chris about this and he really eat a laugh brother dale said you get them in with a cheeseburger you can get them out with a hot dog in other words if you can gather people in and feed them and then the next guy can feed him and he'll they'll go to the next church you understand what i mean but if you'll feed them the sincere milk of the word to begin with and then you feed them some meat they'll either choke on it and leave or they'll learn to eat right brother louise where'd louise had he's in the back louise yep amen and right he'll he'll testify to that you just got to sit here long enough to be able to get some teeth so you can chew on it instead of choking on it amen but listen but this message the mandate of this message is not us to stay babies the reason we've been here 50 or 60 years is is because there are so many questions there are so many babies there are so many milk drinkers people that need an emotion that needs somebody to shout that needs somebody they need they need needy people have filial love not agape love because you get everything you need from this word right here you get everything from the teaching of this word in a reading of your bible and doing your daily devotion that's where you get fed from i didn't know i was going this way but we're heading in that direction because feel your love listen feeling your love has to go backwards it can't go forward when you go from filial love when you get to agape love you you got to love god and you can't go back the other way that's right now that doesn't mean you can't love your wife and love your family and love but listen if they're not believers that's why the bible says two can't walk unless they agree agape love and feel your love will walk certain way but somewhere that's got to separate got to unless they both get agape love and then when you both get agape love then you can have agape love and superfilial love because you know how to love if you get the love of god see what i mean i'm gonna have ephesians and we're still preaching on something a little different i love ephesians but listen it's a requirement for us to study it's a requirement for us to know these things we've been around the message like i said before we got every message in a little piece like an mp3 player that you can put like in your pocket there's no excuse for you to not to listen there's no excuse for you not to listen to to archive messages and all the different things that that you're what you're privileged to have and not only here not really not only here but this is my home church so this is where i get that's where my roots are so this is where my tree gets fed amen having predestinated us into the adoption see we're we got to come to adoption speaking terms speaking where we can speak the prophet said and it will happen glory having predestinated us unto that he predestinated a group of people to come to adoption that god can use you that you can drive the car that you can even now you can as we're going to look at in just a minute if we get to it you can fly an airplane then now listen and we'll read it in just a minute but think about this think about how we should have we should have come up in this message of the hour horse and buggy oh yeah dad and i go to kentucky to preach for brother byler or some of them and they've got a huge amish um huge i mean they've even got a lane for the because you can see the results of the of the horses down the lane but they're i mean they're heading to church at 25 miles an hour well they're still in that part but you know what we go buy them at 65 miles an hour and we get to church faster than they do but then guess what it's like i said about chuck yeager you go to an airplane it's different from driving a car you can't just get in an airplane and drive an airplane what a disaster but now you can drive a car right if you want to drive a race car if sterling was here you tell you you got to have a lot more coordination you got to have a lot quicker reflexes you got to have a lot because you're what you're running at a higher speed now what about an astronaut though so he's got this great big i think about the other day that big old seven whatever it was that i took to the philippines that thing was way bigger than this building with the wingspan and everything and i thought one man is driving that thing he's got the controls now there's other you know he's got a co-pilot and he's got an alligator but there's one dude up there with that stick in his hand he's got 400 people behind him with about 8 000 gallons of fuel two engines well that one had four or four inches you know what i'm saying but he wasn't nervous i hope well i got over there and back so he must have knew what he was talking about you know why because he had been trained because he said he said okay i'm going to be a pilot right so he took the required courses to be a pilot he was able to get into the seals he was able to get into the doctrines that we're supposed to be getting into because without the opening of the seals you're going to see without the opening of the seals you can't get this message sorry right you might get part but the full adoption has to be the open book it has to be the opening of the seals it has to be you understand that this seal means this and this seal means this but you take that guy flying that great big airplane but now look you wouldn't want to pick him up and just set him over into a a saturn rocket and say look go for it buddy same thing go fly uh-uh be a disaster what those pi those those astronauts sure they're they're pilots most of them are they start as pilots but when they become a pilot they got to take two or three more years training before they're an astronaut what am i saying we are in the astronaut age we're not in even the airplane age we're in the astronaut age we're supposed to be able to handle this 50 000 pound you know 200 feet tall rocket one person driving it that's the same way with the message of the hour we have no excuse we have no excuse to just sit here with that wilder bewildered look on our face maybe you ought to get a gothic love listen if you have agape love god will not allow you to just sit there and die if you have any effort at all he's got to respond to the word that's being preached but if you don't have agape love you've just got feeling all that well i just love to go to church they're just such good people that's all right that's got part to do with it but is there love of god there then the love of god is not just oh lovey-dovey i let's love everybody and i'll hug him and kiss him love is corrective love has to be strong love has to be love love has a judge involved hello somebody love has a judge involved a lot of times when we go into a natural courtroom you think they know love in that courtroom they're screaming and hollering at each other and calling each other names and the judge is just sitting there and he's got to decide which one's right we've got a righteous judge remember the prophet of god said how do we lose we walk into the courtroom the judge is our father the prosecuting attorney is our father the defense attorney's our father and the jury's our father how are we going to lose but that's if you got agape love not filial love god does not have to respond to filial love the devil can respond to filial love but you know what the devil can't respond to agape love because he don't know what it is that's why brother branham says he said he said you got satan's answer you've got something he cannot have he never can possess it he can imitate it to a degree but like i said before if you preach the word line by line word by word some emotion that's okay and some feeling that's okay but if you lay that word down word by word he cannot argue that oh yeah he can argue under filial love but he doesn't have any agape love to argue with if you argue then it's filio and agape and arguing with each other you know i wish people would see that get the holy ghost it'll change your life having predestinated us into the adoption of children by jesus christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will to the praise of the glory of his grace wherein he hath made us accepted in the beloved that's agape love to the praise of the glory of his grace we're not to made us accepted in the beloved in whom we have redemption through his blood the forgiveness of sins according to the riches of his grace wherein he has abounded toward us he heats it on top of us in all wisdom and prudence i'll read to you in just a minute watch what is the mystery of his will brother dale's preaching on is to adopt us because they can't understand that now in the natural we have adoption in the natural which is a close type but in the jewish adoption which is called bar mitzvah it's the sun that's already born the sun so you gotta have the agape love because that puts you in the family all right so that's why you receive the spirit of adoption where you cry of a father you receive the spirit of adoption which can take you to adoption but you can either say i don't want it or not or do like brother brown said he said the holy ghost goes back and said your son is acting up your son's not doing the right thing your son's not doing this your son's not your daughter's not doing that that's the holy ghost going back to the father but in a natural in a bar mitzvah what happens is the kid the child comes to a certain age like 12 or 13 years old and he's able to read in the temple he's able to go into the temple read scripture out of the temple and be able to do certain things that he was not able to do because he had come to a certain place that the father said i'm pleased with that he can do what we have required him to do because bar mitzvah means son of promise bar means son remember simon barjona son of jonah so this is the son of the promise what's the promise listen the promise was to israel you're my people you're i am going to adopt you and they were and they were going to do that in a natural they do it in a natural sense but they never came to adoption in a spiritual sense because god had to put them away you and i come to adoption by coming into the family and then the holy ghost saying hey he's got that virtue down pretty good or he's got some work on that knowledge and temperance and patience but you know what it's required in this age for us to go up that statue of a perfect man so as as dad said before it's not a it's not a i was thinking about this while he was preaching it you know when you go to college even when you go to high school but mostly in college if you're going to be a a doctor or you're going to be a lawyer or you're just going to be a get a bachelor or you're going to get an associate's degree there are certain classes that you have and required to take right right anna required then you have electives or fill-ins that really doesn't have a lot to do with your with your degree but if you're going to go to school you got to learn this certain thing over here right well see that's the way with us we've got there's certain requirements that me and you have to have in this end time there is requirements adoption is a requirement now elective could be the seven spiritual gifts speaking in tongues and all these see that's electives because listen you might not ever speak in your tongues the day of your life but you're still a child of god you're still born again so that's an elective course that you can take if you want to but the main course of this is is that god needs somebody to yield their self to him enough to where he cannot just speak to but through amen not just two it's good for god to speak to you but if we're elected for god to speak through us then listen it's got to happen because on romans 8 28 saying we know that all things work together for good to them that love god to them who are they called according to his purpose for whom he did for know he also did predestinate so he foreknew a group of people he knows who they are because they come from the mind of god and we'll get to this in just a minute remember that genesis 1 26 man came from the seventh dimension god alone remember god's the only one up there you say well now he's a pay attention genesis 1 26 man wasn't formed down here on the earth it was formed in the mind of god in glory in a dimension that that that adam could move and have no limitations at all right but then we had to be put in the first three dimensions because god knew we were going to fall he knew when we got put in flesh that we were going to fall but remember what's it going to come back to that genesis 1 26 man is standing on earth today amen just like it was in the garden of eden just like it was in the garden of eden now you got to decide whether you're going to be born of his bone in flesh of his flesh because that eve's part of it too remember eve's the bride for whom he didn't know he also for no he also did predestinate to what look to be conformed to the image of his son so you were conformed or you were formed in the womb of of your mother but you had to be conformed a lot of us had to be reformed i don't believe in reformation i mean reformed you know reshaped into what the image of his son listen if you got the new birth you're into the image of that genesis 1 26 man which is the children of god the family of god god is your daddy so you've got that genetic makeup but now look but when he put that sixth dimension in place he knew that's who would go there and he set that place up now seventh dimension he's already up here but now where are you and i gonna go we'll read it we're gonna come back if if br you know brother ray and brother dick and brother tatum all the different ones brother richard marlow they're over there waiting on us now listen according to my bible according to the prophet's message they don't eat over here they tell they we don't eat over here right don't drink don't eat we're just it's just kind of a blissful place but that's got to come back here so they can pick up their body connected back to the earth that god cursed that kookaburra is going to be laying in the ground but when that transforming power of god sheds that away but when they come back and pick up their body it's not going to be a cuckleberry anymore it's going to be wheat germ but remember you and i have another commission we have a win over there we're standing right here this cuckoo bird is going to be changed into a wheat body spirit and soul somebody is going to happen here in this dimension because this will be a live message of resurrection and remember we're not looking for a rapture i'm looking for a resurrection because the resurrection the bible says we which are alive and remain they will be they will be uh brought up first then we which are alive and remain to be changed and caught up to meet them and yeah we got to get them here first before there's a rapture i i don't you know you can you can look for rapture if you want to but there's about three of them which one which one you want to be a part of right i want to be a part of the one where i don't have to be i want to be changed in a moment in 2011 on this side that's a requirement for somebody somebody's got to reach that spot abraham doesn't matter how old you are you say boy i think zach will probably one of them that takes a body chain because he's just 20. shut up 21. i got shoes older than you 21 that's what we're coming back to but you know we think that we go man if we were standing in the bible and we were going all right who who's going to take the body change why there'd be the young people over there no that'd be easy but what about somebody like brother boyd or myself or dad and somebody like that and you go man nah they too old was abraham too old he was 99 ain't none of us got close to that yet when he was changed but i hope you get this tonight that's a requirement we have requirements we have we have electives that we can do and we can we can have the peripherals around the message and all these different things but while and i don't say waste our time on it because the gifts are not wasted but why would you jump over here though and take 12 elective courses and never take your required courses right you never graduate hey man does everybody get my analogy you'll never graduate if you stand over here and say no i'm going to take basketball knitting weaving i'm going to take book reading and and and and cartoon drawing and i'll make it i'll become a doctor doctor of what but that guy that sits over here and says man i got to take biology 101 102 103. i got to take anatomy i got to take i got a i got to cut a cadaver open and i gotta look inside this human body and make sure that i don't fall asleep or fall just fall you understand what i mean i think we've what brother brown has always said though we've majored on the minor is that not quote we've majored on the minor everybody likes to go to these meetings and have these good old feelings and jumping up and down which that's fine but what are you going to do when you come back over here and you got to take your normal courses that's okay you can take the electives all you want to but don't stay over here and say this is it i'll be a doctor of crayons and coloring books no if you're going to be a doctor you need to learn how to use knives and forceps and all them other different things same way with the gospel we need to get in this thing and like i said before we need to let what we got out listen even if you're not born again you definitely need to let out what you got inside of you amen and listen there's a lot of letting out to do with these remember the doors indoors you open the door and let the bat out you open the door and let the whatever's bothering you out we've got to start doing that if we don't do that we're going to stay here we're going to keep doing funerals you say how brother wait keep listen how do you eat an elephant one bite at a time that elephant of death we just keep on knowing at him just keep on chewing at him but by foreign knowledge he predestinated us to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren whom moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called whom he called he justified whom he justified them he also glorified and the rest of the scripture says how in the world can we lose if god be for us who can be against us amen so let's not worry about any of that okay now let's look for the dimensions just for a second we'll we'll cut this a little short because we know one thing's for sure we read this quote 20 times but look how can i take a huckleberry and make a grain of wheat out of it it's impossible the only way it can do is because the inside has been transmitted from a cuckoo bird wheat a cucumber to a germ called wheat life now we know what that is that's the baptism of the holy ghost that's the agape love that we must have to carry on our christian experience do you know most of the christian world is deceived sorry most of the christian world is deceived believing a lie and the bible says we'll be down by it and that includes many in this message now i don't mean new birth you got the new birth but now some people can be deceived if you stay in a deception that's the whole problem watch you watch this that's why god has let this thing go so long 50 60 years after the prophet preached us into a future home we're still here we're still dying we're still wondering whether i was thinking you know i read this quote again where brother brown was talking about going across the curtain of time he said with my hand on the bible i'll meet you at the day of judgment he said this is what happened now what about these people that are denying that brother brown's even a prophet anymore denying that he brought us a message you know he was wrong here and he was wrong there well i agree with him if he was wrong there he's wrong everywhere but he wasn't how can a man stand behind this desk you see what them people are doing when they deny the prophet of god in this end time they deny everything he ever said i'll he said i'll meet you at the day of judgment exactly he said how many times have i told you something and it come to pass too big of a witness folks for me to be deceived in that part i might be deceived somewhere else but i'm not going to be steven on that part when he went across that curtain of time i believe that man went across the curtain of time now why did god take him over there if he was a liar remember what brother brown said he said he said i can't say nothing until he's here he said cause i may you may ask me something one time and he said i may get it wrong and he said you would lose confidence in me then well how many millions of the time was it right how many times was it wrong zero wrong millions of times right okay i'll take that i'll rest my soul that jesus christ saved my soul but i'll rest my statue of a perfect man on that man bringing me a message that i can take a body change without death that's what he brought me he brought me to a place that you know what he done all them denominations started looking at the electives cabbage down what they cabbage down on electives they cabbage down on the minor stuff if they would have said okay this is the holy ghost this is the beginning and then carried on but that wasn't their message their message was to stop the message brother branham was trying to get them and bring them over here say look there's more sure that's elected but if you're going to be an astronaut you can't sit over there and play with tonka toys right or weave them legos it's nice hey don't laugh i've seen some beautiful things made out of legos but try to get anyone to fly out of the universe with it that's what we've been doing though we've been listening to kids putting legos together and saying i think we fly this thing out of here and then missing the real astronaut the true message of the hour where brother brown has brought us a message that cannot be denied it can sure it can be you can question anything they questioned jesus thought he was a devil said he hung around too much with sinners and prostitutes and he was a wine bibber boy he had a good testimony didn't he but look who was doing that though it was the devil in those people that was doing that amen so anyway that sweet life so light timing matters the first three dimensions we're going to skip through this real quick fourth dimension we know that was science but i want you to read let's read that one more time and questions and answers number two quote if you don't mind uh brothers number two two quote right past there you go because look why did he come on the seals we've been over this again and again and again why did he come up to the seals he come up to the sixth after the sixth seal he comes up to questions and answers six seals has opened he's getting ready to preach the seventh seal he says we're gonna have questions and answers and then they don't get it all right don't try to make yourself odd to be a christian because you see you take yourself away from god if you can understand it this is that third pull now what is the third pull the third pull is the opening of the word the third pull is going into a higher realm that brother brown said he cannot be impostered it can't be mimicked he said it's god alone that third pull is not to the devil it's to god's children because it's the opening of the word which the devil could follow the first two the devil could follow those first two and imitate the first two the hand and the telling of the things but now that third pull when he moved into that he said look you should have caught that the other day so they didn't catch it you remember there'll be no impersonation like there was of the other two see so that's as far as you should know now just remember that you see now there's something taking place in this room and there's something here there's actually in this room angels voice of god but how do you you can't if you can't hear the natural voice without something to send it out he's talking about radio how can you how are you going to hear the spiritual voice now listen to this now you might make believe look that somebody's singing this certain song and that's what the problem is there's been a lot of make-believe preaching doctrines that's not even right that's make-believe that's not true belief right he's coming back on a horse he's coming back on the cloud he's got to shoot a black bear he's got lord of mercy come on people get some spirituality about you brother branham will come back into this dimension but it's when somebody on this side will come to a place of full adoption and god will have to honor what they're saying just like when jesus stood and said lazarus come forth brother brown said to the same loud voice that brought lazarus from the dead is in me and you today oh glory so are we looking for a resurrection are we looking at the resurrection amen now look now you might make believe that somebody is singing this certain song that might not even be there see but when it actually strikes the crystal that is supposed to strike what's he saying the crystal's not there in 1963 whatever 3 24 1963 those people that were sitting in that room now he didn't call them not christians he didn't say they weren't christians he said you're not getting what i'm preaching amen but when it actually strikes the crystal that it's supposed to strike then it gives a true interpretation and vindicates it by showing the picture see what i mean now the spirit of god when it speaks to the true word it vindicates itself to show itself that it's right right so now we now have the right crystal here we now have the right diamond cut right now today in this building and around the world we have the right crystal because he said when it strikes that crystal so it's got to strike something what strikes it the voice the vibration coming from god it strikes that crystal and then it what it vindicates it by showing the picture in other words it vindicates it by opening the bride up so everybody can see who she is everybody got them so to me that's another thing you know they stayed an elective they stayed with the shout and they're speaking in tongues and then when brother brown left the scene they said oh he was right in his when he was shouting and speaking in tongues and healing the sick and raising the dead but when he was preaching his doctrine when he was teaching you how to be a doctor and you were over here saying no that's not right over there why because it it was against what their curriculum everybody got what i'm saying they forgot the curriculum right the curriculum is to be a doctor you got to have and i think they even give you an outline don't they know they give you an outline if you want to be a if you want to be whatever this is what you got to take and for four years or six years you've got to take this right here to be whatever you want to be so there's a requirement when brother brown opened the seals there was our requirement we are required to live under an open book we are required to hear brother brown said we are now what messiahs we are now little eagles we are now we live off revelation we don't live off presumption we don't live off like he said here now you might make believe that somebody's singing this certain song that's what a false doctrine is it's just make-believe some certain song right god didn't bring that if it's false never has god brought a false revelation so if you hear false revelation it's not of god get out of that college the curriculum is wrong right so the fifth dimension we know what happened the brother brown looked in the fifth dimension where the center goes and remember it's not a burning hell brother luis covered that real good wednesday it's not a burning hell it's the place that you're put there and then then as we contend and i don't think it's presumption that they don't get a body change why would they get a body change and be back young again and they they didn't even believe in god and they didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost all happened was is their old dirty soul just moved over into a fifth dimension and i don't believe nobody helped them across either they probably drug them across but could you imagine though look at the sincerity though i want to stop right here in just a second you take those people that are muslims that kill their self for their religion and they want to kill as many as they can with them but they are guaranteed 72 virgins when they get into this dimension over here because see they believe in afterlife i hope they do because that's what they believe and then you've got you know anyway so anyway you got a pope that is the viker of god right supposedly when when they vote him in that that god that that the lord jesus moves into the pope and he's the viker he's the spokesman he's the one that you got to listen to right that's what right i mean come on reach study the catholic church if you really study that that supposedly that spirit moves into that pope well there's one moves into him all right now he thinks he's the vice he thinks he's a spokesman of god so when he dies he obviously must be going to go over here into a place i don't know if popes go to purgatory or not i don't know if they get a free bypass or what they get a free pass i don't know but i'm you'll see why silly it is but can you imagine as soon as that muslim why am i saying this because you better lay your soul on something too he's laid his soul that when he pulls that switch and he gets blown into a million pieces and he blows up whoever else who radical person they are that when he steps over into his sixth dimension there's going to be 72 virgins palm trees and grapes for an eternity what a surprise he's gonna get what a surprise the pope's gonna get when he steps across the curtain of time and there's no purgatory there there's no place to pray them out of right because that's what they believe they believe that you go to a place of holding then they can either pray you out or you pay enough money to get you on into whatever they call their sixth dimension but see that's all presumption we've had a prophet go beyond the curtain of time said he had been to hell said he had been to heaven i believe he was in both places because he come back and showed it because he was an astronaut he came and show it to me and you so that number one you can take the fear away that even if something does happen we fall dead of a heart attack or anything happens to us that we know that across the curtain of time number one you're not going to want to come back i would assume i'm assuming here that them 72 virgin people and all them pope they want to get back here because they know they did something wrong this way but now brother ray is over there now i know he loves it to cathy and he loves his kids but there's no way he'd want to come back and there's no way we want him to come back before his time but he knows though he's coming back amen because we can read the bible we can see it in the bible and we can see it in the prophet's message that we have an assurity that we don't have just a hope i know the bible uses hope and faith together but i just i hope grandma made it i hope brother ray made it i hope you know if your hope's wrong where there's only two places to go right but we have an assurity the sixth dimension is christ let's go to the sixth dimension um number five please the saints dead saints or look he changed that he said dead saints or resting saints because remember death's been destroyed for a christian death has been destroyed there is no death brother ray didn't die he left his body and his body quit breathing and the cells that had all that firing mechanism that made him 98.6 degrees you know that's what your theophany is doing hello somebody your theophany is keeping your body at 98.6 degrees or 96.8 whatever it is 98.6 because when your theophany leaves your body it goes cold it's your firing mechanism listen even as a sinner you got a theophany everybody's got a theophany a soul everybody's got a soul and that soul is either going to go to one place or the other and brother brown said you know he's talking about paradise and all the different places we'll read in just a minute it's what you're familiar with it's where your soul is going to go see brother branham went into the fifth dimension now in a type he went into the fifth dimension not as a sin or dead but he went there and saw that place and he said horrible place don't want to go there do not touch the place but then when he goes into the sixth dimension he said leave me alone don't want to go back do i have to leave here but which place was he more familiar he saw them people in hell and he never recognized the one of them but when he stepped in that sixth dimension he said oh there's brother so-and-so there's my wife that died there's my baby there's my hey even his repossessed chair was there think of that but brother branham the the angel said everything you loved he loved that chair but remember it was only like goodness you read the read his life story it was only like what a dollar a month uh hope had bought it for him and was making payments on it a dollar a month and they couldn't make the payments that he walked in one day and it was gone they had repossessed it well he said i love that chair well guess what he's the chair was me the dog the horse and his chair you say well that was just for brother branham no no that's for all of us the resting saints look who is completely work finished on earth and has entered into rest with christ under the altar beautifully you can pillar it like a wonderful dream that you don't want to wake up from but now look he said it ain't a dream it's natural it's real you know brother ray is more real now than he than he was when we saw him for 80 years on the earth we got to we got to get rid of this thinking thinking our stinking thinking is all poor no man he's shouting on the hills he's 20 years old i want to see those pictures of him when he was he showed me a picture one time where character did when they got married the dapper little fella you know and that little dapper fella standing over there because the cuckoo bird's in the ground but they'll meet back up right we have a promise they'll meet right back up listen if brother brown if if brother brown looked at mita and she said brother said honey you've lost all your hair he said i ain't lost one every hair i ever had right because when he went back across the curtain time he said what did he do he put his hand that's the first thing he did he's like i'm bald-headed down here but he's like i got hair didn't lose the one brother that god got them all waiting on you there me there and everybody else you don't have to worry about it but amen 21 years old but remember you're from your your spirit is going to be familiar with one of them two places for what you are on this side you can't change it once you go and say no i think i'll jump over here or or go over here see that's what the lie of the devil is even in even in in the catholic church well if you get into this dimension we're going to pray and then all of a sudden you're going to wind up in this one come on people we know that's wrong but look it is deceiving about 50 of the population of this world they rest their soul on that that the pope is jesus christ incarnate and that they can go into this they can live like the devil why do you think listen why do you think that gangsters and the mafia are all catholic father forgive me i'm gonna kill seven people tomorrow right oh say three hail mary's and we'll spring some water on you if you get into purgatory we'll pray out you see what i mean that's religion though folks that's religion that's what religion will do for you too it'll lie to you that's right this is there's not one line this message there's not one line in this bible you live it god's got to do it he's got he's obligated to his word he's not obligated nothing else paradise member of the witch of endor brought up samuel we'll go to quote six and seven save time go to first samuel 28 we noticed it in verse 14 says an old man an old man came up so even in paradise they weren't changed like we're talking about changing in the sixth dimension they would they what happened was is they just they passed away and they moved over into another dimension like they were and then even you know you see in the old testament i'm reading in samuel the first and second samuel in the kings the angel keeps telling david said you'll be gathered with your people he says jacob you'll be gathered with your people well brother branham was gathered with his people glory we will if brother ray is gathered under brother brown's message he's not there with paul's group he's not there with irena's group he's not there with pentecost group he's there with the bride of this age under our prophet messenger he's moved into that dimension part that was made for him because you know why his spirit wouldn't be familiar in luther's age his spirit wouldn't be familiar in wesley's age wouldn't in pentecost although he may have come up through pentecost but his spirit was familiar and that's where his spirit went to where what the word and the word connected the word that brother brown gave us the word that we got that's what's pulling us to that dimension where he is because even the even the angel says you'll be gathered with your people he said branhams said no you're converts amen so look so it was an old man in paradise but not in the sixth dimension so let's continue on perfect love real quick everybody all right say ma'am present stage of my ministry number eight i believe i was caught up in the sixth dimension looking back down here and could see back see the side isn't exactly with the eyes that's earthly but sight is a greater than greater thing than the sight that they have there their contact is far beyond any contact that our natural senses would contact then number nine let's read them down a little further where it says what is this let's go scroll down up the voice is what this is perfect love said isn't that what you spoke the holy spirit was now look not perfect love filio perfect love agape love the love of god the love of jesus christ that was sown in the people's heart i said yes and this is perfect love and what did i say perfect love casts out fear and you read all those quotes about that we'll continue on kind of hurry through let's go to number 10. he explains this really well cause we know about he'll be gathered with your people everybody's read the where brother brown says the angel says you'll be gathered with your people and then you're gonna have to give an account and you're gonna have to come back here and pick up your body and and then uh that's another thing uh i see that some people run across we preached here for years there's people that believe in this message that you're number one you're going to get a new body totally different from this one and they also believe one preacher told me with his own mouth that the bible says that when you walk out on the ashes of the wicked that you're going to walk out in the millennium on your own ashes which means your body's not going to make it your body's going to be burnt up with the rest of the world because it was wicked he just don't know this thing don't sin it's that inside guy but we're gonna be connected with this body even that woman told him in the quote before that we don't have to go back to it but she said we got to go back look i'll read it don't go back there and she looked at me and said brother branham jesus will come sunday then we'll go back to earth then we'll receive our glorified body then we'll live together forever in other words you're going to come back down and pick up your body and it's going to be changed that's a miracle glory it's not a miracle to just come back and say i'm eternal no jesus didn't do that jesus was resurrected in the body that he died in but it was what made new i can't believe that people have not read the future home enough to read where the bible says and all all all denominations believe that this earth is going to be totally annihilated because of where it says heaven and earth will pass away remember brother i had to go back and tell you what that word pass away was it wasn't that it's going to be destroyed it's going to be burnt off so the framework of this earth is going to be right here where we're at now what are you a part of right somebody say it that's real weak you're gonna be a part of this art you're a part of the earth your body is the part of this earth glory amen but when god cursed the earth he cursed adam and cursed the earth we have to put that what we have to plant it in corruption but the bible says we'll raise it that body in incorruption to me that's a miracle to me that is the total plan of redemption that he can take your body that came the wrong way it came totally contrary he can take that same body and change it because of what's inside of you to me that's a miracle to me that's what the devil can't understand because he's looking at you going how can you do that i'm not worried about me doing it that thing inside of me is going to do it that's agape love all right when god can change your vile body the bible says philippians he'll change this what a miracle and change it back to 20 years old you got that right sister you where you get 61. you'll say a lot louder than that now look does everybody understand that listen there's certain things that you should know and that one thing you should know we're not going to walk out on our own ashes oh we're not going to get a brand new one it's this body made new just same as the earth is going to be burnt off this thing by the holy ghost you've already been burnt out inside he's just going to burn the rest of it off the first is perfect love that's god love god's love pure and unadulterated the next comes in there is feel your love that's love you have for your wife and your children the next drops that is lustful love now that we you see that in the world they're just doing all kind of stuff the next is ungodly love and just goes on down till it's filth just keep on perverting perverting and everything had a beginning though look had an end filial love had a beginning lust had a beginning filth had a beginning agape love did not have a beginning let's read that again what quote number am i on i've lost my place thank you 10. all right thank you and everything that had the beginning has an end and all that will be taken right away and no remembrance of it at all and come right back to the perfect someday and the only way listen adam and eve walked in the garden man and woman naked naked naked whatever you want to call it naked and they didn't bother my bed they had a holy ghost veil over their eyes that you and i supposed to have because that's our conversion it brings us back to agape love and takes us sure we still have to have filial love but that's not from that very inside guy that very inside guy is turned back to agape love to where adam and eve could walk in the in the cool of the day in the garden and be totally naked and be there together and not be sinful and not have any sinful thoughts or not have any emotion everybody understand what i'm saying and everything that had a beginning has an end and all that was taken right away and no remembrance of it at all comes right back to the perfect someday and the only way look you can't stop down here half of the way and get up here you've got to be all the way in look trusting resting completely in the salvation that jesus gave to you by faith look there's a spirit let me read that real slow there is a spirit of honesty that comes from god that's the fountain fountain of god that's honesty the next isn't the man will do a good deed for his neighbor feel your love the next is the guy you have to watch him the next is the guy he's a thief the next is the guy's a murderer hold up see how it perverts right on down but all them things speak of a reel now watch let's read this next one everybody all right wednesday night middle of the week look the achievement's been proved by science this is countdown they showed it out younger at the world's fair we got today man it's being proved everywhere astronaut age we're living in see it was made up of things which do not appear see it was made of something out of heaven it's god himself here in that sixth dimension it's the power of god we've seen we've been in such a place to we have been lifted up into that dimension he's talking about going across the curtain of time beyond this thing of going to the grave and weeping this thing of putting the crepe over the doorknob in other words the wreath and saying goodbye forever goodbye brother ray we don't know if we'll ever see you again no that's not what's going to happen we don't have a hope we'll see him we have an assurity that he is in the place that he connected with on this side amen hallelujah we done got in the astronaut sailed off yonder and seen where that is it's at and return back so listen folks listen if if the people are denying that they need to just go back into the world how can you get up into that how can you get the intelligence of an astronaut everybody got this and they said well no i'm going back to horse and buggy and then here comes an airplane flying by and you have no connection to that nope going back horse buggy no there's something pulling me to that from the horse and buggy to the automobile to the airplane to the astronaut where they can store in places that we've never been before and return back glory we're going to the home beyond the skyline to be on the reasoning of man how the old will be transformed in a moment of the twinkling of an eye we will see them there old men and women young again how do you know the bible teaches it look and god shot an astronaut up there we know what it's all about came back there's no worry about dying dying's nothing sure it's living yes sir it's just getting your feet off the ground so we can go oh how wonderful all right let's read this number 12. it's a little bit lengthy but we're going to read it and then we made it stop right there this is countdown look watch that happen now i've been preaching on this and i just want you to see the quote where i got it from justification the horse and buggy sanctification what was it automobile began to move along then the baptism in the holy ghost you took off the ground got your feet off got up in the air flying around in the heavenlies with heavenly gifts speaking in tongues divine healing now look he's talking about justification sanctification baptism holy ghost but he's talking about the the lutherans the westlands and the pentecostal the pentecostals did get their feet up off the ground the pentecostals did do the shouting they did do the speaking in tongues they did have the restoration of the gifts by the true baptism of the holy ghost but what happened they did just what i said they said this is it we can't go no higher this is airplanes as far as we can go right this is it but there was another group because there's a there's a star out you under that we need to get to and we can't do it in an airplane look them that was still in the automobile and still riding the horse and buggy thought that was the strangest thing they'd ever seen then people was having a fit but they got their feet off the ground god was able to bring the church his achievement when he got a bunch of people standing still long enough that he could pour his spirit into them the same horsepower that can pulse the horse did the same thing to the automobile and did the same thing to the airplane and the same holy ghost it brought justification to the church it brought more of it when it brought sanctification and poured it into the poured it in with the holy ghost still the same power right brought the same thing and took the church off its feet into the heavenlies now things has changed all together see i could have quit reading that quote right there and it just left you on an airplane amen they just put you on an airplane you say oh this is it it's great that's it nope he's not done yet thank god for a profit thank god for a profit now things has changed all together now look same horsepower same horsepower just more of it now things has changed all together because science is moving on and we're always talking about science but let's look back and see what our great scientific teachers are doing look what god's doing with his church scientific teachers now we've entered the age not no more of horse and buggy not no more of automobile now oh now brother i'm wait a minute now airplanes as far as we can go no not no more of airplane now there's astronauts oh my this is astronaut age oh what a great thing the horse in buggy was earthbound but now we are in astronaut age and so has the church that's the big swingover that i can't get before the people but we got the right crystal he wasn't talking to them he's talking to us that's the big thing over that i can't get before the people they've settled down for an airplane some of them settle for a horse and a buggy but god's got an astronaut age oh what an age to live in no wonder they can't understand it but you see where god lets man do something is to show the church that he's doing something see we're always trying to bring look now i'm going to read this and then we'll we'll close because we know what perfect love is i'm going to read one more on christ revealing his own word but let's go right here see they're always trying to bring the old thing back what i say horse and buggy i i can still see that horse and buggy over there you know it's a lot easier you don't have to change all you just got to feed the horse you understand what i'm saying going backwards though why would you want to go backwards right when the requirement is an astronaut see they're always trying to bring the whole thing back and now keep the horse and buggy it's just it's a relic oh my lord it's a relic it's history that was alright in this day but it's past that glory shake hands with the preacher was all right a long time ago but that's passed now denominations live this day out we're past that now we're in the astronaut age amen now i begin to feel religious astronaut age that's what's got the people all turned around they don't know what to think about these things they don't know how to get it notice yet the astronaut age is the same spirit they had same holy ghost baptized the lutherans westlands you understand now just like the horsepower was now in this astronaut age in the natural there's also the astronaut age and the spiritual what is it then the church from an airplane like the natural has took a higher flight while that astronaut there's no airplane going to catch him he's done gone to where he can't even see an airplane no more and that's the way god is doing now instead of being some little school guy come out and talk about a certain thing that dr so-and-so said years ago we got eagles prophets rising up in the heavenlies far above the earth-bound chicken thought only a kentuckian could say that a chicken thought but that's what it is we horse and buggy horse and buggy astronaut age look god's prove it god's proven it watch it let's watch it right here let's read this go to number 17. the last quote i want to read this right here christ revealed in his own word and then magicians get ready to come when they get finished that layout of cna's naked blind miserable don't even know it see it's out look it's that anointed anointed with the real spirit see that the holy spirit can fall upon a man in his spirit watch it now but his soul is his germ that german's word remember he he says that you can receive the baptism of holy ghost on your spirit every day of your life and die and go to hell that's what's happening to people right now because the third pull is what to the bride to the church and the totally lost we shout at the third polls for us but there's two other groups that you better watch out and you're not in that group amen the holy ghost can fall upon a man in his spirit but his soul is his germ that germ is the word and how i don't care how much you can preach how well you do this and how much you love look that's one of the inlets to the spirit right you can't love with your body you love with your spirit that's one of the inlets and you can love and even love god and still not be right you can love god with your spirit he didn't say soul listen your soul by the baptism of the holy ghost cannot produce filial love where where can it it's the love of god totally inside of you agape love you say well where do you love you love your spirit memory reason conscious affection imagination that makes me love my wife memory reasoning conscious affection affection that's not god's affection that's affection for your wife and then for your kids and then for your grandparents and all these different things you say oh my no you either love god with your soul or you love the devil there's no loving mom and daddy with your soul everybody got that it's one or the other you either love god or you love the devil you either got filial love on the outside got it outside realm spirit realm love god now that's not that love right there is not agape love that's filial love you can't love with agape love and be wrong because he is agape love you got agape love they got to come together but feel your love can't stand in front of agape love because with the white throne judgment those people that come to the white throne judgment they're going to stand in what they're going to be given account of what they do the works that they do filio works not agape works because agape works is going to be standing in judgment because it's the love of god they're going to have to give an account and they're feeling god i loved you i loved you i loved you remember what the bible says the bible says depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew k-n-e-w not new like i knew him k-n-e-w k-n-e-w is like adam knew had relations with eve he knew her jesus said you never had a personal relationship with me you just had an experience of an emotion i'm telling you that's what's happening to a lot of people you just get an experience of an emotion and still not be right you can cast out devils and preach aren't we seeing that happening in the end time preach like a house on fire on a windy day and be living in adultery we've seen that happen it's manifested we know these people that has happened you can cast out devils and preach and do these things still not be right look this is my last deal and y'all come on jesus said so said many would come in that day look that word settles it that's it the word settles it ignites listen there is no filial love in the word of god it's all agape love because it's the love of god what shed abroad in our hearts by the baptism of the holy ghost let's stand to our feet come over to the musician you make sure that you make sure that you make sure you're loving god with agape love and if you love him with agape love he has to respond because it's his own self responding to his own self brother brown said when the word meets the word when the word meets the word so when agape meets agape you know one thing's for sure you can give your life for your kids you can give your life for your family you can give your life for your wife but you can't ever transfer that life into another person and make them eternal right but god can he's already done it at calvary that's what he done he released the life so that you and i can get that agape love we listen we all got to live and feel your love we got we love our our mother and our and our wife and all we love them with godly love if you're if you're a godly person but without agape love you can't love god you can do all this love i love i love i love i love i love and then you're gonna stand before the white throne judgment and jesus is gonna say you never love me like i wanted you to love me i died for you what have you done for me amen and that's what brother ray accepted whenever he got born again he accepted that god died for him amen he accepted that love that he that there's a man could die called god jesus christ and could put his life in ray gabriel and then when brother ray when this body couldn't handle it anymore when his body retired got tired couldn't function because listen we're in three dimensions we still got to function our kidneys have to function our brain has to function our everything's got to function we're not supernatural in our body we're supernatural in our soul if we're born again so that supernatural to brother ray just stepped over into a fat it just got faster stepped right out of that body never made a cut and never made a sound never made a sound but boy there was a sound in another dimension that we can't hear but i just know there's one thing for sure there was a noise there was a thunder all right when he stepped across that curtain of time there was a thunder went off and they said oh brother ray we've been looking for you and then what they said brother abraham said oh he's here now they they knew he was coming let's sing a song god bless you make sure you have agape love and to know what agape love is not to read a love story book i once was lost in sin but jesus read the bible and wrote my when name makes it rhyme oh let us have a little talk with jesus [Music] is [Music] but just a little talk when jesus clears the way now let us have a little talk with jesus tell him all about our troubles [Applause] [Music] jesus makes it rise gonna sing this last verse and it will be dismissed be
