Description:
DANIEL 9: 24-27
»     24     †     Seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city, to finish the transgression, and to make an end of sins, and to make reconciliation for iniquity, and to bring in everlasting righteousness, and to seal up the vision and prophecy, and to anoint the most Holy.
»     25     †     Know therefore and understand, that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks, and threescore and two weeks: the street shall be built again, and the wall, even in troublous times.
»     26     †     And after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off, but not for himself: and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary; and the end thereof shall be with a flood, and unto the end of the war desolations are determined.
»     27     †     And he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week: and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease, and for the overspreading of abominations he shall make it desolate, even until the consummation, and that determined shall be poured upon the desolate.

 293       †        I could say something awful good right here, but I guess I'll hold it till tomorrow night. See? All right.
... and have power over the waters to turn them to blood and to smite the earth with plagues as oft as they will.
What is it? What can bring these things but the Word? They can do nature any way they want to. Here it is. They're the one who brings on this Sixth Seal. They uncover and open it up. It's the power of God to interrupt nature. See, the Sixth Seal, is completely an interruption of nature.
Do you get it now? There's your Seal. Who does it? It's the prophets the other side of the rapture. With the power of God, the Word of God, they just condemn nature. They can send earthquakes, turn the moon into blood, the ...

the Pope has visited the Eman of the United Arab Emirates Muslim and said the document signed by Pope Francis and the grand Amman was prepared with much reflection in prayer the one great danger at this moment he continued his destruction war and hatred and if we don't embrace one another kiss one another even pray our faith will be defeated the Pope explained that the document is born of faith in God who is the father of all the father of peace it condemns all destruction all terrorism from the first terrorism in history that being Cain the holy father I don't even like that word the Holy Father said that from the Catholic point of view the document on human fraternity which is fraternizing human fraternity does not go one millimeter beyond the Second Vatican Council the document was made in the spirit of Vatican 2 among Muslims he said there are various opinions but them to it to them to it is a process speaking of his meeting with the Muslim leaders the Pope says he wants to he took what he took away from the encounter were wisdom and fidelity in the past a path of wisdom and fidelity leads you to build peace he left with an impression of being in the midst of true sages I was very satisfied Wow a Protestant and the one most radical religion in the world besides Catholicism and their meeting together and signed a treaty Wow how close are we hey man got your Bibles let's turn to revelation 6 by way of announcements I'll make a few now since they didn't make many the banquet remember it is next Saturday pictures at 4 o'clock 8 at 5:00 I'll have to be real late so

Saints are looking forward to it too a good trip so we we think that would be just wonderful and also as brother Dale mention March the second that is the first Saturday in March at 5 o'clock up here in the sanctuary we need all officials of the church not secondary all officials of the church that alright song leaders deacons preachers trustees technicians board of directors you can be exempt if you want to part of directors and and if you have a question of that whether you need to be there ask me but musicians don't have to you know if you got a dual job yeah but musicians you don't know how the kids and all they don't have to come and all the secondary people just the ones that have a job when everybody's here if you got a job then you need to show up you need to be here at five o'clock to go over some things that we did go over we're getting bigger we're getting more diverse and we need to have some we're going to actually read where brother branham told us what each office was just to reiterate that we know what office is and then we'll cover some other things going forward I want to commend Josiah Canada where's yeah in the back Zach black bet huh mean per noon way and Michael these guys when we had company this morning they didn't have a place to sit to eat they got up and got there no one had to Matt now I did say something June and I said we need to ask those guys to get up Josiah was the first man to stand up the rest of them followed him they got up they gave their table to the sisters that were with us this morning so you give them a big hand and man they weren't asked they weren't asked so that's commendable and even Anderson even Anderson Moruga made coffee about fell over any cow looked like he knew what he was doing was comfortable you know a lot of times men when you look out I'm gonna say that dude ain't never done that before but he had done it before he you didn't spill anything but and then I told you and I said he'll do right if you'll put that little cup up here so nobody will drink it while it's being made he reached over and got a cup and stuck it up in there good man so that's good revelation 6 but thank God for that we got people that are led by Ward though they weren't told to do that and they I just got right up automatically and done it in this day an hour that is a victory that is a victory a man because you can't hardly get a kid to get out and get out of your way out there they'll stand in your way just to just to make a point you understand what I'm saying so revelation 6 verse 12 thank God let's pray gently father thank you for this day thank you for the time that we'll have Lord to come in just for a few minutes talk about you Lord we ask you just take care of each one here be with the ones on the highways be with brother nailing myself and David Tolin Lord as we take a little trip up to Illinois that you'll just clear the highway it's back Lord and everything will be fine we pray that you just bless each one bless the sisters that were here this morning they're on their way back to Florida now one to South Carolina and the others to Florida Lord may you be with them Lord in their in their van as they travel Lord and give them traveling mercies father forgive us of our sins and give us a blessing today that we cannot contain and we cannot hold thank you for the people here Lord thank you for the bringing of our youth and the ones that are that are doing the things that Lord sometimes we we only try it we only as humans we only mention the bad that goes on but Lord I I like to mention the good the good things that are happening Lord the things that you're doing in you said this thing is all going to be secret and it will this is all a secret coming of you but it has to be in a bride of Jesus Christ we pray that you'd bless us now and take care of us in Jesus name we pray amen I told them downstairs this morning Sunday's good class that you know and don't get me wrong the head which is Christ is important the most important but without our body the heads worthless without a body think about it without a body the head can send all kinds of signals if there's no body for it to go into it's going nowhere so God said I have to have a body in this the bride of Jesus Christ so him being the head when he fires that receptor coming down from that brain and it goes to that hand his foot doesn't move his hand moves all right so that's what you and I are we're going to be what an instrumentality of God when he moves when that receptor fires in his brain we move all right I'll be held man open the sixth seal and lo there was a great earthquake and the Sun became black as sackcloth of hair and the moon became as blood and the stars of heaven Wow the stars of heaven fell unto the earth even as a fig tree casteth her untimely figs when she is shaken of a mighty wind and the heaven departed as a scroll when it rolled together and every mountain and Island were moved out of their places and the kings of the earth and the great men and the rich men chief captains in the mighty men and every bondman and every free man hid themselves in the dens and the rocks of the mountains and said to the mountains and rocks fall on us and hide us from the face of him that sitteth on the throne and from the wrath of the lamb for the great day of his wrath has come and who shall be able to stand you may be seated warrant as a blessing reading the word if anything if anybody does need anything brother Dale and I'll be together we'll be back late Tuesday night so just call us if you need us or get in touch too brother Terrence or one of the one of the preachers here one of the ministers okay so we'll be back Tuesday afternoon pretty late alright let's start with the first we look at the sixth seal starting with showing what the seal was brother Brown was talking bout the seal being the two prophets and that's kind of what we're going to talk about just for a little while today are the two prophets and then I think what we'll do is is I was looking back there and I'll read some quotes in a minute that's not on the list but we want to we know that all trumpets sound under the sixth seal and we know the trumpets are not to us there to Israel but we do get the spiritual application of it mmm we have to have a spiritual application there has to be a trumpet sound you heard the gospel trumpet yeah man you heard the gospel trumpet and you came to that sounding of that trumpet because remember that's one of the three things that happens and it's coming shall the boys the Trump and what does the trumpet do it always called Israel till the Day of Atonement we'll get into that maybe next Sunday but let's run through this real quick on the two prophets now we know who they are we know their Moses and Elijah all right it's not the person Moses and Elijah just the spirit of modes in the spirit of Elijah that's what the prophet of God said and will not read that for sake of time but let's read number one because we're still even though we're looking at this sixth seal this sixth seal is the last seal of Redemption I know it's 2 o'clock but you can say man don't wait to 2:30 you say man now okay there we go thank you man we had all them preachers setting up here yesterday morning I mean this morning y'all didn't get a thing he just hit us right to enrich stop doing see what's the gift for sitting on the front row brother board he got a blessing too he's sitting up there also hey man so now with the earthquake let us compare scriptures and then let's going down to the to the red part compare scriptures of this great event that we will see that this great secret or mystery that was under the sixth seal of the book of redemption so we know the sixth seal we know it finishes Redemption but the sixth seal is the whole book the book of redemption is all tied up in that seal one through six because the seventh seal is silence the seventh seal is no movement no motion it's just silence in heaven for the space of a half an hour but seal 1 through 6 there's something going on all the time all right there's movement God is a God of movement all right that's why they say at the Wailing Wall you know they do the their their a God of movement when they're at that Wailing Wall the Jews now they're moving why they that God is a God of movement all right God don't sit still for nothing all right and the sixth seal now remember these are hidden mysteries in the sixth seal all together is one great big book six Scrolls rolled together and it unwinds the whole book of Redemption that's how the whole earth was redeemed so we've come from the redemption of man - now we're looking at we're looking at the redemption of the earth all right but now you got to remember it's this earth first then the ball that we're living on called Earth it will come it will follow see that's why the whole creation is waiting Romans 8 the whole creation is waiting and groaning what for the manifestation of the sons of God this whole world the earth all the earthquakes and all those things that's waiting on me and you because it's not in this right to be conditioned this earth was created for perfect eternal people this earth was created for that wasn't created for chaos and sin and murder and all that stuff it was not it was created to be inhabited by the children of God hey man so that's what we're getting back to all right the second lesson number two so the her little earth is going to be redeemed but it's got to go through something before it gets this Redemption same way as you and I you and I will not go through any physical tribulation period not the wrath of God you and I stand complete in Christ because he took the wrath of God and then he took the wrath of God upon himself annihilated it and says you're perfect all right so that's us but the sixth seal is the tribulation period you and I are going to go through a period of tribulation you're going through one now if you don't have if tomorrow morning you don't have to go to work number one you're blessed but there's not a soul in here that had got a tax issue coming up April the sixth Inc hello oh yeah everybody starting now that's tribulation to me all y'all did get all that money back I want to thought y'all I have to pay every year though you know so I'm going through a tribulation period up to April the 16th and there I have to pay it continues on hey man everybody that gets a man say man but the soap but now that see let's talk about us but we guys to look at this seal though because see all this happens after we leave we will never touch a tribulation wrath of God poured out upon the sinless people that's tribulation the wrath of God poured out on sinless people or swell sending people not sinless people sorry we got that at first but the sinning people are the sinners is where the wrath is poured out okay because look the bride is gone in other words and look let me tell you something about the body of Christ the body of Christ it's not the foolish version the body of Christ is not the 144,000 it's not the cup of water in my name it's not Abraham Isaac and Joseph it's not even John the Baptist it's the bride the bride is his body on the day of Pentecost that's what I told him downstairs listen when Jesus was here he was the head of all things but there was nothing to be ahead of he didn't save one soul by the new birth while he was here on earth not one person sure he said well you know you you keep doing this and you don't do you go sin no more that one but that wasn't an inward work everything eternal was in that man everything eternal was in that man walking on the face of the earth and it was so it was so caught inside that body till he couldn't get out he had to die to release it so he could come back on me and you so his body sure he was standing there with his body but it was an eternal body inside of that body he was living in amen it wasn't his outside physical body listen that was a sacrifice that was Isaiah 53 he gave his soul a ransom now the souls what bought you but his stripes that he took in the things that he took in his body was for you on the outside guy we don't need stripes on in our soul he took those stripes physical stripes to heal your body and then because he get lit there's a separation there he gave his soul a ransom the very soul of God he ransomed his own soul to get your soul because you were in there in that throne somebody said that this morning oh yeah so the six seals of tribulation period so we have to go through a minor one we go through typical tribulation of problems that we have and we're going to cover that later on because those tribulation in this part of the Tribulation Period God sends two prophets down to draw out 144,000 people that are servants to the bride is that Alright say Amen but what's going to happen before that is is that you and I are going to have to come to a Tribulation Period we had a prophet come in the end time we had a prophet pronounce things and I want to clear something up thank you brother Michael for reminding me of that last Sunday I told I was talking about he who prophesy must die all right and that's exactly the truth well brother Michael walks in the study after church and he said well now these people like Samuel prophesied and he wasn't dead yet so I had to go I got to go back to explain that because those who prophesy must die they're prophesying of something to come now look brother Branham prophesied seven dreams or seven visions five of them come to pass while he was still alive - you can say whenever but we know the last one happen because the United States is not laying and ruined yet whatever you want think about the Catholic Church or a woman in the White House I don't really care about that but those happen but the major prophecy brother Branham came to prophesy was that a bride was here that God was in flashing you and me in the Son of man ministry that was his major prophecy think of elijah elijah had many prophecies in his time right elijah the man he lied but remember he prophesied of Jezebel's death but he died or he went he went up in a rapture before that happened right Elijah is the one that saw Jezebel die Amen and what your brother brought him say I've been reading it Elijah top crust he likes your type who the bride so whatever brother branham prophesied to come to pass you and I are the recipients of that part of the prophecy but we must not say then like what brother Dale was talking about we must say well it's coming it's something coming it's something we're going to something what you put that's prophesying then you have to die even Jesus prophesied and he died but he died for me in you he died so that we would become the prophecy hey man we got to step in a priest a long time ago in Jamaica you know brother Branham had that vision of the people in Jamaica going up and down the hills that's great to be to have that prophecy it's great to have brother Branham prophesy over anything cuz I believe what he said was the truth but there had to be a fulfillment there had to be somebody literally standing in that vision and it's not a vision anymore it's not a vision anymore it's a reality but we were standing on that mountain we were going up and down that mountain with the Jamaicans that was a fulfillment of that prophecy that was a prophecy anymore it was reality same thing what's going to happen you and I are going to become the recipients of the prophecy become a reality and then we're gonna leave out of here amen so the sixth seal is the Tribulation Period so that's going to take place after the bride is gone there's no living creatures he's talking about with lying ox man and eagle now God's not dealing with a church anymore and we're going to get into that I've been studying a little bit on that with the Feast of the trumpets cuz remember the feast of atonement I'll read it a little while the feast of atonement you and I are living now under the Feast of Pentecost hello you and I are living under the Feast of Pentecost which the day of Pentecost was back in in 80 30 on that when the day of Pentecost and that day has continued through the Gentile dispensation well when we leave God isn't going to take it to Israel not to kill the sacrifice again but Day of Atonement is the morning that something had been killed we'll get into that so it's okay you can think about it but still in other words they're not going to have to take Jesus Christ and put him back on the cross and show him to the hundred forty-four thousand no the day of atonement will be that they will realize that the lamb has already been killed two thousand years ago and they're going to realize now they're not prophecy they're what was prophesied of and they're standing right in the middle of what was going on and then not all right so he's dealing with Israel and listen you saw and sometimes we do sometimes which old that's all to Israel but it's a great thing for us to see that to see what God is doing the Israel because whatever he's doing to Israel he's already done to us already done to us listen this is on that side of the prophecy right now they get theirs but this is on our Gentile side the bride's gone so whatever prophecy we had we're done yeah hope we prophesied of a millennium no we're not prophesied a millennium the millenniums to the Jews their prophets out of a millennium you said well what about a future home you got it right now it's inside of you where it's gonna all gather together Louisa's little two acres Aaron's gonna need a few more acres he's a little bit bigger but the few acres you set up here you get talked about yeah okay so we're all we all got the part of a city so we're not prophesying of a city because I'm sure John saw the city coming down sure that's gonna be a day of culmination when that's gonna happen but you and I are already promised it right now Israel's promised the Millennium they got to get to it but do you know who is keeping us who's keeping it away oh here we go again and that's true because of the prophecy we have not fulfilled our part of the prophecy yet they without us cannot be made perfect that's our prophecy become perfect I meant God's not dealing with the church anymore done gone he's dealing with Israel this is the other side this is when Israel receives the message of the kingdom by the two prophets read him just a little bit I'm extending him remember Israel as a nation God's servant nation servants not bride service okay and then when when when Israel is brought in it'll be a national affair Israel the kingdom agents were David brother Dale tell me this morning we're David the son of David sits on the throne all right that's what that was a prophecy the prophecies in the Old Testament I believe it's in Ezekiel or somewhere somewhere where it says that I'll never in other words David's throne will be continual now we know that hasn't happened naturally because when Solomon died it wasn't David it wasn't Solomon's son it took over earth it was he didn't last long okay and there's nobody sitting on throne now in Israel so this is a promise in the Millennium that the son of David well he was sitting in his kingly throne and he's not going to rule me in you he's ruling the 12 tribes of Israel you and I are not included in that sure we're gonna sit with him with him there but we're gonna be on the honeymoon yeah nothing's gonna bother us number three and when we find out John said I'll be held win open the sixth seal it was a great earthquake then all nature was interrupted see God's been doing great things like healing the sick open the eyes of the blind doing great works but we find out here that nature took a tumble now we've been talking about what's been happening to people now what's gonna happen is what's gonna happen to the natural earth and listen it's not going to happen just to be happening the two prophets are here we're gone so the wrath of God is poured out on the earth okay but Israel but that's what I believe Israel will be in Goshen 144,000 may go through some kind of persecution but they're not going to be killed until that 1260 days is over amen but the whole lot of the other part of the earth is going to just be in chaos all right yet nature look what taking the earthquake son what black moon wouldn't give it's like star shooting fell everything happened right at the time of the opening of this sixth seal that's when it takes place right immediately after the announcement of those martyrs what the fifth seal the martyrs had been finished aren't number four dick seal same place but we know that this sixth seal is the judgment seal so like I said before you and I don't go through a judgment but we do go through it where did you beat we're judging now to me that's what our judge is now that statue a perfect man is what's judging us at the moment you're not judged for your soul being eternal if you're born again no you're judged whether you can live those all out through there in that outside man or the middle man right right that okay all right so that's so that's so watch that dealing with that's dealing with the earth you live in it's dealing with with the things that we do and we don't do all right for we know that the extinct seal is the judgment seal it is the judgment seal see our judgment seal our our judgment seat is where you're sitting today brother bottom judgment starts at the house of God all right we're not supposed to judge people out there but you know what we're supposed to come together and judge things in the in the sanctuary and not have to take it to court right hey man that's what the Bible says we're not supposed to take a man to court a brother to court now somebody outside yeah because they're just lawless people but you you know if men Lewis had a dispute we're supposed to settle it here we're not supposed to let it get so bad - what we got to go to court whether that's wrong that shows bad lack of judgment and maybe a lot of other things cuz that's what the Bible says how you going judge angels to get judge in the church bring something before the church settle it here I've got the saddle in here you will go sell it and then lawyer's office a nun regenerated lawyer I don't have nothing against lawyers but Jesus did say is go hard for them to be go hard for them to get in the kingdom what is that Right Said Jeanne that's what I said one to anyone well you'll be born again and be a lawyer that's okay but not meaning seeing the church go now it's finished goes up then we see the martyrs under the altar here's the breaking fourth of the judgment upon the people we're out of this tribulation judgement so out of the tribulation judgments gonna come 144,000 redeemed Jews I'll prove to you they're Jews not Gentiles now we know for a fact the two witnesses are not going to be Gentiles because they won't listen to them and the Spirit of Moses and Elijah come from the Old Testament in the Jewish time we know they're not Gentiles okay they're Jews all right and they have nothing to do with the bride and not a thing the bride we done seen the brides gone you can't place that anywhere don't come back until the nineteenth chapter of the book of you know that means the book of Revelation because we go up on for one my brother Dale reads that scripture in Revelations 4 verse 1 it says after these things what after these Church ages revelations 1 2 and 3 is the church ages revelation 4:1 starts off it says after these things what after the church ages are over we go up through that open door II said I heard a voice in heaven says what come up hither and they went up through the open door you and I are going to go up through that open door and then God's gonna come straight down and deal with the Jews we know revelations 5 ISM is a heavenly scene with revelations 5 is a scene that covers a lot of a lot of territory because brother Branham said it was the Lamb doing intercessory work in the church ages alright so that was what was going on there and then what revelation 6 this not to us the sales are to the Jews we know that right Jim revelations 19 we come back into revelations 19 into what the millennium real simple and notice for the sixth seal is the judgment seal of the word so we all have to stand at that judgment seal the words judging us right now pretty simple I mean if we're being judged at the moment but we'll never stand in judgment listen if you become the word in other words if you are the word how can you be judged the word is the judgment the word can't ever be judged the word is the judgment so if you're the Word made flesh you're the judgment made flesh because you and I remember you and I are gonna judge even angels amen so let's go to revelation 11 and let's read now this is the two prophets and there was given me a reed like him to rod I understood saying rise and measure the temple of God the altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple leave out measure it not for it is given unto the Gentile in the holy city shall be tread under foot forty two months we know how long that is 1260 days three and a half years and I will give power unto my two witnesses and they shall prophesy a thousand two hundred and threescore days that's 1260 days at thirty days to a month which is exactly three and a half years all right so they're gonna prophesy three and a half of our calendar years they're gonna prophesy 1260 days in sackcloth and ashes clothed in sackcloth these are the two olive trees and the two candlesticks standing before the god of the earth and if any man will hurt them fire proceedeth out of their mouth and devoureth their enemy if any man will hurt them he must hurt them he must in this manner be killed these have power to shut up heaven now who did that know who shut up heaven elijah elijah for exactly how long three and a half years so he knows how to do it and have power over waters turn to blood who did that Moses the whole Nile River oh could you imagine turn that whole river into blood and to smite the earth with all plagues as often as they will so if any plague comes it'll come through those two prophets and then they shall have finished their testimony the Beast that ascendeth out of the bottomless pit shall make war against them and shall overcome them and kill them then remember they lay in the streets dead they don't even bury them they just leave them there CNN got all their cameras and all the other ABC and CBS and NBC and MSNBC and boy you got news everywhere around here now well they got all their cameras turned on these two guys that tormented the world but they gonna get a real surprise when them to just stand up without the help there won't be any paramedics around no God Almighty will raise them right up from the dead and they'll take a rapture all right let's read let's go to number five so that's the two witnesses there on the earth and I like to say they're already on the earth now they're not babies they can't be babies if we're this close to getting out of here they can't be little bitty children they got to be somewhere in this world that's what I mean we must anticipate that this thing's coming to an end real close and must anticipate that the two witnesses are already something's working now they can't receive the new birth so they go in the rapture with us they go out to receive it when we leave I'm just telling you because what goes up the bribe goes up if the brides the only one who goes up is one's got the new birth in their soul so they've got to stay here and preach to the two - the 144,000 all right look what can bring these things but the word so they're not listen they're not just two prophets standing over there just calling fire and calling the earthquakes and calling anything know their word prophets they know what's going on that's why I said I believe they're already here now somewhere in the world and they could be listening to the message you never know they could be they got to know something and then they'll get that morning for the 1260 days okay because look they can do nature any way they want to here it is there the one who brings on this sick seal they uncover and open it up in other words I believe God reveals to them what their what their whole situation is all right remember I mean he even brought Moses up and of course Moses made a lot of boo-boos right and made a lot of mistakes but these two prophets man they're straight from that sixth seal they come right out of Revelations where we just read it and they should be able to see themselves just like that see the sixth seal is completely an interruption of nature and we're going to get into that later on because of us it's the power of God to interrupt nature so that power of God is in them do you get it now there's your seal who does it is two prophets the other side of the rapture so we're gone done there's no one else left here bribed wise there's only 144,000 and two thereby alright with the power of God the Word of God they just condemned nature they can send earthquakes turn the moon into blood the Sun can go down or anything at their command amen there you are there you are see see how the seals open down there in the church age how it showed the martyrs nice talking backwards he's going back and now here's these two prophets because remember mm-hmm this thing don't open in the church age you it opens after we're gone I just read you all that and now here's these two prophets standing here with the Word of God to do anything to nature they want to and they shake the earth and it shows exactly who does it it's Moses and Elijah because there's there's their ministry impersonated again both men oh my do you see it now see what the sixth seal is it's those two prophets so the seal they kept all that sealed up because remember it doesn't say anything about Moses and Elijah in the scripture it says my two witnesses don't even call them prophets it says my two witnesses are witnessing 1260 days then brother branham goes under that seal pulls the seal back off and when he pulls that seal off there's two prophets there's exactly Moses and there's exactly Elijah the two ministries reimburse innate it I don't think this he didn't mean to say impersonate so they're not impersonating it is the spirit of Moses and Elijah all right but see what the sixth seal is it's those two prophets don't let it choke you but watch want to open that sealing you know why he's saying that he said don't get choked because of what I'm doing don't get choked because of what I'm doing he just didn't say that but we can say that now on this side of the prophet being here don't get choked up that a prophet cannot open the seal or can't open the seal because those two prophets open the seal right there got it but we had a Gentile prophet to a Gentile Church to open the seals for me and you to see the redemption of this man the redemption of the body they open a women there you are oh we're living in the eagle day now why did why did he use that phrase he wanted you to realize eagle is prophetic we're living in a prophetic age a prophetic time brother head up among the clouds they opened that sixth seal they have power to do it Amen there's your sixth seal coming open so the two prophets on the earth they're speaking the Word of God and they're not just standing on the street corner going rain when fire earthquake they're preaching their trend they're trying to bring 144,000 people out and during the time of that preaching the Word of God is going to be so real till I really this is just my opinion cuz I can't find it in the Bible then 144,000 is not going to be just doing this oh no they're gonna get that revelation and I think they're gonna start with they're not like the two prophets but they ain't going to keep a mouth shut for 1260 days that's a long time alright so there's your sixth seal opening up see when it opens that state seal sure it's the two prophets standing in there but it's the two prophets - 144,000 and they're going to receive the message just like you did and you didn't keep quiet about it you didn't keep silent amen so what are they gonna do let's look at this just for a second and then we'll close on this thought right here let's go to Daniel 9 we got to go back to the Daniel 70 weeks is that Alright saying ma'am we're going to anyway now watch because look these two prophets have everything to do with this that we're getting ready to talk about the two prophets right so that is the sixth seal opening up the 70 witness this scripture we're gonna read is the opening part of it is the opening of the sixth seal thereby right cuz watch this let's let's compartmentalize it I wanted to try to do it but I didn't know how to I should have left some gaps in here start to look 70 weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city now we got it those are two keys seventy weeks is not just to a group of people it's the people and the city because God doesn't just love the Jews he loves that city called Jerusalem amen he loves it why cuz that's what we're going back to God don't go back to something we don't like so this is the redemption you've heard me say it before brother Dale stated meantime this is the six seals to the Jews it's a six fold purpose brother Brown preached to 6-volt purpose we're gonna read some things out of here in just a minute alright so seventy weeks are determined upon thy people and upon thy holy city because if you'll remember when we did the seals there's a time when there was an edit went out to go rebuild the cities they got part of it done they quit that's why that's why the Pharisees looked at Jesus and he said we've been they said we've been building this temple for a forty and nine years or whatever it is and it took him 44 46 and took them 49 you know what sometimes when you preach all that you just if you forget it you're really in your in your humanity you forget all that but they said it took so long but you for reading the Bible it really took them 49 years why because they had to go back and it says it you got to build the wall and the streets they built wanted them to build the other but when they come to that last edit the one that brother branham used when the one went out whoever it was near Meijer one of them went and built the whole thing got it done in 52 days I think it was all right so that's what we're looking at upon thy people and upon thy holy city to do six things there buddy got that six things we're gonna do all right number one finish the transgression to make an end of sins not sin sins and to make reconciliation for iniquity that's three bringing everlasting righteousness that's four seal up the vision and prophecy that's five and to anoint the most holy that's six now that gets Israel into the Millennium is that all right say Amen that finishes their Redemption yeah so six seals finishes our redemption to finish the transgression justification make end of your sins sanctification mate reconciliation for iniquity give you the Holy Ghost and after you get the Holy Ghost that brings in everlasting righteousness seals up the vision and prophecy in you and anoint the most holy he's listen when we take a body change this thing right here is gonna be anointed they'll be okay so that's what's gonna happen to Israel to get them into the Millennium because the seventy weeks of Daniel does not finish until we go into the Millennium all right so that's where people are getting it so bad wrong they're not listening to brother Branham there is one week left after the right I'm gonna say it one more time I don't care what anybody says I'm gonna read you the Bible all right so here now how is that going to happen Daniel we're telling you remember Gabriel's talking to Daniel Gabriel's telling Daniel this seventy weeks are determined upon us anyway when that period happens right here the seventy weeks are finished amen the seventy weeks are finished seventy weeks are determined they're going to be finished when they anoint the most holy stop here now Daniel I'm going to tell you how it's going to happen know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks that Alright 49 years 49 years seven times seven one week equals seven years alright shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks so there's one period here seven weeks there's threescore what's threescore 63 times two sixty sixty-two weeks so you got seven and sixty-two is how many seven plus 62 is 69 not there's no halves in there anywhere there's not half anywhere in there the street shall be built again in the wall even in troublous times remember they had one they had a trial in one hand and a sword another because you know what the people around there did not want them people back hittin that city then they attack them so God said you put a you put a trial in one hand and a sword in the other and you'd be doing this and then when they said the enemy's coming you got something to fight them with listen people still hate Jerusalem they hate it they hate them just as bad now as they did then just as that that hatred is still there but all what a millennium when Israel gets to rest we're already resting in God but Israel will literally get to rest the land and see there's your Jubilee the land rested at the Jubilee wow this is all good know therefore and understand from the going forth of the commandment to restore and build Jerusalem until the Messiah the Prince shall be seven weeks and threescore and two weeks that 69 weeks after threescore and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself why was he cut off he's cut off for me and you amen cuz actually who cut him off the Jews cut him off they're the ones that killed him sure yeah we killed him but I mean literally that's when he turned to the Gentile church age this the Gentile church age comes in right here right here because remember Titus comes in AD 70 which is still in the first church age okay we've never broke this down like this I want to break it down if we had if this is all we get done all right the prince shall come shall destroy the city now who is that Titus all right but he was cut off but not for himself boom that he was there's a cross right here he was he was killed after 69 weeks he was killed no halves ain't no half there isn't a half there ain't no I get answered now so ain't ain't no half so the Prince is going to destroy the city and the sanctuary in AD what 70 Titus comes in during the Gentile Age right so this right here is the Gentile Church age comes in right here in these 2,000 years in all this down to here all right now we ready we've had 69 weeks in the Bible correct 69 no sixty eight and a half 67 and three quarters and heeey now listen if we go in a rapture before God starts dealing with the Jews who's that he it's not God because this guy right here breaks the Covenant God don't break a covenant so and he the Antichrist the Pope whoever you want call him and he shall confirm the covenant we just read one of them right there for with many for one week which is seven years so how many weeks or how many years are left after the rapture of the church one week there is seven years left after the rapture of the Gentile Church I do not care what anybody says because that's the Bible that's Bible brother Branham said faced final resting place is in my message he never said that he said face final resting places in the Word of God so I'm gonna go with what the word says and he the Antichrist shall confirm the covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week three and a half years he shall cause the sacrifice and the oblation to cease now what's happening watch he shall confirm the covenant meeting for one week he's gonna make a covenant but he's not making a covenant with them two prophets they will not make a covenant with the Pope I'll promise you that there are two morning in people prophets there are you set up here you don't go sleep right by morning keep you awake and he shot I'm loud I know I'm loud I'm sorry I just get excited when they when you put see this thing you see the puzzle fit and he shall confirm the covenant that he makes what's he gonna make a covenant he's not gonna make a covenant with them two prophets he's not gonna make his coming in 144,000 he's gonna make a covenant with the whole world Israel is included leave us alone the Pope says leave Israel alone let him go back make their sacrifices if they want to it not the whole process that the Jews are wanting they're wanting to get sacrifices back they want the red heifer they want the Holy of Holies they want the menorah well who owns all that stuff the Catholic Church when this guy right here when Titus went into that city he obliterated the temple took the menorah took the ladder took the gold took the candlesticks took the holy of holies and hold it back where to Rome hold it back to the Pope they wasn't a poop at that time but he hauled them all well I guess it was hauled them all the way back so where are they now they're in Rome and he the Antichrist shall make a covenant because he's gonna tell those Jews I got what you need so if you'll do what I say just for a little while now just for seven years just for one week if you'll do what I'm gonna say I'm gonna do then then I'll give you I'll make sure the nations don't even bother you anymore that sounds good sounds real good doesn't it for one week but in the middle of that week you know what's going to happen they're gonna be in there doing the sacrifice and the oblation and they're gonna make this and they're going to make that but that 144,000 right in this three-and-a-half years twelve hundred and sixty days those two witnesses are going to call out 144,000 born-again believers that are not in the temple making sacrifices no the Bible says they'll mourn that's why I'm gonna we'll get to the Day of Atonement later on the day of atonement is not the killing of the animal it's a morning that there was a kill they're gonna mourn we read it just the other Sunday in Ezekiel or Zechariah where it says they'll they'll say where do you get the scars in your hands they say in the house of my friends that's gonna happen right here in that first part of that week let me give you a key scroll back down or what mmm wait a minute scope I got thank you keep going keep going keep going there you go these six things happen right to redeem Israel and the city and the city got it and the city people and the city because to anoint the most holy we know what brother Brahm said that's the anointing which is me and you coming into the temple that they're gonna build according to Ezekiel 40 and 44 now when I ask you a question if we've only got three and a half years of to finish Daniels 70 weeks if we only got three and a half years left somebody put that right there and put them last three in there how can you bring in everlasting righteousness when you don't even have an armed Battle of Armageddon happen yet think think none of that can happen until the end of that week not the end of third 1260 days at the end of 1260 days that's why I got that and read at the end of 1260 days that is the end of what the two witnesses have come to do they've come to redeem 144,000 how are you going to bring in everlasting righteousness when you're facing the Battle of Armageddon can't happen that's why there's one full week left there's three and a half years that the two prophets prophesy and it's three and a half years for all this other to happen for them to build the Millennium Temple and for us to come back into that temple to put us in the Millennium that alright cuz we're gonna let's read right here there's a few things right here everybody all right say man I'm not trying to be difficult I'm just trying for us to be right touch brother Branham said if you don't get down you're 70 weeks right you can't get the seals right that's why we how many times have we been placing this in Daniel 7 2 weeks and Peake and preaching on the seals forever all right thank you for years you're right so we're looking at really alright come on let's be sensible there's three periods there's Roka now go back go back down down to here there's a seven-week a 62 and 7 is 69 so there's 70 weeks determined 69 have already happened Bible says that because Titus comes in and takes all this away and on 80 70 and he shall confirm the covenant with many for one week right in here is a Gentile bride being took out when God comes back to the Jews there's one week left for the redemption of Israel now look there's not one week left of tribulation I did not say that never have I said it brother Branham never said it there is not I just told you the Battle of Armageddon gonna happen in the midst of that week because when that when that Pope comes in you know what he's gonna do he's gonna walk in after that three and a half years he said you don't need to do those sacrifices anymore I'm the Messiah oh you talking about all hell break loose when a pope a Gentile Pope walks into that temple and stands in the holy temple and says I'm God no they gonna start pushing buttons you've heard of the Samson effect of the Samson you know you know if you go down you go if I go down you're going with me in the midst of the weeks you'll cause the sacrifice and oblation the seats will see during that time the 1260 days of the prophets are gonna be fed to prophets is gonna be finished they're gonna have already called 144,000 out they gonna be killed 144 thousands gonna be killed they go I'll take a rapture and then the Battle of Armageddon is gonna happen in the midst of the week so there is only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left absolutely no doubt no doubt there's only three and a half years of tribulation no doubt but there's seven years left to finish Daniels 70 weeks to get them in the Millennium we proved it and proved it and proved it and I just go back to the Bible that's what the Bible says you argue with the Bible if you tell me what brother berm says I'm gonna say did he say what that said he did we just didn't understand what he's talking about because even in the sealed book I read it last night brother Brown says 70 weeks equals seven years he condensed all of the 70 weeks of Daniel to three and a half years of Jesus's ministry over here three and a half years of Jesus's ministry over here that's one week so when they asked him when is when is the threat of the two prophets coming he said the last half and he's exactly right there's three and a half years left here there's three and a half years left here of the Messiah message all that other stuff is to do is the world because there's three and a half more years left to finish just one week but it's not to Israel is to get the world knocked out did get everything destroyed and get the Battle of Armageddon get to 144,000 bite let them build the Millennium Temple it's gonna take some time because you know what we're still in time I'm telling you the Battle of Armageddon we think of the Battle of Armageddon obliterating everything it will not the Battle of Armageddon is man's fire it is the battle between man and man it is an atomic war it may take three and a half years to kill everybody it's not gonna be an instant kill starvation think of the radiation all over the whole world but everybody's got to die so there's gonna be a point in time where it may take a little time we say well the Battle of Armageddon is gonna be one day no it's not gonna be one day it's gonna take time so there's got to be more time and you can't bring in everlasting righteousness during them but Tommy storm there by okay with that all right I don't want to be I don't want to be mean but I'm telling you you got to see what brother Brad was talking about if you don't look you don't plate you can't place it if you don't see it that way cannot place it if you don't see it brother Brown said there's three and a half years here three and a half years here so when did the zoo profits they come at the end of this one at the last of this three and a half years of the ministry of Jesus Christ not at the last three and a half years of the seventy weeks or he's wrong because the Bible's right there's one week left after the raptured stare at that for about thirty minutes listen it's not that I'm right and someone else is wrong with the Bible's right and we must go back to the Bible for everything we get right the man and clap if you want to give God the glory not me I think God we had a prophet cuz we've never known this without brother Branham telling us but he can't tell us something wrong or we contend just like the people out there in the world are contending that he was wrong what's the first thing they bring up believe the sign and all the people the first doctrine they brought up was Daniel 70 we've called they said brother Branham was wrong he changed it here and he didn't hear and they said three and a half it they just don't have the Holy Ghost that's the whole problem amen all right let's read number six so they're going to do six things to put the Jews in the Millennium the two prophets are going to have their job is for 1260 days is to birth 144,000 Israelis or how you want Jews so let's just read what he said just for just for reading purposes to finish the transgression that's number one to finish what to finish Israel's transgression what is a transgress is to go against something to transgress against me is to do a wrong to me transgressed against you is to do her own to you so Israel did it wrong to God and in this 70th week what's the 70th week seven years in this 70th week what's going to happen God is going to finish the transgression of Israel what through two prophets the opening of the sixth seal shows this right here God is going to finish transgress individual finish the transgression will be turning away the ungodliness from Jacob and then all Israel will be born again now live not all Israel 144,000 all right now he knows that and you know that but you know what God had him say things just to try hello even brother Bram said he'll have a brother say something against you just see how you'll react boy every rough let me read you something here's somebody give me the who said give me somebody give me this in church and I will read it again I don't take time I was gonna get done three o'clock but you know what we'll be fine what I do with it she took it out on my Bell phone I don't have Athena diamond everybody Notre Dame maybe I threw it away no I didn't I left it at home it's hanging up at home it says sometimes it says it says something like this he says sometimes the reason people hate you is because they don't like your they don't they their spirit does it in other words coincide with yours didn't you put that you wrote that didn't you dig there I like that I keep that man I'm down but look all of them will receive the Holy Spirit number two now this is the second one bringing this is finish the transgression make an end of sin number two write this down your paper we stay a long time anyway let's go down to number two make an end of sins now let's read again Daniel finish transgression making inter sins that's his second purpose of coming first is to finish Israel's transgression and to make an end of sin where did Israel sin where did they do their final sin remember when he was cut off after that 69 week when Messiah was cut off this is what cut him off where did Israel sin where did they do their vile sin word where did they separate themselves from God now listen close let's turn to Matthew 24 here's where Israel made her fatal mistake I keep going on down yeah going down to the because he was talking about Pilate listen here's their mistake here's their sin then answered the people his blood be on us and on our children so see the two prophets in Revelations that we were just talking about they're gonna preach god they're gonna preach Jesus Christ to them people to take away their sin because remember what did he say forgive them father for they don't know what they're doing that's where they've done it he was making an end of sin for them how could he do anything else but forgive them knowing that he had to blind their eyes so that you and I could come in amen and there's that fifth seal Jew see there's that fifth seal you put in there because the only way the fifth seal you could come in is that God literally blinded his own children's eyes amen god bless you all right let's read number seven it's because you got to do the last one to make reconciliation number three is met reconciliation for iniquity to make reconciliation for iniquity iniquity is doing wrong as they did it to cross down at the very bottom he made reconciliations but it will be not be applied to them it was not apply what in other words it weren't applied to him at the cross they never accepted it but they're going to accept it with the hunter the two prophets they're gonna accept that he made reconcile listen he did everything at the cross we did everything for us at the cross we've just gotta accept that it was not applied to them why because they were blinded and could not see and why did they blind you say well maybe today because I'm blind you're willfully blind they were blinded because God blinded them but you're blind because you're willfully blind there's no reconciliation for you if you believe not I am he jesus said you'll die in your sins that's right now in Isaiah when he makes reconciliation for iniquity still in the city for purpose go to number 8 we gotta get out of here we got to leave your house at 3:30 who's heard such a thing earth was made bring forth in one day for as soon as I'm through Bayless she brought forth her children that's Isaiah 66 as soon as I saw that she was there that that was their Messiah she was born again in one day make reconciliation for sin now see if he does all that look end of sin reconciliation for iniquity all those things what has he done he's restored Israel back through the 144,000 give them the Holy Ghost and they're standing there complete and they got to go in the rapture but you got to remember that finishes their earthly parked now when you bring in everlasting righteousness seal up the vision and prophecy in the north the most holy that continues on after the 1260 days that's why folks there's the exactly three and a half more years left after the rapture of learning 44,000 to finish Daniels physical 70 weeks that's just the way it is god bless you stand back we'll get to the we'll get to the trumpets next week I really enjoy those trumpets they may not be to us but boy lays nuggets in there like you wouldn't believe but you and I are privileged that God has give us a revelation and you know what it fits you don't have to say but he said I hate when somebody says that you know brother I'm said this and this but he also said well now what are you saying he contradicted itself no there's only three and a half years of Jesus's ministry left to finish the to finish the redemption part of us in Israel because it's real easy you take the three and a half years of Jesus's ministry now who got that the Gentiles remember the Israel was cut off look at me just for a second three and a half years of Jesus's ministry right here all right he was cut off from amongst his people so the Jews don't get that the Gentiles get this part so the 1260 days this promise to Israel is over here right Gentiles in between so remember if you didn't have the Gentiles you pull it together but look it truthfully there's not seven years of Jesus's ministry he preached three and a half years but the Gentiles got this revelation the two prophets won't preach the same revelation to take out 144,000 so brother Branham seventy weeks equals seven years he breaks it all down takes all the walls and all the bringing and this and this and he breaks it down to redemption redemption of the Gentiles redemption of the Jews so brother Branham one of they gonna prophesy the last half of this week absolutely the last half of the week he's talking about it is not the last half of the 70th week as the Bible talks about amen amen god bless you let's bow our head family father thank you for the day that we're living in and the time it may be the worst time and have all kinds of things that we have to overcome in this age but Lord what a wonderful time it is that what was written in that Bible what you wrote from your mind straight through the mind of all the prophets and sages and ones that wrote the Bible that we're now the manifestation of that we're the culmination of the Gentile dispensation and you've give us revelation and we thank you for that Lord
