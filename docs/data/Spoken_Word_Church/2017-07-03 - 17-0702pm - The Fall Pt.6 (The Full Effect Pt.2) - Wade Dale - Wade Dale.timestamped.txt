[0:00] I want to try to make this one the short
[0:05] one if that's he possible he floats the
[0:09] first slot vanishing so y'all remember
[0:13] some of y'all know some of y'all don't a
[0:15] few years ago and I was born she was
[0:17] pretty mature and she was about a seven
[0:20] and a half pound premature baby so she
[0:22] had underdeveloped lungs and we gave we
[0:25] made this announcement that he's going
[0:27] to pull up here and gave it out that
[0:29] shows kind of what what I want to talk
[0:32] about here not that slide the other one
[0:34] please but anyway this is her when she
[0:38] was sick and that's her after she at the
[0:40] Lord touched her but basically she was a
[0:43] big preemie and so she had
[0:45] underdeveloped lungs and she had a hard
[0:47] time getting oxygen into her body the
[0:49] lowest point she was at was maybe on was
[0:52] the third night she was she got down to
[0:53] 38 percent oxygen saturation and her
[0:56] blood and that was before she got
[0:58] transported so we don't really know how
[1:00] bad she really got but most of you
[1:01] remember some of you don't know but uh
[1:03] she was really close to dying and
[1:05] there's one thing I wanted to add that I
[1:06] never did say in the original testimony
[1:08] that I had a lot of fear okay and I
[1:12] think some of y'all might have thought
[1:14] that because I was so overcome with fear
[1:16] that I blew this out of proportion but
[1:18] she really was on death's door okay I
[1:20] mean we me and Gabby were in this boat
[1:22] together and the Lord Jesus that was
[1:24] there but we didn't think he was we
[1:26] thought we were forsaken he was asleep
[1:27] on the boat so to speak and uh and so
[1:31] those were really big waves all right
[1:33] that we were facing and on the this is
[1:35] one part that I didn't share just to
[1:36] show you how sick she was that the
[1:38] paramedic when they transported down to
[1:40] Egleston the first thing this lady said
[1:42] to Gabby the paramedic said I never lost
[1:45] your baby twice okay she was really
[1:48] close to dying she nearly lost her baby
[1:49] twice so but then on the third on the
[1:53] fourth day Sunday morning the Lord
[1:55] raised her up she began to mend and so
[1:57] we thank the Lord for that that was the
[1:58] original announcement that we had made
[2:01] and then go to the other side please
[2:04] this is the new one on your way out
[2:06] today on the right side over on the
[2:09] right where the offering boxes and the
[2:12] prayer requests everybody every family
[2:13] please get one at least you know what
[2:15] maybe one for now of the original
[2:18] testimony there's 30 minutes long some
[2:20] of you came into this church since that
[2:22] time so you haven't seen it you already
[2:23] have one get another one that's fine and
[2:25] they're right beside it there's this
[2:27] pictures and moving up to dates that we
[2:29] made and says who the by the help I've
[2:31] come that's a quote from the song first
[2:33] and also from First Samuel 7 where
[2:35] Samuel raised up that stone called
[2:37] Ebenezer that's why I'm doing this today
[2:40] it's a memorial because it's her third
[2:41] birthday I want to keep reminding y'all
[2:43] of what the Lord did because we don't
[2:45] want to forget never forget it's hard to
[2:47] see this on here but and then that
[2:49] scripture that was so meaningful to us
[2:51] during the whole trial there is no fear
[2:54] in love first John 4 because there's two
[2:57] things the Lord did during this
[2:58] testimony he delivered us from the
[2:59] spirit of fear he showed us how to
[3:00] overcome the fear that even if our baby
[3:02] died doesn't doing a good to fear
[3:04] regardless of the trial you face
[3:06] don't fear and the other thing was of
[3:08] course he healed our baby and Gaby can
[3:10] you bring up other see if she'll come up
[3:12] she wants to tell you a little something
[3:14] go back to the other slide please sorry
[3:17] to keep switching them good job okay now

[21:02] we'll already be there about lunchtime
[21:04] so other than that you've got all your
[21:06] other announcements downstairs so let's
[21:08] bow our heads before we get started the
[21:11] Heavenly Father we pray today Lord that
[21:12] you'll come among us in a way that you
[21:17] know how the service is going to turn
[21:19] out but we don't so you take full
[21:22] control Lord and you'd be the one that
[21:23] does the speaking the hearing you're the
[21:26] only one that can reveal you're the only
[21:29] one who can put the right words in the
[21:30] right place you're the only one that can
[21:34] smooth it over if we as humans try to
[21:36] mess it up Lord you are the one that
[21:39] knows all things and you before the
[21:42] world started what we will be doing here
[21:44] Lord now I pray that you would reveal to
[21:47] us Lord our plan our position our place
[21:50] Lord what we're doing here the time and
[21:53] all the things that we were going
[21:55] through even in life and also now in the
[21:59] eternal part that we're looking at
[22:01] may we Lord slip into eternity today and
[22:04] just look at the supernatural just for a
[22:06] moment and see what you're doing in our
[22:08] life we ask you Father to forgive us of
[22:11] our sins and our many mistakes Lord as
[22:13] we come together to meet you Lord we
[22:15] pray that you would just be with the
[22:16] ones that are sick that are here ones
[22:19] that are sick that are not here be with
[22:21] the ones that are bound by sin by Satan
[22:23] Lord we pray that you just break those
[22:25] bonds and let it be that the Word of God
[22:29] would take over probably give us a day
[22:32] our daily bread and forgive us our
[22:33] trespasses in Jesus name we pray amen
[22:36] second Corinthians 5 verse 1 Paul says
[22:39] for we know that if our earthly house of
[22:43] this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a
[22:46] building of God and house not made with
[22:47] hands eternal in the heavens for it in
[22:51] this we groan in this we groan desiring
[22:55] to be clothed upon with our house which
[22:57] is from heaven if so be that being
[23:01] clothed we shall not be found
[23:03] kid four we that are in this tabernacle
[23:07] do groan being burdened not for that we
[23:11] would be unclothed but clothed upon that
[23:14] mortality might be swallowed up of life
[23:18] now let's go to Galatians two and kind
[23:21] of take our take our text here like we
[23:23] did last Sunday this would just be part
[23:25] two of two lifes Galatians 2:20 listen
[23:30] to Paul I am crucified with Christ
[23:32] nevertheless I live he's a living human
[23:37] man nevertheless I live yet not i but
[23:40] Christ now liveth in me all right and
[23:44] the life which I now live he's
[23:49] constituting he's living a different
[23:50] life the life that I now live the life
[23:54] which I now live in the flesh I live by
[23:57] the faith of the Son of God who loved me
[24:00] and gave himself for me you may be
[24:03] seated in the Lord at his blessing for
[24:05] the reason of the word I'm not going to
[24:06] use them the board today I don't think
[24:08] we'll just kind of coast through this
[24:11] with some being out and all I just want
[24:14] to kind of background but thank God for
[24:16] those of you that are here man alright
[24:19] so we were talking last Sunday and I
[24:22] want to read you I read it last night
[24:24] but brother Dale's been preaching on the
[24:27] condescending of God's showing that God
[24:30] is real but if you look at it this way
[24:33] because this really helps me his
[24:35] condescended to express his reality not
[24:39] to make him real think about that he
[24:42] condescended the way he's condescending
[24:45] is the way he's wanted it done and you
[24:48] know what like I said last night and
[24:50] I've got said in a Bible study the only
[24:52] way you going to understand God is by
[24:54] that Bible right there a man there's no
[24:57] other way you say well I don't
[24:59] understand it you pray for a revelation
[25:01] because actually God's not going to come
[25:03] down and write you a 67th chapter of the
[25:06] Bible he's not going to come and write
[25:08] you or revelations 23 just because
[25:10] you're some special something no he
[25:12] wrote this Bible 66 books for man to
[25:15] realize the reality of God
[25:17] and as he kind of sins he expresses his
[25:20] reality it doesn't make him real he was
[25:23] real before all this ever started but
[25:26] the condescending of God which to me the
[25:28] condescending of God is the my as man
[25:30] preaching the only am we going to get it
[25:34] is preaching I'm sorry
[25:36] just blew the foolishness of preaching
[25:38] that's the only way you're going to get
[25:40] it's only going to understand God sure
[25:41] you're going to get your point you're
[25:43] going to get your eyes you're going to
[25:44] get your thoughts but when it comes down
[25:46] to where God is going to condescend from
[25:48] something we have no idea to now it's
[25:52] going to take somebody to break it down
[25:53] for you ma'am so we see to that that so
[25:57] the condescend he condescended to
[25:59] express his reality think of that that
[26:01] was his expression of his reality that
[26:04] didn't make him real he always runs with
[26:11] harmony words mercy see but I don't know
[26:15] she thought thank you for the water
[26:18] previous messengers has ever brought me
[26:20] water before most time it's ugly Bob
[26:23] brings it up here man but the
[26:27] condescending of God so listen what I'm
[26:29] trying to say is is we struggle about
[26:30] whether this is right and this is wrong
[26:32] and who said this and this said what
[26:33] just realize one thing God's already put
[26:36] in place somebody listen somebody is
[26:39] going to see it or he wasn't written it
[26:42] this way that's the way I see God God by
[26:45] his foreknowledge wrote this Bible with
[26:48] us already in it and with everything we
[26:51] need to get back to where we love got
[26:53] lost from the man so there's no other
[26:55] way that we can get God here it's by
[27:00] other than his word all right no other
[27:03] man you say Oh what about this prophet
[27:05] y'all call this William Branham listen
[27:07] man's ideas got involved like me and
[27:11] Dave was talking yesterday I believe God
[27:13] he had a conduit he had a prophet that
[27:16] he could speak to and he spoke to that
[27:20] prophet and through that prophet gave it
[27:22] to me and you and not so that's going to
[27:24] be people in the days of the voice of
[27:26] the seventh angel when he shall begin to
[27:28] sound the mystery of God
[27:30] be finished all right so that's what
[27:33] we're looking at the mystery of God what
[27:35] is God is this God real is this god this
[27:38] is this God that the only way we're
[27:41] going to get it is that God comes down
[27:43] through a funnel called a prophet
[27:45] because remember the brother Ram said I
[27:46] am nothing but a trumpet I am nothing
[27:48] but I'm mute the problem is we kind of
[27:53] try to toot our own trumpet every once
[27:54] in a while
[27:55] and we're not mute like real Adele said
[27:58] we need to shut up listen sometimes
[27:59] instead of doing the talking so brother
[28:01] Branham he listened to God and let God
[28:03] do the speaking and I believe that's
[28:04] what we have to get our perfection comes
[28:07] through the message of the hour the
[28:10] revelation of the message of the hour
[28:12] and then not just the message of the
[28:14] hour and I got a little thought on that
[28:15] in just a minute but let's go back to
[28:17] where we were Sunday and just kind of
[28:19] run through this real quick because we
[28:22] believe that God is a being he is a real
[28:26] person he is not the a myth he is not
[28:29] Casper the Friendly Ghost he's not some
[28:31] some something that that we thought
[28:34] about no he's a real person and and as
[28:37] brother Dale said we know now they lie
[28:39] similarity of even what he looks like
[28:41] Amen so we have we are so fortunate
[28:45] but you see somebody like Abraham he
[28:48] comes up and he's walked in his life and
[28:50] he meets this man named Melchizedek and
[28:52] then he meets Melchizedek I want to tell
[28:55] you this because remember he meets
[28:57] Melchizedek when he's a young man
[28:59] younger then he meets Melchizedek when
[29:02] he's old and I want to tell you
[29:04] something
[29:05] Melchizedek man daddy was talking
[29:07] yesterday Melchizedek listen if I'm
[29:11] coming up to a 99 year old man or 499
[29:14] year old man is sitting in the tent
[29:17] none of year 99 yet just a clearly
[29:21] getting close but at 99 years old as a
[29:26] human being and some old man that looks
[29:29] older than me walks up and says I'm
[29:32] guarding I'm going to change your body
[29:34] now to me you understand what I'm saying
[29:38] but old man walks handed according to
[29:41] the table of life let me sit down a
[29:43] minute
[29:44] I'm going to change your body now
[29:47] Abraham wouldn't have a lot of faith but
[29:51] male calves didn't come walking with two
[29:52] other men to other angels and I believe
[29:56] he was in the prime of his youth and he
[29:58] said Abraham according to the time alive
[30:00] I'm going to come down and I'm going to
[30:03] give you that promise son I'm going to
[30:05] change your body to look like mine
[30:07] because I'm not an old man God never was
[30:10] an old man never will be an old man I
[30:13] can't I don't know we're men man's ideas
[30:17] fathom that God is great bearded
[30:19] stoop-shouldered with a cane come on
[30:22] people good grief God never did get old
[30:27] amen so now we see that he meets
[30:31] Melchizedek which is God in human flesh
[30:34] but not God the Savior God in human
[30:37] flesh the theophany the same one that
[30:40] Moses saw and as we were looking before
[30:43] let's look at that in the Hebrew lexicon
[30:45] when Moses met the pillar fire he met a
[30:49] man because a bush don't talk a bush
[30:56] doesn't talk if a bless talks it's a man
[31:00] hidden in the bush but when you look up
[31:04] this Strong's Concordance
[31:05] that fire that was burning in the bush
[31:08] look like their supernatural fire
[31:11] accompanying theophany so we know that
[31:14] that was the very theophany of God now
[31:17] Moses couldn't see him in that
[31:19] revelation at the point in time of Moses
[31:22] in Revelation he saw a burning bush but
[31:25] he was a he was well learned enough to
[31:28] know and smart enough to realize that
[31:30] that wasn't a normal bush because number
[31:33] one it wasn't consumed and burned up and
[31:36] all that thing's talking to him and he
[31:39] says I am that I am and if you're going
[31:41] to come any closer Moses you need to
[31:43] take his shoes off because you're
[31:45] standing on holy ground so we know
[31:47] exactly who that was that was a pre
[31:50] figure of Jesus Christ mmm are the
[31:53] theophany of God now remember we were
[31:55] talking about it last Sunday
[31:58] Joshua Joshua comes up and he sees or
[32:02] then Moses you see Moses he comes up
[32:04] just leave it right there
[32:05] but remember Moses comes up one dances
[32:07] God I want to see you I saw you the
[32:09] burning bush I saw you do that I saw you
[32:11] do that but I want to really see you he
[32:13] said okay go stand in the rock and I'm
[32:15] going to walk by well he didn't walk him
[32:17] float by the bow he walked by it was a
[32:21] man
[32:22] God always was a man he never was a
[32:27] spook as we want to sometimes we get in
[32:31] our brain that that God's just something
[32:34] that has no substance you realize one
[32:36] thing's for sure whatever this substance
[32:38] you're standing on and this whole
[32:39] universe is made out of came out of that
[32:41] one man he didn't have to go and ask the
[32:44] daddy if he could do it he didn't have
[32:46] to go and ask the Holy Ghost if he could
[32:47] do it he didn't have to go and get a
[32:50] manufacturing plant to manufacture it
[32:52] all came right out of him so did you
[32:57] gosh when he came to pass when Joshua
[33:00] was by Jericho he lifted up his eyes and
[33:01] looked and behold there stood a there
[33:04] stood a spirit no they said a man there
[33:10] stood a man he must have been pretty
[33:13] real and I've been he was old in either
[33:16] I don't believe God ever does never
[33:18] appeared anywhere old Cody never was old
[33:20] behold there stood a man over against
[33:23] him with his sword drawn in his hand he
[33:26] come to do something he didn't have a
[33:29] sword in his any sheath he had to sort
[33:31] out and Joshua went under them and said
[33:33] unto Him art thou for us are you for our
[33:36] adversaries and he said nay but as
[33:39] captain of the host of the capital L Ord
[33:41] am I now come and Joshua fell on his
[33:45] face to the earth and did worship now
[33:47] Joshua is not going to just worship a
[33:50] man that just walks up with a sword
[33:52] wrong he must have had a supernatural
[33:54] revelation who that man was and sent
[33:57] unto him what staff my lord unto his
[33:59] servant and the captain of the Lord's
[34:02] host sent unto Joshua loose tie shoes
[34:04] you ever heard that before that's
[34:06] exactly what the burning bush told Moses
[34:08] loose tie shoes from off thy foot for
[34:11] the
[34:11] place were on thou standest is holy and
[34:14] you know what Joshua didn't have a
[34:16] problem with it
[34:16] Joshua did so so there's Jesus Christ
[34:20] now look not Jesus to flesh but just to
[34:22] back up just a minute for some maybe
[34:24] he's not been here that's not Jesus to
[34:26] flesh Jesus a flesh came 2,000 years ago
[34:29] and man but Jesus Christ created all
[34:33] things according to Colossians 1 Hebrews
[34:35] 1 John 1
[34:36] James was it 3 and 9 Jesus Christ
[34:40] created all things they know he was a
[34:43] creator that's the problem that they
[34:45] have with a Trinity one of the problems
[34:48] that Trinitarians have with the Trinity
[34:50] is that you know some say well the
[34:53] father created the sun and then the sun
[34:55] created all things well then you can't
[34:59] call the father the creator but if you
[35:02] lump them all together you love them all
[35:06] together they created all things Jesus
[35:10] Christ created all things because he was
[35:12] that King theophany he was not something
[35:14] that was a that was a man standing here
[35:17] and then it like brother Dale said
[35:20] there's not going to be a father we're
[35:21] not going to see an old man as a father
[35:23] and then a son and see the whole ego
[35:25] you better not you might see it in a
[35:29] different place but you're not going to
[35:30] see in heaven
[35:31] hello you just might see it if you go to
[35:34] another place but you're not going to
[35:36] see in heaven we're going to see Jesus
[35:37] Christ and know that he is the very
[35:39] embodiment embodiment of the Father he
[35:43] is the father made manifest King
[35:48] theophany I like that because listen
[35:51] anything that comes from him because
[35:54] remember Satan can't create that's one
[35:57] of those things that we're talking about
[35:58] we we use deductive reasoning Satan
[36:01] cannot create so if there's any life
[36:02] that's ever created God creates it and
[36:05] then God created every life God even
[36:09] created at off Hitler's life what we're
[36:12] gonna get into Adolf Hitler the most
[36:15] vile man on the earth anyone you want to
[36:17] talk about that life had to come from
[36:19] Almighty God permitted life because he
[36:23] said
[36:24] multiply and replenish the earth well
[36:26] now we know that he was talking about
[36:28] Genesis 1:26 man that we've been drawn
[36:31] on on the board at Genesis 1:26 man has
[36:34] nothing to do with a sex desire
[36:38] multiplication that's what happened
[36:41] after the fall that's why we believe
[36:42] that the fall was not an apple if not
[36:45] then if we just go to Washington State
[36:47] and buy all the apples and hand them out
[36:49] we'll all go back to being I don't think
[36:51] so but it was act in the garden the guy
[36:56] listing started so will not get into
[36:58] that but we don't believe it was an
[37:00] apple
[37:01] you can't beguile somebody with an apple
[37:04] you understand one thing and the Bible
[37:07] says that you're the fruit of your
[37:08] mother a man so you watch that fruit
[37:11] part it's not a fruit - somebody ate it
[37:13] was what they / - cuff a man and it
[37:16] wasn't an apple but what was it it began
[37:19] a carnal mind that the poor Adam bless
[37:23] his heart he come to a place that he was
[37:27] the ruler of everything every animal
[37:30] obeyed him every tree obeyed him the Sun
[37:35] the Moon the Stars you know they were
[37:37] all up there hanging and the wind would
[37:39] come down into this part of the earth
[37:41] and start blowing and it would blow a
[37:43] little bit too much and Adam would say
[37:45] hold it back just a little cloud you
[37:50] need to move over that way a little bit
[37:51] I want some more sunshine but then all
[37:53] of a sudden one day he comes to a place
[37:57] that that doesn't work anymore he's what
[38:02] he's lost his rulership on the earth now
[38:04] he's not lost his salvation he's not
[38:07] lost his kinship with God I like what
[38:12] her brother said in New Mexico he didn't
[38:13] lose his relationship now sure we know
[38:17] they didn't talk to each other like this
[38:18] but his relate if you're related that's
[38:23] what relationship comes from I'm related
[38:26] to him because I came from him he didn't
[38:29] lose his relationship with God in that
[38:31] form he lost his fellowship that's what
[38:34] we're hot we're coming back to that
[38:36] fellowship
[38:38] we're not losing our relationship I read
[38:40] to you today remember what I said
[38:41] brother mine said Christ did not come to
[38:44] bring you your inheritance your
[38:46] inheritance was before the foundation of
[38:48] the world and man that's your
[38:51] relationship you and God are related if
[38:55] you're born again come on somebody
[38:57] hallelujah
[38:59] you're you totally come from genetics of
[39:02] God if you're born again but right now
[39:07] we're having to deal with my mama and
[39:09] daddy brought us all right so that's
[39:11] where you get you two lives and we'll
[39:12] get into that right here in just a
[39:13] second now let's go to number let's read
[39:16] number one and kind of review just a
[39:18] second skip that other Isaiah 9:6
[39:22] but number one then two months abruptly
[39:24] God said and then no doubt in my mind
[39:28] but that's what Jesus had in his mind
[39:31] when he was here on earth was that
[39:33] infallibility of God's eternal Word for
[39:36] we know that in him dwelt the fullness
[39:38] of the Godhead bodily the entire Godhead
[39:42] was in him he was both Father Son and
[39:45] Holy Ghost but dwelt in a human form the
[39:49] theophany of God the great image of God
[39:52] that he made man in he's throwing it
[39:55] back to us then placed him in the earth
[39:58] he had a body God isn't without a body
[40:02] God's got a body and it looks like a man
[40:05] Moses saw it others saw it and it looks
[40:09] like a man and it's just an impression
[40:12] now here we're going to come down to
[40:13] here with we've talking about Redemption
[40:15] we brought that Genesis 1:26 man there
[40:18] was no way that that Genesis 1:26 man in
[40:21] the Old Testament could go into the soul
[40:23] of an individual now tell you why in
[40:25] just a little while he cannot get into
[40:29] the soul of an individual in an Old
[40:30] Testament why number one the blood of
[40:33] bulls and goats only covered his sin it
[40:36] did not do away with this sin it was
[40:39] what they live by faith but they did not
[40:45] receive the promise we were talking
[40:47] about last night Hebrews 11:40 we always
[40:49] say they without us
[40:51] not being perfect but read verse 39
[40:53] those people in the Old Testament died
[40:57] with a good report that the Messiah was
[41:01] coming they were looking for the Messiah
[41:03] the Messiah was coming but they did not
[41:06] receive the promise what is the great
[41:08] promise that we're all promised repent
[41:11] and be baptized in the name of Jesus
[41:13] Christ for the remission of your sins
[41:15] and you shall receive a promise a gift
[41:19] of the Holy Ghost so they did not
[41:21] receive that gift because the giver had
[41:24] not come and give it to him yet hey man
[41:27] that Genesis 1:26 man was so tied up in
[41:30] that King theophany he had no place to
[41:34] come to and he had no place to land as
[41:37] I'm telling you before leave that up I
[41:39] read it a minute that does clip in the
[41:42] ark when the Dove lands in the ark
[41:46] remember he brings the leaf back most I
[41:51] mean no one knows that there's dry land
[41:53] somewhere but remember he releases the
[41:55] DOE and the Dove doesn't come back
[41:57] he knows that dove landed somewhere well
[42:00] and type that dumb never landed anywhere
[42:02] until he landed in Jesus Christ on the
[42:04] day that God took him to the river and
[42:07] said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm
[42:09] pleased to dwell but what the lamb met
[42:13] the Dove that's what the property God
[42:16] said what the two natures were the same
[42:19] amen listen David was a great man all
[42:25] these were great men but they never
[42:26] received a promise they never received
[42:28] the baptism of the Holy Ghost in their
[42:30] soul there was still something missing
[42:35] and then now this is the plan of garden
[42:38] would you like it or not I'm telling you
[42:40] the plan of God he's actually the way he
[42:42] give it all right so now look and this
[42:47] is just an impression this is of what
[42:50] that is and everything on earth the
[42:53] beauty the sweetness the beauty of the
[42:55] earth is nothing else in the world but
[42:57] an answer to a far better than that that
[43:00] waits on us when we leave this world for
[43:03] everything in Earth is just
[43:04] a pattern of that which is in heaven
[43:06] everything that's good everything that's
[43:09] righteous everything is it's beautiful
[43:11] trees birds everything is just a pattern
[43:13] of what's in heaven our own life it's
[43:16] just a pattern we think so much of this
[43:20] say pamper it make sure it smells good
[43:25] which is great when you're sitting in a
[43:27] group of people make sure it smells good
[43:30] but anyway we and we let the inside man
[43:33] rot come on then we do our own life is
[43:43] just a pattern it's just a shadow and
[43:45] not the real thing
[43:49] listen that's the way we can exist under
[43:54] this condition even the property guard
[43:58] told us he said he said that blood cover
[44:00] and still covers there he said god only
[44:03] hears your voice through the blood
[44:05] because remember this flesh and blood
[44:07] will not inherit the kingdom of God this
[44:10] flesh and blood if he were to come down
[44:12] and judge you by what we're doing right
[44:14] now we'd all have to die and I didn't
[44:16] say was all going to help I said we'd
[44:18] all have to die because this right here
[44:21] cannot make it it has not been redeemed
[44:23] the inside man has been redeemed but not
[44:26] the outside man all right but we're
[44:28] working on it
[44:29] where's Rebecca Atkins he's still word
[44:31] you need to sing that song you need to
[44:34] sing that song next Sunday
[44:38] he's still working on me make me what I
[44:42] ought to be what is that ought to be
[44:43] it's that God son before the fact the
[44:45] real part of you don't you ever think
[44:49] about that one Sam I've seen that song
[44:51] he's still working on me to make me what
[44:53] I ought to be listen I didn't ought to
[44:55] be Samuel and Peggy son I ought to be a
[44:59] son of God and man well I guess that
[45:03] didn't make you happy but it didn't mean
[45:05] it's a shadow and not the real thing
[45:08] it's the negative side it takes death to
[45:12] develop the picture
[45:14] to put us back in the theophany we came
[45:17] from now remember you and I were never
[45:21] let me say it one more time
[45:22] I like it when that thing rings yeah we
[45:27] were never identities in heaven we were
[45:30] never running around up here talking
[45:32] about each other and forget that we were
[45:36] in God we were in his thoughts
[45:39] we weren't in his thoughts we were II
[45:41] thought hey man to put us back in the
[45:48] theophany we came from we came from King
[45:50] theophany one man and then that's our
[45:55] problem now on earth we come from many
[45:57] men you remember what brother Brown said
[45:59] he said your problem is you came from a
[46:01] woman hello your problem is is you came
[46:06] from a woman he said you come from a man
[46:09] cross Jesus he said you will be this way
[46:11] and then when you're born again you're
[46:14] not born again of a woman thank god
[46:18] you're not born again of a woman you're
[46:20] born again of your daddy because then
[46:23] your father is the life that all right
[46:28] to put us back into theophany we came
[46:31] from then in the resurrection we come in
[46:34] his likeness
[46:35] a resurrected body what a beautiful not
[46:38] only beautiful but it's the real solemn
[46:40] truth of God's eternal word that will be
[46:45] like him number two let's go that it's a
[46:47] continuation kind of the entombment 1970
[46:50] 57 excuse me here he goes where did he
[46:55] leave when he left Bible said he
[46:57] ascended he went and preached now this
[46:59] is stop here just a second that all that
[47:03] whole Genesis 1:26 and 27 man I hope you
[47:06] understand we we made a list of what he
[47:08] was but that Genesis 1:26 and 27 is your
[47:11] new birth
[47:13] it is the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[47:16] your soul that burns you out and puts
[47:20] him in ok that's what that Genesis 1:26
[47:27] man that
[47:28] what we lost we're going to read it and
[47:29] who this milk as it we bypassed that why
[47:32] because sin cut us off he ascended he
[47:38] went and preached to the souls that were
[47:40] in prison so when Jesus Christ walked on
[47:42] the earth when Jesus Christ walked on
[47:47] this earth I walked on this earth with
[47:50] him when he said I am the resurrection
[47:57] in the fool
[47:58] watch it preacher when he said I go to
[48:03] him when he said I come from oh we don't
[48:09] want to finish those because we don't
[48:10] kind of believe that if he was King
[48:14] theophany there was no that's the
[48:16] oppening that made any difference to me
[48:17] now it may to you but to me that
[48:20] theophany is eternal life never was
[48:23] judged never had a beginning never will
[48:26] have an ending I want that I want that I
[48:29] didn't come there with that but that's
[48:31] what I want and that's what I believe
[48:34] our God you got to believe it for you
[48:37] right
[48:38] but when Jesus walked the shores of
[48:40] Galilee I walk the story go away with
[48:42] him I'm gonna tell you something I'm
[48:45] gonna tell you something listen the only
[48:47] way you going to understand what we
[48:49] understand in this end time is to have
[48:51] that same man inside of you I've told
[48:56] y'all many many times before God wrote
[49:01] this Bible that great theophany wrote
[49:05] this Bible and if I have part of that
[49:07] great theophany in me that makes me
[49:09] where I can understand this by because
[49:12] you can't understand this Bible without
[49:14] having the one that wrote it inside of
[49:16] you other than that it's just a
[49:18] commentary I preached laughs I'll keep
[49:20] you awake a commentary I mean sure it
[49:23] really is it's just a commentary to most
[49:25] people but to me he wrote that Bible for
[49:28] me not for you no you wrote it for me me
[49:32] you write it for you too man what about
[49:36] that I told you out everything anything
[49:41] we need
[49:41] for the guy here why because he knew
[49:44] when we got here we need it
[49:46] to me that's so simple so when God died
[49:50] at Calvary God died yeah God died his
[49:56] flesh died his soul that Great King
[50:00] theophany you can't kill you can't kill
[50:03] your theophany your theophany can come
[50:06] down in the middle and like I said
[50:07] before of an atomic explosion right in
[50:10] the middle of it you can be holding on
[50:11] to the bomb with your theophany and it
[50:14] would never flow and never do a thing
[50:17] never even you won't even go and never
[50:23] bother you but doing this see what you
[50:28] got two lives for two the life's I won't
[50:32] say lives it's like two life's and we'll
[50:34] get into that in just a second all right
[50:36] all right so when Jesus died he died to
[50:41] take my place and then that King
[50:44] theophany where'd he go he went and
[50:50] preached to the souls that were in
[50:52] prison
[50:52] what is that somewhere in Hebrews I
[50:54] can't remember they might know exactly
[50:56] where did remember he said he went and
[50:58] preached the souls in prison in the
[50:59] long-suffering the days of Noah in other
[51:01] words the people that had died before
[51:03] the flood Christ was going down to say
[51:05] hey I'm the one Noah told you about
[51:07] right all right but what did he go down
[51:10] there in in his flesh know his flesh was
[51:13] up in Israel or Jerusalem laying in a
[51:17] tomb dead in the hammer dead is a hammer
[51:23] there was no life in it because that
[51:25] life had come out at Calvary but what
[51:28] did the property go tell us his soul his
[51:31] spirit his theophany of his own being
[51:34] went down amen so now like I've always
[51:40] told you if you have that part of
[51:43] Genesis 1:26 that theophany inside of
[51:46] you you've already been to hell
[51:51] that throws my soul you've already been
[51:53] to hell you don't have to go twice you
[51:57] went one time he died once for one all
[52:02] he died what's wrong how about them but
[52:05] if we don't accept him me and Joe was
[52:10] talking a few minutes ago
[52:11] brother Brian said well the Bible the
[52:13] hell was created for the devil and his
[52:15] angels right probably God told us he
[52:18] said that hell wasn't even created for
[52:20] human beings hell not created for human
[52:24] beings but if you don't accept Christ
[52:27] that's where you're going you know when
[52:30] they died that brother on cities and
[52:32] whatever the tree whatever wherever it
[52:33] leans and follows that's the way it lays
[52:35] all right amen what a great thing that
[52:38] brother branham's could go across the
[52:39] curtain of time and see a 90 something
[52:41] year old woman that had been converted
[52:42] in his ministry being a real young 20
[52:45] year old lady just skipping and huffing
[52:46] and jumping all over the place how about
[52:49] of what a wonderful thing that this
[52:51] Genesis 1:26 man can do this Genesis 1.6
[52:54] man remember it never had a beginning so
[52:57] it never got old that's why the Prophet
[53:01] could tell us he said God took a picture
[53:03] of you 18 to 20 years old not exactly
[53:06] when you were that here but exactly that
[53:08] theophany the part of the words you are
[53:10] he took that picture in that picture
[53:13] it's burning his memory listen it
[53:17] doesn't matter if you never ever see
[53:18] your children again this is just a
[53:20] natural story if you never ever see your
[53:22] children again you can close your eyes
[53:23] and see them every one why because it's
[53:26] burning your memory of what your
[53:29] children are well same way with Almighty
[53:31] God's they gonna get this up in a minute
[53:32] same way with God there's a picture
[53:34] burning his mind and look this is all
[53:38] permissive this is all permitted by God
[53:40] we're all getting older and God we don't
[53:44] get older and man everybody all right
[53:47] say ma'am we might get hot in a minute
[53:50] that's okay so anyway let's go to number
[53:55] three yeah let's finish that lets go to
[53:59] number three life 1957
[54:02] let's just review this just and watch
[54:04] because what happened on the day of
[54:08] Pentecost God comes down
[54:11] remember God has sins Jesus Christ
[54:14] ascended up alright and he told them to
[54:18] go and he said eleven days later he said
[54:20] you're going to be in dude from power
[54:21] from on high in other words what I'm
[54:23] going to do I'm going to start building
[54:25] the real family that I should have had
[54:27] had there not been a fall I'm the first
[54:29] one of it because in Genesis in
[54:31] revelation 3:14 it says Jesus Christ was
[54:34] the beginning of the creation of God the
[54:36] beginning of the way it should have been
[54:37] had they not been a fall so Christ was
[54:40] the first one remember he was born
[54:41] without sex and then so he was the
[54:44] beginning of the creation of God but you
[54:46] you know one thing's for sure if he had
[54:49] a family
[54:50] he's cutting them thank you hard if he
[54:54] had it you think you're hot be about six
[54:55] eight inches higher and be standing up
[54:59] here throwing arms all over play but if
[55:02] he was the beginning of the creation of
[55:03] God there's got to be a continuation on
[55:06] a part of him that's got to come out if
[55:10] he's going to have a family he can't be
[55:12] alone amen alright so now life 1957 just
[55:19] start with the red and then out of the
[55:21] existence of the father went to logos
[55:23] which was the son which is happening we
[55:25] broke that on the board but remember he
[55:28] wasn't just a light he always was a
[55:30] human being always was a human being now
[55:35] in his development of what seeing him
[55:37] like Moses saw him in a burning bush but
[55:41] bringing it to our revelation that we
[55:43] see now in the end time God never was a
[55:46] cloud oh yeah he was a cloud that cloud
[55:51] hid him that pillar of cloud hid who was
[55:57] in what you think we follow a cloud I
[56:01] follow well you come at the cloud you
[56:03] say well you do follow a cloud I follow
[56:05] what was in the cloud and man follow
[56:09] what was in that cloud which was the
[56:11] theophany which was the body of the
[56:13] great Jehovah God went forth into
[56:16] a celestial body in they select your
[56:18] body that's the logos the word spoke out
[56:21] of them great fountains of life and went
[56:23] forth and there was the theophany which
[56:25] was God made into word then that
[56:28] theophany was made flesh in the person
[56:30] Christ Jesus and then all the fullness
[56:33] of the Trinity dwelt in him both Father
[56:35] Son and Holy Spirit all in that and
[56:37] that's the very way we go plumb back to
[56:42] the original beginning of God there we
[56:46] are born again not a flesh born again
[56:50] not of blood but born again by the
[56:52] spirit and in that eternal spirit of
[56:55] love and honesty comes down to make its
[56:57] place in us and then when we die from
[57:02] this life we go into the body if this
[57:04] earthly body is dissolved we have a
[57:06] theophany to go into a body celestial
[57:09] now let's stop right there because
[57:11] remember we don't believe in this church
[57:14] maybe some other churches believe it but
[57:16] we don't believe that I've got some kind
[57:18] of a soul or some kind of a celestial
[57:21] body hanging up on in the closet like
[57:24] this until I if I were to pass away then
[57:28] then you know whatever dies down here
[57:31] comes and comes in isn't it know you are
[57:36] who you are right here you are who you
[57:40] are right here you don't have a
[57:43] theophany to go to you are if the often
[57:47] your soul is your theophany and like I
[57:50] said it's not just one little spot might
[57:52] be opening if it stepped over like this
[57:56] it scare you to death because I'd be 20
[57:58] years old but it would be me
[58:00] it wouldn't be bro Kali wouldn't be
[58:04] brother dining it'd be me that's who I
[58:07] am that's my exist it but watch then at
[58:14] the coming of the Lord Jesus
[58:15] this body is picked up from the earth
[58:18] again
[58:18] what salt brother was going to get a new
[58:20] body we are go getting you buddy we're
[58:25] all a new creation right
[58:27] but is this earth going to be destroyed
[58:30] or just going to be burnt over I'm
[58:35] telling you people it'd be really easy
[58:37] for God to just give us a new body but
[58:41] it's not part of redemption that is not
[58:43] part of redemption part of redemption is
[58:46] is that this old man was lost right here
[58:49] this old man was lost God comes and
[58:54] burns inside out he will I exit he
[58:57] enters and then if something happens to
[59:02] this he's going to pick this back up
[59:05] again did Jesus have another body nobody
[59:10] died a new body a man the gardener they
[59:14] taught it with the gardener he done
[59:15] turned back to a young man well you know
[59:17] that's I'll get on that later on then at
[59:21] the coming of the Lord this body is
[59:23] picked up from the earth again and made
[59:25] in a glorified state to live in his
[59:27] presence forever then all the perversion
[59:29] all the things that was in the
[59:30] perversion all goes out of existence all
[59:34] right let's continue reading because I
[59:35] get a hurry number 4 now this is just
[59:40] just to give you a punctuation here on
[59:42] number 4 Hebrews chapter 3 1957 go down
[59:44] to the bottom the difference between an
[59:46] animal and a man God put a soul in a man
[59:48] and he didn't put it in the animal
[59:50] because the soul that was in the man is
[59:53] that theophany amen the soul that he
[59:56] gave you is your theophany because
[59:59] remember when he went preached to the
[1:00:02] what souls that were in Hell they were
[1:00:04] sold they were in their theophany they
[1:00:08] just didn't have a glorified anything
[1:00:12] okay the difference between animal and
[1:00:16] man God put a soul in the man listen
[1:00:18] animals are not going to be judged
[1:00:20] the reason we're judged is because you
[1:00:23] know right from wrong the dog don't know
[1:00:26] right from wrong why do you think they
[1:00:27] keep getting killed on the streets why
[1:00:29] do you think think that things happen to
[1:00:30] animals that doesn't happen to man but
[1:00:34] the greatest thing man
[1:00:35] that God I told you the greatest love
[1:00:37] that God could give us is water free
[1:00:39] choice
[1:00:40] right if not we would just be we would
[1:00:43] just be Jesus zombies no we have a free
[1:00:51] will we have a free choice to choose or
[1:00:53] not choose we have a free choice even
[1:00:55] after we're born again to choose and not
[1:00:58] you brother Brian said runs until the
[1:01:00] day we pass away we have a choice hey
[1:01:03] man so we're all on free moral agency
[1:01:05] but what a love of God to give us a
[1:01:07] choice what he did is give me a chance
[1:01:11] there's my chance to get back to where I
[1:01:14] was before hey man 2 lives we may not
[1:01:20] get to it today either number five all
[1:01:24] right look let's just read the read that
[1:01:28] life that begins not nothing along here
[1:01:32] but all the way up there eternal life
[1:01:36] zowie God's own life comes down and
[1:01:39] dwells in the man and he is eternal with
[1:01:43] God and can't die that's what the word
[1:01:47] said just think of it is there to
[1:01:49] eternal life you couldn't answer that
[1:01:51] could you there is one eternal life and
[1:01:54] that is the life of God that's why we
[1:01:58] don't believe in eternal hell there's no
[1:01:59] such things in eternal hell hell never
[1:02:02] was a part of eternal hell was created
[1:02:06] oh yeah the Bible says you'll burn
[1:02:08] forever and ever sure there is an
[1:02:10] eternal judgment though hey man there's
[1:02:13] an eternal judgment cuz once you're
[1:02:14] judged it's pretty eternity now you're
[1:02:18] not going to live from eternity because
[1:02:19] you'd have to have eternal life
[1:02:21] see that's to to me that's the great
[1:02:23] thing that the Prophet came to tell us
[1:02:24] because let if you have an eternal hell
[1:02:27] then God's got to be there and listen it
[1:02:29] would belittle my eternal life what kind
[1:02:34] of you got to think about that I'm a
[1:02:37] special guy because God gave me eternal
[1:02:39] life to live forever and ever never
[1:02:42] never eternity without a problem he
[1:02:46] can't give that to them people that
[1:02:48] turned him down he can't give that's why
[1:02:50] there's two lifes okay
[1:02:54] you're going to leave here with one of
[1:02:56] the other you can't leave here with both
[1:02:58] of them alright we'll read it in a
[1:03:01] minute just think of it is there to
[1:03:05] eternal life you couldn't answer that
[1:03:06] could there is one eternal life and
[1:03:09] that's the life of God this other kind
[1:03:12] of life no matter what it is it's gotten
[1:03:15] into it and anything that had a
[1:03:19] beginning has an end but anything that
[1:03:22] had no beginning has no end and God said
[1:03:25] he would give us eternal life without
[1:03:27] beginning we were just made a part of
[1:03:31] him that's that Genesis 1:26 man and
[1:03:35] actually the life that's in us wasn't
[1:03:38] brought here by human nature now he's
[1:03:44] talking about capital L IFE he ain't
[1:03:48] about just regular life because regular
[1:03:52] life was brought here by them right now
[1:03:55] actually the life that's in us they come
[1:03:57] in eternal life wasn't brought here by
[1:03:59] human nature nature give us a spirit
[1:04:03] but that spirit died and we got the
[1:04:05] Spirit of God glory to God was gone a
[1:04:09] man certainly let us make man in our own
[1:04:11] image what was God up theophany a body
[1:04:13] and there man was made like that and put
[1:04:16] over the garden but there was no matter
[1:04:18] till the soil in the senses then he
[1:04:20] created man out of the dust of the earth
[1:04:21] the animal life and then that man that
[1:04:23] till the soul and the man fell by
[1:04:25] transgression correctly and God the
[1:04:28] theophany
[1:04:29] came down and was made flesh and dwelt
[1:04:31] among us to redeem man so it's nothing
[1:04:35] you could do you're a sinner to start
[1:04:38] with you're shaped in iniquity you're
[1:04:40] born in sin come to the world speaking
[1:04:43] lives you were born here in this world
[1:04:45] by sexual desire of your father and
[1:04:47] mother and you're just as hellbound as
[1:04:50] you can be a pre plain in it I don't
[1:04:54] care what you do you might never life
[1:04:56] still keep every commandment and
[1:04:59] everything else and you'll go to hell
[1:05:01] like a Marten to its box but the only
[1:05:04] way that you ever can live again is to
[1:05:07] that's the Holy Spirit God's eternal
[1:05:10] life that's why Jesus said you must be
[1:05:14] born again
[1:05:16] that's why the new birth is a new birth
[1:05:19] of a new life inside of you you got a
[1:05:23] birth life when you got here
[1:05:25] that's one life you got a life and it
[1:05:29] comes from God
[1:05:30] it comes from God permitted and pure but
[1:05:36] the property God said was born in sin
[1:05:37] while we came the wrong way
[1:05:40] that's what Jesus was telling Nicodemus
[1:05:42] he said Nicodemus what do you talk about
[1:05:44] going back to your mother's womb in
[1:05:45] other words that was the warning it was
[1:05:47] wrong you must be born from above not in
[1:05:51] a hospital or by midwives you must be
[1:05:53] born from above amen what made you what
[1:05:57] you are in the beginning when the Holy
[1:06:00] Ghost britta'd over the earth there
[1:06:02] wasn't nothing but volcanic eruption a
[1:06:03] little Easter flower come up God said
[1:06:06] that looks pretty good
[1:06:07] just keep breathing flowers come up
[1:06:09] grass comes up trees comes up bird flew
[1:06:11] out of the dust animals came up a man
[1:06:14] came up man
[1:06:16] the highest form now look look let's get
[1:06:18] let's go to number six we're still not
[1:06:21] gonna get to where hit the two lines now
[1:06:23] look but we're going to start right here
[1:06:26] this the questions and answers 1957 he
[1:06:30] has a spirit in him a man does when he's
[1:06:34] born because it's the spirit of nature
[1:06:37] it's a spirit of the world it's a spirit
[1:06:41] of the god of this world he has merely
[1:06:44] an offspring of Adam remember Adams when
[1:06:47] it sold us out Eve did Adam sold us out
[1:06:49] and then a tree reproduces itself
[1:06:53] vegetation reproduces itself animals
[1:06:56] reproduce themselves humans reproduce
[1:06:58] themselves they are the byproduct of the
[1:07:01] original creation get it now now when a
[1:07:04] man is born he's born with a spirit in
[1:07:06] him of this world that's the reason he
[1:07:10] has to be born again for this spirit
[1:07:13] come from the conception of father and
[1:07:16] mother which was the sexual conception
[1:07:18] and absolutely
[1:07:20] not live forever remember in Adam all
[1:07:24] die alright so he has got to be born
[1:07:28] again and before he could do that God
[1:07:31] had to come down and make a way for him
[1:07:33] to be born again because he had no way
[1:07:36] to redeem himself he was without hope we
[1:07:41] were without hope he was without hope
[1:07:43] without God without Christ in the world
[1:07:45] lost and gone there's nothing you can do
[1:07:48] listen there's nothing to do save
[1:07:49] yourself like I said last Sunday you can
[1:07:51] sit there and you can you can make you a
[1:07:53] list of do's and dont's that's good
[1:07:56] that's just a good neighbor God don't
[1:07:59] have a list of do's and dont's he said
[1:08:01] you must be born again
[1:08:03] amen to me that makes it simple it would
[1:08:08] be very not simple if I was to do's and
[1:08:09] dont's that's what the Catholic Church's
[1:08:11] do's and dont's everybody do this don't
[1:08:13] be different and then when we come into
[1:08:14] message you do this don't do that skirt
[1:08:16] go be this long you can't cut your hair
[1:08:18] you can't wear this can't do this can't
[1:08:20] can't can't can't can't
[1:08:21] Peter said repent Peter said repent
[1:08:25] that's our problem we don't repent we'll
[1:08:27] come sit down in the message pew and we
[1:08:29] still have that same old devil we had
[1:08:30] when we brought in we just don't repent
[1:08:32] but if we repent and be baptized in the
[1:08:35] name of Jesus Christ with remission he
[1:08:36] says you shall receive the gift of the
[1:08:38] Holy Ghost which will turn you back to
[1:08:40] the Bible which will turn you back to
[1:08:42] that great theophany and you'll do what
[1:08:44] he tells you to do that to me that's
[1:08:48] more simple than saying do this and on
[1:08:50] to that number seven thirsting for life
[1:08:52] now when God was in theophany which was
[1:08:55] Christ in the making then that the often
[1:08:58] he became flesh and dwelt among us then
[1:09:01] that was to redeem he came from there
[1:09:05] down through this to redeem this
[1:09:08] creature give it life and take it back
[1:09:11] up into the eternal one amen now there's
[1:09:16] only one eternal life and that lays in
[1:09:19] God alone and God only has eternal life
[1:09:22] and we have been privileged to become
[1:09:25] the sons of God then that word he hears
[1:09:28] my word and believeth on him that sent
[1:09:30] me hath eternal life
[1:09:31] the greek word zoe they're used for
[1:09:33] god's own
[1:09:34] the creature that accepts him becomes a
[1:09:36] part of God and as just as eternal as
[1:09:40] God is that's right there's no reason
[1:09:42] for us to doubt that it's God's
[1:09:46] everlasting Eternal Word and everything
[1:09:49] that had a beginning has an end so what
[1:09:51] where did sin begin sin began in the
[1:09:55] Garden of Eden
[1:09:56] and sin has an end thank God so if David
[1:10:00] cried o Lord my God my soul is thirsting
[1:10:03] for the in the dry land where no water
[1:10:04] is for thy loving-kindness is better
[1:10:07] than me in life there must be two
[1:10:10] different types of life and there is two
[1:10:14] types of life we finally going to get to
[1:10:17] that quote and when a man is born in
[1:10:20] this world he's nothing but a product of
[1:10:23] sin when he's born because he's from
[1:10:26] sexual desire he's just a product of sin
[1:10:30] the Bible says so he's born in sin
[1:10:32] shaped and iniquity come to the world
[1:10:34] speaking lies and yet he's got life but
[1:10:37] that life is a perverted life now you
[1:10:39] see you have to stop hearing you got to
[1:10:41] take that onion feeling you got to go
[1:10:43] through your your Holy Ghost filter
[1:10:45] because God didn't give you a perverted
[1:10:48] life he gave you life you decide whether
[1:10:52] it stays that way or not because
[1:10:54] remember there's a Adamic nature
[1:10:56] attached to you and that's what that's
[1:10:59] what keeps you the way you are born in
[1:11:02] sin shaping an iniquity and all these
[1:11:03] things but there's a way out Satan
[1:11:06] cannot create life
[1:11:07] he can only pervert what God has created
[1:11:10] Satan has no way there's only one
[1:11:13] creator and that's God putting Satan
[1:11:15] can't heal medicine can't heal there's
[1:11:17] nothing else can heal but God because
[1:11:19] he's the only creator and anybody that's
[1:11:21] intelligent with know enough to know
[1:11:23] that there is not a medicine or a drug
[1:11:25] or nothing in the world that can create
[1:11:27] life God is the only solemn one can in
[1:11:31] creation alone for he said I am the Lord
[1:11:35] that healeth all thy diseases now look
[1:11:37] this right here we may stop around here
[1:11:39] just for time I don't want to take too
[1:11:41] much time now we see the different types
[1:11:43] of life listen this that's the reason
[1:11:47] that this man
[1:11:48] born as a product of Adam which was a
[1:11:51] product of sin from listening to his
[1:11:53] wife and the wife was a product of sin
[1:11:56] come from Satan now she didn't come from
[1:11:58] Satan
[1:11:59] she accepted Satan's lie everybody got
[1:12:01] that okay I knew you did you know some
[1:12:04] some don't and Adam followed his wife
[1:12:07] out a perfect type of Christ going with
[1:12:10] his de bribe to take her sins as Adam
[1:12:13] took the sins of even left the Garden of
[1:12:15] Eden not deceived but willingly walked
[1:12:17] out with her so was Christ not to see
[1:12:20] Satan could not deceive him if thou be
[1:12:23] the Son of God he knew that he was but
[1:12:25] he deliberately walked out into sin for
[1:12:28] the church he's our sin bearer and now
[1:12:31] everything that come out of that cycle
[1:12:33] of eternal life when that goes back into
[1:12:36] its cycle again into that ceaseless
[1:12:39] eternity look at this not one shape form
[1:12:43] of sin in any way will ever enter now
[1:12:47] here's one baptist preacher that
[1:12:48] believes in holiness notice that has got
[1:12:51] to be cleansed that person cannot
[1:12:54] person's got to be cleanse and there's
[1:12:57] only one thing that can cleanse them
[1:13:00] that's the blood of Jesus Christ nothing
[1:13:04] else can do it nothing else everybody
[1:13:08] got that saying man let's skip down to
[1:13:12] number 10 brother Joe let's let's skip a
[1:13:15] little bit number 10 go to number 10
[1:13:18] questions and answers on Hebrews watch a
[1:13:22] little old baby not over higher than
[1:13:23] that just get so mad he'll just wring
[1:13:25] his hands turn red in the face and hold
[1:13:27] his breath I've seen some adults do that
[1:13:31] sure what is it is his nature he got it
[1:13:34] from his Pappy or his mammy one she had
[1:13:37] enough temper to fight a buzzsaw or his
[1:13:39] daddy if they didn't his grandfather
[1:13:41] grandmother did see its offspring so
[1:13:44] that makes you're born in the world you
[1:13:46] came by nature and your whole being is
[1:13:49] black and smutty and damned and cursed
[1:13:54] and going to hell
[1:13:55] amen
[1:13:57] that's right but when you're born again
[1:14:02] then the light of God shines down into
[1:14:05] that soul hallelujah then it's no more a
[1:14:08] dark Valley but it's a valley with a
[1:14:10] shadow in it amen
[1:14:13] you may be veiled here with the flashing
[1:14:15] with the things known by faith but
[1:14:16] there's enough light in there and
[1:14:18] someday that light in darkness has to
[1:14:21] separate and when the light shines
[1:14:23] darkness flees and when we go to be with
[1:14:25] Christ in that body darkness and death
[1:14:27] vanishes and we burst out into the
[1:14:30] perfect light glory to God there you are
[1:14:32] no more sickness no more dark mixed with
[1:14:35] it all right let's read the next number
[1:14:39] eleven then we'll make a few comments
[1:14:40] we'll stop right here and will we finish
[1:14:42] this next Sunday what do we do well my
[1:14:45] dear sainted brother dear Saint his
[1:14:47] sister before the foundation of the
[1:14:48] world when God created you in His image
[1:14:51] or created the man in His image and
[1:14:54] created the woman in His image for the
[1:14:57] man for the glory of the man he made you
[1:15:00] a theophany
[1:15:01] just like himself now look this I'm
[1:15:06] taking your now back because we're going
[1:15:07] to go back and I'm going to bring you
[1:15:09] back to the present day
[1:15:11] all right when he said led us to the
[1:15:13] creatures that he had made let us make
[1:15:15] man in our own image a theophany God had
[1:15:18] never become flesh yet he was in a
[1:15:20] theophany all right let's stop right
[1:15:23] there so what did it he made you a
[1:15:25] theophany just like himself you think
[1:15:27] well now brother bottom saying well now
[1:15:29] we were all a bunch of theophanies no
[1:15:32] now we're made in the image of that man
[1:15:36] we were preserved in him we were
[1:15:40] selected by what I have always said you
[1:15:43] know we believe in election I believe in
[1:15:46] election you believe in election right
[1:15:47] man told me one time a brother Larry he
[1:15:51] said he said you know what election is
[1:15:54] he said you got a vote he said God voted
[1:15:57] for you Satan voted against you you
[1:16:01] swing the boat and man it's going to be
[1:16:05] two-to-one one way or the other so
[1:16:06] there's to me his election Got News what
[1:16:08] you would do
[1:16:09] he always wanted to save you Satan
[1:16:12] always wanted to kill you but then he
[1:16:14] put this all down in free moral agency
[1:16:16] but that Genesis 1:26 man let's do this
[1:16:19] real quick cuz we got communion in the
[1:16:20] tale that Genesis 1:26 man is so
[1:16:23] important listen to what he does I want
[1:16:27] to read this the last one brother Joe if
[1:16:30] you got if you want to pull that one up
[1:16:32] that we looked at including this is in
[1:16:34] 1951 listen to this because I don't
[1:16:39] think we realize what the new Burke does
[1:16:41] for us and you may have it and not
[1:16:45] realize what it's doing for you but when
[1:16:47] I got it I realize what it did for me
[1:16:50] because I was telling them downstairs
[1:16:52] and listen we have an open Communion
[1:16:55] that's fine we do but the Bible says if
[1:16:59] you take that communion and you have
[1:17:00] problems and things in your life if
[1:17:03] you're not a born-again Christian you
[1:17:04] should never take communion I'm talking
[1:17:07] about born-again I'm talking about and
[1:17:09] here we go with a lift no smoking
[1:17:10] drinking cussing running around you you
[1:17:14] understand one time but you got to know
[1:17:16] inside yourself that you're not doing
[1:17:20] that you got to know inside yourself
[1:17:23] that that's not a part of you anymore
[1:17:24] because watch this right here watch this
[1:17:27] we know we were born with a nature
[1:17:29] contrary to God right I just told you
[1:17:31] that right we were born with a nature
[1:17:33] that was attached to our soul our
[1:17:35] theophany on who we are it made me do
[1:17:39] things that I shouldn't be doing oh
[1:17:42] y'all didn't oh well I don't need to
[1:17:48] preach in the morning
[1:17:49] if y'all maybe I'm just for me we all
[1:17:54] had problems alright I love this I was
[1:18:01] just I was looking for something the
[1:18:02] other day and saw this but watch roll it
[1:18:06] down just just now looks like it was a
[1:18:08] fire now watch he's coming back the
[1:18:11] pillar fire now looks like there you go
[1:18:14] now looks like if it was fire it would
[1:18:17] have scorched the bush or burned it now
[1:18:20] here let me tell you something before
[1:18:21] you read that look back over at me
[1:18:22] brother Brian said you could receive the
[1:18:24] baptism of the Holy Ghost on your spirit
[1:18:26] every day of your life and don't go to
[1:18:28] hell
[1:18:28] why you never had that old nature burn
[1:18:32] off in your soul right what but it was a
[1:18:37] supernatural fire who could burn the
[1:18:40] bush and yet it would still be there
[1:18:43] amen I'm thankful tonight for a
[1:18:45] supernatural the Holy Spirit God's flame
[1:18:50] of fire who could come down into the
[1:18:53] human heart not not this human heart not
[1:18:56] this you know your being who you are
[1:19:03] burn out all the sin unbelief don't harm
[1:19:07] the person but it purges him makes him
[1:19:10] grow greater be stronger more faith and
[1:19:13] he comes tonight in that way listen he
[1:19:15] can come down into a human body drive
[1:19:18] out the power of cancer tumor cataract
[1:19:21] tuberculosis with fire heavenly Holy
[1:19:24] Spirit fire falling from God out of
[1:19:26] heaven while my box no mystery if he can
[1:19:31] burn in bread sent out how much more can
[1:19:37] he burn cancer out by the same Holy
[1:19:39] Ghost
[1:19:40] we've got witness on both sides watching
[1:19:42] a harlot walking on the street immoral
[1:19:45] hardly maybe a decent person to look at
[1:19:48] the Holy Spirit can take that same woman
[1:19:51] and make a saint out of her took the
[1:19:54] desire of sin I love that brother
[1:19:59] branham own when he says in bread twice
[1:20:00] and one of them's right here he said if
[1:20:03] he can take him in bread what your
[1:20:06] natural life the sin that
[1:20:10] taxi or natural because remember you
[1:20:13] don't em breathe in God
[1:20:16] we're bred from one man King theophany
[1:20:20] he's talking about our old inbred what
[1:20:23] we have down here this life if he can
[1:20:27] what if he can burn inbred sin out how
[1:20:31] much more can you burn cancer out by the
[1:20:33] same Holy Spirit there's your new birth
[1:20:36] that's when it goes down into your soul
[1:20:38] and your being changes don't tell me you
[1:20:43] can do what you used to do and still
[1:20:44] have the holy go sure we have problem
[1:20:49] sure we have things in life but what
[1:20:52] happens if we're still doing the little
[1:20:54] things like Genesis 1:26 man doesn't
[1:20:59] just he just doesn't take the fire burn
[1:21:02] it out he puts a new man in there he
[1:21:06] puts a new life that means you're a
[1:21:08] born-again you started a new born baby
[1:21:14] in Christ desiring the sin sell milk of
[1:21:19] the word now like milk I loved it when I
[1:21:23] was a baby I like beans and potatoes but
[1:21:27] now I like me so we got to grow up in
[1:21:30] God the man but that's what my Holy
[1:21:35] Ghost done for me because if you still
[1:21:38] got inbred sin you don't have God in
[1:21:41] there so that's our problem to start
[1:21:44] with is the Embree ting down here the
[1:21:47] carnal mind and all the things but when
[1:21:49] he burns that out and puts the Holy
[1:21:52] Ghost inside then guess what you are you
[1:21:55] are privileged to take the communion it
[1:22:01] is an honor to be able to protect a
[1:22:03] communion you say well I got this I got
[1:22:05] this I got this if God gives you
[1:22:12] opportunity to make it right you need to
[1:22:14] make a run because when you come to take
[1:22:19] a communion it says that you would even
[1:22:20] you would even die
[1:22:24] if you took it wrong you would even die
[1:22:27] if you took it wrong so if you don't
[1:22:31] know that you got the baptism of the
[1:22:32] Holy Ghost in your soul and that
[1:22:34] Umbridge sin that your mom and daddy
[1:22:36] gave you by nature if that's not burn
[1:22:38] out of you and you still doing some
[1:22:40] things like brother Dale said and I
[1:22:41] agree 100%
[1:22:43] who you think you're getting away with
[1:22:44] by doing these things in the closet or
[1:22:45] doing these things at your home how do
[1:22:47] you think you getting by with that oh
[1:22:49] the preacher don't see me well the Holy
[1:22:54] Ghost does if you'll let him burn that
[1:22:58] out you won't do it any more things I
[1:23:02] used to do I'd do them tomorrow
[1:23:05] amen that to me it's why this church
[1:23:10] stands that if we can get everybody born
[1:23:12] again you don't have to preach hair and
[1:23:14] dress you don't have to preach you got
[1:23:16] to come to church you don't have to
[1:23:17] preach and I don't mean it's a waste of
[1:23:20] time but it's a waste of time
[1:23:24] why is it you say it's a waste time yeah
[1:23:27] you can get a sister born-again she's
[1:23:28] just going to go home and do it hide put
[1:23:32] a little less on cut a little this hair
[1:23:34] right if you ever get her born again I
[1:23:37] don't have to worry about Jim now
[1:23:39] sometimes you have to look at their
[1:23:40] clothes all of us have to look the
[1:23:41] clothes some of you men need to do that
[1:23:42] yourself look at your sisters and go
[1:23:45] honey you can't see what I see from back
[1:23:47] here but that's a little tight
[1:23:49] that's encouragement but I don't have to
[1:23:52] tell you now say now you'll cut your
[1:23:54] hair today they need my pair of scissors
[1:23:58] in my bathroom I don't think see what I
[1:24:01] mean I don't have to worry about that
[1:24:03] why this Jesus that bother you that if
[1:24:07] you took a pair of scissors and laid
[1:24:08] them right next to your long hair you
[1:24:10] know what they would be nothing and
[1:24:12] Jenny's Scoggins soul that would reach
[1:24:18] and get them scissors and go to hell
[1:24:19] right why because that inbred part that
[1:24:22] says well it's okay to do that it's
[1:24:24] alright just trim a little here just put
[1:24:27] the loan here you get that inbred sin
[1:24:30] burn out I promise you I'll promise you
[1:24:33] because remember the things I used to do
[1:24:35] I know I did them
[1:24:37] and I liked it I don't do them no more
[1:24:41] because I don't like them anymore I see
[1:24:44] the results and God forbid if he's going
[1:24:48] to come down die for me go back up come
[1:24:51] back and burn this old thing out put him
[1:24:55] inside why would I want to do anything
[1:24:59] else why would I want to and listen we
[1:25:02] make mistakes obviously we all make
[1:25:04] mistakes
[1:25:05] but God forgive me real quick God
[1:25:08] forgive me forgive me for thinking that
[1:25:11] but you ain't got to worry I'm you know
[1:25:14] man josh is going to go build a a
[1:25:15] playhouse for denim kids did you know if
[1:25:19] you were all standing around there if I
[1:25:20] hit my finger now you wouldn't hear me
[1:25:22] say something that you wouldn't want me
[1:25:23] to say why cuz it's not fair anymore
[1:25:26] don't think that I'm not gonna think it
[1:25:30] we can't help the birds they fly
[1:25:33] overhead but used to there was nothing
[1:25:36] to stop it to come from here to here but
[1:25:39] now that that inbred parts been burnt
[1:25:41] out that old Adamic nature that old
[1:25:45] nature we used to have it's dead it's
[1:25:48] dead what our problem is is we just move
[1:25:50] it over when the preachers here and then
[1:25:56] we open the closet and bring it back out
[1:25:57] when he leaves you know what the
[1:26:00] property guards did he says you can't
[1:26:01] even divorce it he said it's got to be
[1:26:04] dead you can't marry another man sisters
[1:26:08] unless your first husband is dead you
[1:26:12] can't marry Jesus Christ until your
[1:26:15] first husband is dead he's got to be DEA
[1:26:19] D
[1:26:20] dead by the fire of God you can't kill
[1:26:24] it but by the fire God he can a man
[1:26:26] let's stand to our feet the full effect
[1:26:32] of the fall what was the full of back to
[1:26:34] the fall to get God down here so he can
[1:26:37] reveal itself and take us back he didn't
[1:26:41] leave us he went like he sent us out in
[1:26:42] the spaceship and said whoops we got a
[1:26:44] problem guys oh let's just keep letting
[1:26:46] too long no he said we got a problem
[1:26:49] and I'm going to fix it I said I'm going
[1:26:52] to fix it because those are my children
[1:26:54] what would we not do for our own kids
[1:26:56] we'd give our life for own kids and
[1:26:59] that's exactly what it did at Calvary He
[1:27:01] gave His life so that we can have
[1:27:03] eternal life and that we can even if we
[1:27:06] have to pass away we're not dead
[1:27:09] I died in Christ 15 years at 16 years
[1:27:13] ago sister Clete has been dead for years
[1:27:17] right that all nature once you get on
[1:27:20] that once it's dead it's dead she's a
[1:27:23] new creature or a new creation in Christ
[1:27:26] Jesus that's our problem
[1:27:27] I don't think we really see what that
[1:27:30] new birth does to us if it does we
[1:27:33] wouldn't act sometimes by the way we do
[1:27:35] so let's bow our heads the Lord Jesus we
[1:27:39] delivered what we think was your word to
[1:27:46] the people now I pray that it would burn
[1:27:52] deep into their soul as we come to this
[1:27:56] time of taking communion the Bible does
[1:27:59] tell us that there's weak and sickly
[1:28:01] among us and many sleep because we don't
[1:28:03] take the communion with all that inbred
[1:28:06] sin burn out Lord we stand here today no
[1:28:18] one did you're president you're not
[1:28:22] somewhere else you're right here we pray
[1:28:27] that as we continue in and get ready to
[1:28:31] protect this communion that you would
[1:28:33] change lives forgive me of my sins in my
[1:28:37] faults Lauren forgive me other mistakes
[1:28:39] that I make and sometimes the dilatory
[1:28:42] attitude that I have towards you that I
[1:28:44] do other things instead of studying or
[1:28:47] praying or doing the things I should be
[1:28:48] doing for you Lord just forgive me of
[1:28:50] that pray this you just deal with us now
[1:28:57] this is a solemn time this should not be
[1:29:00] taken lightly
[1:29:01] it should be taken with reverence you
[1:29:04] said you would never you would not drink
[1:29:06] of this fruit of the vine or eat with us
[1:29:10] until we come into the kingdom here we
[1:29:15] are getting close Lord and today we've
[1:29:18] come to a time for we're going to as we
[1:29:22] say as humans simulate the body and
[1:29:25] blood of you that died at Calvary but I
[1:29:31] know what it does to me every month it
[1:29:33] reminds me to check out it reminds me to
[1:29:39] look in that mirror and look and see if
[1:29:43] I've done anything wrong lord I ask you
[1:29:45] to forgive me I ask you to forgive the
[1:29:48] people here Lord with anything wrong
[1:29:50] Lord if they need the baptism of the
[1:29:52] Holy Ghost just come in and burn them
[1:29:54] out give them a good killing Lord
[1:29:59] because truly truly that's what you want
[1:30:04] to do you want to do that you want to
[1:30:06] give us eternal life more than we want
[1:30:09] it and that's sad that some will turn it
[1:30:11] down but glorious that others will
[1:30:14] partake of it and come into this life
[1:30:17] eternal come into this family of God
[1:30:18] this Genesis 1:26 man that will live on
[1:30:21] when all when all the bill gates and
[1:30:24] when all the rich men of the world are
[1:30:26] dead and gone monies burn up like ash
[1:30:32] we'll be walking on the streets of gold
[1:30:35] never to die again never to be sick
[1:30:38] again never to have a bad thought or a
[1:30:41] bad headache never to have trials and
[1:30:44] tribulations of this life and Lord I
[1:30:47] believe even now that sometimes you do
[1:30:50] raise us up into a place to where we can
[1:30:52] sometimes feel a little that feel your
[1:30:56] presence know that eternity is not
[1:30:58] somewhere that we have to go up to
[1:31:01] heaven to get you brought eternity right
[1:31:03] down here you walked on this earth in
[1:31:06] these dimensions with eternal life and
[1:31:09] you said you would not leave us or
[1:31:11] forsake us that you would come back and
[1:31:13] that you would not only be with us but
[1:31:15] you would be in us till the end of the
[1:31:18] age and then we're going to come back
[1:31:20] down here and live for an eternity
[1:31:21] Father I pray that you'd be with each
[1:31:23] one we were the ones that are traveling
[1:31:25] we've got many many on the highways and
[1:31:27] knowing that many people will be

[1:38:13] what a great testimonies that can be
[1:38:16] given by mankind and the things about a
[1:38:19] great eternal God because he's real and
[1:38:24] he's great a man till wait how much you
[1:38:26] appreciate the message he's like turning
[1:38:29] your scriptures turned to 1st
[1:38:31] Corinthians 11 verse 23 for I have
[1:38:35] received of the Lord that which also I
[1:38:37] delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus
[1:38:39] the same night in which he was betrayed
[1:38:41] took bread and when he had given thanks
[1:38:43] he brake it and said take eat this is my
[1:38:46] body which is broken for you this do in
[1:38:49] remembrance of me after the same manner
[1:38:51] also he took the cup when he had supped
[1:38:53] saying this cup is in your Testament in
[1:38:56] my blood this do ye as oft as you drink
[1:38:59] it in remembrance of me for as often as
[1:39:02] you eat this bread and drink this cup
[1:39:03] you do shew the Lord's death till he
[1:39:06] come wherefore whosoever shall eat this
[1:39:09] bread and drink this cup of the Lord
[1:39:10] unworthily she'll be guilty of the body
[1:39:13] and blood of the Lord but let a man
[1:39:16] examine himself and so let him eat of
[1:39:18] that bread and drink of that Cup
[1:39:19] he that eateth and drinketh unworthily
[1:39:21] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[1:39:24] not discerning the Lord's body this
[1:39:27] caused me our weak and sickly among you
[1:39:29] and many sleep for we would judge
[1:39:32] ourselves we should not be judged I love
[1:39:35] this scripture but when we are judged
[1:39:38] guilty with repent or things done but
[1:39:43] when we are judged we are chastened
[1:39:47] rough-cut we're children of the Lord
[1:39:51] that we should not be condemned with the
[1:39:53] world or for my brethren when you come
[1:39:55] together to eat tarry one for another
[1:39:57] and if any man hungry let him eat at
[1:40:00] home that you come out together unto
[1:40:02] condemnation the rest I said in order
[1:40:05] when I could the Bible says if we tarry
[1:40:09] one for another let's just take a few
[1:40:10] moments of silent prayer praying one for
[1:40:13] the other for
[1:40:14] go into the communion
[1:40:31] whether we just thank you for an
[1:40:32] opportunity we've been able to set today
[1:40:34] and your testimony is told about you and
[1:40:38] hear your word ministered unto us that
[1:40:41] we could believe it and say thank you we
[1:40:45] love you and we thank you for everything
[1:40:47] you've done for us
[1:40:48] and just have your way with us most of
[1:40:51] all forgive our sins and make us worthy
[1:40:52] to take of this communion because we
[1:40:56] know where it's nothing none of us is
[1:40:57] worthy of any time yet you took my place
[1:41:02] and that would make me worthy we thank
[1:41:05] you Father have your way we committed
[1:41:07] all to you now in Jesus name Amen the
[1:41:14] Bible said he took the bread and blessed
[1:41:15] it well then we thank you for this bread
[1:41:17] is made for this purpose Lord we just
[1:41:21] follow the end the rules of what we
[1:41:23] believe and break it in this take the
[1:41:25] communion knowing the bread is not your
[1:41:29] body but it cymbals wine is not your
[1:41:32] blood but in simple yet we do these
[1:41:35] things until you come because you told
[1:41:38] us to we live in rethinking sanctify the
[1:41:40] bread and the protectors in Jesus name
[1:42:00] his body was broken for each one of us
[1:42:05] the bread he gave that night Natural
[1:42:08] Bridge but he told to tell you this is a
[1:42:14] New Testament in my blood we would
[1:42:17] literal it was spiritual what about a
[1:42:21] spiritual happening it has such a
[1:42:24] reality to it and built we're even still
[1:42:27] to this day enjoying the fact that we
[1:42:30] can take the communion and have a
[1:42:34] understanding of what it means what they
[1:42:37] pledged great opportunity to know the
[1:42:41] truth we know that it's not like we used
[1:42:46] to do use the father is used to keep it
[1:42:51] three months later we just take it out
[1:42:53] and throw it out using it in that wasn't
[1:42:59] scriptural think you don't do it that
[1:43:02] way it's got to be burned before the
[1:43:06] next day
[1:43:10] father we thank you for this line has
[1:43:13] gone through the process of aging and
[1:43:16] gets better each day it represents your
[1:43:18] blood that was shed for each one of us
[1:43:20] we love you as we thanking we ask you to
[1:43:23] sanctify the wine and therefore takers
[1:43:25] that we may all be together as one in
[1:43:27] you nor did we eat a little piece of
[1:43:30] bread and we drank a little supper wine
[1:43:32] tomorrow that will be blood cells in our
[1:43:35] body but we thank you for that we love
[1:43:37] you and we just committed to you energy
[1:43:40] system
[1:43:45] I know it was a blood I know it was a
[1:43:58] blur I know it was the blood for me one
[1:44:07] day when I was long we he died upon the
[1:44:11] cross and I know it was the blood it was
[1:44:20] Emmanuel flood but it was he Manuel's
[1:44:25] fly it was he Manuel's blood for me one
[1:44:33] day when I was lost he died upon the
[1:44:38] cross and I know it was a blood for me I
[1:44:46] know it was blood
[1:44:49] I know it was the blood I know it was
[1:44:55] sublime
[1:44:56] for me one day when I was lost he died
[1:45:04] upon the cross and I know it was supply
[1:45:09] for me who paid the price
[1:45:13] it was Emanuel's blood it was the manual
[1:45:19] blood it was he manual stuff for me one
[1:45:27] day when I was lost he died upon the
[1:45:32] ground and I know it was a blood
[1:45:37] or me what about an opportunity to be
[1:45:43] able to believe God's Word to walk in it
[1:45:46] as he gave it into us the great time and
[1:45:50] great opportunity to be able to believe
[1:45:52] it and to thank God for it
[1:45:55] to accept him for whatever we have need
[1:46:00] of we believe it don't cut is all taking
[1:46:05] place in him for about a day in a time
[1:46:07] that we would know the truth did you
[1:46:10] ever think that back when we're in the
[1:46:12] ideas of mankind that we'd ever be able
[1:46:15] to know the real truth we wondered about
[1:46:19] it and thought about it was seeing that
[1:46:22] we can believe it it finishes up with
[1:46:26] the truth you know why because it
[1:46:28] started with the truth
[1:47:28] the solver tape again
[1:47:40] you can be seated for a second we get
[1:47:44] everything ready to go
[1:47:47] he's like turning your scripture turn
[1:47:49] into John 13 google reader scripture
[1:47:57] because we believe in fulfilling the
[1:48:00] word and following it you see a lot of
[1:48:04] people would take the communion part but
[1:48:06] it wouldn't take the foot washing well
[1:48:10] now they even had people to say well you
[1:48:13] know if you need your feet water I'll
[1:48:14] wash them but I just don't think it's
[1:48:17] necessary
[1:48:18] I said well you just ain't honorable I
[1:48:20] see any dead yet he was dead you would
[1:48:23] not worry about washing somebody's feet
[1:48:25] it would be finished did everybody get
[1:48:31] okay so he like turning these scriptures
[1:48:35] we get to John 13 and supper being ended
[1:48:40] the devil having now put into the heart
[1:48:42] of Judas Iscariot Simon's son to betray
[1:48:44] him Jesus knowing that the father had
[1:48:47] given all things into his hands and that
[1:48:49] he was come from God and went to God he
[1:48:52] rises from suffering laid aside his
[1:48:53] garments and took a towel and girded
[1:48:55] himself after that he poured water into
[1:48:58] a basin and began to wash the disciples
[1:48:59] feet and to wipe them with the towel
[1:49:02] wherewith he was girded in company to
[1:49:04] silent Peter and Peter said unto him see
[1:49:06] look up here gets to his own point is on
[1:49:09] Sam

[1:49:13] and said unto him what I dude I know
[1:49:15] it's not now but I shall know Hereafter
[1:49:18] Peter's happened to him thou shalt never
[1:49:20] wash my feet jesus answered him if I
[1:49:24] wash thee not die it's no part with me
[1:49:26] Simon Peter said unto Him Lord not my
[1:49:29] feet only also my hands in the head
[1:49:32] jesus said unto Him he that is worse
[1:49:36] neither us not saved to wash his feet
[1:49:38] but it's clean everywhere and you're
[1:49:40] clean but not all persecutors were still
[1:49:43] right there you know he knew it he knew
[1:49:46] who should betray him darfur said he
[1:49:48] you're an hour all clean so after he had
[1:49:51] washed her feet and then taken his
[1:49:53] garments from set
[1:49:54] again he said unto them no you what I've
[1:49:57] done to you you call me master and Lord
[1:49:59] you say well for Who I am if I then Lord
[1:50:02] if I then if I then your Lord and Master

[1:50:09] wash one another's feet for I've given
[1:50:12] you an example that you should do as I
[1:50:14] have done to you verily verily I say
