house of the Lord if you'd like to turn in your scriptures turn back to where we've been reading Revelations 1 one of these days we'll quote thisen by heart and then we will go to Luke 1 Revelations one and Luke 1 there were actually 11 people that viewed this morning service and not five hallelu they were 11 Revelations 1 and Luke 1 father we thank you for your love and your grace unto us we thank you for the day and the time that we have thank you for you Lord because without you there would be nothing here worth anything no matter if we owned the world whatever we had it wouldn't be worth anything whatsoever but yet Lord by you coming and being among us then we are the Bride of Jesus Christ and we thank you for giving us that opportunity because it is you that haveth made us and not we ourselves we we just commit everything now to you as we read your word you come and speak to our hearts that we may Lord be able to express what you've given unto us and that way then the people would have an opportunity to think on these things let your light shine Lord in each one because we believe truly that this is the hour to understand we love you and thank you in Jesus name amen amen Luke one the revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to show unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass and he sent and signified it by his Angel unto his servant John now remember what we've done all the time using this this is the key to understand the Bible cuz this is the way the Bible was written remember it had to be a revelation given to Moses to write the Book of Revelations I mean the Book of Genesis and see writing it he had to get that Revelation to write it so it had to come from an angel to Moses and then where' it come from the burning bush all right who bear record of the word of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ and of all things that he saw blessed is he that readeth and they that hear the words of this prophecy and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand now let's go over to Luke we're going to read about 11 verse 10 verses or something like that Luke 1 begin beginning with verse 26 and in the sixth month the angel G was sent from God unto a city of Galilee named Nazareth unto a virgin espoused to a man whose name was Joseph of the House of David and the virgin's name was Mary and the angel came in unto her and said Hil th thou thou that art highly favored the Lord is with thee blessed art thou among women and when when she saw him she was troubled at his saying and cast in her mind what manner of salutation this should be and the angel said unto her fear not Mary for thou has found favor with God and behold Thou shalt conceive in thy wound and bring forth a son and thou shalt call his name Jesus now if you'll notice that's the one time that if you got a Scofield bible you'll see it totally italicize which means large letters you know all right and see then when you come on down reading you'll find it'll drop back down because this is an announcement see and call his name Jesus he shall be great and shall be called a son of the highest and the Lord God shall give unto him the Throne of his father David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no end then said Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the high shall overshadow thee and th therefore also th that Holy thing which shall be born of thee shall be called The Son of God you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word now we've we've covered some things and we want to try to move on a little bit this afternoon and uh you know get on with the the thought we're trying to bring because this is not just to show you how smart and anyone is is to show you how wonderfully gracious God has been to you and I to reveal by way of a prophet Messenger to you and I the end time his word that he has sealed up from the foundation of the world right now we try not to back up very much but just a tad bit on to this morning we have been talking about that the angels of God are encamped about those who fear Him and that's more than one Angel we know that each Born Again believer has an angel and then uh you know the angels of God are encamped about us and they're there according to Hebrews 1 13 and 14 if they're they're to minister unto the IRS of Salvation so they have a job to do that's what I'm trying to get you to to realize and me to realize that uh not to just have to wait till we get up into heaven and be like the prophet said when we get there said angels will be uh real and we'll see them well why can't we see things here you know at least by the eye of faith and by understanding and and reading you know we can can read the word of God and then you'll read back there in the Old Testament and and it'll talk about the angel of God it'll talk about God or something who was it man and his wife was there at the place and and the angel came down and and talked with him and then he just went in Fire and and you know evidently done something going up and went right on out and they said uh you know we've been in the the presence of almighty god well see that was an angel that was sent unto them but they would call it almighty god well what's a problem with talking about angels and God in the relationship of what we're talking about or the way we're talking because um you know if an angel comes that's God sending that angel now there are fallen angels that come we sure don't want to get tied up into that part you know but the real angels come in the way you know they are real angels is how what they do with the word if a preacher preaches a message to you watch what he does with the word you know the church age Messengers we know that he was right because what because the way he brought the word right all right so then we've got a way to check it we check it out with the word well brother Dale I just take what brother Brown said amen now that's fine that's all right but what are you going to do with a lot of times when he says something in one place and it's seemingly somewhere else he says something else see are we going to just you know take well I believed him before the seals broke and I believed him after when when he said the white horse rider was the Holy Ghost I believed him and now I believe when he says the white horse rider is the Antichrist and you know see there's somewhere there that we need to get a balanced uh diet in what we're doing to to be able to understand and watch it now this when we get into uh you know some of the message today watch that point of the brother randam could say one thing one place and another thing in another place and I believe they will be saying the same thing but it will say so contrary one to the other until the human mind see gets all confused and we try to figure it out and you'll never figure it out as I said there was Paul a trinitarian when he said the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ it looks like five that he had going on but was he a trinitarian no no he was talking about one person but that one person had many many manifestations of himself we believe in one true and living God but we believe that that God has many forms are the word in morphe you know to change in form see and and that way we we look at it so remember then the forms are dealing with what is necessary for the time that we're there that will be and determine how the form of God will be dealing with each one of us I've got a little talk that I want to get to uh eventually on something and uh so just you know bear with me in what I'm trying to bring cuz I'm trying to bring us up to realize reality right of life here amen that's right everybody wants to talk about life there I want to talk about life here somewhere about 30 years ago I told you or maybe it might have been more I told you that I stopped trying to get to heaven I was trying to believe that heaven's got to come here to take me there right so I'm not worried about going to heaven I'm concerned with getting Heaven Here If Heaven comes here I ain't got to worry about it I got a trip going right you know everything will be all right okay but now we covered now over a couple of two or three messages that I'm trying to describe them in things that the angels of God they have specific and special jobs to do and and they don't argue with each other over it and and you know they're all into uh Unison into the to the one that is in full command which would be almighty God himself they they would be underneath him even I believe even the Devil the angels that are you know his angels the Fallen ones uh I believe that they like I said this morning if he can't get you with drinking that angel will just step back and say okay smoking Angel go get him you say well you just made making it like it there's well what are you making it you know what are what are you making it to be well it's just the holy spirit it's just you know well all right that's all right that's you have your way and I'll just keep going my way right now but watch the point now that we're going to get on and I want to make this point right here the angel Gabriel that came to Mary the angel Gabriel that came to Elizabeth back up prior to this in the same chapter M he never planted the seed into Elizabeth he couldn't do it he could only announce right the angel Gabriel never placed a seed within Mary no amen he just announced it right had she not said be it unto me according according to Thy word it would have not have been planted in no form right he says but the Holy Ghost will overshadow thee and the most high now will come on thee and you'll conceive right all right but see but the angel can announce sure it's a choice of you and I to say the same thing that Mary said right be it unto me according to Thy word right amen now let me believe it right if she hadn't believed it it would have been no no child born from her right but now we know that it was all in God's predestinated plan that he didn't choose two or three different women to to do he knew exactly what she was going to say well now he knows exactly what you're going to say Amen right he knows before that I ever preach this message what some of you are going to say about it cuz he knows what all of us is going to say about it right all right so why can't we believe it that way it's all in him he knows all about it amen all right but we saw now talking this morning that each one as I said has a special job and they they stand by that job and like I said about wormwood just using me destroy destroyed the water or washed it over right but now all that water still here and all that stuff is doing you see ah brother Dale it's just a moon well who controls the moon who controls the stars who controls all things I thought it was God that the scripture said he ler the prophet out of his hand went forth this you know to Creation right all right but see Gabriel being the announcing angel of a special event like the children of Israel in the their you know time and all and he goes down and he appears to Daniel and he tells Daniel what's going to happen from there all the way to the consummation that's right so he announces that he had a message to bring that's right you know we we think about angels and wondering then you know don't worry about it if they come they' got a message to deliver right so what we want to do is get the message right you know we can spend a lot of inflence over on the angel and and and miss the message that's what I do and why I believe in the Book of Revelations that people believe you know that that brother Brandon was the one that come to John on patmas well that's all right if it did but I don't put that emphasis on that I put the emphasis on the fact of what did Brother brand say to you and I amen that's right what was said to him that's to him it's what said to me and you amen by way of the holy spirit cuz he cannot do nothing but SE a seed he can't make it come up in our in our being without us being willing okay but see a special event or the coming of a special person like John the Baptist coming all right so Gabriel comes and tells you know Zacharias that you'll have a son and look he says your'll name in John right and see that's a wonderful thing because we find in the very next event that happens he comes to Mary Y and he tells her what who this will be but not only that he tells her his name his name is Jesus I said you look at it and you read it it'll be great big capital letters in a few minutes you look on down and read somewh else pretty close and it'll it'll say Jesus it'll be in small letters that has a meaning that's not there just as a playy and it's not uh just that you got to emphasize the capitalization of a name why didn't they capitalize all the rest of them where it says Jesus like I said we look in the book of of Hebrews and Hebrews 1 it said God in Sun time big capital letters you see well I just started a sentence well why not where over it says in the scripture when it 5:24 John anyhow where he said God is a spirit that's the start of a sentence why didn't they capitalize at those things are there not that we're theologians but they're there because th those theologians those writers the translators knew that had a special meaning to it right right something real for you and I to think about right and to look at all right but now we were covering this morning too about Michael Gabriel being the announcing Angel all right but then Michael he would be the angel to come and fight he fights for the children of Israel and he takes care of that you know and do it but who is it then on the fourth seal that your Prophet talked about the battle of Armageddon and he talks about it going on now in you and I right all right but now we know the battle of Armageddon will be over in the tribulation period and we'll be gone right so what is the prophet doing there's a spiritual battle of Armageddon taking place in you and I right what about the Statue of a perfect man amen see who's helping to build all of that and getting it together what about the message the prophet preach the greatest battle ever fought that's in your human mind and he said God and the devil is right there battling that's right so who's that Michael right yeah cuz he's the battling Angel he goes over in Revelations 12 and all and he cast Satan out cuz he's already done it I ain't figured out yet why the devil can't this side and say hey look let me quit and join the other side but he's not going to do it cuz he's going to keep trying because he thinks the more forces he gets the greater power he can do and the greater ability to be able to one day whip my right well I wish he'd listen to me one time and just decided it ain't going to happen but ain't going to change you cuz it ain't going to change you what I say if God don't speak to you and tell you what I'm talking about today you'll have some concocted idea of what I'm talking about right and ain't nothing I can do about it I realized that a long time ago brother Reed said brother Dale remember there are people listening make it as simple as you can because there are people listening that hasn't heard what you've heard well I try to do that and then making it as simple as I can and drawing it out to explain it then I come to the place a lot of times I think well I'm just really goofing off cuz I want to preach way on down the road somewhere you know I want to get this underway and and other things but can't do it all right but now listen we found this morning that my is Christ now he's not Jesus you don't don't connect it together as Jesus being Michael that's right it's the Christ the logos the Son of God that went out the part of God that went out in the beginning the creation and you see it all the way down through the Old Testament as the Christ the angel of the Covenant to lead the children of Israel the one that spoke to Moses from the burning bush yes that is Christ that's Michael all right and Michael is here now in you and I in the form of the baptism of the Holy Ghost because I believe Michael to be God Amen right amen he was a Son of God and the Son of God is God made manifest in another form right when that Halo light went out in the beginning and went over started creating that wasn't another God that was another form for man's ideas or comprehension that we would be able to you know try to understand what's going on but now keep in mind what we're trying to get at when Gabriel came to deliver the message to Mary that was when he was it took some time right we just read it as he said this now the other but it took some time for that to transpire that's right you know it wasn't just a two-c conversation it it took time for that to transpire for Mary to say be it unto me according to Thy word all right then the Holy Spirit comes and plants the seed it wasn't the angel that planted the seed that's right and it wasn't Jesus that come on the scene right there right right right amen right amen it's dealing with getting the baby here and then you're going to name him Jesus now watch these quotes in just a minute that your Prophet said now we know the name Jesus wasn't used now let me quote two things all right brother Ram said the word the name Jesus was used many times before it was ever put Upon Jesus there was many jesuses right all right now but then he turned around and he said see that name was never pronounced and he said even though the angel pronounced it to Mary that angel told Mary that Elizabeth was pregnant right but he didn't bring life to John because the angel pronounced it right but when Mary went to Elizabeth and said Jesus CU it's got to be in the body of Christ you know the the the the Believers all right now but watch it now when that angel said Jesus brother around said those prophets had said Jesus before no no no no no well okay I'm glad to be able to read you know so let's start reading a little let's just see what your Prophet had to say yeah paragraph 44 number 1 a of your notes when you start God's chosen place of worship 6502 220 now we find out that Jesus said also I came in my father's name and you receive me not then the name of the father must be Jesus that's right the name of the father is Jesus because Jesus said to them I carry my father's name and somebody on tap for somebody here that they may like no you miss no that's what brother R said he said I carry my father's name I come in my father's name and you receive me not then his name was Jesus and Gabriel called him Jesus the prophets called him Jesus Now where's there any Prophet Old Testament that ever use the word Jesus so now don't lock your horns oh up the prophets called him Jesus and he was absolutely Jesus before his birth even the holy prophet called his name Emmanuel which is God With Us Now what is that that's Jesus because the word Jesus comes from the word Joshua Jehovah Savior and coming down but they never they couldn't pronounce the name because it was jvh and brother random at times we reuse JV hu but it's basically jvh V which is no vowel so they couldn't pronounce it so it added vows and they made it Jehovah but there's a scripture there in the Old Testament said by my name Jehovah was I never known because he couldn't pronounce it what was his name name Jesus boy you got a ninth grade education and you know more than the scholars well amen right don't you right we just read his name is Jesus by a prophet right yep see they didn't pronounce it Jesus they pronounced it Emmanuel they pronounced it Jehovah they would pronounce it maybe Yahweh or or Elohim or God or whatever but his name was Jes Jesus it didn't change the only name God ever had is Jesus all right so now you reading you read with your prophet and get what he said those prophets called him Jesus why because in that name Jesus is everything that we have need of right and surely he is Emmanuel look what he goes on down the second paragraph of the same message we find out then he comes the place of God's worship where that he becomes the place of God's worship where you worship him ever before he was even born his name was called Jesus it was so important it was given to his mother by the angel Gabriel that his name would be called Jesus Son of God what he was tell what I'm I'm so glad to have a prophet that I can go back amen right you know and then depend upon what he's saying but pray for Revelation well brother I don't understand how well you're going to argue with brother brandham then you're not arguing with me I'm just reading a quote read it for yourself but pray for a revelation pray that God will open our understanding okay so then what is it now not it just announcing the coming of a child but announcing that very Eternal Elohim self-existing almighty God Emmanuel is going to be born the angel Gabriel was chosen for that purpose to announce that unto Mary and he says you'll call his name Jesus right and like I said his name's been they've been spoken many times before Yus or jzo whever how you say it in Spanish and and all the others you know there was many jesuses in the days of Jesus probably a lot of people running around that their name was literally Jesus but there's never been but one God and brother R said like this he said there never been but one Lord Jesus Christ that's right now who was Gabriel telling Mary she was going to give birth to to the Lord Jesus Christ almighty God Emmanuel we can stay there for a week could we am well let's go on so Gabriel is to announce but now let me read what I got here if Michael don't come to back up up what Gabriel says then we would question Gabriel right so it's always the key to the whole Bible that God will come and back up his word right no matter where it's delivered by an Angel or what whoever or a mother to her children and and and uh I'm thinking of Moses sitting there and brother around said sitting on his mother's knee and she was telling him said you're not the son of Pharaoh's daughter right you he said well I got another quote Yeah there's another quote where he says about 16 years old before he found it out well how long did she stay there with him as a baby she might have stayed there till he was a couple of years old but after he got through nursing she was probably dismissed from the job I was 4 years old my father passed away and I cannot remember one thing about him a lot of people say I can remember this I can remember that brother brandham was something great when he said 18 years old I can remember the first thing was a vision crawling in eating I can't remember that way 18 months old okay all y'all put the dates to it I just trying to preach but listen his name was Jesus and that was what was delivered but get to Point even though Mary knew the name and knew what she was conceiving it took Christ to come on the scene speaking through her that she could go to Elizabeth and say his name is Jesus and a baby would come forth with life you might ought to write that down and think on it it's not just play and play pretty games we're here for a purpose his name is Jesus all right but now watch so let's get down to this Gabriel but let's make sure that we we uh deal it in a way that Christ will come on the scene because if he doesn't come on the scene to you know Michael Christ to vindicate what we're talking about then we've we just we're just talking that's right that's what a lot of people thinks it is they think going to church is just Ah that's your idea that's your opinion well we get there one you day you find it out you'll find out whether it was or not so I a worried about it you what is my concern you say well you know we don't know cuz brother random is not here to tell us oh my here he is right I just read you that he said his name is Jesus right what would he stand here and tell his name is Jesus all right but's see get on with it now but let's let's just go down to here on some things now and just listen to what was said brother r on the message of the Resurrection 53205 he said God always sends minor Angel well let's read the whole thing this priest standed there making his sacrifice which is was sacrifice on his right side appeared this great Angel the archangel always sends minor Angels but Gabriel announced the first coming of Christ and Gabriel will announce the second coming of Christ see the Archangel of God will announce the second coming of Christ now as I told you I know I know I got the quote so don't worry about it and get all excited Gabriel is to the Jews Messenger to the Jews that's all right cuz he does announce the first coming of Christ and he announces the second coming of Christ through through the two witnesses over there but let me ask you a simple couple of questions U the prophet would say one time he says those children of Israel will only believe their prophets you remember that well what about Elijah he was not a Jew they have no record they don't know where he come from I'm quoting brother Brandon all right he was a gentile right but Ed Israel still believed it just making a point all right now but when you come up now I wouldn't know about Elisha I would be 99% sure Elisha would be a Jew you know well we know for sure that John the Baptist was but yet he had the spirit of Elijah just making a point see we look at it and we think we got it all figured out because a lot uh the uh you know Gabriel is only to the Jews well I think the whole Bible is to the Gentile bright and for us to understand but just so you get that in your mind and you think on it you know you all right brother Brandon will call that angel that comes to him and I got him laid in my office if you want them I've given them to you he calls him a minor Angel the one that come to him but he calls him the healing Angel he calls him the angel of healing yep he didn't have no problem with making them statements ah he just done that brother Dale to confuse you well I'm just quoting him but listen Gabriel announced the first coming which was to Zacharias and then to elizabth right right but you better hold on a minute but because who then introduced Jesus B order to consider then and listen for a while all right I am the resurrection matter of fact brother Bram says this direct quote of the one who announced the first coming will announce the second second com and he used it 11 times and you'll find about 20 something times or more than that if you'll just run in Gabriel and run in announcing or announcing Angel you'll find a whole lot of quotes I'll just give you a few just or that you can read it I am the resurrection 19528 a and notice this that this Angel was Gabriel now these minor Angels come and when you see or hear of Gabriel coming you get ready for something major fixing to happen Gabriel was the one who announced the first coming of Jesus Christ is that right and we're taught in the Bible that Gabriel will announce the second announce the second coming now listen to what this is he will sound The Trumpet Of God that is right the coming of the Lord the angel of God Gabriel who stands at God's right hand yeah my don't listen Ministry of Christ 53 607 he sends many angels but when you hear of Gabriel coming down from glory is not just a minor thing something major is fixing to take place Gabriel here it is now Gabriel announced the first coming of Christ and Gabriel will announce the second coming of Christ amen he's the Archangel standing at the right hand of his majesty and Glory believest thou this preached in 1953 906 6A now there's there's Angels comes perhaps the angel visits me and to visit you and so forth there might be minor Angels but when you hear this Angel Gabriel coming you take heed something's taking place Gabriel announced the first coming of Jesus Christ and Gabriel will announce the second coming of Jesus Christ he said boy I feel religious about Jesus watch this one 1955 612 and look look the whole book of Revelation was wrote sent a message by an Angel I jesus sent have sent my angel to signify these things which must shortly come to pass and now true angel you're going to throw down throw back Joseph Smith and so forth to me but watch it don't work with the scripture a real true angel will come and vindicate this scripture to the dot yes sir notice that John fell down and want to worship that angel and he said see that thou do it not for I am thy fellow I am thy fellow thy fellow servants and of the prophets worship God a true Angel won't be worshiped it's not worship of angels it's a Ministry of angels that comes from God and these minor Angels comes perhaps it's angels with our are comes to your your humble servant and that's probably a minor Angel but when Gabriel comes brother there's something really on the road something go major going to happen Gabriel announced the first coming of the Lord Jesus and G Gabriel will announce the second coming of the Lord Jesus Jehovah of Miracles 1959 1126 and she looked at this great Angel and his name is Gabriel now there is angels of the Lord many of them and they come to the Earth and bring messages but Gabriel when he comes there's something major going to happen he was the one who announced the first coming of Christ he'll be the one that'll announce the second coming of Christ just reading a few where that you'll get the point Mary's belief 6121 we're looking for he a Heavenly visitor in this day it's a promise of God put on your deep spiritual thinking quick church and remember we are now looking for a visitor and there's many claiming it the only way that we'll know this heavenly visitors because heal by a record of the word she knew that that was the angel from God when she seen his action looked at him it must be an angel he said I'm Gabriel standing at the right hand of God now when God gets ready to do something he sends a messenger always always has he always will Gabriel announce the first coming of Christ Gabriel will announce the second coming of Christ that's right something major is fixing to happen right one more and then we'll stop talk in seven Church ages preached 54512 he's reading the scripture about how that he was in the spirit on the Lord's day and he heard a great trumpet behind him is a great voice of a trumpet trumpet trumpet it's an announcement right Gabriel at the coming of the Lord shall sound the Trump of God this was God's trumpet blowing in other words he's fixing to announce the Eternal destination of of the world Listen a trumpet what is it get ready I'm going to give you now what is the Eternal destination of the world you said well I said destruction that's it see that's what you look at don't don't don't read it like that read it with plain sense he's fing to announce the Eternal destination of the world what's the destination of this world if they reject Jesus Christ what's their hes y right all right so what's he saying a trumpet what is it get ready I'm going to give you the revelation of Jesus Christ to give to the church I'll speak to you what will be the destination of the world for those who receive and those who reject right all right so you can tie together with the trumpets announcing Angel Gabriel's got a job to do announce the coming of a special event something that's to take place something that's to happen and he announced the first coming by coming to Mary now listen he didn't announce the first coming coming to Zacharias he announced the coming of John the Baptist to Zacharias are you with me amen he announces the second coming of Jesus Christ to Mary I mean excuse me the first coming to Mary he didn't announce it to he wasn't talking about coming who was the most important was it the coming of John the Baptist or was it the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ right he announced both of them but which is the important okay now let's read some things that this might sound to be interesting all right and see if we can take these two things and let them come together that's it to us all right so now we've read these quotes and like I said there's plenty of them I got had a stack I told them away this yesterday CU I run them off and I read them about announcing the second coming now let's read a few things brother bradam said look at number nine on your notes okay are you with me yes Church choos and law for Grace 61316 now he comes down talking about how that he was doing a baptismal service on the Ohio River all right and he says D pretty close to the Middle where I got it underline says the 17th person I baptized all at once I heard something say look up now I'm going to say this before we do and that's that's all right of what you believe about it but I heard a man explaining one time that uh mey heard this of look up and heard your message for run the second coming but now I'm just I don't mind tell everything so if it gets confusing to you it won't confuse you right but said that that it was brother brandom's voice you heard that one that it was brother Brandon's voice that said as John the Baptist for run the second coming your message well now I'm not going to argue with you I'm just going to read what he says took place all right right the 17th person I baptized all at once I heard something say look up and I looked and here come that Pillar of Fire circling down out of Heaven stood right over where I was at and said it as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming of Christ amen now he calls it there the pillar of Fire next one number 10 questions and answers uh question and answers God being misunderstood 61723 and I love him let's sing that good old Baptist him baptismal baptismal song me the one we were seeing the first time that the angel of the Lord so I want you to understand that and listen he'll say the pillar of fire right you'll say the angel of the Lord he say the pillar of fire come in the cabinet cabin where he was born right and he'll say the angel of the Lord see now had I made that statement of month or two ago your mind would be juggling backwards and forth but I'm hoping by now that your mind is settled in just as if it was brother brandom's human voice right they still got to be an intelligence to make that Voice work it was not his intelligence and whether it would be called a pillar of fire or whether it would be called the angel of the Lord just remember what I've been teaching all the angels are underneath right the leadership and the direct leadership of the Holy Spirit right so if the prophet says the angel of God was there or if he says the pillar of fire was there he'll say he met him in that cave right or the place and sometimes speaking like a home or whatever and looks like one time it's in a home looks like another one but he'll he'll talk about the angel of the Lord that's been with him all his life then he'll talk about the pillar of Fire did we get into that get all confused why why you go sometimes and you find it me and my wife was listening the other day to a message you know after you get older you just got a lot of sitting around time so we just put on tapes and sometimes we'll listen to two and three tapes you know before we quit and we listen to other day we brother around talking about where he got saved have you ever heard him talk about where he got saved you'll talk about in the building the Woodshed you'll talk about running down the railroad track you'll talk about being there maybe in a another place you'll name two or three different places well I said well you know that's kind of odd because we were talking about the the many times that he said but I told her I said what's the problem you know you know brother randoms salvation his new birth could have come to him like mine did over a period of time right I got saved in the Baptist I got born again in 60 in 69 that are coming in this message is anything wrong with that brother Brown explaining one time that he saved in Wood next time he's talking about could it be that he's explaining the the development of his growth in his new birth see then it's not the prophet being confused it's you and me that's right amen we're the ones that are confused let just bring that out but here he'll talk about about the pillar of fire and then you talking about the angel of the Lord so on this one he says sing in that ear time first time and watch it old baptismal song the one we was singing questions and answers being misunderstood the first time that the angel of the Lord there ever appeared before men in his presence look at it I've seen it before myself the first time he ever come down and when he come down he said as John was sent to forerun the first coming of Christ your message will forerun the second coming of Christ you talking about hundreds and hundreds of people being there just listen to these things he says and then we'll back up and talk a minute number 11 on your notes is this the sign of the end sir preach in 1962 12:30 the evening service those Stars falling into their constellation back Yonder that angel come and said as John was sent to wind up the Old Testament and to bring forth the introduction of Christ watch you your message will wind up the Loose Ends and will introduce the Messiah just before his coming right right now brother Rand was the coming of the Lord right he only introduces look back up in a minute I get to reading either way token message preached 1963 9901 if I ain't telling you the truth they'd never speak back God will never speak to a lie God speaks the truth and these words are testifying that I'm telling you the truth they are the one that testify of the message that I'm preaching not only the angel down there on the river that day that said your message will forerun the second coming of Christ The Works itself if you can't believe that angel told the truth believe the works right souls in prison 63 11:10 the morning service as John was sent to to announce the first coming of Christ your message will announce the second coming right now he's using the word announce he doesn't have problems with using that instead of the word message he used it as an announce and said it's been around the world court trial 64412 he said I looked and here come talking about the River Jordan and I heard say heard it say again look up and when I looked here come that same Pillar of Fire that led Israel through the Wilderness thousands of eyes looking at it come right down to over where I was standing and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun the second the first coming of Christ your message will shall cover the earth and forun the second coming of Christ future home 64 802 500 walking into the river y the first day of the Angel of the Lord appeared visible to vindicate like he did on Mount Shi that I'd met him okay I walked into the River and hundreds singing that same song for the baptism here he comes descending that same Pillar of Fire that you see the picture there descending down right here at the river and said as John the Baptist was sent to forerun his first coming message as the as John the Baptist was sent to forun his first coming message will forun the second coming couple more then we'll go back to preaching a little questions and answers on the image of the Beast 54 515 he's talking about the same situation taking place on the Ohio River says as John the Baptist was sent for a for for a forerunner of the first coming of Jesus Christ your message will bring the second coming of Jesus Christ notice it said your message will bring and it's done it it's he hasn't come yet listen but look what it's done it swept the world around see and today now just thinking the efforts that's went forward there's been literally millions you know what he's talking about salvation and things last one spoken words original SE 1963 318 my message that I believe that God has called me far I have to say some personal things today because that's what I told you I do see and tell the world my mission I believe to the Earth is what is to forun the coming word the coming word which is Christ and Christ in him has the Millennium and everything else right there because he's the word all right so now we read quotes that Gabriel will announce the second coming CU he announced the first coming we read quotes where brother R message will forun the second coming or announce the second coming what do you think he said well I just can't get that quite together all right let's get the background story that we had this morning Gabriel came to Mary to announce the second coming right all right but who introduced Jesus Christ to the world the message was not made there right John the Baptist right came on the River Jordan and John the Baptist message introduced Jesus Christ amen now John the Baptist message couldn't be any different than what the angel delivered to Mary cuz remember John was chosen and given the name John and given a Ministry that would be the fulfilling of Isaiah 40 is that right and 40 41 what it is there words you know you're all right so now it's a very odd incident isn't it that the prophet would speak of the one Gabriel to announce that coming and then speak of an Angel being down here to announce the second coming and it's odd how that it so perfectly matches that Mary would be the one that would receive the message first and then John would come on the scene and remember the number three statement has got to be made had Jesus not come on the scene to John what good of John's message what good would have John's message been right the message true because that's what John come to Proclaim and John was in the spirit in the power of Elias right or Elijah all right so Gabriel made those announcements what if it's true that Gabriel then on the Ohio River because now listen I wrote this down word that I wouldn't forget it the first coming of Jesus Christ is a baby right now brother Rand was not coming to give birth to a baby that's right the second coming don't deal with a baby right that's right the first coming was dealing with a baby that's right but when that baby growed up to about 30 years of age 29 and a half to be exact right then John the Baptist introduced him to the world right amen would it be a coincidence then that the second coming of Christ that on the Ohio River when a man was standing there baptizing that an angel from heaven would come down and say your message will forerun the second coming your message will announce the second coming all right is it coincidental that at that time would have been 1933 and that 30 years from that day almost 29 and a half to be exact probably brother random would go to Tucson Arizona now when people are talking about and preaching types and shadows a lot of you are shouting like everything cuz you think that makes you understand it well I'm trying to typ some Shadows right help you understand don't run you know just listen then shout I'm not throwing off on you I'm just telling it like it is right but see wouldn't it be odd then that an angel would come to brother Brandon was that angel his Angel was it the Holy Spirit he had the Holy Spirit exited you I'm not saying the angel that come to brother brandom as Gabriel don't you get me tied up in the wrong place I'm talking about the one that come to him at his birth cuz he calls the one that come to him at his birth he did I didn't he call it a minor Angel right but he said when a major Angel comes which is Gabriel so it wasn't a minor a major angel coming to brother Brandon when he was born no but when he come to the Ohio River out of the Skies came a pillar of fire an angel of the Lord to announce the second coming 1933 33 years 30 years later he's preaching the seals that's right amen true 30 years from the time that he starts now you know yourself that brother Brown's message he said it I didn't Rapture message one for sure he said not in the years of preparation right but said when he begins to sound his message right from 33 to 63 brother Brandon was restoring back the original faith of the Bible right but in the Bible they never had the message of the seal they was spoke of in Revelation don't misunderstand me but nobody know what they were that's right now that's what your Prophet said so you go do what you ought to nobody didn't know what those seals were I've heard Baptist preachers preach the six seal is the Tribulation but that didn't mean we know it right Clarence Lin probably 100 years before brother random preached that the white horse rider was the Antichrist sister ceter was talking about it a a book that she has or had read out of it about people talking about Michael and things but how did commer Lin know it when he was sitting in the Antichrist system right I'm just trying to get you to think that's my job sister Gale to get you to think right make it go home and give you something to think about in those things odd your message will announce the second coming amen what is your purpose brother Brandon we read the last one there to forun yep the coming of the word which is Christ in other words to bring the message so in 63 brother Brandon Begin his message amen that's right the seals broke it brought his message into bed amen before then he was talking about what Paul and Peter and them was bringing right then he started his message right and for three and A2 years he preached the most wonderful thing just read the title sometime if you can't get what brother R said he said when those seals broke and I've seen people come in this message read two books and say boy when them seals broke to me come a brand new book I thought my Lord he said when the seals broke the Bible became a brand new book to him he read the titles after the seals right 98% of them will deal with eternal life Christ the Myst of God reveal future home who is this mesic just read the titles of the messages right and you'll see that he did have a message amen he always preached that MCH go back to 57 in the Hebrew series he preached Mel jezdic and who he was but when he come over there after the seals broke he didn't preach who MDC was that's not the title he said who is this MDC he'd always preached one true and living God why did he preach Christ's mystery that's right because it unfolded into a deeper deeper meaning unto him amen it brought Christ on the scene amen just like it wasn't his birth that brought it the angel could appear there cuz it wasn't the birth of of John the Baptist the angel could appear and give the name and everything right and of course some of you probably don't know the whole story but brother bram's name was not brandham it was Braham his father changed the name and made it brandom it only had six letters in it his father changed it and made it brandom with the seven letters CU it had to match we already had a billy gra didn't need another one of them we needed one with seven letters William seven Mariam seven brandom seven we needed that and he's up there preaching to people and he said we' never had nothing like this and here's Billy Graham said he's only got six letters well somebody sort of been sitting there how do you spell that guy's name b r a n h he he must be talking about something by himself but instead of that and all then pray for God to send us a prophet what we need is a prophet he was right there but you understand as John the Baptist was sent to forun the first coming you had to walk out there and Proclaim what was John the Baptist message Behold the Lamb of God that's all he said he never preached months weeks years never done a sign not one miracle in the days of John the Baptist but Jesus said he never been greater or woman but he walked out there and he delivered his message Behold the Lamb of God yes in other words Behold the one that my mother told me about that it appeared to Mary she said be it unto me according to the word because Mary is the top of the Bride right so it's the time for the bride to take what the prophet has said yes that's right and bring forth amen not to give birth to a baby no sir this is to give birth to the full revealed word of God right amen so gel's delivered his message now the prophet said to forun this the coming word which is Christ so there's Michael so here's here now Michael Christ how more beautiful could we want it but you know like I said John the Baptist couldn't reveal nothing no that's right he can only announce brother randam couldn't reveal nothing to me and you you think he has no it takes a holy spirit to reveal that's our trouble we've read it we've got in our brain bra our Cranium cap our computers we've got the message but you know what we need is the Revelation right cuz that's what we live by that's what we're going to walk off this Earth then is a revelation amen amen so who is it this is Gabriel making way for Michael and all of it still doing their job and we hadn't done away with anybody cuz remember what we started out talking brother Brandon said it he said those angels are attributes of God right amen and God never gained an attribute by coming into the world he had them before he came and he's never lost one of them and don't do away with them right we get on that other side we can sit down and talk about what we seen here and what went on oh out here's that good old brain working we get over there former things are going to be passed away we won't remember nothing about being here well what did we come here for right now you Ain never heard people say that oh yeah former things are passed away you want Bible you women that have a baby according to the Bible amen he said there's joy now it's not Joy why it's having it right Joy is telling Danny get out of here not no right but said when a child is born joy that a child has com into the world makes it a little different don't it we can remember being here that's right know why is the purpose of coming here if we can't remember it that's right right we can have a good time down through eternity talking a couple of million years about one day that we had something went wrong you almost got killed he said well you sure are funny brother I agree with you and I love the Lord and I love his word you don't get nothing else I do that come on I love his word I love to see him and I want to see him one day amen old color brother said don't talk to me about rewards that's right said just let me stand and look at it for about a million years amen that's right it take a million years to even understand the first thing you'd be looking at that's right there been 2,000 years preaching about the name of Jesus still don't have it preached out do we that's right just now beginning to understand it right let's stand together one day we'll understand why a prophet would say Christ is the mystery of God revealed he said if you don't see Christ in never verse he didn't say if you don't see Jesus now he said if you don't see Christ in never verse go back and read it again he said because you miss something right well I read them so and so we got so and so and so and so and we got so and so the only reason I read a lot of them was I wanted to be able to say I read the Bible all the way through now why don't you be honest and say it like that I mean you enjoyed so and so we got so and so and so and so and got so and so and so and so got so and so and so and so so and so you didn't enjoy it you put up with it and read it where you can tell everybody you read the Bible but see all at once in a lot of that so and so we got so and so you'll find one little bitty sentence in there it'll be a wonderful thing so keep reading them it will appear and it is a lineage or a line down through there I'm so and so we got so and so what do we got amen 4:30 in 4:30 change this song A little bit when we get into shall follow me all the day all the day anybody have need I
