morning Lord God open your word to us Lord feel at Liberty to move Among Us Lord and Quicken your word and deliver it to our hearts Lord Jesus meet every need I pray in your name amen God bless you appreciate the anointing this morning it's it's good to have church in that's that's what a a Believer Longs for is to is is to be entertained by the word and that's uh there's a lot of things that entertain people today and you you know you can go to ball games and go to different things but uh there's just something about coming to church and getting in that atmosphere and getting in the presence am of God and I want to speak this morning from uh Matthew chapter 24 uh verses TW uh 15 to 28 and and just take a little topic that the elect will not be deceived and and and this you know I y'all know how I preach sometimes I I'll take a sermon that brother Ram preached and use that as the framework and I preached on this sermon a few times before but going to revisit it and and this is the sermon the anointed ones at the end time and brother Brandon would you if you're listen to this he he's actually uh he's really taking things from the seals especially the first seal and exposing it in this sermon and and that's why he'll say things like these things could never have been known until this day in the end time where we can where where our confusion is kind of eliminated where we can see things clearly and see it's it's not a finger point sermon it's a pointing at us to see to see if you're really genuine or not so as we meditate on these things let's go straight into the word in in uh Matthew 24:15 where he says when ye therefore shall see the abomination of desolation spoken of by Daniel the Prophet stand in the Holy Place whoo re let him understand then let him which be in Judea flee into the mountains let him which is on the housetop not come down to take anything out of his house neither let him which is in the field return back to take his clothes and woe unto them that are with child unto them that give suck in those days but pray ye that your flight be not in the winter neither on the Sabbath day for then shall be Great Tribulation such as was not since since the beginning of the world to this time no nor ever shall be and except those days should be shortened there no flesh be saved but for the elect's sake those days shall be shortened then if any man shall say unto you Lo here is Christ or there believe it not now here's The Clincher right here verse 24 for there shall arise false christs and false prophets and shall show great signs and wonders in so much that if it were possible they shall deceive the very elect now this is where I'm taking my notes from it it ain't possible and it's not possible to deceive the very late because in this day God has unloaded all of the word am so all of his Spirit can be unloaded on the bride and so that you're not going to be deceived because you are the word and you ain't going to be deceived how can you deceive the word if you become if you become the word as you hear the word so you're not going to be deceived because Christ has revealed in you behold I've told you before wherefore if they shall say unto you behold he is in the desert go not forth behold told he is in the secret Chambers believe it not now now there's a lot to unpack in that that's right amen when they tell you he's over in this city you got to go to this church or you got to go listen to this person come on now brother am right yeah you know where he is amen for as the lightning cometh out of the East and shineth even under the West so shall also the coming of the son of man be for where now here's the other clencher a vulture will hang on to uh dead meat from another day or from by on air but Eagle's got to have fresh meat so you can tell the difference because an eagle is going to have a it's going an eagle is going to believe a present tense word the revealed word for that day which will be manifested in the life of that believer that's why it says for wheresoever the carcass is there will the Eagles be gathered together you may be seated the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word you you know uh as I as I meditate on these sermons and things that really just I'm just really impressed upon that I I it makes me think how many people really recognize the the it's like it's like the treasure that we have in our hands The Treasure of this message I I was uh I've got this Bible study software on my computer and I I I I an ad on popped up on Facebook or something for it and that was a denominational Minister talking about I'm I I he's working for this software company that helps you study the Bible and he said I'm trying to help I want to help preachers have something to convey to their congregation and I got thinking about that you know there's a lot of denominational preachers that are kind of struggling with what what you know they're studying things out but they don't really you know they can preach you know the basics of you need Christ and things but but now you know as ministers because of this wealth that we've got we should never struggle for something to say that's right and you know you just take one of these one of these sermons and unpack it and it begins to it begins to give strength and Clarity in a in a confusing hour and and and the whole reason for this message one of the one of the great benefits is that it takes away the confusion where you can see things clearly where you can be able to now we've been kind of lately on discernment to be able to discern true and false and I believe in this hour we should be able to discern true and false because brother R would say he's he's trying to lay out this point that that in this hour it's going to be so close that it's going to be very hard to detect and and I I say these things cuz sometimes you get kind of worried about people's discernment cuz you know people will say like like we use an example of this this political race that just happened I heard somebody the other day they said I'm not getting in politics don't worry but somebody the other day said uh you know I I'm glad speaking of the political candidates I'm glad we have a moral candidate and I I I I got I just kind of it's timing for a little bit I I'm I'm thinking now now look we're in this hour it's going to be so close that even sitting in a message church or sitting right there in the religious Realms it'll be so close that you can't tell and yet we're used to used to 20 or 30 years ago we'd make fun of politics how politicians you can't trust them and you know they I I was reading some stats how when a politician gets in office they'll only meet they only uh fulfill maybe 20% on both sides of the aisle of the promises that they made because you just can't trust a politician so to look at a political race or something and say well that's an example of what I believe a real Christian should be or real real morality real a real example of everything that that I want to be identified with as a Christian well my friends I'm sorry but but come on now that we we got to have more discernment than that if we can't even discern that then how are we going to our own Christian Life how are we going to know whether we're real or whether we're false or or or or hey let's let's or whether our church is real or whether whether what what we're believing is real or false you see we you got to have discernment amen discernment is be just just be able to look at something and say well that that that don't look quite right that that you know a young and I use the example before you you need to have discernment when a when you as a young person you're talking to a boyfriend or a girlfriend and they start talking to you you need to be able to know if they're if if they're genuine or not or if they're just making up some some you know trying to act like they're real and genuine you need to have discernment when as a young person maybe you get a little bit older and you get married and you're trying to find which church to go to you need to have discernment and so the reason why brother random preached these things of the anointed ones at the end time is so that we could be able to tell what's genuine and what's false now now as an example you know you come to you go to a church service and we were in some recently where you know the spirit is moving and I I was talking to some brothers recently about the the the the bethl youth camp where uh they were talking about sitting up there playing their instruments as the spirit rolled through the congregation after the service and and you could actually see just like how brother random used to talk about in his meetings the Holy Spirit would move from this little group from to this little group and the anointing is present in the congregation but one thing you got to realize is the anointing is vindicating itself is proving that God is real and he's there in the church service he's there in the people or moving among the people but it doesn't necessarily vindicate the person you can have and and that's the whole point of this sermon really is that you can have a an anointed preacher an anointed Christian person sitting in the congregation that you can the spirit will be moving and people will be praising God and and and and maybe someone will even speak in tongues or interpret tongues as brother going to go on to explain that he was in that Pentecostal meeting and all of these things can happen but it doesn't necessarily vindicate the person you you got to have some you got to look at something else to vindicate the person God moving in the service and that's what oh that's wonderful when you feel the presence of God and he's moving in the service and maybe you'll even see something Supernatural and some somebody will like one of my family members recently in a in a service just spontaneously the anointing dropped and just shouted praised God and and something begins to move on the hearts and lives of the people in the in the service but it doesn't necessarily vindicate the person that's right now there's the thing amen I've even heard maybe some of you I'm I'mma poke at you a little bit y'all go to a Pentecostal meeting and say Well they're having a Revival over there yeah a a as though you going to say well we ain't having something over here they're having a Revival and you look and and you get all excited about a Pentecostal church service with anointing and my that look at what all going on over there and you fail to realize because you lack discernment you fail to realize the difference what just because God is moving in the service and moving and moving and and and people are are shouting and screaming does not vindicate what people are preaching about it does not vindicate their lives it does not vindicate the person it doesn't vindicate the person behind the pullit if somebody in the church begins to shout and praise God and run up and down the aisle but now the balance of it is is we want that I I want I want Liberty where God somebody feel if they want to run up and down the aisle they have Liberty to do that where where they can praise God and worship in whatever way they want but realizing that that does not vindicate that personall brother R will say I want you to notice here in Matthew 24 Jesus use the term Christ Christ means anointed not Christ but Christ plural not singular Christ therefore the word Christ means the anointed one and then if it's anointed there will not only one but many anointed the anointed ones the anointing the anointing can fall in move in your spirit realm and move and and affect your flesh and move and yet there's something missing on down on the inside something will be different amen now maybe as I'm preaching let's just just ask your question you to keep you from maybe getting bored forward and drawing back do you know the difference right do do you know how to tell the difference do you if cuz if you don't know then listen real good do you know how to tell well you see maybe you see your children go to youth camp or something and they praise God and they would run up and down the aisle I remember my kids praise God when they were uh they they went to Youth Camp and they were talking about how they praise God and they would run up and down the aisle and I remember thinking yeah but there's more that's good that's great that's good so can you can you tell cuz if you can't tell and here's the other thing if you can't tell besides just listening to me now this this should really Inspire us to get to get into the message and go searching through it and read things and and labor through it and I want to put balance to it nobody's going to be able to study like a minister a Minister's got a special gift to get into the word for hours and hours and pray and set their side their life apart but you've got to you've got to have a desire to maybe just listening to it in the background during the day something and and something is going to draw you if there's really something working in your life you're going to be drawn to the word and you're not just going to sit it over to the side while you watch this soap operas or what other the things of this world but there's going to be something in your life that will draw you to the word and that's what I'm trying to promote now here's the thing about a false anointed one there's true anointed ones and there's false anointed ones so we're not trying to get away from the anointing right but we're trying to be genuine amen yes sir I was talking to somebody recently you know we we get so enthused we want to we want to do things and do things for God and and be seen and whatnot but you know the main thing is to be genuine I'd rather be genuine and nobody know me I'd rather be genuine and have like one click on my sermon I'd rather have genuine I you know that that trumps really everything else I'd rather be genuine and real than be an anointed and and be fake on the inside be be a hypocrite fooling everybody I'd rather be genuine than than anything else I'd rather be genuine than be a hypocrite even brother BR said I I'd rather well I I would never want to be a hypocrite and stand before God on that day as a hypocrite I I want to be a real genuine in other words down in my soul be right a false and owned one though they're they're not like you'd say an unbeliever a false and owned one sitting in church going to church celebrating worshiping amen they're they're as far as you look at them on the outside they're a Christian what what does the anointing do it makes you have a desire for lost souls it it will uh you know brother I'm they'd like to worship they like to go to church they like to sing songs they like a good oldfashioned camp meeting but all the time they're they're motivated by Devils now let's take a step back here for a second when you get to preaching like this I know it makes everybody draw up and things because you think the preacher's pointing at you but I'm not talking this morning about the measuring stick of a man sometimes we start looking and we'll think well the the man is going to measure me and out in the parking lot he's going to be pointing his finger at me and saying and you know what happens when you start letting the man measure you what if what if I have a bad day or brother Wade has a bad day at church and and and you go home and you think well brother D brother Wade or brother Bob or who brother Aaron said something to me and you go home and thinking I'm not doing too great as a Christian today because you didn't measure up to what your what that man told you or maybe the man has a good day and and you're thinking wow I'm a really good Christian because that man likes me and that's how we approach Christianity a lot of times we're trying to satisfy The Man Behind the pulpit or we're trying to we're trying to get in good graces with the man but we're not trying to measure up by God's standard we're not following a man we're following Christ so as long as you meet the standard that said in the word that will give you confidence that you're walking and you're doing and you're and you're and you're measuring up right you know like in Zechariah where zerubba will begin to build the temple and and the Bible says he had a plum line Plum line that he's holding up to make sure he's building everything correct that everything's everything's being constructed correctly right and now that's the plum the plum line of God's word is what we got to measure up against not not whether Bob brother Bob or brother Wade or brother Aaron or brother Louis is happy or any of the deacons and nobody's fussing at you it's not a man that's that's trying to guide your life but it's the Holy Ghost and the word is trying to trying to keep us walk in the straight and eror and you know it's so easy it's so you think well aren't we walking the straight in there aren't we staying right with the word I think you know when Paul got to the Ephesians church he asked them this question have you received the Holy Ghost since you believed and they said unto him we don't we we had heard anything about there being in the Holy Ghost and you know you say well that that was the Ephesian church but you know you really got to be careful that that thought will actually creep into the message I think it has creeped into the message that denominational idea that Baptist idea that well as long as I'm a message believer I've already got the I'm already born again as long as I'm sitting in church I'm already born again you you know that's really the minister struggle to preach it to convict somebody so that the veil comes off their eyes and they realize that they ain't where they're supposed to be if we can get away from that denomina denominational idea that if you sit in a message Church you're born again just because you're sitting in a message church does not mean you're born again just because you're sitting in the church and you're nodding your head does not mean you're born again you're born again when your life matches up with the the word says it should be you're born again when you're you're actually a living expression of what the word for your day says you should be now what is the anointing it's a Divine empowerment by the Holy Spirit to fulfill God's will so it might be a Divine empowerment for preaching I went through all these quotes where where brother R was talking about anointing and he said there's some anointings that will that will move upon me to give and to take so there'll be an anointing that will drain the energy from him and other anointings that will just give all the strength to him there'll be an anointing for a healing service an anointing for preaching and different anointings for different situations and it's an anointing just like the anointing that came on Jesus at the River Jordan an anointing he was the word born in that M manger is a word but the anointing came on him to move him right into service and go to preaching which is why because the anointing was on him he could stand there in the temple or stand there in the synagogue and reach for that Scroll of Isaiah and say the spirit of the Lord is upon me CU he was anointed to preach anointed to to to to preach a word that was set the captive free to to to to heal the brokenhearted to preach Deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind you talk about an anointing an anointing to set people free an anointing to loose loose Deliverance in people's lives well I wonder if that same kind of anointing could be in this day not not because we've got into a worked up into an emotion or sensation or something but but because we've heard the word and we've meditated on it and received it amen he said the anointing of the Holy Ghost that has nothing to do with the soul inside you you can speak in tongues and deny the word you got to line up with the truth of the word right so what is Anointed anointed one is one with a message yep and he would even say the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed in other words human effort Al isn't sufficient you you know you turn on the uh if turn on the YouTube or whatever and watch some of these preachers out in the denominational world and you better believe they're anointed they're they're anointed and they're preaching the gospel and and some of them have some pretty good sermons and they'll they'll bring they'll break out some things about family life and live it and how to find a good spouse and and make everybody laugh and and everybody be sharing what they said on Facebook and all of those kind of things and they're anointed cuz the only way the message can be brought out is by one that's anointed but but what about what vindicates that person on the inside are they are they in the rhythm of the word for their day are they believing the message of this day are they are they are is their life lying up with the what with what the Bible says they should be living in this day amen it's the anointing that distinguishes between merely just speaking religious words and speaking with spiritual power that's why brother R said and what was the Holy Ghost given for he said the Holy Ghost is given to to to an unction to the preacher it will transform a service where it it's not just a man speaking up there but it's the Holy Ghost putting the words together but it might be the Holy Ghost putting some words together but that doesn't yet vindicate the person speaking cuz they could speak something in error now now there's where the confusion is that you could be speaking something in error and preaching something wrong and yet be genuinely anointed by the Holy Ghost you could be sitting in a a holy anointed Holy Ghost filled church service wow they're having a Revival and it' be wrong and it be wrong right brother without the anointing the message won't have its intended spiritual impact the anointing is what makes the message penetrate hearts and Minds I I've listened to anointed preachers before and I I thought wow they are they are a good speaker they can just roll them words words off their tongue and and and and and really an anointed speaker you you could you could could make somebody uh buy a car that's falling apart an anointed speaker could could pull somebody over to some idea that that often left field an anointed speaker could sway your heart and mind to to vote for the wrong thing at a political election or to do whatever an anointing speak why it's an anointing but it doesn't vindicate that person in other words the Holy Ghost can be present and moving and active and empowering but the person and their message be false yes sir now that's what brother that's what brother Paul that's what brother Paul was saying in 1 Corinthians 13 if you go back and read that maybe write that down to go back and and really digest later on cuz what what I'm kind of getting at is is you you will move on not by emotion and sensation by by by slow diligent meditation on God's word so you go and open up 1 Corinthians 13 and read through it slow what is this talking about what what what don't don't just leave it at church but at home maybe when you're drinking your coffee in the morning open up that scripture and think about it think about that scripture earlier I read Paul say and though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels and have not charity though I though I'm in a church service and I speak in tongues in other tongues and of I speak in the tongue of angels but I don't have charity but I don't have the real regenerated life I it's just like sounding brass or tinkling sbol go that stimle and Clank on it it it's just like noise just clanking and though I have the gift of Prophecy wow that's what everybody get wow he got a real he got a real gift but it doesn't vindicate the person person right and understand all Mysteries now that's a quote I'm going to take from Brother Dale brother Dale said that you could understand the symbolics of all the Seven Seals and still not see what the real mystery of the seven Thunders is because you understand it by an intellectual understanding and you repeat you can repeat like a parrot what somebody else said that's what brother brother Dale said when he was preaching the message on the seven Thunders that you can understand all the Mysteries but you're still not born again that's right you can have all knowledge you can lay it out and and have all the structure and all the framework and and still not be right on the inside and though I have all Faith so that I could remove mountains and have not charity I am nothing and though I bestow all my goods a lot of works that I could go into the soup kitchen and work I can do all these things to feed the poor and though I get my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing amen now look how Paul begins to identify the fruits of Charity charity suffers long and is kind kind I don't like kindness charity envieth not why CU it it's not looking at a man for validation it's not looking at as long as I go to certain church or I sit under a certain pull pit then I know I'm right no charity charity knows it's got an inward peace it knows where it stand it knows what it's standing for charity vaunteth not itself it doesn't matter whe charity doesn't matter whether it's in a Manger or on the on the backs side of a desert or wherever it's not puffed up it do does not behave itself unseemly it seeketh not her own it's not trying to put itself up or something it's not easily provoked it you know you you can poke at it so well I don't like your family I don't like the way you live I don't you you message you Pentecostal believer it well it's all right we just keep going on thinketh no evil rejoiceth not in iniquity but rejoiceth in the truth beareth all things believeth all things hopeth all things endureth all things now what brother Ram said about that scripture he said remember you can speak in genuine the Holy Ghost tongues and still not have the Holy Ghost right the Bible said so though I speak with tongue of men and angels and have not charity it prth it profit me nothing amen so what you can preach contrary to God's word and be anointed yep sure you can focus on signs and wonders because you're anointed and be wrong on the inside you can misinterpret present day truth and be wrong amen you can produce false fruits or preach a historical interpretation a false a false Believer cannot stay with the word because their word their life is not based on the word they're not looking at the word they're looking at it's something else or they'll manipulate scripture and boy that's a that's a big one to manipulate scripture to fit your own kns and your own goals just slide it around so that it means what you want it to mean that's right he said what were they Janice and jamb balum all them what were they Christ anointed Christ and false prophets anointed ones but Pro false prophets Jesus said that the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen you know one thing that I love he said what's the rain for the rain the rain will fall on the the false and the true it fall on the nettle and the wheat it'll fall on the on on the tears and everything but what the rain fent for is the wheat now what I can take away from that for this morning is God wants that rain to fall on you that's that rain is for you if you need a blessing a good oldfashioned Pentecostal blessing that'll make you run and Shout this morning then that rain is for you it's it's it's it's it's coming for you and that rain that rain will make both of them grow up to fulfill their potential something something that's false or grow up praising God and rejoicing in their Spirit now you know a lot a lot of way sometimes preachers will preach like we want to get rid of all the anointed ones and I ain't preaching like that this morning I I don't want the anointed ones to leave the building I don't want them to go down the street I want the anointed ones to sit around you might as well if this is the only blessing you're ever going to get you might as well get a good blessing and rejoice and be happy and sit around and stay while and maybe God something God will get a hold of you and begin to change change your nature from something that's fake to something that's genuine and you know how you want to be genuine this morning is is let the word grab a hold of your life and meditate upon the word day and night meditate on the word and think about God's promises to you oh I love a good emotion I love good shout and everything but just to get a real sober look at God's promises and begin to think about that and let it resonate in my heart and in my life and think think that these promises are for you think that this rain that God sent is for you think and then when you pray when you get on your knees you begin to think about these things and it'll affect your conversation with god it'll affect your your time with God it'll affect your relationships with your family it'll affect everything and that's why brother Ram said by their fruits ye shall know them because the word begins to change you it's the word I love a good emotionalism I love I listen I love going in we went to this uh youth youth camp uh many years ago and we we come out of that service and I that anointing was so strong I could not even get out of the car I remember Joe come out he was with us and he said he he said Monica where where's Bob at she's like he he's stuck in the car praising God and he come out there and sit with me for a while and listen I I love a good emotional time where you can just praise God and worship worship on the way to work but there's a difference when you get a hold of the word the word is what will anchor you the word is what will change you the word will make that emotionalism do something instead of producing something fake it'll be a real genuine anointed son and you know you there's got to be an anoint anointing in this day the bride is growing up to a super anointing a super anointing that will that will raise the Dead from the ground where that word that we have held for all these years is Anointed and put into an action into in a super way to bring a brother Ram called it a super Faith a super anointing there when he was talking to Hatty ride in that room he said a super anointing came in the room a super anointing will anoint the super word the perfect word that we've heard and put it into action by their fruit she shall know there there you are what what are your fruits the fruits are the observable deeds and character that manifest in a person's life as a result of what is within their heart right in essence their life will consistently produce behaviors and attitudes aligned with God's word amen and the Bible calls that good fruit yeah you're you're connected to the good tree the good Vine and that produces good fruit if someone is disconnected from God tied into that corrupt tree their life will bear negative traits or actions so you can see here that that I'm I'm really laying it down almost like a like using logic or something but there's two things that go into what the fruits really is it's the Doctrine and the correct characteristics the correct Doctrine and the revelation will produce a change in your life so you can look at somebody running and praising God maybe a young person at a camp meeting and then they go out and they go right back to the world looking at stuff on the internet they go right back they don't care they care more about Facebook and Tik Tok than the word give them time I'm not poking at you give them time let let but one day one day that word word will grab a hold of their heart and begin to draw them and despite the fact that they praised God years ago and nothing happened when that word begins to draw at their heart it begins to change them now there's the difference there's the difference the word the word is what change changes everything yeah so we could we could almost frame it we say it like this that you're positioned you're position you're never going to get Victory by praying and fasting right because your Victory and you're overcome coming and your placing comes by meditation on and consumption of the word of God right now there's been a lot of people Benny hen and different ones that will go and pray I I was listening to uh an example of a this brother that followed brother Brandon's Ministry but never quite believed it and I'm forgetting his name right now but he said I wanted a Healing Ministry like his there's a testimony that you can watch on Facebook and and he said I went and began to pray to God that he would give me a Healing Ministry like brother Brams and God did he would go and and have prayer lines and people would come through and be healed of everything and he was anointed God gave him an anointing to heal and and so that people's lives would be changed in that manner but yet he never came to the real knowledge of the truth now see you can pray and you can fast and those things let me put it like this if you want to go up it's the word if you want to go out it's prayer and fasting up you go up by meditation on the word and consumption of the word but if you want to put it in action that's when you pray so you can't we don't want to get away from praying and fasting you don't want to like somebody years ago told me you shouldn't even encourage people to pray because prayer never did nothing for me well listen it did something for my family when I see my children going out and doing stuff and I get so many times Miracles I can tell about where something would be happening and I'd get on my knees in prayer believing that God would come on the scene and he would move what was it it's putting into action what I believe but you'll never go up you'll never be placed by prayer and fasting it's the word of God but when you're placed and when you're put into action then you can put that to work by prayer and fasting what does fasting do is setting your life laying your your your own being aside so that you can be better align to believe God's word you like sometimes ministers will not not eat before they preach because they want to be able to think and allow God to use them more in that mode but you're never going to be born again and you're never going to be adopted because you get into an emotional state it's by the word of God you'll find out that that little little Mary that brother said that when when she met the Angel when she ran into the angel she was meditating on the scripture that a virgin shall conceive and you think about a little a little woman turning the corner thinking about God said that a woman a virgin shall conceive and she turned the corner meditating on that scripture and there was the angel waiting on her so if you want to meet an angel if you want to have God come himself and reveal something to you get to meditating on the word now there I I want to say that's what Lula's problem is is we're relying on The Man Behind the pulpit instead of having our own personal relationship with God we're relying on somebody else to do the heavy lifting for us where when something goes wrong with our family we want to have somebody to blame somebody to point our fingers at and say well like I've actually heard nobody was praying for my child will you get on your own knees and pray for your child yourself I did it from my you do it for yours you pray for your child if you've got a real token life a token Holy Ghost life hold that token over your family and see God go to work oh if the word changes your heart then you can put it into action by prayer amen but look look we don't want to do away with prayer we don't want to do away with fasting we don't want to do away with an anointing that's where it's been so hard over the years to keep a balance because you people begin to run and shout and praise God and and they start looking at that instead of the word but oh if we can express it right if we can speak it right it's the word that will bring you faith and put you into position but then you can put it into action with your life with your living and your prayer and your confession you the Bible says that we're saved by our confession and when you get on your knees and start confessing what God already said something that goes into action because you're not you're not praying like like a Buddhist or a Hindu that's just getting emotional we're going to pray three times a day and put our towel out and all those kind of things but you're praying based on your revelation of the word of God and the word of God is what will get things moving the anointing proves God's presence in activity but the fruit vindicates the person yes sir now that's why I I love a good old Pentecostal service where the anointing gets to moving and you can see that God is in action but the fruit vindicates the person I I was in a a a a a meeting a few years ago it was that camp meeting in and well I'm not going to say it cuz I'm I might get in trouble but I I was watching you know Zach had just had a real experience with God and he was running up and down the aisles he was praising God and I looked over on this other side and you could see people praising God that I'm sorry but I was just like I don't know if that's genuine and you know they're doing you know and I'm not trying to poke or nothing but listen you can tell just because someone is jumping and shouting does not mean that it's genuine you can get into an atmosphere like that and just get worked up or whatnot but it's the fruit the fruit that vindicates the person amen and brother R in that sermon now this is where this is where it helps to meditate meditate go through a sermon and think paragraph by paragraph get to one of these paragraphs and start thinking what is he trying to say and he said the spirit of God here's the fruits always is ready for correction right now you know now that don't it's your it's your characteristics have been changed that doesn't mean that when a preacher is preaching from behind the pull pit that you don't bow up that means in any situation somebody can Co up to you and say there here's the big one that we bow up at I think you're mean yeah what I I I don't like you talking to me like that the spirit of God always is ready for correction why can't we have normal discussions with one another where we can talk about things and talk things over the spirit of God always is ready for correction sweet and humble uhuh I don't like that that's good that's good we're getting somewhere if we if we Rec recognize there something lacking in our life then we'll start to get serious with God now remember what I was preaching on a while back it's when it's the life that attracts you to the gospel but the way you're going to get to the life is through the word because Jesus said my words are spirit and they are life so the life makes I I want to be sweet and humble I don't want to be orary and me mean and hateful I want my life and my characteristics to be changed cuz brother R brother Ram said how are you going to be a witness and a testimony if your fruit is all cankered up and you might have all the doctrine laid out nice and neat but your attitude and your characteristics are just so off-putting that nobody can stand to be around you now that's where this fruit is both the doctrine and the character it's the doctrine and the characteristics a sweet humble life ready for correction ready to ready to hear somebody out well I don't think they believe like I do but let me talk to them let me listen and brother R said willing willing willing to get at the table and talk talk it over he see he said if it's stands up and say I'll do it anyhow I I'm going to do it anyhow you lay that word out to them and and there just something in it something that's wrong inside oh I'm going to do it anyhow I don't care just remember he said arrogant spirit are not of God right I remember the Bible said he said he'd come in like just as Sly as he could be and deceive the very elected if possible why is it deceiving because an anointed preacher can preach and have an anointed prayer line at the end of the service and people will be running and shouting but be leading to the wrong thing so you got to listen what to the word that's being preached but I thank God for the rain amen there's that scripture in Hebrews chapter 6 it said the Earth which drinken in the rain that cometh of upon it and bringeth forth herbs meat for them by whom it is dressed receiveth blessing from God but that which beareth thorns and briers is rejected and is nigh and cursing whose end is to be burned amen so both thorns and briers everything is being rained on yep it's it's the rain the rain that causes things to happen the the rain actually be make it'll it'll make a young person or somebody that's an unbeliever begin to realize that there's actually something Supernatural taking place in here now that's why you you know you go over to the third seal and brother randam begins to talk he gets to that place in the third seal where he said notice here's the good part now now I I I think we all ought to listen when when a prophet of God said here's the good part and the good part he talking about is the rain and he said he said the lamb actually spoke from the throne he said it wasn't a beast this time but it was the lamb that spoke from the throne and said notice see that thou hurt not this oil and wine just a little bit of it left brother don't you touch that he said I'll give you a few verses and what he goes on and he says oil typifies the spirit so now oil typify spirit and wine symbolizes stimulation of Revelation he said boy I like to run all over the place so in other words the lamb actually spoke from the throne you got to protect that protect that running all over the place protect getting excited about a real Revel what is it it's it's you're not getting excited over like a Buddhist or a Hindu or something emotionalism but you're getting excited over a revelation of the word of God and that is what stimulates you I can you think of anything more stimulating than to realize that all of your sins are in the sea of forgetfulness can you re recognize anything more stimulating than to realize that your sins are gone and you're spotless as the lamb that you got a lamb that has paid the price and made a way for you to look in the book or to think like John standing there how can I look at this book I'm not worthy and no man is worthy but God gave a lamb to make a way for and all that'll stimulate anybody to realize that God made a way for me to have rapturing faith it wasn't the Beast that said hurt not the oil and the wine it was the lamb and what he was saying is don't hurt that spirit that moves through the church don't hurt that spirit that where you begin to you begin to shout and begin to Rejoice over what God is doing don't quench that and you you you begin to realize that oil and wine always go together when you got a real genuine Revelation it'll make you do something it'll make you hop around it'll make you cry it'll make you want to shout because you see what God has what God has promised you you see the benefits available to you you see what God has done for you you see he come down himself with a shout and a voice and a trump and he's the one that did it he said when the truth of a promised word of God has been truly revealed to his Saints that's filled with oil they all get stimulated wine is a stimulation Glory I feel it now stimulated with joy Shout and when it does it has the same effect upon them that wine does upon a natural man because when the Revelation has been given of a truth of God and the True Believer filled with oil and the Revelation is revealed the stimulation becomes so great that it makes him behave himself abnormally right now the lamb spoke from the throne protect that it wasn't the Beast that said it was the lamb thank God for that new wine Amen to make a man so drunk on the spirit of God on the anointing that he can love somebody that hates him thank God for that new wine that could make a man so drunk until he can rejoice and not care what anybody else thinks about it where he can live a real Godly life Des spite of what the world says you know Paul's the one that said he called us peculiar y'all peculiar people peculiar why because it makes you act different it makes you live different it makes you walk different and talk different brother BR is the one that said y'all odd boss odd boss CU why we got a different kind of fun we we don't have to smoke and drink and and and and and do all those worldly things to have fun I tell you what a real Christ Holy Ghost filled Christian that's been filled with that new wine they're going to want to come to church and be around the word of God that's what we come to church for we don't come to church just to look at the preacher our arms crossed and folded with a scowl on our face but we come to church to worship cuz that's what the lamb spoke from the throne don't quench the spirit of God moving in the church don't quit that don't quit a real Holy Ghost F believer that knows what they believe to praise and worship amen oh I'm so glad I've got Jesus I ain't got the world but I've got Jesus and the third seal what does the third seal reveal that there's a difference there's a difference between the manipulation of religion that's represented by measuring out wheat barley and life at a cost with the true joy and freedom in the spirit that's symbolized by wine and oil of True Believers amen most people are measured and restricted now that's why I you know we don't want to limit in any way the move of the spirit in the church most people are measured and restricted by Earth Earthly and institutional constraints but God's anointed ones these true anointed ones remain spiritually free and Untouchable amen by this denominational system oh it's Freedom what is it it's that it's that wine it's the wine at the marriage supper that's why Jesus went to the marriage and turned the wine which brother R said was a type of the Rapture to change the nature of those grapes straight over into wine without any kind of a process and it's the wine at our marriage was turning the wine at that marriage but this is the new wine at our marriage but why cuz he saved the best for last and you know Revelation is built to stimulate the bride but all that denominational tradition and everything will bind will will kill the effect of Revelation but Revelation is built to stimulate the bride amen and that's why I'm not such a big fan of tradition you just got to keep moving on tradition is all the washing pots and doing things well we've always done it this way we've all we can't change we we've always done it that way and God just keeps moving right on the denomination of the world we can't we can't change we've always done it like this we've always we we've always had our our baptismal pot in the middle of the aisle like that church we we can't change we've we've always done it like this but revelation will stimulate the bride into action and get to moving and this message will produce an anointing all right amen what what how does this anointing come by thinking think about God's word amen just get in that in get in your little prayer closet sometime amen I remember brother Lis interviewed a brother I'm not going to call his name out but he was talking to him about how do you he was asking him how do you pray and he said well I'm I'm a little bit odd the brother said this he said I go into my closet and I just shut the door and I turn the light off and I just begin to think about God's word then that that might be a different approach that you hadn't tried before when you when you pray but just go into your prayer closet and think about what God Said or maybe an alternative way is is get your message book open and just slowly or your Bible slowly start going through and read one verse at a time and and sit on it and think what what does this mean and as you sit and think and digest and hold it in your heart then that's when God can come on the scene just like he did to Mary who was meditating on that scripture a virgin shall conceive and God will come on the scene and he will he will begin to put the pieces together well you read this uh uh maybe a year ago and now that goes with this and you thought this wasn't connected but now it's coming together and now the picture is connected and and I'm saying it like this because it is a requirement you cannot depend on the preacher you must have your own relationship with God you must know for yourself that the fruits can be manifested in your life right what's the fruit the dynamic expression of the mechanics that you have heard amen the fruit is the dynamic expression of the mechanics so the mechanics might be like you you know you you go chop up a lot of firewood and you got it all stacked that's the mechanics y but then you throw a match into it boom the mechanics turns into the Dynamics right now that's where we get confused a lot of times we think well the Dynamics and the mechanics are separate you got to have the mechanics first to have the Dynamics and what is the mechanics it's the word of God and you go chopping all that firewood down or like Ruth Gathering all the sheaves in the field over and over and then you've got it all stacked now all it takes is a match to be thrown into it and it ignites now it is the fruits the dynamic expression of the mechanics the lived the the doctrine that you've heard actually lived out so now now you can see that the fruit we're we're past y'all y'all sung a little bit so I'm going to preach a little bit y'all I'm going to take my time we only got one service so y'all going to have to deal with it and the Lamb of the dove brother said now the fruit of the spirit is not joining church right the fruit of the spirit is not smoking cigarettes come on or or quit smoking cigarettes the fruit is not to speak with tongues the fruit is not to pray for the sick and they be healed the fruit of the spirit is not to prophesy or preach but the fruit of the spirit is found in the Galatians 5:22 and now Paul's taking that symbolic match and throw into the wood pile it's love it's joy peace goodness long suffering Faith meekness gentleness amen that's the fruit of the spirit now he said no matter how much you preach you got a real ill temper don't do you much good to preach right no matter how much you join church and try to impersonate if you're cra and nasty with your neighbor you'll never win him to Christ in see it's the fruit of the spirit as my wife used to tell me actions speak louder than words now now there's where you get into the you talk about getting into the seals Y what does this got to do with the seals we've been preaching in symbols for so long this is a symbol of this this is a symbol of that until all of a sudden you see the symbol come into reality it's something it's the mechanic laying there on the page that you can look at it's stacked up nice stacked up cordwood it's stacked up real nice and you can talk about it and everything but now that's why now is not the time to preach in symbols it's a living reality manifested in his bride in this day so I we could almost say with boldness that if you're preaching in symbol form now you're actually not preaching the revealed word of the day because the message is no longer in symbol form you know looking back at and the days going by it's like you know some times pre people would preach things vaguely with great gaps and understanding and and not really say things clearly or plainly but that time's over amen it it's time to preach it clearly and plainly because the Revel the book has been opened and we can see clearly clearly what that Lon is a genuine Holy Ghost anointing in a believer's life clearly what that white horse rider is a power of the Antichrist moving in the people to elevate a a a leader over them what is it it's the the the spirit in the people to elevate and express somebody over them that finally manifest and somebody that will go over in in Israel and sit down and take over his it will manifest in a beast right and and and we can see all these symbols of the ab bow with no erors that it's the devil bluffing you a bluff a bluff against the real Christian that knows where he stands and now we're not preaching and symbol anymore but we're preaching a living reality and brother will say now that's Thunder against the enemy when you've got these real fruits the fruit of a real believer manifested in your flesh really lived out lived out that what was first expressed in symbol but now is expressed in your in your two feet in your two hands behind your eyes it's actually lived out in your understanding that now you've got the mind of Christ which brother Brown said was the character of Christ you've got the mind of Christ which is the character of Christ and now you've got the same Doctrine the same life the same characteristics that's Thunder against the enemy brother R said it was it's conf it was confusing to him y y'all okay for a few more minutes amen he said it was my Earnest desire to learn all that I could about these gifts so I decided to talk to these two men at this Pentecostal meeting because it's confusing about this anointing you see somebody rejoicing and worshiping and a genuine anointing what's going on and he said through the gift of God resident in me I sought to know the spirit and the first man and we all know the story so I'm kind of glossing over quickly over over the the background there was there was two men one speaking in tongues one interpreting and and the Holy Ghost was really moving in that meeting and so he wanted to talk to him he said after a brief conversation with that sweet humble brother this genuine brother was sweet and humble I knew that he was a genuine solid Christian he was real the next young man was not at all like the first one now he's going to get to the part where he can see the adultery living in his life and everything but before he gets to that what does he say he was boastful and proud and as I spoke to him a vision moved across my eyes and I saw that he was married to a blind lady but was living with a brunette and had two children by her if ever there was a hypocrite he was one now this would be confusing to anybody you you know I I I was talking to somebody recently that kind of a mark of your spiritual maturity is that as you grow in Christ things that used to really be confusing begin to get ironed out exactly right and brother random said he said now I was confused sure enough I thought I had come into Angels then I wondered if I wasn't among Devils right now could you imagine now really put yourself in his shoes to be in an anointed Pentecostal meeting where people are running the aisles and speaking in tongues and interpreting tongues but because of his gift he could tell this person ain't true what makes you genuine it's the word yes that you've heard the word and you've held on to the word until it's it's got you into the rhythm of the word for your day not the rhythm of a bygone age like a vulture eating on some maggoty meat but an eagle eating on a present tense revealed word for your day some meat that's got some blood in it some life that will transform you and change your character now now there's the difference it's not the emotions or the feelings are Sensations that we live by but it's the word of God and I'm I'm I'm I'm close give me five minutes and I'm going to close in John chapter 6 Jesus said verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you have no life in you you you don't have any life it don't matter how much you pray and how much you fast if you don't eat his flesh and drink his blood you don't have life that's right brother I want go on to say he said we're living by dead substance that's the only way that you can live and if something has to die every day so you live natural then isn't it true that if your body has to live by dead substance for natural life then you got to have something die spiritually to save your spiritual life and God became material flesh and died that we might live fulfilling that type in the Old Testament of where God had to have a way to differentiate the Israelites from the Egyptians and so he had to K had them kill the lamb and go behind the blood that they put over the Len of their door and eat the whole thing and they had to eat that thing eat it all and that was the differentiation they went in there behind the shed blood and that differentiated the true and the false and that still is the same differentiation today you eat the revealed word for your day and while the rest of the world might be shouting and under emotionalism and things but yet you're in a soble sober relationship with God eating that Mana that fell down from God where Jesus said I am the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat of this bread he shall live forever and the bread that I will give is my flesh which I will give for the life of the world as the musicians come he said it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life oh my friends we're not coming to church in vain but if you're actually receptive to the word that you are hearing and you meditate it soberly something is actually transforming your mind and your character and your being until you are manifesting the doctrine that you have heard it's living out in you and brother R would go on to say he said it's actually a sign of the end a sign of the end that these things are being known in Matthew 24 it would be a sign of the end now aren't you glad this morning that you can tell the difference and not in a finger pointing way right but in an introspection way where you can look in the mirror of God's word and say my life my faith is not grounded upon what another man says about me my life and my faith is not grounded on emotionalism my life and not and my faith is not grounded upon whether I follow a certain Ministry or not but it is solely based upon the word of God and a personal revelation between me and God alone and nobody else oh I think that's why Jesus brother R preached that sermon that when he preached the Rapture he was quoting David hide me in thy Pavilion where just me and God Alone not based upon what somebody else says about me not based upon any other credentials but my credentials are the word of God and the life token that has been applied over the L of my doorpost God bless you as we stand to thank you [Applause] [Music] Lord in me a clean heart oh God and renew a right Spirit within was that your desire this morning won't you worship him a little bit Paul told Timothy don't quench the spirit we don't want to quench the spirit we want to turn it loose and the word's been preached and the Word was sent to loose the spirit in our lives oh worship him this morning if you have a need we'll be glad to pray you with me oh I know he's here he promised he would be cast me not from my Pres oh [Music] Lord take not th holy I'll just wait on it there love me the joy of th you need little restoration this morning won you just reach up to him David said Resto me the joy in Me God and renew a right Spirit Within [Music] Me cre in me Lord a clean heart God and renew a right Spirit Within Me Oh cast me not away from th presence oh Lord take not thy Holy Spirit from me from me restore to me oh the door of thy salvation and reew our right Spirit Within [Music] amen hallelujah that's what I want a right Spirit Hall the right character the right nature so that when others look at me life my life they're not pushed away from the gospel they're drawn to it that's why Jesus said ye are the salt of the earth don't hide your light under a bushel but let the whole world see what a real Christian is that others can be drawn to this gospel that's what I want my my nature to be changed all the meanness all the hatefulness all the things of this world just drop away until there ain't nothing left but Christ amen that's my desire do you have any announcements God bless you Saints brother good to be in the house of the Lord and that was great it was wonderful we sure appreciate brother Bob appreciate the Lord being with us today good to see all of you here God bless you uh I know some of you wondering why I'm here but U I got up

I come on home I'd rather be here you guys I'd rather be worshiping the Lord amen I like to go hunting but I sure do like to come back here and Worship the Lord so if y'all will be seated for a minute sister Regina's got a uh something she wants to uh um an exhortation for you to listen to um we also going have choir practice after this service we also going to have choir practice we are y'all going to have choir practice after the service is over all are invited yeah hi y'all I want to talk a little bit let me just gather myself I waited all morning and this is not an easy subject to talk about so I'm just going to talk and uh get my heart to calm down and my knees to stop shaking first I want to talk about what um brother Wade brought last week about the chosen what the chosen does for me is it makes me go to the word the characters I want to go and read up on them the situations I want to go and read up on it so I don't know if you've checked it out or not but it's helped me in that way that gives us that Ryan time that every little bit helps um I want to this is a spin-off from My Voice by the way forgive me if you can't hear me um the doctor's checking out a chemical burn from that plume down there from that biolab so I might have to call on the in-house interpreters better have to interpret for me anyway um a CP of it's about the scam is what brother Louise talked about last Sunday I'm going drop a couple of nuggets just a quick two of them um I was before I get to that one I was robbed at the library a few years ago it's about focus and awareness now sometimes when you have Focus your awareness diminishes because I was so focused on the screen I was on the computer my purse was right by um the keyboard and that person over there in that next cubicle took a wallet out now I'm OCD so I had two wallets I'm upset about the fact that they took my um $50 gift card for Cheesecake Factory hello all right the other one is um we have a lot of Travelers and you just have to be aware wherever you go um I went on a cruise back in 2015 with uh 13 other women and one of the stops was Rome I didn't go into Rome cuz I spent a I was blessed to spend a lot of time in Rome when I was a flight attendant so I didn't go in matter of fact with that y'all i s I went to see a pope Ling in state that was pretty awesome you know the nuns are lined up it's a like a mile or two to get to the Vatican Down The Long walkway and they were lined up on each side singing harmoniously you know that and then the pope was lying in state dressed to the nines his pontiff was leather maroon shoes to match it was awesome but anyway get back to the point uh so the women went a couple of women went into Rome and while they were on the tram they got robbed now the trim is crowded you know tourists well the locals know that's where they get their income from one lady had her pouch right here on her chest y'all on her chest he went in or they went in unzipped it took $400 out of that pouch right on her chest that's how savvy what's going on here okay um the other lady had her uh fanny pack on her hip went in took $200 out so just be aware wherever you go this stuff is happening now to the main thing I wanted to talk about is the scam I was scammed two two months ago um how does this happen to a woman whose work since she was 12 years who's a good Steward of her monies who worked for a credit card w h here for 10 years who caught a fraud case while working there you ask how does this happen to me possible factors are I'm home alone have been for a year um cesing from my knee shut off from the world is how this possibly could have happened we had a court case from the Connecticut situation when my sister passed the step children contesting her will we had a virtual court case soon as that shut down this screen popped up on this laptop that I don't even use I only have the laptop for my book loud like brother Louise said that roaring lion it was an alarm on it in everything that roaring lion took Regina out of her body because that's the only way I can explain this it was an out of it felt like an outof Body Experience y'all I'm very mindful of my money I'm very mindful of stuff like that they said call Microsoft security I did I got this fake Eric of course and he said let's take a look there's $110,000 coming through on your card we need to call your bank put a 72-hour Security on it the guy sitting next to him I'm sure we got on the phone Stefan I don't remember if I gave him my bank he just transferred me okay y'all um that Stefan put a 72h hour Security on it and then he tells me the way to do away with that charge is to charge another 10,000 hello y'all it's real it's real and so he instructed me asked me if I was dress and everything I said well you know none of your business but he said okay let me look up where you can go to do this he said Lowe's and Conor that wasn't Regina that got in her car y'all and went to Lowe's and purchased five gift cards $2,000 each okay two and then tell you to make up a story for the cashier get back in your car they're on the phone with you the whole time get back in your car drive to another her parking lot scratch that off take pictures and send it to us tell me how that happens it's out of body it's that roaring lion Regina wouldn't have never done that so I do that and they're still on the phone with you until you till I got home they were on the phone with me for four hours y'all four hours till I drove back into my and told me not to talk to family or friends yeah cuz I'm under a security watch at that time hung up when I got back to my driveway couple hours later I'm going to wrap it up couple hours later I'm sitting there and I'm like Regina enters back into my body and I say let me check and see if there's $10,000 coming through on my card there wasn't so I shut the cards oh another thing they said if you can't put it all on your Wells Fargo use any card Regina would have caught that y'all so I checked shut down my cards put a freeze on my credit report notified Federal Trade Commission next day I went to the police I call Lowe's now the next day got a manager so-called Kate Gail she was familiar with the gift card scams but Gail what is your company doing about it but I'm sharing that with y'all just to Peak your awareness we've got a lot of people traveling y'all traveling out of the country just be aware okay cuz it happens it happens so smoothly off the chest they went in her she didn't feel it so just be aware of wherever you go you know wherever you go sure we're under the armor of God but just be aware okay all right that's all [Applause] thanks yall shouldn't have clapped at that but glad you listen thank you but just be careful Amen Let be real careful it's a expensive lesson to learn and let me tell you one thing just to help you with that if any person calls you and tells you they're from the IRS the IRS I work for the post office so I know the IRS will not talk to you on the phone they'll send you a certified letter and give you a number to call and it's a certified letter I have to hand to brother Dy and he's got a sign for it that he received it so anybody call you said they from the IRS just hang phone up right and they'll tell you that you owe back taxes and that the sheriff is coming to get you right they did that to me one time when I was out fishing with brother claw in the middle of lake in Oklahoma I said if you can find me come on hung the phone up we'll put you in
