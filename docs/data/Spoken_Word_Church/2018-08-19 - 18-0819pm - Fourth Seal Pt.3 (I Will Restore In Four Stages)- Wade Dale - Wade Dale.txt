just said that you said I want to see him well you'll see them in the word today if that's what you wanted I know that sure it's because you love him things anybody ever once get brother Joe something give him a zebra pen he must eat him I don't and they're hard stainless steel I don't know what he gets out of it but he loves those things but good to be in the house the Lord gonna be back could see smiling faces we heard some good word while we were gone and we're gonna continue to do what we do and try to help you help you learn about the Lord a little bit more I was thinking you know these it's the fivefold ministry in the fivefold ministry they got different angles to come the same way so we we believe that you're not gonna get it without it so to me that's pretty cut-and-dry you're not gonna get perfective without a fivefold ministry so if you believe in anything else you're not gonna get it it's just a way then i turned the fan on this morning the thing that is still a little warm though but yeah okay if you got your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Revelations and just get started we are still on the fourth seal this will be part three I will restore in four stages because we're on the fourth seal I told you there was some fours that we need to look at so the fourth seal it even talks about the fourth part of the earth falling for Satan's life so we're gonna kind of look at the four stages today and in the Bible and also in the prophets message so if you would let's bow our heads and we'll get started the Lord Jesus we thank you for this day Lord we come under complete anticipation that you'll speak to us that you'll move us out of the way and as we were talking in this Bible School downstairs Lord this morning just let us be a conduit Lord let nothing stop in our human brain Lord may it all go straight to our heart where we can hear from you Father you'd be the one that does the speaking father you'd be the one that does the revealing because there's no way the human mortal man can reveal or even understand your word it takes a complete revelation from you Lord we ask you to be with us now Lord and take care of us during the further ment of this service bless the ones that are not here bless the ones that are on the highways traveling the ones that are away from us Lord the ones that are sick we actually do to heal them now father as the word goes forth you said you sent your word and healed the people and you delivered them from destruction so father we believe that it's not just something we quote we believe that as this word goes forth there's healing power their salvation - this word Lord there's healing there's deliverance all the many things that we well honestly we wouldn't be here Lord if we didn't think it would help us amen we we believe that you're here to help us we believe the word that's going to help us and we believe that as the brother said the other day we are going to either leave here better or worse so let us all leave here better today Lord knowing that you spoke to us this afternoon father bless us now take care of us Jesus name we pray amen revelation 6 verse 1 and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see and now looked and behold a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with the sword and with hunger and with death and with the beasts of the earth that's four things if you'll notice that sword hunger death and with the beasts of the earth so we're going to kind of deal with force today because I will restore will be in four stages joel 2:24 tells us this now here's the here's the here's the set up to me for the end time because you and I are truly the children of Zion now we know this is talking to Israel but we get it first if God doesn't restore a work in us he's not gonna go to Israel no ma'am alright but so he is going to be glad then you children of Zion who's glad today who's glad who's rejoicing today well then let's put the scripture together and rejoice in the Lord their God for he hath given you not the neighbor he's giving it to you he has given you the former rain moderately not just in dribbles moderately because you know you can have a you say well oh Lord reigneth storm them no you don't want that you can't handle it he knows what you can handle you can actually drown a plant by putting too much water on it he knows what you want and what you need and he puts it together for you so he's gonna give you the former rain moderately which is what the teaching rain swine took sixty years since the prophets left took for us to break the word down so that we can all understand it man cuz you didn't understand it in 1965 if you were even alive neither did I and we're just beginning now to learn what the Prophet came to do amen and he came to give the word to you and I to get us out of here and he will cause to come down for you the rain the former and the latter rain in the first month all right so it's gonna be a quick work the former rain is what teaching rain latter rain is the harvest rain so we're now in the harvest time and then and what happens about October we'll get into this in a second what happens in about October the life starts coming out of the plant goes into the root and then so that you can harvest because if you harvest in it with the life in the tree or plant you kill it amen but when the life goes down you can harvest it but we'll get to that because remember I will restore though I will restore to you verse 25 100 verse 24 and the floors shall be full of wheat wheat staff of life something you can eat and the fat shall overflow not just dribble not just sprinkle but overflow with what wine and oil we know what the wine and all is right the wine is the stimulation of Revelation and the oil is the Holy Ghost all right he's gonna pour out the Holy Ghost moderately in the end time feed us with wheat and I will restore to you the years years 2000 years I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the cankerworm then the caterpillar and the Palma worm my great army which I stood among you and you shall eat in plenty and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God that has dealt wonderfully with you and my people shall never be ashamed you may be seated in the Lord at his blessing to the reading the word Windigo needs we're not gonna need the chart today we're just gonna kind of we're gonna review because it's been a few weeks but we know we're on the fourth seal and the fourth seal has a great meaning to me because it should have a great meaning to you because the rapture takes place on that fourth seal alright that alright say ma'am all right we're gonna try to all stay awake today hey man hey man okay alright so let's read what brother Branham says on the fifth seal we read it a couple of weeks ago but I want you to see this what a prophet told us what was going to happen I'm going to set this box up here to represent that if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing that they can work by okay so Martin Luther had a box the just shall live by faith that was his message not sanctification not the other message he had a message and that people lived by that message if God sends a certain spirit among them that's the only thing they can work by is the spirit that works among them now will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals so must be by the opening of the seals we see what each box is what each power that was given to the church and how that Satan eat the power down because remember if you restore that means it was up here it come to here and then you had to restore it back redemptions not replacement Redemption is we were lost now we're going back amen I will restore him that's what he's doing right now every time you come into Church service every time you read the Bible every time you pray he's restoring it back to the condition that it was supposed to be in and we will prove to you by the history of the church and by the opening of the seals and the powers that let loose and watch exactly the church respond to the anointing and they couldn't do nothing else all right so you and I are under what we're under the eagle anointing let's read them let's read number two I'm just kind of review a little bit for you we're in the fourth seal but it's the seventh Church age now what you've got a chart I gave you all the chart you should all know that we are in the last Church age then and then notice the four beasts that was sent forth to come forth beasts that was set forth to combat the Antichrist and this last beast are you ready the last beast that was sent forth or the last power to combat the Antichrist who was against the teaching of God the Antichrist was an eagle see the fourth living beast was an eagle now you just study the age you study the scripture it's an eagle and then the Bible the last age was an eagle age and God likens the Eagles to his prophets now watch the last days the Eagle age a revealer of the true word now remember it wasn't that they had false word and so much it was all false no there was a little bit of truth they had their box Martin Luther had his boss God said all right and you start with the just shall live by faith I'm gonna anoint that save a group of people but that group of people he's gonna have to live under that the whole age then you got your lap overs because then you come to sanctification they quit going to pubs and drinking beer and and you know even Martin Luther said he wanted to get rid of the Jews said they were worthless people when that was you know what that wasn't God that was Martin Luther and then that was that was Martin Luther's idea that wasn't God's idea amen but the just shall live by faith that was God that was the quickening that God brought to Martin Luther God knew Martin Luther was the only one that can handle that give it to somebody else same way we're brother branham in the Eagle Age there was no one built to take that except William Marion Branham the only one to take that pressure but you know what in him taking the pressure he opened the skies so that you and I could take the pressure he opened up the revelation showed that you and I we don't have to we don't have to look to he wasn't talking about mama Eagle being him mama Eagle was God mama eagle was Christ still is Christ and that's who he pointed us to a true prophet will always point you to Christ never to himself but now what do we do is man we pointing to William Branham no you can't do that you'll lose every time amen revelations 3:14 let's look at what our what our age gives us into the a angel the Church of the layout of sins write these things saith the Amen the faithful and true witness the beginning of the creation of God look at those fours the Amen the faithful the true witness the beginning the creation of God I know that works the tower and neither cold nor hot I would that work cold or hot so then because thou art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because Dow says he didn't say that Dow says I am rich and increased with Goods and have need of nothing and knowest not that thou art wretched and miserable or blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire the telling us be rich and white raiment that thou must be clothed and that the shame of thy nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with eyesalve that they may see that now that's our anointing so God has sent that to take care of all the things that he said before that we were blind miserable and wretched and miserable and naked and don't know it as many as I love I rebuke and chasten be zealous therefore and repent behold I stand at the door and knock If any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and will sup with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I have overcome and I'm sitting down with my father in his throne he doesn't have an ear let him hear what the spirit saith unto the churches all right so everybody okay with that that's where we come up to the anointing of what you're sitting under right now not another age not the age before they're norming we're sitting under right now is that anointing that we're talking about but he's going to restore by of me I said buy of me these things buy of me gold it's something we have to do because when we come out of the church age we know that church age is going to go through all these but you and I are called out of the age but now sure it affects us amen it affects us we're all affected by the by the Laodicean Church age but we don't have to be of the Laodicean Church age we can live in the Laodicean Church age but we were called out just like all the other bride was called out of every church age so now let's go back to this and read revelation it's going to want you to remember a few things and then we'll get started this is just a review from what we read the last time and when he had opened the fourth seal I heard the voice of the fourth beast say come and see now what was that fourth beast ego you can participate you know what if you'll talk back to me you won't go to sleep what fourth beast was a and I loved him behold the pale horse that was a pale horse and his name that sat on him was death so remember he got a name and hell followed with him and power was given unto them over the fourth part of the earth to kill with a sword hunger death and with the beasts of the earth all right so that's your that's the anointing under the revelation 6 and we had opened the fourth seal verse seven and eight there's your fourth seal now we got to remember to scroll it on up all the way oh what it will remember keep this in your mind as we're going through the fourth seal here are our keys in the fifth seal we are not here in the fifth seal there is nothing to the Gentiles it is it actually it goes into another dimension there's another dominicos in I saw the souls under the altar will the souls on the altar or not here they're in another dimension alright then alright say ma'am alright so now here's the keys to what we need to look for because if the rapture takes place in the fourth seal and brother Dale was hitting on it this morning some death has to be destroyed a resurrection has to take place and a rapture takes place on this seal so guess what there's a group of people comes to the statue of a perfect man there's a group of people that comes to a place to where death doesn't have a dominion over them anymore under this fourth seal when we see a break for us we see a rapture so we must see the perfection of a bride in this fourth seal that's why I was telling you he must restore now sure he started restoration way back a man he started a restoration way back but remember even when you come to the fourth church aids now not the fourth seal the fourth Church age they wet in the ground they went in the ground they didn't though the word was eat down by this we're going to get to in just a minute it went in the ground but have you ever thought about this though let's get to these symbols and then we'll then we'll get started cause if something we want to want you to see that's really kind of interesting the symbols then is a pale horse what is the pale horse Red Horse white horse black horse mixed together and it's a putrid pale greenish gooey globby there's nothing good to look at and then and we now know that his name is death it what it didn't mean that his name wasn't death back then it's just now he's been revealed he's been made known in the apex of Satan's domain we should know the only way that's going to be destroyed is is when Satan comes I'm gonna read your scripture in a minute the prince of this world has come and has nothing jesus said nothing in me so if the bridegroom gets it then the bride is supposed to get it amen so pale horse named death here we go again power was given to that person and then a fourth part of the earth was deceived now we know more than that is but it had to start somewhere a fourth part of the earth and that fourth part of the earth now is 99 percent of the earth right but it had to start somewhere a fourth part of the earth fell was Satan will read that in a minute because remember under this sealed the prophet of God said under this seal Satan's cast out of heaven you know where he comes we know he was cast out way before and he came down here and he's been in doing his work but he's got to be cast out of me and you he's got to be cast out of this church amen all right let's read the next one and you know what it happens you saw Austin impossible it's just an impossibility you need to start become a believer first once you become a believer then you can't believe what God's already said about you not what he's going to say listen this Bible is not this Bible is not going to be rewritten the Bible is going to be lived that's the problem is we got a live dead letter but it's not dead the good because I'll prove to you in just a minute all them bugs eat eat eat eat eat but they never got to the root jesus said I am the root and offspring of David you'll never get to that because like I said before what about what about in in November when it gets really cold if all the trees still have leaves and fruit on it it's no good the Treo die leaves to fall off and then and the fruit of rot so God knows what he's doing so when we come down to the latter reign of the harvest reign the harvest comes in October somewhere in there you know about coming up this time of the year Natan in a couple of months but what happens is the life goes down into the root and they harvest it look this is the fourth seal notice they find that this fellow here is an eagle that's what I was just talking about this man that are this living creature that's poured forth here now or in other words there's four different ages of it there was an age of the line we find out being the fourth age he said come and see the fourth mystery is what I want you see the fourth mystery of the book of redemption that's been hidden in this book it's still talking about redemption because look let me be a real frank with you and then when this fourth seal breaks redemptions over they were always saying redemption was over in the seventh seal redemptions over on the fourth seal for the Gentiles hey man redemption is over because we can't go in the rapture unless redemptions over and then so we'll come and look at the fourth mystery of the book of redemption that's been hidden this book come see John went to see and he saw a pale horse and again the same rider upon this pale horse now he has a name called death all right let's go to the next now notice none of the other riders none of the other horses are no time that this rider ever rode that man had no name because you know what let's just be real truthful there was people in the Catholic Church that got born again hey man Martin Luther was a Catholic he still had the ideas of the Catholic Church God birthed them under the just shall live by faith which brought them out people were mourning in under Baptist faith a presbyterian faith a Lutheran faith amen but there was no further for them to go but God knew that that's okay he put him away a man hit him you know put him in another dimension waiting on who waiting on us that the full words come and then we come out of all that we come out of all that sure we had these different ideas we all did and then even though you didn't have an idea of a Baptist or Methodist Presbyterian Pentecost or whatever you still had ideas contrary to God amen but now he's called death it's not mentioned he's revealed now what he is death well how we linger on that for a sermon and make it real plain but anything that's anti that's against a real has to be death because there's only two subjects life and death that's it amen and that proves that the Holy Spirit revelation of this in this day is exactly the truth why because it's showing the anti the Antichrist is riding away the Anti Christ doctrine is being made known and being what pushed out and that proves that the Holy Spirit's revelation of this and this day is exactly the truth the anti he's death because the word as we'll see later here is life see and this man is called death let's go to them go and read the other one get it get these four done and then we'll now look the fourth seal now it was not mentioned other times of this rider but since not now it's mentioned that he's called death but under the revelation of the line now watch I want you to read this close so I'd be sure wrote down to place stand here in other words he whatever he's writing said stop and tell them what's going on not under the revelation of the line age now look the line age was what know what don't you see the revelation of the line age was all these faith of the fathers God working the little nod from God right but he went revealed exactly who the Antichrist was amen they were still a little something I'm telling you right there now under the revelation of a lion age of the first age early age this wasn't revealed the next stage was the age of the arts because remember in the first age we didn't go through it we're going to go through it now I've kind of left it off until now that it becomes a what saying a deed a doctrine incarnate are we going to look we're gonna see false prophet we're going to see incarnate false prophet we're gonna see all that just in a minute okay but you see how it started so innocent then it wasn't even call it an antichrist until what until John went to Patmos and saw Antichrist and come back Paul said Grievous wolves what is he saying already among you it's death grievious wolves have come and one of the ones Grievous wolves did they what kill you the next stage was the age of the arts which is the Dark Age the middle age it wasn't revealed as it that's what it was nor the man-like beasts of wisdom representing the Reformers Luther and Wesley and so forth it wasn't revealed but in the Eagle AIDS the last days the prophetic age were there is to rise prophetic utterance to whom the secrets always comes now folks huh I say that's me and you we must under we have we have we are born under a prophetic utterance brother Branham said I now call you bride he separated that church and bride he separated it so much he said I now call you Brian well that's prophetic utterance nobody had ever said that Luther never come out and said well now there's a bride and there's a church no he was just a church Wesley was just the church the Pentecost was definitely just the church the church this and the church that Oh everybody called themself bride but they didn't know what to do they know how to handle the Word of God but in the Eagle lays the last days the prophetic age where there is to rise prophetic utterance where did you ever see anybody come together like brother Branham didn't and aside from the discernment because that was a different gift hello brother branham said dad he said this was what bait on hook this is the hook the bait on the hook was the signs and wonders that's the hook the revelation what to catch the trout so you see brother branham he comes any put-put statue a perfect man together puts Daniel seven new weeks together the seals come together all these different things that brother brown them he he's the prophet he can turn a corner he build a building none of these others could do that you know what they weren't required because it wasn't in their box it wasn't in their box to see that then you come to the next and the next and next but when you come to us it's in our box it's a requirement for us to see these things hey man it's not a requirement just to live a good Christian life well yes a requirement but in this age we were required to sit with Christ in his throne and folks that's Incarnate God because it's not you and him and God sitting on a throne because that's Trinity it's not you and Christ sitting on the throne that's two lords that's telling them downstairs you know we got this joint our thing down yet we ain't got this year gods we ain't got this come from God went back to God we ain't got all that down yet but we're getting it we're getting it I think we're getting it all right let's read number five on the fourth seal he's still talking look see the writer the first place as an antichrist he was death to begin with but he's so innocent then well my he was so innocent that when he come in let me tell you how innocent this was when he comes in with a father son Holy Ghost baptism everybody except there are no sure there was a few my mean of my newphew that didn't accept it but most people 99% of the people in the religious world accepted that doctrine and you know what God had to wink at it he winked at it cuz everybody accepted it amen but now watch see look that's not in our box it's not in our box to accept that we've been told the truth father son Holy Ghost might have been okay in Pentecost and Luther and Wesley but now he requires all what all to repent repent of what repented of repent of the things we thought before that's what I have to repent of my ideas but he's innocent then then he received a crown what they voted a Pope in and come in with Constantine put a pope in a triple one and when he did then he United Constantine broke church and state together Satan United his church and state because he was over both of them then Antichrist was Satan in the form of a man now then when we find out this mystery here in his church and state the fourth stage of his ministry he's called the beast first he's called the Antichrist then he's called false prophet and called the Beast now we find him being called as the beef now watch I want you to watch though what he brings the four in though that's just three once you bring the four now I want you to notice that after the fourth horse and in this fourth horse if you'll notice the first one was white the next one was red in the next one was black and the fourth one all of these other three were represented in it because pale is red and white and so mixed together because you know if you dig in deep there's only justification sanctification baptism the Holy Ghost but there is a pummel worm and locusts the caterpillar and whatever the other thing is I got it written down here Pawar and locust caterpillar can't go worming no wonder I can't remember canker can't go worm but if for eat it down for had to raise it back up okay God had to combat it with the four and the other what happened is is the three the three was mixed into the one to make the one when something different same three colors mixed together to make the fourth color all right now look see there he become four or actually the three and one it was all mixed up in that one thing all right there be okay with that say ma'am all right so we got four we're looking at four stages we're looking at four things that we're going to take now and look at and see if we can put this thing all together so now look going up to four stages bring it all the way up now look all ate away at the parts of the tree but they couldn't get to the life you can't kill God you can't kill God now tell you what they did do you know where they you know where they tried to kill him at don't you what do they kill him on what they kill Christ on a tree that had no leaf no bark no fruit and no wife but the very life that created the tree the root was hanging on that cross with me inside of him so I don't have to hang on that old tree no more God's already done it for us look at all the things he's done for us yeah I was thinking I just thinking about that a few minutes ago I looked down and I thought so all those all those things cuz one's eat the fruit one eat the leave ones eat the bark and one sucks it to life that's what he was hung on he was hung on a denominational tree that had no wife in it at all no Bart no leaves no fruit but the very fruit himself the very seed offspring root everything was hanging on that tree the very life look the very life of God was hanging on that tree that's where we will find our restoration I will restore all the years and it looks to foresee a look now I want to notice the four of them I notice off marker four of the spiritual mathematics God is 3 this is 4 he's in four here first Antichrist comes remember when he started off he was anti against the word all right so it was Antichrist second false prophet what they brought them all together and started teaching them a false doctrine from men the Spirit went in men wait listen there's not some spirit gonna come through that wall and teach us something they might anoint you to do something but they're not gonna walk through that door and deceive you and to believe in something but when that spirit goes inside of a man and that man gets you to see it there's your false prophet read third Vakar of heaven and earth and purgatory black remember that's when they crowned him fourth the beasts pale horse Satan being kicked out of heaven and we're reading in just a minute so we see in the fourth one that Satan gets kicked out of heaven now look let's go back just for a minute they don't have this on them on the screen but I want to want to read something right here brother Branham says the Palmer worm locust caterpillar and cankerworm no don't worry about that it's not gonna be on here I'm just gonna read it here because you got the devil is in the Palmer warn locust caterpillar and can't go worm right and just like what we were talking about the Palmer worm begins to eat at the fruit of the Spirit so guess what if he ate the fruit of the Spirit down and we're going to come to restoration then the fruit of the spirits got to come back in the church and then the locust eats the leaves that's fellowship all right we are with then we fellowship has to be restored fellowship is why brotherly kindness is part of fellowship well today we'll get to it a little bit later cankerworm eats the bar the Bart brother Brown said is your doctrine that doctrine was eat down the fruit of the Spirit was eating down fellowship was eating down listen the caterpillar sucks at the life the last days he sucks at the life but he can't get to the life of this tree hey man cuz brother Branham says the same God comes through justification sanctification the baptism the Holy Ghost and living the life so the four stages is what justification sanctification the baptism of Holy Ghost and then incarnate God incarnate God must be in this age what's this let's continue reading bring that back up let's read this see what brother Brent said the bed on it I'll let him tell you look at paragraph 165 let's going up because remember he's incarnate in the Beast whoa whoa right there 165 now you see he was cast out of the earth and becomes incarnate I mean he really meant cast out of heaven you know that don't you he was cast out of heaven all right and became incarnate but now also that could not be that could be talking to me and you because he's gonna have to come out of this earth and then as the Antichrist spirit became incarnate into a man the man changes from one thing to another from an antichrist spirit which was what people saying things in the early church age to a false prophet then they had to answer to one guy then the Beast comes in to him just exactly like the church grows his church went from Antichrist the false prophet and then the great age to come the beast that is to rise up so the church comes the same way through justification sanctification the baptism of the Holy Ghost as Christ being in the people just exactly and he's got the anti top of it over there--they this see the top of it rather there he is just exactly that's him kicked out of heaven hey by all right with that saying man so as as Satan has eat this tree down God has already got in place to bring you back and then what you and I have to see in this fourth church age is that he's got to be kicked out of us because the without that the rapture can't take place the dead Saints can't come back into this dimension and I'm like I'm like you know brother daylight everybody say rapture rapture rapture I see in the rapture that's okay you got to have a nother standing that the dead in Christ has to rise first so there has to be a resurrection message preached to get those dead Saints out of the ground then the rapture will take place amen there's got to be what this whole tree has got to be restored by fruit of the spirit leaves fellowship the doctrines got to be right we can't get them people out of the ground with the false doctrine hey man you ain't gonna get them dead people out of the ground listening to one man hello oh I'll bet my life on it so that's what the Bible says it takes a fivefold ministry to perfect the same amen so I depend on you then and you got to depend on me I don't depend on one man I don't end on one woman I depend on what Croxton a bride that we all walk up we all go up that statue of a perfect man and listen honestly some of us need to be pulled and drugged but the ones that don't need to be pulled and drugged needs to reach and get the ones that are pull they need to be pulled in drug and get them up here we're we all coming again listen we're not gonna leave this place till everybody comes to perfection we're not going so we got to preach a perfect message we're not perfect people by no means but we must preach a perfect message in this fourth seal all this has got to take place death has to be destroyed while we're standing on this earth it's not gonna come with a profit coming back it's not gonna be from one man it's gonna be brother Branham sitting rapturing faith lies in these books and tapes he's already preached it we just gotta find it we gotta find it and we got to preach it and preach it hard amen watch what Jesus said and there was war in heaven now brother Browne said go back go back one more time go back down throughout the world now this is the fourth seal this is a quote from the message the fourth seal he talks about Satan kicked out of heaven so there must be something we know for a fact that when we go up the Prophet said Satan comes down he's up there right now accusing us of everything in the world he's not accusing the Baptist he's not a kid's in the Methodist and I'm just using that as a lot or people in the message got false doctrine he's worried about me and you he's not worried about somebody one word off he's not worried about right you don't care about that he cares about the truth he attacked the true tree he attracts Christ z3d life the tree of life he attacked him so why not is he not going to thank you but God has already raised up a standard he's already give us a message to combat all this because in this fourth days we get out of here or in this fourth seal I'm sorry in the seventh Church age doesn't listen the Sabbath church age is going to keep going on we're gonna be caught up out of this age and the age is just going to keep going on amen but there's a secret catching away and that secret is I was telling him downstairs even the Apostle Paul he didn't work with a totally open book he didn't a lot of things he didn't understand but what's the paradox what we get to understand has got to come from what he wrote so he was writing in prophecy he was prophesying of a people to come battle take this and understand it and know what it means Paul says I look to a glass darkly listen we can't get the dead Saints here looking through a glass darkly because what what Paul say then though then we meet him face to face now when we meet Christ face to face on this side you know we don't meet him physically but remember he's because he's gonna be here so much forget what I just said forget what I just said he's here now he's here now he's not coming he's here now we just gotta believe he's here now because you know what we're looking for him why don't we just start looking at him that all right sometimes you know you get checked a little bit you know that he's not he's not and we got to quit saying that well well when he comes well Juanita he's here amen so we've got to come to a part this is our box you already believe it or not but I'm by finished for right now I don't want to go any further I'll get something else in next Sunday but we come to this box but in this box when this box ends and you come into the fifth seal we're going so everything's got to happen right here for us today it's the day of salvation today is the day of our restoration and I believe he is restoring look at the things we've all come through all of us even our understanding of when we weren't in church and now we're in church or will we had another church and we I don't mean come here I mean come under a revelation that what God has already give us but I watched what Christ told us he said in John 12:31 they don't have it here John 12:31 Christ said now is the judgment of this world now shall the Prince of this world be cast out John 12:32 and I if I be lifted up from the earth will draw all men unto me John 14:30 hereafter I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and has nothing in me now let's pull back up pull that back up let me read the last scripture then and that was war in heaven and Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and who's Michael Christ Christ in who the hope of glory you see that's the problem we got Michael fighting Satan over there in heaven somewhere Michael and his angels fought against the Dragon and the dragon fought and his angels I like this and prevailed not neither was their place found any more in heaven and the Great Dragon was cast out the old serpent called the devil and Satan which deceiveth the whole world he was cast out into the into the earth and his angels were cast out with him and I heard a loud voice saying in heaven it wasn't just a whisper it was a thunder it was a voice that said now is come salvation and strength and the kingdom of our God and the power of his Christ for the accuser of our brethren is cast down which accused them before our God day and night and they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death therefore rejoice ye heavens and ye that dwell in them woe to the inhabitants of the earth and of the sea for the devil has come down unto you having great wrath because he knoweth he hath but a short time under the fourth seal Satan is cast out first he's got to be cast out of us then he's cast out of heaven then what does he do he comes down and incarnate sapote I'm a person he comes down and Carnot's a person as he does that we're going up because so God then must have to incarnate his bride first because remember to all these seals the state never do anything original no way he is not he no he don't even have a seat to reproduce yourself with Amen so that means every word he's got his faults and brings nothing but death but now here you and I have come and we must have to say this right here the same thing here for I will not talk much with you for the prince of this world cometh and has nothing now he's going to Calvary looks like it looked like Satan won but the prince of this world cometh and hath nothing in me jesus said in revelation 22:16 I Jesus have sent mine angel to testify unto you these things in the churches I am the root an offspring of David and the bright and morning star hey man you love the Lord they overcome by the blood of the Lamb and by the word of their testimony and they loved not their lives unto death so we see in the fourth seal we got what we've got fruit leaves bark wife that's what's got to be restored so you know what's what's restoring that all this fellowship is being restored what did I tell you before the seals are not for remember the seals are not exactly for your new berth to get you born again no no Crocs died on the cross he said believe if you believe me I'll come and be with you even in you amen didn't say nothing about a seal but to bring back full fellowship to bring back what the restoration of what Adam had amen because before Adam fell he had full authority and he could talk to God every day anytime he wanted to he could walk right up to him and talk to him and there was no fear there was no death there was no sorrow there was nothing that could take him away from God well now if we're going to be restored back to that then we got to come back to that same condition you and I have come back to the place now where here we are what we going to do about it what we're going to do about it that's our box and one day you know what's going to happen that box is going to disappear and you know what if you're in the box you go with it if you're not in the box you don't go with it you got to stay here and walk continue in that church age and take all the wrath that comes with that Church age because you didn't accept it so these seals now we come up and when they're not for like I said they're not for so much is for to get you born again it's more to get us more in fellowship with God because what we lost was what brother Branham goes to it read reference to the bride tree fruit of the Spirit the leaves was what every time every time a breeze comes by watch the leaves one worshiping God well the old locust he started eating out of ways all they did was you know set like most of y'all did in a search service most of y'all most of y'all in the church service you know if you moved if you move you probably hurt and then the bark you know what the problem with the bark is he's give us to Lord seven thunders return ministry and all this other junk that people are preaching he took the doctrine of the church right out and put in false teaching but I will restore he promised and he's gonna do it because you know what that's what he gave us and this is what you know what we can't be born again under Luther's box God moved on God moved on we can't be can't go back there sure we live under the joy and the and the things of these other ages but that's our age our age is what destroy the devil now listen he's not annihilated but he's got to be destroyed in me and you the Prince of this world they stand the prince of this world has come he's gonna come but he has nothing in me you know what nothing you know what Jesus was saying there's no false idea there's no false doctrine there's no false I was reading where brother mom said that Jesus Christ was the pure truth everything he was was the pure truth he didn't just have the word he was the living work and in if you and I get here we go again become joint heirs then we don't just have the word we're the living work amen musicians come we are the Living Word of God made manifest that's our that what that's our inheritance our inheritance is not just I will die hallelujah by and by no I'll not die I'll be raptured by him ah I'll fly away let's look brother Joe doing a good job give credit where credit's due I had a rose I handed Oh Lord he reminds me a lot of his daddy don't you yeah his daddy was our song leader for a long time back in the 70s when Joe wasn't even he was dealing God seen the Little Master was investor with old tubes you those you'd like maybe see you were there but we were little but hey listen this is that this is our Commission keep keep on keep on don't worry about this and that coming here and there the prince of this world cometh now Jesus was going to Calvary Satan was right there brother Bram said stinging him that old stinger of death he was sitting there but what did Christ say he has nothing nothing in me he died once he died once for all let's sing a song we don't have to die folks we don't have to die as nerd bleed in stride Oh Spray that night and Hey to say they're trained for her and they were free manually listen up let your name your name named Jesus Christ you were a tax hike we have the diary thanks to their name you [Music] the truth away I will s yarn so nothing my the contrast some midnight if you should find you're a brain is on in your mind I can explain to be naturally Chow yeah your Bibles change in one hand a willful in jesusí Angie I'm insane I bet your name [Music] shorty I you [Music] no no this trees growing it's true you an animal me you up this morning you wave a sword we give you right Oh the way we bless your name I'm that your name you are the light the truth the way god bless we bless your name you know why folks we gonna have to start what we're doing is our problem is is we're not really listening to what the Bible's already give us we can sit and listen to preaching that's what we do and I believe we're as a church we're growing not just by numbers but we're growing in spirit I'd rather see growing spirit than growing numbers but growing in spirit you're gonna have problems but you know what I believe we've got something in place to handle although the Prince of this world will come [Music] remember what brother Brown said one time he said I want to be so hidden God till Satan doesn't know what to do with me yeah I mean really can you believe that you get to a place to where but you know what it's gonna have to be because Satan is death Satan is fear Satan is death those two things have to be destroyed here by the Word of God in a group of people doing the simple things like brother said you know go to church read your Bible the simple things we do but that standard has already been put there because we had a prophet coming the end time and he said hey this is what we got to do you're an astronaut now you've been pressurized for the job not in training I believe our trainings about over I believe we've come to place where the astronaut will we can walk in there we match the button fire that big engine up and take off the mass all ready been done and then the mysteries have all become history what are we doing now we're just what honing we're getting we're getting we're getting our believing into a channel and I believe if we'll hit that sure we hit it every once in a while we see miracles we see things happen but man I'm telling you brother Brown said watch when all that lightning and all that fire and all that stuff comes together gotta land on a church then well you know what he's going to do he's not going on something dead he's gonna anoint what's already there hey man because this is what's there for us our prophet told us they will be a resurrection in this endtime rapturing faith lies in the books in the tape I just believe that I'm just dumb enough to believe what he said I don't want to believe what nobody else said I won't believe what he said hey man let's sing one more song before we go [Music] [Applause] [Music] let me turn see Oh [Music] that one punch [Music] he got me and may I say of course my time [Music] oh he touched me [Music] he touch me [Music] ever [Applause] someday [Music] [Applause] No he got 13 and May [Music] get a touch from God today amen I mean you gettin real touch I mean take this with you you know we're in the final we're in the final stretch listen when you run a relay race how many people are in the relay race for the last guy needs to be what the fastest called the fear behind you won't Dan dude to catch up so I think we've handed the baton to the fourth person brother Brown passed off the scene and he handed that but time to a fast group of people this fast coming to the head to where what the work Christ can live and I died we need that more than anything right sure we got life to live sure we got jobs we got stuff to do and you know what stuff gets in the way but you know what he's got some people that has a little time how about praying for us to don't have a long time and then next Sunday before we go next Sunday we're going to have a special visitor and he has found us online a couple of years ago from I went to Minnesota and preached for me in January if you'll remember that he's named for us dunker and he's going to be here with us he watches in every Sunday but he's gonna be here with us next Saturday and Sunday he's gonna be in church service with us so I know you're treating him well because you always treat her better as well but he's really not a visitor he's just behind the camera you can't see him but he's considers herself part of our congregation he doesn't have anybody real close to to fellowship with so and man you talk about somebody's got a testimony he's got testimony but he's a real super nice guy but I'll just pray for him pray for his journey and then we'll see y'all Wednesday night Lord willing pray for the ones that are there out and and and brother Anderson in Las Vegas merci he needs prayer but you know what Jesus Walt Jesus walked with prostitutes and sinners and they didn't bother him one bit hey man then balling one bit why because the prince of this world come and didn't have nothing in him and you know what you say that you say that you say that when Satan come to you or something goes wrong hey I'm a born again child of God Satan you can't touch my soul oh you you beat me up in my brain you can beat me up in my body feel like you're not going to touch this hole you know why I tell devil devil I'm gonna live a lot longer than you are I'm a liver a whole lot longer than you are because the Bible said Lee said he'll be here for it for a short season now you and I are not gonna be here for a short season we're here for a long eternity brother John I promise you we're gonna be here we're in eternal people trapped in time if you're born again today you absolutely are an eternal creature trapped in time but one day that's gonna come together and we're gonna get out of here you love the Lord listen bow our heads your heavenly Father we pray Lord that what we've said has been pleasing to you Lord and maybe it helped the people Lord realize that we come to this opening of this fourth seal and so important to us because we leave this dimension we actually have this vile body that we're walking in changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye but before that Lord one day and I want to see that day it will be preaching you're wording Robert Tatum walks to the court sister kollene walks through the door and all the ones just went on brother Gary brother Richard Donny's mom and dad all the ones that we're thinking about now Lord we're sad but Lord Jesus they're more real than we are they are more real they're gonna bring something into this dimension that's only been done by one man and that's you they're gonna bring an eternal body into this hellhole called Earth but Lord you told us that it wouldn't be very long though we which are alive and remain shall not prevent or hinder those which are asleep for the trumpet will sound the dead in Christ shall rise first and will be changed right here in Satan's Eden right here under its nose will be changed and will be called away and then let the wrath come on the unbelievers father we pray Lord as we made that statement we now think of family friends children loved ones that are not saved Lord you're still us in killing God you're still a soul saving God you're still a God that could take somebody don't even want you and change their whole being into a child of God prostitute doesn't matter those are just names it's just all unbelief and Lord through these seals we see that that unbelief is being cast out and has went in another direction repent means to turn and go in another direction Lord we thank you for these people here father that's been with us for a long time and truly the ones that's went on Lord we miss them like crazy but Lord what a wonderful time they're having rejoicing knowing that they're coming back here to see us face to face and then Lord we'll get to see you when we go to that marriage supper then we'll come back and spend a thousand years on this earth just fellowship in with one another and that's not even the eternal part Lord you've got a future home it's going to come down and we're gonna live in that city for an eternity nothing to hinder no sorrow no pain Lord this you just put a short season the Bible says this is just a vapor life is but Lord while we're living in this life give us all comfort heal the ones that need healing in their body save the ones that need saving father and all of us need more of you Lord all of us need more of understanding of who you are and what you're doing Lord grant that this week father just be with us now as we go be with us on the highways be with us until we come back on Wednesday night ready to hear from you father we ask you to grant these things in the name of Jesus Christ amen you're dismissed [Music] and she [Music] the hand of Jesus he touched me [Music] I am no longer the same he touched me he touched me No the joy that floods my soul something and [Music] he touched me and made now since I met this blessed Savior and since he cleansing me me [Applause] ever see ways to praise here I will share it's wall-e turn oh yes he touched me oh he touched me and [Applause] the joy that floods my soul or something then happen and now No he touched me and made me [Music]
