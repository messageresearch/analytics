family here and we just saw them a couple weeks ago I think it was a couple weeks ago just uh just around the bin um and so good to see everybody smiling faces amen um we're going to read uh tonight from Luke chapter 7 verse 36 and it'll just be a quick scripture read Lord God we're so grateful to be able to gather together around your word again Lord and we just ask Lord that you'll just bless the service tonight Lord As We Gather here Lord we certainly Lord we haven't come to see any any particular person Lord but we've come to see you Lord and as we look into your word I pray Lord that you'll open up the eyes of our heart Lord Jesus so that we can see you more plainly give us give us Faith increase our faith Lord build us up Lord God so that we can we can have have more power in this age Lord Jesus Lord we ask your bless blessing upon the word and blessing upon your people Lord tonight that you'll just bless this service and bless this Gathering Together We ask in your name amen I want to take a topic tonight just talk about supper at Simon's house and read Luke 7: 36 if they could go ahead and bring that up and it says and one of the Pharisees desired him that he would eat with him and he went into the Pharisees house and sat down to meet and you may be seated the Lord that his bless list to the reading of the word of course now I think this is a story that we're all pretty familiar with and probably familiar with how brother brandom told it but um tonight just want to kind of rehash some of these things and and talk about the difference between this um you know brother brandham really exposed the difference between Simon the one the Pharisee that invited Jesus over to his house and then that little woman that kneeled down at his feet and washed his feet with her hair and poured out uh opened up that Alabaster Box and pulled that oil out poured all over his feet now that's a striking difference between those two people there and you think about how that this Pharisee invited uh Jesus to Simon Jesus was invited to Simon's house Simon the Pharisee and um what a strange thing that would be for a Pharisee to invite Jesus over to his house and that's what brother brandham would explain when he was preaching this he said there's something wrong here a Pharisee wan to see Jesus and having to eat with him for Fellowship the Pharisees hated Jesus they had no use for him at all he was a be above to them a devil a deceiver and no Pharisee had anything to do with Jesus he said the Pharisees set themselves against him because it didn't cope with their theologies and you know you really think about the position that the Pharisees had got you know they were trying they were trying to do what was right but they had gotten so wound up and their uh their uh trying to uh adhere to their set of standards and things and and the commentary of their rabbis that they had made that they got away from the what Jesus would would frame up that the be the essentials of just do you love one another are you being good to one another do you love God and they had gotten away so caught up and and tithing mint and cumin and all those different things that they had just forgot the the real essence of what the a a a a good walk with faith in God should be and and Jesus would often refer to a Pharisee as a as a faker an actor what a horrible thing to be a faker somebody just putting on uh you know you go through all the scriptures and you can see the things that brother brandom talked about and the things that Jesus talked about that a faker is just about the worst thing that you can be that just uh you know so many times brother R would say how that we want to see real genuine something real gen that's what the world is looking for that that's what God is looking for that's what we're looking for when we come to church we want to see something that's real genuine not a not a faker now now uh uh if you look online you'd see the definition of a hypocrite a hypocrite is anyone who makes out like they have higher standards or beliefs than they really do that a Pharisee would be a real a real good hyp example of a hypocrite somebody that says that they they make they've got all these rules and things that you've got to adhere to all these weights that they can pile on your head and things that you've got to do but yet when it comes down to it they won't they won't even live up to it themselves think about the state of mind you would have to to be at to look at somebody healing somebody on the Sabbath and say well there's something wrong with that uh you have to be twisted in your mind and you know that's what the devil does is the devil will anoint somebody and and until they their eyes have been just covered over where they can't really see the real truth of the thing and I thank God that in this last day you know brother BR always told that story of how that that his mama would come and rub the Kung grease on his eyes to open him up so that he could really see I think in this last day I thank God that that we've heard a to open up our eyes so that to tear tear the veil of what the devil has put over our eyes so that we can really see things as they really are and and and not just not just see the word but to really see ourselves as we really are I I think it behooves us to constantly be examining ourselves examining our motives OB examining our objectives to see to see if our lives are matching up with what the word says because I I I I don't want anything to be fake about me and I know that you can have the same confession tonight that we don't we don't want to be fake we don't want to be actors and we don't want anything even remotely similar to what uh these stories that we read about the Pharisees and all balum Judas everybody in the Bible we don't want to have any any characteristics similar to those at all so another example of a hypocrite they might tell you to do something one way and then ignore their own advice and do the other opposite now Jesus when he was talking about hypocrites he would always say things like like he would use examples about being real clean on the outside but on the inside being real filthy and he'd say woe unto you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites for you make the clean of the outside of the cup of the platter you make clean the outside of the cup of the platter but when they are full of extortion and excess Thou blind Pharisee cleanse first that which is within the cup and platter that the outside of them may be clean also and another example he'd used was the wi cicles white beautiful on the outside but full of dead men's Bones on the inside full of dead oh now now let's just pause a second and really think about that now to to think now God there's these two extremes where you can be a real genuine Christian or you can be a real genuine unbeliever but right there in the middle is a is just a mess of feels somebody that on the outside they look like a real genuine look pretty good but on the inside they're they're they got dead men's bones are just it's just uh uh terrible on the inside and that's the danger ground that do God does not want us to be in in Revelation 3 he said I Know Thy Works speaking of the leot ofy and age that thou art neither cold nor hot you haven't gone to either one or one side or the other you you hadn't gotten real hot for God and you hadn't gotten real cold you're just right there in the middle he said I would thou were work cold or hot now what's what's what can we take away from this tonight is that the religious fence where you're on the fence and you hadn't committed yourself one way or the other that that is the worst place that you can be oh tonight if you ain't picked a side if you hadn't declared which side you're going to be on maybe tonight can be the side where you say I'm going to sell out for God I'm going to what what what are we talking about tonight we're talking about Pride I'm ready to lay it down all of my pride and lay down all of my self-will and all of my everything that I am and give it all to Jesus oh if you could come like that and do like that little woman that just humbled herself at Jesus feet and just poured out everything and broke the bottle that's that's the way that God wants us to come to him oh but if you're on the fence that's the worst place that you can be the fence is a that's that's that's the most terrible horrible place that you can be to be an actor to be a faker to come amongst the Assembly of God and say well I I I I'm I'm acting like a Christian I may be taking communion doing the things that everybody else is doing paying ties but on the inside you're dead men's bones there's something corrupt there's something cankered on the inside side and on the inside your character hadn't been changed you still want to do the things of the world you don't really love God the way that you want to you ought to the way that he he's he's telling you you you should but there's something that still Longs for the things of the world oh there's a there's a gospel there's a there's a word that can take all of that out I thank God tonight that that God give us a gospel that can change our nature and change our character so that we can be like him so that we can walk like him and talk like and so that we don't have to live like the world I I I thank God that that's what this message does to a real genuine believer is change them so that they ain't like they used to be and brother Brandon would say he'd say you can tell now think about this Pharisee why was it so strange that this Pharisee wanted Jesus to come into his house it was strange because you can tell where you can tell where you are you can tell where you are spiritually by what you attracted to you can tell where you are spiritually by who you hang around what kind of friends you associate what kind of music you listen to and what kind of literature you read and what's hanging on your wall and what's on your computer you can tell because like attracts to like and that's why it's very odd for this Pharisee to want Jesus in his home because that Pharisee was not like Jesus it's very odd that this Pharisee wanted Jesus in his home now brother R would say a seven or eighty old girl likes to PR play around with little children in her age why cuz like attracts like a a a little a little child is going to want to play around with other little children not not with Granny or something not granny might be able to show them how to how to uh quilt or something like that but most of the time a seven or eight year little girl ain't she don't want to have nothing to do because that's human nature and there ain't nothing wrong with that that's just how things how how we're made we want to be around people that are like us what's the point he's getting at a Christian is going to want to be around a Christian and un believer is going to want be around want to be want to be around an unbeliever he said if she follows Grandma all the time now it's either that Grandma is real good to her or she's grandma's little pet young people like to go with young people the young people like to hang out with young people little children playing in the streets they have things in common their dolls and their tops and their hobby horses and things little children associate with little children young girls associate with young girls the middle-aged women with the middle-aged the old with the old oh you never see crows and doves hanging out together oh to think about that that you can if we can examine ourselves and see what kind of people do I like to hang out with do I like to hang out with weed smokers and pot smokers and people that are passing around dirty pictures and stuff no because that ain't my that doesn't match it with my character and the same thing if you really examine yourself and find out what you like what you hang around with the kind of friends that you have the kind of people that you associate with the kind of people that you talk to on Instagram or Facebook the kind of friend groups that you have it will show it will put on display the kind of person you are oh if you like to sit around and you talk about talk about the word and you want to you want to hear somebody tell you about the gospel and how God changed them and testify that shows the kind of person you are why cuz it's putting your character on display your character that's the only thing that you're going to leave this world with is your character so I want to make sure that my character is right I want to let go of all the pride and all the stuff that that you can accumulate in this world the things that can get built up and let go of everything anything that'll hinder me lay aside all the weights that so easily beset you and build up something that's Everlasting something that oh God wants you to build up joy and peace and something that'll stay with you forever and ever and you can know what you've been building up because you can look at what you're attracted to a crow and a dove is two different kinds of bird Birds one has one thing and the other has the other brother brand I'm going to say a crow doesn't like what a dove likes a crow does not like what a dove likes oh a crow can try to be like a dove all it wants but it just can't it just can't eat the same stuff same stuff that a dove can it a a crow can't a crow can't love like a dove can a crow can't forgive like a dove can a crow can't believe like a dove can a crow just can't do it cuz it ain't in him it ain't in him to believe it ain't in him to serve God it ain't in him to love God with all the in because his character hasn't been changed but you take a real genuine dove that's forsaken all the world forsaken everything that it is oh it'll put on a real Dove character that's on display brother said a hypocrite and imposter he can go to the world and affiliate with the world and act like the world and live in the world and enjoy the pleasures of the world and come to church and pretend to be a Christian but the real Christian can't go out into the world and come back there's something wrong there's something something wrong you want to be what is it tonight Church you want to be around people like you you want to be around people that love God you want to be around people that'll talk about the word you want to be around Christians because you are a Christian if you are a Christian tonight and if you're not a Christian tonight there's a simple remedy for that he said come unto me all ye that labor in a heavy laden he said he all you got to do is look to him like they look to the Brass serpent in the wilderness all you got to look to hit it's a simple remedy if we just humble ourselves and lay aside our pride brother ra said show me your company I'll tell you who you are show me your diet I'll tell you your nature right it's hard for a Christian to stay in rock music now you you and I know we all know that when you go to to to Walmart or or whatever store you like to go to or you're sitting down for maybe some burritos at the at the Mexican restaurant and they start playing that rock music something just twinges it there's something something offter because a Christian don't like something like that a Christian wouldn't be able to stand a club with their music and their dress a Christian wouldn't be able to stand in a bad environment there's things that a Christian don't an unbeliever don't won't mind it an unbeliever likes that and they're drawn to it but a Christian that's not you can't draw that through a thinking man's filter it's been filtered out by the Holy Ghost and your your desires and everything has been changed show me your diet and I'll tell you your nature in second Corinthians Paul said be not unequally yolked together with unbelievers for what Fellowship hath righteousness with unbelievers with unrighteousness and what communion hath light with darkness in James chapter 4 he said ye adulterers and adulteresses know ye not that the Friendship of the world is enmity with God to even be friends with the world to like the things that are in the world in 1 Corinthians chapter 15 he said be not deceived the evil community Communications corrupt good manners it matters who your friends are it matters what you listen to how you talk it matters in Ephesians chapter 5 it says have no fellowship with the unfruitful works of darkness but rather reprove them yes it matters who you hang around with it matters who your friends are it matters what you're attracted to brother R said let me go into your house and see what you read let me listen to the to the kind of music you have playing let me see what kind of literature you read let me look in your office and see if it's a big bunch of these vulgar pictures of Pinups and things and you tell me you're a Christian I won't say nothing to you but in my heart I will watch what kind of fruit you're bearing see cuz that's your D diet your fruit your life tells you what you are amen there's just something in a dove that wants to be around other doves there's something in a crow that wants to be around other crows why is that because it's it's nature nature your character wants to be around other things that are like you but many times people try to do they try to fake their character like that Pharisee a Pharisee is an actor an actor is going to act you know what brother BR would use that example of PE people they go to the movie theater and they see somebody on the on the movie that they they want to emulate and then they start trying to act like that well that's the same way a lot of people try to do with Christianity they go to church and they they like the way a lot of people do and they like the way they dress so they want to act but without getting a character change on the inside oh you you see if you just acted out but there's something wrong on the inside dead men's Bones on the inside a pot that Adam been washed but it's clean on the outside but it's not clean on the inside then oh it just messes everything up because you're not genuine you're acting and he would use that example of you know somebody trying to trying to act like they're a good singer and they train their voice up real good until they can warble real good but he said I when he said when they're all done everybody's mind's on the note that they were singing instead of on worshiping God I I I think we could all agree tonight that I I love a song that's sung from a real Christian heart that's resonating from a real Christian experience somebody that's a real Christian believe like the little special we heard tonight somebody that's singing from an experience not from some put on something but they're singing from a place that they were at and where God brought them from and they're singing from something that's resonating for a whale bubbling up from the inside not from something that they're trying to act out like a a black bird trying to put peacock feathers in you know brother B said birds of a feather flock together and you know some of the most beautiful outside Birds there is are scavengers it's the inside that counts I to think about that that some of the most beautiful birds that you can look at in the wild are are scavengers are are birds that can just eat anything they're pretty on the outside but what are they on the inside and he would say house Angels row Devils put putting on I have to think about what a statement house Angels Road Devils putting on he said oh my deliver me from being an actor be what you are God will bless you amen oh see why it's so important for preachers to just be genuine be there who they are not try to emulate anybody for singers to just sing sing what the way that God wanted them to sing and not try to emulate anybody else everybody just do the way everybody's been they were born with a with a with a gift way that God wanted them to be made up and if we'll just be genuine that everything can work in a way that will prosper the church you'll never be able to fake a Christian Life you you you got to you got to have a nature change to live this life to think about that you look at some people sometimes and and you can just tell that they're just trying to fake up something but you'll never be able to fake it you can't fake it you got to have a nature change you can learn how to be a dove and stick Dove feathers in but but only a real Dove can be a dove only a real Dove can be a dove and Jesus said in Matthew chap 7 many will say to me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and in thy name have cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work iniquity fakers fakers that thought that they were genuine because some spiritual things happen in their life maybe they saw a dream or maybe they maybe they even had a vision or maybe they could kind of understand some things or keep up right but yet down on the inside they didn't have a change amen and that's what we're preaching on tonight is pride pride is what keeps you from having a change pride is what will prevent you from progressing with the Lord Pride like that Pharisee there Pharisee where you're unwilling to just let go and let God have his way you think about brother R would say that Simon s that Pharisees sent a little flunky to go find Jesus and Jesus was all tired and sweaty and going all over Palestine and this funky went elbowing through the crowd and staggering along and he finally got to an you know brother Brandon was telling this story and he all through the story he would say I see I see and I now I wonder if he really could see this flunky bumping up into Andrew in the crowd and he said I see Andrew taking him up close to where Jesus was was with a sick and all was around he said Master here is a young man from Southern Palestine who has come with a message he's come a long way and he says it's from his master and he wishes to speak to you and to think now we'd have said what would we have said we' said Master don't go to that hypocrit to stay away from him but Jesus will accept any invitation he he said Jesus will always go where he's invited oh to think about that tonight that you've got a promise that you'll if you'll just invite him into your heart and just open up the door of your heart he'll he'll always go where he's invited the Bible says in James chapter 4 draw nigh to God and He will draw nigh to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners and purify your hearts ye double-minded and what is a double-minded man a man that can't not make up his mind between being cold or hot can't make up his mind what side of the fence he's going to sit on he's right there in the middle of the fence but he can't make up his mind which way he's going to go oh but if you're double-minded cleanse your hands and draw not God and brother R would say that Courier ran away after he had delivered his message and he missed his opportunity tonight I I if we could just kind of think about that why why did the Rich Young Ruler leave feeling sad why did the rich the Rich Young Ruler had his opportunity all Jesus disciples when Jesus began to preach Doctrine they turned their back on him but they had their opportunity so many people had their opportunity in the Bible but Jesus never breaks a promise he always keeps his promise regardless of what it is so he was going to he was when he promised he was going to Simon's house he was going to be there amen because Romans chap 2:1 says there is no respect of persons with God right I I thank God that there's no respect of persons with God he doesn't care if you're rich or poor he doesn't care if if you've been in church for 40 years or two minutes if you come to God with faith believing amen he will come where he's invited amen they got everything ready for the feast all of them in there entertained and so forth and Pharisee was having such a great time entertaining a celebrity brother Bram said the first thing you know Jesus arrived went into the house and sat down and they didn't know he was there this Pharisee was a rich man he could really put a big dinner on that like like let the poor stand and gape on if they wanted to that's the group that would tear up the world to make one proelite out of a gentile and make him a twofold more child of Hell than he was when he began what was it and brother R would say Pride pomp there he is Jesus sitting there forsaken Pride pomp oh paint this picture in your mind Jesus sitting there in the corner and a Pharisee should have been part of the most religious group of the day should have known to just humble himself at God revealed in flesh but brother Adam said it was Pride Pomp and he said pride is such a cursed thing so awful so evil is pride now let's take a step back and think about what pride is brother R say way back in the beginning when God made man is in In His Image Genesis 12627 he said God made angels and and those some of the Angels fell and they became Fallen spirits who could come and anoint you you to influence your life and some of those Spirits he would he would he would go through the seven that were cast off of Mary Magdalene Pride boast uh lust variance all the different things that he listed out all of those all of those things there were spirits to influence you and he would say that's what pride is to think that a a person could be influenced by an evil spirit to make them act a certain way to influence them to act a certain way pride pride CER cursed thing so awful so evil is it he said what a horrible curse pride is pride is when you say oh you're too good I'm too good to think now Saul fell because of Pride Judas fell because of Pride he thought he knew a better way to do it than than Jesus when he looked and he saw this little woman falling down at jesus' feet the Bible says from that moment he started going in a different direction Judas fell by transgression by the love of money and the pride of life is what brother Brandon said and he said oh what a horrible little black Devils is all pinned up in that heart of Pride thinking you're better than somebody else oh to think about how horrible about that is to think that you're better than somebody else now we just come through uh the sixth month of the year which the world has designated pride month to think about what a horrible thing the six month that month of man that that that they designate carve that out of side to celebrate pride and here brother random is explaining what a evil thing pride is to elevate yourself up to where you look down on somebody else and think that you're even greater than the word of God what is pride pride is the reason that is so hard to face our mistakes when we've got a problem and the the preaching of the word Goes Forth and gets begins to hit that the pride will rise up within us and say if it's there Pride will say oh will you you start making excuses and start making reasons why it doesn't apply to you PL pride is the reason that is hard to own up to our own failings pride is why it's so hard to say I'm sorry a proud father won't be able to tell his family won't be able to tell his wife or his children that he's sorry that thing that rises up when they when they mention when they mention people in in thanks or whatever pride is why somebody can't say I love you I I forgive you oh right amen come on now y'all don't draw up on me I'm preaching about life good y'all don't scare me tonight pride pride will raise up when somebody suggests a different way why don't we go this way and a pride will rise up pride pride what is pride pride is the reason we get offended well so many times we want to make excuses for being offended but the reason we get offended is because of Pride we think that we're above being preached on or above somebody trying to correct us or above even maybe somebody making fun of us the reason that we get offended when somebody makes fun of us is because of Pride it's Pride but the Bible says in Matthew chap 11 blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended in me that was a forgotten beatitude you're blessed if you will not be offended at the gospel you're blessed if you can go into Walmart and not be offended when people laugh at you like they did when we were coming back from from Kentucky and people openly there was a group of people in the store you'd hardly believe this sitting here that openly laughed in the store and my little family because they wore dresses but we're not offended at that I thank God that I got a little family that's got enough backbone that they can walk proudly through the store and not be offended because they're dressing like a Christian and living a holy life in Proverbs Chapter 13 it says only by Pride cometh contention if you you want to have a good fight get proud and not listen to somebody else that's trying to help you out only by Pride cometh convention but with the wh advised is wisdom in Proverbs chapter 16 it said pride pride goeth Before Destruction and in haly spirit before a fall and pride pride is why people offend pride is why we're nasty than one another pride is why because we think we know A Better Way pride is why balum tried to sway the children of Israel because he thought he knew a better way than God himself pride is why people offend and in Matthew chapter 18 it says whosoever shall offend one of these little ones which believe in me it were better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck and that he were drowned in the depth of the sea it would have been better for balam to never even try to offend the children of Israel than to lay a stumbling block in front of them that would cause those little sheep to stumble oh you think it it's easy to offend a little sheep a little sheep is a sheep it's got the character of her sheep it's not going to strike back but brother Brown said in in Revelation chapter 10 I actually pulled this from the notes for that sermon that I didn't get to he said what that this scripture means is is not do them any harm just even to bring offense to them just upset them about something it'd be better that you had your own self drowned or had never been born on the Earth than even to bring an offense to one in other words you really think that a one of these little children of God the least of them in the Kingdom of Heaven is the Tabernacle of God that God is dwelling them in in that little in that little person so you're better you're better off dead than to put a stumbling block in front of that person be better off dead than to take a little a little a little child of God and say well it's it's okay to to drink some wine and then see that person get pulled over with a DUI or get thrown in prison overnight their their life ruin it's better better for you to die it it' be better off dead than to put a little stumbling block in front of a Believer like that you're better off dying a horrible death and to cause a little believer to stumble Amen to trip and fall to cause somebody to Sher their spiritual duty to seduce somebody to immorality to speak evil to give a little a little a little sheep to give them some drugs get them caught up in something yeah come on brother you're better off dead yeah well brother R I'm said when you find a believer that really believes with signs following and you see the humility of their life not an impersonator know that they are a Christian a real genuine article just keep still thing you ought to do is join right up with them start moving along cause you're moving right up the King's Highway oh that's what the world wants is to see a real genuine believer somebody that can humble themselves and not be lifted up with pride amen in Hebrews chapter 10 it says let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works to think this this afternoon that your life can be an influence and your words can be an example to provoke one another your actions can set a path humble people will restrain themselves from offending others humble people are eager to forgive humble people recognize their weakness humble people reject honor as unworthy servants oh if we could just humble ourselves so far down that you can receive a true rebuke from the least little Christian brother pride is inflated sense of selfworth what is pride I got a right I'm better I'm sufficient I'm sufficient in my own my own doings like balam and Judas Pride what is pride how you feel about that thing that you don't want Jesus to touch now that's why we're getting real quiet this afternoon because we've all got things that we just we feel like are off limits maybe I'm hitting on something that tonight you feel like is off limits but it ain't off limits to God cuz God wants us to mold us into his image that Romans 8:29 says you were predestinated to be conformed to the image of God of the Son of God and so if you want to be conformed to the image of God there's always things that got to be shaved off and one of them things has got to be shaved off is our pride oh to exam if we could really examine ourselves and examine our motives and as we're doing things and going through life and and and and things things hit us and prick us the wrong way if we can realize what that is that that's something that we need to get rid of oh that we can keep moving up toward that Capstone Pride will make you self-centered Pride will make you you your when your needs and your desires and your achievements have to have priority you you want the focus to be on you Pride will make you boastful where you got to have constant validation and recognition oh when you got to have got to get all them likes on Facebook or or ministers have to have a bunch of people Pat them on on the back after they preach the sermon what do we need validation for our confidence should come from the word of God we we should need constant validation constant recognition Pride will make you not care about others where you can't see somebody else's Viewpoint and won't be willing to sit down across the table from them and talk to them Pride will make you resent others that threaten your position or threaten where you are Pride will bristle Up when somebody says something you don't like Pride says I'm more than fine the way that I am the way that I am is good enough Judas and balum and Cain the way that I am is good enough it's going to be my way or the highway Pride will make you treat somebody differently based on how they treat you in Proverbs chapter 28 it says to have respect of persons is not good for for a PE piece of bread that man will transgress y to have respect of persons you know what that means that means if somebody Pats you on the back you treat him real good somebody doesn't tell you they like you then you treat them bad but oh that's that's something we got to get rid of everybody's got to be treated the same isn't that what Billy Paul said the greatest Miracle he ever saw was his dad you could not tell who his enemy was and who he love or you know you couldn't tell that's the kind of life that I want to live is where you can't tell not to be a respector of persons Pride will have you going out of your way for to to get some some popularity right in James chapter 2 it says if you fulfill the law according to the scripture Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself you do well but if ye have respect to persons you commit sin and are convinced of the law and transgressors if you have respect to persons amen because of pride pride will make you seek out popularity Pride will make you seek out the claps on the back Pride will keep you from raising your hand in church Pride will keep you from saying amen and Pride will keep you from really worshiping the way that God wants you to worship oh you ever watch an evangelist come through and he'll get the he'll get somebody to really break through what are they breaking through that Pride they're breaking through where they just don't care about what anybody else thinks and that's when something begins to happen didn't something happen when that little woman got down at jesus' feet and brother R said she got out of order she got out of order when she broke that oil all over jesus' feet and something happened what happened maybe she didn't some uh a great big light or something didn't appear but I tell you what she did get she got her sins forgiven oh you get out of order and get get rid of all that Pride a little bit something's going to happen you'll get your sins forgiven and you'll find out your character and your Nature's been changed and you're not acting like a crow anymore you're acting like a dove cuz God will do something for you when you lay down your pride lay down all that stuff that that's keeping you from from being a real Christian brother going say Pride feels just like a little just a little complex you have oh you don't want Jesus to touch that because it would degrade your social standing in the community I'd rather degrade my social standing in the community than to rub my name off of the Lamb's Book of Life but they won't let him in that little pride holds him out oh you see how bad that pride is a devil it's an evil spirit and that's the thing that's keeping him keeping a lot of us from having a real blessing is pride it's the thing that keeps the spirit from breaking loose in the church is pride it's the keeps the thing that keeps us from really fellowshipping with one another is pride respective persons to one another I'll fellowship with this person because I like him but not with this one because he's he he's got something that I don't really like brother ra said you want to look like the Joneses you want to act like your neighbor but God wants you to act like his child and get away from that pride and I don't care how much you draw up on me tonight I'm going to preach it I don't care how much you sleep tonight I'm going to preach it cuz we got to get away from that Pride if we'll wake up we'll see what God wants for us to receive in this hour he said Pride pump there is Jesus setting forsaken why was he sitting there forsaken because of Pride they said there set Jesus with dirty feet oh it does something to me when I say it Jesus unnoticed unnoticed Jesus with dirty feet made a gazing stock after being invited he said they stro the streets and young ladies go forth with flowers and they bouquet the sidewalks and hang down the flags with every sign of welcome but when Jesus comes to town he has to stay in a little Mission somewhere because crazy Holy Roller Oh my Jesus them feet that was soon to be pierced for the sins of the world set with dust and dung uncomfortable oh to ask us ourselves tonight would you be willing to make him comfortable would you be willing to do something for Jesus now I'll tell you you know you go around to different churches and things and I think one of the one of the most uncomfortable things is to go to a church and nobody will come up and greet you and nobody will say something to you I uh I I'll just say recently this is probably a terrible testimony for a preacher to say but I actually avoided a church going to a church because I had been there in the past and it just was such an uncomfortable experience it was it was it's terrible when you go somewhere and now to think about Jesus sitting over there in that corner when the party was going on and everybody's laughing and joking and everything and nobody would go talk to him come nobody would go humble themselves to think now would you be willing to wash Jesus feet or would you be afraid somebody will see now see what a what a strange thing it is that even in this day and hour that we're living in people are afraid afraid ashamed to wash one another's feet in communion but but Jesus said Peter saith unto him when they were washing feet Thou shalt never wash my feet and Jesus answered him if I wash thee not thou Hast no part with me why did Jesus wash feet because he was showing our example of humility show to the god of the universe the god that had created 10,000 worlds and solar systems and universes was willing to get down at the feet of another disciple and wash his his dirty feet that were C with the mud and the filth of the of the of the of the road pride pride always wants the highest Place Pride always wants the best for themselves Pride always wants to lift up but humility humility will take what it can get now there's the real definition of what humility is humility is going to take if all you can get is crumbs that's that's what I'm going to get if you can be like that Greek woman and say I I'm going take some like the Sy phenician woman I I'll take the crumbs if that's all I can get if you can be like like Lazarus Lazarus the Bible says that he was he slept in the gate and the dogs come and licked his wounds and he was sitting there eating crumbs with the dogs if that's all you can get in humility that's what you're going to get humility humility is going to take what you can get from one another that's why the Bible says why not rather suffer yourselves to be defrauded sometimes things don't go your way sometimes things are different but in humility you're just going to take what you can get brother would say the flunky meets you at the door and the Palestinian in the Eastern country and say goes goes to one of the wells and draws him a good Great Basin of good clear water and he removes your sandal or your Sho shoes sets your feet up across his knee and washes all this dir dirt and dust and dung and stuff off your body and then he takes another towel and wipes your feet and he washes them sets them down and then he takes your sandals and sets them up on a little mantel like sets them along like this at the door of entrance then he goes over and he finds a pair of fine satin silk slippers they're soft that's the compliments of the host he does that he has them sitting there he put them upon your feet until he finds one that fits you comfortably then he passes you into another place and then there's a man meets you there at the door and he's got a little Basin in his hand a little picture like and you take it and pour some of the oil in your hands and now that oil is made of very fine nner and now nner is made from this plant that they take it and they grinded up into powder and oh you think about the type there that they grinded up into powder just like Christ was ground up for us and as he died from the cross and he said there's a bush that grows in Arabia this this spner this oil was so expensive brother Bram would said how did Brother Brown know how much that she she spent for he said she spent 180 dinari on that oil now normally in those times 300 dinar a year was the average wage so that's a lot of money money that's why Judas got so bent out of shape in Pride looking at I think it tells us in the Bible that he said why couldn't that oil be sold and given to the poor the money be given to the poor he's speaking out of Pride not understanding what was really happening here so many times we fail to understand what's happening because we look at this at the situation out of Pride now Jesus brother R was explaining this situation the story he said the rich didn't want him the clean didn't want him the religious lawkeepers didn't want him but while he was sitting there on the outside in the street there was a real bad woman in the town a prostitute then James chapter 4: 6 it says God resisteth the proud but giveth Grace unto the Umble amen right God doesn't want somebody proud all proud lifted up they're not going to be able to find their way to him the in James chapter 4 it says humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He Shall lift you up that's how you want that's how you go higher is get as low as you can now I I know sometimes it seems like we're just kind of harping on these things get as low as you can but that's because it works you get as low as you can and not try to lift yourself up and God will be the one to lift you up Proverbs 11 says when Pride cometh in cometh shame but with the lowly is wisdom the lowly somebody that'll just be like a little sheep and allow themselves to be led that's why Jesus said my sheep hear my voice sheep not some wild animal not a Theon Beast that can't be tamed can't be trained but just a little sheep in Proverbs 21 and high look and a proud heart and the plowing of the wicked is sin now that's the kind of woman that that came that that saw Jesus Through The Window through the door or the lattice or saw him sitting there with somebody that uh despite her background she she was willing to Humble herself and get out of order and as brother man would explain do whatever it took to get to Jesus oh if we can just do if we can have that kind of perseverance that's why he preached that message perseverance if you if you're willing to do whatever it takes and not stop seeking not stop reading not stop coming to church not stop until you get an answer from God you'll find something will happen now now to think now this little woman was a prostitute she had a horrible background a terrible background and maybe around the room tonight we could say we've we've got similar backgrounds but brother brand would say you say brother brand I'm no prostitute he said don't altogether mean sexually prostitutions on a higher level you can Pro no think about this now you can prostitute your time you can prostitute your own selfish motives going around saying well I belong to this church I'm better the holy spirit will speak to your heart and you'll say I want nothing to do with that now if you can prostitute your time you can prostitute yourself to material possession and wealth consuming all of your focus you can prostitute yourself to celebrity culture you can prostitute yourself to the entertainment of the world you can prostitute yourself to power and success what good does it do if you got money in the bank and don't have God Amen but you know if you're that kind of a prostitute where you sold out you're who the gospel was for the gospel was for the broken and the miserable and the destitute I'm so glad that we can testify of how God delivered us amen I'm so glad that we can testify of what God can do to somebody with a miserable messed up life and I I want to say to you tonight that no matter what your past is Jesus can change your future yes just like he changed the woman at the whale's future just like he changed this little woman's future when she rose up that to think that all of her sins all the things that she had done when she rose up from there her sins were forgiven to let me skip ahead I really don't want to keep everybody late tonight I know it's I know it's Wednesday night Psalm chapter 34 says the Lord is nigh unto them that are of a broken heart and saveth such as be of a contrite spirit Psalm 51 says oh Lord open up open thou my lips and my mouth shall show forth thy praise for thou desirest not sacrifice else would I give it thou Delight us not in burnt offering the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit a broken and a tried heart oh God thou Willl not despise now to think that that little woman coming through looking looking for Jes noticing that he would been forsaken nobody wasn't tending to him that that is what God wants is a broken tore apart somebody that's been through some stuff I think if we look back in our lives we can all remember when we were down in the valley down going get in the midst of the brick K sitting on the ash Heap whatever you would say and that's where God God allows us sometimes to get to those places cuz he wants us he wants us to get to a place where our heart's broken so that he can use us and he said the first thing you know she finds herself rubbing his feet rubbing his feet and the tears just pouring down he said sparkling water coming from her heart right there sit that alabaster box and the first thing you know in her hysterical condition her hair fell down the curls dropped down and before she knew it she had her hair a wiping his feet with a hair that was on her head he said what a mess what a mess I thank God for messy preaching amen thank God for messy praise I'm so glad tonight for a messy religion amen thank God for a mess when you were born of the water and the blood you you come through a mess thank God for messy births it's a mess thank God for messy prayer why is it a mess tonight as we'll be closing here in just a moment why is it a mess cuz oh your Pride's gone your pride you laid that Pride down and you're willing to do like that little woman whatever it takes to get through and pushing through everybody going and standing at the the judgy Pharisee selling her that oil over the counter judging her as she leaves people said as she left that little store people were pointing at her and and wondering what she did in that store judgey judgey judgey but it's a mess it's a mess to get to Jesus it's a mess when something happens it's a mess where you can where you can let go of your pride and let go of your order and let go of your starch and just love God just love God then it's a mess he said she wasn't caring what them Pharisees was saying he said did Jesus draw back his feet and say you mustn't do that no sir he perfectly held still yes you did and all these things happened and then finally Jesus spoke and we'll end on this as the musicians come forward it says in verse 39 when the Pharisee which had bidden him saw it he spake within himself this man if he were a prophet would have known who and what man or man woman this is that touched him for she is a sinner Jesus answered and said unto him Simon I got something to say unto you and he said Master say on there was a certain creditor which had two debtors the one owed 500 Pence and the other 50 and when they had nothing to pay he frankly forgave them both tell me therefore which of them will love him most s answered and said I suppose that he to whom he forgave most and he said unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he turned to the woman and said unto Simon seest thou this woman I entered into thine house thou gavest me no water for my feet but she hath washed my feet with tears and wiped them with the hairs of her head thou gavest me no kiss but this woman since the time I came in hath not ceased to kiss my feet my head with old thou do not anoint but this woman hath anointed my feet with ointment where for I say unto thee her sins which are many are forgiven for she love much but to whom little Is Forgiven the same loveth little and he said unto her thy sins are forgiven now you think about that that because she was willing to lay her Pride down her sins were forgiven I think as we stand to our feet I think it's such a striking thing to note at the end of that sermon when brother Ram preached the message Pride he pulled and he pulled and he preached his heart out and he had a little altar call and he asked anybody that was willing to lay their pride down to stand to their feet and he preached and he preached and he preached and at the end of that sermon he said I look everywhere and I don't see one standing not one person at the end of that sermon was willing to lay down their pride Lord Jesus we thank you tonight Lord Jesus for your grace and for your word Lord that's been delivered and I pray Lord maybe tonight Lord there's somebody that tonight on the way home maybe as they're staring up at the ceiling Lord God that maybe they'll realize that they need to lay some things down lord if we can just come to the place Lord we're willing to just get so humble like that little woman Lord that Jesus said they'll be talking about her for the next 2,000 years and here we are still preaching about her little story a little woman that was willing to lay down their pride despite all of the background despite all the all of her past Lord Jesus Lord we're just so grateful Lord for this kind of a testimony of what laying down your pride can accomplish Lord God maybe there's somebody here tonight Lord that you're pulling to Lord Jesus Lord as we cast in the net Lord God I pray Lord that you'll reach out and prick Lord whatever heart you need to prick Lord Jesus Lord you promise Lord that your word will not return void you promise that it would accomplish his purpose and Lord we're trusting tonight that it'll accomplish his purpose whether it's here in this little building or maybe out somewhere on the airway somebody streaming in tonight and I I want to encourage Lord tonight Lord as we close in prayer Lord Jesus that if there's somebody that's Lord their heart is pricked maybe watching in the night if they leave kneel down beside their bed in humility Lord I I thank God that we've got a God that will answer back I thank God tonight Lord that you will answer back lord Jesus when when we reach out to you Lord Jesus you just don't just stand there with your arms folded looking Lord but Lord you promised that you're a God that is still touched by the feelings of our infirmities thank you Lord Jesus amen let's sing something to it and then we'll turn this service over my Lord the more that I release my cares the more you take control the more that I can humble myself the more you lift me up every day I live Lord I love you [Music] more if you want to step up here you can speak into the mind yeah uh um I know y'all

please let us know real quick so we can maybe consolidate the rooms and the rooms won't be so expensive they're giving us a good rate but still we're going to have to get about 15 or 16 rooms so that's a pretty good pretty good chunk so we appreciate brother Dale always for letting us be able to do this and taking a little bit of the burden off of us financially amen not all of it but financially he tried to take a little bit of the burden off by getting your your room so just uh keep us in prayer and we love you with the love of the Lord we thank you for coming and uh good crowd

daughter and then head on back home probably 7 or 8:00 we'll be back home so Lord bless you anybody have any questions about what we're you know where we're going you should have everything right here and you should be able to put all that in your in your GPS and and make it so any anything no okay all rightel no it's got to be it can't be until 3: all right it's got to be 3 now we're going to get

send everybody a text or WhatsApp and tell you that you can come on and check in but normally it's 3:00 and then check out is normally at 11: but if you check out 11: on Sunday you've missed service amen you've missed service so don't wait till 11:00 to check out on Sunday all right so uh it's about 10 or 15 minutes from where we're going to be so so just uh just keep that in mind too when you're leaving but yeah I I'll let everybody know if if you can come in early that's about 15 rooms I doubt they're going to be all ready uh there is a softball tournament during that weekend that's why the rooms are a little more expensive and there's not many of them in certain places we've tried to get in the block but this lady has really tried to help us and um rooms are at a premium so it won't be deserted we'll be like brother Bob said we'll be we'll be hanging around a bunch of demons but that's okay that's all right they're out there we're in here okay amen but you know what Shine Your Light open the door for them tell them God bless you right you know walk around with skirts and and long hair amen show your light Let It Shine You Can Let It Shine without coming right here you're actually
