========================================

let it be and they dig the rock of your sideways great rock first and Elliman good to see everybody in the house of the Lord just remember by way of announcements fellowship meeting this Saturday at brother crow shames if you're gonna go with us make sure you let us know that you want to go and fellowship together remember that and just have that in your mind and all the other announcements that we have there downstairs on the board and stuff like that so remember that let's just sing open the eye of my heart and brother faughn he comes to minister the word of the Lord unto us because that's what we gathered far tonight right to hear and faith comes what by hearing and hearing by the word open the eyes of my open the eyes of my heart open me eyes of my a man and in it praise God we thank the Lord tonight I want to see you open the eyes of my heart I just want to say I appreciate being here appreciate brother Sam and the body of Jesus Christ here this evening it's good to see everyone appreciate my wife travel with me today any other things that we just think I'm gonna go right to the word Lord and you know my style hella girl and we just goin please God so if you got your Bibles this evening we will read two places in the street scriptures st. Matthew the fourth chapter in the fourth verse I read and I'm sorry from Saint Luke the fourth chapter and we see it right here it says everybody we read this when Jesus was the greatest temptation and Satan gave him three major temptation in the body spirit and soul and I saw you begin to look at he says in Matthew 4 you tempting at me saying and jesus answered and said it is written man should not live by bread alone but by but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God and st. Luke the fourth chapter and I have a beginning at st. Luke the fourth chapter in verse 17 and it raised like this in the need we know the started Jesus right here is identifying himself in description and he says and they were delivered unto him the book of the prophet Isaiah and when he had opened the book he found the place where it was written remember he was the only one and there was no man worthy to open the book it was in all the profits and everything then he said the Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted to proclaim Liberty to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind to set at liberty to them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the Lord and didn't he done what he closeable and in the word he'd had the ability to open in the closing it and he gave it again in to the ministers and he sat down and eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened on him and he began to say didn't I said to him this day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears let us pray father help me one more time - you're my body my mind my soul my spirit to you O God my lord help me to surrender myself over to the will of God now father God I give you all my strength this evening and the name of Jesus Christ we pray amen god bless you you may be seen at one moment thank the Lord for the reading of the word of God this evening I like what I like with the Bible says here that you know what Jeter realized he told him is that just day is the scripture fulfilled in your very ears in and fulfilled in your ears and and I begin to look at this word of God this evening as I begin to take a thought from here this day is the scripture fulfilled in a forward body by forward body and the reason I talk about it because we want to realize here the only way that God can fulfill himself they gotta help a body to do it in under so we begin and again I killed right here so Jesus himself and he was busy with if he was going to die and he was tempted and then he was kept in a and going through the grain is one of the greatest temptation it was and it does no scroller temptation that we can have physically then be hungry how do yet fasted forty days and forty nights wanted to scroll in this aisle that's in your body is hunger now you know I don't know you might not feel like it is but brother and cities were he thing if you get hungry enough you eat out of a garbage in how many so Jesus himself when attempted would one of the greatest prey or desire that a man hath when a man is hungry what he won't do for his own stomach honey but he proved he had to say he had to pull his body subject to the word and tell the devil I was not being to eatin bread I'm gonna live by the word of the God of my the word of father so I begin to look at I begin to look is oh we realized what he did he had overcome that desire of a flushing and the day we got the same desire some people say well I don't work how do you know I talk to people all day they'll tell you something they won't eat think you say I talk to people sometime I say we had you ever try to eat possum I never eat that nasty stuff I said wait you don't say never I just got one day pause I pop it might look like a buffet never say never you know you get hungry enough and that possum dad somebody gotta go and at work show you know so we don't want to we don't want to put ourself in the position either what we just hadn't breached yet we had never reached that level hunger that we were what we willing to either hamburger out of a garbage can honey but the point of the deal the point of it is that desire gina was sure here honey I got a scroll a desire for God can I do my body my human desire remember he was tempted in every measure in every way that we are tempted in and that devil came to him and kept at him when he had fasted forty days and forty nights with the greatest tip that you can do it he was hungry and he was tired honey tree what a tip you will you turn against God will you to pray will you let word go discern then save your stomach save your life to it when a man is hungry and thirsty he might do anything to live but Jesus said man should not live by bread alone but by every word never seen another my god why could he said it because he came in his word body he didn't in the word so we want to look here they don't work shall we begin to look at this later Jesus came in his word body hawlucha we begin to look at these things right here and there were sorry Elijah so now we begin to look at Jesus being a full word of God he was in know we we pass out the off me but Gina did not die fast as the oven he came in his word body when he came he was in the beginning he was the word and the word was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh haloo he came and his word body-hugging so when he came he was a man a man but the point of it what he would kept it and he was different the one thing that he was different with me you he was not born the way we were born but he was Mary ate food things that the earth was a cursed product of God so everything to come from Earth were cursed at it so what it is she would do when she built when that body began to grow up and things that she in other words and I would and everything the body can feel see the body revealed the body can feel what it is to be weak the body can feel what it was to be tired but all we look at past the human reality of Gina down on the solar cheetah was God coming down on the third grandma Gina what the seed of God because he was God I mean he could not he could not if he would have felt right here we all would have failed but he overcame his bush and anyway trying to tell us something we could do all day if we put the word first I want you to notice here let me let me back up for a few minutes here so we realized here so we rely why would what would the del why didn't their with chip what was this girl was saying it was but when as focused as I were what the tip I'll have a desire a scroll compassion a desire for something I knew didn't work we real I wonder what was the first day to happen with me when the chart fell evil how do one she fell from she fell from her desire for the word she lost the design for the word Nancy Tucker desired in her body anyone lush the briman said she she woke up run the word and she took over larval hello so desire for Lux but knowledge however he did not get pregnant in a wool first she got pregnant in a my first desire with chain and she started to design thank you more than she did in the word other people we gotta take the word how are we gonna decide the word more do we do sensation or any other pleasure we gonna go heaven and earth will pass away but jesus said my workshop available I begin to look at something getting a look at these things right here and we want to realize you that's what it's all the revelation it is the world listeners were the revelation that we could we try we we want today the stronger say that we got to have in our life of a desire to serve God we never say we got honey the pain today to be Brazil what the same fighting the people with today change it the desire to be changing their desire sorry no longer desire to be like crying they they they crave for and design how they trying to quit a holy thirst of God with things of the world so we were gonna realize here that's what that was such a bother in his hand if it's a good a domani a drug trial in his age because we realize Satan is trying to stop this ride for recognizing that she is the word for this hour how do you never wake up again and I took a quotation here they'll probably begin to speak on her in other words we find unchaining desire how do we realize here in Christ the mystery of God revealed they bent until he began to speak he's a he's an in there would be a time come for window when he would express himself in his fullness of his Godhead honey that's what the devil ate that's what the devil once the bride recognized had the former's of the crisis put this up in you now the city says anything the fullness of his guy at guilty through his church having the preeminence in his church oh my he said what the anointed man do you know the man now the anointed peoples oh my to bring back the anointed bride and the bridegroom knowing about what makes everyone it's exactly what Eve turned down honey and Adam and I don't come back with live and he know that the second I'll come back here knowing that no any word not knowing of the word because he said my words they are spirit and day my words are spirit see anointed with what the word some of the point of here is not what he's these stories going back he restored by the for revelation of the Godhead why this same attack the Godhead because if you ain't got your hand right how can you fall he's gonna light come through the heads I'm baby could be born deformed it might be not happen along a baby could be born without leave but he could not be born without a head you see what saying it got to have a head for the body deliver so say in the mood to me lady he change his job you is to change the desire for the word Godhead and if you notice what did he tell see the desert was sold in prison come in a so then prison come here not when you don't know God so the present come here will you know God every Jack God he said brother you got a deal I don't know buddy let go to Romans Romans war and look at shows in prison for a quick second Rama sworn Romans 1 and I'm gonna begin reading reading it let me begin let me begin at the 19 verse maybe now into the 21st maybe I might really look glance there but 1990 20 verse it says Romans 1:19 19 verse is that because that which may be known of God is manifest in them for God showed unto them for the invisible things which you do we change he's dealing with people that just come always saying it out and then what people don't work needs away when people God is world when you people got testified I know God how do I another one that comes in a revelation all the knowledge of Godhead they come to the revelation that knowledge of the garden not not not revelation knowledge he gonna leave you got to Revelation you will not change your views on God this she says here for the invisible things of God I like the visual things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen not something in here not something that not reveal hadn't before gauger bringing in diapers he had to show you the truth clearly singing been under being understood by the things that are made even his eternal power and his Godhead fourth day for that they all went out in his huge so now he putting the right here he said if they and he would say he did Hurley was now they are without an excuse hello God did another one he says if you notice the critic vertical burns he said because that wind a new god holy with because when they knew God how do they had a understanding people don't leave in the message now how do they how to understand this minute and sold in prison now how can you help you know what what is that without an excuse means hold it 21st verse it means to forgive someone for making a mistake or doing something that's wrong and there was somebody that made a mistake this is another mistake this is when they come to the true in other words dinner they don't want to come to the truth and they refuse the word they have a desire they can be changed from God how do people we gotta make sure how do you get a new birth and I express with God will never change me go God does not change he said because that when they knew God they glorified him not as God neither were they thankful but became vain imaginations and their foolish heart was darkened professing themself to me professing them decide to be wise they became fools and change that's what a problem with that were the problem none that been in the run dismissing today whether they would say do it he's marking the people that the people are changing harder they don't heard all the truth the Godhead the oneness of God the grain of God and now all of a sudden hey legally ready to change it how do they trying to make God something that babies are scared of what the world design anyway he's at the twin turret and they chained of glory the glory of the uncorruptible God into an image made like to corruptible man and beasts and creeping things and what wherefore God giving him home cleaning it that day st. Luke's 1730 could not people feel okay they heard the word how did that work of breaking the indictment once they heard of God and Satan who the true night didn't fit you see he preached the truth the promise that he bring in this year you either accept it or turn it up why would he come back to Godhead they rejected the God is not what we got perversion how do people turn from the word and that's the spirit follows it he turned from the world she practices that wasn't human but with a base hallelujah because we are God dealing with just brought about in the revelation of a desire a woman came to program with this she said brother I need what I would only go professor what is your desire he says the oh she's away you got happy because God's gonna deal with in his eye on you guys for him how do you know what you said brothers you never let me defend letting satanical but why do you think in a revelation of this mystery that we live in that we live here it always goes back to her when he got ready to open the book what they say he said eatable why this ain't about because you have a designer this is heavenly food but you notice in the same the private old eat the book about spiritual desire take Luke 17 it was the coming be the same temptation to find Jesus with people more than lovers of God Amen hear that what he says here so we realized really why because this is all that God is wanting to vindicate himself in a full word body and we preach the third pole and that word but let me finish this out on desire for a few minutes I'll either the word shall we begin to go around and I want you to notice it what God called Peter honey you know he said Peter who to me and said it I am Peter said out of Christ the Son of the Living God how did Jesus a flesh and blood never revealed this to you now you had to come a showdown that Peter would have a desire for God over everything that you said Peter did not go he denied God because God told him he would hey Peter it was constant all means we've had people to save you don't be too happy tonight because God's and it would be another word so we fire but she was testing Peter revelation I did told it low to decipher I did they rejected him and he walked away as st. john 6:66 and they turned away from the light having the desire they're going to be religious without the Holy Ghost and what did he say to Peter will you also go people say the same thing Jesus a Jesus yeah here we had to pray somebody it was either whom shall I go tell me would you let go saying the same thing Jesus say how the man should not live by bread alone whom shall I go that has the word he recognized his desire was not flesh and blood hit this island for the word people that what God tried to give by doing a design with tariffs on the word I love these I returned from the world but this bride right here our desire will be turned back to the word begin the little hero now you said bro jewel head look at this little girl you know writer or one of the things that I desire should be you know and when Reverend pretty rapture message we should have worn scroll desire of our food oh my wife of our life everything has to be second

probably a mark of myself its own sons 27 this is out of all of these he had a desire for in all the things with his power and his pristine he could have had a desire for but this is what one thing he

news I brought one you didn't accidentally come to the same hello this lady living her we talked about the third pole on thames and we explained it to the paper so rock so hard and complicated then people trying to figure out home the third port open it of the word anytime the word is revealed and revealed to you and they become your revelation it's open how this me in a word so every edge had a dip on the holy spirit so you know what you don't put no people's out in pinnacle because they come up on this relation here open word that God wanted for their only thing that we do we come to the floor but to the other word because this is the hand ship coming to the body Holly why because it's time but a manifestation of the sons of God to have a body change something different but Holly let me see this real quick hey look at the dipole come on girl a woman that had a desire now she didn't know that she was a seed of God neither did you you didn't know until you heard the word and there was you know what he's never heard the word and the word would had God hey that was not some representation now you would have kept going on the way he was I would have kept going on the way and she wasn't kept living with the same husband she had look down and see that she had a desire Messiah come so she was looking for Purusha she was looking for something to take place when the Messiah come it was a revelation now before this before in other ways so she was trapped up with all this all this stuff all the filters of lifestyle she were living in and how many more was guilty and trapped up in this lifestyle but the Messiah we were looking for something to take play hello we were not even looking but it was a desire somewhere you always had a desire for God just let you see her so Jesus came down and he came down cuz she had a desire he came to the fire seized anyhow no desire they said you better get out of here you devil I have to see in the problem God manifested after people seen the Godhead explained I don't believe that thing why they don't believe it because the souls in prison turn down the guy you see it's better for somebody not to her dismiss it didn't come to it and say I believe in saw the devil you black see the Holy Spirit they know what the god help early made known the revelation and you know where you come from and know who you are hey you ain't got it call it a devil you miss nobody a lot of people boy a lot of people just messing up check on this answer he came to him in the time watch watching what was she receiving she received in the third world for him by a day the word was gonna be open to her you know would you show me anything differ from the word open the Hyundai open to you she recognized the Messiah we reckon out the word which is Christ the Messiah this day but manifest in the son of man ministry so what was the difference between all recognize him and then we recognize him she recognized him before he was in her we recognize him in us that's a different wiener she recognized him as the statue standing there talking to him in flood how do we and she's seen the word in front but we see the word behind skin we see the word in us and that day you should know that I am in the father and the father me how are you this is the day talking about the kingdom of God is in me now so she said sir she said he goes through gillis quickly on desire and what he says she died now watch what she was doing she was drawing water cuz she was thirsty she has a thirst and everybody got a thirst he goes you see today that the thought was around water with your body desires so she was doing something that the flesh body had a scroll his offer was water how Lucille Jesus says there's a woman give me a drink how do give me a drink and the woman looks at him and she says you have nothing to draw with the well is deep and we know the story begin to gold Jesus say if you know who I am he would ask me over drink and I would give you water that she wouldn't have to come here to draw no more but if she said she had a desire Lord give me this water I'll do people that what we trying to say when lord give me this water that i don't have to draw no more i like to pull from the world I know pause does Deluxe's at the front I didn't come from the fountain of the Living Word Helia did Jesus say at all so we begin to look at this story and they didn't see the message we cannot fall watch that she begin to do did she says Jesus I'm just kind of perforating it might be broke up a little bit but you get what my poor so they begin to talk and then they saying you know she believed let's talk about unnatural she says to Jesus she says you say I father Jacob build this wheel in other words and how far the drop with Missy forget it going here trying to explain why didn't she dragged him from there well of Jacob you know to see drop on the world of Jacob it never changed her design honey she drunk that well and she kept on living with us she dropped from the will of Jacob and he'd never done nothing just knowing Jacob the Prophet honey buddy coming time Betsy told me the Word made flesh single to me Christ standing in his they are not said how many at the opening coming into word body she met the word body you know the word Saint John said it was the word by she back the word body how did he go soon as he says well it'll come a time that you were watching not in this mountain I'm not in Jerusalem he'll watch it a father in spirit of true you see what he started good he go did him you know he Jean actually a question bird she said go get you husband go get your husband now she been you know I sent him ain't got none to hide so she said ain't gotta know me ain't nobody telling me what to do I do what I want to do just say you said true I've been glad with no mystery the way this so-called legal is the spirit running man you mean I better profit do you need to do that Jesus didn't do that because he wasn't worried about cleaning up before catching we try to Berkeley we say you better quit doing this you better quit doing it and we let alone out do it and she don't know nothing about God holiday we got people take off doesn't take off their head by six months they write back in the world why don't you paint Mac the world hey what's with him so he goes on here total he did go he didn't say answer the question he go get your husband Jesus are you saying true now what was he looking at he was looking at in her was a little teeny baby teeny tinkle we're called truth in other words you say brother truth will prevail over lying any day you know what so truth is what God looks at didn't even do it even in other words she told her truth and he were concerned he was not concerned about he was concerned about her because I need her let me respond it was true he said you have said truth and the one you got now is not your husband so when he did it something on the inside internal because she knew they would she knew the ignored that was beyond it was silent when he go she's good Lord we know when the Messiah come here dude either he open the third pour he broke the revelation girl she recognized the word in the flesh that's all that hold of this message man we don't made it so we don't explain it away we don't explain what it is when everyone you recognize went in the mirror when the word came to Mary Mary did not understand everything and Jesus could not impregnate Mary but she had a revelation of st. John 1:14 the word in the beginning was the word then the word would be made flesh he could not pregnant her she come to that revelation so if you noticed when he began to talk to Mary he being inside America he said Mary had highly favored among you been highly favored and Beiber's Beckett well I have a she didn't understand this neither did he say the second time we know industry marry he said you gonna have a child and they begin to tell it what gonna happen and then angle be called or something made out of what I marry looking at the stake of marrying and this is never happened before this has never happened before anybody tell you now they got pregnant it was I swear to God tell me telling Allah from him tell him to repent and get that a Duchess Dell offer them it ain't happenin home or like that I don't care how many priests a poke whatever we say I done this a virgin birth it is a lie how do that only happen one time now there's so did she go to here so she ain't never happened before so Mary takes the natural approach using the natural understanding where we alway proach God we always try to take the supernatural and make it natural right I'll do you know will become we trying to make it so William believe me but they're putting it the supernatural is not made for you to believe it with your own call of my supernatural may for you to believe about faith when it cannot even be explained but you know that God is real you can explain God he took my spiritual you like so anyway you know God he might personally make himself known to you you can't pick up a book he would pick up all the newspapers he'll pick up all liturgy you won't read about God but you would never know God until he make yourself personally known so Kingdom became doing he says praise gotta be some prison but in a way yeah right he came through so he had the meeting said Mary personally known to Mary so what did he do to marry American Mary says where's Lord everything you say but we got one problem I am still a virgin I don't even know a man so the what she was saying we're truth because that's the only way that she would know life to be made manifest has come through the union of a man and a woman so and it never happened before and it was so what are you doing here bringing the mystery by sickos not gonna be a physical unit because the first ball come to a physical union between the beast and a woman sort of second that restored man he had to come by like it was in the beginning through the spoken word I'm just something had already been smoking before mercy shall bruise so every time for that to be fulfilled mary says she still couldn't believe it it just it was just too mysterious and jesus seen it but see you don't get a new birth it confuse you a new Barbara is a clear understanding of the word of God today you come to a clear-cut understanding of the word of God so he had to say something married to get married let's stipulate her mind something that she know that was impossible but it was done in a way now you know I'm tell you what things can happen when you think it could happen anything we all believe that you know and there were things that happen to one good thing right now that you know the brush set don't look at all that why her guy's name what's her name get away now true but it would be what if God's sake but rich in you you want to have a baby y'all know where go buy your clothes I know we don't believe that y'all have to pray for me I mean we have a hard time too but if God tell them to get ready they're gonna have a child you might a county over it might not be you might get explain it I might get x-ray but if God say so you believe religion do you want one you go clean it you can see that already you can see you can see that you don't really know that but we can't believe it but in a way but anyway you've gotta say it what happened so what does God do he go to tell about Elizabeth Elizabeth it was the open heart and stagnant don't receive the word same flesh wendy was hit was over there was she seen this she said he none too hard for God being under me Lord according to thy word and what was it Saint John 1:14 was in the stomach that's all it was st. John 14 was in her stomach the word was being made flesh God was coming in his word body shall we begin to realize here so having this way we find her day every time things happen it was always a word how do you never work and now that's what the of Revelation is the day is that we trying to get back to what we fell from we dispel our bodies and fail all creation is little groaning waiting you say what's going on now the world is falling apart birth pains is on the world everything happening sonica more the spirit of solomon is raising up to piss the payors and accepting it everything you know Loretta Souter let all the church world say everybody's alright they let Saleh me be made known to the world that they are accepted now they I don't we're not turning down people we are turning our spirit you show me what Jesus said it won't be one up in that holy city but the world is in that condition and when the world was in that condition Abraham were met the word cars standing in a body

attributes of the sons of God that we the sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word body word form body but at the apne this body is subjected to the word and earthly waiting for the owners change we are weighted and we feel this time Portland but we waiting to God God is like things come our way and then coming our way we are desired and we got a desire Lord to know I help me Lord let me dwell in the house of the Lord forever what is it coming from it's coming from a call a deep college in a deep well you don't want to be chained Lord you said brother I don't feel that way this time we get to thinking that way because I'm telling people it's not gonna get no better from this point we got some bumps in the road before we get out of here we run it the point right now you know the doors is just limited come when it come a time that we have to accept to roosters you know we're gonna have a problem two hands coming in no we're gonna have a little problem you know that you know they're not know that but I am gonna have a little problem am i you say what you say well you know ones that we can and the word I believe that anybody could be chained we I believe that you've you see the whole ego God give you a new nature and I don't believe that God makes the species he say God don't make a pig he don't make a legal pig or she was a big dick cheney dude she he said he always wasn't she honey if you were made a man you ain't gonna be changed you always was a man now I don't care what nature that way sighs saying doctor say that is a lot from hell God ain't got no God Oh make no mistakes if God made you a man he made you a man I lead underwear he'd give you the designer man and he said when you see a man don't have that design something is wrong with development the Bible doesn't say where it is so do you know in other words they can get mad they can spin all the way want to but then they go change got word and it works a weed at work so but realize here but the bride recognized her place and they begin to run out who they are and begin to manifest the attributes to be burned tell me Father become because they was manifesting the attributes of sodomy and what did he set the fire and this consumed the whole city how did endeavor go get ready not the city the stuff he gonna consume everything that who name is not found written in the book how do so in other words everything they're not found in the book we hope because soon they're gonna be people's gonna be good people and if good people's a new denomination and it'll be a lot of them god it's gonna take a stand so we don't want to know you've got genuine peoples in there that believe God even though they might have to go through tribulation in the world but they take a stand for grace right we gotta bleed that way so we're gonna look it on someone get ready to wine down so I told you it was gonna be long but I just want to say these things because we realized here that this revelation come for one person one purpose in us he said in Christ mister God revealed he said with just great revelation was revealed mysteries made known to to you and you denounced all the things of the world why because your desire to change what we don't do what the world do you didn't do this is because the revelation in you you just have no desire you can do what you want to do you didn't have to come to church tonight how they probably Robbie any believe you living in your in your flesh senses you probably like it I don't feel like doing it because you have this body's time people and I wanted to tell them I feel like I'd be I'd go to church and I just go and I feel like my body kept me man you don't feel like going tonight oh boy in other words in other word and don't do laid out on sudden the evening see like every demon in hell storm fanny boy that's the best rest you ever get sudden evening you lay down you the best girl so all these things we're alive but what make a car God puts something in you one thing I have desired of the Lord then I would dwell in the house of the Lord forever come on and we begin to realize so we realize it here that the bride is recognizing who she is and that way if this word begin to be getting more materializing you say brother Julius not materializing on the outside mature lighter from the inside honey you know watch something on you and you want your body chain they're gonna be from the house and your body jiggles far from the inside caterpillar the body chain he's not from the outside how do we don't change into

you've got the word in you your body gotta come subdue today you know you say what we gonna do when we rap out of you what we're gonna do in first death alone you this is what we waiting to fulfill manifestations of the sons of God the Lord Himself descended with a shout divorce at all ganger trump of god and now the day that we looking for one thing the templates to dead in Christ rise first I

develop the picture look girl was standing beside him where does she come from Brooklyn said she didn't have a time when up on earth she didn't have a body to go to so she were trapped in the

the what happened buddy come down come down pick up our earthly bodies honey what we gonna start we're gonna start right here they're gonna meet with us write the radical start right girl it has already started when you recognize the desire I want to dwell in the house of the Lord so ready to start it Rameses already started when you recognize Oh God create in me a clean heart hallelujah and I work it go then Sam my last quote here why because you said blood Joel we're gonna have about the Avenue bodies and we're gonna go down we're gonna do this we're gonna name though you're not going in at the other body when this resurrection takes first and birthday solonian you won't be able to do some days you ain't no ghost passes through the wall hallelujah other words of you in other words you won't take on the same body that Jesus had when he went in the grave he didn't raise up with the everybody he rose up a body was hand on him how do you say now he said notice redeemed back with what with him going home back to eternal life in a human body that will Adam sail from and will evil from had eternal life in the human body to drink and Leo he drank and eat and little that's what we're going back to you know you said Brooke Julian eat just eat and keep living we eat now we done we eat more we just die more the more you eat you die a lot quicker you can't win for losing if you don't eat you die but the point of there God got a died eternal life we're gonna eat and everything we eat is eternal so in other words I say you know right when we eat dinner and it was it's all life honey just keep eating and living and eating and living and eating and living that's the kind of body that we're trying to get back to a desire to eat and live forever how little work that's not the most desirable thing that men love is eating now when you fool you pretty good get hungry try down the road for two hours and you ain't at nothing and you look up on that billboard you take it man you ready why because that is what we live we live in right now by dance subsequent but in that eternal room we're gonna live by eternal substance everything we eat is eternal we're gonna and then what we gonna get to enjoy eating without dying I look at look at yesterday cup of day we went out to eat he probably weighed 120 pounds wet but he got an appetite good I looked at that plate I said man I saw even you I'm heat went back to the desert to everybody man I said he was already in the Mullaney we tried to watch what we we're trying to reel out here you know what am i eating I grow a little more I just ain't growing taller but the point of it is I'm never sitting there looking at this guy I'm saying how much he was putting down I'm wall I look at him I said man you one blessed guy with a hit off healthy tapeworm I just told her that you blessed to be that way but God let us get a desire and what we start eating now go to the Word of God we eaten off the book eaten the Word of God together created a desire to eat that why I said read your Bible that is not just an accident he said that he said how can I get closer to God because the more you read it is more you created a desire to eat some spiritual food that's it just it just didn't work don't worry if you don't read it you know the heaven he said he that would not win which one of feasible but you beat it defeated spiritual day he's gonna get spiritually and it's gonna get stronger if you feed it a bunch of tommyrot off the news I got more news preaching I do too by the word and we're not gonna go change the condition of the world other because it's under curse and we know that ever said 19 in 50 said I don't get what we do leave a raise up every jaw washer everything it will not change don't the condition of the world so that way I got to be birth would you bet we gonna change about all people said we go looking for the day but everybody getting along yeah you will at the Mullaney you won't have another day like that into the plane but all this junk that we hear all that just listening to politics stuff and actually becoming greater and more designed for politics and all the wood cut me rather the work of the world they may is preaching the Word of God trying to get their people starts by so clear I ain't got time for this stuff let my word be true true feels like details and people dumb enough to believe it in the message they say this is gonna happen he said just clap what you two were saying whoever the word said gonna be like song come on he won't burn it so I don't need no science to tell me that I don't need o news until why do you do what they're doing ain't doing what they're doing because the Bible predict and privacy that this is what's gonna happen before we get out of here so we might well look up stand looking around every musicians car god bless you maybe they say they don't get open the eyes of my heart Lord that's the only way we're gonna see God and the only way we're gonna see God we're gonna have to get a thirst for God hallelujah we gotta get a thirst for God you said brother I don't thirst like that anymore God need to say God create a holy thirst did I begin to
