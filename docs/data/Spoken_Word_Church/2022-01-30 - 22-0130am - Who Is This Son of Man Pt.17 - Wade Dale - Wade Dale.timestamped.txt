[1:24] that is a
[1:26] that's a lot
[1:28] 15 000 views in 90 days that's not bad
[1:31] that's not even a year that's only for
[1:33] that's only three months worth so
[1:35] um
[1:36] that's why that uh
[1:38] that we say that you know we
[1:40] we'd love to we'd love for you to be
[1:42] here because i want to read something i
[1:44] we you know and i were looking at
[1:46] something yesterday and somebody posted
[1:49] on facebook and it's really true the
[1:50] danger of missing church
[1:53] is that soon you don't miss it
[1:57] the danger of missing church
[2:00] is that soon you don't miss it
[2:02] wow
[2:04] god's never done away with church
[2:06] the bible's never done away with coming
[2:08] to church
[2:09] i know some people can't have to listen
[2:11] online and they don't have a place to go
[2:12] that's okay
[2:14] but still you can't
[2:16] go over what the bible says
[2:18] for satan not assembling yourself
[2:20] together and i know there's vacations
[2:22] and things you have to do work i'm not
[2:24] talking about that but when people
[2:25] disappear they hardly ever come back
[2:30] come on
[2:31] why because of that the danger of
[2:33] missing churches you just finally don't
[2:35] miss it well then the love of god is not
[2:37] in you
[2:38] amen if you don't love to come to church
[2:40] or if it doesn't
[2:41] if it doesn't uh
[2:43] boil in your heart to want to be
[2:45] somewhere
[2:46] listening to the word of god then uh
[2:51] then you need to be born again
[2:53] man that's just bottom line you need to
[2:55] be born again
[2:56] all right john 1
[2:58] verse 1 and we're going to talk a little
[2:59] bit about head ship today and then i
[3:02] think uh what brother luis is going to
[3:04] be here this afternoon and do
[3:07] his uh
[3:08] presentation on
[3:09] when they all went to the
[3:11] central america
[3:13] but
[3:14] i want to get to a point and then maybe
[3:16] we'll stop but i want to get i asked
[3:18] y'all to listen to adoption series
[3:21] um
[3:22] that sunday that we didn't have church
[3:23] because of the weather
[3:25] and that's what we're going to continue
[3:27] into because you can't preach on the
[3:28] statue of perfect man
[3:30] without preaching adoption you can't
[3:32] bring the son of man in without
[3:34] preaching adoption because that's where
[3:35] it comes from
[3:36] he actually had to be adopted amen
[3:39] that's what we'll get to in just a
[3:40] little bit so god bless you we love you
[3:42] with the love of the lord just remember
[3:44] all these announcements remember the
[3:46] banquet next weekend
[3:48] like i said before get to know your
[3:49] spouse very well because we don't want
[3:51] that collins group to have that
[3:54] have that uh
[3:55] trophy two years in a row no can't
[3:57] happen have we ever had anybody get it
[3:59] two years in a row
[4:03] tony and esther maybe
[4:05] okay maybe so but anyway they're
[4:08] they're not gonna get it this year
[4:10] i'm talking about the collins ain't
[4:11] nothing about y'all we're gonna get rid
[4:13] of them all right who is this son of man
[4:15] but you really get to know your spouse
[4:18] and
[4:20] um
[4:22] it's fun we have a good time it's fun
[4:26] is that it looks dark and can y'all see
[4:28] that
[4:29] does it look dark
[4:31] can y'all lighten that up in the back a
[4:33] little bit or is our or is our thingy
[4:35] going out
[4:38] because i can barely see it
[4:40] all right so while they're working on
[4:41] that let's pray the heavenly father
[4:43] thank you for this day that you give us
[4:45] we pray that you would sanctify us lord
[4:47] today for a little while for this
[4:48] journey that we're on
[4:50] that will push the world back lord leave
[4:52] the demons at the door
[4:54] and come inside and listen to you father
[4:56] we pray this should bless us and take
[4:58] care of us lord as the bride of jesus
[5:00] christ we call out to you lord
[5:02] that we want to be adopted we want to be
[5:04] placed we want these things lord but not
[5:07] we don't want them without character
[5:10] because the prophet of god told us that
[5:11] power without character is satanic
[5:14] but power with character is fit to rule
[5:16] father we want to number one we want to
[5:18] have rulership over this body that we
[5:21] live in
[5:23] and then we want to have leadership lord
[5:24] we'll talk about that in a minute
[5:26] headship from you father all the way
[5:27] down
[5:28] father we're the bride of jesus christ
[5:31] we're the feminist part of you
[5:33] lord so we have to have headship we have
[5:35] to have a place to assemble we have to
[5:38] have a fivefold ministry lord that that
[5:40] talks to us about you father
[5:42] lord you set it up that way and it must
[5:44] be perfect because you're perfect
[5:47] so we must
[5:48] we must go by that
[5:51] father we pray that you bless the ones
[5:52] that are sick the ones that are not here
[5:54] we ask you to take care of the ones lord
[5:56] that are on the highways of traveling
[5:58] different things lord bad weather way up
[6:00] north father we pray that you bless the
[6:01] bride up there and be with each one
[6:03] father bless us and the furthermore
[6:05] their service forgive us of our many
[6:06] mistakes and sins in jesus name
[6:09] amen
[6:10] in the beginning was the word and the
[6:11] word was with god and the word was god
[6:14] he was in the world and the world was
[6:15] made by him
[6:16] and the world knew him not
[6:18] he came unto his own and his own
[6:20] received him not but as many as received
[6:22] him how about this morning as many as
[6:24] received him
[6:26] to them gave he power to become the sons
[6:28] of god even to them that believe on his
[6:31] name
[6:32] which were born not of blood nor the
[6:33] will of the flesh nor the will of man
[6:35] but of god
[6:37] and the word was made flesh
[6:39] and dwelt among us and he be we beheld
[6:41] his glory the glory is of the only
[6:43] begotten of the father
[6:45] full of grace
[6:46] and truth you may be seated in the lord
[6:48] as blessing to the reading of the word
[6:49] let's go to hebrews 10 5 again as we
[6:51] were talking wednesday night
[6:53] some of you that weren't here that
[6:55] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[6:56] he says sacrifice an offering thou what
[6:59] is not but a body has now prepared me
[7:01] now we know scripture has dual meaning
[7:05] all right there there was a body created
[7:07] by a creative act
[7:10] of god to create the egg and the germ
[7:12] place it in mary and here comes the
[7:15] flesh body of jesus
[7:17] but also
[7:18] if you can read this right
[7:20] you're going to read a bond he has now
[7:22] prepared me and and i believe he's
[7:24] talking about the bride
[7:26] because he needs a bride you say oh no
[7:28] god don't need anything okay he chose
[7:30] that he needed it okay can we just say
[7:33] that he chose that he needed it okay so
[7:36] it's his business to fulfill what he's
[7:37] already said and he will have a bride
[7:40] because he saw that there would be a
[7:41] bride and he would in type make it to be
[7:44] husband and wife
[7:46] to deliver a child the only way christ
[7:49] is going to be delivered to this earth
[7:52] is through who his bride
[7:54] because there's no other body this body
[7:56] that hebrews 10 5 this body that was
[7:59] created is sitting on the throne now
[8:01] it's not down here in this dimension
[8:02] amen
[8:03] the flesh of jesus is not here today but
[8:07] he has transferred like we read there in
[8:10] verse 12 of john to them gave he power
[8:14] transforming power to become the sons of
[8:16] god amen
[8:18] what a great thing a you know you you
[8:20] think about all the great men in the
[8:22] world and and we do give honor to the
[8:25] great men in the world that try to do
[8:26] things right
[8:28] and but you know what without god
[8:29] without the baptism of the holy ghost
[8:31] they're going to hell
[8:33] unless there be given eternal life but
[8:36] i don't want to have to go on my works i
[8:38] i'd hope bill gates and all those
[8:39] different ones don't have to want to go
[8:41] on their works because they may have
[8:42] pulled a shady dealer every once in a
[8:44] while to get where they're at
[8:47] maybe not but i don't want to deal with
[8:48] that i want to become the sons of god
[8:50] right here
[8:52] and not have to worry about being at the
[8:54] white throne because you don't have to
[8:55] go i said before
[8:57] but what happens is see we take headship
[8:59] down here
[9:02] they're going to have to remember the
[9:04] bible says every knee shall bow every
[9:06] tongue shall confess is that right
[9:08] every knee you're either going to be
[9:10] made to do it or you're going to do it
[9:13] now
[9:14] because you love him
[9:16] and i'd rather do it now because i love
[9:17] him if i do it now because i love him i
[9:19] don't have to do it as a white throne
[9:21] judgment
[9:22] because every knee is going to bow and
[9:24] every tongue is going to confess
[9:26] that jesus christ is lord well you know
[9:27] what confess him today that he's lord of
[9:29] your life
[9:31] he already has headship
[9:34] he already has been married to you he
[9:36] already is your husband he's the head of
[9:39] the body of the church as we're going to
[9:40] read here
[9:42] ephesians 5 verse 23
[9:45] says for the husband is the head of the
[9:47] wife
[9:48] even as christ is the head of the church
[9:50] and he is the savior of the body
[9:53] now
[9:56] headship
[9:57] watch this real quick i got notes wrote
[9:59] down some of you just got the paperwork
[10:00] i wrote the notes down on it so you got
[10:03] it too you got the cheat sheet i wrote
[10:04] the cheat sheet before i run you all the
[10:05] copy off
[10:07] so watch what it is though it's christ
[10:11] man
[10:12] or the husband and the woman
[10:14] everybody got that amen
[10:17] all god was he poured into christ christ
[10:19] poured into the church
[10:20] we understand that
[10:22] but let's make it really simple
[10:25] we know that god in christ is the same
[10:26] person
[10:27] okay
[10:30] christ
[10:32] the man
[10:34] the woman everybody got them
[10:36] okay lord jesus christ
[10:40] christ man the woman all right you take
[10:42] christ man the woman who's christ christ
[10:44] is the lord the man was jesus and the
[10:45] woman is the bride
[10:48] and you said no that's christ well
[10:50] where's christ
[10:53] where's christ today
[10:55] christ is the anointed one
[10:58] now where now we know that he was
[10:59] anointed but he's in a body somewhere
[11:01] else
[11:03] another dimension
[11:05] you and i
[11:08] paul says we have the mind of christ
[11:12] christ in you the hope of glory
[11:15] all these different things brother brown
[11:16] said what are the seals the seals are
[11:18] christ
[11:19] well as the seals is the seals going to
[11:21] be revealed to cars and planes and boats
[11:24] and
[11:25] and fiddles and
[11:27] no
[11:28] people
[11:30] people it's going to be revealed to
[11:32] people and people are going to manifest
[11:35] christ
[11:36] because if christ is in you
[11:39] and you have the mind of christ you're
[11:40] going to act like him that's what we're
[11:42] talking about with the statue of a
[11:43] perfect man
[11:45] see man really didn't know now i want
[11:47] you to understand this man really didn't
[11:49] know
[11:49] how to act until christ came
[11:52] we're going to read it here just a
[11:53] little while they were given a law
[11:57] do this don't do that do this don't do
[11:59] that
[12:00] amen
[12:03] but now when christ come he didn't do
[12:04] away with the law he made it where you
[12:06] could live it
[12:08] because they tried for years and every
[12:10] year they tried to live it and they
[12:12] always made a mistake because they
[12:14] always had to go back and make another
[12:16] sacrifice right amen
[12:19] i would say kind of got frustrating you
[12:21] know you you take david being a murderer
[12:23] and having his best friend killed and
[12:25] being an adulterer you know david he
[12:27] probably
[12:31] he went to church
[12:33] to try to get rid of that
[12:36] make his sacrifice say god i'm i'm sorry
[12:39] but it was still there
[12:41] because you know what even when he had
[12:43] his friend killed
[12:44] he still took bathsheba
[12:46] he didn't he didn't say no i messed up i
[12:49] shouldn't have done that no he took her
[12:51] and he married her and of course we know
[12:53] solomon came to that we know god uses
[12:55] those things but
[12:57] david would not have done that if he
[12:58] would have had the indwelling of the
[13:00] holy ghost inside of him
[13:02] he wouldn't have done what he did amen
[13:05] so under the law though he was condemned
[13:07] because remember nathan comes on the
[13:09] scene the the the
[13:12] prophet for the hour
[13:14] comes on the saint it says david
[13:16] he gave him a little parable and david
[13:18] said kill the man. nathan said david
[13:21] you're the man i'm talking about
[13:24] but david
[13:26] i prayed for you
[13:28] you're not going to die
[13:30] thank god we had a prophet show up
[13:32] in the end time and say i prayed for you
[13:36] and now you can make it you're not going
[13:38] to die oh we may physically have to go
[13:40] but somebody's not going to according to
[13:42] what the
[13:43] hour the prophet in the end time told us
[13:46] i've prayed for you right amen i prayed
[13:49] for you people you're going to make it
[13:51] somebody's going to make this thing amen
[13:54] why not just believe it's you
[13:56] colossians 1 verse 15 but remember lord
[13:58] jesus christ headship christ man and the
[14:01] woman and we know that you know what you
[14:03] and i are what you and i are the female
[14:06] everybody got that
[14:07] all of us male men and women under the
[14:10] headship
[14:11] of being bride
[14:14] what do we do
[14:16] we take the veil i'm working on
[14:18] something there we're
[14:20] looking back in traditions about the
[14:21] veil
[14:23] the only person that didn't wear a veil
[14:25] back in the really old times and way
[14:28] back
[14:29] was prostitutes and people that were
[14:31] married
[14:32] because you'd already hurt you had a bae
[14:34] alone
[14:35] and when you got married you took that
[14:36] veil off
[14:38] amen and and you become what you become
[14:40] mrs whoever that was standing there
[14:42] that's the same way with me and you we
[14:44] don't have to wear a veil again
[14:46] we ought to let the world know we're
[14:48] married to jesus christ because the
[14:50] world knew when you were married and you
[14:52] walked down the street they didn't have
[14:54] wedding rings back then
[14:56] it was a testimony though that either
[14:58] you were a prostitute which meant you
[15:00] had already been married a few hundred
[15:01] times
[15:02] or you were married to a husband and
[15:04] then they said oh that person's married
[15:07] what can people do me and you the same
[15:09] way oh there goes a christian
[15:13] amen
[15:14] because that's our outward appearance
[15:15] that's the only way the world's going to
[15:16] see it right right amen
[15:19] i don't know why y'all quiet today i
[15:20] ain't really got on you yet
[15:23] yeah
[15:24] colossians 1 verse 5 not going to
[15:26] colossians 1 verse 15 who is the image
[15:28] of the invisible god the firstborn of
[15:31] every creature we read this wednesday
[15:34] let's go down to 18. he is the head of
[15:36] the body of the church
[15:38] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[15:40] the dead that in all things he might
[15:41] have the preeminence so god had to come
[15:43] in human flesh we know that we've been
[15:45] talking about it for 17 sermons that god
[15:48] came down in human flesh to show us how
[15:50] to act when god would come inside of us
[15:54] amen it's really simple
[15:56] and if you don't portray it then you
[15:58] don't have the fruits of the spirit
[15:59] inside of you like jesus christ did
[16:04] he'll be okay with that
[16:05] all right now let's go to number one
[16:08] quote where brother brown says but the
[16:09] body was built by the word which was the
[16:11] prophets and here comes the head of it
[16:13] all jesus came on the scene now remember
[16:16] he was the fullness of the word right
[16:19] everywhere god
[16:22] but he's still learned by the things he
[16:24] suffered
[16:26] and being made perfect we read those
[16:27] scriptures
[16:29] you say oh no jesus well
[16:32] humanly he was not perfect
[16:36] he was god
[16:39] there was nothing wrong with his word
[16:42] he'd have to take his word back
[16:45] but there were certain things as a human
[16:47] being that thank god they didn't put it
[16:48] in the
[16:49] put it in here about you know like
[16:51] brother dale always said he thought god
[16:53] uh jesus was so much god that he
[16:54] couldn't stump his toe or he couldn't
[16:56] know no he got splinters he fell and
[16:58] busted his knee and
[17:00] probably busted his head where's jonas
[17:02] at jonas back there in the back got a
[17:05] little got a knot on his eyeball where
[17:07] he fell and hit the
[17:09] hit the corner of the table at his house
[17:11] well you know what jesus probably had a
[17:12] shine or two
[17:14] you already know what that is a shiner
[17:15] is something you get you know
[17:17] when somebody pops you in the eye or you
[17:20] fall and hit something but jesus was
[17:22] that way because he learned by the
[17:24] things he suffered even when he was 13
[17:26] years old in the temple
[17:28] doing the work of his father right
[17:30] the bible says after they
[17:34] found him he became subject unto him
[17:38] he didn't turn around and say now bless
[17:39] god i'm god
[17:42] no
[17:43] could have
[17:45] but that wasn't in him to do that
[17:48] it wasn't in him to say that it was
[17:49] anything to say okay
[17:51] i gotta learn
[17:53] i know i gotta learn i know who my
[17:55] father is number one see that's what
[17:56] we've got
[17:57] all of us today we've got to learn who
[17:59] our father is
[18:01] amen
[18:02] listen your father
[18:05] may be a natural father he may be gone
[18:08] but your spiritual father if you're born
[18:09] again is god
[18:11] all right so god's your father
[18:13] so you're not fatherless
[18:14] all right so the body was built by the
[18:16] word which was the prophets here comes
[18:18] the head of all of it jesus came on the
[18:21] scene now we talked about headship
[18:23] headship means power authority and honor
[18:25] listen everything comes from the head
[18:27] right
[18:28] everything all your intelligence the
[18:31] whatever makes my hand move the reason
[18:33] i'm gesturing with my hand is because my
[18:35] brain is telling it to do that
[18:37] right
[18:40] that's exactly what it's doing it's
[18:41] telling me exactly you know or you know
[18:43] that hurt so don't do that again but it
[18:45] all comes from the head so christ is the
[18:48] head and that's what we've been looking
[18:49] at
[18:50] for the past 17 sermons
[18:52] but what happened was is back in the
[18:54] first church age when jesus christ left
[18:58] they didn't understand full headship
[19:01] does everybody okay with that they did
[19:02] and i'll read where you brother brown
[19:04] tells he said they had just enough
[19:06] just enough
[19:08] to get born again just enough to say
[19:12] i'm a born-again believer just enough to
[19:13] say
[19:15] god is my father and i'm going to live a
[19:17] good christian life now that's what the
[19:19] prophet of god said
[19:21] but remember
[19:22] the son of man stood one day and says i
[19:25] don't have a place to lay my head we
[19:26] were talking about that wednesday
[19:28] he said the son of man has no place to
[19:30] lay his head well he didn't have a place
[19:31] he couldn't rest
[19:33] listen on the day of pentecost
[19:36] on the day of pentecost
[19:38] that was the rest
[19:40] that's right come to me all you labor
[19:42] and heavy laden and i'll give you rest
[19:45] brother brown said it wasn't a day
[19:48] it was what happened to them right
[19:51] like he's talking about saturday you
[19:52] know everybody wants to we're not
[19:53] everybody but this whole witness and all
[19:55] the sabbatarians want to do it on
[19:57] saturday which is fine that's okay but
[19:59] sunday we honor the resurrection
[20:02] but he said there was no day the bible
[20:04] even tells you paul tells us there's no
[20:06] day that you're supposed to
[20:09] listen we're supposed to have sunday
[20:10] every day
[20:11] we're supposed to
[20:13] portray the resurrection every day when
[20:15] you get up listen when you get older i'm
[20:18] 62 now
[20:20] it is a resurrection when i get up every
[20:22] morning
[20:24] for some of y'all young ones that just
[20:26] jump up and throw your shoes on and sh
[20:28] your hair around and throw a little
[20:30] deodorant and head out the door
[20:33] god bless you
[20:35] you get a little bit older and you'll be
[20:37] like
[20:38] i need to do this in shifts
[20:41] feet get up
[20:43] arms but you know what
[20:46] that's the part of getting older
[20:51] but the resurrection should be every day
[20:54] because the resurrection being every day
[20:56] what was he was the first to raise
[20:58] headship he was if everything he did was
[21:01] first
[21:02] he was the first fruit
[21:04] he was the first one to be born without
[21:05] sex
[21:07] born now see adam wasn't born
[21:11] he said no adam no adam was created
[21:14] adam wasn't born jesus was the first one
[21:16] to be born without sex he was the first
[21:19] one to have the preeminence in his life
[21:22] that the father spoke to him and he did
[21:24] what the father said
[21:26] and then he what taught us that and then
[21:29] they killed him put him in a grave and
[21:31] he was the first one to resurrect by
[21:33] itself
[21:38] i want you all to understand that
[21:41] jesus had to pray for lazarus to be
[21:43] resurrected there had to be prayer for
[21:45] jerusale's daughter to be resurrected
[21:47] there had to be somebody in her seed who
[21:49] interceded for jesus
[21:52] no
[21:52] he stood up one day and he said you
[21:54] destroy this body and i'll raise it up
[21:57] in three days
[21:58] he didn't say the second person of a
[21:59] trinity or he didn't say my father he
[22:02] said i'll raise it back up
[22:07] folks we're gonna take that to a grave
[22:08] one day
[22:10] graves
[22:13] and they'll resurrect from that right
[22:15] there
[22:16] that's what they'll resurrect from that
[22:18] the resurrection's inside of you
[22:20] and then the call is going to come from
[22:22] what the bride
[22:23] the bride is going to make that call
[22:25] it's not going to be now listen don't
[22:27] get me wrong it's not going to be god
[22:29] telling jesus jesus telling the preacher
[22:30] and the preacher telling us i know
[22:32] that's how you get communication
[22:34] but you're not going to have to call
[22:35] brother dale
[22:38] brother bob
[22:39] and say can i go out there i just got a
[22:41] real feeling that i can get raise
[22:42] somebody from the dead today you ain't
[22:44] got to call nobody
[22:46] because adoption is the
[22:48] name on the checkbook
[22:51] listen if gee i'm getting a little ahead
[22:52] of myself but if jesus wrote the check
[22:58] and cast it yes
[23:01] and he gives you power and authority
[23:03] to write the check
[23:05] and cash it see where we're at
[23:10] see what we're looking at when this
[23:11] adoption comes that's why adoption is
[23:13] it's really uh uh it's it's been
[23:16] portrayed all down through centuries
[23:18] from from israel all the way to today
[23:20] but it's got to pertain to something
[23:22] else it's not an adoption like you have
[23:24] a different set of parents and you're
[23:25] adopted
[23:29] no it's adoption and we'll talk about in
[23:31] just a few minutes we'll go through the
[23:32] tutors and the governor is that okay
[23:34] but that's what i want to get to because
[23:36] that's listen that's what's holding us
[23:38] back folks
[23:39] listen we can have a church full
[23:42] and i pray
[23:43] of born-again believers from the front
[23:45] door to the back door
[23:47] and still the resurrection won't come
[23:54] until we come to maturity
[23:58] until we come as brother um donnie and
[24:01] the different ones said you know the
[24:02] teaching part of it brother bob the
[24:04] teaching part of it
[24:06] is what we need to bring us you know i i
[24:08] just don't understand how preacher in
[24:10] this message can stand up and say we
[24:12] don't need teaching anymore well you
[24:14] know why he said that
[24:15] he needed teaching
[24:18] i mean that's the whole thing he needed
[24:19] teaching you know people get up and they
[24:21] say well well i'm not of this or i'm not
[24:23] of that and you're like
[24:26] you're the very thing that you complain
[24:27] about
[24:29] most of us are
[24:30] hello
[24:31] so anyway
[24:33] beam remember beam and and
[24:35] and two before and and toothpick okay
[24:40] but we need teaching
[24:42] because as you read it today teaching
[24:44] places you
[24:46] i want to be placed because i don't you
[24:48] know it's great being a christian
[24:50] i love it i've had a good 20-something
[24:52] year run of being a true born-again
[24:54] christian and i love it
[24:56] but
[24:58] what am i still doing here
[25:00] i'm getting older i got more birthdays
[25:02] coming up i'm heading toward an end
[25:06] but not if you're born again
[25:08] now if you're born again not to if you
[25:10] take what this message means
[25:13] sure this message means and we'll get to
[25:15] in just a little while it is do's and
[25:17] don'ts it is a school master to start
[25:19] you off with
[25:22] that's right but now if you're still
[25:25] work having a problem with your hair and
[25:27] your dress and your men you know having
[25:29] a little beer every once in a while and
[25:30] saying a custom word every once in a
[25:31] while you're not born again
[25:34] period
[25:38] sorry
[25:39] you just ain't
[25:42] so work from there
[25:44] okay that's babies
[25:46] that's and you can't be a baby not a
[25:48] problem
[25:50] we all started babies
[25:53] but i can't stand
[25:55] a 60 year old crying baby
[25:59] amen
[26:01] i mean back to diapers and no teeth and
[26:03] screaming and crying and yeah
[26:05] you understand what i'm saying
[26:09] god told moses one day
[26:12] said you speak to that rock
[26:17] and he messed up
[26:19] because he wasn't in the right position
[26:21] because he smote the rock
[26:23] and when he smoked the rock i was just
[26:25] reading it this morning god said
[26:27] moses i love you
[26:29] i appreciate you you did everything i
[26:32] told you to do it said one thing
[26:34] now you see what i mean what is our
[26:35] promised land sure it's the baptism the
[26:37] holy ghost but i promise land is a
[26:38] change of the body
[26:40] and our promised land is adoption that's
[26:42] what that's what you see that moses when
[26:44] then went through the wilderness and
[26:45] then joshua took him into the land to
[26:47] place them according to adoption he
[26:50] placed them in the land moses didn't get
[26:52] to go
[26:53] because one thing he did
[26:55] god said i told you to speak to it and
[26:57] said you hit it and you hit it didn't
[26:58] hit it one time you hit it twice
[27:02] disobedience
[27:04] one thing look how great moses was
[27:08] spoke lift the ear to god
[27:12] and god said because you didn't do one
[27:14] thing
[27:16] in other words you exalted yourself the
[27:18] prophet said you exalted yourself
[27:20] above me
[27:22] when you had to hit the rock because it
[27:24] was something you did moses you were
[27:26] supposed to speak it and then go forward
[27:28] that's the same way with me and you it's
[27:29] not going to be and don't get me wrong
[27:30] it's not going to be how many hands we
[27:32] lay on and how much we scream and shout
[27:35] right here
[27:37] right here
[27:38] head ship the head is the only place you
[27:40] can talk from
[27:41] your body just displays what you're
[27:43] talking about
[27:45] i know sometimes we
[27:46] people say things and their body don't
[27:49] don't follow behind it but that's kind
[27:51] of the way we are with jesus christ
[27:53] because he's the head and we're the body
[27:55] and sometimes we don't do what he says
[27:57] why because we're not adopted we're not
[27:59] we've not come to a place to where he
[28:01] can say
[28:03] here's the checkbook
[28:05] now we'll get to that in just a little
[28:06] bit but let's go to psalms
[28:09] 85 9.
[28:12] that thing is not going to get any
[28:14] brighter richer it's dying in it
[28:18] lay hands on the sick
[28:22] that thing's been good though it's been
[28:23] up there a long time
[28:25] i'm talking about the
[28:26] uh projector but that's why we're trying
[28:28] to get this finished over here so that
[28:30] we can have some really clear numbers
[28:31] but i'm sorry if you can't see that
[28:34] but i love this scripture it says surely
[28:36] his salvation is not in the fear that
[28:38] glory may dwell in our land mercy and
[28:40] truth are met together see something had
[28:42] to come together listen a husband and
[28:44] wife has to come together before a
[28:46] child's born
[28:49] so god had to become man so that he
[28:52] could connect with us that he could come
[28:54] back on the day of pentecost and say
[28:56] that's my bride but that wasn't all
[29:01] i want to have a baby but i don't want
[29:02] that baby to stay a baby
[29:04] i want that baby to grow
[29:08] grow in grace and knowledge
[29:11] mercy and truths are met righteousness
[29:12] and peace have kissed each other
[29:15] truth shall spring out of what out of
[29:16] this earth
[29:18] not the ball we're not talking about the
[29:19] ball of the earth but come about this
[29:20] earth and righteousness shall look down
[29:22] from heaven
[29:24] number two and layout to see in church
[29:25] age the prophet of god says when god
[29:27] created himself with bodies talking
[29:28] about hebrews let me talk about
[29:29] revelations 3 14 when god created
[29:32] himself a body he came down and lived in
[29:34] it
[29:35] isn't that familiar
[29:38] it now what he did on the day of
[29:39] pentecost
[29:41] we say oh no that was when he after when
[29:43] we you know when uh easter or i'm not
[29:45] easter but
[29:46] april when we christmas time you know
[29:49] when little baby jesus was born god came
[29:51] and lived in it yeah okay well that's
[29:52] how it got started
[29:55] but that's not gonna do you any good
[29:56] till he comes and lives in you
[29:59] really simple when god created himself a
[30:00] body and that's what he's doing now he's
[30:02] creating himself a body
[30:06] a bride
[30:08] a bride body
[30:10] he came down and lived in it that's the
[30:11] beginning of the creation of god now
[30:12] remember he's the beginning but what
[30:15] you and i are the continuation of that
[30:18] amen you and i are the continuation
[30:20] wake up
[30:24] amen we've got some nurses we got if you
[30:27] have heart failure then we
[30:31] i got some dr glycerin somewhere so
[30:33] that i don't need to take any anymore
[30:35] thank god
[30:36] so uh but i got it so in case some of
[30:38] y'all need it when i do that i want you
[30:40] to stroke out on me but just don't go to
[30:42] sleep it is warm it is warm up here but
[30:44] that's okay
[30:46] when god created himself a body he came
[30:48] down and lived in that's the beginning
[30:49] of the creation of god oh isn't he
[30:50] wonderful
[30:52] hebrews 5 verse 8 says though he were a
[30:54] son
[30:55] yet learn the obedience by the things we
[30:56] suffer now we're going to get into that
[30:58] in galatians
[31:00] where paul picks that up in adoption
[31:02] because see that's me and you
[31:07] i'm telling you folks we're pushing all
[31:08] these scriptures to well you're talking
[31:10] about jesus well you're talking about no
[31:12] i'm not about you
[31:14] are you not a son of god
[31:17] though he were a son
[31:20] though
[31:20] donnie foxbush was a son he's a son
[31:24] he can't be was a son if you were born
[31:26] you're always going to be a son you may
[31:28] have different titles but you're always
[31:29] going to be a son of something yet
[31:31] learned he obedience by the things which
[31:33] he suffered
[31:35] and being made perfect
[31:38] jesus said be therefore perfect even my
[31:40] father in heaven why he opened the door
[31:43] to perfection
[31:45] listen i know he was god almighty in
[31:47] human flesh but he lived a human life
[31:50] but he was almighty god
[31:53] now can you not live a human life and be
[31:55] almighty god yes you can
[31:57] if you'll yield yourself like he did
[32:00] he's given us that opportunity he's
[32:02] opened that door i am the door
[32:06] right
[32:07] listen he may have shut it to the world
[32:09] but he's oh he's left it open to me and
[32:12] you open door open book we're in all the
[32:16] open everything open heaven open skies
[32:20] just reach in and get it right
[32:22] it's wonderful to say all that door's
[32:24] open that door is open there's a million
[32:26] dollars inside there that door's open
[32:28] you can stand out there and you can die
[32:30] of poverty
[32:32] until you go get it
[32:34] until you go get it i love i'm talking
[32:36] about chris long the other day and he's
[32:38] been preaching on the statue of perfect
[32:39] man i'm glad everybody started preaching
[32:41] on the statue of perfect man i am glad
[32:43] that
[32:44] but he said look he said ever he he
[32:46] showed me a picture and he drew up a
[32:48] line because right here there's a line
[32:50] with a you know like a
[32:52] point
[32:53] a line pointing up like this
[32:55] he said every time you come to each one
[32:56] of these you come to a crossroad
[33:01] across right road
[33:04] every one of them
[33:05] you come to a crossroad why you can
[33:07] either continue
[33:09] or you can stop
[33:11] or you can go in another direction
[33:13] because brother branham he's talking
[33:14] about he said oh you get all the way up
[33:16] here and you ain't got the holy ghost
[33:17] yet well that's what seals you in
[33:19] the true baptism not that you got a
[33:21] false one
[33:23] but you got the baptism of the holy
[33:25] ghost in a baby form
[33:27] baby
[33:30] and it's okay to cry
[33:32] but man god doesn't want people to cry
[33:35] he's made you and give you the open book
[33:38] the open door and the open revelation so
[33:41] that you can take what he had
[33:44] listen
[33:45] show me in the bible matthew mark luke
[33:47] and john where jesus had to beg for
[33:48] anything
[33:52] work it up
[33:57] let's read the other day you know he was
[33:59] dealing with those demons and
[34:01] the demons was telling him what to do
[34:04] remember
[34:07] demon says no don't let us go in no
[34:09] swine over there and all jesus said was
[34:11] go
[34:13] he didn't have to build anything up
[34:16] but his presence when he walked up to
[34:18] that uh maniac of gadara
[34:22] the legion that had thousands of demons
[34:24] in him
[34:25] the demon said why have you come here
[34:27] thou son of god
[34:29] see they were in the spirit world
[34:32] that's why some people don't like you
[34:34] i've got something in my pocket brother
[34:35] dick addison gave me i'm going to read
[34:36] it
[34:37] you ready
[34:40] brother did give me this long time ago
[34:42] he said some people will never like you
[34:45] because your spirit irritates their
[34:48] demons
[34:48] [Laughter]
[34:54] one more time some people
[34:56] will never like you
[34:58] because your spirit irritates their
[35:00] demons
[35:02] that's what i want to happen
[35:06] listen if you don't like me you got a
[35:08] problem i don't you do
[35:14] i think that's his handwriting
[35:16] i thought maybe gail did it but nope
[35:18] that's dick's handwriting thank god
[35:20] thank god we knew a man named dick
[35:22] anderson
[35:24] did you know what a lot of people didn't
[35:25] like dick
[35:27] a lot of people didn't like dick why he
[35:29] was different that's okay i like
[35:31] different
[35:32] right maybe your demons got irritated
[35:34] irritated by his spirit
[35:37] hmm
[35:38] think about that chew on that for a week
[35:40] and figure out what's going on go to
[35:41] work and say
[35:43] okay
[35:44] but look we're heading towards something
[35:46] let's get back to the subject and being
[35:47] made perfect
[35:49] he became the author now being an author
[35:52] he had to write something
[35:54] right
[35:55] being an author he had what and the
[35:57] author is the originator
[36:01] he wrote this book so that we can live
[36:03] it
[36:05] is okay with that
[36:06] being made perfect he became the author
[36:09] of eternal salvation unto all them that
[36:11] what
[36:13] obey him
[36:16] obedience is better than sacrifice
[36:20] isn't that what samuel told
[36:22] told saul
[36:23] saul said i think i'll do it my way i'm
[36:26] going to save them because i'm going to
[36:27] get some information from them kings
[36:29] and and we're going to take some of them
[36:31] cows we're going to take some of them
[36:33] horses and we're going to take some of
[36:34] them mules and we're going to add it to
[36:36] my kingdom
[36:37] what's the first thing samuel said he
[36:39] said i hear something i'm not supposed
[36:41] to be hearing
[36:42] i hear the blatant of the sheep
[36:45] and i hear the cows moving didn't god
[36:47] tell you i told you saul
[36:50] to kill everything
[36:53] men women children and animals and there
[36:56] was uh og and the other king sitting
[36:58] there well what's the first thing samuel
[37:00] done
[37:01] samuel says saul the king the kingdom's
[37:04] been ripped from you rendered from you
[37:06] because you didn't do what god said here
[37:08] we go again somebody didn't do something
[37:09] god said he took the kingdom away from
[37:11] saul and give it to one better which we
[37:13] know it was david but what samuel do he
[37:15] didn't walk out the door
[37:18] prophets must have carried swords too
[37:22] because he pulled his sword and cut both
[37:23] of his head off
[37:25] pretty messy you say oh he's a nice
[37:27] prophet yeah he's nice when you did what
[37:29] he said
[37:31] but he's the one who killed the two
[37:33] kings that was supposed to die
[37:34] obedience then true we see is great
[37:37] better than sacrifice
[37:39] okay obedience
[37:42] he wasn't obedient
[37:43] but this man was obedient matthew 3
[37:45] verse 16. jesus when he was baptized
[37:47] went straight out of the water and he
[37:48] saw the spirit of god descending like
[37:50] the dove and lighted on him now this is
[37:52] the beginning
[37:53] and we're going to get to this just in a
[37:55] minute
[37:57] and he saw the spirit of god descending
[37:58] like the dove and light on him below a
[38:00] voice from heaven saying what this is my
[38:01] beloved son in whom i'm well pleased
[38:04] all right now that was at your new birth
[38:07] god said the same thing to you we
[38:08] already been through that but now he was
[38:10] not well pleased to hear you him
[38:15] he was pleased to help you start your
[38:17] journey
[38:20] okay he was pleased to help you start
[38:22] your journey
[38:24] then he gave you what tutors and
[38:26] governors we'll read in just a minute
[38:29] to help you along the way listen if you
[38:31] deny headship anywhere down the line
[38:36] pastor's the head of the church
[38:38] there's always headship
[38:40] christ is the head of the bride you're
[38:41] the head of your wife and you know you
[38:43] know the bible tells you to treat your
[38:44] wife the way you want god to treat you
[38:46] you better be careful
[38:51] thank you some of you
[38:53] some of you maybe need to think about
[38:54] that
[38:55] but that's what the bible says
[38:57] the bible tells you that
[39:01] we've seen women
[39:02] through the ages they take that stuff
[39:04] literal which is you know that's their
[39:06] people's business
[39:07] but um
[39:09] listen
[39:10] your wife's not dog meat if she's born
[39:12] again
[39:16] she is not dog meat
[39:17] she is not to be run over
[39:20] amen but you sisters are not supposed to
[39:22] be the head of the
[39:23] family either so
[39:25] you see what the balance is there's a
[39:27] wonderful balance there if you'll get
[39:28] into balance
[39:30] instead of having to be you know
[39:34] people forget where they came from
[39:37] people forget that christ with loving
[39:39] hands saved your heart and saved your
[39:41] soul amen and then you become obedient
[39:44] to him and even when you're not obedient
[39:46] to him he doesn't slap you down on the
[39:48] ground
[39:49] what's our worst enemy god or me
[39:52] right you
[39:54] that's not your worst enemy you are
[39:57] you beat yourself up way more and god
[39:59] beats you up
[40:01] because he does it with nail scarred
[40:02] hands
[40:04] meanest man i know number three we'll
[40:05] get here real quick
[40:07] jesus first doctrine it was what ye must
[40:10] be born again we went through that
[40:12] before
[40:13] now let's go to number four it is the
[40:15] rising of the sun
[40:16] he said i'm afraid today that too many
[40:18] of us are not getting people to christ
[40:22] we're getting them to a church to a
[40:23] theory see that's why we need to find
[40:25] full ministry
[40:26] we need to find full ministry we need a
[40:28] we need a evangelist to come by and stir
[40:31] up
[40:32] get your heart mellow get your heart
[40:34] pliable where where then somebody can
[40:36] come in then and teach you
[40:38] yeah all right
[40:40] that's the way it works and it works
[40:41] perfect because you know what god said
[40:43] if you'll listen to these five it'll
[40:45] perfect you
[40:47] pretty simple
[40:52] well why don't we do it
[40:54] i mean we do but i mean why does not the
[40:56] world just fall over and say well we'll
[40:57] just do it no
[40:59] people don't want headship if you're not
[41:01] born again you're not you're going to
[41:02] deny headship
[41:05] and who's you you deny headship christ
[41:08] don't deny his ship you're denying
[41:09] headship
[41:10] all right i'm afraid too many of us are
[41:13] getting the p not getting the people to
[41:14] christ we're getting them to a church or
[41:16] a theory
[41:17] but we must get them to christ he is the
[41:19] only one and the only one that has life
[41:22] all right there's not life in anything
[41:24] else
[41:25] let's go to matthew 17 verse 5.
[41:27] and while he yet spake now this is this
[41:30] is jesus from matthew
[41:32] 2 or three when he was born as a baby
[41:36] to now matthew 17
[41:38] he's only six months the prophet said
[41:40] he's only six months away from dying
[41:44] so what am i saying
[41:47] it may take your whole life
[41:51] to come to that place
[41:53] but you can come to that place if you'll
[41:55] be obedient
[41:57] i mean jesus was 30 years walking
[42:02] and then three years
[42:04] of ministry before jesus was taken in
[42:08] type up on a mountain he was taken on
[42:10] the mountain and overshadowed and said
[42:14] here ye him
[42:15] now while he had spate behold a bright
[42:17] light overshadowed them he behold a
[42:18] voice out of the cloud which said this
[42:20] is my beloved son and whom i am well
[42:22] pleased
[42:23] that's the same thing he said
[42:25] three years before
[42:26] but he added a little something to it
[42:28] he'd come to a position he said hear
[42:31] ye him
[42:33] and when they had lifted their eyes they
[42:34] saw no man save jesus only that's verse
[42:37] 8.
[42:37] and as they came down from the mountain
[42:39] jesus charged him saying tell this
[42:40] vision to no man until the son of man be
[42:42] risen again from the dead now we know
[42:44] what happened the son of man was
[42:46] rejected put on a cross
[42:52] ascended up the son of man ascended
[42:55] and came back the son of god on the day
[42:58] of pentecost does everybody got that
[43:00] so the headstone stayed up there where
[43:02] it was
[43:04] because man had shut him off
[43:07] i'm just telling you what the prophet
[43:09] said
[43:09] because the son of man didn't come till
[43:11] the end time
[43:13] all right
[43:14] and his disciples said why then say the
[43:16] scribes of the lies must first come and
[43:18] jesus answered and said to them elish
[43:20] truly shall first come
[43:21] and restore all things we gotta have a
[43:23] restoration back to what
[43:26] back to the truth
[43:28] we lost the truth that's why god
[43:30] couldn't work except a little bit in
[43:32] luther and a little bit in wesleyan a
[43:34] little bit in pentecost
[43:37] remember i'll read them i'll read the
[43:39] quote but now let's go to the next one
[43:40] right there um
[43:42] whoever's running
[43:44] but now look
[43:46] here's matthew 17 verse 5.
[43:50] jesus has come to a place where god says
[43:53] hear ye him
[43:56] brother brown said six months later they
[43:58] crucified him well between that time
[44:02] that six months of his three and a half
[44:04] year ministry
[44:05] kind of strange
[44:07] he preached the seals
[44:09] he didn't preach the sales in matthew 4
[44:11] 8
[44:12] 10
[44:13] not even 17.
[44:15] he preached him in matthew 24.
[44:18] so he had to come to a position listen
[44:21] the prophet that god preached on the
[44:22] seals p
[44:23] clarence larkin preached on the seals
[44:25] this one preached on the seals but
[44:26] brother adam had to come to a place of
[44:28] adoption
[44:29] he had to go out to arizona and be
[44:31] positionally placed before he could
[44:34] preach the real revelation of the seals
[44:36] his real message
[44:39] not that the other message was false
[44:42] okay
[44:45] but he preached the seals in matthew 24.
[44:48] now let's look at the order and this is
[44:50] how me and you are supposed to come
[44:52] you can't come any other way because you
[44:54] know what this is the way jesus came
[44:56] he's first fruits right he's when he
[44:58] came to maturity first he's the one that
[45:00] took a a rapture first he's the one that
[45:03] took a body change first everybody got
[45:05] that
[45:06] so what was his first what was his first
[45:09] sermon
[45:11] three and a half years ago from this
[45:13] moment
[45:14] of death on this side you must be born
[45:16] again
[45:17] pleased to dwell same thing with you if
[45:19] you're born again today all right
[45:21] then you got he had to come to what a
[45:24] time of obedience
[45:26] everybody everybody with me
[45:28] obedience
[45:30] learn learn learn he obedience learned
[45:33] we obedience
[45:35] by the things we suffered
[45:38] suffered yeah
[45:41] read all them the way brother branham
[45:42] explained them
[45:45] and what it does it really just grabs at
[45:47] the root of you and pulls everything out
[45:48] of you that your old nature was
[45:52] if you had a temper
[45:56] maybe you didn't want to lose it
[45:59] but if you keep
[46:00] praying enough
[46:02] god's going to jerk it out
[46:06] i'll hold my hand down
[46:09] patience
[46:10] patience
[46:12] patience
[46:15] jim's stepmom had a sign in her kitchen
[46:18] said lord give me patience but i want it
[46:19] right now
[46:24] ain't that the way we are though
[46:29] they that waited upon the lord
[46:31] all right so here's your birth
[46:35] he's pleased to dwell in you
[46:38] he don't want you to stay a baby
[46:41] so it jesus learned by the things he
[46:44] suffered learned he obedience of things
[46:46] he suffered then he had to go up and
[46:48] then he went up on a mountain
[46:50] all this life of three years that he
[46:52] lived of ministry
[46:54] healing the sick raising the dead doing
[46:56] the different things he was doing
[46:57] listening to god
[47:00] so he takes him up on a mountain and
[47:03] says now hear ye him
[47:05] and brings it to adoption
[47:08] or placing
[47:10] that's what he's got to do to me and you
[47:12] because see our problem is here's our
[47:14] problem in the message we want to go
[47:16] from right here to right here
[47:19] and skip all that in between we want to
[47:22] go from kindergarten to
[47:25] calculus
[47:28] 202 in
[47:30] you know our sophomore year in college
[47:32] michael it ain't happening buddy sorry
[47:34] ain't that it right
[47:36] man calculus was hard for me all of
[47:39] those stuff was easy but calculus all
[47:40] them other oh man so anyway but you know
[47:43] what i had to learn
[47:45] if i took my courses like i was supposed
[47:47] to take them then i'd understand it
[47:48] later on
[47:50] you must be born again so please to
[47:51] dwell then everybody don't want to
[47:59] lord i need patience
[48:01] lord i need virtue i need knowledge
[48:07] i just want to get right here well if my
[48:09] boss is mad at me at me i'll just zap
[48:11] him right out of the distance
[48:14] i'll make his car blow up
[48:16] because i don't like him i hate him whoa
[48:21] we need some temperance number one
[48:24] and then we need some paces number two
[48:26] and you surely don't present any
[48:28] godliness in that scenario
[48:33] that's okay
[48:35] i'll ask you a question
[48:37] be honest with me
[48:38] you don't raise your hand
[48:41] how many of you
[48:43] are working at a job that you worked
[48:44] when you weren't born again
[48:47] and now you're working in the same job
[48:48] now you're born again
[48:50] how do you react i don't mean the same
[48:52] job physically in the same building but
[48:54] say you were
[48:56] say i work for the post office
[48:58] and then i got born again
[49:00] and then i still work for the post
[49:02] office
[49:03] is there something different
[49:05] do you handle things different
[49:08] you better have
[49:10] because if you're still if they still
[49:12] think you're that same old person
[49:18] you're not born again
[49:20] you got you got to get in line you got
[49:21] to get in the line
[49:23] here's the lineup
[49:27] you must be born again
[49:29] god pleased to dwell in you
[49:32] obedience come to church read your bible
[49:35] pray say god help that preacher that's
[49:37] going to preach to me today how many of
[49:38] you did that this morning don't raise
[49:39] your hand i don't want you embarrassed
[49:42] listen folks a lot of y'all just come to
[49:44] church just because you want to come to
[49:46] church
[49:47] now some of y'all don't come to church
[49:49] half the time but that's okay
[49:51] you'll learn somewhere
[49:54] if you get born again you'll want to be
[49:56] here
[49:57] okay you don't have to preach about it
[49:59] you want to be here
[50:02] but look don't try to be a witness
[50:07] when you're still in kindergarten
[50:09] okay
[50:11] you got to become a son and we'll talk
[50:12] about just a second
[50:14] obedience
[50:16] my whole life
[50:18] your whole life is built on obedience
[50:22] right right you get out today and when i
[50:24] say dismissed you're going to go out
[50:26] that door right there most of you
[50:29] right but you're not going to get up and
[50:30] leave until i dismiss
[50:33] that's obedience
[50:34] then you're going to go downstairs and
[50:36] you're not going to eat somebody else's
[50:38] food well unless you me and sister
[50:39] cleaner
[50:41] you go
[50:44] but you're not gonna go over there and
[50:45] set the table and start eating my
[50:46] hamburger
[50:47] what you've learned something you'll be
[50:49] obedient you're gonna get your hand
[50:51] slapped
[50:53] god's going to slap your hand every once
[50:54] in a while right
[50:56] but now what's a little kid going to do
[50:57] one of them little kids will go like wow
[50:59] cheeseburger
[51:01] don't ask who it is they're just going
[51:02] to grab it why because
[51:04] they may be a son
[51:06] but they learned
[51:07] by the things they suffered
[51:12] obedience
[51:13] you go get in your car and guess what
[51:15] you're obedient to the laws of the land
[51:19] amen
[51:20] you stop at that stop time because what
[51:22] that's what you're obedient so see we've
[51:24] learned obedience
[51:27] in the world so now let's take that
[51:28] obedience and learn it from god
[51:32] to get into the not to get into the do's
[51:34] and don'ts of the old testament we'll
[51:35] get into it just a second
[51:37] but it's a love affair now
[51:40] listen jim cooks me dinner because she
[51:42] wants to
[51:44] a lot of times i don't want anything to
[51:45] eat but she's
[51:47] please eat you know i'll fix it see
[51:49] that's a love affair that's not a
[51:51] listen sisters and brothers if y'all
[51:53] have to get up and
[51:54] have to make somebody do something
[51:57] god bless you
[51:59] no god help you yes
[52:01] right god help you
[52:03] but see we learn obedience though then
[52:06] what does god do god says okay now i
[52:09] wrote the check
[52:10] see i got the checkbook god said i got
[52:12] the checkbook and i'm going to write a
[52:14] check as brother brother would always
[52:16] say bank of heaven
[52:20] you got a daddy now because you've been
[52:22] born into the family so you're connected
[52:24] to the inheritance we're going to read
[52:26] it in just a minute you're connected to
[52:28] the inheritance nobody got that
[52:31] all right once you're connected to the
[52:33] inheritance you get a check but it's
[52:35] already written because you don't know
[52:36] what to write it for
[52:38] come on
[52:40] and you might write it for a million
[52:41] dollars and you ain't got two dollars in
[52:43] the bank
[52:44] but if god writes it for a million
[52:46] dollars
[52:48] signs the check and hands it to you you
[52:50] can go to the bank with it
[52:53] healing
[52:54] same way deliverance same way salvation
[52:57] same way
[52:58] amen amen but now when you come down to
[53:00] here
[53:02] that's what we got to get to
[53:05] he hands you the blank check
[53:07] then he knows you're not going to write
[53:09] it for a million if you've only got two
[53:11] dollars in the bank
[53:13] because you've been obedient you've been
[53:15] taught
[53:17] you've been taught to ask
[53:19] and you shall receive
[53:22] here you him
[53:24] it's where we're coming to
[53:26] the part of adoption
[53:30] and then
[53:32] now don't get me wrong
[53:34] i got the seals way down here i to me
[53:37] that's the opening to you not when
[53:39] excuse me not when somebody preaches
[53:41] them or not when you
[53:43] sit down and you want to listen to the
[53:45] 60-something tapes that brother dale
[53:46] preached in 1982 which you should
[53:49] if you want to understand the seals
[53:52] but see you're listening to them up here
[53:55] but the culmination of the seals is when
[53:57] we leave this place
[53:59] it bounces
[54:01] full
[54:02] full
[54:03] redemption
[54:06] the opening of the seventh seal is
[54:07] christ is back on earth again where in
[54:10] his bride
[54:12] because he's not coming
[54:14] he's already hearing me and you
[54:16] but we've got to understand that what
[54:18] we've got to become obedient
[54:22] by the statue of a perfect man by
[54:24] listening to a prophet apostle prophet
[54:26] pastor's teachers and evangelists for
[54:28] the perfecting of the saints for the
[54:30] edifying of the body so that's the order
[54:34] are they okay with that
[54:37] that's the order
[54:41] i want to read this quote here what
[54:42] visions are in 1956
[54:45] we read this the other day
[54:48] and from then on
[54:49] down it's been a day where the light
[54:51] went out the bread
[54:53] and it's been a daylight enough that you
[54:55] could see that jesus was the son of god
[54:57] you should repent
[55:03] this is my beloved son in whom i'm
[55:04] pleased to dwell
[55:06] he he was as pleased to dwell in martin
[55:08] luther sitting at a beer sitting at a
[55:10] pub drinking beer smoking a pot
[55:14] because martin luther said to just shall
[55:15] live by faith i am protesting what's
[55:17] going on in the religious world and god
[55:20] said i'm going to use that right
[55:22] now the other things
[55:24] wesley what he did away with that
[55:26] pentecost the gifts came up and then we
[55:29] had the word of god comes everybody okay
[55:30] with that see god works the same way he
[55:32] don't just dump everything on top of you
[55:35] that's why the church ages if you don't
[55:37] read the church age book
[55:39] and get a good understanding of the
[55:41] church ages and how god walked through
[55:42] the church ages you might as well not
[55:44] read the seal book
[55:46] because you're not going to understand
[55:47] it
[55:51] see daylight enough that you could see
[55:53] that jesus was the son of god you should
[55:55] repent but the real bright light
[56:04] the real bright light
[56:07] i'm telling you what the prophet said
[56:08] you can read it for yourself
[56:10] but the real bright light of the holy
[56:12] ghost has never shined through these
[56:14] ages
[56:16] wow
[56:18] it took a profit to say that how mean
[56:20] you going to say that no a prophet told
[56:22] us that
[56:24] certainly the bible said it wouldn't as
[56:25] the prophet said it wouldn't just assure
[56:27] he said they couldn't believe because
[56:28] isaiah said there hasn't been light
[56:30] remember there'll be light in the
[56:32] evening time
[56:33] that's been enough light to know that
[56:35] you ought to do right and wrong
[56:39] that's been enough light now that you
[56:40] believed on resurrection the lord jesus
[56:43] every christian believes that's what
[56:44] it's based on
[56:45] accept him as your personal savior
[56:47] that's what it's based on put your name
[56:49] on the church book and live the good
[56:50] life
[56:51] but as far as signs and wonders and
[56:53] direct ray of the sun shining it hasn't
[56:55] been since pentecost and that was in
[56:57] 1906 that was
[57:00] 80 30.
[57:02] everybody got that
[57:03] i'm just telling you what the prophet of
[57:05] god said so there had to be
[57:08] in the church ages there had to be a
[57:10] growth
[57:11] but no one was there to teach you the
[57:13] growth
[57:15] listen listen luther was not luther
[57:17] wasn't standing in the in the
[57:20] excuse me in the sardisian church age
[57:23] and said i'm the messenger of the sardis
[57:25] and this is my message no
[57:27] he just preached the message
[57:29] that you shall live by faith
[57:31] but it took a prophet of god in the end
[57:33] time
[57:35] to reveal these things put everything
[57:37] together that's why that if if these
[57:40] people that are denying that brother
[57:41] branham was a prophet
[57:43] well folks
[57:46] even in his error he was
[57:48] real good
[57:50] if they say error i'm not saying error
[57:52] i'm just saying he don't have he didn't
[57:54] he didn't preach there now he preached
[57:56] things that wasn't right at one time but
[57:58] see there you go progressive revelation
[58:01] he sits down he sits down in the seals
[58:04] and he sits down and he starts writing
[58:06] the same notes that he was writing when
[58:09] he was preaching the mighty conqueror
[58:12] when the seals wasn't open to him when
[58:14] he was what growing in grace and
[58:16] knowledge
[58:18] and he preached that the white horse
[58:19] rider
[58:20] was the holy ghost
[58:23] conquering the ages conquering this
[58:25] and he's sitting there writing the same
[58:26] thing but now see god
[58:29] has brought him to adoption
[58:33] and god said william branham i've let
[58:36] you do that
[58:38] for a few years
[58:40] for you to learn
[58:41] but today you can't preach that
[58:46] because now
[58:48] it's here ye him time
[58:52] no
[58:53] that man you preached on the white horse
[58:56] is the antichrist
[58:58] remember what brother brown said he said
[58:59] i made a heart would have made a
[59:00] horrible mistake today when the
[59:02] holy ghost had to come into the room
[59:05] and what corrected him on why i'm almost
[59:07] verbatim quoting it
[59:08] why brother bryan may come to an
[59:10] adoption he come to a place to where and
[59:13] yeah you're listen
[59:15] from 47 to 65 you're supposed to listen
[59:17] to him okay
[59:19] okay
[59:20] but the real message he had was when the
[59:23] sales broke
[59:25] not in the years of preparation
[59:29] but the trumpet we're supposed to listen
[59:31] to is when the seals open
[59:35] not saying don't listen to rest listen
[59:37] because what is the rest the rest of it
[59:39] is foundation
[59:42] just like me and you foundation wide way
[59:44] down here but all of a sudden
[59:46] you come up to where this is only about
[59:48] seven feet wide
[59:51] see a one two three four five six seven
[59:55] we got a seven seal mystery but what did
[59:57] he say it did though
[59:59] he said it opened the entire
[1:00:03] book
[1:00:05] so now you and me at the opening of the
[1:00:07] seals we can go back down here
[1:00:11] teach it preach
[1:00:12] it talk about it
[1:00:16] and what
[1:00:18] let somebody carry you up
[1:00:20] let somebody what pull you up the
[1:00:22] mountain
[1:00:24] some of us kicking and screaming some of
[1:00:26] us not but
[1:00:27] me kicking and screaming
[1:00:30] so now to
[1:00:31] save time let's go all the way if y'all
[1:00:34] don't mind
[1:00:37] go all the way to
[1:00:40] where it says colossians 1 verse 18. and
[1:00:43] whoever's running it i don't know
[1:00:45] anderson who's running it back there
[1:00:49] okay
[1:00:50] so scroll all the way to colossians 118.
[1:00:53] i want to get to this right here
[1:01:01] let's just look you know we always thank
[1:01:03] you
[1:01:05] we always say that there's three stages
[1:01:08] of grace right
[1:01:09] three stages of your birth justification
[1:01:11] stance catching baptism in the holy
[1:01:12] ghost but we had the prophet come in the
[1:01:14] end time and said there's four
[1:01:16] amen
[1:01:18] there's four
[1:01:19] justifications sanctification baptism in
[1:01:21] the holy ghost and the word open the
[1:01:23] word being revealed all right that's
[1:01:25] what we're coming to so so if y'all some
[1:01:27] of y'all got that written down that i
[1:01:28] wrote down on there it's birth
[1:01:31] growth
[1:01:32] adoption and seals
[1:01:35] which is obedience
[1:01:37] hear you him and headship
[1:01:40] that's what was rejected that little
[1:01:42] part right up there was the opening of
[1:01:44] the seals because christ was the seal he
[1:01:46] preached to myself
[1:01:48] and then he had to what go away because
[1:01:50] no one would understand that part
[1:01:53] they would understand this part
[1:01:55] because listen peter james and john
[1:01:58] had these virtues working in their life
[1:02:00] because ii peter i didn't read it i
[1:02:02] skipped over it peter's one that told
[1:02:04] you how to live that
[1:02:06] add to your faith virtue and your verse
[1:02:08] of knowledge knowledge temperance
[1:02:09] temperance patience and it'll make you
[1:02:13] it will make you
[1:02:17] verse 8. ii peter don't go back to it
[1:02:19] for if these things be in you and abound
[1:02:22] they make you that you shall neither be
[1:02:24] bear nor and fruitful in the knowledge
[1:02:25] of our lord jesus christ maybe that's
[1:02:26] not what we're why we're not getting
[1:02:28] what we're supposed to get
[1:02:32] but he that lacketh these things is
[1:02:34] blind
[1:02:36] and cannot see afar off revelation
[1:02:41] and has forgotten that he was purged
[1:02:44] from his old sin
[1:02:46] so let's go to colossians 1 18.
[1:02:49] he is the head of the body of the church
[1:02:50] who is the beginning the firstborn from
[1:02:52] the dead that in all things he might
[1:02:54] have the preeminence
[1:02:55] for it please the father that him should
[1:02:57] all fullness dwell now right here real
[1:02:59] quick
[1:03:00] let's go to number seven
[1:03:05] the prophet of god tells us
[1:03:08] somebody asked him are you the son of
[1:03:11] man that was questions and answers
[1:03:14] are you the son of man be awake just for
[1:03:16] a minute with me here
[1:03:20] it's coming
[1:03:23] you saw it coming and you still jumped
[1:03:26] quit that
[1:03:28] but the question was are you the son of
[1:03:30] man
[1:03:34] i'm not he
[1:03:36] i'm his servant
[1:03:38] and look this this is kind of brother
[1:03:40] bob this kind of got me a little bit but
[1:03:41] still it's a position
[1:03:44] the pillar of fire's not him
[1:03:48] because a pillar of fire's right here
[1:03:50] listen this son of man is inside of me
[1:03:52] and you and you can't see nothing except
[1:03:54] what me and you do
[1:03:57] you can have a pill of fire all over
[1:03:59] your head and you have it all over your
[1:04:00] body and be the devil
[1:04:02] hello
[1:04:05] but if you got him inside of you you can
[1:04:07] never be the devil
[1:04:11] the pillar of fire is not he
[1:04:14] it's in spirit form
[1:04:16] which was upon the son of man
[1:04:20] has come now to anoint sons of men
[1:04:24] to bring back a ministry just exactly
[1:04:27] like he said it would be
[1:04:29] in order for the head and the rest of
[1:04:31] the body to connect together
[1:04:35] that's a promise
[1:04:37] but look watch
[1:04:39] scroll it up
[1:04:44] i'm gonna read it right here
[1:04:46] the pyramid arena was built we find the
[1:04:48] pyramid they never did get the headstone
[1:04:50] on if you see the pyramids there's a
[1:04:51] flat top on it don't go to a point for
[1:04:53] that top flat top the headstone's yet to
[1:04:56] come
[1:04:59] that's 1964.
[1:05:02] because brother brown knew that when the
[1:05:03] headstone hit listen he'd already
[1:05:04] preached the sale so he knew there was
[1:05:05] somebody going to come to that somebody
[1:05:08] was going to make it to that
[1:05:10] the seven steps in the pyramid we'll go
[1:05:12] through that someday i'd like to show
[1:05:13] you how it really is perfect with a
[1:05:14] scripture and now if you notice on your
[1:05:16] american dollar he talks about the
[1:05:17] dollar scrolling up
[1:05:21] down to here
[1:05:23] when that stone comes
[1:05:26] it'll be a great diamond fitting right
[1:05:28] down in there just perfect we showed you
[1:05:29] the picture of it just perfect with it
[1:05:32] because it's got to be inside of you not
[1:05:34] just laying on top of you it's got to be
[1:05:36] down inside of you it's got to
[1:05:40] husband and wife
[1:05:42] husband and wife
[1:05:44] uniting time where nothing can take you
[1:05:46] apart right
[1:05:48] i want to say this real quick sisters
[1:05:50] and brothers young sisters and brothers
[1:05:54] hold on to your virginity
[1:05:59] that's the greatest thing
[1:06:01] they can't nobody take that away from
[1:06:03] you except some stinking man or your
[1:06:05] beautiful husband
[1:06:07] or wife
[1:06:09] so see god's got to have a bride
[1:06:12] a virtuous
[1:06:14] sinless bride you say oh wait wait i've
[1:06:16] done so much stuff
[1:06:19] hold on
[1:06:21] i'm telling you what god said
[1:06:24] by the transforming power of god
[1:06:26] something happened
[1:06:30] but you girls
[1:06:31] like brother brown said he said you can
[1:06:32] be what forgiven but you can't be
[1:06:34] justified you never go back being a
[1:06:36] virgin again
[1:06:39] ladies and gentlemen that are not now
[1:06:40] sitting in this building
[1:06:42] is that not true
[1:06:44] that's the greatest thing you can do
[1:06:47] is keep yourself and give yourself to
[1:06:50] one man or one woman
[1:06:53] and you and i as the bride of jesus
[1:06:54] christ give ourselves to one man
[1:06:57] and that's jesus christ quit messing
[1:06:59] around with all these other things quit
[1:07:00] messing around with these ideas that we
[1:07:02] got i'm talking about all of us
[1:07:05] i want that diamond not just lay on top
[1:07:07] i want it to drive inside of me so hard
[1:07:09] to you can't pull it apart
[1:07:14] once that head gets on that body you
[1:07:16] can't pull it apart
[1:07:18] but that's what is coming now it what
[1:07:20] brother i'm knew it wasn't then it's
[1:07:22] coming now
[1:07:24] this is when it's going to happen
[1:07:26] now that stone would not fit down on the
[1:07:28] bottom foundation neither it fit on the
[1:07:30] second or the third it only fits on the
[1:07:32] top foundation he's talking about the
[1:07:33] seven churches when the entire building
[1:07:36] has become the fitted fitted the stone
[1:07:38] and jesus cannot come until a church
[1:07:41] a body of believers
[1:07:44] and the ministry that he wants what he
[1:07:47] once had the three and a half year
[1:07:48] ministry of jesus christ
[1:07:50] was there an error in that three and a
[1:07:52] half year ministry of jesus christ
[1:07:54] no sir
[1:07:57] well you don't see it this way and i
[1:07:58] don't see it that way
[1:08:00] it's three and a half or seven or
[1:08:02] there is a truth folks and it's one
[1:08:04] truth
[1:08:06] they ain't three different truths two
[1:08:08] there's not two different truths i like
[1:08:10] what brother brown said brother brown
[1:08:11] said look either you're right and i'm
[1:08:13] wrong or we're both wrong because we
[1:08:15] both can't be right
[1:08:16] think about that
[1:08:19] it only fits the top foundation when the
[1:08:20] entire building has become fitted to the
[1:08:22] stone and jesus cannot come until a
[1:08:24] church a body of believers and the
[1:08:26] ministry that he wants will have to be
[1:08:28] the same as it was what what's he trying
[1:08:31] to say he's stumbling through this but
[1:08:33] it's the same ministry of jesus christ
[1:08:36] the same three and a half minutes your
[1:08:38] message of jesus christ then without us
[1:08:40] cannot be made perfect paul said hebrews
[1:08:42] 11 without us they cannot be perfected
[1:08:45] they must have this ministry
[1:08:48] to raise up the lutheran's western and
[1:08:50] all them down through their ages
[1:08:54] let's read galatians real quick and
[1:08:55] that's what we'll get started on next
[1:08:57] week next sunday
[1:08:58] let's go to galatians 3 verse 18.
[1:09:01] and we'll get to we'll break it down but
[1:09:03] to me this explains everything real
[1:09:05] quick and then musicians come
[1:09:10] all right look for if the inheritance be
[1:09:12] of the law now what is our inheritance
[1:09:15] the baptism of the holy ghost that's our
[1:09:17] promise
[1:09:18] it's the baptism of the holy ghost the
[1:09:19] promise is
[1:09:21] i god am going to give you eternal life
[1:09:26] okay that's the promise promise has been
[1:09:28] all the way since adam
[1:09:30] that's right that's right
[1:09:32] for the and it's our inheritance
[1:09:35] for the inherent if the inheritance be
[1:09:36] of the law
[1:09:38] then it's no more promise
[1:09:40] if you'll do this and don't do that
[1:09:45] no
[1:09:47] no
[1:09:48] but god gave it to abraham by promise
[1:09:51] abraham i don't care what you're going
[1:09:52] to do
[1:09:53] i'm going to give you the promise
[1:09:56] wherefore then serveth the law
[1:10:00] this is paul now
[1:10:01] it was added because of transgression
[1:10:04] listen it had to be added before christ
[1:10:06] came
[1:10:07] so that you could at least have some
[1:10:09] kind of a spiritual rudder you could
[1:10:11] know that you did something wrong know
[1:10:13] you were a sinner know that you need to
[1:10:14] make a sacrifice but you made a
[1:10:16] sacrifice every year for the same
[1:10:18] identical thing
[1:10:21] listen if you're beating yourself up now
[1:10:23] for the same identical thing you
[1:10:26] ask god to forgive you for
[1:10:30] got to start forgiving yourself
[1:10:32] because god's going to say what are you
[1:10:33] talking about
[1:10:35] where'd you get that from
[1:10:37] i think that's way down in that sea they
[1:10:38] call forgetfulness
[1:10:41] wherefore then servant the law it was
[1:10:42] added because of transgressions what
[1:10:45] till the seed
[1:10:46] should come to who the promise was made
[1:10:49] and it was ordained by angels
[1:10:51] in the hands of a mediator
[1:10:56] the old testament the prophets wrote
[1:10:58] about that's this man coming
[1:11:02] now a mediator is not a mediator of one
[1:11:04] but god is one now watch
[1:11:07] is the law then against the promises of
[1:11:09] god god forbid so another stan in other
[1:11:11] words understand this you don't throw
[1:11:13] the law out
[1:11:15] because the law is god
[1:11:17] that's right god said
[1:11:19] there's only one god god said honor your
[1:11:22] father and mother god said that no i
[1:11:24] wasn't the third person said that god
[1:11:25] said that
[1:11:27] it's the law then against the promises
[1:11:28] of god god forbid for if there had been
[1:11:30] a law given which could have given life
[1:11:34] that's why you got to understand there
[1:11:36] was no eternal life given to anybody in
[1:11:38] the old testament except for adam and
[1:11:40] eve
[1:11:44] the blood of bulls and goats couldn't
[1:11:45] take away
[1:11:46] verily righteousness should have been by
[1:11:48] the law in other words jesus wouldn't
[1:11:49] have to come
[1:11:51] the law would have saved you
[1:11:53] but the scripture have concluded all
[1:11:57] i like paul all of you are sinners
[1:12:01] they said right
[1:12:02] that the promise by faith of jesus
[1:12:04] christ that's why that faith is down at
[1:12:06] the bottom
[1:12:08] the faith of jesus christ might be given
[1:12:10] to them that believe
[1:12:12] but before faith came look
[1:12:16] before faith came
[1:12:18] where were we
[1:12:20] we were in the world
[1:12:23] condemned
[1:12:25] by the law of god
[1:12:29] but before faith came we were kept under
[1:12:31] the law
[1:12:32] shut up
[1:12:34] unto the faith which should afterwards
[1:12:36] be revealed
[1:12:38] right
[1:12:41] because that's what's going to condemn
[1:12:42] you is the law
[1:12:43] not just totally the ten commandments
[1:12:45] but the ten commandments are pretty much
[1:12:46] all the law
[1:12:48] but look the law then though when you
[1:12:51] came to christ
[1:12:53] there was a schoolmaster
[1:12:56] wherefore the law was our schoolmaster
[1:12:58] to bring us to christ
[1:13:01] that we might be justified by faith
[1:13:05] but after that faith has come
[1:13:08] you don't need the law to tell you do's
[1:13:10] and don'ts
[1:13:13] like i said before like brother dale's
[1:13:15] always said you sisters you men if you
[1:13:17] get born again you will not do the
[1:13:18] things you used to do
[1:13:22] now if you halfway get there yeah like i
[1:13:25] said before your husband's got to be
[1:13:27] dead not divorced
[1:13:28] because he will always pop his head back
[1:13:30] up right but once you kill him and put
[1:13:32] him in a grave nah he ain't coming back
[1:13:35] but after that faith has come we are no
[1:13:36] longer under schoolmaster we've moved up
[1:13:38] because now look
[1:13:40] you can stop right here paul and we just
[1:13:43] don't need nothing we got the new birth
[1:13:46] but he's not done yet for as many of you
[1:13:48] as have been baptized into christ have
[1:13:50] put on christ
[1:13:52] there is neither jew nor greek there's
[1:13:54] neither bond or free neither male or
[1:13:55] female for you're all one in christ
[1:13:57] jesus
[1:13:59] and if you be christ and you are
[1:14:00] abraham's seed and heirs according to
[1:14:03] the promise now go to the next this is
[1:14:04] the continuation he wrote he comes down
[1:14:06] to galatians four verse one now i say
[1:14:10] see he could have left that up there
[1:14:13] what we just read before you don't need
[1:14:14] a school master anymore in other words
[1:14:16] you just go right on to college
[1:14:19] first grade right on to college
[1:14:21] that's not the way it is
[1:14:24] now i say that the heir
[1:14:27] as long as he's a white
[1:14:28] child
[1:14:33] difference nothing from a servant though
[1:14:35] he'd be lord of all
[1:14:36] but his under tutors and governors he
[1:14:39] does need some more teaching
[1:14:42] he does need to be taught
[1:14:45] but he's under tutors and governors
[1:14:47] until the time appointed of the father
[1:14:50] even so we when we were children
[1:14:54] babies newborn babes that's not a
[1:14:56] problem staying there is the problem
[1:14:58] we're in bondage under the elements of
[1:15:00] the world
[1:15:02] that's okay that was things you know i
[1:15:05] and i try to say well you should never
[1:15:07] do anything that you did in the world
[1:15:09] now that's not totally true you
[1:15:10] understand what i'm saying
[1:15:13] you don't go you don't go to the bar
[1:15:14] anymore you don't go grab the beer out
[1:15:16] of the refrigerator you don't go
[1:15:18] watch this or you
[1:15:20] that's gone but they'll steal some
[1:15:21] things that we humanly do that make
[1:15:23] mistakes you were in bondage under the
[1:15:25] elements of the world look but when the
[1:15:26] fullness
[1:15:28] of the time was come god sent forth his
[1:15:30] son made of a woman made under the law
[1:15:33] to redeem them that were under the law
[1:15:36] that was us we were under the law dead
[1:15:39] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:15:42] sons now watch adoption of sons not
[1:15:44] adoption
[1:15:48] i'mma read it in romans 8 we receive the
[1:15:51] spirit of adoption when you get born
[1:15:52] again you don't receive adoption
[1:15:54] adoption in your new birth is two
[1:15:56] different things totally
[1:15:58] i'll read you the quote next week
[1:16:00] brother brown said your new birth is not
[1:16:01] your adoption
[1:16:02] all right so it's two separate things
[1:16:04] that we might receive the adoption of
[1:16:06] sons in other words you've got to be a
[1:16:07] son first before you can receive the
[1:16:09] adoption
[1:16:11] and because you are sons god has sent
[1:16:13] forth the spirit of his son into your
[1:16:15] heart crying crying
[1:16:18] babies crying daddy daddy
[1:16:20] that's what that means father father
[1:16:22] wherefore there are no more a servant
[1:16:24] but a son
[1:16:26] and if a son than an heir of god
[1:16:29] through christ
[1:16:30] come on musicians
[1:16:33] we'll stop right there
[1:16:35] but look
[1:16:38] it's all a process
[1:16:41] why do you think we've all been here
[1:16:44] some of us been in this message since
[1:16:46] the 60s
[1:16:48] 70s 80s
[1:16:52] and we're in 2022
[1:16:56] 20 22.
[1:17:03] 20 22.
[1:17:07] we were about not wanting about not
[1:17:09] getting to 1972 at one time

[1:17:26] that we grow up let's stand

[1:17:33] formula
