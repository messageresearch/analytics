[7:11] it's not a good thing in that situation
[7:13] but we pray that you would just bless
[7:15] and guide each one have your way now in
[7:17] Jesus name amen
[7:20] amen Revelations 1 1 through3 that we've
[7:24] been reading as always on this part and
[7:28] just trying to speak about the Book of
[7:30] Revelations and to see you know that we
[7:33] can uh gain a little better
[7:35] understanding and hope that the Lord has
[7:37] blessed you with it I've enjoyed it
[7:40] anyway Revelations 1 the revelation of
[7:44] Jesus Christ which God gave unto him to
[7:46] show unto his servants things which most
[7:49] must shortly come to pass and he said
[7:51] and signified it by his Angel unto his
[7:53] servant John who bear record of the word
[7:56] of God and the testimony of Jesus Christ
[7:58] and of all things that he s blessed is
[8:02] he that readeth and they that hear the
[8:03] words of this prophecy and keep those
[8:06] things which are written therein for the
[8:09] time is at hand you may be seated The
[8:11] Lord At His blessing for the reading of
[8:13] the word remember the time is at hand
[8:16] the time to understand the time to
[8:19] understand is here with us and we thank
[8:22] the Lord for that and you know believe
[8:27] that this is the hour that God has given
[8:29] unto us to where we can can read the
[8:34] word and you know see it but not to just
[8:38] see it as
[8:39] we we have been seeing it remember our
[8:42] whole thought is based upon one
[8:45] thing that we were told to stay away
[8:49] from The Book of Revelations because we
[8:50] couldn't understand it but see the devil
[8:52] didn't want us to read it to find out
[8:54] who we are because it shows who we are
[8:57] and where we're at and what's going on
[8:58] and and everything but it took a prophet
[9:01] to come right so then thank God that the
[9:03] prophet came brought the message broke
[9:06] the symbols and spoke to us on these
[9:08] things now we can see ourselves amen and
[9:12] and then seeing ourselves then we can uh
[9:16] you know uh be able to rejoice in the
[9:20] reading of the word and like I've said
[9:22] to you many times to me then the Book of
[9:25] Revelation is really the bride's book
[9:27] amen because it Springs it personally
[9:29] here Peter could say I have a more sure
[9:32] word of Prophecy because he had the
[9:35] baptism of the Holy Ghost but he had
[9:37] been up on the mountain and he had a
[9:38] more sure word by the new birth well see
[9:41] we can say that we have a more sure word
[9:43] amen uh of Prophecy because uh you know
[9:46] prophecy is sitting in order of
[9:48] scriptures so we have a wonderful
[9:50] opportunity to be able to rejoice in the
[9:52] word and see who we are and brother BR
[9:56] said when the bride realizes who she is
[9:59] she be gone amen that's right you be
[10:01] gone that's just what we need to do
[10:03] realize who we are amen and sit back and
[10:06] relax and have a good time and doing it
[10:08] you know and see our day because
[10:10] remember he said arm and devil is not
[10:12] written in the Bible but said what's
[10:14] going on in the day that arm and Nevil
[10:16] is upon the Earth and said that put his
[10:18] name right in the word well all right
[10:20] see then you know we we we rejoice in
[10:23] seeing the word unfold unto us amen all
[10:27] right now we've covered
[10:29] up to and we're over now to uh starting
[10:32] in Revelations 4 and you know we went
[10:36] through the the revelations one by
[10:38] Pastor Church ages because they are
[10:42] self-explanatory uh basically and then
[10:44] getting over into uh the Rapture taking
[10:47] place in Revelations
[10:49] 4:1 the you know John went up as a type
[10:53] and and then from Revelations uh 41 or 4
[10:58] there to 19
[11:00] uh the bride is not
[11:01] seen see because she's up in heaven
[11:04] right then you I said and I've covered
[11:06] it and a review it a lot so you say then
[11:08] well what about Revelation 10:7 well
[11:10] what about it right you better leave it
[11:12] where it's at CU if you don't leave it
[11:14] where it's at you won't have anything to
[11:16] go to Israel right amen you know because
[11:18] from 4 to 19 brother around and said is
[11:20] to
[11:21] Israel so they get this message amen
[11:24] that's right they get this message a
[11:27] wonderful thing see but John says but in
[11:29] the days so he looks back and he sees
[11:32] that hey there's an opportunity for me
[11:34] to take this back to the seven to the
[11:36] church ages cuz he were told to write it
[11:38] to the ages he was told to write it to
[11:41] the book to Roman you know I mean to
[11:43] Rome he was told to write it to the
[11:45] church ages amen you know and then when
[11:48] he did then he says there's a prophet
[11:50] that can be brought so it doesn't move
[11:52] anything it's you don't have to change
[11:54] anything in the word it's perfect amen
[11:57] we just believe it and see it Y and just
[11:59] because we know what's going on doesn't
[12:02] mean that we're
[12:03] there that's the wonderful part of it we
[12:06] can stand here yes in a time element
[12:09] things and see things that'll be on P
[12:12] when we will actually even go into a
[12:14] Rapture and leave out of here and and
[12:17] and all and and see the things of what's
[12:19] happening on Earth because God is Not
[12:21] withholding anything from his bride
[12:23] that's right amen he's allowing her to
[12:25] see the word of God or understand the
[12:28] word of God that's right all right but
[12:31] then we got down to this last uh
[12:34] Wednesday speaking on uh there in
[12:37] Revelations 41 and 2 or 4 1 2 that it
[12:42] was speaking of the throne in
[12:46] heaven but we saw that that Throne had
[12:49] to start on
[12:51] Earth in Jesus Christ
[12:54] right all right
[12:57] then he he could go
[13:00] up into heaven another dimension or
[13:03] whatever you want to call
[13:05] it and and remain
[13:08] there sitting on the throne and it was
[13:12] his father's Throne because he said if
[13:13] you overcome you'll sit with me in my
[13:15] Throne as I've overcome to sit my father
[13:16] in his throne see that was not the
[13:18] Throne of Jesus Christ that'll be in the
[13:20] millennial Reign when it comes down to
[13:23] the throne of Jesus Christ you know the
[13:25] promise of the son of man and the son of
[13:27] David finishing
[13:29] and see then it winds up that the one
[13:31] sitting on the throne is the very
[13:33] Eternal almighty God Amen so we believe
[13:36] in one true and living God not uh well
[13:38] this this is one person and that's
[13:40] another person this no no no it's just
[13:43] one sitting on the thr right but the
[13:46] throne represented the you know the
[13:48] point of where that Jesus Christ was on
[13:50] the earth that was the Throne of God was
[13:53] in the Heart of Jesus Christ yes amen
[13:56] all right then he went up on and you
[13:58] know know ascended and sent the Holy
[14:00] Ghost back on the day of Pentecost
[14:02] setting up the Throne of God in the
[14:04] heart of man amen by the new birth all
[14:07] right now when this matches here then
[14:10] what is
[14:13] dire that's right then we're going to
[14:14] have to go there right I mean it's it's
[14:18] not a a horrible point or a thought or
[14:21] something that can't be comprehended
[14:23] when we match he what God sees we're
[14:25] going die that's where else can you go
[14:28] right you know
[14:29] so then the throne represented the in
[14:32] the heart of mankind but there was one
[14:34] sitting on the
[14:36] throne all right and I kept trying to
[14:38] emphasize to us that we say oh but
[14:42] brother Dale uh you know when I got the
[14:45] new birth I understood and I I just saw
[14:49] one God no no you don't do
[14:54] it exactly that way right you see one
[14:58] God when the prophet brought the word to
[15:00] us right amen you know and then we
[15:03] understand it because he brought it
[15:05] right uh sure I was back there in the
[15:07] Baptist believing in one God and would
[15:09] argue you to death but I only knew how
[15:11] to explain it as God in three persons
[15:13] see because that was what we thought the
[15:16] the the truth was all right but we know
[15:19] that's not true person's personality
[15:21] personality is an individual Etc so then
[15:24] we were trinitarian just like everybody
[15:26] else all right but then when we saw the
[15:29] truth then God is brought to the throne
[15:32] of your heart by Revelation or statue of
[15:36] a perfect man whatever you want to call
[15:38] it uh the basis by Revelation he comes
[15:42] to our Throne we had him dethroned down
[15:44] Through the Ages that's right all right
[15:46] he was off the Throne of of man not that
[15:49] he didn't save people not that he wasn't
[15:51] living in their heart that's but he
[15:53] wasn't in their
[15:54] Revelation cuz they were trinitarians
[15:57] all right but see now we see that he can
[15:59] be restored to the throne amen so we
[16:02] don't see but if we see that there's
[16:05] more than one sitting on the throne we
[16:07] still don't have the Revelation right
[16:09] all right and if we get into all of
[16:11] these uh you know he wouldn't go the
[16:13] River Jordan or two Lords or whatever
[16:15] these things are then you got too many
[16:17] gods sitting on the throne that's right
[16:19] so then you know we need to work on that
[16:22] and uh it's kind of like a man told me
[16:24] at work one day he said you know said
[16:27] well uh I thought you believed in three
[16:29] Gods but I see now you don't said you
[16:31] really believe in two and I said well at
[16:35] least we got rid of one of
[16:37] them so let's keep on going you know but
[16:41] you know but see it's a revelation is
[16:44] what we're looking at amen but if it
[16:47] don't start in our hearts on Earth in
[16:50] the New
[16:51] Birth then there is no heaven for us to
[16:54] go to that's right amen all right see
[16:56] but it starts there and then it be
[16:58] builds here
[17:01] exactly the same scene if you want to
[17:04] call it the same picture uh whatever you
[17:07] want to call it uh that's in heaven will
[17:10] be here on Earth all right but brother R
[17:14] said it's got to be the same Ministry of
[17:16] the Lord Jesus Christ that's right all
[17:19] right see then you say well I just don't
[17:22] see that will open your eyes that's
[17:25] you're looking for something that will
[17:27] never happen you're looking for uh
[17:31] somebody to be able to do what brother R
[17:33] done that was in one man but now I
[17:37] believe that in the bride of Christ
[17:39] around the
[17:40] world is the ministry and manifestation
[17:43] of God that was in brother of RAM and in
[17:46] the Lord Jesus Christ because it was the
[17:48] same Ministry but it's got to be around
[17:50] the world so we only have our part
[17:53] that's right amen it can't be in the
[17:55] fullness in one person anymore right and
[17:59] that's why I don't look for another
[18:00] Prophet to come see to to try to bring
[18:03] it is
[18:04] because it's already been brought by the
[18:06] prophet amen that's right we need the
[18:08] Holy Ghost to reveal it to us all right
[18:10] now are you you following what I'm
[18:12] talking about then yes see then Jesus
[18:17] Christ when he came he paid the
[18:22] price he ascended and he went to the
[18:25] Father Strong right all right now you
[18:27] know we get into all of that of saying
[18:30] he went up there and the Holy Ghost come
[18:32] back we'll read that in a second you
[18:34] know well that's wonderful that's what
[18:35] happened right but don't get it in your
[18:38] mind that there's a dead body laying on
[18:39] the throne
[18:41] right waiting on something to happen
[18:43] that's right I thought he was building
[18:45] us a future
[18:47] home you know that's what I thought I
[18:49] mean oh yeah but see we we we try to
[18:52] limit to our comprehension that's right
[18:56] Revelation has nothing to do with comp
[18:58] comprehension that's right that may
[19:00] sound odd but it doesn't you don't
[19:03] comprehend a revelation Revelation comes
[19:07] and that is the comprehension itself you
[19:10] don't work it up or think it up or plan
[19:12] it up or study it up or whatever it is
[19:15] you do all of that to get a foundation
[19:18] where God can speak to
[19:20] you but if he don't speak it's still
[19:22] this intellect
[19:24] right and it letter Paul said it letter
[19:26] kill it all right but see what we got
[19:28] that far into to looking at the throne
[19:30] in heaven and the one sitting on the
[19:34] throne all right now then we tied it
[19:37] back so I want you to watch this in a
[19:39] little while when we get down to the the
[19:41] rainbow and and and I mean not the
[19:43] rainbow that'll becep the uh
[19:47] uh beginning and the ending and all like
[19:50] that and watch it all TI together as to
[19:53] one thing and some surprises that
[19:56] brother Brandon will actually make make
[19:58] statements that sounds like that are if
[20:01] you try to do it naturally you'll never
[20:03] figure it
[20:04] out but if we take the spiritual
[20:06] application we can see right amen all
[20:09] right that's right so remember this as
[20:10] we're going in cuz this is the hell that
[20:13] Throne is now in the heart of
[20:16] man by the baptism of the Holy Ghost but
[20:19] that does not do
[20:22] away with the throne in heaven that's
[20:24] right right that's right all right the
[20:27] Corporal body is not here right amen all
[20:30] right so
[20:32] somewhere the Corporal body the
[20:34] glorified body we read the
[20:36] minute is waiting for something here to
[20:39] happen to be able to come and he still
[20:41] doesn't set foot on Earth
[20:43] no even though we beat him in the a he
[20:47] don't set on foot on Earth until the
[20:48] millennial rain with the bride that's
[20:50] right amen but see that's what we try to
[20:52] get it all figured out you can't do it
[20:54] that's right can't you study you pray
[20:57] and you ask God to reveal that's right
[20:59] that's right and that's why i' run
[21:01] around him and say I wouldn't preach on
[21:03] hell until it's revealed y i study
[21:06] things for 20 years 30 years would not
[21:08] preach on it why cuz I couldn't see it
[21:11] right I could give you ever quote I
[21:14] could give you every scripture I could
[21:16] have made an intellectual speech I could
[21:19] give you my opinion
[21:21] yeah but what good is in opinion that's
[21:26] right I'd rather have a man with
[21:28] Revelation in all opinions in the world
[21:31] right what is to say in the shortest
[21:34] pencil is better than the longest memory
[21:36] that's right cuz you can write down
[21:38] things and keep it all right but now
[21:40] let's think about
[21:43] it a throne sitting in heaven and I want
[21:45] to just make this clear as we go into it
[21:48] we go ahead brother Anderson
[21:52] then and by the way Brother Anderson got
[21:55] back we didn't feed him to the virus no
[21:59] we didn't even see any of this we didn't
[22:00] see one this time we didn't have any
[22:03] trouble whatsoever that's right and he
[22:04] made it
[22:07] back had a good time seeing some of
[22:10] these that that go out and you know in
[22:13] new and all and and some come and be
[22:15] with us that hadn't before that's really
[22:18] great brother Joe
[22:21] Solace has got the record on the
[22:25] fish but it's the smallest one but
[22:31] he's got the
[22:34] record I said well can you cook them no
[22:37] but you greas a fan with
[22:43] it okay look what the prophet has s a
[22:46] message called Faith 1956
[22:49] 427 uh paragraph or
[22:52] e47 Christ died he become a man see he's
[22:56] backward in his statement but he's
[22:58] talking he become a man all right he
[23:01] took our sins upon himself and went
[23:02] there and was nailed to the cross and
[23:05] his soul was rent from him and cast into
[23:07] hell and God raised him up on the third
[23:10] day for our justification and sent the
[23:12] Holy Ghost back to us and the glorified
[23:16] body of his son sitting on his throne in
[23:20] heaven watch what a type it is there
[23:23] amen a glorified body sitting on the
[23:25] throne so you got to deal with that body
[23:27] y
[23:28] right it's got to be somewhere there's
[23:30] got to be a heaven and that's my
[23:32] emphasis cuz I've heard he preach you
[23:35] know that that people of the message
[23:36] that become so spiritual until they just
[23:39] do away with everything we are the
[23:41] Throne of God there is no throne in
[23:44] heaven where did he get that from he
[23:46] didn't get out of the Bible didn't get
[23:47] out of prophet man he must have got it
[23:50] out of Walmart as you're walking
[23:52] around but listen
[23:55] Church there's a heaven to go to amen
[23:58] amen
[23:59] hallu but what we found the key was we
[24:03] may go up there but one day Heaven's
[24:06] going to leave there and come down here
[24:10] all right that's right going to be a
[24:11] wonderful day in it all right but look
[24:13] what he says now the glorified body of
[24:16] his son is sitting on his throne
[24:21] MH what a wonderful
[24:24] position sitting on the throne
[24:28] all right now
[24:32] listen if it's true that the glorified
[24:34] body is sitting on the throne
[24:37] then why would we want to
[24:40] comprehend PR gods or anything you know
[24:43] when not try to comprehend the the truth
[24:47] to understand the truth right
[24:50] right well when we get up part of Heaven
[24:53] is it going to be a you know a son and a
[24:57] father not Holy Ghost and you
[25:00] know or is it going to be Jesus
[25:05] amen what's it going to be amen well
[25:07] your
[25:08] Oneness that's all
[25:10] right I can at least preach from Genesis
[25:13] to Revelation about it right and I can
[25:15] see him in many forms reveal
[25:19] himself but you'll never get a Oneness
[25:21] to bring the life form of God on Earth
[25:23] to the
[25:24] bright we'll find out ask them no Jesus
[25:28] was the life form of God to a
[25:30] Oneness no sir the bride is the life
[25:33] form of God on the earth me she's the
[25:36] final voice to the final age all right
[25:38] but it's Christ in her right because
[25:41] that's how the throne comes
[25:43] forth that's how we become the Throne of
[25:46] I I got myself cannot be the Throne of
[25:49] God see it takes all the bride of Christ
[25:53] around the world to match that that he's
[25:55] sitting there right I can only speak of
[25:58] it John listen John only typed the
[26:01] Rapture right why did he type it because
[26:04] nobody else didn't go the Rapture didn't
[26:06] come right there is that sensible right
[26:08] amen so he was at top of it he he went
[26:11] over but he come back all right see I
[26:13] just got my
[26:16] part and my part is speaking of what's
[26:18] on the throne but you got to have your
[26:20] part am
[26:22] amen then we got to have it all together
[26:24] right so keep that in mind look at the
[26:26] next one
[26:29] this is the message called discernment
[26:31] Discerning of the body of the Lord 19
[26:33] 58818 812 excuse me U page 19 ready the
[26:41] great light the P of fire is the same
[26:43] one today the holy spirit of God the
[26:46] body of Jesus Christ sits at the right
[26:48] hand of God on his throne in heaven but
[26:51] his spirit is here on Earth completing
[26:53] and finishing his work remember brother
[26:56] Brown said Jesus Jesus did not complete
[26:58] his work when he was here on Earth he
[27:01] said he left something for us to do amen
[27:05] right right something for us to do all
[27:08] right now and that same spirit that Liv
[27:13] in the body of Jesus Christ Was the Same
[27:16] Spirit that was in that
[27:18] angel that come to Sodom and
[27:21] gor because there's only one God do you
[27:25] believe that the same one that followed
[27:27] the children of Israel the same God
[27:32] right many forms many ways of appearing
[27:36] amen but the same God they only time
[27:39] look at the next we'll try to get these
[27:41] three readings out then we'll go Jehovah
[27:44] Gyra part 1 62705 paragraph
[27:48] 166 and God was showing there to Abraham
[27:52] that through his seed that God himself
[27:54] would become flesh and then have to be
[27:57] separated at
[27:59] Calvary I wonder about showing this to
[28:02] there and Abraham typing it all of that
[28:05] was back there where do we get this
[28:06] afternoon of the 24 Elders
[28:10] huh Christ being God on
[28:13] Earth he was separated God tore him
[28:16] apart Royal Seed of Abraham and took the
[28:18] life out of him and raised up the
[28:22] body up to sit on his throne in heaven
[28:26] and sent back the spirit of him upon the
[28:29] church that the church has to have the
[28:32] same same Spirit was in Christ to make
[28:35] it come together making Christ the same
[28:37] yesterday today and forever that's what
[28:39] I love confirm confirmation of the
[28:43] Covenant God confirming the Covenant God
[28:46] separating turning the life from Christ
[28:49] his son taking the spirit out of him as
[28:52] he cut these animals in two standing
[28:55] between the animals you remember what
[28:56] happened to Abraham right you know that
[28:58] he went to sleep he saw the thing he saw
[29:00] hell he saw what he saw the light he saw
[29:02] all the things all
[29:04] right see then if there's only one
[29:08] sitting on the
[29:09] throne why do we want to think of
[29:13] comprehensions of anything of
[29:15] understanding of of some form of
[29:18] trinitarianism or any kind of isms right
[29:22] when we've got the truth about
[29:26] it get over in the church age book and I
[29:29] I had it the other day and I didn't read
[29:30] it where brother around said that how
[29:33] many's on the throne he said one on the
[29:34] throne
[29:37] amen it can't be anything else right but
[29:41] now
[29:42] remember then I'm be asking you a
[29:44] question then we'll get off and
[29:46] going the throne that Jesus Christ went
[29:49] to was the Throne of the father right
[29:53] amen yep right that's Father Strong we
[29:57] gave you them the other
[29:58] night all right now where's the father
[30:02] now if Jesus and the father is not the
[30:05] same God
[30:07] right well brother de you just don't
[30:09] understand the son's up there and the
[30:11] father came back down here well
[30:15] according to my Bible Jesus
[30:17] said you might he said I and my father
[30:20] will come back we'll take up our boat in
[30:22] you
[30:23] amen so where's the father at as the
[30:27] Prophet asked the question of if all
[30:29] power in Heaven and Earth Jesus said
[30:31] after his resurrection given on me he
[30:32] said then if you got another God said
[30:34] he's
[30:35] powerless that was simple statement was
[30:38] it but a gospel truth amen so if you got
[30:41] any form in your mind or thinking of
[30:43] these other doctrines that are floating
[30:45] around then I would consider the truth
[30:48] of trying to find the one true and
[30:49] living God Amen in the correct way and
[30:53] and try to get that one on the throne
[30:56] because what are we going to to match
[30:58] right right you remember matching pieces
[31:02] 10 years ago something like that series
[31:05] on it matching pieces if we don't match
[31:08] if we're not matching here what's there
[31:10] we're not going there amen but when we
[31:13] match what's there we have to go there
[31:15] that's right Martin Luther reach what
[31:16] God saw that he would reach there was
[31:18] nowhere else for him to go right sure he
[31:21] hung around a little while and preached
[31:23] on just on the just you live by
[31:25] faith but he to leave right why because
[31:29] God was through with
[31:31] him but he ain't going to be through
[31:33] with us right he's going to be here in
[31:36] Us in his fullness Amen to take us there
[31:39] when it's a matching so where's the
[31:41] father that's what I was trying to
[31:43] illustrate a moment ago see then the
[31:45] throne was made possible into our hearts
[31:49] right so it's Christ in you the hope of
[31:53] glory living in your heart that's right
[31:55] by the new birth amen and that matches
[31:58] what's in heaven that's right cuz it's
[32:00] just one sitting up there amen and
[32:02] that's Jesus Christ right that's right
[32:05] see now you got your One True Living God
[32:07] in the correct order you're not just
[32:08] talking about Jesus the
[32:11] body anybody knows that can read the the
[32:14] body of Jesus Christ was a creation
[32:17] right amen which mean it wasn't Eternal
[32:20] right that's where it had to be made
[32:21] Eternal in the
[32:23] resurrection but now we have an eternal
[32:25] body laying on the throne
[32:28] M now if the blood of bulls and goats
[32:32] people could be
[32:34] healed what about an eternal
[32:37] sacrifice glorified sacrifice oh I love
[32:40] them Parts amen all right now let's go
[32:43] over and and read a little bit in
[32:46] Revelations 4 now take up our thought
[32:48] and continue
[32:51] on so we've been down through verse one
[32:54] and covering that
[32:58] and then in verse two he said and
[33:00] immediately I was in the spirit and
[33:02] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[33:05] one set on the throne okay we we've
[33:07] covered that coming
[33:09] down and now watch and
[33:11] he that set was to look
[33:15] upon
[33:17] now he is a a personal pronoun right so
[33:22] there has to be someone sitting there
[33:23] right and he that was to he that set was
[33:28] to look
[33:30] upon it doesn't say he's jaspering sard
[33:33] in
[33:34] stone right it's not stoned it's
[33:36] symbolics right right John looks and
[33:41] sees the throne he sees the one sitting
[33:44] on the throne all right
[33:47] now see and the one sitting on the
[33:50] throne was the one to try to help him
[33:53] just understand you know I'll show you
[33:55] things to come he looks he sees the
[33:57] throne like I told you he sees it in
[33:59] stages he sees the throne he could have
[34:02] stopped wrote the book sent it down to
[34:03] the church then continued it and said
[34:07] hey there's one on the
[34:09] throne cuz it was unfolding to John all
[34:12] right keep it unfolding as you're
[34:15] looking now when he looks the one on the
[34:18] throne is the Lord Jesus
[34:22] Christ
[34:24] himself but he's to look upon
[34:28] right he he's he's that's that's the
[34:32] symbolic he's to look
[34:34] upon what as what
[34:39] now as a Jasper's artist
[34:43] huh now on your computers if you start
[34:45] trying to run it in I give you a little
[34:46] help some of you if you're running in
[34:48] don't run in sard sardin sard let me
[34:52] pronounce it the way I read it sometime
[34:53] don't read sardin
[34:55] Stone don't do that in running brother R
[34:59] he always called it
[35:03] Sardis if you run into the Sardine
[35:05] you're only going to get the quote comes
[35:06] in the scripture he doesn't use it that
[35:09] way he he's just more or less breaking
[35:12] the word down that's just a hecky but
[35:14] look a throne was set in heaven and one
[35:17] set on a throne now how does this person
[35:21] the he
[35:23] remember once and he how does this
[35:27] person
[35:29] look now John is going to see a
[35:32] symbolics he knows who it
[35:35] is but he's going to see a symbolics or
[35:38] a
[35:40] symbol so he's to look
[35:44] upon
[35:46] now forgive me for trying to explain
[35:49] something when maybe sometimes it
[35:51] shouldn't need to be or just go and
[35:52] forget it but I I I always like to help
[35:55] everybody if I can amen don't I like to
[35:57] be hit myself and he's to look
[36:00] upon he's described as now
[36:05] watch from where he
[36:10] came I let that float a little
[36:14] bit the symbolics is describing from
[36:17] where he
[36:19] came you know the reason that Abraham is
[36:22] called a
[36:25] Hebrew well it's not a tribe it's not a
[36:29] f it was a word that
[36:33] meant one from the other side of the
[36:36] river so the man sees Abraham coming
[36:39] walking across the river he said hey
[36:42] Abraham you're a
[36:45] Hebrew and was no words back there of
[36:48] Hebrew and stuff like that Jews and that
[36:51] didn't come on until over in Second
[36:53] Kings even the word
[36:55] Jew right
[36:58] but then what so amazing to me is the
[37:00] Bible said I brought your father Abraham
[37:02] from the other side of the
[37:04] flood he did come from over on the other
[37:07] side the Big River didn't he but that's
[37:09] what it means Hebrew means one from the
[37:13] other side where you come from you come
[37:15] from the other side over to here that
[37:17] means you're a
[37:19] Hebrew the man didn't say Abraham a
[37:21] Hebrew he said Abraham you come from the
[37:24] other side of the river right when they
[37:26] wrote it down they wrote Abraham
[37:31] Hebrew see because that was a word
[37:33] interpreted from the other side all
[37:36] right so that's what it's saying
[37:40] here it's telling you of Jasper and
[37:43] sardin
[37:46] stone that's where this man come from
[37:52] MH that would be his origin or beginning
[37:56] amen
[38:00] so now what did John
[38:03] see see if you tried to draw how could
[38:05] you draw that
[38:09] out what you just draw out a stone you
[38:12] no
[38:15] no you know John
[38:19] understood so who
[38:21] is
[38:25] Jasper and who's the sardine
[38:29] stone and you'll see where he come
[38:34] from isn't that the first son of
[38:37] Jacob and the last son of Jacob MH
[38:43] yep all right we'll get to that this
[38:45] evening with the 24 bring it up into
[38:46] that way but think about it where this
[38:49] man come
[38:51] from this man came that he
[38:55] seeing
[38:57] and he looks at him and he
[39:00] says there's
[39:05] man he said let me describe
[39:10] you that he's a
[39:12] Jasper and a sarden stone
[39:17] y showing that he was what was in
[39:21] Jacob the promise coming down right are
[39:25] you listening yes all right get these
[39:27] little things in your mind just that's
[39:29] why to me it's so wonderful we just read
[39:31] Jasper well I know what that is that's
[39:33] that's Ruben and
[39:35] benjam well we're glad we got that
[39:37] straight no that's where this man came
[39:42] from and I don't care how horrible you
[39:45] think about Reuben wouldn't Ruben the
[39:46] one that slept his um father's concubine
[39:53] amen wouldn't Ruben and them the one
[39:55] that are Ruben that tried then later to
[39:58] make amends I guess and tried to save
[40:01] Joseph you know
[40:04] yeah and they wound up selling him
[40:06] instead of killing him right you know
[40:08] all the things all right but get the
[40:11] point this man this one sitting on the
[40:15] throne is to look
[40:20] upon a description of
[40:23] him all right now A description of him
[40:28] so we're going to approach it just a
[40:29] little different than he generally would
[40:31] so let's just go ahead with number four
[40:33] brother because I want you to get this
[40:35] point with it but remember
[40:37] now we'll get through the rainbow round
[40:40] about the throne in a
[40:42] minute so we're going to talk about
[40:44] Alpha and Omega cuz that's what Jasper
[40:47] and sardine was the beginning and the
[40:49] ending of Jacob's children all right
[40:51] we'll get back to that in a minute the
[40:53] Lord will them try it together but I
[40:55] want you to see this because when once
[40:57] we start reading in a minute now listen
[41:00] you're going to hear Brother brandom
[41:03] relating to the rainbow and relating to
[41:06] the a to the Z then you're going to hear
[41:08] him relating to the
[41:10] rainbow and you're going to hear him
[41:13] relating to the church y
[41:18] right see we just want to come up and
[41:21] get up on a throne sit down and it ain't
[41:23] too good of a place in short take a big
[41:25] old throne for all of the Bride down
[41:27] through all the ages to sit on that's
[41:31] right see didn't all we want in the
[41:33] rainbow all right but this means all the
[41:35] way around right well you're going to
[41:39] see something this evening from
[41:41] it and when you see those 24
[41:45] Elders they're around the throne
[41:49] right that's why the throne in heaven
[41:52] can be seen totally in
[41:55] circumference when we're here on Earth
[41:57] you only see half of a rainbow right
[41:59] that's right you can't see it down
[42:01] through the Earth come back around now
[42:04] if you look up in the sky
[42:06] sometime that means ever seen a rainbow
[42:08] around the
[42:11] sun see you're seeing it round about
[42:13] doing that because it's showing because
[42:16] it's up in heaven but watch
[42:18] now he talking about Alpha and Omega and
[42:21] I know that's back over in Revelation
[42:22] like 18 or whatever it is
[42:25] in now Alpha is the a in the Greek
[42:29] letter Omega is the Z in the Greek
[42:31] letter in other words if it was
[42:34] translated today I Am A to
[42:39] Z watch it now who else is
[42:44] this now he's putting back scriptures
[42:47] with it see watch it I am the
[42:50] first I am the
[42:53] last I am from A to Z
[42:57] right right we'll get down to one in a
[43:00] minute and then get down to what people
[43:02] are doing in the message with it and
[43:03] missing
[43:04] it going to the next one number
[43:10] five this is taken from patas Vision uh
[43:13] 124 evening service 1960 paragraph
[43:18] 143 he hears the trumpets and thing
[43:20] saying I am Alpha and Omega the first
[43:22] and the last not announcing of the
[43:25] second part party are the third party
[43:29] amen but the only party
[43:32] amen I am both Alpha and
[43:36] Omega see I've heard people say Jesus
[43:39] was Alpha we Omega that's that's you're
[43:41] getting
[43:42] close but remember when you we a lot you
[43:45] get a problem there right
[43:49] right if you've got the alpha in the
[43:52] Omega you're in the correct order
[43:55] right
[43:56] all right but if you just got an alpha
[43:59] and omega you got us two people right so
[44:03] he'd be one we'd be one you got a
[44:06] problem that's right all come on and
[44:09] watch what he says before I show you in
[44:11] he's the only party before I show you
[44:13] anything I want you to know who I
[44:15] am now that's what Jesus wanted them to
[44:18] know so I drop them down the greatest
[44:20] Revelation is revelation of the godhead
[44:21] the deity right the first thing you have
[44:24] to know is the deity of
[44:26] Christ I am Alpha and Omega I am from A
[44:30] to Z there's no more but
[44:33] me like
[44:34] that I was at the beginning watch I'll
[44:38] be at the
[44:40] end I am he that was which is and shall
[44:43] come the almighty think of it that's
[44:46] what the trumpet said amen
[44:52] now in the message there is a Doctrine
[44:56] of the some people that used to preach
[44:59] it pretty heavily I haven't heard it
[45:00] lately
[45:02] but theyd say see there said he's Alpha
[45:04] and he's Omega and he's nothing in
[45:07] between well there a quote we got
[45:10] it but they point was that he was Alpha
[45:14] and Omega and I've heard it so I don't
[45:18] mind standing here saying he said it
[45:19] right
[45:20] here the man years ago said he's Alpha
[45:23] and he's Omega and said said he said
[45:24] nothing in between you see there Luther
[45:26] and Wesley and them didn't have
[45:30] nothing that's what he
[45:32] said that'll be me in glory any want to
[45:35] argue it but I heard the man say
[45:39] it now his emphasis was that Luther and
[45:43] Wesley and them didn't have anything in
[45:46] Pentecost you know J
[45:50] Street and see then he use this quote
[45:53] right here go ahead and pull it
[45:54] up
[46:00] look number
[46:01] six taken from the
[46:04] Masterpiece go to the next
[46:07] one okay the Masterpiece 705
[46:12] 1964 paragraph 172 173 the Alpha and
[46:16] Omega is the same watch you he said I'm
[46:19] alha and Omega he never said anything in
[46:24] between
[46:26] yep that right quot
[46:29] yep
[46:31] uh-huh I am Alpha and Omega the first in
[46:34] the LI yes sir well brother said
[46:39] it do what brother Brown said it did he
[46:43] that's
[46:48] right see if he's Alpha and
[46:51] Omega that's what I saying if he's Alpha
[46:53] and we Omega you got a problem because
[46:55] you got two two people that's right
[46:57] right but if he's Alpha and
[47:00] Omega there is nothing in between that's
[47:04] right there's not another God to be
[47:06] revealed that's right amen there's
[47:09] nothing in between
[47:13] there he's the same yesterday today and
[47:16] forever right Luther Wesley and him had
[47:19] a new birth for their age right well
[47:23] that was the emphasis the brother made
[47:25] that preached here on it mhm I've heard
[47:28] others beside him preach on
[47:30] it their emphasis was trying to make it
[47:33] to somebody didn't house some now if you
[47:36] read that in what brother R was saying
[47:39] you
[47:39] know he never said anything in between
[47:42] that's
[47:44] right cuz there's not another God in
[47:50] between he didn't say there ain't
[47:52] nothing in
[47:54] between
[47:57] he say see the first Ministry now what's
[48:00] he talking about right that's it the
[48:02] first Ministry in the Life Ministry
[48:04] that's right amen that's what he's
[48:06] talking about okay we're right now we
[48:08] know what we're talking about the first
[48:10] Ministry with the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[48:13] put it in the early church yes the
[48:16] alpha y bring it back in the end times
[48:19] through the prophet's Ministry you got
[48:21] the same Ministry Jesus Christ had now
[48:23] down through there they had the ministry
[48:25] of Christ right but not into
[48:27] manifestation through the opening of the
[48:29] word as it is in the Alpha and the Omega
[48:32] so he's right the first Ministry and
[48:35] Life Ministry is a sign the first
[48:37] message and the second life message is a
[48:40] sign I'm I was in Alpha I'm in Omega
[48:45] there'll be a day that won't be called
[48:48] day or night but in the evening time it
[48:51] shall be light see Alpha and Omega it's
[48:53] become the first and the light oh my
[48:57] brethren we come can stay for hours do
[48:59] you understand
[49:01] that he's not saying that there's
[49:03] nothing down between
[49:06] there because you better get some of
[49:08] your drawings correctly if you going to
[49:10] try to draw
[49:11] something cuz according to my
[49:13] understanding reading in Revelation
[49:16] 1113 this son of man that said one like
[49:18] unto the son of man said is standing in
[49:21] the
[49:21] midst of the seven golden
[49:24] candlesticks
[49:26] now if we're going to interpret words
[49:28] Miss means
[49:29] middle but if you're going to interpret
[49:31] that wrongly you'll put him more in the
[49:34] Dark Ages than he is here which he was
[49:37] as far as giving his life in the
[49:40] church but not in the message wise right
[49:44] no everybody understand amen you say
[49:47] well that's that's we don't understand
[49:48] that that's not vital why is it not
[49:51] vital I just covered about three things
[49:53] that shows you where this very vital to
[49:56] understand
[49:57] right CU if you think that Luther and
[50:00] wesle him didn't have anything where is
[50:02] your foundation to stand
[50:04] on and if you draw out the candlesticks
[50:06] that you're looking at right here in the
[50:09] bottom of the pull pit
[50:12] part and if he's in the
[50:15] midst that means he's in the
[50:19] middle all right now you know what that
[50:21] means if he's Hebrews 13:8 he's the same
[50:24] in every Church
[50:26] amen that's why it means missed he's in
[50:29] ever Church a that's right right that's
[50:31] correct now see that way then we can
[50:33] come out with understanding to where we
[50:36] can see that the first Ministry and the
[50:38] last Ministry is the same
[50:41] amen get the next one then we'll go to
[50:44] our
[50:45] point the Philadelphian Church age 1210
[50:48] 1960 paragraph
[50:50] 135 he said I'm Alpha and Omega in other
[50:53] words I'll be Supreme in the first M
[50:57] watch I'll be Supreme in the last
[51:00] wonderful right his ministry with d his
[51:03] ministry of here wonderful as long as
[51:07] you don't do away what's in the
[51:09] middle the same Gospel Power that raised
[51:11] up here on the one hand at the East has
[51:15] Shone over and now in the other hand at
[51:18] the West Alpha and
[51:20] Omega I am I I am a and I am Z
[51:27] he's all of it right
[51:30] amen so then that brings Christ into
[51:32] correct understanding
[51:35] right and it restores him to the
[51:38] throne of your
[51:41] Revelation brings him back to the
[51:44] position of seeing it as your Revelation
[51:46] all
[51:47] right now we drop to where we want take
[51:50] the point and that's what I hope that'll
[51:52] help you to see because in our
[51:54] Revelation that we we were just reading
[51:57] he said I am the
[52:00] what what to look upon
[52:03] verse three and he that was
[52:08] set was to look upon he that set was to
[52:11] look upon like Jasper and sarden right
[52:15] amen
[52:18] right yep first son of Jacob last son of
[52:22] Jacob
[52:24] mhm now Joseph is in there
[52:27] right next to the last
[52:29] one and Joseph is more of a perfect type
[52:32] of Christ right right he was more of the
[52:35] Covenant type right he received a coat
[52:38] of many colors from his father that's
[52:40] right the showing that he was a covenant
[52:47] one but see he came from that right
[52:52] Jesus Christ came through all all of
[52:55] those
[52:56] prophets we watch it now we'll get back
[52:59] this even and pick this up more all
[53:01] those prophets was Christ am and brother
[53:05] Brown ties together he said even them
[53:09] Patriarchs as bad as you want to read
[53:11] they done it you can't get much worse
[53:14] than Abraham lying and giving his wife
[53:16] away a couple of times or
[53:18] whatever and then Isaac coming along
[53:20] beating his daddy and doing the same
[53:22] thing right you can't put it on any kind
[53:25] of lineage like that you're putting it
[53:27] on the spiritual lineage that was in
[53:30] representation to come down through
[53:32] those Joseph was not Jesus Christ he was
[53:37] only used as a type of
[53:41] Christ he was given the coat of many
[53:44] colors he was raised up and done but he
[53:46] had a flaw remember
[53:48] right he told his daddy he said them
[53:50] Egyptians don't like sheep birders and
[53:53] when you get down there I said you tell
[53:54] them your a h her
[53:56] yeah you know cattle yeah let them think
[54:00] you're cattle hder one they would have
[54:02] been able to hurt a blatant of the sheep
[54:04] coming over the hills but you know but
[54:07] listen Jasper and sarden stone right
[54:12] amen go ahead and pull up number eight
[54:17] brother remember the point now this is
[54:21] where the one on the throne is coming
[54:24] from
[54:25] the Covenant the promise right and there
[54:28] he was standing there what and he was to
[54:31] look upon as Jasper and Sardis Stone
[54:33] what was
[54:34] Jasper was Ruben Stone what was arst
[54:38] Benjamin the Reuben was the Jasper right
[54:41] artist was the Benjamin the first in the
[54:44] last he was to look upon as the first in
[54:46] the last and a rainbow around his
[54:54] head
[54:55] somebody read that next
[55:03] part now that's not mentioned the word
[55:06] revelation 4
[55:11] right it's not mentioned in Revelations
[55:13] 4 about the seven golden
[55:16] Candlestick what is your Prophet
[55:24] doing no on they showing how to all ties
[55:26] together right listen
[55:30] church if you see one one little flicker
[55:34] of understanding of Jesus
[55:37] Christ and really believe that he's the
[55:39] same yesterday today and
[55:41] forever you have the capability of
[55:44] understanding all the whole the whole
[55:48] pillar fire if you just got a little
[55:51] flicker CU if you can see a little
[55:53] flicker you can see the whole thing
[55:56] right and brother random is not in
[55:59] Revelation 4 right Candlestick is not in
[56:01] Revelation 4 but he's reading it just
[56:03] like he said Revelations 4

[58:37] um by himself some hunting and he saw
[58:41] the rainbow you know in the uh you
[58:43] remember the squirrel and the chip and
[58:45] and all I think was in that part he saw
[58:47] the
[58:47] rainbow then I happen to think again
[58:50] that when John on the aisle of patmas
[58:51] turned around and seen this seen J Jesus
[58:55] sitting there to look on as a rainbow is
[58:58] Sardis and jasper stone which was a
[59:00] Ruben and Benjamin the first and the he
[59:02] which is and which is shall come Roo and
[59:06] offspring of David the morning star and
[59:09] over him was a rainbow with the seven
[59:13] golden
[59:14] candlesticks meaning that he had a
[59:18] covenant for the seven Life Church
[59:23] ages now where did the lamb come
[59:29] from to take the
[59:33] book from the throne that's right really
[59:37] brother R is technically because it says
[59:39] it's behind the throne that's just the
[59:41] way I'm
[59:42] saying he walks around takes the book
[59:44] from the hand one sitting on the throne
[59:45] climbs up and sits down that's a
[59:47] revelation
[59:49] right he said it becomes the one on the
[59:52] throne the church you think think that
[59:55] I'm what I'm doing and that's exactly
[59:57] what I'm doing I'm on the godhead I've
[1:00:00] been on the godhead for 40 something
[1:00:03] years right amen all of my preaching is
[1:00:06] on the godhead whether it's marriage and
[1:00:09] divorce serpent seed um things that are
[1:00:12] to be uh matching pieces I'm preaching
[1:00:16] on the godhead but I'm trying my best if
[1:00:18] you and I to see the godhead
[1:00:21] correctly right and when we see it
[1:00:23] correctly we're going to see who we
[1:00:26] are brother R said quot he is not
[1:00:31] complete without
[1:00:34] you yes
[1:00:37] Lord the bride quote is part of the
[1:00:41] mystery amen and must be revealed that's

[1:01:15] rainbow sign in Revelation 2 but it's
[1:01:17] really Revelation 4 all
[1:01:19] right because what he said where Jesus
