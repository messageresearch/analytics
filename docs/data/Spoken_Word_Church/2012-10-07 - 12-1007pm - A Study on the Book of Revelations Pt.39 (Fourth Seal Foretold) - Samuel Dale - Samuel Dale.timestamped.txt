[12:21] sister win there lord
[12:22] let everything be all right in jesus
[12:25] name
[12:26] amen revelations
[12:29] one
[12:33] the revelation of jesus christ which god
[12:36] gave unto him to show unto his servant
[12:38] things which must shortly come to christ
[12:40] and he sent and signified it by his
[12:42] angel
[12:43] unto his servant john who by record of
[12:45] the word of god and the testimony of
[12:47] jesus christ
[12:48] and of all things that he saw blessed is
[12:51] he that readeth and they they hear the
[12:53] words of this prophecy
[12:55] and keep those things which are written
[12:57] therein for the time
[12:59] is at hand all right revelations
[13:03] six verse seven and eight and when he
[13:06] had
[13:06] opened the fourth seal i heard the voice
[13:08] of the fourth beast say
[13:10] come and see and i looked and behold a
[13:13] pale horse
[13:15] and his name that set on him was death
[13:17] and hell followed him power was given
[13:20] unto them over the fourth part of the
[13:22] earth
[13:23] to kill with the sword and with hunger
[13:25] and with death
[13:26] and with the beast of the earth he may
[13:29] be seated the lord
[13:30] is blessing to the reading of the word
[13:34] now i want to try to
[13:38] uh finish up on this
[13:41] fourth seal if we can today and move on
[13:43] to the fifth and all going on
[13:46] trying to but we'll see how it works out
[13:51] so just remember that we've spent a lot
[13:53] of time proving
[13:55] over the periods of time that you know
[13:58] for 40 something years we've been
[14:00] talking about it that
[14:02] the actual happening under the seals as
[14:05] far as the
[14:06] things taking place when it's brought to
[14:09] a finality
[14:11] is really brought over into a period of
[14:14] time after the rapture of the church
[14:16] the bride goes up in revelations 4 1 and
[14:19] not seen until 1921
[14:22] and that's coming back with jesus christ
[14:25] so
[14:25] then believing it then it's not in our
[14:27] day
[14:29] is we proved it over and over paragraph
[14:31] 194 we won't pull these up yet brother
[14:34] anderson but
[14:38] we'll start probably about the number
[14:43] we'll start on number four with you with
[14:45] your notes save him some
[14:47] time of pulling up but anyhow it's not
[14:49] in our day
[14:51] this is the time of the the prophet as
[14:54] he said on paragraph 194 there this is
[14:57] not in our day but it's the seal
[14:59] foretold
[15:00] amen the seal foretold
[15:04] now an example of that is taken in
[15:07] acts uh there in the scriptures where it
[15:10] says
[15:11] acts 3 and 24 yea and all the prophets
[15:14] from samuel and those that follow after
[15:17] as many as have spoken have likewise
[15:21] foretold of these days
[15:25] now all the way through the bible it's
[15:28] been a foretelling
[15:30] or a getting forth first you know
[15:33] bringing it forward letting us know
[15:35] what to expect and what to be and and
[15:37] where
[15:38] we're at and that way then the prophet
[15:40] in this day
[15:41] would be telling us what because he says
[15:44] our paragraph
[15:45] 194 this is the seal foretold
[15:48] in other words for telling us what these
[15:51] things are going to be
[15:52] that even though we're not going to be
[15:54] there it's going to be
[15:57] something that will be passed to us but
[15:59] we can see what leads up to it
[16:02] i've tried to get you to see those
[16:04] things you know like
[16:06] the white horse rider starting in
[16:07] genesis
[16:09] and riding through the red horsemen when
[16:12] kane killed an abort
[16:13] writing through the bible black horse
[16:16] coming through the darkness and the
[16:18] horrible things that are there
[16:20] and coming out to this pale horse which
[16:23] would be
[16:23] death you know and coming forth in our
[16:25] day and it you we can see it unfold
[16:29] our foretold right that's the title more
[16:32] of the message of the fourth seal
[16:33] foretold
[16:34] all right and as it's doing it's letting
[16:37] us know
[16:38] because we're seeing that the seals
[16:40] reveal what has been
[16:41] what it is and what will be you know all
[16:44] right
[16:45] then it's a revelation of jesus christ
[16:48] because he's the same yesterday today
[16:50] and forever and satan's not
[16:53] so we're trying to reveal jesus christ
[16:56] right through the opening of the word is
[16:58] what the purpose of doing
[17:00] and by doing that then it is
[17:04] exposing satan and his right and his
[17:07] doings and
[17:08] and the things that he's been been you
[17:11] know
[17:12] uh doing down through the time so then
[17:14] the word foretold
[17:16] is to show before foretell
[17:20] have noticed before or listen to this
[17:23] one to announce before
[17:26] that a thing will be
[17:29] of prophecies pre-announcement
[17:33] in the sense of to promise
[17:36] all right foretold now so we see that
[17:40] it's foretold
[17:41] unto us the things that would happen by
[17:44] looking back through the bible right
[17:46] and seeing as it unfolds down through
[17:48] and these seals coming down
[17:50] but then the actual part of the seal
[17:52] that's really the finish is
[17:54] armageddon as we'll get to it a little
[17:55] bit which is in the tribulation period
[17:58] and we
[17:58] certainly don't go there until we go on
[18:01] a rapture
[18:02] but now it's going to be interesting a
[18:03] little bit because we're going to cover
[18:05] this on a two-fold thing and we'll lay
[18:08] down just a little background
[18:10] and we'll see that that we've actually
[18:12] we can see it unfolding
[18:15] because there's actually a spiritual
[18:17] battle of armageddon
[18:18] going on right now the literal battle
[18:21] will be in the tribulation after we get
[18:23] out of here
[18:24] but there's a spiritual battle which is
[18:26] in our minds
[18:27] and that was what i was trying to bring
[18:29] this morning right to point c
[18:30] to to deal with satan he's bombarding
[18:34] these
[18:35] our minds he he's bringing it to a place
[18:38] and
[18:39] and you know and sometimes i mean i have
[18:42] to admit it i hope you do
[18:43] that sometimes he bombards my mind so
[18:46] much so
[18:46] i can't even think straight you know i
[18:49] mean i can't
[18:50] can't do it i have to stop and pray and
[18:53] say now satan get out of here you know
[18:55] just everything's coming in even even if
[18:58] it wouldn't be bad
[18:59] but you know if he can't get you to
[19:03] think bad thoughts
[19:04] he'll just get you to like good thoughts
[19:07] you know
[19:08] you know her plan things or do something
[19:10] right anything to entertain your mind
[19:13] and that was
[19:14] what i was trying to get across this
[19:15] morning to see
[19:17] that's what is death and sickly
[19:20] is that satan has the ability to work
[19:23] through our minds
[19:25] and to cause us to think wrong causes us
[19:28] to get all
[19:29] muddled up in the world and he's trying
[19:31] to keep us entertained
[19:33] well the way it used to be you know when
[19:35] we was kids we didn't have entertainment
[19:37] i mean you
[19:38] you you could you could take a a nail
[19:41] and a
[19:42] stick and drive it together and make a
[19:44] little wheel and run out through the
[19:45] yard and
[19:46] go and make your car or we even made our
[19:50] own
[19:51] wagons out the wheels and everything you
[19:53] know
[19:54] bore a burna hole through them with a
[19:56] with a rod of iron you know and make a
[19:58] wagon and drive it and all kinds of
[20:01] things but
[20:02] see the kids now everything is
[20:04] entertaining
[20:06] you know in school even now you
[20:09] computers
[20:11] everybody's got to be computer you know
[20:14] something about you
[20:14] your your schooling is all tied to
[20:18] it you've got to see this you got to do
[20:20] that you've got to be entertained
[20:22] because that's the world and like i've
[20:24] always said to you i
[20:25] read this one time they say that the
[20:28] reason they're doing it now
[20:29] in the movie industry that your mind
[20:31] only runs so many minutes
[20:34] and keeps pretty well attention so then
[20:36] what you have to do is it runs so long
[20:39] and then it kind of starts dwindling
[20:41] down so you'll notice your
[20:43] your fast action movies they're changing
[20:46] that scene continually
[20:48] because that's keeping your minds and
[20:51] keeping you related to it and
[20:53] controlling you well see that's what
[20:55] satan is trying to do around the world
[20:57] to all of us he's giving you things to
[21:01] do
[21:01] right right never have any time i'm
[21:04] looking like her
[21:05] i hope janet's life is because of some
[21:07] of it but i look back there and i think
[21:09] about boyd
[21:10] i've heard him tell you know so she'll
[21:12] get in the bed two or three in the
[21:13] morning now she gets to working all of
[21:15] doing everything you know because it's
[21:18] entertaining it's
[21:19] the world is controlling us you got so
[21:21] many things going on
[21:23] well that's satan's tactic that's right
[21:26] maybe sometimes we need to just sit down
[21:29] and
[21:29] put a real brain on idol you know
[21:33] and just relax a little bit and
[21:36] get away from it all to to be able to uh
[21:40] exist but then when you try to get away
[21:42] from it all what is it
[21:43] all comes with you the biggest problem
[21:46] okay
[21:47] but now this
[21:51] this something foretold
[21:56] god has been unveiling this
[21:59] secret mystery to his bride
[22:02] and that's why the prophet had to be
[22:04] sent as we were bringing this morning
[22:06] that the eagle is the one that calls him
[22:08] death
[22:09] we'll see he said on the first seal he
[22:12] said he's been death all the whole time
[22:15] but see even into him he didn't know it
[22:18] because
[22:19] before the seals would break it he'd
[22:20] come forth in the field and he said
[22:22] i didn't know why i was against that but
[22:25] now i see why
[22:28] and actually because it began to unfold
[22:30] to him
[22:31] to see what death really is and death is
[22:34] not just a dying factor it's a
[22:37] it's a fact sometimes of even living in
[22:39] life
[22:40] because we're a dying generation we're
[22:42] dying people
[22:44] what what's wrong with the world today
[22:46] is there's no more
[22:48] push right to go and do why because
[22:52] we went to the moon we went into the
[22:54] planet see
[22:55] we we run rockets all out into space
[22:59] and there's not a lot to be accomplished
[23:03] right it's already been done so that
[23:06] just puts us in a
[23:08] kind of slow down pace and that becomes
[23:11] deadly
[23:13] because if your enemy's not into
[23:16] something but
[23:17] that's when he begins to to attack you
[23:20] but i i hope that was getting across
[23:22] this morning but
[23:25] but just think about it we as the bride
[23:28] of christ can look back
[23:30] right and see god unfolding this yes
[23:35] and allowing us to be able to see it
[23:38] and then seeing things like if we'll get
[23:40] to it in a minute and
[23:42] we have to see it in like compound
[23:43] meanings
[23:45] you know like satan being kicked out of
[23:48] heaven was he was kicked out in the
[23:50] beginning
[23:52] but yet he's still in heaven so when you
[23:55] come over to revelations 12 he's kicked
[23:57] out again
[23:59] well that's because the bride is went up
[24:02] right in a rapture it's because
[24:05] he'll be kicked out right right see if
[24:07] we can't win this battle
[24:09] over death now that's the whole message
[24:12] this evening
[24:13] if you and i the whole message for all
[24:15] of my life will do it
[24:16] if you and i and i believe you and i are
[24:19] the end time people
[24:21] i believe i'm looking at the end time
[24:22] people i don't i'm not looking for
[24:24] or more generations to come but yet if
[24:26] they have to come then that's fine
[24:29] but i'm looking at the basis of saying
[24:33] well i believe we're winding it down
[24:36] it's coming to an
[24:37] end and if it's coming to an end then
[24:40] you know
[24:41] there's a great battle going on read the
[24:44] message a prophet called the greatest
[24:45] battle ever fought amen
[24:48] he said satan chose man's mind
[24:51] all right god chose his heart and see
[24:54] because
[24:54] of that mind this is all muddled up and
[24:57] everything going
[24:58] but then when god speaks in the heart
[25:02] it just solves all the rest of it right
[25:04] right see that's where revelation is at
[25:06] revelation is not in your head
[25:08] right it has to come through the head
[25:11] but the revelation is in the heart where
[25:14] the word is revealed to us
[25:15] and then that way you know it's finished
[25:19] but if we can't win the battle over
[25:21] death
[25:23] then there's no hope for israel to do it
[25:26] that's right
[25:27] no no i don't mean this wrong about them
[25:30] the 144 000
[25:31] but there will not be the bride right
[25:34] we've been through that
[25:35] right sure they will be the people of
[25:38] god sure they'll receive
[25:40] uh the baptism of the holy ghost
[25:44] they'll have eternal life the other 144
[25:46] 000 yeah
[25:47] but they still won't be the bride
[25:50] so that means the battle is for you and
[25:52] i
[25:54] it's for us to defeat satan all right
[25:57] see then when we defeat satan people
[26:00] when it goes there
[26:02] they'll be able to handle him right
[26:05] they'll be
[26:05] able to conquer him but you and i got to
[26:08] conquer the battle of the mind
[26:11] you know our thoughts and things but but
[26:14] brother dale
[26:15] you're always going off on the preachers
[26:17] in this message
[26:18] they're wonderful i'll agree with you no
[26:20] problems
[26:23] we see goodness is not what's counting
[26:25] today
[26:26] it's whether or not it's the word you
[26:29] remember that's what we ended up this
[26:30] morning
[26:31] death cannot conquer the revealed word
[26:36] there's no way satan can't defeat that
[26:39] word once it's made known to you
[26:41] you can just stand on it and say forget
[26:43] it
[26:46] i don't understand it but i believe it
[26:50] it's a finished product that's right
[26:51] because god has revealed it to you and i
[26:53] all right
[26:54] so then in doing that you can see that
[26:57] what's taking place
[26:58] now right
[27:01] is the most important battle of the
[27:04] entire bible
[27:05] all right that's right you know the
[27:07] bible speaks about those
[27:09] prior to us it says day without us and
[27:12] not make perfect
[27:13] right right but i'm i'm trying to tell
[27:15] you those in the future the 141
[27:17] 000 the thing that there's no hopes if
[27:20] we can't win this battle right
[27:23] and it's a battle over the human mind
[27:25] right
[27:27] because if he can get into that mind and
[27:29] pervert this word
[27:31] it's well so hard against you know
[27:34] people
[27:35] saying things and all right because of
[27:38] this
[27:40] what does it do to people heard a man
[27:43] just recently say that
[27:45] the boy was quoting scripture of it but
[27:48] he said that
[27:50] we have you know a covering for past
[27:53] sins
[27:54] we have a covering for sins we repent
[27:57] for present
[27:58] he said we even have a covering for
[28:00] future sins
[28:02] well that sounds good
[28:06] right that sounds good
[28:10] and he's giving scriptures but i can't
[28:13] help but think
[28:16] that that's exactly the catholic church
[28:18] and what they do right
[28:20] right sure i know the blood of jesus
[28:24] christ
[28:24] atones for all sin yet
[28:28] but if we don't repent amen
[28:32] that's right come on
[28:36] we're gonna have to give an account
[28:37] somewhere
[28:40] come on if that ain't the message come
[28:43] show me all right
[28:45] i thought before sins were remitted then
[28:48] i had to repent
[28:52] if not why not we just forget we just
[28:54] get there by the world
[28:56] we just do it's gift everybody no no i
[29:00] thought repentance is what
[29:01] came and brought the forgiveness of sins
[29:05] right amen i didn't know that i had a
[29:08] future
[29:10] you know covering of my sins all right
[29:12] amen
[29:14] i thought i had to repent well
[29:17] i mean i can't ever be that when i hear
[29:19] it and i'm listening
[29:20] two or three hundred people they're
[29:21] sitting there amen
[29:23] you know i can't get what it does in my
[29:26] heart
[29:28] right well the brother didn't mean
[29:33] all i know is what he's saying that's
[29:35] right all right
[29:38] i ain't capable of understanding what he
[29:40] meant
[29:42] but evidently he meant what he said
[29:43] because he said it three times
[29:46] you know we got a covering for future
[29:49] sins
[29:50] no now go to another one
[29:54] there goes a brother dale
[29:57] becoming arrogant and hateful that's all
[30:00] right i'm sorry
[30:01] but i'm fighting for your soul right
[30:05] in my soul i'm in the greatest battle
[30:09] that has ever been fought and it is in
[30:12] my human mind
[30:13] right well what you need to do you need
[30:16] to get it straightened up and cleaned
[30:17] out
[30:17] that's what i'm trying to do okay
[30:21] i'm trying to do that right
[30:24] but it surely don't work out to bring me
[30:26] false doctrine right
[30:28] and we're talking about the city weeks
[30:30] of daniel see they were talking about
[30:32] progressive revelation progressive
[30:34] revelations not corrective revelation
[30:38] corrective revelation was where brother
[30:39] around was wrong and god corrected it
[30:42] progressive revelation is where brother
[30:44] brown was right
[30:45] but yet there was things that not
[30:47] unfolded to him
[30:48] at that time and it become progressive
[30:52] right but it sounds real good to the
[30:54] human mind
[30:56] but think it over right
[31:00] that's why i'm kind of strong myself
[31:03] i want you to think about what i'm
[31:05] saying right
[31:07] it don't bother me because you don't
[31:09] amen
[31:12] it doesn't because you're
[31:16] thinking are you asleep
[31:21] the doctor told piggy went down or
[31:23] somebody did about it because it
[31:25] wasn't your body heals when you're
[31:28] asleep
[31:29] more than it does when you weigh so if
[31:31] nothing else maybe i've got a healing
[31:33] factor about
[31:34] preaching and you go to sleep and god
[31:36] will heal you
[31:38] okay get your life we're gonna move on
[31:41] all right but now listen the greatest
[31:45] battle ever fought
[31:47] that's right
[31:50] one day will be fought
[31:53] all right now armageddon right all right
[31:57] now that's what i want you to do because
[31:59] i'm going to read in a minute
[32:02] i'm going to read about four pages out
[32:04] of the seal book
[32:06] in continual reading until you
[32:10] you go home and you read it in things
[32:13] but show me anywhere in that fourth seal
[32:16] or even later
[32:18] that brother branham referring to the
[32:20] battle of armageddon
[32:22] that he mentions russia
[32:25] china india
[32:29] or any of those countries i remember we
[32:32] were down to athens years ago and his
[32:33] brother
[32:34] he preached on armageddon he
[32:37] boy he was going with it you know russia
[32:39] coming down here and there's
[32:40] people coming here in this group and
[32:42] after the service brother mo
[32:43] asked him a question said where did
[32:46] brother ryan say them forces come from
[32:48] he said
[32:49] i don't really know
[32:52] but see he was preaching supposed to be
[32:54] the message of the
[32:56] hour telling us what the prophet had to
[32:59] say
[33:01] i'm just asking you to do it read the
[33:04] fourth seal read the field wrong
[33:06] and see if he's telling you about a
[33:08] battle of russia
[33:10] china india this that or the other
[33:12] coming now
[33:14] now we know they will right
[33:17] but he calls them protestants and
[33:22] catholics
[33:25] that's the forces right
[33:28] god looks down we look at as russia
[33:32] coming this way
[33:33] china coming this way you know where we
[33:34] are we're right over here with them
[33:36] you know we're compassionate about
[33:37] jerusalem now all of us are
[33:40] but we all need that minerals and the
[33:42] things that they've got there
[33:44] right but see
[33:48] when god looks down he sees protesters
[33:51] and catholics
[33:52] because every nation in the world today
[33:55] whether it be russia china
[33:57] india whatever they have a religious
[34:00] atmosphere about them
[34:04] right and they're in one category the
[34:06] other protestants are catholics
[34:10] he said well what about all these
[34:11] muslims and all these things
[34:14] you probably find out one of these days
[34:15] it's all controlled by the
[34:18] same fellas they're saying this morning
[34:20] amen
[34:22] when the big head man steps up there is
[34:25] that beast satan incarnate
[34:27] the world will bow in his knees
[34:30] i don't care what country it is i don't
[34:33] care
[34:34] if there are countries that would fight
[34:36] the catholics to death
[34:38] when you tell a man
[34:41] straighten up or we cut off all of your
[34:49] you're all in your things
[34:53] because i can do it
[34:58] amen a country is going to give in right
[35:02] right right because what can they do
[35:06] oh we'll just stand alone
[35:10] that's not it do you understand what my
[35:13] point is
[35:14] the battle of armageddon when it happens
[35:16] in the tribulation period
[35:18] we're done gone when that literal battle
[35:19] takes place
[35:21] all right that's when satan breaks his
[35:23] covenant
[35:25] you know he's got a covenant there and
[35:27] he breaks it
[35:30] in the middle of that last week he
[35:32] breaks that covenant
[35:35] and when he breaks that covenant he
[35:37] stands in the temple of god showing
[35:39] himself to be as
[35:40] god he got control of everybody
[35:45] and how can they argue with it
[35:50] see then it will be a russia coming down
[35:52] with china coming down the people
[35:54] gathering around
[35:55] because they're already right there
[35:58] we are on our own part of it they're on
[36:01] their side
[36:03] but when god looks down he calls it
[36:05] protestants and catholics
[36:06] right i want you to get the point from
[36:10] the seal
[36:13] because it's foretold all the way from
[36:16] genesis
[36:18] to show you that that's that spirit
[36:21] the antichrist
[36:24] coming down until it controls mankind
[36:30] and if it gets controlled then
[36:35] you'll start tightening the strings as
[36:37] we call it
[36:39] until he brings it to the place it will
[36:42] bow down on earth
[36:43] now
[36:47] you say oh but god will be with us
[36:50] god will only be with the bride right
[36:55] right he's not fighting for the world
[36:59] that's right he'll only be in the battle
[37:03] of armageddon
[37:05] in the literal you'll only be with 144
[37:08] 000.
[37:09] right right you won't be with israel as
[37:11] a nation
[37:13] sorry you won't be
[37:16] amen all right see it's a battle
[37:20] battling the human mind
[37:23] you know how the human mind works how
[37:26] can you see people or somebody on the
[37:27] internet especially anyway
[37:29] i've seen that guy put a call drop in
[37:30] his mouth
[37:32] he must not be too good of a preacher
[37:36] but you make up your choice for what it
[37:39] is i don't have to worry about it
[37:40] i just know if i don't put it in there
[37:42] i'm not gonna be able to finish the
[37:43] message
[37:44] well if you had what you think you got
[37:47] i've never said i had anything
[37:51] right i just know what god has got
[37:56] don't worry about the rest of it that's
[37:58] right that's what you're thinking so
[37:59] your mind gets in there so just in case
[38:01] somebody out there hears it that way
[38:03] you just seen you got cut off all right
[38:06] but now let's get on with it
[38:09] we can look back and see ever you know
[38:12] that brother ryan said every
[38:13] denomination was in genesis
[38:17] he said all these doctrines that you
[38:18] have come from genesis
[38:21] that was your seals were told you know
[38:25] leading up to look at all of the battles
[38:28] that's being of mankind
[38:30] right leading up to a drastic battle you
[38:33] know what armageddon means
[38:35] termination of forces that's the
[38:37] interpretation of the word armageddon
[38:40] all right you see it it's never been
[38:43] terminated before
[38:44] right hand that's right but one day
[38:48] there will be a termination of forces
[38:50] when god comes down and ends that battle
[38:52] that's right
[38:55] and see that's where the people of the
[38:56] message get into it look so beautiful
[38:59] and it it it is hard to divide it takes
[39:02] a revelation
[39:04] right because they say well look here
[39:05] brother adam preached the whole fourth
[39:07] seal about you and i
[39:10] yeah sure because that's the main battle
[39:14] as i was saying a moment ago the main
[39:17] battle is right here now
[39:19] whether a bride can overcome satan's
[39:21] tactics in his way
[39:24] and if we don't there is no battle for
[39:27] nobody else
[39:28] that's right literal battles don't mean
[39:32] a thing to god
[39:37] one word and he destroys it all right
[39:41] right that's what i showed one time
[39:42] jordan to a bunch of ministers
[39:44] when we're talking about armageddon and
[39:46] i said who do you think on firearm again
[39:52] well first of all we're gonna ride back
[39:54] with him
[39:55] and we're going to whoop him people
[39:58] you know we're going to wipe them off
[40:01] you better remember we're coming back
[40:03] into the millennium
[40:06] right i'd like for you to show me where
[40:10] we're coming back before the millennium
[40:11] right there
[40:14] because if we're coming back here before
[40:16] the millennium you've got a problem
[40:21] right right but if we're coming back in
[40:23] the millennium
[40:25] then you can see the truth
[40:29] and see by doing it then what i've done
[40:31] i draw it out for some brothers one time
[40:33] because it asked me the question who's
[40:34] fought in the battle of armageddon i
[40:36] said well okay
[40:37] now we got russia we got china we got
[40:40] india we draw all them out and i said
[40:43] all that's the bad guys you know
[40:47] and i said where's the good guys in so
[40:50] we got
[40:50] they're all gathered around israel you
[40:52] know the land of israel
[40:54] jerusalem the land they're gathered
[40:57] around it
[41:00] but remember now that all of israel
[41:03] except 144 thousand is in a covenant
[41:07] with the antichrist right
[41:09] so then i took israel out just took it
[41:11] off the board you know
[41:14] i said because they're the enemy bad guy
[41:16] too right
[41:17] so you got to put them on the side of
[41:19] the bad guys that are gathered around
[41:21] because 144 000 is not going to be
[41:23] killed by
[41:24] russian soldiers they're going to be
[41:26] killed by israeli people
[41:30] because of their stand for the truth
[41:34] listen we'll go ahead i need 144 000.
[41:37] well that'd be great with 144
[41:39] 000 against 7 billion yeah
[41:42] we're going to have to be pretty good
[41:43] fighters it ain't being silly that's
[41:48] just being truthful
[41:50] well then i said okay according to the
[41:51] bible 144
[41:53] 000 are killed before armageddon
[41:56] literally takes place
[41:59] so i just raced out 144 thousand and
[42:02] boy we getting down to some pretty good
[42:05] fighting bill if you think
[42:07] now we got two people against seven
[42:09] billion
[42:13] and i said oh according to the bible the
[42:15] two prophets are killed
[42:16] so erase them out yup i said who's
[42:20] fighting
[42:24] come on accessible i just done a
[42:27] calculation for you or what you call
[42:29] those big
[42:30] words you know to be able to understand
[42:33] it
[42:35] i said what's going to bring armageddon
[42:37] is them two prophets
[42:38] when they stand there with that word
[42:40] that word out of their mouth
[42:43] bring down the plagues up on the earth
[42:46] it don't matter whether they're alive or
[42:48] dead that don't have nothing to do with
[42:50] it
[42:50] you know that this prophet's message the
[42:52] prophet's been gone 40 years
[42:54] and you know what's bringing down these
[42:55] things on the world amen
[42:58] the message he preached 40 years ago in
[43:01] past amen
[43:02] right it's causing because that's what
[43:04] the bible says
[43:06] that's the truth
[43:09] the bible says we're compassed
[43:14] it's watching us fight this battle
[43:18] and we're in that battle part of it but
[43:20] we're not over there in a literal
[43:22] happening
[43:22] right does everybody understand what i'm
[43:26] saying where we can approach it right
[43:28] yes
[43:30] we're not there at the literal battle of
[43:32] armageddon
[43:34] but we are in a spiritual battle
[43:37] a battle of the mind amen that satan has
[43:41] controlled everything
[43:42] right he glide his way right through it
[43:45] and brought it up
[43:47] now let's start with number four and
[43:48] we'll just start from here but that's
[43:49] the basis now somebody on the internet
[43:51] hearing me
[43:52] somebody don't take hearing me please
[43:54] listen to the first part and listen to
[43:55] what i'm saying
[43:58] we're not going to be there in the
[44:00] battle of armageddon but we are in a
[44:02] spiritual battle
[44:03] amen that's taking place today and if we
[44:07] don't win this battle
[44:08] right now and i don't mean win it like
[44:11] we win it
[44:12] that's right brother right no we don't
[44:16] win nothing god don't need you and me
[44:18] whether you like it or not
[44:20] you know well
[44:23] you might find it out
[44:27] we can't do without him you probably
[44:29] said he can put us away anytime he wants
[44:31] to
[44:32] but said you better not try to put him
[44:34] away
[44:36] you want to bring death and finish the
[44:38] whole thing
[44:39] all right so then as we start it now go
[44:41] ahead with number four brother and we'll
[44:42] because we're going into the scriptures
[44:44] is what i want to bring up
[44:45] and what we're talking about because
[44:49] remember we go up in revelation 4 1.
[44:53] right now
[44:56] watch what it says this is taken from
[44:58] the first seal paragraph 361
[45:01] then in revelation 12 9 12 729
[45:04] when satan has cast out the accuser you
[45:07] want to put that down
[45:08] because i want to read it we haven't got
[45:10] time now
[45:12] because it's
[45:15] 15-10 but in revelations 12
[45:19] where they got that word from queen
[45:22] i ain't never heard that you bad my
[45:26] english is and i've never even known
[45:27] that one
[45:28] but in revelations 12 7 through 9
[45:32] satan the spirit the devil which is up
[45:34] there now
[45:35] accuser of our brethren all right the
[45:37] church is taken
[45:38] up right and satan is cast out then the
[45:41] church
[45:42] when the church goes up satan comes down
[45:45] i love that because
[45:46] we're not gonna be up there together he
[45:47] ain't gonna allow that that's
[45:49] ended we win this battle there ain't no
[45:52] place for him up there
[45:55] this is the people that's gonna put him
[45:57] out of heaven if you understand what i'm
[45:58] saying
[45:59] the prophet's emphasizing we go up
[46:03] he comes out the reason he can't stay is
[46:05] because we're gonna be there
[46:07] that's what he thinks of us then satan
[46:09] incarnates himself in the antichrist and
[46:11] called the beast
[46:12] all right so look at the scripture now
[46:15] revelations 12.
[46:19] and there was war in heaven michael and
[46:22] his angels fought against the dragon and
[46:24] the dragon fought in his angels
[46:26] and prevailed not neither was their
[46:27] place found anymore in heaven
[46:30] with their t-h-e-r their place found any
[46:33] more in heaven
[46:36] and the great dragon was cast out the
[46:38] old serpent called the devil and satan
[46:40] which deceiveth the whole world he was
[46:42] cast out into the earth
[46:44] and his angels were cast out with him
[46:46] all right now compound
[46:48] right that was in the beginning
[46:51] that was in the beginning that satan was
[46:53] cast out of heaven right
[46:57] back before time started right the
[46:59] angels and the things were cast out
[47:01] right michael and and lucifer fought it
[47:04] out
[47:04] right and he was cast out all right man
[47:06] now come down to a spiritual
[47:08] all right in time and we go up
[47:13] and he's going to be cast out what about
[47:17] they won't even have a place is that
[47:20] what we're saying is that what the bible
[47:22] said
[47:23] neither was their place found anymore in
[47:25] heaven
[47:27] from that day on satan won't be able to
[47:30] enter heaven to accuse you
[47:31] right
[47:35] he's defeated that's right church if you
[47:37] understand what i mean we're the ones
[47:39] going to defeat it amen
[47:40] right right it's not going to be army's
[47:43] fighting
[47:44] that's why your prod the prophet called
[47:46] it protestants and catholics we'll be
[47:47] down to that
[47:49] but he's cast out
[47:52] there's no place no more why because the
[47:56] bride when she goes up he goes that
[47:58] comes down all right so let's see what
[48:01] happens when this happens and we've read
[48:02] these so paragraph 190 go ahead
[48:05] number six
[48:10] and he becomes an antichrist now it
[48:12] couldn't be antichrist on his spirit
[48:14] didn't he become an antichrist and that
[48:15] spirit took a man that taught the same
[48:17] things that the antichrist spirit was
[48:18] doing
[48:19] and then he become a false prophet to
[48:21] the antichrist spirit
[48:22] now what about when a man in an
[48:24] organization
[48:25] suit yourself i don't know what you
[48:28] think about it
[48:29] but all right that's how blunt the
[48:31] prophet could be
[48:32] what about somebody who would stay in an
[48:34] organization
[48:36] and wouldn't follow the truth okay
[48:39] now finally he becomes a beast now wait
[48:41] we'll get into that in a
[48:43] after a little while after a while see
[48:46] all right now
[48:47] if satan's trinity lays like that satan
[48:49] all the time satan antichrist
[48:51] spirit and christ spirit incarnate false
[48:53] prophet then becomes the beast
[48:55] the when not a demon that was in that
[48:59] antichrist
[49:00] but when satan himself is kicked out he
[49:02] comes down when he becomes
[49:04] incarnate in that man he's kicked out
[49:07] right
[49:08] he takes over the place where the demon
[49:11] was
[49:12] that we were talking a lot ago something
[49:14] about the you say well how does that
[49:16] work
[49:17] all right how does god work
[49:21] remember satan's gonna top ice cream
[49:23] right not a type of top ice cream
[49:25] that's right jesus christ was standing
[49:27] on earth that body wasn't god right
[49:31] that body was a creation but inside of
[49:34] that body dwelt almighty god
[49:36] incarnate right
[49:40] incarnate in a body that was born for
[49:42] that purpose
[49:45] but see satan can't do that
[49:49] he can't create a body to step into it
[49:51] so he has to borrow one like he did he
[49:53] barred the beast in the garden
[49:55] to start the whole thing to go in now he
[49:58] becomes
[49:59] incarnate as the beast
[50:03] in other words that man has become so
[50:05] much to that
[50:07] until that man no longer has anything of
[50:09] his own
[50:12] you ever seen people that were so
[50:14] demon-possessed of things
[50:16] yeah what about adolf hitler that was
[50:18] going to conquer the world
[50:22] and he wasn't even satan incarnate
[50:28] he just wanted a blonde race of people
[50:29] to rule the world
[50:32] you know kind of hard he's hated you
[50:35] anyway
[50:37] but must have been fighting against his
[50:39] own self
[50:41] but now listen satan being kicked out of
[50:44] heaven
[50:45] now we've read this next quote so much
[50:47] until let's just pull them up to the
[50:49] scriptures going up brother to
[50:50] number eight satan being kicked out of
[50:53] heaven
[50:54] revelations 13 1-8 he is incarnate in
[50:57] the person of the beast
[50:59] all right revelations 13. now step on
[51:03] the sound of the sea and saw
[51:04] beast ride up out of the sea having
[51:06] seven heads and ten horns
[51:08] and upon his horns ten crowns upon his
[51:10] heads the name
[51:12] of blasphemy now get the point
[51:16] seal for toad
[51:20] a lot of this
[51:23] was way back under
[51:26] that's your ten kingdoms of daniel
[51:30] right the ten toes and the things still
[51:35] coming down to the end and the beach
[51:37] which i saw was like into a leopard and
[51:39] his feet wears his feet of a bar
[51:40] and his mouth is a mouth of line and the
[51:43] dragon gave him
[51:44] his power and his seat and great
[51:46] authority
[51:48] now watch him and i saw one of his heads
[51:50] that were wounded to death
[51:55] and his deadly wound was healed and all
[51:58] the world wandered
[51:59] at the beast we'll read on the next
[52:03] quote when we get to it just a minute
[52:05] but around said that's when pagan rome
[52:08] became palpatrone
[52:12] that's your wound that was under death
[52:15] pagan rome was destroyed
[52:18] the roman people you know the government
[52:20] the things it was finally destroyed
[52:23] and as it was destroyed it became
[52:25] powerful rome
[52:28] to control so you're looking way back to
[52:30] see something foretold
[52:33] you're looking back to the ten kingdoms
[52:34] of daniel
[52:36] to see something foretold for what's
[52:39] going to take place
[52:41] and they worship the dragon which gave
[52:43] power to the beast
[52:44] and they worship the beast saying who is
[52:47] unto the beast who is able to make war
[52:49] with him
[52:50] now i thought that we believed that the
[52:53] united states was the
[52:55] image to the beast right
[52:58] 13 13 13.
[53:01] i thought we believed that's the way the
[53:03] prophet expressed it
[53:05] so when pagan wrong became papal wrong
[53:08] was when your wound was given to him he
[53:11] got a deadly wound the natural
[53:13] government of rome was destroyed
[53:15] you come over into the papal rome peru
[53:19] now it's not ruling just
[53:20] italy it's ruling the world
[53:24] all right and where are we at going up
[53:26] to the next part everything
[53:28] because that's just part of the
[53:29] scripture that i was given unto him in
[53:32] my house
[53:33] speaking great things and blasphemies
[53:35] and powers given unto him to continue 40
[53:37] in two months
[53:38] yep that's your tribulation
[53:42] see we're the image to the beast
[53:45] nobody can make war against this man
[53:50] in his armies you look at it right now
[53:52] we're trying to
[53:54] police the world
[53:57] and you know we can do it because we
[54:00] have the firepower
[54:02] to destroy a nation that doesn't agree
[54:04] with us
[54:06] that's why we're the image to the beast
[54:09] we're trying now to control the world
[54:11] right who is it why is it that when
[54:13] something comes up that we were supposed
[54:15] to send
[54:15] these uh u.n troops into a place but
[54:18] we're there by way before the u.n troops
[54:20] that ever brought in
[54:23] right because we are the ones with the
[54:26] power
[54:28] the image to the beast right right and
[54:30] he opened his mouth and great
[54:32] blasphemous and
[54:33] and blasphemed his name and his
[54:35] tabernacle and then that dwell in heaven
[54:38] okay because he's cast out
[54:42] sending their blacks demon because he'd
[54:43] been cast out and it was given unto him
[54:45] to make war with the saints and to
[54:47] overcome them and power given unto them
[54:50] of all kindreds and tongues and nations
[54:54] now you tell me i wasn't right this
[54:55] morning you tell me i'm not right now
[54:57] and saying that every government in the
[54:58] world the prophet said
[54:59] it's controlled by the devil do you
[55:01] think they won't all
[55:02] do his bidding
[55:07] i don't care if it's a far country that
[55:09] don't even hardly where was the other
[55:11] day i heard the other day somebody
[55:12] telling it
[55:13] and it might have been over the other
[55:14] night talking about some country or
[55:16] wherever they
[55:17] that the first time they never had that
[55:19] electric lights in that country
[55:24] but that country is controlled by the
[55:26] devil right
[55:29] ain't even got no electrolytes
[55:32] miscontrolled by the devil
[55:34] all that dwell upon the earth shall
[55:36] worship him whose names are not written
[55:39] in the book of life on the lamb slain
[55:41] before the foundational world
[55:44] you say i tell you what so i won't never
[55:46] worship
[55:50] according to the bible if we don't make
[55:52] the rapture
[55:54] we definitely got a problem
[55:57] because we're going to be hunted down
[55:58] and killed because even the foolish
[56:01] virgin is going to be hunted down and
[56:02] killed
[56:03] during the tribulation
[56:08] they'll have to give their life on what
[56:09] they believe are we willing to give out
[56:13] okay let's see if the prophet was
[56:15] writing go ahead with number 10.
[56:19] well we're not our denomination progress
[56:21] 69
[56:23] it's all about the kings five kings and
[56:25] all from the history i'll show you
[56:29] now watch the beast now the beast wasn't
[56:31] a king
[56:33] he was one which is which is not and yet
[56:36] he
[56:36] is and is not and yet he is and is not
[56:40] what is he succession of popes
[56:46] right a power of beast
[56:49] ruling that's when pagan rome was
[56:54] converted to make power wrong
[56:56] pagan rome was converted and then it
[56:58] become the papacy
[56:59] which they had a pope in the state of a
[57:01] king and the pope
[57:03] is the spiritual king that's the reason
[57:05] he's a crown
[57:07] spiritual king claims to be the backer
[57:09] of
[57:10] jesus christ that's who the folk claims
[57:14] to be
[57:14] instead of instead of jesus christ
[57:19] all right go to the next
[57:22] this is taken from the fourth seal of
[57:25] 175
[57:26] and it never did become that way in rome
[57:28] and he's giving you powers over all the
[57:30] nations that's in revelation
[57:32] right we just got to read
[57:36] it never did become that way in rome
[57:38] until pagan rome was converted
[57:40] into papua rome and the catholic power
[57:43] spread the world
[57:44] made the universal catholic church
[57:48] all right are you seeing it yeah now go
[57:50] to one program 195
[57:52] excuse me 194 number 12
[57:56] number number 12.
[57:59] watch what he says now the fourth seal
[58:01] we read this over and over watch rides a
[58:03] pale horse as he appears in his right
[58:05] he's right this last ride he's on his
[58:07] life's
[58:08] his lice now now this is not in our day
[58:12] that will be on down it's the seal
[58:14] foretold
[58:16] because see the church has done gone up
[58:18] when this happens
[58:20] okay now
[58:24] now the battle of armageddon
[58:28] as i said let's start reading in a hurry
[58:33] he said it was the seal of fort cold
[58:37] before it ever takes place right this
[58:40] battle of armageddon started in the
[58:42] garden of eden
[58:45] in the human mind i don't have time to
[58:49] bring all of it to
[58:50] do you're to know it read the greatest
[58:52] battle ever fought
[58:54] and you'll find it what i'm saying the
[58:56] battle began in the garden in the mind
[58:58] of man
[58:59] and he's been battling ever since as a
[59:01] matter of fact this battle began in
[59:03] heaven
[59:04] when satan his angels was cast out so
[59:07] now i covered what are talking about a
[59:08] while ago
[59:09] the compound meaning of revelations were
[59:11] the casting out of the red dragon
[59:13] it was back there before the
[59:14] foundational world now it's done when
[59:16] the bride goes up
[59:20] will be cast out again no place will
[59:23] ever be found for him anymore
[59:25] in heaven he finds his place the lake of
[59:28] fire
[59:29] the beast and the false prophet
[59:32] to show you what god thinks
[59:35] now think with me a second man
[59:39] is to be judged before he goes to perth
[59:42] to
[59:43] hell right
[59:46] but you know the bible says the beast
[59:48] and the false prophet is casting the
[59:50] lack of fire and it doesn't mention
[59:51] giving them a judgment
[59:55] come on preach your bible read your
[59:58] prophet it doesn't
[1:00:00] say that they go to the white throne
[1:00:02] they're just cast i didn't know why
[1:00:04] because they're incarnate there's no
[1:00:07] need of judging them what would you
[1:00:09] judge them for
[1:00:10] they are the devil
[1:00:14] false prophet and him is both cast in
[1:00:16] there
[1:00:17] it says the beast and the false prophet
[1:00:20] what's a false prophet
[1:00:21] was the body human part element of the
[1:00:25] beast that's dwelling within that
[1:00:28] hope you don't even have to be judged
[1:00:33] because he doesn't cast out of heaven
[1:00:35] all right so let's get started on it now
[1:00:37] paragraph 278 number 13.
[1:00:41] these will all be from the fourth seal
[1:00:42] except the last one and then i'll go
[1:00:44] where i'll get to that or not
[1:00:46] paragraph 278 now there'll be a couple
[1:00:48] of little jumps and then you're going to
[1:00:49] start reading the solid
[1:00:50] all the way through what is all this
[1:00:54] coming to we just got about 12 14
[1:00:55] minutes here i guess
[1:00:57] look what this is all coming to now keep
[1:00:59] in mind
[1:01:01] spiritual battle
[1:01:04] finishing with a literal battle you'll
[1:01:07] see why brother brown didn't bring
[1:01:09] russia and china down because when they
[1:01:12] come down they're going to be
[1:01:14] protestants and catholic because we went
[1:01:15] into every country in the world
[1:01:17] with our our protestants and catholics
[1:01:22] now what is it it's going
[1:01:25] right back to the way it did it started
[1:01:28] in heaven
[1:01:29] it's coming to the end time battle the
[1:01:31] first thing in heaven was a battle
[1:01:33] lucifer was kicked out and come to earth
[1:01:35] and then he polluted eden
[1:01:37] then he's been polluting ever since and
[1:01:40] now from the battle in heaven it's
[1:01:41] coming to the battle on earth
[1:01:43] and it's to be fulfilled that on earth
[1:01:46] at the end time
[1:01:47] in a battle called armageddon now anyone
[1:01:51] knows that the
[1:01:52] battle started in heaven holy oh and so
[1:01:55] they kicked them out michael and his
[1:01:57] angels overthrowed them
[1:02:00] just run out and when they did
[1:02:03] drop right down in eden and here started
[1:02:07] the battle
[1:02:07] down here right at number 14. this is
[1:02:11] jumping like a couple of paragraphs to
[1:02:12] this
[1:02:13] same time of reading paragraph 286 85
[1:02:16] excuse me
[1:02:18] now the battle started in heaven to be
[1:02:20] finished on earth in the form of
[1:02:21] armageddon
[1:02:22] now let's watch and see it unfold right
[1:02:27] unfold this armageddon that's going to
[1:02:30] be over there after we leave out of here
[1:02:32] is going to unfold to you and i
[1:02:36] that we can see what's taking place
[1:02:39] maybe we can unfold it and the lord
[1:02:40] helps us right now
[1:02:41] to do this watch it unfold the
[1:02:44] mysterious writer
[1:02:46] watch what he does now opposed refuse to
[1:02:48] repent and go back to the original blood
[1:02:50] word
[1:02:51] the word became blood and flesh see he
[1:02:54] refused to go back to it
[1:02:55] his antichrist the true word bride is
[1:02:58] the
[1:02:58] he's opposed to the true word bride
[1:03:02] takes his own bride he opposes this true
[1:03:05] bride too and he takes his own bride and
[1:03:09] brings her
[1:03:09] in in the form of religion called creeds
[1:03:12] and dogma see
[1:03:14] and now seeing the holy bride
[1:03:18] is against her but he forms his own
[1:03:20] bride
[1:03:21] called antichrist by antichrist teaching
[1:03:24] which is contrary to christ
[1:03:26] see how shrewd he is and now instead
[1:03:30] of having a unity of love and
[1:03:32] controlling
[1:03:34] worship under blood he's got a
[1:03:36] denomination
[1:03:37] instead of having the word he took
[1:03:39] creeds and dogmas and so forth
[1:03:42] number 15. dumpty burger 299.
[1:03:47] what's gathered then now on this

[1:08:30] it and they were talking about
[1:08:31] somewhere overseas some people were
[1:08:33] talking about getting us into world
[1:08:34] council churches

[1:10:54] four corners of hell and on the snow
[1:10:55] white horse he also has a name
[1:10:58] not death but the word of god
[1:11:01] life amen god it wrote right on his toe
[1:11:04] there
[1:11:05] here the word of god that's the only
[1:11:08] life because god is the only source of
[1:11:10] eternal life there is

[1:11:33] what he's saying
[1:11:34] it's going on right now
[1:11:37] see we're not going over to revelation
[1:11:39] 19 as i've said over and over and over
[1:11:41] caught it for
[1:11:41] 40 something years we're not coming down
[1:11:44] with a sword but
[1:11:45] we're going to we're going we're going

[1:11:52] they got tanks
[1:11:55] they got to add them bombs they got all
[1:11:58] kind of things
[1:12:00] i want at least a bb gun
[1:12:06] just showing you how people people are
[1:12:08] stealing this the way they think
[1:12:11] because that's what preachers just makes
[1:12:12] you think they say i i thought we're
[1:12:14] going to come back and fight a battle
[1:12:18] if we win this battle the battle's over
[1:12:21] right
[1:12:21] all right now let's get back to where
[1:12:23] we're at
[1:12:25] he's gathering his what he's got wrote
[1:12:29] life with a white horse and here's a man
[1:12:30] with three different powers mixed up
[1:12:32] called in gathering his earthbound
[1:12:34] delegates and christ is gathering his
[1:12:36] heaven-born subjects saints
[1:12:40] he's got death wrote on him because it's
[1:12:43] got right life wrote on him
[1:12:45] those with him won't buy horses also and
[1:12:47] they're called the chosen before the
[1:12:48] foundational world amen
[1:12:50] they're faithful to the word amen we i
[1:12:52] like that one
[1:12:54] called chosen before the foundational
[1:12:56] world and then faithful to the word of
[1:12:58] their choosing
[1:12:59] all stimulated with new wine and oil
[1:13:02] just riding right along
[1:13:03] coming down to meet him they know the
[1:13:05] thunders
[1:13:07] will issue the thing
[1:13:10] of course pretty soon who's he talking
[1:13:13] about
[1:13:16] who knows the thunders is going to issue
[1:13:18] this lord
[1:13:20] other than you and i
[1:13:23] who knows the thunders has the complete
[1:13:26] revelation of jesus christ
[1:13:28] other than you and i the bride
[1:13:32] so we know the thunders are going to
[1:13:34] issue it forth
[1:13:37] right right but just remember
[1:13:41] if we don't win this battle there won't
[1:13:43] be no victorious right into the
[1:13:45] millennium
[1:13:47] right when we come back on the white
[1:13:51] horses with him we're going into the
[1:13:52] millennium
[1:13:53] that's according to your prophet right
[1:13:56] and he thanks so much of us on daniel 70
[1:13:58] weeks
[1:13:59] he said we are the anointing to the
[1:14:00] temple that will be built in the
[1:14:02] millennium right
[1:14:05] read you daniel sydney williams but
[1:14:07] listen
[1:14:08] and watch how he does it he is the word
[1:14:13] and his name is the word then the word
[1:14:16] is life
[1:14:16] antichrist anything advertise against
[1:14:20] to antis against the christ the word so
[1:14:23] it's gotta be creed our denomination
[1:14:24] which
[1:14:25] is against the word i don't see how
[1:14:28] you're going to miss it
[1:14:29] do you understand how could you miss it
[1:14:31] i don't know how you're going to
[1:14:33] but that's true after crisis against
[1:14:35] isn't that right
[1:14:36] take away from that's what he was he's
[1:14:39] riding his mixed up horse
[1:14:41] we see it right in here in the word of
[1:14:43] god right here in the word of god
[1:14:45] we see it right there in the seven
[1:14:47] churches ages
[1:14:49] here he brings it right back in the
[1:14:51] seals opening up and showing them
[1:14:54] things that went on in the church ages
[1:14:57] and times against the word the why
[1:15:00] creates why we're so against the creeds
[1:15:05] and denominations because they're
[1:15:07] against the word
[1:15:09] all right here we see life and death
[1:15:12] coming to the final struggle
[1:15:17] that's in me and you the white horse of
[1:15:21] true life
[1:15:22] the pale horse of mixed creed you see
[1:15:24] the thing coming to a real showdown
[1:15:27] now i want you i want to say something
[1:15:28] here you might not believe this but
[1:15:30] i looked it up to be sure there's only
[1:15:33] one original color and that's why
[1:15:35] i mean he knows that there's only one
[1:15:36] original color anything else is mixed
[1:15:39] christ is on a solid white unadulterated
[1:15:41] word from the beginning
[1:15:42] amen every color would be white if some
[1:15:45] chemistry hadn't broke
[1:15:47] into it amen glory every church would be
[1:15:49] standing on the
[1:15:50] apostolic doctrine of the word of god
[1:15:53] and god confirming it to be
[1:15:56] confirming it if he didn't have creeds
[1:16:00] and denominations mixed into it now you
[1:16:02] are
[1:16:03] well brother evans i feel good right now
[1:16:05] yes sir yes sir only
[1:16:06] the original color that's why it never
[1:16:09] it never mixed with
[1:16:11] denominations or creeds no sir
[1:16:16] and remember his sights are clothed in
[1:16:18] white robes
[1:16:20] not mixed with denominations of creeds
[1:16:22] then we find out the denomination creep
[1:16:24] here's where you get your mixed color
[1:16:27] because this is the original color he's
[1:16:28] writing
[1:16:29] the original colors on his people and
[1:16:32] they've been dipped into blood that
[1:16:34] cleanse the garment and send it right
[1:16:35] back
[1:16:36] under see that's that's right those
[1:16:38] mixed
[1:16:39] those that mixed turn pale and go to
[1:16:42] death
[1:16:42] it's a perverting per perversion to mix
[1:16:46] colors with white
[1:16:47] you pervert the original color is that
[1:16:49] right if the original
[1:16:51] color only color is white and you mix
[1:16:54] something with it
[1:16:55] you pervert it to real cause amen is
[1:16:58] that right
[1:16:59] and when if he is the white horse
[1:17:02] and he is the word didn't mix anything
[1:17:05] with that any kind of a creed
[1:17:07] add one word to it take one word away
[1:17:10] from it
[1:17:10] it's to pervert the whole thing oh my
[1:17:14] keep me with the word lord truth
[1:17:18] and error oh my no matter
[1:17:22] how good is it truth and era cannot mix
[1:17:26] now listen to it it cannot mix it's
[1:17:29] either the dust set the lord
[1:17:31] or it's wrong no matter what holy father
[1:17:35] said saint benefits are are the
[1:17:38] archbishops of canterbury i don't know
[1:17:41] who
[1:17:42] said it if it's contrary to the word
[1:17:45] it's perversion it won't mix
[1:17:49] and what and somebody evidently put a
[1:17:53] thought up watch him
[1:17:56] say this fella done i don't care what
[1:17:58] he's done how much you holy he
[1:17:59] is or anything like that this is the
[1:18:01] only direct truth that we have
[1:18:03] no church no creed has no creed has no
[1:18:07] truth
[1:18:08] if it's outside of this show me one
[1:18:10] that's got it i want you to tell me
[1:18:12] i'll turn a page in the bible and show
[1:18:14] you something so he said just call
[1:18:16] the one you said pentecost oh my i just
[1:18:19] caught that thought from somebody
[1:18:21] better leave it alone right now because
[1:18:23] i've seen that start at the sore spot
[1:18:25] right there
[1:18:26] i didn't didn't want to hurt you but i
[1:18:28] just wanted you to know
[1:18:30] i know what you were thinking about see
[1:18:34] the word was hard to turn it out right
[1:18:38] those that's mixed turn the antichrist
[1:18:41] to death see
[1:18:42] those that mix turn the antichrist
[1:18:44] anti-deposit
[1:18:46] turns the death color when you mix any
[1:18:48] kind of anything with the original
[1:18:50] it's like christ said about the mustard
[1:18:52] seed it's the smallest of all seed but
[1:18:55] it won't mix with nothing
[1:18:56] mustard won't mix genuine mustard so if
[1:18:59] you just got that
[1:19:00] much of faith just hold to it notice
[1:19:03] life followed him riding on my horses
[1:19:05] it was a word life vindicated by his
[1:19:08] resurrected saints
[1:19:13] now when we come riding back in the
[1:19:14] millennium we
[1:19:16] are going to be the resurrected saints
[1:19:21] not coming in the millennium get
[1:19:22] resurrected
[1:19:24] we just went to a marriage supper and
[1:19:25] coming back vindicated by his
[1:19:27] resurrection and sanctioned with him
[1:19:29] how's the battle going to go jesus said
[1:19:32] he that believeth in me though he were
[1:19:33] dead he actually lived
[1:19:35] do you believe in me though you you were
[1:19:38] dead
[1:19:38] you shall live and whosoever liveth and
[1:19:42] believeth in me shall never die
[1:19:44] again he said he that believes in me he
[1:19:46] will give him eternal life raise him up
[1:19:48] at the last days
[1:19:50] that's the promised scripture much
[1:19:55] here comes satan with all four corners
[1:19:57] of the earth
[1:19:58] with his protestants never anything
[1:20:01] about russia yet
[1:20:04] and with his catholics and all together
[1:20:06] marching right up to the battle of
[1:20:08] armageddon
[1:20:09] all right and here comes jesus down from
[1:20:11] heaven with resurrected saints
[1:20:13] vindicated word
[1:20:19] now i could put a point right in there
[1:20:21] where do you think about it
[1:20:26] you know this battle that's going on now
[1:20:32] in the bride of christ
[1:20:37] you know those is in heaven know about
[1:20:45] and it they come
[1:20:50] they're coming to our aid not physically
[1:20:53] speaking
[1:20:53] right right they don't have to come here
[1:20:56] to do it
[1:20:56] we meet them in the air so don't worry
[1:20:58] about it
[1:21:01] resurrected saints
[1:21:06] they know it's going to issue it forth
[1:21:08] pretty soon
[1:21:12] we're gathered about by the bible says a
[1:21:14] great cloud of witnesses
[1:21:18] and you know in the scripture there the
[1:21:20] prophet used how long
[1:21:22] how long as the bride of christ
[1:21:27] but when you say how long how long to
[1:21:30] avenge
[1:21:31] our blood that was israel
[1:21:36] so you can say how long how long they're
[1:21:38] saying right now how long
[1:21:39] how long they're saying right now come
[1:21:42] on church
[1:21:44] right we're ready the resurrection's
[1:21:47] coming
[1:21:48] all right just drop that little bit in
[1:21:52] as i said if god speaks and sends you he
[1:21:55] he backs what you say he said notice
[1:21:58] if you're an ambassador from heaven all
[1:22:00] heaven is behind you and all heaven
[1:22:02] is consistent of the word i love that
[1:22:05] notice now he's coming with resurrected
[1:22:07] saints
[1:22:08] vindicating his word is true for satan
[1:22:11] knows then the bottomless pit is ready
[1:22:13] for him
[1:22:14] oh my while death robbed a pale horse
[1:22:17] mixed creed and denominations
[1:22:20] and followed him oh my the eternal
[1:22:23] separation
[1:22:24] from god that's where the word he rode
[1:22:27] them to to eternal separation that's
[1:22:30] what the antichrist has done
[1:22:31] christ wrote his church right into glory
[1:22:36] in the resurrection
[1:22:41] battle of armageddon
[1:22:45] spiritually speaking is taking place now
[1:22:48] right the battle in your mind
[1:22:56] satan is trying to pervert it or either
[1:22:59] keep it entertained
[1:23:04] to try to keep us up from believing
[1:23:05] god's word
[1:23:07] he's doing everything he can look at him
[1:23:10] now as he's
[1:23:12] using the preacher's so-called of this
[1:23:14] message
[1:23:16] that some will say brother branham was
[1:23:18] wrong
[1:23:22] some will say he done this wrong he done
[1:23:25] that wrong
[1:23:31] trying to destroy your confidence
[1:23:34] in the message of the hour
[1:23:39] there's your spiritual battle of
[1:23:40] armageddon right and they will be a
[1:23:43] physical one in the tribulation
[1:23:45] after we leave out of here amen but
[1:23:48] it'll be because we won this battle
[1:23:51] before death right
[1:23:56] the death can't get me until god is
[1:23:58] through with me
[1:23:59] i don't worry about it he may cause me a
[1:24:02] lot of problems a lot of struggles a lot
[1:24:04] of heartaches
[1:24:06] a lot of hurting and wounds and things
[1:24:07] but he can't get me
[1:24:11] until god is suing me man i'd like to be
[1:24:14] there
[1:24:16] to see this change come on
[1:24:19] all right but where did brother mention
[1:24:22] armageddon
[1:24:23] anywhere about physical forces shooting
[1:24:25] guns and weapons
[1:24:33] he never mentioned anything about russia
[1:24:35] and them and their great bombs and us
[1:24:36] with our great bombs
[1:24:40] he said protestants and cabinets
[1:24:43] as i said when we went to war in world
[1:24:44] war one both sides was
[1:24:47] on a lot of degree called christians
[1:24:55] world war ii look at where you gathered
[1:24:57] it around the world
[1:25:02] you brothers that was ever in service
[1:25:03] you would know maybe i don't know what
[1:25:05] to do now with it but
[1:25:06] back then you had a dog tag
[1:25:14] you know what it said on there you were
[1:25:16] either a protestant
[1:25:19] or a catholic
[1:25:22] do they still put it on her now i don't
[1:25:24] even know
[1:25:25] and i know they did then because it was
[1:25:27] protestants and catholics he was either
[1:25:29] one of the two
[1:25:30] because they wanted to know who to pray
[1:25:32] for you if you got blown away you know
[1:25:34] that's right so you had to put down you
[1:25:37] was either protestant or catholic
[1:25:42] there's where your forces is coming
[1:25:44] russia today you've got a lot of
[1:25:46] christians in it there's even believer
[1:25:50] message people in russia china
[1:25:53] india
[1:25:58] the message is spreading the world
[1:26:04] but if all we are is protestants and
[1:26:06] catholics
[1:26:12] we're on the wrong side of the bible
[1:26:14] right
[1:26:19] if we're just what we call christians
[1:26:23] and not being the bride
[1:26:28] you even heard a preacher one time years
[1:26:29] ago say
[1:26:33] i know i'm born again because i don't
[1:26:36] know whether i'm in the bride or not
[1:26:42] i just sit there and shoot my head if
[1:26:44] you're born again that is the bride
[1:26:47] amen but that was his point
[1:26:54] you see the deceiving in man's mind
[1:26:59] coming down into this message to turn
[1:27:02] them against the true word
[1:27:06] to destroy this message
[1:27:16] they say and the prophet had faults and
[1:27:18] failures and fallacies
[1:27:21] sure how did you human but show me where
[1:27:24] the messages got any faults and violence
[1:27:28] the message is not brother branham when
[1:27:29] he was preaching the white horse rider
[1:27:32] as the holy spirit that's not the
[1:27:34] message right right
[1:27:36] you had to correct that amen
[1:27:40] that's not the message right it's in the
[1:27:43] books
[1:27:44] it's not the message right the message
[1:27:47] don't have any fallacies
[1:27:49] right come and show me that's right
[1:27:52] amen come and show me the fallacies of
[1:27:56] the message
[1:28:00] years ago people said it was 17 i think
[1:28:02] it was contradictions in the church age
[1:28:04] book
[1:28:05] i put it on the internet put it
[1:28:06] everywhere send me them contradictions
[1:28:09] right
[1:28:12] i ain't done it yet all right
[1:28:16] because they know that a lot of them
[1:28:18] contradictions is silly foolish
[1:28:20] statements
[1:28:23] they think he made wrong yeah
[1:28:30] let the holy spirit put it together
[1:28:36] brother you believe everything brother
[1:28:37] brown said i believe the message of what
[1:28:40] he said
[1:28:44] then the other is like when he said one
[1:28:46] day he said one day said the black and
[1:28:48] white will fight again and die like
[1:28:50] flies
[1:28:54] it's not right quote
[1:28:57] the next message he said that was my
[1:29:00] idea it was not thus saith the lord
[1:29:09] but you know what they are dying like
[1:29:10] flies around the world
[1:29:16] but the message is true let me give my
[1:29:19] stand for the message
[1:29:24] and said this prophet's message is thus
[1:29:26] saith the lord
[1:29:27] right amen if not we better be finding
[1:29:31] us another prophet
[1:29:35] and like i said one ago where was
[1:29:37] everybody at when the prophet was here
[1:29:40] they wouldn't get up and say nothing
[1:29:41] while he was here that's right
[1:29:48] i think it's time the prophet said we
[1:29:49] need to look people in the eye and say
[1:29:51] you're not saying what paul said
[1:29:58] big man in his messenger said listening
[1:30:00] to him one day he kept saying
[1:30:01] run around and said shortly and raise my
[1:30:02] hand i said he didn't say it brother
[1:30:06] yeah he said so and so we'll see
[1:30:07] everybody that i would have took the
[1:30:08] man's word
[1:30:09] the brother run said i said he didn't
[1:30:10] say that
[1:30:14] i said here's what he said group just
[1:30:16] said you left that off
[1:30:21] he said well okay i'll say it for my
[1:30:22] words i said continue on
[1:30:25] as long as you don't say brother brown
[1:30:26] said it
[1:30:28] all right see where's the mercy of the
[1:30:32] people at
[1:30:32] right well so-and-so said run around
[1:30:35] said so-and-so
[1:30:42] don't know whether it's true or not but
[1:30:45] heaven helped those people
[1:30:46] that say those things
[1:30:52] because that's death amen
[1:30:57] he said well why are they still living
[1:30:58] brother there because they've got to be
[1:31:00] there to be deceivers
[1:31:02] that's right they must need to be
[1:31:04] heresies among you that they better
[1:31:06] prove
[1:31:06] maybe make manifest the guy was standing
[1:31:09] up in the pulpit and said brother brown
[1:31:11] was wrong
[1:31:12] and a filler fire struck him and killed
[1:31:13] him dead everybody in the ability to run
[1:31:16] out and they believe right around was
[1:31:19] right wouldn't it
[1:31:21] a man just got killed but because he
[1:31:23] don't get killed
[1:31:25] it's more deceiving
[1:31:45] let's go into the communion
[1:31:49] foot washing
