[0:00] everybody doing okay
[0:05] today we
[0:07] are before we get started does anybody
[0:09] else
[0:10] have any questions concerning the first
[0:14] seal I know we did a little bit last
[0:16] week kind of got off the subject a
[0:17] little bit but never off the subject to
[0:19] answer a question never off the subject
[0:22] to answer a question so anybody have any
[0:25] other questions on the first seal we got
[0:26] all the symbols down you should have uh
[0:29] if not you can go back to the website
[0:31] and brother Tim got a picture of the
[0:34] board so it should be on the website so
[0:38] if you have a question I do can you tie
[0:40] in the lion into that a little bit more
[0:43] the lion brother R said the lion was
[0:46] bold and that's what happened in the
[0:48] first three ages they had the faith of
[0:50] the fathers they had the word of God
[0:53] working in their
[0:54] life remember the lion ox man an eagle
[0:57] if you go back into Ezekiel Ezekiel 1
[1:00] and in there you see those four combat
[1:02] Beast brother Brown said that was the
[1:04] combat Beast which was the Holy
[1:08] Ghost okay that's the Holy Ghost working
[1:10] in The
[1:12] Believer if you go back into Ezekiel
[1:15] you'll find that that these uh that
[1:18] these
[1:19] people are looking at this these four
[1:22] Beast are ezekiel's looking at the four
[1:25] beast and seeing a lion the face of a
[1:28] lion face of an ox face of a man face of
[1:30] an eagle and they all face forward and
[1:32] you say well that can't happen if
[1:33] they're in a square but that you got to
[1:36] think
[1:37] spiritual spiritual thing would tell me
[1:39] is that that is the Holy Ghost in The
[1:42] Believer if Sister Trudy has the Holy
[1:44] Ghost no it's not if but it is for me
[1:46] cuz I don't know whether she does or not
[1:47] but her fruits will show it MC millon
[1:50] that's what I'm talking to it's try now
[1:54] if if she is in a situation where she
[1:58] needs to be bold then that lion Spirit l
[2:02] i o n not lying lion Spirit would come
[2:06] and not so much as Helper because it's
[2:08] the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost has
[2:11] characteristics everybody understand
[2:13] that the Holy Ghost has characteristics
[2:15] holy Christ the lamb see that's why I
[2:18] wrote that on the board Christ the lamb
[2:19] the Holy Ghost selfs sameed Spirit only
[2:23] one God with many many manifestations
[2:26] but when the Holy Ghost comes brother R
[2:28] said those four combat beasts were here
[2:30] to help you and I
[2:32] overcome first three ages needed the
[2:34] lion Spirit to overcome and to do what
[2:39] to set a
[2:41] standard a basis for everybody to come
[2:44] to and then we're going to see that the
[2:46] ox was Labor we're going to see that
[2:49] that was a different characteristic of
[2:52] the Holy Ghost the man with a different
[2:55] characteristic of the Holy Ghost and
[2:56] then the eagle of course we know more
[2:58] about that because we're in in the eagle
[3:00] age because what a lion is this High
[3:04] correct a lion can only see as far as
[3:07] the grass is tall Ox is a little bit
[3:10] taller he can see a little bit over the
[3:11] grass because he's down where he can eat
[3:13] the grass all right A man is upright he
[3:16] can see a little bit further because
[3:17] we're standing taller than the ox and
[3:19] the lion but now what about the eagle
[3:21] see we have limited eyesight as man but
[3:24] now eagle goes up higher and he can see
[3:26] Way Beyond right so in that first church
[3:29] they had that lion Spirit which was
[3:32] right here this is the faith of the
[3:33] fathers right here they had all these
[3:36] virtues working in their
[3:39] life Peter says what Silver and Gold
[3:41] Have I None but such as I
[3:44] have right here virtue that man that
[3:48] walked Drew virtue from Peter all right
[3:51] that was the lion l i o n Spirit the
[3:54] boldness of a lion The Roaring of a lion
[3:57] they had the word of God remember we
[3:58] said they had the word to God until 606
[4:01] ad when n come into being and then we're
[4:04] going to see that that's what started
[4:05] this four Church Age first three ages 1
[4:09] 2 and three Paul irenius and Martin read
[4:14] the commentary in the in the church A's
[4:16] book about those three men they all had
[4:19] the Holy Ghost working in their life
[4:20] they all were very
[4:22] bold hey Paul said you'll be judged by
[4:25] my
[4:26] gospel well see when we stand in the
[4:28] pull pit today and say you'll be judged
[4:30] by my gospel that's the same lion Spirit
[4:32] lion spirit that we need in this end
[4:35] time brother BR said we need all four to
[4:36] get out of here cuz see they needed the
[4:39] lion Spirit to get through the first
[4:41] three
[4:42] ages bold something that the book of
[4:46] Acts the book of Acts they were bold
[4:48] right remember when the Holy Ghost come
[4:50] they went out and started telling the
[4:52] people this is
[4:53] that all right then the O Spirit brother
[4:56] Brandon said the O Spirit was just so
[4:59] they could make make it through the age
[5:00] the ox is what very slow but that joker
[5:03] can pull a load an ox may be slow a
[5:06] horse is faster but Ox is slow and that
[5:09] Ox can you just call her an
[5:12] ox pull that's I'm going can
[5:15] pull that's it but the ox is slow but
[5:18] see there's a characteristic and that's
[5:20] the characteristic you and I need we
[5:22] need the lion Spirit to be bold they
[5:25] were bold but they had to die so they
[5:27] didn't need the O Spirit to continue on
[5:30] everybody understand what I'm saying
[5:32] okay everybody understand shake your
[5:33] head if you do if you don't that o
[5:36] sacrificial that o is sacrificial we're
[5:38] going to read it well maybe we need to
[5:40] stop stop and do this okay lion Spirit
[5:44] you want to see the characteristic
[5:46] brother Bown said that was Matthew Mark
[5:48] Luke and John right the four gospels was
[5:51] the four lion watch how many of you have
[5:54] a scfi
[5:56] Bible turn to
[5:58] Matthew
[6:00] we need to go this way thank s qu that's
[6:02] okay we'll go this way I really don't
[6:04] mind a bet like I said questions
[6:06] unanswered or not should not be we
[6:09] should all be
[6:11] answered
[6:12] now go to Matthew to the very first
[6:15] commentary part of make sure
[6:20] that not so go to the commentary where
[6:23] it says the gospel of Matthew the very
[6:26] first where it says The Gospel According
[6:28] to St Matthew I want you to look
[6:31] scoffield was not a prophet and
[6:33] scoffield was not right in everything
[6:35] that he done but scoffield brought words
[6:38] like theophany and logos and all these
[6:40] things that's where brother Brown got
[6:42] this from because he said now some of
[6:43] the things that U um scoffield had he
[6:46] said because he was a
[6:48] trinitarian he said here you see the
[6:50] Trinity lay through the B well that's a
[6:52] that's one of those cherry seeds that
[6:55] you spit out but now he had a lot of
[6:57] things that I believe the Holy Ghost
[6:59] move
[7:00] moved brother Rand said in the first
[7:03] three Ages was a lion spirit that was a
[7:06] bold now what is a lion he's the
[7:10] king King Jesus all right King Lion is
[7:14] King now what I don't think that that
[7:19] scoffield knew what he was writing but
[7:22] God knew what he was writing through
[7:23] scoffield and watch his commentary on
[7:26] all four we're going to cover all four
[7:27] today that way we will and I told you I
[7:29] think in the first we cover the four
[7:31] combat beast but let's I guess we better
[7:32] cover them now that way we'll know when
[7:34] we go to the Ops what we're doing the
[7:36] man and the Eagle St Matthew the writer
[7:39] of the First Gospel is all degree was
[7:41] Matthew called Levi I want you to
[7:45] look the theme the scope and purpose of
[7:48] the book are indicated in the first
[7:49] verse Matthew is the book of the
[7:51] generation of Jesus Christ son of David
[7:53] Son of Abraham this connects him at once
[7:57] with two of the most important the Old
[7:58] Testament Covenant the davidic Covenant
[8:01] of what
[8:04] kingship watch how many times Scofield
[8:07] says King now we're talking about the
[8:09] lion the LI the boldness of a lion and
[8:13] watch Matthew every one of these
[8:14] Matthew's gospel Mark's gospel
[8:17] Luke and John are all there's your
[8:21] four Spirits sent to the church Matthew
[8:25] was what lying he proclaims a lot of
[8:28] things that Mark does it watch Mark's
[8:30] writing Mark's writing is
[8:32] laborous Ox burden Bearer now Luke was a
[8:37] what Luke was a physician he was smart
[8:40] he had intelligent
[8:44] man remember and brother Brown said John
[8:46] was a what a prophetic book a lot of
[8:49] things that are in the Book of John that
[8:50] are not even in the other three gospels
[8:52] most of the other three gospels parallel
[8:54] each other but John is more of a
[8:56] prophetic what Eagle well watch this
[9:01] of Jesus Christ in that two-fold
[9:03] character then Matthew writes following
[9:05] the order indicated in the first verse
[9:07] he writes first of the what the
[9:10] king king being born king king of the
[9:13] Jews son of David then the son of
[9:16] Abraham obedient to death but the
[9:18] prominent character of Christ in Matthew
[9:20] is that of the
[9:22] Covenant King
[9:25] Lion David's righteous branch
[9:30] all right now turn over to L Mark now
[9:33] Mark was what the
[9:35] ox
[9:37] correct Mark with the
[9:47] op now Mark is the op so watch
[9:56] this the date of Mark was obviously
[9:59] Place between 8057 and 63 the theme
[10:01] here's the theme now this is Scofield
[10:03] writing the commentary of of Mark the
[10:07] scope and purpose of the book are
[10:08] evident from its contents in it Jesus is
[10:12] seen as the mighty what's an ox worker
[10:16] what's an ox worker a worker that's the
[10:19] ox Spirit the worker labor remember
[10:22] labor what's a worker called a laborer
[10:25] all right rather than as the unique
[10:28] teacher it is the gospel of Jehovah's
[10:30] servant the branch as Matthew is the
[10:31] gospel of the branch unto David
[10:34] everywhere the servant servant you watch
[10:36] how many times it says servant cuz what
[10:37] is an ox you get on that ox and write it
[10:40] he's your servant I mean he you he
[10:42] serves
[10:43] you everywhere the servant character of
[10:46] the Incarnate son is Manifest keep
[10:49] reading the characteristic word is
[10:51] straightway a servant word there is no
[10:54] genealogy for who gives the genealogy of
[10:57] a servant
[10:59] the distinctive character of Christ in
[11:01] mark is set forth in Philippians 26-8
[11:03] you can read that but this lowly servant
[11:06] what
[11:07] Ox laborer burden Bearer which is who
[11:12] Jesus Christ he come out with the
[11:13] boldness of a Lon behold the Kingdom of
[11:15] Heaven is at hand
[11:17] repent in Matthew Mark he's a laborer
[11:21] but this lowly servant who emptied
[11:23] himself of the form of God and was found
[11:25] in fashion as a man was nevertheless the
[11:27] Mighty God as Mark distinctively
[11:29] declares and therefore Mighty Works
[11:30] accompanied and authenticated his
[11:33] ministry now listen to this as befits a
[11:37] servant
[11:39] gospel there's your op Mark is
[11:42] characteristically a gospel of Deeds
[11:47] Works rather than a
[11:51] word right there's your ODS now let's go
[11:53] over to Luke Luke was a what a physician
[11:56] very smart
[11:57] man look at how close that the holy
[12:00] spirit is
[12:02] using U Scofield that's why I like
[12:05] Scofield writing it's a good study
[12:11] Bible Luke is what man are intelligence
[12:17] right are what man is a what a human
[12:22] correct all right let's read the
[12:26] theme Luke is the gospel
[12:31] of what the human Divine
[12:36] one one as John is the Divine human one
[12:41] there's your prophetic John is writing
[12:43] about the Divine human one Luke is
[12:45] writing about the human Divine
[12:48] One the key phrase is son of
[12:51] man
[12:54] man in harmony with its dis inent Luke
[12:57] relates those things concerning in Jesus
[12:59] which demonstrate
[13:01] entirely how entirely human he was he
[13:05] runs his GE genealogy to Adam and the
[13:09] most detailed account is given of his
[13:11] mother and of his infancy and Boyhood
[13:14] why that man Spirit was writing and
[13:18] showing how that man was born but it was
[13:21] a human Divine
[13:22] one all right everybody got that pretty
[13:26] close huh now let's go to John
[13:37] what is Eagle prophetic or what
[13:41] Revelation watch what John see John
[13:43] didn't say in the beginning a baby was
[13:46] born as all the other ones started out
[13:48] giv genealogy what's the first thing
[13:50] John said in the beginning was the word
[13:53] Word was God the word was with God and
[13:55] the Word was God and verse 14 and the
[13:57] word was made flesh not the human Divine
[14:01] one now the Divine human one all right
[14:04] look the theme this is indicated both in
[14:06] the Pro prologue and in the last verse
[14:09] of the Gospel proper and is the
[14:12] Incarnation of the Eternal Word how
[14:16] prophetic can that
[14:18] be but listen and Son of God himself God
[14:21] in Jesus the Christ to reveal God in the
[14:25] terms of a human life revealed prophetic
[14:32] Eagle the Eternal this book is in seven
[14:35] natural
[14:36] divisions the Eternal Word incarnate in
[14:39] Jesus the Christ and then the witness of
[14:41] John but if you'll read there's a lot of
[14:43] things in John that it's not in the
[14:45] other three
[14:46] gospels
[14:48] um I can't remember all of them I used
[14:51] to I used to could name them but there's
[14:53] a lot of things in there that you won't
[14:55] find in Matthew Mark and Luke why John
[14:57] was prophetic he went up a little higher
[14:59] could see things a little further
[15:02] Matthew was down here telling you about
[15:04] a Divine King that come on the earth the
[15:06] lion so that's what the people in the
[15:08] first age was doing they were bringing
[15:12] that lion Spirit lion Spirit out of
[15:15] those four combat beasts that's why
[15:17] brother brandham said if you watch a
[15:18] fourth seal brother brand said the
[15:19] combat beast when he got to the fifth
[15:21] seal he knew the Rapture already took
[15:23] place because where are those four
[15:24] combat beat they're in the bride all
[15:29] four is in you and I they needed one two
[15:32] and three age they needed the lion being
[15:34] bold come out see the the the Holy Ghost
[15:36] was new to them there was nobody had the
[15:38] Holy Ghost to the book of Acts it was a
[15:41] new thing but they come out so bold
[15:43] Peter said Silver and Gold Have I None
[15:45] but such as I have I give unto you then
[15:48] you had the ox age which is the fourth
[15:49] age which what happened 68 million
[15:52] Protestants were killed by the Catholic
[15:53] church that really literally brother R
[15:56] said physically it killed the people and
[15:58] spiritually that kill the people all
[15:59] right what by Blood that's why that red
[16:02] hor that's why that horse was red
[16:04] brother R said he rode right through the
[16:06] blood of the Saints but in the O age
[16:09] read in the church age book that's why
[16:12] my brother R said we had to get the
[16:14] Daniel 70 weeks out of the way to put in
[16:16] the dates and the times and all that
[16:18] then you had to do the church ages to
[16:19] show that the church Ages was not just a
[16:21] happening in the earth it was something
[16:23] that God was doing in his people all
[16:26] right then he brought the seal that
[16:27] place the Daniel 70 weeks the church
[16:29] ages and the seal go back to the church
[16:31] age book read the first three ages
[16:33] there's your lion the fourth age was the
[16:36] ox age brother Rand said they gave their
[16:38] life
[16:41] willingly remember a lot of the stories
[16:43] read Fox's book of Martyrs quit reading
[16:46] all these other true story magazines
[16:48] like brother R said and all these other
[16:49] junk that we read we
[16:52] read I've read Fox's book of Martyrs
[16:55] they were taking certain people to be
[16:57] killed and and the people would the
[16:59] lions were so were not hungry enough so
[17:01] they aged them
[17:03] on they agged them on to get them to
[17:07] kill them that was the spirit of the age
[17:09] they gave their life literally for the
[17:11] gospel they
[17:13] believe and then a lot of the Roman
[17:16] centurions that took them in there and
[17:18] watched this threw their swords down and
[17:21] run in there with them and died as
[17:23] Martyrs because they saw a
[17:26] life but see that's the life they had
[17:29] the ox life worker laborer if you kill
[17:33] 68 million people in just one Church age
[17:35] that's about that's the longest Church
[17:37] age though it's about 1500 years dur in
[17:40] the Dark Ages when Rome ruled everything
[17:43] and they killed 68 million people and
[17:45] brother Ram said Untold billions they
[17:47] killed
[17:48] spiritually but the 68 million were as
[17:50] brother Mark was saying last week they
[17:53] were Christians they were the bride that
[17:55] was the Bride of that
[17:57] age um look at people like um
[18:01] polycarp they tore an out house down to
[18:04] burn him at the Stak and when they tried
[18:06] to burn him the Flames blew away from
[18:09] his
[18:10] body and he had to physically as far as
[18:13] I see it they physically had to push the
[18:15] Flames up closer and he finally said in
[18:17] other words you know I'm ready to go and
[18:19] the Flames took him and they said a
[18:20] white dove lifted up out of the out of
[18:23] the fire see that was God working in
[18:25] those people course poot was kind of the
[18:28] at the end coming close to the Dark Ages
[18:30] but remember all the ages left over it
[18:33] doesn't stop in one year no there's 2 3
[18:35] 4 5 10 years look at the Pentecostal age
[18:38] and this time Pentecostal age left over
[18:40] so you got all lap over
[18:44] ages but does everybody understand the
[18:46] lion Spirit of the first age that first
[18:49] seal was what
[18:52] bold white righteous Church went riding
[18:55] out but a real white righteous Church
[18:58] went riding out false one and a real one
[19:03] see brother Bown doesn't really cover
[19:05] that but you got to remember several
[19:06] things that he said he said Satan was a
[19:09] copycat so Satan never goes first doing
[19:12] something and the Christian realm Satan
[19:15] never goes first cuz he can't have
[19:18] anything to
[19:20] copy God has to go first the holy ghost
[19:23] in a group of people goes first then
[19:25] that white righteous devil comes riding
[19:28] in behind him so brother R didn't really
[19:30] cover that but remember this that as
[19:33] those four horse riders go riding
[19:37] out in those first four seals remember
[19:40] one thing for sure God has already got a
[19:43] white righteous Church on the Saint he's
[19:46] already got a group that he's
[19:47] sanctifying through the blood right he's
[19:50] already got a church that is the black
[19:52] horse is death well that's spiritual
[19:54] death you got to die to yourself if your
[19:56] old man still alive you're not dead yet
[19:58] right right and then the last age is or
[20:04] the last horse is all the colors mixed
[20:07] together well the fourth stage of your
[20:09] new birth is is brother Brown said this
[20:11] justification sanctification the baptism
[20:13] of the Holy Ghost and then the word
[20:15] being what made alive in your heart all
[20:19] right yall know understood what I talked
[20:21] to you before remember you got
[20:23] justification Sanic Bol the body just
[20:26] sanation Bap Holy Ghost the F all this
[20:29] in it's got to be the four stages
[20:31] remember the four
[20:34] stages how many bugs were they in U in
[20:37] Joel
[20:39] four four bugs eat it down pommer worm
[20:43] caterpillar
[20:46] Locust canker worm I don't even like
[20:48] that
[20:50] word but those four eat it down then
[20:52] four has to bring it back brother R said
[20:54] four is not a good number but it is a
[20:56] good number in restoration because you
[20:57] have to use it you have to have
[21:00] justification sanctification baptism of
[21:02] the Holy Ghost sure that gets you in the
[21:03] body but you got to have the
[21:06] word to make all that come together and
[21:08] make it alive sure you have the baptism
[21:10] of the Holy Ghost and and and cut the
[21:13] word off and and do like the preacher
[21:15] did drinking the beer you know but God's
[21:16] going to take you off the scene that's
[21:17] why you see a lot of people dying they
[21:19] don't take all the word of God onto the
[21:22] change of the body but see nobody had to
[21:24] do that until I didn't want to say that
[21:26] because we we need to stay off of the
[21:28] change of the body because none of these
[21:29] ages took a change right all right none
[21:32] that's what make I want this to be so
[21:34] important that nobody took a change so
[21:37] the lion spirit is not going to make you
[21:39] change your body cuz it didn't them the
[21:43] ox is not going to make you come to a
[21:45] change of a
[21:47] body the man
[21:52] intelligence I'm not talking about the
[21:54] knowledge of man I'm talking about Holy
[21:55] Ghost knowledge okay I'm coming back and
[21:58] then the eagle prophetic which all were
[21:59] in the eagle age but if you'll read
[22:01] brother Rand brother R said it takes all
[22:03] four in this age he said the ox age
[22:06] Daddy's quoted it many times he said the
[22:08] O Spirit we need just to get up and go
[22:11] to
[22:11] work and overcome in this age that's
[22:14] that same o spirit that those people
[22:16] sacrificed
[22:18] theirself literally sacrificed theel see
[22:20] that was a literal part but there's a
[22:23] spiritual part say that we have to
[22:25] overcome we don't have to overcome
[22:27] somebody persecuting us every day right
[22:30] sure we get persecuted enough every day
[22:32] you sisters do with your hair and your
[22:33] dress and we do with our conduct that's
[22:36] that's that don't make us better but our
[22:38] conduct is better you don't see us with
[22:39] tattoos and earrings and you know and I
[22:41] hope we're guys I hope we're finished we
[22:44] wearing short wearing shorts and stuff
[22:45] like that but that's what's going to
[22:48] take to get us out of here right that's
[22:50] what's going to take to get us out of
[22:51] here all four of those Beast
[22:54] what White Horse red horse black horse
[22:58] all those three mixed together makes a
[23:00] Pale
[23:02] Horse justification sanctification
[23:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost all together
[23:06] makes you the word of God got to have
[23:08] all three you can't have one or two
[23:10] because it makes the color different
[23:11] that's right in the end okay but this
[23:14] age coming up is going to be the ox age
[23:16] so keep that in your mind look take
[23:18] peace and kill
[23:21] blood there's a lot of death going on
[23:24] here but this was natural killing this
[23:27] was natural blood
[23:29] but to remember in the first
[23:32] age justification we're going to cover
[23:34] back we're going to go back and cover
[23:35] this later on but first age I mean I'm
[23:38] sorry the first seal excuse me covers
[23:42] justification I hope you saw that I
[23:44] didn't say anything about it but that
[23:46] man to be white righteous you've got to
[23:48] be
[23:49] justified remember what Keith was
[23:51] preaching and daddy's been preaching you
[23:52] know those who he's Justified he's
[23:54] already
[23:55] glorified if you're truly Justified you
[23:57] are a white righteous person right all
[24:00] right so there's your first seal second
[24:02] seal is what
[24:05] blood how do you get Sanctified Bible
[24:08] says through the blood of Jesus Christ
[24:10] which is color
[24:12] is so there's a spiritual meaning to all
[24:15] this we're doing the natural part but
[24:17] there's a spiritual meaning that you got
[24:18] to get in your
[24:21] life you listen I'm telling you people
[24:23] this is the age though where we don't
[24:25] just see that we're Justified and our
[24:27] past sins are off and we live good
[24:29] Christian Life I hope we're not I hope
[24:31] we're past that
[24:33] point but to know that if he's already
[24:35] Justified you if you've read the rising
[24:37] of the sun he's brother bandam even
[24:39] speaks of quickening your mortal body
[24:42] your mortal body is quickened by this
[24:45] word to do what not reach for the beer
[24:47] anymore you say Well everybody's
[24:49] thinking way up here think down here
[24:51] right so simple this same hand that used
[24:54] to give them the one finger signal mhm
[24:57] you know they don't do that anymore what
[25:00] did God do he transformed me he took the
[25:04] same this is the same 16 elements the
[25:06] same body that's right I got the same
[25:08] finger still let's just be literal here
[25:10] I still got the same finger and I could
[25:12] do it if I wanted to but I don't want to
[25:14] anymore that's right the one that
[25:16] reached into that went to the
[25:17] convenience store and said yeah give me
[25:18] a six pack of beer and sit it down and
[25:20] no have no problem with doing it and I
[25:21] know most you did too right or the
[25:24] liquor cabinet or the or the cigarette
[25:25] you didn't have no problem going and say
[25:27] give me a pack of bro but do you do it
[25:29] now I hope not if you do you're not born
[25:31] again just just period you're not born
[25:34] again if you still do that because what
[25:36] happened this same guy that walks in the
[25:38] convenience store now I look at the beer
[25:40] and go God thank
[25:43] you yes look at the cigarettes and the
[25:45] and the skull and all the things that I
[25:47] used to do thank you God well I look
[25:50] guys it's the same me that's right right
[25:53] but I've been quickened this human
[25:55] mortal body has been quickened by
[25:57] something that's inside of
[25:59] me sisters you walk up and you sit down
[26:01] at the thing and and you say well I'm
[26:03] going to go get my haircut
[26:06] today let me get a little stronger I'm
[26:08] going to go get my nails done
[26:12] today I'm going to go get and put a
[26:14] little bit of this on and a little that
[26:15] on cuz they got some age spots
[26:20] coming Jim didn't have any problem
[26:22] getting her haircut when she got her
[26:23] haircut she just went and sat and said
[26:25] okay today I'm getting an appointment
[26:26] I'm going to haircut right but you know
[26:29] what that's not even a part of her life
[26:32] anymore shouldn't be a part of your life
[26:34] there should not be a question well
[26:36] should I shouldn't
[26:38] I see everybody thinks the seals and all
[26:41] and it is a great revelation of God but
[26:43] what it does it brings you back down to
[26:44] the Earth and shows you what God's done
[26:47] in your life yes not that I can point my
[26:50] finger and say Tim I can change you or
[26:52] I'm going to zap you out of no that's
[26:54] not that's right we'll use that when we
[26:57] need
[26:58] it Elijah didn't go around zapping
[27:01] people but when he needed it he called
[27:03] fire down from heaven to to take those
[27:06] preest out right there come a time when
[27:08] there was a showdown right but now they
[27:11] didn't Peter Paul James and John they
[27:13] just walked about I believe they just
[27:14] did their normal duty but when the word
[27:16] quickened them when Peter and and and
[27:18] John walked by that gate beautiful they
[27:21] probably walk by there every day
[27:23] probably saw the same man but one day
[27:24] something stuck in their heart and
[27:26] something contact
[27:29] they said Silver and Gold Have i n but
[27:30] what I have see they had to have it
[27:32] first right what I have I give to you
[27:35] now that was the same Peter now Peter
[27:37] was a
[27:38] fisherman right right crude fisherman
[27:42] Fisherman's always been crude Pirates
[27:44] fishermen all that they've all had crude
[27:46] language walk around you know with
[27:48] earrings I'm sure Peter was pretty Brash
[27:50] before Jesus met
[27:52] him but what did he do he was in that 3
[27:54] and 1/2 years Jesus was transforming
[27:57] that man that's right and only until the
[28:00] Holy Ghost fell on him only until then
[28:04] was he a bold person using the word of
[28:06] God like it should have been used or
[28:08] using his body that's why the Bible says
[28:10] we make our give our body as a
[28:13] sacrifice holy and acceptable without
[28:16] blame first seal justification white
[28:19] righteous person second seal
[28:21] sanctification God is sanctifying you I
[28:23] Die daily I do I still got things I got
[28:25] to get out of my life Peter still had
[28:26] things he had to get out of his life
[28:28] right everybody did but see we come up
[28:30] in the last age and we got to have all
[28:32] four which is justification
[28:33] sanctification then the baptism of the
[28:35] Holy Ghost you say what's that got to do
[28:36] with death that's when the old you is
[28:41] dead if they're still part of you alive
[28:44] you can't receive the Holy Ghost that's
[28:46] right because remember what is it
[28:50] called it's not called
[28:56] a
[28:58] a half
[28:59] birth right it's called a
[29:05] what you don't ever have you don't have
[29:07] a half
[29:09] birth you have a new birth that means
[29:12] your old birth is what dead when you get
[29:15] something new the other part's Dead all
[29:17] right that's why they called a new birth
[29:18] Jesus said you must be born
[29:22] again the old you must die there's your
[29:26] black horse
[29:28] all right and in the pale horses all
[29:29] that mixed together and then what did
[29:31] Brother R say after that fourth Church
[29:33] AE or that fourth steal I'm sorry the
[29:36] Rapture takes place why cuz all the
[29:38] combat Beast are gone fifth seal you
[29:39] don't see a combat Beast Sixth Seal you
[29:41] don't see a combat Beast seventh seal
[29:42] you don't see a combat Beast why he said
[29:44] cuz the Rapture take place on the four
[29:45] seal that makes people go completely
[29:48] cuckoo cuz you go 1 2 3 4 and the
[29:50] Rapture take place so we don't have
[29:51] nothing to do with 56 and 7 no 56 and 7
[29:54] is what causes the Rapture to take place
[29:57] we'll get into that we'll get into that
[29:59] don't worry I
[30:00] mean I noticed with the Pale Horse
[30:04] you've got black and you've got red
[30:06] which are two dark colors and if you mix
[30:07] the two of those together there's got to
[30:10] be a lot of white yep there's a lot of
[30:13] rightousness self-righteousness in that
[30:15] church today for to be a
[30:19] pale cuz you got to have that that and
[30:22] pale brother R said it wasn't really a
[30:23] gray he said it was a putrid color would
[30:26] you take
[30:27] white black and red mix it together like
[30:31] sister T said keep putting a little more
[30:33] white into it it's a putrid pukey
[30:35] looking color it's not even U it's not
[30:38] even gray we did it one time somewhere
[30:41] and it was it better look
[30:44] good but if you're on the other end of
[30:46] the deal and you've got the
[30:47] justification right the sanctification
[30:49] right the baptism the Holy Ghost right
[30:51] then all that mixed together is a
[30:52] beautiful picture that's what God wanted
[30:55] a flower
[30:56] garden and not just colors we we we we
[30:59] harp on colors black and white and
[31:01] yellow people what about
[31:04] character what about the character God
[31:06] don't care what color your skin is he
[31:08] wants your
[31:10] character I wouldn't care if we were all
[31:12] black it wouldn't bother me a bit but
[31:15] it's the character God's looking for God
[31:17] said black people can sing better than
[31:19] white people cuz they got the beat they
[31:21] got that spiritual and he said oh Lord
[31:24] let me have some of that remember the
[31:25] old black man Daddy was talking about he
[31:26] said let me have some of that so you
[31:28] know what you still in your character
[31:30] your human character and you being black
[31:33] or yellow or whatever he liked some
[31:34] characteristic of that
[31:36] form cuz that was part of him he loved
[31:40] that kind of
[31:41] worship so don't ever think that you
[31:44] were
[31:46] born this
[31:48] way for just to be a burden no God
[31:51] wanted you that way that's if God wanted
[31:53] me the color I am then thank God yes but
[31:57] let's just connect with God that's the
[31:59] thing is getting connected with God
[32:01] because he has a beautiful flower garden
[32:02] and I that's what I said I believe the
[32:04] character of a person is much more
[32:05] better than the than the the skin color
[32:08] of a person you know and God looks at
[32:10] character remember he looks at character
[32:11] first all right so that's what we I want
[32:13] you to do too is look at the character
[32:15] of these ages maybe I didn't cover that
[32:16] enough and thank you sister for bringing
[32:18] it out maybe I didn't cover that enough
[32:20] for the lion that lion attitude or L is
[32:22] a boldness that you and I what do we do
[32:26] we testify
[32:28] somebody asked us a question somebody
[32:29] asked you why do you don't you cut your
[32:34] hair well
[32:36] you I don't won let
[32:39] me they won't let that's my
[32:42] husband no no no she'll say let me tell
[32:45] you so she was she was getting her hand
[32:48] operated on the other day and the lady
[32:51] ask her says take her hair down she said
[32:54] yeah I need you need to take your hair
[32:55] down well B when she unclipped it and it
[32:56] fell down the hair the lady said where'd
[32:58] you get all that hair
[33:00] from said well I don't cut I don't cut
[33:02] it don't cut it she said yeah the Bible
[33:05] says for you not to cut here the where
[33:07] that say that out so June just happened
[33:09] to have her little Nook with her you
[33:11] know and she was it's got the Bible in
[33:13] it so I come walking in and sat down and
[33:15] we started going through in First
[33:16] Corinthians and showed the lady where it
[33:18] says her hair was given to her for
[33:20] covering her glory well you know what
[33:23] that was that lion Spirit lion l i o n I
[33:26] don't want to be wrong on on the
[33:27] internet lion spirit that roaring lion
[33:29] what was he doing he was proving that
[33:31] the word of God was right through what
[33:33] not just through
[33:36] words that woman saw a human being a
[33:40] life not just something you read on the
[33:43] paper he she saw a life and that's what
[33:46] God wants he wants this to come off of
[33:47] this page and be a
[33:49] life that that you can look at them and
[33:51] say they're
[33:53] different we went to jun's Mother's
[33:55] Church um couple weeks ago and they were
[34:00] dressed the same and when we come back
[34:01] it was in above Helen in Robertstown so
[34:03] when we come back through Helen after
[34:04] the church service was over with there
[34:06] was the world with the shorts and
[34:08] spaghetti tops and no bras and all this
[34:10] stuff and tattoos that was sitting in
[34:13] the church that's right
[34:15] yeah tell me the difference that's right
[34:18] there is no difference and I'm not and
[34:20] you know they know all they
[34:22] know but sitting in that church I saw no
[34:25] different people than what was walking
[34:27] on the streets down there drinking beer
[34:28] in the middle of
[34:30] Helen so where's the difference you and
[34:34] I are
[34:35] different and if your life doesn't
[34:37] project being
[34:39] different every day if somebody can't
[34:41] tell you're different you need a new
[34:44] birth cuz your old birth is still
[34:47] producing what Mom and Daddy produced
[34:50] and the old spirit that they that that
[34:52] that was given to you at Birth you
[34:54] understand what I'm saying yes the old
[34:55] nature yes the old nature of life if
[34:58] you're still doing if somebody can't
[34:59] tell you're
[35:01] different now just as a testimony our
[35:04] first
[35:07] reunion our 10-year reunion was in
[35:12] 1989 well I'm one of the class officers
[35:14] and we got all this stuff together well
[35:16] I was still serving the world and and we
[35:19] went and had a drink and all these
[35:22] things that wherever it was no it was a
[35:26] right there on the corner
[35:27] no you're right H in I'm sorry it was a
[35:30] hall in no different right right right
[35:35] the second the 20 year one was in
[35:40] 1998 I got born again that
[35:43] year that was my year of my new
[35:45] birth I go to it and I'm going and
[35:48] there's like four or five of us officers
[35:50] we get in we go to each other's house
[35:51] and we set up all the plans so nobody
[35:53] else saw me but those guys so when we
[35:55] get there and all the class people walk
[35:57] in the door number one half of them want
[35:59] to know who I
[36:03] am now listen I live with these people I
[36:05] was a very popular in school yeah
[36:09] everybody knew way was so but you know
[36:12] what everybody knew who I was and they
[36:14] said that June was said well that's
[36:15] June's girlfriend now in the message go
[36:18] around in the message June's girlfriend
[36:20] that was June's boyfriend but
[36:22] anyway but now we go around places in
[36:24] the message and they say who's that one
[36:26] said that's June's
[36:29] husband wait who who that but they know
[36:33] her so anyway we walk in and number one
[36:37] many people did not know who I
[36:39] was I saw him 10 years before and Geor
[36:42] knows we live with each other down there
[36:44] most of people that there were 60 people
[36:46] in my graduating class and most of them
[36:49] still live in that one little area of
[36:51] Banks County so we do see each other
[36:52] every once in a while but the second the
[36:54] 20 year one in 1998
[36:57] they voted me the most changed
[37:05] person some of them only saw me for an
[37:08] hour cuz we were there for just you know
[37:10] I mean the class presidents we were all
[37:12] there five of us so we knew each other
[37:14] Robin and me and a couple others you
[37:15] know so we they knew who I was but when
[37:18] all the other 50s something people got
[37:20] come in the room they're like who is
[37:23] this
[37:24] guy and then you know they said well
[37:26] we're going to have a who who who
[37:28] traveled the furthest who had the most
[37:29] kids and who changed the most so I was
[37:32] voted the most changed guy well they saw
[37:33] the outside man had changed yeah but I
[37:36] knew the Inside Man had changed too
[37:37] which had caused the action of the
[37:39] outside man to be different than what it
[37:42] was 10 years
[37:44] before that to me that's my testimony
[37:47] that God will change your life so much
[37:49] to leing the people that live around you
[37:50] will tell a difference you know I always
[37:53] told when it's said Quicken your moral
[37:55] body just short time ago I thought that
[37:58] me to
[38:00] change didn't I'm telling you what
[38:02] daddy's bringing out now is so clear you
[38:05] can be an adopted son of God and not
[38:07] make the change adopted fully adopted
[38:11] that third stage only show and I don't
[38:13] want to say only to say only that third
[38:15] stage shows you how to change your that
[38:19] that you can be
[38:20] changed not that that is a change but
[38:23] it's to win or to understand but you got
[38:25] to understand how to do something
[38:28] before you can do
[38:29] it got to understand how to drive a car
[38:32] you got to understand all the things
[38:33] about the wheels and the motors and the
[38:34] gas and the oil and all that stuff
[38:36] before you can really begin to drive the
[38:38] car brother yeah when I went to
[38:41] California one was asking about ha said
[38:45] this preacher said something had long ha
[38:48] said well she up Bible out and B study
[38:52] and one of her aunts said I see
[38:55] something and you guys
[39:02] sure
[39:04] right to me guys this is the seals the
[39:07] seals is not a great Supernatural
[39:09] understanding but yet it is a great
[39:11] Supernatural understanding of what who
[39:13] you are God's not going to come down
[39:16] God's not physically coming so where's
[39:18] he coming in you he wants to be in you
[39:19] doing the work that this Bible talks
[39:21] about right here and there we better go
[39:23] mama was here she'd already been out the
[39:25] door
[39:31] her
