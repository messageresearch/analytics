him and he really will make you welcomed and things and he is right on the dot with the money I told the brothers at the fellowship meeting yesterday I said I put my hand behind whatever he does because I know him in the way he does he sends us a detailed report back to the church of every dime that we see send to them and we send the money for the brothers to be able to go you know out on the missionary field and go into to the different countries and you know but we get an account of that which a lot of people don't don't give you but I do appreciate him for being that way and he is a

and uh they have just finished their wonderful service and they want to extend also their greetings to you as uh they know that I'll be preaching this morning in in in in this church so I have I have you seated for a while and uh just to send a little bit of uh the report that uh what transpired in the Philippines uh first of all I would like to thank our pastor here by Samuel Dale for having me over here and uh sister Peggy uh for having me in their home this my second time to to stay in their in their place and uh I am thankful for the hospitality and uh the kindness that they have shown and also the whole family of brother Samuel and um you know brother Danny delmundo he's one of the pastor in the Philippines and last I believe it was last year that he was here and uh he he mentioned to us how good the fellowship went uh when he was here and then he went home he said that uh uh we were having better way uh to go to the Philippines so uh we're looking forward to that time uh and uh you you know many many brothers have met brother samale when he was there in the Philippines last 2005 and uh before just before I I uh I give the report on this relief efforts I just just like to mention that uh this is not the first time that uh uh this church or B samale extended the the assistance because way back in 2004 there was a typhoon also not uh as as strong as this one but uh I was working with Bible Believers uh office during that time and U um this typhoon came and there's one church with 10 families that were it's upper north of the Philippines and uh there were you know big boulders and trees just fell off and uh just buried all the the the houses including the Church of uh of our Brethren there and uh when we went there I was with brother Ernie we we tried to help them there are other uh Believers from other countries who help also in rebuilding the the houses of the people here and just is what about just about the time that we started this relief efforts and the next year brother Samuel came with brother Ernie and brother Tim Calhoun and uh we went there to that place actually and uh it was already uh I mean that was already months after the typhoon but uh you know brother Samuel had the the the burden to to help to further help the people there 10 houses were already built but uh uh there were no church building during that time and uh they they helped in the church building and you know buying these chairs and everything and uh since then that was 2005 uh I mean the the services there the the the people or the Believers they they continue to serve the Lord amen and uh the pastor in that church four years later uh he actually he had a terminal illness and just 3 days after it was diagnosed he just know expired and just left the scene with uh eight small children and you know the Widow of course and uh you know brother Samuel being there and he KN he knew uh I he learned of what happened and he started uh uh sending support for the Widow and the uh you know the children and uh that's what the Bible says that uh we should take care of the widows and the fatherless and that has been ongoing from 2009 until this time and I bring to you also the the the the deepest gratitude of sister prey that's the name of the Widow uh and he he just she just cannot speak or write in in English but uh she when she knew about that I I'll be coming over she said to express their greetings and then now some of the children are all now grown up his eldest I I used to work with IBM uh in the Philippines and so we took the eldest son of the the the pastor and I just gave him a job so he can just after he finished high school we we help them also because most of the local Believers where I where I'm staying in Manila it's the capital city uh we we have we we we try to help the the brothers and sisters up in the mountains uh you know that how how they live there and uh it's very different in what how we live in the city and so myself brother Danny and brother Nessa we just kind of go around once in a while just to check on them and help them and uh having having traveled in other countries we we we can uh I mean brother Nesta and brother Danny has been traveling all over Asia and traveling also in the US and once we get this help we we try to make it a point that uh it reaches the people the the churches there and those who who do not have any contacts those who who cannot even speak in English so uh but they need a lot of uh you know support moral support know prayers and uh I can assure you that this uh that that the monthly um Mission uh love offering that uh is being sent uh to us is being distributed to this ministers and there's one testimony of One Pastor there uh he is is much younger than me and uh he is a pastor but did they go normally and walk about 7 days to go up the mountains because there are natives there that they want to share the message too and just recently uh just before the typhoon they they just came there 7 Days walking uh with in mountains that doesn't have any Trail on it and uh and uh they were able to baptize more than 10 Souls amen amen yeah Hallelujah and you know uh every every time every time that uh this things happen and we know that uh it's not just their efforts but your prayers here and the support that you give it it could have have not been possible for them because as the Bible says uh how can they call on God if they have not heard how can they you know if they did not how can they uh um if they don't believe and there's no preacher so we have to send the preachers and even I I'm from the Philippines I cannot do what they're doing just basically because they are younger than me they're stronger and they and they they know the the terrain of the mountains which I I I I didn't grow up in those mountains so uh but there are souls precious souls in those mountains and we are in the business of looking for the last predestinated seed and who knows they they they might be laying there uh in those mountains and so we're just thankful that um when when the brother just reported it in the last Minister's meeting that we had and I can feel that you know we are all part of uh all this uh Endeavors that uh God has given in our hands uh we we may not do be doing the same thing but uh I believe we're working as a team yes it's it's a one big team that we are working in and it's all for the glory of God we're not building any Kingdom we're not we're not building any group or whatsoever but we just want to look for the last predestinated seed and and so this happened the the the typhoon last uh November uh as I mentioned to the brothers uh they we have we are frequented by 10 by 20 typhoons at least in one year and in some cases it goes to 25 typhoons some are strong some are just mild some are just you know small but uh sometimes it it it it uh it creates flooding sometimes it damages the houses so for for the last four years there's always strong typhoon nearly the end of the month by this month of December and uh there will be houses a certain area in the Philippines particularly the southern area that uh you know there there's lots of flooding maybe I don't know this this doesn't used to happen when I was young but uh maybe because of the climate change and everything uh things has has become worse right and so um we were told that this super typhoon was coming it was coming and uh of course people were preparing the government Was preparing but this is something that has not happened in the past many years and so people were not really complacent but uh they tried to prepare and uh just to to put everything in order but when it came everybody was surprised it was like uh strong winds just sweeping every houses on its path and just you can you will see later on the pictures even the big ships they were pushed to land and uh uh this uh waves from the ocean like 30 ft High just came rushing it's like a tsunami there was no earthquake but uh the the the the winds were so strong and uh just before this typhoon happened there was this there was a strong uh I think 7.5 magnitude in the same area so people were just uh slowly recovering right and uh then this typhoon came so you can just imagine how uh the the extent of the damage that uh that came to the Philippines during that time and so I would like to to share to you some of the the things pictures and the some of the testimonies that goes to the picture and uh uh we will see here in the slides uh how how we approach the the this the problem because um in uh uh when when this happened I was working with brother Nestor another Pastor there brother Danny they just came from from a uh from uh from a trip in some Asian countries and uh when this happened and they they also learned about this so we we kind of group together just to to make sure that the efforts will be done systematically and uh sometimes you know you learn something from where you were working before and I was working in the in with with IBM Philippines during the time and uh one of my responsibility is to to uh is uh to you know conduct this uh disaster recovery program uh we call it risk management so we we we we we studi the risks that uh that may impact the business and uh uh do some things and and and and and uh in case of a disaster we the the the objective is to have a business continuity program we don't stop after the disaster but we want to recover and so learning from these things as uh the the prophet said we can we can learn from our former secular job and you can apply it you know and so uh we we group together and we divided the the what you call this the response in in three phases uh can we have the slide please this would explain how we did it just to make sure that uh everything was done in proper and we we we want we want to to cover oh I okay I can excuse me I'll I'll just get the stick and I thought it was transferred okay so uh what we did is divided it into three phases we call it the first phase was the initial phase the second phase would be the the Reconstruction of the houses by the way we lost around the uh I mean we 258 houses were destroyed in this typhoon these are for the Believers only and uh there are 22 churches that were destroyed also so that means to more than 200 families were affected and uh this is uh I would like to show first uh in the next slide here this is the T typhoon F here and if you can see it hit the middle of uh the Philippine is islands and uh in the next slide please uh we'll show we had colorcoded the the areas that were affected the red ones are the most affected the yellow or yellow orange are the ones that are uh also affected but not as bad as the the red ones I'm staying uh somewhere here we felt the winds there but there was no damage and this is the southern part there was no damage also but as we can see uh uh it went from there and it passed through here only maybe the whole day of Saturday but it it left big Devastation in the country so the next uh slide please uh we just it was this just a focus of uh we can see we have capies Iloilo antika in this island that's late that's the most uh that's where many people died and according according to some of the the the news it's it it's close to 10,000 some say it's over 10,000 people who died and uh it's it just swept everything on its path you know uh when it passed through those islands and uh because this island normally uh uh during during typhoon we have this uh strong waves coming from both parts the China Sea in the Pacific Ocean okay so the next slide please so these are some pictures as we can see here that uh these are the ship uh that was brought to the shore and everything was devastated along its way next picture please uh this a top view actually of before the the typhoon and after the typhoon it was total desolate so there was no houses people were washed away to the ocean I mean no there was no person uh left here because the uh the the the storm surge just came and left it brought every person living here okay so until this time they're still digging when when they go to the wreckage according to the pastor that was there before I left he said uh there are still you know bodies you know this already corrupted bodies that's still being recovered up to up to two weeks ago okay the next picture please so this a closeup of the desolated area you we you you cannot see even see a single body you know uh everything was destroyed um people uh whether all their animals their pets and everything was washed away by the the the ocean the there's the rain was was uh there was no heavy downpour of rain the water came from the ocean the next slide please so now we're going here in the this is a poultry house that is being care uh taken care of by a brother he used to have uh 10,000 chickens something like that uh he's taken care of but after the flood it was all destroyed so um only 11 chickens were left that's the source of of uh his livelihood and uh he doesn't own the poultry is is just he was is just hired to to to to take care of it and after that the owner said I will stop this business and then he doesn't have to he he doesn't have any source of living anymore and for the next let's say five days after the typhoon they were eating the dead chicken there because there's there was nothing to it they cannot buy anything and the mountains everything fell so this is another picture the next slide please uh this is the H one house of the believer nothing was left this uh on the side of the mountains so their houses are mainly made of bamboo sticks and the NEPA hats and uh um that was what was left in their house the second the next picture please uh this is a house that uh this used to be a house you know but uh the the roof fell off and so there I I I was here I I was here in that in that instance I went there there and the people I mean the the the brother and the sister they have three children small children and um they have to sleep there and you know after the the typhoon it was it was very hot you know how the the humidity in in the Philippines and uh and so they they were staying there and you know if the Sun hits the this roof it's it's it's very hot you know and if night time it rains and and it it the winds blow and uh and uh this not a a very safe place because you know when when the the houses were destroyed also the the place where the snakes are staying they were also yeah and uh what happened is uh these snakes they crawl under here on night time and so the Father the our brother there he he he has to have this they call it we call it the jungle B just to make sure that uh he kept he he keeps his children very very safe and not only that because after the typhoon they were looting all around so if they know that you have some food in your house they will try to go there and you have to defend your family you you cannot do anything you you because every it's it's chaos it's Revival of the fittest you know you they have to look for water they have to look for food and so when we went there they don't don't have any clean water we have to to to get some water over in that area and uh it's not really a clean water because the fountain there's some frogs and you know mosquitoes and everything but uh they they stayed there for about a few weeks because we don't have even materials you know right there were lack of materials to to to rebuild immediately these houses the next picture please so in another house of a brother only this dining table was left with the some plates and Spoon and the rest of the house the it was just blown away by the wind m and uh uh again the the the the brothers they have no place to stay in so if you can see this table during night time they have to sleep under the table they have to sleep they the owner of this place have at least four children and the parents and you can just imagine how can they can they stay under the table just to keep them you know safe and uh a little a little bit comfortable and yeah and they have their them the the Ducks there you can sew the Ducks and the chicken there and those the next picture please uh oh so so this what we have done as we I said this the initial response we sent financial assistance but at that point in time it was not actually practical because uh they they they there's no use for the money you cannot buy anything there's no stores all everything was destroyed so even you have ,000 in your hand you cannot buy anything this is an example that you know when this time comes when money has no value at all of course we we were able to use the financial assistance maybe a week later then we we have to there should have to be the distribution of food and water there are local Pastors in that in that area that we were able to to contact and uh they were the ones going to the to the remote places that we cannot even go there because uh there was no airport available Transportation was not available and we are far from them and um they had to have medical assist distance because you know people the especially the children they're you know cough and colds because of the extreme WEA extreme change of the weather very hot in the morning very cold in the evening no clothes to wear and some um you know there they need some anti- tetanos uh vaccine because of what's Happening you know and mosquito bites and uh because of that we decided to evacuate the brothers and sisters because it's not a livable place anymore that's in late so some of the people they they just want to stay because they're they're using the mountains they don't want to go down but some of the people living in in the city they we we try to tell them there's no way that you can live here for the next maybe 7 days or two weeks so we have to evacuate them we have to rent cars I mean U uh not cars but U uh you know big uh this this U like gyes that we have in the Philippines to to to bring them into a safer location where there's a h uh you know good house but there was no electricity over all the islands so no electricity and uh food was was so scarce and water was you know uh you when you go there there's Panic buying everywhere and there was looting happening all around so for example I am I am one of the looters and I bring it home then the another looter will go to my home to loot my own home and so you have to fight everybody and when we go there this the dangerous thing because when we go there and they they know that we are not from that place right then we they sometimes they would stop you they they would they would see what you have if you have food or you water you have money they would like to it's not actually rubbing but you know as I said it is already survival see so uh we had uh need there there was a need to rent some houses for the families who were evacuated and we have to mobilize um different teams doing the relief efforts we cannot do everything so we have to ask the brothers and the sisters who volunteered their help to to do those things going back and forth to the affected areas and uh even the brothers and I mean even the volunteers after a few weeks or a few days of doing this they got sick themselves because you'll be walking on the streets with all the dead bodies see there no nobody can pick up the dead body because even C bugs are out of out of stock and they they're just there with all the Flies and everything and there's no food and uh you know some little children not children of the Believers they will if uh they find maybe a fallen banana from a a banana from the Fallen trees just laying beside the the the dead bodies they have to get it and eat it you know because they need to survive they need to survive and so you can I mean the the the the smell of the dead bodies of of people the dead bodies of the dogs the goats all together so it was not a healthy place to go to right just to breathe the air there's not health at all see so but but I mean the the the group of Believers the volunteers that are there I mean because of the love and their concern for their brothers they they had to do it they had to do it and we were contacting them and the moment that we were able to to to board the plane we flew to to to some of these areas in the so that was for the initial response for the second phase in the next slide please uh we had the rebuilding of the houses and the churches because we want we don't want them to stay you know with no roof with no anything so we started the the purchase and the hauling of construction materials but this was very hard because uh everybody was rebuilding their houses and so you can only if even you have the money you let's say you can only buy a kilo of nails not nothing more than that so it that that is what uh prolonged the the construction uh uh efforts and because there was no uh electricity all over the land and so we had to purchase the generator sets and even change so to to cut their own wood and we gathered volunteers to to help in the construction so brother Nestor and myself and brother Danny we just go back and forth to these areas or sometimes if we cannot fly there we just we just uh uh communicate with them but uh this the brothers in in this areas they have to go to a certain location where there will be uh what do you call this the the signal for the cell phone because every post they they just fell off and uh there was no electricity so there was no battery for the cell phones so there's a single place there that they have to you know to fall in line the whole day just to just to charge your phone for a few minutes and then go to a a certain location where there will be a signal but when they go back to their home there no signal at all so it's it's where so I we we decided that we we need to go to that place we cannot just uh rely on telephone and much more in Internet see so we we we we had to go there and you know we we just we just have to to dress the way the people dress there so they will not suspect us of having you bringing money so I was uh in one of the trips there I was with my Deacon and we have some a cash on on a hand and I told him just let's separate and U put some in your socks put some in your pocket yeah so if anybody goes to to get what we have then we will there's be some some remaining see and of of course the government are doing their part but you know how the government moves it's it's a little bit slow you know okay they they take time you know they take time doing that there's not no that that there's no actual concern and so uh what we did is the repair of the partially damaged houses and churches and the rebuilding of the totally washed out houses and uh of course the they need to to continue their worship to the Lord you know so they have they we we provide for the Bibles and if that happen the the typhoon happened on Wednesday on on Saturday the Sunday they of course now but there were there was no church any anyway so Wednesday they started worshiping the Lord again amen even after this catastrophe they started worshiping the Lord because they're still alive you know I mean they survive amen the next uh phase uh the next phase would be the phase three this is the restoration of the livelihood we we are not uh we we we it is not our objective to you know to make them Rich we our only objective is to give them a head start right just to start with the with anything any source of income that they might have because some of them are farmers some of them are fishermen so uh with with all this with what happened to the land of course if you plant something you have the Harvest will be the next few months and the fishes and I mean the the the ocean I don't think it's still you would not like to to fish in an ocean where there are many dead bodies yeah and so we it will take a little bit of time so if they cannot go back to their former source of livelihood where we're studying if they if they can we we can introduce some new source of livelyhood that will be applicable in their uh specific or respective location okay so the next slide will be show some pictures of what we have already done this is L Province this the most devastated uh place the the capital of this is is called Tacloban uh we have a good good testimony here in the next slide please so this brother Nestor here I work with him brother Danny over there yeah and this the pastor here brother buuy Africa so that was the time that we went there and we were Distributing this uh dialect Bibles for them so uh uh I mean that in at that point in time they they they're slowly recovering already so brother boou Bo Africa is very uh is very thankful for uh for all the for all the help that he that they received the next slide please so this is the the church building of brother Buu Africa the testimony here is that on a Friday night that brother in the middle he called for his congregation around 70 of them and he was calling to let's stay in the let's stay in the church because their houses are not made of concrete only the church is made of concrete so they they they they believe that it will be much safer for them to stay in the H and they they scheduled the prayer meeting on overnight prayer meeting while the super tyen is coming they wanted to to spend their time uh praying and uh during the time the the roof was still intact and uh around 2: in the morning to 3:00 in the morning the the winds the strong winds start howling and you know you can they can hear the shouting of the people outside and the rushing of the strong waves and uh they can see from the window that uh people were running it it was like they they were in the Noah's Ark and everyone everything's happening out outside and so they just kept on praying and praying even the children were were crying until daylight and then the pastor brother bu he went out he found out that uh uh many was devastated I mean around them and uh one of the the people uh the government official that was there they were asking were you not uh uh affected by the The Surge which is around 30 ft high and said we're all intact but the next just the next block I mean the I mean in in the the in the next street there was a hospital there around a three story hospital and and the water the ocean water just reached the second floor killing so many people and it was just if it's if the church is here it's just maybe a building away and what they cannot explain is because they're all in ground the same ground level right but not a single drop of the ocean water touched the house amen and while I mean while the ocean was surging they were praying amen and it's just kind of just you know I don't know how they did it but uh the water just split in half and uh spared the Church of course because of the wind the the the roof has to be removed already it was damaged but everybody the 70 Believers inside they all surviv amen nobody was injured nobody died and uh uh they were rejoicing immediately after they were crying and rejoicing at the same time because when they when they went out the church they saw their houses were already gone but they're still alive and the church was still there praise the Lord amen praise the so it's a powerful testimony there and I mean when when the pastor here was went to to Manila to to report it he was literally crying in tears I mean I mean he he could not believe what had happened but they know that it was the hand of God that protected them in that uh very uh difficult situation the next slide please uh so these are just the houses that uh that's the before and after some some the house that's partially damaged now uh as you can see in the next pictures houses are just the basic the W the the roof the walls we we we are not trying to build some fancy houses because uh we just want to keep them uh in a good shape at least to be safe from the rain and the Sun so that was totally damaged house now they're rebuilding that next picture please so again they they lived intents for a while but uh now the the house these houses at at this point in time are almost finished now amen so the next please so these are one of the finnished houses uh this on the side of the mountains you cannot you cannot bring up the concrete there because it's uh that's the the brother Nester says light material is better than that in in those areas he's he's an engineer by profession so he knows what he he he's the one directing these things this is another this the the the the brother over there is the past the pastor that we contacted is going back and forth about about 3 hours motorcycle ride back and forth because you cannot bring four-wheels and uh he he should stop in a certain point and just walk his way because even the motorcycles cannot pass through the dead bodies and uh I mean 5 days going back and forth he got terribly sick because of all you know inhaling all the and everything and uh but he kept on going there until today just to make sure that the houses are built and the we finish everything by the by the end of March the next uh next slide please so this is another house for for this family of Believers here um again light materials the next please another house that was built was finished next picture please there another house that was finished here this is almost the same uh these are in in different places but uh they they they build almost the same materials so that that that Pastor is also a carpenter so he know he he's helping he's helping so as much as as much as all the Believers can help they they do what they can do this in another province in cibu which which was also affected uh next slide please so this old sister she lost most of the walls of the house now in this area it is better according to brother nessar is there in the checkered shirt it's better to have the concrete because it's this is near the seashore yeah so that's what we did here we we we we we rebuilt the house uh using hollow blocks and the next picture please another house that was partially damaged the the roof was taken off the windows were taken off was destroyed so it was just replaced the next picture please so this brother lost the the the walls and the the roof of the CH the the house and so it has it's now finished it's it's it has been replaced so brother nestar was the one going back and forth there to take charge of we we kind of divide ourselves into the islands because we cannot just focus on one Island so we we we just go around brother Danny is doing that also the next picture please so this is the church in bugo SIU which was totally destroyed nothing was left and uh after you know after rebuilding this how it looks like now so they're back uh back to the normal uh uh place that they the same place but uh you know they they rebuilt everything the next picture uh this is one of the churches that was totally only one wall was remained standing and so this pastor here he has a uh uh I mean he has some relatives also in another country that uh helped him so instead of just building a small one they they put together the funds that they were able to get and they built a more higher ceiling using steel trashes because they're very near the seashore and in case another typhoon come it it will be much stronger than the other the next picture please so here is in capis Province next slide please so this the one that the one with the snakes are under so now the their house being rebuilt but now that's already finished uh next picture please so this another that you can see in the other side that it was totally destroyed so when I went here this how it looks like but now according to the pastor there it's already finished so you see how small their children are that house is partially damaged now it has been repaired and we have put on new walls on the sides second uh so this another family that has uh the one with the dining table Yeah you see a while ago so now they have their own house again back back to normal yeah so now they they don't have to sleep under the the the table okay next please so this another house that was damaged and uh now this house is already finished they have already the walls in it next picture this is the side of the Church of the church in capis it was already standing there before the typhoon but uh it was not uh uh finished there was no waterproofing so when the the winds came and it just uh water damaged uh the inside of the church so now they're trying to put some finishing on it and uh again and uh these are brothers working helping each other to to rebuild it okay next slide please next uh this another province in this brother here in the middle his parents are not Believers and he's always being persecuted by because they're Catholics and they joined he he he went to the message and uh after the tyon their house was totally damaged except for this they just put a makeshift uh just to protect them from the heat of the Sun and uh his father over there was asking help from the Catholic church but uh never never receive know even one peso to help them live by and so when brother Dany uh went there I mean he also sent money I went there and uh this is uh what happened the next slide please so they're starting to build a concrete uh house in the in the place and so the father was wondering because uh at first he was persecuting you know the brothers because they they he feels that his son was stolen from from their faith yeah and now when he saw the love and the concern of the brothers and sisters knowing that the the financing here even came from other countries they you know he had a change of attitude towards the Believers and now he's starting to attend the service amen so it has it has an effect even in the spiritual life the people this and the next picture is another brother in that area his father is not here and uh he his father's always also persecuting him because of you know leaving the church and when when the typhoon happened and their house was totally destroyed the father said we were cursed because you received that message but when when the brothers from the message just started helping their house you know he he felt different and you know he started talking to the pastor and he started uh listening to the testimonies and everything and later on he started attending the Bible said now the father is already baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ amen so so sometimes the Lord has to do some things you know we cannot understand it but but he does things in in a very odd ways the next picture this a couple near the seashore lost everything and the ne the next slide would show uh this now their house the background this is the pastor over there amen so even the pastors are very thankful uh I know the the way that uh they receive all the help and the next slide maybe have three more pictures here this antia province this The House of the pastor he lost everything now the testimony here for two years because his the the place of the post of his house is being eaten by termites already and he doesn't have some money know to to to to replace it and so he was this is his testimony was always praying for two years he puts it in the into a prayer request that he needs uh you know uh he praying for God's provision to to to to replace the post and two years later this super typhoon came destroyed everything and he said Lord I I was asking for a new post and what you said is sent is a super typhoon destroyed even not only the post but everything so he was so hopeless he he he he was already planning to to to leave that place the church is just behind the church and so when when we when I went there uh uh I talked to him and uh uh just studied the extent of the damage and when when when help came we rebuilt the house and this is the next picture please so the house now complete he has he has his three daughters and said now I understand this was my answered prayer the Lord has to send typhoon so my post can be replaced and not only the post it was the whole house you know and so the next picture this is just beside the house it's like the room of of the three daughters and it's it's made of bamboos and and nepot it that's the normal uh the materials that they use in those places and so uh it was to the good thing here is before before it caved in they were able to move to the church building otherwise the these three daughters could have died so now it's this how it looks like now we just uh replace it and when when I ask the brother you would you like to to use some you know um better materials like concrete he said no he said uh there are others who need the help we don't want to take it all so just just bring back what what was there before so you can see that the attitude of the people they they don't want to take advantage they could have asked for more maybe you say brother Vernon make us a concrete you know house so it will be it will be more stronger and everything but they they have the thinking that uh uh in their minds that they they know that other believers are also in need and instead they I we cannot give them anything but we can if we will just get our own share we're contented with with having bamboos and everything and we know that God will protect this bamboo amen and so there you can see the smile in their faces how how they're happy to have to have like their little room there and the next is the just the church partially damaging the ceiling but uh so it was repaired now so now the next slide or the last picture the uh I mean everything is now fixed and uh it's all right now so again these brothers are very thankful for for all the things that uh I have there are so many pictures yet but we cannot show it everything but we are planning to send all the 200 more than 250 house all the pictures of it by April if it's be it will be finished and sent to all who has has given out for this uh or donated for this efforts as we were studying the list uh brother Nestor myself and brother Danny there uh of course uh this church under Brother Sam has given a big amount to to help us in in this uh expenses uh we we needed around 12.9 million pesos uh which of course is uh uh big on our on our side but uh Believers from Ukraine Russia US Canada Germany New Zealand Australia I mean from all over South Africa they just sent even from India India a country that is as poor as ours but uh they they also send so what what the bigger picture we see that uh it's not just uh this is a group of a body of Believers helping one another having burden from one for one another and it just manifested the love for the bride and so again in behalf of the Filipino Brethren that were affected and all those who exerted also their efforts because it's not we're not the only ministers who were doing that there are other local ministers were doing their own uh efforts and uh again we we plan to finish everything by April put them back on their feet and then from there just just continue and as I was telling brother Samuel I I plan to go there maybe in April or maybe early may just to because we normally conduct medical Mission we have a doctor in our church and brother Samuel knows her he she's been uh M uh you know she's always ready to to do this medical Mission uh volun arily and so we when we were doing those uh those medical Mission earlier she she buys the medicine herself and you just give it out for free for this uh you know um brothers and sisters especially this small children so I took the initiative I I I ask for volunteers from our church and we put in some money together to buy to so we can be able to buy these medicines and when I as soon as I get back to the fil we will be scheduling a flight and maybe go to this areas and uh again it's it's not a uh uh it's not an outing that you go there I mean and the the the place is not uh very good it's it's good it's a good place because there are believers there but uh I mean like at this point in time it's you better stay in the city but uh I mean because of the love for concern for the brethen we will be doing that when I get back so we ask for your prayers and uh we we hope to finish this by everything by end of April and everything will be back to normal before another super typhoon comes amen and so that's that's about uh I would like to report to you and um uh as brother Samuel has mentioned that I tell the the other donors we will be accounting every single dime that we we receive because we want to be we are stewards of the M of this blessings we don't own it it I mean without you we we are just part of this team that is doing the relief efforts you are a big part of the team but there's there's somebody who has to do the leg work and some we we can't even do the leg work so we we tap the other believers there so again uh God has anointed everyone in the in the in the entire body of Christ to for this single effort and it has manifested the love of God so again thank you for everyone God bless you all and so uh I would like to invite you for a while just to to just to uh read a couple of scriptures just to just to make uh maybe a few minutes just to add exhortation to to what we have discussed and uh Clos this in prayer amen i' would like uh if uh I have a slide a slider maybe not show every slides and everything there but just to close this with the word of exhortation in in Isaiah 55:6 it says there seek ye the Lord while he may be found call ye upon him while he is near let the wicked forsake his way and unrighteous man his thought his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have mercy upon him and to our God he will abundantly pardon for my thoughts are not your thoughts neither your ways are my ways say the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways are higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts let's have a word of prayer our gracious Heavenly Father how with thank you for your words we thank you Lord for everything that you have done in order to connect each and every believer in the world Lord for a single effort Lord that that is meant Lord to to Bear one another's burden Lord and we thank you for the love and the concern of the congregation here that's led by our precious brother Samuel Dale Lord and uh Lord the his ministers here the elders Lord uh we their help to us Lord has been of great blessing and we pray that you bless them in return in many ways that you can oh God and as we speak your word I pray that you just encourage us Lord to do more for you we cannot understand your ways we cannot understand your thoughts Lord we're so limited but your your you are an unlimited God lord and we pray that you will reveal continuously yourself to us as we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen praise the Lord may not be seated amen and so uh we have read in this scriptures that uh our thoughts are not the thoughts of God and our ways are not his ways and sometimes things happened and uh we cannot really understand what's happening or why is it happening see especially in a time of of catastrophe as as that and even if you are a Believer you you will be left you know thinking why does it us to happen to us we are all believing the same God and uh you know your trials here are different from our trials there but nevertheless we we will have to to to stand all those these trials and now in the in the in the slides here I just like to uh to to read a qu a quote in the Mighty God unveiled amen if you can put up please the the slide it says here back in the Old Testament we find out that God veiled himself for unbelievers God is a very oddway dealing with people he hides himself from the unbeliever and rebuilds himself to the believer and so we can we we can look at a certain uh thing and we can have two different thoughts like for example the Pharaoh was looking in one window and he saw all he saw was a group of M dubbers slaves but when Moses by revelations look at the same window what he saw was a chosen people of God and people can can listen to the same message one will get the Revelation the other has no effect on him but but that's the way God does his things the Bible says I'm the God and the I change not so it works according to brother bam it works in the same principle all the time amen so our faith is dependent on the Revelation that God gives you right our faith cannot go higher than what was revealed to us right and the the prophet said faith is a revelation see and uh our mind is so unlim is so limited amen the said God is uh God is infinite see again in in in this quote that I I want to read this quote again uh in the in the message we would see uh Jesus he said now remember we are finite our minds are finite God is infinite and infinite is perfect God knew the end from the beginning then you would say why would he permit sickness I will ask you this question which was first a savior or a sinner a savior and which as first said uh a Healer or sickness and of course the sick the the Healer comes first yes so God permitted it that he might uh project his love and power to the to the to the people see so when I when we we went to these areas we have to explain this over and over again to the people because they have heard this message but once you are in the middle of that trial it's a totally different thing you can memorize this quotation memorize it by heart have it in your mind you can you can even preach it but once you are experiencing it right there it's a totally different thing you you you have to you have to have the the the you have to Anchor yourself in the Lord Jesus Christ otherwise all this memory codes and the it will be gone right right it will beun and some of the people I mean the Believers there they they they were saying that uh I mean they were they were just saying that uh they they just they just want to go away and then you know but but of course that's that's where the the five-fold ministry comes in they have to encourage the people and I mean even the fivefold ministry they were affected you see the pastor lost his house and the the first when I was talking to the pastor his first struggle was how can I uh encourage somebody when I the one is needs encouragement yeah see and so when he when they started to know that many brothers or sisters are are concerned for uh in their in their state and their condition it it I mean it was it had a great impact on theirselves and uh it it just helped them so but we need the storms in life there there's these are literally storms but we have storms in our life we cannot evade it we we we we don't have a choice actually but uh whether we like it or not we have to face it see I I I will just read a couple more quotations then uh maybe I'll close on this uh in the message uh the ark okay he said Noah wouldn't have any victories wouldn't have been storms and trials if there's just put through a little safe tunnel to run through there's no joy he says is the storms of life it what makes us have the joy see but but you see some sometimes you cannot comprehend but I mean before during just immediately after the storm the people in in those places they you cannot sense any joy in their faces but you see after a week and they saw the bigger picture that's what we need to see the bigger picture so God is doing something and then we know he says he says here we'd never know the daylight was less we had some dark we'd never know what a Hilltop L there was a mountain we'd never know what good health was unless we had some sickness see and so all these things my brothers and sisters it's it's like what brother bam said about the law of contrast you have to see this things you have to experience these things so can we we can appreciate what we have sometimes we Things become so common and we can we don't we don't want I mean we are thankful but there there's really not a a a touch of deep gratitude on what we are enjoying but once these are taken away then you will have to treasure every inch of possession that you have every relationship that you have we we we just have we have a we just have a a a family in our church that lost their mother and uh I mean they're very young around 42 years old and sometimes I was talking to the brother and he he was saying how how how he missed his wife and you know he he started to say to tell me that uh now he he has seen the importance of you know having a Godly wife and uh you know going home home there your wife is waiting for you but all those years I mean things became so common so common and well things around you can get so common but as I heard some other somebody preaching about this message should not be common in us because this the message is not something that uh uh is it is something that will prepare us for the Rapture see and all the afflictions that are happening to us I mean we are in a third world country country and these things natural disasters are happening and I don't have I don't have any intention whatsoever to leave the country what where I was raised because I believe that God has placed us there for a Ministry we we need to be there we need to be to be helping our people and uh uh if you're not from that place you may say just simply go away and just leave in Another Place Another better place but I said that's the best place for me because that's where God placed me I I would not go in other places you know just uh uh some people say you have to get out of my comfort zone but that is my comfort zone where typhoons are and every day if I live in a place where there's no typhoon that's not my place right amen I I I'm born for the disaster and I mean and I and I I I I I God gave us something to to withstand everything that we have and so I was encouraging the brothers I was encouraging the sisters and I was encouraging those who were affected and now I mean after a few just just a few you know Filipinos are very resilient when you say resilient they they they just take advantage of what is at hand they they they look for more but of course you know people there's always mixed people you know there are those who take advantage there are those who who really are in need and that's why when I was coordinating with the brothers uh you know this help trying to help I I I would say brother Nestor brother Danny and myself we were just uh having these meetings and everything just to screen every uh request that's are coming in just to make sure that uh this these are not the things that uh you know being because there will be opportunist that will come out they will abuse the help they will so we don't want that to happen because if that happens then that's our stewardship we will be accountable for that and uh so we have to to to talk to the ministers to talk to the brothers and to explain to them because you know there's all some some of them would think that you know this this money coming in are just are just coming out of the abundance of the pockets of the Believers but as we know and uh uh having traveled in some places I know that there are other brothers and sisters who who get out of their way just to to to send some help for these third world countries and so we have really to explain it to them and sometimes when you explain it to them it doesn't it's not easy because it's a mindset they have a different mindset and you have to change that mindset and to explain to them and so any everything that is happening to us I I I believe in my in my own heart that God is allowing these things to happen because he's molding a character in us righten we God is not the business of character molding and and and and as the the scripture says the more the the Hebrews were Afflicted the more they increased they did not decrease when afflictions were coming they increased in number and spiritually speaking as we as we are afflicted we pass through these troubles we pass through this uh uh Temptations and everything the more our faith is increased amen the the people in in the Philippines they're worshiping the Lord before the typhoon but after the typhoon you could you could have seen the way they worshiped in those places it has more substance they're not worshiping in a way that uh um the worship is is with more substance because they experience the hand of the Lord as as as as I was saying in Genesis chapter 1 we chapter 2 we can read that uh that Mo that Adam was a worshipper he worships the Lord amen but after the fall see when he and you know we were made to worship god he has a purpose the purpose one of the purpose that God created is for us to Worship the Lord see amen and and Angels were created to worship Him and the Angels were worshiping saying holy holy holy is the Lord they cannot say Lord you are our healer because the Angels never got sick they can say that uh the Angels cannot say that the the the Lord is is the Lord of Salvation because they were never lost but we have experienced this God has allowed these things to happen in our lives so when we worship the Lord amen there's more substance we're not saying that we're better off than the Angels but the Angels cannot worship the way we can worship because after the things that we have passed on we passed through we after the things that we have experienced in our life every trouble that we came through over and we overcame uh there's another level of worship that we do if if you are in need the way you pray at a time that compar it to a time that you are praying with not so much need your prayer is not that fervent right but if you are in need of something maybe somebody's sick in your house or maybe you are in need of some material things and you really need it so that you you you'll pray fervently but without those needs amen without those trials we can just you know say a word of prayer and that's it but I I can guarantee you my brothers and sisters when these families were were eating what was left the the the prayer just for a single meal amen just for a single meal you can hear the fervency of prayer how thankful they are for a for a simple meat and maybe simple fruit and uh just a glass of water for the whole family because there were no no more water around no more food around and whatever was left behind I mean in there was no refrigerator there was no cupboard or whatever what was what was left in their baskets or whatever they they were so thankful for that and God just multiplied all these things because he saw the he saw the heart of the people and sometimes God has to put put us in that kind of situation to put us into that kind of condition so we can express the the substance of worship we can worship of course we will not ask the Lord to give us those trials but he knows what to do he knows how to bring out the best in us on how can we can worship him and so you are we are thankful that you're very comfortable here and we are thankful in other churches that they're comfortable there and we are thankful in our in our country because uh things of like this sort to happen because I know the Lord is doing something for us I mean we have freedom of religion in in in the Philippines if you go to China you have to hide to preach but uh again we have I would say as I I say in Cloverdale we have different trials but the intensity is always the same I don't know about your trials here but I know you're you're also being tried and tested by the Lord molding your character and here's we we in our country are experiencing the same and every time we we go into these trials and overcome this then we we we we upgrade in the next Lev level then we upgrade in the next level until we reach that stature of a perfect man where we can say that uh we have everything that God do more us want purpose us to be and so it's very important my brothers and sisters to have this substance of worship and we can only get this I mean not not to to of course you have to study to meditate on the word and the message but God will give us situations conditions you know it may affect our health it may affect our relationship it may affect even our walk with the Lord but it is in these times that we can really manifest what is inside of our heart if there's no seed in there we'll just go away that explains how many message Believers have been in the message for many many years many many years and then one just some something happened and takes place and they just leave yeah they just leave the message it will always start okay it will always start in like for example this a certain person will just say something against the ministry but it also evolves from the ministry then you say something against the church right see and if it's left uh unnoticed then he will start saying something against the message then after the message he will say something against the prophet and the last thing he will say something many or many things against God right but it starts in simple thing something against the ministry or something about the the the church manage but it's kind of a spirit that crawls into every Church see and we have to be very very careful On th those things because uh I mean the prophet said uh he will not allow you know the the churches to be to loving one another he will the the the the prophet said God would allow you know Spirit you know just just to sit down there it's not a person even a person it's a spirit that crawls into every Church whether in the US or in the Philippines it happens all the time but I I said when this things happen like this catastrophe then you can just see the unity of the brothers and sisters you will know what's in the hearts of the people you they're con they're concerned for for the well-being of the people we know that this is just uh we're passing just to in in this earth and uh we will leave everything behind but while we are here on Earth you know we have to help one another we have to to to be praying for one another we have to think of other people not only for ourselves I was telling to to our congregation we are blessed because we are in the city we are blessed because we are not uh affected by the typhoon but I was as I was telling them we cannot just go home and take a rest brother Samuel has been in our church we're we're having a services in in a five star hotel we're just renting out but uh I mean it's very comfortable we can just stay there and pray there and just let's say we we'll just pray for the Brethren that's all and that's nothing bad about it you just pray and you send money but but I we had the burden we have to go there we have to fly over there we have to see the people there we have to stand side by side with shoulder toh shoulder with them and you know the impact of of what we did there and what you have done to help us to be able to do that I mean we did we did not just restore their houses we restored even their spiritual life we have restored their spiritual life amen and so again uh in behalf of the Filipino people I uh I I would like to say that uh things would not have happened the way it would would have happened if not for your help if not for your prayers we were just trying to compare the efforts of the United Nation because they were also helping the Filipino people and brother Nest was taking pictures and I mean the the United Nations they can only give small tents for the people and compared to what the Believers around the world that has done we were able to build houses finished houses for the people and so the go even the government were asking where are you people getting your money maybe you have a big organization or something maybe you you belong to a big denomination that would support when he said we don't have a the headquar we don't have a denomination but we have brothers and sisters all around the world who are concerned for for the people in the Philippines and they they are just wondering until today they cannot imagine that you know people just send the money just like that with no bureaucracy or whatsoever and just receive this and uh I mean uh just build the houses without no no strings attach or whatsoever and for us it's easy to do but for the others I mean they they until this time they are thinking it over and so we are thankful that our brothers and sisters they're not queuing the line asking for food they have their own food because we have put food in the in their table we are not uh the our CH the children of our brothers and sisters there they're not scattered in the streets you know Scavenging for food they have their own food already amen they have their own clothes they they're they're now under a roof and so if they can just you know just uh everybody if you can just just listen to their testimony you can you'll be touched by the way they express it and uh and just can imagine everything was wiped out and now they're back to normal so again God bless you and thank you for this opportunity to have uh to to be with you and to have spoken in front of you God bless you let's let's all bow our heads in prayer Our precious loving father we thank you Lord for the love that you have shed abroad in our hearts Lord we could have not done this if not for your love loving kindness to all of us you did it first Lord that's why we're just manifesting the love and the concern that you have for us Lord we thank you for the Blessed opportunity Lord to be able to do good to to them that are part of the household of faith oh God because this is your word and we're just following it oh God may you bless Lord all the con the members of this congregation Lord bless the ministers Lord who have have endeavored Lord to to carry out this message and to bring it not only here but even to other countries oh God you have given them the the blessing Lord to spread out the word to be a helping hand Lord as the prophet said Lord his one of his intention is to make life a little bit better for the Brethren and evidently this congregation has done that many times in many places not only in the Philippines but I know that they they have done Mission Works in in different parts of the world and so Lord we're just thankful that we were able to connect with them and um we are just stewards of your manifold blessings oh God we cannot boast of anything that we have done we we cannot boast of any accomplishment Lord what we can say is just Lord you have given us this this privilege to work within your body of Christ Lord and for that we bring back to you the honor the glory the Praises and the Thanksgiving in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen God bless you all [Applause] amen can you say amen amen was great to see what you know God can do because he can use people and that's that's the way we're supposed to be right amen you know put your lags on your on the gospel go out put it out there and see you say well I I can't do that well that's we we can't go but we can help somebody else go and you know when we get over on the other side it still ain't going to be no big eyes little you it's going to be all of what he done through the bride of Christ we really appreciate these brothers there CU we know them all you know and they really over the years have learned a love them and learn to trust them and knowing that what they do and how they go and everything like that and see it's it's hard to send money to a a foreign field a lot of times because you you don't know what you're sending it to you know in everything it's just that's just the way it is because it's human beings but when you know you got somebody there that you can say okay this is the way it is you know and they'll do that you know that's a brother in Christ amen amen that's a really let's just sing a song if anybody has a need 539 in spiral remember what we'll be doing this afternoon then is receiving an offering for the brother you know for the brothers there to use and all in in the work of the Lord so remember that this afternoon if you want to make out a check or anything make it out to the church and just put on it what it [Music] is let's make it out to the church we'll take care of it and be given to [Music] them in me heart oh and spirit Within Me Be not away [Music] take Holy Spirit restore to the Joy Sal and right Within Me cre in me a clean heart oh [Music] God and your right Spirit within me create in me a clean heart oh God and renew our spirit Within Me cast me not away [Music] from take not [Music] holy restore unto to me the joy of Sal and you know we can't all go and be missionaries but we can all have a little bit to do with it what does it matter who was it Moody that the the the lady just rented a building yeah and hired a preacher to come cleaned up a barn thing or something and going to have a meeting had one person come well she probably died thinking she was a failure cuz she probably thought I was led of the Lord to do this you know and she probably passed on thinking she was a failure but yet Dwight Moody you know what everyone that he preached to amen she gets the crowd right she gets the crown because she done what she was supposed to do and see that's all we can do we've been there we've seen things they're wonderful people and they do the best they can do that's and they don't complain that's right they they take it and move on and this storm come through and they proed it they take it they get right back up and go but you got to have brothers like these that'll go and do that but you got to have people that got money in their pocket and they can give it and the Lord can bless so if you have anything it's like I said if you want to ride out a check Rite it to the church then you get it off your taxes and then we just give it over to them and don't you
