[14:23] because he does have uh he said we're
[14:26] very small uh amount of postate cancer

[14:32] give him the treatments you know of the
[14:34] needles or what you call it and stuff
[14:36] like that and got that done so he said
[14:38] they was just to keep praying for it he
[14:41] said that was the main thing all right
[14:43] uh brother Donnie something you was
[14:45] going to say
[14:48] about problem break right there was
[14:52] somebody tried to break into one of
[14:53] their one of their stores broke into it
[14:56] but uh nothing no problems or nothing so
[14:59] that's where brother Mark is this
[15:01] morning trying to get all of that
[15:03] straightened out okay all right so
[15:06] Hebrews 12 and John
[15:09] 3 Heavenly Father we thank you for this
[15:12] day and your love and your grace unto us
[15:14] we thank you for Calvary thank you for
[15:16] all things and we just ask you Lord to
[15:18] be with us today as we try to speak
[15:22] about you and to meditate upon the
[15:24] things that you would bring to our
[15:26] remembrance from the scriptures and the
[15:28] things Lord Lord that we have heard that
[15:29] we may be able to try to put those
[15:32] things into the right perspective of
[15:35] where we're living or the hour that
[15:36] we're here and we pray that you would
[15:39] just do as you said you would do you
[15:41] promised it so we can depend on it that
[15:44] you said you'd come on the scene and
[15:46] bring your word and that you would heal
[15:48] us and Deliver Us from destruction have
[15:51] your way Lord and just guide each one
[15:53] and bless Lord in Jesus name amen all
[15:57] right Hebrews 12
[16:01] 12 1 and
[16:04] 2 wherefore seeing you also are
[16:07] compassed about with so great a cloud of
[16:08] witnesses let us lay aside every weight
[16:11] and the sin which does so easily beset
[16:13] us let us run with patience the race
[16:16] that is set before us looking unto Jesus
[16:19] the author and finisher of our faith who
[16:21] for the joy that was set before him
[16:23] endured the cross despising the shame
[16:26] and is sat down at the right hand of the
[16:29] Throne of God now let's go to John
[16:32] because we're going to be hitting this a
[16:34] little bit so let's go to
[16:37] John uh
[16:39] three and 16 is a very familiar verse
[16:42] with all of us right amen for God so
[16:45] loved the world that he gave his only
[16:46] begotten son that whosoever believeth in
[16:49] him should not perish but have
[16:52] everlasting life for God sent not his
[16:54] son into the world to condemn the world
[16:56] but the world through him might be saved
[16:58] now here's a verse we want to get to he
[17:00] that believeth on him is not
[17:03] condemned all right now that's hold that
[17:06] point but he that believeth not is
[17:09] condemned
[17:11] already he don't have to go to judgments
[17:14] he don't have to do anything there will
[17:17] be a judgment there will be a time but
[17:20] there won't be no court of appeal right
[17:23] why because of what he's doing
[17:26] see all right but but he that believeth
[17:29] not is condemned already because he ha
[17:31] not believed in the name of the only
[17:33] begotten Son of God you may be seated to
[17:36] Lord at his Blessing to the reading of
[17:38] the word now what I want to do is kind
[17:42] of tie in with something
[17:46] that uh you know make sure you
[17:49] understood what I was trying to bring um
[17:52] last Sunday and then uh you know go on
[17:56] into maybe a little bit deeper into what
[17:59] our thought was but if you remember what
[18:02] we were trying to talk about Sunday was
[18:06] what is the worst sin that you can think
[18:10] of and see we would say murder we would
[18:13] say uh a rapist uh um you know all kind
[18:18] of things that we would try to uh talk
[18:23] about those things as being but now
[18:27] remember
[18:28] now drinking gambling smoking running
[18:32] around with women
[18:33] murder uh rapist and that's not sin
[18:37] right yeah it is well see that's what
[18:40] you've been taught all your
[18:43] life well you haven't been taught the
[18:45] scriptural
[18:46] form you've been taught that you you you
[18:50] you know the the things and all like
[18:51] you've been taught that that's sin now
[18:54] drinking gambling smoking stuff like
[18:56] that anything you could think of is not
[18:59] sin that's an attribute or a display
[19:02] right now remember even the garden what
[19:05] went
[19:06] first not to
[19:10] act it was first and then she thought
[19:13] you know no it was her thinking and
[19:16] rejecting the word of God that caused
[19:19] her to
[19:21] display right the things that we call
[19:25] sin and I like I told you I guess that's
[19:27] the hardest thing because if you'll look
[19:30] how many times a prophet says it but
[19:33] that was probably the hardest thing for
[19:36] him to
[19:37] explain right amen I I don't believe he
[19:40] had as much trouble on marriage and
[19:42] divorce you know I'm just honest as he
[19:46] did on trying to explain to people about
[19:50] Sin right cuz you remember the L she
[19:53] just couldn't stand it finally she just
[19:54] said brother random what is sin then if
[19:57] you're saying it's not drinking gambling
[20:00] and smoking and so what is it he said
[20:03] it's unbelief
[20:06] amen
[20:08] unbelief he said now the reason you do
[20:11] those
[20:13] things is because you're an
[20:16] unbeliever all right now we're getting
[20:18] it scripturally
[20:20] correct without running it into the
[20:23] wrong point you
[20:27] know and see then uh you're not going to
[20:31] go to
[20:32] hell for lying and cheating and
[20:35] stealing that's just part of your
[20:40] life it's it's not what we
[20:43] think then I want to make sure you
[20:45] follow that
[20:46] point it's not what we we do like that
[20:50] as something will you know look at that
[20:53] person I remember we were down at my
[20:56] mother-in-laws on one day day on a
[20:58] Sunday afternoon
[21:00] and there was some company there and I
[21:02] seemed like I remember when my
[21:03] dad-in-law was sick or something but
[21:06] anyhow uh we were there and outside and
[21:08] some some good religious people was
[21:11] there and I'm not throwing off on them
[21:12] I'm I mean that rightly uh but they were
[21:16] standing out there talking well a
[21:18] neighbor over there you know he just
[21:19] it's on Sunday he just got his lawnmower
[21:21] out and and he just cranked it up and
[21:24] started cutting his G you know boy one
[21:28] of them ladies it was all she could
[21:29] stand she said he's going to die and go
[21:32] to hell for cutting that Grace on
[21:36] Sunday
[21:38] well no he's not going to die and go to
[21:40] hell for cutting grce on
[21:42] Sunday you're not going to die and go to
[21:44] hell for
[21:45] murder rapist anything you're not going
[21:48] to do it for
[21:49] that you're going to die and go to hell
[21:52] because of disbelief right amen cuz what
[21:55] happened to Eve in the
[21:57] garden did not the prophet make the
[21:59] statement he said she failed on one
[22:03] scripture and that used to bother me
[22:05] until it was made known she failed on
[22:08] Hebrews
[22:09] 138 well you know Hebrews 138 wasn't
[22:12] written back
[22:15] there but what is the point of Hebrews
[22:17] 138 that he's the same yesterday today
[22:22] and forever right because that's what
[22:24] it's saying all right see then we talk
[22:27] about sin as
[22:29] being some hideous thing and that's what
[22:33] we've been taught all of our
[22:35] life and then it's hard to
[22:39] Define you know to people to get them to
[22:43] thinking correctly well you think it's
[22:46] all right to go kill steal do I didn't
[22:48] say that may I quote the prophet I'll be
[22:50] glad to find you this one I was reading
[22:52] it
[22:53] yesterday he said you say brother
[22:55] brandom said that guy killed somebody
[22:58] somebody that guy done this or that or
[23:01] the
[23:02] other he
[23:04] said that don't have anything to do with
[23:08] me he said I'm a preacher I'm trying to
[23:12] get him converted AB he said it's up to
[23:15] the law to put him in
[23:17] jail well now what sensible answer would
[23:20] they be for that amen you know the law
[23:23] is to put him into jail all right then
[23:26] he's condemned by the law
[23:31] but you think about
[23:35] it
[23:36] that we try to Define
[23:41] sin and and there is no such thing as a
[23:44] little sin and a big sin so get all that
[23:47] out of your mind see all right and I
[23:50] wasn't trying to express that last
[23:52] Sunday I was trying to express something
[23:55] that I hope would catch on to you as as
[23:58] to your thinking all right because uh
[24:02] you know I've always considered the
[24:05] point what is
[24:08] sin well we're just a bunch of
[24:11] Sinners well then to turn around and the
[24:14] Bible
[24:16] says that if you say you have not
[24:19] sinned you're a
[24:23] liar right and you say if you don't have
[24:26] no sin you're a liar
[24:31] but then it turns around and says he
[24:33] that is born of God sinth not
[24:37] right
[24:39] now to my
[24:42] understanding those are two opposite
[24:44] directions right all right but if they
[24:47] don't come together then we're going to
[24:49] still be as we were back there
[24:52] right and we're going on to Define
[24:56] sin
[24:58] and have a problem out of it all right
[25:01] so now don't misunderstand me as to
[25:03] thinking that I would think everything's
[25:05] all right for us to do this or that or
[25:06] the other no no I I've I've been blunt
[25:10] I've been plain uh you know I I know I'm
[25:14] I'm I'm too plain but I'm blunt you know
[25:19] I mean I've always said you don't have
[25:21] to worry about it here some of you some
[25:24] of you get mistreating your children in
[25:27] the wrong way way I'll turn you into the
[25:30] law now I don't mean a spanking and I
[25:33] don't mean getting you bail out and
[25:34] raising a blister and I don't mean that
[25:37] but if you abuse your children I'll call
[25:39] the law is that plain enough to let you
[25:43] know where I
[25:44] stand that I'm not far it being okay to
[25:47] do this that or the other no but I'm
[25:51] just saying you're not going to die and
[25:52] go to hell for for doing things
[25:55] wrong Jesus said he that
[25:58] believeth not is condemned
[26:03] already all right so then it's not
[26:07] something that we do or don't do right
[26:11] am the ACT Eve done in the Gard was a
[26:14] display of her
[26:15] unbelief but she'd
[26:18] already beli Satan's
[26:23] lie the other was just a dis a display
[26:26] all right so you understand what a
[26:28] prophet would say drink and G and smok
[26:30] and stuff like that it's not sin he said
[26:32] that's a display of unbelief he said you
[26:34] do those things because you don't
[26:37] believe all
[26:40] right and so we put those things in a
[26:44] category and we try to
[26:48] understand then to turn around as I
[26:52] said and we
[26:55] say if we say that we don't have no sin
[26:57] we're
[27:00] liars and I gave you some quotes and
[27:02] we'll read them again in a minute where
[27:03] the Prophet was talking about
[27:06] what a Christian is the only one that
[27:08] can
[27:16] sin because a
[27:18] sinner he just condemned
[27:21] already what he's doing is not sin
[27:24] that's what we look at oh look at that
[27:26] sin out there look at that sin out there
[27:28] about that that prostitute house at that
[27:31] that beer joint that that place and all
[27:33] now we don't agree with all that but
[27:35] that's not those people are just
[27:41] unbelievers but now when we were trying
[27:43] to talk about
[27:46] Christians being the only ones that
[27:48] sined we was not talking about
[27:51] Christians drinking gambling smoking
[27:54] running around with women committing
[27:56] adultery we we've explained that to the
[27:59] point last
[28:00] Sunday that we were not talking about
[28:04] that we were talking about the little
[28:07] everyday life
[28:09] things that we as human beings are
[28:13] caught in those
[28:15] situations and things go
[28:18] wrong because now if you don't
[28:21] understand you say well brother
[28:23] Dale you know like I said Sunday you say
[28:26] well brother Dale you're just so deep
[28:28] you just get into these deep
[28:30] things how much more simple would it be
[28:33] for you to get an understanding that
[28:36] because you stump your toe and say
[28:45] fooy if you're not going to die and go
[28:47] to
[28:50] hell now don't tell me come on I'm human
[28:54] 74 years old okay you said you don't
[28:58] know all of us I'm going to hit every
[29:00] one of us every one of us has got little
[29:04] bitty problems if you don't have a
[29:07] little bitty problem pray for everybody
[29:10] else your problem is you don't know you
[29:13] got a
[29:15] problem
[29:17] amen
[29:18] right you don't know that you are won't
[29:22] admit that you've got a
[29:25] problem all right that's the biggest
[29:27] problem there is why because that's
[29:29] something God can't deal with you know
[29:32] that God can't deal with something that
[29:33] we won't repent
[29:37] of right right he he he can't deal with
[29:41] it why because we won't repent of
[29:44] it but if we'll repent of the Bible said
[29:47] he's just and if we say we don't have no
[29:50] sin why did Paul say that we have an
[29:52] advocate or John there in the
[29:55] scripture well why do you need an
[29:56] advocate if you don't have something
[29:59] wrong but now do you understand what I'm
[30:01] saying we're not talking about that well
[30:04] brother Dale say it's all right for them
[30:05] Christians to commit adultery do this no
[30:08] no no
[30:13] no we're talking about everyday
[30:18] life we're talking about where that the
[30:21] Bible would
[30:26] say
[30:28] that we have
[30:30] sin yet the same Bible would say he that
[30:33] is born of God does not commit sin all
[30:37] right we tried in the denominations to
[30:39] define the word
[30:40] commit and we tried to make it like a
[30:43] something well it was over this way over
[30:45] that way and why not just face it up
[30:51] straight but now for brother brandom to
[30:54] say that we sin every day
[31:02] for brother random to say
[31:04] Paul said I Die
[31:08] daily for Paul to say the things I would
[31:11] not I do and I do not and all are in the
[31:14] scripture then he defines it when he
[31:16] gets down to the end he says with our by
[31:19] with the inward man I serve the law of
[31:21] God right all right so that inward man
[31:25] can't sin because it's born again is
[31:28] that correctly right understanding right
[31:31] but he said but with the flesh I serve
[31:33] the law of
[31:37] sin did Paul say it was all right to go
[31:39] do wrong no he's explaining everyday
[31:43] life he's not explaining adultery
[31:47] fornication no he's explaining simple
[31:51] everyday
[31:54] life is anybody in here today would
[31:57] raise your hand and say CU if you raise
[32:00] it and say I'm going to call you a liar
[32:01] so you ain't going to raise your hand
[32:03] but would anybody say you ain't had a
[32:05] wrong thought
[32:08] today I
[32:10] mean well if if you got a wrong thought
[32:13] you
[32:17] sinned is it wrong to have a wrong
[32:24] thought you see I know that I'm hard in
[32:27] the way that I say things but you think
[32:29] about it you know the devil tempted the
[32:31] Lord Jesus so he had to have the wrong
[32:34] thoughts right that's right did he sin
[32:37] no oh come on
[32:40] then it's not a sin to have a wrong
[32:43] thought it's a sin to entertain the
[32:45] thought you can't help the thought
[32:47] coming but you can help what you do with
[32:50] it that's right
[32:52] right the entertaining of the thought is
[32:55] the
[32:56] problem you can't have what the devil
[32:58] keep shooting into your mind you go
[32:59] crazy as a bat trying to stop it from
[33:01] coming in leave it
[33:05] alone just let it come and say God
[33:07] forgive
[33:08] me but now here's the point don't let it
[33:11] go to where you say well brother brand
[33:14] said it and Paul and brother he's
[33:16] preaching that that it's all right to
[33:19] have him wrong thought I didn't say it's
[33:20] all right to have them I said you're
[33:22] going to have
[33:24] them it's not all right to have them
[33:28] because when you say it's all right to
[33:30] have them then you're you're making
[33:32] it
[33:35] sin
[33:38] right well brother
[33:41] Dale what is
[33:46] sin the Bible
[33:49] says he that believeth not is condemned
[33:53] already
[33:54] amen the prophet said in quoting the
[33:57] scripture where it talks about the sins
[34:00] he said only Christians have
[34:02] sins he said we sin every day
[34:07] right now what sin is he speaking
[34:13] of come on what sin is he speaking
[34:20] of so there must be some
[34:25] things
[34:28] that's not dealing with the finality of
[34:30] understanding what sin really
[34:35] is you can say well the reason those
[34:37] people died there in
[34:41] sin
[34:43] well Jesus died now you well okay he
[34:46] took my okay that's okay I go with you
[34:49] that's all
[34:51] right but brother randam was the one
[34:53] that said we sin every
[34:55] day and Paul said we sin every day and
[34:59] John said we sin every
[35:02] day now what were they talking about
[35:04] that was what I was trying to get to
[35:06] point across
[35:10] Sunday you know that the Bible says
[35:13] anything that is not a
[35:14] faith is s i
[35:18] n eating too
[35:21] much none of us has got that
[35:24] problem and just because Joy is as
[35:27] skinny as a rail she eat like a
[35:31] horse so now we just display
[35:35] it like Esther and need it you know and
[35:39] sister Monica I told a while ago to move
[35:42] over away from the vent downstairs the
[35:44] draw V I said that thing will suck you
[35:46] up to
[35:48] there cuz a lot of people are just
[35:51] naturally skinny but it's not the fact
[35:53] that they don't
[35:55] eat
[35:57] so then they look at us and say y'all
[35:59] eat too much no I look back at them and
[36:01] say hey wait a minute you eat more than
[36:02] I do it's just a manifestation in this
[36:05] thing that makes me fat all
[36:08] right now but just making a
[36:13] point what is
[36:16] sin what would they be that we could
[36:20] comprehend as understanding that would
[36:23] not Place us in a category of being lost
[36:29] cuz the Bible said if we sin willfully
[36:31] after receiving the knowledge of the
[36:32] truth there remaineth no more
[36:37] sacrifice Paul you admit doing wrong yep
[36:41] he was a guy that said
[36:45] it you said sin
[36:53] willfully you know what the prophet said
[36:55] one day he said will even will hopefully
[36:56] do wrong abely knowing we're going to
[37:00] get a
[37:03] whooping I'm not talking about the guy
[37:05] running out in front of him you say do
[37:08] he like I told a man at work one day
[37:11] down there he said people do things like
[37:12] that to me he said I just have to say
[37:14] dirty words I said why don't you say
[37:16] praise the
[37:20] Lord right you got to say
[37:25] something you hit your finger with a
[37:28] hammer and you let out all them
[37:30] four-letter
[37:32] words why don't you say Thank You Lord
[37:34] it didn't bust the
[37:35] thing and turn it totally off why don't
[37:39] you say praise the
[37:42] Lord
[37:44] right might put us in different
[37:47] category I think it's good to be that
[37:51] way you know
[37:53] what who was it
[37:55] um
[37:57] in the war you know who was it Stonewall
[37:59] Jackson he he Saidi never take a drink
[38:02] of water that I don't thank
[38:06] God I dropped something on the ground
[38:08] and I begin to look for
[38:10] it first off I realize it's F down there
[38:15] now there some reason I can't see it
[38:17] like I used to and then the other reason
[38:20] it's down there that I can't bend over
[38:21] and get it all right but that still
[38:24] don't change nothing and I find a screw
[38:27] or something I dropped and I said Thank
[38:28] You Lord thank you
[38:31] Lord devil said I was the one that
[38:33] showed it to you said well thank you for
[38:35] showing it to
[38:39] me you remember the the lady was praying
[38:42] for food and these kids brought it to
[38:44] her and set it on her porch and she was
[38:46] out screaming of Glory Hallelujah the
[38:48] lord gave me some and the kids come up
[38:50] said ah we was one that brought it to
[38:52] you she said Lord thank you for the food
[38:54] and the ones that f it
[38:57] you know the ones that brought it here
[38:59] all
[39:00] right now but what is sin that's what I
[39:03] trying to defined last
[39:06] week the Bible says there is a sin un
[39:09] death that's right and Paul says I say
[39:13] don't pray for him right know that
[39:15] scripture but there's a sin not un
[39:19] death right
[39:23] am so then evidently there's something
[39:26] about this word
[39:29] sin that we need to Define and think
[39:34] about
[39:36] it you
[39:38] know and say
[39:41] well some of the things of
[39:43] Life as we do naturally every
[39:47] day is not a sent unto
[39:52] death it may be a wrong thought it may
[39:55] be a thing that we say it may be a
[39:58] point I don't I don't like that cuz most
[40:01] people you know they they think it's
[40:02] nothing wrong but you know they'll they
[40:05] hit their hand hit her finger and they
[40:07] they do that little d a r n you know
[40:10] that I don't even like to
[40:12] pronounce well that's not
[40:14] sin well I didn't say it was I think
[40:17] it's a dirty
[40:19] mouth why didn't you say praise the
[40:23] Lord now I hear some of you say that so
[40:26] okay I'm picking on you I don't think
[40:28] you ought to say it goz why you just
[40:31] never have thought in your life that
[40:32] that was wrong to
[40:35] do
[40:37] right but you see Church we're not going
[40:39] to go to hell for the little bitty
[40:42] things in our problems in our
[40:44] life that's been my whole point we're
[40:46] going to go to hell for
[40:52] unbelief we we don't need to profit to
[40:54] Define sin now you understand that
[40:57] statement right the Bible plainly tells
[41:01] you what sin is that's
[41:03] right is to disbelieve God
[41:07] Amen he that believeth not is condemned
[41:10] already
[41:15] am and then we try to make it to be
[41:17] something
[41:18] that you know a
[41:23] problem and it is a problem because
[41:26] we're human nature that's right right
[41:30] human
[41:31] nature all
[41:33] right but think about
[41:36] it
[41:39] unbelief we gave the quote where the
[41:41] Prophet used it and it's wonderful where
[41:43] he unbelief in what he said in God's
[41:45] word which is
[41:47] God all right but brother Dale I don't
[41:53] disbelieve
[41:54] well I believe everything the prophet
[41:58] says so that the two Soul people the
[42:01] seventh th virtue people the peria
[42:03] people the peria people the the son of
[42:05] man people the any more doctrines going
[42:08] to count in the message and every one of
[42:10] them says they believe every word of God
[42:13] have you ever been to a church where
[42:15] they said we believe all the word except
[42:17] a few words and we don't believe that
[42:19] and we'll put them in your box where you
[42:21] can understand what we don't believe I
[42:23] had found that yet have you every
[42:26] everybody Methodist Baptist Presbyterian
[42:29] Pentecostals
[42:32] right everybody says they believe
[42:34] everything God says was listening to a
[42:37] tape the other night and I knew brother
[42:38] Brandon was making a point and he said
[42:40] look at it this way he said if you ask
[42:43] the people he was talking about
[42:44] denominational people now all over and
[42:47] he said you ask the people that they
[42:49] believe in Jesus Christ and said they'll
[42:51] say
[42:53] yes said do you ask them to to believe
[42:56] or do you ask them do they believe that
[42:59] he's almighty God in flesh said they
[43:03] yes and I thought come on now I don't
[43:06] want to fast forward but you're fixing
[43:08] to say
[43:10] something and he gave a few more
[43:12] illustrations of things and saying that
[43:15] if we would say Do you believe that
[43:17] Jesus Christ come and died for our sins
[43:19] to come and live in us to give us a new
[43:20] birth he said they'd say
[43:23] yes right ever Den in the world ever
[43:27] bromite ever hites or who or
[43:30] lulaes all right
[43:35] right and I thought come
[43:38] on and here's where he made that
[43:40] statement about
[43:45] it
[43:48] that let me just get on to the
[43:52] point he finally made this statement he
[43:55] said
[43:57] but you say to the
[43:59] people do they
[44:01] believe I'm paraphrasing however pretty
[44:05] close that they believe that he's a
[44:07] Healer today like he used to
[44:11] be he said said they'll say now right
[44:15] there we don't really
[44:19] know he said that's
[44:25] unbelief now what about it they go along
[44:29] with all of the things up to maybe a
[44:31] onepoint
[44:35] thing I've had people to ask me brother
[44:38] Gary's good at asking me about it he
[44:40] asked me one time he said do you think
[44:42] we've got the faith of the fathers I
[44:43] wasn't explaining to him I had it I was
[44:46] explaining that I believed it was here
[44:47] for the people and somebody had
[44:50] it all right and see others people would
[44:54] say no because in the the book of Acts
[44:56] it says Silver and Gold Have I None rise
[44:58] up and
[45:00] walk we don't see that taking place the
[45:04] reason is because of your unbelief
[45:05] that's right now if you tell me it's not
[45:08] I want you to explain one
[45:10] scripture I want you to explain one
[45:12] thing if you make God great in one age
[45:16] and lesser in another age you are in the
[45:20] worst sin that could be because you're
[45:23] denying Hebrews 13:8 right right that's
[45:29] right now come
[45:31] on well he just not doing like he used
[45:33] to do back there that's what the prophet
[45:35] was making that
[45:40] statement he said we come down to a
[45:42] point that we say well he's an every
[45:44] point but one thing now what did he
[45:48] say he said he's an every
[45:51] way except the Corporal body and thereby
[45:55] that makes him he Hebrews
[45:56] 13:8 that's the way he's saying it
[46:00] amen well brother D I just don't see
[46:03] things
[46:07] happening well you know why because you
[46:10] don't believe
[46:14] it and you know what like I said we can
[46:17] stand here and make statements of 5 six
[46:19] or something like that statements about
[46:22] the dead being raised and not a person
[46:25] has called to ask about that or said
[46:27] we're coming to church cuz we want to be
[46:28] in a church that it's not going don't
[46:31] worry about it it's over
[46:33] with that's right they're not going to
[46:35] come flock in if the dead was raised
[46:37] every service right here they're not
[46:39] going to come oh there'll be a few
[46:41] stragglers but the main point is they'll
[46:43] say a them only
[46:46] ones right you got to do
[46:50] something if you say the Dead's not
[46:52] being raised in our
[46:54] congregation
[46:58] right but are you following me you see
[47:00] how easy it is to be an
[47:05] unbeliever it believeth not is condemned
[47:09] already if you don't believe he's the
[47:11] same in every
[47:12] age I don't give a hoot about your
[47:16] thoughts or mind either one about we
[47:19] don't
[47:23] see and you say well we don't see like
[47:26] it does in the book of
[47:28] Acts well you're an
[47:32] unbeliever
[47:37] Y come
[47:39] on but yet I'm sarcastic and hateful and
[47:42] arrogant old dude for saying it like
[47:45] that but is Hebrews 138 still right amen
[47:49] sir brother Bram
[47:51] said there's no need for anybody to say
[47:55] that if we was just back there he said
[47:58] cause he's the same in every
[48:02] age amen when I just don't see it then
[48:05] you're an unbeliever
[48:07] right and you'll never see it as long as
[48:10] you stay an
[48:15] unbeliever I've been plain about it
[48:17] honest you take the book of Acts and how
[48:19] long that was that's a 30 40 year period
[48:22] or something right is it right
[48:26] covering the book of Acts or covering
[48:28] Calvary over or whatever to the F till
[48:30] you come up to ad 53 somewhere start the
[48:33] first church
[48:35] age 20 years or something and write down
[48:39] how many miracles took
[48:41] place and you'd see that there's
[48:44] probably one per
[48:49] year you don't look at
[48:52] that I got a little thought in a minute
[48:54] when we get down to that
[48:56] you don't look at
[48:59] that brother randam would say more
[49:03] miracles in one meeting done by the Lord
[49:06] Jesus Christ than is in is in the entire
[49:13] Bible now that's what he
[49:19] said but oh if it was just brother
[49:21] brandom was
[49:24] here
[49:27] brother told me one day he said that's a
[49:29] good statement and he said' I've dealt
[49:31] with it a lot but he said if God's here
[49:34] in you what's the difference in that God
[49:36] that's right I said thank you that
[49:39] didn't make me nothing it makes God
[49:44] something but you see how easy it would
[49:46] be to go into
[49:49] unbelief that was what I was trying to
[49:51] explain last
[49:53] week if sin is unbelief
[49:56] then we don't count the little small
[49:58] things that we looked at as a wrong
[50:01] thought as being
[50:03] sin or a uh little
[50:07] temper oh bless God don't Christian
[50:09] don't have no temper I want to back
[50:14] up may I back up to the P to
[50:17] the and say
[50:20] that Peter said we need
[50:23] Temperance he said now that's not that
[50:25] uncontrollable temper
[50:30] no it's the little things of
[50:35] life but now brother D no such thing as
[50:38] a big sin a little sin I'm glad you
[50:39] thought that because you just send your
[50:42] way out of the day of
[50:43] Grace you just went into
[50:48] unbelief because you got to Define it
[50:50] some
[50:51] way to where the human
[50:53] being can stand as a human being that's
[50:57] got problems as human beings I've
[51:00] defined that over and over when I will
[51:02] again we're not talking about Grambling
[51:04] smoking running around with we're
[51:05] talking about everyday little
[51:13] things just little
[51:16] problems little wrong
[51:19] thoughts
[51:23] right is that going to send us to hell
[51:29] no cuz now
[51:32] remember I asked the question what is
[51:35] the worst sin you could think
[51:39] of and I'm sure a lot of you thought
[51:41] about it I didn't Express much then
[51:43] really not knowing I would bring this
[51:45] but I guess the Lord knew how to handle
[51:49] it you'd say well brother Dale to
[51:51] blaspheme the Holy
[51:54] Ghost is the worst sin there
[51:58] is all
[52:01] right now what is blaspheming the Holy
[52:05] Ghost he said mama said it was for you
[52:07] to take a baby you know before it was
[52:09] born and and do away with it that was
[52:14] blaspheming he said the preacher said it
[52:16] was somebody killed
[52:19] somebody right but you know Paul comes
[52:22] over in his writings and he says
[52:26] adulterous hor mongers and etc etc he
[52:29] names a big long list of everything you
[52:31] could think of the feminists you know
[52:33] this day every how you pronounce that
[52:35] word if feminist you know wrongdoing men
[52:39] and
[52:40] women
[52:43] Y and he said such won't enter
[52:50] Heaven
[52:52] right and that's
[52:54] true it won't be no wh mongers and
[52:56] adulterous
[52:58] and things in heaven right that's true
[53:01] but then what did he turn around and say
[53:03] he said but such were some of
[53:07] you amen he said but now you are
[53:15] clean now you're set aside and make
[53:20] clean
[53:21] amen God's different from what we think
[53:25] am
[53:27] amen I'm glad of that
[53:31] amen but what is
[53:37] sin brother random we gave it last week
[53:39] but we'll give it again as the eagle
[53:40] stir at her nest number four if they
[53:43] want to pull it up what is that's sin
[53:45] when a man or a woman doubts the word of
[53:48] God it's
[53:50] sin he that believeth not is condemned
[53:52] already that's right he that
[53:55] he that condemneth believeth not a
[53:59] condemned not is condemned already do
[54:02] you believe that so what is sin
[54:07] unbelief he said if you got unbelief in
[54:09] your heart
[54:12] pray now if a Christian is the only
[54:15] one that can
[54:17] have sins that they have to answer
[54:21] for and The Sinner a sinner's not going
[54:25] up to the white
[54:26] throne and God give him a long list of
[54:29] line and says you done this and you done
[54:30] that you done this no he just walk up
[54:32] front and look at him he I done have
[54:33] better of it right right right because
[54:37] it could be brought as a flashback in
[54:39] front of him the computer age is really
[54:41] made it marvelous to my understanding
[54:43] about how God can do things at the white
[54:46] Throne man you can just pull up a
[54:48] person's life right
[54:53] now you know what they sent me me and
[54:55] brother Joe pulled it up
[54:56] Wednesday because I don't have the the
[55:00] uh all them things y'all have cuz I
[55:03] don't fool with
[55:04] them and brother Joe run it off and they
[55:07] sent me a note that I need to put some
[55:09] air in my right front
[55:17] tire now that's pretty
[55:20] technical for them to tell me I need to
[55:23] put some a in my right front tire they
[55:26] call you and tell you when your oil
[55:28] needs changing they call and tell you
[55:29] when your brakes are worn out
[55:31] y we're in an age when everything can be
[55:34] brought
[55:34] up well a sinner he won't have to walk
[55:37] up there and then give him a long list
[55:39] of reasons he's going to hell he just
[55:41] knows he's going to
[55:43] hell but what's the problem is what guy
[55:46] comes up there it says I done this i'
[55:47] done that but he said get away from here
[55:49] I never knew
[55:52] you see Christians are only only one
[55:55] that can sin right but what about
[55:58] blaspheming the Holy
[56:04] Ghost what is it to blashe the Holy
[56:10] Ghost you want two
[56:13] quotes you want to quote where brother
[56:15] randam said it's impossible for a
[56:17] Christian to blaspheme the Holy
[56:21] Ghost but now what are you going to do
[56:23] with the other one
[56:25] where he says a Christian can
[56:38] blashe you
[56:41] see it takes the Holy Spirit to know
[56:45] what it's all
[56:46] about it takes a holy spirit to know the
[56:49] difference between
[56:51] sin of
[56:53] unbelief and life of natural
[56:58] living
[57:00] right if you don't get nothing out of
[57:02] this what I've been last Sunday and this
[57:03] sun get that one thing there's things in
[57:06] our
[57:09] life that is not
[57:12] right but yet we're not called a sinner
[57:15] on account of it because we haven't
[57:18] disbelieved God's
[57:20] word now yours where it comes down to
[57:23] it
[57:26] I've put an open challenge to the
[57:29] world if you think I'm off the
[57:32] message then you come and show
[57:40] me that's a pretty good
[57:43] challenge but you know what I wouldn't
[57:45] want a lot of the other people that's on
[57:46] the internet to make that challenge
[57:47] because I just go see them yeah
[57:52] amen and I tell them
[57:56] here's where you're off and here's where
[57:57] you're off well come and show me where
[57:59] I'm
[58:03] off now not where we believe white dog
[58:06] black dog red and green what would you
[58:07] know pity Petty pet a little I'm talking
[58:09] about sh me where I've just believe the
[58:11] message right but you don't like
[58:15] that see preachers that's why they don't
[58:17] want me out there preaching is why
[58:19] because when I go preach I preach
[58:21] straight I don't get into doctrines or
[58:23] ideas or things I try to be straight but
[58:25] when I F it straight that's
[58:29] it I don't have no gray areas about the
[58:33] message or the
[58:36] Bible I said there must be a definition
[58:39] some way there must be an understanding
[58:42] if the prophet would say and the Bible
[58:44] would say that we sin every
[58:46] day but yet the same Bible would say
[58:48] that it's impossible for us to
[58:53] sin
[58:57] right so then we know what it is from
[59:00] the inward man Paul said he cannot sin
[59:03] that's right cuz he's born of God Amen
[59:07] it's not me it's him
[59:10] right but the outward man I still work
[59:14] according to the flesh
[59:19] right the flesh lives and so did the
[59:23] Flesh of Jesus live
[59:25] and he had to keep it under subjection
[59:29] right right that's right all
[59:36] right you see I don't mind talking plain
[59:38] because I understand I hope
[59:44] sometimes that what is to
[59:49] blashe why is it a Christian cannot
[59:53] blashe
[59:55] when the definition of blaspheming is
[59:57] really attributing the works of God to
[59:59] the
[1:00:01] devil right they're saying the devil
[1:00:03] made him do
[1:00:05] it when they made fun of Jesus what did
[1:00:08] he
[1:00:11] say now why did he make this
[1:00:15] statement he said all
[1:00:18] manner of wordings or unbelief or what
[1:00:21] you're doing against the son of man can
[1:00:25] be
[1:00:27] forgiven but said when he the Holy Ghost
[1:00:29] has come come on you know what so that
[1:00:33] meant nobody didn't have it but him
[1:00:35] right I hope some of you click on to
[1:00:37] that one because you're still pondering
[1:00:39] whether or not the Old Testament Saints
[1:00:40] had the holy ghost or not that's plain
[1:00:43] enough right
[1:00:45] there he's saying in a future date the
[1:00:48] holy spirit's going to
[1:00:49] come and one word against that won't be
[1:00:53] forgiven
[1:00:56] but yet the Apostle Paul coming over
[1:00:58] there in the
[1:01:00] scriptures and he said I compell them
[1:01:03] people we used to say you know cause
[1:01:05] them whatever it really says I compel
[1:01:07] them people to blaspheme that's
[1:01:10] right in other words he made them
[1:01:12] blaspheme
[1:01:16] right well the worst thing would be if
[1:01:18] somebody you make somebody do something
[1:01:21] would be worse than your unbelief
[1:01:23] right well look what he's saying no
[1:01:26] wonder the man winds up one day and he
[1:01:28] says I'm a chiefest of
[1:01:34] Sinners making people blasing the Holy
[1:01:37] Ghost yet he said I've done it
[1:01:40] what
[1:01:44] ignorantly
[1:01:46] right so they there ignorance goes a
[1:01:49] long ways with God right and I'm glad of
[1:01:53] it amen like I've always said one of
[1:01:56] these days I'll get ner enough to preach
[1:01:57] on God with
[1:01:58] amnesia because how can he forget when I
[1:02:03] can't and he can't keep no records and I
[1:02:10] do but
[1:02:13] listen go ahead with number one and then
[1:02:15] I'll try to find this other
[1:02:17] one uh pull number one up oh we want to
[1:02:19] read that
[1:02:21] one 3:16 through 319 of Hebrews chapter
[1:02:26] 6 Jesus said I'll forgive you for that
[1:02:30] but when the Holy Ghost has come you
[1:02:31] speak a word against it and never be
[1:02:33] forgiven you because they said he has an
[1:02:36] unclean Spirit now why does he calling
[1:02:38] it
[1:02:40] blaspheming cuz they said he had an
[1:02:41] unclean Spirit they said that was B
[1:02:44] above doing it right right a Christian
[1:02:47] can't do that a Christian will always
[1:02:50] call the spirit of God righteousness see
[1:02:53] a Christian cannot blast BL the Holy
[1:02:55] Ghost it's The Outsiders that
[1:02:58] blaspheme that wasn't Christians
[1:03:00] standing there it was religious people
[1:03:03] it was Orthodox Jews doctors of divinity
[1:03:06] and so forth and they were making fun of
[1:03:08] him and his words calling the works of
[1:03:10] God that it was an unclean Spirit doing
[1:03:13] it in words they said it's what it
[1:03:16] done come on down to where we're
[1:03:19] at make fun of the operation of the
[1:03:22] spirit just as paulish scholar
[1:03:25] slick as a button right but to make fun
[1:03:27] of the Holy Ghost and therefore they
[1:03:29] blaspheming don't make light of nobody
[1:03:33] that's right amen you see somebody
[1:03:37] shouting and I don't care if they got
[1:03:39] the Bob off I wouldn't care if they buck
[1:03:40] naked right this as plain as I can
[1:03:43] be don't make fun of their
[1:03:50] shouting
[1:03:52] right why because if it is the Holy
[1:03:55] Ghost on them as only an anointing it's
[1:03:57] still the Holy Ghost oh yes it is amen I
[1:04:01] don't make fun of these preachers or
[1:04:02] anything out
[1:04:04] there or in the message or anything I
[1:04:06] ain't going to make fun of nobody in
[1:04:08] their ways you tell me God told you
[1:04:11] something say Amen brother I just don't
[1:04:13] agree with
[1:04:15] it but whatever God told you go with it
[1:04:19] I don't agree with
[1:04:20] it I'm not making lot of you that's
[1:04:23] right don't make fun of nobody kids
[1:04:27] don't do
[1:04:29] it you remember what the brother was
[1:04:31] bringing out Wednesday the kids went out
[1:04:33] there and they made fun of them PE of oh
[1:04:35] Elisha what was it it's called Mom and
[1:04:39] Daddy was making fun of
[1:04:40] them
[1:04:42] right don't do it them kids will come
[1:04:44] out and say the same thing you're say
[1:04:46] and they'll say it in the open when you
[1:04:48] don't want it say
[1:04:50] it right right and then you slap them in
[1:04:54] the mouth for saying
[1:04:57] it may I call that a
[1:05:00] hypocrite or what else going to use but
[1:05:04] look he says a Christian cannot
[1:05:08] sin let's see makes mistakes we sin
[1:05:15] daily I have to look my notes I want
[1:05:18] these two
[1:05:23] together
[1:05:26] I get it in here
[1:05:30] somewhere oh excuse me they don't have
[1:05:33] it back there I was wondering why I
[1:05:34] couldn't find this is questions and
[1:05:37] answers reached in
[1:05:46] 1959 he says you be forgiven but to
[1:05:48] blaspheming the Holy Ghost shall not be
[1:05:49] forgiven people say BL blaspheming the
[1:05:52] Holy Ghost what is blaspheming mean
[1:05:54] means to talk about ridicu make fun of
[1:06:00] blaspheme so you make fun you make light
[1:06:03] of
[1:06:04] somebody and what's your
[1:06:06] problem it can wind up and lose you a
[1:06:09] lot of
[1:06:11] things but we're going to get down in a
[1:06:12] minute if we have time where it to
[1:06:15] blaspheme the Holy Ghost is to turn down
[1:06:18] the truth all right go to number
[1:06:22] 12 remember the one we gave the prophet
[1:06:25] said it's impossible for a Christian to
[1:06:27] blaspheme right go to number 12 and
[1:06:30] let's read this one taken from 54 6:20
[1:06:33] in the evening I heard someone the other
[1:06:36] day trying to preach the blaspheming of
[1:06:39] the Holy Ghost he said a Christian
[1:06:41] couldn't blaspheme the Holy
[1:06:49] Ghost and I and I and turned around
[1:06:53] evidently the gu was doing and read
[1:06:55] Hebrews 6 I thought oh
[1:06:58] brother he was once made enlightened and
[1:07:02] made partakers of the Holy Ghost to fall
[1:07:04] away and to renew himself again under
[1:07:07] repentance sure he can blaspheme the
[1:07:09] Holy
[1:07:10] Ghost Jesus said they that had
[1:07:13] blasphemed the Holy Ghost because they
[1:07:15] said he has a
[1:07:17] devil and he says now they
[1:07:21] can blaspheme the Holy Ghost
[1:07:26] sure he can blashe the Holy
[1:07:29] Ghost now which one's
[1:07:36] right is it the Christian cannot
[1:07:39] blaspheme or is it you can
[1:07:43] blashe now which one's
[1:07:48] right well if he didn't correct it we
[1:07:50] got to go with like sister said both of
[1:07:52] them but to do with both of them we got
[1:07:55] to have a little understanding right and
[1:07:58] that's going to take some self
[1:08:02] interpreting without a
[1:08:08] quote if I bring you to microphone
[1:08:10] you're going to self interpret without a
[1:08:11] quote because it's not a
[1:08:13] quote take my word for it run it in the
[1:08:20] computer I say brother Bren was right in
[1:08:23] both places
[1:08:28] amen but it's what he's talking
[1:08:32] about one he's talking about a true
[1:08:36] Christian cannot blaspheme
[1:08:39] two this guy has not made it
[1:08:43] yet see all right made partakers of the
[1:08:47] Holy Ghost that's Hebrews 6 to fall away
[1:08:50] to renew he
[1:08:52] said that that's a borderline
[1:08:56] believer right absolutely a borderline
[1:08:59] believer is not a true born again
[1:09:01] Christian that's right
[1:09:02] am but yet we can call them Christians
[1:09:05] because we just say
[1:09:08] Christians a true Born Again believer a
[1:09:11] Christian cannot blaspheme the Holy
[1:09:14] Ghost but yet he can have a lot of
[1:09:17] problems a lot of
[1:09:20] troubles now you going to tell me that
[1:09:22] when you heard this message you didn't
[1:09:24] first say it's
[1:09:28] wrong right when you first heard it you
[1:09:31] said it's
[1:09:34] wrong well not did God say blaspheme the
[1:09:38] Holy
[1:09:39] Ghost that's what we think he'd
[1:09:41] say but Paul said causing them to
[1:09:44] blaspheme he said but I've done it in
[1:09:50] ignorance see in
[1:09:52] ignorance you and I turned down the word
[1:09:55] when we first heard it is that
[1:09:58] true oh of course I accepted everything
[1:10:00] brother around said right when I you
[1:10:02] lying hypocrite that's right you're
[1:10:04] blind as a bat and that's the greatest
[1:10:06] unbelief could be right I like the way
[1:10:09] sister Gail says I come in
[1:10:15] fighting
[1:10:17] right now there was things brother
[1:10:19] around said and I believe
[1:10:21] yeah but there was things he said
[1:10:24] that went haywire to my previous
[1:10:31] understanding you know what if ID have
[1:10:33] stayed with that I would have
[1:10:37] proved that I was a borderline
[1:10:42] believer
[1:10:44] right but by going on and later saying
[1:10:47] Lord I'm
[1:10:50] sorry that brother first told me and
[1:10:52] sister told me about the word of the
[1:10:54] Lord at this hour
[1:10:56] and the water baptism in the name of the
[1:10:58] Lord Jesus Christ something like that I
[1:11:02] didn't agree with
[1:11:03] it I said Lord It's been made known to
[1:11:06] me now and I
[1:11:09] pray that you just help
[1:11:11] me to not do that
[1:11:18] again to
[1:11:22] blaspheme
[1:11:26] to reject truth when truth is presented
[1:11:29] to you then your ears are sealed you'll
[1:11:33] turn away from God very
[1:11:37] religious right seal of
[1:11:41] Christ form of godliness but deny the
[1:11:44] power thereof you turn
[1:11:46] away reject
[1:11:49] truth look back at number
[1:11:51] 11 un content for the faith you mean to
[1:11:55] tell me only onethird of you will
[1:11:57] believe he asked them did they believe
[1:12:00] and you have no doubt in your mind and
[1:12:02] raise your hand he's asking them you
[1:12:04] know do you believe in being in the form
[1:12:06] of the Holy Ghost and do again through
[1:12:09] you and I the things that he did here on
[1:12:12] Earth look you mean to tell me only
[1:12:15] onethird of you
[1:12:18] believe what's left for you to do but to
[1:12:22] condemn it
[1:12:24] condemned then be condemned then you
[1:12:26] mean if the Lord Jesus himself how could
[1:12:28] you ever be forgiven let me say one word
[1:12:31] what is the unpardonable
[1:12:33] sin to reject truth when it's presented
[1:12:37] to
[1:12:38] you is that
[1:12:41] right now was that our point last Sunday
[1:12:44] that we were trying to make a point out
[1:12:45] of
[1:12:47] it and the worst sin of all to me is the
[1:12:52] people of this message
[1:12:55] that do not believe Jesus Christ the
[1:12:58] same yesterday today and
[1:13:02] forever that was why I gave you the
[1:13:04] illustration the prophet was saying it
[1:13:05] the other
[1:13:06] night you believe in the one God you
[1:13:08] believe in the water baptism you believe
[1:13:10] in this you believe in the no Eternal
[1:13:12] Health you believe in all this and then
[1:13:13] one little thing comes I don't believe
[1:13:20] that that's unbelief right
[1:13:25] well I never heard it like that well
[1:13:28] when you hear it that's it don't turn it
[1:13:32] down that's right his brother random
[1:13:34] would say he said remember now every
[1:13:38] word is a seed and he says when you're
[1:13:41] eating that cherry pie and you come to
[1:13:43] the seed says you don't throw the pie
[1:13:46] away said you turn you you throw the
[1:13:49] seed away then he goes what he said but
[1:13:51] be careful because remember it is a
[1:13:57] seed amen what is the unpardonable sin
[1:14:00] sure to blasing the Holy
[1:14:06] Ghost to doubt Hebrews 138 as being the
[1:14:11] same in every way except the Corporal
[1:14:15] body of Jesus Christ I didn't make that
[1:14:18] statement go read it you become an
[1:14:21] unbeliever when you don't believe he's
[1:14:23] the son
[1:14:24] today I don't care who's taught it to
[1:14:26] you who said
[1:14:27] it big man in this message he said third
[1:14:32] pulled only for brother
[1:14:34] brandham and the Lord Jesus
[1:14:36] Christ well probably a million people
[1:14:39] following the man's
[1:14:42] thoughts you think you're going to
[1:14:43] convert one of them from what he said no
[1:14:49] no you think the dead raised is going to
[1:14:52] convert one of them for from what he
[1:14:53] saying
[1:14:55] no the holy spirit is the only one that
[1:14:59] can convert
[1:15:04] anybody brother de why don't you preach
[1:15:06] like these other preachers preach why
[1:15:09] show me what their preaching has done
[1:15:11] but I will show you what the preaching
[1:15:13] of the seals of Daniel 70 weeks the
[1:15:16] vials the plagues the marriage and
[1:15:17] divorce I'll show you a
[1:15:21] church that's right and I'll put you
[1:15:23] against any church in this message we
[1:15:26] got a lot of fults and failures right
[1:15:28] but I'll put you against
[1:15:32] it yes sir the preaching of the truth is
[1:15:36] the only thing that's going to save any
[1:15:37] of
[1:15:38] us and if we don't know the
[1:15:42] truth then we're blindly ignorant a lot
[1:15:45] of times you know we do it
[1:15:49] willfully so don't tell me about it and
[1:15:51] I won't be responsible
[1:15:55] you don't ADM you you're guilty right
[1:15:57] sister Gail she tells me too
[1:16:01] much she told dick one day said don't
[1:16:03] tell me no more no abouton we
[1:16:05] responsible she right there she it
[1:16:08] admitted that something had touched her
[1:16:11] about it and she just didn't want to
[1:16:12] know no more because you'd have to deal
[1:16:14] with it all
[1:16:17] right so then what is sin
[1:16:21] unbelief what's the thing that God
[1:16:23] cannot
[1:16:28] forgive
[1:16:34] sin to doubt Hebrews
[1:16:37] 138 as to be the same today as it was
[1:16:40] when the prophet was alive or to be the
[1:16:43] same as it was when Jesus was alive for
[1:16:46] you to doubt Hebrews 13:8
[1:16:49] today because of your
[1:16:52] unbelief then that's the worst unbelief
[1:16:54] that there is remember now listen to
[1:16:58] what I'm saying unbelief is the only
[1:17:00] thing God cannot
[1:17:03] forgive
[1:17:05] right I mean he can forgive
[1:17:07] anything but he can't forgive unbelief
[1:17:10] why because you won't believe him that's
[1:17:12] right is that simple
[1:17:14] enough you won't believe
[1:17:16] him so he can't forgive
[1:17:20] you at least we should pray
[1:17:25] Lord I believe everything I
[1:17:27] think that I've
[1:17:30] heard but just don't let me turn down
[1:17:36] truth just because somebody goes against
[1:17:38] brother Dale I don't throw that
[1:17:42] away I take it home and I think about it
[1:17:46] and I study
[1:17:47] it and I ask
[1:17:50] God God don't let me be wrong
[1:17:53] because I've got a church following I've
[1:17:56] got a family my wife my kids my
[1:17:59] grandkids great grandkids is here
[1:18:02] they're depending upon me don't let me
[1:18:06] disbelieve your
[1:18:09] word amen but see we can't
[1:18:13] wait I've tried to explain the
[1:18:15] Ministries and things you can't do it I
[1:18:18] had a thought to bring this
[1:18:21] afternoon and I've been thinking on it
[1:18:24] for a week or two and you
[1:18:27] know and I started finally getting it
[1:18:29] down to the
[1:18:32] point I thought
[1:18:34] Lord there's a one quote I
[1:18:38] need because I believe it but I want
[1:18:41] them to read what you said through your
[1:18:43] Prophet so they'll believe that he said
[1:18:45] it
[1:18:47] anyway and I said I want one
[1:18:51] scripture
[1:18:54] you say well my Lord you can find it in
[1:18:55] the scripture just run it in the Bible
[1:18:57] you can't if you got it you run it in
[1:19:00] wrong you type it in that computer wrong
[1:19:03] it ain't going to come out right now you
[1:19:06] might take the word and and type it in
[1:19:08] there and it'll be
[1:19:09] 5,842 and you got a long search
[1:19:13] but that was serious I sat in the study
[1:19:16] for quite a while and uh I thought
[1:19:20] Lord I know he said this this and I know
[1:19:24] the Bible says this
[1:19:26] but I used every quote I could ever
[1:19:29] thought I could
[1:19:31] find it wasn't
[1:19:34] there well you know what most ministers
[1:19:36] would get so haywired on that until you
[1:19:39] just about go out and blow your brains
[1:19:41] out because you know you got it but you
[1:19:43] don't know what to
[1:19:45] do I thought there ain't no need of me
[1:19:48] sitting
[1:19:50] here I'm going to go do something
[1:19:55] I went out and told my wife I said I'm
[1:19:56] going to ride over to the building look
[1:19:57] at some deer stands and see what we need
[1:19:59] to
[1:20:01] do
[1:20:03] well I came back didn't get
[1:20:08] it well Lord I know it's there but I
[1:20:12] can't find it so you going to have to
[1:20:15] find it for
[1:20:16] me I went on and done something else and
[1:20:19] rambled around done everything I could I
[1:20:21] don't mean wrong I mean I just went out
[1:20:23] and you know go there was no need of me
[1:20:25] trying to frustrate my own
[1:20:29] self sat back down
[1:20:32] and there it
[1:20:35] came the quote I needed and the
[1:20:37] scripture I
[1:20:40] needed some three or 4
[1:20:43] hours later than where I started
[1:20:45] thinking on it as a point of trying to
[1:20:47] find it and you know yourself I can run
[1:20:50] a pretty good search in this message
[1:20:53] so you know I ran every
[1:20:56] Avenue that I could
[1:20:59] find but my point is one
[1:21:04] thing if we'll just let
[1:21:07] him lead
[1:21:10] us he won't lead us into as we read to
[1:21:13] start with the world heill lead us into
[1:21:19] righteousness he'll bring to your
[1:21:21] remembrance whatsoever
[1:21:23] is said exactly
[1:21:26] right and teach you things to come
[1:21:28] because he put it together for
[1:21:31] you like I said when I ran across that
[1:21:33] where he said unpardonable sin to
[1:21:35] blaspheming the Holy Ghost it's
[1:21:37] impossible for a Christian to say I
[1:21:39] didn't stop with that and say I got
[1:21:42] it I said let's see what else he
[1:21:45] said and you hear he saying that it look
[1:21:48] like a Christian can
[1:21:51] sin
[1:21:53] well we got something we got to deal
[1:21:55] with now
[1:21:57] Lord what's your
[1:22:02] answer you see I'm trying to give him
[1:22:04] the honor and glory for the whole thing
[1:22:05] because of one thing because you and I
[1:22:08] ain't nothing but just a bunch of mess
[1:22:10] that's right we're no different than any
[1:22:12] other church or any other system
[1:22:16] right right the people of this message
[1:22:19] is becoming the biggest cult that
[1:22:21] there's ever been
[1:22:27] MH but in that there's a bride
[1:22:31] Amen in that there is a
[1:22:35] bride and you know what she's got to
[1:22:37] come out of
[1:22:41] that amen right come on brothers let's
[1:22:44] stand think on these
[1:22:46] things the unpardonable sin blaspheming
[1:22:50] the Holy Ghost yeah what is blaspheming
[1:22:52] the Holy Ghost
[1:22:55] saying that that's not the Lord that's
[1:23:00] right and they was not in no way against
[1:23:04] the healing of the Lord Jesus right
[1:23:08] right there was in no way against the
[1:23:10] signs and the Wonders that he
[1:23:13] performed right but when he begin to say
[1:23:16] I and my father are one
[1:23:21] right
[1:23:23] Lord Jesus now you run that quote in
[1:23:26] you'll find a prophet saying this when
[1:23:29] the bride begins to say I my father's
[1:23:31] one and these other
[1:23:35] things Satan's going to come
[1:23:38] after
[1:23:43] well I think it's time to get in or get
[1:23:50] out we had to something happened years
[1:23:53] ago I thought about it many many times
[1:23:56] we had a little
[1:23:58] problem and I prayed and prayed for the
[1:24:00] Lord to take care of that problem but it
[1:24:02] just didn't seem to work out that he
[1:24:04] won't take care of it I'm honest it it
[1:24:06] just didn't work out and I kept on I
[1:24:09] said Lord now you know then that I'm as
[1:24:11] serious as I can
[1:24:13] be you're going to have to work
[1:24:15] something
[1:24:16] out I came out here and I made an
[1:24:19] announcement I said we've got a naken in
[1:24:21] the camp
[1:24:24] and I said the only thing I know to do
[1:24:26] is
[1:24:28] pray for God to take the achin
[1:24:31] out I'm not against anybody everybody
[1:24:34] thinks I am they think I'm a weird old
[1:24:36] charact no I love
[1:24:39] everybody but I said we got an aan
[1:24:42] lord well you know what it wouldn't
[1:24:45] maybe two weeks till aen
[1:24:49] left I didn't want nobody to leave
[1:24:55] but a can
[1:24:58] left you see Church we're we're down at
[1:25:01] the end of
[1:25:03] it the worst sin of all is for us to try
[1:25:06] to hang around and pity patter a little
[1:25:08] bit around this message and you know oh
[1:25:11] just love one another we just we just
[1:25:13] love one another everybody's supposed to
[1:25:15] love one another may I quote that again
[1:25:18] we just to love one another we believe
[1:25:20] in one God we believe in one a baptism
[1:25:22] we believe in this we believe in that we
[1:25:24] believe in all of the things we believe
[1:25:26] that outside even the Corporal body is
[1:25:28] the only thing that he's not Hebrews
[1:25:32] 138 but we don't believe he heals today
[1:25:34] like he used
[1:25:39] to that's
[1:25:45] unbelief we ought to say at least as far
[1:25:48] as I'm
[1:25:51] concerned
[1:25:53] no if he ain't the same you and I got
[1:25:58] problems well I just don't see it I I
[1:26:02] see more out there than we do
[1:26:09] here I want the Bible go ahead brother
[1:26:13] what we got 27 in the spiral book 217
[1:26:16] anybody have a need I believe he's a
[1:26:20] Healer I believe he's a savor
[1:26:27] he Hebrews
[1:26:30] 138 I first came in this message you
[1:26:32] know what they told
[1:26:34] me we left the Baptist in'
[1:26:36] 67 you know what they told me that I
[1:26:40] couldn't be
[1:26:42] saved because all salvation was over

[1:26:49] 63 some of you never did face stuff like
[1:26:52] that
[1:26:53] but we were told you couldn't be
[1:26:57] saved cuz Redemption was over in
[1:27:01] 63 I said listen according to my
[1:27:06] Bible Redemption was over before the
[1:27:10] world ever
[1:27:12] begun and I said you're lying God the
