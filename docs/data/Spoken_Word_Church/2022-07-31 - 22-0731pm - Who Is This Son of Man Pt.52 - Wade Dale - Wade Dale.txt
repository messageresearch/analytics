appreciate them for letting us have that so there's your three long range days november 13th december the 4th and february the 11th i like to give you that so you don't come up and say oh i didn't unders didn't hear what you said brother brown said improving his word listen to this it's another one i pulled up on hold fast you know there's a scripture in the bible in first thessalonians 5 21 where it's written prove all things hold fast to that which is good when anything is proven it will either be proven right or wrong when anything's proven it'll either be right or wrong and when there's anything in question it should be proven until you find out what is right and then as you find what is right it says hold fast in other words grip it don't turn it loose hold it fast in other words hold it tight so that it will not slip hold fast to that which is good after it's been proven right and anything that's proven not right turn loose over real quick get away from it don't never hold on to the wrong thing don't never hold on to the negative don't ever hold on to the wrong thing hold on to the positive and i believe this word of god has been proven right it will never be proven wrong it's always going to be proven right so that's what we're talking about this morning i'm going to put my faith in what the word of god says amen so let's bow our heads lord thank you for the another opportunity to come here and talk about you lord just settle us down for a few minutes let the cares of the world it's just going to continue and go right on by people are doing things and and past these walls but lord inside these walls father may it be as the priest goes behind the veil as that veil closes every sound of the outside is done away with and it was just you and the priest behind that veil lord lord i i know the bible tells us now to come boldly to that throne of grace go behind that veil and lord you would speak to us so father please speak to us today through this veil of flesh lord just be with each one bless the ones that are sick weary tired i pray this should lift them up father lift their spirits be with us lord in the furtheman of this week coming up lord this is the first of the week you came up on the resurrection first day of the week father now pray that it'll be a complete resurrection for the rest of the week be your brother aaron williams tonight lord be with us in the things that we do lord may we give you the praise and honor and glory for all of it father we ask these things in jesus name amen who is this son of man part 52 we're moving right along i hadn't got to i was looking at brother tim pruitt's website the other day he's on 152. 152 of the people of the bible so and it's 52 is not so bad 152. bob could you imagine 152 john 1 verse 1. in the beginning was the word i tell you why the word's eternal because that's just part of it that's just pieces of it we just got pieces of it here in the beginning was the word where was with god and the word was god and the word was made flesh and dwelt among us we beheld his glory the glory of the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth romans 12 verse 2 says and be not conformed to this world as we were talking about this morning i don't yeah i want you to think that i'm hard on people but i want us to get off the line get off the borderline you remember the story you know the guy's sitting on the fence and the devil comes up and said what are you doing he said i'm sitting on the fence i don't know which way to go he said well don't worry buddy i own defense too okay so the devil owns the fence we need to move away from it as far away as we can all right and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may you may prove see god's transferred now the power for you to prove because god's not here god's not hearing human flesh anymore he's here in your flesh what to show who he is not to show that you look like the world and i ain't like the world no way but look be be transformed by the renewing of your mind in other words have a mind change change change your thinking we're tired of this thinking thinking that we're in that ye may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect word of god because remember his will is his word we're here today reading the will that somebody left us they had to die you can't you don't read a will before you pass away you read will after there's a death all right so someone had to die to give us these promises and they're all written in the bible they're written for me and you for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as god as what dealt to every man the measure of faith for as we have many members in one body and all members have not the same office so we being many are one body in christ and everyone remembers one of another you may be seated in the lord as blessing to the reading of the word as we were talking about this morning in first corinthians 13 verse 1 though i speak with tongue of men and angels this is a pretty good message believe right it's pretty good resume pretty good resume though i speak with the tongue of men and angels and have not charity i've become a sounding brass or a tinkling symbol though i have the gift of prophecy and understand all mysteries and all knowledge and though i have all faith and so that i could remove mountains and have not charity i am nothing and though i bestow all my goods man this pretty good guy it's for a good person but paul said it's nothing unless you got what the agape love of god not to feel your love but agape love of god and though i bestow all my goods to feed the poor and though i give my body to be burned and have not charity it profiteth me nothing because you know why there's no afterlife without agape love oh yeah i mean you're gonna have a life but you're gonna burn up in hell and eventually you're gonna just go away because hell's not eternal we know that there's no eternal life in hell god's the only one with eternal life right amen we understand those things right so you'll just you just burn up and go away but man i want to have eternal life where i can live where i can talk about what we're doing so i can you know what talk about my plan of redemption that god brought me because you got to think about your plan of redemption that god brought you amen it's not just a blanket thing where it just goes out over no and we're individuals we're all individuals in god but agape love means what brotherly love affection good will love and benevolence so it's not feel your love where you love me i love you it's not that if you say something bad to me i don't like you uh god loves you whether you love him or not forgotten love what whole world whole world he gave his only begotten son but that doesn't mean the whole world is going to be saved that means that you've got to connect back by foreign knowledge he knew it but you got to connect back to that predestined what we're going to talk about here in a minute to that predestinated determination that god saw you want it more than the next guy more than your neighbor i told you a long time ago i'm sitting in the airport and you go to atlanta airport and i mean you sit there at any time you know hour or two hours you're gonna see five or six thousand people walk by you business airport in the united states i mean it's just biggest airport in the world now i think but you just see thousands of people that have nothing especially them that are going really fast because they fixed trying to catch that flight you hear that little thing going you know they're trying to drag gina and those don't know about oh you know what i'm talking about bob no that's why i'm sitting there a long time before the flight starts and i can see these people that are dragging the wheels off of their luggage trying to get to a to a flight hello somebody so anyway michael where are you where are you going to work at you're not delta you leaving delta i guess we'll talk about it later um she's sinking down in this in the chair so anyway but anyway so you sat down and you look at people and and you look at and and like lisa you know just lisa we we observe people and you look and you go god they're good some of them are really good people some of them are not some are really good people why did you choose me and not them and not this person that i talked about here that that could give his body to be burned that knew all the mysteries that had faith to move mountains that i mean this guy that's just he's just a good guy and a good girl why me you know what the lord said just a little still small voice said you chose me they didn't you chose me you made a choice and they'll never make that choice to serve me but you made that choice so don't tell me that we're something special we're not but in mind of god in the mind of god we are special i mean because outside you looked outside there they probably didn't didn't look at me as anything special and i wasn't but then god i'm special because he said you chose me they're not going to choose you they're not going to choose me but you did and that's why i saved you because you wanted to be saved that's just simple salvation to me i mean it's just a wonderful thing for as many as are led by the spirit of god they are the sons of god here we are talking about the family of god that's what i was saying you're sitting there you know and you're in the economy of god you're in the last days and you you know thank god you were given an opportunity not to just be a christian not just to be religious but to have the very bible in the last age opened up by a prophet and you were able to hear that so see you take it from you take it from this big glob of religion to a little bit of christianity to just a little bitty small piece and then we're way over here we came out of her my people we came out of that system and so that makes it even more that i'm happy that god did cross my path not just to make me a christian but to bring me to an end time to where i can have not a faith or a hope i can have the faith of the son of god and be a son and daughter of god and realize that i'm a son and daughter of god son our daughter you i'm putting you inside there for you have not received the spirit of bondage again to fear but you have received the spirit of adoption whereby we cry i have a father that we just sing in that song we that's right that's what our call our call is to adoption spirit itself bear witness with our spirit that we are not going to be we are the children of god and the children then heirs like i said this morning whatever promise that jesus got you're going to get join ours with christ if so be that we suffer with him so you got to do a little bit of suffering that we may be also glorified together i read you that scripture this morning i'll read you another one where it says the trying of your faith be much more precious than gold that perisheth the trial of your face your faith so it's not gonna be a flower bed of ease but oh when we get there it'll all be worth it i have not seen ear has not heard but you know what god give us just a little bitty glimpse of eternity a little glimpse of eternity i was thinking or me and bob was talking about you know you they have people have pieces of truth people have peace and i'm talking about denominations i'm talking about the message i'm talking they're pieces of truth but jesus wasn't pieces of truth he was the truth and that's what our call is the adoption is to take the truth and then portray christ like he's never been portrayed on the earth before in a many remembered group of people that knows when you read into genesis that it wasn't an apple that you eat my heavenly days and when you get to revelations we just see this beautiful picture and everybody else is going i don't know what that is uh what's this symbol here what's that angel doing over there what's that bear that looks like a lion that's got teeth like a right we know all that thank god he sent us a prophet and then and then he set a fivefold ministry to break it down more to the people so that we can understand that we've had 60 years now since the prophets left that we've been what breaking it down more to the people and we should be able to thank god that when we open genesis we know what happened in genesis and we open revelations we don't skip over this part we know exactly what happened in the book of revelation we know who we are we know we're the bride not the church because you can't get the you get the two confused also the mind of god versus what's down here we'll read about that just in a minute if we get to it but let's go real quick justification and sanctification we know that we are not baptist in the point that we're once saved always safe where if you just had a had an emotion and shook a hand and and uh and put your name whatever that letter means i don't know what the world that thing means um good grief i mean have we come down to that where it's just it's a letter that you move i had a woman one time me and jim were sitting at a concert um one of the kids were playing josh or one of them was playing and she was sitting in front of us and i can't remember if it was judy judy's yeah i don't know who she was judy's sister she anyway she sent from she leaned back she said if that preacher don't do so and so i'm moving my letter i thought okey dokey i mean that's gonna mean a lot if that preacher don't do so and so i'm gonna move my letter and i did i said what letter she said that letter that you know she was a baptist but i do believe it once saved always saved if you go through justification if you go through sanctification if you go through the baptism of the holy ghost like the bible teaches you that after you've heard the word of truth after you have got this faith and after that you put all these things into play i believe in once saved always safe but i don't believe once saved and then 30 years later they'd you come up and pass away and they said well he was a member in good standing no here we go again go to church i'll get off of it next week sometime what did brother kidri dig say he says i'm about to close all right i'm about to not say anymore back listen we got to sharpen our pencil we all do we all have to up our game sharpen our pencil a little bit more because you know what god cannot get and i don't have it in this sermon but i think a guy in what future one god's not gonna we're not gonna get these virtues if we're not lined up to get them because he's not going to pass them out like you go outside and you just start passing out tracts and you just no there's certain things you got to do that's a requirement of god it's required that you believe the word of god and that you live the word of god it's required now if you don't you don't worry about getting virtual knowledge temperatures godless brother count that's why i keep harping on make sure you're born again make sure you know that you know that you know that you've been justified that you've been sanctified that you what you've been look look at this the name of this sermon a hidden life in christ a hidden life but something you can portray to the world that we're different i want the world to know that i'm different i've got something different than they do and you know what i'm going to get a reward of something different than what they're going to get so are you he said he'd give you a new spirit now that spirit isn't god's spirit that's your spirit god gives you a new spirit see that's where you see that you get a uh as do some i'm not saying just picking on the baptist but they pretty much believe in eternal security which i do if you're born again but i don't if you just shake somebody's hand and you went to church with you as a kid and then you no then you then you can't pull that's what i said with uh john stump when he was my and he was my banker we were out in the water you know and i told johnny handed me up or he tried to have me a beer and i said no i said john i said i've had an experience i said i got saved and he said well praise the lord i have too and he's hold the beer up like this i said what'd you get saved from what you get saved from you're still doing the same thing you've done the last time i saw you but i'm not what's the difference i want us to look at the difference look at the difference as we said this morning we're gonna bring two mannequins in here we're gonna bring two mannequins in there we're gonna dress these like the world and dress these like a the bible tells you to dress they're different amen god wants you to be different oh i don't want to be different you have god in your life you will be different you don't have to act different you will be different because we're going to talk about that renewing of your mind because the thoughts you have now is not the thoughts of god you understand what i mean in your spirit in your regular realm not in your soul but in your in your spiritual realm your spirit realm memory reason conscious effects and imagination is not all of god because we have to be husbands we have to be wives we have to work we have to do the things of life but down inside in that soul that's your type post because so when satan starts beating on that memories of constant affection you've got a tie post down here that's quite different when i was a sinner when satan did something on my outside realm it just on the inside they said yeah baby oh yeah come on but not anymore satan tries to bombard you with something you say no no not now devil boo he says i'll put my spirit in him after this is the new birth but the thing god has to do is give you a new spirit to make your nature a little more gentle and settle down or he couldn't even live with him then the baptism of the holy ghost look since seeing you you have purified your souls like i said before it's just a cop-out when you start talking to people and they say well i can't live that kind of life you ain't perfect night perfect that's not what the bible said the bible said be therefore perfect even as your father look seeing you have purified your soul that's bible it obeyed the truth not some man's idea through the spirit under unfeigned love of the brethren see you love one another with a pure heart fervently i hope you see the fervents of all of us we all bind together and we all become more fervent i believe some have some haven't i'm sorry some have some have it but i want everybody 100 i want them in what was that church age messenger was it martin or somewhere back in back in the uh no it was down in martin or or irena's prayed to god and and and taught his people until everybody in the whole congregation had the holy ghost take care of our problems no tell us how to handle them better yes amen but look being born again not of corruptible seed like i said before this morning i'm looking at corruptable seed i'm looking at people that are getting older right that's corruptible but we are now of incorruptible seed inside of our soul that saul is 20 years old and never get any younger and it'll never get any older by the word of god which liveth in the body forever romans 8 29 for whom he did for no then he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son you know i was thinking the other day brother dick come from presbyterian church and uh their predestination is well this is going to happen as brother dale's always used the illustration this is going to happen so i'm going to step off here because i know that god knows that's what was going to happen no that ain't that way thank god for a prophet that said god didn't put you in a little tube and pull you through and make you do something if he made you do it he's not just but he gave you a choice he lays a choice in front of every person cain had a choice abel had a choice adam had a choice the devil had a choice you were perfect until iniquity was found in you you were my right hand man you were my anointed cherub you walked up and down hey he walks in heavenly places amen but thank god one day when we go up he comes down he can't go to heaven no more because the people he's accusing are up there amen so he's not going to get kicked out of heaven until we leave when we leave and get out of here satan's going to be kicked out of heaven and you better not be down here when he's kicked out cause he's going to be one mad dude because he got kicked out of heaven by a bunch of ragtag sinners saved by grace and applied the blood where it needed to be applied he also did pronounce it predestinate to be what conformed to the image of his son see there's got to be on the power of transformation we look at all these renewing and all there's got to be a change what's the song oh lord there's a change in my life well is there the things i used to do i do them no more things i used to do i do them no more why there's been a change in your life i'm saying that somebody the other day because that's how i'm getting older the things i used to do i can't do no more moreover when he did predestinate then he also called whom he called he called you answered he called you answered yes yes so he justified you god forgive me in my past sins and whom he justified then he also glorified if you're sitting here today with a new birth in your soul you're already glorified your body just hasn't figured it out yet romans 11 verse 2 says god hath not cast away his people which he foreknew can't he can't erase his own mind of his own people ephesians 1 verse 10 said being predestinated look in whom also we have obtained there we go again we've obtained listen we got to be movers and shakers we got to get stuff we got it's not going to be poor i wish god would i wish i could unscrew the top of your head might find something in there might not find anything in there but i could pour this in and you just become it but that's just not the way it's going to be it scares us all to death and him also we have obtained an inheritance so we got to get it being predestinated god knew this is so simple god knew you would want it and work for it he knew it so therefore he can lay it right down the line for you and say look here's what i want this is the will of god i'll read it to you in a few minutes talking about faith faith is given for us to know the will of god and i'll explain that in just a minute that we should be to the praise of his glory look that we should be to the praise of his glory who first trusted in christ and whom also you trusted when after that you heard the word of truth listen you can't know you're condemned unless you hear the word of god something of the word of god has to condemn you to tell you you're lost that's why he sent the word that's why he said that seed word god didn't want us to be born by sex that's why we look in the garden of eden how it all got messed up he wanted it by what spoken word now he has spoken word children he has what he wanted before he has it today in him also you trusted after that you heard the word of truth the gospel of your salvation and whom also after that you believe you were sealed with that holy spirit of promise which is what the earnest of our inheritance until the white redemption of the purchase possession listen he purchased this whole thing just like he purchased the earth when he died and his blood dripped on off calvary and it hit the ground it claimed it listen the blood don't save you the life that's in the blood you could have two gallons of jesus's natural blood and it would do you no good but what's in that blood was life thy life is what's going to give you eternal life that's what he said into thy hands i come in my spirit and his natural blood did fall on the earth and thank god for a prophet that said hey there's the sanctification there's the cleansing process he claimed the earth where was your body in the earth at that time praise god and he said unto them and it's not for you to know the times of the season this is jesus getting ready to sin but you shall receive power after that the holy ghost has come upon you you shall be witnesses to me in jerusalem judea samaria lulu georgia and that means dunamis close enough okay we have a greek in our presence today so i have to say it right inherent power power residing in a thing by what virtue of its nature nature which personal thing exerts and puts forth power for performing miracles moral power and excellence of soul we've read these things many times so let's just read what happens after the holy ghost comes after that power come why is it power because what look they were the group that heard the messenger and his message and took it and lived it took it and lived it luther they took it they lived it we were talking about yesterday or the other day when i was talking to the to the girls at work about why women can't preach i i don't say why women can't preach why they shouldn't preach because that's what the bible says but um you know we we were looking at that we were talking about wesley which is the methodist founder of the i don't know why people have problems with us having a prophet i really don't you know why because he's contrary to all them others because martin luther obviously was the founder of the lutheran church and john wesley according to the method that he used become now a methodist and that was a man john wesley we had a man come that was filled with the spirit of god a church aged messenger called william branham and he brought us a word that we live by not something outside the bible but he straightened up the people that were trying to give it their own interpretation now the methodists are trying to put women and and i guess we can say gays we can't say queers gays preaching and even women behind the pulpit when the bible says and one of them said well that's old testament i said no new testament but it happened because of the old testament that's what they said well what happened in genesis i thought you should not ever ask me that because i'm going to tell you why a woman can't preach because she messed up in the garden and you know what you sisters ought to say thank god that's one burden on me i don't have to if i have this urge to get behind the pulpit you know it's the devil okay leave it to the men sorry it's not male chauvinism very clear he said i he said i say do not let a woman usher up authority or be in other words have any control over the church because she goes by our emotion that's something we need to cover bob on that list we'll tell you about that later but he and i are working on something but you know you say well you shouldn't do this but we need to have a biblical view of everything we can't say william branham said and that just be it not to the people that are coming in because you they say just like they did before or who is he it's in the bible everything's in the bible and that's why i said face final resting places in the word of god it's not in man's ideas because jesus stood one day and we'll read it in a few minutes jesus stood one day and said you have made my word of none effect to the people because you're pouring water you're diluting what i'm saying by the traditions of man i mean listen who told you sisters that you could preach wasn't god all right right because the bible tells you not who told you you could wear a pair of pants the bible says it's an abomination that's old testament so it's the ten commandments the bible tells us for sisters not to cut her hair that's bible that's not something we pulled out of the air and that's the promise of god that we should be living by so i said this morning you brothers are going to be held accountable for what your wife wears well i don't want to hurt her feelings i'm not here for feelings that's why a woman don't need to be back here because she's going to be emotional she's going to be over on this side of the emotion and not worry about the truth and what eve did hello somebody come on don't go to sleep you know what eve did she turn the word of god down she she listened to the twisting of the devil and she said okay let's do that but i say unto you that every idle word that men shall speak they shall give an account there on the day of judgment brothers you're going to give account for your kids and your wife but remember she don't have to give an account for herself you do so you're responsible because you're the strong one listen christ is responsible for his bride right we're not responsible for ourselves no we're not not if we're covered by him because that's why we don't have to stay in judgment that's why we're not going through the tribulation period he stood it for us our husband stood our shame he took upon adam took upon eve's shame so same way with with christ and the bride he took on our shame thank god what little bit we give back to him come on folks oh i'm going to be laughed at by the world and ridicule good that means you're not of the world i just read you if you're of the world you're not of god for by thy words thou shalt be justified and by thy words thou shalt be condemned well i don't want to hurt my wife's feelings you'll hurt them some other way so don't worry about it you've been married long enough you will hurt your wife's feelings well i didn't get any demands out of that but but you're going to give an account for her just like christ has now given an account for us because he's standing in my place and god can't go can't do anything to the bride because he's got christ standing in between the husband he's got the husband standing here the husband says i'll take her shame if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the lord jesus and believe in your heart that god has raised him from the dead thou shalt be saved for with a heart man believeth unto righteousness and with a mouth confession is made unto salvation confess is to admit or declare one's self-guilt i'm guilty i'm guilty who are you gonna throw it on throw it on somebody else no you're gonna be you're the one that's gonna stand in judgment not not me i'll stand for me you got to stand for you but you know what i got we've got one standing for us so when we go to when we go to the white throne judgment that's why we're with him in judgment not being judged because he was judged at calvary you and i were judged at calvary if you'll take it and believe it confess your faults one to another and pray one for another that you may be healed the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man availeth much possess to acquire get procure a thing for one for oneself to possess to marry a wife that's what he did he he took me and you're either possessed of the devil or of god right now today there is no in between you're either possessed of the devil or you're possessed of god if you've got the baptism the holy ghost in your soul you're possessed of god if you don't you're possessed by the devil then people out there yeah they're possessed too they're everybody's possessed of something like i said before their spirit's with us everywhere we go we just got to fight them off and we've got something i like that we got something to fight them with the world don't they don't know how to handle it oh yeah they know how to handle it pill bottle just pop me some of this over here and pop me some of this over here take a little gospel and it might help you every one of you should know how to possess his vessel and sanctification you have to learn this it's a process it's not a dump on me today it's a process everything's a process you didn't become an adult in a couple years did you some of us haven't become adults in 50 years praise god anyway every one of you should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor that's why the word of god is the will of god and watch this right here who is god in 1950 brother adam said look when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you this is a new quote so you can wake up and listen to this one when the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you remember god will make your body come into your confession he will make your body listen but you got to go the way the inspiration of the holy spirit is here to inspire you that ain't nothing but the truth that's what hattie wright stepped into one day and she said that ain't nothing but the truth brother branham and he said thus saith the lord he said whatever you want lady he said you asked it and god will give it to you she could ask for 10 billion dollars and god would have laid it right there on the table for her but she asked the greatest thing she could ever ask for she said i need i want the salvation of my two children and all they just fell down and just gave the heart to god god will make your body come into your confession if you say you're a drunkard and want a drink don't worry you'll soon be one don't worry you'll soon be one if you say you're a sinner and you want to sin you'll be right into it but if you say you're a christian and believe it all along god will bring your testimony will bring you right into it if you believe in healing believe that god has healed you confess it and god will make your body obey your confession because he's the high priest of your confession sitting at the right hand of the father now with his own blood to make intercession for any confession upon anything that he died for and he died to rid sin and sickness is a result of sin he was wounded for our transgressions with his stripes we were healed remember that have faith don't waver stand on it blind bartimaeus some people touch the garment of jesus and made well others smacked him in the face and hid them in the head with sticks and spit in his face never felt any virtue at all it was their attitude of approach it depends on what attitude you came in this morning with i'm not adding to it i'm just telling you what brother brown said if you come believing that you're coming to get help and you're confident that you're coming to the right person jesus christ and your coming his provided way of approach you're going to receive something if you come reverently if you come well i'll go touch and see if it helps me that won't do any good at all it's your approach to god's divine article it's what does it now look here's a perfect example just like the brass serpent now what happened in the in the wilderness there was sickness and different things and and you know what moses couldn't get to everybody right so god set up a provision he said if you'll take that same thing that caused to fall come on somebody if you'll take that serpent brass means judgment so he was judged have you ever looked on a have you ever looked outside in your doctor's office and see what their symbol is you see what their seal is it's a snake on a pole now just like the brass serpent the serpent didn't have no virtue in it it was a piece of brass they brought out of egypt neither did the paul have any virtue in it not a bit but it was obeying what god said do well i don't know why i'm not getting anything try to obey what god said to do that's what brought the power what brought the virtue is obedience to the word of god that's why we're going to start with virtue in a couple weeks or maybe next week or week after next it's obedience that's why i keep harping it's obedience to the word of god is what brings these virtues and he said that's the same thing tonight hebrews 11 verse 6 but without faith it is impossible to please him who god for he that cometh to god must believe that he is what he is god one not three one and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him be not conformed to this world but be transformed by what by the renewing of your mind we were talking about this morning you look at that renewing a renovate didn't pull your brain out and throw you another one no he used the brain that you got under carnal corrupt seed you know why because he's going to prove to satan that he can work through you just like he worked through eve just like he worked through cain just like satan's worked through all the evil people in the world god said that's okay that's fine i'm gonna have a group in the end times i'm gonna work through too and i'm going to work my perfect will through those people are you not one of those people the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect word of god or will for i say through the grace given unto me to every man that is among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think but to think soberly according as y'all had dealt to every man the measure of faith we were talking about that this morning the height the breadth everything listen i want everything god's got if it's if it's in the economy of god i want it and what part of that did jesus not get because if he's if he got it i'm heir to it too to renew a renewal a renovation complete change for the worse no it's a complete change for the better and our own nature listen if you're sitting here today and you don't have the new birth you're contrary to god so everything i'm saying you're gonna you're gonna be fighting against come and read the scripture i'm gonna read you a quote here with brother brown say if you're not born again you're gonna fight against it because your carnal mind is dragging you over to this side trying to reason it out instead of just believing what god said because your own nature is over here it's pulling now you don't have in your soul but you got in your memory reason conscious effects and imagination and it's pulling you toward the world because that's satan's playground greatest battle ever fought but god said i'm going to renew your mind if you'll let me i'm going to give you something over here that'll believe the word of god i'm gonna give you a statue of a perfect man that'll help you that'll establish you make you settled and grounded beloved when i give diligence to writing you the common salvation it was needful for me to write unto you and extort to you that you earnestly contend for the faith which was once delivered unto the saints for there are certain men now watch this certain men crept in unawares who are before of old ordained to this condemnation listen there are preachers ordained to do what they're doing there are people ordained to do what they're doing all right the prophet of god said they'll sit in the congregation and refute the word of god now and they do it all the time ungodly men turning the grace of our god into lasciviousness and denying the only lord god our lord jesus christ what's what jesus said in mark 7. he answered and said to them well how isaias prophesied of you hypocrites think i'm tough that is as it is written this people honor me with their lips but their heart in other words their soul is far from me how being in vain do they worship so they're christian they worship so how being in vain do they worship me teaching for doctrines the commandments of men for laying aside the commandment of god you hold the traditions of men it really tickles me i mean it really doesn't of how blind people are because you know even in the um i guess you might say the protestant world because you got protestants and catholics because pro they protested the catholic church and came out of the catholic church so they pro protestants but read their history they believe everything the catholics believe except just a few little items so don't talk about that old mother because she had some kids for laying aside the commandment of god you hold the tradition of men as a washing of pots and cups and many other such things like that you do like things you do and he said unto them now this is jesus full well you reject the commandment of god full well that ye may keep your own tradition listen if it's not in the word of god it's a tradition amen and god can't quicken it but if we have come now as we have this lost faith we were talking about because jude said you've lost it we got to get it back so we have now the faith of the fathers listen in the book of acts there was no denominational idea in the book of acts there was no three gods there was no trinity there was no baptism father son holy ghost show it to me they didn't have those traditions they had the pure word of god that's why we had to have a prophet take us back to that and then we will have the faith for the time that's needed our faith is for a body change that lady at the that touched his garment she needed to be healed the woman come with a perfect faith for her time luther came with the perfect faith wesley came with the perfect faith for his time pentecost came with the perfect faith so did john smith with the baptist so did all the different ones that set up the different denominations at first they were good god worked through that but remember he moved on they cabbage down and said nope this is it and then what the traditions of man got involved i mean i can remember going to church at the baptist church in gillsville when i was um i think we left in 68 so i was eight years old they want no pants wearing a women in no church now they might have cut their hair and wore some jewelry but uh ted you're i mean none when you went to church you were reverent you wore a dress and you didn't wear one that you had to pull the seams down to get it below you now i say crotch but used to be used to be knees i'm sorry but it's just become pitiful but there wasn't none of that now what's happened what's crept then something's crept in and said you can do that now they're having a camp meeting over at lebanon over where i uh deliver mail and it's daddy's brother that preached there for years and years and years well it just looks like a beach party literally girls and men in shorts and tank tops and everything else walking around the campground how is that god but you know what somebody told them it was okay for them to do that god didn't god didn't tell them that so then look let's be let's if god didn't tell him to do it who did there's only two forces belief and unbelief there's only two forces oh yeah he's got all these demons over here and god's got all these good angels but all they can do is they can try to influence you you're the one that's gonna have to take it and say okay i'll do it don't blame the devil for a lot of stuff blame yourself notice now perfect faith is a master of all circumstances perfect faith masters all circumstances as we i'm going to skip through that because we were talking about before paul and and daniel and and even david we were talking downstairs you look they s the whole the whole story is built around a promise daniel had a promise in two years you're going to come out of captivity paul you got to go to rome remember the holy spirit they wanted him not to go but he said you got to go to rome and see caesar so paul says paul took that and said hey i can't die i don't care blow the ship up and he did god told him though said if you'll stay on that boat and all that people stay on that boat i'll save every one of them and then paul walks out and he's picking up sticks being a good servant that he is picking up sticks you know he wasn't he sitting over in the rock say bless god y'all go over there and get them things no he was up there picking up picking up stone picking up sticks to build a fire and a snake beat him on the hand and you know what as i said before if those island people looked at him and said well he must be a demon because they've had this horrible wreck and and now they're stranded on this island said he must be a murderer he must be a liar he must be something well buddy when that snake latched onto his hand and they're sitting there watching him and he's still hour later he's still stoking the fire you know what the bible says they said he must be a god look how that changed god took that faith that paul had and the faith that david had it wasn't so much that david was going to sling that you know he was so mighty that that rock was going to kill it really didn't kill goliath remember it only knocked him down so he could cut his head off because see remember david prophesied and say i'll kill you today he said i'll take your head off today but david knew since he was anointed by samuel several years later that he was going to be the king of israel so he believed what his prophet said and believing what his prophet said there's nothing going to stand in the way same thing with me and you we had a prophet tell us we're going to be changed in the morning in 2009 hour we're gonna stand here and death is not gonna be anything but like a just oh that's a fairy tale maybe to you it ain't a fairy tale to me james one verse 2 my brother encountered all joy here we go count it all joy when you fall into many temptations knowing that the trying of your faith worketh patience but let patience have her perfect work that you may be perfect oh really perfect in christ i'm perfect me i'm not but i'm in christ an entire wanting nothing james 2 verse 14 what does it profit my brother though a man say you have faith and not have words can faith save him if a brother or sister be naked or destitute of daily food and one of you saying to them depart in peace be you warmed and filled now here's the story it wasn't that you gave him anything you just told him to get out of him leave one of you says oh depart in peace you wear whatever you want to it ain't going to matter it must matter to god jezebel would have had a different opinion of that she got fed to the dogs but you know why she got fed of the dogs because elisha elijah prophesied that she'd be fed to the dogs if a brother and sister be naked and destitute of daily food and one of you say unto them depart in peace be warmed and filled look notwithstanding you give them nothing you give them not those things which they needed like clothes and and and food which are needful to the body what do they profit even so faith if it hath not works is dead being alone yeah a man may say thou hast faith and i have works show me thy faith without thy works and i'll show you my my faith by my works is faith expressed now believe us that there is one god that'll do us well the devils also believe and tremble most of our denominations believe in three and the devil knows it and he only believes in one like he's supposed to but will thou know o vain man that faith without works is dead was not abraham our father justified by works when he had offered isaac his son upon the altar this is a little confusing until you read what a prophet said see us thou now how faith wrought with his works and by works was faith made perfect and the scripture was fulfilled which says abraham believed god and it was imputed or accounted to him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god you see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works when she received the messengers and had sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is dead also thank god for a prophet listen to this john expressed his faith in what god had revealed to him therefore works is faith testimony when you see you acting like you're healed then you'll know you've got faith that you're healed what does testimony say saying this i have it now because i received god's promise it is now working in me i am making ready for it to happen uh-huh see that's what you that your works does well sure all right faith without works is dead cleveland ohio up there close to where we just were at it looks like paul was speaking in romans the fourth chapter justifying abraham by faith and james is justified by works but it does not contradict paul look clears it all up right here paul was speaking of what god saw james was speaking of what man saw wow paul was speaking of what god saw in abraham in genesis 6 when he told him he was going to have a child and abraham believed god and it was imputed or counted in him for righteousness he believed the promise that's what god saw and then james speaking was speaking of what man saw in genesis 22 where abraham offered up isaac see what faith is what faith you have that's what god sees but what your works is is what your neighbor sees one more time what faith you have is what god sees but what your works is that's what your neighbor sees show me your works by your faith without your faith or i'll show you my works by my faith if i'm walking outside and and our neighbors they're they're they're gay men but they've asked us more questions about religion than most people in our whole community but uh and i've never seen them be intimate outside the house so it doesn't make me i don't want to shoot them i want to love them but if i walked outside and jim walked outside and shielded a pair of shorts and you know she's smoking a cigarette then on sunday we get all dressed up and we in this message thing you know we're showing that we don't have faith by the works that we do and if we go to work and i start cussing like a sailor and see what i mean the world doesn't might see like that's when they'll go oh you're not perfect i'm not either but i don't cuss i don't smoke i don't drink i don't run around all that got tore out of me is sanctification and then god put the soul of himself inside of me so you know what i try to act like god yeah you i know we're not all perfect but that soul inside of you is if you'll let that thing work let that thing out let it work you will become the perfect walking word of god listen to this now all right now you ready all right bob well are you ready our ministers our ministers every one of them has up their game every one of them they bring some stuff i'm astonished with but you know what it's not me to it's not me to judge them but when they bring the word of god folks and you get something out of it notice i believe that this audience here has faith i believe that but i believe you're afraid to turn it loose on works i believe that if you just let your faith loose what'd i tell y'all back in january let it out let it out you've got it bound so long let it out whatever it is evil or good it's going to one day whether you want to or not but i believe that you're afraid to turn it loose on works i believe that if you would just let your faith loose we've been taught right let's start using it start pouring it out sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry we'll get i got a i got a hold of this thing so big go along quote faith without works is dead in 1950 cleveland ohio if you'll go back they put these online so if you want to go back online and look that's a good message to listen to now watch at thy word 1953 now paul was justifying abraham by faith james justified him by words paul said abraham was justified romans 4 by faith and so james comes over and says that he was justified by works now both of them one confirmed the other not contradicted the bible never will contradict itself now both of them one confirmed the other now paul was speaking what god saw so today i want to see what god saw but i want the world to see what god saw in me everybody with me james is speaking what man saw his works and if you say i got faith in god and afraid to put your faith to work come on people and afraid to put your faith to work then it won't do you no good you've got to launch out that's what's the matter with the peoples today of this world many of them has faith but they're afraid to launch out with it you're just afraid to venture a little bit you hold it back somebody might one day want to speak in tongues let her out somebody maybe want to shout let it out make you feel good get it out just to say well i can i can do all things to christ who strengthens me amen number 10 what is sin unbelief there's only two elements that control the human being that's either doubt or faith one or the other we've been talking about that but i want to confirm it you're possessed of one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have is how high you can rise dedication 1963 prophet said i would like to open that just a little bit for you if it be permissible you say sin is unbelief there's only two things two channels that you can live by one of them is faith the other one is unbelief he that believeth not is what condemned already smoking drinking committing adultery lying stealing carnal impersonations those things are attributes of unbelief if you was a believer you wouldn't do them no you do that because you're not a believer oh you say oh but i am a believer but by their fruits you shall know them see your actions speak louder than what your confession proves see when you disbelieve god's word and count it as something gone by there's well that was in the old testament it's still in the bible it says holy bible and that's pretty much covers from kevin to kevor all right when you disbelieve god's word and count it as something gone by or take some book instead and say this is just as good as that it goes to show that you're not a believer that's right you're not and if he was then you'd believe god's word he would express himself through his word now he was god's word expressed he said now if you can't believe me believe the work should i do listen jesus christ fulfilled every scripture that those pharisees and sadducees had rolled up in those scrolls he didn't deviate from he was the word the bible was written so that that man could walk on earth and show who he was and they turned him down they called him a devil so if you're god's word expressed today the world's gonna say oh you're all crazy y'all follow this man y'all in a cult yeah and it's true we are the only people who's lost our mind i believe that thank god i've lost my mind you've lost your mind yeah amen thank you thank you for noticing that search the scriptures from them you think you have eternal life and that's the very thing that tells who i am oh i wonder that's the one that says who i am the scripture tells who i am look and let me take that a little further will you everybody with me wake up just a little bit the scriptures is what tells what you are what you are that expresses you and expresses me the scriptures tell what we are it's so loud that our voice cannot even be heard our life speaks louder than our voice see and it's god's way of letting us see what we are god hiding himself in simplicity what sort of prophet let me get down to the bottom faith takes his final this is what we stopped at this morning faith takes his final resting place on the word of god nothing else not traditions of man not what this person said or what that person said faith takes his final resting place on the word of god there's where it finds this resting place you understand it's resting places on god's word so we're gonna put everything on god's word that's where noah rested he said what god said so that settled it perfect faith 1963 jesus had perfect faith he had it and it comes what because he was the word and as brother bob was talking about melchizedek i went to who is this melchizedek and i want you to understand something there's a lot of people believing here we go with a tradition of man that believe that jesus wasn't god to the river jordan that he was just a man and he walked and we've heard it right bob i'm not saying it we've heard it but who is this melchizedek totally explains it it says he was he came here the word we didn't we bypassed that part he came word watch spoken word we didn't we bypassed that but now we came to it though because he let us come in flesh and then now we have god right here and you become the word you become the word as you receive the word don't tell me you can sit home and watch everything in the world and read every kind of book in the world and not come to church and think that you've got the word of god you can't even know what to how to act if you abide in me and my words in you my words which this word abides in you then ask what you will and he'll be done for you if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt but believe in what you've said then you shall have what you said when you pray believe that you receive what you asked for space nothing else will ever change it don't try to change the word of god can't do it you know it's done it's already over with number 14 look 1963 pharaoh did not have this potential he was offered it but refused it and when he review refused it then he couldn't focus now watch this no man after he's turned down the word of god listen no man after he's turned down the word of god can ever focus himself into it because you refuse the word that brings you into a relationship with christ oh i've got a relationship with christ and don't do what his word says really no man after he's turned down the word of god can ever focus itself into it because you refuse the word of god that brings you into a relationship with christ that's right but moses looked out of this window he believed it why moses looked by faith that's how moses looked now listen real close to this remark faith now don't forget to get this now so let's listen wake up faith is the sign this is what i was coming to this morning or this after first part of the sermon faith is designed to see what god wills and wants there's no knowledge that can do that faith alone is designed so god designed faith for you to understand the word of god put your faith your faith in it and then he'll give you that faith back so now it's your faith add to your faith faith alone is designed and give to the human race to find out what the will of god is and you take your faith that you got and it don't focus with the word then leave it alone you got the wrong faith but when your god-given faith focuses you with the word of god you're directly in line and zeroed oh my god help us this hour great hour that we live in faith designed to see what god wants how do you see it through the camera of his word his promise this is a full revelation of jesus christ that's pretty confident in it i'll read this right here and then we'll close only been an hour well for some of you 30 minutes you've been asleep together 1954 faith cometh by hearing now i want you to listen this i'm going to read it real slow hope will agree with the bible everybody with me hope will agree with the bible now y'all don't read down any further stop that i see some of y'all reading stop it look watch this hope will say it's true hope will say i believe every bit of it oh sounded pretty good isn't it i believe that's the word of god and i believe that god will keep his promise hope believes all of it but hope says now i believe god will heal me but look at my condition you've lost the faith right there look at my condition now faith don't look at that faith comes around i don't care nothing about conditions god said so and it's mine you see faith burly as i once said faith has hair on his chest when it stands up and pulls his big muscles out everything else vanishes away just flies away when faith really takes a whole nothing else stands i'm telling you faith but you've got to but you've got to have hope and charity so you got to have these things bible says faith hope and charity right now look the prophet took them pulled them apart and showed you exactly what that bible was talking about if you've got real burly faith and no love with it you'll ruin your influence before the people all right so you gotta have charity you gotta have the new birth look you you'll ruin your influence before the people if you haven't got love mixed with it see you've seen people real burly what we would say excuse the expression of bulldog faith they said jack cole used to if somebody was you know had arthritis and they would bent over he just grabbed by the back he just jerked their back up you know or or whatever and you know slap them or beat them or something you know and they get healed well they put him in a jail for that too so but that's bulldog faith but watch brother branham now you know what he never did that he never jerked nobody he never knocked the hairpins out of some woman he pointed his finger at him or he'd pray for him by the shoulders he never did any of that you know why he was in control faith masters all circumstances then you did you see jesus ever do that jesus never grabbed nobody he never got nervous he never shouted at somebody except lazarus told him to come forth but other than that he just said satan go why because he mastered all circumstances bulldog faith to grab a hold but it's so rough but it's so rough with it then you see when you do that it hasn't got the kindness here to move with it brother brown said how do you cast out a demon what'd he say love love you love that person and you hate the demon hasn't got the kindness to move with it so what we need is hope faith and charity isn't that right hope faith and charity together god help our church to have it like that the people to have that combination so it takes a combination of faith it does take hope but don't stay hope my hope is built on nothing less than jesus blood and righteousness but you got to have faith faith and faith has no condition hope has a condition well i want to get healed but i want to have faith but but if you just rely on hope watch you hinder faith now hope looks for something way off but faith claims it right now see faith says god said so and it's mine that settles it i don't care if i'm still crippled i'm still blind if i'm still sick that don't have nothing to do with it amen freedom i believe it anyhow it's mine right now god says so and that settles it see that's faith but hope says god said so i'm expecting to get it someday that's what most of the world has is hope they have no faith i hope god's coming back i hope god can straighten out the united states i hope god just straightened out the politics i hope god can straighten out the world forget it you better have faith in god that he's gonna get you out of here i like what brother brown said you know the guy came by selling insurance to him and he's he said oh brother branham said he said i need to get you some insurance and he said well i've got insurance he said why he said his wife looked over at him you know like that happened knew he didn't have life insurance he said oh brother i said assurance he said well brother he said he said that won't help you when they put you in the ground he said yeah but that assurance will help me get out blessed assurance jesus is mine and as long as satan can put you off to another day see that's his tactic as long as he puts you off to another day that's as good as he wants he don't want you to disbelieve in god he just wants you to put it off to another day that's good as he wants that's right you'll never get it just believe that you got it right now it's your personal property faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen is that right faith acts now it's positive there's no oh my i tell you sickness and everything else when faith steps in it's just like a snowball on a hot stove it ain't gonna last it just melts away everything goes away from faith because faith stands up and takes over rule when faith speaks everybody else keeps still is that your perfect man we'll stop right here musicians get ready to come oh come on you can't be born again without having faith that's right so you see on my chart here he's talking about the chart right here i got the very foundation faith is the foundation of all of it for without faith it's impossible to please god listen he that cometh to god must believe that he is and a rewarder of those that diligently seek him see he must be and when look when you are a skeptic of the bible when you are a skeptic of the word being right you just might as well stay back until first you believe it stay back what is sin unbelief there's only two elements he's done this is the third quote i'll give you that controls the human being that's either faith one or the other you're possessed of the one that dominates your life just depends on how much faith you have how high you can rise i expanded that quote a little bit but look but first it's got to be faith let me stay on that foundation for a while now faith is what you must believe faith is the substance of things hoped for it's look you already have it when you have faith because it's revealed in faith faith is the substance of things hoped for see the evidence what is it what kind of an evidence a holy evidence now look again now faith does the rest of it faith does the rest so you must have faith for a foundation all christianity all christianity all you are all you'll ever be is based upon what faith in the word not faith in the man not faith in the building not faith in the government faith in the word that's the reason i believe the word then we're going to start right there next time have faith and be born again that's laying your foundation got to lay that right foundation before you can build a good house if not your foundation will fail if you're built on sinking sin if you build on man's ideas we're not built on man's ideas we're built on the word of god you love the lord let's sing a song all i want to do is love you all [Music] jesus paid the price [Music] [Applause] oh [Music] [Applause] all i wanna do is love him so glad i feel his love for me jesus paid the price of redemption on the cross of calvary so every day my heart will praise him i know i'll never be the same all i wanna do is love him love his holy [Music] name oh all i wanna do is love him so glad i feel his love for me jesus paid the price on the cross of calvary [Music] i know i'll never be the same all i want to do is love him please [Music] on the [Music] i know [Music] all i want to do is love him he loved me first he loved me before the foundation of the world he just knew i'd love him when i got here amen he's got enough love for the whole world all seven billion people and all the ones that are in the grave but only a certain group of people is going to take it amen i'm sorry i mean it's just a free moral agency choice to choose you this day who you'll serve there's only two masters there's only satan or god there's no in between there's no tweeners you either love god and serve him or you love the devil and serve him and it will manifest itself this is manifesting time this is not something where you can hide and keep going all of a sudden something's going to be revealed and it's going to be revealed who you are i want you to make sure your conscious is right make sure your soul is right that's why i love that song it is well with my soul it may not be well with my spirit it may not be well with my body but is it well with your soul do you know that you know that you know do you know that when you walk out of this building if you get killed in a car wreck or something happens that that that we'll see you again coming out of that six dimension coming out of the grave so then what are we worried about what are we worried about that's why i said he's not giving us he's not giving us what fear god if you're fearful of something god did not give that to you now we don't fear god like that either the fear of god is the beginning of wisdom so if you you know how we know how to fear god we know how to be reverent to god it's like brother ryan said he said i don't fear that you know god's gonna just be a hateful arrogant something to beat me up no that's what the devil does but he's gonna he's gonna whip me with nail scarred hands if i need it he'll give me a little smack every once in a while but you know why he does because you're his child because you know what if you're a bastard child he he can't he can't help you he's not going to help you but if you're his children the trial of our faith being much more precious than gold that perishes the trial of your faith i want us all to lift it up and let it out like brother ryan said let it let it loose let it loose loose him and let him go that's what he said to lazarus he was still bound up when he come out of the grave hello somebody he was still bound up he was alive but he was still bound up right but when jesus said loose him and let him go come the shackles off here he come out a whole man after being dead for four days lord he stinketh jesus is like forget your circumstances i hope i hope nope he said i am the resurrection in the life and that same god there's another air and joint air because you know what there's going to come a day somebody's going to be standing in a pulpit and somebody's going to say death leave this place you have no hold on me and then all the dead saints are going to come walking in the room don't need to open the door for them because they're already in glorified bodies so you won't need you don't need to lock up something to try to keep them out you can't keep god out with a lock so they're going to come walking through the walls and we're going to know one thing's for sure the rapture's on the resurrection has happened and something's going to click and you're going to say oh my well i looked at my hands and my hands were new and i looked let me say brother jose at my feet and they were too won't it be a time won't it be a time talking with the angels they don't even know what you're talking about when you talk about redemption they're like but you were lost one time that's why i love that song of redemption the angels all will listen for they cannot join that song the bible says you sing a new song it's a song nobody knows anything about if you're not born again you can't sing a redemption song but man if we are born again talk about able to sing a redemption song i once was lost in sin but jesus took me in then a little i from heaven what filled my soul he bathed my heart in love we know that he wrote our name before the foundation of the world but he wrote my name above just a little talk with jesus makes it right let's bow our heads lord i pray this number one you be with brother aaron on wednesday night lord that bring the words to his father that we need just be with us today as a congregation lord may our faith truly be raised up lord and let it loose what we have inside of us father that lord we can give you the praise and honor and glory for all things you give us all these gifts of faith and of healing and of speaking in tongues and of wisdom and all the different things lord i pray that with all nine spiritual gifts lord that they'll become working in our midst father you said we could have them if we ask so lord i ask for all the promises that you give us you give us some really good ones in the last days lord all these different things you've given us you said that we could sit on the throne with you and we there's a lot of things that we could do with you that other church ages couldn't do and father we pray and thank you that you give us a prophet that we were able to see that that he was not god but a mouthpiece just like other mouthpieces have been paul irenaeus martin different ones columbia even john smith even dwight moody and the different ones lord they were your mouthpiece at a certain time but we had a major prophet come in the end time and he gave us the correct interpretation of the word of god that comes straight from you father come straight from the author there was not man's ideas mixed in you were that was not touched by man but was touched by you and lord i pray now that you'll touch each one of us give us strength for this journey that we're on lord and i as i read the quote hold fast let us all hold fast get a death grip on whatever it is that we need the faith that we need lord for revelation lord and let's not let it go let's hold on to you as jacob jacob wrestled with you all night and by the morning come you had to leave and jacob said i'm not going to let you go until you give me a blessing well lord you gave him a blessing you changed his name to israel you made him walk different he became the limping prince but lord the world knew that he had met somebody and lord i pray that the world will know that that we have met somebody and it's not anything of the world or anything to do with with the cosmos of this world order we know we have to walk in it lord but we don't have to be a part of it father forgive us of our sins be with each one lord on the highways be with the ones that are sick lord just uplift each one be with brother anderson the different ones that are still traveling that you'll be with them and take care of them as you bring them back home bless your little bride lord be with sister sariano lord as she continues up to the camp meeting we'll be up there too bless the missionary ministers bless everyone that's coming to the camp lord i pray that you should keep all the sickness away lord that we'll have a good time in you and bless brother ron and brother donnie they're going to speak up there lord i pray that you touch them father give us this day our daily bread i believe you have lord and i believe you give us more if we ask so we asked in the name of the lord jesus christ to give us more of you in your name we pray

you kids and i know it's tough on them on the teachers and uh monica you need one well come and get it don't be shy let it out just alicia you your home school you can't no that's right they're in public school okay brother gary get one for luke yep if y'all got grandkids yes sir anybody else now this is for school all right this is for going to school and we're going to pray listen i know it's tough on kids we see all this bullying and and then here we've got our sisters that are that are dressed different and they act different and and sometimes i know when um joyce hey joyce when when joyce and we were all going to school it wasn't really that bad right joyce it wasn't because because we were in that transition time between and like i said before when i was a young man a young boy most women wore dresses you didn't see hardly any pantsuits or and you definitely didn't see one and get ace and and ensley i'll get one all right okay how many two yep okay yes sir okay uh-huh all right all right but when we was growing up it you know you women wore dresses and didn't have any of these pant suits and stuff so so like that's what i'm saying with joyce and us it wasn't so much that it was in that transition period so she wasn't ridiculed as much as maybe you guys are now because they wear whatever to school now tighter the better the more showing the better i mean it's just the morals of the of the world has gone to the pot but i want y'all to uplift that moral take that mor the moral the moral standard that you live by let it be different right martin luther pin your book bag everybody got that and it'll stay in there all year and you ain't got to wash it you're not going to wash the anointing off of it right but just believe that god's going to be here to help us like i said before it's going to be tough it's a big transition some of you are going from grammar school to high school some of you going from high school to college but you know what god can be with you if you ask him to now don't take these prayer calls in the neck like the devil okay i'm sorry martin luther the whole world's against you martin luther said i want the world to know i'm against the world amen because he was against the catholic system that covered the whole world and when he came out of that thing they said martin luther said man you're i mean you know you're by the grace of god somebody didn't kill him actually because they didn't mind killing people who didn't believe in the catholic doctrine by the crusades that they had but let's pray that they'll have a good time they won't be bullied that everybody be fine and have a good time and you know what have good grades i saw where brother brown said one time that he prayed for sarah yeah sarah was gonna have a test and he said we went in and prayed and said she had a good she had a good test score he said oh god yeah yeah god can do that he said he'd bring you a remembrance but you got to study first now don't just lay in bed and say god i got a test tomorrow i'm not studying i'm going to just read this um i'm going to go on my tick tock or my whatever more and you just just feel me full he'll feel you full all right because you're going to have some zeros on the end of that test ain't gonna be a hundred either so you listen you gotta put forth an effort so let's put forth an effort be model students be students that i like where brother donnie reagan says he said we're known in the community as the skirt church so everywhere they go they say oh you go to the skirt church why because you always got a skirt on so i want y'all to to be a part of the spoken word church because you act different you ain't different you don't act like the world you ain't different so let's buy our heads and everybody pray dear heavenly father lord in the name of jesus the author and finisher of our faith lord what we've been talking about today lord fits right in with this for us to believe you father have faith lord not just hope i hope i have a good score i hope i'm going to do well but lord may they go in the building with confidence and lord as this time approaches lord i know that the schools now they're they're they're having to bring almost look like a a prison because they of all the shootings and the killings lord i pray that you everywhere that these children go that you'll protect that room lord and protect that building that they're in father and that your lord turn away the evil away from it father if it comes that way father we pray in the name of the lord jesus as you'll bless them with good grades lord may they be a shining light and a testimony to this world that god can live through a group of people especially a group of young people father we pray again for the adults and the teachers father the ones that are giving him their given them their lessons to learn lord we pray that you'll guide them by spiritual guidance all the ones that are homeschooling and all the ones that

you're a god that will hover over you'll send angels you'll quiet in heaven if a child needs you so i pray lord if they need anything may they as the old testament told the children said if you'll turn and look toward the temple i'll take care of you i'll save you lord i don't want them to look toward this building but i want them to look toward you lock the author and finisher of our faith what may they look to you for everything lord may they pray before a test may they pray before they go to school may they pray before if something's satan's always going to give them something he's going to always give them some glamour and glitter and all these different things father i pray that they'll know that and that they'll run away from it they'll get away from that evil thing father i pray that you give us good reports this year of our students and that you'll be with them and the teachers and the parents and the bus drivers and all the ones that has anything to do with it lord
