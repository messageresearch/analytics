[17:51] maybe we'll have enough time so Son of
[17:53] Man part 123.
[17:56] in the beginning was the word where was
[17:58] with God and the Word was God and that
[18:00] word was made flesh and dwelt among us
[18:02] and we beheld his glory the glory the
[18:03] only begotten of the father
[18:05] full of grace
[18:07] and Truth John 3 verse 3 said Jesus
[18:09] answers and said verily verily I say
[18:11] unto thee except a man be born again
[18:14] he cannot see
[18:16] the kingdom of God and that word see
[18:19] means what understand because remember
[18:21] he told the disciples he said the world
[18:23] see me no more
[18:25] but you'll see me
[18:27] you'll see me because I'll be with you
[18:29] even in you to the end of the age you
[18:31] may be seated in the Lord at his
[18:32] Blessing to the reading of the word and
[18:34] then Nicodemus you know looking back in
[18:37] the Old Testament Nicodemus is like how
[18:38] can a man be born when he's old
[18:41] how can I enter back into my mother's
[18:43] womb and be born
[18:44] and and Jesus said verily verily I say
[18:46] unto you except a man be born of water
[18:48] and of spirit he cannot enter the
[18:51] kingdom of God and we were talking about
[18:52] this this morning that's extremely
[18:55] important that we do it right
[18:57] it's extremely important that we do we
[19:00] we go through justification and we go
[19:02] through sanctification and we go through
[19:04] the baptism of the Holy Ghost because
[19:06] you can just you can get born again in
[19:08] one in one sitting
[19:10] it has happened
[19:12] oh look at the man you take people like
[19:14] on the day of Pentecost you said well
[19:15] they just the Holy Ghost fell on those
[19:17] people today at Pentecostal they just
[19:19] got the new birth but now remember
[19:21] foreign
[19:22] they had walked with Jesus for three and
[19:24] a half years they walked with the word
[19:26] the word was justifying and the Word was
[19:28] telling them I'm coming hang on a little
[19:31] bit this is not what you're going to get
[19:33] you're going to get the promise we'll
[19:34] read it in just a minute right before he
[19:36] left he laid it out he told him he said
[19:38] go to Jerusalem
[19:39] and you'll be endued with power from on
[19:41] high go there and wait and tarry all
[19:44] right so he told them where to go where
[19:46] to wait and that he was coming back and
[19:48] of course they the next question they
[19:50] asked him they said well are you going
[19:51] to restore the kingdom to Israel they
[19:53] thought he was still going to stay there
[19:54] but see they didn't understand but on
[19:56] the day of Pentecost you know they had a
[19:58] moment to where they're like oh man this
[19:59] is what he was talking about
[20:01] this is when the Holy Ghost is going to
[20:03] come inside and then do the work and we
[20:05] see what happened to him in the early
[20:06] church ages
[20:08] that's why that brother Bynum and I got
[20:11] it way over in the uh where it gets up
[20:14] there to the Holy Spirit but brother
[20:16] Ryan tells us he says you know the the
[20:18] maokai 4 has got to turn the hearts of
[20:20] the children back to the fathers well
[20:22] we're talking about what the fathers are
[20:24] doing now
[20:25] what they were doing the faith of the
[20:28] fathers
[20:29] all right taking the Babylon Pentecostal
[20:31] babies that had lost their first love
[20:33] that had went through six Church ages
[20:35] basically and had the word had been eat
[20:38] down by man's Creeds and man's ideas and
[20:41] it was not of any effect
[20:44] right as it was in the first church age
[20:47] so that's why brother Brown had a call
[20:49] by it Malachi had to call us back that
[20:52] Prophet called us back to those fathers
[20:56] to give us a chance to get the headstone
[20:59] back because the headstone will read it
[21:02] maybe it'll be next be Wednesday night
[21:04] probably I want to continue on before
[21:06] both Keith gets here but
[21:08] um The Headstone was rejected why was it
[21:11] rejected
[21:13] it had no power
[21:15] because if people took the power away
[21:16] from it
[21:18] the people
[21:19] Satan really Satan wanted to kill Jesus
[21:22] sure he did through the people but he's
[21:25] wanting to kill him again by killing his
[21:27] influence and that's what he done
[21:28] because he told him in the first church
[21:30] he said you've lost your first love I
[21:31] mean right there at the beginning
[21:33] and listen they were a powerful Church
[21:36] they had the Holy Ghost working in their
[21:37] life that Silver and Gold Have I None
[21:39] they walked in you know somebody lied
[21:40] against the holy ghost that fell dead
[21:45] we want that around
[21:47] well we're going to get it because the
[21:48] Bible promised us we'd have an anani
[21:50] since the fire again so it's going to
[21:51] happen all over again
[21:54] Bible even tells us there'll be a time
[21:56] when the sinner can't even sit here
[21:59] it's hard for some to see here anyway
[22:01] you get to squirming and all those kind
[22:03] of things walk out the door and don't
[22:04] come back and all that other stuff so
[22:06] but Jesus said very very I say and you
[22:08] accept a man be born of water and spirit
[22:10] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[22:13] so what is the entrance to the kingdom
[22:16] it is by the new birth
[22:19] by Jesus Christ no other way not by
[22:22] William Branham
[22:25] everybody with me
[22:26] he didn't come to preach us a new gospel
[22:29] he didn't come to give us a different
[22:31] Bible he didn't come and give us a
[22:33] different way to get born again
[22:35] but yet he's the most misunderstood as
[22:37] far as being born again because they
[22:38] said he taught it several different ways
[22:40] well he never did he always kept it
[22:42] exactly the way it was supposed to be
[22:44] he always yeah you know you hear people
[22:47] they they have that little point or
[22:50] angle that that brother Brown changed a
[22:52] lot in 1963 after the seals broke well
[22:55] the only thing he changed was is the
[22:57] things that he got wrong before he
[22:59] corrected them after
[23:01] he ain't changed the way you got born
[23:03] again they say he he changed the way
[23:06] that now it's just you just you know
[23:08] just boom realize who you are you know
[23:11] no
[23:13] praise God on the future home brother
[23:15] Branham said now this was after the
[23:17] seals broke and this was toward the end
[23:19] of his life
[23:19] he said I've preached the same message
[23:21] of justification sanctification the
[23:24] baptism the Holy Ghost he showed it all
[23:26] the way through the future home showed
[23:27] us how we went through it showed us how
[23:28] the world had to go through it all right
[23:30] so he didn't change
[23:31] the people changed his idea just like
[23:34] they have now they've changed it to
[23:36] everything in the world but there is a
[23:37] truth somewhere and I hope you find it
[23:40] I hope I find it I'm praying that I'm
[23:43] going to find it I believe we found it
[23:45] but that's for you to decide all right
[23:47] brother Billy I'm saying you except a
[23:49] man be born of water spirit he cannot
[23:51] enter into the kingdom of God for that
[23:54] which is born of the flesh is flesh and
[23:56] that which is born of the spirit the
[23:58] spirit look he said marble run
[24:00] come on Nicodemus you're the teacher of
[24:03] Israel and you can't understand this
[24:06] why you didn't understand it he didn't
[24:08] have the new birth
[24:10] he had a Old Testament idea
[24:13] all right that's some of our problems
[24:15] now we got people with Old Testament
[24:16] ideas
[24:18] whoops Acts 19 verse 1 said he came to
[24:22] pass it while Apollos was a Corinth Paul
[24:24] the messenger to the church age passed
[24:27] through the upper coast of Ephesus
[24:28] finding certain disciples now he didn't
[24:30] just find him he was watching he was
[24:32] listening to him preach
[24:34] because he said have you received the
[24:36] Holy Ghost since you believed well
[24:37] believe what he had to be able to listen
[24:39] to what they were saying he knew there
[24:42] was something missing because they were
[24:43] preaching
[24:44] John's gospel
[24:46] well John's gospel was found during
[24:48] John's age but John's gospel the door
[24:51] closed
[24:52] he was introduced to Messiah not to have
[24:55] a Ministry
[24:58] he was a messenger but he wasn't a
[25:00] church age messenger he was to introduce
[25:02] the head that was his job nothing else
[25:06] then you come now to where you see that
[25:08] the disciples Paul Peter James John they
[25:11] have the word of God for the hour and
[25:14] they're preaching and then here's Paul
[25:15] with the word with the message of the
[25:17] hour and he's listening to them
[25:19] preaching he says
[25:20] there's something missing here if y'all
[25:22] received the Holy Ghost since you
[25:23] believe
[25:24] and obviously they answered his question
[25:27] they said we don't know what you're
[25:29] talking about
[25:30] and that's probably that's basically
[25:32] what the people when the message of the
[25:34] hour came on the scene even with brother
[25:35] Branham they it had all been eroded so
[25:38] much to where they thought it was just
[25:39] the baptism or as we read this morning
[25:41] it's just shaking of hands or it's or
[25:44] it's you know shouting or speaking you
[25:45] know I mean he comes among the
[25:46] Pentecostals and I know they like they
[25:48] loved him for a time but when he told
[25:51] them he said look he said speaking in
[25:53] tongues it's not the evidence of the
[25:55] Holy Ghost Buddy they didn't like him no
[25:58] more
[25:59] because that's what they built their
[26:01] whole Doctrine on their whole Doctrine
[26:03] was built on you speak in tongues you
[26:05] got the Holy Ghost
[26:07] brother Brown told him he said that's
[26:08] not true
[26:09] he taught them the correct
[26:12] baptism the way to get baptized not just
[26:14] only in in G in the name of the Lord
[26:16] Jesus but how to get the Holy Spirit
[26:18] baptism all right now listen I'd rather
[26:21] have the Holy Ghost baptism right than
[26:23] my other baptism right
[26:26] if I get my Holy Ghost baptism right I
[26:29] will go get the other one right all
[26:30] right so everything's connected together
[26:33] so brother Brown's talking about Jesus's
[26:35] first Doctrine I'm gonna try to fly
[26:37] through this was you must be born again
[26:39] now why wasn't you must be born again
[26:41] because he was the one who was going to
[26:43] birth them
[26:44] and if they didn't understand him which
[26:46] they didn't and he knew they wasn't
[26:48] going to it's like brother random you
[26:50] know he stands there and he says you're
[26:51] not going to get this it's not for you
[26:53] he knew that the word was going forth he
[26:55] knew that the that the anointing was
[26:57] going out and it was not hitting
[26:59] anything
[27:01] during that whole week of the sales he
[27:03] was throwing he was throwing the the
[27:04] most perfect message that had ever been
[27:07] preached the seals were being open and
[27:10] they're just
[27:11] you know sitting there
[27:16] so he said you're not getting it it's
[27:18] not for you
[27:20] sometimes messages are preached and you
[27:22] wonder who it's for
[27:30] right is it my turn Lord must not have
[27:32] been it must have been brother George's
[27:33] term
[27:35] because he really needed it
[27:38] yeah who made you God
[27:42] yeah that was for sister Regina and we
[27:45] find out that
[27:47] I got you we find out there's so many
[27:50] different meanings that people put to it
[27:52] nearly all churches say You must be born
[27:56] again all right so every church and even
[27:57] every message Church knows you got to
[27:59] get born again but their way of getting
[28:01] born again versus other ways of getting
[28:03] born again sometimes they're not the
[28:05] same all right this church here believes
[28:08] that you need to be justified you need
[28:10] to be Sanctified and you need to be all
[28:12] those two to get the new birth not just
[28:15] the baptism of the Holy Ghost but the
[28:17] new birth
[28:18] all right be careful with your
[28:20] terminology because remember I'll read
[28:22] you a quote later later on down the road
[28:24] brother Brown said you can have the Holy
[28:25] Ghost on your spirit every day of your
[28:28] life and die and go to hell okay on your
[28:31] spirit realm he never said if you had
[28:33] the new birth
[28:35] say John didn't get the new birth John
[28:37] had the baptism in the Holy Ghost
[28:39] he had an anointing
[28:41] Elizabeth had an anointing all right
[28:43] that's hard to explain to people too
[28:45] because listen the Holy Ghost was not
[28:48] given to anyone's soul
[28:51] I'm even talking about the woman at the
[28:53] well
[28:54] the woman at the well brother Brown said
[28:55] there was eternal life and it sprang up
[28:57] I know those quotes but you got to
[28:59] remember
[29:00] she couldn't get the Holy Ghost in her
[29:02] soul before the disciples there's no way
[29:06] potentially yes because remember Jesus
[29:09] before he died
[29:11] he breathed on him and said receive ye
[29:13] the Holy Ghost now brother Brown said
[29:14] they did not receive it right then
[29:17] he said that was a promise that they
[29:20] were going to receive it because that
[29:22] Holy Ghost listen that Holy Ghost was
[29:24] bottled up inside of that man amen and
[29:27] it could not get out until they killed
[29:30] him
[29:31] to release the life to come back on me
[29:34] and you everybody with me on that amen
[29:37] that's the meaning of being born again
[29:39] it's that life
[29:40] coming inside of me not on me
[29:44] and changing my life
[29:47] so the methodists and everybody's got a
[29:50] different way
[29:51] but we know one thing's for sure we
[29:53] believe that you got to be justified as
[29:55] we were talking about this morning we
[29:57] got to be Sanctified and then we've got
[29:59] to come to the New Birth where there is
[30:02] a new creature a new creation
[30:04] all right old things are passed away
[30:06] behold all things have become new
[30:08] all right
[30:09] like I said this morning the whole
[30:11] problem is is when we when we get into
[30:14] trouble we want God to change our our
[30:17] you know around here
[30:20] we'll start with this guy first
[30:23] that's not yeah well I won't I won't
[30:26] listen I want a good wife and I want a
[30:29] good job
[30:35] you ought to be born again
[30:38] not much not you ought to be as you must
[30:40] if you'll start with getting born again
[30:42] God will help you with all that other
[30:43] stuff all right
[30:46] so like I said before
[30:48] quit trying to do that
[30:50] quit trying to change your world get
[30:53] changed yourself
[30:55] get a new attitude a new thought get a
[30:57] get a get a fire going inside there all
[31:01] right get something that you say man
[31:03] this is different
[31:06] I had lived this around this message for
[31:09] years grew up in it nine years old eight
[31:12] years old all the way up to 18 years old
[31:15] knew it like the back of my hand
[31:18] believed in serpent seed I knew that I
[31:21] knew my part my problem was at 18 years
[31:23] old
[31:25] everybody with me
[31:27] and I knew about marriage and divorce
[31:29] and I knew about all those other things
[31:30] but I was just lost as a Goose
[31:32] right yeah
[31:35] right I didn't get this guy changed he
[31:38] finally got this guy changed it had been
[31:40] different
[31:42] but I knew the message and I grew up on
[31:44] a Pew with a message church this one
[31:46] actually
[31:47] and all those things but that don't mean
[31:49] nothing
[31:51] you must be born again you must be
[31:54] changed from inside out
[31:57] it's all got to start from inside out
[32:04] skip through some of this
[32:05] you know Lord changed no change me
[32:10] it'll make you see your neighbor
[32:11] different
[32:12] you can never change your neighbor
[32:19] you're still what you were until you're
[32:21] actually born again of the spirit of God
[32:24] still what you were you can suppress it
[32:27] you can push it down you can just like
[32:29] try to hide it but it will get out yes
[32:33] sir that's right whatever you are will
[32:34] come out I'll promise you
[32:37] uh
[32:38] you're still what you were until you've
[32:41] actually got born again of the spirit of
[32:43] God it doesn't change you now he didn't
[32:45] say the spirit of God didn't he's
[32:47] talking about the Creed and the
[32:48] denomination all that won't change you
[32:50] your Creed join in church change your
[32:52] idea
[32:53] are your good intentions although as
[32:55] good as it might seem it's still not
[32:56] right there's something got to happen
[32:58] the new birth is an experience something
[33:01] that takes place
[33:04] and I know a lot of you are wondering
[33:06] you say well well do I have the new
[33:08] birth find an experience
[33:13] I mean a good one
[33:15] not just a good day versus a bad day not
[33:18] just a I got more money than I did last
[33:20] month I must be born again no you got an
[33:23] experience
[33:25] well some of you most of you in this
[33:28] building sisters have had children right
[33:30] right
[33:32] so you know what I'm talking about you
[33:35] know you had that baby because you had
[33:37] an experience
[33:38] amen you were there
[33:41] and what'd it do it changed your life
[33:46] well I'll play it man anyway your sister
[33:48] don't have to it changed your life
[33:50] started having them yangans change your
[33:53] life so the new birth's the same way if
[33:55] you get born again it'll change your
[33:57] life it'll make you have an experience
[34:00] and look something that takes place yes
[34:03] nail that thing down
[34:07] sister Ruth should not hear him she's
[34:09] not feeling good she's probably watching
[34:11] in so she really don't care if I use it
[34:13] for an example I'd use a refuse here
[34:15] anyway but
[34:18] um sister Ruth and I go way back we grew
[34:21] up together and her dad was in this
[34:24] church and she was a little bitty thing
[34:25] in the church and and I watched her and
[34:28] I went away and she kind of floated away
[34:30] and then back and forth and and the
[34:33] other day last year when we were
[34:34] baptizing her
[34:36] you know you can and I'm just going to
[34:39] be I don't know I've got work I'm like
[34:42] Claude I'm gonna be honest with you were
[34:43] you gonna lie no I'm gonna be honest
[34:46] with you when a person looks at you and
[34:49] goes
[34:50] I'm tired
[34:52] I want a change
[34:55] I want something that I can put down
[34:59] and she looked at me out there in the
[35:00] water and she stood to me she said this
[35:02] is it
[35:03] now when she said this is it to me that
[35:05] sounded so different
[35:10] what do they call it a hollow promises
[35:11] we've heard of hollow promises you know
[35:13] promises that don't have anything into
[35:15] it it's just something that you say at
[35:16] the in the moment but when somebody
[35:18] comes to a juncture in their life when
[35:21] somebody comes to a place in their life
[35:22] to where like I said you're sick and
[35:24] tired of being sick and tired she was
[35:26] sick and tired of being pulled this way
[35:27] and pulled that way and pushed this way
[35:29] and push that way she said this is it
[35:32] and when she looked at me I said I
[35:35] believe you believe that pretty much I
[35:37] don't know I didn't say exactly that but
[35:38] I when I looked at it I thought man she
[35:40] really believes this time because
[35:41] there's a lot of people I mean come on
[35:43] we baptized people three or four or five
[35:45] times don't need to but if you want it
[35:48] we'll do it but you need to nail her
[35:51] down one day and say look
[35:53] this is it
[35:57] so she did so that's what I'm saying
[35:59] there's a there's a place in your time
[36:01] in your life where something's going to
[36:02] click it's going to have to
[36:04] because you've got your normal world
[36:06] everybody with me here for a minute
[36:08] before you start going to sleep I'm
[36:09] going to get to you okay
[36:11] are you ready
[36:14] we've got our normalcy
[36:16] right we got our work we got our
[36:19] kids and husbands job blah blah blah
[36:22] right
[36:23] but there is something that you come in
[36:25] here to sit today that there is a small
[36:28] world inside of your big world
[36:31] everybody with me here there's a small
[36:33] world inside of your big world
[36:35] and that small world is the reason
[36:37] you're here not the big world
[36:39] all right you've took a time out of your
[36:42] big world to come into this small world
[36:44] but remember that small world is worth
[36:46] way more than ten thousand of these
[36:49] other worlds all right right ten
[36:52] thousand worlds man that's your your
[36:53] soul so that's what you brought here
[36:55] today you didn't bring your body here
[36:57] because maybe your body didn't want to
[36:58] come
[37:00] maybe your body's tired
[37:02] arm hurts
[37:04] everything hurts
[37:09] but you brought your soul here today
[37:12] your soul is what we're talking to
[37:14] your soul is what God is speaking to God
[37:18] is not speaking to your flesh because
[37:20] your flesh only reacts to what that God
[37:22] was inside
[37:24] so you brought your little world you
[37:26] brought your little you brought your
[37:27] soul here and if that soul is worth ten
[37:29] thousand worlds then let's talk to it
[37:31] that's what needs to be born again let's
[37:34] don't get an anointing that just makes
[37:36] us feel born again
[37:38] it will not stay that way because when
[37:41] you go out into your big world
[37:43] this will dissolve
[37:45] into nothing and it'll become the big
[37:47] world again
[37:51] I may not ever be able to say that again
[37:53] but I said it one time
[37:56] but that's what you
[37:58] [Applause]
[38:01] what you drew you here one of the two
[38:08] isn't that the truth
[38:10] you either wanted to come or you came
[38:12] because XYZ kids especially got drove to
[38:16] church all my life
[38:18] I was drugged as a kid all my life I
[38:19] drove to church every Sunday every
[38:21] Wednesday
[38:24] but you know what when you get the
[38:25] person inside of you when that reason to
[38:27] come
[38:29] is that you want to listen
[38:31] to somebody tell you about that person
[38:34] that's inside of you
[38:36] to me that's the connection that comes
[38:38] together and it can't come apart
[38:40] see that's what you're looking for
[38:41] you're looking for something that settle
[38:44] your soul
[38:45] bring you to church get you around other
[38:48] believers and listen we can speak our
[38:51] problems and we can speak our ups and
[38:54] our Downs
[38:55] and now what we're here for that's what
[38:57] we're here for to bring testimony or to
[38:59] bring I should have done this but pray
[39:02] for me because this is bothering me
[39:05] this this I have a problem with
[39:07] if you don't have one pray for me I
[39:10] probably got yours
[39:14] because I have them it's called me
[39:17] but the reason we have to be born again
[39:19] is because the Bible teaches us that we
[39:21] were born in sin all came same way shape
[39:23] and iniquity come to this world speaking
[39:25] lies then that shows us that our nature
[39:27] look our nature that's the soul our
[39:31] nature
[39:33] was what
[39:34] sinful
[39:37] we're no good to begin with
[39:39] so we cannot claim anything by our
[39:41] shrewdness sincerity and how great we
[39:44] are or how little we are or whatever
[39:46] more
[39:47] we are all together wrong to begin with
[39:49] right
[39:51] so you can't say oh you can say it but
[39:54] you can't say God made me this way
[39:59] you made yourself that way
[40:03] get that way because
[40:09] my spirit
[40:11] upon All Flesh
[40:13] all right I'm pouring it out
[40:15] you either got to receive it or reject
[40:17] it one of the two you got to make a
[40:19] decision and your sons and your
[40:21] daughters are prophesy old man dream
[40:22] dream young man see Visions we'll
[40:24] continue through this a little fast and
[40:25] upon the service and handmaids he's not
[40:27] losing leaving anybody out that's right
[40:29] he's going to pour out his spirit so
[40:31] that you can either receive it or you
[40:33] can be
[40:34] deceived
[40:36] and it shall come to pass to whosoever
[40:37] shall call in the name of the Lord shall
[40:39] be delivered for in Mount Zion in
[40:41] Jerusalem shall be Deliverance as the
[40:43] Lord has said in the remnant whom the
[40:45] Lord shall call so there's the Holy
[40:48] Ghost spread out among the whole world
[40:50] yes if everybody now there's eight
[40:53] billion people in this world now it's
[40:55] one up to 8 billion now there's eight
[40:57] billion people in this world all eight
[40:59] billion could get the Holy Ghost today
[41:01] if they'd want it
[41:02] and God would be no less God he'd be
[41:04] more happy than than he is now because
[41:07] everybody would accept him but he knows
[41:09] that everybody's not going to all right
[41:12] so now Hebrews 9 we were talking about
[41:15] Tabernacle this morning there was an
[41:16] actual Tabernacle in the wilderness that
[41:19] God set up that people could come to and
[41:21] the and the uh high priest could come to
[41:24] that would not take away their sins but
[41:26] it would cover them and keep God from
[41:28] killing them
[41:29] it will keep God to where he didn't
[41:31] couldn't come down through that and kill
[41:33] him
[41:35] that was the covering or the Capo they
[41:37] were covered
[41:39] but God didn't want that God wants
[41:42] children that he can eradicate sin take
[41:45] that old nature out and put his nature
[41:48] in
[41:49] he wants children to act like him yes
[41:54] and that's what he was heading towards
[41:56] but he couldn't just drive Jesus down I
[41:59] mean why didn't he just bring Jesus in
[42:00] the Garden of Eden
[42:02] you ever thought about that
[42:05] close Abraham was part of the plan
[42:08] the part of the plan he saw by what for
[42:11] knowledge he saw all these Isaiah
[42:13] everybody had a part to play to fulfill
[42:16] a part of him
[42:19] everybody with me that would fulfill a
[42:21] part of him Abraham what father of our
[42:24] faith Moses you'll raise up a prophet
[42:26] Prophet lock unto me
[42:28] all right all the identifications were
[42:31] in the Old Testament prophets the
[42:32] different ones
[42:35] but remember they looked for one to come
[42:39] and Jesus stood there one day and he
[42:41] said the prophets would have loved to
[42:44] have been in this day
[42:47] but now listen he said but a greater
[42:51] is here today
[42:54] I say that the same thing here
[42:56] sure it would have been wonderful Ben
[42:58] and brother Brown's day
[43:00] but you know what
[43:01] you'd have been real old
[43:04] and you'd have had a long journey but
[43:06] thank God he gave us an opportunity that
[43:09] we have people like sister cleaning
[43:11] different ones that wasn't the that was
[43:13] that could tell us the scenario
[43:15] of what went on while brother Ram was
[43:18] here but you got to catch a message of
[43:19] the hour inside here
[43:21] uh to me it's like it's like brother uh
[43:25] um who was oh brother Tom your dad
[43:26] always say he's the memo War Stories
[43:28] well everybody likes old War Stories I
[43:30] don't but I don't want that to be part
[43:32] of my life I want to have my own story
[43:35] all right this is my story this is my
[43:38] song what praising my savior
[43:40] so I want these things to be brought up
[43:42] present day yes so today this is present
[43:45] day amen all right to present day to get
[43:49] born again is what not to go into a
[43:51] temple to go into a physical building
[43:54] and go through one place and go through
[43:57] another place and meet God there
[44:01] that was for one man back in the Old
[44:03] Testament that was for the high priest
[44:08] but the Holy Ghost now though is
[44:10] signifying and using that
[44:13] as we were talking about here this
[44:15] morning that the way into the holiest of
[44:16] all was not yet made manifest while as
[44:19] the first Tabernacle was yet standing
[44:21] and as I said again there was and if you
[44:24] don't understand it ask a question
[44:26] because there the new birth means it
[44:29] means that God took took something out
[44:31] it took the old nature out of your soul
[44:33] and put his nature in all right and that
[44:37] could only be by the releasing of the
[44:41] Holy Ghost
[44:42] the releasing of that Spirit right well
[44:45] in the Garden of Eden God could not he
[44:48] released it to Adam he released it to
[44:51] Eve
[44:52] and they were supposed to start the
[44:54] family of God everybody with me they
[44:56] were supposed to start the family of God
[44:59] but God knew as brother Ram tells us
[45:01] that God knew when he put him in flesh
[45:03] they'd fall but here he is holding
[45:06] savior Redeemer healer he's going to
[45:09] come yes
[45:10] see he sent that first Covenant and they
[45:12] broke it
[45:15] listen he sent his man of the hour
[45:19] Adam and he broke it
[45:21] all right
[45:23] and he knew that but he gave him a
[45:25] chance
[45:27] so he withheld that that taking of the
[45:30] nature out and putting the nature of God
[45:33] in
[45:36] to when Christ came on Earth
[45:38] he brought that nature with him
[45:40] and by with me
[45:43] and that was Perfection he knew that
[45:45] over here they couldn't be Perfection
[45:46] bulls and goats can't perfect you
[45:49] all right because remember if they'd
[45:50] have kept they kept making that
[45:52] sacrifice every year every day
[45:55] who was it Saul uh no so
[45:58] um
[45:58] Solomon
[46:00] that was one day when they made so many
[46:02] sacrifices for the people they said you
[46:05] couldn't even number them they forgot
[46:06] how they couldn't even count them they
[46:08] were so many sacrifices made
[46:11] when they dedicated the temple and all
[46:14] that they gathered everybody together
[46:15] and they started confessing their sins
[46:16] and they just started killing animals
[46:18] well praise God we don't have to do that
[46:20] today
[46:21] praise God we didn't have to drag a lamb
[46:24] in the building or a turtle dove or
[46:26] whatever it was or a cow
[46:28] and but you brought yourself yes sir
[46:33] the Bible tells you to be a what a
[46:35] Living Sacrifice
[46:38] holy and acceptable unto the Lord and
[46:41] that's what God was looking at but he
[46:43] couldn't give it because of sin
[46:46] but if there had been no sin there had
[46:48] been no savior
[46:52] pretty simple
[46:54] if Adam would have never had a headache
[46:58] there'd be no healer
[47:00] there's been no need for it
[47:03] but as the need was God had to allow
[47:07] them knowing that plan would work and no
[47:09] one down through the Old Testament that
[47:10] he could use types and shadows but that
[47:13] he would have to come
[47:15] according to Genesis 3 15 he would have
[47:17] to come and not just get with him
[47:21] get in him
[47:26] and then he was in them
[47:28] that's our stage he's in us now it's
[47:31] wonderful if he's above us it's
[47:33] wonderful he's with us I don't want him
[47:35] standing beside me today that's right
[47:39] that's right well I'll make you quiet
[47:43] because I can be fooled
[47:44] because I'm an individual but if I got
[47:46] him inside of me
[47:50] I got him inside of me see that will
[47:53] make the comer there unto perfect where
[47:55] the blood of bulls and goats couldn't
[47:57] put the blood of bulls and ghosts only
[47:59] as brother Brown tells us pushes it
[48:01] pushed that sand to Calvary but when he
[48:04] got to Calvary he said lay it on me
[48:07] I'll take it all
[48:09] but remember their position as we were
[48:12] talking about this morning their
[48:13] position was they can't be made perfect
[48:15] without the bride being made perfect
[48:17] first
[48:19] how you gonna make the attendance
[48:22] perfect before you make your bride
[48:24] perfect
[48:26] everybody with me the bride's got to be
[48:29] perfect first
[48:30] because she's part of him she is him as
[48:34] Eve was part of Adam back in the Garden
[48:36] of Eden so we're just rolling right back
[48:39] to the right back to the same place
[48:41] where we were thought that we started
[48:42] from
[48:44] it we're just not we're coming by sex
[48:46] now but by sex to get our body here and
[48:49] then by spiritual multiplication to get
[48:53] our soul redeemed
[48:55] that pushed the two together and if we
[48:57] if we have to pass away that's go this
[49:00] is because of the Fall
[49:03] but you can't blame this staying the way
[49:05] it is
[49:07] because of the Fall
[49:09] I'm talking about your soul when I do
[49:11] this I'm talking about your soul the
[49:12] inner being of you the one that the
[49:14] motivator the one that makes you do the
[49:16] things that you do all right
[49:19] they could not make him that did the
[49:21] service perfect that's pertaining to the
[49:22] conscience so in other words
[49:24] make a sacrifice still a sinner make the
[49:28] sacrifice still a sinner but Christ
[49:30] being made a high priest of good things
[49:31] to come by a greater and more perfect
[49:33] Tabernacle what his flesh
[49:35] not made with hands they needed to say
[49:37] not of this building neither by the
[49:39] blood of ghosts and cows but by his own
[49:41] blood he entered and once the holy Place
[49:42] having obtained look having obtained
[49:45] Eternal Redemption for us
[49:48] amen he had to get it
[49:56] his body was not eternal
[49:58] he was not a complete Eternal person
[50:01] right
[50:03] he had a body it wasn't a sinful body
[50:06] but it was made to come into this sinful
[50:08] world to take on mine in your sin
[50:11] and then he was perfected yes
[50:15] and eternal after he'd come out of the
[50:17] grave
[50:19] you know every person is packed stone is
[50:22] going to do the same thing
[50:24] all those that have passed on folks
[50:27] they're not coming back to do something
[50:29] something they're coming back with an
[50:31] eternal body
[50:33] their death has done nothing but just
[50:35] put them in a place of holding and
[50:38] waiting till we come to Perfection on
[50:41] this side and when we do they're just
[50:43] going to step over here and we're not
[50:44] going to have to uh speak nothing to
[50:47] them they're done they're complete
[50:49] they're finished
[50:51] we don't have to speak their new body
[50:52] they're just gonna
[50:54] come right back into here pick up their
[50:56] body they're ready to go
[50:58] how much more shall the blood of Jesus
[51:01] or Christ who through the eternal spirit
[51:03] offered himself without spot to God
[51:05] Purge your conscience from dead Works to
[51:07] serve the Living God and for this cause
[51:09] he is a mediator of the New Testament
[51:11] that by means of death for the
[51:13] Redemption of the transgression that
[51:15] were under the first testament first
[51:17] testament old testament all right they
[51:21] which are called might receive the
[51:22] promise of Eternal inheritance New
[51:24] Testament
[51:26] the New Testament in my blood where a
[51:28] testament is there must be a death of
[51:30] that testator so Jesus stood and he said
[51:33] look I'm the New Testament
[51:35] I'm going to give you this new way
[51:37] remember I've been reading to you bro
[51:38] where Jesus said a new commandment I
[51:41] give you
[51:42] it was all new that's why Nicodemus had
[51:45] a problem with it it was all new that's
[51:47] why listen today if this is all new to
[51:49] you that's okay
[51:52] you must be born again
[51:54] that don't change that
[51:56] but it can be a new way
[52:00] how can you tell the world
[52:03] but just if you're just a good Baptist I
[52:05] mean man you can just you shake your
[52:07] hand and and
[52:09] you sign your name and
[52:12] remembering good standing and
[52:14] you ain't gotta go to church no more
[52:17] once saved always saved
[52:20] some of y'all already doing that
[52:23] um
[52:24] but anyway
[52:27] but what about this new way though that
[52:28] we're talking about bring that person
[52:29] and set them in here and say look man
[52:31] you got to be justified well I believe
[52:33] the Lord Jesus Christ
[52:34] and I will save you can't you and you
[52:36] can't deny that they did
[52:39] but you got to go on with God
[52:42] there's more to that
[52:45] or to that
[52:47] that's a whole new testament to that
[52:49] well we're going to talk about Paul says
[52:51] grow up
[52:52] Desiring the sincere milk of the word
[52:54] but then growing on up we're going to
[52:56] get to that going on up this way
[52:59] so we know as brother Bob we were
[53:02] talking about this morning Hebrews 11
[53:04] verse 39 and these all all that whole
[53:07] Hall of faith in the Old Testament they
[53:09] obtained a good report through faith
[53:11] they received not the promise listen the
[53:14] promise was you're going to live
[53:17] eternally in a flesh body that is your
[53:21] promise
[53:23] I don't care about no other problems
[53:26] oh yeah there's others
[53:29] there's anointings
[53:31] but if you're not born again if you
[53:33] don't receive the promise that God said
[53:35] you're going to live here
[53:38] eternally in a body that's got Flesh on
[53:41] it
[53:42] and it's your flesh it's not somebody
[53:44] else's
[53:47] see that's another thing you take
[53:49] somebody from a denomination and you
[53:51] bring them in here and say look man what
[53:52] do you think I'm gonna get well I I
[53:54] listen I have experienced that
[53:58] I went to church with a guy one time
[54:01] Mark Gunner he just got saved and he was
[54:04] a Baptist and I mean he was just I wish
[54:06] some of y'all had a little bit of that
[54:08] he was just so excited
[54:10] he wanted me to go to church with him
[54:12] and listen to this brother preach well
[54:13] this brother gets up and preach unless
[54:15] that's what he preaches them he preaches
[54:17] on when
[54:19] um Samson
[54:20] they made him mad remember Samson had a
[54:22] little bit of a temper they made Samson
[54:24] mad so instead of uh killing a bunch of
[54:27] people he just took a couple of foxes
[54:32] read your Bible
[54:34] he tied their tails together and set
[54:36] them on fire and sent him out through
[54:38] the wheat field well they'd just burned
[54:39] all our wheat up oh they were mad well
[54:42] he was preaching on that how that God
[54:44] would do that with you you know he'll
[54:46] light the tale of a fox and send it
[54:47] through your life and he just burned
[54:48] everything up
[54:50] but we got outside
[54:52] I knew he had a rough voice I've been
[54:54] around smokers all my life
[54:56] he had this Gruff voice you know it's
[54:58] just it just didn't come from just their
[55:01] mom and daddy it came from a camel and
[55:03] Pall Mall and and Marlboro you know the
[55:06] Marlboro Man
[55:08] seven so he goes out soon as he walks
[55:10] out the door I mean he's you know laying
[55:12] that pack of cigarettes out
[55:14] he goes to smoking and
[55:17] one of the brothers did say well now and
[55:19] he got the coffin they got the coffin I
[55:21] mean he was just coughing coughing
[55:22] coughing I think Daddy went with me but
[55:24] he was confident we were kind of
[55:25] giggling at him he was coughing though
[55:27] he couldn't get somebody would say
[55:28] something to him he was like yeah
[55:30] you know couldn't get nothing but smoke
[55:32] out and somebody said well brother I
[55:35] ain't gonna call his name but brother so
[55:37] and so said said said you're gonna die
[55:39] if you don't quit smoking
[55:42] and this is what he said he put that
[55:43] cigarette in his mouth
[55:45] and he said I ain't worried about this
[55:48] body
[55:48] because I'm gonna get me a new one
[55:53] and that's been probably 15 years ago he
[55:56] may
[55:58] not be seeing that at the moment
[56:00] but that's his whole thing was it
[56:02] doesn't matter what I do with this one
[56:04] in other words somehow it got detached
[56:07] from my Christian experience
[56:09] and I'm going to get this new one God's
[56:11] gonna just throw me another one in there
[56:13] because that's when I abused
[56:15] no wrong answer Ghost Rider nope
[56:19] no you're attached to your flesh and
[56:21] you're going to be with your flesh until
[56:23] you either go to hell or go to heaven
[56:30] but listen that's a Doctrine
[56:32] that's a doctrine that they put on the
[56:34] people that it's okay if you drink a
[56:36] little smoke a little you know
[56:39] because this body we're just going to
[56:40] throw it out you know get us another one
[56:43] no
[56:44] the Bible says if you abuse this thing
[56:46] you're gonna have trouble
[56:49] Hebrews 11 verse 39 so these all having
[56:52] obtained a good report through faith
[56:53] receive not the promise the promise of
[56:56] eternal life in their soul
[56:58] God having some better thing for us that
[57:02] they without us should not be made
[57:04] perfect but they're going to be made
[57:06] perfect I believe when we come to
[57:09] Perfection wherever they are they're
[57:11] going to come to Perfection too all
[57:13] right so you can fill in the blanks
[57:15] every how you want to I just know
[57:16] there's one thing the Bible says
[57:20] they're not for they're not fully
[57:21] matured yet
[57:24] that's what the Bible just said
[57:26] they without us
[57:28] so
[57:30] basically they can't get anywhere
[57:33] without us getting somewhere first
[57:35] and like I said before God has bestowed
[57:38] everything on this bride
[57:41] Best of the Best
[57:43] best ministers
[57:45] best teaching
[57:46] best message
[57:48] best people to listen best people to
[57:50] talk to best people to fellowship with
[57:52] that's his people that's his bride
[57:59] Troy's not gonna give a second
[58:02] he's giving us first
[58:08] Peter said repent and be baptized
[58:09] everyone in the name of Jesus Christ for
[58:11] their mission of sins and you shall
[58:12] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost for
[58:15] the promise there's your promise for the
[58:17] promise what of receiving the gift of
[58:19] the Holy Ghost is unto you your children
[58:21] all them that are far off that's me even
[58:24] as man the Lord Our God shall call
[58:26] Brother Ramen blasphemus names he said
[58:29] look the reason that there's so much
[58:30] confusion today about the Holy Spirit is
[58:32] not correctly taught I believe it's the
[58:35] baptism is taught just say baptism just
[58:37] like you say automobile but listen
[58:40] there's a lot more to an automobiles
[58:42] than just say an automobile that's
[58:43] pretty much what he was saying because
[58:44] looks and when you talk about the
[58:46] baptism of the Holy Spirit there's a lot
[58:48] goes with that see there's a lot goes
[58:51] with that and here is what I think that
[58:53] God is proving he's proven the holy
[58:55] spirit is here what is he saying the
[58:57] holy spirit's saying through brother
[58:58] Branham listen to what I got to say
[59:01] because this is the holy spirit talking
[59:03] to you
[59:04] without him puffing up saying you got to
[59:06] listen to me bless God no you didn't
[59:08] have to but it just was the vessel that
[59:10] God wanted to use at the time
[59:13] to get the message to us
[59:16] I thank God for that
[59:18] he could have just left us hanging
[59:20] right he could have just said hey like
[59:22] what brother Brown say I'm gonna try to
[59:24] find that quote brother Ryan said if I
[59:25] was God I'd tell you one time
[59:28] and he said I wouldn't tell you no more
[59:30] I tell you one time and if you didn't do
[59:32] what I said then out you go
[59:35] well praise God God didn't do that
[59:38] he's given us 60 something years to get
[59:40] this thing right
[59:42] starting with a new birth yes
[59:46] now here's Ezekiel
[59:49] therefore saying to the house of Israel
[59:50] thus saith the Lord God I do this for
[59:52] your sake o House of Israel but I don't
[59:55] I do not for your sake no House of
[59:57] Israel but for mine holy namesake which
[1:00:00] you have profaned among the heathen
[1:00:03] whether you went uh that's us and I will
[1:00:06] sanctify my great name which was
[1:00:07] profaned among the Heathen which you
[1:00:10] have profaned in the midst of them and
[1:00:12] the Heathen shall know that I am the
[1:00:14] Lord saith the Lord God when I shall be
[1:00:17] Sanctified in you
[1:00:20] amen
[1:00:21] see I didn't get to it this morning but
[1:00:24] what cleans your uncleanness
[1:00:28] if I may say it that way when we get to
[1:00:31] that scenario where the unclean spirit's
[1:00:33] gone out of you why
[1:00:39] clean your house
[1:00:41] and he's not a hireling I know that but
[1:00:43] something has come in there's a there's
[1:00:45] a there's something come in there's Surf
[1:00:47] Pro or somebody like that is come in you
[1:00:49] behind you become a mess
[1:00:52] you stink
[1:00:54] you're full of smoke
[1:00:56] everybody know what Servpro is
[1:00:58] right right when something happens some
[1:01:00] catastrophe something burns down they
[1:01:02] come in and man they supposedly put the
[1:01:04] thing back to where you don't even Smell
[1:01:06] Smoke and all that stuff well you know
[1:01:07] what that's God
[1:01:09] God's my Servpro
[1:01:11] call him up
[1:01:13] say hey clean my house out
[1:01:16] because listen you gotta want it yes
[1:01:19] he's not going to just walk in and say
[1:01:21] I'm cleaning this out
[1:01:23] I wish you'd have done it to me 30
[1:01:25] something years 40 years ago
[1:01:30] but it wasn't time
[1:01:33] because he's a gentleman
[1:01:34] and I had to ask him
[1:01:36] can you come into my heart
[1:01:38] can you come and clean me up because I'm
[1:01:40] a mess
[1:01:42] I've tried
[1:01:45] I might have wiped a little off over
[1:01:47] here or or dabbed a little over here or
[1:01:50] or you know water will clean you a
[1:01:53] little bit but it takes a little soap
[1:01:55] and scrubbing to get the rest of it off
[1:01:56] right okay so you try to do that but
[1:01:59] there's a time when you just say God I'm
[1:02:01] just a burning mess
[1:02:03] and I want to get rid of all this so
[1:02:05] that's who comes in and burns out that
[1:02:07] unclean spirit
[1:02:08] okay all right so the unclean Spirit
[1:02:10] goes out why because something comes in
[1:02:12] and burns it out but remember it burns
[1:02:14] it out and then it waits on you
[1:02:19] it waits on you to decide that that
[1:02:23] person stays or leaves
[1:02:26] you with me you understand what I'm
[1:02:28] talking about
[1:02:29] because if not if he leaves then it's
[1:02:31] empty the Bible says and then those
[1:02:34] Seven Devils come back and they enter
[1:02:35] into your house all right make it a lot
[1:02:38] worse
[1:02:40] for I will take you from among the
[1:02:42] Heathen and gather you out of all
[1:02:44] countries and will bring you into your
[1:02:46] own land
[1:02:47] what is Our Land listen we Gentiles
[1:02:49] don't have a piece of land
[1:02:52] hey man
[1:02:54] Israel literally has a piece of land
[1:02:56] brother George Smith asked me the other
[1:02:58] day he you know he was up at the at in
[1:03:01] Tennessee and he asked me he said hey
[1:03:02] why don't you go to Israel with me I
[1:03:03] said I said how much is it and he told
[1:03:05] me you know
[1:03:07] eight thousand dollars or something like
[1:03:09] that you know I said George I think I'll
[1:03:11] just wait and go over there for free
[1:03:16] he looked at me and I said
[1:03:19] you know I'll go over there in the
[1:03:20] Millennium I won't need an airplane
[1:03:22] ticket
[1:03:23] I just traveled like a thought
[1:03:26] and I said you know what the mosque of
[1:03:28] Omar is going to be gone because you
[1:03:30] know it gets blowed up the mosque of
[1:03:32] Omar is going to be gone really don't
[1:03:34] care about the thing anyway because it's
[1:03:35] a Muslim deal and then a Christian Dale
[1:03:38] I said so I'll just be able to walk over
[1:03:40] there and I said I'll promise you they
[1:03:41] won't be an AK-47 pointing at me either
[1:03:43] they won't be a Palestinian want to
[1:03:45] wobble bomb at me so I think I'll just
[1:03:47] waiting on a millennium if y'all want to
[1:03:49] we'll all just get together we'll have a
[1:03:51] little tour bus thing we'll just have a
[1:03:52] tour we'll go through
[1:03:57] but they literally have a land
[1:04:00] Israel is promised that square P or not
[1:04:03] square that long piece of real real
[1:04:06] estate I'm talking about real land God
[1:04:08] given that that's their Promised Land
[1:04:10] see I promise Lance the baptism of all
[1:04:12] ago and we take it where we go and it
[1:04:16] didn't cost a dime to get there and it
[1:04:17] doesn't cost a dime to have it
[1:04:19] but he promised these people of his a
[1:04:22] piece of property
[1:04:24] and that's going to be there forever
[1:04:27] eternity that's where the new city is
[1:04:29] brother round said right
[1:04:32] then when I sprinkle clean water upon
[1:04:34] you and you shall be clean
[1:04:35] from all your filthiness and your Idols

[1:04:43] within you and I will take away the
[1:04:45] Stony heart so we started with a Stony
[1:04:46] heart
[1:04:49] so take it out of your flesh and I'll
[1:04:50] give you a heart of Flesh and I will put
[1:04:53] my spirit
[1:04:55] within you
[1:04:57] okay now he's going to give you a what
[1:04:58] right here is going to give you a new
[1:05:00] heart and a new spirit
[1:05:02] that's not the Holy Spirit
[1:05:04] all right everybody with me
[1:05:07] that is your sanctification
[1:05:11] the justification is the new heart
[1:05:13] you do get a new way listen if if you
[1:05:16] knew that you had
[1:05:17] I'm not going to ask for people raise
[1:05:20] your hands but
[1:05:21] some people can accumulate parking
[1:05:23] tickets you know and all kind of stuff
[1:05:24] so I'm not looking at anybody I'm just
[1:05:27] I'm just not looking at anybody that's
[1:05:29] got on a pink top that's sitting next to
[1:05:31] Boyd
[1:05:32] um but
[1:05:33] but
[1:05:35] we're just family we just confess our
[1:05:38] sins
[1:05:42] Regina said leave me alone
[1:05:46] but you know we accumulate we we
[1:05:49] accumulate all these things
[1:05:51] and they're against us
[1:05:53] and they're against our account
[1:05:55] and you can't get rid of them
[1:05:57] you got to go to the forward judge
[1:05:59] right
[1:06:01] but what about if
[1:06:04] it's complete through this what if you
[1:06:07] could go before the judge and the judge
[1:06:09] says
[1:06:10] what are you doing here
[1:06:14] what sins are you talking about
[1:06:18] but they don't make you feel so
[1:06:20] liberated
[1:06:22] it sure would boys bank accounts that's
[1:06:24] for sure
[1:06:25] but it would make you feel we're just
[1:06:28] family and it would make you feel so lit
[1:06:32] wouldn't it come on
[1:06:33] if you had this load of dead on you
[1:06:37] I don't care what it is XYZ parking
[1:06:39] tickets I you know what I didn't really
[1:06:40] remember that but now anyway parking
[1:06:43] tickets dad of your house you know dead

[1:06:54] that burden stays with you all the time
[1:06:58] especially parking tickets
[1:07:00] that you can see the you know the stack
[1:07:02] stack up like this but you can but you
[1:07:06] can get free from that
[1:07:09] you can get free from that
[1:07:11] go before the judge
[1:07:14] and say I'm sorry
[1:07:19] if you'll help me with this right here I
[1:07:21] won't do it no more
[1:07:22] if you'll help me with this right here
[1:07:25] but now God forbid if you help if God
[1:07:28] helps you with this right here and you
[1:07:29] do it again
[1:07:32] right
[1:07:34] I mean we might do
[1:07:36] it when I got that load of sin I knew I
[1:07:39] was XYZ
[1:07:41] you can put whatever you were XYZ but my
[1:07:44] XYZ was ever what I did back 20 years in
[1:07:47] my in my sin in life but to know that
[1:07:51] God will not ever remember that again
[1:07:57] man that ought to perk you up
[1:08:00] that already just that just that
[1:08:03] not the part where he puts the Holy
[1:08:05] Ghost Inside and makes you Eternal it's
[1:08:07] just that part where you say God I got
[1:08:10] this load of dead on me
[1:08:12] amen right now it's gone yes
[1:08:15] he gives you a new spirit
[1:08:20] to be able to deal with it
[1:08:24] I'll take away your Stony heart I'll
[1:08:26] take away your debt
[1:08:28] I'll take away your load of sin
[1:08:30] and although it may be simple but let me
[1:08:32] tell you something if we can't get down
[1:08:34] to where we we we know that God has
[1:08:37] forgive us then what did we what did
[1:08:39] we've been talking about uh brother
[1:08:41] kindness
[1:08:43] if you can't forgive
[1:08:47] sin
[1:08:49] from your brother
[1:08:52] God can't forgive you or your parking
[1:08:55] ticket
[1:08:57] or whatever it is
[1:08:59] God can't forgive you that wow
[1:09:02] so how liberating is that
[1:09:06] Lord forgive my brother
[1:09:09] but Lord as I forgive my brother
[1:09:13] foreign
[1:09:14] don't forget me
[1:09:17] don't forget me I'm standing here Lord
[1:09:20] in need of something to move forward in
[1:09:22] my life
[1:09:23] I need you I can't do it but you can
[1:09:28] I want something to move me forward in
[1:09:32] my life I want something for you to move
[1:09:34] forward in
[1:09:36] don't let the weight of sin what did
[1:09:38] Paul tell us the way they're saying that
[1:09:39] what so easily
[1:09:41] besides us let us run with patience this
[1:09:46] race
[1:09:47] it's a lot easier to run without a 50
[1:09:49] pound pack on your back amen some of
[1:09:52] y'all has been in the military boy like
[1:09:54] rolandre said I mean he'd carry a pack
[1:09:56] and brother Donnie also and some of
[1:09:58] you've been in the military they put a
[1:09:59] 50-pound pack on you is it 50
[1:10:02] or more
[1:10:04] on your back well you've been in Sister
[1:10:06] Sister Mary bless your heart and and boy
[1:10:09] when that thing is lifted off of you you
[1:10:11] feel like you can run another 10 miles
[1:10:13] and and about that high off the ground
[1:10:14] why because that load's been lifted off
[1:10:17] of you
[1:10:19] let's start unloading
[1:10:21] remember I told you the quote the other
[1:10:23] day about the camel brother Ryan said we
[1:10:25] load that Camel down so much till he's
[1:10:26] bowlegged
[1:10:28] he said unload a Christian's supposed to
[1:10:32] unload listen we're the only ones that
[1:10:34] know how to unload
[1:10:36] this world that's why they're crazy
[1:10:39] they can't unload their burdens it just
[1:10:42] keeps piling on and piling on and they
[1:10:45] go over here to get help and that person
[1:10:47] needs help
[1:10:48] take they go to this position and find
[1:10:51] out math physician needs help he's
[1:10:54] seeing a psychiatrist your psychiatrist
[1:10:55] is seeing a guy psychiatrist you're in
[1:10:57] trouble
[1:11:01] it's like somebody being a divorce
[1:11:03] counselor and been married three or four
[1:11:04] times
[1:11:06] and I will put my spirit within you
[1:11:08] here's the key
[1:11:10] he's going to put him
[1:11:13] eternal life
[1:11:15] inside of you
[1:11:18] and listen and once he deposits it in
[1:11:21] there
[1:11:22] it can never come out
[1:11:26] he attaches I like what brother Ernie
[1:11:28] said we have attached ourselves to the
[1:11:31] eternal
[1:11:32] we were not Eternal to begin with
[1:11:35] our soul was dead
[1:11:38] but by regeneration and by us giving our
[1:11:41] heart to God and getting that load of
[1:11:42] sin out and having that thing cleaned
[1:11:44] that everything cleaned out of us we
[1:11:46] have asked the eternal
[1:11:49] to come inside something that's not
[1:11:51] eternal
[1:11:53] and not just not just anoint me Brother
[1:11:56] John
[1:11:58] but live in me
[1:12:00] live in me and I believe that's why
[1:12:02] brother around that's why one of the
[1:12:03] things he came to tell us that he said
[1:12:05] when your hand moved Got Hand moved
[1:12:07] when your foot moved God's foot moved
[1:12:10] that's how close it is
[1:12:12] it's not like Jesus is over there and
[1:12:14] he's controlling everything no he's
[1:12:15] inside controlling everything
[1:12:18] working from the inside out
[1:12:20] he's still working on me
[1:12:23] and I will put my spirit within you and
[1:12:26] cause you
[1:12:28] there's a Rudder cause you to walk in my
[1:12:31] statutes and you shall keep my judgments
[1:12:34] and do them now that was in the Old
[1:12:36] Testament according to Ezekiel but
[1:12:39] praise God that same my
[1:12:42] stood on the damn Pentecost and came
[1:12:44] into a group of Believers and didn't do
[1:12:47] away with the Old Testament but brought
[1:12:48] a new testament in
[1:12:51] brought Church ages and brought the
[1:12:53] Gentile age to where now we have a
[1:12:55] Homeland amen it's the baptism of the
[1:12:58] Holy Ghost our land is what you're
[1:13:00] walking in possess ye your soul
[1:13:06] praise God
[1:13:07] so justification therefore being
[1:13:09] justified by faith you got to believe
[1:13:11] just like I said you got to believe that
[1:13:12] your sins are gone
[1:13:13] John 3 16 for God so loved the world
[1:13:15] that he gave his only begotten son that
[1:13:17] whosoever believeth in him shall not
[1:13:19] perish but have everlasting life do you
[1:13:21] all know if you read your Bible John 3
[1:13:23] is where Jesus says You must be born
[1:13:25] again
[1:13:27] John 3 3 when he starts with Nicodemus
[1:13:29] he gets down to John 3 16 and he just
[1:13:32] lets her have it he says for God so
[1:13:34] loved this world
[1:13:35] until he gave his only begotten son that
[1:13:37] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:13:38] perish but have everlasting life now let
[1:13:41] me ask you a question
[1:13:42] brother Brown told us that Nicodemus and
[1:13:46] gamalia never became bride they but they
[1:13:50] will be given eternal life for their
[1:13:51] stand
[1:13:52] that's what it is right there
[1:13:57] they might already believed him as as so
[1:14:00] much as the savior but they believed on
[1:14:02] him and they should not perish and they
[1:14:05] were going to get everlasting life
[1:14:07] for taking their stand
[1:14:11] with the word of God as much as they can
[1:14:13] see that's why I said folks we can't we
[1:14:15] can't say it's me me foreign no more no
[1:14:19] there's a lot of people going to make it
[1:14:21] that you probably didn't think was going
[1:14:22] to make it
[1:14:24] and there's a lot of people's not going
[1:14:25] to make it because I'm going to read you
[1:14:26] if I ever get to it I'm gonna read you
[1:14:28] one where they come up to Jesus and say
[1:14:30] have I not cast out devils in your name
[1:14:32] have I not done Mighty works I just
[1:14:35] weren't a church pew sitter I preached
[1:14:39] he said depart from me I never knew you
[1:14:43] you never let me in your soul
[1:14:46] you let me in your spirit you let me
[1:14:50] anoint your flag
[1:14:52] fully inside your soul
[1:14:54] you never let me have an intimate
[1:14:56] relationship with you
[1:14:58] and boy wow
[1:15:02] he didn't believeth on him is not
[1:15:03] condemned but he that believeth not is
[1:15:05] condemned already because he hath not
[1:15:06] believed on the name of the only
[1:15:08] begotten
[1:15:09] Son of God so when no justification we
[1:15:11] come to water baptism sanctification now
[1:15:14] this is where he gives you a new heart
[1:15:15] and a lot of things happen in
[1:15:17] sanctification that really puts you
[1:15:20] toward uh brother Brown says you in
[1:15:23] other words your name is is put on a
[1:15:25] book
[1:15:26] all right
[1:15:27] then remember it's transferred because
[1:15:29] judas's name was on the book
[1:15:31] it was erased it was never transferred
[1:15:34] as we were talking about uh sister Anna
[1:15:36] had a question about Judas listen the
[1:15:39] only thing difference in Judas and us is
[1:15:41] one thing
[1:15:43] he didn't make it to Pentecost we know
[1:15:45] that but there's one thing God knew his
[1:15:48] heart
[1:15:51] God knew our heart
[1:15:54] and God knew the disciples heart
[1:15:56] so he made it available in that Upper
[1:15:59] Room
[1:16:00] for those people to go and receive the
[1:16:02] Holy Ghost and brother Brown said if if
[1:16:06] Judas would have made it to Pentecost
[1:16:09] he was already Justified and Sanctified
[1:16:11] by the Lord himself
[1:16:13] but he didn't go on because God knew his
[1:16:15] heart his heart wasn't heart was a
[1:16:17] deceiving heart
[1:16:20] it was deception that's what killed him
[1:16:24] right so anyway
[1:16:25] sanctification so he gives you a new
[1:16:27] heart he gives you a new way brother
[1:16:28] Brown says one day sometimes he said you
[1:16:31] were you become a part of a religious
[1:16:33] order boy you don't want to stay that
[1:16:36] people you want to be bride you don't
[1:16:38] want to be a religious order
[1:16:40] a religious order will put you in hell
[1:16:45] first Thessalonians says this is the
[1:16:47] will of God even your sanctification so
[1:16:50] God wants you to be saying listen he
[1:16:52] won't dwell in a what
[1:16:54] unclean vessel
[1:16:57] for this is the will of God even your
[1:16:58] sanctification that you should abstain
[1:17:00] from fornication that every one of you
[1:17:02] should know how to possess his vessel in
[1:17:05] sanctification and honor Matthew 12
[1:17:07] verse 43 says when the unclean Spirit
[1:17:09] has gone out of a man we've already
[1:17:11] talked about that that unclean Spirit
[1:17:13] wants to come back
[1:17:15] because he feels comfortable
[1:17:17] we want him to be the most uncomfortable
[1:17:20] thing
[1:17:21] in the world we you don't want him back
[1:17:24] listen if you'll take the washing of the
[1:17:26] word of the word though he won't come
[1:17:28] back
[1:17:29] Satan hates the word
[1:17:31] he hates it he hates the anointing that
[1:17:33] goes with the pure word of God now I'm
[1:17:35] not talking about all this other junk
[1:17:36] but he hates that he can't stand it he
[1:17:39] couldn't stand Jesus
[1:17:42] so when the unclean Spirit has gone out
[1:17:43] of a man he's walking through Dry places
[1:17:45] seeks wrath find none then he say I will
[1:17:47] come into my house see he's even got
[1:17:49] still control over you
[1:17:52] my house
[1:17:54] hmm from whence I came out and when he
[1:17:56] had come he finally said empty swept and
[1:17:59] garnished in other words cleaned up
[1:18:01] then he goes and takes seven more
[1:18:02] Spirits more wicked than himself and
[1:18:04] enters in and what dwells there
[1:18:08] and the last state of that man is worse
[1:18:10] than the first even so shall it be also
[1:18:13] unto this wicked generation John 17 17
[1:18:16] says Jesus praying he says sanctify them
[1:18:18] through thy truth
[1:18:20] Thy word is truth as thou has sent me
[1:18:23] into the world now watch as thou has
[1:18:25] sent me into the world
[1:18:27] even though I even also I have sent them
[1:18:29] into the world
[1:18:31] all right like I said many times before
[1:18:33] he he didn't pray that Lord you take
[1:18:35] them out of the world
[1:18:37] he's praying to cover them while they're
[1:18:39] in the world
[1:18:41] and for their sake I sanctify myself
[1:18:43] that they also might be Sanctified
[1:18:45] through the truth First Corinthians 6
[1:18:48] verse 9.
[1:18:52] do I need to read these again we ever
[1:18:54] won fit in every one of these search for
[1:18:56] some of you
[1:18:58] but you're washed yes amen amen but
[1:19:01] you're Sanctified you're justified in
[1:19:03] the name of the Lord Jesus and by the
[1:19:05] spirit
[1:19:06] of our God
[1:19:09] now let's start this ferment with the
[1:19:11] birth
[1:19:12] this is where he says I'll put my spirit
[1:19:20] I'm not going to say it that low again
[1:19:27] my spirit
[1:19:29] and I will put my spirit within you
[1:19:32] and cause you to walk in my statutes and
[1:19:34] you shall keep my judgments and do them
[1:19:36] Matthew 3 verse 11 this is Jesus
[1:19:39] speaking I indeed baptize you with water
[1:19:41] until repent on John speaking but
[1:19:44] they're reiterating what he's saying I
[1:19:47] indeed baptize you with water into
[1:19:48] repentance but he that cometh after me
[1:19:50] as mightier than I whose shoes I'm not
[1:19:53] worthy to Bear he shall baptize you with
[1:19:55] the Holy Ghost comma and with fire
[1:19:59] what happened on the day of Pentecost
[1:20:01] little Elixir fire now if we were able
[1:20:04] to follow that lick of fire because you
[1:20:06] only got so much commentary that you can
[1:20:08] write that was written by Luke right
[1:20:10] Luke wasn't there
[1:20:12] okay but there's licks of fire over
[1:20:15] every one of the people well what
[1:20:17] happened to those licks of fire they
[1:20:18] didn't just fly out the window
[1:20:20] they went right down in those people
[1:20:23] and stayed there and that burning fire
[1:20:26] stayed with them until they passed away
[1:20:31] hey you know you got the holy ghost that
[1:20:33] burning fire
[1:20:35] that you got when you were born again
[1:20:36] it's still supposed to be in there
[1:20:39] John 14 verse 26 but the comforter which
[1:20:42] is the Holy Ghost now here's Jesus
[1:20:44] identifying who he is and what he's
[1:20:47] sending
[1:20:48] and what he's going to do
[1:20:50] the comforter which is the Holy Ghost
[1:20:53] whom the father will send in my name
[1:20:55] he shall teach you all things now that's
[1:20:58] his job
[1:20:59] and bring all things to your remembrance
[1:21:01] whatsoever I have said
[1:21:03] unto you acts 1 verse 4 she's being
[1:21:06] assembled together with him commanded
[1:21:08] them that they should not depart from
[1:21:09] Jerusalem this is Jesus but wait for the
[1:21:12] promise of the Father which saith he you
[1:21:15] have heard of me for John truly baptized
[1:21:18] with water but you shall be baptized
[1:21:20] with the Holy Ghost not many days hence
[1:21:23] in other words 11 days from there they
[1:21:25] received the Holy Ghost when they
[1:21:27] therefore will come together they'd ask
[1:21:28] of me saying Lord with thou also at this
[1:21:31] time restore the kingdom to Israel they
[1:21:33] didn't even know what he's talking about
[1:21:34] and he said unto them it is not for you
[1:21:36] to know the time or Seasons which the
[1:21:38] father had put in his own power look but
[1:21:40] you shall receive power
[1:21:43] dunamis Dynamite power that's a word
[1:21:46] dunamis
[1:21:48] but you shall receive power
[1:21:51] after
[1:21:54] that the Holy Ghost has come upon you
[1:21:57] and you shall be witnessing unto me both
[1:21:59] in Jerusalem Judea Samaria the uttermost
[1:22:02] parts
[1:22:03] of the Earth
[1:22:05] let me ask you a question real quick
[1:22:07] everybody is an individual
[1:22:11] if somebody were to one-on-one let's
[1:22:14] just say
[1:22:16] somebody walked in off the street
[1:22:19] and he says and he or she says hey
[1:22:23] how'd you get what you got
[1:22:26] you say you got this Holy Ghost
[1:22:29] you say you've got the new birth
[1:22:32] how'd you get it
[1:22:35] could you take them in that room
[1:22:37] and explain to him
[1:22:40] your experience
[1:22:43] if you can't
[1:22:45] you haven't got that experience
[1:22:49] brother Brown said tell him how your
[1:22:51] fire got lit well guess what that's how
[1:22:53] my fire got lit that's my fire
[1:22:55] Holy Ghost and Fire yes
[1:22:58] Acts 2 verse 4 it says they were all
[1:23:01] filled
[1:23:03] with the Holy Ghost and began to speak
[1:23:04] with other tongues as the spirit gave
[1:23:06] him utterance
[1:23:07] Acts 19 verse 1 is here we go again
[1:23:09] about being in Paul he says have you
[1:23:11] received the Holy Ghost since you
[1:23:13] believe so see as and justification you
[1:23:16] believe
[1:23:17] you believe on the Lord Jesus Christ you
[1:23:20] believe that he took away your sin you
[1:23:22] believe they took your load off
[1:23:24] all right then you believed in this
[1:23:25] understand unto sanctification that he
[1:23:28] is cleaning you up because listen let me
[1:23:31] explain something to you that's been
[1:23:32] explained many times before you hear
[1:23:35] many people sometimes they say I know
[1:23:37] I'm born again because I quit smoking
[1:23:40] I know I'm born again because I quit
[1:23:41] drinking I don't lust I don't do this I
[1:23:43] don't do that
[1:23:45] that's not even got anything to do with
[1:23:46] the new birth
[1:23:48] nothing
[1:23:49] right
[1:23:53] no you can quit that and be just as
[1:23:56] black as set in your soul
[1:23:59] you can Will yourself to quit smoking
[1:24:03] right
[1:24:04] you can Will yourself to do a lot of
[1:24:06] things
[1:24:08] but when you know that the person that
[1:24:10] caused you to do them
[1:24:12] doesn't have a hold on you anymore
[1:24:15] that's when you know something's
[1:24:16] happened
[1:24:19] that's when you know that you that grip
[1:24:22] please people wake up for a second
[1:24:24] listen that grip that whatever that was
[1:24:26] had on you
[1:24:32] it's a grip and
[1:24:33] when you're trying to get away from and
[1:24:35] it's bringing you back
[1:24:37] you're trying to get away from lusting
[1:24:39] or drinking you're trying to get and
[1:24:40] it's going
[1:24:42] it's a grip it's got it's got gripped up
[1:24:46] you ever get the new birth that grip
[1:24:49] that grip will be gone
[1:24:52] that grip listen that grip will be gone
[1:24:55] if you get the unclean Spirit out of you
[1:24:58] but it's got a chance to come back
[1:25:02] so you can't say uh well listen what
[1:25:05] brother Ram said you know he said he
[1:25:07] said he said in a sermon he said you
[1:25:09] know smoking drinking cussing that's not
[1:25:11] saying
[1:25:12] remember that woman asked him afterwards
[1:25:14] come up to him afterwards and said pray
[1:25:16] tell brother Brian well I've been told
[1:25:18] since I was a kid that was Sam
[1:25:21] said no he's sins unbelief there's only
[1:25:23] one sin
[1:25:25] and while you're the reason you're doing
[1:25:27] all the XYZ is because you don't believe
[1:25:29] God's strong enough to take it away from
[1:25:30] you
[1:25:32] you don't believe you don't have enough
[1:25:34] faith
[1:25:36] that you want or might want can't take
[1:25:39] that away from you
[1:25:41] how about that
[1:25:43] are we good
[1:25:45] I want that grip to be gone Hey listen
[1:25:47] he's got enough grip on me in the spirit
[1:25:49] Realm
[1:25:50] listen he don't stop I didn't say it
[1:25:52] went away and it never came back
[1:25:54] I'm just telling you that thing that
[1:25:56] kept trying to pull you out
[1:25:59] it's not there anymore
[1:26:01] now he may try something else
[1:26:03] he's a good devil
[1:26:05] he's a good devil
[1:26:07] he's persistent
[1:26:09] but if you receive the Holy Ghost since
[1:26:11] you believed what you believe
[1:26:16] that's my question to you I'm not asking
[1:26:18] two thousand years ago I'm asking you
[1:26:19] now
[1:26:20] and they said unto him we have not so
[1:26:22] much as heard whether there be any Holy
[1:26:24] Ghost and he said unto them unto what
[1:26:27] were you baptized and they said John
[1:26:29] then Paul said John verily baptized with
[1:26:31] the baptism of repentance now watch he
[1:26:34] put John in his place
[1:26:36] John had a Ministry Paul was not denying
[1:26:39] that John had a Ministry he knew what
[1:26:40] that Ministry was but he placed it right
[1:26:43] here
[1:26:44] all right
[1:26:46] John barely baptized with the baptism of
[1:26:48] repentance saying unto the people that
[1:26:50] they should believe on him which should
[1:26:52] come after him
[1:26:54] that is Christ Jesus when they heard
[1:26:56] this they were baptized in the name of
[1:26:58] the Lord Jesus and when Paul laid hands
[1:27:00] on them the Holy Ghost Came Upon them
[1:27:02] and they speak with tongues and
[1:27:04] prophesied Romans 5 verse 5 says in Hope
[1:27:07] maketh not ashamed because the love of
[1:27:09] God is shed abroad in our hearts by what
[1:27:12] by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us
[1:27:17] Ephesians 4 verse 29 said let no corrupt
[1:27:20] communication proceed out of your mouth
[1:27:23] but that which is good to the use of
[1:27:25] edifying that it may Minister Grace
[1:27:28] unto the hearer
[1:27:30] and grieve not the holy spirit of God
[1:27:33] whereby you are sealed
[1:27:36] until the day of your Redemption
[1:27:38] let all bitterness and wrath and anger
[1:27:41] and clamor and evil speaking be put away
[1:27:43] from you
[1:27:44] with all malice be kind one to another
[1:27:47] tenderhearted forgiving one another even
[1:27:50] as God for Christ's sake forgive you
[1:27:55] First Corinthians 2 verse 12 says that
[1:27:57] we have received not the spirit of the
[1:27:58] world but the spirit which is of god
[1:27:59] that we might know the things that are
[1:28:02] freely given to us of God which things
[1:28:04] also we speak not in The Words which
[1:28:06] man's Wisdom teaches but which the Holy
[1:28:08] Ghost teaches look comparing spiritual
[1:28:10] things with spiritual that's what we've
[1:28:11] been trying to do today all right but
[1:28:13] the natural man receiveth not the things
[1:28:15] of the spirit of God for their
[1:28:16] foolishness unto him listen
[1:28:18] religion was foolish
[1:28:21] when I was in the world I didn't care it
[1:28:23] was foolish that people had to go to
[1:28:25] church and people who did this and
[1:28:26] people did that I come to find out they
[1:28:28] wanted to
[1:28:30] for they are foolishness unto him
[1:28:32] neither can he know them because they're
[1:28:35] spiritually discerned
[1:28:36] let's read this right here and then
[1:28:38] we'll close
[1:28:39] this is church order 1958. brother Brown
[1:28:42] says we believe in justification by
[1:28:45] faith Romans 5 verse 1. we believe that
[1:28:48] after a person
[1:28:50] by faith he
[1:28:52] is with the Lord Jesus Christ but it's
[1:28:54] possible that this same person could
[1:28:57] have habits such as drinking smoking and
[1:28:59] doing things that he should not do
[1:29:01] filthy habits of the flesh
[1:29:03] then we believe that the blood of Jesus
[1:29:05] Christ sanctifies this person for the
[1:29:08] service of the Lord
[1:29:10] and that we believe in sanctification
[1:29:12] according to Hebrews 13 12 and 13 where
[1:29:15] Jesus also that he might sanctify the
[1:29:18] people with his own blood suffered
[1:29:20] without the gate and we believe that
[1:29:22] sanctification is taught in the New
[1:29:25] Testament
[1:29:27] okay listen you couldn't get Sanctified
[1:29:30] in the Old Testament
[1:29:33] no you had that same dirty unclean
[1:29:36] spirit inside of you
[1:29:37] God was just so gracious to cover that
[1:29:39] until Christ died
[1:29:41] knowing your heart
[1:29:43] Swain you David's heart he knew David
[1:29:46] didn't want to sin but David didn't have
[1:29:47] something to take it away
[1:29:49] and we believe that sanctification is
[1:29:51] taught in the New Testament and meant
[1:29:54] for the Believers through the New
[1:29:56] Testament age which we're now living and
[1:29:59] we also believe that after the person
[1:30:01] has been Sanctified unclean habits has
[1:30:04] gone from that person
[1:30:06] and he's a Believer on the Lord Jesus
[1:30:09] Christ and his habits are gone now he's
[1:30:12] not born again yet though
[1:30:14] we believe that he is a candidate
[1:30:19] for the baptism of the Holy Spirit I
[1:30:21] can't
[1:30:27] and when the believer is just as many
[1:30:29] times as I've taught it like picking up
[1:30:31] a glass out of a chicken yard
[1:30:33] justification is picking the glass up
[1:30:35] there's a purpose
[1:30:37] in God's heart to use it that's what God
[1:30:39] does to a sinner he's still filthy
[1:30:42] then he is cleansed by the blood of
[1:30:44] Jesus Christ and the word sanctifies the
[1:30:46] compound word which means cleaned and
[1:30:48] set aside for service in the Old
[1:30:50] Testament the altar Sanctified The
[1:30:53] Vessel and it was set aside for service
[1:30:55] we believe that the holy spirit is
[1:30:57] putting that same vessel in service
[1:31:02] so the Holy Ghost is what is putting you
[1:31:04] in service it's making you a living
[1:31:07] breathing instrumentality or a temple of
[1:31:10] the Holy Ghost and then next Wednesday
[1:31:12] night we'll talk about anointings
[1:31:14] because after that
[1:31:15] we got if we're born again then then
[1:31:18] everything after that is a growth
[1:31:21] development all right let's stand our
[1:31:23] feet it's anointings it's things that we
[1:31:25] need like gifts of the Spirit like the
[1:31:28] nine spiritual gifts and all those
[1:31:29] different things we need those that is
[1:31:31] part of your Christian Journey but and
[1:31:33] it's given to you but you don't know how
[1:31:35] to use it everybody with me
[1:31:38] because Paul says Desiring the sensory
[1:31:40] milk of the word that what we may grow
[1:31:42] thereby know how to use those anointings
[1:31:45] because remember power without character
[1:31:48] it's satanic
[1:31:50] we need that anointing obviously we need
[1:31:53] it but it can anoint you
[1:31:56] and you'll be lost as lost can be
[1:32:00] but listen but Power with character
[1:32:04] virtues with the Holy Ghost
[1:32:08] God can use you
[1:32:11] he absolutely
[1:32:13] can use you
[1:32:15] listen
[1:32:17] we've been used by the devil long enough
[1:32:22] pray for me if it's not y'all
[1:32:25] we have been used by the devil long
[1:32:28] enough
[1:32:29] let's turn some of that effort over to
[1:32:31] let God use us
[1:32:33] open yourself up and say God
[1:32:36] Here I Am Lord
[1:32:39] send me
[1:32:42] that voice
[1:32:44] kept calling his name
[1:32:47] he just finally was Isaiah
[1:32:50] he said Here I Am Lord
[1:32:52] send me
[1:32:54] Jeremiah
[1:32:55] I Sanctified you
[1:32:58] before you come out of your mama
[1:33:00] because I know what you're going to do
[1:33:02] when you get here you're going to help
[1:33:03] me condemn this whole nation of Israel
[1:33:07] and you're going to help me call the
[1:33:08] people out
[1:33:10] so what's happening now
[1:33:12] the Lord Jesus knows there's a group of
[1:33:14] people
[1:33:15] that he's called out
[1:33:20] to call a people out
[1:33:23] to grow
[1:33:25] and get bigger
[1:33:27] learn more
[1:33:30] teach me Lord to wait you know why you
[1:33:32] need to be taught
[1:33:36] sing a song
[1:33:37] but the Holy Ghost is the most important
[1:33:39] thing you'll ever get in your life
[1:33:40] nothing else is the most important but
[1:33:42] that once you get that get up and walk
[1:33:45] with God
[1:33:46] let's sing a song God bless you
[1:33:50] born again
[1:33:53] [Music]
[1:34:01] born again and just like Jesus said
[1:34:08] [Music]
[1:34:16] the glory of the Lord amen
[1:34:20] about
[1:34:23] three years ago of redoing some Modern
[1:34:25] remodeling in the kitchen
[1:34:27] so I'm putting this
[1:34:30] kitchen cabinets up
[1:34:32] my brother wanted to do it for me
[1:34:36] and it's it I could see
[1:34:40] that when you do things whatever you
[1:34:42] need to do you need to be your
[1:34:44] Revelation at least to know what you're
[1:34:47] doing and know what's happening
[1:34:48] and that the cabinet I kept looking at
[1:34:51] Master these
[1:34:52] cabinets
[1:34:54] they're not stable they're gonna fall
[1:34:56] off the wall
[1:34:57] because they're all right they're all
[1:34:58] right just little
[1:35:00] just leave them there
[1:35:03] Thursday Friday
[1:35:05] I was in the kitchen fixing
[1:35:08] some cheese toast
[1:35:10] and I looked up
[1:35:12] in the cabinets about this far from my
[1:35:14] head
[1:35:15] and I was able to
[1:35:18] Push It Away by the power of God I'm not
[1:35:22] that fast it's not that strong right
[1:35:24] right but I was able to push in this
[1:35:27] only
[1:35:28] got scratches them all from here down to
[1:35:31] my wrist temporarily
[1:35:34] and it brushed my chin and the side of
[1:35:37] my head but it didn't skin this uh
[1:35:40] nothing that didn't right I wear a plate
[1:35:44] to knock it kind of loose but the thing
[1:35:47] about it is
[1:35:49] when you know
[1:35:51] what you know you got to live by
[1:35:54] and so when we come to church we come
[1:35:59] to work to live the rain to understand
[1:36:02] what is real and what is true if you
[1:36:05] don't get the revelation of what's real
[1:36:10] anything can happen to you that's right
[1:36:12] and I I realized that he want to redo my
[1:36:16] cabinets
[1:36:17] again
[1:36:19] I told him no I don't know what it cost
[1:36:22] to get them done but I want somebody to
[1:36:25] do it they know what they're doing yeah
[1:36:29] so we're coming to church and we're here
[1:36:34] preaching oh we want somebody to know
[1:36:37] what they're preaching that's right and
[1:36:40] if if if they're if they don't have a
[1:36:42] revelation they can't give you one
[1:36:44] that's right and he didn't know he
[1:36:47] didn't know he was doing the cabinets
[1:36:48] there was a bit off with me putting them
[1:36:51] up until he was sending the flow
[1:36:55] at least they wouldn't have crushed my
[1:36:57] head almost
[1:37:00] so I I just want to say
[1:37:03] I'm trying to follow the lord and that's
[1:37:06] the way I want things to be done
[1:37:08] everything according to God is real and
[1:37:12] just keep going
[1:37:14] and keep reading
[1:37:17] the Bible the prophet's message
[1:37:20] and so
[1:37:22] I I do I try to read a lot
[1:37:25] sometimes things get I get sleepy
[1:37:28] reading at home too
[1:37:30] but I go back and read it
[1:37:33] God's word is real and time
[1:37:38] as you look around us it's very short it
[1:37:42] just irriting the prophecy it would
[1:37:45] happen is taking place
[1:37:47] and so we just got to do that and that's
[1:37:51] all I just wanted to say I thank the
[1:37:53] Lord
[1:37:54] that everything came out all right yes
[1:37:57] and so
[1:37:58] just pray for me amen amen
[1:38:07] yeah I find me another cabinet maker
[1:38:10] somebody knew what is doing let's say
[1:38:14] born again
[1:38:16] [Music]
[1:38:24] born again
[1:38:27] just like Jesus said
[1:38:31] yes Lord amen
