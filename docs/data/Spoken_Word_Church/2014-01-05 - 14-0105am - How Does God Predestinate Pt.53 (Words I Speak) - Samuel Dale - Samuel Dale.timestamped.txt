[8:27] what you would have for this day and the
[8:28] hour for the message for this day CU
[8:31] truly we can recognize our day in this
[8:33] message and believe we've heard a
[8:35] message from God but now Lord that
[8:38] message must be quickened into our
[8:40] hearts for us to be able to have it as
[8:43] the revealed word Lord forgive our sins
[8:47] cover us and keep us and grant us Lord
[8:49] your grace and love and we commit it to

[9:03] travel and get back to us safely in your
[9:06] love we love you and we thank you in
[9:08] Jesus
[9:09] name
[9:13] amen something else I was going to
[9:15] announce and I
[9:16] can't if I don't write it down I don't
[9:19] uh you you know you got what do they say
[9:22] the the the shortest pencil is longer
[9:25] than the greatest memory uh ever what
[9:27] the word but just remember that U maybe
[9:30] I'll think of it in a minute and I'll
[9:32] but Romans 8 and John
[9:37] 6 think about what the word is saying
[9:40] now we're trying to you know we're
[9:42] trying to bring
[9:45] forth uh a thought to
[9:47] you and all of this now is background
[9:53] material I'll be St stating this for the
[9:56] next two or three services all that I'm
[9:58] doing doing is background
[10:01] material because if we don't have the
[10:04] background and then you just go say
[10:06] something then people wonder what you're
[10:09] saying you know and what the point
[10:11] you're trying to cover but this is the
[10:12] background material to help us to
[10:16] understand why the prophet would say
[10:19] that we come here with a seed in
[10:22] us right then we're trying to find out
[10:25] what that seed is and find out how it's
[10:28] in US amen that's simply that I can be
[10:31] and and I'm trying to cover it but
[10:33] trying to let you know where we're going
[10:35] and what we're doing Romans
[10:38] 8:28 and we know that all things work
[10:40] together for good to them that love God
[10:43] and to them who are called according to
[10:45] his purpose for whom he did Forno he
[10:48] also did predestinate to be conformed to
[10:51] the image of his son that he might be
[10:52] the first born among many Brethren
[10:55] moreover whom he did predestinate them
[10:57] he also called and whom he called
[10:59] them he also Justified and whom he
[11:01] justified them he also
[11:04] glorified what shall we then say to
[11:07] these things if God be for us who can be
[11:10] against
[11:12] usen John 6 we've been on this scripture
[11:16] for a couple of services verse
[11:20] 60 many therefore of his disciples when
[11:23] they heard
[11:24] this you know about the coming down from
[11:26] heaven in the manner of the different
[11:29] said this is a hard saying who can hear
[11:32] it when Jesus knew in himself that the
[11:35] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[11:38] the to them does this offend
[11:41] you now what then he asked them a
[11:43] question what if you shall see the son
[11:46] of man Ascend
[11:48] up where he was
[11:52] before it is the spirit that
[11:55] quickeneth the flesh profiteth
[11:57] nothing the words that I speak unto you
[12:01] they are spirit and they are life you
[12:05] may be seated to the Lord at is blessing
[12:08] to the reading of the
[12:10] word I'm going to try in this year if I
[12:15] can that was one thing I was going to
[12:17] say to uh quote a
[12:19] lot instead of maybe having to read so
[12:22] much but to quote you know as much as I
[12:26] can to help you and
[12:29] some of them said the other day that the
[12:31] last message I preached it woke
[12:33] everybody up for me to walk down the
[12:34] aisle so I may be walking up and down
[12:37] the AIS you know I'll go sit down in the
[12:39] back and preach you know I can run up
[12:42] here every once in a while read my notes
[12:44] but you know all
[12:47] right but now what have we been trying
[12:49] to cover now think
[12:51] about the words that we just
[12:54] read amen Jesus said and I know know now
[12:59] there are arguments about that there's a
[13:01] Rema and a Loos and one was Jesus
[13:04] speaking and the other one was God
[13:06] speaking and and I understand that you
[13:10] know but remember Jesus said my words
[13:15] they are spirit and their
[13:18] life now we'll get back to that in a
[13:21] minute because there is no man in the
[13:24] world could make that
[13:27] statement you can't do
[13:31] it our words are not spirit and
[13:35] life they can become right spirit and
[13:40] life but he did not say my words can
[13:45] become he said my words
[13:48] are all right now that's a drastic
[13:50] statement made and only could be made by
[13:53] God
[13:54] alone so you say but brother Dale I've
[13:57] spoke the word with amen that's fine
[14:00] that's good but just
[14:03] remember you had to get
[14:06] it before you can speak it amen now he
[14:09] didn't say he got
[14:13] it no I know the scriptures you know the
[14:16] father speaking I know all about that
[14:18] but I'm just making a point to you that
[14:21] is very interesting to
[14:23] me that a man could stand here on Earth
[14:27] and say that
[14:29] and it could only be the man Christ
[14:33] Jesus you don't hear brother brandham
[14:35] saying my words are Spirit in
[14:37] life well if we were going to go with
[14:39] anybody could say it we would try to go
[14:41] that way wouldn't but just remember
[14:44] everything we have we must receive
[14:48] that's
[14:48] right all right now that'll keep your
[14:51] mind in the thought of what we're
[14:52] talking
[14:55] about but we've been speaking about the
[14:59] that what is the seed of
[15:02] God and we say well it's the word of
[15:05] God all right that's that's wonderful
[15:08] that's a good
[15:09] thought but
[15:11] remember Paul said the
[15:15] letter would that be the word you know
[15:18] the
[15:18] written the letter
[15:22] kth but the spirit giveth life all right
[15:27] now what is the seed of
[15:31] God then it would be the alive word
[15:35] amen I mean the prophet even said it he
[15:38] said as long as it's laying on these
[15:41] Pages it can be
[15:44] questioned but he said once it's
[15:46] revealed made known to you and I he said
[15:48] you can't question it anymore amen all
[15:51] right now
[15:54] then being that way then the alive word
[15:59] word the Quicken word the revealed word
[16:02] whatever thought you want to
[16:05] use would be the seat of
[16:09] God all
[16:13] right and Jesus now no well let me cover
[16:16] it this way see when Mary as we were
[16:19] trying to cover the other
[16:23] day the angel of the Lord said to
[16:27] Mary you know so and so and so and so
[16:29] and happen Holy Ghost would overshadow
[16:32] you and
[16:33] Etc now what she said be it unto me
[16:36] according to Thy
[16:38] word all right but we'll get back to it
[16:41] more later in understanding more this
[16:44] afternoon or later oh there is what I
[16:46] was going to announce okay I knew it'd
[16:49] come back by the weather conditions and
[16:51] Etc this afternoon we will start at 2:00
[16:55] by 2:15 I want to be in the pull pit and
[16:58] that way we can at least cut 15 minutes
[17:00] off and we can run through and I'll try
[17:02] to be in a hurry uh as much as I can to
[17:05] get us out of here it's not weather's
[17:07] not supposed to be bad until way later
[17:10] it's supposed to be in the 40s and that
[17:12] would be fine but we won't take no
[17:15] chances I'll try to cut short this
[17:16] afternoon even if I got to preach half
[17:19] the message the other half wins that
[17:21] doesn't bother
[17:22] me but Mary when she said be it unto me
[17:26] according to Thy Word
[17:30] all right see that angel that delivered
[17:34] it even though that was
[17:35] Gabriel he could not plant that seed
[17:39] into her
[17:40] wound you know
[17:42] physically all he could do was speak to
[17:45] the outwards parts of her through her
[17:50] intelligence and dropping down I believe
[17:53] into her soul
[17:57] being and then that way she could speak
[18:01] back and say be it unto me according to
[18:03] Thy word but see then the Holy Spirit
[18:06] had to come upon
[18:08] her and overshadow her and God had to
[18:12] create but the angel couldn't do it
[18:15] that's right an angel cannot you know
[18:18] now we're talking about Heavenly
[18:20] angelics we're not talking about Earthly
[18:22] with the word Angel we're talking about
[18:25] Angelic beings they cannot bring
[18:31] the angel of the Lord spoke to ananas
[18:34] and told him to go down and and open
[18:36] Paul's
[18:38] eyes but the angel didn't go open Paul's
[18:42] eyes it had to be Anan which his name
[18:45] there he had to go pray for Paul all
[18:48] right we'll get back to that is to see
[18:51] and
[18:53] understand
[18:55] but what is the seed of God God you say
[18:59] well it's just a
[19:00] word all right now a letter of the
[19:08] word until that is made
[19:11] alive it is a word just like any other
[19:17] book that you read as far as letters off
[19:21] the page that's right all right now
[19:24] we'll read it after we get time brother
[19:26] he said I've read the Bible many times
[19:29] and he said every time I read it
[19:31] something appears andu you know all
[19:34] right off of it all right now but think
[19:37] about
[19:39] it and my point
[19:42] is what is a
[19:46] seed and why would Jesus
[19:49] say the words that I speak unto
[19:54] you our spirit and their life amen all
[20:00] right what is a
[20:02] seed all right we we take a grain of
[20:05] corn I've tried to explain that and I
[20:07] want to make sure you understand it we
[20:10] take a grain of corn and we hold it up
[20:12] you know and we say we have and see in
[20:14] our terminologies we use it as the word
[20:17] seed but it's really a grain because you
[20:21] can't see the seed of the
[20:24] Corn you can see the hull the things
[20:29] but especially corn does it all seeds do
[20:31] it but you can see it better in corn go
[20:33] out there this year if you ever noticed
[20:35] the the crows love to go along when the
[20:37] corn gets about that high and they pull
[20:40] that
[20:41] up because they know down on the bottom
[20:44] end to
[20:45] that is that grain of corn as we call it
[20:50] it's still hooked on and until it grows
[20:53] out of it it's still there so just pull
[20:56] one up and look at it and you'll see
[20:57] what I'm talking about about the the
[20:59] outside is the hull
[21:02] part all right now we say we've got a a
[21:07] seed now remember the seed is in the
[21:10] corn in the inside of that grain H you
[21:13] you can crush the grain you know the the
[21:16] outside
[21:18] hole but the seed is really the
[21:22] germ I'll get more on that the Lord
[21:24] willing this
[21:26] afternoon but really the the the seed of
[21:29] God is the
[21:32] germ because it has to have as Jesus
[21:35] said when he said my words if he said my
[21:37] words are just like anybody else's
[21:39] words that that would have been you know
[21:42] have been left but he didn't say that he
[21:44] said my words they are spirit and
[21:48] they're alive in other words they're
[21:51] alive amen he was God see it wasn't
[21:54] somebody else now wait till we get to
[21:56] the prophets with that
[21:59] way do we get down to the real message
[22:02] that we're going to you know when those
[22:05] prophets would receive from
[22:07] God and then speak out they didn't go
[22:10] speak their own
[22:12] thoughts see because their words were
[22:14] not spirit and
[22:19] life their words were alive to them
[22:23] right they were alive to
[22:26] God but they were not alive to anybody
[22:31] else that's why it's got to be
[22:34] sown to understand and the only question
[22:38] I've ever asked of people to try to get
[22:40] an understanding of everybody saying you
[22:42] were born with this seed in you it's got
[22:44] this it's a word it's this that and the
[22:45] other all right I believe all the quotes
[22:48] the prophet said but I asked a simple
[22:51] question the new birth is it the birth
[22:53] of the words you hear after you come
[22:55] into the world or is it the birth of the
[22:58] words you claim you got when you come
[22:59] into the
[23:01] world you know which one is
[23:06] birth
[23:07] right and see then that runs into a lot
[23:11] of
[23:13] thoughts and you know if if it's just
[23:16] quickening of the words you already have
[23:19] you don't need anything that's
[23:21] right that's the old two Soul Doctrine
[23:25] and people don't believe it but all
[23:28] right that's up to
[23:30] them but you see we look at a grain of
[23:33] corn as they say we say I got a seed of
[23:36] corn or beans potatoes whatever you
[23:40] know all right if that seed has not been
[23:46] gerti it is no
[23:49] good all right now planting it don't
[23:52] germatize
[23:53] it
[23:55] right it's got to be germatize because
[23:58] you remember you can make a grain of
[23:59] corn look exactly everything perfectly
[24:01] the same the only difference it doesn't
[24:03] have the life it doesn't have the German
[24:06] tized part within it that can make it
[24:09] all right now that's why that when we'll
[24:12] get to it eventually but I'm trying to
[24:14] lay down some thoughts see if I preach
[24:16] my ideas about the word then I'm not
[24:20] showing the seed of God I'm showing my
[24:24] ideas that's
[24:25] right all right
[24:28] and that's why the prophet is I was
[24:30] covering the other day says don't teach
[24:32] the
[24:32] word he said preach the word now was he
[24:36] doing away with teachers when brother
[24:37] brownon spent half of his message saying
[24:40] I'm
[24:41] teaching no he's just saying don't just
[24:45] try
[24:45] to beat on the
[24:49] letter preach by Revelation what God has
[24:53] given to
[24:55] you right and then see then Noah
[25:00] wouldn't preach Moses's
[25:02] message right amen see we we incorporate
[25:08] all of it but we don't preach Luther's
[25:09] message but we incorporate what he said
[25:12] but we we we don't preach it like that
[25:15] we we go on Beyond but yet we
[25:17] incorporate that into what we're saying
[25:20] of Wesley Pentecost Etc and all but to
[25:24] look at at what is a
[25:26] seed all right then God's
[25:30] word must be made
[25:34] alive
[25:36] right right right and no matter the
[25:39] greatest of all I believe the prophet in
[25:42] our day was the greatest of all don't
[25:43] you you know to be able to bring us the
[25:45] word that's right but yet he could not
[25:49] reveal the word that's right he could
[25:51] only speak what God had given him to
[25:55] say all right
[25:59] now in doing it then it
[26:03] takes before you can call it a
[26:06] seed it takes the
[26:10] Egg The Germ like in a chicken whatever
[26:14] you
[26:15] know and you call that deceit all right
[26:20] now I got it written down in here
[26:22] somewhere what Webster say and what I
[26:25] think it's in the evening message but uh
[26:29] the word seed in the Scofield means
[26:34] Offspring the word seed means Offspring
[26:38] it means
[26:39] descendant it means
[26:43] children that's the definition word
[26:45] Webster
[26:47] says it's the germ
[26:50] of a prop Pro p o p r o p uh o g a a t i
[26:59] v
[27:00] e in other words
[27:02] reproduction right source of
[27:06] anything all right it means sperm or
[27:10] Sean the word seed so seed has got a lot
[27:16] of you know meaning in the points of
[27:18] what we're looking at but when it comes
[27:21] back to the
[27:23] word
[27:24] see then are we showing seed
[27:28] and that's F that's word in come
[27:31] on are we really trying to
[27:34] seow The Germ of the
[27:37] word because you can seow the seed of
[27:40] the
[27:41] word and it only be
[27:45] letter that's right but if you s The
[27:47] Germ of the word it means you have it
[27:50] alive
[27:51] first and remember you got to have it
[27:54] before you can speak it when I first
[27:56] come into the message everybody wanted
[27:58] to speak the word speak the word one day
[28:00] I'll speak it you know I said well the
[28:03] only thing that I've understand about it
[28:05] is you you got to have it before you can
[28:08] speak it that's just you know I'm sorry
[28:11] that's my way of looking at it I know
[28:14] I'm not very uh nicely about the way I
[28:17] say things but I I I try to say them as
[28:20] best as I can you know without it being
[28:24] uh horrible but yet still trying to say
[28:27] what I
[28:29] believe a preacher gets up and he
[28:32] preaches and brother Brown said you can
[28:34] preach a denominational
[28:36] seat come on run it the message he said
[28:39] you can preach organizational
[28:41] seat Well it evidently is organizational
[28:44] word it's organizational thoughts you
[28:47] know
[28:48] right that can be done and it still have
[28:51] nothing to do and not be the word of
[28:53] God but see it takes a union to make a
[28:57] SE
[28:58] amen all
[29:01] right the grain of corn must be put in
[29:05] the
[29:06] ground and here's what you don't get
[29:10] people to talk about
[29:11] much you put it in the ground and
[29:13] brother around said you go back out the
[29:15] next day you dig it up and
[29:17] see okay you put it back in the ground
[29:19] you dig it back
[29:22] up he said that grain of
[29:26] corn means
[29:28] whatever has got to
[29:34] rotten and he said you can't take a
[29:36] microscope and find the germ of
[29:40] life he said but throughout the things
[29:43] and like flowers he said will lay there
[29:46] through the
[29:48] winter and it'll come back up in the
[29:52] spring well because it's got the germ of
[29:55] Life all right so now if the word is the
[29:59] same way of talking about a seed and
[30:02] things then you see why that the word
[30:05] must be
[30:09] sown and you say but but brother Dale I
[30:12] got it without anybody telling me
[30:14] where'd you get it right well I got it
[30:17] outspoken word book somebody wrote the
[30:21] book besides brother Brandon was the one
[30:23] that spoke it that's well I I just got
[30:26] mine right out of the Bible Well
[30:29] somebody wrote
[30:35] it oh my I know that's hateful to people
[30:39] they don't like for you be that blunt CU
[30:41] it doesn't leave you playing room you
[30:43] know everybody wants to well this this
[30:46] this is the way I think it is I don't
[30:49] care what you
[30:50] think I care what God
[30:53] thinks right now then think about it
[31:01] it takes a
[31:03] union to make a
[31:07] seed just like it takes the egg from the
[31:10] woman The Germ from the man is put
[31:14] together
[31:16] reproduces either one of them by itself
[31:19] won't
[31:20] reproduce right because it takes the two
[31:24] together to come out with a seed which
[31:26] is
[31:28] Offspring or reproduction all right but
[31:33] we're dealing with the word we're not
[31:34] dealing with um you know the other
[31:38] things but I like what the prophet has
[31:40] to say so let's just
[31:42] read I've read you this before but let's
[31:44] go over this go ahead with number one
[31:48] it's a message called
[31:50] Oneness
[31:52] 1962
[31:54] to11 paragraph 89 and 90 and listen what
[31:57] happened I said all right I want to ask
[31:59] you the qu ask you something the woman
[32:01] has no egg she has no seed he said now
[32:06] he said not an egg he said thy
[32:11] seed he says to the woman not an
[32:15] egg all right he said thy seed right
[32:20] he's talking about Genesis what 3:15 and
[32:24] to thy seed all right so what
[32:28] she had to be given a
[32:32] seed all right now what was she
[32:35] given when she
[32:37] said Mary right remember Eve baced it
[32:41] messed it all up when Mary said be it
[32:44] unto me according to Thy
[32:46] word she accepted what was said by the
[32:53] angel and it become a germ in her
[32:57] thinking as we'll say it that
[33:01] way do you know that brother R said she
[33:04] received that
[33:06] seed from her mother
[33:09] an be glad to show you
[33:13] that and this is another thing wife and
[33:15] I were listening the other day and where
[33:16] he said
[33:18] it he said when that angel begin to
[33:20] speak to
[33:21] Mary he said it already had been she had
[33:25] other words paraphrasing she had studied
[33:27] the word she knew Isaiah of what it had
[33:31] said and said when that angel said you
[33:34] know the Holy Ghost had overshadowed the
[33:37] and these things said her mind went
[33:39] straight back to the
[33:42] scripture of the Virgin shall
[33:49] conceive it the angel didn't come and
[33:51] bring her a great big
[33:54] sermon God had prepared her that's right
[33:57] right for this
[34:00] event and she had received from her
[34:04] mother the
[34:06] seed you know of understanding I quoted
[34:11] that to a man one time and he let me
[34:13] have it good he said I'm tired of this
[34:15] old mother
[34:17] doctrine of the woman bringing the seed
[34:20] I said well I didn't say it you going to
[34:24] have to fuss with brother
[34:25] brandom CU he said she received it from
[34:28] her
[34:30] mother but brother R said as quick as it
[34:33] was said her mind went back into
[34:36] scripture see a germ begins to develop
[34:39] in with
[34:40] her something that could be made
[34:44] alive so she said be it unto
[34:47] me in other words if that is Isaiah
[34:51] 9:6 whatever what the scripture there is
[34:53] right then let me just you myself and
[34:58] whatever you
[34:59] do you bring it forth
[35:02] amen the angel couldn't do it as I said
[35:05] while
[35:07] ago but he said the Holy Ghost will
[35:09] overshadow
[35:10] thee now when he came to her she already
[35:15] had a
[35:16] thought a
[35:21] jourm then he quickened that Isaiah
[35:25] 9:6
[35:27] right he made it alive that she was the
[35:30] one doing
[35:32] that and see that's what we got to
[35:36] do as I said how many times Martin
[35:38] Luther might have preached sermons or
[35:42] discourse of messages or great things on
[35:44] the just you live by
[35:47] faith but one day he read it and
[35:50] God he already had the jourm part laying
[35:53] there of the
[35:55] thoughts but but yet God had to make it
[35:58] alive that's right all right now Mary
[36:02] never
[36:03] produced if you're listening to me don't
[36:06] get
[36:08] confused The Germ was in Mary
[36:13] stinking she never produced an
[36:17] egg God created both because what now
[36:22] all right what are we talking
[36:23] about egg sperm make a seed that's right
[36:29] eggs not a seed sperms not a
[36:33] seed you got to put them together and
[36:36] makes a seed that's that's what happened
[36:39] to
[36:40] Mary when she said be it unto me
[36:42] according to Thy word God created egg
[36:46] and sperm germ whatever you want to call
[36:49] it into her physical
[36:52] wound all right and it become a seed the
[36:55] seed of the woman
[36:57] that's what he's explaining see and to
[37:00] thy seed and she had no
[37:02] seed so he gave her a seed right now
[37:05] what he's explaining it takes a union to
[37:08] make a seed is that right doctor he's
[37:11] talking to somebody there has to be if
[37:14] you got a whole lot of pup out here
[37:16] didn't have no life in it planted it out
[37:18] here it won't never come up lay there
[37:22] and
[37:22] right you couldn't plant the life
[37:25] without having the pup so you see the
[37:28] whole thing is a
[37:31] union I'm just trying to tell you about
[37:34] Christ in the church it's a union all
[37:37] right now what is
[37:40] it cuz it takes two to make a seed he
[37:43] goes on to
[37:47] say now are you listening there I've got
[37:51] a seed of corn brother Dale now you got
[37:53] a
[37:55] grain
[37:57] you can't
[37:58] prove that it's a
[38:01] seed you know what I mean te it apart do
[38:03] what you want to dissect it you can't
[38:05] prove
[38:07] it they make one looks just like it they
[38:10] tear it apart looks just like yours
[38:13] because you can't find the germ of
[38:17] life
[38:18] right The Germ of life is in that grain
[38:22] that's right but that germ of
[38:25] life
[38:28] has got to go through a
[38:29] process right before it becomes a seed
[38:33] that's simply what I'm talking about
[38:36] people saying well you know I come here
[38:37] with this I come here with that what did
[38:40] you come here
[38:42] with where's it at you
[38:45] know all right think about
[38:49] it but I'm still trying to drive a point
[38:52] go ahead to the next one number
[38:55] two I'm still still trying to drive a
[38:57] point to you and
[38:59] I my wife says I need to explain a lot
[39:01] of things so I'll try the best I can I
[39:05] may preach 20 sermons off of one message
[39:07] but I'll try to explain
[39:10] it all
[39:12] right talking about the
[39:20] word there
[39:22] was a large Congregation of
[39:25] people that heard
[39:28] Jesus you
[39:32] agree oh many witnessed signs and
[39:40] wonders but yet what he said to
[39:44] them even though they would
[39:47] say now we know that thou H has the
[39:51] words of
[39:55] life but remember Nicodemus
[39:59] said we
[40:03] know that God has to be with you cuz no
[40:06] man can do what you're
[40:09] doing see they heard the son of man so
[40:13] deceived right is that The Parables
[40:16] right you remember the other day the
[40:18] parable one of them says that and they
[40:20] sprang up but the cares of
[40:25] life now if you're meaning anything in
[40:27] sense when they sprang up it meant
[40:30] something was made alive
[40:34] right so would it be possible to start
[40:36] out with something of the word and it be
[40:39] taken from
[40:43] you I will remind
[40:46] you
[40:49] that it was not the spirit taken away in
[40:51] the ages it was the
[40:54] word that's right now don't think it
[40:58] can't be taken from you and don't take
[41:00] it and try to put things on to it that's
[41:02] right take what it says no matter what
[41:05] you understand when God speaks to our
[41:09] hearts come on are you with me with this
[41:12] when God speaks to you the first thing
[41:14] he said is almost as bad as Isaiah 9:6
[41:17] right you know what I mean by that
[41:20] brother around and said he thought who
[41:22] in the what in the world am I saying
[41:25] that a virgin shall con
[41:26] receive he said that's
[41:29] impossible when God speaks something to
[41:32] you the first reaction is what that
[41:35] can't
[41:36] be or I don't understand how that can
[41:39] be all right then you hold on to
[41:42] that and God can develop it in you all
[41:48] right but look what he
[41:51] says the word itself is
[41:55] Spirit
[41:58] now to me this is the only way that we
[41:59] can understand how Jesus said my words
[42:02] are Spirit in their
[42:04] life maybe you understand maybe it's
[42:07] it's all
[42:09] right but see he didn't say my words
[42:12] maybe or someday will
[42:14] be when he spoke it it was
[42:18] alive it may have been a prophecy of
[42:21] thousands of
[42:22] years but to him it was
[42:25] alive when nonon saw chariots jostling
[42:28] in the streets running like Lightnings
[42:31] you know
[42:32] light to
[42:34] him he saw Buick and old mobiles and
[42:37] Cadillacs running to each other in on
[42:39] the highway with lights
[42:41] on he didn't know how to explain it no
[42:43] but that's what he
[42:46] saw all right cuz it was
[42:53] alive now when we get back to the this
[42:56] remember a
[42:59] point Moses got the thought from
[43:02] God it was Moses's thought right and
[43:07] then he spoke it and it become word
[43:12] right but what about the writing of the
[43:14] five
[43:20] books very
[43:24] close he had to get to thought and he
[43:26] wrote it but he didn't speak
[43:29] it he wrote
[43:35] it follow the wording now the word
[43:39] itself is
[43:41] spirit it's spirit in word
[43:45] form now if it's spirit it's alive
[43:49] right are you with me yes if it's spirit
[43:52] it's
[43:53] alive okay now
[43:58] it's spirit in word
[44:00] form it's brought down from this being
[44:05] Spirit downward toward word word and
[44:08] what is
[44:09] it uh it's not in this one there one
[44:12] next or two oh okay we'll get it right
[44:15] here and this is God's
[44:18] thought that he has placed in the
[44:23] word you can't add two or t away right
[44:26] that's right that's right all
[44:29] right well
[44:31] watch the word itself is spirit it's
[44:34] spirit and word form and then you see
[44:38] when it's quickened or brought to life
[44:40] the spirit of the word goes to work and
[44:43] acts because that now look a thought has
[44:47] to be a thought before it can be a word
[44:49] and then when a thought is presented it
[44:52] is a
[44:53] word now we'll get to some in a minute
[44:55] where where he covers what John
[44:58] 1:1 remember John 1:1 it says in the
[45:01] beginning was the word the word was with
[45:02] God and brother Brandon places that
[45:04] beginning in Genesis
[45:09] 1 because that's where you hear God
[45:11] begins to
[45:12] speak
[45:14] right he places John 1 in Genesis 1 as
[45:20] he begins to
[45:22] speak now think about
[45:24] it
[45:26] this is God's thought that he has placed
[45:28] in the word and when we receive it from
[45:32] him it becomes a word
[45:35] right well know was word all the time
[45:38] word was always
[45:40] word
[45:42] now I I need to go back and preach on
[45:44] the godhead for about another sermon
[45:46] right to reminds
[45:49] you that it was first God's
[45:54] thought he DW D alone with his
[45:58] thoughts and then he began to
[46:04] speak it becomes a
[46:07] word you said well brother Dale I don't
[46:10] understand how that could ever be that
[46:11] it wasn't a wasn't a word all the time
[46:15] that you're trying to figure it out
[46:17] instead of taking what the prophet says
[46:20] that God dwelt Alone with his
[46:23] thoughts he said he condescended down
[46:25] word that you and I could comprehend him
[46:28] right and said he spoke it it become the
[46:31] logos the
[46:33] speech the
[46:36] word all
[46:38] right
[46:40] now but then he started
[46:42] creating when we receive it see God
[46:45] revealed to Moses what to do Moses spoke
[46:48] it and it
[46:50] happened but he had to first get it as a
[46:54] thought that's right
[46:56] and so Moses got the word come down the
[46:59] correct
[47:00] way well there just too much technology
[47:03] into that too much uh too much old
[47:06] letter of the
[47:08] word
[47:11] well I'm sorry that's just the way I
[47:14] am because I didn't get where I'm
[47:19] at just by flying by
[47:22] night I got there by studying what the
[47:25] prophet has said
[47:26] what the Bible has
[47:28] said all
[47:30] right now think about
[47:33] it this is God's
[47:36] thought that he's placed in the
[47:39] word
[47:41] right it's still a thought till it comes
[47:44] to you right I don't care if the prophet
[47:46] explained it I don't care if I got it
[47:48] wrote on the side of the page thank you
[47:50] of what he
[47:52] said and come on it's St right but when
[47:56] that's revealed to
[47:58] me amen it must come to me
[48:02] first as a
[48:04] thought oh now you're trying to no it
[48:08] comes to everybody that
[48:12] way the prophet's message must be a
[48:14] thought to you and I right then it can
[48:17] be revealed what he's saying
[48:19] amen all right see then we can come to
[48:22] the right
[48:24] place look what he explains the next one
[48:27] I know I won't get through with this
[48:28] message this morning so we'll finish it
[48:30] this evening look at the next one number
[48:33] three take from spoken words Original
[48:35] Seed 1962 318 paragraph
[48:39] 161 and all of God's Sons must be the
[48:44] same amen now go read back or forth what
[48:48] yes sir to be
[48:50] born of the word and
[48:54] spirit right now now what is to be born
[48:56] to the word and the spirit you hear the
[48:59] word and it's made alive right right is
[49:03] that the new birth born of the word and
[49:06] the
[49:09] spirit Paul says in what at Romans 6 or
[49:12] 8 that you believe in your heart and you
[49:16] confess with your
[49:17] mouth all right now to be born of the
[49:21] word and spirit
[49:24] look bring us back to the spoken word
[49:30] again you remember I asked you to listen
[49:32] to that message over and
[49:34] over the spoken word is the original
[49:37] seat he didn't say the letter of the
[49:39] word the original seat come on he spent
[49:43] four hours preaching on the spoken word
[49:48] is the original seat it's got to be
[49:52] spoke by
[49:54] somebody or we don't get
[49:58] it but I I need all I got to it was
[50:00] spoke by somebody in the
[50:07] Bible but think about
[50:10] it bring us back to the spoken word
[50:13] again what like in John
[50:20] 3 John
[50:23] 3 what is John
[50:27] three in my house there many mansions if
[50:29] it were not so I would have told you and
[50:32] go to prepare a place for you if I go to
[50:33] prepare a place for you I'll receive you
[50:35] under myself that where I am there you
[50:36] may be
[50:39] also he said back brings us back to the
[50:42] spoken word again like in John
[50:47] 3 see to be born to the water and spirit
[50:51] what does it do it brings you right back
[50:53] again unto the place
[50:55] of where you should have been at the
[51:01] beginning brother tale do you mean the
[51:04] new
[51:07] birth is that what he's
[51:09] explaining about being born
[51:13] again to be born again in your
[51:17] soul not your body your spirit now
[51:20] because the birth not there in your soul
[51:23] by the new birth if you have eternal
[51:24] life you back like it should have been
[51:27] had it been no
[51:31] fault that's why to me when Brother
[51:33] randam begin to talk like that I said I
[51:35] don't have the Holy Ghost he's talking
[51:39] about but see everybody said oh I come
[51:41] in the message I know I got the Holy
[51:42] Ghost got to come in the message I was
[51:44] the message two years before I
[51:47] received and I'll read to you this
[51:49] evening why I get down to it where
[51:51] brother brownon said them demons he said
[51:54] I should have been saved when I was
[51:56] about 12 years old he said but them
[51:58] demons kept me from being
[52:00] saved well you know my point is them
[52:03] demons and them preachers is what keeps
[52:05] most people from being saved
[52:10] right why because they bring you false
[52:12] hopes all
[52:14] right see if you're born by the word and
[52:17] spirit the new birth your soul is
[52:23] backward it would have been had been no
[52:25] fault that's right like in the beginning
[52:29] it brings you right back again to the
[52:31] place where you should have been at the
[52:32] beginning see that's the reason of
[52:34] Christ death brings us right back again
[52:37] to we're sons of
[52:40] God brings us right
[52:43] back to sons of
[52:47] God sons of God that can understand the
[52:51] word all
[52:54] right
[52:57] now think about
[53:02] it think about what Jesus was
[53:09] saying think about what the prophet just
[53:11] now
[53:13] said if you're born to the word and
[53:15] spirit word must be swn into your heart
[53:18] Spirit must Quicken that word right
[53:21] there's never been nobody saved in the
[53:23] Bible that didn't hear the word first I
[53:25] want that somebody to show me that so if
[53:29] it if you come here with it why did
[53:30] somebody have to show it of course you
[53:33] know what they're saying
[53:34] now I knew they was going to get smart
[53:36] enough one of these
[53:39] days I say that
[53:44] sarcastically I knew they going to come
[53:46] up with the idea one of these days cuz
[53:48] you got to have an answer what are they
[53:50] saying the new birth is now do you know
[53:51] what they're saying it
[53:54] is
[53:56] that God just come down done everything
[53:58] he done and all it was to do was brother
[54:00] col to let you know you always was
[54:07] eternal the new birth is just you got a
[54:09] knowledge you always was
[54:11] eternal I knew they was going to come up
[54:13] with that I said that 40 years ago that
[54:16] that's what they'd come up with and say
[54:17] it and that's what's what they're saying
[54:20] other words the whole message the whole
[54:22] Bible everything is to just to get you
[54:25] to realize you always
[54:30] was short tore Nicodemus out of the
[54:32] frame didn't
[54:35] it Nicodemus said you're a man sent from
[54:40] God we know it we've listened to
[54:44] you we've seen the Miracles
[54:48] yes why didn't Jesus turn around
[54:50] Nicodemus you always
[54:54] was
[54:56] I'm just telling you you always was I
[54:58] don't have to die I just tell you you
[55:01] always
[55:03] was there's no need of a death of Jesus
[55:06] Christ if it's a knowledge of always
[55:16] was what kind of a statement would a man
[55:19] make when he could
[55:21] say my words are Spirit
[55:26] and their
[55:30] life but yet he was the man that turned
[55:34] back to Nicodemus and said you must be
[55:36] born
[55:38] again right
[55:41] right why was it not just Escape reading
[55:44] the word you know you got it you know
[55:46] the
[55:48] letter
[55:53] no that man and that person that could
[55:56] say that would have to be almighty
[55:59] God cuz I want it I want you to show me
[56:02] I want you show me any man outside of
[56:04] Jesus Christ almighty God in human flesh
[56:07] that could say my words are Spirit in
[56:09] their
[56:13] life I believe brother Brandon could say
[56:16] that show me where he said
[56:20] it my Bible says everything we have what
[56:25] we
[56:36] received why then would Jesus
[56:42] say that you and I must be born again to
[56:46] understand what he was
[56:48] saying is that the
[56:52] scripture is that the scripture that he
[56:54] said we must be born again to be able to
[56:56] understand what he
[57:01] said if your words my words were spirit
[57:04] and life if brother Brandon's words were
[57:06] spirit and life
[57:08] then you don't need Jesus to get you a
[57:11] new birth that's right
[57:14] amen if you always was eternal you don't
[57:17] need the death of Christ
[57:22] amen well that's what I said now they
[57:24] well brother Dale all that was done to
[57:27] just tell us who we
[57:31] are you mean Jesus
[57:34] died on the
[57:36] cross and all he had to do was
[57:39] say you are what you are I'm telling
[57:44] you you say I know I'm sarcastic hateful
[57:48] and arrogant 73 years old but there's
[57:52] one thing about it I was preaching this
[57:53] when I was 30 years old
[57:58] shortly
[58:00] thereafter about
[58:08] 1971 because see I've believed it 10 and
[58:11] how much more do I believe it
[58:14] now like we were talking about last
[58:16] night in the Bible
[58:17] study and I told him you know my
[58:20] favorite statement I'd rather go through
[58:23] life searching for
[58:25] God praying and seeking him for an
[58:29] answer to my human being that I can know
[58:33] that I'm
[58:36] saved and one day get there and find out
[58:39] about the man that brother brandham told
[58:40] up you remember he read the track and he
[58:43] went here and he went here and he went
[58:44] here and here and here and brother
[58:46] around when he went he said you got it
[58:47] when you back
[58:50] there I'd rather God to tell me that one
[58:53] day but i' sure hate to be that I well
[58:59] if I deny that I'm saved I didn't say
[59:03] nothing about denying you're saved I
[59:05] said confess you're saved until you come
[59:09] to
[59:10] it amen what about when you get there
[59:14] what about the woman that was
[59:18] anointed with the Holy Ghost you get on
[59:21] to that she Tau to Sunday school and
[59:24] things
[59:26] you couldn't tell her she was
[59:29] lost but when she come down to her dying
[59:31] hour everything broke forth and her real
[59:34] Soul come up she's begin to scream she's
[59:37] lost wouldn't it be something to wind up
[59:39] one day realize you're lost and that you
[59:42] wouldn't seek God why wouldn't any
[59:45] Christian is there ever a man you've
[59:47] ever heard of that sought God and cried
[59:51] and laid before him and more than your
[59:54] Prophet did
[59:56] don't you believe he had the new
[59:59] birth but yet he would constantly say
[1:00:01] Lord I hope I'm
[1:00:04] saved that's right I believe I
[1:00:08] am what about
[1:00:10] it what about it
[1:00:14] Church see the man that said my words
[1:00:17] are spirit and life said you must be
[1:00:20] born
[1:00:23] again he said to be able to understand
[1:00:26] what I'm saying
[1:00:30] right now is it in the scripture that no
[1:00:33] man can call Jesus the Christ
[1:00:36] what except by the holy ghost or Holy
[1:00:39] Spirit Every Which Way it says and what
[1:00:42] is the prophet's definition of
[1:00:44] that he said by the new birth a personal
[1:00:49] experience all
[1:00:52] right why would Jesus say say what he
[1:00:55] did go ahead with number four John
[1:00:59] 8:43 why would Jesus say this if we were
[1:01:02] all so spiritual all so knowingly and
[1:01:05] all so got so
[1:01:08] much and look what he
[1:01:11] says why do you not understand my
[1:01:20] speech now if my words are spirit and
[1:01:23] life if your words is spirit and life
[1:01:25] when he speaks I'd get it spirit and
[1:01:28] life right come
[1:01:33] on he said even because you cannot hear
[1:01:36] my
[1:01:37] word now the Bible goes and said to
[1:01:40] hearing the word went
[1:01:44] out to all the
[1:01:47] world why they're not
[1:01:53] saved
[1:01:56] why is it you can't understand my speech
[1:01:58] was it Japanese Chinese
[1:02:02] or now you got more sense than
[1:02:07] that but he said you can't understand
[1:02:10] what I'm talking
[1:02:13] about didn't he say to Nicodemus you
[1:02:15] must be born again wouldn't that exactly
[1:02:17] what he would be saying to him he said
[1:02:19] Nicodemus you can't understand what I'm
[1:02:22] saying why
[1:02:26] he said I've already put it in my
[1:02:29] word how to be born again Ezekiel 36
[1:02:34] give you a new heart and a new spirit
[1:02:35] then I put my spirit in
[1:02:39] you is that in the word there'd come a
[1:02:42] time when it wouldn't be said that the
[1:02:44] fathers ate grapes and the children's
[1:02:45] teeth were on edge
[1:02:49] right the whole Old Testament was
[1:02:51] pointing to the new birth that's
[1:02:55] right he said you don't understand my
[1:03:00] speech Nicodemus you must be born
[1:03:06] again he said I don't understand your
[1:03:11] speech you're speaking strange
[1:03:16] things he said the reason you don't
[1:03:18] understand my speech is you don't
[1:03:20] understand my
[1:03:22] word you've heard it
[1:03:28] but you have no faith is that's what it
[1:03:30] says in the in Romans about the children
[1:03:32] of Israel that they sought it not by
[1:03:37] faith they knew the letter of the word
[1:03:40] right
[1:03:42] Nicodemus the teacher in
[1:03:47] Israel Jesus said you studied the word
[1:03:50] you've been in the word you've lived in
[1:03:52] the word but said you don't understand
[1:03:53] what I'm talking talking about and said
[1:03:56] all that's been said before me is
[1:03:58] speaking that I must die to give my
[1:04:02] life to where it can come back in you
[1:04:05] that you can
[1:04:08] understand you get it why do you not
[1:04:11] understand my
[1:04:14] speech even because you cannot hear my
[1:04:19] word they heard it to the
[1:04:23] letter but they never got it off the
[1:04:28] letter and when he begin to speak of you
[1:04:30] must be born again that was strange
[1:04:36] language it's strange today to tell the
[1:04:38] people of this message you must be born
[1:04:40] again you know why I believe the
[1:04:45] prophet I believe everything Prophet
[1:04:50] says
[1:04:53] well
[1:04:57] Hallelujah and that's where that God did
[1:04:59] choose a few old hardheads like me to be
[1:05:02] able to bring out a few things and said
[1:05:04] what do you think about
[1:05:06] that what do you think about Daniel 70
[1:05:09] weeks being so
[1:05:13] perfect well I think he was wrong
[1:05:16] here who gave you the
[1:05:19] right to say he was
[1:05:23] wrong
[1:05:26] amen
[1:05:28] right the Bible still speaking his
[1:05:30] brother Brown said whe what was that
[1:05:32] people you know that said we speak where
[1:05:34] the Bible speaks and we're silent where
[1:05:36] it's silent he said the Bible's still
[1:05:40] talking you
[1:05:41] remember they said there only 12 got the
[1:05:44] Holy Ghost he said well Paul got the
[1:05:46] Holy Ghost 30 years later and was still
[1:05:48] ordaining throughout the church down to
[1:05:50] there and he said besides said there was
[1:05:53] 3,000 on the day Pentecost come on let
[1:05:55] got the Holy Ghost he said the Bible's
[1:05:57] still
[1:06:01] talking why is it the people of this
[1:06:03] message don't
[1:06:06] understand because they don't know the
[1:06:10] word you mean I come up through you mean
[1:06:13] you come up through all of your life
[1:06:14] through the word being taught that you
[1:06:16] must be born
[1:06:18] again come
[1:06:20] on you see why did I get I know I get
[1:06:25] statements and it's
[1:06:27] hard but I'm trying to save your soul I
[1:06:29] don't give a hoot what you think about
[1:06:31] this outside you're looking
[1:06:33] at if I can stand there that day and
[1:06:35] present you to Christ we won't have no
[1:06:38] problem about bodies in
[1:06:45] words but you
[1:06:47] see the word has first got to be sown
[1:06:52] amen before can be
[1:06:55] quickened look at John 16
[1:06:58] and13 he tells you what will
[1:07:02] happen
[1:07:03] right how be it when he the spirit of
[1:07:06] Truth is
[1:07:08] come you don't understand now you can't
[1:07:11] call Jesus the Christ I know I'm putting
[1:07:13] another scripture over there and another
[1:07:14] man making it but he's still the same
[1:07:16] Holy Ghost
[1:07:19] right he will guide you into all
[1:07:22] truth he shall not speak of himself but
[1:07:27] whatsoever he shall hear that shall he
[1:07:29] speak and he will show you things to
[1:07:33] come brother brandham said he not only
[1:07:36] Quicken what Jesus
[1:07:38] said but said he told them things to
[1:07:46] come what about
[1:07:48] it see our words are not spirit in life
[1:07:51] do you understand
[1:07:52] me
[1:07:55] our words are not spirit and
[1:07:57] life the Quicken word is spirit and life
[1:08:01] right the quickened word is the seed of
[1:08:04] God that's right not natural
[1:08:08] letters well I just go sewing
[1:08:12] seed what
[1:08:15] kind uh there's a group of people there
[1:08:18] one day that evidently thought they were
[1:08:19] so in seed but a certain man stood up
[1:08:22] one day and said
[1:08:26] you stand in the
[1:08:28] door and said you won't go in you
[1:08:32] remember Jesus saying that and said you
[1:08:34] won't let the people go in and said you
[1:08:37] won't go in
[1:08:42] yourself how about
[1:08:46] it see you and I must hear the
[1:08:51] word now what did it say about to the
[1:08:56] parable they took the word and it
[1:08:59] sprouted up a little bit in one group
[1:09:01] the other one that just choked it out
[1:09:03] and this one done that and but it says
[1:09:05] they kept the
[1:09:07] word one of them says held I think is
[1:09:09] the original didn't say anything those
[1:09:13] disciples took the word and held
[1:09:17] it and you know what happened on De
[1:09:19] Pentecost the Holy Ghost
[1:09:21] quickened right
[1:09:24] he was seen of over 500 Brethren
[1:09:26] Brethren it says so evidently they must
[1:09:29] have been
[1:09:30] Believers but we where they at on the
[1:09:32] day of Pentecost when it only 120 in the
[1:09:34] upper room right evidently 380 didn't
[1:09:37] value the word they heard it was not
[1:09:40] being mixed with faith Peter and him at
[1:09:43] least come out with one thing that's
[1:09:45] what I can't understand about you and me
[1:09:47] why can't we just come down to it and
[1:09:49] say that's
[1:09:52] it see that's one thing you can't get
[1:09:55] out of preachers if for them to tell you
[1:09:57] what they
[1:09:58] believe they want to preach it and then
[1:10:02] when you get
[1:10:07] it they won't tell you what to
[1:10:11] believe you can't say that about
[1:10:14] me that's right everything from marriage
[1:10:17] and divorce to se to serpent seeds to
[1:10:21] seals to Danel 70 weeks I told you what
[1:10:25] I
[1:10:29] believe why because I'm trying to se the
[1:10:31] seat of the
[1:10:33] word but I realized as I tried to
[1:10:35] explain to you the other day like I said
[1:10:38] you see something right brother Coler
[1:10:39] you see something oh it's beautiful you
[1:10:41] just man you can just you can lay there
[1:10:43] the other day I was down there in the
[1:10:44] woods and I just sat there I didn't give
[1:10:47] a hoood about a de I just sitting there
[1:10:50] in my mind I just let it run through the
[1:10:52] message amen of what I was thinking
[1:10:55] on you know two hours later I was
[1:10:58] wondering what I thought that's right do
[1:11:01] you ever do that amen you try you see
[1:11:04] something it's so beautiful oh oh I just
[1:11:08] got you
[1:11:11] go you know I really can't explain
[1:11:14] it like I said brother randam
[1:11:18] said you walk away and say I should have
[1:11:20] said so and
[1:11:21] so he said God didn't want you to say
[1:11:25] that or he would have brought it to your
[1:11:27] attention right come
[1:11:31] on but don't worry about it just keep on
[1:11:33] pounding on it it'll come
[1:11:37] back I like what brother Woodby said one
[1:11:40] time he said if you can explain it real
[1:11:42] good said I doubt it's a revelation and
[1:11:44] that's a good
[1:11:48] point why because it becomes words
[1:11:55] words you
[1:12:00] so words you so see his words are Spirit
[1:12:04] in their
[1:12:09] life his words are Spirit in their
[1:12:13] life look let's get this one more and
[1:12:16] then we'll quit and we'll just start
[1:12:17] this evening on the message that's no
[1:12:19] problem go to number
[1:12:22] six
[1:12:25] this is taken from Investments 1963 803
[1:12:28] to be in paragraph 137 is really where
[1:12:31] it's at remember this is God in letter
[1:12:35] form you're talking about eternal life
[1:12:38] policy it like to he said this is God in
[1:12:40] the letter form my words are Spirit
[1:12:43] Jesus said and they are life did he say
[1:12:46] it congregation says amen he also said
[1:12:50] this in St John the first chapter
[1:12:54] the Bible tells us in the beginning was
[1:12:56] the word and the Word was with God and
[1:12:59] the
[1:13:00] word word excuse me the in the beginning
[1:13:03] was the word and the Word was God and
[1:13:06] the Word was made flesh as I just got
[1:13:09] through telling
[1:13:11] you and dwelt Among
[1:13:14] Us taking words our spirit and Life to
[1:13:17] John
[1:13:21] 1 cuz you see when he said
[1:13:25] that as far as he was concerned it was
[1:13:28] alive
[1:13:33] right when those prophets
[1:13:36] spoke they spoke in the first
[1:13:40] person the psalmist David said they
[1:13:42] pierced my hands and my feet the dogs
[1:13:45] barked and wagged at
[1:13:47] me not a bone was broken David
[1:13:51] said until they could asked is this man
[1:13:54] even in Isaiah the the the Ethiopian
[1:13:58] unit is this man speaking of himself or
[1:13:59] is he speaking of
[1:14:05] another remember the words that I'm
[1:14:07] saying when a prophet receives the
[1:14:10] thought from
[1:14:11] God he must speak that thought for it to
[1:14:15] be a word but to him it's
[1:14:20] Eternal but to the person it spokes to
[1:14:23] it becomes
[1:14:28] letter right it becomes letter I'll
[1:14:33] emphasize again even though the angel
[1:14:36] could tell Mary what would take place
[1:14:40] she had to say be it unto me according
[1:14:42] to Thy word then and only then could she
[1:14:47] have the seed of the woman that God
[1:14:51] created egg and sperm both and placed it
[1:14:54] within her even her own confession never
[1:14:57] brought a seed right her own confession
[1:15:00] never brought a an egg right
[1:15:06] right it took God to create amen that's
[1:15:12] right oh if I can just tell you where
[1:15:14] I'm headed to one of these days you're
[1:15:16] going to see
[1:15:22] it this message can only come to you and
[1:15:26] I as a
[1:15:32] thought it's up to
[1:15:35] you brother randam said these
[1:15:39] ministers will pick this
[1:15:44] up and sweep it on to the coming of the
[1:15:47] Lord that's
[1:15:51] right do we believe that
[1:15:55] amen are you depending on somebody to
[1:15:58] speak the word to you or are you just
[1:15:59] going to get it yourself and just
[1:16:02] remember when you think you're getting
[1:16:04] it yourself you got to read what
[1:16:06] somebody said cuz you're reading the
[1:16:08] prophets message here in the tape are
[1:16:11] you're reading the Bible that somebody
[1:16:13] said right so don't come up with garbage
[1:16:17] can that I can just get it
[1:16:22] myself
[1:16:24] see we want to speak the word let me say
[1:16:26] this and you'll see where I'm headed
[1:16:27] about 15 sermons away or maybe sometime
[1:16:30] the end of the end of this
[1:16:35] year brother Brandon spoke five times is
[1:16:37] that right he spoke other times we know
[1:16:39] that but five times he
[1:16:42] recorded you know what he
[1:16:45] said he said every time was sovereignly
[1:16:51] given now don't you think that his wife
[1:16:55] having that tumor and getting larger and
[1:16:58] larger don't you think that brother
[1:17:00] brandham tried his best fasting and
[1:17:04] praying and seeking God to take that
[1:17:08] away and if he could have just come up
[1:17:10] with thus sayeth the Lord you know just
[1:17:13] if he could have got it but yet he could
[1:17:15] say the Bible is thus sayeth the
[1:17:18] Lord but he knew better than to say it
[1:17:20] letter on the page was going to heal her
[1:17:25] don't you think that he would have tried
[1:17:28] to speak it
[1:17:30] right but see then one
[1:17:34] day God dropped
[1:17:37] down see we want to make brother random
[1:17:39] as being the one that just speak the
[1:17:42] word
[1:17:44] anyway he couldn't speak it till God
[1:17:47] gave
[1:17:48] it yeah but I thought speak to this
[1:17:52] mountain
[1:17:54] I I thought the same Bible that said
[1:17:56] speak to this mountain said it's not you
[1:17:59] that speaketh but the
[1:18:01] father that dwelleth in you he's one
[1:18:03] that's doing the speaking that's kind of
[1:18:06] I thought the Bible said
[1:18:07] that my brother there you're just
[1:18:09] destroying everything CU we thought we
[1:18:11] would just build on one of these days we
[1:18:13] just going to walk in here and we just
[1:18:15] going to call for a a porter housee
[1:18:21] steak and it'll just be laid out in
[1:18:23] front of
[1:18:29] us
[1:18:30] right you say you don't believe it will
[1:18:33] happen yeah I've seen it happen so I
[1:18:35] don't have to worry about
[1:18:37] it I don't have to worry about what I've
[1:18:40] seen we had a service here one time we
[1:18:43] didn't have enough food for half the
[1:18:44] people that was
[1:18:48] here they begin to talk to me about what
[1:18:50] we going to do I said put it out for the
[1:18:51] people there'd be plenty
[1:18:57] it took
[1:19:01] place yeah
[1:19:05] but you don't like to talk to somebody
[1:19:07] that's got enough Goods to be able to
[1:19:09] talk back to you
[1:19:11] do you want to be in that category that
[1:19:15] you ain't got nothing and I ain't got
[1:19:17] nothing we're all just sitting around
[1:19:20] cuz we ain't got nothing
[1:19:26] I like kind of what brother Hal Thomas
[1:19:27] said one day he's listening to this and
[1:19:29] he knows it's
[1:19:30] right he needed
[1:19:33] prayer thought come to him same God is
[1:19:38] here
[1:19:40] today as he was with the
[1:19:43] prophet let me just go up and be prayed
[1:19:45] for you know what he's
[1:19:50] delivered right
[1:19:55] but you see
[1:19:57] folks we've got it all figured
[1:20:02] out but you know if it don't come our
[1:20:05] way come on
[1:20:06] musicians if it don't come our
[1:20:09] way what have we got figured
[1:20:16] out I think it's this way
[1:20:21] okay
[1:20:26] I don't mind putting what I believe on
[1:20:28] the
[1:20:29] line I think you ought to be willing
[1:20:34] to that's why you don't come out hear me
[1:20:36] come out here and say I think so and so
[1:20:38] is going to happen I think maybe it'll
[1:20:39] be this way I don't say maybe if I ever
[1:20:43] speak to you I speak
[1:20:46] it because maybe can be
[1:20:49] questioned like one one man one brother
[1:20:51] said one time he said let's just watch
[1:20:54] them and
[1:20:56] said something will happen to them like
[1:20:58] a car wreck or
[1:21:02] something well you know after maybe 40
[1:21:05] 50 years driving you're probably going
[1:21:07] to have a
[1:21:09] wreck right brother random didn't speak
[1:21:12] like
[1:21:14] that you tell me something going to
[1:21:16] happen I want to know the date I want to
[1:21:19] know the time the season where it's
[1:21:22] going to happen
[1:21:23] well I didn't see that Brother D I just
[1:21:26] seen people that got
[1:21:32] sick that ain't
[1:21:35] nothing tell me who's sick what you
[1:21:37] going to do about
[1:21:41] it see that's why we try to speak our
[1:21:44] own words by our own
[1:21:45] thoughts and what does it wind up
[1:21:48] being I hope you understand one thing
[1:21:51] this morning nothing else
[1:21:53] Jesus said my words are spirit and life
[1:21:55] when he spoke it it was
[1:21:58] alive but when
[1:22:00] we we think our words are spirit and Li
[1:22:03] when we get it from God and it's
[1:22:05] quickened by the Holy Ghost Mary could
[1:22:08] go out and say I'm
[1:22:14] pregnant
[1:22:17] right why because she took God's
[1:22:21] word and he could Quicken
[1:22:25] it she had something to show for
[1:22:32] it you see we think we're so spiritual
[1:22:35] right what we got let's Stand Together
[1:22:36] 231 231 we'll pick this up and finish
[1:22:39] the message this
[1:22:41] evening
[1:22:47] glor he so completely then satisfied my
[1:22:54] now as I face dark and troubl
[1:22:59] SE I wonder if he is satisfied with
[1:23:05] me I want my Lord to be satisfied with
[1:23:10] me then we just keep walking in the
[1:23:13] word what
[1:23:17] it the prophet told us what will happen
[1:23:20] that great eternity
[1:23:24] he said we going to walk off this
[1:23:26] Earth I believe that he said to stick of
[1:23:30] be here by word I believe
[1:23:39] that he said the bride will become the
[1:23:41] word I believe
[1:23:45] that he said the bride is to vindicate I
[1:23:48] looking at this
[1:23:49] morning the bride is to vindicate
[1:23:52] Malachi 4 I
[1:23:56] my I thought that brother brand
[1:24:01] I I thought it said that he turn the
[1:24:05] parts of the
[1:24:07] children back to the
[1:24:11] fathers I thought that mean
[1:24:14] you what about it do we believe it give
[1:24:17] me strength me courage make me
[1:24:21] go that I might lead some sheep
[1:24:27] thy that I might stand unraid un
[1:24:33] the that you might be fully satisfied
[1:24:38] with
[1:24:39] me I want my Lord to be satisfied with
[1:24:44] me and I want my life to be what it
[1:24:50] me and when I God to that great
[1:24:56] eternity his smile will say is satisfied
[1:25:01] with
[1:25:02] me oh I want my Lord to be satisfied
[1:25:07] with
[1:25:08] me and I want my life to be what it have
[1:25:14] be then when I come to that great
[1:25:20] eternity I will say
[1:25:22] he is satisfied with
[1:25:25] me I want my Lord to be satisfied with
[1:25:31] me I want my life to be what it have
[1:25:48] beenen our sister was was talking about
[1:25:50] it
[1:25:51] yesterday
[1:25:55] brother Bob come on and she said I want
[1:25:58] to baptism of the Holy Ghost I want to
[1:26:00] know I got it I said okay we pray with
[1:26:04] you
[1:26:06] you but now
[1:26:09] listen you've heard the word right
[1:26:13] you've been baptized because the word
[1:26:15] says it you followed the Lord okay now
[1:26:19] all we need to do is pray for the Lord
[1:26:21] to Quicken it
[1:26:23] the new birth is the birth of that word
[1:26:24] you
[1:26:26] heard okay now here's what you got to do
[1:26:30] though you got to confess
[1:26:33] it right because that's scripture
[1:26:36] believe in your heart confess with your
[1:26:38] mouth okay
[1:26:41] now so from now on you can't say I'm not
[1:26:47] saved if you do you've come back out
[1:26:50] from where we're praying you've pulled
[1:26:53] yourself out and then you're lying see
[1:26:55] this plain language you're not doing it
[1:26:57] right so from now on you say I wish
[1:27:01] Brother Gary Atkins would here maybe he
[1:27:02] listen in today and he could tell you
[1:27:05] two i' done it two years and confess
[1:27:07] God's word before I got the Holy Ghost
[1:27:09] he went a year and he kept coming to me
[1:27:12] and he kept coming he said brother Dale
[1:27:14] but I see the one God I see this I see
[1:27:16] that I said that's fine that's all right
[1:27:18] that's good that's the seed being
[1:27:20] planted but I said one day day God will
[1:27:22] speak to you and you will
[1:27:25] know and for one year he confessed it he
[1:27:29] called me one day he'd call me
[1:27:31] constantly from Alabama riding the road
[1:27:33] because he was carrying films to be
[1:27:35] developed Etc back forth but one day he
[1:27:38] called me from the rest area he said
[1:27:40] it's over
[1:27:42] with he said it was settled right here
[1:27:44] you mean it was settled in a rest area
[1:27:46] or on a I20 driving down the
[1:27:49] highway well brother tat him my remember
[1:27:51] him tell him he said I sit that on that
[1:27:53] apple tree and he said it just like
[1:27:59] raindrops you can't make it happen when
[1:28:02] you want it to happen that's our problem
[1:28:05] but we can believe
[1:28:07] it so never confess no more you drive it
[1:28:10] down right now Satan comes back and said
[1:28:12] you didn't get saved said okay I was
[1:28:14] there and there was five People Prayed
[1:28:16] with me plus the whole
[1:28:17] church they prayed for me and I'm going
[1:28:20] to say that I am born
[1:28:23] again all right now you say well brother
[1:28:26] does that automatically make me no I
[1:28:28] didn't say that I said you keep
[1:28:31] confessing it until one day you'll tell
[1:28:33] me you're born
[1:28:36] again but you got to tell God because
[1:28:38] you got to say what he
[1:28:41] says he said believe in your heart
[1:28:43] confess with your
[1:28:45] mouth you remember what we talking about
[1:28:47] last night even brother Brown talking
[1:28:48] about his daughter-in-law Lois she
[1:28:51] receive the Holy Ghost one night the
[1:28:52] next night she was doubting it now
[1:28:55] that's on the
[1:28:58] message you mean that that you can get
[1:29:00] the Holy Ghost and doubt
[1:29:03] yeah because you're still human that's
[1:29:06] right but when that word is
[1:29:09] revealed and you say by that word is
[1:29:11] revealed the word and the spirit Has
[1:29:13] Come Together be it unto me according to
[1:29:15] Thy
[1:29:17] word and it'll have to take
[1:29:20] place around say
[1:29:22] when the bride begins to say that he
[1:29:25] said you'll see Sparks are
[1:29:28] flying when we begin to say what he says
[1:29:31] all right do you understand what I'm
[1:29:33] saying but brother Dale do I need to
[1:29:35] feel
[1:29:36] anything what feeling do you
[1:29:40] want now I can quote brother random
[1:29:43] because he says if you desire to speak
[1:29:45] in tongues and you lay under the spout
[1:29:48] long enough God is good to let you speak
[1:29:49] in tongues what are you going to say say
[1:29:52] you ain't saved you speak in tongue no
[1:29:53] we're going to say it right
[1:29:55] here we're going to say today right at
[1:29:58] this time about 3 minutes till 12 on my
[1:30:00] watch we're going to say you are born
[1:30:04] again we're going to say that you've
[1:30:07] received the Holy Ghost this day and
[1:30:09] whatever God
[1:30:11] does that's up to
[1:30:14] him you say yeah but no you ought to get
[1:30:17] me emotional and sing me up and pray me
[1:30:20] up
[1:30:23] I I didn't know they was prayed up I I
[1:30:25] mean I thought in the book of Acts that
[1:30:26] it says they were in the upper room and
[1:30:29] probably doubting what was going
[1:30:31] on and the Holy Ghost
[1:30:34] came the Holy Ghost is
[1:30:37] Promised is unto you your children the
[1:30:40] many of are far off and even the Lord
[1:30:43] thy God shall call it's a promise repent
[1:30:47] everyone of be baptized in the name of
[1:30:48] Jesus Christ and you what shall receive
[1:30:51] the gift gift of the Holy Ghost all
[1:30:53] right let's settle the
[1:30:56] problem but don't you go now and say
[1:30:59] well I ever didn't they didn't get
[1:31:02] it because that's going to mean you
[1:31:04] didn't get
[1:31:05] it but when you go and say I've received
[1:31:09] it this
[1:31:10] day now whatever comes with
[1:31:14] God all
[1:31:16] right let's believe it okay let's lay
[1:31:19] hands on our sister and believe and our
[1:31:21] brother wants the same thing so let's
[1:31:26] believe thanes and accept it
[1:31:31] father we're not built on emotional
[1:31:34] situations we love them they are
[1:31:37] wonderful Lord and I believe in them
[1:31:39] we're built on what you say in your word
[1:31:42] you said repent everyone and be baptized
[1:31:43] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[1:31:45] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[1:31:47] the prophet said we wind up saying when
[1:31:49] they say what must we do we try to to
[1:31:51] tell them what to do and not to do quit
[1:31:53] this and quit that he said that wasn't a
[1:31:56] question or the thought we
[1:31:59] believe that Lord you died for our
[1:32:03] sister to
[1:32:04] receive the Holy Ghost she has heard
[1:32:07] your word she sat down here and listened
[1:32:11] when even she probably wanted to leave
[1:32:13] she didn't want to hang around because
[1:32:15] it wasn't according to her previous
[1:32:17] thinkings and thoughts but yet Lord she
[1:32:20] stayed
[1:32:22] she believes it our brother's here too
[1:32:24] Lord and he he's believing you so now
[1:32:27] we're going to say that they are this
[1:32:31] day a born again
[1:32:33] Christian and they're confessing it but
[1:32:35] their confession has got to be continual
[1:32:38] he that believeth in his baptized shall
[1:32:40] be saved if we stop believing Lord we're
[1:32:43] not saved but if we keep confessing it
[1:32:46] confessing it confessing it every time
[1:32:48] the Devil comes to you sister and
[1:32:49] brother just say but the words says it
[1:32:52] God said it I believe his
[1:32:55] word you have given me the new birth
[1:32:59] because Lord it has to start as a
[1:33:02] thought if they would get the thought of
[1:33:05] what I'm trying to say it has to start
[1:33:07] as a thought in their mind when they
[1:33:09] walked down here the prophet said that
[1:33:12] was 50 or 60% of the whole story for
[1:33:15] them to walk down here and say I want
[1:33:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and most
[1:33:19] people will say I already got it I
[1:33:21] already got
[1:33:23] Lord we love you and we thank you
[1:33:27] Father that you've give our brother our
[1:33:29] sister the baptism of the Holy Ghost now
[1:33:33] Lord you give them a little tug on their
[1:33:36] heart right now or whenever you want to
[1:33:40] in the middle of the
[1:33:41] night when they're crying out unto you
[1:33:44] that they can see you Lord and they can
[1:33:47] say I believe I am a born again
[1:33:51] Christian
[1:33:52] go we confess our way into
[1:33:55] everything we must believe
[1:33:58] it and we confess it we believe it now
[1:34:02] in the name of Jesus
[1:34:04] Christ amen and amen amen and
[1:34:08] amen then go confess it now don't let
[1:34:11] the devil get anything to say and he
[1:34:13] will as quick as you start right back
[1:34:15] through there he's going to say you
[1:34:16] didn't get
[1:34:17] it well now why would he say
[1:34:20] it
[1:34:22] got it now I've already explained this
[1:34:24] to everybody here because that's what I
[1:34:27] believe the Lord ain't going to tell you
[1:34:29] that you don't have something because if
[1:34:31] you just repented of your sins you got
[1:34:33] something so he's not going to tell he
[1:34:36] tell you you need
[1:34:37] more okay all right but the devil's one
[1:34:40] that's going to tell you you didn't get
[1:34:42] it and see if he can make you doubt it
[1:34:45] then he'll take it away from
[1:34:47] you but you confess your way right into
[1:34:50] it
[1:34:52] I wish I could stand here all afternoon
[1:34:55] and talk about two
[1:34:58] years taking and reading as many as six
[1:35:02] books a day and listening to two tapes
[1:35:05] man sitting right there he telling it
[1:35:07] the other night brother collie when he
[1:35:10] know I sat right down there that's all
[1:35:11] we done is read and talked about the
[1:35:15] word but see one
[1:35:18] day it was quickened I had seen
[1:35:24] angels I know two times and one is
[1:35:27] questionable about the time El because
[1:35:29] we were already over where we live but
[1:35:31] that would have been
[1:35:33] 73 but I had seen all kind of things but
[1:35:37] I can't make that an
[1:35:40] Evidence it's whether or not my spirit
[1:35:42] agrees with that
[1:35:43] word keeps on
[1:35:46] agreeing you mean you won't never have a
[1:35:48] doubt oh yeah cuz the devil's going to
[1:35:51] try to make you
[1:35:52] doubt but I'm like Abraham I'm going to
[1:35:55] doubt my
[1:35:56] doubts Hallelujah remember Abraham
[1:35:59] didn't have the Holy Ghost to believe
[1:36:02] right but you can have the Holy Ghost
[1:36:05] when you just confess your way right
[1:36:07] into it but don't never just Mark the
[1:36:10] Spot and say right there this day
[1:36:13] January the
[1:36:14] 5th is finished hallelujah what else you
[1:36:18] going to do well I I want to shout and
[1:36:20] scream go right
[1:36:22] ahead I told a man down y go ahead I
[1:36:25] told a man down in Atlanta one day he
[1:36:28] said when when the spirit strikes me he
[1:36:30] said I just or somebody here maybe then
[1:36:33] I just start running I said don't slow
[1:36:35] down I might run into you you yeah I
[1:36:39] said just don't slow down I might run
[1:36:41] into you cuzu you know it's whatever the
[1:36:45] Lord
[1:36:46] Stripes but you said but the new birth
[1:36:49] will you explain to me now they were
[1:36:51] sitting in the upper
[1:36:54] room it says in one mind and one
[1:36:56] Accord but yet your Prophet is already
[1:36:59] explained it to you that one of them
[1:37:01] said I don't I think we already got
[1:37:04] it one of them says no we don't have it
[1:37:08] so there was evidently a lot of
[1:37:13] problems but he promised it and it came
[1:37:18] right it'll come to you that the same
[1:37:20] way you believe
[1:37:23] it and accept it
[1:37:28] father we just believe your
[1:37:31] word we believe that if we just keep
[1:37:34] confessing then in somewhere it'll be
[1:37:37] made manifest and we'll look back and
[1:37:40] you'll say well you you got it right
[1:37:42] back there you just needed to keep
[1:37:44] confessing till you got out of the way
[1:37:47] CU we believe it
[1:37:49] Lord we believe what that Prophet has
[1:37:51] taught unto
[1:37:53] us we also know that it's got to be
[1:37:57] revealed and that's all we're trying to
[1:37:59] do have your way with us dismiss us now

[1:38:05] the thought we love you and we thank you
[1:38:08] blessed waiting them on their way home
[1:38:09] today maybe Joe and them we just pray
[1:38:11] that you'd take care of them because if
[1:38:13] it's not meant for them to leave out
[1:38:15] they need to stay there until it clears
[1:38:17] up but that's up to you Lord so you just
[1:38:20] come and make it manifest we love you
